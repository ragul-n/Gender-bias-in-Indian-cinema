1
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,903
Where's the Principal?
-Gone for lunch to his quarters.

2
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:50,225
See. I told u. Whenever I come, he's either 
out for lunch, or worse, leave.

3
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:53,645
He was here till 1 pm. He just left.
- I dont need your explanations, 
dont have time.

4
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,267
There's a general body meeting
at 3. Go call him.

5
00:03:58,097 --> 00:03:58,957
Come

6
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:04,055
He said he'd come by 10. Have been waiting
for him for so long, no news.

7
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:07,400
Now exactily when I'm about to touch
food, he will come. And lose his cool.

8
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,084
Why should he get angry if he's
the one getting late?
- Why dont u ask him?

9
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:17,435
Oh my Ammini, which world are u in?
Do u know who a secretary is?

10
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:23,195
He's an authority, under the government.
Do u know his power?

11
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:24,844
I dont know.

12
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:31,427
But I do know, dear. If we lock horns with
him, our daily bread would get stalled. I cant
stand up to him anymore.

13
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:33,963
Oh, dad u are so scared.

14
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:36,277
We should fear those who are to be feared

15
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:40,345
But isn't Madhavan Unni sir frank and
on-the-face whoever it be ?

16
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:45,929
HE can speak like that. He's a degree holder,
unlike me; just a 5th std pass.

17
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,823
Sir
-Oh as I said, there he is. 
Has he reached Sankara?

18
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:52,719
Yes. He wants u there, like now.
He needs to hurry back apparently

19
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:56,194
Finish food and go Dad. It's ok if
he waits 5 more minutes

20
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:58,707
General Body meeting at 3.

21
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:01,804
It's ok. Let his meeting not get delayed by me.

22
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,990
Go and return fast then, you
can have a second serving

23
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:10,686
Chuck it.. He will bully me for some
stupid reason. I'd lose apetite by then.

24
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,885
Sankara.. How about taking Madhavan
Unni with us. If he scolds, atleast there's
someone to reply

25
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,254
Will it get late?
-Hey, he lives on the way!

26
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:19,713
Okay

27
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,040
Sir, Please sit.
-No its ok.Call your brother, if he's here.

28
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:35,353
Yes he's here.

29
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:42,759
It's getting late,I'll get scolded too.
-One minute

30
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:46,588
What's up, sir?
-Nothing special. Our secretary has come.

31
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:50,641
Oh just now?
-Could u please accompany me?

32
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:56,581
Why do I need to come?
-He might misbehave with me.

33
00:05:56,951 --> 00:06:00,759
Why?
-He must've heard about my affidavit in Nandagopalan's case.

34
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,333
I affirmed in court that he's a good artist.
-Well, it's true, right?

35
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,815
Indeed.But it's not in the interest of
the KalaMandiram Committee, right?

36
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,703
They want the story to be
"Nandagopalan is not fit to teach"...

37
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:15,021
Do YOU have any problem with him
returning to this establishment?

38
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:19,901
Why would I? But the committee,other teachers
and students dont seem to like his return.

39
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:24,887
Without considering all that, I ended
up praising him in the court.Now I fear
I will get a memo for that.

40
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:29,120
Oh, let him give. It's a memo. Not
an atom bomb.U just need to
give an explanation

41
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,923
Shall I get lime juice for you, sir?
-No thanks, no time.A glass of water would do.

42
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,570
My throat's drying up.
-Sir, the time...

43
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,269
Oh well. Chuck the water. Let's leave

44
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:45,528
Hey stop getting scared like this.
Sankara, u go ahead. Tell him the principal will come.

45
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:49,871
I didnt contest the workers Union president elections on purpose.

46
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:54,691
When I was President, my hand
in the progress is well known.

47
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:59,581
Can today's half-baked chiefs produce that? Shit is what will be the outcome.

48
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:07,802
Amateurs. What political experience sense
do they have.Can they even dream
of my current position?

49
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:18,422
I didn't know that u had an eye for this post.
-I never wanted it. Who's interested in this Kathakali and gimmicks here?

50
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:26,239
Chief Minister said "Velayudha.. u need to straighten out KalaMandiram".I obliged without objection

51
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:33,412
THAT is discipline. I could have asked
for Khadi Board, or Exports or Foreign
trade. But I never asked.

52
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:40,336
CM told my service is required HERE, in the state.And for sure I am going to set this place right.

53
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:44,433
It isn't that bad here. A couple of foreign
trips will come your way.

54
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:50,424
Oh, but they have no funds. No money
U know the drill.I plan to collect a new fund.

55
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:53,048
Where is he?
-On his way

56
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:58,252
Idiot ! I asked u to get him along, why did u return
without him? Go get him now!

57
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:06,108
Who's the principal?
-A Kathakali artist. Raavunni Nambeesan.
They claim he was 'famous' earlier. Who knows ?

58
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:10,595
There, he has 'graced us with
his presence'. This is the Principal!

59
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,638
And they are?...
-Not of concern right now

60
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:20,121
Why're u here, Madhavan Unni? I'd not called u.
- Since u came, I thought I'll pay u a visit.

61
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:26,409
Nambeesan... in Nandagopan's 
case, whose side are u on?

62
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:31,643
Our side, of course!
-Then why did u praise 
him in court, when on oath ?

63
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:38,566
Well, had to be honest, he IS a good artist.
- Does such a statement strengthen our case?

64
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:45,416
We are claiming his return to this establishment
is not amicable for ANYONE here. Is it not?

65
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:49,578
Yes, it is.
-Then, what $%^ statement of praise is that?

66
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:53,124
Sir! Please avoid profanity. There
is sanctity in an art house.

67
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:56,465
So !? Should I tolerate
such stupidity??

68
00:08:56,465 --> 00:09:00,114
Within our establishment,
our Principal is to be respected

69
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:04,687
In front of your guests, u should
speak to our Principal with respect

70
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,270
Respect?? I'm the topmost official here.
Should I bow in down to u all now?

71
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,335
Nothing like that. Kindly give an artist
the respect he deserves.

72
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,193
Artists... Heh.

73
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:21,476
For some criminal, if someone goes against
the interests of our school, should I respect him?

74
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:26,633
Who's the criminal here? Nandagopan
sir?The Court has judged him innocent.

75
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:29,609
It's upto the court to decide if he
should be reassigned to the school

76
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:35,898
Neither me nor Principal shall dance to
your whims in this case.U may take
any action against me.

77
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,158
That was only HIS opinion, not mine.
So please don't condone me.

78
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:49,064
GET OUT!

79
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,640
Who's this Nandagopan?
-An old dance teacher from this school. A Rowdy

80
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,221
Burnt his own wife to death.

81
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:02,900
Case got cleared...But the committee
decided not to take him back

82
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:09,527
So he's fighting legally against that. This happened
under the previous secretary. The case is still on...

83
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,314
Cant the new committee take
him back ?

84
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:17,564
He's not worth getting anywhere in here.
Filthy fellow.Has no respect for me.

85
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:20,972
A full time alcoholic,drug addict and
abuses. A bit crazy too.

86
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:24,382
(Dance rhythms)

87
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:17,066
(Nandagopan imagines wife singing....)

88
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:25,515
'The night is bright with the moonlight.
This temple has turned into paradise.'

89
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:31,836
'Spring is here. Yet, why haven't the
celebrations started, my lover?'

90
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,636
Teacher!

91
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,352
I've searched the entire
world for you

92
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,017
I didn't realize you'd sitting here
alone by the river side.

93
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,605
Who said I'm alone?

94
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:53,821
You've got company? Oh, are u
leaving? I came to see u.

95
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,126
For?
-Something for your good.I have
quit the drama troupe

96
00:11:57,126 --> 00:12:01,951
Good.
-So they all tell me. But I wont leave
empty handed from the world of art.

97
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:07,156
Don't leave. Just sit there.
-Let me complete.
I thought of starting a dance-drama troupe

98
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:09,255
How's the idea?
- Pathetic.

99
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:14,455
I'll make it happen.I've enlisted some
girls.Sweet as bananas

100
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:20,214
Is that the dance drama's name ??
-No,I meant the girls are sweet.
Drama name is 'The Urvashi Curse'

101
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,745
Awesome?
-U need to make it awesome.

102
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:27,091
I want u to make it awesome.
Do the screenplay and direction

103
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:31,535
The poisonous society is spreading
stories about you, sir.

104
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:35,902
I don't care if u are a
murderer, alcoholic or rowdy.

105
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:39,132
Art is supreme for me.
Art must grow

106
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,953
I will lift u using this
dance drama, teacher.

107
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:46,832
Get lost! I know about your attempts
to 'grow art' here and around.

108
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:53,768
I will break your bones, cheap scum!
You're going to 'lift' me? what nonsense.

109
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:58,263
Such a dumb crack. Doesn't
see the opportunity.

110
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:02,770
Is this his daily routine ?
- Yes, daily. Comes home at odd times.

111
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:09,117
I keep food on the table and sleep off.
He eats sometimes, else starves.

112
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,042
He was such a teetotaler. Nowadays
half the time, he's not in his senses.

113
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:18,823
He must be disturbed on the inside.
-Will he find peace in such drinking?

114
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:24,693
All will be well. At this age, one needs
a girl to advice and care for him.

115
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:30,464
If Nandu agrees, I'll beg Damodaran to
agree for his smart daughter's hand in marriage.

116
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:36,101
I'm tired of telling. U give it a shot,
brother. There he comes.

117
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,720
When did u come, uncle?

118
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,602
Before noon.
Why weren't u around for lunch ?

119
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:56,854
What has happened to to u? What all
I hear about u. Well, sit down.

120
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,718
No, its ok.

121
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:02,516
U are educated. U don't
need another's advice.

122
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:12,295
People face many issues in life.
How will u live if u don't move on?
Forget everything, start afresh.

123
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:16,626
Why don't u speak anything to your uncle?
-I don't have anything to say.

124
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:20,141
Can u obey what we are saying?

125
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:28,051
I had written about u to Sekaran in
Bombay. He has readied a job for u.

126
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:31,647
I don't want that.
- Do u plan to live on this art alone?

127
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:39,398
If my art is no more, so am I.
-Selfish u. Do u think about me, ur mother?

128
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:46,819
I've been suffering for 6 years now.
-Don't cry Janaki. He will understand
if we tell him calmly.

129
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:54,361
Have u met Damodaran's eldest daughter?
-Uncle, please don't take this topic with me.

130
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:59,479
Try to understand what I'm saying!
-I won't understand.

131
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:05,693
I've answered NO to mom a hundred times.
Can at least YOU people let me be?

132
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:08,304
Son, dont we have wishes too?

133
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:15,026
Maybe. But I cannot realize all your
wishes and dreams.. Sorry.

134
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:31,932
(hears wife singing....)

135
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:08,993
Don't rise.
I leave by the train at 5:30 am

136
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:11,782
Harvest time at home.

137
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:14,693
Lie down...

138
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,496
&lt;Damayanti Hotel &amp; tea shop&gt;

139
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:31,928
Oh Hydros, stop your crooning
and ask the lad to bring my tea!

140
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:34,587
Tea, quick!
-Ha, making it! (artistic expressions)

141
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:37,504
Are u making tea or kathakali?
-Can't u see?

142
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:44,837
I see navarasas (9 expressions) on ur face
-Can one forget the art learnt? 6 years..

143
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:49,950
U were also in the trade.
-So what, I could at least start a
tea shop outside Kalamandiram

144
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,195
Moreover, I get a suffix tailed to my name:
"KalaMandiram Hydros". Nice, eh?

145
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:57,095
A 'tail' should have
been at the 'back'

146
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:13,249
Hydros. Get me a glass and some water
-For?

147
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,196
To eat it up.
Can u give?

148
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:18,229
No. Isn't it for the booze ?
No glass for that

149
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,825
Just for a minute.

150
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:23,777
No! Occasional drinking is fine.
What's with this habit now?

151
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,579
No wonder u never found success.

152
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,352
Came to become Kalamandiram HyderAli. 
Yet now here u are, cleaning dishes and glasses.

153
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,150
U deserve it. Evil u.

154
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,401
At least I'm not on
the streets like u.

155
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:41,531
One more month. Court result will be out.
Then Nandu will return from his 'exile'.

156
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:45,541
Can I get a Soda at least? Thirsty.
- Ok.

157
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:07,278
My goodness! Your liver will shrink!
-Let it die. Who needs a liver. See u.

158
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:14,624
Oh God! What has come of him.

159
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,473
(dance class rhythms)

160
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,192
(At Kalamandiram)

161
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,257
Why did u stop, Malavika?

162
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:59,331
Tell me, child. Why ?

163
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,612
Let the class go on...

164
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:07,190
Why did u come here?
The secretary has cautioned u against coming here

165
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,935
Is Secretary a God? Let me find out
what's wrong if I sit here for sometime

166
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:14,501
Will u please get out of the class?

167
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:17,915
No. Let's see if anyone is brave
enough to chuck me out.

168
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:23,656
Oh my teacher, we're all artists. What's
wrong in me watching these kids learn?

169
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:28,631
We do not like that. The kids too. Didn't u
see how this girl stopped when she saw you?

170
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:32,297
That is YOUR shortcoming,
as a teacher.

171
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,208
Plus a bit of this girl's ego.

172
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:40,102
'I'm Principal's daughter. Very popular'.
Her face only carries THESE expressions.

173
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:45,331
No other expression blossoming. Only a bright
face can depict the colors of an expression.

174
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,659
First try to change the arrogant face.
Then u may learn.

175
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:54,294
Well, u can get on with ur class, I'm off.
U need not crib that 'Nandagopan spoilt it'

176
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:01,396
Why do u get upset for some
nonsense he says?

177
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:05,018
He always does this. Makes such remarks
whenever he sees me. Or stares at times.

178
00:20:05,048 --> 00:20:07,534
Filthy fellow. Why don't u
complain, teacher?

179
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:13,861
I fear what rubbish he will shout at
me if I complain. Always drunk...

180
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:17,977
If u are scared, I will complain,
teacher. I'm not scared of him.

181
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:26,163
(Performing Ottamthullal)

182
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,613
Very good

183
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,386
Lots of grace in it.

184
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,076
Thank you!

185
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:07,587
Thullal is an art that should
be explored much more.

186
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:10,883
If well played, it should be on
par with kathakali in laurels.

187
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:16,014
But who will accept this, sir? Thullal was diluted in fame
after folk performers adopted it.

188
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,989
We should restore its fame.

189
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:21,659
It's simpler than Kathakali. Not
dependent on accompanying band
or backdrops.

190
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,700
One artist presents all the
characters in mono-act.

191
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,606
Acting... Dancing... Natural, bodily, facial, vocal...
all forms of expressions and a world of possibilities.

192
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm happy hearing these comments
from a person like u, sir.

193
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,058
Not enough if I say. Let's make the people say it.
- Sir, the Secretary...

194
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:45,655
Is your job to teach Thullal? Or
making small talk with drunkards?

195
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,979
I was teaching.
That's when the Sir came.

196
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:51,589
Don't threaten the poor guy. Tell me directly.

197
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:54,220
That's what I've come for. Get out!

198
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,453
U can kick me out as u want, if I come to
your home. This is a public establishment.

199
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:06,773
As an artist, and a veteran of this school,
I can come here, watch classes, and sit here.

200
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:11,015
Oh. So will u do whatever nonsense u
want just because you're an artist?

201
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:13,895
What right did u have to enter the
girls class and insult them?

202
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:16,273
Oh. Says who ?

203
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:19,241
Whoever it be! Did u do it?
- No

204
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:23,960
Don't try ur tricks on me, I'm
Velayudhan (the trickster) here !
Get out or I'll break your bones!

205
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,739
Oh I see, will u beat me out of
here? Let's see that!

206
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:30,386
Nandagopala! Don't create a scene
here in this class. Please go out!

207
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:32,437
He's the one who
wants to use force!

208
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:37,501
I am going to hang around here. Let's see
if he will beat me out of here.

209
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:40,931
Let him just get lost, Sir!

210
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:45,053
Then what's the use of me sitting here
as Secretary with my mustache on??

211
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,264
Well he can always shave his
mustache off if needed.

212
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,473
(Madhavan Unni's Kathakali class)

213
00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:29,208
I have told u a hundred times ! Fool!

214
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:32,656
Like this!

215
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:38,889
His interest is in YOUR field. Bharatanatyam.
I'm the one who compelled him to join Kathakali

216
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:44,330
Twisted fingers alone do not create gestures.
There should be beauty and elegance to it.

217
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,615
These gestures are a language.

218
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:55,091
Good handwriting can be easily read, correct?
Else text becomes difficult to read.

219
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:58,867
That's why a layman cannot
understand or appreciate Kathakali

220
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:05,301
Ambiguous gestures, Acting done as 
a namesake exercise.. These are its issues.

221
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:10,833
Skill cannot be attained through learning
alone. It is an essence. A blessing.

222
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,168
Am I wrong?

223
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:16,754
That is the truth! Take the kalaasham...

224
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:29,851
Stop all this hooplah!

225
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:34,217
There he is.
- OH, him!

226
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:37,467
Get up!

227
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,862
What's the problem?

228
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:41,751
U want a problem?
- Don't touch me!

229
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:42,704
Sir, please...

230
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,342
Take him in...

231
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,802
What right do u have to enter my
class without my permission?

232
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:50,764
Secretary has warranted.

233
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:02,217
Walk !
- What have I wronged?

234
00:25:02,372 --> 00:25:06,294
I will tell you, at the station. Get in !

235
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:12,625
Now u understand? My 'force'?

236
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,751
These people wont kill me.
I will show u 'my force' later.

237
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:21,542
What is wrong in him sitting in the class ?
- I shall manage affairs here, u dont need to intervene.

238
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:28,294
What can I do? I have to obey
when Secretary says something

239
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:37,481
So u want to bully
the Secretary?

240
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,920
Will u dare go there again? Tell me!

241
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:43,512
Enough, Sir.

242
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,242
Water....

243
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:52,014
Starve him. Let him learn decency.

244
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:02,984
What do u want?

245
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:09,676
Please do not register a case against
Nandagopalan. He's innocent

246
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:14,486
Secretary told me he barged into
a girl's class and created problems.

247
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:20,824
Nothing like that would have
happened. He comes there sometimes

248
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:26,271
Sometimes gives opinions. Those who don't
like it might have felt insulted.

249
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:30,445
Is it not wrong to go there drunk?
I found liquor in his bag

250
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:36,054
He drinks, but I dont agree to u.
None of this hoohaah has happened.

251
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:42,813
It's purely a personal vendetta. He's fighting a case against
Kalamandiram committee for his job.

252
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:46,614
If u charge him for this now,
that case will get affected

253
00:26:46,794 --> 00:26:50,967
I hence request u
not to charge this

254
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:53,136
There hasn't been any written
complaint anyway

255
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:58,931
Before Secretary gets that idea, please
release him. Please show mercy for his future

256
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:04,449
Will he create more
problems in the future?

257
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:08,372
No Sir, We promise.
He's not that kind of a person.

258
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:12,204
Heh. Dont give such promises so easily. I
heard his history from other cops here.

259
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:16,825
Killed his wife. Case was cleared, but that
doesn't mean he hasn't killed..

260
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:21,025
No Sir, he can't kill anybody.
Sumangala was his life.

261
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:23,739
So that's why he burnt her 'alive' then.

262
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:29,828
Fine, I will release him. But any more problems,
and u 2 will get thrown into the cell.

263
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:34,575
As u please, Sir.
- Hmmm. Wait for a while

264
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:46,711
Wonderful to erase physical pains.

265
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:50,897
Physical pain..mental pain..
stupid excuses.

266
00:27:50,897 --> 00:27:54,738
Finish that bottle also.
May all your pains vanish

267
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:59,363
Wounds of the heart won't be healed by these.
Death is the solution for that.

268
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,707
Then why are u drinking?

269
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:08,033
For the high. Helps temporarily
numb the memories.

270
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:10,283
Comfortable Blackout.

271
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:17,027
Sometimes, an avalanche comes
at me. Like maleeswaran's arrow.

272
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:22,519
One when mounted. Ten when released.
Thousand when struck...

273
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,809
Thousands.

274
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:29,582
Why don't u go away from
here, teacher? Far away...

275
00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:32,734
Dancers will get a job
anywhere they go.

276
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:36,351
WHy do u have to run around
with this case here...

277
00:28:36,468 --> 00:28:41,664
Moreover, u are now in the
bad books of the society.

278
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,784
I know.

279
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:51,424
Criminal for many. 'Alcoholic.'
'Drug addict. Filthy.'

280
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:59,888
Nandu didn't become like that himself. She
made him that way. My Sumangala.

281
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:06,210
She's enjoying the fact that I've
become a joke. Well, let her enjoy..

282
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:32,460
Everything is a joke for her.

283
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,279
She is still with me all the time.

284
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,843
She doesn't like me leaving this
riverside and Kalamandiram.That's
why I wont leave this place.

285
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:46,015
His madness has begun again.
Gets high and blabbers. And that's
fodder for people to spread stories.

286
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:50,638
Let them say. U can say it
too. Nandu is mad.

287
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:53,233
But I saw her now, teacher..

288
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:57,435
This is not drug-induced hallucination...

289
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:00,426
U know about my work, teacher...

290
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:05,719
Sita-Ramayanam..She was always with
me when I wrote and composed it.

291
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:11,506
I just saw her now. Taunting me
for getting beaten by police.

292
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:15,503
Want to see? If I sing, she will
come and dance. I swear.

293
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:18,423
Bull shit. Enough. Come.
- No u carry on. Not me.

294
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,940
U are a bit too drunk today sir. Go home.
- Sir, a little time.

295
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:28,321
No! Now don't enrage me. Come.
We will get u a rickshaw

296
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:31,889
No its ok. I will walk this
way. U carry on

297
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:33,923
First you!

298
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,310
Ok, first me...

299
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:40,996
Sad...

300
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,911
Its all fate.
What heights he was to conquer...

301
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:49,420
Traveled throughout India.. have u seen
the work called Sita-Ramayanam, sir?

302
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,323
No, have heard of it.

303
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:57,380
It describes a Sita that Valmiki himself has not seen. He
has created, written and composed a new dance style.

304
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:03,094
But sadly, he has no luck. Nobody
here to understand or help.

305
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:05,714
Will he manage himself ?

306
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:09,484
Yea this is regular routine for him.
Dont worry about him.

307
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:12,770
'The night is made bright by the moonlight.
This temple has turned into paradise.'

308
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:23,413
'Why aren't u celebrating spring with me, my lover?'

309
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,787
Nandagopan seems to go crazy
when around your girl.

310
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:23,521
One day I saw him stop her in her
stride and tell her something.

311
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:29,324
Soma...he's the (Kichaka) villain in your story.
- Time for u to become the Bhima

312
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:35,092
He's mad. A good thumping should solve it. 
Cops must have whacked him good.

313
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:38,093
Malavika also has a bit too much of an ego.
Thinks she is Padma Subramaniam.

314
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:41,467
Well, she's the only one here with
the potential to reach that level

315
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:46,208
Oh really? What about our girls then ?

316
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:50,173
Teachers are praising Maalu just
because she is Principal's daughter.

317
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:54,564
Allowing her to perform a solo item at
the arangetram is also a part of ass-kissing.

318
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,610
No. that's usual custom. Good students
get to do solo performances.

319
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,110
That's for good students. Why Malavika?

320
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,060
Warden is coming

321
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:08,287
Oh, the 5 pandavas are in session ! What's the plot ?
'Panchali wedding'? Or 'Murder of Duryodhana'?

322
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:11,768
NO. Murder of Kichaka (Bhima's villain).

323
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:16,914
All of u must be in hostel by 6! If u sneak off to
the cinema, I'll complain to the secretary!

324
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:20,661
No, we won't go today! Today the new movie
releases. Secretary will be there for all 3 shows

325
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:22,146
Keep ur jokes to yourself

326
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:26,455
I know of your movie outings, in
pretence of going to brother's quarters.

327
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:30,098
IF I catch u red handed, I will
tonsure your mango head!

328
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:34,710
Hey, there comes your girl

329
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,321
Aha.. Maalu, where to?

330
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:38,959
Town.. for some cosmetics.

331
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:42,158
Oh, your debut is
coming up! Do well

332
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:47,548
Dude, accompany her.
She must be going downtown.

333
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:49,033
(teasing)

334
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,725
Maalu...off to town?
-Yes. Why?

335
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:00,861
I've some business there too.
- U don't need my permission to go there, do u?

336
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:05,030
I was waiting for u, when I heard you're going!
-Why? Scared to go alone, Soman?

337
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,342
Heh. Not that. Thought
I'll give u company

338
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:10,540
I don't need anyone's company.
I know to go alone

339
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,295
Why this hatred towards me?

340
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:14,828
Who said so?
I don't have any hatred.

341
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:19,025
If u mingle with these guys
and do nonsense, maybe I will.

342
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,641
Got an earful?

343
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:28,041
She bemoans me being in
your company, guys

344
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,831
Oh well. Look at him, 
'Harishchandra the Pure-hearted'.

345
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:32,790
I don't think all this hitting on her
is ever going to work.

346
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,064
I don't need to convince YOU guys!
She likes me. She hides it in her heart.

347
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:40,853
So u mean she cant 'express' well.
- You're all jealous.

348
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:44,128
Go wash your eyes, if they itch so much.

349
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:50,702
Guess we went overboard.
He is crazy about her.

350
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:03,919
Hello!

351
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,219
Welcome.

352
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,979
Nambeesan's daughter, right?
-Yes. She is also performing today.

353
00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:13,956
All the best, make it big!

354
00:40:14,016 --> 00:40:17,472
She is the best student here!
- Oh very good!

355
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:19,747
Let's go inside. Secretary is waiting.

356
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:23,574
Doesn't he have some political strike
or meeting to attend today ?

357
00:40:23,574 --> 00:40:25,251
I will go to the dance temple.

358
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,412
Okay. Do well.

359
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:33,167
One should be happy with
what one has. Greed is bad.

360
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:36,065
When u meet the minister,
make him understand.

361
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:39,212
People will say a lot of things.
Pay no heed.

362
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:41,606
So, as discussed. Bye.

363
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:44,942
Chairman has come.
He is in his room.

364
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,343
So?
Should I come and pray to him?

365
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:49,518
I saw everyone 'praying' to him.

366
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:53,340
I saw people welcome him
with garland and bouquet.

367
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,669
I come and do my job everyday,
but no one cares.

368
00:40:56,669 --> 00:41:03,108
If he is Actor Thikkrussy, I am the great
Velayudhan! I run this place! Understand that!

369
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:07,469
Just came to inform he's in his room.
- I heard that. Now go tell him I'm in this room!

370
00:41:10,238 --> 00:41:11,309
Sit sit...

371
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:13,648
Oh I just stood to flex my back.

372
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:18,541
I came here myself knowing
u must be 'busy'. Are u fine ?

373
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,135
Very fine.

374
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:25,086
Nambeesan, sit.
Unni sir, please sit..

375
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:32,429
I am not sitting.
Just 'not able to'.

376
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:35,653
Do u know the poor funding
scenario here, Chaiman?

377
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:38,215
These debut performances itself are
being funded by students.

378
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:42,866
We can discuss in next committee. We
have Unni sir and Nambeesan in the committee.

379
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:46,187
Conduct a paid 'Kathakali week' event.

380
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:49,356
Ha! We would have to pay
to get the audience too.

381
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:53,337
Aren't u an old film star? Why
dont we conduct a star night?

382
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:01,080
Mammooty, Mohanlal, Urvashi, Gita, (more actresses)...
with such stars, tickets will sell like hot cakes.

383
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,629
We can keep high rates too

384
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:08,974
We can think about it. Right now,
students' debut takes precedence.

385
00:42:09,537 --> 00:42:19,019
'Now, the pride of our school... 4th year prodigy student
Ms. Malavika's debut is next. Bharatanatyam: Padam

386
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:54,980
'HE danced the Dance of Joy'

387
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,279
'HE (Shiva) danced the Dance of Joy'.. on the stage

388
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:22,182
'His expressions, as loud as his drum...

389
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:31,594
...wake the Seven worlds from their slumber.'

390
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:39,011
Shiva danced the Dance of Joy

391
00:43:57,467 --> 00:44:01,743
Stop it! Damn!

392
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,509
Send him out! Kick him out!

393
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:26,218
Maalu, don't cry. It is ok.
- Why did u stop the dance, child ?

394
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,936
No teacher. No more. I cant
dance in front of them anymore

395
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,655
But your debut....

396
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:35,752
No, I dont want a debut anymore.

397
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:37,260
What the hell has he done, teacher!

398
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:43,548
So how did u like it? Your 'fantastic
artist' and his boos? Why are his
guardians and supporters silent?

399
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:45,595
Nothing to say ?

400
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:52,643
Teacher! Try to restart!

401
00:44:52,643 --> 00:44:54,993
Maalu is not allowing!

402
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:59,496
He has been kicked out. Audience is
calm. Please do the debut

403
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:02,780
Debut is over. It turned out
this way. SO be it.

404
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,999
Don't say like that...

405
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:05,956
Teacher, please try and
convince her.

406
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:09,226
Don't force her. Technically,
her debut is done.

407
00:45:10,896 --> 00:45:12,675
Don't worry child.

408
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,630
Its not your fault that
drunkard messed it up.

409
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,499
We all know his habits and character

410
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:26,019
Maalu, stop this, dont be adamant.
This tantrum is your loss. U lose your class.

411
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:29,437
My debut was spoilt.
What future do I have?

412
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:35,929
Debut is just a formality. It doesn't decide your future. Listen to me. Go, take a bath, and come to class.

413
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,598
Obey your guru, Maalu

414
00:45:38,598 --> 00:45:41,509
I thought u are stronger than this

415
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:43,536
Go get ready...

416
00:45:43,536 --> 00:45:46,433
We will leave only with you

417
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:55,849
Maalu..I had gone to your home

418
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:58,625
Your mom said u left

419
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:06,590
Heard u went to the
class in the afternoon

420
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,355
It's ok.. no harm will
come to your future.

421
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:12,902
I am so angry,
I would kill him!

422
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,158
Are u upset with me too, Maalu?

423
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:19,272
I am not upset with anyone.
I have some reading to do.

424
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:23,784
You're always like this towards me,
Maalu. U behave with no kindness.

425
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:27,173
Maalu, do u understand me?
- What's there to understand?

426
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:29,535
Don't pretend like u don't see it.

427
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:32,466
I've been chasing u for 2 - 3 years.

428
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:37,156
I haven't spoken my heart to
the fullest. A hesitation.

429
00:46:40,184 --> 00:46:42,365
I have written it all on this letter

430
00:46:42,473 --> 00:46:45,250
Was scared to post,
in case it reachs the wrong hands

431
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:47,009
What is it?
- Read it...

432
00:46:47,094 --> 00:46:49,862
I don't want all this!
- Please! Read it...

433
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:56,870
Take it and go. I will tell Dad.

434
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,133
Teacher!

435
00:47:05,357 --> 00:47:06,798
What's up..

436
00:47:06,798 --> 00:47:08,550
Well something is up, indeed!

437
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,648
Is he around, that little brother of yours??
- No

438
00:47:12,103 --> 00:47:13,968
He's in the hostel. Why?

439
00:47:14,302 --> 00:47:17,436
Is he old enough for this stuff?
Kids should be brought up in discipline!

440
00:47:17,436 --> 00:47:20,545
We might not match u in wealth,
but we have our esteem!

441
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:22,942
What IS it? Could u
be a bit clearer?

442
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:25,195
Here, understand for yourself.

443
00:47:33,445 --> 00:47:36,552
Dearest Maalu, whom I hold
more precious than myself...

444
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:44,104
This letter conveys feelings brewing deep within me,
which I held back from u a thousand times

445
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:45,751
I love you.....

446
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,959
more than did Romeo love Juliet...

447
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:50,221
more than did Krishna love Raadha...

448
00:47:50,221 --> 00:47:52,188
more than Shiva's love for Uma (Parvathi)

449
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:53,523
I love you....

450
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,827
If u do not return my love...

451
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:59,489
...it would be not returning my life.

452
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:02,125
I shall cease to be,
if u refuse to me..

453
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,912
Eagerly awaiting your reply...

454
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:07,265
With love, Soman

455
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,140
Read it? What say of
your brother now!

456
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:18,821
I didn't...find any problem

457
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:20,280
But it was Good poetry!

458
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,754
Keep that poetry away from my
daughter! Good poetry, he says !

459
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:26,477
Is this what a responsible
elder says?

460
00:48:26,477 --> 00:48:29,860
He's a male !
A man of 25 years.

461
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,913
All he did was decently tell his
love to a girl he has been after.

462
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:35,598
What is wrong?

463
00:48:35,598 --> 00:48:37,130
It will be my daughter
who will get defamed!

464
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,287
That is if something goes wrong

465
00:48:39,287 --> 00:48:41,936
Once he has settled down with a job..

466
00:48:41,936 --> 00:48:45,881
do u have any objection in giving Malavika's
hand in marriage to my little brother?

467
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:47,306
What did u say?

468
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:53,688
Once they reach the age for marriage,
do u mind marrying Maalu to Soman?

469
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:59,025
Are u serious, Sir? We do not have the
lacquer to polish her to match your fame

470
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:05,346
Nobody's asking for lacquer (dowry) here.
U know we, the Shaarath family,
doesn't need dowry to survive.

471
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:11,973
Well, true. What do I say!
If you're not kidding me, I would call myself lucky!

472
00:49:14,726 --> 00:49:15,963
Promise!

473
00:49:15,963 --> 00:49:19,446
We don't even have a house to
retire into after pension...

474
00:49:19,446 --> 00:49:23,557
There is enough ground here at Shaaratth.
Come over with your daughter!

475
00:49:23,557 --> 00:49:25,478
Teacher, did u have dinner?

476
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:28,687
What need to eat now?
I am satisfied! Filled!

477
00:49:28,687 --> 00:49:29,969
Hope u didn't get
upset about me scolding...

478
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:31,967
I would have been
upset if u hadn't

479
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:35,216
Then, this letter...do I take it...or...

480
00:49:35,216 --> 00:49:37,315
If Maalu wants, u can take it.

481
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:38,412
Else let it sit here..

482
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:42,566
Yes, better that it remains here. 
Tell the chap that there's no more need of letters and poetry.

483
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:47,781
I'm worried he will go
there and get into a brawl.

484
00:49:48,241 --> 00:49:50,424
Why did u give the letter to Dad?

485
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:52,439
What else? Reply to it??

486
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,750
Just tear it up! He's generally patient.
But once he loses temper, its bad.

487
00:50:06,638 --> 00:50:09,494
Why looking surprised??
- Well, you're not the same person who left in anger!

488
00:50:09,842 --> 00:50:10,816
Well, u know..

489
00:50:10,816 --> 00:50:15,113
When Kuchelan returned from Dwaraka with puffed rice,
his hut had transformed into a palace!

490
00:50:15,498 --> 00:50:17,579
Same story! RIght here!

491
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:21,762
Speak in a language I can understand
- Did I speak in English that u dont understand?

492
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,655
Have u been to Shaaratth?
Madhavan Unni sir's family home?

493
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:25,717
No

494
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:28,061
Ah! U should! U should! Grand is an understatement

495
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:33,219
Govinda Pisharody, Madhavan Unni's
grandfather, was the caretaker of the King of Kochi.

496
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:35,468
They're still equally prosperous now.

497
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:41,704
Unni Sir comes to Kalamandiram only out of his love for art,
not for the puny salary he gets from this job.

498
00:50:41,782 --> 00:50:43,658
What is with all this history?

499
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:45,405
Well, that...

500
00:50:45,405 --> 00:50:47,380
Go inside, dear.

501
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,641
The lord is always with us

502
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:53,385
He agreed to get our Maalu married to Somashekharan Unni..

503
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:56,829
He has given his word, until education is done with.

504
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:58,375
My god!

505
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:05,363
After retirement, he has asked to come over
to Shaarathh. How do u like God's games.

506
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:09,385
Well, keep a lid on it. Tell her too, not to talk to friends about it.
They're all jealous folks.

507
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,248
Sister-in-law.. why did u send for me urgently?

508
00:51:14,248 --> 00:51:15,575
Who said that?
- Big brother.

509
00:51:15,662 --> 00:51:19,291
Oh, that.. he has asked u to focus on studies.
- Oh, same old...

510
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:23,322
No, not same old. Serious, this time.
It seems your focus is on poetry now..

511
00:51:23,403 --> 00:51:24,547
Poetry?

512
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,478
"More than Romeo Juliet..."

513
00:51:27,478 --> 00:51:29,258
"More than Krishna and Radha"

514
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:31,356
"more than Shiva and Uma"

515
00:51:31,356 --> 00:51:33,614
Do love.. But not now, ok?

516
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:35,842
Oh damn...deep trouble.

517
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,440
U thought no one will know?

518
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:41,443
Big brother has warned u. Any more
nonsense, and he will break your bones

519
00:51:41,443 --> 00:51:43,706
Finish studies soon,
and get a decent job.

520
00:51:43,844 --> 00:51:46,303
Then he has agreed to get
you married. Got it?

521
00:51:48,537 --> 00:51:50,240
Is this a dream?...

522
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,304
Don't kill yourself if u don't
get that reply to the letter

523
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,882
Come inside. I'll make u a coffee.

524
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:26,873
No, thanks....

525
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:37,520
Sister-in-law.. Thank you

526
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:54,747
Hello.. Yes.. Nambeesan here..

527
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:57,227
Secretary has gone, sir.
The judgement will be in favor of us.

528
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:59,120
I have presented a Pal-payasam
in Guruvayur temple

529
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,266
Its a bigger court than the court.

530
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,179
I will ask the Secretary to
return your call, sir. Ok.

531
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:10,938
What are u doing here?

532
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,617
Chairman just called.

533
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:14,563
The verdict...for the case?

534
00:53:14,563 --> 00:53:15,689
Gopi (screwed)

535
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:17,661
Who's Gopi? I was asking
about Nandagopalan's case.

536
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:22,178
That's what.. screwed.
The court judged that he be allowed to return.

537
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:25,185
The Gods have deserted us!
- Not Gods, its u who deserted me.

538
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:28,124
U and that stupid
appraisal in the court!

539
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:30,281
He is a drunk idiot! Not an artist!

540
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:33,130
Else would he screw my daughter's debut?

541
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:38,102
Serves u right. Not just one debut.
he will screw this entire establishment

542
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:42,424
It is the fruit of my prayers and tears.

543
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:46,250
Atleast now, live well and don't
give society a chance to talk ill

544
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,087
Why the dull face still?

545
00:53:48,087 --> 00:53:51,973
That's what I was born with.
Can't get a new face

546
00:53:52,123 --> 00:53:57,152
Well, your wish has come true.
Still unhappy?

547
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:04,744
No. When I was banished from
the world of dance and rhythm and art...

548
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,613
I was like a fish out of water..

549
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:12,847
But now, it's like I fought
my shadow and won.

550
00:54:13,065 --> 00:54:16,341
who won?.... who lost?...

551
00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:18,579
who knows...

552
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:24,660
What did he mean?

553
00:54:24,814 --> 00:54:26,443
I also didn't get it

554
00:54:26,443 --> 00:54:28,937
Will he resume work from tomorrow?

555
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:36,246
Sir...

556
00:54:38,036 --> 00:54:40,105
I have come to rejoin

557
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:42,094
Do that at the office

558
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:43,527
Who invited u here?

559
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,433
"My room"? Your room's at your house..

560
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:48,138
This is a public servant's room

561
00:54:48,138 --> 00:54:51,283
Stop arguing and mind your own business!

562
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:53,556
But.. a small score...to settle..before that

563
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,194
Once I sign into the attendance register,
it would go unsettled.

564
00:54:56,194 --> 00:54:57,915
Score? What score?

565
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,161
That's it. Settled.

566
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:10,097
Now my grudge for u is quenched. One
I harbored after u set the cops on me.

567
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,077
Now I can join with a pure untainted mind

568
00:55:19,301 --> 00:55:26,631
Shall we keep this secret to ourselves?
It would be embarassing for not me.. but...

569
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:38,738
Which classroom do I go to?

570
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:40,997
I don't know. We will have to think on it!

571
00:55:40,997 --> 00:55:43,625
The children are refusing to enter classroom!
- What?

572
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,970
Everyone has assembled at the auditorium
- Why?

573
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,867
In protest it seems
- Protest? There has never been one here!

574
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:50,725
Both girls and boys...

575
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:52,297
It looks like trouble, sir..

576
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:54,294
What's the problem?
- U are the problem.

577
00:55:54,787 --> 00:55:59,269
Me?
- They want a public apology from u.

578
00:56:00,251 --> 00:56:05,165
Apology for what?
- Dont remember? U came in drunk
and spoilt a student's debut.

579
00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:07,381
They don't want such a person here

580
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:11,321
Oh, is that the matter? I will apologize.

581
00:56:11,321 --> 00:56:16,053
'We're not ready to accept such a person with
bad habits as a teacher! We dont care about
court or committee here'

582
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:20,277
He should publically apologize! Or resign!

583
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:22,313
No classes till then!

584
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,734
'Nandagopan Apologize!!"

585
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:29,909
"Apologize or resign!"

586
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:32,475
"Nandagopan apologize!"

587
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:35,352
"Apologize or resign!"

588
00:56:53,573 --> 00:56:55,282
I will apologize...

589
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:56,264
I will!

590
00:57:00,446 --> 00:57:02,947
I will apologize!

591
00:57:03,727 --> 00:57:06,367
Before that... I need to say something..

592
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:10,103
Don't say anything! Just apologize for
spoiling an artist's performance!

593
00:57:10,103 --> 00:57:12,244
Before that, I have some questions!

594
00:57:12,244 --> 00:57:13,563
Go ahead!

595
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:16,727
What qualifications do
you have for a guru?

596
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:22,609
Teacher should be a master of mudras (gestures) like
'Fish', 'Turtle', 'Bee'...say the Laws of dance by Sage Bharata.

597
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:26,358
Child... Laws are just prefaces.

598
00:57:26,919 --> 00:57:28,887
Art supersedes them.

599
00:57:29,007 --> 00:57:33,895
That's an excuse by those who don't know laws. I
performed according to Bharata's laws of dance.

600
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,018
U won't understand it.

601
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:41,795
Regular audience doesn't ask about
the rules, they try to savor the feel

602
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:48,746
Is insulting me your way of savoring the
performance ? For what grudge did u spoil my debut ?

603
00:57:48,746 --> 00:57:53,348
When the one they introduced as 'The Great dancer'
messed up the dance, I howled!

604
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:57,700
In a single howl, u lost your concentration,
composure! U lost your rhythm...

605
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,902
U are not yet ready for a debut.

606
00:58:02,072 --> 00:58:05,083
That howl should first
reach your teachers!

607
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:09,781
What do YOU know about bharathanatyam?

608
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:12,152
What is 'technically' wrong
in what she danced?

609
00:58:12,152 --> 00:58:17,731
U propped up a puppet dance!
Malavika the puppet, dancing according to 'rules'.

610
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:23,344
Any robot can do Bharatanatyam
if tuned. That is not art.

611
00:58:23,344 --> 00:58:25,516
Art is a mix of senses...

612
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:29,635
Dance...Dance forms..emotions..expressions.
Dance is an exhibition of these!

613
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:35,260
Bhaavanaanubhatvam (experience of emotions). So u
need emotions, and u must experience them!

614
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:39,004
U should devote mind and body.
Only then it would have charm.

615
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:52,811
&lt;Sanskrit phrase&gt;. These are also rules.
The definition of drama of dance, by Nandikesan.

616
00:58:52,811 --> 00:59:02,001
Eye follows the hand. The heart follows the eye.
Expressions follows the heart.
And expressions generate the Entertainment.

617
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:08,424
'Ananda nadanam aadinan'. The lyrics say:
"He danced with joy..". Not "I danced.."

618
00:59:08,424 --> 00:59:12,950
Him...Nataraja (Shiva). The poem
says Nataraja dances in joy

619
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:17,494
Yes, it was Sri Parameswara who danced. 
What she danced was also Thaandavam (Shiva's dance)!

620
00:59:17,494 --> 00:59:20,751
That is where your
textual reasoning also fails.

621
00:59:20,751 --> 00:59:26,241
Thum nrutyam thaandavam praahu
Sthree nrutyam laasya mucchyathe

622
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:29,203
From Bharata's Natyashastra
(rules of dance)

623
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:33,281
Thandavam is for the male. The woman must constrain
to tenderness..gracious romance

624
00:59:33,661 --> 00:59:37,075
It is HIM who danced, not I...

625
00:59:38,065 --> 00:59:43,030
Then it is THIRD person narrating. Narrator
could be Uma, or maybe the dancer herself

626
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,571
Will it be correct if u dance Thandavam for that?

627
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:50,626
Even if that's correct, should u be doing a 'Regular dance',
or a Thandavam (Rigorous dance) in Joy?

628
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:52,868
What is the state of that happiness?

629
00:59:52,868 --> 00:59:54,034
of devotion?

630
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:55,343
of love?

631
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:56,937
of surprise or wonder?

632
00:59:56,937 --> 00:59:58,813
you must understand that!

633
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:02,437
for every expression or feel,
the danceform should be vivid and specific!

634
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:09,424
whatever be the text u follow...any scripture it be! 
Natyashastra, Abhinaydarpan, Abhinayachandrika, Nritaratnavali

635
01:00:09,424 --> 01:00:17,911
in form, be it Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi, Mohiniyattam,
Bhangra, Odissi, Manipuri, Kathak, folk...anything

636
01:00:17,911 --> 01:00:20,971
The dancer must create entertainment
out of her expressiveness.

637
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:26,178
Dancer..is not someone who jumps
on the beat.. she is an interpreter.

638
01:00:26,178 --> 01:00:29,993
you can lecture.. but can u 'interpret'?

639
01:00:30,643 --> 01:00:36,046
I shall try. For 7 years, dance has
only been in my heart. I lack practise.

640
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,932
Kindly forgive that shortcoming.

641
01:01:20,392 --> 01:01:35,812
'He danced the dance of joy'

642
01:07:05,164 --> 01:07:07,064
I shall apologize

643
01:07:08,636 --> 01:07:10,286
I shall apologize

644
01:07:29,452 --> 01:07:32,349
This is for the first time in the
history of this establishment!

645
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:34,911
This is a school running
on teachers' heritage!

646
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:38,276
Did u join it to learn art, or to
protest and become a politician??

647
01:07:38,276 --> 01:07:41,714
Had u not been a member
here, one tight slap was a given!

648
01:07:41,714 --> 01:07:43,751
It was Maalu's issue.. that
is why I interfered..

649
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:47,673
Her father is there for that! U need
not become her guardian now! Save it for later!

650
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:50,577
You're not married, to act the guardian!

651
01:07:50,577 --> 01:07:54,659
Enough scolding him. Kids make mistakes.
It won't happen again..

652
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,984
I have kept water in the bathroom.
Get fresh, then we can dine.

653
01:08:02,606 --> 01:08:05,567
Why did u come home today?
Do I need to tell u he will be angry?

654
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:09,528
I too have a temper! Should I not
be angry when it is about Maalu?

655
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:12,817
Leave alone protest, if needed,
I can even beat him up.

656
01:08:12,817 --> 01:08:15,717
Well, finally who got embarrassed?
I heard all about it.

657
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:19,975
Well...uh...he is a very good
performer... Can't deny that.

658
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:23,978
Anyway, Maalu is happy at my 'performance'. I'm satisfied.
- I will tell this to ur bro.

659
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:27,747
For God's sake,no, I'm outta here !
- Leave after dinner. There's nice avial curry.

660
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:33,850
Spare me. At dinner, I'd have to see rest of the Drama.
I'll manage with sambhar at hostel.

661
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:44,975
&lt;A Krishna song&gt;

662
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:16,118
Why is Malavika Nangiar playing
hide-and-seek ?

663
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,598
Is it part of the laws of dance?

664
01:09:20,348 --> 01:09:22,228
I request thee, come forth!

665
01:09:25,635 --> 01:09:27,145
You, please step back

666
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:30,388
The queens of dance must
never be left behind

667
01:09:32,595 --> 01:09:34,075
Let's try it once more

668
01:09:45,468 --> 01:09:49,008
Stop. Why is your face like &lt;this&gt; ?

669
01:09:49,497 --> 01:09:53,698
Trying to scare me with your acting?
Or is it some law I dont know?

670
01:09:55,188 --> 01:10:01,758
In this dance u must express divine romance.
Not kindness. Romance is also a state of 'Joy'.

671
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:04,773
Does the star of Kalamandiram understand ?

672
01:10:07,918 --> 01:10:12,418
What, child. Stand up please.
Please make her stand.

673
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:17,708
Take her

674
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:24,820
Pity. I wonder why that kid cried?

675
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,580
Because u taunted her, sir ?

676
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:33,828
Really? Then its ok. Your friend has horns of excessive pride.
They must be broken, or she will become a nobody.

677
01:10:33,828 --> 01:10:35,731
Can I ask u something sir ?
- Yes

678
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,888
U boo-ed Malavika's debut, but spared us. Why ?

679
01:10:38,888 --> 01:10:47,628
Many reasons.U debuted as 'normal' students.
Your mistakes may be forgiven.
But she was presented as 'Pride of Kalamandiram'.

680
01:10:47,628 --> 01:10:55,358
'The pride' must maintain the required standard.
So thats one. Moreover, everyone is spoiling
her with excessive praise.

681
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:05,550
She possesses some good dancer instincts. I see a good career in
store for her, and dont want to see it derail. So I howled.

682
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,790
And partly, it was my rudeness.

683
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:14,970
Many reasons like that. A dancer's
tears have fallen here. Let's end today's class for now.

684
01:11:21,608 --> 01:11:23,813
Dad sat for dinner. Calling u.

685
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,129
I am not hungry.

686
01:11:25,129 --> 01:11:28,602
Dad scolded u for doing
arrogant things with students..

687
01:11:28,602 --> 01:11:30,117
Not because of that...

688
01:11:30,117 --> 01:11:34,503
Then? Worrying about what
he said? That is his method.

689
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:37,214
U just learn according to your teachers.

690
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,959
What He said is correct.

691
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:40,201
What did she say?

692
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:42,238
She feels Nandagopan was right.

693
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:44,482
Oh, the tides! have changed?

694
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:48,047
What I learnt and practised for
3 years... is not dance at all..

695
01:11:48,047 --> 01:11:51,922
Dear... no one can learn anything in
3 years. Can only build a foundation

696
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:55,917
If his methods are right, they will be
taught. That is why he is back

697
01:11:56,241 --> 01:11:59,554
This is like some proverb.
Baaah. Am famished. Are u coming?

698
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:03,679
Go dear. If u don't sit, that is not dinner for him

699
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,702
At least give company.

700
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:43,425
What are u looking at?

701
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:48,532
Those eyes.. that nose.. that beard..

702
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:53,059
Sir...

703
01:12:55,229 --> 01:12:56,499
Were u asleep?

704
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,171
Uh, no, was just resting.

705
01:12:59,171 --> 01:13:00,921
So u still drink, eh?

706
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:03,798
It's a habit now, well

707
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:07,107
No one uses this arena now.
Earlier this was sir's favorite arena.

708
01:13:07,107 --> 01:13:11,538
This was his favorite arena for teaching.
He'd sit here with wife in the evenings...

709
01:13:11,538 --> 01:13:13,921
Sir, did u come looking for me or?...

710
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:16,150
Yes.. I got news u are here..
- What is the matter?

711
01:13:16,227 --> 01:13:17,380
Come inside.

712
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,454
She's my daughter..

713
01:13:21,295 --> 01:13:25,474
I know. She didn't come to class today.
Have u decided not to come to my class?

714
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:28,140
NO, she is dejected.

715
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:32,038
Oh, I went overboard yesterday with the
teasing. Wont happen again. u can go.

716
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:34,968
Oh no no! Not here for a complaint.

717
01:13:35,008 --> 01:13:36,098
Go ahead, dear.

718
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,783
I am sorry... Please forgive me.

719
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,454
For? U are the one who has to forgive me.

720
01:13:46,197 --> 01:13:47,502
Please don't say that.

721
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:51,800
I heard what u told my friends about me.

722
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,832
I have been arrogant due to ignorance

723
01:13:54,832 --> 01:13:56,415
Please forgive me.

724
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:58,895
I will accept any punishment happily

725
01:13:58,895 --> 01:14:00,836
punishment? for what?

726
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,917
Both her and I, have done some wrongs.

727
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:06,335
She says it's only now
she has found a wise guru.

728
01:14:06,335 --> 01:14:08,204
Please receive a
dakshina (fee) and bless her

729
01:14:08,204 --> 01:14:13,002
Me ?? Oh, no! Heh, that's not required..

730
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:16,015
I will teach what little I know

731
01:14:16,015 --> 01:14:18,350
if time permits...

732
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:21,565
What u see outside is all there is..

733
01:14:21,565 --> 01:14:24,299
the insides are burning away to ashes

734
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:26,733
I do not have another guru anymore..

735
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:27,863
Please accept this.

736
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,524
I do not need any of this

737
01:14:29,524 --> 01:14:32,610
I don't have qualifications to be a guru

738
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:36,663
Low on wisdom...don't know to
implement properly what little is known

739
01:14:36,663 --> 01:14:38,858
As for character.. u
already know about it..

740
01:14:38,976 --> 01:14:41,582
please don't push me away with all these.

741
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:43,953
Please accept it and bless me.

742
01:14:49,874 --> 01:14:53,184
She's the only child I have.
Maybe I spoilt her a bit.

743
01:15:37,645 --> 01:15:47,445
Your moves and technique are good.
The expressions must be improved.
They must come subconsciously.

744
01:15:49,156 --> 01:15:54,398
Let the body and face be rich with emotion..
like land made fertile with water and manure.

745
01:15:54,398 --> 01:16:01,101
A face like a blossomed lotus is not enough
- it must express all 9 forms of expressions like a mirror.
U need practise for it.

746
01:16:01,101 --> 01:16:02,081
Tea

747
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,294
Do u want ?
- No

748
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:05,961
I brought only one black tea

749
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:14,382
What black tea? I asked for the liquor.

750
01:16:14,402 --> 01:16:17,782
It IS liquor. I mixed in black tea to fool them.

751
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,941
U have spoilt it. Who cares if they know.
hope u didn't add sugar as well.

752
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:21,981
I'm not that dumb

753
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:27,201
Not comforting enough. Got a bottle?

754
01:16:27,266 --> 01:16:29,491
Left the bottle at shop
- Liar

755
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:31,721
No really, I didnt take.
- Then whats this?

756
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:37,471
Dont go drunk with this.
- A man needs his drink

757
01:16:44,751 --> 01:16:47,641
Enough !
- u can leave

758
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:50,721
And that bottle?
- ..will stay here.

759
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:13,251
Forgive me. I dont have the right to
advice, but its my duty as a student

760
01:17:13,314 --> 01:17:15,104
Why dont u stop this ?
- What ?

761
01:17:15,145 --> 01:17:20,065
I saw it
- The principal's daughter can keep
her authority to herself.

762
01:17:20,065 --> 01:17:25,035
Remain a student. Just cause I accepted your fee,
doesn't mean u get authority.

763
01:17:39,677 --> 01:17:41,587
What do I do about this?

764
01:17:41,986 --> 01:17:43,487
I can give a memo..

765
01:17:43,487 --> 01:17:45,624
I can't stop him from teaching.

766
01:17:45,624 --> 01:17:47,568
He has come with court order.

767
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:51,264
I can't strictly tell him not to drink.

768
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:53,698
Can't u say, Sir?

769
01:17:53,838 --> 01:18:00,234
I can,...but... he has a bad character...
cheap fellow..

770
01:18:00,234 --> 01:18:01,807
He might do something rash

771
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:04,779
are u scared of him, Sir?
- Scared?? No no

772
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:08,113
Ha.. Velayudhan does not get 'scared'

773
01:18:08,113 --> 01:18:10,770
If I decide once,that's it!

774
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:14,079
but right now, it is better to stall that decision

775
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:16,593
Sir, our school's name..

776
01:18:16,593 --> 01:18:20,499
Will this fame rise by my actions alone?
U people should also cooperate..

777
01:18:20,919 --> 01:18:23,595
I will give an idea.. A plan.

778
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:26,833
No one outside should know that
I am the one pulling the strings.

779
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:30,054
But one of u should be ready for that.

780
01:18:30,054 --> 01:18:34,240
U are a good choice, teacher.
Right age, and beautiful..

781
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,466
single as well

782
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:38,587
Sir, flirtatious as usual.

783
01:18:39,983 --> 01:18:46,376
I once destroyed a minister's career
with this character assassination.
Needs meticulous planning, I can do that.

784
01:18:46,716 --> 01:18:50,072
What is it ?
- Rape attempt

785
01:18:50,566 --> 01:18:54,451
'Drunk Nandagopan gropes
Rama Devi teacher'

786
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:58,145
Devi cries, shouts,all of
us run to help...

787
01:18:58,145 --> 01:19:02,244
find him accused... on the spot,
I will get him suspended.

788
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:04,769
oh god, I can't do all that.

789
01:19:04,769 --> 01:19:07,206
oh, its just an act.

790
01:19:07,696 --> 01:19:10,215
uh, u don't like the scheme?

791
01:19:10,215 --> 01:19:13,217
Sir, can cultured people
think of all this?

792
01:19:13,217 --> 01:19:16,063
We don't want him
suspended or dismissed ...

793
01:19:16,063 --> 01:19:18,427
He shouldn't drink in school

794
01:19:18,427 --> 01:19:20,548
He shouldn't degrade our name

795
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:35,047
I heard everything... your 'scheme'

796
01:19:35,047 --> 01:19:37,196
Wonderful, Sir. Please sit..

797
01:19:37,286 --> 01:19:40,017
We can talk of it later...

798
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:44,520
I came to say that I wish to
take my classes outdoors..

799
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:49,876
There is shade, breeze and sunlight. Kids won't
get bored by the monotony of a classroom

800
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,026
Principal has agreed. he asked to inform you

801
01:19:52,026 --> 01:19:53,266
he told to just inform you

802
01:19:53,266 --> 01:19:56,895
why tell me? u are doing all
that u wish, right? So be it

803
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:59,040
Well, i am going to do what I wish then.

804
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,047
Huh!Why close the door?

805
01:20:04,047 --> 01:20:09,721
Don't shout! I will close your book
right away! So u want to set me up ?

806
01:20:09,816 --> 01:20:16,198
If u use your political schemes against
an artist, I will pull out those eyes!

807
01:20:16,267 --> 01:20:17,768
Heh, don't do unnecessary
things, Nandagopala

808
01:20:17,768 --> 01:20:20,453
Will u try such stuff in the future?
- No

809
01:20:20,453 --> 01:20:21,752
Promise me!
- Promise

810
01:20:21,785 --> 01:20:23,293
God promise!?!
- God Promise, I won't!

811
01:20:23,293 --> 01:20:28,516
If I get a memo in this regard...
I will mug u in the night and whack u up!

812
01:20:28,516 --> 01:20:31,205
Oh, no no.
What's the need for all that trouble...

813
01:20:31,205 --> 01:20:32,933
Sit there!

814
01:20:33,683 --> 01:20:36,213
This is the chair of the topmost person here..

815
01:20:36,213 --> 01:20:38,298
Don't defame it. Understood ?

816
01:20:39,593 --> 01:20:40,914
See u.

817
01:20:53,005 --> 01:20:55,008
Nothing!

818
01:21:03,069 --> 01:21:05,036
Not going out today, sir ?

819
01:21:05,036 --> 01:21:08,638
Hi Sir. I had performances last 2 days.
- Sleep deprived, eh.

820
01:21:08,638 --> 01:21:13,344
Please sit.
- Did u hear the news?

821
01:21:13,344 --> 01:21:20,073
No
- Our secretary, Velayudhan (trickster)
has taken 3 months medical leave

822
01:21:20,073 --> 01:21:24,588
What, disease ?
- Nothing much. Leprosy. In his mind.

823
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:28,667
Only stated 'due to medical reasons'.
He will produce medical certificate later.

824
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:34,155
Handed over charge to suprintendent,
did not inform anybody. Now this place will prosper.

825
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,334
How is Nandagopan sir?

826
01:21:36,334 --> 01:21:43,494
Smart and well. Drinks a bit too much.
But they say art mixes well with alcohol.
Teachers here are proof.

827
01:21:44,754 --> 01:21:51,831
By the way, on Maalu's request, I did 1 thing.
Asked her to give teacher's fee to Nandagopan.
Hope u wont mind ?

828
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:57,557
Why should I mind? Well done. He is very knowledgable.

829
01:21:57,777 --> 01:21:59,118
Smartest one in this region.

830
01:22:01,238 --> 01:22:05,715
Other teachers are envious.
Anyway, do tell 'our artist' also.

831
01:22:06,585 --> 01:22:10,315
Who?
Somasekharan, who else.
He should not feel bad.

832
01:22:16,422 --> 01:22:21,092
No class today?
- We had. Not in the class, but
outdoors under the banyan tree.

833
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:25,965
Oh, new reforms. Heard u paid fee
and prostrated before ur guru.
- Yes

834
01:22:25,965 --> 01:22:32,166
Plan to take personal home classes?
- Maybe. Not just home, anywhere he calls.

835
01:22:33,336 --> 01:22:36,890
U couldve told me.
I wouldnt prevent it.

836
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:43,264
I dont lack artistic sense.
I too wish for u to become a great artist.

837
01:22:46,205 --> 01:22:51,964
I respect Nandagopan as an artist. Be wary of the drinking
- Why should we concern ourselves with that?

838
01:22:52,814 --> 01:22:57,499
All we need to worry about is whether he is skilled.
- True. But in ur case, dont I need to be cautious.

839
01:22:58,759 --> 01:23:00,786
I'm going. They're waiting.

840
01:23:05,104 --> 01:23:09,723
Let her know we guard her.
- Ur show-off makes me laugh.

841
01:23:11,628 --> 01:23:12,971
What's he cribbing ?

842
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:17,311
That I should've told him before paying guru fee.
That obligation is unnecessary now before wedding. Chauvinist.

843
01:23:17,311 --> 01:23:20,450
U take too much freedom with guru.
- What did I do ?

844
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:24,040
Just felt so. Dont entertain
unnecessary thoughts.

845
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:32,507
'Come to me, be generous
in your love, my hero.'

846
01:23:36,171 --> 01:23:40,420
The body must have fluid grace
in overall movement.

847
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,233
Mohiniyattam is the dance of romance.

848
01:23:44,543 --> 01:23:48,380
And romance.. the zenith of all emotions.

849
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:56,018
Convey love. ''Come to me, be generous
in your love, my hero.''

850
01:23:56,968 --> 01:24:04,679
The heroine requests: Come forth with wide, unselfish love.
Malavika, do u follow ?

851
01:24:05,929 --> 01:24:09,708
Yes
- But ur mind is not here.

852
01:24:12,898 --> 01:24:15,093
Shall we try?

853
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:47,610
'Come to me, be generous
in your love, my hero.'

854
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:11,935
May the romance flowing through
this moonlight night, be fulfilled.

855
01:25:14,181 --> 01:25:20,154
'Come to me, be generous
in your love, my hero.'

856
01:30:00,207 --> 01:30:09,292
Come to me, be generous
in your love, my hero.

857
01:30:10,467 --> 01:30:20,588
May the romance flowing through
this moonlight night be fulfilled

858
01:30:36,591 --> 01:30:38,824
What world are u in?

859
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:51,511
Must admit, he's quite a fellow.
What voice, what style.

860
01:30:52,471 --> 01:30:57,490
That's the grandeur of the song and tune. Not his skill.
- Ya right.

861
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,767
What's this?
-Leave letter.

862
01:31:08,767 --> 01:31:16,561
Why are u submitting leave letter?
-Not mine. Nandhu's. He left for travel in
the morning. Asked me to hand this to u.

863
01:31:19,731 --> 01:31:22,316
So who will teach today?
- Shall I?

864
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:25,941
U? Its not tea-making, but dancing.

865
01:31:25,941 --> 01:31:27,931
I asked shall I leave to my shop.

866
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:37,494
U run any other business than tea?
- Yes. I sing. Learnt Kathakali songs.

867
01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:44,088
I hear those everyday.I dont mean
that.Do u peddle alcohol along with tea?

868
01:31:44,088 --> 01:31:46,028
Allah! How ridiculous!

869
01:31:46,138 --> 01:31:53,187
Dont use ur Kathakali tactics at me.If i hear of it,
I'll get u and ur shop shut up and beaten by cops.

870
01:31:54,237 --> 01:32:00,855
Beat up this body?Mercy! Kathakali is beyond me,
let me try survive with my tea atleast.

871
01:32:00,855 --> 01:32:03,259
Beware. I have received complaints.

872
01:32:32,843 --> 01:32:34,451
Sir

873
01:32:50,821 --> 01:32:55,637
I'm going to Krishna temple across the river.
Got scared seeing u sprawled across here.

874
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:58,468
Did u think I was finished?

875
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:05,175
Child,u better go.Temple will close.

876
01:33:06,465 --> 01:33:08,041
Is this why u took leave?

877
01:33:11,371 --> 01:33:14,163
Started in the morning.

878
01:33:15,333 --> 01:33:20,682
Drank up,smoked up,
yet my mind has no peace.

879
01:33:23,532 --> 01:33:26,313
This day is that great,u wouldnt know.

880
01:33:29,803 --> 01:33:37,270
U'd hate me if I told u,
and demand ur fee back.

881
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:46,400
But ure smart.
-Shall I ask Dad to take u home.

882
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:54,023
No.Wont go anywhere today

883
01:33:58,063 --> 01:34:03,803
Today's the 8th anniversary of my murder of my Suma.

884
01:34:07,554 --> 01:34:17,364
Court released me.
But I'm a prisoner of my mind's jail. Serving time.

885
01:34:20,644 --> 01:34:26,616
I dont understand u.
Earlier I thought u were a murderer,
but now I refuse to believe it

886
01:34:27,736 --> 01:34:32,482
An artist cannot destroy.Cannot kill

887
01:34:33,712 --> 01:34:37,307
I'm no artist.Just showing off.

888
01:34:41,647 --> 01:34:46,700
It was I who killed Suma.
She was a naive creature

889
01:34:49,260 --> 01:35:00,209
Naive as a white rabbit.She's my cousin.
She lost her mom at a young age.

890
01:35:03,879 --> 01:35:09,013
Her dad drank himself to death.
Like I'm doing.

891
01:35:09,653 --> 01:35:16,484
I'm just ranting.U should leave
- No,I wont.Tell me what happened

892
01:35:17,734 --> 01:35:29,344
Well, she was orphaned.My mom
brought her home after she was orphaned.
Thought she'd be able to help at home.

893
01:35:31,354 --> 01:35:38,573
Basically,a glorified servant.But we enrolled
her in Kalamandiram so she wouldnt feel that.

894
01:35:39,573 --> 01:35:45,809
I had a job back then.
She was 16, a frail girl.

895
01:35:49,459 --> 01:35:54,322
Then she ate up and
fattened up.Such a foodie.

896
01:35:56,562 --> 01:36:02,440
Dad told me she danced well.
- She is a lazy-bum.

897
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:17,571
I composed Sita-Ramayanam for her.
Perfected it in this arena

898
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:29,470
Her very hand movement was a mudra.
Face - blossomed lotus.Eyes - oceans.

899
01:37:12,681 --> 01:37:15,775
Why'd u stop?
-Enough.I'm tired.

900
01:37:16,065 --> 01:37:20,541
And what about me,singing all this time?
-That's easy.I'm the one hopping around here.

901
01:37:21,441 --> 01:37:25,915
Enough.Lets continue tomorrow.
If we reach home early,we get early dinner.I'm so hungry!

902
01:37:27,065 --> 01:37:33,177
Ur 6 meals a day is making u fat.
-And u must be the slim beauty here?

903
01:37:33,497 --> 01:37:36,645
U hog plenty urself.
Why cant I eat if I want to?

904
01:37:37,335 --> 01:37:42,138
U're a dancer.Shouldnt be too slim or fat.
The dance laws define this to be dancer traits.

905
01:37:42,228 --> 01:37:45,411
Chauvinists. Those lawmakers
never knew hunger it seems.

906
01:37:45,411 --> 01:37:50,971
Let me be clear.If u're presenting my heroine,
u must be slim.The actor must meet Sita's features.

907
01:37:51,221 --> 01:37:55,884
Not just ur dance,but u must
fit the role well for the act to be good.

908
01:37:56,264 --> 01:38:02,555
U must look like a hermit.This is not conventional Sita.
This is Sita reflecting Ramayana from her perspective.

909
01:38:02,985 --> 01:38:06,497
I never asked Sita to reflect.
And wont go hungry for her sake.

910
01:38:06,937 --> 01:38:11,638
Then what good are u? I'll get someone else to do it
-Sure,I dont care.

911
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:22,762
Dont go alone,take this.
I shall marry u off to a chef.Then u can eat all u want

912
01:38:25,122 --> 01:38:31,009
Think of good ideas like that.Instead of Sita's
perspective and Ravana's and Hanuman's..

913
01:38:36,509 --> 01:38:41,255
The bed is ready.Sleep if u want.
-Why did u do it.She prepares my bed generally,right?

914
01:38:42,145 --> 01:38:45,229
She has too many chores to finish.

915
01:38:49,044 --> 01:38:52,044
She can do it after those chores.
Now she'll be upset again.

916
01:38:52,689 --> 01:38:56,724
U know her.
-She has no siblings.

917
01:38:56,724 --> 01:38:58,884
But she has us.

918
01:39:00,084 --> 01:39:04,286
The broker had come.
-With a new list or same old?

919
01:39:04,286 --> 01:39:10,833
He bluffs too much.Golden face,pretty eyes..blah blah.
More metaphors than Wordsworth.

920
01:39:10,913 --> 01:39:15,645
And then the girl turns out to be unimpressive.
-But this girl looks good.
He has given me a photo.

921
01:39:17,167 --> 01:39:23,885
She has learnt dance
-No need. 2 artists must never wed,
especially if they're the same field.

922
01:39:24,855 --> 01:39:28,821
And who would handle house matters?
And there would be ego issues. Nah,drop it.

923
01:39:29,361 --> 01:39:34,096
She only learnt in childhood.
She's a schoolteacher from a nice family.

924
01:39:34,276 --> 01:39:38,889
I'll marry her if u want.
-Dont speak like girls.Did u like the photo?

925
01:39:39,659 --> 01:39:51,896
No.But I liked the person.
-Do u like her? The broker also said
there's a guy interested in Suma.

926
01:39:56,886 --> 01:40:02,308
He enquired what dowry we can give.
-We can give what we can.But we cannot
end her education.She has a good future.

927
01:40:05,148 --> 01:40:11,085
Yes. The guy is nice and handsome.
-I dont want.If u think I'm a burden to u,I'd rather suicide

928
01:40:13,015 --> 01:40:16,897
God, why does she always speak of death like this.

929
01:40:22,936 --> 01:40:25,846
U can ask her name
-I know it already

930
01:40:26,126 --> 01:40:33,789
Yes,but do talk.So that u'll know if she stammers or something.
-I dont doubt a teacher can speak.

931
01:40:35,089 --> 01:40:41,568
Maya,go in.So lets have coffee and discuss.
-Sure

932
01:40:41,968 --> 01:40:49,245
Thank goodness,finally u like one.Let's finalize today.
-Yes,that's why I've come.

933
01:40:57,055 --> 01:41:00,621
Where did Mom and Suma go?
-Maybe temple

934
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:07,244
Nandhu,Suma has screwed up.
-What?

935
01:41:07,384 --> 01:41:10,795
Drank the pesticide

936
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:16,725
They've taken her to hospital.Thankfully someone
spotted her. She was unconscious.

937
01:41:25,068 --> 01:41:29,809
Why did she do this, Mother ?
-Everyone please go out

938
01:41:30,769 --> 01:41:33,010
How is she?
-Not sure yet.

939
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:39,099
Lady,please go out.
-Come,Mom.

940
01:41:48,214 --> 01:41:53,972
Did u scold her?Why did she do this?
- Why, Mom?

941
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,705
She had written this letter.

942
01:42:05,415 --> 01:42:16,565
Nandu, U are mine.I cant bear u being someone
else's.Neither u nor mom understood me.

943
01:42:16,565 --> 01:42:24,518
I wont ask what I dont deserve.
And cant bear to see u being with another.

944
01:42:24,518 --> 01:42:28,553
Sorry.I will await u in another world.

945
01:42:56,796 --> 01:43:02,284
I saw u like a sister.Was this what u wanted?

946
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:22,442
From the deathbed,she returned. Into my life.
Complaints, impulsive mood swings, fiery bouts of happiness.

947
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:29,130
One year. She gave me a lifetime of joy
in one year.

948
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:33,889
I too have reciprocated
that love unselfishly.

949
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:39,808
But she never agrees.
She felt I was miserly in love.

950
01:44:04,095 --> 01:44:07,464
Enough,wake up
-Why cant I sleep more?

951
01:44:07,724 --> 01:44:16,306
Because u cant.
-Such a miser. Expect others to love
but no reciprocation. 1 in return for 1000.

952
01:44:16,306 --> 01:44:19,810
That's all I can do.
-So u agree with me?

953
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,832
Get up, let's do the first song phrase again
-I cant.

954
01:44:22,962 --> 01:44:27,462
I know,u simply yielded
to my stubborness when u wed me.
Not by choice.

955
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:33,708
U miss not marrying that Maya.
-That's true.
I wouldn't have to put up with this nuisance.

956
01:44:34,878 --> 01:44:43,435
So I'm a nuisance? Then I'll go kill myself.
-Go die.I dont care.I'll bury u well.

957
01:44:44,185 --> 01:44:49,136
And then I'll marry Maya and 
live happily ever after.

958
01:44:50,595 --> 01:44:53,595
U wish. I'll kill both of u.

959
01:44:54,721 --> 01:45:00,655
How's that?U would be dead?
-I'll return as a spirit.And strangle u like this.

960
01:45:02,895 --> 01:45:10,155
No need.Just listen to me and we avoid all this, ok?
-I always listen to u

961
01:45:10,525 --> 01:45:16,263
Well,u're not rehearsing despite me telling u, are u?
-I hope this nuisance gets over

962
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:28,139
Suma,presenting this is my life's ambition.Why are
u lazy?Other dancers would've finished this in 2 months

963
01:45:30,849 --> 01:45:35,651
Then get other dancers.Did I stop u?
-I do not see graceful candidates like u

964
01:45:36,611 --> 01:45:43,525
Ah,so admit it. Suma has grace.
So I'm allowed to show off. Now we can start.

965
01:46:01,094 --> 01:46:05,260
When will u stop playing the fool?How late is it?
-1.30. U sleep.

966
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:11,080
No, get up.
-Dont break my mood here

967
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,569
I too have moods and wants.
-This is for u too.

968
01:46:16,879 --> 01:46:24,939
This is ur life ambition.My ambition.. is a junior like u.
-Well, naughty u are.

969
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:38,669
Why have u been gone so long?
-I went for a reason.

970
01:46:38,669 --> 01:46:43,141
Then u should've let us know.
U are arriving 3 days later than u told us.

971
01:46:43,461 --> 01:46:48,801
We were worried about u
-I couldnt communicate. Unforeseen circumstances.

972
01:46:49,511 --> 01:46:54,520
She hasnt moved, or even eaten.
-Good for her.She will slim down

973
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,971
Go freshen up soon

974
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:16,644
I thought I'd return as soon as I saw Kalyani, but she
wasn't there. So I waited. She arrived late last night.

975
01:47:20,554 --> 01:47:26,694
I couldnt tell her I have a moody wife,can I?
Met her in the morning,and they loved Sita.

976
01:47:28,854 --> 01:47:34,521
They will surely come for the performance.
Her interpretations of Mohiniyattam are great.

977
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:44,570
Dont talk. My life is like Sita's. Orphan.
Always cast out. Do u have an ounce of love for me?

978
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:56,071
Dont cry. I just couldnt communicate.
-U can go or come as u wish

979
01:47:56,441 --> 01:48:03,737
Then leash me. U can control me.
Make me jump hoops,whatever.

980
01:48:04,087 --> 01:48:08,375
Are u saying I'm controlling u here?
-Yes

981
01:48:09,575 --> 01:48:14,208
Its out of love,I wish u're always with me.
-Maybe

982
01:48:14,558 --> 01:48:18,840
Maybe? Arent u convinced?
-Yes,but how to convince others this?

983
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:27,238
Who's 'others'?
-Many. We are not the only ones in this world.
Even Mom cribs that she doesnt get time with me these days.

984
01:48:27,348 --> 01:48:33,321
Then I shall go off somewhere. Atleast I dont need help to die.

985
01:48:33,821 --> 01:48:40,552
I've heard this a lot.Then go die.
-U dont care if I die?

986
01:48:40,892 --> 01:48:44,469
Not in the least bit! I will be relieved.

987
01:48:51,265 --> 01:48:54,674
What's the fight about?
Why do u make her cry again?

988
01:48:54,674 --> 01:48:57,917
How can I live with this possesiveness?
There is a limit to all this

989
01:48:57,917 --> 01:49:06,839
She is naive, been alone since childhood.Go console her.
Ur smile will be enough to change her mood.

990
01:49:07,149 --> 01:49:11,118
Ask her to bathe, and then we shall eat lunch

991
01:49:13,816 --> 01:49:16,366
I smell kerosene

992
01:49:32,388 --> 01:49:34,228
Daughter!

993
01:49:39,704 --> 01:49:43,334
Open the door,my dear daughter

994
01:50:01,101 --> 01:50:10,307
She has never given me peace of mind, in life or in
death. See, she doesnt even take me with her.

995
01:50:12,667 --> 01:50:16,624
Now she must be laughing.
It's not that I dont know how to end myself.

996
01:50:17,154 --> 01:50:21,694
But I hold on to my life for my Mom's sake.
Poor Mom has cried a sea of tears.

997
01:50:22,984 --> 01:50:30,000
This life is now for Mom. Not really
life.. what is life without hopes.

998
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:41,153
Until recently, Sita Ramayana was my passion.
I had sculpted it over 10-15 years

999
01:50:41,153 --> 01:50:44,863
Wanted to see it performed.
Now I've lost that want, too.

1000
01:50:45,953 --> 01:50:50,089
We must present it. The world must
know the artist Nandagopan.

1001
01:50:50,089 --> 01:50:59,483
Who needs art from a murderer? It's best
the artist and his work are erased from history.

1002
01:50:59,483 --> 01:51:04,347
The next generation wants it.
As an artist, it's ur duty to gift it.

1003
01:51:04,407 --> 01:51:12,580
No. I have neither mood nor capacity for it.
-That's an illusion.U can and must do it.

1004
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:15,716
I'm ready to sacrifice anything for it.

1005
01:51:15,716 --> 01:51:19,396
We will get support from many well-wishers 
-my dad,Madhavan unni,etc.

1006
01:51:24,170 --> 01:51:30,408
Dont deny this. I may not fit ur criteria asheroine,
or match ur requirements of a dancer.

1007
01:51:31,338 --> 01:51:35,742
But my heart is in it.I can
present Sita if u allow me.

1008
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:53,318
Bless me

1009
01:52:38,353 --> 01:52:40,306
(Singing dance rhythms)

1010
01:52:48,867 --> 01:52:58,499
Praise to Vinayaka, destroyer of
obstacles.Grant us this boon.

1011
01:53:10,579 --> 01:53:12,700
Do bring us luck.

1012
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,672
(Dance rhythms)

1013
01:54:35,063 --> 01:54:37,266
(Sita Ramayanam)

1014
01:54:47,309 --> 01:54:50,785
I get tensed as the big day nears.
Hope I dont spoil ur aspirations.

1015
01:54:51,535 --> 01:54:54,395
U know, statues require
sturdy stone to be carved.

1016
01:54:54,407 --> 01:55:00,767
Sometimes, after years a sculptor
realizes the stone is weak or cracked.

1017
01:55:00,767 --> 01:55:06,051
Imagine the plight of that poor sculptor! I can
never be that let down, I am already satisfied.

1018
01:55:06,219 --> 01:55:08,792
Dont praise me,I will grow proud!

1019
01:55:09,112 --> 01:55:10,932
Maalu, a minute.

1020
01:55:18,773 --> 01:55:25,129
I may be selected for a foreign tour to
England. Only 3 students among us are going.

1021
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:33,324
If Unni sir is going,he'll obviously take his brother
along. Alright, I'm off. Nandu sir has left.

1022
01:55:39,755 --> 01:55:43,949
&lt;Idiom&gt; 'I eyed that mango,but the crow stole it'

1023
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:52,872
The crow will eat it and leave the remains to him.
-Half is eaten already. She has fallen for him

1024
01:55:52,872 --> 01:55:54,612
Dont speak nonense!

1025
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:58,291
Is it nonsense? Haven't u heard the rumors, 
what 'Sita' and 'Ravana' have been upto for long?

1026
01:55:58,291 --> 01:55:59,750
Get lost
- Thinks he's the hero

1027
01:56:12,708 --> 01:56:16,837
I have something to ask
-I'm in a hurry.Time for rehearsal

1028
01:56:16,837 --> 01:56:21,257
Doesn't matter. Listen first. Why do
u sacrifice ur education for this performance?

1029
01:56:21,257 --> 01:56:24,909
U and ur guru haven't even turned up at classes for 2 days.
-Program is only days away

1030
01:56:24,986 --> 01:56:29,914
Lets skip this program. Dont u understand?
Enough of hanging around like this.

1031
01:56:29,914 --> 01:56:37,129
There are others in this world around u.
They see u and ur guru, and say stuff.

1032
01:56:37,129 --> 01:56:41,736
How would I know? Only one who asks would know about this.
-I ask because I have the right to do so.

1033
01:56:41,796 --> 01:56:48,202
I dont like u doing this, I wont permit it.
-I dont need anyone's permission except my parents to do this.

1034
01:56:48,412 --> 01:56:51,276
I shall ask ur parents whether
u should be allowed.

1035
01:56:55,647 --> 01:57:03,009
If Soma doesn't want it,she should drop the plan.
Life is more important than one performance.What say?

1036
01:57:03,519 --> 01:57:11,729
Dont blabber.We shall decide.Let Madhavan unni suggest.
-I wont back out, no matter who tries to prevent me.

1037
01:57:12,189 --> 01:57:20,115
Notices have been put up. Program is only days away.
Pulling out now would be treachery to a fellow artist.

1038
01:57:20,765 --> 01:57:24,189
Dad would understand
-Yes,that's my quandary

1039
01:57:24,359 --> 01:57:30,990
What if she breaks her limbs and cant dance later?
-Maybe that's a good plan.

1040
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:34,324
Dont speak nonense.
Come in, sir.

1041
01:57:41,394 --> 01:57:44,049
Why did u ask me to come soon?

1042
01:57:44,049 --> 01:57:52,650
Some rubbish. Seems people are talking linking
Nandu and her, and Soma was ranting about it here

1043
01:57:52,650 --> 01:58:04,279
End result: She wont participate
-I say we agree to Soma. Why invite trouble?

1044
01:58:04,279 --> 01:58:08,461
That is needed only after marriage.
Why break her heart over this?

1045
01:58:08,661 --> 01:58:13,141
Do u not understand art? Art is a
marathon, needs concentration.

1046
01:58:14,911 --> 01:58:19,894
Dont kill her focus
-But others dont get it.
She's disadvantaged being a girl

1047
01:58:20,084 --> 01:58:26,883
So what if she's a girl? I heard these rumors
too, but paid no heed to them. These are usual things.

1048
01:58:27,573 --> 01:58:34,653
When has society ever encouraged an artist? The only real
artists have grown amidst allegations and ridicule.

1049
01:58:35,103 --> 01:58:41,858
Artists who are hindered by ridicule are forgotten. In the
future, this same society will patronize those who persist.

1050
01:58:42,128 --> 01:58:47,491
Future society will respect and
demand an artist like Malavika

1051
01:58:52,096 --> 01:59:03,619
Child,do not care about all this. Ignore it with courage.
But keep ur mind unstained and pure. Like polished gold.

1052
01:59:04,789 --> 01:59:10,148
God pours blessings into clean vessels.Hope u got it?
-Yes

1053
01:59:10,938 --> 01:59:15,225
Are u sure ur mind is pure?

1054
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:22,465
Poor girl has suffered enough.
Dont bother her with this anymore.

1055
01:59:25,265 --> 01:59:29,709
I took the liberty of a
brother. Hope it is ok?

1056
01:59:32,453 --> 01:59:35,025
I only need this courage

1057
01:59:37,373 --> 01:59:45,425
U wear an artist's robe,but no shame.
-True.I dont understand art and artists.

1058
01:59:45,621 --> 01:59:49,139
My friends mock me. I dont like
her going for this performance.

1059
01:59:49,499 --> 01:59:55,616
Should we spoil her career for u? If u
dont like it, dont marry her. End of story.

1060
01:59:55,946 --> 01:59:59,770
Can heart's love be switched
on and off as one wants?

1061
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:07,554
Everyone has been fooling me.
-Why are u crying like a child. Listen, I'll talk...

1062
02:00:09,504 --> 02:00:19,070
No, dont console me. I know what to
do. I will stop this program with all my life.

1063
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:31,974
Here he comes. Thats him

1064
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:24,652
Soma, stop

1065
02:02:35,804 --> 02:02:40,719
What madness is this.
What would u gain by killing me?

1066
02:02:42,299 --> 02:02:43,673
My life.

1067
02:02:47,543 --> 02:02:55,853
U seduced Maalu. Now she hates me. U parade
her around all day and screw up my life.

1068
02:02:55,993 --> 02:03:03,748
Its not as u think
-Stop speaking.I wont allow u to enjoy after sidelining me.

1069
02:03:17,584 --> 02:03:18,801
Come in

1070
02:03:20,947 --> 02:03:23,194
Thank god,they didnt kill me

1071
02:03:24,044 --> 02:03:26,392
I'm ready to die after I see u present it

1072
02:03:27,182 --> 02:03:28,823
Dont speak nonsense

1073
02:03:28,873 --> 02:03:36,383
Sit down child.Why did they do this?
-Maybe they had some plan.

1074
02:03:37,133 --> 02:03:41,068
Sita is here,wont u offer her coffee?

1075
02:03:46,235 --> 02:03:50,751
Did u recognize them?
-No,it was night. 3 people.

1076
02:03:51,521 --> 02:03:54,732
Madhavan unni came by earlier.
So it seems everyone knows by now.

1077
02:03:55,952 --> 02:04:05,467
Yea. People think the program wont happen today
- Oh, program must happen! I am fine to go ahead.

1078
02:04:06,476 --> 02:04:09,064
Slight body ache and fever.

1079
02:04:09,524 --> 02:04:18,984
But some pepper mixed in booze will remedy it,
suitable medicine.Does ur dad know?

1080
02:04:19,974 --> 02:04:29,302
Yes,he's coming. I came ahead.
I too have committed a mistake, unknowingly. I want to confess.

1081
02:04:30,732 --> 02:04:32,337
What mistake?

1082
02:04:34,577 --> 02:04:40,979
U might have heard some of the rumors.
-I generally ignore rumors.

1083
02:04:40,979 --> 02:04:46,349
If we are untainted,we need not worry.
No allegation will pierce us.

1084
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:53,722
My heart was 'tainted'.
I wished for things I shouldn't have.

1085
02:04:55,112 --> 02:04:57,617
I dont get it. Please tell
me, and dont cry.

1086
02:04:58,107 --> 02:05:03,914
Earlier, I used to have hatred
towards u. Then devotion.

1087
02:05:04,834 --> 02:05:10,154
That turned into adoration.
Then.. I.. loved...

1088
02:05:15,634 --> 02:05:18,200
What stupidity, child.

1089
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:27,394
This is the fickle-mindedness of a female.
Earlier, one I saw as a sister. Now, a disciple.

1090
02:05:34,114 --> 02:05:38,259
Have u not learnt the laws? Guru is considered equated
with father. And u're like a daughter to me.

1091
02:05:40,199 --> 02:05:45,930
Forgive my stupidity.
-Dont cry.

1092
02:05:48,970 --> 02:05:59,311
I devoted my life,body and heart to one
and only one woman. She still lives with me.

1093
02:06:03,869 --> 02:06:08,119
But u will be my favorite
student.. only student.

1094
02:06:10,141 --> 02:06:17,539
I am lucky for that. When Madhavan Unni sir
asked, I was burnt in thoughts.

1095
02:06:17,919 --> 02:06:24,379
But now I can confidently reply to him..
my mind is polished and untainted.

1096
02:06:26,589 --> 02:06:29,589
I dont want to break anybody's hopes

1097
02:06:29,589 --> 02:06:38,517
There is a guy betrothed to u. Soma. He
loves u a lot. U wont find a better guy than him.

1098
02:06:40,047 --> 02:06:43,027
Dont avoid or hurt him

1099
02:06:45,087 --> 02:06:53,082
I understand him. U should invite him
to watch u perform as Sita. Ur real debut. Mine too.

1100
02:06:54,262 --> 02:07:03,902
I dont understand. Will any sane person beat
up a guru? Oh God, what has happened to this boy?

1101
02:07:04,472 --> 02:07:08,560
Madness.When Nandhu told
me, I felt slapped.

1102
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:15,800
He was humorous and sportive about it. But how can I...
I told him he should complain to the police.

1103
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:23,393
No need for that.Explain to him without anger.
-Where can I find him ? Not in the hostel

1104
02:07:23,673 --> 02:07:27,941
Must've gone to native place (Shaarath).
Where else can he go.

1105
02:07:36,551 --> 02:07:44,540
U never used to come here earlier. No class today? Why so dull?
-Its nothing.

1106
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,164
Dont take that. If it falls on ur hand, its trouble.

1107
02:07:53,671 --> 02:07:56,241
Here's ur eldest brother

1108
02:07:57,114 --> 02:08:02,183
Did u not inform Madhavan?
He is perplexed.

1109
02:08:02,723 --> 02:08:11,303
He called me up and asked me.
He has asked u to go soon.

1110
02:08:12,155 --> 02:08:15,155
Why're u taking so long, man,
finish it up.

1111
02:08:29,906 --> 02:08:31,338
(SIta Ramayanam)

1112
02:08:31,338 --> 02:08:34,510
'On this silent dusk, why do u call me?'

1113
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:49,862
'I came wanting. I return satisfied'

1114
02:10:12,865 --> 02:10:16,652
'Praise to Lord Ram.
Praise the King'

1115
02:10:16,902 --> 02:10:25,160
Sneaking in a few drinks? Help urself. This act is
about to end - open up a few bottles will u.

1116
02:10:27,238 --> 02:10:31,414
Were u not around? Ur bro enquired about u at hostel.
-Went home

1117
02:10:31,674 --> 02:10:38,440
So u didnt see the program? Ur girl has been
excellent.She's way beyond ur reach now.

1118
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:44,454
Take these,I'll follow u with more.

1119
02:11:02,572 --> 02:11:11,080
When did u arrive? Can I have one?
-Dont take it !

1120
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:14,625
Go there and serve the drinks fast !

1121
02:11:14,625 --> 02:11:16,855
Not that one.. I..

1122
02:11:18,375 --> 02:11:20,942
Stop standing like a
tree around here

1123
02:11:30,112 --> 02:11:37,277
Hey, was it u who beat up Nandu sir ? Dont dodge my question
-Get lost!

1124
02:11:38,157 --> 02:11:45,153
Friends, with a very emotion-filled final
upcoming act, Sita Ramayanam will conclude.

1125
02:11:45,753 --> 02:11:55,547
'Even after agreeing Lava and Kusha are his children,
Ram hesitates to accept Sita'
-The performance has been excellent!

1126
02:11:57,507 --> 02:12:06,929
'Sita requests Mother Earth, her
mother, to absorb and redeem her'

1127
02:12:06,929 --> 02:12:09,320
'The Earth splits open and
Mother Earth accepts Sita'

1128
02:12:14,439 --> 02:12:15,878
Stop

1129
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:21,693
So u're courageous enough to
beat up people now?

1130
02:12:22,313 --> 02:12:30,006
What's happened to u, so foolish.I reserve my
words for now.Nandu plans to talk to u.

1131
02:12:30,226 --> 02:12:34,543
Did u think that a man and woman
can have only one relationship?

1132
02:12:34,963 --> 02:12:41,557
Doubt is a disease. U are inflicted.
Maalu came in search of u many times today.

1133
02:12:44,447 --> 02:12:49,578
She cried, apoligized saying she
insulted u or something

1134
02:12:51,868 --> 02:12:55,184
She insisted u should come for the debut.

1135
02:12:55,324 --> 02:12:59,944
Said she wont learn dance anymore
if u dont like it. Happy now?

1136
02:13:01,564 --> 02:13:07,034
Love can only be understood
by love. Kindness, with kindness.

1137
02:13:21,935 --> 02:13:25,219
Dont cry. Repent and
make up for mistakes.

1138
02:13:26,099 --> 02:13:27,446
This cannot be repaired.

1139
02:13:31,296 --> 02:13:33,866
I made a grave mistake.

1140
02:13:36,876 --> 02:13:42,582
I added poison to the Coke (Thumbs up) given to Nandagopan sir
-Poison!?

1141
02:13:44,692 --> 02:13:53,635
I dont know who got that bottle. Someone has drunk it.
Maalu, Nandu, principal.. someone

1142
02:13:56,145 --> 02:13:59,328
I dont know whom
-God

1143
02:14:06,656 --> 02:14:19,662
It is the right time now.
Peace. peace. peace...

1144
02:14:22,742 --> 02:14:33,420
Oh kingdom of Rama, throne to many
suns and moons.

1145
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:41,360
Oh gods, sages, ..

1146
02:14:43,390 --> 02:14:59,744
...stars, dreams, flowers.
I bade farewell to u all.

1147
02:14:59,781 --> 02:15:02,781
(Time for) peace.. peace.. peace

1148
02:15:32,019 --> 02:15:39,143
A sweet boom resounded as
u broke the Thrayambakam bow,...

1149
02:15:41,593 --> 02:15:53,935
..and granted queenly status to a mud-born
kid from Mithila, oh Prince of Kosala (Ram)

1150
02:16:37,115 --> 02:16:50,653
Without considering my request, why
did u throw away my wedding ring ?

1151
02:17:00,044 --> 02:17:06,364
Why do u separate me from u,
oh 'great gem of a king'

1152
02:17:06,364 --> 02:17:09,157
Oh Prince of Kosala

1153
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:32,522
U disbelieve even the Fire that burns
life into me, oh Prince of Kosala

1154
02:17:45,463 --> 02:17:54,573
But know this.. Sita has always slept only
at thy feet, as I imagine them near me.

1155
02:18:16,374 --> 02:18:21,644
The life in me shivers. This sad story of
Ramayana sobs itself to an end.

1156
02:18:21,644 --> 02:18:23,544
As my senses grow numb unto death..

1157
02:18:24,114 --> 02:18:29,037
Has unjust male chauvinism incarnated
into a dark form as you, Rama !

1158
02:18:29,037 --> 02:18:31,424
as this era (of Ram) draws to an end...

1159
02:18:36,563 --> 02:18:43,850
Oh mother.
All-tolerating mother (Earth).

1160
02:18:48,909 --> 02:18:53,505
Oh jewel-bearing mother

1161
02:18:56,316 --> 02:19:13,234
Wake up. Please absorb me into your heart, along
with the tears of Tretayuga (age of Ram)

1162
02:19:32,575 --> 02:19:36,248
Sir, what's wrong?
-We must hospitalize him.He's been poisoned

1163
02:19:36,888 --> 02:19:40,055
No, I'm alright.
-Nandu,let's go to the hospital

1164
02:19:40,315 --> 02:19:48,366
Please listen.. I am alright.
This is my life's ambition happening here.

1165
02:19:49,736 --> 02:19:54,780
This is my life's aim, dont interrupt it.
-Nandu listen to me

1166
02:19:56,680 --> 02:20:06,990
Child, its ur debut. Finish it successfully.
It's my dream. I request. Dont stop.

1167
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:27,919
(Final dance rhythms)

1168
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:35,529
Forgive me
