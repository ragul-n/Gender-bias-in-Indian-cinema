1
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:17,733
Is the counter open yet?
- Yes.

2
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,069
I hear that Vikram is here.
- Yes.

3
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,204
Are you here to buy the book?

4
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:24,340
Actually, I just
enjoy waiting in queues!

5
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,741
Chill man.

6
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:28,211
What an interesting book, at his age

7
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:29,445
It's truly commendable.

8
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:32,415
I've recommended it to all
my friends from the kitty.

9
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:35,184
Excuse me, I have this important
flight to catch so can I please...

10
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,284
Yes, sure.
- Thanks

11
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,391
Papa, let's go for 'Spiderman'

12
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:46,162
No, let's buy the book for
your mother first and then leave

13
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:47,730
Thank you.

14
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,098
Papa is right son,
let's first buy the book...

15
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,734
...and we will leave for the movie.

16
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,537
I loved 'Nanhe
Jaisalmer', it's an amazing book.

17
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:58,802
And Vikram is so cute. I
would like a signed copy.

18
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,345
Excuse me, I'll miss my flight,
please may I stand ahead of you?

19
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:03,479
Thank you.

20
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:04,614
It's an inspirational story

21
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:07,416
International Booker Prize.
Papa, is he only 21?

22
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:11,282
Some people achieve
fame at a young age.

23
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:13,489
Hey Roby.
- Hey Amit, what's up bro?

24
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:17,059
Found it? - Yeah, I bought three
copies but they all got pinched.

25
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,162
Nice cover!
- Hey man, this is amazing.

26
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,264
Hey, hey...
- Yeah! Yeah! I'm coming Jam!

27
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:22,398
Yeah! it's a surprise for you.

28
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:24,066
Surprise for you honey...

29
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,191
Hi. I'm Ashish

30
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,540
I want the rights to this book.

31
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,105
So you can make a film on it?

32
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:38,314
Excuse me. I've an important flight
to catch. Can i get ahead of you.

33
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,416
I've been standing here
since five in the morning.

34
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,351
Please?

35
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:44,451
Thank you

36
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,389
Thank you

37
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,489
For my mother

38
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:46,613
Sir, are you Vikram, the author?

39
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:49,352
Yes

40
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:53,556
The book has been in the spotlight.
I've put up three billboards.

41
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:55,458
I am very pleased
to finally meet you.

42
00:04:55,558 --> 00:04:57,558
Have you read it?

43
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:03,257
Sir, I'm not educated and my
work keeps me away from books.

44
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,268
I can understand.

45
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:08,037
But Sir, I would love to
hear the story some day.

46
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:09,205
Why not today?

47
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:11,305
Now?
- Yes.

48
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:18,576
This is the story of a young
boy from Jaisalmer, in Rajasthan

49
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,663
Whom I met 11 years ago.

50
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:36,139
The best tourist guide and camel
boy from the region- Nanhe Jaisalmer

51
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:58,153
Raja, sit, sit.

52
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:03,353
Safari! Safari! Safari!

53
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,125
Nanhe spoke many languages
- French, Italian, German, English.

54
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:11,067
This is Bada Baug.

55
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:15,037
When members of the royal family
pass away, they are cremated here.

56
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:17,540
And his grandson makes an
umbrella-shaped monument...

57
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
...to mark the occasion.

58
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:21,544
What if I die, Nanhe?

59
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:25,639
You don't look like royalty,
but I can make you!

60
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:32,186
Smile please.

61
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:41,129
Hey Nanhe, tell us about this lake.

62
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:47,565
This is Ghadisar Lake, made by
King Ghardsi for drinking water.

63
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:49,505
That's a lot of drinking water.

64
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,507
Yes, lots of drinking water.

65
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,142
But now no one drinks it.

66
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:56,078
It's Jaisalmer's
biggest swimming pool.

67
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:59,773
People use it to
wash clothes, to boat.

68
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:05,485
And little kids use it
to pee while swimming.

69
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,461
Even I do!

70
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:14,029
Nanhe was not just a tourist guide,
he could make friends instantly.

71
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,849
Children are innocent, you know.

72
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:21,036
Jaisalmer is known for its royalty,
heritage, culture...

73
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:25,508
...sand dunes and the desert
but the safari is the best.

74
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,143
What is England famous for?

75
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,963
England is famous for the Queen.

76
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:32,381
That old lady?
Someday I have will come...

77
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:36,285
You must. You know so many
languages, who taught you?

78
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:39,149
One pen.
- One-pen? A teacher?

79
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:40,589
Teacher, teacher.

80
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,453
Hurry, chase her Motu.

81
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,691
One pen, one pen... Ma'am one pen...

82
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,128
What's your name?

83
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:52,797
What does that mean?

84
00:07:53,435 --> 00:08:00,307
'Bonjour' means hello, 'Comment tut
'appelles' means what's your name.

85
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:03,012
Your name. your name.
- Okay, I understand.

86
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:07,071
That's how we pick
up languages, got it?

87
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,249
That's good.

88
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,432
Nanhe entertained all the tourists.

89
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:38,180
Greetings (in the local
language of the region)

90
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,595
But who was Nanhe's
source of happiness?

91
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:46,144
His dearest friend.

92
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:48,382
Tonight at seven...

93
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:52,695
Nanhe don't forget! Tonight at
seven, your friend Bobby Deol's film.

94
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:56,165
How can I forget, it
is my friend's movie.

95
00:08:56,265 --> 00:09:01,225
Nanhe, I've composed a
new verse. Sit and listen.

96
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,506
Let me clean your glasses first.

97
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,574
Definitely.

98
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:07,276
Now, let's hear it.

99
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:11,201
It would be tomorrow
had I sat down to listen.

100
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,720
Hukadi banna, what news?

101
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:16,216
News...

102
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:26,117
Four terrorists killed in Ajmer,
mayhem in the Parliament.

103
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,883
Anything from the world of film?

104
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,294
Film world?

105
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:39,180
Launch of Madhuri Dixit's new film.

106
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,577
Anil Kapoor's shooting...

107
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:44,113
Is there anything about Bobby Deol?

108
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:45,414
No.

109
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:48,050
Of course there is! It's
his film screening today.

110
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,315
This evening at seven
watch Bobby Deol's 'Soldier'

111
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:54,223
I hope you'll be there.

112
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:57,554
He isn't such a good friend of mine.

113
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:59,851
That's true. And you all?

114
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:02,231
No pal, I have a
safari this evening.

115
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:05,306
What about the rest of you?
- Maybe.

116
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,348
How many of you took a safari today?

117
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:20,516
Who went?

118
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,351
Motu had gone.

119
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:26,182
Bheema and Feroze too.

120
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,524
In fact, Nanhe took the first safari.

121
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:30,292
Ashu also took one.

122
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:32,392
All of us did.

123
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:35,097
I have told you time and again...

124
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:39,532
...that the first safari is
mine, so why did you go?

125
00:10:41,737 --> 00:10:43,737
Stop!

126
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:46,756
Start walking like chickens...

127
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:54,619
Run. Come on Nanhe, run.

128
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,717
Taking me on?

129
00:10:57,553 --> 00:11:01,548
Raja, when I grow up, I
won't spare this fellow.

130
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:22,234
Ma, get me the jaggery.

131
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:24,113
How was the safari?

132
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:29,378
It was good. English folk,
they've invited me to England.

133
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:32,154
And why won't they? You are
the next Kohinoor after all!

134
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,254
Excuse me!

135
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,229
Take this 300 for the
safari and 50 for the tip.

136
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:43,098
Go wash up, I'll get you some food.

137
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:47,448
I will get late. I have to
meet my friend at seven.

138
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:51,958
We are set to meet after long...

139
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:57,212
You really make me
wait far too long.

140
00:11:57,312 --> 00:12:01,987
It's been a month. But we
shall definitely meet tonight.

141
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:06,622
When will you get over this
madness of watching films?

142
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:11,482
Never! As long as it's my
friend's film, I will watch it.

143
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,431
Look Nanhe, if you go
on about your 'friend',

144
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:18,200
I will have to
send you to an asylum.

145
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,268
But he's my friend.

146
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:23,395
Look, at the
affection he has for me.

147
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,476
You were four years old
when he came here for a shoot.

148
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:30,079
Just because he held
you in a scene and...

149
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,649
...called you 'buddy' does
not make him your friend.

150
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:37,086
Think about it,
Jaisalmer is full of children...

151
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:40,155
...but he chose me amongst all.

152
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,224
That is because he saw
something special in me.

153
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:44,259
Our friendship has
a certain equation.

154
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,096
I am the best camel boy
and he is the best actor.

155
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:52,101
He probably doesn't even remember.
Bobby Deol is a famous actor-

156
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,336
...everyone can't be like him.

157
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:57,131
But I don't want to be an actor.

158
00:12:57,231 --> 00:13:00,946
Though I will go to
Bombay to meet my friend.

159
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:07,104
And look, I have been saving
money to take him a present.

160
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:11,053
You look at the moon and
talk of reaching for the stars.

161
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:13,689
The moon is at my window everyday.

162
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:18,379
One day I'll just take a
step up and reach for my star.

163
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,429
May I leave now?

164
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,009
Take this, for your movie.

165
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,968
Can you please put this back?

166
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:38,779
Where is Nanhe? The
sun has almost set.

167
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:44,086
How does it matter? You've
already downed a quarter bottle.

168
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:47,122
Hope we don't miss the
heroine's opening sequence.

169
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:51,897
Yes, she will emerge from
the screen and come after you.

170
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:54,659
Nanhe.
- Mother's coming - Yes

171
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,201
Whose tobacco is this?

172
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:01,360
What? Oh, this.
- Yes.

173
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:04,918
Is not mine. Raja is
fond of this stuff.

174
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,242
When will you quit this habit?

175
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:09,211
Let's get out. Let's get out.

176
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,713
Run Khemaji, run.
Let's get away quickly.

177
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:15,128
You don't even make
friends of your age.

178
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,430
Here's my friend

179
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,571
Nanhe.

180
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:49,827
Khemaji, when will
the heroine appear?

181
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,656
Here she is.

182
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,490
You damaged my car. If you don't
know how to drive, why do you?

183
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,845
Her voice sounds so
much like Ma'am's.

184
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,825
You find every
actress's voice like Ma'am's.

185
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,277
Are you lot here to
chitchat or to watch the film?

186
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,446
Nanhe, we are here
to keep you company.

187
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,147
You are not here for me.

188
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:22,251
You are here to hide from your
wife and gulp your 'medicine'.

189
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:24,553
And Jassuji is here to
hear the heroine's voice.

190
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:28,053
Now stay quiet and
let me watch the film.

191
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:47,270
No, I don't want your love.

192
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:50,572
No, I don't want your love.

193
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:54,614
No, I don't want your love.

194
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,151
I don't want your love.

195
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:59,448
Tony.

196
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:03,513
"Beloved, I don't want your heart..."

197
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:15,135
Raju.

198
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:18,596
Mother.
- Raju.

199
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:24,081
Don't cry you'll make me sob too.

200
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,410
I kept you away
from me for 20 years...

201
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:35,871
Hit him, friend, hit him hard.

202
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,558
Raju.

203
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:42,289
Mother.

204
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,466
Hit him, friend, hit him hard.

205
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:46,566
Hit him some more.

206
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,571
I had sworn to kill you mercilessly.

207
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:02,250
This is fun.

208
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,815
Or the lap of the motherland.

209
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,452
Friend you are a hit.

210
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:11,195
Wow, it's a great movie.

211
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:14,098
The heroine's voice is beautiful.

212
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:25,264
Nanhe, how was your
friend, Bobby Deol's, movie?

213
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,810
Here's your superstar's poster.

214
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:35,632
Why are you driving
with your eyes closed?

215
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:40,055
I am driving with
one eye shut because...

216
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:44,683
...if I keep both open,
I can see two roads.

217
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,881
Will you be able to handle this?

218
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:52,792
Why, what do you think?
Do I look drunk?

219
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:57,195
You are not drunk but be careful.

220
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:03,506
Watch out.
- Be Careful

221
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,513
This vehicle seems to weigh less.

222
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,286
Jassuji!

223
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:13,386
Khemaji!

224
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:16,625
Jassuji!

225
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,091
I hope you are not hurt.

226
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:22,339
I was sure that the
auto weighed less.

227
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:27,308
Speed breakers are
invisible to the best of us.

228
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,669
Sister.

229
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,804
Sister. Sister.

230
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:37,236
Let's go please.

231
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:40,676
Write.
- Now?

232
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:43,183
Please write

233
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:48,486
My dear friend...

234
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:53,395
...I watched your movie and you
gave the bad guys a good beating.

235
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:56,064
I had another
argument with my mother.

236
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:58,600
She thinks I want to come to
Bombay to become an actor.

237
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,067
I think she is crazy.

238
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,139
This is inappropriate.

239
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,440
How else do you write it?

240
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,203
Mother is mistaken that...

241
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:13,245
So write that then.
How is your shoot?

242
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:19,313
I am a little busy since it's high
season time. What have you written?

243
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,654
...it's season time

244
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,455
I've been thinking I'll
sport a hairdo like yours.

245
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,586
Quit kidding yourself,
you look like a monkey.

246
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,664
Sister, when I wet my hair and comb
it back, Mother says I look smart.

247
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,575
Yes, an important piece of news

248
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,905
Mother has found a
groom for my sister.

249
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:47,313
Why do you look coy?

250
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:48,550
Why do you want to say this?

251
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,718
Because he knows you too.

252
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:52,446
That's all, rest tomorrow.

253
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:56,158
Best wishes from Nanhe
Jaisalmer and Raja Jaisalmer.

254
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,258
Raja Jaisalmer.

255
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:04,197
Come sign here.

256
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:15,510
Had you studied a little, you
could have written your own letters?

257
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,212
Then what would you do?

258
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:21,110
You're ten and you
can't even write your name.

259
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,118
But I can speak four languages.

260
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,220
There is a difference
between speaking and writing.

261
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,089
People get educated to
earn a better living, and...

262
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:31,126
...I am earning already
so why should I study?

263
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:36,156
Yeah... whatever, go add a
tally mark to your letter count.

264
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:58,851
This saving is for you.

265
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:09,230
love, love, you are my life

266
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:15,428
love, love, you are my life

267
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:20,400
always stay close to

268
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:33,588
always stay close to my heart,
stay close to my heart

269
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,564
Friend you are a hit.

270
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:01,478
love, love, you are my life

271
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:05,110
love, love, you are my life

272
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:08,188
always stay close to

273
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:20,527
always stay close to my heart,
stay close to my heart

274
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:26,268
love, love, you are my life

275
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:29,571
love, love, you are my life

276
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:32,771
always stay close to

277
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:45,251
always stay close to my heart,
stay close to my heart

278
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:07,110
it's you I desire,
it's you in I search for

279
00:23:08,316 --> 00:23:13,754
I live because I sense you

280
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:27,130
you are my selflessness, you
are my love, you are my desire

281
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:30,732
always stay close to

282
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:34,332
always stay close to

283
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:43,517
always stay close to my heart,
stay close to my heart

284
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:56,159
love, love, you are my life

285
00:23:56,264 --> 00:23:59,427
love, love, you are my life

286
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:02,434
always stay close to

287
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:06,196
always stay close to

288
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:14,541
always stay close to my heart,
stay close to my heart

289
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:23,453
always stay close to my heart,
stay close to my heart

290
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:33,724
love, love, you are my life

291
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:38,529
love, love, you are my life

292
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:41,142
Friend. Friend.

293
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:43,301
Friend. Friend. Friend.

294
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:45,411
Friend. Friend.

295
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,283
Mother?

296
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:49,451
You've been dreaming of him again.

297
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,319
Today I was so close to him that...

298
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,354
That Bobby Deol
was about to hug you.

299
00:24:53,454 --> 00:24:56,090
Had I told him that I am
Nanhe Jaisalmer, forget the hug...

300
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,165
...he would've taken me in his car.

301
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,196
What time is it?

302
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:20,315
Uncle.

303
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:21,683
You are late again today.

304
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:25,098
I would have been
late had I missed you.

305
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:29,311
Have I ever sent out
mail without your letter?

306
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,295
Ma'am, safari?

307
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:36,761
Ma'am, safari?
- Yes.

308
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,298
Hey, Nanhe!

309
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:45,406
Yes Ma'am, he will take you.

310
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:47,506
Alright, thank you.

311
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:51,613
Come on, tell me where are you from?

312
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:54,415
When I grow up I won't spare Magghu.

313
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:56,084
Any clients?

314
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:58,653
There were some at the fort.
- Magghu has taken them.

315
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:01,048
Oh... Ma'am
- Hide, quickly.

316
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:06,027
Oh... Ma'am

317
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:10,131
Ma'am is on her way here so
you are fleeing the scene?

318
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:13,067
How will I face Ma'am in my
underpants? What's wrong with you?

319
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:17,077
Now he'll reappear
dressed in his best clothes.

320
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:24,212
Hello, Ma'am
- Hello, Dhurinder. How are you?

321
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:26,180
I am good. How is Sir?

322
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,316
He's good, busy in a meeting today.

323
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:29,551
Hello, Ma'am
- Hello.

324
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:31,119
Come on, get the bags out.

325
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:35,123
How are you? Please bring
the accounts file upstairs.

326
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:36,691
Yes.

327
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:41,387
And send Nanhe in when he
gets here, don't forget.

328
00:26:43,631 --> 00:26:48,432
Nanhe, you are hiding here. Ma'am
wants to speak to you.

329
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:53,140
Hello, Ma'am

330
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,242
Come up.

331
00:26:54,342 --> 00:26:56,342
Yes Ma'am.

332
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,080
Transfer ten percent
of this year's profit...

333
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,382
...from the hotel
into the school fund.

334
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,017
Yes Ma'am.

335
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:06,177
And now, please
get the roof cleaned.

336
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:09,431
Okay fine. Goodbye, Ma'am.

337
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:14,525
Your Night School
literacy campaign is brilliant.

338
00:27:14,762 --> 00:27:18,433
I recommend that Dhurinder be made
the watchman for the night class.

339
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:21,263
Durjan Singh is illiterate too.

340
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:25,440
This year you too will have
to attend the night school.

341
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,540
Yes, Ma'am

342
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:33,045
I want every elderly
person and child...

343
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:38,553
...from this town to be literate.
Only then can the campaign succeed.

344
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:40,054
Let's take you on
location to the launch...

345
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:43,129
...of Bobby Deol's new movie 'Yaar'

346
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:48,429
'Yaar', the title seems to
indicate yet another romantic film.

347
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,132
Looking after the Night
School is your responsibility now.

348
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:52,400
Yes Ma'am.

349
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,471
'Yaar' can also mean a friend.
This film is about friendship

350
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,418
If you need anything, let me know.

351
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,474
Okay, Ma'am.

352
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:03,645
Sir, your scene.

353
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:08,282
Sir, in this scene you give your
friend all the money you have.

354
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,442
Ok, I will be there in five minutes.

355
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:15,056
The class must have at
least twenty students.

356
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,224
Go ahead, ask the questions.

357
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:19,384
What is your character in this film?

358
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:22,163
In this film, I play...

359
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:24,643
Where has Nanhe disappeared?

360
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:30,271
Interesting. All this
with a friend's help?

361
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:34,642
Your parents, your siblings... are
all relationships determined by God.

362
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:38,992
Friendship is the only
relationship that we choose.

363
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:44,152
Are you insecure of the vagaries
of this world-hits and flops?

364
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:45,319
It is all in the mind.

365
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,689
Encourage as many people as you can.

366
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:49,057
Yes Ma'am. I will
visit homes to explain...

367
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:51,059
...the benefits of
this campaign and...

368
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:53,227
...encourage people
to join. May I leave?

369
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:55,877
Yes, please.
- Good bye, Ma'am.

370
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,113
Follow your heart to
choose your dreams.

371
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,270
Make your dream your
goal and believe in it.

372
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,007
You will see how your
belief becomes your strength...

373
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:08,232
...and helps you succeed.

374
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,014
What have you decided this time?

375
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:14,182
What about?

376
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:15,483
About school.

377
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:18,019
I have spoken to a lot of
people about it, Khemaji and...

378
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:20,321
...Jassuji are
eagerly waiting to join.

379
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:22,290
I am talking about you.

380
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,461
Me? I am fairly smart Ma'am and this
year we have a busy tourist season.

381
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:29,536
You are intelligent but illiterate.

382
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:32,233
The tourist season
only lasts four months.

383
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:37,472
If there is the dread of disease or
famine, the tourists will stay away.

384
00:29:37,572 --> 00:29:43,182
What will you do then? If you
study, you'll have many more options.

385
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:48,205
Look Nanhe, this time
you have to attend school.

386
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,586
Whatever you think is
best. Goodbye, Ma'am.

387
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:53,686
Goodbye.

388
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
Nanhe.
- Yes Ma'am.

389
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,530
Take this.

390
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:12,473
Night school begins soon, I will
have to come up with a new excuse.

391
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:16,444
There is a movie in the
neighbouring village, shall we go?

392
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,578
Is it Bobby Deol's?

393
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:23,617
No, but the actress is pretty, her
voice is exactly like Madamji's.

394
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:26,621
She was asking after
you, you should go meet her.

395
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,089
Really?

396
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:32,193
Hukadi mentioned that there is
some news on Bobby Deol in the paper.

397
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:34,293
On Bobby Deol?

398
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:39,579
Raja, my friend's
in the paper today.

399
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,727
Brother Hukadi.
- Nanhe.

400
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:50,538
Brother Hukadi!

401
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:54,649
Brother Hukadi.
- You will not believe this.

402
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,117
What news?

403
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:59,107
There's is news about your friend.

404
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:00,454
Come. Come.

405
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:01,589
Tell me.

406
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,391
Take a deep breath and listen.

407
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,059
"Bobby Deol's new film
'Yaar' was launched at...

408
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,794
...a five-star hotel in Mumbai.

409
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:12,266
The shoot for this
film begins next week.

410
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:15,069
The first thirty days of
shoot may be in Jaisalmer...

411
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,314
...and Barmer
districts of Rajasthan."

412
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:21,709
Happy?

413
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,145
Nanhe, I promise it is the truth.

414
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:27,180
My friend is coming.

415
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:32,710
Sister, my friend is coming.

416
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:35,617
My friend is coming.

417
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:44,609
Sister, my friend is coming.

418
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:49,635
Sister, my friend...

419
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:56,175
Sister.

420
00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:04,143
Sister.

421
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,719
Sister.

422
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,556
What happened?
- Sister.

423
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:10,157
My friend's coming.

424
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:14,148
Friend is coming?
- Yes, look at this. Read it.

425
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:16,196
Wait a minute.

426
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:19,066
"Bobby Deol's new film

427

My friend is coming!

439
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,445
Do you really think
that he will come?

440
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:03,363
Of course he'll come. He will
come to meet me. And I believe that.

441
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:09,113
Please read it to me once more.

442
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:12,484
Ok, come here.

443
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:27,068

Sister!

446
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:40,179
Sister, please.

447
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:44,149
"Bobby Deol's new film 'Yaar'

448
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:50,156
Last time you were here I
was too young. What say, Raja?

449
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:53,094
This time we will have
to take care of you.

450
00:33:53,194 --> 00:33:56,546
Let's go find a
present for him tomorrow.

451
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:57,631
Hey, Nanhe

452
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:59,756
"Solider, Solider..."

453
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:03,537
"Solider, Solider..."

454
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:07,108
What's the matter
Narayan Singhji, you look sad?

455
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:13,147
When camels grow old they are
made to sit outside the house.

456
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:16,550
You tell me, you
look extremely happy.

457
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,319
My friend is coming.

458
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:22,490
Sir, have a look at this jacket.
You'll look like a hero in it.

459
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,191
Like a superstar from the movies.

460
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,124
Yes, this seems just right.

461
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:30,398
How much is it for?

462
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:33,126
You will buy it? Get lost.

463
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:35,234
Bad omen.

464
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:39,707
Sir, it's for five thousand rupees

465
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,075
Then give me the one for five
hundred rupees.

466
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:42,743
I can't afford this one.

467
00:34:42,843 --> 00:34:45,988
I will buy this jacket,
for my friend.

468
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:07,158
my saffron clad friend

469
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:13,131

my eyes see you, only you

474

come as my heart calls out
to you, calls out to you

475
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:55,508
welcome to my land

476
00:35:55,816 --> 00:36:00,685
welcome to my land

477
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:06,421
welcome to my land

478
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:11,621
welcome to my land

479
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:28,205
since I've had news of your arrival

480
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:33,412
my heart is beaming with joy

481
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:39,282
I am eager to meet you

482
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:47,162
so eager that I
can't find peace anywhere

483
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:54,672
my saffron clad friend

484
00:36:54,808 --> 00:37:00,178
welcome to my land

485
00:37:00,314 --> 00:37:05,115
welcome to my land

my eyes see you, only you

487
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:20,098
come as my heart calls out
to you, calls out to you

welcome to my land

492
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:54,124
welcome to my land

493
00:37:57,438 --> 00:37:59,273
Mother, pass me the jaggery.

494
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:01,008
Come here.

495
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:02,176
Coming.

496
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:04,111
Yes.

497
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:05,613
This is my son, Nanhe.

498
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:07,713
Hello.

499
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:11,646
Go see if your sister is dressed.

500
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,654
Who are these people?

501
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:17,057
This is the groom's family,
they are here to see your sister.

502
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:18,292
Go!

503
00:38:18,392 --> 00:38:22,302
There are three men outside,
whom do you fancy?

504
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,371
Stop fooling around,
I'm really nervous.

505
00:38:30,471 --> 00:38:35,465
Suman.
- Let's go. Come on.

506
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:39,678
Hello.

507
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:42,049
This is my daughter, Suman.

508
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:43,484
So you have a daughter and a son.

509
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:46,086
No sir, one daughter and two sons.

510
00:38:46,186 --> 00:38:47,221
Two sons?

511
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:49,585
Yes
- Raja and I

512
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:53,591
Nanhe, please serve Badal.

513
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:59,531
Badal? My friend's screen name.
This couple is the right match.

514
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:05,572
We'd like your daughter to
be a part of our family.

515
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:07,107
Thank you.
- Thank you.

516
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:09,842
Nanhe, please escort them home.

517
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:17,133
'I love only you'

518
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,276
'I love only you'

519
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,513
'I love only you'

520
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:23,622
'I love only you'

521
00:39:24,124 --> 00:39:26,293
Nanhe, go visit your uncle tomorrow.

522
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:28,062
Visit uncle? Why?

523
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:31,031
He's borrowed six thousand
rupees for his daughter's wedding,

524
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:33,133
...get that money back from him.

525
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:37,823
Okay, I will. I think my
brother-in-law is really cool.

526
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:40,507
Look, what a fine crop
we're expecting this year.

527
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:44,085
I will return the
money after the harvest.

528
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:47,381
I will even add some extra
to the amount I owe her.

529
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:49,583
Tell your mother not to stress.

530
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:51,683
Good bye, Uncle.

531
00:39:58,258 --> 00:40:01,061
One hell of a shortcut.
We're now stuck here.

532
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:03,130
Had I been driving, this
would never have happened.

533
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,065
Yes, that is because
like a camel in the desert...

534
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:07,970
...you can swim through the sand.

535
00:40:08,202 --> 00:40:09,470
Forget it. Let's
call that camel boy.

536
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,570
Hey you, camel boy.

537
00:40:21,615 --> 00:40:23,417
Listen for a moment.

538
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:25,517
Sit.

539
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:29,539
So your car's stuck.

540
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,492
Please help us take
the car out of the sand.

541
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:33,227
He can't handle it.

542
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:35,327
Raja!

543
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:52,178
Come on Raja... pull with
all your might. Pull... Raja.

544
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:57,808
Come on Raja... pull with
all your might. Pull... Raja.

545
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,218
Pull! Pull! Pull!

546
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:05,092
Well done little one,
your camel is intelligent.

547
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:07,524
You must be new here...

548
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:09,530
...otherwise everyone knows
him as 'Raja Jaisalmer.'

549
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,630
What's your name?

550
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:14,232
Nanhe Jaisalmer.

551
00:41:21,675 --> 00:41:23,675
Nanhe...

552
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:33,585
Friend!

553
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,198
Raja.

554
00:41:51,672 --> 00:41:53,340
What are you doing?

555
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,109
I'm checking to see
if it's a daydream.

556
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:58,209
Nanhe Jaisalmer.

557
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:02,213
This is not a dream.

558
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,827
Raja, this really is my friend.

559
00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:49,263
This is Raja, right?
- Yeah.

560
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:50,531
Raja Jaisalmer.

561
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:52,566
How is your mother?
- She is well.

562
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:54,201
Is Suman's wedding fixed now?

563
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:56,103
Yes and you will have to attend.

564
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:57,738
Of course, she's my sister too.

565
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,408
Friend, I wrote you so many
letters but you never replied.

566
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:04,044
How could I?
- Of course, you are a busy person.

567
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:08,582
Look, I am carrying your last
letter. You never wrote your address.

568
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:10,977
So how would I had replied.

569
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:12,185
This sister!

570
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:15,289
Then, I thought I'd personally
look for you when I got to Jaisalmer.

571
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:17,157
This sister of mine
is really foolish.

572
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:18,692
What?
- Sorry friend.

573
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:22,262
Let's go home, mother and sister
will never believe that you are here.

574
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:23,530
I have a shoot this evening.

575
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,065
Shoot! As soon as you arrive?

576
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:27,100
What to do? We're
on a tight schedule.

577
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Then you carry on.

578
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:32,706
Let's meet tomorrow at
seven after the shoot.

579
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:35,172
But far from the crowds.

580
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:38,345
We'll meet at the Ghadisar Lake,
it is fairly secluded after sunset.

581
00:43:38,445 --> 00:43:40,080
That works.

582
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,214
Goodbye, my friend

583
00:43:41,314 --> 00:43:42,716
Goodbye.

584
00:43:42,816 --> 00:43:45,148
Mother! Sister!

585
00:43:45,252 --> 00:43:47,277
Mother! Sister! Mother!

586
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:49,089
Mother!

587
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:50,390
Nanhe, you're here!

588
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:54,194
I was telling your mother
that school starts tomorrow.

589
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:55,362
From tomorrow?

590
00:43:55,462 --> 00:43:57,097
Attend to your camel
safari in the day and...

591
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:59,132
...come to school at
seven in the evening.

592
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:01,368
At seven? I can't attend school.

593
00:44:01,468 --> 00:44:05,038
This year I won't listen
to any excuses from you.

594
00:44:05,138 --> 00:44:06,239
But, Bobby Deol...

595
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,676
Enough Nanhe... I've had it
with your Bobby Deol nonsense.

596
00:44:09,776 --> 00:44:11,044
Ma'am is kind enough to spare time...

597
00:44:11,144 --> 00:44:14,348
...and energy to educate you and
you keep coming up with excuses.

598
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:18,285
But, I really can't attend school.
I have to meet my friend tomorrow.

599
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:22,522
That is enough. I don't want to
argue. You'll go to school tomorrow.

600
00:44:22,622 --> 00:44:27,722
No, I will not go. If you
force me I will run away from home.

601
00:44:44,444 --> 00:44:51,350
Madamji, I apologize on his behalf.
He will be at school tomorrow.

602
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:56,490
He's been shouldering
responsibilities since he was six.

603
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:02,115
But he's still innocent and thinks
we are forcing our will on him.

604
00:45:02,462 --> 00:45:06,066
I want him to stop dreaming
and come to terms with reality.

605
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,035
I want him to study
and make a real life...

606
00:45:08,135 --> 00:45:11,627
...but he's too
captivated by Bobby Deol.

607
00:45:12,472 --> 00:45:15,022
Look at his perspective Sarla.

608
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:19,046
He considers Bobby Deol's
affection to compensate...

609
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:21,281
...for the lack of his father's.

610
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:25,085
That's how he became more
important than a friend to him.

611
00:45:25,185 --> 00:45:27,185
Do you understand?

612
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:43,531
Nanhe, eat your food.

613
00:45:43,703 --> 00:45:45,138
I don't want to eat.

614
00:45:45,238 --> 00:45:46,707
Don't be stubborn, eat your food.

615
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:49,276
I am not hungry and I don't
wish to go to school either.

616
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:50,644
But why?

617
00:45:50,744 --> 00:45:54,081
I have to reach Ghadisar at
seven tomorrow to meet my friend.

618
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:57,776
Look, there is no escaping school.

619
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:00,454
Don't force me or else I
will really run away from home.

620
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:03,156
Yes of course, run away.
Like your father.

621
00:46:03,256 --> 00:46:05,092
Let me talk to him.

622
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:09,329
Do you think we have an ulterior
motive in your attending school?

623
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:11,031
Yes

624
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:13,266
What are you doing?
- Stop behaving like this.

625
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:16,733
Why are you beating him? Please go.

626
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:20,171
Nanhe, sit here.

627
00:46:23,577 --> 00:46:26,569
See today you've hurt our mother.

628
00:46:29,182 --> 00:46:32,752
Do you know why she
insists that you study?

629
00:46:33,353 --> 00:46:35,526
Because she is illiterate.

630
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,058
Our father took
advantage of her illiteracy and...

631
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:41,753
...sold all the
property and ran away.

632
00:46:43,563 --> 00:46:46,099
Raja and her worked very
hard to make ends meet.

633
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,749
Ma'am helped her get odd jobs.

634
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:52,639
Mother took care of
us, built this house.

635
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:56,564
She sent me to school
so that no one dupes me.

636
00:46:57,277 --> 00:46:59,079
Now, if she wants you to
study for the same reason,...

637
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:01,444
...what is wrong with that?

638
00:47:01,544 --> 00:47:04,584
But Uncle too thinks that
education doesn't really help us.

639
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:08,021
It's no surprise that
our uncle should say this.

640
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:11,181
After all he is
our father's brother.

641
00:48:14,554 --> 00:48:17,457
I am delighted that you
have decided to attend school.

642
00:48:17,557 --> 00:48:20,192
There is no right age to learn.

643
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:23,129
Education gives you more
options in life to choose from.

644
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:25,098
Hold still while I
take a quick swig.

645
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:27,238
And life becomes better.

646
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:32,318
What do you want to do
when you can read and write?

647
00:48:32,605 --> 00:48:36,443
I too would like to be a
Member of the Legislative Assembly.

648
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:38,543
And you?

649
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:44,117
If Jassuji aims to be an MLA I sure
can become a Member of Parliament!

650
00:48:44,217 --> 00:48:47,954
Okay, stop being flippant.
What would you like to do?

651
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:51,114
At this age my
memory fails me a lot.

652
00:48:51,524 --> 00:48:55,358
I would like to pen
my poetry on paper.

653
00:48:55,962 --> 00:48:58,863
Very good. And Narayan ji?

654
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:04,437
Basic mathematics will help me
get back into running my business.

655
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:06,558
I am here to learn that.

656
00:49:06,658 --> 00:49:08,971
How about you?

657
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:10,877
I want to join the
army to serve my nation.

658
00:49:10,977 --> 00:49:12,812
Well said.

659
00:49:12,912 --> 00:49:14,214
Sorry, Ma'am!

660
00:49:14,314 --> 00:49:16,314
What do you want to do?

661
00:49:16,983 --> 00:49:19,363
I don't want to do anything.

662
00:49:48,548 --> 00:49:50,846
Come on, let's go.

663
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,886
Friend, I am here.

664
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:04,397
I will not go to school from
tomorrow, no matter what happens.

665
00:50:04,497 --> 00:50:10,367
Nanhe. Come have dinner with us.
How was your first day at school?

666
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:22,984
Leave him be. He will eat when
he's cooled off. You eat. Take it.

667
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:31,891
I am so stupid. When I met you...

668
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:35,731
...I forgot to ask you
where you are staying.

669
00:50:35,995 --> 00:50:41,265
But Jaisalmer isn't so big that
Nanhe Jaisalmer can't find you.

670
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:49,204
Namhe. Open the door.

671
00:50:50,076 --> 00:50:51,277
Leave me alone.

672
00:50:51,377 --> 00:50:53,279
Open the door. This is urgent.

673
00:50:53,379 --> 00:50:54,481
I don't want to hear anything.

674
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:56,581
Nanhe, open it!

675
00:51:06,493 --> 00:51:07,527
What is it?

676
00:51:07,627 --> 00:51:09,857
Look who's here?

677
00:51:14,267 --> 00:51:15,502
Friend!

678
00:51:15,602 --> 00:51:20,106
You were right. He was waiting
for you at seven at Ghadisar Lake.

679
00:51:20,206 --> 00:51:22,206
Told you so.

680
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,144
Can I get you anything?

681
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:26,244
No, nothing, I am okay.

682
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:29,482
You leave now but don't let
mother get to know of this.

683
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:31,582
Okay.

684
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:35,386
Come in.

685
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:40,360
What is this? So
many pictures of me?

686
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,830
When you are not around,
I talk to your pictures.

687
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,457
Really?
- Friend, feel at home.

688
00:51:46,557 --> 00:51:48,968
Tell me, why didn't you come today?

689
00:51:49,068 --> 00:51:52,005
I had to attend school.
Mother forced me to go.

690
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:55,208
You have started going to school?
You didn't write to me about this?

691
00:51:55,308 --> 00:51:59,079
I'm stuck in my mother's
and Madamji's conspiracy.

692
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:01,130
I will not go tomorrow.

693
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,816
Why not?
- Because you are here.

694
00:52:05,218 --> 00:52:08,088
Even my mother used to
force me to go to school.

695
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:11,291
All mothers are alike.
They never understand us.

696
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,391
You are right.

697
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:17,611
Hey, this is our picture.
- Yes

698
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:22,035
Look at the difference between
how you looked earlier and now?

699
00:52:22,135 --> 00:52:23,169
What's that supposed to mean?

700
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:24,471
I mean, you looked much better then.

701
00:52:24,571 --> 00:52:27,206
I see. Let me show you a photo.

702
00:52:31,377 --> 00:52:33,377
Look at this.

703
00:52:35,515 --> 00:52:38,418
Oh, this is my picture.
But how did you recognize me?

704
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:40,353
From your eyes.

705
00:52:40,453 --> 00:52:42,453
How fascinating, Nanhe.

706
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:47,401
Oh, look who else is here.

707
00:52:48,328 --> 00:52:50,864
Nanhe, once I was face
to face with this tiger.

708
00:52:50,964 --> 00:52:57,233
I screamed 'Mr. Tiger' and he
got scared and ran away. Coward.

709
00:52:59,038 --> 00:53:01,774
Mouse. - Not a mouse,
I'm talking about a tiger.

710
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:03,276
A mouse! It's behind the cupboard.

711
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:05,401
A mouse? Where is it?

712
00:53:05,545 --> 00:53:08,081
Behind the cupboard.
- Behind the cupboard?

713
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:09,782
Why are you here then? Go catch it.

714
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:11,284
Why are you here?

715
00:53:11,384 --> 00:53:13,453
To keep an eye on it
in case it gets away.

716
00:53:13,553 --> 00:53:14,854
I'm keeping an eye too.

717
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:16,055
Who will catch it then?

718
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:17,457
You.

719
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:22,997
Nanhe, I can fight a tiger but
the sight of a mouse terrifies me.

720
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:24,964
Me too.

721
00:53:25,064 --> 00:53:27,064
Really?

722
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:31,954
What are you doing?

723
00:53:32,054 --> 00:53:34,588
I'm trying to scare the mouse.

724
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:40,480
Me too.

725
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,580
Really!

726
00:53:43,616 --> 00:53:46,819
Let's try this. You go and
knock loudly on the cupboard.

727
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:47,887
When the mouse runs out...

728
00:53:47,987 --> 00:53:49,022
...I will throw this cloth from
here and we'll trap it. Okay?

729
00:53:49,122 --> 00:53:51,122
Okay?
- Why should I go?

730
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:53,393
Who's older?

731
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:54,761
You.

732
00:53:54,861 --> 00:53:55,895
Who's younger?

733
00:53:55,995 --> 00:53:57,995
I am.
- So, who goes?

734
00:53:58,364 --> 00:54:00,364
Whose idea is it?

735
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:05,536
Okay, I have a plan.

736
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:09,241
Will this plan work?

737
00:54:09,341 --> 00:54:11,293
Why won't it?

738
00:54:11,393 --> 00:54:12,845
That mouse will choose this
piece of bread as its target...

739
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:15,410
...and our goal is the mouse.

740
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:20,853
Nanhe, remember that to
achieve anything in life...

741
00:54:20,953 --> 00:54:24,889
...there must be a
clear goal. Understand?

742
00:54:30,096 --> 00:54:32,096
Where is the mouse?

743
00:54:32,498 --> 00:54:35,058
Friend. -What?
- I need to pee.

744
00:54:36,135 --> 00:54:40,572
Even me. control it,
we will do it later.

745
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:44,275
The mouse!

746
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:46,212
What should we do now?

747
00:54:46,312 --> 00:54:48,414
Let it go. It's just
a mouse after all.

748
00:54:48,514 --> 00:54:50,514
Let it go.
- Ok,

749
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,953
I had so much fun Nanhe.
Am reminded of my childhood.

750
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:57,090
This is just the beginning.
Wait and watch out for more.

751
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,493
Ok listen, I won't be able
to see you at seven tomorrow.

752
00:55:00,593 --> 00:55:03,738
Why?
- The shoot will go on till nine.

753
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:06,833
This suits me best.
Now I can go to school...

754
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:11,137
...which will keep my mother happy,
and I get to spend time with you.

755
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:12,939
Does this mean that
you will study now?

756
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:15,441
No, not at all. I will
go to school to have fun.

757
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,044
Okay then, let me meet
your mother and leave.

758
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:19,779
No, don't meet her.

759
00:55:19,879 --> 00:55:22,429
Why?
- She is annoyed with you.

760
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:25,051
Why? What have you
told her about me?

761
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:28,421
I haven't said anything. She
just has a different point of view.

762
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:30,923
Let me meet her and sort it out.

763
00:55:31,023 --> 00:55:33,793
No. Why do you want to
worsen the situation?

764
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:36,528
Alright then, whatever you say.

765
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,831
You haven't eaten?

766
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:40,900
I had an argument with my mother.

767
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,468
That means she
wouldn't have eaten either.

768
00:55:42,568 --> 00:55:43,870
She wouldn't have eaten... why?

769
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,872
When I sulked and
refused food as a child...

770
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:49,372
...my mother would
also go to bed hungry.

771
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:53,418
All mothers are alike, aren't they?

772
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:55,815
See you tomorrow.
- Good-bye, my friend.

773
00:55:55,915 --> 00:55:57,915
Good-bye.

774
00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:04,422
Mother.

775
00:56:04,524 --> 00:56:05,758
Nanhe.

776
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:07,858
I am hungry.

777
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:11,431
You sit here, I'll warm up the food.

778
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:15,126
I have already done that.

779
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:19,013
But I couldn't have
eaten without you.

780
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:28,203
Did you go to bed hungry?

781
00:56:28,948 --> 00:56:30,249
Who told you that?

782
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:34,089
All sons are the same.
A son like me said so.

783
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,095
Hey Nanhe...

784
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:43,796
Look at my biceps...

785
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:46,799
...they are no less
than your Bobby Deol's.

786
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:48,899
Look.

787
00:56:49,302 --> 00:56:57,402
Welcome to my land...

788
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,779
Ma'am has not reached yet.

789
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:02,815
She will come sooner or later.
First you come here...

790
00:57:02,915 --> 00:57:06,740
...take a few swigs and
let's start the party.

791
00:57:06,853 --> 00:57:11,613
What party and what swigs? I
pray that you quit drinking.

792
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:15,382
If your prayers
have so much power,...

793
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:19,031
...let's see you use
them to rock the Fort.

794
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:24,771
Or just take two swigs of this
and watch the fort rock on its own.

795
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:27,166
Stop joking, on one hand...

796
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:33,043
Who is this?

797
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:53,366
Isn't it wonderful that we have
women attending night school too?

798
00:57:53,466 --> 00:57:56,186
How do you do? I'm Durjan Singh.

799
00:58:00,907 --> 00:58:02,907
That must've hurt.

800
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,478
What's going on here?

801
00:58:05,578 --> 00:58:07,578
Hide this, quick.

802
00:58:11,217 --> 00:58:13,342
Where is Dhurinder today?

803
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,055
Good evening, Ma'am.

804
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:19,318
Dhurinder! -What on
earth is going on?

805
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:23,362
Nothing really. We were
just settling an old score.

806
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:25,364
Change your clothes
and get back right away!

807
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:27,464
Yes, Ma'am.

808
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:40,947
Nanhe, hold still
while I take a quick swig.

809
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,087
What is happening there?

810
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:49,288
Just taking a sip of my
'medicine' for my ache.

811
00:58:49,388 --> 00:58:51,856
Where is the pain?

812
00:58:53,025 --> 00:58:54,093
Right here.

813
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:56,193
Yes, that's it.

814
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,430
School was fun today.

815
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,220
There is everything but studies.

816
00:59:04,437 --> 00:59:07,412
Motu, why don't you come to school?

817
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:11,043
That Magghu.

818
00:59:11,143 --> 00:59:12,979
Magghu does not come to school.

819
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:14,447
Not school... Magghu

820
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:17,116
Does Magghu frighten you so much?

821
00:59:17,216 --> 00:59:19,216
To hell with him.

822
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:25,142
My dear students, were
you talking about me?

823
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:28,127
That you are so kind.
- Indeed, I am.

824
00:59:28,227 --> 00:59:31,457
Come on, cough up my
share of your tip.

825
00:59:32,098 --> 00:59:33,132
But

826
00:59:33,232 --> 00:59:34,367
...this is Motu's money.

827
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:37,782
Hey Nanhe... you are
trying to teach me.

828
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,943
Durjan is convinced that your
well-built body is unconvincing.

829
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:45,511
What was your reply?

830
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:50,796
I told him that if he got one
whack he'd see stars in the day.

831
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,550
Get off.

832
01:00:02,261 --> 01:00:04,196
I have to work hard for this.

833
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:10,076
When I grow up and I have biceps
like yours, I will not spare Magghu.

834
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:12,405
Is Magghu still
giving you a hard time?

835
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,874
Earlier he used to make
us walk like chickens...

836
01:00:14,974 --> 01:00:20,074
...hit us with his catapult but
today he snatched Motu's tip.

837
01:00:20,513 --> 01:00:21,981
So why don't you stop him?

838
01:00:22,081 --> 01:00:27,553
Because he's older than us and we're
scared. But wait till I grow up.

839
01:00:27,653 --> 01:00:30,323
A grown up can
always show his strength.

840
01:00:30,423 --> 01:00:33,125
Our biggest asset is our intellect.

841
01:00:33,225 --> 01:00:35,027
If we apply our mind correctly...

842
01:00:35,127 --> 01:00:37,196
...we can teach a lesson
to ten boys like Magghu.

843
01:00:37,296 --> 01:00:39,296
How?

844
01:00:40,132 --> 01:00:42,132
Break this stick.

845
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:49,232
Now break these
five sticks together.

846
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:51,277
You couldn't break them?

847
01:00:51,377 --> 01:00:53,279
This is the power of the collective.

848
01:00:53,379 --> 01:00:57,783
Once united, neither Nanhe Jaisalmer
nor Bobby Deol can break them.

849
01:00:57,883 --> 01:00:59,883
Come here.

850
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:05,155
Ok.

851
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:06,993
Safari

852
01:01:07,093 --> 01:01:08,127
In a while.

853
01:01:08,227 --> 01:01:10,129
Okay sir. Thank you. Thank you.

854
01:01:10,229 --> 01:01:14,033
Maggu? - Who's that? -
Motu will take this safari.

855
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:15,835
What? Have you lost your mind?

856
01:01:15,935 --> 01:01:17,960
Motu, take this safari.

857
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,538
No, no, no.

858
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:22,868
Have you gone nuts?
Wait where you are.

859
01:01:42,528 --> 01:01:44,738
Get up. Let's go.
- No, no.

860
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,158
All together?

861
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:58,640
So, you want to challenge me?

862
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:13,793
You can only target us one at a time
but we will target you all at once.

863
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:15,893
I'll tackle you later.

864
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,434
Wait.

865
01:02:44,423 --> 01:02:46,888
Now, Motu is square with you.

866
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,077
Start walking like a chicken.

867
01:02:50,177 --> 01:02:54,974
What? - Did you not hear us? Start
walking like a chicken.

868
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,605
This is how Magghu was...

869
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:16,422
I had a great time. Magghu
used to scare the life out of us.

870
01:03:16,522 --> 01:03:20,993
Fear, anxiety, apprehension
are manifestations of the mind.

871
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:23,983
You feel what your mind makes you.

872
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:29,791
If our mental faculties are strong
we can face all odds. Understand?

873
01:03:31,237 --> 01:03:33,806
Give me too.
- Yes, of course, take it.

874
01:03:33,906 --> 01:03:36,876
What happened?
- No, this is not for you.

875
01:03:36,976 --> 01:03:39,945
Why? If you can eat it so can I.
- This is not good.

876
01:03:40,045 --> 01:03:44,016
So why do you eat it?
- It is a habit, that's why.

877
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:46,318
It's not good for you, you
still eat it because it's a habit?

878
01:03:46,418 --> 01:03:48,713
I haven't quite understood.

879
01:03:50,356 --> 01:03:53,404
Stop thinking so much.
Give it to me.

880
01:03:53,504 --> 01:03:55,492
Friend.

881
01:03:57,529 --> 01:03:59,529
We both won't eat it.

882
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:26,022
Since we became
friends life is full of joy

883
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:35,857
Since we became
friends life is full of joy

884
01:04:36,635 --> 01:04:41,038
My little friend

885
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:45,370
My little friend

886
01:04:45,978 --> 01:04:49,379
My little friend

887
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:59,416
If you ask once I will
lay down my life for you

888
01:04:59,925 --> 01:05:04,157
My little friend

889
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:08,526
My little friend

890
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:13,467
My little friend

891
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:41,231
Our friendship stays constant

892
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:46,269
The world is jealous of us

893
01:05:46,405 --> 01:05:50,341
as friendship like ours is rare

894
01:05:51,143 --> 01:05:55,307
Ignore their envy

895
01:05:55,848 --> 01:05:59,909
We should not have
to face any hurdles

896
01:06:00,152 --> 01:06:06,284
For you I will take on the world

897
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:16,231
Since we became
friends life is full of joy

898
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:20,999
My little friend

899
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,438
My little friend

900
01:06:25,978 --> 01:06:30,244
My little friend

901
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:34,918
My little friend

902
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:39,917
My little friend

903
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:51,401
When will she come?

904
01:06:51,537 --> 01:06:54,206
Do you know who is
coming to my sister's wedding?

905
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:56,331
Who?
- My friend!

906
01:06:56,442 --> 01:06:58,243
Wow.
- Really?

907
01:06:58,343 --> 01:06:59,979
This time I will show him my biceps.

908
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:05,689
First, you have to spruce up a bit.
Don't wear your tattered shoes.

909
01:07:07,586 --> 01:07:11,666
I want all of you to
look your best like Jassuji.

910
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:15,251
So you mean like Jassuji and me.

911
01:07:15,527 --> 01:07:19,692
No, not you. Have you
looked in the mirror lately?

912
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Please do shave.

913
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:26,303
You are right.

914
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:32,906
But why are you inviting everyone
if they are such an embarrassment.

915
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:35,445
Let it go.
- Why should we?

916
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:38,384
Are we not presentable
enough to match up to his friend?

917
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:40,484
Is he a rich man?

918
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:43,255
Why do you make a
mountain out of a molehill?

919
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:47,180
You know what? I will
not attend this wedding.

920
01:07:48,427 --> 01:07:51,797
And after what you have just said
I doubt anyone else will either.

921
01:07:51,897 --> 01:07:54,867
Fine by me. I really don't
care whether you come or don't.

922
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:58,504
And yes he is more important
than all of you put together.

923
01:07:58,604 --> 01:08:00,139
My son, stop being so angry.

924
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:02,174
That's enough. Who are they?

925
01:08:02,274 --> 01:08:03,876
Do they think that
going to night school...

926
01:08:03,976 --> 01:08:07,446
...will make them as
important as my friend?

927
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:08,881
Will Narayanji really run
a shop or will Bhopalaji...

928
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:11,276
...ever publish his poetry?

929
01:08:12,584 --> 01:08:14,319
They are all older than you.

930
01:08:14,419 --> 01:08:16,889
So what? Who are
you to sermonize me...

931
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:20,219
...when you are
drunk most of the time?

932
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:23,328
Nanhe.
- What Nanhe?

933
01:08:23,428 --> 01:08:25,097
I don't need any of you.

934
01:08:25,197 --> 01:08:28,834
Let Ma'am know that I am
not returning to this class.

935
01:08:28,934 --> 01:08:30,934
Nanhe.

936
01:08:33,172 --> 01:08:35,297
School ended early today?

937
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:38,010
I got into a fierce
argument with Khemaji and others.

938
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,660
They spoke nonsense about you.

939
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,815
And you fought with them?
- Yes.

940
01:08:44,616 --> 01:08:46,852
You lost four friends for one.

941
01:08:46,952 --> 01:08:50,422
Sir, your shot is ready.
- Coming. - Okay, sir.

942
01:08:50,522 --> 01:08:55,461
It's easy to make a friend but
very tough to keep the friendship.

943
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:58,281
I'll be back after the shot. Ok.

944
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,399
Where is the shot?

945
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:07,873
Show him some
authentic Rajasthani pieces...

946
01:09:07,973 --> 01:09:11,310
...my boss here wants to
gift one to his girlfriend.

947
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:14,113
See this... - My sister needs
surgery and I desperately need money.

948
01:09:14,213 --> 01:09:16,213
Hey, you again.
- Stop.

949
01:09:16,915 --> 01:09:18,383
Give him the money.
- But sir...

950
01:09:18,483 --> 01:09:20,819
But you were to give a
present to your girlfriend today.

951
01:09:20,919 --> 01:09:22,888
So what if my girlfriend
doesn't get a present...

952
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:26,133
...at least a
brother gets his sister.

953
01:09:27,526 --> 01:09:29,526
Cut it, brilliant...

954
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:31,296
Subhash, will you
bring my jacket please?

955
01:09:31,396 --> 01:09:33,098
Nanhe, how did you like my shot?

956
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:35,198
Friend you are a hit.

957
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:38,537
Sir, I forgot it in Bombay.

958
01:09:38,637 --> 01:09:41,697
Okay, then get me a shawl.
- Yes sir.

959
01:09:50,349 --> 01:09:52,644
Please give me that jacket.

960
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:54,086
How much is it?

961
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:55,220
Please give me a small discount.

962
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:00,859
Give you a discount? Get lost, buy
the jacket when you have the money.

963
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,862
See if you can
reduce the price a little.

964
01:10:03,962 --> 01:10:06,365
If a horse befriends the
grass, what will he eat?

965
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:08,465
Get lost.

966
01:10:12,904 --> 01:10:18,599
Raja, I must buy that jacket for
my friend, let's look for tourists.

967
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:33,449
Nanhe! - Yes. - You are a smart lad
, you speak four languages.

968
01:10:34,452 --> 01:10:36,452
Learn from him.

969
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:44,925
Come on, move...

970
01:10:45,029 --> 01:10:48,899
This horse doesn't know how to
run fast, I think it's a donkey.

971
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:53,004
This is not a donkey, he's a
camel and his name means 'King'.

972
01:10:53,104 --> 01:10:55,104
So, where is his queen?

973
01:10:56,373 --> 01:10:57,942
Make it run.

974
01:10:58,042 --> 01:11:00,252
You want him to run?
- Yes.

975
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:03,579
Raja

976
01:11:05,382 --> 01:11:07,382
Stop, please stop him.

977
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:15,226
Somebody save us. Somebody save us.

978
01:11:15,326 --> 01:11:17,326
Raja!

979
01:11:17,595 --> 01:11:19,595
Mother.

980
01:11:34,011 --> 01:11:36,011
What are you doing?

981
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:38,849
We're making tattoos.

982
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:42,920
I know that. In the village we
write our names on our arms.

983
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,456
Yes, exactly like that. You
haven't had your name written?

984
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,925
No.
- Should we write it for you?

985
01:11:48,025 --> 01:11:50,425
Yes, on both Raja and me.

986
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:54,062
How are you?
- Ok.

987
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,160
What happened? Why are you laughing?

988
01:11:59,937 --> 01:12:01,539
What's written on Raja?

989
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:03,639
His name, what else?

990
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:05,908
His name?

991
01:12:06,644 --> 01:12:09,109
Have a look, that's his name.

992
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,883
Have a look, that's his name.

993
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:20,858
What's so funny? Even
I got my name written.

994
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,958
That's good.

995
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,298
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

996
01:13:01,398 --> 01:13:06,005
Ma'am, come here. - What's
happened? - Ma'am, come here.

997
01:13:06,105 --> 01:13:08,129
What's written on Raja?

998
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,107
Who has done this?

999
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:14,078
First tell me what is written
here and why is everyone laughing?

1000
01:13:14,178 --> 01:13:17,477
This reads 'donkey'

1001
01:13:26,924 --> 01:13:28,924
And this?

1002
01:13:33,564 --> 01:13:37,056
'And I am a bigger donkey.'

1003
01:15:32,249 --> 01:15:34,249
Nanhe.

1004
01:15:34,918 --> 01:15:36,918
Friend.

1005
01:15:38,088 --> 01:15:41,492
Mohan mentioned that everyone in
the bazaar was laughing at you.

1006
01:15:41,592 --> 01:15:43,827
What did I do to deserve that?

1007
01:15:43,927 --> 01:15:46,330
Why did they play such
a dirty trick on me?

1008
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:50,167
They called my Raja a donkey,
I did not retaliate.

1009
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:53,072
Still they wrote 'donkey' on him.

1010
01:15:54,338 --> 01:16:01,005
Don't cry. They did not
mock you but your illiteracy.

1011
01:16:01,879 --> 01:16:03,879
But why?

1012
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:08,275
Because that's the truth.

1013
01:16:12,556 --> 01:16:17,357
Everyone has weaknesses and flaws.

1014
01:16:18,228 --> 01:16:21,883
But life gives us a
chance to correct those.

1015
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,437
Either you should not complain
about people who poke fun at you...

1016
01:16:26,537 --> 01:16:30,192
...or you don't give
them a chance to do so.

1017
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:33,944
But, it's difficult for me
to concentrate on studies.

1018
01:16:34,044 --> 01:16:40,608
Nothing is easy. The day you decide
you want to achieve something...

1019
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:44,355
...you will have to believe in it.

1020
01:16:44,455 --> 01:16:45,889
And the same belief
will become your...

1021
01:16:45,989 --> 01:16:49,219
...strength and
guide you to your goal.

1022
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:52,907
Now the decision is yours...

1023
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:58,466
...whether you want to give up
your weakness or live with it.

1024
01:17:04,274 --> 01:17:06,367
I have made my decision.

1025
01:17:10,347 --> 01:17:12,347
Nanhe.

1026
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:15,919
Good-bye.

1027
01:17:16,019 --> 01:17:18,019
Good-bye, my friend.

1028
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:24,388
K...
- K... - Kh... - Kh... - Ga...

1029
01:17:24,495 --> 01:17:26,030
Ga...
- Gha... -

1030
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:29,122
Gha...
- Kna. - Kna.

1031
01:17:29,633 --> 01:17:32,932
Cha...
- Cha. - Chha... - Chha...

1032
01:17:33,036 --> 01:17:36,335
Ja...
- Ja... - Jha... - Jha.

1033
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,540
Yna...
- Yna.

1034
01:17:46,517 --> 01:17:48,517
Ma'am...

1035
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:54,923
I want to study.

1036
01:18:00,197 --> 01:18:02,197
Come, sit.

1037
01:18:15,345 --> 01:18:18,280
Cha...
- Cha. - Chha... - Chha...

1038
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:21,110
Ja...
- Ja... - Jha... - Jha.

1039
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:22,252
Yna...
- Yna.

1040
01:18:22,352 --> 01:18:25,047
Cha...
- Cha. - Chha... - Chha...

1041
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:29,081
Ja...
- Ja... - Jha... - Jha.

1042
01:18:29,193 --> 01:18:31,923
Yna...
- Yna.

1043
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:34,932
Nanhe, hold still
while I take a quick swig.

1044
01:18:35,032 --> 01:18:37,032
Uncle.

1045
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:41,905
Our Nanhe Jaisalmer.

1046
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:45,943
Victory will be ours
since we have made a start...

1047
01:18:46,043 --> 01:18:51,228
...celebrations are close at
hand since we have taken a stand.

1048
01:18:59,923 --> 01:19:02,255
Today is a new beginning.

1049
01:19:28,385 --> 01:19:31,411
This is Ka... this is Kha...

1050
01:19:33,423 --> 01:19:38,183
This is Kha... this is Ga...
this is Gha and this is Kna.

1051
01:19:42,065 --> 01:19:49,028
This is Kha... this is Ga...
Gha and this is Kna.

1052
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:51,439
Nanhe! Nanhe!

1053
01:19:51,942 --> 01:19:52,976
Yes mother.

1054
01:19:53,076 --> 01:19:54,478
Whose tobacco is this?

1055
01:19:54,578 --> 01:20:00,188
It's mine but you can throw it
away because I don't eat it anymore.

1056
01:20:00,384 --> 01:20:02,944
Your Nanhe has changed.

1057
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:45,287
Like a lover who calls his beloved
from the banks of River Chenab

1058
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:51,393
My heart yearns for
you in the same manner

1059
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:04,548
Like a lover who calls his beloved
from the banks of River Chenab

1060
01:21:04,648 --> 01:21:09,881
My heart yearns for
you in the same manner

1061
01:21:17,928 --> 01:21:21,386
My eyes see only you

1062
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:24,956
You are everywhere I go

1063
01:21:25,202 --> 01:21:28,501
My eyes see only you

1064
01:21:28,672 --> 01:21:32,164
You are everywhere I go

1065
01:21:32,376 --> 01:21:37,247
Like a lover who calls his beloved
from the banks of River Chenab

1066
01:21:37,347 --> 01:21:42,307
My heart yearns for
you in the same manner

1067
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:15,318
Without you I don't wish to live

1068
01:22:15,986 --> 01:22:19,478
Without you I don't wish to live

1069
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:24,458
Its only you in my eyes

1070
01:22:24,561 --> 01:22:28,122
Every moment, its you I breathe

1071
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:31,994
My eyes see only you

1072
01:22:32,135 --> 01:22:35,536
You are everywhere I go

1073
01:22:35,972 --> 01:22:40,577
Like a lover who calls his beloved
from the banks of River Chenab

1074
01:22:40,677 --> 01:22:46,081
My heart yearns for
you in the same manner

1075
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:58,994
"Oh beloved..."

1076
01:23:31,127 --> 01:23:36,233
Tomorrow I will test you on math
tables from 2 to 5 and the alphabets.

1077
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:39,053
Is it fine with you?
- Yes Ma'am.

1078
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:50,280
Here come the exams...

1079
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:53,450
...now Ma'am will finally
figure out how keen we are to study.

1080
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:56,787
What are you saying?
Who wants to progress?

1081
01:23:56,887 --> 01:24:00,791
I just want to sit in class
and listen to Ma'am's voice.

1082
01:24:00,891 --> 01:24:01,992
Why don't you propose to her?

1083
01:24:02,092 --> 01:24:05,028
She'll take you home,
teach you and feed you.

1084
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:07,153
Nanhe.
- What happened?

1085
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:09,531
You must be really sad.

1086
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:13,537
Why should I be sad? In fact,
I am extremely happy.

1087
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:16,473
But I thought you love
Raja more than anything.

1088
01:24:16,573 --> 01:24:19,075
What happened to Raja?
- Don't you know? - No.

1089
01:24:19,175 --> 01:24:21,300
Raja...
- Nanhe! - Raja...

1090
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:23,013
Raja...

1091
01:24:23,113 --> 01:24:25,113
Where is Raja?

1092
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:27,484
He's gone.

1093
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:29,584
Where?

1094
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:32,889
This unfortunate mother
had to sell one of her sons...

1095
01:24:32,989 --> 01:24:35,624
...to get her daughter married.

1096
01:24:39,996 --> 01:24:41,996
I had no choice.

1097
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,600
I had no choice.

1098
01:24:54,544 --> 01:24:56,544
Nanhe.

1099
01:24:58,381 --> 01:25:00,381
Our uncle deceived us.

1100
01:25:11,628 --> 01:25:15,029
Friend, my Raja has gone.

1101
01:25:17,901 --> 01:25:20,706
How will mother live without him?

1102
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:27,599
He was her elder son. No one
will be happy without him.

1103
01:25:30,413 --> 01:25:33,813
Friend, please help
me. What should I do?

1104
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,150
What should I do?

1105
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,822
What should I do, friend?

1106
01:25:38,922 --> 01:25:40,891
So what if my girlfriend
doesn't get a present...

1107
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:44,136
...at least a
brother gets his sister.

1108
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:00,041
Give me some jaggery.

1109
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:05,079
Raja...

1110
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:10,351
Raja, my son, you are back.

1111
01:26:21,297 --> 01:26:23,867
Nanhe. - So what if I didn't buy a
present for my friend...

1112
01:26:23,967 --> 01:26:28,642
...at least I reunited mother
and son. What say, sister?

1113
01:26:38,014 --> 01:26:40,817
Give these wedding
invitations to your classmates.

1114
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:42,519
I need another one.

1115
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:44,744
For whom?
- For my friend.

1116
01:26:54,264 --> 01:26:56,264
You have a cough.

1117
01:27:26,262 --> 01:27:28,812
There's an insect on your arm.

1118
01:27:29,899 --> 01:27:32,163
It's gone. Keep writing.

1119
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,550
What have you written?

1120
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:57,525
Nothing. Take a look.

1121
01:28:03,433 --> 01:28:05,101
Turn in your answer sheets.

1122
01:28:05,201 --> 01:28:07,201
Stand up.

1123
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:10,238
Oh lord.

1124
01:28:11,007 --> 01:28:13,217
Finally, the exam is over.

1125
01:28:17,413 --> 01:28:20,917
Well done, you
remember the math tables well.

1126
01:28:21,017 --> 01:28:23,017
Very good.

1127
01:28:24,587 --> 01:28:26,587
Jassuji.
- Yes Ma'am.

1128
01:28:27,423 --> 01:28:32,462
What is this? You've been stuck in
the same place for three years now.

1129
01:28:32,562 --> 01:28:35,298
With your grace. - Get lost.- I
will learn by next year Ma'am.

1130
01:28:35,398 --> 01:28:37,167
Khemaji. Khemaji. You come here.

1131
01:28:37,267 --> 01:28:41,432
Show me your answer sheet.
- I was just on my way.

1132
01:28:41,704 --> 01:28:45,578
Same thing. Were you
writing Jassuji's answers?

1133
01:28:45,678 --> 01:28:48,270
Cheat? Me? How could I?

1134
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:51,877
Even to cheat you need brains.

1135
01:28:51,981 --> 01:28:53,981
Go away.

1136
01:28:56,419 --> 01:28:58,419
Nanhe.

1137
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:05,061
What is this? You
haven't written a word.

1138
01:29:05,161 --> 01:29:07,966
He has also not written anything.

1139
01:29:08,298 --> 01:29:12,633
I had great expectations
of you. You worked so hard.

1140
01:29:14,671 --> 01:29:17,902
Maybe my efforts
were not good enough.

1141
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:25,047
This is what I wrote.

1142
01:29:52,442 --> 01:29:54,967
You've written this?

1143
01:29:55,211 --> 01:29:57,336
Yes, I have written this.

1144
01:29:57,914 --> 01:30:00,542
What has he written?

1145
01:30:01,084 --> 01:30:03,084
What is it?

1146
01:30:03,186 --> 01:30:09,284
'For my friend Bobby Deol',
Nanhe Jaisalmer and Raja Jaisalmer.'

1147
01:30:09,392 --> 01:30:12,293
Well done.

1148
01:30:12,495 --> 01:30:15,131
Nanhe has written a whole sentence.

1149
01:30:15,231 --> 01:30:17,231
That is wonderful!

1150
01:30:20,169 --> 01:30:21,971
Well done!

1151
01:30:22,071 --> 01:30:24,071
Well done!

1152
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:27,541
Can I leave now?

1153
01:30:29,445 --> 01:30:32,073
Friend... Friend... My friend!

1154
01:30:33,116 --> 01:30:35,116
Friend... Friend...

1155
01:30:35,618 --> 01:30:38,382
Friend... Friend...

1156
01:30:39,155 --> 01:30:40,523
Friend... Friend...

1157
01:30:40,623 --> 01:30:41,891
Friend... Friend...

1158
01:30:41,991 --> 01:30:44,456
This is for you.
- What is it?

1159
01:30:46,963 --> 01:30:48,364
This is Suman's wedding invite.

1160
01:30:48,464 --> 01:30:50,844
Take a look at the envelope.

1161
01:30:52,635 --> 01:30:55,972
'For my friend Bobby Deol',
Nanhe Jaisalmer...

1162
01:30:56,072 --> 01:30:59,727
...and Raja Jaisalmer.'
You've written this?

1163
01:30:59,909 --> 01:31:02,374
Yes. And only because of you.

1164
01:31:05,081 --> 01:31:10,691
You had to walk bare feet on hot
sand to know why you needed shoes.

1165
01:31:13,122 --> 01:31:15,122
Mouse.
- Mouse?

1166
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:21,097
Naughty boy, you scared me.
- Let me go. Let me go. Let me go.

1167
01:31:21,197 --> 01:31:23,366
Friend, will you attend the wedding?

1168
01:31:23,466 --> 01:31:25,969
Let Suman know that her
elder brother will be there.

1169
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:28,371
Will you let me meet
your mother this time?

1170
01:31:28,471 --> 01:31:32,041
Yes, now she is not
angry with you anymore.

1171
01:31:32,141 --> 01:31:35,907
It stays unbroken

1172
01:31:36,179 --> 01:31:39,080
Love is one such bond

1173
01:31:51,094 --> 01:31:54,427
Every instant, every moment, love

1174
01:31:54,897 --> 01:31:58,128
I will die for you

1175
01:31:58,901 --> 01:32:02,393
Everyday of my life

1176
01:32:06,909 --> 01:32:10,970
Everyday of my life

1177
01:32:14,584 --> 01:32:22,992
Of my daily life, I
want you to be a part.

1178
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:58,253
Since I've seen you

1179
01:32:58,494 --> 01:33:02,157
I've only thought of you

1180
01:33:02,498 --> 01:33:06,264
You are my realm of dreams

1181
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:09,996
I only wish for you

1182
01:33:10,573 --> 01:33:14,100
You stay in my thoughts

1183
01:33:14,477 --> 01:33:17,878
You are my passion

1184
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:21,143
Every instant, every moment, love

1185
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:25,046
I will die for you

1186
01:33:25,488 --> 01:33:33,361
Of my daily life, I
want you to be a part.

1187
01:34:03,993 --> 01:34:07,224
My heart knows

1188
01:34:07,463 --> 01:34:11,126
the pain of separation

1189
01:34:11,434 --> 01:34:15,302
my heartbeat yearns for you

1190
01:34:15,605 --> 01:34:19,090
Without you, my days
and nights are lonely

1191
01:34:19,408 --> 01:34:23,037
I am breathless without you.

1192
01:34:23,246 --> 01:34:26,549
My heart threatens to
stop beating without you.

1193
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:30,085
Every instant, every moment, love

1194
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:33,914
I will die for you

1195
01:34:34,223 --> 01:34:42,528
Of my daily life, I
want you to be a part.

1196
01:34:46,202 --> 01:34:53,870
Of my daily life, I
want you to be a part.

1197
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:06,117
Of my daily life, I
want you to be a part.

1198
01:35:11,294 --> 01:35:16,322
Since we became friends

1199
01:35:17,466 --> 01:35:22,870
Life is full of joy

1200
01:35:24,006 --> 01:35:34,280
My little friend.

1201
01:35:35,618 --> 01:35:37,618
Nanhe... Nanhe...

1202
01:35:38,154 --> 01:35:40,449
Sorry, my friend, I'm late.

1203
01:35:40,623 --> 01:35:46,573
Today was the last day and we were
forced to finish. Please forgive me.

1204
01:35:47,096 --> 01:35:50,372
I told everyone that
you would be there.

1205
01:35:50,472 --> 01:35:53,870
I wasn't coming to the
wedding for anyone but you.

1206
01:35:53,970 --> 01:35:56,906
Let's go meet your mother and
let me apologize to her as well.

1207
01:35:57,006 --> 01:35:59,006
But you promised me.

1208
01:35:59,442 --> 01:36:04,528
Yes and I wasn't able to keep
the promise because of my work.

1209
01:36:04,628 --> 01:36:09,152
I couldn't have inconvenienced
others to keep my friend happy.

1210
01:36:09,252 --> 01:36:12,907
But as you say it's
easy to make a friend...

1211
01:36:13,222 --> 01:36:16,622
...but very tough to
keep the friendship.

1212
01:36:16,926 --> 01:36:20,862
I am proud of you.
You have grown up.

1213
01:36:22,632 --> 01:36:25,368
You have a burning
desire to learn and grow.

1214
01:36:25,468 --> 01:36:28,188
You must keep that going always.

1215
01:36:28,537 --> 01:36:33,873
Remember that with friends
one should learn to forgive.

1216
01:36:35,278 --> 01:36:37,278
I'm sorry again.

1217
01:36:38,047 --> 01:36:43,508
Keep writing to me, I'll
wait for your letters. Good-bye.

1218
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:50,265
Friendship has another meaning too.

1219
01:36:57,366 --> 01:36:59,366
No sorry.

1220
01:37:00,936 --> 01:37:02,305
When will you come back?

1221
01:37:02,405 --> 01:37:05,107
This time you will have
to visit me in Bombay.

1222
01:37:05,207 --> 01:37:07,402
Nanhe. Nanhe.

1223
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:09,845
Friend, meet Ma and
let her know that...

1224
01:37:09,945 --> 01:37:13,916
...you are inviting me to
Bombay or else she won't let me go.

1225
01:37:14,016 --> 01:37:16,016
Okay friend? Please.

1226
01:37:16,552 --> 01:37:19,578
Talking to your friend again?

1227
01:37:20,156 --> 01:37:22,791
Yes, meet my friend Bobby Deol.

1228
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,450
You forgot to send him the invite.

1229
01:37:29,965 --> 01:37:34,237
I know that he did not make
it to the shoot this time...

1230
01:37:34,337 --> 01:37:38,162
...but I am sure he
will come some other time.

1231
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:43,046
Or you go visit him in
Bombay at the end of this year.

1232
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:44,380
But my friend is...

1233
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:49,417
Nanhe!
- Yes. - You are my hero.

1234
01:37:52,321 --> 01:37:56,061
I am so proud that you
have started studying,

1235
01:37:56,192 --> 01:38:00,612
...you have grown to be
such a responsible young man.

1236
01:38:05,368 --> 01:38:06,902
Go to bed. You have
to wake up early to...

1237
01:38:07,002 --> 01:38:09,505
...visit your sister in her new home.

1238
01:38:09,605 --> 01:38:11,605
Go to bed.

1239
01:38:46,509 --> 01:38:48,010
Nanhe Jaisalmer.

1240
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:50,110
Friend.

1241
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:05,008
Raja, this really is my friend

1242
01:39:05,561 --> 01:39:07,897
Bobby Deol's new movie 'Yaar' was...

1243
01:39:07,997 --> 01:39:11,567
...launched at a five
star hotel in Mumbai.

1244
01:39:14,937 --> 01:39:16,937
Friend.

1245
01:39:17,306 --> 01:39:22,244
You were right, he was waiting
for you at Ghadisar Lake at seven.

1246
01:39:22,344 --> 01:39:26,482
I told you that he'd be waiting
for me at Ghadisar Lake at seven.

1247
01:39:26,582 --> 01:39:30,662
When you are not around,
I talk to your pictures.

1248
01:39:31,053 --> 01:39:34,453
The shoot for this
film begins next week.

1249
01:39:42,698 --> 01:39:45,588
Today he snatched Motu's tip away.

1250
01:39:46,068 --> 01:39:47,937
So, why don't you stop him?

1251
01:39:48,037 --> 01:39:52,287
Because he's older than us
and we're scared of him.

1252
01:39:53,275 --> 01:39:55,478
The first thirty days of shoot...

1253
01:39:55,578 --> 01:39:58,479
Friend, this is for you.

1254
01:40:00,416 --> 01:40:05,020
...may be in Jaisalmer and
Barmer districts of Rajasthan.

1255
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:07,089
I got into an argument
with Khemaji and others.

1256
01:40:07,189 --> 01:40:09,739
They spoke nonsense about you.

1257
01:40:10,326 --> 01:40:12,326
Yes.

1258
01:40:32,214 --> 01:40:37,853
I had a great time my friend, Magghu
used to scare the life out of us.

1259
01:40:37,953 --> 01:40:39,522
You make me wait far too
long between meetings.

1260
01:40:39,622 --> 01:40:41,323
Ma, he is my friend.

1261
01:40:41,423 --> 01:40:44,226
I know that he did not make
it to the shoot this time.

1262
01:40:44,326 --> 01:40:46,929
The first thirty days of
shoot may be in Jaisalmer...

1263
01:40:47,029 --> 01:40:49,465
...and Barmer districts of Rajasthan.

1264
01:40:49,565 --> 01:40:55,175
Of course, he'll come. He will
come to meet me. And I believe that.

1265
01:41:05,548 --> 01:41:06,882
That mouse will choose this
piece of bread as its target...

1266
01:41:06,982 --> 01:41:09,447
...and our goal is the mouse.

1267
01:41:09,585 --> 01:41:11,887
Nanhe, remember that
to achieve anything...

1268
01:41:11,987 --> 01:41:15,132
...in life there
must be a clear goal.

1269
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:18,127
To achieve anything in life
there must be a clear goal.

1270
01:41:18,227 --> 01:41:20,227
And this was my target.

1271
01:41:23,532 --> 01:41:24,900
In this film I play an
illiterate villager...

1272
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,270
...whose friend helps him
emerge from ignorance.

1273
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:30,272
lnteresting... with
help from a friend.

1274
01:41:30,372 --> 01:41:32,372
No...

1275
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:37,413
Our greatest
strength is our intellect.

1276
01:41:37,513 --> 01:41:40,743
Our greatest
strength is our intellect.

1277
01:41:43,953 --> 01:41:44,987
If we apply our mind correctly...

1278
01:41:45,087 --> 01:41:47,857
...we can fight every
insecurity in life.

1279
01:41:47,957 --> 01:41:49,391
If you apply your mind correctly...

1280
01:41:49,491 --> 01:41:53,316
...we can teach ten
boys like Magghu a lesson.

1281
01:41:53,495 --> 01:41:54,997
What is in the scene?

1282
01:41:55,097 --> 01:41:59,335
Sir in this scene, you give away
your money to help your friend.

1283
01:41:59,435 --> 01:42:00,870
So what if my girlfriend
doesn't get a present...

1284
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:04,115
...at least a
brother gets his sister.

1285
01:42:06,642 --> 01:42:09,111
Each of us has flaws and weaknesses.

1286
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:11,881
But life gives us a
chance to correct those.

1287
01:42:11,981 --> 01:42:15,041
Each of us has flaws and weaknesses.

1288
01:42:15,484 --> 01:42:19,139
But life gives us a
chance to correct those.

1289
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:26,562
Your parents, your siblings... are
relationships determined by God.

1290
01:42:26,662 --> 01:42:30,199
Friendship is the only
relationship that we choose.

1291
01:42:30,299 --> 01:42:34,904
It is easy to make a friend
but tough to keep the friendship.

1292
01:42:35,004 --> 01:42:40,104
It is easy to make friends but
hard to keep their friendship.

1293
01:42:49,518 --> 01:42:52,254
I know that he did not make
it to the shoot this time.

1294
01:42:52,354 --> 01:42:53,956
You really think he will come

1295
01:42:54,056 --> 01:42:58,127
Of course, he'll come. He will
come to meet me. And I believe that.

1296
01:42:58,227 --> 01:43:04,132
I believe that.

1297
01:43:11,306 --> 01:43:15,811
If our belief is strong enough,
our minds have the power to imagine.

1298
01:43:15,911 --> 01:43:18,881
When the conviction runs deep our
imagination turns into reality...

1299
01:43:18,981 --> 01:43:22,211
...and takes us
wherever we want to go.

1300
01:43:23,218 --> 01:43:25,888
This was the story
of Nanhe Jaisalmer...

1301
01:43:25,988 --> 01:43:27,890
...whose belief turned
his dream into reality...

1302
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:30,625
...and guided him through life.

1303
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:56,635
I call upon the guest of evening
to felicitate Mr. Vikram Singh.

1304
01:44:10,566 --> 01:44:14,366
Congratulations, great book.

1305
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:16,805
Your story is so real.

1306
01:44:16,905 --> 01:44:18,040
Each of us has
imaginary relationships

1307
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:19,208
some believe in God and...

1308
01:44:19,308 --> 01:44:22,963
...some like Nanhe
believe in their friends.

1309
01:44:24,379 --> 01:44:28,969
But actually, it's our inner
voice, our own conviction.

1310
01:44:30,586 --> 01:44:34,317
But how does anyone
benefit from this?

1311
01:44:34,990 --> 01:44:37,893
All it takes is for us to pay
attention to the voice and...

1312
01:44:37,993 --> 01:44:41,223
...it guides us in
the right direction.

1313
01:44:42,197 --> 01:44:44,322
Great answer.
- Thank you.

1314
01:44:47,035 --> 01:44:49,304
Congratulations again.
- Thank you, sir.

1315
01:44:49,404 --> 01:44:51,444
I wish you all the best.

1316
01:45:03,385 --> 01:45:05,385
Nanhe.

1317
01:45:18,967 --> 01:45:24,152
'For my friend Bobby Deol,
Nanhe Jaisalmer and Raja Jaisalmer'

1318
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,330
You sent me this invite for today?

1319
01:45:30,512 --> 01:45:32,512
Yes.

1320
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:37,943
Greetings, friends.
-Greetings, friends.

1321
01:45:48,497 --> 01:45:52,747
Nanhe Jaisalmer, this is
not a dream, it's reality.

1322
01:46:23,532 --> 01:46:27,127
Hello.
- Hello. Hello. - Hello.

1323
01:46:27,903 --> 01:46:29,471
I am Jassuji.
- Hello.

1324
01:46:29,571 --> 01:46:32,036
Nanhe is our childhood buddy.

1325
01:46:33,075 --> 01:46:37,880
I am Narayan Singh. - Hello! - I
am Dhurinder. - I am Hukadi Banna.

1326
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,214
Bobby Deol is Nanhe's true friend.

1327
01:46:39,314 --> 01:46:43,564
And this is how Nanhe
stepped up to reach his star.
