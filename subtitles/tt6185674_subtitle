1
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,280
Do you have a reason to say something?

2
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,320
Which girl is her royal prince
I think you should get a guy like that

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,630
A good man came down from the sky
I see dreams

4
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,100
That's our story

5
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,840
That is our story

6
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,980
This green is a rich village
A game between two teams

7
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,820
This is Prabhaker
Head of the village

8
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,900
This is Prashan
The other village head

9
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,250
Your stuff in your village
Sale. They can not be in our village

10
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,190
Because I can not.
Saying no.

11
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,990
These two are Prabhakers' friends
- Krishna, old

12
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,350
Tell me about the friendliness of this plant
Tell about these three

13
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,890
A soul takes life

14
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,270
Tell me another thing? This is around
They say winning the Kabadi

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,200
It's related to the village standards

16
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,730
But which competition is not
Win these three

17
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,050
These are old Naryuan's

18
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,850
Big sister engagement

19
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,490
This is my dad. An American bridegroom,
a doctor thought of a bridegroom.

20
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,260
An American Doctor
Brides are coming

21
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,590
After ten days' marriage. One day
Brother. I do not like this marriage

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,500
It is wrong to do this at this time

23
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,150
I do not like this marriage

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,160
It's good enough for you to say
We're leaving without two

25
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,330
Trusted crew did this
Knowing. Looks like Pannada's Padula Padma

26
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,000
Eden was Krishna in that heart then
Dwarfs started

27
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,140
A few years later

28
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,400
Older sister Sureka

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,630
Pabkar married this girl.

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,670
This is our daughter, our brigands
Ancestral daughter

31
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,990
There's only one girl in the middle of a heated family.

32
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,130
Everyone loves Brambamba.
When he was old, he was like a dick

33
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,200
Bruegha, who grew up at the age of 14,

34
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,280
Bramamba letter. Again
Give it to my dad

35
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,780
Will kill him. Now say it
I have no connection

36
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,660
This is so
Do it again

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,460
Bridging

38
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,070
Trancer, Flea
Do not give your father

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,920
Is she writing you?
Do you mail me to my daughter?

40
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,180
Do not you understand....
Sir, give it up, sir

41
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,630
It was a mistake. I'll take care of not losing it
I will not send schools again

42
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,510
Going to school. But not in this school

43
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,510
Leave the village. This is yours
Not angry with my son

44
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,510
I'm doing the love of my daughter

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,570
Do not you.
Something like this without going to school in the school

46
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,380
Tell your dad? With your father's hand
What if you do not die?

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,150
He told me to give him his son again.
And then I said that I was not connected

48
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,380
Returned. I gave it to Dad.
There is no connection to this

49
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,350
I've seen everyone's work
They get caught

50
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,310
If one goes, 10 will come.
Get on the road and marry you.

51
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,160
He'll come and put him to death.
Then you do not get bruised

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,580
Look, Dad. That may have been his marriage
I was told. Give it up

53
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,170
My dad scolded me
Drop it

54
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,550
He is blamed
What your mother knows. Madness

55
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:22,580
The gold is not identifiable
There's a good guy coming in from the class

56
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,170
Walking and walking. In one word
A king like a prince is happy

57
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,450
Look, my dear.
- Look, Dad.

58
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,010
From that moment on, our brackets
A royal prince was judged

59
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:31,880
See, I'll be playing with you all this time
I was trying to see that sacrifice now

60
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,990
What are you looking at? This is the light reading
If you read a book. The county would be 1

61
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:49,560
It's dancing with you all year
At the same time, I offer such sacrifices

62
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,470
Give it to everyone. Bye. Bye
Write well. Bye

63
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,050
Padma's marriage on the 17th Everything's for you
You must come definitely

64
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,870
We'll be fine for 4 days.
We'll take care of ourselves. Right

65
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,310
What's this?

66
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,980
How's the exam? Written perfectly.
1 is sure

67
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:46,350
What is your second job in exams?
Your mother is 3 liver. Rs. 100 crore

68
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,460
Rs. 100 per Sai Barb in the village

69
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,320
1000 home for our home

70
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,540
Out of college, run out of 1000

71
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,670
In the college, he is 1000
The coconut

72
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,070
Shiva Anore Milk
The sacrifice of the lady to the craftsman

73
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,960
Give it all
That will make it 1

74
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,660
My daughter is 1
Stop

75
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,290
Let's go for the wedding

76
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,210
You are Buny, Lakmi sister
Find where to find

77
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,770
Sister in your grand class exam
It's over, right?

78
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,610
Make some marriages
What do you say?

79
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,410
There, to my granddaughter, from here
Is the one finding the answer?

80
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,180
Then an asteric comes down
You need a good one

81
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,740
My granddaughter should go with the flowers

82
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,970
It's a super car

83
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,750
In short, a royal prince
A person like that should come

84
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,000
On the bride's side, they come
Come on

85
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,570

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,500
Venetia
The groom is fine, right? Mmm

178
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,670
Who are you bride?

179
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,470
Fuck

180
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,790
Come on, mamma, grab the corn

181
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,650
What is this?

182
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,760
Are you a sister?

183
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,040
Do you?
I'm also a fellow

184
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,240
Rape to catch the knife

185
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,860
How much nurse for your wedding?
Everyone does not dance

186
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,530
If you ask, it is called "Soft Ware"

187
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,480
How are you going to marry me?
I know

188
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,430
Kiev. Started?
Come on

189
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,450
Who are you bride? Brother.
Everyone is frien. Laundry.

190
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,910
Do not say goodbye.
We need to render

191
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,960
Grandma is a good joke.

192
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,690
To get it bigger?
Is it more expensive?

193
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,890
We've never heard of our people
Two kilos are more expensive

194
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,190
Do you have more?

195
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,710
It looks good
But you'll do more than that?

196
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,710
Why should I look at me?

197
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,790
That girl is going on. My friend
Then put on the cream

198
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,220
Get out, the groom came. What are you doing inside?
First come with the bridegroom

199
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,070
Hello, baby
Where is the bridegroom?

200
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Coming. Is not he the bride? not
The bridegroom is my criminal

201
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,640
You got scared, right? Are you scared, do you?

202
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,770
If a person like you is married
Very fun. Thanks

203
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,150
Brother. Coming
Come with me

204
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,520
This is the groom.
Wash your leg well

205
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,470
Wash it well
Or it will be sad

206
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,470
All right, all right. Let's go
Let's go. Let's go inside

207
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,180
You've already seen a man's picture
Have not you seen? I've seen it

208
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,380
Then why not ask? Give you a chance
What's that girl's name?

209
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,130
Bramanambā

210
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,070
Why did you call me my name? Bramanambāda?
So I'll brave love

211
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,370
Why are you talking to me?
You are not a Brahman's friend

212
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,940
Here you go.
Let's wait

213
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,240
Come on, Honor son

214
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,820
How to see it
How is my cousin here?

215
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,470
Come on
Thank you.

216
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,340
What are the people on this man's side? Brother
Even if it's a male. Even if it's a girl

217
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,690
Honoring honor

218
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,180
I will honor you as an adult

219
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,270
Hey baby. come here
Yes

220
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,700
Are you waiting for honor? What is the respect?
Wait for the queue in the queue?

221
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:03,560
The head was upside down. It was like gods
I'm sure that the men are in a state of mind

222
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,070
Let's respect it.

223
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,800
The dignity has been lost

224
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,200
How's the wedding the job?
This is also a wedding

225
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,210
Our daughter's marriage to Hyderabad
14th wedding

226
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,280
They're getting married

227
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:34,050
One day the Meendi festival,
Recording Dance, 4th day marriage.

228
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,990
All the money in Hyderabad there
Well prepared checkbox. 6 The next day, Sobban

229
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,730
Do you need this gold suit?

230
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,400
I want to know how good I am

231
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,540
Do something. You have a lot of property.
Get that from me

232
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,960
Hello, my dad saw me? Do not
Powder has grown. Correct the lipstick

233
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,890
Where's Dad?

234
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,310
Did not expect you, did you?

235
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,050
What the hell are you doing?
What's the golden chest?

236
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,700
It's a strange thing

237
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,610
Mastermind says this.
Please, folks

238
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,500
This admiration is different

239
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:42,970
If this sounds like a scare,
Talk about the gold. Drinking stupid

240
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,320
From here, from America, I brought these bags
I had to come with the husband

241
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,900
What about your fiancee?
He's not ready

242
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,090
Is not the brother-in-law?

243
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,260
If their cousin has come to his marriage
Your husband is useless

244
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,590
Leave. Tell me to quit

245
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,780
What are they strange about?
What are you saying uncle, uncle?

246
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,640
They were supposed to have given the body the right information.

247
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,650
Because I tried many CDs, DVDs
There's something wrong with this

248
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,710
You do not think about it
Go look at it

249
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:34,710
Do you speak uncle? (They say it's wrong)
What do you call the sisters?

250
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,080
Fine, what is it?
Give. Your bodies are telugu

251
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,990
Coming from there
It does not look here

252
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,120
What's wrong...?

253
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,850
Get out of here. Get out of here
What's happening, son?

254
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,750
What do you want?

255
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,010
I am the bride's brother

256
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,170
What's wrong with...
Yakōda.....

257
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,020
What a respect? Manamālayāṭavat
They're not gonna come here

258
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,670
Just like that, in a girl's case.
What's in the girl's room for you?

259
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,320
Tell
Went to put on the clothes?

260
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,940
I do not see my dress

261
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,690
Saying?

262
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,370
Take it. What are these injustices?

263
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,630
What?

264
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,190
Now... I'm not going to have to tell you a thing

265
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,950
What's wrong? What's up
Brother the Bridegroom. My name is bride

266
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,940
You're a bunny

267
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,840
Do not believe me. She
Deceiving. What are you saying, brother-in-law?

268
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,210
You're the bride. Oh, I'm....

269
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,510
You take revenge on what I did in the morning
I know Sis. I know

270
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,530
Mom....
I know Sis

271
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:52,870
Oh, dear. This is an important thing. Say not to joke
Tell

272
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,530
No, boy. Look, I'm getting married
Oh

273
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,750
Sorry. Okay
Sorry

274
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,810
This is the most beautiful person here for you
You thought you were the bride.

275
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,300
Okay. Everyone thinks so
Why did not you come in here?

276
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:19,810
There's something important to do with the cousin
Oh yes The other side is in the room. Go

277
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,780
The cousin has come to work
Go get going

278
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,640
Get ready

279
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,810
What the hell?

280
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,620
Did you think of a game?
Oh, I think I'm a bride...

281
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,500
Not everyone wants to do business

282
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,890
I do not even do this so much
Why is it so exciting to find the cellphone? Take the blue

283
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,260
We need money for a low interest
AO low-interest?

284
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,860
Was this a rural bank?
The door is Babu. He gives it to the fuse. that is all

285
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,340
These are for guests to sit down
Not like barrels like yours. Nægiṭinavalā

286
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,730
Get out of the ground
Idagannavā

287
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,770
Have you reached the wedding? Went to take revenge on the family?
Do not laugh. Earthquakes

288
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,330
Stop

289
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,420
Put

290
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,260
Stop

291
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,970
Put it back

292
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,040
Stop
What is it with you?

293
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,940
Even for marrying
Even getting married in the village is like this

294
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,050
Do not get angry. Tell

295
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,150
Not even getting married
Food should be perfect. That's what I want

296
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,890
There are ten thousand property
It's okay to get married

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,500
You do not have to tell what to do.
Do your work

298
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,020
What a mess this is

299
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,340
You give it

300
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,560
Down

301
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,420
Stop

302
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,940
Put

303
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,100
Stop

304
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,160
Stop

305
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,070
Stop.
Who gave you yöko to cook?

306
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,790
Not just where and where they are
I want to know where to stop

307
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,450
Who discarded goods?
Do not you know how to buy me and aluminum?

308
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,630
It's made.
I cooked it like cooking

309
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,010
What the hell is that? Everybody cooks everybody.

310
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:35,260
What's going on?
38 years experience. So what?

311
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,070
Listen to me. Say. You gotta say something.
What is it? Goods like a wife.

312
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,180
You have to look carefully. Or else it's over.
I'll go with another guy and sleep

313
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,680
If you get more gas, the cylinder is running out
Not for you. About that cylinder

314
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,450
Hey Hey. What do you tell me about my food?
Stop. Down

315
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm looking for my husband. is it?
My wedding is urgent

316
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,020
Where is Brin?
I do not know

317
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,430
Knowing

318
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,530
Have you seen my dad? not
Where's my dad? Dad, Dad

319
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,100
Did you see Bethany? Did you see my dad?
I do not know your dad. So I did not see the bronze

320
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,500
What's this for? Is this? Do not smell like Eve
Eat it

321
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:37,370
Dad, why do not we remember? I do not know. know
Definitely I know.

322
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,160
I'll show you
Where is your dad?

323
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,250
Here you are

324
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,600
Dad. Come on, son, come in
My son is here

325
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,910
Dad. My son
Sit

326
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,800
Have you had a baby?
Daddy's been eating?

327
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,410
You a very good one?

328
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,690
You are as daddy
Go and sleep

329
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,510
I just thought now
You said it now

330
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,350
You've eaten lavender. Dog ..
Sleep went to the chips

331
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,680
He said he did not know me

332
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,110
Son, I was down the road with us

333
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,270
Shall we honor it?

334
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,450
Why do you honor me?
You may have had a good time

335
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Beer?

336
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,440
Let's get some beer

337
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,000
A number came
A cue came

338
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:26,380
What? What? Oh, great

339
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,200
Most mothers come to life like a tiger
Leave

340
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,680
It's over
Let's go back

341
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,000
Seeing that baggage, he went to the feast.
Let's go

342
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,180
Rotation

343
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,250
What's the problem here? An apprentice has come
What happened to a cobra?

344
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,390
What happened? An apprentice has come
Let's do cellphony

345
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,470
Wait, wait. They take care of the goods as their wife
Do not hit this...

346
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,300
What is this in the middle of the middle?

347
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,880
Uncle, uncle is there.
Where, where? Get out of here. where are you...?

348
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,850
The whole thing is drunk

349
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,890
Hold on

350
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,920
There are girls
Support a little bit

351
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,430
I'm asking for help

352
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:34,690
Ask for help. Then why is that a pole from that?
Playing?

353
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,390
Your sins. Hold it. It's a big sound.

354
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,760
Remove the cloth
Remove the stick

355
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,100
Forgive me for what I've done in the meantime

356
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,380
What is this?
It's not good to act

357
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,750
Do not do it
I?

358
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:42,720
What's crying? What happened?
Your mother is not well. She's already very well now

359
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,680
My mom wants me to do me a doctor.
He was also shot

360
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:54,660
Now, Mother needs to be treated.
No one will help. That's why it's sad

361
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,830
How much for medicines?
25000

362
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,750
Dad come here

363
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,720
Hey, Gopal, come here
why? Take the check book. Give the check book

364
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,850
Give the pen

365
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,320
Sign it

366
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,460
Get this and take your mother out

367
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,980
Do not cry again

368
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,420
Take care of Mom
Thank you, Sister

369
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,080
Sly, I need 25,000

370
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,490
Not 250,000

371
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,900
This is Mom's medicine
Your cash money

372
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,670
Mom, Laxmi, too, has given me a meal
Can not you do this for her?

373
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,800
What's that crazy thing?

374
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,930
What happened?
250000 lakhs have been given?

375
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,370
Whatever he asks for
That's it

376
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,460
Why did you give it? Mom, it's......
You're spoiling him?

377
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,460
Money is mine. Whatever good you do
Do not be mad

378
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,740
Right? Right?
You're killing yourself

379
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,420
You two have to do anything
Mother, mother

380
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,970
You do not have to come to see the Kabadi
Ayo forgot. Started?

381
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,630
I'll go. Bye

382
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,100
Kabadi said that the boys are running

383
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,260
Let's go wages. where is? Why. Years
Have not they got one of them in our village?

384
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,000
Ever won?
Then why go there for what?

385
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,500
It's always like that
I do not know how to play

386
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,230
No male?
If there are males,

387
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,830
What is she doing?
The game is going through the middle

388
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,820
I'm in your bunch
To play?

389
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,650
Play brother

390
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,250
Give your brother a good job

391
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,150
This time, brother of ours is winning our group in kabudi

392
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,540
Let's go
Let's go

393
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,790
What is this boy playing?

394
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,170
That way

395
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,710
Won........

396
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,370
Great son
What is your name, son? Siva

397
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,690
Thanks

398
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,190
Everyone come. The bride's ready
Come on. Come on

399
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,590
Father, hi. Hi. Come on
best wishes

400
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,480
You have to go so fast
Wait, Dad. No, boy

401
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,510
Is this son Crisana's son?
Yes

402
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,100
Did not Mom come?
Your mom is dead. do not you know?

403
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,170
Brin, I'm going.
Go

404
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:33,660
Here. what?
The phone number. What do you want me to do?

405
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,460
Not anything. When I'm gone, I'll be fine
I did not talk to you. It feels like

406
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,740
I'm sorry I did not give my cell number

407
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,910
But if you have my number, then, Brin
I'm always talking

408
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,530
Hope like that

409
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,040
Now go

410
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,730
Okay, you stay here
I'm leaving

411
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:22,120
What? You see? What's that girl?
What is this Mr. Ranuga?

412
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,010
Sister

413
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,510
A lot of lives have been married
Even if they got children. No contact here

414
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,790
I felt it. Even if I do not like it
I love her

415
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,640
It's stolen

416
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,580
That's why I wear gold
It's not good to walk

417
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,100
Am I mad?
Look at me

418
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,110
These kinds of collections have not been seen in my life

419
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,780
Dad, I'm not leaving, Dad
This is how it is

420
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,180
Sister. Why cry?

421
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,530
You do not wanna cry. For every girl
This is an opportunity

422
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:29,870
Whatever you do not understand.
Your parents are 24 years old

423
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,790
The relationship with you is getting distanced today

424
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,830
They know this too. You're leaving now

425
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,550
In your busy lives, you will live

426
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,780
Four years ago, you're coming

427
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,840
And then a week is your home
A week is in that house

428
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:51,870
That's what your parents say
I see another 10.15 years

429
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,740
Knowing that the relationship is distant
I'm going to be happy to send you

430
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,600
Where is it you just to cry like this?

431
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,590
Everyone was happy
Now everyone is upset

432
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,960
It's all about you

433
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,440
Your embraces are tight
Come on, come on. And everyone will be happy

434
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,540
Good courage

435
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,300
Good to talk
He's a big man

436
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,220
I started
Then I do not know where to go

437
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,980
Just wait
Sure, good

438
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,170
I waited for you

439
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,940
Have fun?

440
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,830
What happened, son?

441
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,160
Why not?
L feel lonely

442
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,590
I understand your feelings
Have fun with everyone

443
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,130
There's no one at home

444
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,120
I've had that feeling several times

445
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,430
That loneliness can not be anything new
You should marry

446
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,980
Hello, sir. Do your job
My marriage is too long

447
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:26,910
I'll get in touch with you. That's not it
There was no one like Martha who got married

448
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm not getting married
Does it mean you get married?

449
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,680
The idea is fine.
That's what it was

450
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,610
It's very young

451
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,640
Let's get late
Let's try it

452
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,260
Last week, you danced in the party, sir

453
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,500
This is your age too, sir

454
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,310
An old man said
My number is 120

455
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,400
You're just 20

456
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:51,610
Why does this girl meet you?
You're on this office MD

457
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,730
Do you know what that 20 is? Why?
Because you are my son

458
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,550
What is this remedy?

459
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,480
Nothing. His teaching
His will. Do not talk

460
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,050
Because you want to do an MBA
He gave a bounty aid. Now I say no

461
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,850
Your anxiety has increased
What?

462
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,040
What's your problem?
Said get

463
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,080
What's the problem? Go on your own
It's freaky

464
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,560
Do not do anything
But do not be afraid to do anything

465
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,110
Let's do something?

466
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,660
Let's go there

467
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,320
Tell me if you do not like me
Next time I'll be with you

468
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,360
Right?

469
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,840
Raja's house has a guest house

470
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,490
Like a star hotel
Would you like to stay there?

471
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,960
Now, send in from the village
Question?

472
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:24,620
He will be there if he is there
You're scared what will happen

473
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:31,200
If they're here, they'll have their love
I'm afraid of what will happen

474
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,690
Hello. Welcome
Listen

475
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:46,850
I should be like a five-star hotel in my room
It does not matter how long. Fucking brother

476
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,680
Find a good Rommet
I'll handle it. Send it out scared

477
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,410
From a village, a girlfriend I know is coming
Care must be taken carefully

478
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,070
Okay, sir

479
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,600
Work
After dinner

480
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,470
Dad, the room is great

481
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:06,200
Do you like it? Your brother wants a good partner
This is the daughter. Hello uncle. Greetings daughter

482
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,260
will come again

483
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,090
Brother.......

484
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,430
It's okay now

485
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,070
Two new fries
I need to look a little

486
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,140
Why do not you shut the door?

487
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,390
Not closed?
Suddenly forgotten

488
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,320
What's wrong?

489
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,350
You'll soon have to hittanor
It's coming in

490
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,790
That's not my brother
She wants to see her mother, father

491
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,070
He told me. is it?

492
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,440
I did not say

493
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,330
Do not say

494
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,410
It's embarrassing
I was told. Understand it

495
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:55,310
Let's go, let's go
Take a loot. Let's go

496
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,140
They say now
Today is a good day

497
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:32,720
Fresh? Hey, are you new, huh? When I said so
Love with everything

498
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:40,280
Yes, fresh. The asthma is good. Tomorrow is in a bag
Come on. Kneels in the museum

499
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:45,160
You like that? Pull yourself in too
There are many. Come back tomorrow

500
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:51,280
What's your name? Bramanambā.
My grandmother's name. Well

501
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,350
Let's go shopping
Let's go down

502
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,880
I'll eat and eat in the morning

503
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:07,520
Talking to me again
If you tell my dad

504
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,300
Everyone will be killed. Let me tell you now
And then I have no connection

505
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:14,930
Speak tomorrow morning

506
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,620
Two years there. Look at Nandagaya and stay there afterwards
Whatever you say, you do not ask. Let's go

507
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,630
I'll get the bags, cell phones
Take the phone

508
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,140
That's not the pocket
Strange

509
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,250
Turn around here

510
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,720
Where are you?
Who is this?

511
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:05,790
Tell me where it is at first. Who? I am
Who am I saying? I'm frank

512
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,790
100 years old. Now, where am I? Where are you?
Vayisāg. Vayisāgda....

513
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,910
When did it come? Yesterday. where are you
In college. Come for a while?

514
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:22,400
Which college? Gotham college
I'll be right back

515
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,280
I'm curious.
come soon

516
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:32,840
Put on the bus. Informal Trustee spoke
Not to go to 3 in 3. You two go

517
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,110
The driver will not come

518
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:08,890
What are you doing here?

519
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,570
We came to the MBA
is it? Does that mean two years?

520
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,190
What is your pleasure?
 No, just ask

521
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,210
What happened?

522
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,750
I've never been to the village anymore

523
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,800
Did not they go anywhere?
went to..

524
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,650
Thirupathi, Sri Shylam was gone
That is, God is a Buccaneer

525
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:39,410
The first came up on the road. Frightened. Nightly dreams are visible
It's not enough for the college

526
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,890
Mom and Dad will get excited

527
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,170
Nobody wants to know. First you called

528
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,970
Is so scary for such a small thing?

529
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,810
Do you feel that way?
I'm scared somewhere

530
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,190
Do you know what? In this world
There is no fear

531
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,520
There is. Do not say
Theirs....

532
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:09,480
Now you come here.
There is a small throat between here and there

533
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:15,510
It was hard to imagine what to do with this space
You are Kebellawela. Think about it and get scared

534
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,180
You easily pass this grid
It's all over

535
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,470
Is It Easy? Yes.
my goodness....

536
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,230
My courage came

537
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,100
Let's go, slow down.
Quickly. Whoa, Whoa

538
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:38,790
There

539
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,520
That's not where is my number?

540
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,600
That's it.
Væṭṭuvānē

541
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,740
I thought you were good
That's why I took it

542
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,580
Is your father head?
If he says anything, he will

543
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,670
He brought in a guard

544
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:37,910
The guard came. You're staying together for 2 years, are not you?
You have to make a good connection, right?

545
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,270
Think about it

546
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,620
Have pondered.
You thought you were right

547
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,270
I'll try.
But definitely it is him
Use it

548
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:15,480
Are you OK? Now it's come. You gave me 9.00 courage, did not you?
9.00 am I did not look at the time. The 9.00

549
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:23,670
12 was fine. Afterward, he was scared.
I wish Siva would be better. Came

550
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,200
You have a little gift

551
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:36,180
What is this? A DreamCatcher. That means
They take bad dreams and give good dreams.

552
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,130
Usually this is hanging the door
You're targeted everywhere

553
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,040
Daddy's been in the office, right?
What happened?

554
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,660
That's why dancing is more dancing
I did not feel like that

555
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,160
What did you think?

556
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,810
Your appearance is a little old
That's why this dye is for the younger look

557
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,530
I'm with you because you are my friend
I'll tell you a secret

558
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,420
what? The girls who worked in my room are a good person
He took blessings

559
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,540
But now

560
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,460
Near the corner, Hai Dalin also says

561
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,670
Tell me anything
I want to make it shine

562
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,900
When you tell me about the tender,
I think about my hair color

563
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,360
That job was long overdue

564
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:36,980
My other coins fit my guess on Wednesday

565
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,790
You get 790
The tender is ours. Right?

566
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,180
Okay, you make me color
I'll go get the tender

567
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,050
Sir. What happened? There's another 10 minutes
We'll get our own

568
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,820
I'll tell you
Do not worry

569
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,940
Do not worry, you are perfect
800 million

570
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,720
I want to get over

571
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,960
United Workers Company receives

572
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,130
Number one, sir

573
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:28,720
United Workers Company. Your dad said yes
Mother's name is said. Both are one

574
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,560
Do not set up your ridiculous lineup

575
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,480
You meet Krishna

576
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,540
25 CRs
Leave

577
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:44,070
You do not even like to say anything about your name

578
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:48,610
It sounds like a bit big
For many years now

579
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:49,910
Go and tell

580
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,600
It's empty
Come to the hostel

581
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,590
Today, college cuts
Sleep well

582
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,220
come here. What?
Wait there. You see?

583
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,880
where is? There

584
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:30,020
He's in our hostel
Put someone in the line

585
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,830
I got it. Either the other room
One of them should be

586
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:38,880
Or I'm from our room
Okay, you should be right

587
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,960
You're here with me
The person in the room sees

588
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,650
Do not stay here next time,.....
OK OK

589
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:56,230
Why did you tell me? What bank is ATM? ICAI Bank?

590
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,760
I did not ask the address
Ahio is the one bank.

591
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:05,820
is it? Where is it?
In our village. ATM is where the ATM is

592
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,120
See how to fight

593
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,860
I do not want to fight this

594
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:16,700
It's that. You can get it from an ATM.
This bank has my own connection with me.

595
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,620
Afterwards, it will be walked through Visas
Nothing

596
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:25,220
Get in. I'll go with a good place
Let's go. to where. Just say yes

597
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:41,010
Is this? Let's take her away
Something like a kovil

598
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,320
Did you think that?
Let's go

599
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,720
I like the temple

600
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,370
Brading I got a new ring tone
Get a call on my phone. Stay

601
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:00,380
That's great. Do you know what?
Every time you call, this will be playing

602
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,760
is it. I like that very much
is it? Only your mind is low

603
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,390
Bring two cassettes

604
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,300
Bramamba does not drink coffee

605
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,320
You drink

606
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,170
Very good
Drink. Hello

607
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:23,550
Now say. Bring me, Kofi
Break down the cotton

608
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:25,570
I have no connection

609
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,090
It's not like that

610
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,260
Said get

611
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,690
You say coffee breaks with coffees
Then I did not have a connection. Said get

612
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:04,160
Be unfaithful. Said, I said
Get coffee for the cup. Take the money

613
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,210
Love is Love
There must be

614
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,960
Will you help me? what
I do not know wizag. Are you going shopping with me?

615
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:48,940
Gold
Venetia.....

616
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,030
Is not dad? Do not come with your father?
The road is coming. for me?

617
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:03,170
What's that? A DreamCatcher

618
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,380
Here

619
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:14,590
You too did eat. Eat
I'm also very fond of you

620
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:22,510
What is it? Toaster
Who gave it? My friend

621
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:26,600
Do not stick with the guys

622
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,030
What's your problem?

623
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,690
These boys laugh talking
A friend gets close

624
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,360
Love gifts and love

625
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,480
After that,
Mom.....

626
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:45,810
Dad. Look, Dad
My mom doubted me

627
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:51,070
It's not a doubt, Mother Dad
We are scared

628
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,570
Saying so without telling the way you should say

629
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,300
I did not do anything
you go

630
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,330
Mother, I said, dad
Prince will marry

631
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:10,910
Because you need to talk
Yes

632
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,730
That's not what I'm talking to.
I had a suspicion. what?

633
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,220
Do you love me?

634
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,690
What's the matter?
You asked if you would love

635
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:27,720
What do you think? Say. How do you say Nothing
I do not have that kind of feeling.

636
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:33,780
If you think like that, I'm talking
It will be even more. Yes, no?

637
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:37,580
You're suggesting one day. I will not say it.
I do not like it

638
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:39,740
You'll be sad
I do not like it

639
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,920
That's why. Tell me about love now
Let's stop talking

640
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:48,370
Bridi's life is clear. You too must be. Tell

641
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:52,750
Are you in love? Now I'm in love
If you say you stop talking

642
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:56,430
At such times, you have to be kind

643
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,170
Tell

644
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,960
no no. Not really, are you?
No, really not

645
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,120
Is it completely clear?
Yes, obviously

646
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:09,560
Then you can talk
Tell. Any special stuff?

647
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,550
This girl is very clear

648
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,630
It makes this absurdity crazy

649
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,580
I told you not

650
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,170
Have you seen the village girls?
It was said that there was a syncope

651
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,170
He's getting ready to film Mannadan

652
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,270
With experience

653
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,340
They're caught with girls who kill with life

654
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:55,060
Do not talk if you're in love. Do not make friends.
Think about those who make such a fight

655
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,770
Shut up and leave the girl happy and happy

656
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:07,220
I'll ask a question
Answer?

657
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:14,080
This is the reason for your birth
Can you tell me?

658
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,820
Can you explain your happiness?

659
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,520
No answer

660
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:31,010
This is the day of death
Can you tell

661
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,370
There is definitely no answer for this

662
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,050
All I have is one answer

663
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,220
Bramanambā

664
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,110
Angry talk

665
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,780
Going hard or not
Go

666
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:31,000
To sacrifice to your photo

667
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,100
Do your work right

668
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,600
Ask for whatever help you need

669
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,980
My son. Halo
Nice to meet you

670
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,720
Who?
From the Cutter Care

671
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:41,720
Just come to the Bunch
Emergency. Ever

672
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,850
Why did you suddenly come?

673
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,220
Nothing. Sunday. There is nothing to do

674
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:58,500
Pay the time. It's not like that...
You know how busy there is

675
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:03,160
know. Spoke to Kamishnar. I talked to the minister.
How do you know?

676
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:05,960
The phone was on it
Oh, forget it

677
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,100
You need to show me something

678
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:09,620
get up. what?
get up

679
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:14,550
This is the 1st birthday of the day

680
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,130
This is the 5th birthday day

681
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,160
This is a school day program

682
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,040
This is in the games

683
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,460
This is the first day of school

684
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,750
Say, tell me
Better?

685
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,120
How?
Added

686
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:39,860
How did you do it? Your friend. My cousin
Marriage. That's what he asked

687
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,440
Why add?

688
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:45,360
What happened? The photos you showed me

689
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,470
I'll show up.
You're collecting

690
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,330
Bramanaba does not like

691
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:53,160
Brian, you have misunderstood

692
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:00,810
Listen to me, Bruno
Lied about my friend

693
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,820
Nothing. Listen to me
Do not say anything

694
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:09,110
Where are you coming?
I do not like what you did

695
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:17,070
Now I say. You were about to meet me
I am going to jump, but I go and jump

696
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,070
I have no connection later

697
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,580
Something small
Get your hands off

698
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:02,010
Not then. Today, too
Definitely used

699
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:18,700
Use, use, say
All of you, I'm using

700
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:44,290
Once again, if you sell books in Brunswick
Bury right here

701
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,670
Listen to me, Frederick
Rotation. Karunākarā

702
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:14,050
Actually what happened?
I do not like these fighting

703
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:33,420
Bullheadedness. Madness, stupidity
You're the one who's got all together

704
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:39,170
It's difficult to change you.

705
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,280
Just do something
Let me do this

706
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,220
Do you know what this means?

707
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,800
Grief-stricken comfort

708
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,800
Sinhala subtitles are downloaded from www.zoom.lk.

709
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,090
Stop it now
When do you come

710
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,080
Stop playing
You see? Then what?

711
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:42,000
She told me to cut her carrot

712
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,410
What the hell are you up to?

713
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,950
What's wrong is...

714
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,900
That's the sequin....

715
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:58,290
Earthquakes, tsunamis, collection of cirrus
These girls say

716
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:01,250
The relationship between ladies and ladies...
Hey...

717
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,130
Cut vegetables?
It's all over

718
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:08,370
Only carrots are left.
Hurry to get dressed up. Right

719
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,400
All of them are destroyed when they cut vegetables
This is a woman

720
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:20,260
Mercedes?

721
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,050
Where did you stop?
Relationships

722
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:37,900
Brother
A Chehelmma

723
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,200
Is it cooking your food?
There is a sacrifice in our house too. beat it

724
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:50,500
She's the woman. Is it all about publishing the donkey?
Silly girl

725
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:59,250
Before they get married, they do not know this before
Talk about relationships

726
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,690
You're lucky

727
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:07,190
do not be silly
You have more time. Do not come out

728
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:13,260
Over? Yes, you
Yes

729
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,850
Cut this out
I will go

730
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:46,840
where are you? Rotation. What happened?
Come back? will come

731
01:18:53,280 --> 01:19:01,000
What happened? My thing is not healthy.
Would you send me home?

732
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:25,760
Do not worry
Nothing will happen to your ladybug

733
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:33,100
That's not it. I called up urgently, right?
There's no such thing. I thought myself

734
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:37,080
Shh, do not talk once
Nobody talks

735
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,620
I'm talking to you

736
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:46,830
I got it. Do not call, do not talk.
Why are you with that?

737
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,800
That's why it's called. I hit hard and helped a lot.

738
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,560
There's no such thing. How are you thanking
Do not understand. It's okay

739
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,610
Stop

740
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:59,220
You descend. What happened?
He came to the village

741
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:02,430
No one wants to see it
Down. There?

742
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,350
Bye Siva
Okay, you're safe

743
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,220
Get up in the bus

744
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:14,010
Get off the bus?
Where exactly am I?

745
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,420
Now where to go

746
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,190
Venetia. How did you come, daughter?
What is this?

747
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,820
Because this came right behind
You do not talk. You cheated me

748
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,770
I did not say that I was well

749
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,210
That's not it. Lbelin. Blood pressure
This is what happened

750
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:40,460
You are not well enough to say I can not wait
Quickly came

751
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:46,140
Oh, crazy
Where can I go do not see your marriage?

752
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:51,050
Look at your marriage, your children
It's going

753
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,380
Look at the desires of this age
You're uncle

754
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:05,410
Get on the bus? Yes, yes
How are you?

755
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:08,600
Because of the age of high blood pressure
It has fallen

756
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,050
We were so excited
Let us?

757
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,610
That's me
I was upset

758
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:22,190
I like your help very much. What did you say?
Very much like your helpfulness

759
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:25,500
I like your help very much

760
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:31,830
Bradley Signal is ok. Say again
where are you? Not Signal? I?

761
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:33,960
He's in the sky

762
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:49,670
She took a spoon
Who was that? Visa. I asked for visas for America

763
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,330
That means a girl in America
It's not like that

764
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:59,060
Is it India?
Did I wear the gift shirt?

765
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:03,680
I did not go to that girl yesterday
Did that mean another girl?

766
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,300
I am a cheerful man
No girlfriend

767
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,190
That is, it used to be.
 Not even past, not even now. Is that what the future is?

768
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:19,910
That's not it

769
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:25,550
If you like my mole
Imagine how shy the girl is

770
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,930
Do not get angry. So I'm a shit?
Not that....

771
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:39,280
will come

772
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:41,530
I'll be right back
Are you so beautiful?

773
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,390
Coming now. There
Are you going to that one?

774
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,910
You bloody brain

775
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:59,330
Are you nagging me? There I am....
Come to the house. I'll tell you

776
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,090
What are you? I screamed
What did you get out of that one?

777
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,130
Brennan open the village
I got into a lorry

778
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:19,180
These are the girls. First love
Then it's dropped

779
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,410
I hear what I say.....
Hey, Hayo

780
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:28,070
He's right now. is it?
They did not say that they would not make a deep impression

781
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:28,840
Says

782
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:31,960
When she finishes her exam, she's fine
Look at the time

783
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:35,110
Tell me then and then together.
Beat up

784
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,670
Thrice
Let's go

785
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:46,320
Dad. Boys' pictures around us
Australia, London, and the United States

786
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:52,440
If you are looking at pictures. Dad
What can I see? You look....

787
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:56,920
Shame
It's shame...

788
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:20,360
What is it, Prabhakar? It's always working in that port.
Property, money, and power

789
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,230
It feels impossible to do anything

790
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,580
All right, it's the right port. Rocky
Is it... lost?

791
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,610
People have to sit

792
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:34,320
Let's do it
OK OK. Do something

793
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:42,830
I came up
where are you? I'm at home

794
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:44,890
What happened?
wait a little

795
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,180
See whatsapp

796
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,970
What is it?
It's my situation

797
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,940
I do not understand what to do
Fucking

798
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:11,100
You do me a job. Everything is first
The messenger should come from you.

799
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:15,060
Okay. Lessons for this week
I have to work.

800
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:34,700
The chapters are over

801
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:40,750
Then Siva. Can
Tomorrow

802
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:57,100
Because bun. a friend. Village. Come on
I'll handle everything

803
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:01,370
I'll call you later
What?

804
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:04,030
Because your real estate is writing anything?

805
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:06,330
Little
But property

806
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:11,240
Bridegroom. What? Marriage?
You?

807
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:14,110
Me. What are you so terrified?

808
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:21,780
not. Look, I've been looking this out for a long time
A long day?

809
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:23,510
You did not like it?

810
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:32,780
not. But there was a new connection.
What did you say? You said you wanted something

811
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,540
There is one life

812
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:37,030
What kind of person is Eido

813
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,870
What kind of person is it?

814
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:43,560
The one for me.
You want to be a good man coming out of the sky

815
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,190
That is, from the sky
Proven?

816
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:50,380
I want to go with the flowers

817
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:52,750
more

818
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:55,220
It's a super car

819
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:58,850
Siva... Okay, all right
Next

820
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,060
In short, a king
A person like that should come. That means....

821
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,630
Does that mean a cache?

822
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:10,130
Who will do it? A royal prince...
There must be good traits

823
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:15,110
If you're normal, you'll be fine
It's better. Ordinary?

824
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:25,330
It's normal. Now... the guy I met is like that
Like this, he will do it

825
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,170
I want to be
It's like this

826
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:30,050
Not like this
Average

827
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:33,610
Now you're there. about you
What do you have to say big

828
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,840
That's right

829
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:45,240
The one who gets me must be like that

830
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,760
Bermuda's embarrassing

831
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:58,390
Okay, I'll leave. Go, go for it?
Siva

832
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:15,160
You're so strong, Shiva

833
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:19,840
Get married to our own
 Think of your sister

834
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:22,970
If you all...

835
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:36,470
Why was my mom talking with Mom?

836
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:42,380
Nothing. I got married with my stepmother
Are you a king?
 Thanks

837
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:45,650
What are you doing, bro point?
He's a businessman in America

838
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:48,190
There's their own SoftVoir company

839
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:54,390
That means, after the wedding, get the hell out of here
Going to America

840
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,300
Remember me too

841
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:01,760
After my husband, my husband, my husband
To stay behind him

842
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,060
Here your mother and father are crazy
You will also be contacted by your friend

843
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:26,050
Dad... your mom talked, did not you?
You wanna get married with your cousin, do not you?

844
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:28,520
That's your will
The final decision

845
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:33,370
What do you say is right
Nothing's right, Dad

846
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:40,560
Give me some time
I can not imagine anything at once from him, Dad

847
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,370
All right, dear
Think about it

848
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:18,470
Do not you go to sleep?
Not on sleep. What happened?

849
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:23,650
If I'm getting married. Mother Dad
Grandmother, Grandpa

850
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:30,840
Can not see anyone, right? Going
America is not one day. I can not see the first one for the year

851
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:33,340
The groom, bride
When I was Eido

852
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:48,700
what is doing?
Nothing. You're in the office

853
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:53,120
did you eat? Not yet
What's wrong?

854
01:35:55,740 --> 01:36:03,260
What are you talking about? There is nothing to talk about.
I'm in a mess. What happened to you?

855
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,530
I'm getting another call
I'll take it later

856
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:17,570
I need to talk when kate says
What's wrong?

857
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:22,460
My father was arrested
What?

858
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,160
Come on

859
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:14,490
What happened?
They say no

860
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:43,210
What happened?

861
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:47,430
We're designing the port in the design
The engineer has been changed

862
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:53,120
Engineer Banerjee Prabhaker
The company has joined together

863
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:06,330
God took God back to the police

864
01:38:06,610 --> 01:38:08,150
Like a god like your father

865
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:12,130
They gave them engineers
God did injustice

866
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,310
Who are you?

867
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:41,330
Dad's eyes for the first time in life
I saw the tears. Because you, because

868
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:44,420
What is your dad crazy about us?
What about us?

869
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:47,990
Tātatē

870
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,210
Come on.
Come on. Dad

871
01:38:56,430 --> 01:39:00,340
Take your son
Or he will die.
Take it

872
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:12,670
Kill. do not
Do not come to my cross

873
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:20,460
Stay away from this
If he gets upset, he'll kill you and put him to the ground

874
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:56,850
I want to talk to you
Come to the beach

875
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:06,420
Why did I cut it when I called?
Father is a problem in the business

876
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:09,380
When I talk to my mind
Do not talk a bit?

877
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,740
Calling tap calls
I will not regenerate. why?

878
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:15,860
Get away? Am I not a heart
Will not I be sad?

879
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:18,270
I've been chatting with you for 24 hours

880
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:21,710
I have my questions
It was said that father was a business problem

881
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:26,610
That means more than me
 Dad, is it worth it? Hey....

882
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:30,260
Are you crazy? Is Dad the Great?

883
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:33,040
Big one
Nobody is in that position

884
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:37,590
Talk too much

885
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,100
I do not want to talk to you

886
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:45,810
You do not like
I have a lot of problems

887
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:52,030
If there are any problems, stop. Stop. You're speechless
Every time I do, my pride is increased

888
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:54,500
Am I speechless?

889
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:58,870
Without knowing what to say
What are you reading about the mouth?

890
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:04,060
You've loved yourself so long
I can not understand myself anymore

891
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:12,950
Did you love me? Not only did you see you now
Love forever, love,.....

892
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:21,080
Then you will not be loved. If you say love
They did not say that they would not speak

893
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:25,220
What's wrong? Did you just want to look like a queen?

894
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:27,710
Would I cry if I come to your eyes?

895
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:30,760
Calling one phone call is a madman
Is it coming?

896
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:32,850
What was wrong with me?
what?

897
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:39,480
What's the matter What did I do?
You're talking badly

898
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,520
Your conduct is also disrespectful. Where I am
Have you acted rude in time?

899
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:46,050
What's the matter What's the matter
Tell

900
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:49,690
Scared one way
Is not there a brake in the brake? Remember?

901
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:54,180
After that, the arms were handcuffed

902
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,950
That's what he had on the bag

903
01:42:00,410 --> 01:42:05,130
Brake pad for brake control
The exams gave hands to hand. Is that also wrong?

904
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:12,280
Can not you say that?
Contact with chance

905
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:16,880
What do you understand about me? You
I get angry and kick the ball.

906
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,910
Shiv, how strong are you asking?

907
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:21,000
The thugs who fought for you

908
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:23,510
The groom is normal

909
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:34,070
He asked what kind he was doing

910
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:33,430
No dialogue
Goggles only

911
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:39,500
You do not have any ideas for so long
You were talking to me because of love

912
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:43,020
Now, there is no love
That's what I did for love

913
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,580
I did it all.
I'm working myself

914
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:51,740
I'm ruined, I'm ruined
I'm dead

915
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,190
I do not have a life like this

916
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:59,200
I did not have a headache
Come to meet you and ask him to marry

917
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:01,790
Please do not marry me

918
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:06,190
I am a normal person
Go get your royal maiden

919
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:12,110
I'm angry with you
Shiva is ugly

920
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:13,240
What do they say?

921
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:20,100
Why not?

922
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:23,820
Everything comes to the broomstick?

923
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:26,370
I've been waiting
Going

924
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,050
So much money I spent in love so far

925
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:43,360
Get those goods and give me the money to get me

926
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:44,690
Take

927
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,230
Will you help me?

928
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:59,620
I have my own email
Send a picture of your royal image

929
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:02,390
See what she looks like

930
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:05,910
What shoebox will he be wearing in his life

931
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:08,460
He's finished

932
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,480
The person coming in is not a king

933
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:26,440
Have you considered?

934
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,940
I'll marry the brother-in-law father
That's very happy, daughter

935
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,670
Married to marriage

936
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:40,600
come soon

937
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:17,040
Bradley, it's sitting here

938
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:21,190
Do you still think about Shiva?

939
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:34,620
Now what is his name?
I do not know. But if this is not appreciated,

940
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:36,620
I'm in love

941
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:43,500
Send him the last messenger
The first feeling I felt

942
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:50,180
Like courage, he carried on his responsibilities
Like Mother, Father's affection

943
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,590
I did not get it right then

944
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:57,150
Better with him, by the side
I thought it was good

945
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:03,150
I did not understand that I was in it

946
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,910
I thought to get used to it

947
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:09,550
But I'm all that is

948
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:11,900
I already understand

949
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:25,250
Then go and talk to Bruyn

950
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:36,450
He wanted to get away from me. I did not come near him.
You will not want to see me at all

951
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:51,650
I can not

952
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:55,060
Looks like the mood

953
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:58,290
The other one is not romantic with Bremen
Did you say?

954
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:01,710
No more mess ups
Drink this

955
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:10,880
Get this first
Hold it

956
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:19,060
We need to celebrate today
Do you know what happiness is? What are you doing?

957
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:58,350
Who gets loose
Where is Shiva?

958
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:14,300
What happened?
That was good

959
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:22,310
That's why the truth's out there coming out

960
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:34,180
Where are you going? Want to go
to where?

961
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:48,720
I want him. She can not be
Kept smiling. He's mine

962
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:58,950
Without him...
Tell me, let me tell you. Let's go and say sorry

963
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:03,940
What's so urgent?
You can not be too late for a second

964
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:17,040
Even if the heart is in the left
It's always correct

965
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:42,660
What is Frenner's room?
That way. That one

966
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:50,790
Son, who are you?
Where is Brin?

967
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:54,030
I went to the village
Did you go to the village? What are you talking about?

968
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,930
Tell me where.
Why are you going to the village?

969
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:01,890
Leave

970
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:07,680
Who do you want?
Bring Ryan, come out. He should speak too

971
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:12,980
Why? I love her
It came to talk. Say sorry

972
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:19,160
He went to marry his cousin
Do not lie. Tell him to come

973
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:23,790
Bring that one
Here

974
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:03,680
Talk to the doctor
A small wound. Can go two weeks

975
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:36,790
Are you here?

976
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:39,440
Here it is

977
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:48,820
What's crying?

978
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:51,150
What happened?

979
01:55:52,240 --> 01:56:05,710
I was lying to me. Not since childhood
A good guy comes from the sky

980
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:11,710
Come on. A royal prince arrives
I was crazy

981
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:16,100
Otherwise, once for once, to me

982
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:23,620
If the fate guy sucked you, you would
be kissing, and you would come by

983
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:32,770
If there's a good person coming up
It's him who understands me. You did not say...

984
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:35,090
The rackets are done

985
01:56:49,850 --> 01:56:52,480
I want her mom
Somehow I want to

986
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:57,420
Dad's downstairs. Let's talk to him
You must definitely get married

987
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:00,800
Hold on, sir
Thanks

988
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:05,580
Hey. Dad
What happened?

989
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:11,870
What's crying? Do not marry me.
What happened?

990
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:18,300
She loves someone
From childhood, all of you are all right

991
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:21,020
I thought that nobody else wanted the world anymore

992
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:27,230
Now he's just staying all without you
It feels like I can live

993
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:32,110
I need him
That's how Dad loves it

994
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:42,780
All right, you stay
Stay

995
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:44,010
Do not Cry

996
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:52,790
You should be happy
This is not getting married. You're happy

997
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,000
I'll get to them and talk to you

998
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:59,420
Tell me

999
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:02,320
Her name is Siva
Uncle's name is Krishna

1000
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:05,410
It came to the marriage that day

1001
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:27,410
You said the name of someone, but he was at his foot.
Right now, this is a scam

1002
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:35,190
But now you do not. Even if that boy is accepted
He does not accept his father

1003
01:58:35,690 --> 01:58:39,140
This is not done because of her son

1004
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:41,260
Why, Dad

1005
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:42,320
why?

1006
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:48,480
He was my friend a while ago
That means he's a my enemy at a time

1007
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:51,120
She escaped with my hired sister

1008
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,840
My siblings killed my sister

1009
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,230
My siblings have cheated me

1010
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:28,690
One of them took the aunt
You think so

1011
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,080
I think it's love

1012
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:51,300
I do not know how much you are.
I believe in fraud. It's the same

1013
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:56,200
I refused
Can

1014
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:57,470
Say no

1015
02:00:08,390 --> 02:00:10,870
I will do the same as Aunt
what is doing?

1016
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:22,800
I can do anything
You can escape

1017
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:28,620
Even bigger is himself
I am also a human

1018
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:33,680
Me, sadness, anger, insecurity have everything

1019
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:39,910
It's born a little earlier than you
There must be a little bit of resentment

1020
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:46,550
If it's not enough, I'll kill him

1021
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:50,660
Whose kill? She
Those kids?

1022
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:54,970
Little children are these. Then my inside
The one who's staying inside me

1023
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:58,520
I'm dead
I'm here

1024
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:00,040
Be mindful

1025
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:16,130
Because he's your father
Threatening a little girl

1026
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,280
You stay
I'll call

1027
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:23,460
No, Mom

1028
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:28,900
In your dad's words you see a threat

1029
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:32,330
I'm sorry, Mom

1030
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:36,960
Okay
This is my bar

1031
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:45,070
This marriage will not stop
Not for me

1032
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:51,950
I'll marry your dad

1033
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:29,580
Not the problem
What is the real problem?

1034
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:36,800
He loves father

1035
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:45,150
Who is that girl?
Bramanambā

1036
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:48,490
How long since?
From a year

1037
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:53,100
I had to say it.
This did not even tell him

1038
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:57,350
What happened?

1039
02:02:59,650 --> 02:03:00,940
To say love

1040
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:04,960
Talk to me
Stop it, Dad

1041
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:11,050
At least it's okay to talk
Did not say

1042
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:17,630
Now he left me completely
His lassa will marry

1043
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:27,340
How happy this year is?

1044
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,220
Because she's gone now
It's very sad

1045
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:45,920
Who's with whom?
How long are you?

1046
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:48,760
God has written down first

1047
02:03:50,410 --> 02:03:53,880
Forget that girl

1048
02:03:56,150 --> 02:04:02,180
You can not cope with the tears of your eyes

1049
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:07,340
That's why you did not say dad

1050
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:47,910
My daughter loves you
Come with me

1051
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:57,220
Come with me anyway

1052
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:02,970
He cried I can not wait.
Your father's been years ago

1053
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:07,350
That his sister had run away
Now you can not give

1054
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:10,900
Their problems are for their lives
Can not be destroyed

1055
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:16,690
Want to pay for my sins?

1056
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:19,690
Take it, son

1057
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:23,730
Take my daughter

1058
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:45,120
Can you help me escape? What's wrong?
His mother. This is what you think

1059
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:54,370
He'll come in on purpose
She can not come to this village

1060
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:58,640
Whatever you do, okay
If you want to kill him

1061
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:11,110
This thing was never talking to you
But let me tell you

1062
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:17,990
After Agni 's sister Priya was engaged
Found walking along the road

1063
02:06:20,130 --> 02:06:24,150
Come on
Come on

1064
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:25,550
Get in the car

1065
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:31,540
Where are you going now?

1066
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:43,110
tell me

1067
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:44,370
Nothing

1068
02:06:44,830 --> 02:06:45,930
Something is hiding

1069
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,790
I'm not going to a friend

1070
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:53,530
I'm waiting for the elite of the next village
We both run away

1071
02:06:56,020 --> 02:06:57,530
Our elder?
Yes

1072
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:00,430
We've been in love for over two years

1073
02:07:03,250 --> 02:07:05,520
Stay
I'll talk to you

1074
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:07,660
Do not you, Krishna
do not

1075
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:10,610
It's okay to go this way, Priya
I'll talk to you

1076
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:30,380
Priya died

1077
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:34,130
After 3 days, I went to your old house

1078
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:38,130
It was ready for a wedding

1079
02:07:39,710 --> 02:07:42,270
Everyone looked at me wisely

1080
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:45,510
I saw him and he was angry

1081
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:59,240
Leave me. My sister's dead
It was an accident

1082
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:02,560
I ran away from my sister, right?

1083
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:08,200
He took you out of the arithmetemy
I did not even think I was gone

1084
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:22,080
Tell me how to say this
It's not possible. Priya is dead

1085
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:28,880
Crisha ran away
It cheated us

1086
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:32,190
Awah's cooks and friends say

1087
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:36,280
My parents are my sister
 I got married and gave him my life

1088
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:39,010
I protected my family's honor

1089
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:46,450
This is all Pabkach's acting

1090
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:51,300
He married Olde's sister for the property

1091
02:08:51,410 --> 02:08:53,900
I trusted Prabhakar's lie

1092
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:55,710
Go to

1093
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:57,550
Pull him out and get out

1094
02:08:58,970 --> 02:09:02,450
Know the truth of that turmoil
I was not in a state of mind

1095
02:09:03,530 --> 02:09:06,100
Prove the truth
Not even a witness

1096
02:09:06,990 --> 02:09:11,550
Even so. Dude girl's life
Because they can not be destroyed

1097
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,000
It's from there

1098
02:09:16,690 --> 02:09:18,910
How unusual is that?
Got Dad?

1099
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:23,410
He had to speak right then, Dad

1100
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:26,860
I do not have much evidence to show my friendship

1101
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:34,460
Sincerity was a lie
What to say?

1102
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:38,280
I do not want to stop your marriage

1103
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:41,880
You come with the girl

1104
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:47,910
But whatever
Remember it's my friend

1105
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:44,790
But whatever
Remember it's my friend

1106
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:47,150
She can not be anything

1107
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:34,400
Your dad took my sister away. Until you take away my daughter
Waiting for me to wait?

1108
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:36,730
Do you take my daughter?

1109
02:13:37,970 --> 02:13:39,440
Nægiṭapan
 - Get up

1110
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:47,940
Take the cell. Take your daddy away
Do not call Karp you are getting beaten today

1111
02:13:56,110 --> 02:14:01,180
Hello, hello
Who is this?

1112
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:12,730
My name is Siva. You're getting married
Not with your son. With me

1113
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:20,950
Writing in the card
Bridegroom Shiva Manemalie Bramanama

1114
02:14:23,650 --> 02:14:24,970
This is permanent

1115
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:40,130
No, my dad understood it wrong

1116
02:14:40,850 --> 02:14:43,320
Now I do not understand

1117
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:46,570
There are many things you do not know

1118
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:55,850
A New Deceit? not
Bitter truth

1119
02:14:55,910 --> 02:14:57,320
What's the truth?

1120
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:15,620
Seems like a fool
Are you making a new story for my daughter?

1121
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:21,310
What evidence?
I do not have the evidence. Your home is

1122
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:29,260
Let's write those Pabkar letters to your nurse
All your pictures are with your little sister

1123
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:38,730
What would you do if you said?
I was not scared

1124
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:45,720
The pain of your sister's eyes does not look
For years, she's crying

1125
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:48,130
I can go and ask him

1126
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:51,800
He's got pictures now, he's got letters

1127
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,280
Come on, come on

1128
02:16:07,010 --> 02:16:13,270
Say, those letters, the pictures are there
Showing, Showing1-2 of 2

1129
02:16:14,450 --> 02:16:16,180
What do you have in your pictures?

1130
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:18,250
Where did you hide?
Says

1131
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:20,900
Says
You've been looking forward

1132
02:16:21,220 --> 02:16:22,350
What else is suspicious?

1133
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:28,800
Where?
Says. Says

1134
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:12,250
Compensation years ago
I have no evidence to prove myself

1135
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:17,580
Show me a lie
There was no other way other than that

1136
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:24,390
The one who made the mistake was the proof

1137
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:28,990
I did not forget to use the phone

1138
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:32,120
The strongest line

1139
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:42,480
Come on, move it
Deu, turn this around

1140
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:49,780
Are you kidding me?

1141
02:17:56,870 --> 02:17:57,960
Where's my dad?

1142
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:02,390
Come. why
Look, I thought

1143
02:18:22,250 --> 02:18:23,400
Just sit here

1144
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:38,480
Be careful

1145
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:52,450
Go in and go and open the door
Get out of here

1146
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:27,460
He told me to wait for my son
Here she is

1147
02:19:34,110 --> 02:19:38,090
You misunderstood me
I told her what happened

1148
02:19:38,190 --> 02:19:40,090
Come on, my ghetto
Marekksmi trusted me

1149
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:57,840
A better man than I could get me

1150
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:00,190
This is your royal prince

1151
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:13,730
Bramanambaṭa...
Have you got a laugh?

1152
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:15,950
It was love

1153
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:26,860
My filial grandfather
I need a bridesmaid

1154
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:31,490
If she cries, she'll be kissing kisses
You should be a good person

1155
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:35,930
In a word, a royal prince
I need someone who likes it

1156
02:20:39,090 --> 02:20:41,210
See, the story changed

1157
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:45,540
Look at a girl as a queen
Kanyi Raja Kumara

1158
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,430
From now on this is permanent

1159
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:50,700
Do not you dare?
Now say it. I have no connection

1160
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,490
Please, do not

1161
02:20:58,650 --> 02:21:00,840
He's falling into his eyes
Okay

1162
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:04,470
Now she says it's not related afterwards

1163
02:21:04,770 --> 02:21:06,750
Because you do not have anything to do with anything?

1164
02:21:10,660 --> 02:21:12,640
Now she says no connection
