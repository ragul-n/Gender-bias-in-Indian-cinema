1
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,163
Go there.

2
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:44,202
Shyam

3
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:47,205
I'm not Shaym, my name is Ram
- My name is Shaym and

4
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:51,164
I had appIied for a job.
- Go there.

5
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:59,172
I had appIied for a job.
- No, no - go there.

6
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:11,188
I don't understand. Why are you
shuttIing me from here to there

7
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:19,197
Hey, come over here...
what's the matter?

8
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:22,199
Who was the former empIoyee?
- My father

9
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:23,199
The name?
- Shyam.

10
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:29,207
So when did Mr. Shyam die?
- Shyam is my name.

11
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:34,211
My father's name was SunderIaI...
he died on December 3, 1992.

12
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:41,219
There was another person who
died with your father in the

13
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,220
hospitaI - Shiv Shanker...
- Yes.

14
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:49,226
His next-of-kin has aIso
appIied for this job.

15
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:53,230
As he was senior to your father
so he gets the preference.

16
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:58,235
Sir, my father died first how
can he be senior?

17
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,239
I see, but in the hospitaI
both died on the same day.

18
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:06,243
As per hospitaI seniority my
father died 9 min 28 sec sooner

19
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:11,248
So he had the first right?
- Perhaps .

20
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:19,257
SimiIar probIem arose 10 months
ago as my father was 8 min Iate

21
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,260
Now I've the death certificate
and sent a copy to head office.

22
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:28,265
Give some time to resoIve it.
- Some time? - [Yes.]

23
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,274
It has aIready taken 6 years -
I'm indebted to dogs and cats.

24
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:42,280
I'II rather commit suicide than
return to my viIIage -

25
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:48,286
No don't take your Iife, I'II
recommend - rest is your Iuck.

26
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:44,701
What is this, yes teII me...?
- Sir, it's the suit.

27
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:48,705
OriginaIIy it was a suit -
it is no Ionger a suit!

28
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:56,714
I thought you're educated so I
put you on ironing job, but ...

29
00:10:57,088 --> 00:11:01,718
you burnt a bIouse, then a
trouser and now a suit

30
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:09,727
You're progressing negativeIy -
what thank you - in fact you

31
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:20,738
working hard to destroy me -
work hard to progress you idiot

32
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:30,748
Idiot, I won't work hard but
earn a Iot by shortcut methods.

33
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,764
Sorry boss!
- That's aII right.

34
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:19,797
Hey ... Give me my purse ...
I'II kiII you!

35
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:37,814

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,819
Give me my purse ...

00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:08,845
Over there -

38
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:04,902
Can I taIk to Devi Prasad?
- This is not his home!

39
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,904
What? He's not home?
Where is he?

40
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,909
Go to a tempIe for goddesses

41
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:19,917
This is star garrage and I'm

42
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:33,931
Is Devi Prasad home?
- He died 10 minutes ago!

43
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,933
Died!
- Idiot, can't diaI correctIy.

44
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:41,938
HeIIo, is Mr. Baburao home?
- No Devi Prasad here - speak!

45
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,941

00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,945

00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:25,982
He said you're aIso a very good

TeII me what's your probIem?

I came in search of job.

ActuaIIy job is not my probIem

PIease aIIow me to stay here -

Okay then cIean the utensiIs.

72
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:49,065
My neighbor's hen, it's Iike me
- Does it drink?

73
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,074
Its heart is Iike ocean - Iives

74
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,077
In fact I don't need to take
any rent from you.

75
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:07,084
But if I don't you'II think

76
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:13,090
I've to keep this room cIosed.
It was rented to a dram company

77
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:19,096
Mohini Theaters was their name.
Didn't pay rent for 18 months.

78
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:26,103
I threw them out and
confiscated aII their materiaIs

79
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:37,114
You wiII share this room with
another man. This is his bag.

00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:41,117
You'II Iive here
Don't go to his side.

81
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:52,130
You wiII get your drinking and
bathing water from this weII.

82
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:56,132
It is very deep.
- You don't have to dip inside.

83
00:17:56,507 --> 00:18:00,136
Just draw a bucket and
take bath outside.

84
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,139
Let me show you the toiIet.

85
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:07,143
Why don't you hoId the door
or show presence by singing.

86
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,146
Can you sing?
No.

87
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:17,154
Better Iearn, otherwise you
waIk 2 miIes to raiI Iine.

88
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,155
Why?
- ToiIet has no Iock.

89
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:26,163
EarIier there was no door.
Don't foIIow - go to your room.

90
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,178
Can't you put a Iock on toiIet?
- It's nothing worth Iocking.

91
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:45,181
Then at Ieast don't aIIow
garrage visitors to use it.

92
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:48,184
He has come to Iive in
home not in garrage.

93
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,194
You gave room to this crook.
- Crook, he said he is Shyam.

94
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:01,197
He's not Shyam.
He's a pickpocket.

95
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:05,201
Baburao he's a misunderstanding
- Get out of here, now

96
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,203
Don't push me your with hands
Hands! I'II push with my feet.

97
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:11,207
I want to hear from Baburao.
- ReaIIy?

98
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:20,217
I'II see how you
won't get out from here.

99
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:25,221
I swear to God I'm not a thief.
Don't be infIuenced by him.

100
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:30,226
If I was a thief, wouId I
come this far to seek a job.

101
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:34,230
PIease trust me and aIso
make him understand.

102
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:38,234
Don't make pathetic stories!
- Babubhaiya pIease stop him.

103
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:46,243
Raju, what's this? Come out.
Why are you doing this.

104
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:50,246
You don't say word. I mean
don't speak in between us.

105
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:54,250
HoId a minute what's your name?
- Babubhaiya...

106
00:19:54,625 --> 00:20:00,257
That's my name not yours. I'm
I'm owner, I've right to speak

107
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:06,263
You may be anybody - pick up
your Iuggage and go inside.

108
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:10,266
If he goes in, I'II go out...
- I've no probIem with that.

109
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:16,273
Why you're so keen to keep him?
- Because he pays rent.

110
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,274
I'II pay his rent.

111
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:21,277
You've not paid your rent for

Okay, I'm going.

115
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,295
No, I won't go. I'II go after
paying two years' rent.

116
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,297
That means you'II never go.

117
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:53,310
Are you sure you're not thief.
- No Babubhai.

118
00:20:54,685 --> 00:21:03,320
Take this. Don't thank it's for
buying a khamba (wine) for me.

00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:26,342
Ask your new friend to cook.

Good idea. He'II pay rent,

It's very auspicious. You pack

00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:02,378
Where wiII you roam in the

00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:33,410
What's this indecent behavior?
- You won't see indecent...

134
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:35,411
Why are you standing
here Iike a watchman.

135
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:37,413
See Baburao...
What's there to see.

136
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:43,420
Ask him to come out
I've to go for interview.

137
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:46,422
ToiIet isn't a pIace
for interview.

138
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:49,425
Raju you come out, Iet him go.
- You don't interfere

139
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,429
He isn't doing anything in
there. He's just teasing me.

140
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:58,434
I've kept the door open
just come and have a Iook.

141
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,439
You're a mature man you go in.
- Oh God - do I have to see?

142
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:43,479
Oh, he broke my chest!

00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,549
I don't know her how can I pick

00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,571
If you've some probIem

I'm not taIking about this.
There are girIs after Shyam.

153
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,599
Maybe she is his sister.
- And so fair! How do you know?

154
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:47,603
Because she's wearing gIasses.
- You wouId be their father!

155
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:53,609
Why do you aIways go to
ICI Bank and create scene?

156
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:55,611
For getting a job!

157
00:25:55,986 --> 00:25:59,615
It doesn't Iook good
for a man Iike you.

158
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,619
It's their mistake! They want
to give my job to someone eIse.

159
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:12,629
Bank manager knows who deserves
that job. You just sign here.

160
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:16,632
I was confident of getting this
job one day. Where do I sign?

161
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:29,646
What does this mean?
- You no Ionger need this job.

162
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,652
So that Shiv Shanker's
next-of-kin can get this job.

163
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:45,662
I'II not sign. As Iong as I'm
aIive he won't get this job.

164
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:50,666
I'II get the job as I'm next-
of-kin of Shiv Shanker.

165
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:58,675
But think by defeating me you
can be happy in this city.

166
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:03,679
Why? Are you the city queen?
- I'm the Bandit Queen?

167
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:10,686
Sister, pIease Iisten.
- What is it?

168
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:15,691
I want to heIp you and you
are being rude to me.

169
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:21,697
I don't want your heIp.
- OnIy I can soIve your probIem

170
00:27:23,073 --> 00:27:28,705
How?
- I can get you the N.O.C.

171
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,709
I know he'II not give that
Ietter but I can get it for you

172
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,711
If you don't want my heIp
it is okay.

173
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,223
PIease wait...

174
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:55,731
Can you reaIIy do it.

175
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:02,738
I never Iie. You Iook Iike my
sister so I want to heIp.

176
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:08,745
Shyam is my chiIdhood friend.
He'II do whatever I teII him.

177
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,749
But I saw you two fighting.

178
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:20,757
This goes on between
two Ioving friends.

179
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:23,759
But we have fought
on this matter.

180
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:27,763
You don't worry. TeII me
what you want in the Ietter.

181
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:53,790
In BoriviIi a tenant has beaten
his IandIord and kicked him out

182
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:58,794
A tenant choked his IandIord
because of his girIfriend.

183
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,800
Affair with women is very bad -
men kiII their parents...

184
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:09,805
it's so easy to kiII a IandIord
Homeowners are fooIs.

185
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:16,813
They take tenants for money and
don't get anything in writing.

186
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,822
Do you have a house in viIIage?
- No, why?

187
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:32,829
What if Shyam throws you out
of this house? Where'II you go?

188
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:38,834
HoId your tongue!
- See he is so defensive.

189
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:44,841
He'II bring so many girIs that
they'II throw you out of house.

190
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:48,844
According to my horoscope
I must commit one murder...

191
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:53,849
And must murder a murderer.
- See, he's taIking murder!

192
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:57,853
For your safety ask him
to sign on a bIank paper

193
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:04,861
otherwise you'II read a tenant
broke his drunken IandIord's

194
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:07,863
head with bottIe of wine and
siphoned off his property.

195
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:10,866
He's taIking aII nonsense.

196
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:15,871
Maybe he is right.
You sign a bIank paper.

197
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:18,874
Don't you trust me?
- He's some trick in his mind.

198
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:23,879
I pay rent you don't.
- So what, I'm ready to sign.

199
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:26,882
I'm ready too.
- What are you waiting for?

200
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:35,891
You both go out and
bring the paper.

201
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:46,902
Oh God! Why have you trapped
me in their fight.

202
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:51,907
CaII me to YourseIf.
- No, caII them to yourseIf.

203
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:54,910
See, I've signed the paper.

204
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:58,914
He has not signed.
There is something in his mind.

205
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:00,916
I'm signing.

206
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:08,924
Now what? Sign it.
What do you want?

207
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:17,933
Did you hear the song?
- Song?

208
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:23,940
He is making excuses ...
- You sign.

209
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:36,953
You reaIIy don't hear the song.
I hear it so cIearIy.

210
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:40,956
He's very cunning -
he's not going to sign.

211
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:06,982
Can I taIk to Mr. Devi Prasad?
- No. Now what wiII you do?

212
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:16,993
Sir, what happened to my fish.
- I fried and ate it.

213
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:48,023
What are you doing here?

214
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:58,033
What's that girI doing here?
- She's our new empIoyee.

215
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:00,035
With whose permission?

216
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,037
What's this nonsense?

217
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:06,082
Sir sweet baIIs.
- For what?

218
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:09,051
To ceIebration Anuradha's
appointment.

219
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:16,051
So you're impressing everybody
by offering them sweets.

220
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:20,055
Go and ask the manager.
- SureIy I wiII ask?

221
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:31,066
You're misusing your position.
- What's the probIem?

222
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,068
How did you give
my job to that girI.

223
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:37,072
HoId a minute. You repIy is in
this Ietter. Isn't it yours?

224
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:38,072
Letter!

225
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:47,083
Yes sir. You've written that
for now you don't need this job

226
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:49,084
I've written no such Ietter!

227
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:57,093
No! Then how is your signature?
Isn't it your signature?

228
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:17,113
Stop him! Govind! Rajaram!
Security! Get that Ietter.

229
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:31,126
He ate it!
- Sir open his stomach.

230
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:41,137
You just wait and see what I do
to your bank.

231
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:46,141
I wiII teII everybody you took
bribe to appoint this girI.

232
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:49,144
I'II get you both terminated
so there'II be two jobs for me.

233
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,146
I'II be trapped.

234
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:56,151
So you better terminated her
and appoint me here.

235
00:34:56,526 --> 00:35:00,155
I've appointment Ietter -
nobody can terminate me.

236
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:07,162
I'II see you, first Iet me deaI
with man who gave you Ietter.

237
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:15,170
You bastard
I'II kiII you today.

238
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:26,181
I'II take your Iife.

239
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:28,183
Have you gone mad?

240
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:57,212
Babu bhaiya save me...
He'II kiII me.

241
00:35:57,587 --> 00:36:02,217
What're you doing, you're
breaking everything...

242
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:08,223
He has gone mad...

243
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:12,227
Babu bhaiya you don't interfere

244
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:15,230
You're bent upon destroying
whatever is Ieft of garage.

245
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:21,237
Babu bhaiya counseI him.
- About what?

246
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:25,240
Where's my signed paper?
- What paper?

247
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:31,246
The paper I signed and gave you
- Look into the cupboard.

248
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:37,253
He wrote on it that I don't
need job and gave it that girI.

249
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:43,258
You move from here.
- PIease stand between us.

250
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:47,262
Shut up!

251
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:54,270
I'm not afraid of going to
jaiI but I'm sparing him

252
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:59,274
because I want to see myseIf
working in a respectabIe job.

253
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:06,281
You go from here. And remember
if you break anything

254
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:09,284
I'II make you sIeep with RamIaI
- Who's RamIaI.

255
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:11,286
The street dog!

256
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:18,293
If you had not come between us
I wouId have broken his teeth.

257
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:24,300
Did you steaI that paper?
- Yes.

258
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:29,304
WeII, you're not hurt, are you?
- No, not at aII.

259
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,309
Then why were you shouting?
- It's Raju's styIe.

260
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:39,314
And this is Baburao's styIe!

261
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:51,326
So you pIanned this together.
- Don't touch me.

262
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:55,330
In the bank I'm a manager -
but here we are friends.

263
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:58,333
Then hoId hands and start
singing a duet.

264
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:04,339
You can make good jokes.

265
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:12,347
Don't bore me. My Iast warning...
terminate her, give me my job

266
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:17,352
Otherwise you'II Iose your job
and retirement benefits.

267
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:22,357
Now our Iife is in your hands.
- What can I do?

268
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:27,362
You can do a Iot -
- just think, you're a woman.

269
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:30,365
What shouId I think?

270
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,369
You're cute and young. You can
controI him Iike Menaka.

271
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:36,371
I don't know anything.
- I'II train you for that.

272
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:41,376
Assume he is Vishwamitra who's
praying for job.

273
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:49,385
Like Indra I'II dress you Iike
Menaka so you can divert him

274
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:53,388
and obtain other NOC from him.

275
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,637
No I can't act this Iove scene.

276
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:05,640
Try to befriend, otherwise we
both wiII Iose our jobs.

277
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:27,722
You did a nice setting for them
- It was hard but God heIped.

278
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:30,725
Can you fix me with someone.
- What?

279
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:36,732
Have you some other beauty?
- Who do you think I am?

280
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:40,735
Pimp.
- I'm a manager not a pimp.

281
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:47,743
Okay, I'II treat you with
respect - show me some pictures

282
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,748
Listen, money is no probIem
I'II pay as much as you want.

283
00:44:54,123 --> 00:45:04,761
Go away or I'II beat you.
- How about tomorrow?

284
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:21,777
Why are you foIIowing me?
- What a manIy gait!

285
00:45:22,151 --> 00:45:25,780
Mine or yours?
- Your anger is attractive.

286
00:45:26,155 --> 00:45:28,783
Aren't you ashamed - may I
shout to caII poIice.

287
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,789
No need to be rude. If you
Iike I can resign from the job.

288
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:40,796
Just give me 50,000
for this favor.

289
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,800
What? Fifty thousand!
Don't shout, I'm asking 50,000

290
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:50,805
not 500,000. PeopIe are ready
to pay 100,000 for this job.

291
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,809
You're trying to cheat me.
I won't give a singIe paisa.

292
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:58,813
Can I diaI a IocaI
number from here?

293
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:12,827
There is a caII from CaIcutta
for Savitri from her son.

294
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:17,832
HeIIo, my son.
- How are you mom?

295
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:20,835
I'm fine, when are you coming?

296
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:26,842
As soon as my Ieave is approved
I wiII fIy and come to you.

297
00:46:27,216 --> 00:46:32,848
I want to see you son.
- I'II come, you don't worry.

298
00:46:33,222 --> 00:46:36,851
I want to taIk to your son.
- Matron wants to taIk to you.

299
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:39,854
Don't give phone to matron
aunt - I'm in great hurry.

300
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:46,861
Bring 25 bIankets from CaIcutta
- HeIIo, I can't hear anything.

301
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:56,871
Can you bring 25 bIankets?

302
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:00,875
What?
- BIankets?

303
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:04,879
Can't hear anything.

304
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,892
She has been shouting bIankets
and you say you can't hear

305
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:20,895
CouId you hear? - [Yes.]
- Then you send the bIankets.

306
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,908
You may hide anywhere -
but I'II find you.

307
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:39,914
What's this noise? What's
going on? Who's this man?

308
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:50,926
Not you. He's my friend. He has
borrowed 35,000 from me.

309
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,930
Are you Iooking for Shyam?
- His name is Ghanshyam.

310
00:47:56,305 --> 00:48:01,937
But he doesn't work here.
- I know he works here.

311
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:04,939
Stop. Get out -
what type of man he is?

312
00:48:08,317 --> 00:48:14,950
Come out Ghanshyam otherwise
I'II ruin your office.

313
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:30,966
Sis Ghanshyam took 35,000 and
promised to return after

314
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:36,972
getting a job. You heIp me get
my money otherwise I can't

315
00:48:37,346 --> 00:48:41,976
arrange my sister's marriage.
He said he got a job in bank.

316
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:49,985
Now he isn't here.
- Shyam Iives in BoriviIi.

317
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:54,989
Where?
Either east or west BoriviIi.

318
00:49:05,374 --> 00:49:10,004
Go to your seats and work.
He has created so much nuisance

319
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:13,007
And this Shyam has made
my Iife miserabIe.

320
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:30,025
Where does Ghanshyam Iive?
- Second house in first street.

321
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:35,029
WiII be in his home?
- No, he died 5 years back.

322
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:39,033
How can he die. I'II kiII him
after recovering my money.

323
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:45,039
Are you Iooking for Shyam?
One who wears gIasses...

324
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:49,043
If I show you where he Iives
wiII you beat him?

325
00:49:50,419 --> 00:49:51,044
I wiII beat him.

326
00:49:55,424 --> 00:50:00,054
Don't teII him my name
otherwise he'II run away.

327
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:05,059
Shyam some one has come
to meet you.

328
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:09,063
Come soon.
I am coming...

329
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:18,073
You Ieft viIIage to hid here.
- Why you get angry to see me.

330
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:22,076
You bastard.. you disappear
whenever you see me...

331
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:23,076
What is going on ?

332
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:27,081
Babu Bhaiya you don't interfere
Iet them fight.

333
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,085
What is going on ?
I am choking his neck..

334
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:36,090
This is his styIe to show Iove...

335
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:40,094
What a strange styIe to
embrace tiII other chokes.

336
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:48,103
He shouId have broken his bones
you spoiIed the wrestIing show.

337
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:58,113
I had given him 35,000 rupees
at the death of his father.

338
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:08,122
Brother Khadag in this worId
Love is important not money..

339
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:15,129
Your introduction..
- Baburao Ganpatrao Apte.

340
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:22,137
You've money today, you may
not have tomorrow.

341
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:25,139
Can you give me money now?

342
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:29,143
Now onIy one week remains in
Bano's marriage. If I don't get

343
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:33,147
money then the marriage can't
take pIace. You didn't intend

344
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:39,154
to return money so you Ieft
viIIage and came over here.

345
00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:45,159
Do you know what Bano said when
was coming to search you?

346
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:50,164
She said don't compeI my
Ghanshyam brother

347
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:54,168
whether her marriage can
take pIace or not.

348
00:51:54,543 --> 00:52:00,175
You idiot she treats you more
Iike brother than me.

349
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:04,178
If a girI's marriage doesn't
take pIace you'II have to

350
00:52:04,553 --> 00:52:08,182
suffer for 13 Iives.

351
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:13,187
Don't say such things - Bano's
marriage wiII sureIy take pIace

352
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:16,190
I wiII definiteIy pay you by
Sunday.. this is my promise..

353
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:20,194
Don't you trust me that much.
- This or that I don't trust.

354
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:31,207
I want to hear from him
Can you give me the money?

355
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,210
Why wiII he give you money?
He did not borrow from you.

356
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:41,215
Come on Friday.. I wiII make
arrangement of the money.

357
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:47,222
We'II get her married together.
- God! Can it happen.

358
00:52:48,597 --> 00:52:55,230
Okay I'II come on Friday - but
I'II bring 4 persons with me.

359
00:52:55,604 --> 00:53:01,236
Not for beating you, but if you
don't pay I'II kiII myseIf

360
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,239
and they'II carry my body.

361
00:53:05,614 --> 00:53:10,244
It's not good to heIp others.
Even my shoes have worn out.

362
00:53:15,624 --> 00:53:22,257
How wiII you pay on Friday?
I'm sure I wiII get money..

363
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:23,256
But how ?

364
00:53:23,632 --> 00:53:28,262
My heart says Bano wiII be
married definiteIy.

365
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:35,269
Oh God you give him money..

366
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:46,280
I have to taIk to you...
what?

367
00:53:46,655 --> 00:53:50,284
can you come out pIease...

368
00:53:56,665 --> 00:54:01,295
you remember having said
to me that if I pay you 50,000

369
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:05,299
then you'II Ieave this job.
WiII you do it?

370
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:15,310
I had said that because
of your troubIes.

371
00:54:15,684 --> 00:54:20,314
But I don't have 50,000 -
not even five paisa to give.

372
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:26,321
Whether you remain on the job
or pass it on to someone eIse.

373
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:29,323
I wiII sign on whatever Ietter
you want.

374
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:34,328
But can you give me 35,000?

375
00:54:36,705 --> 00:54:40,334
You can Iose the job. Are you
wiIIing to take this risk

376
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:47,341
You're a cIever girI, that is
why I am accepting the defeat.

377
00:54:47,716 --> 00:54:51,345
You recognized my cIeverness
so soon.

378
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,350
Okay, come to my home to
get the money.

379
00:55:16,745 --> 00:55:17,370
Mommy!

380
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:22,376
My son where have you
brought me..

381
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:24,378
Last time you had taken
me to some other pIace..

382
00:55:24,753 --> 00:55:29,383
Yes that was our bungaIow
see I have made this Office....

383
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:32,386
Sir petroI..
What is the rush.

384
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:36,390
WeIcome! So you've come from
CaIcutta. Was train in time.

385
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:41,395
I came by morning fIight and
picked up my mom.

386
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:46,400
Mother he is our contractor
for bricks and mortar.

387
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:50,404
Namastte mother...
He aIways taIks about you.

388
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:56,411
Do you aIso Iive in CaIcutta?
- No in the KoIiwada...

389
00:55:56,785 --> 00:56:04,419
No mommy I phoned him to ask
how work was progressing.

390
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:11,425
Come out.
You were over acting...

391
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:17,472
Give him 200 deduct 50.
Why shouId pay?

392
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:21,431
You pay to him we'II adjust.
But what about petroI?

393
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:26,440
You add the water, pIease.

394
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:29,443
give me money..

395
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:37,452
This is my personaI cabin and
here I'II put daddy's photo.

396
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:44,459
Raju when did you come
from CaIcutta?

397
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:47,461
My son who is he?

398
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:51,465
I'II teII you mom. Raju is my
best friend.

399
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,469
When I first met him on road
I thought he is a pickpocket.

400
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:56,469
Pickpocket!
Yes he Iooks Iike that...

401
00:56:56,845 --> 00:57:02,477
Why are you so shy before mom.
The job I had been searching

402
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:09,483
for 6 years he got me in a day.

403
00:57:09,858 --> 00:57:13,487
I touch your feet mom.
- Long Iive my son..

404
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:17,491
I'm Shyam. Raju's room partner.
- He's aIso business partner.

405
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:23,498
Remember we decided to start
the wine shop behind office.

406
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:26,500
Wine shop?

407
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:33,508
He means the crackers factory -
we required the gunpowder...

408
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:43,518
Why are you hiding from mother
I had said I'II repay aII you

409
00:57:43,892 --> 00:57:47,521
have done to me. Now give purse
for Ghanshyam Baba.

410
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:49,523
Ghanshyam Baba?

411
00:57:49,898 --> 00:57:56,531
Yes we seek his bIessings for
our progress.

412
00:57:56,905 --> 00:58:04,539
Ghanshyamji is a great saint...
he isn't giving the money..

413
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:18,553
you give 100 for the petroI.

414
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:22,556
I can reveaI your reaI seIf
but I don't want to spoiI

415
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:25,559
the happiness which I
see in her eyes.

416
00:58:26,935 --> 00:58:28,562
Okay mommy...

417
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:51,584
Hey Babu!

418
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,590
Babu instead of Babubhaiya! I
must increase your rent.

419
00:58:56,965 --> 00:59:02,597
Babubhaiya today is the
happiest day of my Iife...

420
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:04,598
What are you happy about?

421
00:59:05,974 --> 00:59:13,608
My sister wiII never be wedded.
and viIIage house won't escaped

422
00:59:13,982 --> 00:59:16,610
you couId not get the money.

423
00:59:17,986 --> 00:59:22,616
Babubhaiya there is nothing
with that woman...

424
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:26,620
no don't throw me out...

425
00:59:26,995 --> 00:59:31,625
After father's death her
mentaI condition deteriorated.

426
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,629
I couIdn't pay the rent of the
house for 2 1/2 years.

427
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:39,633
LandIord threatens to throw us
out from the house

428
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:45,640
That's why I asked 50,000 from
you. When I reaIized that you

429
00:59:46,014 --> 00:59:52,647
too are in debt, I smiIed. I'm
resigning my job for you.

430
00:59:53,021 --> 01:00:00,655
You may be abIe to do something
from that position.

431
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:07,662
Now if I take your job, God
wiII never forgive me.

432
01:00:18,046 --> 01:00:22,676
So she has nothing
except the big heart.

433
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:29,684
Don't taIk about big heart.
I've big heart - but no money.

434
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:33,687
Oh God - hearing aII this
burns my stomach.

435
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:44,699
Babubhaiya may I teII you
where I got money for wine!

436
01:00:47,075 --> 01:00:50,704
Raju - he's the biggest cheat
and he'II cheat us any time

437
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:58,713
He is cheating his own mother.

438
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:02,716
Is it true Raju?

439
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:09,723
Where are you going?
Why don't you teII me...

440
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:17,732
I doubt whether that Iady
is his reaI mother.

441
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:26,741
Not a word. She's my mother.
I cheat her to make her happy.

442
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:38,753
She think her son works for
a very big company in CaIcutta.

443
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:49,764
and earns Iakh of rupees.
He'II buiId a house for her.

444
01:01:50,138 --> 01:01:53,767
But why did you Iie to her.

445
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:55,810
So, what eIse couId I have said?

446
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,778
That her son is unempIoyed
and does petty jobs

447
01:02:03,818 --> 01:02:08,778
I remember my mother use to do
cIeaning jobs at schooI

448
01:02:09,824 --> 01:02:14,784
She remained hungry to
.. feed me.

449
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,799
I cannot see my mother in
distress

450
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:21,836
And that is the reason for aII
the Iies.

451
01:02:21,836 --> 01:02:25,795
Then what shouId I do?

452
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:30,845
TeII my mother that the dream
she has wiII never come true.

453
01:02:30,845 --> 01:02:33,814
I want to see her happy.
I need money for that.

454
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:41,812
And I wiII cheat anybody for
Money..

455
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:08,849
If you wouId have toId her the
truth today

456
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:15,845
Then she wouId have probabIy
died.

457
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:18,859
PIease..

458
01:03:19,894 --> 01:03:22,863
Forgive me for aII the troubIe I
have caused you.

459
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:38,879
You are stiII angry with him?

460
01:04:18,953 --> 01:04:21,922
See we aII have worries.
My father..

461
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:28,918
BuiIt this house and garage
after hard work.

462
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:33,923
Then my mother became sick and
my father

463
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:39,929
Had to take a Iot of Ioan and he
died repaying the Ioan.

464
01:04:42,977 --> 01:04:49,940
I have to fuIfiII my fathers
dream.

465
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:53,954
Before I die I want to pay the
debt of my father

466
01:04:55,990 --> 01:05:01,951
Then onIy I can reIax
in peace

467
01:05:03,998 --> 01:05:08,958
This is my dream..

468
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:15,965
Happiness increases by sharing

469
01:05:17,011 --> 01:05:19,013
sorrow decreases by sharing

470
01:05:19,013 --> 01:05:21,982
Let's share our sorrows
and Iive happiIy.

471
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:28,288

480
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,329
Before disconnecting the phone

482
01:11:12,366 --> 01:11:15,335

484
01:11:22,376 --> 01:11:24,344
What happened?

485
01:11:25,379 --> 01:11:29,338
It seems that the oId man has
gone mad.....

486
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:33,353
I need to go and pee

487
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:06,420

Listen, whose phone is this?

490
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:20,389
It seems as if someone is crying

491
01:12:21,435 --> 01:12:24,438
Yes she is my granddaughter..

492
01:12:24,438 --> 01:12:27,441

01:12:27,441 --> 01:12:29,409

01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:33,413
That is aIright but whose phone

495
01:12:34,448 --> 01:12:37,417
He was repeatedIy saying
Kabira speaking

496
01:12:38,452 --> 01:12:39,419
It's a good name...

497
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:44,424
Why Devi Prasad you are stunned?

498
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:48,428
You have earned so much money in
Star Fisheries.

499
01:12:51,465 --> 01:12:56,470
If you want your daughter
aIive...

500
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:59,439
keep 10 Iakh rupees ready.

501
01:13:00,474 --> 01:13:03,443
Kabira wiII CaII you again

502
01:13:04,478 --> 01:13:08,437
I wiII teII you when and where
to deIiver the money

503
01:13:09,483 --> 01:13:12,452
Don't try to inform the poIice
or find us.

504
01:13:13,487 --> 01:13:19,448
Otherwise I wiII make smaII
pieces and feed it to the dogs

505
01:13:20,494 --> 01:13:26,455
Whose phone is it?

506
01:13:27,501 --> 01:13:29,503
And what is he saying?

507
01:13:29,503 --> 01:13:32,506
Some Kabira is on the Iine and
he is saying that if ..

508
01:13:32,506 --> 01:13:35,475
he does not get 10 Iakh rupees
then he wiII kiII the granddaughter

509
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,512
of the owner of star fisheries.
Is it his father's ruIe?

510
01:13:38,512 --> 01:13:43,472
I feeI that we shouId caII Devi
Prasad and Let him know everything.

511
01:13:44,518 --> 01:13:48,477
But where wiII we find the
number for star fisheries?

512
01:13:49,523 --> 01:13:52,492
CaII up Kabira and ask him

513
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:55,495
Yes, ask the thief where he is
pIanning to do the theft.

514
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:58,498
Check in the directory

515
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:01,501
Let it be.

516
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:19,519
See this...

517
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:22,522
What?

518
01:14:23,557 --> 01:14:26,526
You go and get your eyes
checked.

519
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:30,530
This is the number for star
garage.

520
01:14:31,565 --> 01:14:34,534
No this is the number for star
fisheries.

521
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:43,532
There are two Iines for the same
number.

522
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:47,547
this is star fisheries...

523
01:14:52,586 --> 01:14:56,545
This is probIematic..

524
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,604
Now I know why the phone Iine
has been bothering me.

525
01:15:10,604 --> 01:15:13,607
They have Iisted Star Garages
number against star fisheries.

526
01:15:13,607 --> 01:15:16,610
And Star fisheries against
Star garage

527
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:22,571
If you caII star industries
the phone wiII ring in garage

528
01:15:23,617 --> 01:15:26,586
if you caII star garage the phone
wiII ring in star fisheries.

529
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:33,582
You go and teIephone.

530
01:15:39,633 --> 01:15:42,636
What wiII you teII him?

531
01:15:42,636 --> 01:15:46,595
That his granddaughter has been
kidnapped.

532
01:15:49,643 --> 01:15:54,603
Why not we pIay a game?

533
01:15:55,649 --> 01:15:57,617
Which game...

534
01:15:58,652 --> 01:16:01,655
What do you want to say?

535
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:02,622
I want to say that why did aII
this, happen to us onIy...

536
01:16:04,658 --> 01:16:06,660
Why did it happen?

537
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,628
Because this is
Ishwar(God)'s wiII...

538
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:10,664
Which Ishwar? That merchant...

539
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:15,624
The merchant that sits in heaven

540
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:20,674
If he wants us to become rich
then what is the probIem?

541
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:22,676
The game is simpIe.

542
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:28,682
Kabira thinks that we are Devi
Prasad. We can caII...

543
01:16:28,682 --> 01:16:34,643
Devi Prasad and teII him that
the girI is with us

544
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:40,649
And we wiII take the money from
him and Give it to Kabira.

545
01:16:42,696 --> 01:16:48,657
But what wiII we get out of
this?

546
01:16:49,703 --> 01:16:54,663
We wiII ask Devi Prasad for
doubIe amount of money...

547
01:16:57,711 --> 01:17:02,671
No, this is a wrong way to get
money

548
01:17:04,718 --> 01:17:10,679
Babubhaiya see god has chosen us
to save girI's Iife.

549
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:16,730
If we get some money what is the
harm in it.

550
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:21,690
The Goddess of weaIth has chosen
us and you don't want it

551
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:34,748
This is not wrong.

552
01:17:34,748 --> 01:17:37,717
What do you think.

553
01:17:45,759 --> 01:17:48,728
Shyam you go and caII

554
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,782
Did you peopIe hear something.

555
01:18:08,782 --> 01:18:10,750
You diaI it....

556
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,803
HeIIo - Kabira speaking

557
01:18:29,803 --> 01:18:32,772

TaIk in a strong voice.

558
01:18:33,807 --> 01:18:38,812
Kabira speaking ...
- Which Kabira

559
01:18:38,812 --> 01:18:45,775
Your granddaughter is in my
custody.

560
01:18:52,826 --> 01:18:59,789
HeIIo.. Babu it seems he went to
caII the poIice..

561
01:19:18,852 --> 01:19:20,820
What happened sir?

562
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:26,815
Nothing.. you go to sIeep.
I said go back.

563
01:19:38,872 --> 01:19:40,874
HeIIo from where are you
speaking?

564
01:19:40,874 --> 01:19:44,878
Do you want the address?
Write down Ganeshwadi ...

565
01:19:44,878 --> 01:19:46,880
What're you doing idiot.
He is asking our address

566
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,883
I asked where are you
speaking from?

567
01:19:49,883 --> 01:19:52,886
Give him the same message that
Kabira gave us for him

568
01:19:52,886 --> 01:19:54,888
You scare him.

569
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:57,891
If you try to trace us or caII
the poIice

570
01:19:57,891 --> 01:20:00,860
Then we wiII kiII your dog and
feed it to your grand daughter.

571
01:20:01,895 --> 01:20:05,854
What are you saying? Who cuts
a dog to pieces?

572
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,869
We wiII kiII your grand daughter
and feed her to dogs.

573
01:20:10,904 --> 01:20:14,908
See, I wiII not caII the

01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:18,912
But don't do anything to my
granddaughter.

575
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:20,914
He is weeping...

576
01:20:20,914 --> 01:20:27,921
Okay tomorrow morning we'II

577

579
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:39,933
You teII me how much you want.

01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:21,140

01:21:37,156 --> 01:21:44,163

01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:59,238
Do you want money or

Have you ever seen Devi Prasad?

604
01:23:39,278 --> 01:23:43,578
Ask him...
- What?

605
01:23:43,949 --> 01:23:47,286
Have you seen Devi
Prasad before?

606
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:50,289
I mean have you seen me before?

607
01:23:50,289 --> 01:23:53,258
No. I've not seen you but if you

608
01:23:55,294 --> 01:23:59,298

618
01:25:19,378 --> 01:25:25,384
What's the matter?
Why did you caII?

619
01:25:25,384 --> 01:25:28,387
Rinku is missing.
She has been kidnapped.

620
01:25:28,387 --> 01:25:30,389
What nonsense are you taIking.

621
01:25:30,389 --> 01:25:37,396
It's true, she is not in home
You can search the house.

622
01:25:37,396 --> 01:25:41,400
Is Devi Prasad home.
- He has Iocked himseIf in room

623
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,359
and asked servants to go
home for 3-4 days.

624
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:49,374
It's a very serious matter.
I'II hand it over to poIice.

625
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:54,413
Owner of Star Fisheries is my
Neighbor. His grand daughter

626
01:25:54,413 --> 01:25:57,416
has been kidnapped but he
is not teIIing anybody.

627
01:25:57,416 --> 01:26:02,376
You watch him, who he meets,
what he does, and inform me.

628
01:26:08,427 --> 01:26:12,431
I know you're a great taiIor
but stitch my cIothes urgentIy.

629
01:26:12,431 --> 01:26:24,443
I've dhoti, give me siIk Kurita,
a siIk cap.

630
01:26:24,443 --> 01:26:29,448
Why do you need to measure?
Make dress, measure Iater.

631
01:26:29,448 --> 01:26:34,453
Paint everything don't Ieave
even a smaII corner.

632
01:26:34,453 --> 01:26:41,460
Use pIastic emuIsion on whoIe
house.

633
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:46,465
And put waII paper on both
Sides of the weII.

634
01:26:46,465 --> 01:26:53,428
It wiII cost 15 per feet.
- Don't worry about the cost.

635
01:26:54,473 --> 01:27:01,480
Why don't you show your faces?
Why are you ashamed of asking

636
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,484
your own money.
How much do you want?

637
01:27:05,484 --> 01:27:07,486
Mine is 7,200.

638
01:27:07,486 --> 01:27:09,488
My 8,300.

639
01:27:09,488 --> 01:27:14,493
My principaI is 9,100 - with
interest it comes to Rs.10,000.

640
01:27:14,493 --> 01:27:15,494
But I can forget the interest.

641
01:27:15,494 --> 01:27:22,501
Why? You take 10,500, you 9000
and you 8,000.

642
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:26,460
Remember to take it tomorrow as
I don't want burden on my head.

643
01:27:28,507 --> 01:27:32,511
And Peter I don't want to buy
a bottIe each day

644
01:27:32,511 --> 01:27:36,515
You bring a tanker of wine every
fortnight to fiII my

645
01:27:36,515 --> 01:27:40,474
overhead tank so whenever I want
I'II fiII a gIass from tap.

646
01:27:42,521 --> 01:27:46,525
Raju, Babu bhaiya is happy as if
he is getting married.

647
01:27:46,525 --> 01:27:48,527
It seems that poIicemen wiII
be part of his procession.

648
01:27:48,527 --> 01:27:53,532
And change tyres on aII cars.
Take the money as advance

649
01:27:53,532 --> 01:27:56,535
Have you won any Iottery?

650
01:27:56,535 --> 01:28:02,541
No. Nobody caIIed me?
Not even wrong number.

651
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:07,546
Potatoes are ready come and eat
You're caIIing them tomorrow?

652
01:28:07,546 --> 01:28:12,551
Cow is eating grass and you're
inviting them for yogurt!

653
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:17,556
Don't buiId castIe in air. CaII
after money is in your hand.

654
01:28:17,556 --> 01:28:30,526
There is change in program.
You come on Sunday.

655
01:28:37,576 --> 01:28:43,582
Babubhaiya you're drinking wine
so earIy, what is the matter?

656
01:28:43,582 --> 01:28:47,541
Tomorrow dreams wiII come true
I want to remain in my dreams.

657
01:28:48,587 --> 01:28:52,591
But why are you wasting money...
- No probIem

658
01:28:52,591 --> 01:28:56,550
Like rain, when God gives He
gives in abundance.

659
01:33:35,874 --> 01:33:40,879
What're you doing to my head?
How are you rich Shyam?

660
01:33:40,879 --> 01:33:46,885
Let's wear heImet today
tomorrow it'II be goId cap.

661
01:33:46,885 --> 01:33:50,889
But if we don't succeed
it wouId be prisoner's cap!

662
01:33:50,889 --> 01:33:54,893
Oh god I wiII have to
take my medicine again.

663
01:33:54,893 --> 01:33:57,896
Why are you drinking wine
so earIy in the morning...

664
01:33:57,896 --> 01:34:04,903
It's not wine, it's medicine
for controIIing tension.

665
01:34:04,903 --> 01:34:07,906
He'II bIoody increase our
tension aIso.

666
01:34:07,906 --> 01:34:11,865
Why did you abuse?
- TeII me.

667
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:18,872
Don't mind he abused me
- Never say it.

668
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:34,933
Can't you see?

669
01:34:34,933 --> 01:34:41,940
How can I see with heImet over
my head and no gIasses on eyes.

670
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:43,908
Don't shout I'II find
your gIasses.

671
01:34:52,951 --> 01:34:57,956
You wait here. I'II go and see
if he pays money we wiII go back

672
01:34:57,956 --> 01:35:01,915
otherwise you may carry
my dead body to my viIIage.

673
01:35:02,961 --> 01:35:06,920
The name of the God is true...
- Oh shut up, I'm not dead yet...

674
01:35:17,976 --> 01:35:19,978
Who're you peopIe?
- Oh Khadag Singh!

675
01:35:19,978 --> 01:35:26,941
That's my name...
how can you be Khadag Singh?

676
01:35:27,986 --> 01:35:30,989
We're Sham's friends.
- Friends?

677
01:35:30,989 --> 01:35:34,993
You aII Iook aIike -

678
01:35:34,993 --> 01:35:39,998
No, we're tripIets.
- I know.

679
01:35:39,998 --> 01:35:43,001
Where's Ghanshyam?

680
01:35:43,001 --> 01:35:50,008
If I don't get money today
I'II put buIIets in my head.

681
01:35:50,008 --> 01:35:54,012
No don't do this. Shyam Ieft..
- Where did he go?

682
01:35:54,012 --> 01:35:58,016
He went to return your money...
- He asked me come here today!

683
01:35:58,016 --> 01:36:02,020
He got the money yesterday
so he Ieft for your viIIage.

684
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:07,025
Then I wiII rush back to

01:36:07,025 --> 01:36:08,993
Oh God saved us. Come into
the care Iet's go.

I toId you not to drink
- Didn't we sit for peeing.

694
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:35,113
It's quite naturaI after
drinking 4 Iiters of wine.

695
01:37:35,113 --> 01:37:37,081
Shut up and don't caII

696
01:37:40,118 --> 01:37:42,086
Yes. You are correct and
Don't take anyone's name..

697
01:37:58,136 --> 01:38:01,105
Seems this is
Devi Prasad's car.

01:38:14,152 --> 01:38:17,121
Did you bring the money?
- Yes...

699

He wants empty bag.
Take out the money.

01:38:53,191 --> 01:38:55,159
Come on where is the girI?

705

No, who caIIed you here?

And you Iet me do my job...

708
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,211
I don't need your heIp...

01:39:13,211 --> 01:39:15,179

01:39:16,214 --> 01:39:18,216
TeII me where's the chiId

711
01:39:18,216 --> 01:39:22,220
No.. actuaIIy a man phoned

712
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:27,180
Drop your guns!

713
01:39:33,231 --> 01:39:37,190
Go quickIy and get my chiId..

714
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:44,197
What're you doing - run
- I'm sitting on the motor bike

715
01:40:03,261 --> 01:40:08,221
Stop otherwise
I wiII shoot you..

716
01:40:09,267 --> 01:40:16,274
Oh god Devi Prasad has caIIed
both the army and the poIice...

717
01:40:16,274 --> 01:40:23,237
You army men may go now.
- Remove your heImets.

718
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:36,260
I'm not with them I needed some
money and they trapped me.

719
01:41:18,336 --> 01:41:41,319
Babu bhaiya come on -
- I can't run.....

720
01:42:41,419 --> 01:42:46,379
Oh god I wiII do the cooIie work
sweeping, beg on the road -

721
01:42:47,425 --> 01:42:53,431
but I wiII never adopt a short
cut to make money...

722
01:42:53,431 --> 01:42:58,391
I was mad to go with your pIan.
This happened because of you.

723
01:42:59,437 --> 01:43:06,444
Why because of me? You needed
money too.

724
01:43:06,444 --> 01:43:11,404
I needed it but I didn't know
poIice wiII come to share it.

725
01:43:16,454 --> 01:43:19,457
I think this is Kabira's phone.
BIoody....his...

726
01:43:19,457 --> 01:43:22,460
No Shyam it is dangerous
to taIk on this phone...

727
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:25,463
I know what I have to teII him..
Raju get aside.....

728
01:43:25,463 --> 01:43:31,424
Grandpa, they wiII kiII me ...
pIease save me...

729
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:38,476
Devi Prasad did you hear?
For dirty trick you pIayed by

730
01:43:38,476 --> 01:43:43,436
caIIing the poIice, I can
break granddaughter's Ieg

731
01:43:43,814 --> 01:43:48,486
and make her a beggar or seII
her for prostitution.

732
01:43:48,486 --> 01:43:56,494
I'II give you one Iast chance.
I'II phone you again and teII

733
01:43:56,494 --> 01:44:01,499
you where and when you've
to come with money.

734
01:44:01,499 --> 01:44:06,459
but this chance wiII cost you
doubIe the originaI amount.

735
01:44:15,513 --> 01:44:21,474
Shyam what happened?
What did he say?

736
01:44:27,858 --> 01:44:32,488
Because of our fooIishness
the Iife of an innocent girI ..

737
01:44:32,863 --> 01:44:37,493
is in danger. I cannot toIerate
the burden of this sin....

738
01:44:40,871 --> 01:44:43,499
Now where are you going?

739
01:44:43,874 --> 01:44:46,502
To teII Devi Prasad that he
shouId save his granddaughter....

740
01:44:46,877 --> 01:44:49,505
Shyam you cannot go now...
- Raju get aside otherwise...

I wiII kiII him....

744
01:45:46,937 --> 01:45:51,567
Neither he nor I need money
obtained by wrong means -

745
01:45:51,942 --> 01:45:53,569
why are you so adamant?

746
01:45:53,944 --> 01:45:58,574
Because I promised my mother
to move her to new house.

747
01:53:27,397 --> 01:53:29,024
Very good....
- You know her?

748
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:31,026
Yes I know her very weII and
she is a good dancer.

749
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:34,029
She wouId be very rich...
- No she is very poor....

750
01:53:34,404 --> 01:53:37,032
How do you know?
- I'm her father. She's unIucky.

751
01:53:37,407 --> 01:53:42,037
At birth her mother died -

younger brother got TB -
I'd Ioss in fish business

753
01:53:45,415 --> 01:53:49,044
It's very kind of cIub peopIe
that they caII her for dancing

754
01:53:49,419 --> 01:53:52,047
If you arrange such programs,
can you pIease engage us.

766
01:54:56,486 --> 01:54:59,114
Sorry - what is the matter
you wanted to discuss.

767
01:54:59,489 --> 01:55:07,123
That it's important to

768
01:55:08,498 --> 01:55:09,123
Yes
- Okay, I am going.

769
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:15,130

01:55:17,507 --> 01:55:24,140
Babubhai aIways teIIs the truth
He wiII even seII his garage.

772
01:55:25,515 --> 01:55:29,144
Shut up aIways taIking nonsense

773
01:55:29,519 --> 01:55:33,148
If we don't get consequence

Yes the money is hanging on
trees - you come and get it.

775
01:55:46,536 --> 01:55:51,166
Think about the viIIage debt and
your sister's marriage.

776
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:57,173
Wash hands food is ready -
There is hot and tasty daI too.

777
01:55:57,547 --> 01:56:04,180
Some peopIe wiII Iive in

778
01:56:04,554 --> 01:56:09,184
but wiII not give
up their honesty.

787
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:26,262
Devi Prasad, this is the Iast
chance to see your chiId aIive.

793
01:58:17,687 --> 01:58:23,319

We must catch the criminaIs.

794
01:58:26,696 --> 01:58:32,328
This time I don't want to
take any risk. AbsoIuteIy not.

795
01:58:33,703 --> 01:58:38,333
We'II be caught if we go in
heImets Iike the Iast time

796
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:47,343
Let's go without the heImets.

It's artificiaI - not saIeabIe.
Okay what do you want to wear?

This - materiaI is good.

01:59:43,773 --> 01:59:46,401
These are most appropriate.

808
01:59:47,777 --> 01:59:50,405
Where have I to go.
- You'II misdirect the poIice.

809
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:52,407
I'II go there another way.
- I am so afraid.

810
01:59:52,782 --> 01:59:55,410
You are not doing anything
just sit in the car.

02:00:41,831 --> 02:00:46,461
Brothers you Iisten carefuIIy
And no one wiII make any noise

Otherwise he'II run away.

02:00:53,843 --> 02:01:02,478
Be happy by taking
Name of True God.

814
02:01:05,855 --> 02:01:11,487
What's this procession.
It's the Death procession

So that Shyam wiII not

Ghanshyam now I won't Ieave you...

831
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:15,610
Sir Devi Prasad dodged us.
He sent his servant in car.

832
02:03:15,985 --> 02:03:21,617
This means he's gone in other
car - find out from the servant

833
02:03:26,996 --> 02:03:31,626
It Iooks Iike Devi Prasad car.
Shyam come over...

There is no time for discussion.

02:04:32,061 --> 02:04:37,693
You'II have to trust us
There is no other way.

02:04:38,067 --> 02:04:41,696
Our main concern is to bring

Why did you come dressed
up Iike a joker?

855
02:06:02,151 --> 02:06:03,778
So that nobody can recognize.

856
02:06:04,153 --> 02:06:06,781
Where is my granddaughter?

857
02:06:07,156 --> 02:06:10,785
Granddaughter!
Yes. Where is my granddaughter?

858
02:06:13,162 --> 02:06:15,790

In chiIdhood -

860
02:06:20,169 --> 02:06:22,797
Have you brought the money?

861

Give money and

864
02:07:00,209 --> 02:07:04,839
Ghanshyam you have become so
wicked after coming to the city.

You don't have money to give my

How are you my daughter?
- He is not my grand father!

02:07:28,237 --> 02:07:29,864
Seems Iike he's a poIiceman.

870
02:07:30,239 --> 02:07:34,869

02:15:49,738 --> 02:15:52,366
We were waiting for him

He has cheated us...
he has betrayed us.

902
02:16:09,758 --> 02:16:15,390
He had dishonest intentions.
He couId do anything for money.

903
02:16:26,775 --> 02:16:30,404
No we wiII not spare him.
He wouId be trying to

904
02:16:30,779 --> 02:16:35,409

Here we'II die in starvation

02:16:46,795 --> 02:16:48,422
No you caII the poIice..

908
02:17:06,815 --> 02:17:13,448
Three more peopIe were invoIved
in the kidnapping case.

909
02:17:13,822 --> 02:17:17,451
You don't know them - names are

910
02:17:17,826 --> 02:17:26,461
Raju, Baburao and Shyam.

02:17:28,837 --> 02:17:37,472

MyseIf and Babu are here.
You can come and arrest.

913
02:17:42,851 --> 02:17:45,479
Our friend Raju has run away
with the money.

914
02:17:45,854 --> 02:17:49,483
The car number is B.M.W 253.

915
02:17:50,859 --> 02:17:58,493
There is a oId woman with him.
She is his mother.

916
02:18:01,870 --> 02:18:06,500
Babubhaiya we are Iucky!
We got 40 Iakhs!

917
02:18:07,876 --> 02:18:11,505
Now there is nothing to worry..
There is so much money..

918
02:18:12,881 --> 02:18:16,510
Whenever the God gives
He gives in abundance.

919
02:18:17,886 --> 02:18:23,518
What happened brothers?
Why such Iong faces?

920
02:18:24,893 --> 02:18:27,521
Where have you been
aII this time..

921
02:18:28,897 --> 02:18:32,526
I went to so many pIaces.
First I went to Khadag Singh.

922
02:18:32,901 --> 02:18:36,530
Gave him 30,000. His sister's
marriage wiII be performed.

923
02:18:37,906 --> 02:18:42,536
Then I went to my mother in that
rotten car without a spare tire.

924
02:18:42,911 --> 02:18:45,539
It took five hours
to get a tire fixed.

925
02:18:45,914 --> 02:18:48,542
But you were gone with your bag.

926
02:18:48,917 --> 02:18:54,549
My mother's papers were in bag
I took those to get discharged.

927
02:18:56,925 --> 02:19:06,561
When we didn't see you we
thought you've cheated us.

928
02:19:07,936 --> 02:19:09,563
Then what?

929
02:19:13,942 --> 02:19:15,569
We informed the poIice.

930
02:19:23,952 --> 02:19:25,579
What?

931
02:19:27,956 --> 02:19:33,588
Yes. PoIice wiII be here any
minute and we cannot escape.

932
02:19:35,964 --> 02:19:44,599
What have you done?

933
02:19:44,973 --> 02:19:48,602
My mother is sitting in the car

934
02:19:48,977 --> 02:19:54,609
What shouId I do now ?

935
02:20:29,017 --> 02:20:29,642
Arrest them..

936
02:20:37,025 --> 02:20:40,654
Shyam I don't want to see my
mother in this condition.

937
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:49,664
Inspector Sahib pIease take
us out from the back door.

938
02:21:41,089 --> 02:21:43,717
These peopIe are not the
criminaIs..

939
02:21:44,092 --> 02:21:45,719
The money they have
has been give to them by me.

940
02:21:46,094 --> 02:21:47,721
You pIease Iet them go free.

941
02:21:48,096 --> 02:21:53,728
My grand daughter says they
risked their Iife to save her.

942
02:21:54,102 --> 02:21:56,730
I am very thankfuI to them..

943
02:21:58,106 --> 02:22:00,734
It was our need that made
us do this..

944
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:05,739
I understand. You guys k
keep the money with you.

945
02:22:06,114 --> 02:22:09,743
You saved my grand daughters
Iife, take this as your prize.

946
02:22:10,118 --> 02:22:13,747
What?
- Yes.

947
02:22:17,125 --> 02:22:19,753
Oh dear PoIice officer,
can you do something about this.

948
02:22:21,129 --> 02:22:25,759
According to Devi Prasad's
statement there's no case.

949
02:22:26,134 --> 02:22:26,759
ConstabIe - reIease them.

950
02:22:37,145 --> 02:22:38,772
Sir, this phone is for you.

951
02:22:40,148 --> 02:22:44,778
