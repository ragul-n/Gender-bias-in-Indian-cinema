1
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,034
This story is based on faith.

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:23,375
Faith which makes
the impossible happen.

3
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:27,542
Faith that renders
the impossible possible.

4
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:34,018
This is one such story
bound by the chords of faith.

5
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,330
Here is Rs.10... Hey!
Where are you going?

6
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:19,396
Give me the extortion money
or I'll have you sacked!

7
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:21,261
Keep some money or you
will lose your job.

8
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:28,942
Put it in there.

9
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:47,460
Karan Singh and Arjun Singh,
put my extortion money.

10
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:52,635
- Don't cut our money today.
- What is so special today?

11
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,898
- That is a secret.
- What secret?

12
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,468
- We'll tell you later.
- Don't cut Rs.2.

13
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,104
Keep the entire
day's wage tomorrow.

14
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:08,675
Is that so? I trust you
because you are Durga's sons.

15
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,180
But don't go back on
your word tomorrow.

16
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:15,154
Rs.20 for me tomorrow!

17
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,256
Father, it is Sunday tomorrow.
It is a holiday.

18
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:20,187
Good-bye!

19
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,262
Have you sprung from
the skies, buddy?

20
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:25,961
Never mind that. Just tell me
how much the bangles are worth.

21
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,600
Why must you buy bangles?

22
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,965
Don't bother about that. Just tell
us how much the bangles cost.

23
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,234
- Show me that.
- No. This green one.

24
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,274
- These red bangles.
- These golden ones.

25
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,315
- These colorful ones.
- They're indeed beautiful.

26
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,872
- I win, right Mom?
- No! I've won!

27
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:42,673
You win or lose in
a contest, my sons.

28
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:46,315
And it's only
enemies who compete.

29
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:49,309
- I touched your feet first.
- No! I did!

30
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:51,713
- I did...!
- Stop it.

31
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,315
You're still racing
against each other!

32
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,524
Neither are you ahead...
nor are you trailing.

33
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,258
But my sons are ahead
of everyone else!

34
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,599
- We've got something for you.
- What is it?

35
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,869
- First shut your eyes.
- What for?

36
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:11,400
- Close your eyes! Go on!
- All right.

37
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:16,006
Open your eyes now.

38
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:22,712
You will wear bangles now,
like other women in the village.

39
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,611
We just can't bear to see
your hands so bare.

40
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:28,358
Extend your hand, mom.

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,184
Come on, mom.

42
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:34,959
No! I can't wear those bangles.

43
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,502
Why not?

44
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:47,000
I can't wear bangles
at my age, silly boys.

45
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:48,709
I understand, mom!

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,776
She'll wear the bangles only
when Dad returns from the city.

47
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,414
- That's true, isn't it?
- It's so many years already.

48
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,676
He would've returned,
had he wished to.

49
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:59,479
- He has forgotten us!
- There's no word from him at all.

50
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,688
And you're always waiting for him!

51
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:05,222
Let's go and return
the bangles. Come on.

52
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:06,655
No... wait!

53
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:12,897
Give me those bangles...
give them to me.

54
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,303
I will give these
bangles to your wives.

55
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:26,476
- But they were meant to...
- Go and bathe quickly.

56
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,867
- Greetings, madam.
- The accountant? You?

57
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:51,707
I've managed to reach here
with great difficulty.

58
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,068
Had someone seen me come here,
my life would be in danger.

59
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,815
But what brings you here
so late in the night?

60
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,244
The elder Thakur has
summoned you to the mansion.

61
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:03,612
Which mansion?

62
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:10,249
The one that shut the doors
on our good-fortune?

63
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:15,760
The mansion, whose wounds are
still raw in the heart?

64
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:23,473
Go away. I will never step
inside that mansion.

65
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,833
Fulfilling a dying
man's last desire...

66
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,044
...is considered to be
the greatest of noble deeds.

67
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:32,905
What?... Is the landlord...?

68
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:36,880
Yes. The landlord is
breathing his last.

69
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:39,382
His last wish is to see you.

70
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:45,624
But so long as the cursed Durjan
Singh casts his shadow there...

71
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,760
How can I go there?

72
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,363
Tomorrow's the festival
of Goddess Kali.

73
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,726
Durjan, with his brothers-in-law,
Nahar and Shamsher Singh...

74
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:55,369
...will be at the temple with
their families.

75
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:57,741
I will wait for you
outside the mansion.

76
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,670
- Please be there.
- Very well.

77
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:11,445
- Who was that man?
- And who's the old landlord?

78
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:20,221
I have kept a secret
from you for many years.

79
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:27,202
How was I to know that time
would one day stoke its fires?

80
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,102
It's the story of my life...

81
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:36,875
...which I have always
kept a secret from you.

82
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:42,317
But I will have to tell
you the truth today.

83
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:46,589
I will tell you everything.

84
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:52,486
The old landlord is
your grandfather.

85
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:57,026
- What?!
- Our grandfather? The landlord?!

86
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,264
Yes. I am his daughter-in-law.

87
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,939
I was a poor woman.
And your father married me.

88
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:09,878
But the landlord was instigated
by Durjan Singh, his nephew...

89
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:13,274
...and he refused to accept
me as his daughter-in-law.

90
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,076
I was driven out of the mansion.

91
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:22,853
Your father found a job in
a school in the village.

92
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:27,427
We were happy in our own world,
despite our poverty.

93
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:34,795
And your arrival brought more
joy and happiness in our lives.

94
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:40,739
But our happiness
soon turned to grief.

95
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:45,445
Durjan Singh dreamt of
inheriting the family riches.

96
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:49,342
And one night, out of
sheer treachery...

97
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:54,914
Durjan Singh killed your father!

98
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:59,394
What?! Was father...

99
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,293
You mean you have always...?

100
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Yes. To keep this tale
a secret, I concocted a story.

101
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:19,642
I didn't want you to feel orphaned.

102
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:29,953
How was I to know that someday my
past would come knocking on my door?

103
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:35,024
That I'd have to go to the
mansion which I have always loathed!

104
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:40,531
No. We will not go to the mansion
that has snatched our father!

105
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,973
Yes. We won't as much as
step in the place...

106
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,970
...that has plunged you
in poverty and despair.

107
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:53,416
I know how the fires
of hatred are stoked...

108
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,015
...when one is reminded of the
humiliation he has undergone.

109
00:14:57,588 --> 00:15:02,582
But I have always imparted to you
lessons in love and compassion.

110
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:04,292
Not hatred.

111
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:09,129
Hatred can only make man
and society, drift apart.

112
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,268
Hatred is the devil's shadow, my sons.

113
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,538
It's the devil's shadow!

114
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:52,400
Glory to Goddess Kali!

115
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,279
Welcome, madam...

116
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:35,577
The landlord has been speaking
about you since morning.

117
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,912
He's longing to see
Karan and Arjun.

118
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:40,521
Please come in.

119
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,918
Welcome, daughter-in-law.

120
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,921
Please don't touch me...
I am a sinner!

121
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:52,769
No, father. That which happened
was part of our destiny.

122
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:58,440
No. It was my arrogance that
had eclipsed your destiny.

123
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:02,572
I thrust my own blood in
the fires of misfortune.

124
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,804
I should be severely punished.

125
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:09,744
A terrible death that no sinner
would have suffered so far!

126
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,715
Don't say that.

127
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:17,917
The ointment of time heals
every wound inflicted by life.

128
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:22,492
Before I die, just once...

129
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,534
Won't you give me
the right to hug them?

130
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,997
Right? Our lives are for you.

131
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,203
Karan and Arjun are your children.

132
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:35,703
Go my children.

133
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:41,912
My children!

134
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,284
I'm truly unfortunate.

135
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:50,286
I couldn't play with you.

136
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:59,502
I'm returning the right I had
snatched away from you.

137
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:04,100
Now you are the
mistress of this mansion.

138
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:09,442
And your sons are its' heirs.

139
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:11,678
Take this.

140
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,044
The body becomes useless in old age.

141
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,824
But you have ruined your life!

142
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:27,723
You poisoned my life!
Go away from here!

143
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,656
I didn't come to this
mansion to go away!

144
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:33,834
Every brick of this house is mine!

145
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,737
I served you all your life!

146
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:42,340
You tried to kill me every moment!

147
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:44,579
But I didn't die.

148
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:49,345
Because I had a debt to pay,
to give these kids their rights!

149
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:53,281
I won't give these beggars one penny!

150
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:58,990
Instead I'll give you and
this family of yours, death!

151
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,464
No! I bind you by oath.

152
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,024
We don't want anything!

153
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,664
You may take everything.
We want nothing at all!

154
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,440
What are you saying?

155
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:22,051
You called me your daughter-in-law
and held my sons close to your heart.

156
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,953
We have got all the
wealth in the world.

157
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,945
We want nothing else.

158
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:29,758
Come on children.

159
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:41,302
Brother-in-law, you left
these two snakes alive?

160
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,702
Snakes can raise their fangs anytime.

161
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:49,978
They are the young ones
of a snake not snakes.

162
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,739
They haven't yet cut
their poison fangs.

163
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:55,741
Their father was the snake.

164
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,814
The sons will die at my hands
just as their father did!

165
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:04,489
What? You killed my son?

166
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:08,353
Yes. I did.

167
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:13,130
And his children too
will die at my hands.

168
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:16,902
- This can't happen!
- This will happen!

169
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:23,168
Because your entire family
is doomed to die at my hands!

170
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,971
Look at this old man!

171
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:31,782
You will see the dark shadow
of your death in my palm!

172
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,173
Run!

173
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:57,877
Run children!

174
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:51,890
Leave my sons!

175
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:54,635
- Leave my Karan and Arjun!
- Leave these little snakes?

176
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:57,965
The game has just begun, old lady.

177
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:01,037
It will be great fun!

178
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,209
Look there, old lady!

179
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,315
Look there!

180
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,763
Stop it!

181
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:35,375
You bite!

182
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,878
Mother!

183
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:49,587
Mother!

184
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,729
You hit my mother?

185
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,453
Let's run away!

186
00:23:26,963 --> 00:23:29,955
Run Arjun!

187
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,492
I'm telling you to run!

188
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:53,409
Mother! My sons cannot die!

189
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,720
This cannot happen!

190
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,422
You are also a mother.

191
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:09,224
A mother can't destroy
another mother's womb!

192
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:17,002
My sons are the boon
given to me at your step!

193
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,938
You can't take back a
gift you've given once!

194
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:25,107
You will have to return my sons!

195
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,517
Return my sons to me mother!

196
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,584
Return my sons to me mother!

197
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,591
Return my sons to me mother!

198
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:10,155
Push harder. Little more.

199
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,931
Ate his mother soon as he was born!

200
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,709
Now will you eat my liquor bottle?

201
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,841
I don't have money for my booze!
Where can I get cash for your milk?

202
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:07,606
Don't cry son.

203
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:11,414
Our son will grow into a big man.

204
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:14,052
Even God will feel proud of him.

205
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:17,424
All thanks to Pestonbhai.

206
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,757
I work in his Riding Club
and eke out a living.

207
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:24,531
It's the Lord who does everything.

208
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:28,530
Who knows maybe your son
will run my Riding Club tomorrow!

209
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:36,975
Brought booze?

210
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,942
I'm hungry. I've brought food.

211
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:44,612
Rascal! When small
you cried for milk!

212
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:47,215
And now for food!

213
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,588
- Get me some booze!
- No, I won't!

214
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:53,522
Arguing with your father!

215
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:57,299
- Let go of my hand!
- No! First leave the bag!

216
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,726
Little fellow but has
the strength of a horse!

217
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:05,331
- Won't leave me?
- Scoundrel!

218
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:12,576
What happened son?

219
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:15,213
He was stealing grams so I hit him.

220
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:18,053
Wow! What aim!

221
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:13,440
What happens to you suddenly?

222
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,067
Will you kill him?

223
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:18,572
Why are you hitting him?
He was fighting for you.

224
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:22,610
This boy called you a drunk.
Therefore, Ajay thrashed him.

225
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:25,077
Control your son.

226
00:29:25,455 --> 00:29:29,289
Those who do not have mothers
turn out to be like this.

227
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:32,693
Mother I will return!

228
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:36,597
I am with you son!

229
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:43,234
- I will return mother!
- There is no need to worry.

230
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:48,038
He is hallucinating.
It happens when the fever rises.

231
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:52,414
Mother! Mother!

232
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,755
Priest.

233
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:13,697
Did you hear? Did you?

234
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,968
My son has called out to me!

235
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:22,301
They will come.
My Karan and Arjun will return!

236
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:26,607
I've been listening for 20 years.

237
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:29,417
That Karan and Arjun will come.

238
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,482
But this world is such a place...

239
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:39,655
Once destroyed the people of
this world never ever return.

240
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,926
Wait and see.

241
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:45,726
My Karan and Arjun will return!

242
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:48,263
They will definitely return!

243
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:52,469
Karan and Arjun will return?

244
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:54,707
Mad old woman!

245
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:58,441
My father, Durjan Singh, has
given them such a terrible death...

246
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:02,817
...that even God will think.
10 times before sending them here!

247
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:04,153
Move aside!

248
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:43,849
Crazy old woman!

249
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:48,093
Looks like you still don't
believe your sons are dead.

250
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:54,364
Take this and garland
the photograph with it.

251
00:31:54,704 --> 00:32:00,267
Look at it everyday so that you
are convinced your sons are no more.

252
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:03,439
This is from me.

253
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:06,046
From my side.

254
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,865
Priest, my son is going abroad.

255
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:27,535
I've brought him here
for Mother's blessings.

256
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,336
So that he returns
successful in his mission.

257
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,773
After tormenting one mother...

258
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:38,476
You are begging another
mother for her blessings?

259
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:44,549
You'll have to beg my sons.

260
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:48,719
Beg them for your lives.
To let you live.

261
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:53,358
Remember, these 3 garlands...

262
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:58,162
...if I don't garland
your corpses with these...

263
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:00,958
I'm not worthy of my name, Durga!

264
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:08,469
Remember this Durjan.

265
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:12,113
My sons will return!

266
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:15,141
My Karan and Arjun will return!

267
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:18,783
Stupid woman!
How can the dead return?

268
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:23,217
They will tear the
earth apart and come!

269
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:26,259
They will rip open the skies to come!

270
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,476
That guy is finished!

271
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:45,006
Hit him!

272
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,698
You were great!

273
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:44,167
You've performed a miracle by
defeating the favorite Kalia! Look.

274
00:34:44,507 --> 00:34:46,099
A shower of cash!

275
00:34:46,442 --> 00:34:51,539
Here's your share. From today
you are the favorite here.

276
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,815
Eunuch! You'll marry me?

277
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:03,455
I'll scramble your brains!

278
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:06,018
Dad she's abusing us!

279
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,498
Get lost!

280
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:12,628
You won't ever find a groom like me!

281
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:18,905
You seem to live in this area.

282
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,937
Is she a girl or boy?

283
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,777
Whom are you asking?
I'll tell you what I am.

284
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:28,976
Run! Eunuch!

285
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:32,750
Saw that? He was the fifth specimen.

286
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:39,225
Before my Dad gives my hand
to somebody else...

287
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,754
Hold my hand.

288
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,670
He doesn't care about you but
you chase him like a fool.

289
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:53,007
What's special about him
that you only want him?

290
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:58,605
Dad he has what nobody else has.

291
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:01,747
He slapped me once in childhood.

292
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:04,677
On my cheek but it left
its' imprint on my heart.

293
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:10,619
But the day you get slapped,
you'll forget finding grooms for me!

294
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,290
No! It isn't anything...
It's medicine.

295
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:26,539
Liquor in a medicine bottle?

296
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:30,407
I slog hard to buy medicines.

297
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:33,111
And you have this poison?

298
00:36:34,116 --> 00:36:36,550
I want to save you
and you want to die?

299
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:39,411
There's still time. Change yourself!

300
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:51,291
Great! Simply superb!

301
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:28,402
Fantastic or elastic, any girl
who comes here makes him her teacher.

302
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:39,271
How did you learn such excellent
horse riding and marksmanship?

303
00:37:39,582 --> 00:37:41,049
I put my heart into it and learnt it.

304
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:43,485
If you put your heart
into it, you too will learn.

305
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:46,586
His heart too is in it.

306
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:52,220
That's what I'm watching.
Daily she comes half an hour early.

307
00:37:52,528 --> 00:37:57,431
What do I do? Since coming here,
I don't like being at home.

308
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,892
Like a kite is pulled by its' string...

309
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,894
I'm in the same boat.

310
00:38:02,938 --> 00:38:05,463
Maybe that has afflicted you.

311
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:08,138
- What?
- That.

312
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:15,814
But in just two meetings,
it has happened that Mogambo...

313
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,880
Who is Mogambo?

314
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,485
My horse.

315
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:30,060
Yes, I'm attracted to Mogambo
and somebody else too.

316
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,660
Somebody else? Who?

317
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,505
- Really?
- Yes.

318
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:41,207
- Swear.
- By me.

319
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:49,407
I can see it in the eyes
but I want to hear it too.

320
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:52,480
- With a kiss...
- With the catapult.

321
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,053
How did this catapult
enter a love scene?

322
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,686
People love hearts and you
fell in love with a catapult?

323
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:03,692
You may have my catapult
if not my heart.

324
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:07,298
- I don't know how to.
- You only know how to shoot arrows.

325
00:39:08,003 --> 00:39:09,163
I'll teach you.

326
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:13,504
Hold this with the right hand
and this with the left.

327
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,208
And pull it.

328
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:22,817
Now hold it tight.

329
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:26,778
Who is this fat hippo?

330
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:28,515
My body guard.

331
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:32,151
Papa has sent him with me.

332
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,262
If somebody troubles me, he LLs him.

333
00:39:35,898 --> 00:39:38,799
Yes, lame and mutilated. ********

334
00:39:39,935 --> 00:39:42,460
Let's see.

335
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,337
Hippo, where are you going?

336
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:54,773
- You! - Yes, me.
- Baby...! - Yes.

337
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,741
- What did you do?
- I kissed her.

338
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:00,218
Carefully.

339
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:22,975
Threw me!

340
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:28,072
Rascal!

341
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,610
A hippo on a horse?

342
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,317
Where's my gun?

343
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:50,970
Madam, looks like I'll have to
teach you something else

344
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:54,037
...in addition to horse riding
and marksmanship. - What's that?

345
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,503
One kisses on the lips not cheeks.

346
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:01,439
- Here.
- I'll learn that too.

347
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:10,418
Where is the ruffian?
I won't spare him!

348
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,984
What does he think of himself?
Was it a terrible fight?

349
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:19,062
The hearts liked each other.
And sliced the villain.

350
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:20,801
My ears were smoking!

351
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:23,397
- You too would be...
- What? - Smoking.

352
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:27,038
- From where?
- Mouth, ear, nose...

353
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:29,774
I'll roast you if
you say another word!

354
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,910
Always mouthing double meaning
dialogues like Dada Kondke!

355
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:35,245
Who was that ruffian son?

356
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:36,984
A flower and a thorn.
I threw it out!

357
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,854
Well done son! As long as
your hand is on the head...

358
00:41:43,158 --> 00:41:44,750
...of these hoodlums,
my Riding club will survive.

359
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:47,584
Who would look after the
stable if it wasn't for you?

360
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:51,159
I am indebted to you.

361
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:55,730
No uncle. I am indebted to you.

362
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:00,298
You supported me after
my parents expired.

363
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:02,004
Loved me like a son.

364
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:04,072
Educated me, gave me a job.

365
00:42:04,513 --> 00:42:09,041
Your Dad was my friend.
Whatever I did was for friendship.

366
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:13,214
Come on. It's time for your
horse riding students to come.

367
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:16,289
I was talking about him.

368
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:19,118
He alone can take on a hundred.

369
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:22,960
- If you meet him once...
- I'll meet him.

370
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,492
You've come back child?

371
00:42:28,237 --> 00:42:29,295
Place the mug high.

372
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:33,670
- A little higher.
- Come on. Here.

373
00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:38,805
- What childishness is this?
- Catapult.

374
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:41,048
I've been practicing but
I can't get my aim right.

375
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:48,718
You went to learn riding.
So where did this come from?

376
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:53,118
What one plans never happens
and what is not planned does.

377
00:42:53,562 --> 00:42:56,531
And what you never think of
happens some times.

378
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:58,990
I mean it was great!

379
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,761
Did you follow what she said?

380
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,529
Yes. I'm not so stupid.

381
00:43:17,085 --> 00:43:22,751
- Good day sir.
- Whenever I leave my mansion...

382
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:28,628
I think of one other world,
the world of our friendship.

383
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:36,066
This friendship is soon
going to turn into relation.

384
00:43:36,438 --> 00:43:39,930
Your son Suraj is going
to become my son-in-law.

385
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:43,869
Suraj and Sonia can be engaged
soon as he returns from London.

386
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:51,382
Saxena, enough of sweet talk.
Let's talk something bitter now.

387
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:55,846
So that the poison of bitterness
doesn't spread in our friendship.

388
00:43:56,325 --> 00:44:01,592
I have still have not got
the payment for my goods.

389
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:07,234
The party I have given the
goods to is delaying the payment.

390
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:10,932
Since he is dangerous, I want to...

391
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:15,438
When it comes to money,
I am very amoral.

392
00:44:15,811 --> 00:44:17,938
Let alone friends and foes.

393
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:21,146
I don't hesitate to
kill my own people.

394
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:28,851
My payment should reach within a week.

395
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,192
Why did you stop the car?

396
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:34,961
Look in front.

397
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:38,925
Move aside.

398
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:50,273
Looking at her eyes I feel...

399
00:44:50,612 --> 00:44:54,139
The Goddess Kali resides in her!

400
00:44:54,449 --> 00:45:00,911
If she confidently says her sons
are coming, they must be en route...

401
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:04,158
- Accountant!
- I am...

402
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:08,157
Brother-in-law, finish the
story of this old hag today!

403
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:12,728
Brother-in-law her words
pierce like a needle!

404
00:45:14,036 --> 00:45:14,934
Crush her.

405
00:45:15,904 --> 00:45:20,864
What are you saying?
She is already dead.

406
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:24,474
Warriors do not assault women!

407
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:28,241
- I say crush the old hag!
- No.

408
00:45:29,051 --> 00:45:32,316
No! What are you doing?

409
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:51,096
Why do you get involved with them?

410
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:54,874
They terrorize the whole village.
Why do you want to kill yourself?

411
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:59,337
If I had to die,
I would have died long ago.

412
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:03,942
But death can't destroy me
till I have destroyed them.

413
00:46:04,453 --> 00:46:07,217
My sons will come to destroy them.

414
00:46:07,923 --> 00:46:10,255
The weapons of a mother.

415
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:14,094
Karan and Arjun will come.

416
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:18,859
Mother!

417
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:22,896
Mother.

418
00:46:59,241 --> 00:47:03,143
Run! Arjun run!

419
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:11,779
What's going on?
People suffer from sleep walking.

420
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,518
Do you talk in your sleep?

421
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:21,456
Can you see me? My heart is
beating like a neck slit chicken!

422
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,824
These bones are knocking about
like the coins of a carom board!

423
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:29,430
Whom do you talk to in your sleep?

424
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:32,734
I don't know.

425
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:37,743
But I could see strange shadows
right from my childhood.

426
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:42,005
I feel as if I have
some relation to them.

427
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,620
I have some deep bond with them.

428
00:47:48,023 --> 00:47:52,153
Something drags me to itself.

429
00:47:52,794 --> 00:47:53,954
Calls out to me.

430
00:47:55,096 --> 00:47:58,862
And what happened today...

431
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:02,996
...has never happened before.

432
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,272
What happened?

433
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:10,372
There is a village.

434
00:48:10,712 --> 00:48:12,942
Bells in a temple.

435
00:48:13,415 --> 00:48:15,349
A path...

436
00:48:16,017 --> 00:48:19,009
And I saw myself.

437
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:23,888
I am running and somebody screams...

438
00:48:25,026 --> 00:48:27,051
Run Arjun run!

439
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,994
Run Arjun run!

440
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:35,562
Ajay, your father vomited blood.

441
00:48:35,971 --> 00:48:37,632
The doctor said, he is very serious.

442
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:43,002
Liquor has destroyed his liver.
We will have to operate him.

443
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:46,076
- How much money will be needed?
- 10,000.

444
00:48:48,483 --> 00:48:51,509
Fine, you operate him.

445
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,490
- What? You'll lose this fight?
- Yes.

446
00:49:02,197 --> 00:49:04,028
Because today I have
to win against death.

447
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:06,557
It's a matter of my Dad's life.

448
00:49:08,003 --> 00:49:09,163
I need 10000 bucks.

449
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:12,098
Another shower of cash!

450
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,068
Cash? How partner?

451
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:17,807
He is the favorite.
People will bet for him.

452
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:20,340
But we'll win because he'll lose.

453
00:49:20,682 --> 00:49:22,582
And we won't have to pay anyone!

454
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:27,086
But will you really lose?

455
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:30,984
10000.

456
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:40,292
Is there anyone else?

457
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:43,331
There is! The local
favorite, Ajay.

458
00:50:30,585 --> 00:50:33,782
Isn't the one who got thrashed
the same whose picture you showed me?

459
00:50:34,122 --> 00:50:36,420
But I don't understand
how the tide has turned.

460
00:51:39,954 --> 00:51:42,081
What are you doing?
We will be ruined!

461
00:52:16,658 --> 00:52:17,590
What are you doing?

462
00:52:17,892 --> 00:52:20,520
Stop it. What are you doing?

463
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:22,194
You needed 10000 bucks!

464
00:52:22,664 --> 00:52:26,930
You said you'd lose the fight!
But you've ruined us by winning it!

465
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:29,027
What's wrong with you?

466
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:32,030
I wanted to lose the fight.

467
00:52:34,142 --> 00:52:40,741
I don't know what happened to me.

468
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,024
A life time remains
for you to know who I am.

469
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,960
But at this moment your father
only has a couple of moments.

470
00:53:01,669 --> 00:53:03,034
And this is my card.

471
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:30,228
- Who are you?
- My name is Ajay.

472
00:53:30,865 --> 00:53:33,356
- Is Mr. Saxena at home?
- Yes, sit. I'll call him.

473
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,858
- Who is it?
- My name is Ajay.

474
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:03,560
But there is no one named,
Ajay in Mr. Saxon's home.

475
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:05,990
I'm a guest.

476
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:09,903
Gentleman, all of us are
guests in this world.

477
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:14,604
Nevertheless, my telephone
line got linked with yours.

478
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:19,803
In the course of talking,
our hearts too may be linked.

479
00:54:20,148 --> 00:54:21,581
And we could become friends.

480
00:54:21,983 --> 00:54:24,281
So, are we friends?

481
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:25,846
I am not interested.

482
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:31,948
Sir, you appear a strict man.

483
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:38,025
I have just lit my
father's funeral pyre.

484
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:43,202
Please call Sonia.
I am Vijay speaking.

485
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:46,729
Excuse me... there
is a call for Sonia.

486
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:47,906
Tell him that Sonia has left.

487
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,374
She has left.

488
00:54:52,213 --> 00:54:53,908
Sonia dear, hurry up!

489
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:56,247
We have to go to the
airport to receive Suraj.

490
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,382
- She just left.
- You?

491
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:02,045
How is your father?

492
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:09,191
Here are your 8000 bucks.
I spent 2000 to cremate him.

493
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,228
I'll pay back soon.

494
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:21,206
I like your sense of self-respect.

495
00:55:23,244 --> 00:55:24,302
Will you work for me?

496
00:55:26,814 --> 00:55:32,184
Your strength, your obsession,
the fire smoldering in your eyes.

497
00:55:32,487 --> 00:55:34,819
I like them. Will you work?

498
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:40,390
I would have refused another
but I am indebted to you.

499
00:55:40,662 --> 00:55:43,426
- I'll begin tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow, right now.

500
00:55:44,565 --> 00:55:46,055
We have to go to the airport.

501
00:55:57,779 --> 00:55:59,508
- How was the trip?
- Fantastic.

502
00:56:00,114 --> 00:56:03,948
- Where's Sonia?
- She's anxiously waiting at home.

503
00:56:05,953 --> 00:56:08,547
My white Mercedes is outside.

504
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,384
You go ahead. I'll clear
the customs and come.

505
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:25,805
Is this Mr. Saxena's car?

506
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:27,999
Keep this briefcase in the car.

507
00:56:31,045 --> 00:56:33,309
Didn't you hear what I said?
Keep this briefcase in the car!

508
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:36,716
I am not your father's servant!

509
00:56:39,087 --> 00:56:42,022
You dare take the name of Suraj
Singh's father, Durjan Singh?

510
00:56:46,928 --> 00:56:49,658
Keep your right hand in your pocket.

511
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:53,395
Or you will have to eat
with your left hand forever.

512
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:58,869
I think both of you have
introduced yourselves.

513
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,832
He is Ajay, a superb fighter.

514
00:57:01,342 --> 00:57:04,004
And he is Suraj Singh,
Sonia's fiancÈe.

515
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,557
Since I came here
that's all I hear.

516
01:03:00,935 --> 01:03:04,098
Sonia is on her way.
She'll soon be here.

517
01:03:04,438 --> 01:03:07,168
It's turned to evening from morning
and there's no sign of Sonia...

518
01:03:09,176 --> 01:03:11,201
Here comes Sonia!

519
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:18,717
And you neither came to
the airport nor were you at home!

520
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:21,378
I want to tell you so much!
And listen to so much!

521
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:24,257
Will you first listen to me
or tell me about yourself?

522
01:03:25,025 --> 01:03:28,017
Now what do I listen to you
and what do I tell you?

523
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,863
- Why? - If you listen to
me, you will forget yourself.

524
01:03:31,198 --> 01:03:32,790
And if you'll forget yourself
what will you remember about me?

525
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:35,158
And if you won't remember,
what's the use in telling you?

526
01:03:35,569 --> 01:03:38,163
And what's the point in doing
something that's of no use?

527
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,906
Am I right? Bye.

528
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:46,809
What did she say?
Uncle did you understand?

529
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:50,216
Son, I'm not so stupid.

530
01:03:59,994 --> 01:04:04,931
Did you see? This gun can tear
apart a 3-inch steel sheet.

531
01:04:05,399 --> 01:04:07,663
It can shatter a bullet
proof glass into pieces.

532
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,763
Like, people select pearls
in the deep waters...

533
01:04:11,105 --> 01:04:13,699
...I too have selected
this deadly gun from abroad.

534
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:22,706
A month later, these guns will
be delivered at the borders.

535
01:04:23,184 --> 01:04:28,121
As usual, these guns will
reach me through Durjan Singh.

536
01:04:28,589 --> 01:04:29,783
And I will give them to you.

537
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:33,851
Place your order for
any number of guns.

538
01:04:36,697 --> 01:04:39,530
Uncle, I think, one of our
customers has not come.

539
01:04:41,402 --> 01:04:43,734
- Has he rebelled?
- No.

540
01:04:44,838 --> 01:04:46,362
No. He has become dishonest.

541
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:52,836
He did not pay me for
the goods bought last time.

542
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,149
And whenever I sent any of my
men to collect the money...

543
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:00,177
They did not return alive.

544
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:02,789
That means he swallowed our money?

545
01:05:04,325 --> 01:05:06,452
Such a man is not born!

546
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:14,692
I have created a man of
steel to get even with him.

547
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:42,185
Peter, talk to your
men over the telephone.

548
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:47,132
Ask them to make my payment.

549
01:05:47,534 --> 01:05:49,968
Or to take away your corpse!

550
01:05:55,509 --> 01:05:59,377
What is the matter? You are
trying to look very dashing today.

551
01:06:05,619 --> 01:06:08,611
Take this. All my debts are cleared.

552
01:06:09,123 --> 01:06:10,021
All right, Sir.

553
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,586
You are repaying everybody's debts.

554
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:16,528
- When will you repay mine?
- What have I taken from you?

555
01:06:17,031 --> 01:06:22,526
You have taken, what nobody
could ever take from me.

556
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:24,059
You didn't understand?

557
01:06:24,805 --> 01:06:27,865
You have taken this girl's heart.

558
01:06:28,242 --> 01:06:29,834
What? You, a girl?

559
01:06:31,812 --> 01:06:36,647
Look in the mirror. You don't
look like a girl from any angle.

560
01:06:38,485 --> 01:06:39,918
Am I not...

561
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:43,780
What's the matter?

562
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:48,079
Nothing. It felt...

563
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:52,852
I felt as if these bangles...

564
01:13:26,326 --> 01:13:31,764
I can only buy you glass bangles.

565
01:13:32,766 --> 01:13:33,892
Not golden ones.

566
01:13:34,668 --> 01:13:36,932
What's wrong with you today?

567
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:40,229
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

568
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:43,938
I did fall in love with you.

569
01:13:45,178 --> 01:13:49,638
But I never thought that
you are a princess.

570
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:52,779
And I'm the dust of the roads.

571
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,781
- Will I be able to give you all...
- You mean wealth is everything?

572
01:13:58,258 --> 01:14:02,752
No. Money helps man
buy expensive things.

573
01:14:03,263 --> 01:14:05,561
But not a heart.

574
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:08,629
Man can buy food with money.

575
01:14:09,136 --> 01:14:10,763
But not hunger.

576
01:14:11,605 --> 01:14:16,099
Man can buy a body with
money but not true love!

577
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:20,036
Love is the greatest
wealth of this universe.

578
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:24,044
Which you and I have got.

579
01:14:24,618 --> 01:14:27,178
Your love and affection.

580
01:14:29,623 --> 01:14:33,582
They are the treasures of my life.

581
01:14:34,628 --> 01:14:38,530
I'll never let them be away from me.

582
01:14:52,145 --> 01:14:54,113
I want to see you in palaces.

583
01:14:54,514 --> 01:15:00,680
And you've decided to make a
horse groom your life partner!

584
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:06,389
Not just make him my life partner
but promised to live and die together!

585
01:15:07,394 --> 01:15:11,228
Your anger and cruelty
cannot change our minds.

586
01:15:11,765 --> 01:15:13,824
I'll change his life!

587
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:17,928
I'll destroy him!
I can do anything!

588
01:15:19,272 --> 01:15:23,470
Can you carry your daughter's
pyre on your shoulders?

589
01:15:23,844 --> 01:15:29,214
You are blind in his love.
I'll show you when the time comes!

590
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:33,784
I'll shoot you if you
come out of the room tonight!

591
01:15:45,866 --> 01:15:50,030
You lead a peaceful life.
You are very fortunate.

592
01:15:50,403 --> 01:15:52,769
You have no tension about food.

593
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,900
I massage you; I serve you.

594
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:00,638
Who serves me? Nobody.

595
01:16:01,114 --> 01:16:04,140
In the next life,
I will be born as a horse...

596
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:06,919
...and you as Lingayya.

597
01:16:09,089 --> 01:16:10,750
Why are you laughing?

598
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,284
Hey! Why are you talking to horses?

599
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:15,923
Do you have time to talk to me?

600
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,923
You are busy diving in the
swimming pool of love!

601
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:23,431
The sea of love is very deep.
If you drown...

602
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:28,833
Hey! Drowning is what
they call love, right?

603
01:16:29,809 --> 01:16:34,803
You have really become a
lovesick Romeo in a week.

604
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:39,541
The thrill isn't the same
when you stake your life riding...

605
01:16:40,253 --> 01:16:43,347
...as is the thrill when you
stake your heart in love.

606
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:52,559
If you do not listen to me,
then your life will be at stake.

607
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:56,660
For I have brought your
death in my hand!

608
01:16:57,837 --> 01:17:01,329
A tiger's death in a mosquito's hand?

609
01:17:01,808 --> 01:17:05,574
Who is this impediment
in the path of love?

610
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:10,939
I am Durjan Singh's son
and Sonia's fiancÈe.

611
01:17:11,351 --> 01:17:12,750
My name is Suraj Singh.

612
01:18:36,236 --> 01:18:38,727
Sir...!

613
01:19:02,062 --> 01:19:04,553
Burn the place!

614
01:19:37,097 --> 01:19:40,328
Take him away and go! Hurry!

615
01:20:10,396 --> 01:20:13,388
Love got burnt!
Lover got burnt!

616
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:16,191
Very good, son!

617
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:19,833
To remove obstacles on the
way and to destroy enemies...

618
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:22,606
...is this family's tradition.

619
01:20:23,476 --> 01:20:26,104
So I have abided by the
family's tradition.

620
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:32,543
Fool! Jokes apart. Prepare
for your engagement to Sonia.

621
01:20:33,386 --> 01:20:35,217
We are coming there.

622
01:20:49,035 --> 01:20:53,301
Today is the happiest
day of my life.

623
01:20:53,673 --> 01:20:57,268
Because today I announce
the engagement of my only...

624
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:03,706
...daughter, Sonia to
Durjan Singh's son Suraj.

625
01:21:06,419 --> 01:21:11,322
Soon as he arrives,
the custom of engagement will...

626
01:21:11,591 --> 01:21:12,785
There he comes.

627
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:19,826
Stop!

628
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,676
You burnt my Dad's stable!

629
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,242
I'll burn your fingers!

630
01:21:36,049 --> 01:21:37,914
- Call the police.
- No!

631
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,852
Let go of me!

632
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:08,259
Run! Arjun run!

633
01:24:09,135 --> 01:24:10,830
Run! Arjun run!

634
01:24:11,371 --> 01:24:14,738
I tell you to run!

635
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:36,425
Arrest him!

636
01:24:56,182 --> 01:24:59,174
We are Thakurs by birth.

637
01:24:59,652 --> 01:25:05,284
Pride and anger courses through
our veins along with blood.

638
01:25:05,658 --> 01:25:11,893
Whenever our women step in
the quicksand of disrepute...

639
01:25:12,432 --> 01:25:18,064
We have them buried alive
in the walls of our homes!

640
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:22,063
But the love of my son holds me back.

641
01:25:22,675 --> 01:25:26,475
I have always fulfilled
every dream of my son.

642
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:30,440
And today I will fulfill this dream.

643
01:25:31,217 --> 01:25:34,186
You will marry my son in my house!

644
01:25:35,021 --> 01:25:39,048
Prepare to leave.

645
01:25:40,526 --> 01:25:43,495
I don't understand anything.

646
01:25:43,996 --> 01:25:49,024
All of a sudden why did
our hands stop fighting?

647
01:25:49,735 --> 01:25:51,635
And then why did he tell me this?

648
01:25:51,971 --> 01:25:57,170
Run Arjun! And why did I obey him?

649
01:25:57,577 --> 01:26:00,410
What did he say?
Repeat it again.

650
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,715
Run Arjun! Run!

651
01:26:04,484 --> 01:26:05,883
Something is terribly wrong!

652
01:26:06,352 --> 01:26:09,617
This is the same phrase
you uttered in your sleep!

653
01:26:10,823 --> 01:26:12,051
That's what I am thinking.

654
01:26:13,993 --> 01:26:16,052
The words I kept saying in my sleep...

655
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:18,219
I kept murmuring.

656
01:26:18,764 --> 01:26:22,063
The same words. The same name.

657
01:26:22,702 --> 01:26:25,967
How did they come on my lips?

658
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:29,668
Who is this Arjun?

659
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:54,997
Who are you?

660
01:26:55,368 --> 01:26:58,064
That's what I want to ask you.

661
01:26:58,437 --> 01:27:03,397
- Why does it feel as if...
- We know each other?

662
01:27:03,976 --> 01:27:07,104
We have some deep bond.

663
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:11,874
There's a chord that
draws us close to each other.

664
01:27:12,718 --> 01:27:15,710
We have met before.

665
01:27:17,089 --> 01:27:20,820
No. I don't even know your name.

666
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,091
Then in the party why did you say...?

667
01:27:25,565 --> 01:27:27,556
Run Arjun! Run!

668
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:31,128
I too am worried. I can't understand.

669
01:27:32,305 --> 01:27:35,399
How did these words come to my lips?

670
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:38,574
Who forced me to say it?

671
01:27:39,612 --> 01:27:41,671
I don't know any Arjun.

672
01:27:43,349 --> 01:27:45,340
Neither do I.

673
01:27:46,752 --> 01:27:50,745
But it feels as if we have some
strange relation to this name.

674
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:53,448
Some old association.

675
01:27:55,962 --> 01:28:03,835
Anyway my name is Vijay.
Thanks for saving my life.

676
01:28:05,671 --> 01:28:08,731
God forbid but if you
ever face such a situation...

677
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:13,276
I will repay this debt.

678
01:28:37,003 --> 01:28:40,063
Letter from Sonia for you!

679
01:28:41,007 --> 01:28:42,804
Something appears fishy!

680
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,339
Her servant gave it.

681
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,414
What is it son?

682
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,783
They are forcibly taking my
Sonia to Durjan Singh's mansion.

683
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:01,884
She has asked me to rescue her.

684
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:07,197
She writes if I don't reach there...

685
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:11,795
She will consume potion and kill
herself but won't marry Suraj.

686
01:29:12,471 --> 01:29:15,599
What are you thinking of?
Prepare to leave.

687
01:29:17,076 --> 01:29:20,705
If I go, what happens to your stable?

688
01:29:21,847 --> 01:29:24,247
- Your business...?
- Business goes on.

689
01:29:24,784 --> 01:29:28,049
But once lost how will life return?

690
01:29:28,521 --> 01:29:31,547
She is your love. Go my son.

691
01:29:31,691 --> 01:29:33,181
God be with you.

692
01:29:38,397 --> 01:29:41,423
That rascal has given you
these bangles, right?

693
01:29:42,101 --> 01:29:43,068
