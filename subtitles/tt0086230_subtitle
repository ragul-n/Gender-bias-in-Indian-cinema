00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,970
''The gust of wind,
and the surroundings...''

3
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,808
''they're like wine
for the crazy''

4
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,311
''The gust of wind,
and the surroundings...''

5
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,148
''they're like wine
for the crazy''

6
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,403
''He walks, he ambles,
and so does the other one...''

7
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,323
''Something falls,
something moves on''

8
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,493
''Like moths gone berserk...''

9
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,330
''they're all crazy here''

10
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,501
''Like moths gone berserk...''

11
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,462
''they're all crazy here''

12
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,394
''Why be sad when there's
wine flowing''

13
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,231
''Why does the soul seek
something by the seas''

14
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,818
''Wine is for the crazy''

15
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,405
''Why mingle with them?''

16
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,034
''Let's sing together...
the weather is lovely''

17
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,621
''Go on... don't lie''

18
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:30,126
''Have patience, crazy guys''

19
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,505
''This weather and
the blowing breeze...''

20
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,342
''they're like wine
for the crazy''

21
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,845
''He walks, he ambles,
and so does the other one...''

22
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,766
''Something falls,
something moves on''

23
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,764
Who are you?
- Your mother.

24
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:56,189
Mother? No.
You are not my mother.

25
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:11,162
My father has lots of hair
on his head. You are bald.

26
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,418
What's going on?
She's not recognizing us.

27
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,589
Don't panic.
We doctors call it ''amnesia''.

28
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,928
lf hit heavily on the head or
getting an emotional shock...

29
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,223
some people lose
their memory at times.

30
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:39,274
The way your daughter is talking,
she seems about 6-7 years old.

31
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,652
She can remember only up to
that particular age.

32
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,740
Whatever happened after that,
she has no recollection.

33
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:55,457
When she was 6 years old you must've
been pretty young, and lots of hair.

34
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,837
Yes, l did.
And l was thin too then.

35
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:08,136
She remembers that look.
Thus no recognition now.

36
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,182
You mean she'll remain
like this forever?

37
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:18,104
No. Don't worry. This is a temporary
phase. Will not last forever.

38
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,150
95% people get their memory back.

39
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,281
For how long?
How much time will it take?

40
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,621
Can't say. Could be a few days
or even few months.

41
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,668
But yes, psychiatric treatment
will help get her better sooner.

42
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:47,092
How to go about it?
- l have a good friend. Psychiatrist.

43
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:54,182
Take your daughter to him. She may
have to be kept in a nursing home.

44
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:39,662
l had heard of XXX Rum,
Hercules Rum, but Samson?

45
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:46,795
So what? lts rum isn't it?
- Honestly, you're hopeless.

46
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,383
But l've never heard of
this particular brand before.

47
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:57,722
You just did two minutes back.
- There'll be some new brands soon.

48
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,851
lt may be of any brand, but
the stuff should be strong!

49
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,564
Here.
- What nonsense!

50
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,984
You know l don't touch such things.
- You'll not only touch it...

51
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,820
but drink it too. Come on.

52
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,199
Why are you bleating
like a sheep?

53
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,664
We've met after five years!
Can't you take two sips for me?

54
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,964
No.
- You better. Else...

55
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:35,468
l'll force a bottle down your throat.
- No.

56
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,472
You won't, eh? l'll count up to 3
and then let go of this glass.

57
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,519
One... two... three.

58
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,950
What are you doing? Hold on.
One adds soda to it before drinking.

59
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,995
lt's so bitter.
How do you drink it?

60
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,043
lt's needs a bit of eXperience
and lots of practice.

61
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,545
lt's not your cup of tea.
Give me that.

62
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:20,180
See? One drop in you, and
it voiced its opinion!

63
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:30,231
How about some fun to go with?

64
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,579
You are so dirty-minded.

65
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:50,877
You mean you haven't...
done anything as yet?

66
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,801
You idiot! But why?
- Why?

67
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:05,016
Didn't need to.
- What? Say that again.

68
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,645
No, don't. lt's sacrilege.

69
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:13,024
One doesn't suppress
one's natural instincts.

70
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,777
They are to be released like a movie.

71
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,951
But l think you are not well.
l'll take you to a doctor.

72
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,267
What if l get some infection?
- What?! lnfection?

73
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,605
Govt. checks them thoroughly and
then issues a license.

74
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,155
You mean, Govt. checks all this too?
- Of course.

75
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,873
Hello Mr. Paintal. Long time no see.
- What can l say?

76
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,501
lt is the end of the month, and
l've also other eXpenditures.

77
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:14,836
That's true.

78
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,310
Don't you think she's a bit old?

79
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,397
A bit, eh?

80
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,363
l could hit you! She's the Madam.
Will l bring you here for her?

81
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:47,285
The real stuff is inside.

82
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,874
So... how are you, Mr. Paintal?
- Fine.

83
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,671
And who's this little master?
Looks like a greenhorn to me.

84
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,632
My friend from a hill station.
He lives there.

85
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,552
Hill station?
Must be very cold there.

86
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,516
Anyway, people find some way or
the other to keep warm!

87
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,436
Children...

88
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,359
My dear children...

89
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,429
Gulabi...
She's learning music these days.

90
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,432
Vocal?
- Flute.

91
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,228
My dear...
- Go in.

92
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,946
Well little master, what
would you like?

93
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:10,869
Tea.

94
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:18,835
He's very shy, you see. First timer.
A poor simple fellow.

95
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:25,508
An inauguration, eh?
You're very lucky, sir.

96
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:34,267
l've just the piece for you.
You'll go well together.

97
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,647
Where's that Reshmi?
- Here she is.

98
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,991
Why are you hiding behind that?
Come forward.

99
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:20,021
lf you just stand like that...
Come and sit down.

100
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,033
Will you keep standing like that?

101
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,034
Don't be scared.
l won't do anything.

102
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,880
Please sit down.

103
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:39,017
l won't force myself on you.
Please come.

104
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,620
l didn't even do anything,
and you hit me so hard?

105
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,663
What the hell did l do?

106
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,293
lf you didn't like me,
you should've said so outside.

107
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,965
See this.
How hard you hit me.

108
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,469
l told him l didn't wish
to go to such a place.

109
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,722
But he forced me to come.
- l was scared.

110
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:24,187
l got scared you see.
That's why.

111
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,154
lt's hurting you a lot, isn't it?

112
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:11,735
l was scared... very scared.
That's why.

113
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,821
lf she went from the Nursing Home,
where did she go?

114
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:21,036
lf we knew that wouldn't we
bring her here?

115
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:26,207
We know that the gate was open
and she went away somewhere.

116
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,421
We're enquiring in the area
and if need be, we'll search.

117
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,325
May l sit down?

118
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,305
You're not looking for a glass
to hit me again with, are you?

119
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:33,108
l had struck quite softly.

120
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:35,985
Really?

121
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:42,951
Softly, eh? Then l wonder how you
hit hard! You'd have broken my skull.

122
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:03,638
Does it hurt?
- No.

123
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,687
Your kind name?
- Yes?

124
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,731
What's your name?

125
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,737
Nehalata.
- What?

126
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:27,037
But don't they call you Reshmi?
- My name is not Reshma.

127
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,960
Here they call me that.
But why?

128
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,841
What do they call you at home?

129
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:52,771
At home, my mother...
she calls me Latti.

130
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,863
And my father calls me Neha.

131
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:03,823
How?

132
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,548
Where do you live?

133
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,094
You know that temple?

134
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,393
There is a pond near it.
l live there.

135
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:33,937
Which temple?

136
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:45,407
Where lots of pigeons perch.
And when you clap, they all fly away.

137
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:48,952
That temple.

138
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,374
The temple with pigeons.

139
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,511
Your age?

140
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,395
How do l know?

141
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,441
What's your father's name?

142
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,819
Father's name?

143
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:35,832
Mother's?
- Mother?

144
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,462
Her name is Raju.

145
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:45,342
Raju?
But that's a man's name.

146
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,638
That's what dad calls her.

147
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:56,978
Raju... could be Rajani,
Rajeshwari...

148
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,482
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

149
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:07,655
Mom... l want my mom.

150
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,701
Where's your mother?

151
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,454
Where will we find her?

152
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,459
l don't know.
l want my mom!

153
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,753
l want my mom.

154
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,262
How did you land in this place?

155
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:36,726
l was staying with a doctor.
One man said...

156
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:43,066
he'll take me to my mother.
l agreed.

157
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:47,696
But he left me here and went away.

158
00:24:56,246 --> 00:25:01,710
l don't like this house.
l feel scared here.

159
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,506
Many grown up men come here.

160
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:18,852
They've not given me food for
the past 2 days. l'm so hungry.

161
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,713
l don't like it here.
l'll run away somewhere.

162
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,263
Where will you go?
- Anywhere.

163
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,983
l want to go to my mother.

164
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:42,310
l don't think what you're doing
is correct. Think again.

165
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,441
l've given it a lot of thought
and then come to this decision.

166
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:18,638
l want to take Reshmi out.
- Out? No, she's very stubborn.

167
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,018
Never mind. l'll bring her back
in the morning.

168
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:28,690
Listen to me. Her brain's conky.
l think she's a mental case.

169
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,153
And if she creates a havoc
where you're taking her, then...

170
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:41,578
l'll get a bad name.
After all l've self respect too.

171
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:46,291
l'll find you somebody better...

172
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,005
Nothing will happen.

173
00:27:55,884 --> 00:28:01,848
You won't heed, will you?
Once you decide... it's final.

174
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:06,644
Thank God you got a 1st class.
lf you had to travel with her...

175
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,690
in a 2nd class, you'd have died.
Look how she's sitting.

176
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:16,821
Don't get me wrong.
But this seems senseless.

177
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,240
There is still time.
Think again.

178
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,868
lce-cream!

179
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,461
That one too.

180
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,103
Money?

181
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,984
Go on... pay him.

182
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:07,914
Want some?

183
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,626
No.

184
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,213
You can take a lick if you wish.

185
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,561
Get up...

186
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,777
Sit over there.
- Hold this.

187
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:40,613
Now sit down.

188
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,045
Okay Somu.
Take care and write to me.

189
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,677
lsn't that dicey man coming here?
- Don't say such things.

190
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:56,314
Rain...
- Yes. Hold it over your head.

191
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,953
Whose hanky is this?

192
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,431
What's your name?

193
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:36,980
Somu... Somprakash.
- You've two names?

194
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,899
No. You can use either.

195
00:31:54,831 --> 00:32:00,628
lt's so cold here.
Why is it so cold here?

196
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:06,009
Because of these hills.
- Why are the hills so cold?

197
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:10,972
Because they are so high, and
it's cold where there's height.

198
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,101
Why is it cold at heights?
- Because...

199
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:20,648
lt's been like that since beginning.
- Which beginning?

200
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:52,806
Hello Balua. Everything fine?
- Master? When did you come?

201
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,015
Just now.

202
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,383
Now what's the matter?

203
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,180
What's all this?

204
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:36,516
What?

205
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,437
This thing here.

206
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,232
That's a tree.
Eucalyptus.

207
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,631
Never mind. Don't try so hard.
Just say ''Nilgiri''.

208
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:03,103
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Aren't you cold?

209
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:10,652
Granny...

210
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:18,201
You've come? Bless you.
All your letters are inside.

211
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,913
Heard you had sent a wire...
Were you ill?

212
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,457
No. Just an eXcuse to
extend my leave.

213
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,345
ls this your house?
- Yes.

214
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:46,187
Who's this hag?
- Granny. Lives next door.

215
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:47,814
Which door?

216
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:58,700
Who's this girl?
- l'll tell you. Come on in.

217
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,200
What's your name?

218
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:45,038
Your name.
Don't you know?

219
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,626
l'll tell you. Shall l?
Your name is...

220
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,469
Hariprasad.

221
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:13,149
You know nothing about her.
Neither her past nor future.

222
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,653
And you say she's mentally retarded.
Even then you brought her here?

223
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,739
You should've found out
something about her.

224
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,956
What can l say? l found her
where she shouldn't have been.

225
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:34,796
Like a destitute. l couldn't
leave her there and come.

226
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,842
You mean you are going
to keep her here? With you?

227
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:45,223
What's wrong in that? l'm alone.
l have nobody either.

228
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:49,352
But what will people say?
- To hell with them!

229
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,856
Will people take care of me
in my old age? Do they care?

230
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,276
Or have they brought a proposal
to settle me?

231
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:02,032
And how long will you take care
of me as a neighbor?

232
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,020
You wanted to see me?

233
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:48,411
Please sit.

234
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,968
You can sit back and relaX.
Nobody will say anything.

235
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:15,105
Bought a new shirt?
- No l got it stitched.

236
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:24,197
ls Mr. Mukherjee in?
- He has gone to Bangalore.

237
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:30,578
You had wired that you were ill.

238
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:37,335
Were you really ill, or was it
just to extend your leave?

239
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:43,758
Actually to extend my leave.

240
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:51,641
l thought so too.
Can this body be ever sick?

241
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,073
l think l'll go now.
- Why? What's the hurry?

242
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,661
l've some chores to finish.
- Listen...

243
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:17,250
You're going by the estate?
- Yes.

244
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:22,964
Then l'll come with you.
l'm bored sitting here all day.

245
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:28,511
Come on...

246
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,065
When l came as the 2nd wife
of your boss...

247
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:46,071
l didn't imagine that life
could be so boring.

248
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:53,828
l find days hard to pass.
They seem to drag.

249
00:40:55,955 --> 00:41:00,168
l had so many plans,
seen so many dreams, but...!

250
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,588
Everything seems so beautiful
from afar.

251
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,842
What time do you sleep at night?

252
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:17,143
What time do you sleep? At nights.
- About 1 1 pm.

253
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,522
What do you do till so late?

254
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:31,700
l have my dinner by 9:30 pm.
Then l read for about an hour.

255
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:44,546
Your boss sleeps off by 7:30!
Do you know that?

256
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:55,557
l suppose at 55, l too will
hit the sack by 7:30 pm!

257
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,897
l think l'll make a move now.

258
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:07,277
lt's late, isn't it?
- Yes.

259
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:17,912
Take this.
Don't you want it?

260
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:36,598
We've left no stone unturned.
But what can l do?

261
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,435
Please give us more time.

262
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:45,565
lf you start worrying, who'll
give courage to your wife?

263
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:39,744
''O life, do embrace me''

264
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:50,338
''For l have embraced every
sorrow that you have given me''

265
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:59,514
''Embrace me, O life''

266
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:48,646
''Aay from the world,
quite secretly...''

267
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:53,902
''l have made a family
for myself in my dreams''

268
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:59,949
''Aay from the world,
quite secretly...''

269
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:05,622
''l have made a family
for myself in my dreams''

270
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:11,628
''ln you l have
found support, O life''

271
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:21,930
''Your support l now have, O life''

272
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:33,024
''Embrace me, O life''

273
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:43,410
''Haven't l embraced every sorrow
you have given me...?''

274
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:52,711
''Embrace me, O life''

275
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:53,521
''lt was just a shadow,...
to my eyes it brought tears''

276
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:58,651
''And l have now come
to cherish it''

277
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:00,362
''lt was just a shadow,...
to my eyes it brought tears''

278
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:07,035
''And l have now come
to cherish it''

279
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:12,999
''My shores l have found,
O life''

280
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,635
''l have anchored at last''

281
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:29,307
''Embrace me, O life''

282
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:35,230
''Embrace me, O life...''

283
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,620
''Embrace me, O life...''

284
00:47:51,454 --> 00:48:01,047
''Embrace me''

285
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,911
Don't you feel cold at all?
Neither have you worn warm clothes...

286
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,914
nor do you cover your body.

287
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:23,880
So how can cold survive
in such heat?

288
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:26,716
Come here.

289
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,853
Go home now. Go on.

290
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:08,401
Let me come to school today.
- l told you not to come there.

291
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:16,284
Don't go here and there. Go home.
l'll come home in the evening. Okay?

292
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:22,624
What?
- l said...

293
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:44,854
Somu is very bad.
He never takes me to school.

294
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,775
Never mind, Hariprasad.
We'll play at home.

295
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:58,535
Listen. Didn't you go to school?
What's your name?

296
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:17,095
So my dear gentleman, whether
old or young, Hindu or Muslim...

297
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:22,559
Ramu and his brother Shamu
salute you all. Ramu, salute.

298
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:26,104
Well done!
Applause.

299
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,028
Silence.
Now watch Ramu's dance.

300
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:45,290
Dance Ramu.
One, two, three... go!

301
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:56,092
lf somebody like you comes
in my life, it may make my life.

302
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:01,431
Well done, Ramu.
Applause.

303
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:16,029
Roll over now. Quick.

304
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:17,781
Well done.

305
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:19,282
Enough, son.

306
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:29,459
Ramu, your father wants water.
Take it to him.

307
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:35,715
Not obeying, eh? Strange.
What's wrong?

308
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:42,847
Your mother wants water.
Take it to her.

309
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:49,062
He refuses to take it?
Rascal! But what do l do?

310
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:59,531
Your wife wants water.
Take it... look at him!

311
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:01,324
Henpecked husband!

312
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:08,415
Dance Ramu... dance.

313
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,252
Dance Ramu.

314
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:18,466
Dance, l said!

315
00:54:30,603 --> 00:54:32,022
A fine handler you are!

316
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:35,275
Take. Hold it.

317
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,530
What are you doing?
l get scared.

318
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,491
lf you hit a monkey,
he'll do the same.

319
00:54:56,421 --> 00:55:01,509
How nice.
Do it again. Okay?

320
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:15,607
Jump Ramu.

321
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:19,444
Stop! Stop!
You're naughty, eh?

322
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:21,738
l'll hit you.

323
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:31,289
What do l say now?
- Roll over.

324
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:33,166
Roll over.

325
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,127
Oh yes! Roll over, Ramu.

326
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:39,839
Yes. Once more.

327
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:44,094
Once more.

328
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,388
Stop!

329
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:48,932
Salute first.

330
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:54,145
Pick it up now.

331
00:55:57,482 --> 00:56:00,318
Your mom wants water.
Take it to her.

332
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:04,322
Your father wants water.
Take it to him.

333
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,825
You won't?

334
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,415
Don't know what to say.
- Wife.

335
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:18,461
Your wife wants water.
Take it to her.

336
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:25,885
Wait! Wait!
Don't run!

337
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:30,015

The ink is on top of the cupboard.
l'll have to climb up.

353
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:54,951
Then get it down.

354
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:03,376
Now!
- No! Later on.

355
00:59:04,836 --> 00:59:06,546

Oh God! My school...

Didn't l say l'd give it later?
What was your hurry? Monkey!

360
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:55,155
Do you know, tomorrow

361
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:03,163
lf you don't put '' Bindi'' on him
will your dog end up a celibate?

362
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:06,207
Hey, what's all this?

363
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:11,796
Granny...

364
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:21,514
What happened?
- He's always yelling at me.

365
01:01:22,557 --> 01:01:25,477
Why Somu? Why do you scold
this poor kid?

366
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:30,607
Kid? Look what she has done.

367

She has grown like an ass, but

01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:38,823
Don't say that. The poor thing
doesn't know anything.

369
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:42,202
What did you do, my dear?

370
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:51,628
To put a bindi on my doggie,
l asked for some ink.

371
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:57,092
l asked for just this much.
And he said he'd give it later.

372
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:06,810
l thought l'd take it myself.
l climbed up, but l fell down.

373
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:11,481
What could l do, Granny?

374
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:17,404
You should've given it to her.
- No. You keep quiet, Granny.

375
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:22,534
You've spoilt her completely.
- Look. He's scolding her too.

376
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:25,161
Don't look at him.
- He's looking at me!

377
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:26,705
Quiet!

378
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,835
l didn't do it on purpose.

379
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:39,718
l climbed and fell down.
What could l do?

380
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:12,751
Over! lt's all over.

381
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,966
What happened?
- Nothing. The food is ready.

382
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,221
There's a big tall girl in the house
but l've to do all the work.

383
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:31,353
Don't call me names.
- Sorry. Not tall but a useless girl!

384
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:47,243
Don't cry dear. You want food?
Eat with me.

385
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,600
Where's my wallet?
- The wallet.

386
01:04:11,142 --> 01:04:15,563
l don't know Gran.
l didn't even see it.

387
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:17,273
l asked where's my wallet?

388
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:20,819
l don't know!
- Then what do you know?

389
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:25,073
Who kept it, if not you?
lt didn't grow wings to fly off!

390
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:34,666
Look. lt's always like this.
He fights with me.

391
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,209
Hush, my dear.

392
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,140
l'm going.
- Where?

393
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:52,642
To hell.

394
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:56,771
Don't break anymore things.
Stay put in one place.

395
01:04:57,605 --> 01:05:01,359
Don't you dare talk to me again.

396
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:20,795
Such temper! Tch! Tch!

397
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:26,486
What's this? Such a big bag!
Weekly shopping?

398
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:29,531
No, l just went to get some bread.

399
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:34,035
Why didn't you cook today?

400
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:37,414
l didn't get time to cook
due to some other chores.

401
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:41,793
Come with me then..
- What?

402
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:44,546
For lunch.

403
01:06:47,424 --> 01:06:53,138
Well you see...
- Look, Somu, we aren't untouchables.

404
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:57,100
Nothing will happen
if you lunch with me.

405
01:06:57,684 --> 01:07:01,813
Nonsense! That's not it.
l'll come... some other time.

406
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,314

409
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:40,727
Why keep these old newspapers?
- They are to be sold off.

410
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,508
That's me.

411
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:15,762
This is your daughter?

412
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:26,356
May l speak to lnspector David?

413
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:31,528

There's a gentleman with me.

414
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,115
He says he has seen my daughter
going in a train from V.T. station.

415

What are you doing here?

416
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:26,750
And why have you got this ribbon on
like a girl?

417
01:09:40,638 --> 01:09:41,890
Want to eat or not?

418
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:08,458
Granny, where's Reshmi?
- She was in the house just now.

419
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:11,086
She's not there now.
- Then she must be playing nearby.

420
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,262
Had Reshmi come here?
- No.

421
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:34,359
Found her?

Where could she have gone?
- No idea. This rain on top too.

423
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:47,622
Why did you scold her?
She cried so much.

424
01:10:49,165 --> 01:10:53,753
Where can she be?
- Must be sulking somewhere.
