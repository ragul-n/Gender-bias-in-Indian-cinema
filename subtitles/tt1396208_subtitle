1
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:58,280
Bunty. - Yes, Sweetie.

2
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,279
This is for you.

3
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,287
Oh! How sweet, Tanya.

4
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,885
Red heart shaped box. Very nice.

5
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,051
Damn.

6
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,788
Bunty, will you marry me?

7
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,428
That's your favourite
Question. Right, Tanya?

8
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,695
You keep giving me a fright by asking
this question again and again.

9
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,170
What's there to be afraid of?

10
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,433
And if l wanted to frighten you..

11
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:24,739
..l would've said Please marry me,
l'm pregnant with your child.

12
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:27,470
That would've been better.
Less scary.

13
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:30,447
Listen Sweetie.
lf you want we can move in together.

14
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,747
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.

15
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:34,285
But no Mister and Missus.

16
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,049
And no marriage.

17
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,019
l've promised grandpa..

18
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,652
..that l'll get married.
And that too only to you.

19
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,961
Then you can't fulfill your
promise in this lifetime, Tanya.

20
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,860
Bunty, marriage is an institution.

21
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,765
A mental institution, Tanya.

22
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,995
And the living examples
are my parents.

23
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:55,308
Marriage is the end of love, Tanya..
- Bunty..

24
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:56,940
You will know what
l am talking about..

25
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,171
..once you meet
my parents.

26
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,437
10. - 13.

27
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,842
10. - 1 1 .

28
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,248
10, that's it. 10.

29
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,253
Sir, everyday you
buy dozens of goods.

30
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:12,757
And haggle for just paisa 50 a dozen.

31
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,951
lt's a long story. - How long?

32
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,655
lts 5ft 7 inches long.

33
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:24,797
People normally get married to
fortunate, lucky and virtuous girls.

34
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,337
But l got a spendthrift wife.

35
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,332
She has changed the entire
meaning of expenditure.

36
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,936
She spends my money like water flows.

37
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,649
Sometimes she shops for so long..

38
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,147
..that she takes
a blanket and a pillow..

39
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:42,216
..and sleeps in the Home
Department of the mall..

40
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,256
..so that she can get up again
in the morning and start shopping.

41
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,018
l'm done with shopping
for small things.

42
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:49,522
The real shopping..
l will do it tomorrow.

43
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,591
Not just that.

44
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:55,657
lf the stereo of the car doesn't work..
- She buys a new stereo.

45
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,930
No, she buys a new car.

46
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,664
And look. Do you see this dress?

47
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,605
lts worth 2.5 lakhs.

48
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:06,334
She says that Mallika Sherawat
wore this dress in 'Murder'.

49
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:09,678
What do you say? - Mallika
Sherawat wore a dress in 'Murder'.

50
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,545
When? - That's exactly what l say.

51
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:18,818
That's why l come here from Lokhandwala
to buy cheap fruits and vegetables.

52
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,894
Brother, l pray that
even Osama Bin Laden..

53
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,855
..doesn't get a wife like mine.

54
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,333
Oh, God. - You intentionally
ruined the dress.

55
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:33,937
Mala, why would l do anything like that?

56
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,599
Because you don't
want me to look pretty.

57
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,336
That isn't possible anyway.

58
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,774
Whether l do something
or not, it would make no difference.

59
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:40,938
Really?

60
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:42,879
Then why did.. - Marry you?

61
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,779
Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?

62
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,952
Don't keep taunting me.

63
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:48,684
Anyone can commit mistake.

64
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,415
Yes, just like your parents did.

65
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:53,492
You. - Mala mind your tongue.

66
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,619
Or else..
- Or else? - Or else. - Yes.

67
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,663
Or else. - Or else what?

68
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,958
Hey, get back to work all of you.

69
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,328
Get to work.

70
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,800
Bhikhu, you do your work as well.

71
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,299
Should l do all the work?

72
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:09,498
l can't even fire him.

73
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:12,505
People get motorcycle
in dowry but what did l get?

74
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,672
This servant. Who can't even
dream of doing any work!

75
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,613
Be thankful that
you at least got him.

76
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:18,776
Stop it

77
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,510
What is this?

78
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,688
lt took you 20 years
to realize your dream.

79
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,621
To turn your hotel
into Bollywood Cafe.

80
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:27,852
For this?

81
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:31,090
So that you can utilize every nook and
corner of this place to argue.

82
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:33,832
For god sake, your staff laughs at you

83
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:40,328
'God, please show me a way to stop
mom and dad's arguments forever.'

84
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:51,445
Why did you bring me here, Tanya?

85
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:54,219
So that you can
explain to my grandpa..

86
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,754
..why you're allergic to marriage.

87
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,883
Come on. - l see.
Call him, call him. Where is he?

88
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,018
l have a even fresh matter today.

89
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:05,564
l will call him. Grandpa. Grandpa.

90
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:07,361
Tanya, hi.

91
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:10,836
You didn't tell me that
your grandpa is Albert Einstein.

92
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,097
Shut up, okay.

93
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,306
My grandpa means everything to me.

94
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:17,442
18 years ago when there
was an earthquake in lndonesia..

95
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:20,810
..my mom, dad..
- Do all scientists..

96
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,438
..get their haircut
in the same saloon?

97
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:23,948
l will kill you. Bunty. Come on.

98
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,210
Grandpa.

99
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,285
How is my child?

100
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:30,389
Grandpa, he's Bunty.

101
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:33,617
l am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves. - Hello, sir.

102
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:49,969
Sir, what is this?

103
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,209
This. This is a time machine.

104
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,815
A machine that will
connect us with our past..

105
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:59,044
..and make our future better.

106
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:02,721
A machine that will
break the sound barrier..

107
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:05,781
..and take us back,
l mean to our past.

108
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:07,686
Time machine?

109
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:10,456
Professor,
they are are just film fiction.

110
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,190
How can you make a time
machine in realilty, professor?

111
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,358
lt can be made,
we can make, we can make.

112
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:18,026
lf we can see the past then
we can also travel into the past.

113
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:19,195
Think logically.

114
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,863
Because logically..
- Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa.

115
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,032
What is this?

116
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:25,544
You were supposed to explain to
Bunty about marriage and not logic.

117
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:26,976
Don't change the topic, Tanya.

118
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,536
Sir, you were saying
something extremely important.

119
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,879
Please go ahead.
We can.. - Yes, yes.

120
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,214
We can see the alpha Changeli..

121
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,378
..which is four light
years away from us.

122
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:38,455
We don't look at
it the way we should.

123
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:42,085
But we look at it just
as it looked four years ago.

124
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,526
Correct? - Correct.

125
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:45,696
The star called Turios that we see.

126
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,528
We see it like it
was nine years ago.

127
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,202
We don't watch it..

128
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:53,198
By the way.. do you look at
your face in the mirror?

129
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,297
Yes! Every hour.
That isn't fresh either.

130
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:57,870
lts 10 nanoseconds old.

131
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:02,448
Tell me.. if you get an
opportunity to go back into the past..

132
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,875
..which mistake would you
rectify?

133
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:06,446
My mom and dad's marriage.

134
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:09,048
Yes, Grandpa, this is the topic.
Marriage.

135
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,590
Now ask him why refuses to marry me.

136
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,683
Yes, why don't you
want to get married?

137
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,621
l am scared.

138
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,029
lt's just an excuse.

139
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,530
lf you have the courage
to fall in love..

140
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:21,293
..then you should be
prepared for marriage as well.

141
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,629
Logically you should marry Tanya.

142
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,967
Stop saying that.
Don't spoil her life.

143
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:29,302
Think logically and tell
me before 12 o'clock tomorrow night.

144
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,105
Because after 12 o'clock
l am going on a test ride..

145
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,371
..in my past.

146
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:35,437
Professor l have no time to think..

147
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:38,449
..because tomorrow is
my parent's 35th anniversary.

148
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,917
And l have planned
a surprise party for them.

149
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,124
Everyone must be
thinking looking at you..

150
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:50,560
..that why isn't her husband
begging on the streets.

151
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,760
You look like Zhaveri
Bazaar's showroom.

152
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,229
lt's better than looking like
an antique piece in the flea market.

153
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,272
How much does she love me?
How much does she love me?

154
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,773
Enjoy the party guys. Go on!

155
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,103
Excuse me, get me a drink please.

156
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,940
l should do all the work.

157
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:18,023
Uncle Bhikhu,
were mom and dad always like this..

158
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,388
..or did this happen after marriage?

159
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,950
They were sworn enemies.

160
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:24,120
Their marriage was the
second biggest mistake..

161
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:26,165
..in the history of mankind.

162
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,459
After the atom bomb.

163
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:31,196
When actually it
wasn't their mistake..

164
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:32,794
..but your grandparents.

165
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:33,998
How is that?

166
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,041
They're dead and all that's
left of tehm are their pictures.

167
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:41,112
But they still don't like
staying next to each other.

168
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:44,543
Your grandpa Rai Bahadur Dhyanchand.

169
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,886
No one ever took his
advice nor was he brave.

170
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,717
Especially before your grandma.

171
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,652
And your grandma Bholi Devi.

172
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:54,223
She wasn't innocent or a Devi.

173
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:57,688
Wonder why they got
their children married..

174
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:59,958
..and sent me here as the dowry?

175
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,730
lf l had wings, l would soar high.

176
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:11,876
l would show you
the anguish in my heart.

177
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,876
Here he comes, the great two-in-one.

178
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,538
Two-in-one? - Yes, Kundan Lal.

179
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:19,608
He's a singer, sings in two voices.
Male and female. - What?

180
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:23,678
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?

181
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,881
Where did you get these
new set of teeth from?

182
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:30,119
Kundan, what a surprise. - Mala.

183
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:34,396
Bhikhu.

184
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,166
Where did this duet come from?

185
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,472
l didn't know that Kundan
is also going to be here.

186
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,203
How are you, brother Kundan?

187
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:46,345
Mala. Kishen. - Mona.

188
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,545
l am no longer Mona,
but Ma Jogeshwari.

189
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,215
You've named a
railway station after you.

190
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:52,944
Since when?

191
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,714
How did you stay with
Kitchen Kumar so long?

192
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,182
What can l do?
l thought about it several times.

193
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:02,190
But its not right to throw
the master out of the house. - What?

194
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:04,688
Who is he?

195
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:07,561
Kundan, he's my son.

196
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:08,959
Bunty.

197
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:11,403
But he is very good looking.

198
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,265
Like father like son.

199
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:14,864
You?

200
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,609
Look handsome? - l was joking.

201
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,508
You only appaear to be.

202
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,407
And that's regretting as well.

203
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:28,583
Son, there was a time when
your father would do cabaret for me.

204
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:32,283
What? - Dad, really? - l see.

205
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,224
Seems like dear dad
has kept secrets from you.

206
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,624
What do you mean? - He means..

207
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:41,292
Kundan, show him sir's dance moves.

208
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,096
Should l show you? - Kitchen Kumar.

209
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,670
You're great, the shirt is very good.
-Don't say anything about my shirt

210
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:52,575
Come on. - Are you mad?
Everybody is watching me.

211
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:54,336
Dad, do something.

212
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,711
He's just joking, he's
an old friend. - Joking, joking.

213
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,052
Come on.

214
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,350
Come on. Nice shirt.

215
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,923
Come on kishan. Go.

216
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:08,789
We used to do it in our childhood.
Forget it. What're you doing?

217
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:12,728
Come on. Nice shirt.

218
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,364
Leave me. - No one can save you.

219
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,994
Kundan, Kundan.

220
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,441
Take you pants.

221
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,772
Look.

222
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,888
Kundan is just a friend.

223
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,825
l never thought
about him like that.

224
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:46,262
Mom, dad,
at least don't fight tonight.

225
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:50,063
Bunty, who would you prefer
to stay with? - Katrina Kaif.

226
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,100
Bunty, l am talking
about the both of us

227
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,469
l am divorcing your mother.
- That's a lie.

228
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,974
Actually l am divorcing him.
- Very good, very good.

229
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:58,407
You guys have fun, l am leaving.

230
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,042
Bunty. Bunty.

231
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,374
Friends.

232
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:08,082
To make this celebration of
a 35 year old mistake memorable..

233
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:15,616
..l request Mr. Kundan
Lal to sing a song in twin voices.

234
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,952
Come, come.

235
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:21,397
Ladies and gentlemen.

236
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,863
l made this song
for my dear friend..

237
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,939
..Mala for her marriage with Kishen.

238
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:31,008
So can we change the mood now?

239
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,203
Clap.

240
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,681
Now you can do it like this.

241
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,216
Take it to the left.
Or you can do it like that.

242
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:42,311
Shake it to the right all my ladies
and my man and my men and my ladies.

243
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,221
All my ladies and my man and
my men and my ladies.

244
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,383
You can do it like this.

245
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:47,949
When my mom and dad
didn't have any love story..

246
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:49,426
..then what was
the theme of the song?

247
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:50,790
Shake it to the right.

248
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,694
Which song would suit
such an unromantic couple?

249
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,026
How would both of them
look singing together?

250
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:00,668
You can do it like this.
Take it to the left.

251
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:03,172
Take it to the right.
You can do it like that.

252
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:07,212
Shake it the right or my ladies and
my man and my men and ladies.

253
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,010
My ladies and my man and
my men and ladies.

254
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,572
You can do it like this.

255
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:14,152
You can shake it to the left.
You can do it like that.

256
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,088
Shake it to the right all my ladies
and my man and my men and my ladies.

257
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,088
All my ladies and my man
and my men and ladies.

258
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:26,324
What a terrible blunder.

259
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:31,832
Marriage turned into a nightmare.

260
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,471
lt's a bundle of sorry.

261
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:34,801
lt's after your life.

262
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,536
lt's better to die.

263
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,673
lt's the reason for all the sorrows.

264
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:48,147
What a terrible blunder.

265
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,375
When you're attending a marriage.

266
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:13,037
Always advice him.

267
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,374
Don't get married.

268
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:15,744
lt's dreadful.

269
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,782
Don't regret it later.

270
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,779
Here's your chance.

271
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,079
Run away now.

272
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,951
Pacify your heart
that's eager for marriage.

273
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:29,153
Run away from the marriage dais.

274
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:35,167
What a terrible blunder.

275
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:15,805
The person who..
got married first in the world.

276
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,673
Catch hold of him, thrash him.

277
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,575
He's responsible for the mistake.

278
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:26,813
The person who..
got married first in the world.

279
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:29,581
Catch him, thrash him.

280
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,919
He's responsible for the mistake.

281
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,658
He was stupid.

282
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:37,890
He was cruel and ruined others.

283
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:42,764
Kill him cruelly.

284
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:47,871
What a terrible blunder.

285
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:53,568
Marriage turned into a nightmare.

286
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:59,643
What a terrible blunder.

287
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:05,713
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

288
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:07,553
l know! - Mom, dad!

289
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:11,957
l would've never married
you if mother hadn't pressurised me.

290
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:14,632
You've always been the
biggest geek in the world.

291
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,299
You don't have any style
of speaking, no personality and..

292
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,133
..your outfits.. - Don't say
anything about the outfits, Mala.

293
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:22,140
You dare not say
anything about them.

294
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:25,104
No one washes clothes
like l do in entire Lokhandwala.

295
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,805
l am talking about
wearing and not cleaning.

296
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,711
And that's what will say
even after l die, isn't it?

297
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:32,307
That buy a plain
cloth to cover her body.

298
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:35,285
Oh no, l know you will stand up,
throw a tantrum.

299
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:37,719
Couldn't you get Kanjivaram?

300
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,224
Exactly, you didn't give
me anything during my lifetime.

301
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,192
l will definitely ask
for something after l die.

302
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,188
l didn't give you anything
as long as you were alive?

303
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,027
What did you give me?
Did you even buy me a dog?

304
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,032
All our neighbours have dogs.

305
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,364
But we don't. - l am there.

306
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:54,301
Then why do you need a dog
to secure the house, madam?

307
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:56,466
At least the dog
will keep me company.

308
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,169
lt will go along with me.

309
00:19:58,277 --> 00:19:59,938
Didn't l ever go out with you?

310
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,411
When did you?
When did you ever take me out?

311
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,642
Should l remind you?
On our honeymoon.

312
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,444
And l thought we'll go to Kashmir,
Kulu Manali.

313
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,078
But where did you take me? - Hubli.

314
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:13,818
And only because you were
getting someone's bungalow free of cost.

315
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,295
Kishen, you never
cared about my feelings.

316
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,333
Taking me for a movie, dinner,
picnic was a farfetched thing.

317
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,034
You never uttered a
romantic word to me.

318
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,863
lt takes two to tango, Mala.

319
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:31,100
You hated me before
the marriage and also after.

320
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,811
l don't try to keep
myself busy with the..

321
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,437
..restaurant business for no reason.

322
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:38,875
l didn't go shopping
without any reason.

323
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:42,579
Kishen, if l am a shopaholic today..

324
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,122
..then you're the reason for it.

325
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,884
Because l tried to find happiness..

326
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,483
..in these jewellery,
clothes and shoes.

327
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,358
But now l have realised..

328
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,191
..that l will never be able to find
that happiness in all this.

329
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,100
You found that out after spending 9,
35, 33, 315?

330
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:07,608
No, after wasting 12, 054
days and 23 1/2 hours of my life.

331
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:26,958
Dad.

332
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,499
Mom. Mom.

333
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:32,031
Dad. Mom.

334
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:34,667
Mom. Dad.

335
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:39,367
Mom. Dad. Mom.

336
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:42,112
God.

337
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,848
l will never let you two separate.

338
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,586
Never.

339
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:33,193
l know l am going
to do a crazy thing.

340
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:36,659
But there's no other
way to stop this divorce.

341
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:41,134
To change their present,
l will have to change their past.

342
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,436
Professor.

343
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:46,671
Professor.

344
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,778
Professor. - So you're finally here.

345
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:54,017
So what have you decided
about marrying Tanya?

346
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,982
Professor, l want to make a request.

347
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:58,453

Who permitted you to do so?

Who are you?
- Your father, you fool.

405
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:30,513
Dad. - Sorry, Father,
l couldn't recognise your voice.

406
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:33,948
But l instantly recognised
you when you called me fool.

407
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,978
Stop blabbering and pass me my gun.
- Here Father.

408
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:39,584

Careful, grandma.

416
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:14,052
This glass piece might've hurt you.

417
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:18,153
Rai Bahadur, what's going on?

418
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:21,092
Why are you scaring
these innocent children?

419
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,528
lnnocent children?

420
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:26,168
Look, what they've
done to my plants.

421
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:28,604
l know,
l made them cut the branches.

422
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:30,299
Why did you cut the branches?

423
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,240
What right do you have?

424
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,538
These trees are mine. - Quiet.

425
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,180
There's no need to get angry
for just few branches, get that.

426
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:41,979
My tree, my groves.

427
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:45,523
Even birds don't make
their nests on these trees.

428
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,849
And by growing roses
under the plum tree..

429
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,621
..do you want to grow
a new kind of plant?

430
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,858
You shouldn't be concerned
with what l do with them.

431
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:55,331
This is my property.

432
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,865
And this bungalow that you've
seized.. - What did you say?

433
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,432
That belongs to me as well. Yes.

434
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,667

out of this house.

l will get an emergency
declared on you.

437
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:11,647
That's going to be declared
three months later, grandpa.

438
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:12,944
Grandpa? Who are you?

439
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:17,680

give them a fitting reply, father.

440
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,317
Scoundrels, watch now.

441
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,724
Just watch. What are you doing?

442
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:25,762
Now you'll know how my son is.

443
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,668
Oh.. no.

444
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:47,714
So this is my dad..
so this is how he is.

445
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:01,991
You threw a balloon at my father.

446
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:08,603
My delicate, innocent and..

447
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,937
Stop praising me.

448
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,236
And give them a reply. - Ok.

449
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,190
What was that?

450
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,427
ls that your fitting reply?

451
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:39,067
Father, l think the
water pressure was low.

452
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:42,070
So.. Father. Father.

453
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:44,937
You're fool.

454
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:49,810
That's a nice kurta, Kishen.

455
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:52,781
Kundan, please leave me alone.

456
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:57,282
Bhikhu, take his kurta off.
- Will l do all the work?

457
00:32:57,455 --> 00:33:00,253
No, Kundan, let me go.

458
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:02,287
Don't tear my clothes.

459
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,918
Mala's gang is here.

460
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,123
We'll deal with you later.

461
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:07,289

00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,095
Are you fine?

465
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:15,968
Those children stepped on me.

466
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:21,471
Who are you?
- l will tell you later. Bye.

467
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:23,241
Mother is coming. - Mother?

468

l kept smouldering all day,
it's surprising.

469
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:11,621

526
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:20,709
l love you.

527
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:24,476
Julie.. Brother Kundan.

528
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:28,683
Brother Kundan, do you want
to stay unmarried all your life?

529
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:31,786
Have you ever thought about love,
marriage, girls..

530
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:33,379
..or will l have to do that for you as well.

531
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:35,250
l did.

532
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:37,884
l also did. - l see.

533
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:39,523
Thrice.

534
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:41,826
'The first time..'

535
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,094
'l love you, Kamla.'

536
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:46,161
'l want to marry you.'

537
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:49,038
'What, love marriage?'

538
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:51,007
'What, love marriage?'

539
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:52,303
'What, love marriage?'

540
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:54,101
'What, love marriage?'

541
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:55,571
Result..

542
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:57,075
'We believe that a boy and girl..

543
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,741
..can have only one
relation willingly.'

544
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:01,182
'And that's Raksha Bandhan.'

545
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:04,455
So what if l wasn't
successful the first time.

546
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,383
But l still desired
for love-marriage.

547
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:17,891
'Here's my marriage card.'

548
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:21,229
She handed me the card
to her arranged marriage.

549
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,738
The third time l went up
to the temple for the love marriage.

550
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:31,741
But l was slightly late.

551
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,211
No..

552
00:39:35,753 --> 00:39:37,345
When love marriage isn't possible..

553
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:39,554
..then what's the
point of falling in love?

554
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,125
Here, keep the glass.

555
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:48,632
And don't forget to pay him.

556
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:55,370
Fool. - Yes!

557
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:58,134
What are you doing?

558
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,742
Father, l am frying fritters.

559
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:03,210
Here. Keep 10 rupees.
For the household expenses.

560
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:07,109
And if anything happens
to the rose plants in my absence..

561
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:08,948
..then l will send you to hell.

562
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,079
But, Father, how is that possible?

563
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:12,486
Quiet, fool.

564
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:19,023
How many times have l
said keep the ignition running.

565
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:21,959
That heroine will come any moment.
- Where do you want to go?

566
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,231
All lndia Radio. - Yes, madam.

567
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,563
What Yes, madam.

568
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:27,998
l want to go to VT Station.
- Fine, driver.

569
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:29,935
You can drop him to VT Station..

570
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:31,975
..but first take
me to All lndia Radio.

571
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,236
And let's go.

572
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:35,802
But l am in a hurry,
this is my car. - Quiet.

573
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:42,182
Come.. Come..

574
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:45,417
Today Kishen Kumar will see
stars in daytime.

575
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,486
Now you just watch what l do. Come.

576
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:56,262
Hello. - Kishen?

577
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,991
Yes, who is this?

578
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:00,560
This is.. aunt Jamuna.

579
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:03,106
Yes, hello, aunt Jamuna.

580
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,505
Where are you speaking from?

581
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:07,075
You fool, pick up the pots.

582
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:09,342
Pick up the plants.

583
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:13,176
Should l do all the work? - No.

584
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:15,709
l should pick up the
plants and talk to you?

585
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,479
Yes, Kishen.

586
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:18,715
Pick up the plants and speak.

587
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:21,153
l think aunt has gone crazy.

588
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:25,789
Pick this one.

589
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:30,965
How is it? - Aunt, it's heavy.

590
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:35,729
lt will do.
- Aunt, where are you speaking from?

591
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:38,870
Where do l live? - Jaipur, aunt.

592
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,467
So l am speaking from Jaipur.

593
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:43,537
But your voice sounds quite clear.

594
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,206
So why are you yelling, you fool.

595
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,015
Aunt, father has said..

596
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:49,245
..that we should speak
louder on a trunk call.

597
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:50,650
He's a fool.

598
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:54,357
Maybe you might know better.

599
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,524
But he will kill me.

600
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:58,528
lf he misbehaves..

601
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,359
..then throw him out of the house.

602
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:04,527
But.. aunt,
won't that be a bit too much? - No.

603
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:06,069
He drives my mother crazy.

604
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:08,128
But isn't your mother dead?

605
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,230
l am talking about my mother.

606
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:12,242
Don't you and father
have the same mother?

607
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:15,305
Oh, no.

608
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,037
He's the servant's son.

609
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:20,749
After the servant died
my mother raised him.

610
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:24,579
What? My father
is the servant's son?

611
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:28,553
That means l am a
servant's grandchild.

612
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,524
Ask Bhikhu.

613
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:33,056
Bhikhu knows about it. - Yes.

614
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:35,227
Bhikhu is your father's brother.

615
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:38,461
The servant of my cruel,
low-down, scoundrel neighbour..

616
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:39,627
..is my uncle?

617
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:42,069
Kishen, aren't you ashamed
to abuse your neighbours?

618
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,164
Why shouldn't l,
aunt, why shouldn't l?

619
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,142
The mother's a witch,
the daughter's a spectre.

620
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,472
You know, last month..

621
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:51,344
..they pulled down
my father's loincloth.

622
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:52,712
Do you know that?

623
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:55,645
l laughed at the sight of the scene.

624
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,821
Aunt, you laughed as well.

625
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:03,083
But aunt, he's my father after all.

626
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:04,818
Though he's a servant's son.

627
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:14,469
Aunt.. how is uncle Popat? - Popat.

628
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:17,638
Popat.. flew away. - What?

629
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,811
Let it be, there are others.

630
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,147
Others. Others at this age?

631
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:28,377
This is the age to enjoy.

632
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,454
What's the name of the other uncle?

633
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:33,280
Bull. - Bull?

634
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:34,819
Bull.

635
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,223
After popat (parrot) now its bull.

636
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:39,090
Bull? - There are two.

637
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:42,227
You're two timing?

638
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,291
Bhikhu, Kundan, run.

639
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:47,194
Bhikhu. Kundan.

640
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:51,540
Thieves!
Thieves! My father's plants!

641
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:56,543
This one's broken as well.

642
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:57,841
Thieves!

643
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:00,315
Catch him.

644
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,927
Bhikhu. Bhikhu. Thives. Stop.

645
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:32,840
What have you done, Mala?

646
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,151
My father asked me
to protect the plants.

647
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:39,253
My fathers will surely kill me.

648
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:40,949
There's no need for that.

649
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,554
Because there's something
going to happen to you..

650
00:44:43,694 --> 00:44:46,390
..after which you will die of shame.

651
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:53,464
What did you say
about us on the phone?

652
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:56,399
Ghost. Witch.

653
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,937
Today we'll make
your plight such that..

654
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:02,241
..you won't be able to
face the entire neighbourhood.

655
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:05,140
What do you mean?

656
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,207
l mean.. Kundan.

657
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,488
We mean.. that day we pulled
your father's loincloth..

658
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:15,219
..and today its your turn.

659
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,320
No, Kundan.

660
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:18,487
Kundan, please.

661
00:45:18,562 --> 00:45:19,654
Kundan, don't.. - Come on.

662
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:20,788
Kundan, look..

663
00:45:20,898 --> 00:45:22,331
Kundan, it'll tear.

664
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,095
Kundan, l would be left with no clothes.

665
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:26,062
lt's okay. - Mala, please tell them.

666
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:27,229
Kundan, be careful.

667
00:45:27,304 --> 00:45:29,568
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.

668
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,130
Mala, be scared of the Lord.

669
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:33,540
Look, Mala, don't.. - Come on.

670
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:38,542
Kishen.

671
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:39,946
Kishen.

672
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:44,719
Mala,

673
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:05,070
Where are my roses?

674
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:06,735
Where are my roses?

675
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:18,622
The roses were drying.

676
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,150
So l made a paste out of them.

677
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:23,720
Where's the paste?

678
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:34,027
l.. l..
it was mother's anniversary..

679
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:37,407
..so l fed the paste to mother..
No, to the bull.

680
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,735
lf it was mother's anniversary..

681
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:41,903
..then you should've fed
the paste to the cow or the bull?

682
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:45,441
The cow. - So?

683
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:51,382
l didn't realise whether
it was a cow or a bull.

684
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:52,547
Why?

685
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,886
Was the bull wearing pants
that you couldn't find out?

686
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:56,050
You fool.

687
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,490
Go and get betel leaf for me.

688
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:00,086
l am in the mood
for betel leaf today.

689
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:03,228
Father, money?

690
00:47:04,802 --> 00:47:06,929
l gave you 10 rupees in the morning.

691
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:12,270
l.. lent it.. to friend?

692
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:16,074
On what interest rate? - One..

693
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:17,444
One percent.

694
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:20,177
None.

695
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:26,451
lf you don't get
the money in 24 hours..

696
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:29,254
..then l will recover
the money by selling you off?

697
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,894
But father, who will purchase me?

698
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:35,796
Quiet. Get out.

699
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:56,012
Who are you?

700
00:47:56,787 --> 00:47:57,981
10 rupees.

701
00:47:59,623 --> 00:48:02,023
And 50 paise interest.

702
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,418
But how can l take this?

703
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:06,927
l can't accept this? - Keep it.

704
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:09,795
Everything l own belongs
to you as well as me.

705
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:13,701
No, no, no, no, no..

706
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:17,202
You shouldn't touch my feet, da..
Kishen.

707
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:20,606
l suggest you accompany me
to my restaurant.

708
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:23,076
l will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my place.

709
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:25,210
l'll prepare some mango juice for you.

710
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,245
That's the problem, Kishen.

711
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:29,386
You don't have to make mango juice.

712
00:48:29,687 --> 00:48:32,656
Why? - l helped you,
didn't it? - Yes.

713
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:34,417
So what can you do for me?

714
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:38,754
Give my life?
- No, no. - Yes, l can give my life.

715
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:41,798
No, no, no. - l will do it. Kishen.

716
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:43,364
Listen.

717
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,058
You will have to do
a small favour for me.

718
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,696
Yes, tell me.

719
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:51,238
Remember Mala. Mala.

720
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:55,274
That witch Mala.
- Yes, that witch Mala.

721
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,048
You will have to.. - What?

722
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:04,549
l've to treat her to mango juice.
- No, no, no.

723
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:08,622
You've to make her.. fall.

724
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:10,292
She's already fallen quite low.

725
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:11,520
How much further do you
want me to make her fall down?

726
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:13,995
No, no, l don't mean literally.

727
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:15,855
How do l explain to you?

728
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,394
Yes.

729
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:21,632
You've to..

730
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:28,036
No. - Oh, God.

731
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:30,113
How do l explain to him?

732
00:49:30,481 --> 00:49:31,812
Yes. Watch, watch.

733
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,250
Look, this is you. And this is Mala.

734
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:38,946
And this is..

735
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:42,118
And this is me.

736
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:45,660
Here's your money.

737
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,488
l would prefer dying..
than do this.. with Mala.

738
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,325
Kishen. Kishen.

739
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:55,501
You're trying to
ruin my life, Kishen.

740
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:59,804
Kishen! lf you make
Mala fall for you..

741
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,844
..then l will give you 5000 rupees.

742
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:12,316
l had a wager with my friends
that you can make Mala fall for you.

743
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:16,550
And if that happens then
l will win the bet of 10000 rupees.

744
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,359
And l will give you 5000 rupees.

745
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:23,190
Think, Kishen, you can fulfil
your dreams with so much money.

746
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:27,598
Your dream transform Suryaprakash
restaurant into a trendy hotel.

747
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,990
What will l have to do?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, come on.

748
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:57,465
Okay. Let's start.

749
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:01,368
First, try to imagine Mala's face..

750
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:02,733
Mala, no, no.. - Please.

751
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:03,898
Please.

752
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:06,465
Just try to visualize Mala's
face in your mind.

753
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:37,235
'Mala!'

754
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:41,235
That girl looks dangerous
even in my dreams.

755
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:44,609
She's a cannibal.
- Kishen. Kishen. Kishen. Kishen.

756
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:47,582
But why don't you like Mala?
- How can l?

757
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:49,112
Shameless girl.

758
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:51,248
She holds my hand publicly.

759
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:56,055
lf any girl.. if any girl holds
my hand l dislike it.

760
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:59,787
You don't like it when
girls hold your hand? - l don't.

761
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,624
ls everything fine, Kishen?

762
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,191
What do you mean?

763
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:04,696
l mean..

764
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:06,030
Yes.

765
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:07,570
When you would sit down to study..

766
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:09,935
..would any thought
cross your mind..

767
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,737
..that would deviate
your concentration?

768
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:17,542
Yes. That happens with me quite often.

769
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:18,774
Thank God.

770
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:21,943
Bunty, whenever
l sit down to study..

771
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,180
..l start wondering..
- What do you wonder, Kishen?

772
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:26,483
What, Kishen.. - Yes.

773
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:30,458
l wonder that.. if l don't
find aubergines in the market..

774
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:31,755
..how will l make aubergine roast.

775
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:36,796
Like, if l get loose motions..
- No, no, no, no, no.

776
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,635
l mean thoughts that..

777
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:42,769
Try to understand.

778
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,704
l am teaching you things..

779
00:52:44,775 --> 00:52:46,072
..that you should be teaching me.

780
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:53,545
Bunty, l understand you a bit.
- l do now.

781
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,446
You mean..
- l am taking nuptial rounds.

782
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,953
And instead of concentrating
on the marriage..

783
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:01,457
..l am watching the sun.
- What do you mean?

784
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:06,186
l mean when will the
sun set and when will l..

785
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:09,060
Yes. Yes.

786
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:12,197
Thank God, everything's fine.

787
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:15,733
Now, you've got to have
similar feelings for Mala.

788
00:53:18,342 --> 00:53:20,435
Have you ever seen Mala closely?

789
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:22,201
l mean like that.

790
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:24,475
That way?

791
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:28,610
You mean adult way.
- l mean affectionately.

792
00:53:29,086 --> 00:53:32,647
Her innocence,
her naiveness, her grace.

793
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,820
The poor girl only has a mother.

794
00:53:36,426 --> 00:53:38,291
l know. - And poor Bholi Devi.

795
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:42,788
She goes to All lndia
and sings to make a living.

796
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,000
What does she sing?

797
00:53:57,648 --> 00:53:59,115
Oh, God. - That's why.

798
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:02,208
Who is there to protect
Maya and explain to her?

799
00:54:02,786 --> 00:54:04,413
Who? - Who?

800
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:07,318
Who? - lt's you. You.

801
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:12,686
l will explain to Mala.
- So let's go.

802
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:15,630
l will show you how innocent,
delicate and naïve Mala is.

803
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:17,132
Let's go, Kishen.

804
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,497
Bunty, just a moment.

805
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:21,197
Bunty, slow down. - Let's go.

806
00:54:28,378 --> 00:54:29,936
Not today, Kishen.

807
00:54:30,047 --> 00:54:31,947
Not today. - Why, what's wrong?

808
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:35,280
lts dark, so l won't be able to
see the innocence on her face.

809
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,780
Bunty, let's try once.

810
00:54:39,957 --> 00:54:41,015
My heart says.

811
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:42,182
Just once.

812
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:44,954
Such eagerness, Kishen.

813
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:46,120
No, let's watch it tomorrow, Kishen.

814
00:54:46,196 --> 00:54:47,288
Come on.

815
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:49,492
Three, Kalbadevi.

816
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:54,002
Ticket. - Tell me something.

817
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:57,769
What do you think about Kishen?
- Very bad.

818
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:00,004
Hatred is not good, Mala.

819
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,168
What should l do?

820
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:03,337
My blood begins to
boil when l hear his name.

821
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:08,282
l want to..
- Let me be born, Mother. - What?

822
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,118
What kind of a girl are you?

823
00:55:10,354 --> 00:55:13,448
You don't have any grace,
innocence or naiveness.

824
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:18,452
Grace. lnnocence. Naiveness.

825
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:20,121
What is that?

826
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:24,561
These are the qualities that
can help a girl become a model.

827
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:27,632
That means you can
never be a model, Mala.

828
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:30,370
No, l can't be one.

829
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:31,873
Because l don't want to be one.

830
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:33,303
Why should l take up modelling?

831
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,038
To become rich.

832
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:38,239
To be famous.
But you can't become one.

833
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:41,484
l was a fool to make
a bet for 10000 rupees..

834
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:42,882
..that Mala can be a model.

835
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:44,713
But now l will lose.

836
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:48,217
l thought l will
give you half the money.

837
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:49,953
Sad.

838
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:52,259
l can try for 5000 rupees.

839
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:56,123
She, a model?
- What kind of a model? - Soaps.

840
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:57,625
And what will she say?

841
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:59,360
lf you don't wash
your clothes with 501 ..

842
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:01,370
..l will beat you up.

843
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:03,132
Good one.

844
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:04,673
Point to be noted, Mala.

845
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:08,637
You should behave like a simple,
innocent lndian woman.

846
00:56:09,713 --> 00:56:11,374
And like a goon or hooligan.

847
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,309
You've to be very delicate,
very shy.

848
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:17,046
l got it.

849
00:56:17,754 --> 00:56:20,518
l've to be like.. Kishen.

850
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:27,794
My love,
don't make me restless anymore.

851
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:33,234
l've been mesmerised by your love.

852
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:38,798
My love,
don't make me restless anymore.

853
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:43,972
l've been mesmerised by your love.

854
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:46,811
l've been mesmerised by your love.

855
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:49,408
l've been mesmerised by your love.

856
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,751
l've been mesmerised.

857
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:13,235
My love.. l am restless, eager.

858
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:17,872
My eyes.. search for you.

859
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:19,278
Where are you?

860
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:22,477
Let me dwell you in my eyes.

861
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:29,617
My love.. l am restless, eager.

862
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:35,562
l will love you beyond limits.

863
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:38,793
l will hum tunes of your love.

864
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:43,966
My love,
don't make me restless anymore.

865
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:49,376
l've been mesmerised by your love.

866
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:52,209
l've been mesmerised by your love.

867
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:54,875
l've been mesmerised by your love.

868
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:57,545
l've been mesmerised.

869
00:57:57,621 --> 00:58:00,249
l've been mesmerised.

870
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:08,454
l am beauty, l am bliss.

871
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:11,090
You're the radiance in my heart.

872
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:13,895
l am the flame.

873
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,962
l burn only for you.

874
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,943
l can wait for you all my life.

875
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:24,870
Every moment's filled with agony.

876
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:27,973
Whenever you're not around.

877
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:34,957
When we meet the events
planned for us will begin.

878
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:41,062
Without you life's meaningless.

879
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:44,232
When l find you l will
hide you from the world.

880
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:49,534
My love,
don't make me restless anymore.

881
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:54,804
l've been mesmerised by your love.

882
00:58:54,878 --> 00:59:00,373
My love,
don't make me restless anymore.

883
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:05,786
l've been mesmerised by your love.

884
00:59:05,889 --> 00:59:08,380
l've been mesmerised by your love.

885
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:11,450
l've been mesmerised.

886
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:16,760
l've been mesmerised by your love.

887
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,096
l've been mesmerised.

888
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:22,366
Kishen.

889
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:25,269
Kishen, it's not right to
touch my feet, try to understand.

890
00:59:25,742 --> 00:59:28,370
Bunty, you were right.

891
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:30,039
l was the fool.

892
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:34,049
Mala is a virtuous girl.

893
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:37,843
And l was mistaken about her.

894
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:45,487
Bunty, l am in love with Mala.

895
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:54,769
l didn't know that
she's a doll and not a don.

896
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,264
She's so delicate.

897
00:59:57,908 --> 00:59:59,899
l will marry Mala.

898
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,574
The first love marriage
of our neighbourhood.

899
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,272
And no one can stop
me from making this history.

900
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:08,214
No one.

901
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:11,645
There are already so many problems in this
love story and now this triangle.

902
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:16,115
lf he tries to entice
Mala then what about dad?

903
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:18,655
And what about me?

904
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,055
God.

905
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:23,127
Rajesh Khanna is married, Mala.

906
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,667
Girls are ready to be his mistress.

907
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:27,129
They write letters
to him in blood..

908
01:00:27,203 --> 01:00:28,864
..and express their love.

909
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:31,940
Today l too.. - Stop this madness.

910
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,533
You know he will even
have two daughters in future.

911
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:38,506
By the way, Mala, l know a nice boy.

912
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:40,613
And you will like him.

913
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:42,609
l see.

914
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:46,387
He's rich. He's slightly educated.

915
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:47,821
And his looks aren't all that bad.

916
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:50,722
The most important fact is
that he will always be caring towards you.

917
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:52,861
He will support you all your life.

918
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,125
He will look after you.

919
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:56,659
Who is he?

920
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,392
Kishen.

921
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:08,975
Ladies and gentlemen,
did you hear what Bunty said?

922
01:01:09,045 --> 01:01:12,208
Mala. - Kishen will look after me.

923
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:14,983
He will take care of me.

924
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:19,214
That fool can't take
care of himself and..

925
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:20,914
Mala, he has changed.

926
01:01:21,491 --> 01:01:23,686
He has become very brave.
He's changed.

927
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,024
l see. Then..

928
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:28,688
l am ready to elope
with him and get married.

929
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,432
Really?

930
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,967
l will be his slave.

931
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:35,666
You're not serious, Mala.

932
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:40,837
He will have to do just one thing.
- He will, done.

933
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:46,209
He will have to hold
my hand publicly and say..

934
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:49,143
Mala, l want to marry you.

935
01:01:49,753 --> 01:01:51,118
Oh no.

936
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:52,279
He will.

937
01:01:52,389 --> 01:01:55,984
Kishen will say it. He has
completely changed. - Let him.

938
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:58,390
He will do it, Mala, he will do it.
Kishen will do it.

939
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:00,418
He will have to say it.

940
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:04,324
And if he doesn't say it then l will
beat you up. - He will do it, Mala.

941
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:05,800
Kishen has become very brave.
- Yes, yes.

942
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:08,531
l will go and talk to him right now.
- Come out, Kishen.

943
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:10,163
l am not coming out.

944
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,538
Look, Kishen, it's the
question if your honour now.

945
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:16,475
l value my life more
than my honour, Bunty.

946
01:02:16,746 --> 01:02:20,079
That woman will make
mincemeat out of me.

947
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,612
l did not want to do this, Kishen.

948
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:25,313
l did not want to do this.
l did not want to do this

949
01:02:25,388 --> 01:02:26,582
No! No!

950
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:28,620
And if you don't win this wager..

951
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,625
..then l will make
mincemeat out of you.

952
01:02:30,693 --> 01:02:33,025
She says that if Kishen
asks me to marry him..

953
01:02:33,096 --> 01:02:35,257
..then l will be his slave forever.

954
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:40,064
lf l marry her then
l will have to be her slave.

955
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,598
You already are.

956
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:45,466
l am here to change your future.

957
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:49,007
Only if Mala lets me have a future.

958
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:51,912
Come here.

959
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:55,384
Leave me alone, Bunty.

960
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,781
Kishen.

961
01:03:02,025 --> 01:03:04,391
He dared to set eyes on my Mala.

962
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:07,826
Just watch now,
l will make his plight so bad..

963
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:10,229
..that he will never
think of Mala again.

964
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:13,800
And then.. Mala will be mine.

965
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:03,844
Enough, enough, enough.
Just a minute.

966
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:09,151
Now Kishen will publicly announce
that he wants to marry Mala.

967
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:10,453
Clap.

968
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:16,196
lf l say anything
to her she is going to kill me.

969
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:17,756
Bunty, please let me go. - No.

970
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:19,528
Let me go, Bunty.

971
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:21,502
Come on, Kishen.

972
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:25,438
Now call Mala, go.

973
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:29,906
Mala, come here.

974
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:33,880
She doesn't want to come,
let's go home.

975
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,247
C'mon!

976
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,177
Are you calling the pigeons?

977
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:38,345
Order her.

978
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:39,682
Call her with a
commanding voice, Kishen.

979
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:41,780
Come on, come on, come on.

980
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:48,026
Mala. - What is it?

981
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:49,592
Come here.

982
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:54,035
Loudly, Kishen, come on.

983
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,264
Kishen! Come on, Kishen.

984
01:04:56,906 --> 01:04:58,168
Come here.

985
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:02,474
You.. come here. - Okay.

986
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:07,413
Let's go home, Bunty. Lets go home.

987
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:09,508
Look, Kishen,
we can't step back now.

988
01:05:09,619 --> 01:05:10,950
The bet has been made.

989
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:12,515
That arrow has been shot, Kishen.

990
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:14,453
For God's sake, Kishen, go.

991
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:17,353
Close your zip.

992
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:20,318
You're just..
Couldn't you tell me earlier?

993
01:05:22,932 --> 01:05:24,399
Change your walk, Kishen.

994
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:26,198
Come on, Kishen.

995
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:29,033
Come on, Kishen. Come on.

996
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:35,367
Let me be born of love, Kishen.

997
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:37,245
Prove it to Mala,

998
01:05:37,647 --> 01:05:40,639
Kishen! Kishen! Kishen!

999
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:54,626
Kishen! Kishen!

1000
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,870
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1001
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:45,138
You're hopeless.

1002
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:47,312
There's no cure for you, Mr.
Kishen Kumar.

1003
01:06:47,683 --> 01:06:49,480
Do l have a very high fever,
brother Bunty?

1004
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,712
l am talking about your personality.

1005
01:06:51,888 --> 01:06:54,049
You fainted holding a girls hand.

1006
01:06:54,156 --> 01:06:55,817
lt was so shocking?

1007
01:06:55,892 --> 01:06:57,519
Was Mala an electrical pole?

1008
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,386
You know what, l quit.
l am going. - Where?

1009
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:02,255
To hell. Do you have a problem?

1010
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:04,298
Why are you yelling?

1011
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,924
Because l am frustrated.

1012
01:07:07,003 --> 01:07:09,403
l came back only
to improve your future.

1013
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:11,063
But it's just a waste of time.

1014
01:07:11,307 --> 01:07:13,138
Because you can't change.

1015
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:16,638
You know, l am sorry to say this..

1016
01:07:16,712 --> 01:07:19,374
..but you'll stay
a dimwit all your life.

1017
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:39,627
l won't stop you if
you want to leave, Bunty.

1018
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:43,838
But l would like to say that..

1019
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:52,643
..no one's born smart or a dimwit.

1020
01:07:57,553 --> 01:07:59,544
After my mother passed away..

1021
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:03,125
..my father didn't re-marry..

1022
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,324
..so that l don't get a step-mother.

1023
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:11,390
That's why l shouldered all
the responsibilities of the house.

1024
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:18,097
Kishen was reduced to Kitchen Kumar.

1025
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:27,181
After that.. l was my
father's son and his constant companion.

1026
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,878
l would look after
father in the house..

1027
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:35,615
..and the customers
at the restaurant.

1028
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:38,587
That was my life.

1029
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:43,995
Now you tell me. Bunty..

1030
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,035
..how could l keep
up with the world..

1031
01:08:48,371 --> 01:08:52,273
..with all the responsibilities?
Tell me?

1032
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:58,808
Now if you leave then this
dimwit will always remain a dimwit.

1033
01:09:07,223 --> 01:09:08,690
l might be a dimwit..

1034
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:12,550
..but l will make my son very smart.

1035
01:09:13,396 --> 01:09:15,023
Just like you.

1036
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:17,962
l won't burden him with any responsibility.

1037
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:20,725
l will educate him.

1038
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:23,232
l will teach him everything
that l don't know.

1039
01:09:23,672 --> 01:09:27,608
l will give him all the
happiness in the world that l never got.

1040
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:34,175
Just watch, Bunty,
my son will never take after me.

1041
01:09:36,052 --> 01:09:37,314
Can l say something?

1042
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,812
l love you, dad.

1043
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:40,653
l love you, dad.

1044
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:42,587
Why do you call me, dad?

1045
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:46,424
You will find that
out 30 years later.

1046
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:51,160
Now watch,
Dad, l will teach Mala a lesson.

1047
01:09:51,534 --> 01:09:52,660
l love you, dad.

1048
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,426
Don't keep repeating it.

1049
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:58,296
Did you see Kishen's face?
- l should look at him too.

1050
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:00,671
He was shivering so severely..

1051
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:03,303
..that l thought he might
fall apart into pieces.

1052
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:06,174
But he fell unconscious before that.

1053
01:10:06,816 --> 01:10:10,047
Friends,
congratulations for Kishen's..

1054
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:11,210
Cheers.

1055
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,117
Drink it,
drink all the coco cola you want.

1056
01:10:13,222 --> 01:10:15,315
lt's going to be
banned after 2 years.

1057
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:17,020
Come, Bunty, sit down.

1058
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:18,185
What would you like to have?

1059
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,491
Poor Kishen is suffering and you..

1060
01:10:21,564 --> 01:10:24,431
You said that Kishen
has become brave.

1061
01:10:24,533 --> 01:10:25,795
l didn't ask you.

1062
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:27,533
And as far as celebrations
are concerned..

1063
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:29,434
..then can't l celebrate my victory?

1064
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:32,096
l wouldn't have interfered if
you were rejoicing your victory.

1065
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:34,674
But you are celebrating
someone's defeat.

1066
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:36,409
Of someone's helplessness.

1067
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:39,280
While pretending to be heartless..

1068
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,282
You really have become one, Mala.

1069
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:54,193
Stop. Stop.

1070
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:00,332
When someone has lost her father..

1071
01:11:00,836 --> 01:11:05,330
..and mother goes to work,
she has to stay stern towards the world.

1072
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:08,240
Otherwise the world won't
let us live in peace.

1073
01:11:12,148 --> 01:11:16,983
Mother has suffered a lot
after father passed away, Bunty.

1074
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,182
The shopkeeper would intentionally..

1075
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:23,185
..try touch her whenever
she would go to buy rations.

1076
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:25,687
Whenever she would
visit the doctor..

1077
01:11:26,428 --> 01:11:29,795
..he would make her breathe deeply.

1078
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:36,102
Mother was very good looking,
but all alone.

1079
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:42,002
Once a drunkard barged
in our house with a garland.

1080
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:44,779
Mother was frightened
and started screaming.

1081
01:11:46,182 --> 01:11:47,274
That was it.

1082
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,550
After that mother decided.

1083
01:11:50,152 --> 01:11:53,485
Mala, if you want to live
keep the world at your feet.

1084
01:11:54,323 --> 01:11:55,551
Only the mighty can
survive in this world.

1085
01:11:56,559 --> 01:11:59,357
But if you're weak
you will have to suffer.

1086
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:05,426
Wait.

1087
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:10,263
l didn't know, mom.

1088
01:12:11,607 --> 01:12:12,767
l didn't know.

1089
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:18,875
Kishen, close your eyes.
- Will you sport a knife?

1090
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:20,346
No, no.

1091
01:12:25,054 --> 01:12:26,316
Here you go.

1092
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:33,922
Give me a smile.

1093
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,769
Oh, God.
He needs a complete makeover.

1094
01:12:40,836 --> 01:12:41,962
Come.

1095
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:46,565
Can l open my eyes?

1096
01:12:48,244 --> 01:12:49,336
Sorry, dad.

1097
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:52,180
My teeth!

1098
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:55,349
They're not tusks for which
you're screaming so loudly.

1099
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:15,862
Help.

1100
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:22,838
One.

1101
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:28,879
Oh no! What is this?

1102
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:36,182
How is it, Bunty? l did four.

1103
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:49,600
1 7, 18, 19, 20..

1104
01:13:55,511 --> 01:14:01,177
32, 33, 34..
come on, come on, Ghajini.

1105
01:14:01,283 --> 01:14:03,945
Who is Ghajini? - No on, continue.

1106
01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:06,453
We're coming, Mala, we're coming.

1107
01:14:07,923 --> 01:14:09,117
What?

1108
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,354
What's this?

1109
01:14:12,528 --> 01:14:14,496
This is just Rs.200. - So?

1110
01:14:15,397 --> 01:14:18,264
l can only lock Kundan
for seven days for this.

1111
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,967
My job will be done in seven days.

1112
01:14:20,069 --> 01:14:21,229
Really?

1113
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:30,342
Come on. - What happened, sir?

1114
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:32,641
Come on.
- There's some confusion, sir.

1115
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:36,015
But what have l done?

1116
01:14:36,151 --> 01:14:37,675
Will l have to tell you that?

1117
01:14:38,787 --> 01:14:40,084
Can't you think..

1118
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:43,317
..what wrong have you done
in the last seven days?

1119
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:45,323
Think.

1120
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:46,826
Think for seven days.

1121
01:14:47,162 --> 01:14:48,754
Seven days.

1122
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:14,422
Kishen, point no.1 .

1123
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:15,980
Don't get too excited
and start singing.

1124
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:18,492
Just lipsync and l will sing.

1125
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:21,027
Point no.
2, don't give Mala any importance.

1126
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:24,588
Make her restless.

1127
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,134
May l have your attention!

1128
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:28,601
Ladies and Gentlemen

1129
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:38,142
Lower your voice.

1130
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:57,629
Attitude.

1131
01:15:57,699 --> 01:15:58,791
Attitude.

1132
01:15:58,867 --> 01:16:00,698
That attitude is fake.

1133
01:16:00,803 --> 01:16:01,861
Attitude.

1134
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,028
Attitude.

1135
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:05,038
Leave that attitude behind.

1136
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,198
Attitude.

1137
01:16:06,308 --> 01:16:07,366
Attitude.

1138
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:09,376
That attitude is fake.

1139
01:16:09,478 --> 01:16:10,638
Attitude.

1140
01:16:10,712 --> 01:16:11,804
Attitude.

1141
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,212
Leave that attitude behind.

1142
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:16,911
Love is an illusion.

1143
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:21,685
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1144
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,956
Love is an illusion.

1145
01:16:27,196 --> 01:16:30,529
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1146
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,965
Their beauty is a trap.

1147
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:36,197
They're a bundle of problems.

1148
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:39,172
And their useless attitude.

1149
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,142
They look cute.

1150
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,581
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1151
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:51,919
They surely look cute.

1152
01:16:53,355 --> 01:16:56,620
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1153
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,124
Their beauty is a trap.

1154
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:02,390
They're a bundle of problems.

1155
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:05,331
And their useless attitude.

1156
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:07,295
Attitude.

1157
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:08,461
Attitude.

1158
01:17:08,537 --> 01:17:10,528
That attitude is fake.

1159
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:11,697
Attitude.

1160
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,865
Attitude.

1161
01:17:12,975 --> 01:17:15,273
Leave that attitude behind.

1162
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:32,518
Try your best, come on!

1163
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:40,630
Winning over a girl is an art.

1164
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,562
But it's a risky job.

1165
01:17:45,941 --> 01:17:49,206
A true lover like Majnu.

1166
01:17:50,445 --> 01:17:53,380
You will try to strangle yourself.

1167
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:58,142
Lovers shouldn't be beaten up.

1168
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,285
There should be such a law.

1169
01:18:03,525 --> 01:18:06,892
lf you don't have a boyfriend.

1170
01:18:07,863 --> 01:18:10,923
ln colleges you
shouldn't get admission.

1171
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,868
Men are mute before them.

1172
01:18:16,171 --> 01:18:19,197
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1173
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:24,043
Men are mute before them.

1174
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:28,314
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1175
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,879
Their new fashion everyday.

1176
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:34,047
Their worries about weight loss.

1177
01:18:34,122 --> 01:18:37,114
And their useless attitude.

1178
01:18:47,135 --> 01:18:50,400
When you have a girlfriend.

1179
01:18:51,473 --> 01:18:54,465
She ruins your peace and sleep.

1180
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:59,138
You start losing your hair.

1181
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:03,413
Your brain goes haywire.

1182
01:19:04,553 --> 01:19:08,887
You sit on the tracks.

1183
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:13,053
And wait for the train to arrive.

1184
01:19:13,295 --> 01:19:20,758
They turn everyone into dimwits.

1185
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:25,128
Truth is always bitter.

1186
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:29,466
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1187
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:33,779
Truth is always bitter.

1188
01:19:34,549 --> 01:19:38,417
Girls are the basic
root of sorrows.

1189
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:41,620
They cry for every small thing.

1190
01:19:41,723 --> 01:19:43,884
Secondly they make you
spend every time you meet.

1191
01:19:43,959 --> 01:19:46,985
And their useless attitude.

1192
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:48,960
Attitude.

1193
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:50,122
Attitude.

1194
01:19:50,232 --> 01:19:52,063
That attitude is fake.

1195
01:19:52,134 --> 01:19:53,192
Attitude.

1196
01:19:53,301 --> 01:19:54,359
Attitude.

1197
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:56,630
Leave that attitude behind.

1198
01:19:56,705 --> 01:19:57,797
Attitude.

1199
01:19:57,873 --> 01:19:58,965
Attitude.

1200
01:19:59,041 --> 01:20:00,702
Leave that attitude behind.

1201
01:20:00,809 --> 01:20:01,969
Attitude.

1202
01:20:02,044 --> 01:20:03,136
Attitude.

1203
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:05,577
Leave that attitude behind.

1204
01:20:05,647 --> 01:20:07,012
Attitude.

1205
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:09,682
Well done kishan.

1206
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:11,480
Kishan, les go. C'mon!

1207
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:14,946
Kishen, l've been..
- Lower your voice.

1208
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,855
Tell me about my appointments.

1209
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:20,324
Sir, first you've to meet P.T. Usha.

1210
01:20:20,896 --> 01:20:23,057
Meet her today or else
she will run away, sir.

1211
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:25,166
After that you've
to meet Saif Ali Khan.

1212
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:26,427
Saif Ali Khan.

1213
01:20:26,501 --> 01:20:28,264
Did you have a word with him
about my project? - Yes.

1214
01:20:28,336 --> 01:20:29,428
What did he say?

1215
01:20:29,504 --> 01:20:32,132
He made a tattoo
of Kishen on his arm.

1216
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:33,601
Foolish.

1217
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:35,910
After that Sachin Tendulkar,
Virender Sehwag..

1218
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,569
..and Barrack Obama
wants to meet you, sir.

1219
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,909
Tell them not this week,
we'll meet next week. Sorry.

1220
01:20:40,015 --> 01:20:42,506
Look, Kishen.. - Lower your voice.

1221
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:45,644
That's right, two days later
you'll be going on a world tour.

1222
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:48,685
Adlabs, MlDCO, lnfinity, Noida.

1223
01:20:48,757 --> 01:20:49,917
Lokhandwala Complex.

1224
01:20:49,991 --> 01:20:51,515
Of course, Lokhandwala Complex.

1225
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:52,651
Sir, if l may ask.

1226
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:56,160
ls it compulsory for
a hotel owner like you..

1227
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:58,059
..to go to the market
to buy vegetables?

1228
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:01,500
Look, no matter how
rich a person becomes..

1229
01:21:01,803 --> 01:21:03,896
..but his feet should
always be rooted to the ground.

1230
01:21:04,339 --> 01:21:06,500
What's the name of our servant?
- Bhikhu.

1231
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:08,236
Bhikhu.

1232
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:11,273
lf he isn't ready to work
for 1 1 hours, then throw him out.

1233
01:21:11,346 --> 01:21:12,745
Anyway he doesn't know cooking.

1234
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:15,514
There are other people here
who don't know how to cook at all.

1235
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:18,610
Hey, look, Kishen..
- Lower your voice.

1236
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:22,654
Yes, sir. Let's go.

1237
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:24,987
Hey, Mona.

1238
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,563
Mona.

1239
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:34,427
Are you fine?

1240
01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:37,369
C'mon! Well done.

1241
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:53,279
Driver, let's go to All lndia Radio.

1242
01:21:53,355 --> 01:21:57,086
l've left that black car for you.

1243
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:58,353
And that driver as well.

1244
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,824
Consider that car is yours now.

1245
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:03,420
Brother Bahadur,
l always believed that.

1246
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:06,592
No, no, no. you don't
have to consider it any longer.

1247
01:22:06,668 --> 01:22:09,330
That car really belongs to you now.
And the driver as well.

1248
01:22:09,437 --> 01:22:10,495
Okay.

1249
01:22:10,605 --> 01:22:11,765
Driver. - Yes, madam.

1250
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,432
Take sir to the restaurant.

1251
01:22:13,508 --> 01:22:15,271
Now your duty is with him.

1252
01:22:15,911 --> 01:22:17,879
Would you close the door, please?

1253
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:20,675
Let's go, driver.

1254
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:30,218
Come, my darling.

1255
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:32,816
The monsoon's.. - The ambience..

1256
01:22:36,364 --> 01:22:37,661
What is it?

1257
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,259
Will l have to ask what's wrong?

1258
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:42,663
Catch him.

1259
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:44,135
Help!

1260
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:49,767
Save me.

1261
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:51,874
Save me.

1262
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:05,083
Let me go.

1263
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:14,426
Brother Kishen.

1264
01:23:18,306 --> 01:23:20,274
They..

1265
01:23:58,813 --> 01:24:00,178
Pick up the knife.

1266
01:24:00,548 --> 01:24:05,349
l will.. - Lower.. your voice.

1267
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:08,117
l will do everything.

1268
01:24:09,891 --> 01:24:12,587
l will do all the work, master.

1269
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:14,918
Leave.

1270
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,500
Oh, God.

1271
01:24:24,839 --> 01:24:26,101
What is your name?

1272
01:24:28,743 --> 01:24:29,937
Kundan Lal.

1273
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:34,677
And you? - Raman Raghvan.

1274
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:38,318
Raman Raghvan.

1275
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:43,383
What do you do? - Murder.

1276
01:24:46,828 --> 01:24:49,194
What am l doing?

1277
01:24:49,264 --> 01:24:53,360
Look at the condition
of your world, Lord..

1278
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:55,494
Bhikhu, you traitor.

1279
01:24:55,837 --> 01:24:58,533
You never washed
a even a single spoon at our house..

1280
01:24:58,673 --> 01:25:00,163
..and now you're washing
this big car here.

1281
01:25:00,275 --> 01:25:02,539
Don't you see l am working?

1282
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:04,202
l don't talk when l am working.

1283
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:05,712
My master has said that.

1284
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,441
Which master?

1285
01:25:07,515 --> 01:25:08,982
Bhikhu!

1286
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:19,721
Hello sir!

1287
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:24,562
How many times have l told you..

1288
01:25:24,632 --> 01:25:28,261
..not to talk to useless
people while washing the car?

1289
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:32,102
Look, Kishen.. - Lower.. your voice.

1290
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:38,105
l want ice.
l want to make something,.

1291
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:40,613
Bunty, install a new
refrigerator in their house.

1292
01:25:40,882 --> 01:25:43,282
So that she doesn't
make excuses to come here.

1293
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:47,879
l didn't make any excuse..
- Lower.. your voice.

1294
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:53,022
l wanted to make ice-cream for you.

1295
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:54,425
That's why..

1296
01:26:05,573 --> 01:26:07,473
lce-cream, you?

1297
01:26:07,575 --> 01:26:09,270
l will learn it if you..

1298
01:26:09,344 --> 01:26:11,904
lt's not a difficult job to learn,
Ms. Mala.

1299
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:14,843
How will you make it?

1300
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:18,341
l have milk,
cream, almonds, and the mould.

1301
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,748
And the ice from you.

1302
01:26:20,355 --> 01:26:23,256
You've everything but yet..

1303
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:24,848
..you can't make the ice-cream.

1304
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:27,360
Because there's one
thing that you don't have.

1305
01:26:28,029 --> 01:26:29,428
And that's love.

1306
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:33,968
Go. And defame a
helpless man out in public.

1307
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:37,664
Snatch his money and
get something to eat..

1308
01:26:39,174 --> 01:26:40,766
You so mean kishan.

1309
01:26:41,176 --> 01:26:42,336
Get lost, Bhikhu.

1310
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:44,410
Go.

1311
01:26:44,946 --> 01:26:46,538
Fast..

1312
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:48,843
l am ruined.

1313
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:01,020
What's going on, Mala?

1314
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:03,087
Can't you see l am cooking, mother?

1315
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:04,922
That's why.

1316
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:07,797
l was wondering what is the source of this
foul stench.

1317
01:27:07,869 --> 01:27:09,200
Hello, Grandma.

1318
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:13,535
When did you keep
the cooker to boil?

1319
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:15,299
Since afternoon, why?

1320
01:27:18,847 --> 01:27:21,407
Why you..

1321
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:24,518
This stench will remain
for an entire week.

1322
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,112
You can scrape today's
dinner off the walls.

1323
01:27:28,456 --> 01:27:30,617
Let it be, Mala. Forget it.

1324
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:33,689
Make me a cup of tea,
this is not your cup of tea.

1325
01:27:33,862 --> 01:27:35,762
Go and learn something from Kishen.

1326
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:39,024
To hell with you and
your arrogant Kishen.

1327
01:27:39,467 --> 01:27:40,661
Kishen, arrogant?

1328
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:42,330
You're deceived too.

1329
01:27:43,037 --> 01:27:45,528
Kishen's clothes,
confidence and fate has changed..

1330
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:47,700
..but his heart is just as it was.

1331
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:49,769
Golden.

1332
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:51,271
lnnocent.

1333
01:27:51,913 --> 01:27:53,278
Full of love.

1334
01:27:54,282 --> 01:27:56,216
You can test it, Mala.

1335
01:28:04,959 --> 01:28:07,860
What is it? - Bhikhu, you traitor.

1336
01:28:07,962 --> 01:28:09,190
Open the door.

1337
01:28:09,697 --> 01:28:11,688
The hotel is closed
today for customers.

1338
01:28:11,766 --> 01:28:13,427
Today is Kishen sir's birthday.

1339
01:28:13,535 --> 01:28:16,197
And he's busy in one of his parties.

1340
01:28:17,505 --> 01:28:18,563
You can't go inside.

1341
01:28:18,673 --> 01:28:19,731
Bhikhu.

1342
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:21,741
Yes Sir.

1343
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,640
So, what did you see?

1344
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:36,844
Arrogant Kishen or darling Kishen?

1345
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:40,485
You will find out at night..
what l had seen.

1346
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:46,660
You're too cute, mom.

1347
01:29:47,128 --> 01:29:49,824
Bunty, what will
l find out at night?

1348
01:29:49,931 --> 01:29:51,057
Whatever you find out..

1349
01:29:51,165 --> 01:29:52,655
..but you won't give Mala
any importance, that's all.

1350
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:54,257
l will. l will.

1351
01:29:54,335 --> 01:29:55,427
Because l feel so.

1352
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:56,663
Not at all.

1353
01:29:56,938 --> 01:30:00,738
Bunty, just a little..
- Lower.. your voice.

1354
01:30:00,975 --> 01:30:03,273
Copying me!

1355
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:08,073
Hello. Hi. - Happy birthday kishan.

1356
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:11,585
After some time.

1357
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,420
Hello, how are you?

1358
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:19,089
Thank you. Thank you.

1359
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,252
Don't do this.

1360
01:30:20,328 --> 01:30:21,488
Always up, alright.

1361
01:30:21,596 --> 01:30:22,756
Okay.

1362
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:24,859
Kishen.

1363
01:30:39,681 --> 01:30:40,841
Mala. - Kishen.

1364
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:42,348
Mala. - Kishen.

1365
01:30:44,652 --> 01:30:46,882
My Malu left in anger
because of you.

1366
01:30:47,188 --> 01:30:49,418
Malu. Now she's Malu.

1367
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:51,281
She brought that
cake so affectionately.

1368
01:30:51,859 --> 01:30:53,087
Now she left in a fit of rage.

1369
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:56,819
l will have to apologize to her.
- No.

1370
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:58,463
She will say sorry.

1371
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:01,001
Don't you see she
still has her attitude?

1372
01:31:02,003 --> 01:31:04,028
l will have to bring
her under control.

1373
01:31:04,872 --> 01:31:06,669
Go, l will think
about our next step.

1374
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:08,740
Did you think of anything?

1375
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:11,736
Thought of anything?

1376
01:31:12,146 --> 01:31:14,842
Give me a minute, pops. Come on.

1377
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:24,848
lts not an easy job
to raise your parents.

1378
01:31:26,394 --> 01:31:28,191
Mala, stop.

1379
01:31:31,699 --> 01:31:33,667
What happened, Mala?
Why are you crying?

1380
01:31:36,137 --> 01:31:38,503
Mala. - Am l that bad, Mona?

1381
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,330
What happened?

1382
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:43,544
Why is he treating me tlike this?

1383
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:45,606
Why doesn't he
understand my feelings?

1384
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:49,979
Oh, God. That means Bunty..

1385
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:56,050
No, Mona,
Bunty is like a brother to me.

1386
01:31:58,593 --> 01:31:59,753
l..

1387
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:06,793
l..

1388
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:10,030
Kishen.

1389
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:33,118
Bunty, you're very cruel.

1390
01:32:33,261 --> 01:32:35,752
What are you two doing
at 2 o'clock at night?

1391
01:32:35,997 --> 01:32:38,261
Nothing, Father,
l was only cutting my birthday cake.

1392
01:32:38,332 --> 01:32:41,824
Come and taste it, come on.

1393
01:32:42,036 --> 01:32:43,230
Look.

1394
01:32:44,005 --> 01:32:45,905
l'm not giving you too much.

1395
01:32:49,177 --> 01:32:50,610
Have you mixed poison?

1396
01:32:50,978 --> 01:32:52,104
Tic 20.

1397
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:56,917
l know, Father, the recipe is wrong.

1398
01:32:57,485 --> 01:33:00,079
But there's one
thing that's in abundance.

1399
01:33:01,222 --> 01:33:03,588
Love. - Mother's love, isn't it?

1400
01:33:06,594 --> 01:33:07,856
Are you missing your mother?

1401
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:13,230
l miss Bina on such quiet nights.

1402
01:33:13,734 --> 01:33:15,099
But what can l do?

1403
01:33:15,937 --> 01:33:18,838
Son, if you give your
consent for the marriage..

1404
01:33:19,707 --> 01:33:21,868
..then this house will
be filled with happiness again.

1405
01:33:22,944 --> 01:33:25,435
Father, l am ready.

1406
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:26,672
Yes, yes.

1407
01:33:26,747 --> 01:33:30,080
l will talk to the priest
tomorrow and inquire.

1408
01:33:30,184 --> 01:33:34,553
l will surely find some
widow or divorcee.. suited for me.

1409
01:33:34,922 --> 01:33:38,187
Bina. Bina.

1410
01:33:38,893 --> 01:33:40,520
He's thinking about his marriage.

1411
01:33:40,928 --> 01:33:42,259
What a rascal?

1412
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:44,360
No, Bunty, l am the rascal.

1413
01:33:44,432 --> 01:33:46,332
l've bothered Mala enough.

1414
01:33:46,434 --> 01:33:47,662
That's all. - l know.

1415
01:33:47,768 --> 01:33:49,463
But we're doing it for her benefit.

1416
01:33:50,071 --> 01:33:52,164
But the poor girl has changed now.

1417
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,774
My Mallika is now not the same.

1418
01:33:54,876 --> 01:33:56,275
Mallika.

1419
01:33:56,511 --> 01:33:57,773
l am going.

1420
01:33:59,213 --> 01:34:02,842
Even we don't propose
to girls at 2:30 in the night.

1421
01:34:03,284 --> 01:34:04,512
Wait until morning.

1422
01:34:05,186 --> 01:34:06,710
You express your
feelings in the morning.

1423
01:34:06,787 --> 01:34:08,414
l will die until morning.

1424
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:13,358
My dreams made me cry.

1425
01:34:13,461 --> 01:34:18,922
l am waiting for the dawn.

1426
01:34:20,535 --> 01:34:21,968
Come on, come on.

1427
01:34:22,069 --> 01:34:24,003
You've got bail. Come on.

1428
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:25,766
Bail? Who was it?

1429
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,831
He's waiting outside in the car.

1430
01:34:28,075 --> 01:34:29,167
lt's some Mahesh Kumar.

1431
01:34:29,277 --> 01:34:31,438
He says that he passes
this way everyday..

1432
01:34:31,512 --> 01:34:33,343
..and hears you
singing in two voices.

1433
01:34:33,414 --> 01:34:34,438
Come on, have you finished.

1434
01:34:34,515 --> 01:34:35,573
Come on.

1435
01:34:37,852 --> 01:34:39,843
Now watch what l do?

1436
01:34:40,922 --> 01:34:42,617
Kishen will be out.

1437
01:34:43,558 --> 01:34:45,321
And Mala will be mine.

1438
01:34:49,096 --> 01:34:50,427
Why you..

1439
01:34:50,765 --> 01:34:52,027
Raghav.

1440
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:53,327
Constable.

1441
01:34:53,467 --> 01:34:54,593
Pops.

1442
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:05,808
Go, Pops, be victorious.

1443
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,472
Tell mother about your feelings.

1444
01:35:08,182 --> 01:35:09,240
Mother?

1445
01:35:09,717 --> 01:35:13,414
But l love the daughter,
not the mother.

1446
01:35:13,588 --> 01:35:15,021
What will l do with her?

1447
01:35:15,222 --> 01:35:17,690
l mean the mother
of your future children.

1448
01:35:17,758 --> 01:35:18,918
Now go. Come on, dad.

1449
01:35:19,961 --> 01:35:21,952
He was partying
with the other girls.

1450
01:35:22,597 --> 01:35:24,428
l got a cake for
him so affectionately.

1451
01:35:24,865 --> 01:35:26,093
But that Kishen..

1452
01:35:27,068 --> 01:35:29,002
Change your style, Kishen. Be cool.

1453
01:35:32,106 --> 01:35:33,164
Go on.

1454
01:35:34,008 --> 01:35:35,134
Mala.

1455
01:35:38,012 --> 01:35:39,104
You!

1456
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:45,776
What is it? - l.. l.. l.. l..

1457
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:48,750
Will you stop
stammering and speak up.

1458
01:35:48,856 --> 01:35:55,989
l came here to tell you
that the cake you made yesterday..

1459
01:35:56,063 --> 01:35:58,429
You ate it? - Yes.

1460
01:35:59,233 --> 01:36:00,291
How was it?

1461
01:36:00,401 --> 01:36:01,993
lf anyone wishes to
learn how to bake a cake..

1462
01:36:02,103 --> 01:36:04,264
..then you.. - Yes, l..

1463
01:36:04,338 --> 01:36:05,828
Then they should never
take lessons from you.

1464
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,373
Because it wasn't a cake but dung.

1465
01:36:07,475 --> 01:36:08,601
What?

1466
01:36:10,478 --> 01:36:11,604
Dung.

1467
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:12,771
Mala.

1468
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:17,509
Kundan.

1469
01:36:17,852 --> 01:36:19,114
LOng time no see?

1470
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,318
You look delighted.

1471
01:36:22,556 --> 01:36:23,580
There's good news.

1472
01:36:23,758 --> 01:36:24,850
l have found a job.

1473
01:36:24,925 --> 01:36:26,790
Guess where? - The mental asylum.

1474
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:28,087
Where?

1475
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:29,526
With Mahesh Kumar and Party.

1476
01:36:29,597 --> 01:36:30,689
As a singer.

1477
01:36:30,765 --> 01:36:32,392
Mahesh Kumar and Party!

1478
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,431
And my salary is Rs.400 a month.

1479
01:36:34,502 --> 01:36:35,799
Which party is this?

1480
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:37,337
l have never heard
about this party before.

1481
01:36:37,772 --> 01:36:39,603
Mala, just watch.

1482
01:36:39,674 --> 01:36:41,505
Kundan will soon become a star..

1483
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:43,167
..by singing in two voices.

1484
01:36:44,078 --> 01:36:45,978
Kundan, l am very happy.

1485
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:49,546
Just watch, you'll be
a famous singer. - Thank you.

1486
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:52,380
And anyway l like singers.

1487
01:36:52,953 --> 01:36:56,320
Especially those who
can sing in two voices.

1488
01:36:56,657 --> 01:36:57,817
Voice..

1489
01:37:00,394 --> 01:37:02,328
lf you can sing in two voices.

1490
01:37:04,231 --> 01:37:05,323
Then l..

1491
01:37:07,068 --> 01:37:08,467
Can sing in four voices.

1492
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:09,627
l see.

1493
01:37:10,237 --> 01:37:11,397
Want to bet?

1494
01:37:12,873 --> 01:37:13,965
Shall we have a competition?

1495
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:15,906
Dad, no. Dad.

1496
01:37:16,077 --> 01:37:17,135
Lets.

1497
01:37:17,912 --> 01:37:22,246
And Mala will garland
whoever wins. - What?

1498
01:37:22,483 --> 01:37:23,780
Mala, don't interfere.

1499
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:26,313
No, no, Dad.

1500
01:37:26,754 --> 01:37:29,120
l accept the bet. - Dad.

1501
01:37:49,343 --> 01:37:50,742
Have you lost your mind?

1502
01:37:51,312 --> 01:37:52,745
You went there to express
your feelings to Mala..

1503
01:37:52,813 --> 01:37:54,303
..and instead you
made a bet with Kundan.

1504
01:37:54,482 --> 01:37:55,540
Forget about four voices..

1505
01:37:55,649 --> 01:37:57,879
..you can't even sing
in your own voice. - l know.

1506
01:37:57,985 --> 01:37:59,043
l know!

1507
01:37:59,153 --> 01:38:00,211
l was angry with myself..

1508
01:38:00,321 --> 01:38:01,982
..because l couldn't
express my feelings to Mala.

1509
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:03,416
And when l tried to..

1510
01:38:03,491 --> 01:38:05,425
..that duet voice Kundan
Lal interfered.

1511
01:38:05,526 --> 01:38:06,686
What should l do?

1512
01:38:07,495 --> 01:38:09,725
ln a fit of rage l blurted nonsense.

1513
01:38:09,797 --> 01:38:10,889
l said it.

1514
01:38:13,134 --> 01:38:14,965
What now, Bunty? - What now.

1515
01:38:15,136 --> 01:38:17,730
You will lose the bet
and Mala will marry Kundan.

1516
01:38:18,839 --> 01:38:20,466
And only half of me will be born.

1517
01:38:21,509 --> 01:38:24,967
Lord, tonight's the
biggest night of my life.

1518
01:38:25,646 --> 01:38:30,379
Make the one l love win tonight.

1519
01:38:34,221 --> 01:38:39,352
And l want.. only Kishen to win.

1520
01:39:13,727 --> 01:39:17,720
Love is my game.

1521
01:39:17,832 --> 01:39:21,563
That's what my heart yearns for.

1522
01:39:21,635 --> 01:39:25,332
lts just you l think about.

1523
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:27,907
And l forgot the rest.

1524
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:32,805
l just want to dwell
in your thoughts.

1525
01:39:32,913 --> 01:39:36,713
l just pray to Lord.

1526
01:39:36,817 --> 01:39:40,446
l don't want to
stay away from you.

1527
01:39:40,554 --> 01:39:43,284
And l forgot the rest.

1528
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:47,386
Oh, Lord. l couldn't do anything.

1529
01:39:47,494 --> 01:39:51,157
Oh, Lord. l couldn't do anything.

1530
01:39:51,232 --> 01:39:55,566
lt's just you l remember.

1531
01:39:55,636 --> 01:39:58,434
And l forgot the rest.

1532
01:40:02,543 --> 01:40:08,140
Now see how l dance.

1533
01:40:08,716 --> 01:40:13,312
The heart beats..

1534
01:40:13,387 --> 01:40:17,824
The heart beats..

1535
01:40:17,892 --> 01:40:22,386
The heart beats,
the beats sing a song.

1536
01:40:22,496 --> 01:40:26,899
Hear what my heart sings.

1537
01:40:26,967 --> 01:40:31,802
Why don't you understand
my restlessness?

1538
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:36,400
The heart beats..

1539
01:40:36,477 --> 01:40:41,073
The heart beats..

1540
01:40:44,818 --> 01:40:49,881
l want to express
my feelings to you.

1541
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:52,481
lt's a wonderful ambience.

1542
01:40:52,559 --> 01:40:59,294
l want to make you mine..
right now.

1543
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:08,465
Your eyes enthrall me.

1544
01:41:08,575 --> 01:41:13,137
Let me dwell in
those enthralling eyes.

1545
01:41:13,247 --> 01:41:18,014
Why don't you understand
my restlessness?

1546
01:41:18,118 --> 01:41:22,748
The heart beats..

1547
01:41:40,274 --> 01:41:41,935
Hide yourself.

1548
01:41:42,009 --> 01:41:43,840
Save yourself.

1549
01:41:43,944 --> 01:41:45,605

l am wherever you are.

1552
01:41:51,085 --> 01:41:54,680
Without you,
my existence is meaningless.

1553
01:41:54,755 --> 01:41:56,188
Hide yourself.

1554
01:41:56,256 --> 01:41:58,247
Save yourself.

1555
01:41:58,359 --> 01:41:59,758

01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,725
Save yourself.

1557
01:42:01,795 --> 01:42:03,695
You're so stylish.

1558
01:42:03,764 --> 01:42:05,425
l've fallen for you.

1559
01:42:05,499 --> 01:42:09,094
Darling, you're so unique.

1560
01:42:09,169 --> 01:42:10,431

Sweetheart, come and embrace me.

Come and hide in my sights..

01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:17,433
There are desires in my heart.

1578
01:43:17,771 --> 01:43:24,335
Lets go somewhere we can be one.

1579
01:43:24,445 --> 01:43:25,844

Save yourself.

1585
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:52,639
l don't like these distances.

1586
01:43:52,706 --> 01:43:55,698
l don't like this separation.

1587
01:43:55,776 --> 01:43:58,939
l don't like when anyone
else desires, sings..

1588
01:43:59,012 --> 01:44:01,845
..touches or loves
you other than me

1589
01:44:01,915 --> 01:44:03,576
Oh baby..

1590
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:06,312
l've gone crazy.

1591
01:44:07,955 --> 01:44:09,582
Oh make me or break me or take me.

1592
01:44:09,656 --> 01:44:12,022
For you are damn crazy.

1593
01:44:13,727 --> 01:44:16,594
l have a passion for your love.

1594
01:44:16,697 --> 01:44:19,723
But you never confessed
that you love me.

1595
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:22,633
l think about you every moment.

1596
01:44:22,736 --> 01:44:26,069
l wish that you give
me possession in your heart.

1597
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:27,903
Oh baby..

1598
01:44:28,108 --> 01:44:30,838
l'm down, down crazy!

1599
01:44:33,013 --> 01:44:36,449
Oh make me or break me or take me.
For you are damn crazy.

1600
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:38,379
Kundan, watch me now.

1601
01:44:42,489 --> 01:44:46,016
Four voice.. Kishen you rock.

1602
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:03,100
Everybody..

1603
01:45:35,943 --> 01:45:37,137
Dad.

1604
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:52,652
Something's wrong.

1605
01:45:54,161 --> 01:45:56,459
l know they've cheated.

1606
01:45:56,797 --> 01:45:58,788
Otherwise that unmelodious Kishen.

1607
01:45:59,266 --> 01:46:00,392
And you, Mala.

1608
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:02,632
You were very happy
about his victory.

1609
01:46:02,936 --> 01:46:04,233
He's not suited for you.

1610
01:46:04,905 --> 01:46:07,897
You're absolutely right, Kundan.

1611
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:11,304
Kishen is no longer suited for Mala.

1612
01:46:11,645 --> 01:46:13,408
Girls don't leave him alone.

1613
01:46:13,847 --> 01:46:17,044
Rani, Priety,
Kareena, Katrina, Deepika..

1614
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:18,378
Who can l stop?

1615
01:46:18,485 --> 01:46:19,543
Tell me Kundan.

1616
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,819
Katrina writes,
My Salman, l am forever yours.

1617
01:46:24,224 --> 01:46:26,419
Bipasha writes, My John... - John?

1618
01:46:26,526 --> 01:46:29,359
Love. l am forever yours. - Great.

1619
01:46:29,463 --> 01:46:30,953
Who are they? - And Kareena.

1620
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:33,065
l can't read Kareena's letters.

1621
01:46:33,433 --> 01:46:34,730
She has written everything Saif.

1622
01:46:34,801 --> 01:46:36,962
What should l do?

1623
01:46:37,804 --> 01:46:39,465
No, don't do anything.

1624
01:46:39,806 --> 01:46:40,898
Just relax.

1625
01:46:40,974 --> 01:46:42,236
Because now Mallika Sherawat..

1626
01:46:42,309 --> 01:46:44,470
..is doing what needs
to be done at Rock n Roll club.

1627
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:01,150
Mona, don't mind.

1628
01:47:01,228 --> 01:47:04,163
But you look like a shuttlecock.
- Shut up. Come here.

1629
01:47:10,971 --> 01:47:13,667
Oh! Thank you for seducing me!

1630
01:47:19,246 --> 01:47:21,771
She is coming.. she's looking at me..

1631
01:47:24,084 --> 01:47:25,813
She's watching me?

1632
01:47:30,657 --> 01:47:32,454
What happened, Mala?
Where are you going?

1633
01:47:36,396 --> 01:47:37,454
To die.

1634
01:47:39,299 --> 01:47:41,460
Dad. - Why didn't you stop her?

1635
01:47:41,568 --> 01:47:43,763
You should've said
we were just testing her.

1636
01:47:44,771 --> 01:47:47,865
Now Malu has passed the final test.

1637
01:47:48,675 --> 01:47:51,542
Now she definitely loves
you and she's in your control.

1638
01:47:51,645 --> 01:47:53,579
Go and tell her your feelings, go.

1639
01:47:53,647 --> 01:47:55,114
Leave me first.

1640
01:47:58,185 --> 01:48:01,177
This time l don't think
we'll need seven years to meet.

1641
01:48:01,855 --> 01:48:03,948
We'll meet in a year, Kishen.

1642
01:48:04,725 --> 01:48:08,183
They found their love,
now it's our turn.

1643
01:48:09,996 --> 01:48:12,624
Look, Mona,
l'm thankful for helping me out..

1644
01:48:12,733 --> 01:48:18,330
..but l can never fill
the distance between us.

1645
01:48:18,739 --> 01:48:21,367
Wishes don't count, Bunty.

1646
01:48:22,275 --> 01:48:24,971
Either you fall
in love or you don't.

1647
01:48:25,579 --> 01:48:28,480
So, just say yes or no.

1648
01:48:33,286 --> 01:48:34,810
Do you love me?

1649
01:48:37,391 --> 01:48:38,483
No.

1650
01:48:41,495 --> 01:48:43,224
l love someone else.

1651
01:48:44,598 --> 01:48:46,498
And she's waiting for me.

1652
01:49:02,048 --> 01:49:03,140
Mala.

1653
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:04,476
Mala.

1654
01:49:04,885 --> 01:49:06,250
Mala. - What is it?

1655
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:09,020
Are you going to die? - Yes.

1656
01:49:09,656 --> 01:49:12,454
Where? - At the Chowpatty.

1657
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:14,657
But how is it possible?

1658
01:49:15,962 --> 01:49:17,486
l can drown myself in the sea.

1659
01:49:18,231 --> 01:49:19,596
But how does that concern you?

1660
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:24,828
You can go back to your Mallika..
Sherbet.

1661
01:49:27,908 --> 01:49:32,436
But, Mala. l won't leave you alone.

1662
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:37,642
What do you mean?

1663
01:49:38,819 --> 01:49:43,813
Mala, the water at
Chowpatty is cold at night.

1664
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,825
l suggest you go tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30.

1665
01:49:49,196 --> 01:49:50,527
The water will be warm then.

1666
01:49:50,931 --> 01:49:53,832
You will die easily and
won't have to suffer much.

1667
01:49:57,804 --> 01:50:01,137
Stop, Vaijanti.. Mala.

1668
01:50:04,878 --> 01:50:07,745
Before you go l want
to say just one thing.

1669
01:50:08,348 --> 01:50:09,474
Listen carefully.

1670
01:50:10,984 --> 01:50:15,148
Mala, l love you a lot.

1671
01:50:21,127 --> 01:50:22,992
lt was just a drama
planned by Bunty.

1672
01:50:23,563 --> 01:50:25,997
That girl with the wig was Mona.

1673
01:50:27,801 --> 01:50:30,235
There's no Sherbet in my life.

1674
01:50:32,405 --> 01:50:36,466
lf there's anyone in my life then..
that's you.

1675
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:44,013
My short-tempered.. big eyed.

1676
01:50:44,985 --> 01:50:48,648
We've finally fallen in love.

1677
01:50:48,722 --> 01:50:53,216
l pray no one jinxes it.

1678
01:50:53,293 --> 01:50:56,785
We've finally fallen in love.

1679
01:50:56,897 --> 01:51:01,459
l pray no one finds out about it.

1680
01:51:01,568 --> 01:51:05,060
We've finally fallen in love.

1681
01:51:05,138 --> 01:51:09,632
l pray no one jinxes it.

1682
01:51:09,743 --> 01:51:13,144
We've finally fallen in love.

1683
01:51:13,213 --> 01:51:16,876
l pray no one finds out about it.

1684
01:51:16,983 --> 01:51:23,752
l dwell in your thoughts.

1685
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:32,091
Your love has lit up my life.

1686
01:51:32,999 --> 01:51:36,696
l laugh without a reason.

1687
01:51:37,003 --> 01:51:40,871
l sway without the intoxication.

1688
01:51:41,074 --> 01:51:44,908
l flow like the current.

1689
01:51:45,178 --> 01:51:49,012
Now l am always happy.

1690
01:51:49,382 --> 01:51:56,584
l dwell in your thoughts.

1691
01:51:57,490 --> 01:52:03,861
Your love has lit up my life.

1692
01:52:06,366 --> 01:52:10,132
We've finally fallen in love.

1693
01:52:10,236 --> 01:52:14,639
l pray no one jinxes it.

1694
01:52:14,741 --> 01:52:18,233
We've finally fallen in love.

1695
01:52:18,311 --> 01:52:22,805
l pray no one finds out about it.

1696
01:52:22,882 --> 01:52:29,549
You are.. a dream.

1697
01:52:29,823 --> 01:52:34,021
You are.. a dream.

1698
01:52:39,566 --> 01:52:41,397
lf Mala can't be mine..

1699
01:52:41,701 --> 01:52:43,430
..then she can't
be yours either, Kishen.

1700
01:52:44,371 --> 01:52:45,804
Watch what l do?

1701
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:50,309
l am coming.

1702
01:53:02,355 --> 01:53:06,155
l laugh.. when you do.

1703
01:53:06,426 --> 01:53:10,123
Whenever you're sad..

1704
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:17,932
..l want to fill
you with happiness.

1705
01:53:18,605 --> 01:53:22,564
l don't know why l am mesmerised?

1706
01:53:22,742 --> 01:53:28,374
Why does everything
seem so calm and soothing?

1707
01:53:28,481 --> 01:53:34,545
Every season looks
new so do my emotions.

1708
01:53:35,088 --> 01:53:42,961
l rise like dawn
and set like dusk.

1709
01:53:43,063 --> 01:53:47,124
l smoulder like fire.

1710
01:53:47,233 --> 01:53:51,135
l walk in my sleep.

1711
01:53:51,438 --> 01:53:58,344
l dwell in your thoughts.

1712
01:53:59,512 --> 01:54:06,884
Your love has lit up my life.

1713
01:54:08,521 --> 01:54:12,150
We've finally fallen in love.

1714
01:54:12,225 --> 01:54:16,628
l pray no one jinxes it.

1715
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:20,222
We've finally fallen in love.

1716
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:24,896
l pray no one finds out about it.

1717
01:54:24,971 --> 01:54:31,706
You are.. a dream.

1718
01:54:32,045 --> 01:54:36,072
You are.. a dream.

1719
01:54:44,891 --> 01:54:46,586
Mala! Kishen!

1720
01:54:47,026 --> 01:54:48,220
Oh no.

1721
01:55:02,308 --> 01:55:04,799
Kishen! Mala! - Bunty.

1722
01:55:04,878 --> 01:55:08,439
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- But where?

1723
01:55:08,515 --> 01:55:11,746
Your marriage.
- Our marriage? So soon.

1724
01:55:11,818 --> 01:55:15,219
Bunty, we just sang
a duet song. - Yes.

1725
01:55:15,288 --> 01:55:16,482
Mala, you never told me..

1726
01:55:16,556 --> 01:55:18,387
..that your mother
is against love marriage.

1727
01:55:19,025 --> 01:55:20,583
Mother has found out about us?

1728
01:55:21,628 --> 01:55:24,096
ls my father still alive
or has her mother shot him?

1729
01:55:24,164 --> 01:55:26,098
Kundan has told them
everything about both of you.

1730
01:55:26,166 --> 01:55:29,431
Now parents are after your lives.

1731
01:55:29,502 --> 01:55:32,096
Run, come on.
- But where are we going?

1732
01:55:32,172 --> 01:55:33,662
The temple,
the auspicious hour is passing by.

1733
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:35,332
And if you don't get married now..

1734
01:55:35,408 --> 01:55:36,670
..l might never be born.

1735
01:55:36,743 --> 01:55:37,835
Come on, run.

1736
01:55:44,717 --> 01:55:46,309
Fast..

1737
01:55:46,419 --> 01:55:49,047
She is coming.. C'mon fast..

1738
01:55:49,989 --> 01:55:51,251
Stop.

1739
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:55,753
Mala stop the car otherwise
l shall kill Rai bahadur.

1740
01:55:55,829 --> 01:55:57,888
Aunt and Gabbar instead
of Jai and Veeru.

1741
01:55:58,698 --> 01:56:01,132
And behind them Thakur and Ramlal.

1742
01:56:03,336 --> 01:56:06,794
Our parents are chasing
us and you're enjoying it.

1743
01:56:06,873 --> 01:56:08,966
Eloping and
getting married has its own fun.

1744
01:56:13,947 --> 01:56:15,676
Look..

1745
01:56:16,115 --> 01:56:17,207
Bunty.

1746
01:56:17,517 --> 01:56:19,849
Bunty, stop the car.

1747
01:56:19,953 --> 01:56:21,284
This marriage isn't possible.

1748
01:56:21,521 --> 01:56:24,115
Grandma, you wanted to
get Mala married to Kishen.

1749
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:25,282
So what's wrong now?

1750
01:56:25,358 --> 01:56:27,292
Now they love each other.

1751
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,622
That's the problem.

1752
01:56:28,695 --> 01:56:30,526
l am strictly against love marriage.

1753
01:56:30,597 --> 01:56:34,089
l never let anyone have
love marriage in my neighbourhood.

1754
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,690
This is crazy.

1755
01:56:35,768 --> 01:56:39,704
Father. - Couldn't you
find anyone else to fall in love with?

1756
01:56:39,772 --> 01:56:40,932
This is their trick.

1757
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,008
So that she doesn't have
to pay rent all her life.

1758
01:56:43,076 --> 01:56:44,668
To hell with your rent.

1759
01:56:44,744 --> 01:56:47,178
l would rather die than
let this marriage take place.

1760
01:56:47,247 --> 01:56:49,807
You're going to die in 1978.

1761
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:51,710
Thank God.

1762
01:56:51,818 --> 01:56:54,685
The entire city will be rid of her.

1763
01:56:54,754 --> 01:56:56,915
No need to be so happy, grandpa.

1764
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:59,959
Because in 1979.. you too..

1765
01:57:02,095 --> 01:57:03,562
Watch out.

1766
01:57:07,133 --> 01:57:09,101
Oh no.

1767
01:57:09,168 --> 01:57:10,499
Kishen.

1768
01:57:10,603 --> 01:57:11,968
Bunty, stop the car.

1769
01:57:12,071 --> 01:57:14,301
Kishen, if l stop the car
then we'll be lying on the bier.

1770
01:57:14,407 --> 01:57:15,465
No, Bunty.

1771
01:57:15,575 --> 01:57:18,510
We can't base our
dreams on someone's corpse. - Yes.

1772
01:57:18,578 --> 01:57:20,637
Then l am ready to take
full responsibility, Kishen.

1773
01:57:20,713 --> 01:57:23,648
Just slide it down respectfully.

1774
01:57:23,716 --> 01:57:25,616
They will pick it up, okay.

1775
01:57:25,718 --> 01:57:26,878
Sorry.. sorry - Kishen.

1776
01:57:26,953 --> 01:57:29,615
Bravo, throw down
the corpse and the girl.

1777
01:57:29,756 --> 01:57:31,018
May his soul.. - Rest in peace.

1778
01:57:31,124 --> 01:57:32,182
May his soul.. - Rest in peace.

1779
01:57:32,258 --> 01:57:33,555
Kishen is looking so good.

1780
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:36,026
l wish Rai Bahadur
was lying on that bier.

1781
01:57:36,095 --> 01:57:39,087
Look, uncle, your son is
shouldering someone else's bier.

1782
01:57:39,532 --> 01:57:41,090
Shut up and drive.

1783
01:57:45,571 --> 01:57:48,335
Oh no.. - Bunty watch it.

1784
01:57:50,376 --> 01:57:51,934
Bunty..

1785
01:58:20,006 --> 01:58:23,100
Grandma.. Oh no.. no.. no..

1786
01:58:25,144 --> 01:58:26,236
Let's go. Mala.

1787
01:58:26,412 --> 01:58:28,175
Aunt, that's my hand. - Shut up.

1788
01:58:29,449 --> 01:58:31,974
Love marriage isn't possible,
that's it.

1789
01:58:32,919 --> 01:58:34,045
Mother.

1790
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:35,417
Kishen. - Mala.

1791
01:58:35,488 --> 01:58:37,718
Kishen. - Mala. Mala. Mala.

1792
01:58:37,991 --> 01:58:40,755
Kishen, do something now.

1793
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,293
Come on.

1794
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:46,421
Kishen, this is your last chance.
- l.. l..

1795
01:58:46,499 --> 01:58:47,898
Be a man and fight, Kishen.

1796
01:58:48,001 --> 01:58:49,525
He can't be a man.

1797
01:58:51,337 --> 01:58:52,827
He's a fool. Just a fool.

1798
01:58:54,207 --> 01:58:55,674
And the proof is that..

1799
01:58:55,742 --> 01:58:58,734
..he loves a girl who
is a shame to womankind.

1800
01:59:00,113 --> 01:59:01,239
Come on, dad.

1801
01:59:01,381 --> 01:59:03,872
lt's a goon hiding under
the clothes of a woman.

1802
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:06,248
Kundan, what are you.. - Quiet.

1803
01:59:07,387 --> 01:59:08,877
No one will say anything.

1804
01:59:15,595 --> 01:59:19,258
This girl is just as soft
from inside as strong she looks.

1805
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:21,032
She loved me earlier.

1806
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:24,795
But now she loves Kishen
just because he's rich now.

1807
01:59:26,005 --> 01:59:28,269
Who will marry a
characterless woman like..

1808
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:40,586
l would've slapped you
even if Mala didn't love me.

1809
01:59:42,622 --> 01:59:44,089
What kind of a man are you?

1810
01:59:44,223 --> 01:59:45,747
You claim to love a girl..

1811
01:59:45,858 --> 01:59:48,190
..and now you talk nonsense
about her when she refuses you.

1812
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:54,324
l feel like taking your shirt
off and making you dance here.

1813
02:00:00,406 --> 02:00:03,432
Mala. Come here.

1814
02:00:04,577 --> 02:00:06,044
Apologise to Mala.

1815
02:00:06,412 --> 02:00:08,573
Say sorry or else l
will thrash you so badly..

1816
02:00:08,681 --> 02:00:11,582
..that the doctor will say Sorry,
your son is dead.

1817
02:00:11,684 --> 02:00:12,742
Say sorry.

1818
02:00:14,253 --> 02:00:15,345
Sorry, Mala.

1819
02:00:15,421 --> 02:00:17,355
Not Mala, say Sorry, sister.

1820
02:00:17,423 --> 02:00:18,651
Sorry, sister.

1821
02:00:20,626 --> 02:00:21,684
Say it!

1822
02:00:22,261 --> 02:00:25,753
Sorry, Sister. - lts okay, brother.

1823
02:00:26,599 --> 02:00:27,657
Thank you.

1824
02:00:28,167 --> 02:00:30,101
And you two, senior citizens.

1825
02:00:30,169 --> 02:00:31,431
Your punishment is that..

1826
02:00:31,504 --> 02:00:33,631
..you two have to live
together like kin, get that.

1827
02:00:33,739 --> 02:00:37,140
Never! - Lower your voice.

1828
02:00:39,145 --> 02:00:42,342
She's my mummy. - Fine.

1829
02:00:43,316 --> 02:00:44,374
So, Aunt.

1830
02:00:45,485 --> 02:00:49,216
Mala and l didn't get married,
have only fallen in love.

1831
02:00:49,489 --> 02:00:50,717
You get us married.

1832
02:00:50,890 --> 02:00:52,619
So your problem of marriage
will be solved as well.

1833
02:00:53,493 --> 02:00:56,462
l.. was saying that. - Good.

1834
02:00:56,562 --> 02:00:58,154
l am not ready for the marriage.

1835
02:00:58,264 --> 02:01:01,097
You shouldn't get married
at this age, either.

1836
02:01:01,467 --> 02:01:02,559
Get that!

1837
02:01:03,002 --> 02:01:04,162
We are getting married.

1838
02:01:05,371 --> 02:01:06,998
You can say anything
you want right now.

1839
02:01:07,106 --> 02:01:10,337
You fool.. - Lower your voice.

1840
02:01:11,477 --> 02:01:13,342
We're going for our
honeymoon after the marriage.

1841
02:01:13,646 --> 02:01:17,173
Where? - Lokhandwala Complex.

1842
02:01:22,088 --> 02:01:23,715
Bunty, you're just amazing.

1843
02:01:24,056 --> 02:01:25,455
l am getting married because of you.

1844
02:01:25,625 --> 02:01:27,058
And you won't attend my marriage.

1845
02:01:27,126 --> 02:01:28,218
That's not right.

1846
02:01:28,294 --> 02:01:30,387
lts not right for me to
stay for your marriage, Kishen.

1847
02:01:30,863 --> 02:01:32,296
l should leave before
your nuptial night..

1848
02:01:32,398 --> 02:01:34,389
..or else there'll
be a chance of a double role.

1849
02:01:36,169 --> 02:01:37,227
You will come back, won't you?

1850
02:01:37,904 --> 02:01:40,395
l will, of course l will.

1851
02:01:41,073 --> 02:01:42,301
And this time l will come sooner.

1852
02:01:43,042 --> 02:01:46,011
By losing some weight,
weighing only seven pounds.

1853
02:01:46,646 --> 02:01:47,874
You will understand when you see it.

1854
02:01:48,548 --> 02:01:51,210
No one ever understands what you..

1855
02:01:51,317 --> 02:01:52,409
What are you doing?

1856
02:01:58,558 --> 02:02:01,118
l am going to miss you.
- l am going to miss you.

1857
02:02:02,595 --> 02:02:05,291
Here, Bunty. l made it myself.

1858
02:02:05,898 --> 02:02:07,058
Really.

1859
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,394
You made it yourself.

1860
02:02:09,468 --> 02:02:10,628
For your journey.

1861
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:12,269
Don't eat outside.

1862
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:14,131
No.

1863
02:02:14,974 --> 02:02:16,032
l love you..

1864
02:02:17,276 --> 02:02:18,538
Mom..

1865
02:02:22,048 --> 02:02:23,640
Bless you.

1866
02:02:25,451 --> 02:02:27,043
l will miss you, son.

1867
02:02:27,253 --> 02:02:29,983
Me too, grandpa. Me too.

1868
02:02:46,439 --> 02:02:47,838
Bless you.

1869
02:02:49,242 --> 02:02:52,268
Who will praise me now?

1870
02:02:53,379 --> 02:02:56,007
My most beautiful grandma.

1871
02:03:02,054 --> 02:03:05,649
lf you can't make
it then call us there.

1872
02:03:06,692 --> 02:03:08,250
l wish l could do that, grandma.

1873
02:03:09,795 --> 02:03:11,057
l wish l could do that.

1874
02:03:14,967 --> 02:03:16,161
Bless you.

1875
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:25,704
Goodbye.

1876
02:03:26,946 --> 02:03:28,174
Go.

1877
02:04:13,726 --> 02:04:15,591
The time machine brought me..

1878
02:04:15,661 --> 02:04:17,754
..to the same party from
where l'd gone in 1975.

1879
02:04:18,097 --> 02:04:20,258
l hope, everything changes.

1880
02:04:22,068 --> 02:04:25,970
Bhikhu. How do you
work so much for Kishen?

1881
02:04:27,206 --> 02:04:29,174
Won't he throw me out
of the house if l don't?

1882
02:04:33,979 --> 02:04:35,310
lt's a jolly party.

1883
02:04:35,381 --> 02:04:37,042
Let's have a duet song.

1884
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:39,914
You know l never sang
after losing to you.

1885
02:04:40,019 --> 02:04:41,577
You're getting serious.

1886
02:04:41,721 --> 02:04:43,689
Wow, dad. Well done.

1887
02:04:43,789 --> 02:04:45,120
Listen.

1888
02:04:45,224 --> 02:04:47,556
Go. Your wife is calling you.

1889
02:04:50,663 --> 02:04:52,460
He's my husband, Kundan lal.

1890
02:04:54,166 --> 02:04:56,361
He's the manager of Shreya
Bank's Nalasopara branch.

1891
02:04:56,469 --> 02:04:59,131
And they are Mr.
and Mrs. Khurana. - Hello.

1892
02:04:59,538 --> 02:05:00,630
Mom.

1893
02:05:05,911 --> 02:05:08,709
lf l had known you
will take so long..

1894
02:05:08,781 --> 02:05:12,842
..then l would've
giftes you a miniskirt.

1895
02:05:14,286 --> 02:05:17,778
lf l had known that
you're so restless..

1896
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:19,723
..l wouldn't have come down.

1897
02:05:20,893 --> 02:05:25,694
l would've called you upstairs.
- Then you should have.

1898
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:29,534
By the way, guys, take it easy.

1899
02:05:29,869 --> 02:05:30,961
Relax.

1900
02:05:31,036 --> 02:05:32,526
Where were you?

1901
02:05:32,638 --> 02:05:34,970
l was around. - Around.

1902
02:05:36,142 --> 02:05:39,976
l suggest that you
handle the party here.

1903
02:05:40,045 --> 02:05:43,037
And l will take your mother
to the private party, yacht party.

1904
02:05:43,115 --> 02:05:44,207
Understand.

1905
02:05:44,283 --> 02:05:46,945
Hey listen, listen..
- Lower.. your voice.

1906
02:05:47,052 --> 02:05:49,213
Okay then.

1907
02:05:49,288 --> 02:05:50,949
Let's go, wife. - Let's go.

1908
02:05:51,056 --> 02:05:52,114
Come on.

1909
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,622
Professor.

1910
02:05:59,298 --> 02:06:01,960
Professor, can l borrow
her for a second? - Sure?

1911
02:06:02,034 --> 02:06:03,296
You will handle the party?
- Of course.

1912
02:06:03,369 --> 02:06:04,461
Thank you, Professor.

1913
02:06:04,537 --> 02:06:05,629
Have fun. - Come on.

1914
02:06:05,704 --> 02:06:06,796
Bye. - Bye.

1915
02:06:07,072 --> 02:06:08,801
Bunty, stop.

1916
02:06:09,475 --> 02:06:10,533
What?

1917
02:06:10,643 --> 02:06:14,977
Tanya. Will you marry me?

1918
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:20,412
Are you serious? - Very serious.

1919
02:06:22,121 --> 02:06:23,452
Of course.

1920
02:06:30,629 --> 02:06:32,187
l love you, Bunty.
