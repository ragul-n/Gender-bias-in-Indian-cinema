1
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,115
Bye, Mom. I'm off to college.
- Son, come here, will you?

2
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:45,061
What is it?
- Choose a girl from these.

3
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,138
They' re all nice.
- True.

4
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,746
But you can wed just one.

5
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,674
- Wed?
- Yes, Wed!

6
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,045
And I want no excuses either!

7
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,415
Being unemployed was your excuse
earlier. But now, you have a job.

8
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:19,153
But it's not permanent yet.
- So what? We' re quite well off.

9
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,823
Look, I've vowed to remain
a bachelor till l' m 25 years old.

10
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,163
But...
- l' ll marry at 25!

11
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,771
- But...
- It's 10 O' clock!

12
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,442
I've heard everything,
now let me go to the college.

13
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:45,847
He always avoids the issue.
I don't understand it.

14
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,864
Hello. All's well, I hope?
- Yes.

15
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,194
Bless you, my boy.

16
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,199
Madam...
- Who is it? Come on in.

17
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,485
It's me. Good day, madam.
- Please be seated, sir.

18
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:23,223
Well, what did your son say?
I' m sure he agreed.

19
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,765
The girl's a gem. Whoever sees her
will always approve of her.

20
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,165
A rare one.
One in a thousand, I tell you!

21
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:39,840
Yes, the girl is nice, but...
he doesn't wish to marry as yet.

22
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,082
Take your photograph.
- I wasn't forcing the issue.

23
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,517
I got this because you asked me to.
Plenty of fish in the sea however.

24
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:06,264
What a fusspot!
Thinks her son is a Magistrate!

25
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,909
Doesn't like any of the girls!
I approached out of respect.

26
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:15,275
What's the matter?
- That Mohan's mother...

27
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:20,450
She has her head in the sky!
She rejected this girl!

28
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:29,294
What a dish! If I wasn't already
married, I'd wed her myself.

29
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,963
Watch it, you!
She's my daughter, you see.

30
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,294
Sorry! She's a nice girl.
But why did Rohan refuse?

31
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:44,909
He's a professor now!
Dime a dozen, I tell you!

32
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,974
So! I was telling you
about the great poet Shudrak.

33
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:59,849
Like I said before, Shudrak
was a great Sanskrit poet.

34
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,588
His " Vasantasena" is a very
famous Sanskrit play.

35
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:11,269
But before I begin, I'd like to
explain something about it...

36
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:17,170
so that you can understand
its background atmosphere, etc.

37
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:24,340
In this play, the author has used love
to depict politics at its worst.

38
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:29,620
The hero is Charudatta and
the heroine, Vasantasena.

39
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:36,687
Charudatta was a noble man, and,
Vasantasena was a prostitute.

40
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:43,097
She falls in love with his
good looks and goodness.

41
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,232
Yes?

42
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,372
She was a prostitute?
- Yes, she was.

43
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,636
And he, a nobleman?
- Yes.

44
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,310
Did he love her too?

45
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:01,884
The play says he loved her, yes.
- Can a decent, man love too?

46
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,982
Then? Do only fools
have the right to love?

47
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:10,386
I meant, can a noble man
fall in love with a prostitute?

48
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,361
That's what the poet has
written in his play.

49
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:19,064
Will you call such a man
noble or foolish?

50
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,733
Foolish!

51
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,569
Is a prostitute capable of love?

52
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:30,341
The poet has described the love
of Vasantasena as ideal.

53
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,616
He has shown it as a love
of an ideal woman.

54
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,419
We want your opinion.
- I think whores are social stigmas.

55
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:45,258
They' re sinful. They love, not
the man, but his assets and money.

56
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,433
I hope, instead of giving importance
to the romance in this play...

57
00:07:54,674 --> 00:08:05,983
... you concentrate on the poet's
language and style.

58
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:33,345
Mom! Didn't the maid come?
Why are you sweeping?

59
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,478
She has fever.
- Then let me...

60
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,415
No! your clothes will get dirty.

61
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,491
If you' re so concerned about me,
why don't you marry, son?

62
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,487
She' ll help me in all this.

63
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,754
I' ll be the daughter-in-law for now.

64
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,392
Dear Lord, you've fulfilled
all my wishes till now.

65
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,935
Now fulfill this one wish too.
Get my son married.

66
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:51,546
I wish to see his wife,
before I die. Hear my prayers.

67
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:45,465
What's this? You had fever last
night. And you' re up for the Puja?

68
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,937
Then who else will do it?
Take the Lord's blessings, son.

69
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,609
You' re too much!
Your fever mustn't increase.

70
00:11:55,514 --> 00:12:00,008
If you' re so worried,
listen to me.

71
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,683
You' re an educated adult now.
With a good job too. Get married.

72
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,952
My only wish now,
is to see your wife.

73
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,300
And you will too!
Just let me be 25, and l' ll marry.

74
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,373
That's still 2 years away, son.
Will I still be alive then?

75
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,905
You' ll live to be a hundred!
- Old leaves are not trustworthy.

76
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:32,248
That's because they hang on
trees. Mother's different.

77
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:36,717
Come, l' ll see you downstairs.
- Let it be. I' ll go on my own.

78
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,924
You always make a joke out of it.

79
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,625
She' ll come around soon.

80
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,305
Nothing to fear, I hope.
- Old age itself is a fear, son.

81
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,784
She has hurt her waist, and she's
weak. She needs good rest.

82
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,649
Get the medicines called.

83
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,060
I heard she fell down the stairs.
What did the doctor say?

84
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,666
He said it's nothing serious,
and she' ll get well soon.

85
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:07,271
Do me a favour. Get me these
medicines. Here's the money.

86
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,815
The prescription!
And hurry back.

87
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,165
Drat it! He had to call me!
Why did you call me from behind?

88
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,841
If l' m not to do that, and you won't
see me face to face, what do I do?

89
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,839
If you don't want me to call
you from behind, pay up!

90
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,380
I spent your money, on groceries.
I didn't blow it! I' ll pay later on.

91
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:52,354
You have 2 watches on you.
- Don't touch! They tell the time.

92
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:58,519
Isn't one watch enough for that?
- Two watches show 2 times.

93
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,389
Good times and bad times.

94
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,468
They think that your bad times
are here! Eh? Hoodwinked again?

95
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,337
Satisfied? That's why,
it's a said, insult a gentleman.

96
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:17,812
May I take ration on credit?
- You' re so lovely! Get lost!

97
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,883
Credit, my foot!
Nothing but trouble.

98
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,906
No use hiding your face.
- I am always discreet.

99
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,735
Else I too know how to shameless.
Anyway what can I do for you?

100
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,574
Do? Give me my rent.

101
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,182
Look, I had to leave
many houses for this.

102
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,913
I don't have any money.
- Then vacate my house.

103
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:05,186
You owe me 1/2 a year's rent.
- Then let's make it 1 year!

104
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,933
Then l' ll either pay or vacate.
- You dare tease me like this?

105
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:16,206
Wonderful! You' re a girl aren't
you, for me to tease you?

106
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,935
I' ll pay you tomorrow.
- You'd better!

107
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:23,203
Or l' ll throw your things out!

108
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,209
If you find any!
...Mad!

109
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:36,289
I knew you'd do that, wrestler.
- I know that. Get me my money.

110
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:43,959
It's in my safe, at home.
- That's an old story. Pay up! Else...

111
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,964
Else?
- l' ll kill you!

112
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,908
And the rest?
- Tomorrow.

113
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,977
Sure?
- Of course, calm down.

114
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:03,246
How about an embrace?
This give and take goes on in life.

115
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,648
You not only have brawn,
but a brain to match too.

116
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,657
Don't forget tomorrow morning.
- Of course not.

117
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,461
This tener is my commission.

118
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,272
Woe be me...
- What is it?

119
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,676
My pocket was picked!

120
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,350
I've lost the money.
Give me a tener for the medicines.

121
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:39,751
I' ll get the medicine when I go to
the college. Sit with mother now.

122
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,688
Okay, l' ll serve her
in this way at least.

123
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,209
Aunty! Eat this.
You' ll get your strength back.

124
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,958
Aunty, it's me, Jeevan.
- Where's my son?

125
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,104
He's gone to get the medicines.
He' ll be here soon.

126
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,120
Get the doctor.

127
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:33,991
A daughter-in-law...
Get me a daughter-in-law.

128
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,343
Carry on with the medicines
God willing, she' ll live.

129
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,890
She's obsessed about a
daughter-in-law.

130
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:22,843
Give her the Holy Water, son.
- Yes, must do the religious rites.

131
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,641
A daughter-in-law...

132
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,257
Until she sees her son's wife,
she won't even die.

133
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:41,593
Even if she dies, her spirit
will always roam here.

134
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,403
Had she seen her son's wife.
She'd have died happily.

135
00:21:54,413 --> 00:22:03,412
Don't give up, son.
- Let me know if you need me.

136
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:13,959
Serve her well till her
last breath, son.

137
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:21,633
She was very nice.
- Her son has really hurt her.

138
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:40,257
A daughter-in-law...
Get me a daughter-in-law, son.

139
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:54,599
Get me a daughter-in-law?
- From where?

140
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,806
One can't buy one.

141
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:04,941
But she' ll go on pining for her.
- What can I do about it?

142
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,008
You' re right.
What can you do?

143
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,220
Mohan, there's one thing.
Come here.

144
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:22,357
There's a girl I know, who can
be presented as your wife to her.

145
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:27,502
It's a question of a few days...
- I don't know. You decide.

146
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:32,310
Her father will talk
of money no doubt...

147
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,035
That's no problem.

148
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,648
My mother must be at peace.
- True. Anyway l' ll go and try.

149
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,703
"Tell me, what all will you..."

150
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,306
" Listen, what all will you..."

151
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:47,984
"Tell me, what will you buy?
Listen, what will you buy?"

152
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,718
" Everything here is up for sale"

153
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:58,125
"So tell me what will you buy?
Listen, what do you wish to buy?"

154
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:06,131
" You sir, you, and you too...
What do you wish to buy?"

155
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:45,833
"These naughty curls,
or, these swaying arms?"

156
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:57,512
"The mischief on these lips,
or the magic in these eyes?"

157
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:04,020
" A mine of sensuality, or,
the youthful songs..."

158
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:15,366
"Or even these joyous times.
Tell me what will you all buy?"

159
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:28,212
" Each and every thing here is sold.
So, what will you buy, tell me"

160
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:57,915
"Shall I surrender these
youthful passions"

161
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:04,582
" If you ask for a bud,
I shall give you the whole garden"

162
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,411
"These rays of intoxication.
And aromas of darkness..."

163
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:39,751
" And these colourful nights...
Tell me, what will you buy, sir?"

164
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:27,336
" I sell love, and,
I sell decency too"

165
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:39,410
"Go away, if you' re prudish;
for I sell my modesty..."

166
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,686
"Just look into my eyes.
Don't put on airs"

167
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,221
" Look into my eyes, I say.
And don't show off"

168
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:57,232
" Don't be so shy either.
So, what will you buy, tell me"

169
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:32,394
Wonderful! What a performance.

170
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,404
Wonderful, Madame.
May God keep you.

171
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,273
No dearth in buyers either!

172
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,354
My respects, sir.
- Welcome, sir. Sit down.

173
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:03,033
Shall I inform the l.T. Dept?
- We look to the earnings...

174
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,169
... not the expenditure.

175
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,640
I had some work with you.
- Yes?

176
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,043
There's an old woman
who neither lives, nor dies.

177
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,975
So? Show her to a hakim.

178
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,316
Her death potion is in
your hands, sir.

179
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,386
Meaning?
- Send Champa at her place.

180
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,581
She wishes to hear music.
- Something like that.

181
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,316
Must be young at heart.

182
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:33,328
People like to take the Lord's name.
This one wants music!

183
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,123
What's the matter?

184
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,468
People like to hear you
sing for pleasure.

185
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:45,335
But there's this old woman
who wants your song to die.

186
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,809
No, it's not like that.
The fact is that woman...

187
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:52,640
... wishes to see her
son's wife before dying.

188
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:57,345
You have to play her daughter-in-law.
I' m mean, act as one for some days.

189
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,481
I' ll pay Rs. 25/-
- I don't leave the house.

190
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,829
I' ll pay you Rs. 50/-
- l' m so tired.

191
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,361
Rs. 75/- then.

192
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:11,501
I told you l' m not well.
- Don't push your luck!

193
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,833
Rs. 100/- and that's final;
Else l' ll go elsewhere! Sir?

194
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:22,173
Say yes, my dear. It' ll be a
new experience. She' ll come.

195
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,850
Go on, dear. Get ready to go.
- Okay. I' ll go.

196
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:34,857
And listen Rs. 25/- will be mine!
- Make it Rs. 1 25/- and take it.

197
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,458
Okay, the hell with that!
Now get ready.

198
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,133
A daughter-in-law, remember!

199
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,366
That's her.
- Much obliged.

200
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,560
Forget it. How's your mother?

201
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,445
Aunty!
- She's unconscious.

202
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,918
Aunty, your daughter-in-law's here.

203
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,454
Is she really here?
- Yes! Look, there she is.

204
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,444
She's paying her respects.

205
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:14,617
Bless you my dear.
Son, stand next to her please.

206
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,488
Let me see you both together
to my heart's content.

207
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,741
May God keep you both.

208
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,323
Could you, please?

209
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,508
Now Aunty will die peacefully.

210
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,872
How much?
- Rs.200/-.

211
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:21,015
There's a limit after all.
Rs.200/- for such a small errand?

212
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:49,045
Water! Please give me
some water, dear.

213
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,716
Go on.

214
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,328
Water...

215
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:23,414
Bless you, what is your name?
- Rajani, her name's Rajani.

216
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,587
Right then. We' ll go now.
Come on, Rajani.

217
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,382
Back already, my dear?
- The hell you sent me to!

218
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,786
He was very adamant.
Well Jeevan? Did she die?

219
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:07,656
Not yet, but she will.
Why bother?

220
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,466
We had to fool them for
our own gain. And we did it!

221
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,397
The mother and son are a
pair of idiots, I tell you.

222
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:21,070
After seeing me, the old hag said
" Be happy my dear".

223
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:29,677
"Son, stand next to her.
Let me see you both together"!

224
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,825
And that idiot...
Wonder who made him a professor.

225
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:40,161
He was so scared to stand near me,
as though I was fire!

226
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:44,698
No doubt about that, dear.
I can feel the heat right here!

227
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,470
I totally forgot.
- Never mind.

228
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,183
I' ll go now.
- Righto.

229
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:22,870
Take your medicine, Mom.
- Your wife was here last night.

230
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:35,011
I couldn't see her properly though.
Go and call her, son.

231
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,723
My wife?
- Yes.

232
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,230
If you liked this girl,
why didn't you tell me?

233
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,094
I'd have got you married to her.
Go and call her now.

234
00:37:55,172 --> 00:38:01,008
I don't have much time now.
I want to talk to her.

235
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,080
Have your dose at least.
- No. Call your wife first.

236
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:14,924
But how can I leave you alone?
- I won't die so soon. Call her.

237
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:39,113
Where did you get the cash from?
- Started a new business.

238
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,115
Now pay off all the debts.

239
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,288
What debts?
- Borrowed money.

240
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:51,393
Give and take is part of life.
Now go and do your work.

241
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:58,330
No! First return the money.
You go out, but I've to face them.

242
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,300
Who can it be so early?
- Someone you've borrowed from!

243
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:09,875
Tell him l' m out.
- What if he asks when you' ll return?

244
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,141
Tell him in 2 months time.
- That l' m jailed for 3 months.

245
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:18,650
Nonsense!
- Now go and tell him.

246
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,914
Go and tell yourself.
Don't involve me in this.

247
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,731
Oh? Do you think I need you?
I' ll manage it myself.

248
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,873
Who is it?
- It's me, Pehelwan.

249
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,077
Well?
- I wish to fight him.

250
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,780
He's hardly your size.
- l' ll kill him!

251
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,021
What! You' ll kill my man?
Get lost, I say!

252
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,190
He said the money was in the safe
and I was to come and get it.

253
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,191
It's been a week now.
Enough is enough.

254
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,025
Tell him if he doesn't pay me
today, l' ll beat him to a pulp!

255
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,166
Okay, l' ll tell him.

256
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,914
Who is it?
- It's your landlord.

257
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:25,052
We don't want anything.
- l' m here to collect the rent!

258
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,655
He's out!
- He's always out.

259
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,224
Is he ever in the house?
Tell him I was here.

260
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,791
Okay.

261
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,933
Who's this now?
- He's not in.

262
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,904
When will he come?
- Don't know.

263
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,275
Tell him Mohan had come.
- If it's Mohan, l' m at home!

264
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,687
Sorry. I thought somebody was
wanting money for charity.

265
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:02,687
I' m fed up with them!
They' re always asking for money.

266
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,429
As if l' m an industrialist!
Anyway, come in.

267
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,702
Get some tea for Mohan, my dear.
- No thanks. I don't take tea.

268
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:23,105
Forget it then my dear.
- Shall I get some milk then?

269
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,611
Didn't I say he doesn't drink
anything? She will go on and on...

270
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,922
How's Aunty?
- Much better.

271
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,249
Better? Thank God!

272
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:40,931
She remembers that Rajani.
Get her now if you can.

273
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,063
Now? No. She can't come now.

274
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,862
Who's Rajani?
- My uncle's niece.

275
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,730
Your uncle's niece?

276
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,407
No, your uncle's niece.
- What?

277
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,741
She's totally mad. She' ll ask
what I want to hide from her!

278
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,745
Karamchand's daughter.

279
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,648
Is he your uncle?
- No, my foe!

280
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,153
A distant relation, you see.
- But his daughter is Rajoo.

281
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:15,660
And you are a fool! Her pet name
is Rajoo. She's actually Rajani.

282
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:20,029
Now go do your work. She can't
come now. She's a young girl.

283
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,771
I had brought her last night
with great difficulty.

284
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:27,908
Why had you brought her?
- For God's sake! Go do your work!

285
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,908
I' ll tell you later. A bad habit!
Very inquisitive nature.

286
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:40,190
Bring her. For Mom's sake.
- Sure. But more money.

287
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,525
Her father's damn greedy.

288
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,519
No problem.
- Fine then.

289
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,523
Tell Aunty her daughter-in-law
will come tonight.

290
00:42:51,835 --> 00:43:05,476
"The sensuality that I possess,
is not found in everyone"

291
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:20,692
" Love may be found in all,
But loyalty, only in few"

292
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:27,035
" It's not good to go
to such places"

293
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:35,238
" Be careful, dear man,
the times die bad"

294
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,012
"To fall in love
is not good"

295
00:43:54,131 --> 00:44:02,004
" Flowing tresses can
become shackles too"

296
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:11,610
"The eyes that appear shy,
can become arrows too"

297
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:19,815
" It's men who fall in love"

298
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:27,359
"They fall prey to the
wicked charms"

299
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:34,527
"This is that place where
love is given freely"

300
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,609
" And the heart?
It's given away every time"

301
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,853
"That's why I say,..."

302
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:56,649
" It's bad to go to a place
of ill repute"

303
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:04,500
" Be careful, dear man,
the times are bad"

304
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,674
" It's bad to fall in love too"

305
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:14,942
" It's not good to go
to house of ill-repute"

306
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:33,952
" If I smile at everyone,
they think l' m drunk"

307
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:43,704
" And if I stare at them,
they think me mad"

308
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:52,114
" If someone gets lost in songs
or instrumental music..."

309
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:59,121
" And who is saved from this too,
get's lost in dance"

310
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:05,725
"They' re very fast to put
their arms around the necks"

311
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:15,804
"Their eyes are after money
and not anyone's heart"

312
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,740
"That's why I say..."

313
00:46:54,878 --> 00:47:03,149
"They inflict atrocities;
they give you agony"

314
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:12,729
"They steal our hearts,
and give us heart-ache"

315
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:21,132
" If you want pain,
come to me"

316
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:28,410
" Else, off with you.
Go find some other place"

317
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,113
" Even if you go away today,
you' ll return tomorrow night"

318
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:45,090
" You won't find another like me
in the whole world"

319
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,828
"That's why I say..."

320
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:44,085
Come on in.
- Jeevan is here, my dear.

321
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:50,385
Tell him I won't go today.
- Why?

322
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:53,888
Who' ll go to that sickly hag?
- Who's bothered with her?

323
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:58,566
Our aim is money. Isn't Rs.100/-
for a few hours, worth it?

324
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:05,569
I' ll take Rs.200/- this time.
- This daily hike in price won't do.

325
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:13,847
Make it Rs.1 50/-. Now go, my dear.
- Hurry up. She must be waiting.

326
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:30,161
What time is it?
- It's midnight.

327
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:36,429
You said your wife would be here.

328
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,944
She got held up at a religious
ceremony. Very religious minded.

329
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:54,481
Bless you, dear.
I was waiting for you so eagerly.

330
00:49:55,258 --> 00:50:00,093
The sermon took a long time
and father also came late.

331
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:05,729
Come here.
- Go, sit near her.

332
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,503
Being well-bred, she's very shy.

333
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:16,574
Sit down. This is your chance
to be blessed by Aunty here.

334
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,917
Sit near me, my dear.
Go on, sit.

335
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:35,192
She's so innocent and beautiful.
You' re feeling shy too now, eh?

336
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:45,466
My days are numbered; you' ll
have to take charge here now.

337
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:52,413
I've called you here to tell you
about whatever possessions I have.

338
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:57,149
But is this all necessary?
- It is, son. Very necessary.

339
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:02,951
This house is worth Rs.25,000/-.

340
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:08,559
1 5,000/- in insurance.
1 2,000/- cash.

341
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,696
And ornaments worth Rs.10,000/-.

342
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,598
Stop blabbering. Mom.
- Shut up!

343
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:24,573
Your father had made them, but
he died without seeing your wife.

344
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:33,319
Take these keys, son.
Show her the ornaments.

345
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:41,930
See if the bangles fit her.
- We' ll do this after you get well.

346
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:52,138
Don't argue now. I don't have
the will, nor the energy for it.

347
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:59,414
You' re a good boy.
Show her the ornaments.

348
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:06,614
Go my dear.

349
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,960
You?
- Your mom sent me.

350
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,437
She thinks you' re really my wife.

351
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:29,438
But I haven't forgotten that l' m
hired. I' m actually cheating her.

352
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:36,977
No. I' m cheating her.
And you too of course.

353
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:43,286
You have obliged me in fact, else
I wouldn't have met such a lady.

354
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,323
Lucky is the girl
who weds in this house.

355
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,125
You liked mom so much?

356
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,396
I' ll ask her for my mom-in-law
from God, in my next birth.

357
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,416
Try these out...
Mom asked you to. Remember?

358
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,156
Why try on something which
will never be mine anyway?

359
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:29,165
Circumstances may change.
- Why dream the impossible?

360
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:35,171
Impossible may become possible.
Dreams do come true.

361
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,776
I' m not so lucky.

362
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,512
I went looking for evil...
I found none.

363
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:50,520
I had to look within to know
there wasn't anyone more evil.

364
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:56,093
I' m sure of just one thing.
Take life as it comes.

365
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:01,935
It's right time for you to go on
your son's shoulder, but I pray...

366
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,705
that you see your son married.
See his kids and their kids too.

367
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,043
That you go to heaven
on a gold ladder.

368
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:10,073
No, nothing like this.

369
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,346
I just want my son to wed.
That's all.

370
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:22,453
Well? Did they fit you?
- Yes. They' re lovely.

371
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,554
She didn't even try them on.

372
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:30,889
Why not?
- Some other time.

373
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:37,070
I' ll go now. It's late.
- Okay, but come tomorrow.

374
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,774
Make it during the daytime.
- l' ll try my best.

375
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:47,014
Call her anytime, Aunty.
She' ll be here. No objection.

376
00:54:54,291 --> 00:55:01,993
Your money.
- Let it be. I don't need it.

377
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:08,263
But what about your father?
- Who? Don't worry about him.

378
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,995
I' ll manage him.

379
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:28,250
Why did you refuse the money?
- Because I want gold, not money!

380
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:33,356
There are ornaments worth 10,000/-
in that box - l' ll take those.

381
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:38,463
Fantastic!
Kill without shedding any blood.

382
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:43,431
But what about my commission?
- l' ll pay you.

383
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:49,404
But it should be a fair amount.
- Sure, why not?

384
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:54,182
But let me get the gold first.
- Hats off to you, girl.

385
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,585
I' ll sleep peacefully tonight.

386
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:25,205
A sit-down strike to get the money?
It's become an epidemic in lndia.

387
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:31,244
Anybody can go on a strike.
Never mind. I' ll no less.

388
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,793
He's here!
- Catch him!

389
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:55,268
He isn't here. You' re dreaming.
- But he' ll come for sure.

390
00:56:55,678 --> 00:57:00,377
If he's inside, he' ll come out.
And if he's out, he' ll go in.

391
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,581
We' re here for him!

392
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:17,930
Let me see how he escapes!
- Sure! I too won't spare him.

393
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:38,085
That man is sly as a fox.
He may not give us the slip.

394
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,616
You look that way,
and l' ll look this way.

395
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,892
You' re right!
We' ll do that.

396
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:30,868
When Lord Rama saw Sita's beauty
he was very happy.

397
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:35,808
He praised it to himself,
but couldn't say a word.

398
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:42,477
A house where " Ramayana" is read
is not a house, but a shrine.

399
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:50,153
Bless you. Sit down.
Mohan, let her read it to me.

400
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,586
Come on, dear. Read it out.

401
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,567
Ramayan?
You want me to read it?

402
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:04,904
Yes, go on. You always read it.
She is a pious person.

403
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,301
She doesn't even drink water
until she finishes her prayers!

404
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,774
Such are the hallmarks
of a good lineage.

405
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:15,607
And what a lineage!
She' ll uplift any family she goes in.

406
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,581
Give her the book, son.
Let her read to me.

407
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:29,324
Take it, dear. Don't be shy.
- It's the Ramayan after all.

408
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:43,402
Rama with his brother Laxman
was walking in Janak Park.

409
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,739
Sita too had come there
with her friends.

410
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:53,350
Rama saw Sita and was struck
by Sita's beauty.

411
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:59,525
Same thing happened to Sita too.
And when Rama left the park...

412
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:06,361
there was expectation
in the air...

413
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:07,703
Not in prose, my dear.

414
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:12,307
But in verse. Sing it.
- Sing?

415
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:16,236
Poor girl was singing
all night yesterday.

416
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,911
That's why she has a sore throat.
Excuse her this time.

417
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,115
Next time she' ll sing
the way you want.

418
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,019
That's alright.

419
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:31,090
Son, get the bridal jewellery.
Let's see how she looks in it.

420
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,099
And listen.
Get the bridal sari too.

421
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:44,601
He's such a silly boy.
He chose a girl and never told me.

422
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,942
And there I was
selecting a girl for him!

423
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,768
How will he tell you?
He must've felt awkward.

424
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:55,948
He at least told you! My mom
came to know of my marriage.

425
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:57,252
... from others!

426
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:03,489
I' ll get Mohan married soon now.
- But naturally.

427
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:11,895
Here you are.
- Yes. Wear and show me.

428
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:19,073
It's late now. I' ll wear tomorrow.
- Okay. Why wear tomorrow?

429
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:24,507
Wear it and come here.
Do you mind if we take them home?

430
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:29,580
Why should l? They' re for her.
Wear them and come tomorrow.

431
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:36,317
Okay, l' ll wear them and come.
- Righto! My work is done.

432
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,406
You' re very late today.

433
01:01:55,978 --> 01:02:00,881
You mean early. She has earned
2 years earnings in 2 hours!

434
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,547
What?
- Yes!

435
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,716
She has brought ornaments
worth Rs. 10,000/-!

436
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:09,182
Really?
Let me see them too, Champa dear.

437
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:22,364
Show me the ornaments, dear.
- See them when l' ll wear them.

438
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,707
What about my share?
- Here you are.

439
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,772
What's this.
I meant my share from the ornaments.

440
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:39,377
Was I the daughter-in-law or you?
- But I made you one.

441
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,385
So l' m paying you for it.
- You are cheating me.

442
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,160
You' ll need me some day.
- My foot!

443
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:53,301
I' m not going to step in that house.
Please show the gentleman out!

444
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:57,537
I can find my own way out thanks!
- Why do you get so angry?

445
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:01,468
We' ll have plenty such chances to
use your dishonesty and her beauty.

446
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:06,178
With your blessings everything
will be fine. Dishonesty, beauty!

447
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:50,554
Till Champa gets ready, let's
hear some couplets from you.

448
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,794
Hear this one.
- Yes, go on.

449
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:08,438
You' ll repent you severed my head.
For whose head will you swear on now?

450
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,939
Wonderful!
- Too good!

451
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,013
Last night's dream... Oh God!

452
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,550
You'd be shocked to hear it.

453
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:40,042
Before coming, my beloved
has sent me a message.

454
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,369
But for me the moon
has come down to earth.

455
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:54,352
Wow, Champa!
You look like a bride!

456
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,421
A Goddess, no less.

457
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,454
A lady...
- A nobility.

458
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:06,597
Sure sir, she looks like a lady,
nobility, even a goddess!

459
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:11,702
But Champa looks a nautch-girl
whatever she wears!

460
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,543
A bride?

461
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,605
A Goddess?

462
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,179
A lady of class?

463
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:55,110
You' re no noble lady, Champa.
You' re a nautch-girl, a prostitute.

464
01:05:55,484 --> 01:06:01,650
A prostitute can't wear
a bride's ornaments.

465
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,922
They' ll burn you... scald you!

466
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,839
" Why have you hidden
your face today?"

467
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,845
" Why this curtain between us?"

468
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:30,873
" We've seen your every hue
and every style"

469
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:34,080
" We've seen you from near,
and from afar too"

470
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:43,188
" We've guaged you.
We lost you and rediscovered you"

471
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:49,691
" We understand the language
of the heart, and the eyes"

472
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:55,971
" We' re familiar with the sound
of your bangles and anklets"

473
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:59,205
" We know how moody
and seductive you can be"

474
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:05,536
" We know each and every secret
of yours... Then..."

475
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:12,376
" Why this curtain between us?
Why are you behind the door?"

476
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:44,909
" What's the point
in hiding your face?"

477
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:50,884
" Your glamourous appearance
only enhances your beauty"

478
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:57,199
"Soft cheeks aglow with fire...
and limpid eyes like butterflies"

479
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:03,163
" You sway with sensuality.
And blush like a bride"

480
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:09,307
" Without you our nights are boring;
this romance is so dull"

481
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:12,579
" You' re life to the dying"

482
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:18,716
" You' re the light in this darkness.
Then..."

483
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:30,522
" Why this distance between us?"

484
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,314
"Come, we' re awaiting you
most impatiently"

485
01:09:54,690 --> 01:10:00,322
"The flame flutters...
The stars skip a heartbeat"

486
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:09,229
" If you oblige a bit,
this earth will become heaven"

487
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:15,101
" Now the night just comes and goes.
This fan of yours makes an appeal"

488
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:21,316
" May the Lord keep
your beauty intact..."

489
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,352
" I beg you, please oblige us"

490
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,445
" We' re mad about you"

491
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:29,553
" Your long time ardent fans.
So..."

492
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:37,322
" Why this privacy from us?
Why this distance between us?"

493
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:42,299
" Why this curtain between us?"

494
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:14,230
The curtain has opened...
- Lift your eyes and see the Goddess.

495
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:20,573
My darling girl?
Where's that bridal attire?

496
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:26,244
Yes, where's the new look,
and, those aristocratic ornaments?

497
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:30,243
We liked your new look Champa.
Change into that and come.

498
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,922
Today we' ll have a bride dancing.

499
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,387
No; nobility will dance today.

500
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:43,591
Yes! nobility will dance today.
A lady with class...

501
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:52,937
If you want to see such a dance,
then go home all of you!

502
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,934
I' m not a lady of class, but
a nautch-girl; A whore...

503
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,290
Come on in.
- No, let's talk here.

504
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,422
Rajani didn't come last night.

505
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,494
She' ll never come now.
- Why?

506
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,490
You make a mistake and,
ask me the reason.

507
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:24,967
Why give her those ornaments?
- She said she'd wear them and come.

508
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:33,114
But her father didn't promise!
He must've kept all the loot!

509
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:34,972
You knew how greedy he was!

510
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:39,521
But Rajani's not like that.
- l' m talking about her father.

511
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:44,982
Give me her address.
- What for? I' ll do something.

512
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,991
If you get the ornaments,
well and good, else...

513
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:52,665
Okay, you go to your college
l' ll see her in the evening.

514
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,076
Mom!
- Come, my dear.

515
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,680
You really made me wait.

516
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:17,223
Keep your ornaments first.
- But they' re yours.

517
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:23,222
And why didn't you wear them?
You and my son have had a spat.

518
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:27,829
You've begun fighting already!
But why are you standing?

519
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:34,031
Please sit down, dear.
Near me like this.

520
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:38,370
My son is silly! Listen;
wear these ornaments for me now.

521
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:48,382
No.
My body is not worthy of them.

522
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:54,060
Not worthy? Silly girl...
My daughter-in-law is lovely.

523
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:02,462
Yes, Ma'am?
- My daughter-in-law to be.

524
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:07,334
Mohan will marry her soon.
How is she? Lovely eh?

525
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:14,079
Very! Get them married soon.
- Yes. I' ll fix the date today.

526
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:20,219
Finished your chores? Then go home.
Rajani will sit with me now.

527
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:26,092
Ever since I've been ill,
Gods have been neglected.

528
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:31,363
Go and bathe the Lord,
and do all the holy rites.

529
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:41,300
Me? I' ll bathe the Lord?
I' ll do the holy rites?

530
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:44,101
Yes. It' ll be your duty now.
That's the prayer-room there.

531
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:49,375
Go, my dear.
Listen to me. Go on.

532
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,393
Yes, that's the room of the Lord.

533
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:01,183
Me? Touch the Lord?
No... no..

534
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:26,207
" Why are you so nervous
at the door of the Lord?"

535
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:31,475
" When thousands of wretched beings
are blessed by Him?"

536
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:34,406
" Millions of sinners are relieved
of their sins at His door"

537
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:41,283
" Why are you so nervous
of the Lord, at the door"

538
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:46,290
" When thousands of wretched
live are blessed by Him?"

539
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:21,319
" Whether it's Mahananda,
Ahilya, He helps everybody"

540
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:34,339
" Whoever touches his feet
is blessed by Him"

541
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:45,345
" At the Lord's door, why does
your mind become nervous?"

542
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:51,553
" When the thousand of wretched
souls are blessed at his door?"

543
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:14,646
" He's not bothered with the caste
nor anyone's vices and virtues"

544
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:23,715
" He is God's favourite devotee,
who takes His name."

545
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:38,063
" Whoever comes with faith to Him,
is rewarded the most"

546
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:43,738
" Why are you so nervous
at the Lord's door..."

547
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:52,076
" When thousands of wretched
people are blessed by Him?"

548
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:34,593
O Lord, please bless me.
Save me O Lord.

549
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:52,476
I' ll have you jailed.
Where's Champa? Tell me.

550
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:58,481
I don't know, I swear.
- Show me the house you took her to.

551
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:03,154
Why are you hitting me?
Want to see the house? Come.

552
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:11,491
What's the point in going in?
- She has taken the ornaments!

553
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:16,504
Stupid, aren't you? Will she
return to the scene of the crime?

554
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,501
This is the house.
Go in.

555
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:24,169
if you need me, inform me.

556
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,981
If she can't be here,
where will she be?

557
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:29,508
Expand your vision.

558
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,848
Many men go to her dance-hall.
She may have fallen in love.

559
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:38,192
Must've gone to him.
Come with me.

560
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,200
What's the mater?
- Jeevan...

561
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:51,867
Did you go there?
- lt' ll be fine!

562
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:55,535
Listen to me...
- Listen? Such small matters...

563
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:56,945
in the evening.

564
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,543
Promise?
- Yes. Come, Sir.

565
01:21:58,914 --> 01:21:59,938
He's fond of drinks.

566
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,236
Home, son?
- How' re you?

567
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,033
Fine, l' ll not fall sick how.

568
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:29,570
Son, your wife...
- Oh yes! I spoke to Jeevan.

569
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:33,582
She' ll come tonight.

570
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:36,109
Tonight indeed!

571
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:01,603
Let it be. It has fallen
in the right place.

572
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:06,147
You picked it up now,
but don't let it fall again.

573
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:11,079
I didn't drop it purposely.
- These things happen unknowingly.

574
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,617
For instance, it was in your hand
Then at your feet, and now...

575
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:21,153
it's close to your heart.
- No... nothing like that.

576
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:29,161
I was just looking at it.
- Then my photo is lucky.

577
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:33,030
What do you mean?
- Today you held the photograph.

578
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:38,644
Tomorrow it could be my turn.
I also have some hopes.

579
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:43,178
The ones I hold, usually fall.
They don't rise in life.

580
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:47,921
Hold my hand and see.
- l' m not really worthy of you.

581
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:52,660
A pearl doesn't know its value,
nor a flower, its fragrance.

582
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:59,665
All flowers don't smell sweet.
All of them aren't offered to God.

583
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:12,672
Sir, l' m a scent-less flower.

584
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:18,681
Only the one who smells the flower
knows its scent. Not the flower.

585
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:23,682
Ask my heart, what you really are.
- You' re wrong.

586
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:31,022
You' re mistaking bronze for gold.
I' m bad... very bad.

587
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,984
Listen to me, dear...

588
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:28,748
" Be careful, dear heart...
What's the point in aching so?"

589
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:40,759
" Why go to a place where you' ll
never find a place? So, careful"

590
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:58,785
" Please come back.
Why turn your face and go way?"

591
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:07,718
" Why let that heart suffer
which longs for you?"

592
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:09,925
"So come back..."

593
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:36,818
" Who' ll want to make me his own?
Who' ll want this trampled flower?"

594
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:44,826
" Why dream empty dreams?"

595
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:54,640
" Why go there,
where you' ll never be accepted?"

596
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,839
"So control yourself"

597
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,847
"Come back to me..."

598
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:16,730
"This heart has seen you, wanted
you, and even worshipped you"

599
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:25,872
" Actually, it's the first time that
this heart has asked for something"

600
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:35,881
" Why pretend not to know
when you know everything"

601
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:39,884
"So come to me"

602
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:42,881
" Be careful, dear heart"

603
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:58,570
"Those who find happiness
are others, not me"

604
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:06,905
" It's for others to find a place
in somebody's heart, not me"

605
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:16,254
" Why let hopes toy
with false pretenses?"

606
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:24,926
" Why go there,
where l' ll never be accepted?"

607
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,270
"So be careful"

608
01:28:30,005 --> 01:28:31,939
"Come to me..."

609
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:47,948
" What was in the heart,
has now found voice"

610
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:55,956
"Then let the matter stay
where it is now"

611
01:28:57,399 --> 01:29:07,968
"The matter has now reached
its final stage"

612
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:17,979
" When you' re going to lose that
person for sure, why chase?"

613
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:25,987
" Why go there,
where there' ll be no place for me?"

614
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:29,997
"So be careful, dear heart"

615
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,658
" Please come to me"

616
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:06,356
The whole area is busy.
Only your place is locked!

617
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:20,044
She isn't here either.
Must've eloped with somebody.

618
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:27,046
The bird has flown from the coop!
- Where to? I've long arms too!

619
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:37,391
Hey! There she is!
- She's sleeping.

620
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:44,330
But your luck has awakened!
- l' m so relieved!

621
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,416
You' re well, aren't you?

622
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:00,755
I just dozed off.

623
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:06,088
Get up. Take a wash, and change.
People will soon start coming.

624
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:08,426
Let's go, Jeevan.

625
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:19,437
Greetings, Sir.
- Sit down Maestro. Tune up.

626
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:34,119
Come on, sir. Champa's returned.
Tonight I expect something better.

627
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:42,123
Bless these beauties
who make us yearn.

628
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:29,504
Everything seems quiet today...
- Just like my dear heart, Sir.

629
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:35,177
Sir, why don't, you sir,
Come up with some couplets?

630
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:47,589
Champa, we' re losing our patience.
Come out now.

631
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:49,523
Come out, dear.
See how impatient they all are.

632
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:52,200
I' ll get her.
- Wait! She' ll be here.

633
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:06,278
Didn't you change your clothes?
- I've had a change of heart instead.

634
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,210
What a dialogue!

635
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,213
Your change of heart
has changed my fate.

636
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:20,889
Shut up! Ask them to leave.
I' ll not perform.

637
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:27,229
Look, how eagerly they await
your performance.

638
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,906
She' ll sing. Please don't mind.

639
01:33:32,474 --> 01:33:37,241
Never mind. A beloved's abuse
I is also music to one's ears.

640
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:43,650
Ask them to leave! I' ll not sing!
- My foot!

641
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:46,645
You' ll have to sing!
Play on...

642
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:49,386
Stop it!

643
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:57,258
Yes, come on.
- Hold on...

644
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:00,935
Please sit down. She' ll sing.
I' ll make her sing.

645
01:34:01,436 --> 01:34:04,269
Who the hell is she to refuse?

646
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:09,266
Have you forgotten your bad days
when you had nothing to eat?

647
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:12,205
I lifted you off the streets
and put you in this mansion!

648
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,810
I made you a queen!
- I don't want to be one!

649
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,946
Make your sisters queens, give
them mansions and make them sing!

650
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,287
Shut up!

651
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:21,555
Will you sing, or not?
- No!

652
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,550
Let's see how you don't!
- You rascal!

653
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:29,620
You bitch!
You dare do this?

654
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:43,566
Now talk!
- What's this? Have you gone mad?

655
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:53,577
I' ll kill you!
- You will eh? Then go ahead.

656
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:59,321
I' m standing before you.
Kill me!

657
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:05,625
Why did you stop? You cur!
You live off a woman's earnings!

658
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:12,666
You can't kill anyone.
The Champa you wish to kill...

659
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:19,344
I've killed her myself!
Today the woman in me has risen.

660
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:25,614
I've risen and so has my soul.
No power can force me to dance.

661
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:34,621
Get lost! Else l' ll kill you.
Didn't you hear me?

662
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:43,368
Okay, but remember.
I vow to make you dance again!

663
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,372
And not here, but,
in the open market!

664
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:56,384
Gently, dear.

665
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:59,380
Then tell me.
How did you get hurt?

666
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:02,056
You've heard it 50 times!

667
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,390
A volcano erupted and
one boulder hit me! Satisfied?

668
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:15,062
Where is this volcano?
And what were you doing there?

669
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:18,729
Oh Lord!
That's where my factory is.

670
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:23,666
Factory? You work in a factory?
- No, I work in a coop!

671
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,014
Don't get angry. I' m just asking.
What do you do there?

672
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:32,409
I' m the middle-man between client
and the stock.

673
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:34,688
A broker.

674
01:36:35,056 --> 01:36:37,752
What a cheap word.
I take commission!

675
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:46,428
God save people from such guys.
They think my home is the factory.

676
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:57,768
I had gone to Rajani's house.
- She had already come home.

677
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:02,439
No wonder you' re so happy.
- She returned the ornaments too.

678
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:06,450
Really? Didn't take your
heart instead, did she?

679
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:10,780
What's this on your head?
- Nothing. My wife bumped into me!

680
01:37:11,759 --> 01:37:15,855
Why don't you come in?
- No, l' m off to college.

681
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:17,927
Mom wants to meet
Rajani's father.

682
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:19,459
Oh, really?

683
01:37:21,302 --> 01:37:22,735
She' ll discuss marriage?
- Yes.

684
01:37:23,505 --> 01:37:26,474
Excellent. I' ll meet him today.

685
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:32,477
But he's a greedy person.
He' ll want money in exchange.

686
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:36,150
Don't worry, l' ll give him
whatever he demands.

687
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,148
Good.

688
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:42,748
Do you have any money?
I'd have taken it to him.

689
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:46,623
Here you are.

690
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:52,296
A greedy man sometimes
sells his integrity...

691
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,498
and at times his daughter.
Such people are very lowly.

692
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:30,193
You, and praying?
I can't call you Champa anymore.

693
01:38:31,372 --> 01:38:35,206
It has to be Rajani.
- A name doesn't change a person.

694
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:40,340
But a change of heart
changes a person.

695
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:46,812
Mohan was remembering you. Let's go.
- No.

696
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:52,890
I' ll never go there now.
- Then shall I bring him here?

697
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:55,229
Don't do that. I beg you.

698
01:38:57,265 --> 01:39:01,565
You won't come. He can't come!
How do we proceed further?

699
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:06,563
It's all over now.
- Over? It's just begun you mean.

700
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:14,575
He wishes to marry you.
- Marry me? No.

701
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:25,583
He wants Rajani, l' m Champa.
A nautch-girl, who' ll wed me?

702
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:36,603
Don't tell him my real identity.
Let this secret remain a secret.

703
01:39:37,772 --> 01:39:44,610
Sure, and it can be kept too.
But you have to make a deal.

704
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:53,285
My whole existence is on mercy.
Close one fist, open the other.

705
01:39:53,454 --> 01:40:00,622
I' ll pay you as much as you want,
but Mohan must never know.

706
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:03,293
Okay.

707
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:10,965
Love is blind. It knows no
caste, colour, or status.

708
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:18,968
Vasantasena was a prostitute to
the world, but not to Charudatt.

709
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:25,982
To him she was a woman.
He missed her when apart...

710
01:40:28,222 --> 01:40:32,454
and was a happy when they met.
This portion is always remembered.

711
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:35,985
The great poet describes it thus.

712
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:11,695
Charudutt is saying
to his beloved Rajani...

713
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,699
Rajani, Sir?
- Did I say that?

714
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:22,233
That's wrong.
I meant Rajani, as Night.

715
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:26,706
They met only at night.

716
01:41:29,283 --> 01:41:34,016
Of course. Charudutt must be
attending a college in the morning.

717
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:45,192
So! Charudutt says to
Vasantsena in the night...

718
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:51,728
"O one with the large eyes,
I spent many a night..."

719
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:58,401
"... remembering you and
sighing deeply in frustration"

720
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:03,076
Does separation from one's
beloved does that to a person?

721
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:09,079
Worse than this, I mean,
the poet seems to think so.

722
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:15,426
There must be a remedy to it.
- There is togetherness.

723
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:55,792
Wonderful Champa!
- You look like a true devotee.

724
01:42:56,838 --> 01:42:59,807
This is a new way
to trap her prey.

725
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:49,850
Who are you calling?
She's Champa, not Rajani.

726
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:56,289
Yes. She's a nautch-girl.
a renowned prostitute.

727
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:04,631
A prostitute.
A nautch-girl.

728
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:16,311
- Who is Rajani?
Who is she, I say!

729
01:44:16,684 --> 01:44:22,054
Is it true she's Champa,
the nautch-girl. A prostitute?

730
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:27,557
Why did you bring her to my house?
- Control yourself.

731
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:30,891
I' ll strangle you! Tell me,
Why did you bring her home?

732
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:37,226
Because your mom was dying, and
you needed a wife for a while.

733
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:42,565
And sir, only a prostitute can
be a wife for a short period.

734
01:44:42,743 --> 01:44:45,906
Not a well-bred girl.
- Why didn't you tell me before?

735
01:44:46,314 --> 01:44:50,683
Why should l? You wanted your
mom to die peacefully.

736
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,915
Now is it my fault that
she didn't die and got well.

737
01:44:53,621 --> 01:45:01,687
You did a very bad thing. If
mom finds out, she' ll kill herself.

738
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:06,930
That' ll be right. A prostitute
in the house of such a pious lady?

739
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:14,237
She not only sat near her pillow,
and even fed her water.

740
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:18,612
What do I do now?

741
01:45:19,113 --> 01:45:23,675
Slap me here too!
- l' m sorry.

742
01:45:25,252 --> 01:45:29,780
You can give me 2 slaps if you
wish, but mom mustn't know this.

743
01:45:30,124 --> 01:45:36,552
Please take pity on me.
- But of course!

744
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:38,958
My whole existence is
on mercy and virtue.

745
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:46,072
Close one fist, open the other...
you know what I mean l' m sure.

746
01:45:47,141 --> 01:45:48,574
Come home and take it.

747
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:52,634
Don't feel bad, friend.
I've a family, a wife...

748
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:57,642
and could've kids too.
I can't afford to say not to money.

749
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:07,249
Did you meet Rajani's father?
- l' ll never see her face again!

750
01:46:07,495 --> 01:46:10,828
I' ll never go there!
- Why? What happened?

751
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:15,260
Nothing.
- Tell me at least.

752
01:46:17,772 --> 01:46:21,003
Come in, Jeevan
- Greetings, Aunty.

753
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:27,780
Mohan says he won't see Rajani's
face again. Todays boys are weird!

754
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:31,343
They choose their own wives
and then fight at every step.

755
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:33,687
As if it's a kids game!

756
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:38,020
Take me to her house.
Who me?

757
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:39,089
Yes. Come on.

758
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:44,092
I'd have loved to, but they
went out of town this morning.

759
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,026
When will they return?
- Didn't say.

760
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:49,700
Where to?
- Don't know.

761
01:46:51,472 --> 01:46:54,441
That's why my son's so angry.

762
01:46:54,809 --> 01:46:59,576
What right have you to be angry,
bossing her before marriage?

763
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:03,843
I can't marry her. Never!
- Why not?

764
01:47:04,285 --> 01:47:09,587
I've accepted as her your wife,
with all my heart and soul.

765
01:47:09,757 --> 01:47:11,816
She' ll be my daughter-in-law.
You must marry her.

766
01:47:12,293 --> 01:47:16,161
How do I explain? She doesn't
wish to marry me. Ask him.

767
01:47:16,497 --> 01:47:21,662
Yes. I've heard the rumour too.
There's someone else.

768
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:26,863
You' re lying! I've seen her
with my experienced eyes.

769
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:34,407
She loves my son,
this house she loves even me!

770
01:47:34,648 --> 01:47:38,744
You' re mistaken, mom.
She's a fraud.

771
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:43,821
Everything is false here.
This world too.

772
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:49,192
I' m a fraud, so are you.
But the Lord isn't.

is a sin to woman"

797
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:12,014
" Woman gave birth to man"

798
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:27,363
" A woman is destiny of the world
but she doesn't have it herself"

799
01:52:27,808 --> 01:52:32,643
"She bears Prophets and
Lord lncarnates..."

800
01:52:32,813 --> 01:52:37,944
" Even then she's considered
a devil's child"

801
01:52:38,552 --> 01:52:48,393
"This is that unfortunate mom,
who sleeps with her own sons"

802
01:52:49,696 --> 01:52:59,003
" For a woman is the mother of man.
But they gave her the marketplace"

803
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:09,911
" Whenever they felt like it,
they accepted or discarded her"

804
01:53:10,451 --> 01:53:15,150
" And it was a woman
who gave birth to man"

805
01:53:22,329 --> 01:53:22,954
Dear Mohan.

806
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:32,435
I' m not Rajani,
but Champa, a prostitute.

807
01:53:36,577 --> 01:53:39,444
Which you came to know...

808
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:46,708
I know the doors of matrimony
are closed to a prostitute.

809
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:53,448
But I wish to see you,
just once, outside those doors.

810
01:53:57,264 --> 01:54:01,394
Tomorrow at midnight l' ll wait
for you outside your door.

811
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:28,877
Why are you here?
Why do you want to meet me?

812
01:55:30,657 --> 01:55:37,290
To apologise for my mistake.
- Really? But it's not your fault.

813
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:42,231
That's your profession.
To fool, cheat, and ruin people.

814
01:55:42,536 --> 01:55:47,235
That's what a whore does!

815
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:57,581
A whore doesn't fall from a sky.
She too is a daughter; a sister.

816
01:55:58,285 --> 01:56:02,915
She too is a woman sir!
- one whose life is full of crimes...

817
01:56:03,223 --> 01:56:07,922
...whose breath is poisoned with
treachery and fraud...

818
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:10,652
... if that's a woman,
then I spit on her!

819
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:16,129
Spit on the men who make a whore.
Take advantage of her weak physique.

820
01:56:16,503 --> 01:56:19,267
Who ruin her for their own gain.

821
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:24,873
A woman is a cheat because
she doesn't make the first move.

822
01:56:25,245 --> 01:56:30,273
She waits for the man to do so.
She's a cheat because...

823
01:56:30,584 --> 01:56:38,355
... she hides her feelings, till
men repeatedly swear their love.

824
01:56:39,626 --> 01:56:45,622
It's not a woman who betrays
and cheats. It's the man!

825
01:56:47,901 --> 01:56:53,498
You men build brothels for whores
and orphanages for your bastards.

826
01:56:54,441 --> 01:56:58,172
And then you mix in the high
society and critize us...

827
01:56:58,478 --> 01:57:00,446
... to save yourselves humiliation.

828
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:10,922
Ever heard the story of a whore?
She' ll tell you the truth.

829
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:17,929
Men deceived me.
Men made me a whore.

830
01:57:21,902 --> 01:57:23,995
I too am an unfortunate whore.

831
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:32,334
You've got your ornaments.
Now take your money.

832
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,066
Wait!

833
01:58:33,006 --> 01:58:38,410
Where are you taking her?
- You go on. I' ll answer him.

834
01:58:41,047 --> 01:58:44,016
You can't take her!
Let her go.

835
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:44,680
Sir...

836
01:58:44,851 --> 01:58:53,418
Better not interfere.
Else...

837
01:59:26,092 --> 01:59:30,324
Go away! Else l' ll wake up
the public, and call the police.

838
01:59:39,506 --> 01:59:45,741
Sir, you picked a fight with me!
It' ll prove very expensive.

839
01:59:48,748 --> 01:59:49,476
Let's go...

840
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:45,863
Where am l?

841
02:00:48,875 --> 02:00:51,366
You?
- Yes, me.

842
02:00:51,845 --> 02:00:54,370
I saved you from those thugs.

843
02:00:56,249 --> 02:01:01,209
Why did you do that?
why did you save me?

844
02:01:03,323 --> 02:01:05,348
They were taking me away,
you should've let them.

845
02:01:06,927 --> 02:01:12,957
Tell me. Why did you save me?
- As a fellow human being.

846
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:17,698
Who' ll save me tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

847
02:01:18,204 --> 02:01:25,201
Yes! And the day after.
Next month. Next year!

848
02:01:25,912 --> 02:01:32,181
This is a life long curse.
this always happens with me.

849
02:01:33,887 --> 02:01:35,878
And it will always happen!

850
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:40,782
Who were they?
- Men.

851
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:44,923
Where were they taking you? Why?

852
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:52,538
As a thing of amusement for men.
To sing and dance.

853
02:01:53,907 --> 02:01:56,603
Against your will?
- Will?

854
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:07,481
Only the rich and the powerful
have will. And men of course!

855
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:16,156
I' m vulnerable. Alone.
And a woman too.

856
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:19,958
My sympathies are with you.

857
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:26,503
I wish others would
sympathise too.

858
02:02:28,274 --> 02:02:34,736
I too was well-bred.
From a decent family.

859
02:02:37,684 --> 02:02:45,989
I was born in a family which was
rich in culture, but poor financially.

860
02:02:47,127 --> 02:02:50,324
I lost my father
in my childhood.

861
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:58,337
Mother was my only support.

862
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:15,348
She was seriously ill.
And I was a female... young.

863
02:03:20,326 --> 02:03:24,695
Her weak hand rose
to comfort me.

864
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:30,301
But she was dying before me.

865
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:37,275
Neighbours came feigning decency.

866
02:03:39,245 --> 02:03:47,778
Their excuse was to see mom.
But they stared at me. My body.

867
02:03:52,358 --> 02:03:58,388
Their hands pretended to help
mother, but touched me.

868
02:04:01,935 --> 02:04:08,272
My mother's health got worse,
and with it their lust and daring.

869
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:24,288
My mother was dying.
She needed a doctor and medicines.

870
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:31,096
I went to beg to
a sympathetic neighbour.

871
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:39,033
I spread my palms for help
but he caught my arm instead.

872
02:04:41,808 --> 02:04:45,039
I spread my shawl for alms,
but he pulled it instead.

873
02:04:45,245 --> 02:04:47,611
Instead of helping me,
they wanted to loot me!

874
02:04:49,916 --> 02:04:57,789
Before fulfilling my necessities,
they wanted to sate their lust.

875
02:04:58,057 --> 02:05:01,959
They wanted me to taste poison
before giving medicine to mom.

876
02:05:03,062 --> 02:05:09,126
I escaped from their paws
and went home.

877
02:05:11,037 --> 02:05:19,137
I was running to reach mom,
but my heart was breaking.

878
02:05:22,882 --> 02:05:23,849
And reached home.

879
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:30,012
Before I got home,
Mom had passed on.

880
02:05:31,124 --> 02:05:35,652
She didn't stop to think
what will become of me?

881
02:05:46,206 --> 02:05:49,369
All the neighbours gathered.

882
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:53,308
They needed a cloth
to cover my mom's body.

883
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:29,481
They didn't put a shroud on her,
but on my fate instead.

884
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:37,381
I was helpless, and alone.

885
02:06:38,524 --> 02:06:43,427
And the society took
full advantage of it.

886
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:51,563
They misguided and harrassed me
and brought me to a brothel.

887
02:06:58,444 --> 02:07:01,345
I fell in love with Rajani.

888
02:07:02,615 --> 02:07:04,310
Now I love you as Champa.

889
02:07:06,552 --> 02:07:14,118
I'd have married you defying
the social norms. But my mom...

890
02:07:16,963 --> 02:07:25,598
By saying this, you've made me
your wife. I' m married to you.

891
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:30,268
I've become a decent woman
from a good family again.

892
02:07:33,313 --> 02:07:35,042
My world has changed now.

893
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:38,945
Now I don't want anything more.

894
02:08:00,473 --> 02:08:06,241
Please go from here.
Somebody may see you.

895
02:08:07,613 --> 02:08:13,245
Tomorrow nobody should say
that I ruined you.

896
02:08:15,288 --> 02:08:18,985
Pleased go from here.
For God's sake!

897
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:24,319
Your mother must not know
that you visit a brothel.

898
02:08:26,666 --> 02:08:32,298
My son goes to a prostitute?
No! I' ll never ever believe it.

899
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:40,875
You better believe it. Your son
goes to her, and she come here!

900
02:08:42,382 --> 02:08:47,342
Your son's fiancee is everybody's
fiancee. Anybody can buy her.

901
02:08:47,553 --> 02:08:50,283
I' ll have your tongue!
Go away from here.

902
02:08:51,824 --> 02:08:58,127
I' ll go but how will
you erase the stigma?

903
02:08:59,065 --> 02:09:03,024
Your Rajani is Champa!
A nautch-girl, and a whore!

904
02:09:05,238 --> 02:09:10,369
Shut up!
Where the Lord is praised...

905
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:14,307
a daughter-in-law's anklets
tinkle. Not a whore's!

906
02:09:14,614 --> 02:09:17,447
Get out of my sight.
My son can never do this.

907
02:09:17,683 --> 02:09:23,121
He can't cheat me.
- Every mom believes her son.

908
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:27,785
And an unworthy son betrays
his mother exactly in this way.

909
02:09:33,766 --> 02:09:39,398
Here comes your good son.
I was lying, eh? Then ask him.

910
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:44,569
Who's this man?
He's talking nonsense.

911
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:47,738
I' m not saying anything.

912
02:09:48,047 --> 02:09:52,313
I just said Rajani is Champa,
a nautch-girl. A prostitute.

913
02:09:52,685 --> 02:09:55,415
Have I lied, Sir?

914
02:09:59,125 --> 02:10:03,084
Why are you quiet?
Say all this is a lie.

915
02:10:04,263 --> 02:10:11,635
Our Rajani's not a prostitute,
but a decent girl - your fiancee.

916
02:10:14,874 --> 02:10:18,105
Why don't you say something?
Tell me all this is a lie.

917
02:10:24,884 --> 02:10:28,376
It's not a lie, mom.
It's the truth.

918
02:10:32,425 --> 02:10:36,122
Your mom died the day you
brought a whore in this house!

919
02:10:36,762 --> 02:10:42,325
O, God! That sinful woman
fed me the Holy water.

920
02:10:42,602 --> 02:10:46,470
I myself was in the dark, mom.
Didn't know a thing.

921
02:10:46,772 --> 02:10:50,139
But you knew I was dying.
That's why you avoided marriage.

922
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:53,138
You were me misleading
so you could marry that whore!

923
02:10:53,346 --> 02:10:56,144
She wasn't born a whore, mom.
She was forced to become one.

924
02:10:56,315 --> 02:11:02,083
That's why you brought her home?
To enhance your family's name?

925
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:06,317
She was from a good family too.
- Then bring her home.

926
02:11:06,626 --> 02:11:09,561
Marry her. Let her dance
in this courtyard here.

927
02:11:09,929 --> 02:11:12,420
Sing with her!
- No, mother.

928
02:11:13,466 --> 02:11:20,497
She's a helpless girl.
She can only cry, not sing.

929
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:22,171
Then marry her!

930
02:11:22,475 --> 02:11:29,438
Bring fame to your family name
and enhance its reputation!

931
02:11:33,219 --> 02:11:39,522
He's not to fault.
Blame me. Please forgive me.

932
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:43,684
Don't call me Mom with
your vile tongue! Get out!

933
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:50,091
I've come to say goodbye.
I just wanted to...

934
02:11:50,336 --> 02:11:53,999
Don't you touch me
with your unholy hands!

935
02:11:55,908 --> 02:11:58,706
The Ganges doesn't become unholy
by washing the sins of the sinners.

936
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:01,709
In fact she purifies them.

937
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:07,209
Shut up! A fallen fruit can't be
put back on the tree again.

938
02:12:07,587 --> 02:12:13,048
But it can lie in its shade.
- lt' ll make that shade unholy too.

939
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:18,822
You've made a dent in our home.
You' re no woman, but a vixen.

940
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:23,431
An insult to womanhood! You've
no right to enter a household.

941
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:31,908
Hear that? You've no right
to enter a decent household.

942
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:36,741
But everybody can knock
on your door, anytime!

943
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:42,512
At night the keepers of society
call your house a heaven.

944
02:12:42,822 --> 02:12:45,916
But during the day it becomes
a hell to them!

945
02:12:46,025 --> 02:12:47,993
They call a whore a
stigma to the society.

946
02:12:50,496 --> 02:12:52,657
I couldn't wash it off.

947
02:12:53,299 --> 02:12:58,134
All the tears of countless whores
couldn't wash it off till now!

948
02:12:58,537 --> 02:13:02,997
Your love is not to be adorned
but to be trampled upon!

949
02:13:03,409 --> 02:13:08,608
You can be a wife for a night.
Not for life.

950
02:13:08,981 --> 02:13:11,211
You just can't be a man's wife!

951
02:13:16,922 --> 02:13:18,947
I will serve you like a slave!

952
02:13:20,593 --> 02:13:25,428
See? Here you fall at their
feet and they shove you away.

953
02:13:25,631 --> 02:13:29,567
There, they fall at your feet,
and you shove them away.

954
02:13:29,869 --> 02:13:34,169
You can't even be a slave here.
There, you' re a queen.

955
02:13:34,507 --> 02:13:38,910
Here, their religion and faith
is soiled by your touch.

956
02:13:39,211 --> 02:13:41,509
And there, you are their
faith, and religion.

957
02:13:41,747 --> 02:13:44,307
There's insult here,
and respect there.

958
02:13:44,684 --> 02:13:47,118
So which is better? The shade
here, or the sunshine there.

959
02:13:47,553 --> 02:13:51,489
Rajani, there's no place
for Champa in this house.

960
02:13:59,965 --> 02:14:08,669
You' re right. A fallen fruit can
never hang from a tree again.

961
02:14:09,975 --> 02:14:12,000
I give up.

962
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:20,077
I belong to those lanes
and brothels.

963
02:14:56,021 --> 02:15:01,254
You came here as my son's wife.
You can't leave as a whore now.

964
02:15:03,496 --> 02:15:08,661
A home is a like the Ganges.
An abode of the gods.

965
02:15:09,702 --> 02:15:12,671
And a temple's doors
are never closed to anyone.

966
02:15:30,756 --> 02:15:38,094
"These doors have never been
closed to anyone for centuries"

967
02:15:38,597 --> 02:15:46,094
" All those who've lost elsewhere
have won at these doors"

968
02:15:51,143 --> 02:15:57,343
" Millions of sinners have been
purified here"

969
02:15:57,716 --> 02:16:04,986
" Why do you feel so nervous
at the doors of the Lord?"

970
02:16:05,357 --> 02:16:10,659
" Millions of wretched beings
find salvation here"

971
02:16:10,896 --> 02:16:14,388
" At the door of the Lord"
