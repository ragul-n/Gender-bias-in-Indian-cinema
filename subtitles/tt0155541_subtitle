00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,930
Who's there?
Why don't you answer?

3
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,650
- What happened?
- l barely managed to escape.

4
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,010
- There was a big commotion
out there. - Where's the coat?

5
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,760
- l dropped it down there.
- You dropped it?

6
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,770
You made a mistake.
Okay, come on.

7
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,480
This is the room.

8
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,850
Who's there?
What is it?

9
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,940
- Where's the coat?
- Coat? - Yes.

10
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,160
- Where are you?
- l'm here. What is it?

11
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,550
- There are three of them here.
- Three? What do they look like?

12
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,960
- They look tough.
- That's why there are three.

13
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,550
Where are they?

14
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,600
- What's the matter?
- Where's the coat?

15
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,290
They're asking
where's the "court".

16
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,920
There's the grass court
at the corner.

17
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,310
- And there's the High Court
in front. - Shut up!

18
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,190
Search the house thoroughly.

19
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,510
Search my pockets, too,
if you want.

20
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,140
The coat isn't here.

21
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,500
Watch out!

22
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,710
Hand us the coat quietly,
or l'll kill you!

23
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,920
Please believe us.
We don't have any coat with us.

24
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,640
lf we had it with us,
we'd have returned it...

25
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,429
before you brought
out your pistol.

26
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,750
Our lives are more precious
than your coat.

27
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,880
No, they aren't!

28
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,290
Our being jobless doesn't mean
we have no value at all.

29
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,560
What is your coat worth?

30
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,940
lt's worth 10,000 rupees, understand?

31
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,820
- Mad fool.
- You're right.

32
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
He called us mad!

33
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,450
He said the coat is
worth 10,000 rupees!

34
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,570
- Why are you pulling my quilt?
- Where's mine?

35
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,550
- lt must be here somewhere.
- lt's here.

36
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,090
This looks like a coat.

37
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,870
Why are you screaming?
Shut up!

38
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,320
- What happened? - lt's the
coat with 10,000 rupees!

39
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,039
Let's see. lt would be
so good if we find it.

40
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,350
- Don't point that pistol.
- Who's doing it?

41
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
Doing it again?

42
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:14,820
He's the same man!
Here's your coat.

43
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,430
- Madcap.
- He thinks l'm mad!

44
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,789
- Bhaggu, has he left?
- Yes.

45
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,100
- l think something is fishy.
- Why?

46
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,580
That coat must hold some secret.

47
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,560
Else, he wouldn't brandish
the pistol all the time.

48
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,890
Let's follow them.

49
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,130
Sir, here's your coat.

50
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,160
lt's an ordinary coat.

51
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,780
Why did you take so
much trouble for it?

52
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,510
You don't know its value.
Here's your 10,000.

53
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,390
10,000? What's so special
about this coat after all?

54
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:59,969
- lt's worth rupees 20 lakhs.
- 20 lakhs?

55
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,810
20 lakhs! lts price is
going on increasing!

56
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,000
Else, he wouldn't have paid
10,000 to procure it.

57
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,229
- You're right.
- Why are you crying?

58
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,430
What else should l do?

59
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,520
The coat came into our hands,
then slipped away!

60
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,540
We still have a chance.
We can get the 10,000, too.

61
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,300
- We can? How?
- By going after the rich man.

62
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,409
Really? He's coming!

63
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,970
Let's go.

64
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,910
Here's your reward.

65
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,939
- How much is it?
- One thousand.

66
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,920
- lt's enough for you.
- Enough?

67
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,040
l risk my life,
but you hog the money!

68
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,480
lf caught, it's l who'll be hanged!

69
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,810
- Bihari. - Yes?
- He wants more!

70
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,110
Driver, stop the car!

71
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,110
Watch out!

72
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,350
- Suppose l don't give you anything?
- Then what?

73
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,740
l'll shoot you down!

74
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,599
See this pistol?

75
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,740
What are you staring at?

76
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,050
- Remove your finger from your pocket.
- lt's on the trigger.

77
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,550
- lt's a real pistol, worth 800 rupees.
- Really, 800 rupees?

78
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,060
Remove your hand from your
pocket, or you'll die!

79
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,290
You've brought out a pistol.
How did you notice my finger?

80
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,680
He saw through our ruse.

81
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,150
Then what? ls this any
way to scare someone?

82
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,850
Should l make my finger
resemble a cannon?

83
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,839
He's going! Sir, listen!

84
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,710
What's so special
about this coat...

85
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,130
- that everyone's after it?
- You don't know.

86
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,900
- There's 20 lakhs inside
the coat. - 20 lakhs?

87
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,030
Yes, that's why everyone's
after it.

88
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,550
20 lakhs!

89
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,120
- When will the car be repaired?
- ln 10 minutes.

90
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,460
- When it's done, call me.
- As you say.

91
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,170
When Chanda fills her cup,
the world gets drunk

92
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,610
Come, my beloved, this
is a night of love

93
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,470
My heart is frenzied with happiness

94
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,520
Let's share some loving
talk with each other

95
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,189
lf you listen, l'll tell you this

96
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,110
When Chanda fills her cup,
the world gets drunk

97
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,590
Come, my beloved,
this is a night of love

98
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,350
My love for you has
made me fragrant

99
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,070
Waiting for you,
l stand and stagger

100
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,130
l float with the
flow of your love

101
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,790
When Chanda fills her cup,
the world gets drunk

102
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,400
Come, my beloved,
this is a night of love

103
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,250
There's a star along with the moon

104
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,810
Give me company too, my love

105
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,750
Let me be always with you

106
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,420
When Chanda fills her cup,
the world gets drunk

107
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,080
Come, my beloved,
this is a night of love

108
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,939
- What happened?
- Silence!

109
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,939
- Why is the lamp lit?
- Why are you so tense?

110
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,490
- Turn out the lamp!
- Mother!

111
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,840
Why is he crying?
Silence him!

112
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,760
What's the matter?
Can't you say it?

113
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,170
Silence him first,
or l'll strangle him!

114
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,410
Have you gone mad?
He must be crying due to hunger.

115
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,340
The children won't
cry anymore now.

116
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,300
All our troubles will
vanish now.

117
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,280
See this coat?
There's rupees 20 lakhs in it.

118
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,730
20 lakhs? Where did so
much money come from?

119
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,810
Whose coat is this?

120
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,960
My boss's. l don't have to
worry about my job anymore!

121
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,900
Even if l work all my life,
l couldn't earn this much!

122
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,360
So you stole it?

123
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,220
You threw away your
job of so many years?

124
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:56,180
Why should l work anymore?
Now l'm a rich man myself!

125
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,520
l curse such wealth,
that's been robbed from others.

126
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,520
Till now, you've ruined
your life by gambling.

127
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,800
Now, with stolen money...

128
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,290
you want to ruin the lives
of these innocent kids.

129
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,350
- What are you saying?
- lt's the truth.

130
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,430
Till now, you've deceived me
for the sake of money.

131
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,690
Today, you deceived your employer.

132
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,770
A person can do
anything for money.

133
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,690
l only gave up my job.
Others might give up their honor, too.

134
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,370
Our poverty is better than
affluence without honor.

135
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,670
Does this stolen money
carry any honor?

136
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,750
lf not for me, for the
sake of these children...

137
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,159
- go and return the coat.
- That's not possible!

138
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,129
l'm not such a fool to let
money slip from my hands.

139
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,030
- Open the door!
- Who's there? - Police!

140
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,680
What to do now?
Go and return the coat!

141
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,929
Open the door fast,
or we'll break it down!

142
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,220
Open it immediately,
and don't try to escape!

143
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,700
- What do you want?
- After stealing the coat...

144
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,419
you're asking what we want?

145
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,129
Mr. Ganguly, what should
be done with him?

146
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,640
- Take him to the police station!
- Come on!

147
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:30,290
No! Please don't take him, constable.

148
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,240
He's the sole bread earner
of this house.

149
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,860
Don't take him away!
Take me in his place!

150
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,140
He's the only support of
my children and me!

151
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,290
- But he's committed theft,
and has to be punished. - Yes.

152
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,860
Don't fall at my feet!

153
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,310
- Why are you crying?
- What else can l do?

154
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:09,330
l can't bear to see
a woman crying!

155
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,430
- Let's go.
- Where's the coat?

156
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,380
We'll let him go
only on one condition.

157
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,630
- Give us the coat.
- Yes.

158
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,270
- You first.
- Me?

159
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,449
- Where's the coat?
- Here it is.

160
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,100
Come and sit.

161
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,080
Latch the door.

162
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,580
Turn on the light.

163
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,280
- Where will we put it?
- Let me have it.

164
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,880
- There's a lot of money in it.
- l know, so l'll keep it.

165
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,270
But listen to me, you...

166
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,070
You haven't got the money yet,
but have already changed.

167
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,920
Let me have it for
just two minutes.

168
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,280
lf a dead man is given
clothes worth 20 lakhs...

169
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,010
he'll come alive.
And l'm a living man.

170
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,610
- For just two just minutes.
- Well?

171
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,580
You won't get it!

172
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,690
l won't get it?

173
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,700
ls your head alright?

174
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,040
Someone's knocking on the door.

175
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,300
l thought l was
making that sound.

176
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,409
Who could this new trouble be?

177
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:58,720
l'm coming. Welcome.

178
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,389
Kishore, do you see who's there?

179
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,650
- Two girls.
- Two?

180
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,510
l was seeing four.

181
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,389
Greetings.

182
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,989
Why greet them?
Do you know them?

183
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,570
Let's ask them first.

184
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,310
Who are you?

185
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,580
What are you saying?

186
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,970
l never thought
you'd change so much.

187
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,490
So what's up?

188
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,560
That's what l don't understand.

189
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,960
- Trying to fool me?
- l swear on God...

190
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,330
l never saw them before
in my life.

191
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,310
Then why is that girl
saying such things to you?

192
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,730
That's the weird thing.

193
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,740
Our elders said that trouble
never arrives alone.

194
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,220
Do you see?
There are two of them there!

195
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,300
Just watch. lt'll start
with me, and end with you.

196
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,159
Yes, what can l do for you?

197
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,040
Sister, hasn't he turned
a little thin?

198
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,410
Can't you see? l'm turning
healthy nowadays.

199
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,490
That's why you didn't
reply to our letter.

200
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,139
And didn't come to the
station to receive us.

201
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,510
l have a lot to complain about.

202
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,490
Certainly, but you've come
to the wrong address.

203
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,790
Read it again.

204
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,500
l never thought that you'd
forget me so soon.

205
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,740
While in Poona, you used to bring
me home from college every day.

206
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,300
- But now...
- Wait.

207
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:13,060
- Forget Poona. Where do
l drop you now? - Nowhere.

208
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,210
What do we have to lose?
Let them stay here.

209
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,820
Women always arrive
after the money does.

210
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,620
lf you wish that,
then what can l do?

211
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,680
She's all right,
but why is that girl sad?

212
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,840
She's eyeing you!

213
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,810
Both you and l have
some sort of sorrow

214
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,840
Love without any fear.
Who knows about tomorrow?

215
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,380
l'm afraid!

216
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,490
Sorrow is a reality here,
and happiness a lie

217
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,220
Raise your eyes.
This is such a delightful night

218
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,990
Fill your heart with love
at the very first sight

219
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:56,080
Love without any fear.
Who knows about tomorrow?

220
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,370
l'm afraid!

221
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,850
l don't know the meaning
of happiness or love

222
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,470
Why should you go far?
Love accommodates life

223
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,220
Fill your heart with love
at the very first sight

224
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,190
Love without any fear.
Who knows about tomorrow?

225
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,810
l'm afraid!

226
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,090
Hold me, someone.
Don't let me overflow with sorrow

227
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,640
This night is blessed.
Join your heart with mine

228
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,300
Fill your heart with love
at the very first sight

229
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:17,230
Love without any fear.
Who knows about tomorrow?

230
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,820
l'm afraid!

231
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,159
My heart knows no happiness

232
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,830
Love lies in the exchange of hearts

233
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,480
Fill your heart with love
at the very first sight

234
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,540
Love without any fear.
Who knows about tomorrow?

235
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,310
Both you and l have
some sort of sorrow

236
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,360
Love without any fear.
Who knows about tomorrow?

237
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,969
We are afraid!

238
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,850
l'm feeling sleepy.

239
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,340
She's feeling sleepy.

240
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,580
- You too?
- Yes, l'm feeling sleepy too.

241
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,100
Sister, get up.

242
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,900
- What is it? - Go and find
where they've put the coat.

243
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,550
- They're awake.
- Try at least.

244
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,640
Watch out! There's rupees
20 lakhs in the coat!

245
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,250
lf anyone touches it,
l'll murder him!

246
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,040
Why are you trying
to strangle me?

247
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,100
- l was dreaming.
- Dreaming?

248
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
l'm sleeping lightly.

249
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,020
Where's the coat? ls it safe?
Be careful about it.

250
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:03,220
- Where's the coat?
- Beneath my head. Here it is.

251
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,150
The coat's gone!

252
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,140
You lousy fool!
You're responsible for this!

253
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,910
- What happened?
- Something's certainly happened...

254
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,030
but l don't know what it was.
l'm trying to find out.

255
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,570
Out of gas.
The car won't move.

256
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,540
- Never mind.
- What are you doing?

257
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:11,260
lt can't go forward, so l'm
trying to drive backwards.

258
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,330
lf it can go in reverse,
it can go forward too.

259
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,730
You're right.
What should we do now?

260
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,540
Push it hard.

261
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,300
l've paid what l had to.
l can't pay any more now.

262
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,780
Why not? Do you want to keep
20 lakhs all to yourself?

263
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,250
- Hand me 25%. - You mean,
5 lakhs? - Yes.

264
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,760
- What's the matter, uncle?
- Nothing!

265
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,669
Bihari, take the coat.

266
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,200
Beware! lf you want the coat,
come with 5 lakhs to the place...

267
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,020
where you paid me
money before! Let's go!

268
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,580
- You? - Yes, me.
Are you scared?

269
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,459
- What's there to be
scared of? - Stop!

270
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,850
- l've come for my share.
- You've already got it.

271
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,740
- Get out of my sight!
- Veer Singh!

272
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,710
l know your machinations
very well!

273
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,810
l risked my life for the coat.
Will you enjoy the spoils alone?

274
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,590
Why feel bad?
Everyone's destiny is different.

275
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,419
l've come to change
my destiny today.

276
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,100
lf you want to live,
give me half the share!

277
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,920
l see. Bihari, he wants
half the money.

278
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,210
- Very well.
- Watch out!

279
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:11,230
Hand over the coat quietly,
or you'll suffer.

280
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,409
Give it!

281
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,210
l think l'll have to remain
here till the police arrive.

282
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,959
Go and bring 5,000 rupees
from the safe.

283
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,950
You come with me.

284
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,910
Give it.

285
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,640
- Do you remember the car no?
- Certainly.

286
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,560
- What is it?
- 24-12-BMU

287
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,790
- That's our license number.
- What about the girls' car?

288
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,400
lt was 2 this side,
5 on the other, and...

289
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,090
l forgot it.
Let's do something:

290
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,030
We'll get it from
the telephone directory.

291
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,219
Can you find license numbers
in the telephone directory?

292
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,920
- l made a mistake.
- Boring me for nothing!

293
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,060
Bhaggu, look. lt's the same car!

294
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,880
- lt's not that car.
- lt is!

295
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,580
- That's Smriti and Shashi's car.
- We're chasing them.

296
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,840
- Why are we chasing them?
- Because they have the coat!

297
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,850
- What? The coat?
- Yes!

298
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,759
Hurry up!

299
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,020
Shall we just stand
and do nothing?

300
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,609
You fool, nobody offers
support in trouble.

301
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,610
- Uncle has sent me.
- That's great!

302
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,510
He's asked you to hand over
the coat to me.

303
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,320
ln return, he has
sent 5,000 rupees.

304
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,960
- Five thousand?
- Yes, here it is.

305
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,500
- Where is the coat?
- lt's lying over there.

306
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,040
- Where is it?
- Out there.

307
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,760
- What is it? - l heard the
coat is quite valuable.

308
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,450
- Just 5,000 won't do.
- What?

309
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,450
- But uncle said just that.
- What does he know?

310
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:10,750
- Tell uncle whatever you want.
- Why should l?

311
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,340
Help!

312
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,000
- You duped us and ran away!
- Where's the other one?

313
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,360
Up there. She must be
in trouble. Please help her.

314
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,490
Help!

315
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,210
Who's there?

316
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,220
- So it's you?
- Yes!

317
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,160
Why are you here?

318
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,629
- The helpless woman's cries
brought us here. - Well?

319
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,459
- Then hear the sound
of this too. - Okay.

320
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,480
Hey mister!

321
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,420
The woman's cries made
us come upstairs...

322
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,520
but, hearing your sounds,
we're going downstairs.

323
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,730
- Then go!
- We're going!

324
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,010
- Shame on you!
- Why?

325
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,109
Abandoning a girl in distress,
you're running away?

326
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,090
Don't you feel ashamed?

327
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,890
- What do you say?
- l don't like fighting.

328
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,750
- My limbs are aching.
- She's calling us shameless.

329
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,880
- What do you say?
- l do feel shame.

330
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,450
- Then advance.
- You advance first.

331
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,170
Shall l? Okay.

332
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,730
- Will you leave or not?
- We won't.

333
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,640
- You won't?
- No.

334
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,430
Stop!

335
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,970
- What do you say?
- Let's start!

336
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,650
Uncle, something astounding happened.

337
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,740
What happened?
Did you get the coat?

338
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,040
That man turned out
to be a scoundrel.

339
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,779
Hearing our screams, if these
two men hadn't showed up...

340
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,140
then, in lieu of the coat,
we may have been killed...

341
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,350
and we would have been
tainted forever.

342
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,860
Yes, uncle, these two men
are most upright.

343
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,480
- Upright men?
- That's right.

344
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,339
l think l have...

345
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,060
Seen us before? You're right.

346
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,290
l, too, have seen you before,
but l can't remember.

347
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,049
- What do you say?
- Shut up!

348
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,390
Sorry, sir, at that time
our situation was bad.

349
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,560
- But now, it's a bit warm.
- We're sweating now.

350
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,780
Yes, uncle, they helped us
a lot in procuring the coat.

351
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,520
l understand.

352
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,870
Their very faces reveal
their uprightness.

353
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,080
We're nothing.

354
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,340
lt's your kindness to
consider us upright.

355
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,380
- Where's the coat?
- Give the coat.

356
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,750
Here it is.

357
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,310
We acquired it with difficulty.

358
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,090
lt's the wrong coat.

359
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,390
No, uncle, this is the same coat.

360
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,770
No dear. l've risked
my life for that coat.

361
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,490
Wouldn't l recognize it?
This is a different coat.

362
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,900
You're examining it quickly.
Do it slowly.

363
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:10,200
Put on proper glasses.

364
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,430
These are the right glasses.

365
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,060
l've examined it
lt's not the same coat.

366
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,600
l'm sorry.
You've certainly helped me...

367
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,450
but l couldn't get
what l wanted.

368
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,840
But you've saved the lives
of my nieces, so l thank you.

369
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,939
l'll do for you whatever l can.

370
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,070
When we couldn't get the
right coat, what can we do?

371
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,560
- Let's go, Bhaggu.
- Right.

372
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:52,890
Why do you want to carry that
useless coat? Throw it away.

373
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,020
Throw it away?

374
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:00,160
l'll use it to polish my
boots and scrub the floor.

375
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,590
l'll burn it to light my stove.

376
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,120
lt's robbed us of
our sleep and digestion.

377
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,520
- Why will l throw it away?
Let's go. - Come on.

378
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,900
- That is the same coat.
- Why did you lie then?

379
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,430
l had to.

380
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,410
Two men know about it,
and give us much trouble.

381
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,560
lf they know, too,
they'll also trouble us.

382
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,420
But they aren't like that.

383
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,380
l know they're good men.

384
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,560
But let me, too,
put them to the test.

385
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,899
Like you, if l find
them upright, too...

386
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,350
then what can give us
greater happiness?

387
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,310
Go and first get
the coat from them somehow.

388
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:04,620
After stealing my heart...

389
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:12,120
you're about to leave me

390
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,680
After making me feel you love me...

391
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:26,049
you're about to break
my heart and leave

392
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:34,549
Where are you going,
after stealing my heart?

393
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,660
My beloved, you've entered my heart

394
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:54,160
l don't trust you
or your love at all

395
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,410
Where are you going,
after stealing my heart?

396
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,319
My love, l entreat you.
Please don't go away

397
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,030
Your departure will
make me die

398
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,500
My beloved,
you've entered my heart

399
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,910
l don't trust you
or your love at all

400
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,730
Don't make false
promises to me

401
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,380
Don't harass me, let me go

402
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,640
You invited me to your house,
then threw me out

403
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,440
Where are you going,
after stealing my heart?

404
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:44,200
Come, l'll shower you
with my love

405
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:52,790
l'll offer my heart
and soul to you

406
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,879
My beloved, you've
entered my heart.

407
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,560
l don't trust you
or your love at all

408
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,770
lf this is true,
then l consent

409
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,530
You are mine, and l am yours

410
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,520
You invited me to your house,
then threw me out

411
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,350
Where are you going,
after stealing my heart?

412
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,220
l don't trust you
or your love at all

413
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,799
Why did you help me so much
if you wanted to leave?

414
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,960
Hoping to get the coat back.

415
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,120
- What can l do if l can't
find it? - That means...

416
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,920
lt will be found.

417
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,609
Nothing is impossible to find.

418
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,470
What's the use of getting it
back after 50 years?

419
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,720
Had l found it now...

420
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,450
That means you don't want
to stay here?

421
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,790
l want to.
But it should benefit.

422
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,800
Effort never goes to waste.

423
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:48,290
lf you have sympathy for us...

424
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,220
the result will be good.

425
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,340
Stay here, try you best.
You'll surely find the coat.

426
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,890
Shashi, show him to his room.

427
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,170
What about me?

428
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,100
You also come along.

429
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,790
- You can stay here.
- l see.

430
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,200
- Like it?
- Wow!

431
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:27,670
And look,
if you need anything...

432
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,410
ring this bell. The servant
will be at your service.

433
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,009
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

434
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,170
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

435
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,210
- Nothing.
- Hey buddy!

436
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,049
Did you have to come now?

437
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:57,259
l didn't know the time
because l don't have a watch.

438
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,300
Here's your pyjamas.
And these are for me.

439
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,870
Aren't they nice?

440
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,400
- Are all of you here?
- Yes.

441
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,340
Pandhu, get the chair.

442
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,150
Dhondu, you get that table.

443
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:26,640
Get the table
and that stand too.

444
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,380
Get the easy chair.
Don't forget that.

445
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,550
Where's the bed?

446
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,830
lt must be in the bedroom.
Go and get it.

447
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,940
Don't forget the table lamp.
You go and help him.

448
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,740
Be careful.

449
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,520
Sir, two people
are sleeping on the bed.

450
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,210
What else would be
sleeping there? Animals?

451
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,340
- But where did they come from?
- l don't know.

452
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,830
- Take me there.
- Come.

453
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,609
Be careful.
Don't damage anything.

454
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,759
Hey mister!
Hello!

455
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,050
Hey gentlemen, wake up!

456
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,740
They're sleeping so late.

457
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,550
- What's the matter? - Nothing.
l have to move the furniture.

458
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,319
Kishore, wake up.
They want to move the furniture.

459
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,779
- Move the furniture?
- Yes. - Who are you?

460
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,280
- Who let you in?
- The door was open.

461
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,130
- First tell me who are you?
- Who are we?

462
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,140
We're master's sons-in-law.

463
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,680
He didn't get it. Son-in-law
means daughter's husband.

464
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,680
l know.

465
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:54,830
Listen, your father-in-law
sold this and left for good.

466
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:59,470
- Where did he go?
- He didn't leave his address.

467
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,550
Now do me a favor.
Please leave.

468
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,220
- Well...
- No excuses, please leave.

469
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,400
Pandhu, move the furniture.

470
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,810
- Buddy, they went away.
- But why? - That's what...

471
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,620
They also took our clothes.

472
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,940
And the coat too.

473
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,560
lf they wanted to go, why'd
they take that worthless coat?

474
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,360
Buddy...

475
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,860
What trouble is this?

476
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,540
- Who is she calling?
- l don't know.

477
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:50,320
lf you don't know, how will l?

478
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,930
l'll try to find out.

479
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:58,930
Madam...

480
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,980
What an escape!

481
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,089
She's calling you.

482
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,589
Yes?

483
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,380
Sir, madam has left
this note for you.

484
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,290
She asked me to give it to you
when you woke up.

485
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,060
She has called you immediately.

486
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,290
- lmmediately? - Yes.
- Let's go, Kishore.

487
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:32,500
- But where? - Didn't you hear,
she has called us immediately?

488
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,140
But where has she called us?
We have to find out.

489
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,700
- Excuse me. - Yes. The address
is given in the note.

490
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,640
She has asked you
to come by plane.

491
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,020
You must be under the impression
that we cheated you.

492
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,990
But believe me,
we were unaware of it.

493
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,130
Uncle suddenly decided to leave.

494
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,140
lf you care for me, meet me at
the address mentioned below.

495
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,330
Good. Let's go.
What are you thinking?

496
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,610
From where will we get
the plane fare?

497
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,609
- You're right.
- Fare? - Yes.

498
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,930
She left the money. Here.

499
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,270
She is very sensible, buddy.

500
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,160
Just read the address.

501
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,220
This seems to be overseas.

502
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,080
lt's the address of Madras.

503
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,370
So she landed in Madras.

504
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,830
Welcome!

505
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,520
You're so late.

506
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,620
l went to the airport to meet
you. But you weren't there.

507
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,800
l'm a heart patient, Mr. Naidu.

508
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,919
So we came by train.

509
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,120
Muthu, take the luggage inside.

510
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,820
Please come inside.

511
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,860
Buddy, this is a big problem.
What do we do now?

512
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,480
Now that we've come here,
we have to do something.

513
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,790
Think about what should we do.

514
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,920
That's why l'm here.

515
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,930
You've come at a good time.

516
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,920
Today is my wife's birthday.

517
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,440
We've arranged a big celebration.

518
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,770
- Really?
- Yes.

519
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,180
Please be seated.

520
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,859
By leaving the work inside,
you're wasting time?

521
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,280
Madam, l am old now.

522
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,760
l was toiling away all night.

523
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:01,200
You want to hog, but when
it comes to work, you're old.

524
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,040
lt's your birthday today.
What can l do all alone?

525
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:08,780
Don't you get paid for it?
You have to do it.

526
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,300
Do it if you like.
Or you may leave.

527
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,370
lf l leave,
then who will do this work?

528
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,700
Madam, we're looking for work.

529
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,820
Can we get work?

530
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,110
The servants are ready.
Look.

531
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,770
What do you say?
Leave if you want to.

532
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,870
This is what l get for my service?
Now God will see to it.

533
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,360
You've rendered me jobless!

534
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,360
- Will you be happy?
- Get lost!

535
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,259
You'll get Rs.5 monthly
and two square meals.

536
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,560
- The work should be good.
ls that okay? - Okay.

537
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,290
Buddy, where have we landed?

538
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:53,229
lf this woman asks me anything,
what will l say?

539
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:57,000
This language is very easy.

540
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,320
lf she asks something, say...

541
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,299
Pronounce is like this.

542
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:12,360
- Put it there.
- Okay, madam.

543
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,130
Come here.

544
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,509
- What's your name?
- Aama (Yes).

545
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,140
- What's your name?
- Seri (Okay).

546
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,800
- What's your name?
- Aama.

547
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:28,390
- Are you crazy?
- Seri.

548
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:31,710
- You think l'm crazy?
- Aama.

549
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,390
What do you want, madam?
You go.

550
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,420
- What is it, madam?
- l asked him his name.

551
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,080
His name is Gopalswamy and l
am Krishnaswamy. What is it?

552
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,760
Okay, come along.

553
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:52,510
How will l handle everything
all alone?

554
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,190
lt's a grant function.

555
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:58,420
We'll plan this in the morning.

556
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:27,770
Oh beloved, where do you go?

557
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,430
Long is the journey of our love

558
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,220
Romantic is the atmosphere,
crazy is my heart

559
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,690
lt's unfair
to be in one's senses

560
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,430
This is the world of our love

561
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,259
Long is
the journey of our love

562
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,770
When l remember you...

563
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:09,180
this starry night
will torment me

564
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:13,520
How must l bear the sorrow
of our separation?

565
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,400
Long is
the journey of our separation

566
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:27,370
Oh beloved, where do you go?

567
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,520
l think this coat
will travel beyond Madras.

568
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:47,990
That's what l think.

569
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,589
lt's getting out of our hands.

570
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:54,860
Brother, l think
we should tell the master.

571
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:59,970
You always make
a stupid suggestion.

572
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,880
- ln the bag.
- Where's the bag?

573
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,110
- lt was here, uncle.
- Here?

574
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,200
Krishnaswamy!
Gopalswamy!

575
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,200
Someone is calling out to us.
Let's go and see.

576
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,460
Where are the moustaches?

577
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,549
l've put it there.

578
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,540
- Where is Mr. Naidu? - Aama.
- Mr. Naidu isn't here.

579
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,919
- Meaning?
- Mr. Naidu is not here.

580
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,029
He's not here?
Now what?

581
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,570
Whatever God wills.

582
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,259
Want water?

583
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,870
With language, you've also
changed your moustaches?

584
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,710
- What's he saying?
- Our moustaches.

585
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,770
Our moustaches are switched.

586
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,410
Okay now?

587
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:40,500
Stop pretending.
l recognized both of you.

588
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,380
Why are you coming towards us?

589
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,160
Where are you pushing me?

590
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,730
Good that l met you, Kishore.

591
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:56,660
Naidu took away my coat.
Please help me, son.

592
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,610
l'm very ashamed of myself.

593
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,630
You are only ashamed.

594
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:05,410
- But we've faced a big loss.
Right, buddy? - Absolutely.

595
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:07,370
Now we can't help you.

596
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,520
We helped you once, and had
to come down to Madras.

597
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,660
Now do you want to banish us?

598
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,200
l put my life at stake
for that coat.

599
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,730
l promise you that if l find
that coat, l'll do as you say

600
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,800
- What say, buddy?
- Okay.

601
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,290
- Okay.
- Very good!

602
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,480
Change your clothes
and get ready quickly.

603
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:50,360
Here. Go to the station
and search for Naidu.

604
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,000
Don't let him escape.

605
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,300
We'll join you in a short while.
Hurry up.

606
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,779
Listen...

607
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:02,230
Didn't l tell you he'd surely come?

608
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,540
Even he has come.

609
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,090
Look dear, you both
also get ready quickly.

610
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,220
We will have to leave
as soon as we get the message.

611
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,520
Okay, uncle.

612
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,339
Greetings.

613
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:33,710
Greetings.

614
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,530
Where are you going, sir?

615
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,300
Where do you belong?

616
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,590
My name is Naidu.

617
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,140
Your name?

618
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,850
What do you do, sir?

619
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,640
My lord!

620
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,670
Why are you silent?

621
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:03,990
Why don't you speak?

622
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,980
Speak! Say something.

623
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,620
Talk to me.

624
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,510
lf you don't talk to me,
l'll go crazy.

625
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,080
Two tickets?

626
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:44,470
- One for me, and one for him.
- Who?

627
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,640
- He is my uncle.
- l see!

628
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,290
He goes insane sometimes.

629
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,059
So we're taking him
to an asylum.

630
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:56,700
- l see! - Don't you see
how he is behaving?

631
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,940
Be careful.

632
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:07,540
- Sir!
- Don't be afraid.

633
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,090
lf ever you need me,
l'll be there.

634
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:12,090
Relax.

635
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,960
- ls that okay?
- Yes.

636
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,250
- Sir!
- Everything will be alright.

637
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,030
l hope so!

638
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,400
ln love with wealth

639
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:35,820
What have you done?

640
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:43,910
You forgot your love

641
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:49,080
What have you done?

642
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,809
Meet the eyes of your beloved

643
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,160
Enjoy the intoxication

644
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:24,639
Lose your heart to someone.
Enjoy your life

645
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:39,610
Forsake the greed for wealth

646
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:43,710
Get lost in love

647
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:49,020
And in the sea of beauty...

648
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:54,710
drown yourself

649
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,430
- Then...
- Forget yourself

650
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:09,590
Enjoy the monsoon

651
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,940
Meet the eyes of your beloved.
Enjoy the intoxication

652
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:38,570
Don't ever get drawn
towards wealth

653
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:48,230
Don't embrace this death

654
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,620
Life is too short

655
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,180
Enjoy it

656
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:19,240
Meet the eyes of your beloved.
Enjoy the intoxication

657
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:24,180
Lose your heart for someone.
Enjoy your life

658
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:40,450
With wealth you want to quench
the thirst of your heart

659
01:13:53,770 --> 01:14:02,470
Get carried away by love

660
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:11,389
lf you crave for love...

661
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:23,370
enjoy this feeling

662
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,480
Lose your heart for someone.
Enjoy your life

663
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:49,820
Good Lord!
You sing so melodiously.

664
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,390
Your song has brought
peace to my soul.

665
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:58,580
Mr. Naidu, your soul will
find more peace now.

666
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,570
Have this.

667
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:04,690
Have it.

668
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:11,040
Sir, wake up.
The train is at the station.

669
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,620
- Which station?
- Howrah.

670
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:21,850
Both are missing.

671
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:28,660
Bhaggu, wake up.
We're at Howrah.

672
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,900
We have to go to Calcutta.

673
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:35,049
- Howrah is in Calcutta.
- So we're here?

674
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,970
Yes.
Where is Mr. Naidu?

675
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:45,850
He tricked us and escaped.

676
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,470
We don't even know the address.

677
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,690
l recall the address a little.

678
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,710
He was saying a number
on the phone.

679
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,760
Exclude one.

680
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,260
Exclude four.

681
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,509
What remains? 23.

682
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,550
And now...

683
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,360
Exclude Geeta. Baliganj.

684
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,780
His name is...

685
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,000
No.

686
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,099
No way.

687
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,280
You got the 'jee',
but the first half isn't right.

688
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,830
Sir, is it Banerjee?

689
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,179
- Banerjee! - Yes.
- Where does he live?

690
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:18,940
- l don't know.
- How did you know the name?

691
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:22,250
l suggested a surname
with a 'jee'.

692
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:25,400
Here's your reward.

693
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,430
- Sir!
- Give that to him.

694
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,690
Dear, have you
put the coat away safely?

695
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:40,990
Yes, father.
l put it in my cupboard.

696
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,380
Ask her to put it
in the safe.

697
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,820
Naidu, don't worry.
You've done a great job.

698
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:53,670
Nobody would be able to do
what you've done.

699
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,830
This is nothing.

700
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,969
Just watch what l do.

701
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:10,750
When will you
shower your grace?

702
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:16,059
Oh my Lord

703
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:01,510
What is our sin,
Why did you ignore us?

704
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:31,490
My life is in
devotion to you

705
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:40,310
l suffer

706
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:55,690
When will you bless us?

707
01:19:56,350 --> 01:20:00,320
Oh my beloved

708
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,190
Sage, you?

709
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,210
Don't you know him?

710
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,440
He is Gurudev.

711
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:39,209
- But we...
- You will recognize me, dear.

712
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,669
My Guru is meditating.

713
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,469
So l have come today.

714
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:50,690
You are great!

715
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,440
Bless you, son.

716
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,580
Bless you, dear.

717
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,580
Don't just stand there.
Seek his blessings.

718
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:07,670
Not mine.
First take his blessings.

719
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,589
Son, is your name Naidu?

720
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:17,570
- How do you know my name?
- l know it.

721
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,420
You're going to be lucky.

722
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,710
Oh Lord!

723
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,150
Gurudev, l didn't recognize me.

724
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,910
You will recognize him.

725
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:29,960
When he seeks meditation,
you will recognize me too.

726
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,920
Please come inside.

727
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,470
Lady, he won't have sweets.

728
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:44,790
He doesn't like sweets.

729
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:47,010
Bring him a meal.

730
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,650
Excuse me.

731
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:24,870
Lady, he's fasting today.

732
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:27,910
So he won't eat anything.
Give it to me.

733
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:38,460
Make a glass of buttermilk
for him with half a glass of water.

734
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,380
So that the day
passes away peacefully.

735
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,240
You care for me so much.

736
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,890
After all l am your pupil.

737
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,690
At least you could
let me have water.

738
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:04,360
Today is your fast.

739
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,420
Hail the Lord.

740
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:21,920
l will have to spend Rs.5600
to reach there.

741
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,730
Never mind.
That's a very small amount.

742
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:31,990
lf you're lucky,
you'll get Rs.3,000,000.

743
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:49,430
You?

744
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,420
My heart told me.

745
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:58,190
What did your heart say?

746
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,590
- Sage.
- Speak.

747
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:13,660
Do you know why l have
come to you at this hour?

748
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,450
l know everything.

749
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:20,080
This starry night, this room,
and me...

750
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,200
Don't talk like that.

751
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:27,730
l know what's going on
in your mind.

752
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,490
That's your illusion.
Suppress your desires.

753
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:35,080
Be devoted to God.
You will be blessed.

754
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,760
ls that okay?

755
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,549
- But...
- Enough. God forgives sins.

756
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:47,650
And there's no age limit
to be devoted to God.

757
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,200
- ls that okay, my Lord?
- lt's okay, son.

758
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:53,890
Did you hear that, dear?

759
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,400
You are great.
l heard that.

760
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:01,089
You helped me to understand.
l was about to commit a sin.

761
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:05,000
- You saved me.
- What are you doing?

762
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,519
No, dear, you weren't
going to commit any sin.

763
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,849
lt's all because of that black
coat which is in this house.

764
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:17,880
But God knows what will happen
to this house by morning.

765
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:19,990
Again!

766
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,400
Understand, dear?

767
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:25,580
l understand. Since that coat
has been in this house...

768
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,200
we lost a servant.

769
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:30,640
Mother sent a cable
that she's unwell.

770
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,559
This coat is jinxed.

771
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:39,940
That's right. Two witches, a demon,
and fifteen others want to get it.

772
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:44,960
Dear, burn it or tear it.
But don't keep it in this house.

773
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:48,550
And if you're unable to do that,
give that coat to me.

774
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:51,190
l'll turn it to ashes.

775
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:54,440
You've done a great job.

776
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,520
- Here. ls this the one?
- Yes, this is the one.

777
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:03,930
Close your eyes. l'll show
you the magic of this coat.

778
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:15,930
You've done a great job. lt was
difficult getting this coat back.

779
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:19,790
l didn't do anything, uncle.
lt was all Bhaggu's idea.

780
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,390
Bhaggu?
But where is he?

781
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,360
- Downstairs. He's coming
in his real form. - l see!

782
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,650
- What's up?
- l was changing.

783
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,050
- You?
- Yes, it's me.

784
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:46,040
That was a nice disguise.

785
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:48,179
Everyone is praising you.

786
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,160
Empty praise is of no use.

787
01:26:55,050 --> 01:27:02,400
lf anybody praises me sincerely,
l can do ... anything.

788
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:07,680
Really? So you haven't found
anyone like that?

789
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:13,610
l regret that for whom we are
doing all this, is unaware of it.

790
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:20,250
- Do you have any problem?
- Yes.

791
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:37,270
Your eyes pierced my heart

792
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:43,990
This is the saga of our love

793
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:50,440
Hearing your name,
l went crazy

794
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:57,470
You've been in my heart
for a long time

795
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:24,010
When our eyes met,
my heart blossomed

796
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:38,980
When l met you,
my heart had no complaints

797
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,259
My heart sighed

798
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:47,710
Your eyes pierced my heart

799
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:16,160
l'm not in my senses

800
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:21,080
What spell have you cast?

801
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:38,300
You stole my heart
at first sight, oh beauty

802
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:45,280
Hearing your name,
l went crazy

803
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:13,470
Now that we've united,
we'll never part

804
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:18,390
Reside in my eyes,
in my heart

805
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:35,519
Your style can kill

806
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:42,580
Your eyes pierced my heart

807
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,630
l'm lost in your love

808
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:11,450
l forgot the world for you

809
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:27,950
Don't forget me.
Your love is all l have

810
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:34,530
Hearing your name,
l went crazy

811
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:46,880
Your eyes pierced my heart

812
01:31:58,690 --> 01:31:59,990
What is this?

813
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:03,450
You act so well.

814
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:06,080
Why don't you say
this to uncle?

815
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:10,660
- lf l ask uncle, you know
what he'll say? - What?

816
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:14,160
Get lost!
Wants to marry her, indeed!

817
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,450
You dream so high.

818
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:19,630
l'll never allow you
to marry my child.

819
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,910
Get out of my house.

820
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,650
l say it in English.

821
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,590
He'll say this.

822
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:34,630
Uncle!

823
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,690
Please get the doctor.

824
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:40,650
- Where are you going?
- To get the doctor. - Why?

825
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:42,670
Uncle is breathing his last,
l'm going for the doctor.

826
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:43,950
Let's go.

827
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:51,010
Leave me! Let me die.

828
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:54,860
- Why did you save me?
- What were you doing, uncle?

829
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,690
l don't want to see this
disgrace with my own eyes.

830
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:01,170
- What disgrace?
- What disgrace!

831
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,430
After brother's death, l brought
you up like my own daughter.

832
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:11,350
l looked after you
like a father.

833
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,820
And this is
what l get in return?

834
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:17,440
One sings songs with someone.

835
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:19,670
One chats with the other.

836
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:23,230
lt's better to die than witness this.

837
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,830
But you promised them, uncle.

838
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:30,320
They brought the coat back,
risking their lives.

839
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:33,040
Now it's your turn
to keep your promise.

840
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:38,180
My promise is not greater
than your welfare.

841
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:42,830
Had l not lured them,
they wouldn't have returned...

842
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:45,490
that coat
which was in their custody.

843
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,170
Earlier, too, you fraudulently
brought them to Madras.

844
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:56,019
lf they hadn't cared for us,
and only wanted the coat...

845
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,520
why travel to Madras from Bombay?

846
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:03,759
So now you consider me a fraud?

847
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:08,560
lsn't that enough humiliation?

848
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:16,269
l faced so many problems
for your sake.

849
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:19,470
And you think l'm a fraud?

850
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,390
Anyway.

851
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:30,610
l just wanted to keep
you away from those loafers.

852
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:41,970
lf you think l'm
greedy for your wealth...

853
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:44,549
then here's your coat.

854
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:51,730
Uncle!

855
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,490
Uncle!

856
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:58,760
Uncle!
What are you doing?

857
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,590
- Let me die. - We don't
have anyone except you.

858
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:06,270
Who else can think of
our welfare better than you?

859
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:11,330
lf they really love you,
they will trace you.

860
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,889
Only then l'll agree that they
don't love your wealth...

861
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,339
but truly love you.

862
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,380
Then l'll agree
to whatever you say.

863
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:20,879
So what are we
supposed to do, uncle?

864
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:24,429
- Pack your things quickly.
- Okay. Let's go.

865
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:36,710
Please come.

866
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,900
Kishore, uncle is gone!

867
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,550
What are you saying?

868
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:50,180
Can't you see,
he's covered with a sheet?

869
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:55,870
He could go if he wanted to.
We wouldn't stop him.

870
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:59,130
But he should have at least
fulfilled his promise.

871
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:01,910
Kishore, he is gone!

872
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:06,210
Wait, don't be afraid.
Let me examine the patient.

873
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,980
Now what's the use, doctor?

874
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:15,840
Now that he's dead...

875
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:17,339
What nonsense is this!

876
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,780
Pillows!

877
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,070
- What's this?
- l got it.

878
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:27,720
Uncle has deceived us
for the third time.

879
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,580
Anyway, never mind.

880
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:36,690
Doctor, since the patient is
missing, why should we pay you?

881
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:42,860
We, like fools, brought you here.

882
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,860
Here's your fee. Rs. 10.

883
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:52,230
Can you manage with half?

884
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:54,440
Alright?

885
01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:58,309
l saved Rs. 5.

886
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:03,300
- What is it? - l think
they are Shashi and Smriti.

887
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:05,250
How can Shashi and Smriti
come here?

888
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:07,370
They're preparing to go overseas.

889
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,950
- Overseas?
- Yes, they're going by plane.

890
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:13,170
- How do you know?
- l inquired at the airport.

891
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:18,040
- What do we do now?
- Follow them.

892
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:38,870
Excellent performance!

893
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:40,940
This is your reward.

894
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:48,509
Escort our guests to
the royal guest room.

895
01:42:53,230 --> 01:42:54,429
Please come.

896
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,660
Wait. Can you tell us where
the royal guest room is?

897
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:09,530
- Why? - We want to
meet our new guests.

898
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:11,690
You can't meet them.

899
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:15,020
- Why? - Aren't we allowed to
go to the royal guest room?

900
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:19,810
You can't go to the place
where they are at the moment.

901
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,160
- What do you mean?
- Where are they now?

902
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:23,490
ln prison.

903
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,940
Sir, l think you're mistaken.

904
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:28,700
Mr. Mallick had asked you
to take us to the guest room.

905
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,760
But you brought
us to the prison.

906
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,320
You're fortunate.

907
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:35,040
Very strange.
What's going on?

908
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,950
All those who please
Mr. Mallick are sent here.

909
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:43,019
lf that's the case
then please tell him...

910
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:46,650
that we don't
approve of this place.

911
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:48,889
Where are you going?

912
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:50,730
You'll be killed if
you try to escape.

913
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,500
Lock them in.

914
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,059
Uncle, what have you done?

915
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:07,890
Why? What happened?

916
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:12,070
Why did you send
them to the jail?

917
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:14,300
Jail? How do you know that?

918
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:17,830
Uncle, please don't try
to hide anything from us.

919
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:21,519
You're being unjust to them.

920
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:27,360
You know nothing. At times we
are forced to do such things.

921
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:30,280
But this is unfair.

922
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:34,420
They risked their
lives to save us...

923
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:37,040
and you've put
them in the dungeon?

924
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:41,320
But all this is
for your benefit.

925
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:46,960
You just don't know that
people are just after our money.

926
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,849
But Kishore and Bhaggu
aren't like that.

927
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:51,910
They're very decent.

928
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:57,269
That's not to be
judged by one's face.

929
01:44:58,210 --> 01:44:59,950
How are we to know
their intentions?

930
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:03,540
l'm sure they're innocent.

931
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:06,340
l've seen more of
this world, child.

932
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:09,090
But this time you're mistaken.

933
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,470
Yes, allow us to
make our own decisions.

934
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:14,620
But l'm still alive.

935
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,380
As long as l'm alive
l won't let you do that.

936
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,889
We've gone through a
lot because of that.

937
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,240
We've always trusted you.

938
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,020
But you never let
us have peace of mind.

939
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:28,390
ls that the way
you think of me?

940
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:30,860
Am l not responsible
for your safety.

941
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:34,460
We'll take care of ourselves.

942
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:38,070
lf we're destined
to be disappointed...

943
01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:40,370
then so be it.

944
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:42,050
But you can't deceive us now.

945
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:43,230
Silence.

946
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,879
Take them to their room.
And keep an eye on them.

947
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:52,160
Uncle.

948
01:45:56,910 --> 01:46:02,480
Whisky, brandy
or something else?

949
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:08,260
Buddy, he'll land us in trouble.

950
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:14,889
- Listen...
- Be polite to him.

951
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:18,920
- Your...
- Majesty... - Majesty.

952
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:22,810
- My dear...
- Sir... - Sir.

953
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,490
- Honorable...
- Sire... - Sire.

954
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:30,669
We do not drink.

955
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,510
We would rather prefer
some soft drinks.

956
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:39,700
- Soft drink? And you?
- Even l'll drink.

957
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:47,240
Both of you? Then l'll
serve you the royal drink.

958
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:51,750
- Did you understand? - No.
- And you?

959
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:54,099
l'll bring the
royal drink for you.

960
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:02,200
Now l understand.
Buddy, l think he's mad.

961
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:05,840
- What are you saying?
- Didn't you hear what he said?

962
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:08,960
He said...

963
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:12,260
What's going to happen now?

964
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:31,670
Here's your drink.

965
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:37,129
A single sip... and
you'll be in the heavens!

966
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,600
Here's your glass.

967
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:45,420
Take it.
This is for you.

968
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:09,590
Drink it.
Wait!

969
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:12,250
l forgot the ice.

970
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:15,190
You are making it chilled?

971
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,190
Now you can have it.

972
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:31,559
Buddy, we are in such a mess.

973
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,129
Drink it soon
or you'll annoy him.

974
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:35,780
l'll not drink it.

975
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:40,660
You're drinking it?

976
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:54,889
ls it really good?

977
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:11,930
Did you like the drink?

978
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:14,820
lt was excellent.

979
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:19,630
What to say?
lt's mindblowing!

980
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:27,220
Okay tell me,
are you interested in music?

981
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:33,080
He's talking about
song and dance.

982
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:40,040
Of course, but we're helpless.
We don't have the instruments.

983
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:43,870
Oh no, there's no such
thing as helplessness.

984
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,179
in this heaven of ours.

985
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:49,470
You can get anything you want.
Do you want the instruments?

986
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:54,000
Yes. You can bring
any instrument you want.

987
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:56,610
- What do you say?
- Yes, of course.

988
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:08,259
You take this and
this is for you.

989
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:32,670
lt seems like a fantasy.

990
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,480
Let's start.

991
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:45,620
This one seems to be a tabla.

992
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:50,940
Now you try it.

993
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:58,320
Kishore, l think
there's some magic in it.

994
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:01,570
l can't see anything,
but l can play the instruments.

995
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:03,889
- Shall we play?
- Yes.

996
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:09,170
- Ready? One...
- Two...

997
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:45,710
Now l really feel that
we're in the heaven.

998
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:47,850
You're great Mr. Mallick.

999
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:51,690
How dare you mention
the name of that cheat?

1000
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:55,060
- Who took his name?
- He did.

1001
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:58,349
- l took his name.
- Did you? - Yes.

1002
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:04,620
Why are you strangling me?
l just took his name.

1003
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,920
l won't spare you!

1004
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:10,610
Silence!

1005
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:13,880
Okay.

1006
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,900
Buddy, it's rather strange!

1007
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:28,900
Strange. Uncle is rather smart.

1008
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,080
He was with us a
few moments ago...

1009
01:52:31,230 --> 01:52:33,570
and now he's here?

1010
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:36,960
From where have you come?

1011
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:43,809
Uncle, you know everything.

1012
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,620
l know everything.

1013
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:49,170
Who else but you
will know everything?

1014
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:51,650
You made us roam
all around the world.

1015
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,760
From Mumbai to Madras,
Madras to Calcutta.

1016
01:52:55,090 --> 01:52:56,720
And finally we reached here.

1017
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:58,590
You even gave
us false promises.

1018
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,410
That means even you were
deceived by that cheat!

1019
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:09,500
A person who could
deceive his own brother...

1020
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,990
can't he deceive others?

1021
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:17,040
But we didn't get you.

1022
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:21,700
This is a case of
mistaken identity.

1023
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:24,650
l'm not Jwalaprasad.

1024
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:28,260
l'm his younger brother, Badriprasad.

1025
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:32,680
Okay. But spare
me a moment, sir.

1026
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:38,300
Could you please tell us
how many of you there are?

1027
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:42,700
So that things
would be easier for us.

1028
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,300
We had one more brother.

1029
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:48,580
Hanuman Prasad.

1030
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:52,960
But Jwala Prasad
had him killed.

1031
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:56,300
- Really?
- Yes.

1032
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,530
But he had two daughters.

1033
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:07,540
l wonder where
they are now.

1034
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:11,970
- Two girls? Buddy. - Yes.
- Perhaps its Shashi or Smriti.

1035
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:16,880
Yes, you're right.
How do you know them?

1036
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:18,980
Where did you meet them?

1037
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:23,690
Please tell me. They are
my late brother's daughters.

1038
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:27,269
Don't worry. Both of them
are here with Jwalaprasad.

1039
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,390
- ls Jwalaprasad here?
- Yes.

1040
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,150
Let him come.
But he won't get anything.

1041
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:38,960
The coat for which
he desperately searches...

1042
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:40,990
has nothing in it.

1043
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:43,589
How is this possible?

1044
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:45,190
l learned two things.

1045
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,200
lt was clearly mentioned in that
letter that half the map...

1046
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:52,340
to our secret treasure
trove is in this coat...

1047
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:56,060
and the other
half is with you.

1048
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:00,900
But unless we get the other
half, we are helpless.

1049
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:02,680
l suspect your younger brother.

1050
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,230
Please don't lose
heart, Mr. Mallick.

1051
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:11,410
l'm sure that
we'll find the map.

1052
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:14,470
- Sir?
- What is it?

1053
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,490
- The prisoners escaped.
- Escaped? - Yes sir.

1054
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:20,120
Even our guests escaped.

1055
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:22,090
That's bad news.

1056
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,650
Buddy, the door
closed on its own.

1057
01:55:46,190 --> 01:55:47,389
What now?

1058
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:53,060
This isn't a palace.
This is a haunted house.

1059
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:57,490
This is the other guest house.

1060
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:00,900
What's happening?

1061
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:01,740
- Buddy, did you hear that?
- Yes. - What did he say?

1062
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:05,599
Perhaps they're ordering
refreshments for us.

1063
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,540
Why is he looking up?

1064
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:24,840
Buddy, is this what
you call refreshments?

1065
01:57:27,110 --> 01:57:28,809
Perhaps they'll entertain us
on a swing.

1066
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,020
Swing for us?

1067
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,350
lt's the noose.

1068
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,730
We'll die swinging!

1069
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:45,920
- Kishore, he's calling you.
- No, he's calling you.

1070
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:51,690
Which one of us do you want?

1071
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:55,560
Think about it.
Don't do this.

1072
01:57:57,150 --> 01:58:02,469
Who? Me?

1073
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:10,759
Kishore, my days are numbered.

1074
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:13,780
lt's destiny.

1075
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:16,450
ls this my destiny?

1076
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:18,490
lt's being forced on me.

1077
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:22,600
How can l accept this?
Anyway, there's nothing l can do.

1078
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:27,070
l'm your friend.
l'll have to die for you.

1079
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:31,570
Buddy, this is
an unexpected death.

1080
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:36,210
- There's a chance of
rebirth, right? - Right.

1081
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:40,040
ln case we're born again...

1082
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:48,150
please don't be my friend.

1083
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:51,300
Buddy, l have
the same request of you.

1084
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:53,080
That's even better.

1085
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:55,510
Good bye.

1086
01:58:57,430 --> 01:59:05,530
Go my dear friend.
Die a peaceful death.

1087
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:09,080
Great, my friend,
who's so concerned about me.

1088
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,099
- Bhaggu...
- Kishore...

1089
01:59:48,650 --> 01:59:51,089
- You're leaving me alone.
- Yes, l'm going

1090
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:56,390
You're bidding adieu to this world

1091
01:59:57,260 --> 02:00:00,630
l'm leaving this
world of deception

1092
02:01:01,890 --> 02:01:05,750
There's no reason to be alive

1093
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:09,820
Though no fault of mine,
l've been punished

1094
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:13,930
Strange are the ways of life

1095
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:18,180
For friendship, l can
even sacrifice my life

1096
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:23,130
Buddy, it's time to bid adieu.
May god be with you

1097
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:07,570
What's a life full of fear?

1098
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:11,310
He's no man,
if he's afraid of death

1099
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:15,430
No one is immortal

1100
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:19,620
You are brave.
Die a martyr's death

1101
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:24,670
Death has come uninvited,
through no fault of mine

1102
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:08,710
A martyr l'll become today

1103
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:13,040
l, too, will lose a
good friend like you

1104
02:03:13,170 --> 02:03:17,210
Your turn will soon come, buddy

1105
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:21,420
There you are right, my friend

1106
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:23,900
You be the leader

1107
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:26,030
l'll be right behind you

1108
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:33,220
Oh, so you almost managed
to escape from here too?

1109
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:44,010
Let the fat one
be the first to die.

1110
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:58,559
- Buddy. - Yes.
- There's no escape now.

1111
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:00,360
Even Mr. Mallick is here.

1112
02:05:01,690 --> 02:05:03,990
- Kishore...
- Yes.

1113
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:08,590
Hurry up.

1114
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,540
Mr. Mallick.

1115
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:20,130
Mallick! Who called
out to that cheat?

1116
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:27,480
Where is he?
Where is that cheat?

1117
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:31,540
You scoundrel!

1118
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,260
Where is Mallick?

1119
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:52,690
Mr. Mallick, there he is.

1120
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:57,680
- What are you staring at?
- You took his name?

1121
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:06,550
Buddy, what will happen now?

1122
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,960
Buddy, l think
our death is near.

1123
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:20,730
Before that do something
or you'll regret it.

1124
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:23,330
- What should l do?
- Let's start.

1125
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:58,000
- Catch him. Where is he?
- There he is.

1126
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:06,880
Stop. You sit down.

1127
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:09,160
Come on.

1128
02:07:11,170 --> 02:07:13,980
- Hurry up. - Catch him.
Don't let him escape.

1129
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:35,680
He's gone too.

1130
02:07:36,970 --> 02:07:38,170
Let's go!

1131
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:23,470
Kill both of them.

1132
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:28,059
Arrest them.

1133
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:44,810
Stop!

1134
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:48,200
Beware!

1135
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:00,290
- Come on, fatso.
- He's the man...

1136
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:06,230
who kept us in the dungeon
for four years.

1137
02:09:07,370 --> 02:09:09,760
And he murdered his own brother.

1138
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:16,900
Jwalaprasad made
their lives a hell.

1139
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:18,590
Arrest them!

1140
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:21,830
We were in search of them too.
Actually we even got...

1141
02:09:22,070 --> 02:09:24,969
a summons from lndia
to arrest them.

1142
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:27,910
You're under arrest.
Take them.

1143
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:41,299
Mr. Badriprasad,
l've not deceived you.

1144
02:09:42,650 --> 02:09:44,879
On the contrary, l was helpless.

1145
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:47,640
But now's the right time...

1146
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:50,450
to return this to you.

1147
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:54,030
Here's the other half of the map.

1148
02:09:54,110 --> 02:09:58,410
Map? What are you saying?

1149
02:09:58,610 --> 02:10:01,540
You know very well
that without this...

1150
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:05,790
you'll never be able
to reach the hidden treasure.

1151
02:10:05,890 --> 02:10:07,090
You're right.

1152
02:10:07,450 --> 02:10:11,320
And this map is a
testimony to my innocence.

1153
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,139
Mr. Mallick!

1154
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:21,240
Keep this.
This belongs to you.

1155
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:24,320
No Uncle, we just
want to be with them.

1156
02:10:40,270 --> 02:10:42,950
You both? You are here again.

1157
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:47,510
- Where's your uncle?
- ln police custody.

1158
02:10:48,530 --> 02:10:53,280
What? Then what
are you doing here?

1159
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,419
Another conspiracy against us?

1160
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:58,059
No, there's nothing like that.

1161
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:01,219
What are you saying?

1162
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:03,200
Great!

1163
02:11:51,090 --> 02:11:53,750
Hey mister, this is your world

1164
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:00,270
Explore the secret of happiness.
The world is a mystery

1165
02:12:28,170 --> 02:12:31,980
Devoid of compassion is this world.
So selfish is this world

1166
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:34,840
But, hey mister, remember
it's still not without love

1167
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:46,190
- Listen to me, buddy.
- Tell me, pal

1168
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:26,790
lf you have the passion...

1169
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:30,630
this world is yours, remember that

1170
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:50,620
Hey Kishu, this world is yours

1171
02:13:54,730 --> 02:13:57,389
Hey Bhaggu, this world is yours

1172
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:11,940
Why worry, my friend?
Your destination is just here

1173
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:15,750
Leave life on your own terms,
for this world is yours

1174
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:24,170
- Listen to me buddy.
- Tell me, pal

1175
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:28,780
Explore the secret of happiness.
The world is a mystery

1176
