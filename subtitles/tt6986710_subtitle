<i><b><font color="#FF8000">Extracted</font> by <font color="#00FF00">NARACHI</font></b></i>

2
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
Who should be our leader?
Soniaji and no other.

3
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,520
- Long live...
- Sonia Gandhi.

4
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,960
- Long live...
- Sonia Gandhi.

5
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,680
No more questions.

6
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,680
You will all come to know tomorrow.

7
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,000
Ma'am, just one question! Please!

8
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,880
The BJP has lost this election.

9
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,120
But maybe they are
not ready to admit.

10
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
They are strongly opposing
Sonia Gandhi's ascend

11
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
to the Prime Minister's post

12
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,560
and constantly demonstrating
against her.

13
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
Sir, what is your opinion?

14
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,800
These are baseless arguments.

15
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Sonia ma'am has won the election.

16
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,360
So she will be the PM.

17
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,680
There is no scope
for debate in this, Rahul.

18
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,880
It's pretty simple and clear.

19
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,040
We have won this election
under the leadership of Ma'am.

20
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,920
And she shall be PM.

21
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,160
This is a land where great sages,

22
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,520
ascetics, saints,
and learned men want to be born.

23
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,800
But Sonia Gandhi refused to accept this
country as her homeland for 16 years.

24
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
The ordeal that my...

25
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
grandma,

26
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
and father had to go through

27
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,320
can you guarantee my mother

28
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
won't face the same consequences.

29
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,640
This is our family matter.

30
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
I admit you're perfectly
right in your own way.

31
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,280
But you must understand,
every party worker

32
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,840
wants to see
Sonia ma'am as the PM.

33
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,600
This is more than
a family matter now.

34
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,720
A person who had to accept
citizenship of this country

35
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,240
due to constitutional compulsion
and not because she wanted to.

36
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,160
Are they unable to find a leader,

37
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,920
born in this country, to lead us.

38
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,840
We don't want a foreigner
as our Prime Minister.

39
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,200
And, I won't let it happen.

40
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,840
With all due respect, Mr Kapil,
please don't teach me politics.

41
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,960
Friends.

42
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,560
For the last 6 years,

43
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,800
one thing has been pretty clear
in my mind.

44
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,920
And I've often mentioned

45
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,360
that my goal is not
the Prime Minister's Post.

46
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,720
And now my conscience
is telling me

47
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,600
that I should politely refuse

48
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,720
to accept this post.

49
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,120
No-no-no-no...

50
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,040
- Calm down!
- No-no-no...

51
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,240
What is your opinion
on Sonia Gandhi's decision?

52
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,240
Look, Sonia ma'am is my mother.

53
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,496
And she's made this decision
after much reconsideration

54
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,280
and assessing her conscience.

55
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,040
And if her conscience is telling
her, then this decision is right.

56
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,760
Well, this is her decision,

57
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,560
a decision made from her heart.

58
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,880
There's nothing we can say.

59
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,920
It's not an easy decision to make.

60
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,120
Sonia is my mother.
And I am proud of her.

61
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
All I can say is that

62
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,760
there's no other person
in this country

63
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,120
who can make a similar decision.

64
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,480
I know I could've never taken such
a decision in the same situation.

65
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
Long Live Sonia Gandhi!

66
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,200
How should be our leader?
Soniaji and no other.

67
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,120
Soniaji and no other.

68
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,280
Sonia Gandhi's refusal to
the PM's post has created a stir.

69
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,360
Who is going to be the Prime Minister
of the world's largest democracy

70
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,280
is still a mystery.

71
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,640
Seniority is the
most important issue.

72
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,200
We need a leader
who is respected by all.

73
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Look...

74
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Seniority and respect are fine.

75
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
But, we'll have to think
about our alliance as well.

76
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,400
After all,
this is a Allied Government.

77
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,680
We need someone who
can appease all the groups.

78
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,720
This is a very big challenge for me.

79
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,520
I want all of you
to support my decision.

80
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,960
And this wasn't an easy
decision for me to make.

81
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,400
I thought about many people.

82
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,520
About the future of this party.

83
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,640
About the country.

84
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,560
And, after carefully
reviewing every aspect.

85
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,840
I believe that

86
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,560
only one man fits
the bill perfectly.

87
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,160
For the Prime Minister's post...

88
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,080
I've chosen Dr. Manmohan Singh.

89
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,080
No power in this world can stop the
deliberations,

90
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,280
the conception
for which the time has come.

91
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
India's time has arrived.

92
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,440
I would like to tell this assembly,
that our country shall emerge

93
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800
as an Economic super power

94
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,120
and no power in
the world can stop it.

95
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,160
I, Manmohan Singh, swear on God

96
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,560
that I shall discharge my duties

97
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
as the Prime Minister

98
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,520
with utmost dedication
and sincerity.

99
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
And never make public any knowledge

100
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,840
that I obtain as the Prime Minister
intentionally or unintentionally!

101
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,680
Master Stroke.

102
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,160
The tea served in the
Secretariat is pretty sweet.

103
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,200
It's how I've made
many bitter enemies.

104
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,040
These handful people run a country
with a population of 1 billion people.

105
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,960
They decide the fate of this
country, and I write their story.

106
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
That's my job.

107
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Hi. I am Sanjaya Baru.

108
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,440
Editor, Financial Express.

109
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
So, Mr Sanjaya,
are you looking for your headlines?

110
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,880
You're the headlines these days,
Mr Chauhan.

111
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,040
So, which Ministry
are they giving you?

112
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,880
Finance... Minister of State.
Congratulations.

113
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
That's a big post.

114
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,160
Who will be your Cabinet Minister?

115
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,160
The Prime Minister will
keep the Finance Ministry.

116
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is it true?

117
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,840
The Prime Minister
told me personally.

118
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,920
You don't need to think twice
before making this your headlines.

119
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Excuse me.

120
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,360
Welcome back in
the Government, Anna.

121
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,840
Thank you, Baru, thank you.

122
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,800
- What's new?
- You tell me.

123
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,400
Which Ministry are they giving you?
Finance. What else?

124
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,920
I see... But I heard that the
PM's keeping the Finance Ministry.

125
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,400
Baru, if the PM looks after
Finance, then what will I do?

126
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,200
Baru. Your editorial came true.

127
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,600
The party finally
called in the doctor.

128
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,120
Years later we have a PM who
has no connection to real estate.

129
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,120
But... Politics is not Economics.

130
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,480
Will he survive?

131
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,720
Narsimha Rao ran his government
for 5 years despite being in minority.

132
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,240
I am sure the Doctor has
learnt something from his mentor.

133
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,400
Chauhan.

134
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,960
Sir.

135
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,960
Mr Baru you will have
to change your headline.

136
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,320
Chidambaram will be
the new Finance Minister.

137
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,680
But the PM told you personally,
didn't he?

138
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,280
Maybe he did so in excitement
without asking the high command.

139
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,000
Is this even possible?

140
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,560
'Child's name.
Name's Manmohan Singh.'

141
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,600
'And his date of birth.
Who cares about the date of birth.'

142
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,696
'It's not like he's going
to be the Prime Minister.'

143
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
'I mean write whatever you like.'

144
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,520
Manmohan Singh didn't
win this election.

145
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,440
The people chose madam.

146
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,640
And madam chose Manmohan Singh.

147
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,800
And this fact should
reflect at every level.

148
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,200
Mr Patel,
it's easier said than done.

149
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,760
It has to be constitutionally
and legally fitted in.

150
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,960
He is right, Patel sir.

151
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,600
The PMO has unprecedented
control over the policies.

152
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,560
This won't be easy.

153
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,920
We'll decide the Polices.

154
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,200
A National Advisory
Committee shall be formed.

155
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,240
And madam shall be the chairperson.

156
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,000
And they will work towards the
development of the underprivileged.

157
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Yes...

158
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,920
And this will keep
the 'Left Front' happy.

159
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,320
We'll have to appoint a loyal bureaucrat
in the Prime Minister's office.

160
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,680
Do you have anyone in mind?

161
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Pulok Chatterjee.

162
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Who else?

163
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,560
That's good advice.

164
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,520
Sir, here's a list of your
people approved by 10 Janpath.

165
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,200
The list has become pretty small.

166
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,760
'Pulok Chatterjee.'

167
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
'Gandhi family's close...'

168
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:45,000
'He's getting the PM's list of
people approved by Sonia Gandhi.'

169
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,000
What will be your job, Pulok?

170
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,920
Sir my job will be to maintain
communiqué between the NAC and the PMO.

171
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,960
Sir, that will be unconstitutional.

172
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
What will be your brief?

173
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,400
Sir, my brief is to brief madam.

174
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,880
If she has knowledge of your decisions,
then it will only make her job easier.

175
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,720
So the Prime Minister's
job will be decided by the NAC.

176
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,560
No, no, no, sir.

177
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,800
That will be unconstitutional.

178
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,440
NAC will advise you about matters
that are in the interest of the nation.

179
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,920
So I can decide

180
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,360
whether I should work
for National Interest, or not?

181
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,600
Thank you.

182
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Thank you, sir.

183
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,880
'Finally, the PM thought about me.'

184
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,400
'And I received a call.'

185
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,160
Back in those days, he
was the Chairman of the UGC.

186
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,281
I did a detailed interview
about him in our first meeting.

187
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,600
I received a call from Dr Singh's office
once the interview was published.

188
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,000
People often called me
to praise me for my article.

189
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,680
'I am a perfectionist.'

190
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
Please sit.

191
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,200
Sir, that's a really
nice tie you're wearing.

192
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,240
Your tape recorder wasn't working.

193
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Yes, sir.

194
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Did you get it fixed?

195
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,360
No, sir. I bought a new one.

196
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
Please give it to Mr Kadhu.

197
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,240
Did you read the interview
that you did on me?

198
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,000
You are a journalist,

199
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
you should be aware of
the conditions prevalent in the country.

200
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,160
It is a big problem.

201
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,480
And that's why I intentionally
mentioned South Korea.

202
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,720
We need reforms like
them in our country.

203
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,160
Your job was to convey this to the people.
But you failed in doing so.

204
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,640
Sir, I published
your entire interview.

205
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,360
Maybe there was some
error at the News Desk.

206
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,400
I will get it checked.

207
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,680
What's the point now?

208
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,400
And blame someone else.

209
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Mr Baru, your subordinate's
mistake is your mistake.

210
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,160
Sanjaya, will you
be my Press Secretary?

211
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,120
Of course, sir.

212
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,760
But I have two conditions.

213
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,480
I want to be your media advisor.

214
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,920
In the age of the Internet,
Press Secretary sounds so outdated.

215
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,280
I am okay about that.

216
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,280
And your second condition.

217
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,320
I will report only to you.

218
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,736
Ma'am, you don't have
to take the trouble.

219
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,800
Spare me the lecture on protocol.

220
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,400
I've been making tea in my house
for the last 30 years.

221
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,040
There's no protocol amongst family.

222
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Thank you.

223
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,960
Other than managing the media
what else do you expect of me.

224
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,480
As the PM it often gets difficult
to stay connected to the ground.

225
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,280
All you can see are files,
Ministers, and Bureaucrats around you.

226
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,920
I want every piece of news.

227
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,760
I want to hear the truth from you,

228
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,440
without any fear, or expectation.

229
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,000
Politics is just like Mahabharata.

230
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,680
Sanjaya, you have
to be my eyes and ears.

231
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,000
You can be his eyes and ears,
but what about his voice?

232
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,200
Ma'am, this is not my turf.

233
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,880
You may not understand this turf,
but bureaucracy is a turf war.

234
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,680
Everyone has their
eyes on everyone.

235
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,760
If you give them some space

236
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,320
then the third person
will seize the opportunity.

237
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,120
And you must keep reminding him
that over and over again.

238
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,320
'Sir's prediction
came true pretty soon.'

239
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,040
'And it started with Mani.'

240
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,680
Mani sir has sent this.

241
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,600
Just a second, baby.

242
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,640
In any PMO,
connections are very important.

243
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,720
My connection with Doctor did
not go down well with three people.

244
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Mani.

245
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,360
Original name; JN Dixit.

246
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
National Security Advisor.
An expert in foreign Policies.

247
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,360
And my good friend.

248
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
Since he was an expert,

249
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,600
He knew everyone's job
better than them.

250
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,320
And that's why defeating
me in a turf war is difficult.

251
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,880
Mike, Original name M K Narayanan.

252
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,320
By profession a spy,
former Intelligence Bureau Chief.

253
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,880
Madam's close confidante.

254
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,720
He knew which Minister
has invested his money where.

255
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,520
Whether he was angry or in a jolly mood,
he always said one thing to everyone.

256
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,840
Listen.

257
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,440
I have a file on you.

258
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,520
Compared to Mike and Mani,

259
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,960
Dr. Singh's Principal Secretary
TKA Nair

260
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
didn't have much say.

261
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,080
But I will get the corner office.

262
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,000
And finally, Subu.

263
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,400
The PM's Personal Secretary.

264
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,680
Subu had only one passion.

265
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,600
Astrology.

266
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,440
But the PM has no interest
in astrology.

267
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,880
Sir.

268
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
You must look at this.

269
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,880
For some of the briefings, we shall need
NAC's approval so what is wrong with it.

270
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,800
Sir, just like Mani
is your advisor. So am I.

271
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,240
And sir, I requested you
that I will report only to you.

272
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,640
Calm down. Sit.

273
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
I am the only person on your entire team
who is not a bureaucrat.

274
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,360
The 24-hour media doesn't wait
for notes, files, or approvals.

275
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,760
If we don't reply against
a lie within 24 hours,

276
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,720
then it's accepted as the truth, sir.

277
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,360
Fine, I will talk to Mani.

278
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,480
Baru.

279
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,400
Such temper over
a routine circular.

280
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,320
That too with friends.

281
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,520
Come on. Let's have some nice coffee.

282
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,880
Guess who spoke to me this morning?
Who?

283
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,920
Natwar Singh.

284
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Ohh... what was he saying?

285
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,720
He sounded concerned.

286
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,720
Was saying that you're
still clearing his files.

287
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,640
You know what, Baru,

288
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
even the Foreign Secretary of America

289
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,400
is scared of its
National Security Advisor.

290
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,160
Let him tell the PM.
I will handle it.

291
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
Anyway, stop worrying. Have...

292
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,320
a cigar.

293
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
Smoking in the PMO.
Isn't it restricted?

294
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,960
There are no rules for us.

295
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,920
We're the PMO.

296
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,920
We're the PMO.

297
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,680
Even on the 10th day, the Prime
Minister wasn't allowed to speak.

298
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,280
I will give you
a chance after this.

299
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,200
Sources have confirmed
that the Prime Minister speech

300
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,840
will be tabled without reading.

301
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,200
Maybe this will be
the first time in history.

302
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,080
Even the 'Left Party' are pretty
angry with the Prime Minister.

303
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,560
The Government

304
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,200
is appointing people from private
companies in the Planning Commission.

305
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,680
People from
Multinational Companies.

306
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,120
Lending our support doesn't
mean we turn a blind eye.

307
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,840
Tomorrow if you appoint Coca Cola
on the Planning Commission,

308
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,880
do you think we'll take it lying down?

309
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,440
'Everyone was taking advantage
of the Prime Minister's weakness.'

310
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,360
'I had a bad habit.'

311
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,400
'Which minister leaks news against the
Prime Minister and on whose beckon'

312
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,440
'I would find that out
in under an hour.'

313
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,280
How did the media learn about the
letter that Sonia ma'am wrote to me?

314
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,640
Does this suit an intelligent
minister like you?

315
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,320
Somebody is misleading you, sir.

316
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,280
I haven't done anything wrong.

317
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,120
Don't insult my intelligence.

318
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,480
This should not be repeated again.

319
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,360
Am I clear?

320
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,960
Am I clear?

321
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
Yes, PM sir.

322
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,880
Sir, Jairam looked pretty upset.

323
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,600
After a certain age, one's capacity
to face the music keeps decreasing.

324
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
He will behave in the future.

325
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,960
No, sir. Frankly, this will never stop.

326
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,400
Something else
will leak out tomorrow.

327
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,440
They have unwavering loyalty.

328
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,640
Don't pass judgment.

329
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,320
So... what should we do now?

330
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,200
They leaked Sonia madam's letter.

331
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,520
Now I will leak
your reply to Sonia ma'am.

332
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,520
That will be a very bold step.

333
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,760
I'm taking it, sir.

334
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,840
Everyone will get the message.

335
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,280
PMO means business.

336
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,960
No-no-no, sir.

337
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,280
That Dr. Singh means business.

338
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,240
My fellow countrymen.

339
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,080
While h... hu... humbly
addressing you...

340
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,920
In accordance with the
duties conferred on me by you.

341
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:04,040
This addressal reminds me
of a quote by Gandhiji.

342
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,920
He used to say that he wants
to wipe tears from every eye.

343
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:19,440
He used to say that before
performing any task, you must know

344
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:28,720
what is your contribution to the lives
of those who are poorer than the poor?

345
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Was that okay?

346
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,480
Now how do I answer that?

347
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,800
Okay, let me try.

348
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,120
No-no-no-no-no, sir.

349
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,600
If you speak like this,
I will definitely lose my job.

350
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,160
The Prime Minister's addressal
should reflect faith.

351
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,000
Speak as I showed you.

352
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,520
Take a pause at the commas.

353
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,680
Stress more on the words
that are marked in bold.

354
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,080
- Shall we try again, sir?
- Okay.

355
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,320
Sanjaya, how much
work does it still need?

356
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,080
About 99%, sir.

357
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh no...

358
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,880
My fellow countrymen.

359
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,920
I am... I am humbly
addressing you...

360
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,960
Hello.
Sir, things went terribly wrong today.

361
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,760
You must manage the media, sir.

362
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
Will you tell me what happened?

363
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,680
Sir, a delegation came to suggest
changes in the finance bill.

364
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,920
Manmohan, we want some
changes in the finance bill.

365
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,000
The PM wasn't on his seat.
He was standing.

366
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,560
So even the delegation
had to stand.

367
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,200
They handed over the
file to the PM while standing.

368
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,240
And since the table wasn't high enough,
he dropped the file in a hurry.

369
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,840
Maybe there was no time for tea.

370
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Everyone was standing.

371
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,000
And now media is putting allegations
against him that he threw the file.

372
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,400
Did he keep the file
down or did he throw it down?

373
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,520
He kept it down, sir.

374
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,520
And, what if he threw it?

375
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,800
This is no time
to take a step back, Subu.

376
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,800
Tell me exactly how it happened.

377
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,000
The PM is not some rubber stamp
or a paper tiger.

378
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,160
I am on my way.

379
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,320
Look,

380
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,000
the Opposition plays an important
role in Parliamentary Democracy.

381
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,320
And if this is how you will
treat the Opposition leaders

382
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,800
then it will be held
in contempt of the Parliament.

383
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,440
Everyone was noticing the
change in Dr Singh's attitude.

384
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,120
The Opposition, Congress.

385
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,280
Everyone was surprised.

386
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,080
Come, Mr. Navin. Sit.

387
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Sir.

388
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,280
Yes.

389
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,280
Even Orrisa deserves
a special package like Bihar.

390
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,360
Money doesn't grow on trees, Navin.

391
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,520
But sir...

392
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,240
Social Economic.

393
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,840
Come in, Mr. Nair.

394
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,320
Tea/coffee for you, Mr. Navin?

395
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Sir.

396
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,800
Thank you.

397
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,480
Sir.

398
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,120
This addressal reminds
me of a quote by Gandhiji.

399
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,920
He used to say that he wants
to wipe tears from every eye.

400
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,520
The TV speech was a fantastic idea.

401
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,800
It had a commendable impact.
Amazing.

402
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,960
You very well know
who wrote the speech.

403
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,800
Right, Baru.

404
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,600
Well done.

405
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,160
Thank you.

406
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,880
He's been getting applauses.

407
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,480
What else are you
scouring the magazine for?

408
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,200
According to Sonia,
Dr Singh should be a political PM.

409
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,760
Can you believe it?

410
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,120
Well, he's getting the branding.

411
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,520
No, Mike.

412
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,800
For this to come true,

413
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,560
the country should hear it
from Dr. Singh and not Sonia ma'am.

414
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,600
The government will complete
100 days in power, right?

415
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,160
We should call
for a press conference.

416
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,560
But, even a single mistake
won't go down well with the media.

417
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,200
I know.

418
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,040
PM sir is so soft-spoken.

419
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,440
And very shy.

420
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,880
He won't be able to handle it.

421
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
All your efforts will be in vain.

422
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,960
Nothing will be in vain.

423
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,240
This is our opportunity, boys.

424
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Anyone can ask anything
they want to the PM.

425
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,040
He's not afraid to
answer any question.

426
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,520
Sir, if there's a question on Pakistan,
please speak limited about Musharraf.

427
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,800
Mani, I am not some
kindergarten child.

428
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,160
Just tell me the facts.

429
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,160
And let me decide
what I want to say.

430
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,440
PM sir, I'll take your leave.

431
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,160
Sir, I'm leaving for
the press conference

432
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,880
and, I think you
should freshen up too.

433
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Sanjaya, do tigers
ever brush their teeth?

434
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,440
Please welcome our honourable
Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh.

435
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,360
Let's start with the questions.

436
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,320
- Sir!
- Sir!

437
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,920
It's believed that Sonia Gandhi
is the super Prime Minister.

438
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,520
What is your opinion?

439
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,960
Sonia is the Congress Party President

440
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,560
and the Chairperson of UPA.

441
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,120
But that doesn't mean
there are two power centres.

442
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,400
Mr Prime Minister,
it's believed that

443
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,200
if you're ever asked to do
something that you feel isn't right

444
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,840
then you will resign.

445
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,240
Well, madam,
your information is wrong.

446
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,440
No one can coerce me
to tender my resignation.

447
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,200
The Government
will fulfil its term.

448
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,600
Sir US is opposing
our Nuclear Programme.

449
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,400
You are scheduled
to meet President Bush.

450
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,720
What will you say to him?

451
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I will say, Mr Bush,
Nuclear Power can be

452
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,040
used to manufacture bombs
as well as electricity.

453
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,920
It's just cosmetics.

454
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,696
If public relations could get you power,
then even you could've become a minister.

455
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,800
Don't underestimate Dr. Singh,
Mr. Patel.

456
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,120
Underestimate.

457
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,800
The Doctor has only one legacy,
economic reform.

458
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,080
He shouldn't expect anything more,
nor will anything else happen.

459
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,160
Do you think the 'Left Front'
will agree with the Doctor?

460
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,600
It's the 21st century,
anything is possible.

461
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Mr Thakur,

462
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,080
Politics is the game for
those who win the elections.

463
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,840
Those who don't fight
elections never win.

464
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,480
Why so serious, Mani?

465
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,400
Why does Natwar Singh
want to go inside with the PM?

466
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,160
PM sir should meet
with Bush all alone.

467
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,640
So that they can set
in the new agenda properly.

468
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,680
I have an idea.

469
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,720
- Now...
- Mr Natwar Singh.

470
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,400
Sir, we won't get
this opportunity again.

471
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,320
If America declares us
a nuclear state

472
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,480
then it will clear our path for
the United Nations Security Council.

473
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,680
It's important to end
nuclear isolation, Mani.

474
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,880
May I come in, sir?

475
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,360
Yes, Sanjaya, come in.

476
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Mani, can I speak with
the PM alone for a minute?

477
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,960
I'll be outside, sir, if you need me.

478
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,360
Pardon me, sir,
but I am afraid I've some bad news.

479
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,640
Ex-Prime Minister Rao
passed away a while ago.

480
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,800
He was a great personality.

481
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,320
Indeed he was, sir.

482
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,840
I have an important job for you.

483
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,440
It's a sensitive issue.

484
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Tell me.

485
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,080
Your father used to write
Mr Rao's speeches.

486
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,080
You're close to their family.

487
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,560
Please request them to perform
the final rites at Hyderabad.

488
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,960
Is there an issue with Delhi?

489
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,400
Hyderabad is his birthplace.

490
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,640
Isn't Delhi his place of action?

491
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,880
Don't get into all this.

492
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,400
Just talk to his family.

493
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,160
That's not my job.

494
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Such a treatment
with the former PM.

495
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,400
A man who dedicated his life
to the service of the country.

496
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,720
And as per my knowledge,
he has no family in Hyderabad.

497
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
I will talk to Sonia ma'am.

498
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,320
Sir, Ahmed Patel
is Sonia madam's voice.

499
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,640
I guess there's not enough space
left on Raj Ghat for his tomb.

500
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,560
Will the party decide the legacy
of a great leader like Rao sir?

501
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,840
Not the party, sir.

502
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,040
'Raj Ghat'

503
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,240
I've often seen Politics
stoop pretty low.

504
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,560
But

505
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
never this much.

506
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,840
It was another blow for Doctor Sir.

507
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,760
When Mani died due to a cardiac arrest.

508
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,720
Mike was now the
National Security Advisor.

509
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,800
'Even after two severe blows, '

510
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,040
'Dr. Singh kept moving
towards his target.'

511
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,520
'Nuclear Deal.'

512
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,040
'No one ever imagined that
President Bush and Dr Singh would'

513
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,880
'become such thick friends.'

514
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,680
'After Dr Singh's return, there was
a huge stir over the Nuclear dear.'

515
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,760
With America.
We're not making any secret deals.

516
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,440
This is affecting our nation's...

517
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,440
'The Doctor was being
attacked on three fronts.'

518
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,120
'Opposition,
Left, and his own party.'

519
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,440
The deal you're stressing on
is beyond anyone's comprehension.

520
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,120
But it will definitely
cripple our government.

521
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,056
The underprivileged people
of our country

522
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,640
have nothing to do with Nuclear energy.

523
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,440
This is the right moment.

524
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,640
We need nuclear energy for
the development of our country.

525
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,800
Think of the future.

526
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,280
We can think of the future if our
government still stays in power.

527
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,120
Once you sign the deal,
the Left Party will stop supporting us.

528
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,760
Our time will be over.

529
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,560
That won't happen.

530
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,280
President Bush has assured
to help me in every way.

531
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,120
Oh, Doctor.

532
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,960
And you believed a Politician.

533
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,720
We'll talk another time. Goodbye.

534
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,760
Bush arrived in Delhi.

535
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,600
Both the Ministers

536
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,560
shook hands announcing
their nuclear deal to the world.

537
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,720
And that I included my remarks,
thank you.

538
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,840
I have a pretty simple question.

539
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,200
How will this deal
affect our nuclear weapons?

540
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,360
Sir, this will not
affect our nuclear weapons.

541
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,840
And we made that pretty
clear in the beginning.

542
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,080
We can make anything we want.

543
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,240
Can this deal guarantee that

544
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,760
the price of Uranium will
decrease, and supply will increase?

545
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,240
These debates will never end.

546
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,040
But gentlemen,
the entire country is proud of you.

547
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,160
You're taking an important
and crucial step.

548
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,480
Sir...

549
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,760
Mr Vajpayee,
would you like to add something?

550
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,840
Vajpayee sir was an expert in
speaking volumes with his silence.

551
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Expert!

552
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,120
He spoke volumes with just a smile.

553
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,840
The BJP was now on our side.

554
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,040
Indian Politics
is a strange battle.

555
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,640
The opposition became our allies.
Our allies turned into Opposition.

556
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,360
PM belonged to the party, but the
party didn't seem to support the PM.

557
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,680
Do you understand?

558
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Because, even after 20 years,
I still didn't.

559
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,320
Ram.

560
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,520
Fantastic headlines,
man, fantastic headlines.

561
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,200
Baru, there is a problem.

562
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,160
N. Ram.

563
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,720
The Hindu Newspaper's
Leftist Publisher and Editor.

564
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,840
And a close friend
of the Left leaders.

565
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,800
N. Ram's green light meant
Left leaders green light.

566
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,040
Left won't support this deal.

567
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,440
This... is a political decision.

568
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,760
What will I tell the PM?
To put the deal on hold.

569
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,160
Otherwise, the Left
will withdraw their support.

570
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,920
If they want to withdraw
their support, then they can do so.

571
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,960
Sir, is this
your official statement?

572
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,320
Yes.

573
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,160
These are the same people

574
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,240
who opposed Mr Nehru and
Indira Ma'am independent policy.

575
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,440
They even opposed
Mr Narsimha Rao and me.

576
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,400
Whereas we were improving
the country's economy.

577
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,720
Prakash Karat states
that the government is

578
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,040
compromising the nuclear
sovereignty of the country.

579
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,040
I will sell out my country?

580
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,160
How can they even
say such a thing for me?

581
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,400
Sir, what will be your next step,
if they withdraw?

582
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,120
We will put up a fight

583
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,640
because the country comes first for me.

584
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:44,760
'Anguished PM To Left: If You Want
To Withdraw, So Be It.'

585
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,600
'Dr. Singh didn't give up.'

586
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,200
'But, even the Left wasn't
ready to give up easily.'

587
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,880
'People came out on the streets'

588
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,280
'and the Left walked
out of the Parliament.'

589
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,720
Madam, the Prime Minister made a
strong statement against the Left party.

590
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,160
Do you want an election before time?

591
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,440
We don't want personal conflicts.

592
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,560
These are not the
morals of an Alliance.

593
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,840
But madam, do you think that
the Left is being unreasonable.

594
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,440
I don't think so.

595
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,240
The Left Party has certain
ideologies and issues.

596
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,720
They are simply putting
forward their opinion.

597
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,920
And you're happy with this?
Of course.

598
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,240
Yes, I'll escort you down.

599
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,440
Welcome, Doctor.

600
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,960
Your statement was
a little out of character.

601
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,960
Do you feel you've
crossed the line?

602
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,920
Is it working?
Absolutely, loud and clear.

603
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,960
Well,

604
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,560
I was giving a reply to the Left.

605
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,880
And, I don't think
I crossed any line.

606
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
Yes.

607
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,720
I know

608
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,840
what I should say or shouldn't.

609
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,920
Sir, is the nuclear deal off?

610
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,960
And if that's true,
then what about your government.

611
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,800
Well,

612
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,320
we're not a one-issue government.

613
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,080
One has to live with
their disappoints.

614
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,640
If this deal does not go through,

615
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,360
then life won't come to an end.

616
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,640
After this Doctor Sir observed silence.

617
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,160
The entire country had
only one question on their mind.

618
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,480
Deal or no deal?

619
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
Hello.

620
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,280
Yes, sir. Right away.

621
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,600
Yes, sir.

622
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,440
Sorry.

623
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,720
I didn't expect this from you,
Sanjaya.

624
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,360
What did I do?

625
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,880
What did you tell
the US Ambassador?

626
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,600
About what, sir?

627
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,200
About the Nuclear deal.
What did you tell him?

628
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,160
Ted, how are things at the Embassy?

629
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,280
The Ambassador wants
to know what the PM meant.

630
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,600
What's there to add?
Whatever he said is out there.

631
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,960
What do I think the PM meant?

632
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,480
Probably this, Ted.

633
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,240
Que Sera Sera.

634
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,800
What is the meaning
of Que Sera Sera?

635
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,200
Sir, I was not talking
in code language.

636
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,160
Your spies gave
you wrong information.

637
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,760
It's a song from one
of Hitchcock's films.

638
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,400
Man Who Knew Too Much.

639
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,920
Sung by Doris Day.

640
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,040
But what does it mean?

641
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,960
Que Sera Sera means
what will be will be.

642
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,160
This is my standard answer to any
question about the nuclear deal.

643
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,600
I want to resign.

644
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,800
Madam, my position
has become pretty awkward.

645
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,400
But must you give me this?

646
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,760
Must you resign?

647
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,320
Madam, the Left wants to see
our government's secret documents.

648
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,240
They want to embarrass
us in the IAEA.

649
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,880
If we compromise with the Left,

650
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,040
then I'll no other
option but to resign.

651
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,120
But you do know that your
resignation will create a stir.

652
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,200
Madam, either we can ignore the
Left and go ahead with the deal

653
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,920
or compromise with the Left
and stop the deal right here.

654
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,120
If UPA chooses the second option,

655
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,920
then you'll have to find
yourself a new Prime Minister.

656
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,160
Mr. Prime Minister,

657
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,920
such decisions are not made in haste.

658
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,760
Think about it.

659
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,160
There was nothing
to think actually.

660
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,920
This Nuclear deal was bigger
than the battle of Panipat for us.

661
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,760
And the biggest
blow came last night.

662
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,640
At 10 Janpath.

663
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,880
By the way, I should finish
my coffee before Pulock arrives.

664
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,640
Could be my last one at the PMO.

665
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,560
May I come in, sir?
Please come in.

666
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,880
How are you, sir?

667
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,760
Did Sonia ma'am send you here?

668
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,080
Yes, sir.

669
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,600
Sir, please take your
resignation back. Sir, please.

670
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,160
I've put my view
in front of Sonia ma'am.

671
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,280
There's no scope for reconsideration.
Thank you.

672
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,040
Sir, Sonia ma'am
won't let you resign.

673
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,960
You must stick to your statement.

674
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,280
We'll see whatever
happens to the Left.

675
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,880
We'll see.

676
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,680
Que Sera Sera.

677
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,640
We sent a letter to the
President today and withdrew

678
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,400
our support from
the UPA government.

679
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,880
We've sent another letter

680
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:27,040
where we've requested the President
to direct the Prime Minister

681
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,960
to bring the Confidence
Motion in the Parliament

682
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,680
and prove his
government's majority.

683
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,720
Sir, can I talk to you alone.

684
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,840
Sir, Mr Amar Singh wants
to talk to you.

685
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,840
He's in the US.

686
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,000
I think the deal
will now go through, sir.

687
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,640
No one knows about Science
and Technology more than you.

688
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,200
I want you to guide us.

689
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,400
We want to take the right
decision for the country.

690
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,280
Is this deal right?

691
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,160
Of course, it is.

692
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,120
Your duty is to support the deal.

693
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,680
It's in the interest
of the country.

694
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,080
That's all I wanted
to hear from you.

695
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,680
Now I can explain to my people.

696
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,400
This is Politics.

697
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,360
The entire country is praying for.

698
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,960
Dr. Singh's good health
and quick recovery.

699
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,840
Will Dr Singh contest the elections
from the Lok Sabha in such conditions?

700
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,760
That's the question
on everyone's mind.

701
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,480
'Dr. Singh had become
a hero for the entire country.'

702
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,560
'But like every hero,
even he had a weakness.'

703
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,200
'His own party.'

704
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,680
'And the party's biggest
obstacle was me.'

705
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,920
'This happened
in the earlier days.'

706
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,720
How does it feel at the PMO?

707
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,440
It's a challenging job,
but I am enjoying it.

708
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,720
But what went down with
Mr Chandrashekhar?

709
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,920
He seemed upset with you.

710
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,200
After his meeting with the PM,
he announced to Telugu media

711
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,600
that they discussed over Telangana.

712
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,480
Whereas no such
thing ever happened.

713
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,920
He never said a word
to the PM about Telangana.

714
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,320
Things are often misheard
or said which leads to confusion.

715
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,656
And, when you keep giving
clarification for every trivial issue,

716
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,320
it just adds to the confusion.

717
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,360
There is no confusion.

718
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,040
I know my job, and
that's what I'm doing.

719
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,960
Yes... some people will get angry.

720
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,720
But what to do, Mr Patel.

721
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,960
That's my job.

722
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,160
But, we can't upset
the party allies.

723
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,280
Will you take my advice?

724
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,760
Apologies to him.

725
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,960
Or you might have
to resign from your job.

726
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,600
You don't have to worry
about my job, Mr Patel.

727
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,720
I work for the PM,
and not the party.

728
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,680
But the PM works
for the party, Baru.

729
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,040
I'll resign the day he tells me to.

730
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,880
Right!

731
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,320
Dr. Singh hardly says anything.

732
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,960
During the Nuclear deal,

733
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,600
a new PM candidate was
being announced every day.

734
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,320
This battle was now PM vs. Party.

735
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,000
We were prepared.

736
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,960
It is when I make
sparrows fight hawks

737
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,760
that I am called Gobind Singh.

738
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,320
Sanjaya, I cannot work like this.

739
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,960
The media announces
a new PM every day.

740
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:26,600
This news is very depressing, and
the party doesn't deny them either.

741
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,240
I was going to bring this
up first thing tomorrow morning.

742
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,800
Because I have a strategy.

743
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,280
You cannot stop this news.

744
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,720
But you can.

745
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,760
Press Conference
sounds very defensive.

746
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,440
I was thinking of
a political solution,

747
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,280
These stories are being planted.

748
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,600
There's nothing we can do about it.

749
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,960
But maybe they've forgotten
that you're not the PM of Congress.

750
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,760
You're the PM of the entire
UPA and their 11 Allies.

751
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,760
And those Allies
firmly believe in you.

752
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,160
Neither you nor I am
required to do or say anything.

753
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,800
Sir, sir, sir...

754
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,160
Sir, is the PM resigning.

755
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,896
Is Rahul Gandhi the
next PM of our country.

756
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,216
What is Sonia Gandhi's next step?

757
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,360
Tell us about your opinion.
Please tell us, sir.

758
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,240
It's all rumors.

759
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,920
Manmohan Singh is the PM of UPA.

760
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,920
And he enjoys
the confidence of every party.

761
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,560
Replacing him is
out of the question.

762
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,320
All the Allies are
very happy with his work.

763
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,560
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

764
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,680
Congratulations, sir. Thank you.

765
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,480
Sir, Rahul Gandhi is coming to meet you
with the Youth Delegation.

766
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,360
Did he take an appointment? No.

767
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,520
Doesn't matter.

768
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,960
Happy birthday, sir.

769
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,760
Many many happy returns of the day.

770
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,080
Happy birthday, sir.

771
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,840
Baru.

772
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Baru.

773
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,840
Please release this to the media.

774
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,880
Rahul has requested the PM
to increase the rates of 'MNREGA'.

775
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,880
And the PM is pretty happy with it.

776
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,120
What do you mean by 'PM is happy'?

777
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,040
The PM supports
the party's suggestion.

778
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,280
Do you have a problem with it?

779
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,960
The problem is...

780
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:58,560
That sir has already made a public
announcement about this on 15th August.

781
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:05,400
And reporters hear all, write all,

782
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,080
and they bloody well remember too.

783
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,400
You're a wise man.
I am sure you know that.

784
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,400
So...

785
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,960
Let me know if you
need me for anything else.

786
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,280
But...

787
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,240
please keep this.

788
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,360
Morning, Sir.

789
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,160
Sanjaya, how can you
do such a thing to me?

790
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,280
MNREGA is my birthday
present to the Country.

791
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,960
You sent such a text,
to the reporters.

792
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,120
And to the Express.

793
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,040
Was I wrong, Sir?

794
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,120
Sir, how can they take credit?

795
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,920
You're the PM of this country.

796
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,360
What about the work done by
ministers like Raghuvansh Prasad?

797
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,760
I don't want any credit.

798
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,080
I'm only concerned about my job.

799
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,680
And your image.

800
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,560
There's no need to
keep my image straight.

801
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,040
It is, sir.

802
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,440
The world is watching you.

803
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,120
If people can take credit for your work,
then what else is safe in this country?

804
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,320
Sanjaya, please don't
be overly dramatic.

805
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,960
Let them take all the credit.

806
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,120
I am doing my job. You do yours.

807
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,200
Write my speeches.

808
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:59,360
Don't waste time over public
positioning and public image.

809
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,520
Thank you.

810
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,160
Sorry, Sir.

811
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,560
One more thing.

812
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,360
Please come.

813
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,720
Do you read the newspaper?

814
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,840
Sorry, Sir.

815
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,920
Stop worrying about the PMO's post,
and worry about yours.

816
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,480
It's in the newspaper again.

817
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,240
Punjab Kesari.

818
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,600
You're being fired from the PMO.

819
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,200
That's 3-month-old news, sir.

820
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,760
I think you should meet Madam once.

821
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,280
Why Madam?

822
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,320
You must tell her that

823
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,440
wrong articles are being planted
against you in the newspaper.

824
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,240
And I will personally
fix your appointment.

825
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,560
I will think about it, Sir.

826
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,200
Okay.

827
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,880
Baru. Not now, Nair. I am busy.

828
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,240
Just a minute.

829
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,960
The MPs called,
they were complaining about you.

830
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,520
Did you give a quote
to the newspaper?

831
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,120
Do MPs call you as well?

832
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,520
Yes, this is the PMO.
Anyone can call here.

833
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,600
You should meet Madam once.

834
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,160
I'll fix an appointment.
Sort out everything.

835
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,400
You got to be a little
flexible in politics.

836
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,160
Blessings are important.

837
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,480
Unfortunately,

838
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,520
I am not a politician,

839
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,600
but a bloody journalist.

840
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,360
And they rate you for your
stubbornness, not sycophancy.

841
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,600
By the way, Nair,
you were going down.

842
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,480
I was going up.

843
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,520
You should reconsider
this once, Sanjaya.

844
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,040
I can no longer play
these political games.

845
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,560
I want to resign.

846
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,320
- Are you sure?
- I am.

847
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,840
Sir, the party won't let me do the job

848
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,760
for which you have appointed me.

849
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,080
And pardon me, but,

850
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,360
you're least interested
in your image as well.

851
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,200
I will be known for my work,
Sanjaya.

852
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,920
What is the official reason you
have mentioned in your resignation?

853
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,920
Sir, Tanvi has been granted admission
to the University of Singapore.

854
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,400
And, I was thinking

855
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,640
- I will take a job at the...
- Don't go, Sanjaya.

856
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,080
According to me,
it is a foolish decision.

857
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,560
I learnt it from you, Sir.

858
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,880
Sometimes it is wise to be foolish.

859
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,800
Will you write my speeches
from Singapore?

860
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,080
I'll do anything for you.

861
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,960
One more thing...

862
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,280
Give me a hug before
you leave, boy.

863
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,400
Take care.

864
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,480
You're awake. How about some water?

865
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,240
Can you pass my glasses?

866
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,120
How are you, Sanjaya? How is Rama?

867
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,640
They are all fine.
What about your health?

868
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,600
I didn't suffer a heart attack.

869
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,520
It was just a preventive surgery.

870
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,920
All my three arteries are fine.

871
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,480
I am fighting fit.

872
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,040
Sir, the elections
are in three months.

873
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,720
Your victory is guaranteed.

874
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,840
And this time you'll contest
the elections from the Lok Sabha.

875
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,520
What is the party's opinion?

876
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,280
Everyone knows the truth, Sir.

877
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,520
This election is way
out of Rahul Gandhi's league.

878
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,360
The party is playing very safe.

879
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,520
If you lose,
it'll be your loss alone.

880
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,240
But if you win, they all win.

881
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,520
How is Singapore?

882
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,640
Don't avoid the conversation.

883
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,760
The entire country is a fan of you.

884
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,360
If you contest from
the Rajya Sabha again

885
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,360
then your authority
will be undermined.

886
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,400
We'll do as the party says.

887
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,240
You should focus on your health.

888
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,240
Rahul will lead
the election campaign.

889
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:03,800
I cannot be just a spectator
in this election.

890
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,800
Sir, the party thinks that it could be
risky if you lead the election campaign.

891
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,880
We don't want to see you disappointed
like Atalji after the elections.

892
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:27,720
The party thinks
I am going to lose this election.

893
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,520
They don't have faith in me.

894
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,560
Let's not worry about that now.
Get some sleep.

895
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,560
But...

896
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,040
I won't give up.

897
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,520
Wait and watch.

898
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:55,960
The country has seen
considerable development

899
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,080
and surges in employment
in the last five years

900
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,720
and now we must take
that program further.

901
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,960
All we want is an opportunity in the
Central government or the State government

902
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:24,080
so that our party can set examples before
the country about good governance.

903
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,400
The effects of MNREGA can be
clearly seen throughout the country.

904
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,280
Due to our Economic planning,

905
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:39,160
we were not affected
by the Global Economic crisis.

906
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:45,640
Thanks to Nuclear Deal
India is now future ready.

907
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:51,760
Our dreams of progress
and change have come true.

908
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,920
"Singh is King! Singh is King!
Singh is King!"

909
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,320
"The world knows about it.
Singh is King! Singh is King!"

910
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,920
"We are the king of the world!
Singh is King Singh is King."

911
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,560
This is Mr Manmohan Singh's victory.

912
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,640
The slogan of Singh is King is
resonating throughout the country.

913
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,240
Congress party had
no hopes of winning.

914
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,560
Let alone winning by a landslide of 206
votes is on a completely different level.

915
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,456
This is a huge opportunity for you.

916
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,016
What is your opinion
about the party's victory?

917
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,080
Look...

918
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,280
Listen here.

919
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:33,080
Rahul Gandhi won 22 seats in UP
and revived the Congress Party.

920
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,520
This is a win for Rahul Gandhi.

921
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,360
Get me Baru on the line, please.

922
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,360
It's time for him to return.

923
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,240
Welcome back.

924
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,920
Nice to see you.

925
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,920
I would like to promote you,
Sanjaya.

926
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,680
Would you like to be
a Secretary in the PMO?

927
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,640
Sir, it's an important
position, but

928
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,920
then I'll have to report
to the Principal Secretary...

929
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,680
And you want to
report directly to me.

930
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,880
I am meeting the
Prime Minister of Pakistan in Egypt.

931
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,920
I will clear your file
when I come back.

932
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,640
Do you have any idea about Pakistan?

933
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,760
Sir, my advice is you shouldn't
start your second term with Pakistan.

934
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,320
The party will interfere.

935
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,640
It's what happened
during Musharraf's term?

936
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,960
I think you should concentrate
on the Global Economic crisis.

937
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,040
India is not deeply affected
by the Economic crisis, Sanjaya.

938
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:17,280
I want to find a solution
for Kashmir.

939
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,440
And, maybe I don't have much time.

940
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,960
What do you mean by

941
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,120
you don't have much time?

942
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,480
What could poor Dr Singh say?

943
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,320
There was only one news doing
rounds in the corridors of Delhi

944
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,600
when will Dr. Singh step down

945
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,240
and when will Rahul be coronated
as the new PM.

946
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,160
- Mr. Gilani.
- Yes.

947
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:00,080
Moments erred and
years got punished.

948
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,400
The people of India can
never forget the 26/11 incident.

949
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,200
President Zardari
clearly said that

950
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,120
the ISI chief will cooperate
with us in the investigation.

951
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,080
But he never came.

952
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:22,160
Dr Singh, let's give a statement on
terrorism and joint investigation.

953
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,160
But...

954
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,800
we have a small request just
to make our army happy as well.

955
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,000
Please go ahead.

956
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,240
Baluchistan.

957
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,840
But there's nothing in Baluchistan.

958
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,840
We'll do it if you say so?

959
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,840
The Opposition will
raise a commotion.

960
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,400
But it will be
acceptable to the party.

961
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,680
This is not acceptable
to the party.

962
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,640
Madam Chairperson,
Baluchistan is not an issue at all.

963
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,280
But you just made it an issue.

964
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,760
And an international one at that.

965
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:08,120
All the senior ministers are of the
opinion that it was a big mistake.

966
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,840
But we can still change the
wordings of the agreement, madam.

967
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:17,360
Maybe you didn't understand
my words properly.

968
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,320
If you...

969
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,720
Yeah... how are things?

970
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,600
Yes, the PM did call me,
and we even talked.

971
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:07,120
But who told you that I would look
after the UPA programs in the PMO?

972
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,201
If Chauhan said this, then he must
have done so with the PM's consent.

973
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,440
But I cannot confirm or deny this.

974
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,160
Your decision.

975
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,040
Wars are never won
with wooden swords, Baru.

976
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,040
You are unable to tackle the handle of
a cycle, how will you manage the media?

977
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,240
Did you see today's
Business Standard?

978
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,720
Stop lecturing me.

979
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,960
You've been appointed
to do your job, and not talk.

980
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,760
Don't repeat this mistake.
Now hang up.

981
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,880
Sir, it was you who called me back.

982
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,040
Things have gone awfully wrong after
this news was leaked in the media.

983
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,736
But the news was
leaked from this office.

984
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,920
There's no point
arguing over it now.

985
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,640
Sir, this is your opportunity
to show your authority.

986
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,080
This is your victory.
The PMO is your turf!

987
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,840
- How can you...
- Sanjaya!

988
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:26,360
Politics has taught me one thing,
and you should know too.

989
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,800
There's only one power centre.

990
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:35,120
And that centre is
the Party President.

991
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,160
What do you expect me to do now?

992
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,680
Join the Planning Commission

993
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,080
I'll call you back
when things cool down again.

994
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,840
Sir, I had no interest
in a government job.

995
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,920
I only wanted to work for you.

996
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,280
I have an offer from Business Standard
as their Editor.

997
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,160
That's even better than
the Planning Commission.

998
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,960
Journalism suits you better.

999
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,040
Nair, come in.

1000
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,960
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,720
What a weak man.

1002
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:37,080
A scandal that rocked
the whole nation.

1003
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,560
Tape Scandal.

1004
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,840
Conversations of Politicians,
Journalists

1005
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,640
and Power Brokers
was out in the open.

1006
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,560
How do they appoint the ministers?

1007
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,800
Everyone could hear
who the reporters actually served.

1008
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,200
Almost everyone was exposed.

1009
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,400
After the Nira Radia tapes,

1010
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,816
the country has lent their support
with the Anna Hazare's campaign

1011
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,200
against the 2G, 3G,
and Coalgate scams.

1012
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,840
And the Anna Campaign has
become the voice of the country.

1013
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,200
UPA Government may sound dismissive
about the Anna Panels Lokpal Bill.

1014
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,760
But team Anna is warning
the government that it will

1015
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,400
have to confront the Electorate.

1016
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,520
If the PM is found involved in such
corruption, then that's very shameful.

1017
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,560
The people always see how our
leader functions, how he behaves.

1018
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,800
Be seated.

1019
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,560
Would you like some tea?
No, thank you.

1020
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,920
So Dr. Singh, tell me.

1021
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,160
Madam,

1022
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:14,200
I cannot continue in this way.

1023
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,480
But Dr. Singh,
with the steep rise in inflation,

1024
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,360
and the number of
corruption scams being exposed

1025
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,720
the media is
completely against us.

1026
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,880
How can Rahul take over
in a situation like this?

1027
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,320
But Madam, you must find a way.

1028
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,920
This is not the time for a change.

1029
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:51,120
But I have to own up
to mistakes committed by others.

1030
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:56,480
How will I explain
this to the people?

1031
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,120
That's not your job.

1032
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:07,920
The party has many competent people to
explain the people in the right away.

1033
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,320
But Madam, I think...

1034
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,640
Are you sure
you don't want a cup of tea?

1035
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,800
Look, there are two kinds of loss.

1036
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,200
Actual and Notional.

1037
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,040
The actual loss is a real loss.

1038
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,760
And a notional loss
is just notional.

1039
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:34,680
CAG's estimate in the 2G spectrum
scam is just a notional loss.

1040
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,880
Understand.

1041
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,080
Sir, sir, sir...

1042
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,600
- Sir, sir...
- One question, sir!

1043
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,760
Sir, please!

1044
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,680
You mean to say, Sir, that the
Controller Auditor General is wrong.

1045
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,920
All I am saying is that
there have been no losses.

1046
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,720
Unbelievable, Mr. you just turned
around the entire mathematics.

1047
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,600
You turned a loss
of 17.6 billion to Zero.

1048
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,000
- Sir...
- Yes.

1049
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,920
What does your mathematics
say about the coal scam?

1050
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,960
Well... what loss?

1051
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,520
When there has been no digging,
and no coal retrieved

1052
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,720
then how can there be losses?
Understand.

1053
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,120
Sir. Sir...

1054
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,560
Sir. Sir...

1055
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:14,480
Sir, this time you turned
18.6 billion into Zero.

1056
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,800
Things got worse in a year.

1057
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,520
Dr. Singh was being openly mocked.

1058
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:26,360
Jokes about him were
posted over the internet.

1059
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:31,160
2G, CWG and Rahulji... were
more than a match for Dr Singh.

1060
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,280
And he was completely
silent about it.

1061
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,160
And during those days weird
things started happening with me.

1062
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,960
Excuse me, Mr. Baru.

1063
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,560
Advisor to the Prime Minister.

1064
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,040
Former Advisor.

1065
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,520
What is going on, sir?

1066
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,880
Why doesn't Mr Manmohan Singh
do something? Or say something?

1067
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:58,080
- Excuse me, Mr. Baru.
- Yes.

1068
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,280
My daughter's a journalist too.
Big fan.

1069
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,160
By the way, I have a question.

1070
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,360
Why did you quit the PMO?

1071
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,400
Come on, tell us.
I won't tell anyone.

1072
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,840
I find Dr Singh is like Bhism.

1073
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,440
With no evil.

1074
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,200
But a victim of family drama.

1075
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,960
Sir,

1076
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,320
there were two families in Mahabharata,

1077
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,360
but there's only one in India.

1078
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,520
Sir, sir, sir...

1079
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,240
Just a second. Just a second.

1080
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,800
Let me go there.

1081
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,360
There's been a lot of
debate over this ordinance.

1082
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,160
About what should be done about
this order from Supreme Court?

1083
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,320
I can't speak for others,

1084
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,680
but what I feel

1085
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,080
should be done

1086
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,440
with this ordinance.

1087
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,720
This.

1088
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,280
This is what needs to be done.

1089
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,080
Tear it up.

1090
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,600
This ordinance is nonsense.

1091
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,240
The UPA government was badly cornered
for trying to save the ordinance.

1092
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,601
The Opposition parties were
first opposing this ordinance,

1093
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,840
and now even Rahul Gandhi
has taken a stand against it.

1094
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,216
Rahul first gave a strong statement

1095
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,040
and then called this ordinance
utter nonsense

1096
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,440
and wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
asking for a reconsideration.

1097
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,480
'After Rahul's statement, the PM
talked about it to Sonia Gandhi.'

1098
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:48,880
We're talking to ex-media
advisor of PM, Mr Sanjaya Baru.

1099
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,720
Sir, what is your opinion
on Rahul's action.

1100
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,720
'The PM wants to resign,
says Baru.'

1101
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:59,240
Look, if his own party
people can't respect him

1102
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,480
then I believe that Dr Singh
should tender his resignation.

1103
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,080
Papa,

1104
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,720
Mr. Baru is right.

1105
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,960
What is the point now?

1106
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,760
How much more is the
Party going to humiliate you.

1107
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,360
Why don't you say something?

1108
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,320
Sir, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

1109
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:35,800
It's time to jot
down whatever I saw,

1110
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,720
heard, and understood
during my term in the PMO.

1111
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,360
Will you write about me too?

1112
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,480
Sir, writing the truth is very
crucial for the course of history.

1113
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,960
You're a genius,

1114
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:02,040
And it really pains me
when people laugh at you.

1115
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,880
I will write what I saw.

1116
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,520
About me too?

1117
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,440
I will do it sincerely.

1118
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,120
Even the bitter truth?

1119
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,040
That too.

1120
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,800
Maybe just that one.

1121
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:29,560
Sir, I don't know all
the aspects of the truth.

1122
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,400
In fact, I don't know
how many aspects are there.

1123
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,400
Except for yours and mine.

1124
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,640
I'll write our truth.

1125
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,960
Will you write about
this meeting as well.

1126
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,040
Come.

1127
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,440
I miss you, Sanjaya.

1128
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:08,560
I have a job for you,
which only you can do.

1129
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,080
Tell me, sir.

1130
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:15,680
My last press conference
is on the 3rd of January.

1131
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,280
What should I say to the nation?

1132
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,120
What about your speechwriters, sir?

1133
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,880
I wouldn't tell you
if it was their cup of tea.

1134
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,960
You must be my voice
for one last time.

1135
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,080
PM sir, you must be very aggressive.

1136
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,400
Elections are around the corner, and
the press would want to corner you.

1137
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,640
You must deflect all
the attacks on Rahul.

1138
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,400
That I cannot do.
I am there, sir.

1139
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,960
I'll write your speech.
You will understand everything.

1140
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,800
The party wants to make
Dr Singh a liability.

1141
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,200
And, I will never let that happen.

1142
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:18,320
I don't want a third term.

1143
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:27,600
In a few months time,
after the general elections.

1144
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:35,880
I will hand over this
post to the new Prime Minister.

1145
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:46,800
I hope he will be
a Pm chosen by the UPA

1146
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:55,640
and our party will keep
working in that direction.

1147
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:05,160
I firmly believe,
that our new generation leader

1148
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,800
will take this country ahead.

1149
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,640
Sir, is this a goodbye?

1150
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,920
Sir, you never said anything
against any corruption scandal.

1151
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,800
Would you like to comment on it?
What is your opinion?

1152
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,240
Will Rahul Gandhi
be the next PM candidate?

1153
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,120
Have you been made
a sacrificial lamb?

1154
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:40,720
I am sure that history

1155
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:48,960
won't look at me from
the media's point of view.

1156
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,840
India doesn't need one
watchman to stand guard.

1157
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:43,960
India needs millions of guards.

1158
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:56,280
A few days ago Prince Charming
was here.

1159
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,680
These days he keeps thinking
about me, day and night.

1160
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:06,720
The elections are for India, and he's
holding me accountable for Gujarat.

1161
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,520
You people did nothing, but I will.

1162
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,160
I will give you power.
I will give you knowledge.

1163
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,960
'Long live...'

1164
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,320
The government run by
Mom Son duo is virtually out.

1165
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:31,880
Even the jailbirds
can't save Congress.

1166
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,160
I request you to stay
for 10 more minutes.

1167
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,400
Please hear what Rahul has to say.

1168
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,480
Can you take back this election,

1169
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,600
or you have already lost it
before it begun.

1170
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,280
Because most of the
survey are saying...

1171
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,960
Congress will be reduced
to its lowest ever tally.

1172
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,400
What have you written?

1173
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,080
- Did you read it?
- Not yet.

1174
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:08,280
Dr Singh has been reading
every single line since morning.

1175
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,080
What did you write?

1176
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,880
Did he say anything? Is he happy?

1177
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,280
Seems like it.

1178
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,760
Come and meet him.

1179
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,280
I am boarding my flight now.

1180
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,960
I'll call as soon as I land.

1181
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,920
'Just like Bheeshm, Dr Singh
too committed the same mistake.'

1182
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,720
'He too put the family first'

1183
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,560
'He took a step back so
that Rahul could move ahead.'

1184
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,440
'The family was more important
to him than the party.'

1185
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,680
'Maybe that was his biggest mistake.'

1186
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,640
Does Dr Singh know
that I want to talk to him...

1187
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,840
That Sanjaya Baru
wants to talk to him?

1188
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,440
Boss, are you sure, because...

1189
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,080
PMO will give its reply tomorrow.

1190
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,840
What?

1191
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,480
Hello.

1192
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,400
Hello.

1193
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,240
Baru, bad news.
The book sales are down.

1194
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:24,760
I thought if we release it during the
elections, it will attract good sales.

1195
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:27,160
But I think my plan
doesn't seem to be working.

1196
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,520
Hello. What's wrong?

1197
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,440
Where are you lost?

1198
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,840
It's been three days, and
Dr Singh hasn't called back yet.

1199
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:45,160
Sanjaya Baru's book,
The Accidental Prime Minister

1200
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,120
was written for personal interest.

1201
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:52,440
We completely deny all its facts.

1202
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:57,560
It harms the respect
of a responsible post.

1203
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:01,880
Sanjaya Baru has betrayed
the PMO by writing this book.

1204
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:12,640
Congrats, Mr Baru.
The PMO has done your job for you.

1205
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,200
Book sales are an all-time high.

1206
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,600
Now start writing
your next book pretty soon.

1207
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:28,160
So what if I get a bad name,
at least I'll get a name... Mr Patel.

1208
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,520
Dr. Singh.

1209
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,520
Dr. Singh.

1210
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,480
Sir!

1211
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,080
We never met again.

1212
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,640
I still wonder how accurate

1213
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,240
he found my truth to be.

1214
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:51,280
Maybe I will get my answer.
Maybe not.

1215
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:58,880
But I will never regain
what I lost in Dr Singh.
