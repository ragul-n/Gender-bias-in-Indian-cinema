careful as the police is searching

He thinks we are fools?

83
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:17,701
You must have said that we are 
smart enough to kill and escape

This is not a singing 
competition, it is auditions for RJ

00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:15,656
What's happening in Sonagach?

511
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:18,024
They have bought small 
girls here and undressing them

512
00:48:18,716 --> 00:48:20,590
The hands that mist hold pen and 
books are holding contraceptives

513
00:48:21,336 --> 00:48:25,023
The money that guys take from 
the brokers is equal to shit

514
00:48:26,485 --> 00:48:28,759
Which rules and 
permissions? I too know about them

515
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:30,607
Permission is given only if 
they are above 18 years of age

516
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,297
Old men are coming here 
to romance 10 year old girls

517
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:36,987
You guys are saluting them 
instead of hitting with your shoes

518
00:48:38,155 --> 00:48:41,636
I'm already in tension that I 
didn't find the missing child yet

519
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,934
A raid must be conducted in this 
area within the next one hour

520
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:47,881
Else I will shoot all the brokers in this 
area even though it's not under my limits

521
00:48:56,805 --> 00:49:00,569
Why is he staring at me? 
Did he get to know about us?

522
00:50:59,428 --> 00:51:01,338
-Sir, what happened? 
-Nothing, please come

523
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:17,106
-What will you have? 
-I don't want anything sir

524
00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:21,138
You need strength atleast to search 
your daughter, isn't it? Eat something

525
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:26,112
When the daughter is struggling some 
where, how will a mother feel hungry sir?

526
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:32,026
I don't know if she has eaten 
anything, she can't bear hunger

527
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:34,466
Sir, your order please

528
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:37,480
-Two toasts 
-Okay

529
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:40,265
I can understand your pain

530
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:44,445
I have passed the message everywhere, 
they are searching with personal interest

531
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:46,243
We'll definitely find her, don't worry

532
00:51:46,713 --> 00:51:49,839
Ramesh, police must have known the matter

533
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:52,898
If I wasn't watchful, 
they would have picked me up

534
00:51:53,555 --> 00:51:55,104
We must leave this city first

535
00:51:55,353 --> 00:51:59,364
We must collect the money and 
escape from here as soon as possible

536
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:00,941
I'll call him right away

537
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:08,804
Why are you not paying us? We can't keep 
the child in the box and roam the city

538
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:11,484
I won't spare you if you 
keep delaying the deal

539
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:15,915
You're playing with us even 
after knowing how bad we are

540
00:52:16,476 --> 00:52:20,200
It doesn't matter for the 
knife if it is you or a child

541
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,502
Okay, kill her by today 
evening, you'll get the money

542
00:52:24,702 --> 00:52:26,577
Don't mistake me that I'm 
asking you this again and again

543
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:32,018
It's been a day that she went missing, we 
looked for her everywhere till Sonagachi

544
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:38,688
Neither have you received a call for 
ransom, so some known person has done this

545
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:40,800
Think again

546
00:52:41,788 --> 00:52:46,213
Your friends, relatives, neighbours, 
do you have doubt on anyone?

547
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,113
-There is no one like that 
-Try to remember

548
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:52,932
Any property disputes or 
activity that involves money...

549
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:56,677
...any clashes that 
happened few years back

550
00:52:56,877 --> 00:53:01,419
It can be anything, 
a small hint can lead us to her

551
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:07,515
Ah! Puneet!

552
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:10,812
I was working at a 
hotel as a receptionist

553
00:53:11,012 --> 00:53:14,458
Puneet was my colleague there, 
he is younger than me

554
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:18,250
Since he was from my 
native, we got close very soon

555
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:21,983
[phone ringing]

556
00:53:23,212 --> 00:53:26,276
-Good afternoon, reception-Hello Devaki, this is Puneet

557
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:29,788
-Come to room no 702, it's urgent  
-Why? What happened?

558
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:30,984
Please come, I'll tell

559
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:38,511
Puneet

560
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,503
-Why did you call? 
-I love you Devaki!

561
00:53:45,703 --> 00:53:48,709
-I love you! 
-What's wrong with you? Behave yourself

562
00:53:49,397 --> 00:53:51,778
How many days will we keep 
the desire with in ourselves?

563
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:54,846
Come, let's celebrate 
our desire on bed today

564
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:55,878
What!

565
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:02,787
I didn't know you were so 
cheap, what do you think about me?

566
00:54:03,379 --> 00:54:05,658
Cheap? Me?

567
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,967
You never had any such desire?

568
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:15,386
You wanted me while going and coming 
from home, you were so close on bike

569
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:18,180
You did all this without 
any desire in yourself?

570
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,175
At your home, your elder sister will also 
come with you on bike and move closely

571
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:24,404
She'll hold hands with you and gift you

572
00:54:24,604 --> 00:54:26,639
So, you'll tell her to come to room?

573
00:54:28,252 --> 00:54:31,713
I moved with you not because 
you must be like my husband

574
00:54:31,913 --> 00:54:34,890
I wanted you be like my sibling 
though we aren't blood relatives

575
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,414
Damn! Disgusting!

576
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:53,979
Puneet, how come you are here? 
Why you aren't coming for work these days?

577
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:58,838
Oh! You think I'll scold you? 
Don't take it your heart

578
00:54:59,038 --> 00:55:00,946
I have forgotten 
everything, you too forget it

579
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:03,520
I will never forget that

580
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:08,079
Look Devaki, I've fallen for your beauty

581
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:11,929
I have never seen you as my 
sister, come, let's marry

582
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:14,449
Hey! Don't talk nonsense!

583
00:55:15,124 --> 00:55:16,636
I'm married and I have a daughter.

584
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:18,280
But you don't have a husband

585
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:24,537
I'll be a good husband and a good 
father, agree for this marriage

586
00:55:24,737 --> 00:55:28,902
Never! My daughter is my 
world and I'm alive for her sake

587
00:55:29,102 --> 00:55:30,978
I want to give her a good future

588
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:36,411
-This is my final decision 
-Oh! Your daughter is your world?

589
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:40,898
You don't want anything other than 
your daughter? What if I kill her?

590
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:42,488
-Puneet! 
-Don't shout

591
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,180
I'm not threatening 
you, I'll prove it to you

592
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:56,587
I was very scared after he said 
that, I even lodged a police complaint

593
00:55:57,341 --> 00:55:58,473
I never saw him again

594
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:02,031
Sir, it is true that I loved her...

595
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:06,363
...it's true that I had called her to room 
and it's also true that I threatened her

596
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:10,229
I had gone to that extent 
that I wanted to kill her...

597
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:13,301
...daughter and get her sir

598
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:18,749
But I kept quiet after I 
got to know her true colours

599
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:21,330
If her husband comes back some day...

600
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,905
...can I lead a life with 
her on alternate days sir?

601
00:56:24,105 --> 00:56:26,900
-You tell me sir 
-How can a dead husband come back?

602
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:32,743
Who told you that her husband is dead? 
He is still alive sir

603
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,479
Ask her to swear on her 
daughter and tell that

604
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:43,372
Are you kidding me? 
I told you not to hide anything from me

605
00:56:43,787 --> 00:56:48,171
Do you know why I have left all other work 
and showing personal interest in this?

606
00:56:49,654 --> 00:56:53,614
I have gone through the pain and 
struggle that you are going through now

607
00:56:55,554 --> 00:56:59,147
My 8 year old son, 
didn't return back from school

608
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:01,622
After 2 days we found his body

609
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:07,634
The pain from the day he went missing 
to until we found his body was too much

610
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:14,903
It's true that we measure the pain 
when we get to know that our child is dead

611
00:57:16,664 --> 00:57:19,051
But when we know that they are missing...

612
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:23,310
...the pain that we go through 
every minute, every second is horrible

613
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:29,096
I know how it is, 
that's the reason I'm helping you

614
00:57:29,504 --> 00:57:34,542
-But you... lied to me 
-Sorry sir, I didn't lie intentionally

615
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,980
My husband is dead for me

616
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:41,112
I say that to everyone, not only you

617
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:45,699
Before I became a 
receptionist, I was working in an NGO

618
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:49,073
Those days were the most 
peaceful days of my life

619
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,061
Like how the God in the temple, 
gives us happiness...

620
00:57:54,261 --> 00:57:56,707
...by understanding our feeling 
without even talking to us

621
00:57:56,907 --> 00:58:01,714
Those kids couldn't speak, 
but they used to respond to our feelings

622
00:58:02,434 --> 00:58:05,637
I was living my life thinking 
that those kids are my world...

623
00:58:05,837 --> 00:58:08,608
...but Tarun came into 
my life unexpectedly

624
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:15,809
To build a strong relationship we don't 
have to know that person for years

625
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:19,213
Small reasons are enough 
to come close to our hearts

626
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:23,528
In the same way, 
I started liking Tarun for small reasons

627
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:35,077
I was so happy that I thought I would 
miss a golden life if I didn't marry him

628
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:43,621
After 2 years of Aradhya's 
birth, he quit his job and...

629
00:58:44,035 --> 00:58:46,811
...invested in shares and suffered a 
loss though I said him not to do that

630
00:58:47,011 --> 00:58:48,251
He started consuming alcohol

631
00:58:49,715 --> 00:58:54,072
Slowly, he talked very less 
and I forgot how to smile

632
00:58:55,057 --> 00:58:57,525
When he got to know that I 
was conceived for second time...

633
00:58:57,725 --> 00:59:02,078
...he was afraid that I'll quit my 
job and he asked me to abort the baby

634
00:59:02,551 --> 00:59:05,230
I didn't agree for that 
and we started arguing

635
00:59:06,021 --> 00:59:06,993
Then...

636
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:07,998
[glass breaks]

637
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,718
[music mutes voice]

638
00:59:10,074 --> 00:59:11,131
[groans]

639
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:13,796
[groans]

640
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:18,131
[screams]

641
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:34,578
[door bell ringing]

642
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:44,893
-Is this Tarun's house? 
-Yes, I'm his wife

643
00:59:45,093 --> 00:59:49,217
-Can you please call him? 
-Actually, he is not in town

644
00:59:49,655 --> 00:59:50,877
He is on a business trip

645
00:59:51,281 --> 00:59:55,032
-Oh... can I have his phone number? 
-Why officer? What happened?

646
00:59:55,232 --> 00:59:58,669
-Nothing to worry, just a small enquiry 
-Oh! Please note down

647
00:59:58,869 --> 01:00:00,288
-720... 
-720

648
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:04,247
-4912932 
-Thank you

649
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:15,174
Hey idiot! You have blood 
stains on your shirt, go clean it

650
01:00:32,143 --> 01:00:34,026
This stain isn't going even 
after washing multiple times

651
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:38,406
Hey! 
Talk in low voice, what if anyone hears?

652
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,031
Who knows Kannada here dude?

653
01:00:40,593 --> 01:00:43,547
Dude, once we get the 
money let's go absconding

654
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:45,504
-Bro, bill 
-How much?

655
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:46,951
500 bucks

656
01:00:48,194 --> 01:00:50,283
-Here, keep the change 
-Thank you, bro.

657
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,040
Make a phone call to him

658
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:22,039
-This is the place, isn't it? 
-Yes, definitely

659
01:01:22,862 --> 01:01:23,833
Ask where he is?

660
01:01:26,195 --> 01:01:30,304
Hello, we are at the place, 
where are you dude?

661
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:32,282
I'm at the bank, 
I'll be there in 10 minutes

662
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:33,360
Okay, come soon

663
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,598
-He said he'll be in here 10 minutes 
-Let him come

664
01:01:46,322 --> 01:01:48,104
It's been 10 minutes 
and he didn't come yet

665
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:51,377
-What happened? 
-His phone is switched off

666
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:55,674
He fooled us, we shouldn't spare 
him, let's go to the club and kill him

667
01:01:55,874 --> 01:01:58,815
-Keep the stuff ready 
-Hey wait

668
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:02,342
He is following us from that time, 
he must be from the crime branch

669
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:03,392
Come on, let's go

670
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:08,205
-Run! 
-Stop!

671
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:11,121
Hey!

672
01:02:18,523 --> 01:02:19,395
Stop!

673
01:02:24,386 --> 01:02:28,506
-How far will you run? 
-Sir, no, please!

674
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:29,965
Sir! No, please!

675
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,937
If you run, I'll kill him

676
01:02:33,137 --> 01:02:35,006
-Get up! 
-You run man!

677
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:37,788
-You're telling him to run? 
-Hey! Go man!

678
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:41,093
-What are you doing here? 
-Sir, someone said they'll give us loan

679
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,703
Who will give money for 
loan in a graveyard?

680
01:02:44,382 --> 01:02:46,524
-Hey! Go man! 
-Hey! Come here

681
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:49,781
-Hey! What's that blood stain? Tell me 
-Sir, we didn't do anything

682
01:02:50,545 --> 01:02:53,709
-Sir, we didn't do anything 
-I know, come with me

683
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:56,376
Hey! Get up! Move!

684
01:02:56,674 --> 01:02:58,653
Who's vehicle is this? 
From where did you rob it?

685
01:02:58,853 --> 01:02:59,737
This is our car sir

686
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:09,066
-How did you get this girl's photo? 
-I swear, we don't know sir

687
01:03:09,266 --> 01:03:11,579
I swear on my mom sir, 
we don't know, who is she sir?

688
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:23,480
-Where is the girl? 
-We don't know sir

689
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,753
-Where is the girl? 
-We don't know sir

690
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,715
Without knowing her, you guys are 
having her photo and roaming around?

691
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:34,242
-Check the vehicle 
-Okay sir

692
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:44,550
-Sir, there is a box in the car 
-Hey! Show me what's there in it

693
01:03:44,931 --> 01:03:46,677
-Sir 
-Move!

694
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:48,594
Hey! Come here

695
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:51,880
-What's there in the box? 
-There are scrap items in it

696
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,959
There is nothing in 
this box sir, it's empty

697
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:56,219
-Open it! 
-Sir...

698
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:58,155
Open it! Open it you!

699
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:07,723
Damn you idiots! 
What are you doing with this dog?

700
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:10,242
-Sir, don't hit, I'll tell you 
-Tell fast

701
01:04:10,442 --> 01:04:13,203
Sir, my name is Ramesh and 
his name is Suresh

702
01:04:13,403 --> 01:04:18,923
We are from Huchmaranahalli, my lover 
said only if I have money she'll marry me

703
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:22,661
I wanted money for my love and 
he wanted money to romance a girl

704
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:24,542
We just wanted a way 
to make some easy money

705
01:04:24,742 --> 01:04:27,781
When we were roaming cities, 
we got to know about this dog club sir

706
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:39,724
If we put 1 rupee in that we get back 
100, so we put 1000 bucks and won one lac

707
01:04:39,924 --> 01:04:45,509
In the greed to win a crore, we put 
all the money and lost everything in it

708
01:04:46,438 --> 01:04:50,816
But we wanted to play more atleast by 
taking loan, but no one gave us loan

709
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:56,466
That's when we met 
Deepesh, he is the dog club owner

710
01:04:59,377 --> 01:05:02,861
He gave us this girls photo and said 
if we kidnap her, he'll give us 10 lacs

711
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:07,793
We took the deal and followed her, 
but couldn't kidnap this girl

712
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:08,861
Why?

713
01:05:09,061 --> 01:05:12,013
I already told you sir, 
this idiot is crazy about girls

714
01:05:12,213 --> 01:05:16,597
He said he has found a new girl and 
we went to meet her though I said no

715
01:05:16,797 --> 01:05:19,764
By the time we came back, 
there was no one at the radio station

716
01:05:19,964 --> 01:05:22,896
When we thought we had missed 
the deal, Deepesh called us

717
01:05:23,096 --> 01:05:26,996
He said we have done everything correctly 
and we'll get money tomorrow evening

718
01:05:27,196 --> 01:05:32,024
We thought anyway he is fooled, 
let's grab the money and escape

719
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,123
Why are you keeping this dog 
in the box and roaming around?

720
01:05:34,323 --> 01:05:36,059
Sir, this is a good fighter 
dog for the dog club

721
01:05:36,259 --> 01:05:41,320
So we a plan that we'll kidnap 
this dog and make our own dog club

722
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,105
With this dog, we thought we can make good 
money, so we injected it and kidnapped it

723
01:05:47,233 --> 01:05:48,728
By then, we lost our luck

724
01:05:49,194 --> 01:05:51,713
He opened the box to give food for 
the dog but the dog attacked him

725
01:05:52,184 --> 01:05:56,288
When he was washing the blood stain at 
the bar, sir got doubt on us and locked us

726
01:05:57,122 --> 01:05:58,151
Where will I find him now?

727
01:05:58,810 --> 01:05:59,819
Sir, why?

728
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:01,849
-Sir, I too know about the law 
-Shut up and move!

729
01:06:02,305 --> 01:06:04,632
-Sir, why are you taking me? 
-I'll tell that to you in station

730
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:06,372
Sir, why should I come to the station?

731
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,383
-Get inside 
-Sir, leave me

732
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:11,013
-Open the door 
-Sir, I haven't done anything wrong

733
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:12,636
-Not fair sir 
-Hey! Get in

734
01:06:21,897 --> 01:06:26,048
Sir, I will definitely file a defamation 
case, what did I do that you arrested me?

735
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:29,184
I'm paying every month to police 
for the business that I'm doing

736
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:35,071
-You are arrested in kidnap case 
-Kidnap? Oh my God! Who said so?

737
01:06:36,582 --> 01:06:39,151
Idiot! If you act, I'll you on the spot

738
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,302
Why have you offered 
them money for kidnapping?

739
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:44,447
These idiots are caught?

740
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:48,437
Sir, you have listened to these 
stupid fellows and arrested me?

741
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:52,126
-I'm seeing them for the first time sir 
-Sir, he is lying

742
01:06:52,326 --> 01:06:57,643
Sir, listening to these guys you have 
touched a gentleman, you'll regret it

743
01:06:58,424 --> 01:07:01,091
-You idiot! 
-Sir, why are you hitting me?

744
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:03,100
Shut up and stand! You are threatening me?

745
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,304
What wrong did I do sir?

746
01:07:11,342 --> 01:07:12,879
Why have you said 
them to kidnap this girl?

747
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:16,662
This girl? 
Sir, she is my own sister's daughter

748
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:21,385
What? She is your sister's daughter?

749
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:25,770
Yes sir, she is my sister's 
daughter, why will I kidnap her?

750
01:07:27,074 --> 01:07:28,355
Excuse me sir, 
please come to the computer room

751
01:07:31,171 --> 01:07:32,341
Go and sit in that corner

752
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:38,452
Sir, while checking for the hit and 
run case that happened yesterday...

753
01:07:38,652 --> 01:07:39,856
...we found this clipping sir

754
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:44,057
She has given complaint that he daughter 
is missing since yesterday evening 7 pm

755
01:07:44,257 --> 01:07:47,370
But her daughter is with her at 8.30 pm

756
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:51,476
This lady has given complaint 
that her daughter is missing

757
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:54,332
That guy is telling, 
she is his sister's daughter

758
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,069
Sir, I swear on my son...

759
01:08:40,269 --> 01:08:43,195
...only because she said she'll pick 
up her daughter, I left her and came

760
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:47,256
We clearly informed every parent 
to pick their child at 7 pm sir

761
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,712
But she came at 11.30 pm

762
01:08:50,466 --> 01:08:52,643
It's height of irresponsibility sir

763
01:08:52,843 --> 01:08:54,485
How will a dead husband come back?

764
01:08:55,996 --> 01:09:00,708
Sir, who told you that her 
husband is dead? He is still alive

765
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:35,151
Sir, I swear on my mom, I haven't 
seen a cunning lady like her before

766
01:09:35,492 --> 01:09:38,551
Let my sister and bro in law 
come, they'll tell you everything

767
01:09:40,436 --> 01:09:41,687
-Come sis 
-Please sit

768
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:45,775
I told you not to believe her, 
you know how cunning she is?

769
01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:48,770
-Look, what nuisance she has created 
-Shut up

770
01:09:49,783 --> 01:09:53,760
-Police said everything about you 
-Sis, you don't believe me?

771
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,877
Hey, go and sit there

772
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:03,469
Sorry sir, 
he has misguided you regarding Devaki

773
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:08,579
Devaki is a nice woman, 
I know her since few years

774
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:14,485
Actually I'm from Mysore, 
after marriage I settled in Kolkata

775
01:10:15,742 --> 01:10:18,196
God gave us everything but kids

776
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:21,663
[clapping]

777
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:26,852
So, we used to visit orphanage 
very often, there we met Devaki

778
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:31,176
Within few days, 
Devaki became very close to us

779
01:10:31,376 --> 01:10:33,370
She was more than my sister

780
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,324
I used to invite her home 
for all the festivals

781
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:39,349
Along with Devaki, 
Aradhya was also coming to our house

782
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:44,773
Sometimes, I used to say that 
I'll adopt Aradhya as my daughter

783
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:50,414
She used just smile and 
keep quite, but one day...

784
01:10:53,732 --> 01:10:56,666
Devaki, you said you want to 
talk something, please tell

785
01:10:57,066 --> 01:11:02,890
You said you'll adopt 
Aradhya, will you adopt her?

786
01:11:04,546 --> 01:11:07,849
What are you saying 
Devaki? Are you serious?

787
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:12,121
Yes, I think Aradhya will be 
happy if she stays with you

788
01:11:12,746 --> 01:11:15,945
So, I have thought very 
carefully and have decided on this

789
01:11:16,674 --> 01:11:18,899
You'll take good care of her, will you?

790
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:23,084
Devaki, don't mistake me, 
do you have any financial problem?

791
01:11:23,284 --> 01:11:24,332
Please ask if you want any financial help

792
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:28,877
No, I have kept 4 lacs in 
fixed deposit in Aradhya's name

793
01:11:29,277 --> 01:11:30,673
I don't have any financial problem

794
01:11:30,873 --> 01:11:32,812
Just take care of her 
like your own daughter

795
01:11:33,012 --> 01:11:35,172
Sangeetha... why are you worried now?

796
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:37,781
You always asked god for a kid.

797
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,792
Now god has sent her!

798
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:45,263
Why this decision all of a sudden? 
I want to know the reason behind it

799
01:11:49,919 --> 01:11:51,001
Hello doctor, I'm Devaki

800
01:11:51,749 --> 01:11:56,376
Yes, what problem are you facing?

801
01:11:56,576 --> 01:11:59,958
Doctor, these days I get stressed a lot

802
01:12:00,626 --> 01:12:05,541
I get mood swings, 
I get confused for small things

803
01:12:06,843 --> 01:12:09,692
I'll forget the thing in my hand 
and search for it everywhere

804
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:12,187
I can't keep simple 
calculations in my mind

805
01:12:12,734 --> 01:12:15,207
Because of this, I'm facing a 
lot of trouble at my work doctor

806
01:12:17,306 --> 01:12:23,144
Is there any tragedy in your life 
that has disturbed your mind?

807
01:12:23,344 --> 01:12:28,493
Someone's death or you didn't get 
something that was close to your heart?

808
01:12:29,356 --> 01:12:35,225
My husband who used to say he can't live 
a second without me, has left me forever

809
01:12:38,741 --> 01:12:42,329
Get an MRI scan done, and come 
again after a week with the report

810
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:43,451
-Okay 
-Okay

811
01:12:45,246 --> 01:12:47,195
[traffic]

812
01:12:51,907 --> 01:12:54,995
-Who all are there at home? 
-Me and my daughter

813
01:12:55,195 --> 01:12:56,800
-What is she studying? 
-5th grade

814
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,628
-Your parents or relatives? 
-There is no one doctor

815
01:13:02,928 --> 01:13:08,868
I told you to come after a week with the 
report, but it's been more than 15 days

816
01:13:10,058 --> 01:13:12,296
Sorry doctor, I forgot

817
01:13:16,585 --> 01:13:21,935
Okay, I saw your reports, it's Dementia

818
01:13:23,509 --> 01:13:29,493
It's a sort of memory 
disorder, it's a brain disease

819
01:13:32,046 --> 01:13:36,573
People with disease 
gradually have memory loss

820
01:13:37,697 --> 01:13:43,058
You will slowly start forgetting 
your language, your regular work...

821
01:13:43,258 --> 01:13:47,453
...your house address, 
any you'll forget everything one by one

822
01:13:47,653 --> 01:13:51,437
One day, you'll forget yourself completely

823
01:13:55,686 --> 01:14:00,095
Look Devaki, as a friend I 
would suggest you only one thing

824
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:03,602
Before you reach the final stage...

825
01:14:04,421 --> 01:14:10,387
...leave your daughter with whom 
you trust or join her in a hostel

826
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:13,573
She must have a good future

827
01:14:18,406 --> 01:14:22,160
[crying]

828
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:27,772
I can't live without my daughter

829
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,724
After she said that, 
we didn't ask anything further

830
01:14:38,151 --> 01:14:43,597
We finished the adoption formalities 
and waited for her the previous day

831
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:49,278
Previous day I had called and 
messaged Devaki, but she didn't answer

832
01:14:49,478 --> 01:14:53,289
We were thinking why she didn't 
reply, now we got to know the matter

833
01:14:54,081 --> 01:14:57,742
Please sir, find Aradhya for me

834
01:14:57,973 --> 01:15:00,454
-We are trying our best 
-Thank you sir

835
01:15:04,686 --> 01:15:06,749
If you want your 
daughter, you have two options

836
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:10,869
One, bring the money to the place 
we say, you'll get your daughter

837
01:15:11,069 --> 01:15:15,657
Else, come with police, you'll get your 
daughter, she just won't be breathing

838
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:20,944
Sir please, I'll come at the right 
time, don't do anything to my daughter

839
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:22,746
Hello! Hello!

840
01:15:56,482 --> 01:15:58,778
Devaki, did you find Aradhya?

841
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,436
Sir, Howrah bridge

842
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:40,538
[traffic]

843
01:17:10,711 --> 01:17:13,776
-Please go sir 
-Road is jammed, how can I go?

844
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:17,400
-Please go fast 
-It's jammed, how can I go?

845
01:17:19,314 --> 01:17:23,071
-Go fast-It's jammed, I can't go

846
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:27,402
[phone ringing]

847
01:17:29,106 --> 01:17:30,724
-Hello-I think you don't want your daughter

848
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:35,218
-I'll kill her, collect her dead body 
-Sir, I...

849
01:17:39,854 --> 01:17:43,249
Sir, I'm at Howrah Bridge's entrance, 
tell me where I should come

850
01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:44,414
But the time given to you is over

851
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:49,056
Sorry sir, I'm struct in traffic jam, I'm 
at the entrance, where I should come

852
01:17:49,256 --> 01:17:51,249
-Come to 19th pillar  
-I'm coming right now

853
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:59,211
-Madam, my money? Where are you going? 
-Oh my!

854
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:06,006
-Madam, what are you doing? 
-Take it

855
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:31,522
Hello sir, I'm at 19th pillar

856
01:18:31,722 --> 01:18:34,821
Okay, listen to me carefully

857
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:39,220
Put the money in the market that is 
in the left side and go home

858
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:42,450
-Your daughter will come home  
-Sir, if someone else takes it?

859
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,313
Don't act smart, do what I say

860
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,416
Okay sir

861
01:19:36,591 --> 01:19:39,849
Hello sir, I have put the bag as you said

862
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:44,408
You are playing around with us? 
You want the police to catch us, is it?

863
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:46,437
-Forget your daughter  
-Why sir?

864
01:19:46,978 --> 01:19:51,994
What wrong did I do sir? I have put 
the bag the same place where you said

865
01:19:52,194 --> 01:19:55,031
I asked you to put the bag 
in the left side market...

866
01:19:55,771 --> 01:19:59,324
...but you purposely put it to right 
side and now acting like you don't know

867
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:04,119
I put it in confusion, 
not purposefully, sorry sir

868
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:05,319
Give me 5 minutes times sir, 
I'll put it in the place that you said

869
01:20:46,994 --> 01:20:47,918
That's my bag!

870
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:53,676
-This is my bag, give it to me please 
-No, I won't give

871
01:20:53,876 --> 01:20:58,263
-Please give it to me 
-No, no

872
01:21:43,624 --> 01:21:45,035
[phone ringing]

873
01:21:45,535 --> 01:21:51,292
Hello sir, as you said I put the 
bag in the flower market side

874
01:21:51,492 --> 01:21:53,951
-Don't do anything to my daughter 
-What are you saying?

875
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:58,765
Why do you have to put the bag in the 
market? Where is the child? Where are you?

876
01:22:10,854 --> 01:22:12,407
Come on, let's go to the flower market

877
01:22:22,392 --> 01:22:23,335
Mom!

878
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:31,330
Mom! Mom!

879
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:37,727
Aradhya! 
"There is no greater God than a mother"

880
01:22:59,315 --> 01:23:00,558
-Dude 
-Yes, tell me

881
01:23:00,758 --> 01:23:04,683
I got the money, sell that girl to Mumbai 
broker and come to our meeting place

882
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:05,886
Okay, fine

883
01:23:12,524 --> 01:23:15,765
-Move the car! 
-Hey! Why did you come in wrong way?

884
01:23:15,965 --> 01:23:20,204
Whom do you want to meet in 
hurry? Take out your car first, idiot!

885
01:23:20,404 --> 01:23:21,724
-Are you deaf? 
-Huh?

886
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:24,335
-Are you blind and deaf? 
-Do you know who I am?

887
01:23:25,443 --> 01:23:27,648
-Does you dad own the road? 
-Trying to be smart with me?

888
01:23:28,339 --> 01:23:32,183
-What will you do? 
-Go or I'll kill you!

889
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:33,320
-Whats the fuss about? 
-See sir!

890
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,221
-Go, sit in your vehicles! 
-He is acting smart!

891
01:23:35,421 --> 01:23:37,192
Remove the cars now. Go!

892
01:23:38,402 --> 01:23:39,693
Take out your car, fast!

893
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:47,637
-Hey! Who's bag is that? 
-My girlfriend's sir.

894
01:23:55,879 --> 01:23:58,242
Hey! Stop!

895
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:00,816
Hey! Stop!

896
01:24:25,201 --> 01:24:28,956
Hey police, you did a very big mistake 
by touching me while you were in uniform

897
01:24:29,156 --> 01:24:30,587
I'm polluted now

898
01:24:30,787 --> 01:24:36,147
If I have become clean now, I must 
bathe in the blood of yours and that...

899
01:24:36,347 --> 01:24:38,049
...lady who gave you complaint

900
01:24:38,891 --> 01:24:40,116
You idiot! 
[man groans]

901
01:24:44,233 --> 01:24:47,071
Don't give a chance to do that, 
I'm saying it for your good

902
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:50,508
Shoot me! Come on shoot me!

903
01:25:00,415 --> 01:25:02,899
Why? Don't you have guts?

904
01:25:03,493 --> 01:25:06,308
If you dodn't shoot me, I'll shoot you

905
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:11,358
If you kill me, 
my guys will definitely kill you

906
01:25:11,558 --> 01:25:13,662
Your death is now confirmed

907
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:18,026
You want to know who 
we are before you die?

908
01:25:18,896 --> 01:25:23,502
We are three guys together, we aren't 
just criminals but notorious criminals

909
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:26,495
We target only millionaire's children

910
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:29,813
We never miss our target

911
01:25:31,082 --> 01:25:33,667
The weakness of the 
parents is our strength

912
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:41,062
They love their mobile 
phones more than their kids

913
01:25:42,922 --> 01:25:44,712
We wait for such chances

914
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:50,993
For 2 days we watch, 3rd day they are 
our target and 4th day we kidnap them

915
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:58,548
Her father, who is an idiot, gave police 
complaint, you know what we did to her?

916
01:26:08,017 --> 01:26:13,613
[music]

917
01:26:19,266 --> 01:26:21,987
"We are bad guys, we give you pain"

918
01:26:22,187 --> 01:26:24,721
"We never show mercy"

919
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:30,490
"The woman whom we see, 
will never go back to her home"

920
01:26:31,326 --> 01:26:33,983
"We are the demons who 
fall behind your back"

921
01:26:34,511 --> 01:26:37,261
"We'll kill the ones who stop us"

922
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:39,784
"We commit sins like rascals"

923
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:43,089
"The city is filled with lust"

924
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:46,198
"This world is a miserable place"

925
01:26:46,398 --> 01:26:48,962
"We are bad guys, we give you pain"

926
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:51,384
"We never show mercy"

927
01:26:52,028 --> 01:26:57,434
"The woman whom we see, 
will never go back to her home"

928
01:26:59,856 --> 01:27:02,089
You are idiots who blackmail 
and eat shit with that money

929
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:03,858
Do you know the pain that 
the parents go through?

930
01:27:04,494 --> 01:27:07,727
Idiots! That lady isn't a millionaire, 
why did you kidnap her daughter?

931
01:27:10,262 --> 01:27:11,176
Tell me!

932
01:27:12,525 --> 01:27:17,650
Sir, she wasn't our target yesterday, 
but minister Ramnath Basu's son

933
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:27,777
As per the information we got his mom will 
come to pick up her son from FM station

934
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:31,235
But, his father came with 
escort to pick him up

935
01:27:32,311 --> 01:27:34,516
We were upset that we 
didn't get the deal...

936
01:27:34,784 --> 01:27:37,891
...while returning, we saw this girl 
standing alone under the flyover

937
01:27:41,747 --> 01:27:45,941
Our day isn't complete if we don't have 
a girl, alcohol and drugs on that day

938
01:27:46,526 --> 01:27:51,198
Any middle class family will have 
atleast 10 lacs in the girls name

939
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:55,880
We thought first we'll take the money from 
her and then sell her to Bombay's broker

940
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,029
We kidnapped her

941
01:27:57,229 --> 01:27:59,823
"This is a miserable world"

942
01:28:15,926 --> 01:28:17,823
-Where is that girl now? 
-Who knows?

943
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:21,233
By now, our guys would have sold her

944
01:28:21,433 --> 01:28:23,163
Even if we search for her 
now, we will not find her

945
01:28:33,088 --> 01:28:35,511
-What happened? 
-I don't know where Guru went

946
01:28:35,966 --> 01:28:37,403
His phone is not reachable for a while now

947
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:40,165
Don't worry, just keep 
quiet, he'll come in sometime

948
01:28:40,365 --> 01:28:41,646
He said he'll come in 10 minutes

949
01:28:41,846 --> 01:28:44,743
He is getting me tensed by not 
getting connected over phone

950
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,537
Hey! Keep this here

951
01:28:48,863 --> 01:28:52,046
-Give me a cigarette 
-I don't have, it's all over

952
01:28:52,664 --> 01:28:53,630
[phone ringing]

953
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:58,702
Hello, yes bro, 
I'm in Kalighat, where are you?

954
01:28:58,902 --> 01:29:00,952
Yes, I'm leaving now, I'll be there

955
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,617
I'll be there in 5 minutes

956
01:29:15,853 --> 01:29:18,273
His phone is switched off, 
what shall I do now?

957
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:23,622
I had got a call from another number

958
01:29:29,007 --> 01:29:33,556
[phone ringing]

959
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:02,767
[phone ringing]

960
01:30:23,031 --> 01:30:25,413
[phone ringing]

961
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:15,539
-Hi dear, how are you? 
-Yes, I'm good

962
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,542
Hello mom, can you hear me?

963
01:31:25,384 --> 01:31:26,758
-Aradhya? 
-Mom!

964
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:29,899
-Aradhya, where are you dear? 
-Mom, I don't know

965
01:31:30,099 --> 01:31:32,576
-Hello Aradhya 
-Mom, where are you? Come soon

966
01:31:33,639 --> 01:31:36,817
I don't know where I am, 
I'm feeling breathless

967
01:31:38,461 --> 01:31:41,724
I can't be here, come soon mom

968
01:31:41,924 --> 01:31:44,208
Don't cry dear, talk something, tell me

969
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:49,197
-I'm getting scared, please come soon 
-Don't get scared, you must be brave

970
01:31:49,397 --> 01:31:53,845
You're a strong girl, you used to tell 
friends to be strong, now it's your turn

971
01:31:54,045 --> 01:31:58,101
-Tell me where you are, I'll come 
-Someone has locked me in a car

972
01:31:58,301 --> 01:32:01,800
Don't talk loudly, 
mom will come there, okay

973
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,618
Look Aradhya, tell me what you 
can around you, I'll come there

974
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:12,762
There is a Kali Bhandar shop here, 
an old man is standing in front of it

975
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:14,551
I can't see anything else

976
01:32:14,751 --> 01:32:19,693
Look around Aradhya, give me some clue, 
tell me where you are, I'll come there

977
01:32:19,893 --> 01:32:22,734
Mom, I can hear a devotional 
song being played loudly

978
01:32:22,934 --> 01:32:25,989
Then? See if you can find something else

979
01:32:26,189 --> 01:32:29,167
They have put up lights all over the over

980
01:32:29,367 --> 01:32:32,566
I can see a Kali Devi's statue

981
01:32:32,766 --> 01:32:35,127
Mostly, this is Kalighat road

982
01:32:37,088 --> 01:32:42,431
Mom, battery is low, 
please come soon, I'm getting scared

983
01:32:42,631 --> 01:32:46,485
Aradhya, I'm coming there, 
nothing will happen to you until I'm there

984
01:32:46,685 --> 01:32:50,874
-Be brave okay 
-Please come soon mom

985
01:32:51,074 --> 01:32:52,393
Don't worry dear

986
01:32:53,351 --> 01:32:56,478
Hello, hello

987
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:02,683
Taxi... Taxi...

988
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:10,533
-I want to go to Kalighat bro. 
-Yes madam, please sit

989
01:33:29,301 --> 01:33:32,901
-There is no much time, please drive fast 
-I'm going fast madam

990
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:37,672
The price we fixed is final

991
01:33:37,872 --> 01:33:41,596
You know that there is high demand for 
small girls, why are you bargaining?

992
01:33:41,796 --> 01:33:45,980
Do you have a girl who is 20 years old? 
There is more demand for them

993
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:49,452
Okay, I'll pay be 5000 bucks 
more, leave the girl and go

994
01:33:49,652 --> 01:33:53,002
You think I'm doing scrap business, 
I'm not selling any small thing

-Get lost 
-I wasted my time here

Why are you taking left?

997
01:33:56,709 --> 01:33:59,584
I have to fill diesel madam, 
there is a petrol bunk nearby

998
01:34:01,404 --> 01:34:03,607
-I don't have time for all that 
-It'll take only 5 minutes madam

999

Hey, call Parimala and tell that the 
price we decided in the morning is fixed

1040
01:38:59,669 --> 01:39:01,891
We can't keep the girl in the

Hey, where is my phone? 
You kept it in the car, isn't it?

Hey, it's switched off

surprising if it's switched off, isn't it?

Anyway, we would have throwed the phone 
after our job is done, it doesn't matter

they won't leave the girl here

-Is he coming? 
-Yes

What is he doing with her?

1105
01:47:21,639 --> 01:47:23,807

we'll have to lift him

If that same God would know who you are...

1114
01:48:02,681 --> 01:48:04,965
...she would step up on you 
and kill you right there

1115

What are you saying?

1116
01:48:07,539 --> 01:48:10,190
She is the mom if the 
girl who we have kidnapped

1117
01:48:10,913 --> 01:48:13,726
What? Are you saying the truth?

1118
01:48:13,926 --> 01:48:16,294
Hey! Stop the car! Stop!

1119
01:48:16,494 --> 01:48:19,484
I'm stopping, what happened to you? 
Why are you acting like this?

1120
01:48:19,995 --> 01:48:24,558
I think we did a big mistake 
by kidnapping that girl

1121
01:48:25,488 --> 01:48:26,830
We don't know what happened to Guru

1122
01:48:27,357 --> 01:48:30,595
Mobile got switched off, I'm hurt too

1123
01:48:30,795 --> 01:48:33,015
Ah! Let's leave that girl

1124
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:35,983
Just because she saved your life 
you are showing sympathy on her?

1125
01:48:37,036 --> 01:48:38,222
We have done so many like this

1126
01:48:40,006 --> 01:48:41,419
Money is more important for you, isn't it?

1127
01:48:42,035 --> 01:48:46,264
Decide now, 
you want money or you want me

1128
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:50,542
Why are you doing this? 
You want to talk with her? Call her

1129
01:48:58,361 --> 01:48:59,334
[phone ringing]

1130
01:48:59,938 --> 01:49:02,367
-Hello-Your daughter is with us

1131
01:49:02,567 --> 01:49:04,917
Come to Howrah bridge and take her

1132
01:49:05,702 --> 01:49:11,234
Who are you? Why will my daughter 
be with you? Wrong number

1133
01:49:14,424 --> 01:49:16,994
Hey, she is saying her daughter is at home

1134
01:49:17,194 --> 01:49:20,462
I already told you, she is playing with us

1135
01:49:20,662 --> 01:49:23,990
She is cheating us, 
I'm sure she is the mother of that girl

1136
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:28,871
When you went to buy alcohol, we called 
her and she came out of police station...

1137
01:49:29,071 --> 01:49:30,436
...and we demanded money from her

1138
01:49:30,636 --> 01:49:32,926
If her daughter was at home, 
why did she give us money?

1139
01:49:33,126 --> 01:49:36,080
If you stay like this, you'll lose 
all your blood, let's go to hospital

1140
01:49:55,302 --> 01:49:59,393
The main reason for this 
disease is severe depression

1141
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:02,967
-There is no cure for this? 
-There is no such cure for this

1142
01:50:03,167 --> 01:50:08,772
In the final stages, suddenly 
patient will lose all the memory...

1143
01:50:08,972 --> 01:50:11,211
...and just stand still anywhere

1144
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:13,862
They won't have any sense 
of what is happening around

1145
01:50:20,144 --> 01:50:22,609
-Sis, I'll be coming late tonight 
-Is it?

1146
01:50:23,009 --> 01:50:25,273
-I'll pick up Aradhya myself 
-Okay sis

1147
01:51:13,961 --> 01:51:19,171
I can see Kali Devi statue mom, 
mostly this is Kalighat road

1148
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:32,737
Aradhya, sorry dear, 
you are waiting from a long time?

1149
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:36,095
-You are always late mom 
-Sorry

1150
01:51:36,295 --> 01:51:39,306
I'll buy you ice cream because you 
got selected in the auditions

1151
01:51:41,383 --> 01:51:43,322
Mom, does God do mistakes?

1152
01:51:44,153 --> 01:51:48,290
No dear, God doesn't do any 
mistake, God always does good

1153
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:52,423
But Devi is killing Mahishasura 
here, isn't that wrong?

1154
01:51:52,623 --> 01:51:57,957
When demons come to earth, 
when people are in trouble...

1155
01:51:58,157 --> 01:52:02,905
...Devi comes to earth and punishes them

1156
01:52:03,105 --> 01:52:06,709
-Mom, it's late, let's buy ice cream 
-Yes, let's go

1157
01:52:13,295 --> 01:52:14,377
-Then... 
-Mom, ice cream

1158
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:43,649
[phone ringing]

1159
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:45,963
That lady is calling

1160
01:52:48,774 --> 01:52:52,168
Receive the phone and ask what she wants

1161
01:52:53,521 --> 01:52:54,788
Talk to her

1162
01:52:56,608 --> 01:52:58,040
-Hello 
-Hello sir

1163
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:02,431
You had called that my daughter is 
with you, where should I come sir?

1164
01:53:02,877 --> 01:53:05,203
Hey, you said that your 
daughter is at home

1165
01:53:05,403 --> 01:53:08,343
Now you have called and acting 
that you want your daughter

1166
01:53:08,543 --> 01:53:12,022
I was in tension that time and said 
like that, tell me where I should come

1167
01:53:12,222 --> 01:53:16,426
Come to Writer's Colony 
and take your daughter

1168
01:53:16,626 --> 01:53:17,915
Okay sir

1169
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:21,355
[phone ringing]

1170
01:53:25,024 --> 01:53:26,376
-Hello 
-Hello sir

1171
01:53:26,576 --> 01:53:28,554
Suspects are at Writer's colony sir

1172
01:53:55,114 --> 01:53:57,002
Just call and check if 
she is coming or not

1173
01:53:57,202 --> 01:53:59,569
She will be coming, 
let's wait for 10 minutes

1174
01:54:04,839 --> 01:54:07,435
-She is playing with us 
-Just call and check

1175
01:54:07,727 --> 01:54:08,867
Why aren't you listening to me?

1176
01:54:16,098 --> 01:54:18,870
[phone ringing]

1177
01:54:27,164 --> 01:54:31,189
Damn! She is receiving the phone, 
she is definitely playing with us

1178
01:54:31,389 --> 01:54:32,633
Call again and see

1179
01:54:38,595 --> 01:54:41,000
[phone ringing]

1180
01:54:51,042 --> 01:54:53,258
Listen, if we stay here, 
we'll definitely get caught

1181
01:54:53,458 --> 01:54:55,906
Keep quite, nothing will happen

1182
01:55:00,374 --> 01:55:05,843
In the final stages, suddenly 
patient will lose all the memory...

1183
01:55:06,043 --> 01:55:08,194
...and just stand still anywhere

1184
01:55:08,394 --> 01:55:10,871
They won't have any sense of 
what's happening around them

1185
01:55:12,058 --> 01:55:16,591
In final stage, 
their memory power will be deteriorating

1186
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:20,109
At any moment, 
they might lose their memory power...

1187
01:55:20,309 --> 01:55:22,455
...and they will forget 
themselves completely

1188
01:55:39,677 --> 01:55:40,560
Mom!

1189
01:55:48,055 --> 01:55:49,178
Mom!

1190
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:56,203
-Idiot! I told you 
-Damn!

1191
01:55:57,702 --> 01:55:59,009
-Mom! 
-Hey!

1192
01:56:03,213 --> 01:56:05,355
-Ah! 
-Mom!

1193
01:56:06,931 --> 01:56:09,405
-Come! 
-Leave me! Mom!

1194
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:15,885
-Mom! Leave me! I want to go to my mom! 
-Get in!

1195
01:56:16,234 --> 01:56:17,643
Hey Kiran!

1196
01:56:40,552 --> 01:56:45,374
[music]

1197
01:57:09,254 --> 01:57:14,193
[music continues]

1198
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,314
"We are bad people"

1199
02:00:04,584 --> 02:00:07,113
Walkie Talkie: 
The suspect who was in the taxi is found

1200
02:00:16,761 --> 02:00:17,671
Uncle!

1201
02:00:23,406 --> 02:00:25,302
He is checking and she is making noise

1202
02:00:34,934 --> 02:00:38,399
Uncle! Uncle!

1203
02:00:40,253 --> 02:00:41,778
Hey!

1204
02:00:44,381 --> 02:00:45,186
Hey!

1205
02:01:38,438 --> 02:01:39,478
Hey! Stop!

1206
02:01:41,308 --> 02:01:42,171
Stop!

1207
02:01:44,726 --> 02:01:45,613
Mom!

1208
02:01:48,783 --> 02:01:49,830
[gun shot fired]

1209
02:02:06,764 --> 02:02:11,473
-Aradhya, get up dear 
-Mom

1210
02:02:15,606 --> 02:02:18,609
-Mom 
-Aradhya, hope you aren't hurt

1211
02:02:20,377 --> 02:02:22,952
What happened? Don't get scared, be brave

1212
02:02:23,152 --> 02:02:24,975
Dad, where is mom?

1213
02:02:25,175 --> 02:02:27,842
-Don't worry about mom dear 
-Where is mom?

1214
02:02:28,185 --> 02:02:31,380
I'm there for you here after, 
I take good care of you Aradhya

1215
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:36,126
She can't stay with you here after, I'll 
be there with you and take care of you

1216
02:02:36,939 --> 02:02:40,261
She can't take care of herself, 
how will she take care of you?

1217
02:02:42,332 --> 02:02:45,270
Come with me Aradhya, 
don't worry about her

1218
02:02:48,338 --> 02:02:52,065
-Aradhya, I'll take of you, trust me 
-Aradhya! Aradhya!

1219
02:02:52,265 --> 02:02:56,708
You are safe, God is really great, 
he sent you back to us

1220
02:02:56,908 --> 02:03:01,124
Forget what all happened dear, 
all your troubles will end today

1221
02:03:01,324 --> 02:03:02,673
You come with us Aradhya

1222
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:08,952
We are your parents from today, 
that was your mom's wish too

1223
02:03:09,721 --> 02:03:14,355
For a childless couple like us, Devi 
has given you in the form of Devaki

1224
02:03:14,555 --> 02:03:15,786
Come with us dear

1225
02:03:15,986 --> 02:03:18,185
You don't worry at all, you come with us

1226
02:03:18,385 --> 02:03:20,292
We'll take care of you like 
you are our own daughter

1227
02:03:20,492 --> 02:03:22,720
Please come home, 
what ever you want we'll give you

1228
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,879
Where ever you want to go, 
we'll take you, please come home dear

1229
02:03:25,079 --> 02:03:26,129
Come dear

1230
02:03:26,329 --> 02:03:28,869
Aradhya, I'm your dad, 
you must listen to me dear

1231
02:03:29,069 --> 02:03:32,750
I'll buy you what ever 
you want, come with me

1232
02:03:33,986 --> 02:03:37,956
Your new mom and brother will take 
care of you, come with me Aradhya

1233
02:03:40,926 --> 02:03:43,200
-Aradhya 
-You're not understanding what I said?

1234
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:46,612
-Please stop 
-Listen to me Aradhya

1235
02:03:46,812 --> 02:03:48,904
-Just come with me, you understood? 
-What should she understand?

1236
02:03:49,104 --> 02:03:52,546
If you would have taken care of them, 
they wouldn't be in this state today

1237
02:03:52,746 --> 02:03:54,473
Please keep quite

1238
02:03:54,673 --> 02:03:58,877
Aradhya, listen to me, come with us, 
we'll take care of you

1239
02:03:59,077 --> 02:04:01,037
You are really close to my heart dear

1240
02:04:01,237 --> 02:04:03,725
Don't worry about mom, 
I'll join her in any shelter

1241
02:04:08,494 --> 02:04:12,214
When ever I asked about you, 
mom used to cook up some story

1242
02:04:12,414 --> 02:04:16,818
She used to say dad has gone 
out, he'll come in few days

1243
02:04:17,018 --> 02:04:20,096
I never understood why 
you didn't come back then

1244
02:04:20,296 --> 02:04:22,067
I don't understand why you have come now

1245
02:04:23,238 --> 02:04:27,273
You never lived with us, you only 
lived in the stories that mom said

1246
02:04:28,244 --> 02:04:31,441
You made mom believe 
that you'll stay with her

1247
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:35,571
Now you are trying to make me believe 
that some one else will take care of mom

1248
02:04:36,073 --> 02:04:40,791
From the time I came to this world, 
all I had was my mom, she is my world

1249
02:04:44,014 --> 02:04:48,995
There won't be any difference between 
you and me, if I leave her now in trouble

1250
02:04:49,517 --> 02:04:51,828
No one is required to take care of her

1251
02:04:52,028 --> 02:04:53,765
I'm there for her always

1252
02:04:53,965 --> 02:04:56,857
You don't want mom, I don't want you

1253
02:04:57,057 --> 02:04:58,654
Not only you, I don't want anyone

1254
02:04:58,854 --> 02:05:00,619
-Aradhya, dear! 
-Aradhya!

1255
02:05:00,819 --> 02:05:02,431
Mom!

1256
02:05:04,011 --> 02:05:05,026
Mom!

1257
02:05:08,081 --> 02:05:10,626
Mom, why are you standing here?

1258
02:05:11,272 --> 02:05:13,066
Something is wrong with you it seems

1259
02:05:13,266 --> 02:05:14,913
You won't stay with me here after mom?

1260
02:05:16,337 --> 02:05:18,444
They will take me with them it seems

1261
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:24,486
Why you should take care of 
me mom? I'll take care of you

1262
02:05:24,686 --> 02:05:27,005
All these days there was no one with us

1263
02:05:27,205 --> 02:05:29,487
Let us be happy like this forever

1264
02:05:34,452 --> 02:05:39,568
I won't leave you and go 
anywhere, I love you so much!

1265
02:05:52,029 --> 02:05:57,158
'Mom, is the word that is 
first said by the child'

1266
02:05:57,358 --> 02:06:00,265
'Our life begun in her womb'

1267
02:06:00,465 --> 02:06:04,178
'We cry when we are born, 
but mom smiles when she hears that cry'

1268
02:06:04,572 --> 02:06:07,621
'She blesses that we keep 
smiling through out our life'

1269
02:06:07,821 --> 02:06:10,259
'A beautiful bond like this'

1270
02:06:10,459 --> 02:06:11,750
'Affection that never ends'

1271
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:15,053
'Mom is a beautiful memory that 
we can never forget'

1272
02:06:15,253 --> 02:06:19,703
'Lord Yama who takes our 
life cannot separate us...

1273
02:06:19,903 --> 02:06:23,384
...from this beautiful bond and memories'
