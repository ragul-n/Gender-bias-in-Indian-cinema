00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:20,671
Greetings! Saheb...

2
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:27,437
aren't they your men?

3
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,678
Do you suspect anyone?

4
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:53,531
I shouldn't say this...

5
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,867
but it's the second time this month.

6
00:03:57,913 --> 00:03:59,505
This can't go on.

7
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,245
I know, your the only one left.

8
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,877
We'll make our move
when the time is right.

9
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,185
Saheb, Jaiswal had called.

10
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:12,584
He wants something done.

11
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,187
What should I say?

12
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:15,490
Nothing.

13
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:18,899
The time isn't right.

14
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:26,999
Can't find the words
to narrate this tale

15
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:38,117
Yet a tale so true
how can it be kept away

16
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,547
Round and round goes the maze

17
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,818
Spells and witchcraft abound

18
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,385
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins

19
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,932
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns

20
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,361
Spells and witchcraft abound

21
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:57,927
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins

22
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,965
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns

23
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:05,412
Hello Minister sir.

24
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,140
All okay, Gainda Singh?

25
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:10,013
Thanks to your grace.
- Come...

26
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:19,858
I will gladly bear a
million enemies...

27
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,495
but I can't take an insult.

28
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,292
Kanhaiya...

29
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,263
you said Jaiswal had called...

30
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:31,764
ask him to come over.

31
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,968
Saheb, there are
two mines in my area.

32
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:37,369
One belongs to me...

33
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,174
while Khetar Pal owns the other.

34
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:41,181
But... I have a friend, Shyam Bohra.

35
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:42,614
He wants to set up a mine.

36
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:44,049
And he is loaded.

37
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,246
If he gets into mining...

38
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,879
I will be wiped out.

39
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:51,016
Are you asking me to...

40
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,684
If he gets killed...

41
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:54,558
I'll be the prime suspect.

42
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,927
But why? What about the guy
who owns the other mine...

43
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:58,156
Khetar Pal?

44
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,756
It's also possible he
could've carried out the deed.

45
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:02,234
When two people are
suspected of a crime...

46
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,737
the toss of a coin is
enough to weed out the culprit.

47
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,065
Does anyone know that you are here?

48
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,207
Gainda Singh?
- Of course not, Saheb.

49
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:14,372
Meet Gainda Singh...

50
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,544
and ask for his help.

51
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,456
Once that's done, tell your friend...

52
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:28,018
that his life is in danger.

53
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,920
Inform the cops too.
- Sir, how do you know that...

54
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:31,464
he could be attacked?

55
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,161
Well you see... due to my business,
I meet a lot of people.

56
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,100
I heard that
something is about to happen.

57
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,729
All you have to do
is provide security.

58
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,569
I advised him not to
get into this business.

59
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,233
Did I not tell you? Tell.

60
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,938
Now, when Gainda Singh's
goon goes to kill your friend...

61
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,412
which you will know...

62
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,973
the cops will arrest him.

63
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,615
And you will no longer be a suspect.

64
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:53,481
After a few days have passed...

65
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:54,714
I'II...

66
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:57,949
kill your friend.

67
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,489
By the way...

68
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:04,990
don't refer to the person
you want dead as your friend.

69
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:06,284
Now there's nothing to fear.

70
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,589
I never feared anything, Jaiswal.

71
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,324
Just relax.
- To hell with relax!

72
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,295
I will show Khetar Pal
what I'm capable of!

73
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,890
You will do no such thing.

74
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,469
Just let it go!
- Let go of what?

75
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,663
You don't have a chauffeur...

76
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:17,864
how will you drive back?

77
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,271
I'll drive the car myself.
- Of course, you are James Bond!

78
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,016
Excuse me, please...

79
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,414
side...

80
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:54,935
Come.

81
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,575
Wave goodbye to the room.

82
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:57,770
Bye!

83
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,443
Come on... Let's go.
- Yes.

84
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,848
This place is quite far from home.

85
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:05,715
Fine, next week I'll rent
a room somewhere else...

86
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:08,413
Oh shut up!

87
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,233
Get out!

88
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:21,859
Hey! Let him go!

89
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:23,964
What has he done? Let him go!

90
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,129
Have you lost it, Babloo?

91
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,503
Let him go!

92
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,143
I'll beat the shit out of him...

93
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,406
and check what he
has that I don't have!

94
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,246
Why don't you ask me? I'll
tell you what you don't have!

95
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,945
What? - You don't have class.
You are a brute!

96
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,785
You called me a brute?

97
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:47,520
I even learnt... English for you.

98
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,495
The things I've done to please you.

99
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:50,895
Like what?

100
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,490
I... I learnt to play
the guitar for you...

101
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:55,763
Guitar?

102
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,798
When you hold the guitar it's like...

103
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,169
a monkey wearing a tuxedo!

104
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,936
Now let him go!

105
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:23,796
Greetings Saheb...

106
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:25,365
Greetings Jaiswal...

107
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:27,660
breakfast?

108
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,901
Actually it's time for lunch.

109
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,335
The English are responsible
for ruining my family's habits.

110
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,434
How so?
- It's their clock on the wall...

111
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:38,678
and over in England
it must morning now.

112
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:41,006
Of course. It must be.

113
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,793
Let me go! I need to talk to Saheb.

114
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,871
Where is he... let me go!

115
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,838
I...

116
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:15,575
I...

117
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:19,009
need to speak with you.

118
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,853
Why don't you take a
walk and come back later?

119
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:22,480
We'll speak then.

120
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:27,317
Who is this? You
haven't introduced us.

121
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,856
He is... Mr. Jaiswal, from Lucknow.

122
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:31,057
Oh!

123
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,195
How do you do, madam?
- Very well.

124
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,600
What brings you here?

125
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:37,796
Thought I'd pay Saheb a visit.

126
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,997
I see...

127
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:40,574
so, you're from Lucknow?
- Yes, madam.

128
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,666
Lucknow is a beautiful city.
- It really is beautiful.

129
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:43,869
How many kids do you have?

130
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:45,809
I have two little kids.
- Really?

131
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,144
What does your wife do?
- Um... she's a fashion designer.

132
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,149
I'm sure she makes
some amazing designs.

133
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,809
Yes and I'll get something
for you, next time I visit.

134
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:54,013
Oh, thank you. What
are your kids' names?

135
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,750
Well... one is Sonu and the
other Monu. - How wonderful!

136
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,382
Ma'am, the car is waiting.
- I'm having a conversation...

137
00:11:58,493 --> 00:11:59,892
leave my hand.

138
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:01,889
Tell me something about yourself.
- Ma'am, the car...

139
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:06,124
I said, I am having a conversation.

140
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:09,297
So tell me...

141
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:14,768
why don't you get your wife
along some day? - Of course.

142
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:17,242
We'll have a great time. Come on,
it's time for your sight seeing.

143
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:18,604
Let's go.

144
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,377
Do you have all the bills?

145
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,256
And the cheque book?
- That too.

146
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:32,622
Good. You seem to
have become organized.

147
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,752
Sunder... take Madam for
a ride around Devgadh.

148
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:43,397
Do look after her... she
hasn't been keeping well.

149
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,438
You are my health, Saheb.

150
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,098
You look after yourself.

151
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:00,051
Hello...

152
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,046
Greetings sir...

153
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,884
Where is he... your Casanova?

154
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,483
Babloo, just go away.

155
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:13,325
Greetings sir.

156
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:18,932
So it's you!

157
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:22,803
You think you're a hero?

158
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:26,474
Why did you bet the hell out of him?

159
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,776
He's in a coma now.

160
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:32,445
If his coma ends in a full stop...

161
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:34,277
your strength and energy...

162
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:36,916
will be spent baking bread in jail.

163
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:38,748
That's why he was here.

164
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,651
I hope the police case is sorted.

165
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:43,725
I gave an entrance
exam for a bank this year.

166
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,127
If you could...

167
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:54,305
Hey! Everyone out!

168
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,775
Move to the side,
I need to have a meeting.

169
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:08,445
Listen to me,
this isn't some social service.

170
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,718
Yes sir.

171
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,716
What will you do for me?

172
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:19,164
Once the bank hires me...

173
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,391
you can apply for any
amount of loan hat you want...

174
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:22,730
and I will get it cleared.

175
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,348
That's a good joke.

176
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:38,778
Now get out of the way. Move it...

177
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:41,287
Sir... I'm sorry. Sorry sir...

178
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:43,220
Just say the word...

179
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,150
and it'll be done!

180
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,557
I swear.

181
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,803
Your uncle works for the
King of Devgadh, right?

182
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:58,804
Yes, as a chauffeur.

183
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,232
Okay.

184
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:43,312
Are you blind, you idiot?

185
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,533
Where's my wounded soldier?

186
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:08,498
Greetings, Saheb.
- Hello.

187
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,544
Now, you are tied to this
bed for a good month or two.

188
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,010
I'll rest for a few days.

189
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:14,308
I must say... Kanhaiya,
don't you think Madam...

190
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,413
demonstrated a good presence of mind.

191
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:21,787
Now even she will have
to stay within the palace.

192
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:23,417
Oh no, Saheb.

193
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:26,051
I've asked my nephew
in Lucknow to come here.

194
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:27,651
He is good at driving.

195
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,252
He is someone you can trust.

196
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:32,957
Kanhaiya will figure
if he is trustworthy.

197
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,058
As for the driving...

198
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:36,797
Madam will judge that.

199
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,637
I will avenge whoever
has done this to you.

200
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:46,879
Very soon.

201
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,254
Excuse me...

202
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,524
Whom are you looking for?

203
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:39,292
Sundarji?

204
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:40,959
Who are you?

205
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:42,365
He is my uncle.

206
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,700
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- What?!

207
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,165
Oh... what?

208
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,366
Bloody English!

209
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,239
Your uncle brought you up but
did you ever inquire about him...

210
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,278
how he is, his health...

211
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,575
whether he is even alive... did you?

212
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,041
That's precisely why I am here.
- What's that supposed to mean?

213
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,608
He lost his job yesterday.

214
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,586
Now if his living quarters are
taken away, where will he go?

215
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:03,214
Tell me!

216
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,088
Please do me a favor
and take me to his room.

217
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:12,459
Follow me.

218
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:18,129
What? Struck by lightning, are you?

219
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,167
You think...

220
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:22,799
only girls in the city know English?

221
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,702
Even I know English.

222
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:26,377
Come on.

223
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,247
Sundarji...

224
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,914
here is your good-for-nothing nephew.

225
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,618
Oh yes...
- Uncle, what happened to you?

226
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:41,422
Babloo, you are here!

227
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:44,728
Do you eat meat? Baa
- baa-Ioo...

228
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,828
I look after Sundarji's food.

229
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:48,095
It's chicken curry today.

230
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,864
But, if you are one of those
leafy vegetarian types, tell me...

231
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:51,268
I'll call for something
to be delivered for you.

232
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,737
And make it quick, I don't have time.

233
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,638
Will you at least
let him say something?

234
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:57,074
I haven't censored his speech.

235
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,475
He can say anything he wants to!

236
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:01,378
He will have it. He likes chicken.

237
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:04,009
Just because you like it, I
hope you won't demand it everyday!

238
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:05,710
Baa-ba-Ioo... See you.

239
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,348
Suman's tongue is
like a Formula 1 car!

240
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:12,688
But she is very sweet.

241
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,927
I still can't imagine that
she is Kanhaiya's daughter.

242
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,224
Kanhaiya?
- Saheb's man shadow.

243
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:19,731
Once upon...

244
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,529
a time there were many.

245
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:24,161
But one by one they all vanished.

246
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,639
Somehow I am still around.

247
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:28,402
But who is behind it?

248
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,841
Saheb is well respected in this area.

249
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:34,737
So why would anyone
have a problem with that?

250
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:36,942
Who told you that
anyone has a problem?

251
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,575
Never mind, I don't want
anything to do with it.

252
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:40,176
Tell me more, It's
an interesting story.

253
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:42,279
Things work differently over here.

254
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:45,724
Saheb has respect and
status but he is broke.

255
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,291
What about daily expenses?

256
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:49,622
The Queen.

257
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,859
Saheb's step mother.

258
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:55,126
The King bequeathed
everything to her.

259
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:56,931
Greetings...

260
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:58,767
your Highness.

261
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,170
When will you say,
'greetings mother'?

262
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:03,874
I'm here to ask...

263
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:05,411
for the land deed to the red mansion.

264
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,071
So that you can sell it off?

265
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:08,773
What's left to sell?

266
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:11,909
Everything belongs to you.

267
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,154
But you want me to come...

268
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,089
before you... and beg.

269
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:24,193
So here... I'm begging.

270
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,568
I want respect, my dear.

271
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,297
Respect.

272
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:31,531
Respect.

273
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,936
Your father knew how
to accord respect.

274
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:39,446
He took a courtesan for his
wife and gave her respect.

275
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,809
What have you done?

276
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:49,518
Your first wife took her own life...

277
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,087
while the second one
has lost her mind.

278
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:54,452
Please! Tell me what have you
thought about the red mansion?

279
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:05,462
For now, take this.

280
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,131
After all...

281
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:10,837
I can't send his son
back empty handed.

282
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:18,476
Greetings.

283
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,180
Listen!

284
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,552
What?

285
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,720
What? What is it?

286
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:31,854
Stop seeking pleasure outside...

287
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,791
pay attention to the one you have.

288
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:36,030
It won't be nice...

289
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:38,898
if you repeat the mistake...

290
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,839
your father did.

291
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:54,010
What is Shikaar Baadi?

292
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:56,085
Shikaar Baadi is a place.

293
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,725
The one who lives in... is something.

294
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:09,099
The night, it taunts me

295
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:33,685
The night, it taunts me

296
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:35,956
With all its stars as bright can be

297
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,361
There's no one as Ionely as me

298
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:42,925
The taunts burn me up whole

299
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:47,597
If you stay, I'll surrender my soul

300
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:53,271
The night, it taunts me

301
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:04,047
Tell me what

302
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:13,427
Tell me what you want to hear

303
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:17,934
Tell me what I want to hear

304
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:25,436
It's time to grasp
the mischievous night

305
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:29,276
It's time to grasp the playful words

306
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:34,213
It loves to leave me
hanging by a thread

307
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:38,918
Let's do something
that this night never ends

308
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:45,791
The night, it taunts me

309
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,230
With all its stars as bright can be

310
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:51,702
There's no one as Ionely as me

311
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:04,608
Tell me what

312
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:13,684
Tell me what you want to hear

313
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:18,528
Tell me what I want to hear

314
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:21,296
Tell me what

315
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:25,737
Time you learnt the truth about love

316
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:29,807
Time you caught the
laughter in my breath

317
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,704
The night brings out my true desire

318
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:39,980
Let's do something that
sets our hearts on fire

319
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:46,421
The night, it taunts me

320
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:48,723
With all its stars as bright can be

321
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:51,060
There's no one as Ionely as me

322
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:55,693
Tell the night its
pride I don't want to see

323
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:00,229
Tomorrow it should bow down before me

324
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,604
The night, it taunts me

325
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:07,703
The night, it taunts me

326
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,318
Saheb...

327
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:25,025
Saheb...

328
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:26,492
Yes?

329
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,057
It's morning...

330
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:33,102
time to wake up.

331
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,265
You can tell the morning...

332
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,601
that Saheb has ordered it to go away.

333
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,010
Nature doesn't bend according
to your whims, the way I do.

334
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,075
Mahua, one day you shall see...

335
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,887
that nature has bent to my whims.

336
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:55,119
And when will you fulfill my request?

337
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,261
Last week...

338
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:02,029
I had asked for 20,000 rupees.

339
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:04,827
I shall send it.

340
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,202
If I have your permission...

341
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:12,337
I'll get it done myself.

342
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,347
Don't forget what you are!

343
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,182
I will have...

344
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,123
Kanhaiya bring it.

345
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:35,930
That would be nice.

346
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:38,533
Take care, Saheb.

347
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:47,807
Enough.

348
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:36,919
Saheb...

349
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:39,029
Be careful.

350
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,038
I hope you've understood.
- Yes, of course.

351
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:50,268
What I mean is how to address whom.

352
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,742
I understood it all.

353
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:54,337
It was more like a Chemistry
exam than a briefing of the palace.

354
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:02,280
Sundarji, your nephew is a coward.

355
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,152
He won't survive in here.

356
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:07,355
Listen!
- Tell me, Baa-baa-Ioo.

357
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,453
Is everyone crazy around here.

358
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,689
You will go crazy too.

359
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,128
Driving Madam around...

360
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,995
is like balancing on
the edge of a sword.

361
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,292
But don't you worry...

362
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,098
I've put in a good word for you.

363
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,899
Alright... thank you.

364
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:21,566
And just because I'm nice
to you and talk to you...

365
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,235
don't assume that I
am flirting with you.

366
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:25,805
Hope you got that...

367
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,106
Babloo!

368
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,610
Babloo!

369
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,015
I want a good rifle...

370
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,283
something like a 315.

371
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,018
This is what you should have.

372
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,389
It's a double barrel.

373
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,485
It's the finest English make.

374
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,253
This is used for prey that's nearby.

375
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,433
My foes are hiding at a distance.

376
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,168
These days, it's hard to come by...

377
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,261
a brave enemy who
strikes from up close.

378
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,772
What did you say your name is?
- Umm... Ghosh...

379
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:56,570
Not you! You...

380
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:59,141
what's your name?
- Babloo.

381
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,640
Babloo.

382
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,244
I want you to stay true to your name.

383
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:07,344
Have you told him about Madam?

384
00:29:07,888 --> 00:29:09,082
Yes.

385
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:11,214
Okay. This is...

386
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,054
Saheb... you see...
this is... I mean...

387
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,692
it's for 250,000 rupees. - How much...

388
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,660
It's expensive.
- Do the bullets cost?

389
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,457
250 rupees each.

390
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:20,796
I feel the bullets should cost more.

391
00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:22,534
The bullet is
responsible for the kill.

392
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:24,936
What do you say, Babloo?

393
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,531
Yes.

394
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,164
You get 100 free with the rifle.

395
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:30,499
Madam often falls ill.

396
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:31,771
You will need to drive her around.

397
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:34,541
Saheb, you won't have...
a reason to complain.

398
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,241
You won't find me complaining.

399
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,283
I've already warned you.

400
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,010
If you do make a mistake...

401
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,078
it will cost a mere 250
rupees to attain martyrdom.

402
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:46,653
Introduce him to Madam.

403
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:48,886
Thank you, Saheb.

404
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,722
Fine, I am keeping this.
- Okay.

405
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,231
You will be paid later.

406
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:54,593
Oh please... don't embarrass me.

407
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,864
Saheb...
- Yes?

408
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,800
I haven't received the
previous payment yet.

409
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:01,430
I would be grateful,
if I could get that.

410
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:03,400
Suman?
- Yes, father?

411
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,804
Take him along...

412
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,276
and introduce him to Madam.

413
00:30:09,382 --> 00:30:10,440
Yes.

414
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,046
Sorry...

415
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,419
sorry...

416
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,150
sorry...

417
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:38,069
Inform Madam that
the new driver is here.

418
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:44,215
Don't look up at Madam.

419
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:46,247
Why don't I pull out my
eyes and give them to you.

420
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,445
Keep them with you.

421
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:55,287
All the best...

422
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:56,488
Baa-baa-Ioo.

423
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:10,771
Sit.

424
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,242
Vegetarian or non-vegetarian?

425
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,287
Well, it depends.

426
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:26,021
What?

427
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,652
Well... whatever is
available I have it.

428
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:40,967
What is it?

429
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:50,941
Sit.

430
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:55,451
Rukma!

431
00:31:57,324 --> 00:31:59,258
That means you cannot be trusted.

432
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:00,554
What?

433
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,854
You just said...

434
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:03,828
that you are opportunistic.

435
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:06,498
For once, you could place
your trust in me and try.

436
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,357
Once. I'll trust you...

437
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,698
but just once.

438
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,677
Eat.

439
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:35,189
Don't know how to use it?

440
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,531
Well... the Lord has
blessed me with hands.

441
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:39,860
No.

442
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,059
Not with your hand.

443
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:46,236
Anything you do, do it with class.

444
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,070
Uncivilized behavior is
accepted as long as it's classy.

445
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,272
Hmm...

446
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:54,379
Sundar told me your name is Babloo.

447
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,410
Really, that's your name?

448
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:59,048
It's my nickname.

449
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,716
What's your real name?

450
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:02,481
It's Lalit.

451
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:08,051
Get out... get lost.

452
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:10,696
Get out of here. Throw him out.

453
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:11,958
I'll shoot him...

454
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:13,862
throw him out!
- What... what happened?

455
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:16,766
Was it something I said?
What did I do?

456
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:35,481
She asked for my name...
and I replied.

457
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,920
Next thing I know, she
flung the plate at me.

458
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,547
I think she is crazy.

459
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:42,326
You think it's funny?

460
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,962
This is your 'welcome
to the mansion' bandage.

461
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:46,663
With a name like Babloo...

462
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,329
you are sure to get hit.

463
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,766
I said my name is Lalit.

464
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:51,195
You should've told the real one.

465
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:52,601
This is my real name.

466
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,303
Fine!

467
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,637
Tell me...

468
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:01,772
did the plate flung at
you fill your appetite...

469
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:02,940
or you want to have a real lunch?

470
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:04,643
I'm not hungry. Get lost!

471
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,210
Now what?
- Get lost.

472
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:09,380
Get lost.

473
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:10,616
Fine.

474
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,252
Everybody's crazy! Everybody!

475
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,190
It's you who are crazy, you idiot!

476
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:17,519
I made a mistake by calling you here.

477
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,331
You rascal! I've been
working here for 25 years.

478
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,458
Not once has anyone reprimanded me.

479
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:38,041
Who switched the light on?

480
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:42,115
Who is it?

481
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,652
I asked who is it?

482
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:56,361
What?

483
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,833
What is it?

484
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:03,039
Get out of here. Get out...

485
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,542
Get lost...

486
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,804
So Babloo... tell me.

487
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,203
Sir...

488
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:36,002
things are weird over here.

489
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:38,001
Everybody's crazy.

490
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:40,875
I don't think we need to kill them,
They're already as good as dead.

491
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:43,241
Babloo my dear...

492
00:35:43,316 --> 00:35:45,284
even a dead elephant
is worth quite a lot.

493
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:47,280
The day Saheb dies...

494
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:50,355
now that will be a red letter day!
A day to remember.

495
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,554
We should send
Sundar's nephew back, Saheb.

496
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:56,653
Why... what for?

497
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,462
Madam didn't take to his name.

498
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,464
Babloo?

499
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:04,726
It's Lalit.

500
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,307
She flew into a rage
when she heard it.

501
00:36:09,976 --> 00:36:12,137
Had I heard, even I
would've been enraged.

502
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:14,973
It's alright.

503
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:17,373
It's not the poor guy's fault.

504
00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:20,346
You don't get it, Babloo.

505
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,411
These so called Kings...

506
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:27,120
come preloaded with whores
for as long as they live!

507
00:36:27,694 --> 00:36:30,162
Well, at least the
bastard doesn't have a child.

508
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,260
What's that screaming sound?

509
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:36,196
A bloody pig!

510
00:36:36,302 --> 00:36:37,792
Pig!

511
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,396
They have a long
life and they are loud!

512
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:45,642
Your Saheb will continue to
make noise even after he's gone.

513
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,741
Keep an eye on him.

514
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:49,179
As you say, sir.

515
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:51,445
What's for dinner?

516
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:53,315
Sir, a rooster!

517
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,945
Well you should try
a hen for a change!

518
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,154
Hey! Babloo!

519
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,395
You're still asleep? Time to wake up!

520
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,261
Why?
- I need to measure your neck.

521
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,598
My neck?
- Yes.

522
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:09,164
You're to be hung at the gallows.

523
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,430
Hung?
- Yes.

524
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:13,331
Who told you?
- My dad.

525
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,667
He's called for you.

526
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:15,932
If you ask me, his mood suggests...

527
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,533
that he'll chop your head off!

528
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,105
But I argued...

529
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:20,304
that you should be hanged.

530
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,439
It won't hurt that bad... okay?

531
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:24,046
But what have I done?

532
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,551
Everybody's crazy!

533
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:29,887
And don't you dare call
me crazy in his presence.

534
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,081
He dotes on me.

535
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,782
And he has 15 cases of
manslaughter against him.

536
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,528
Sit.

537
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:47,704
I'm fine, sir.

538
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:49,332
Sit!

539
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:58,711
Why are you here?
- Sorry?

540
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,376
What's your intention of coming here?

541
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,145
I thought I'd drive in
place of uncle for a few days.

542
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,684
As the chauffeur.

543
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:09,660
Well then you better stop
doing the night watch, get it?

544
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:11,393
Sir...

545
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:15,059
it's a new place so...
couldn't sleep...

546
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:16,561
Pick a card.

547
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:19,565
Any card.

548
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:26,005
Take a good look.

549
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:36,217
All of us...

550
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:41,689
are slaves to Saheb.

551
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:43,456
Remember that.

552
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,863
Place the card back.

553
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:58,337
If something untoward happens...

554
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:02,840
you will disappear
just like this card...

555
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,346
and you won't even feel a thing.

556
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,386
Yes, sir.

557
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,027
I might not come at night.

558
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:26,366
Okay.

559
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:33,044
First day working for Madam.

560
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:34,340
So?

561
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:36,478
It could very well be the last.

562
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:39,243
What do you mean?

563
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,357
You wanted to see me?

564
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,297
I'm going to the temple.

565
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,924
Place your hand on the offering.

566
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,404
I suggest you take Chhotu
and Mangal along with you.

567
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:00,904
I have a weapon.

568
00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:04,209
And I know how to use it.

569
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,376
I didn't get contract for
the jungle road this time.

570
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,681
So I need to go to the
city for a few days.

571
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,014
Can I get you something?

572
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:17,022
You could try
bringing my nights back.

573
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:23,756
The nights were always yours.

574
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:26,931
But you offered them
to someone else...

575
00:40:28,367 --> 00:40:29,629
remember?

576
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,370
Go away. Please just go away.

577
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,165
Rukma...

578
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:09,138
get the new chauffeur.

579
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,802
Rukma!

580
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,827
Rukma... wait here.

581
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:16,972
When your prayers are answered...

582
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:18,943
it is customary to offer
a sacrifice over here.

583
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,474
What did you ask for?

584
00:42:21,714 --> 00:42:23,079
Why should I tell you?

585
00:42:34,961 --> 00:42:36,724
If I ask you for something...

586
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:39,897
can you give it?

587
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:44,935
I will give... anything you ask for.

588
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:47,303
Can you give up your life?

589
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:54,573
I can also take one!

590
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:55,909
It's easy to take a life.

591
00:42:56,816 --> 00:42:58,078
You can ask Saheb...

592
00:42:58,351 --> 00:42:59,613
or Kanhaiya.

593
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,043
But to give it up...

594
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:03,883
I'd gladly give it up.

595
00:43:06,325 --> 00:43:07,451
For you.

596
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:13,859
Then go ahead.

597
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:16,896
You said...

598
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:18,797
you'd do it for me.

599
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:32,444
The pistol betrayed me, Madam.

600
00:43:36,122 --> 00:43:37,316
If you wish...

601
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,421
I'll leap from here.

602
00:43:42,962 --> 00:43:44,486
I'll tell you...

603
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:47,195
when needed.

604
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:50,929
First day working for Madam.

605
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,400
So?

606
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:54,972
It could very well be the last.

607
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,072
What do you mean?

608
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,168
If Madam asks for your
life as a sacrifice...

609
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,907
don't be afraid.

610
00:44:01,614 --> 00:44:02,979
That's how she tests...

611
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:04,539
for loyalty.

612
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,616
I'm not worried about the elections.

613
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,387
It's a little bit of my money...

614
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,950
and the party gives the rest.

615
00:44:16,062 --> 00:44:18,553
But for my daughter's wedding,
all of it will be mine.

616
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:19,892
I can't afford any risk.

617
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:21,991
It's a three bedroom
apartment in Delhi, Saheb.

618
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:23,398
Lower your hands...

619
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:24,799
I said lower them.

620
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:28,164
So for a contract worth 80 million...

621
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:30,640
all I get is 15 million?

622
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:33,411
I still have to build the road.

623
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,707
A road through the jungle?

624
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:36,873
People in the city don't
have roads to walk on...

625
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:39,213
and you want to
build a road for animals!

626
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,549
Don't teach me politics,
Gainda Singh.

627
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,850
Yes? - Sir, Mr. Aditya
Pratap Singh is here to see you.

628
00:44:50,196 --> 00:44:52,187
Saheb is here from Devgadh.

629
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,134
Please... please ask him to wait.

630
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:57,999
Sir, I did...

631
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:00,536
Minister...

632
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,508
there was a time when you'd hear
the car and run out to greet me.

633
00:45:04,143 --> 00:45:05,906
Is something wrong with your ears
now or is there a change of heart?

634
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:08,139
Your highness, surely
you don't mean that.

635
00:45:08,214 --> 00:45:09,977
I was trying to get some
matters out of the way.

636
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:12,574
Thought we could have a
long uninterrupted chat.

637
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:14,346
I'm not here for a long chat.

638
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,512
I want to give you a
piece of my mind...

639
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:16,918
It won't take long. I'm coming in.

640
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:19,817
He is coming in!

641
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:22,656
I'm not afraid of him.

642
00:45:22,728 --> 00:45:24,161
Don't be stupid!

643
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,527
I think both of you
should hide in the bathroom.

644
00:45:26,632 --> 00:45:27,758
I don't want to go to the bathroom,

645
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:29,664
Why should I...
he doesn't scare me!

646
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:31,464
I will revoke your contract.

647
00:45:31,537 --> 00:45:33,402
Will you stop quarrelling?
- But why go to the bathroom?

648
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:34,564
Now!

649
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,801
Let us go to the kitchen,
why should I go to the bathroom?

650
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:38,068
Come with me!

651
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:39,940
It's very comfortable.

652
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:41,604
It's not comfortable.

653
00:45:43,516 --> 00:45:45,006
Prabhu Tiwari...

654
00:45:45,651 --> 00:45:48,051
I think I may need
to change your name.

655
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:50,446
You think you are the Lord?

656
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:52,491
Saheb, the servants are around.

657
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:53,957
He knows everything.

658
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,652
He writes all my speeches.

659
00:45:55,728 --> 00:45:57,286
Saheb, I beg of you.

660
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:58,927
Please, sir.

661
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:01,330
Kanhaiya, the minister is begging.

662
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:03,234
Take it easy.

663
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,798
You promised... you told me that...

664
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:13,241
I would get the contract this time.

665
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,475
I was on a tour in Thailand.
Bangkok.

666
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:19,346
Sir, there has been some
deal at the clerical level.

667
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:23,115
Anyway, the contract for the
Lakhimpur Bridge is still open.

668
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:25,520
It's a railroad bridge. - Who is
this Kapoor who got the contract?

669
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:29,451
I heard Gainda
Singh is responsible.

670
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:32,156
Kapoor? I have no idea, Saheb.

671
00:46:32,932 --> 00:46:34,991
And Gainda Singh
doesn't have the contacts

672
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:37,126
to get things done at the ministry.

673
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,164
Yes... put him on.

674
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:42,273
Saheb...

675
00:46:42,374 --> 00:46:44,535
it's the chief minister.
I have to take this.

676
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:46,872
Convey my regards.

677
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,206
Jai Hind, sir.
Just say the word, sir.

678
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:55,519
The tour was good... in fact, great!

679
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,483
No, sir, nothing much.

680
00:46:59,558 --> 00:47:02,026
No, sir... but...

681
00:47:02,228 --> 00:47:04,628
sorry, sir...
everything is allowed in Thailand.

682
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,060
Don't seem like a crime over there.

683
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:10,425
There is no feeling of
cheating at all, sir.

684
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,227
I... I...

685
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:14,499
I... I... will... meet you at home.

686
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:17,400
Saheb...

687
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,705
Saheb!
- I need to use the bathroom.

688
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:22,671
Who... who said that, sir?

689
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:25,477
Sir... sir, I
will handle the media.

690
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:28,280
I'll feed them some other
interesting story, sir.

691
00:47:32,024 --> 00:47:33,218
I told you!

692
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:34,657
I will manage the situation, sir.

693
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,059
The Thailand fiasco will
definitely die down...

694
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:39,097
but I saw the
highlights in the bathroom.

695
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:41,395
Bathroom? What did you see in there?
- We were merely standing.

696
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,259
Gainda Singh...

697
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:45,769
I know you aspire to be a Nawab.

698
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:48,035
But I suggest you don't
continue with your interests.

699
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:51,370
But it does have a ring to it...

700
00:47:52,678 --> 00:47:53,838
'Arsehole Gainda! '

701
00:47:53,946 --> 00:47:56,039
Watch what you say, Aditya Singhji.

702
00:47:56,115 --> 00:47:58,481
I feel your royalty has
left you high and dry.

703
00:47:58,684 --> 00:48:00,618
Your vocabulary has a
strange streetwise ring to it.

704
00:48:00,686 --> 00:48:02,551
In the past kings would
fight with other kings.

705
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:04,847
It would be a fair and open fight.

706
00:48:05,024 --> 00:48:06,889
But when street crawlers
feel they stand a chance...

707
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:08,459
it's only right to come
down to their standard.

708
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:10,586
The ones you think
as street crawlers...

709
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:13,497
will soon be dancing on you head!

710
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:16,495
Enjoying dance performances
has been a family tradition.

711
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:19,704
And it's people like you who
have danced for our pleasure.

712
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,301
Why don't you check with
the elders in your family.

713
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:24,804
I am sure quite a few
still know the steps.

714
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,104
You better...
- Sir... what are you...

715
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:27,577
this is my office, sir.

716
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:31,673
My father shot your grandfather
from this long a distance.

717
00:48:32,484 --> 00:48:35,510
He had encroached on our
property and built a house.

718
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:37,450
You won't be able to shoot me.

719
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,225
You see the situation has changed.

720
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:44,652
You are a king merely
because of the title...

721
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:47,559
similarly, this pistol
is merely called one.

722
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,100
It belongs to a museum...

723
00:48:52,171 --> 00:48:54,105
and so do you, get lost!

724
00:48:57,176 --> 00:48:59,610
I came here to meet you,
Prabhu Tiwari...

725
00:49:00,045 --> 00:49:02,309
fortunately I got to
meet your family too.

726
00:49:04,783 --> 00:49:06,011
Kapoor!

727
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:08,615
You got the contract, didn't you?

728
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,883
You won't be able
to build the road.

729
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:17,025
Instead I'll have a
road named after you.

730
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,761
Minister...

731
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:23,663
the elections are around the corner.

732
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,898
Let's see who will
emerge as the winner.

733
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:35,572
I think...

734
00:49:35,648 --> 00:49:38,139
we should share this
contract with Saheb.

735
00:49:38,217 --> 00:49:39,479
Of course, Kapoor.

736
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,849
If I could, I would share
pieces of your body with everyone!

737
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,489
If we agree to a compromise,

738
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,852
my reputation won't be
where I want it to be.

739
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:47,721
That's not what I meant.
- Stop practicing the alphabet!

740
00:49:47,826 --> 00:49:49,919
It's better you practice my methods!

741
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,360
Gainda Singh...

742
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,591
whatever you do... do it smartly.

743
00:49:54,967 --> 00:49:57,868
There are examinations
to test intelligence...

744
00:49:58,404 --> 00:50:00,463
you don't need it
to avenge something.

745
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,410
What's this stone for?

746
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:18,489
That's Saheb.

747
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,488
He remains next to my bed.

748
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:23,584
It makes me happy.

749
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:58,729
My heart is thirsting

750
00:50:58,797 --> 00:51:02,790
Figure out what my heart is saying

751
00:51:03,202 --> 00:51:07,605
Or soon a new tune it will sing

752
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:10,732
If you don't, others will spring

753
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:13,004
You better figure this

754
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,304
My heart is thirsting

755
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:20,715
What can I do It bared
its soul just like a fool

756
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:25,051
I won't survive a moment without you

757
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:29,493
You are my life, it's true

758
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,498
What's wrong with you!

759
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,622
This I want you to know

760
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,997
What took place
between us happens no more

761
00:52:12,104 --> 00:52:16,268
What we have is our love to keep

762
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:22,171
It's only your love that I ever need

763
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:44,195
What?

764
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:45,895
How dare he touch me?
- No, I... no...

765
00:52:45,971 --> 00:52:48,201
How did he come in here?
Throw him out!

766
00:52:48,307 --> 00:52:50,832
How dare he touch me?

767
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:53,969
Take him away... I'll shoot him.

768
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,537
Throw him out... I'll shoot him.

769
00:52:56,648 --> 00:52:59,048
I did nothing, I swear... I was...
- How dare he touch me?

770
00:52:59,117 --> 00:53:01,108
How dare he touch me?

771
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,380
I didn't even touch you!

772
00:53:02,454 --> 00:53:05,685
You better go away or I'll shoot you!

773
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,224
I... I... was only singing a song...
I didn't do anything...

774
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,658
You better get away!

775
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,292
I hope she will be fine.

776
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,130
I am sorry.

777
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,472
Let me go, Mahua.

778
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:33,474
Winter will begin in a few days...

779
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,318
and the nights will last longer.

780
00:53:36,054 --> 00:53:37,885
We will have more
time together and...

781
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,523
And a lot more pleasure.

782
00:53:44,363 --> 00:53:46,661
Now why did you have
to use such a word?

783
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,167
It was like...

784
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:58,199
braving your anger and...

785
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,574
your insults at the same time.

786
00:54:00,078 --> 00:54:01,545
You got that wrong, Saheb.

787
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,572
It was only anger.

788
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:06,149
The insults played
around in my head.

789
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,714
They were meant for the night

790
00:54:09,821 --> 00:54:11,254
that went by so quickly.

791
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,355
It's not...

792
00:54:16,828 --> 00:54:18,261
pleasure.

793
00:54:20,332 --> 00:54:22,300
But a sense of calm
that you provide.

794
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,440
What do I mean to you?

795
00:54:39,084 --> 00:54:40,676
You are...

796
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:44,415
my...

797
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:46,854
habit.

798
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,985
Well, habits can change.

799
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:54,195
Correct.

800
00:54:55,233 --> 00:54:56,427
Therefore...

801
00:54:57,936 --> 00:55:00,097
don't turn into a vice that...

802
00:55:00,238 --> 00:55:01,762
I'll be forced to stop.

803
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:04,606
Here's 20,000 rupees.

804
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,577
I'll send more soon.

805
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,218
I don't need all of this.

806
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:18,218
You wish to contest the election...

807
00:55:18,423 --> 00:55:20,050
for which you'll need money.

808
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,618
I will start saving more of it.

809
00:55:24,262 --> 00:55:25,957
Earlier you insulted me
with your insolence...

810
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:27,988
and now you are killing
me with your prudence.

811
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,730
Why are you taking offence
to every word of mine?

812
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:33,794
You keep reminding me with
every word that I am broke.

813
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:35,731
That I need support...

814
00:55:35,807 --> 00:55:37,399
that I am in want of money.

815
00:55:37,643 --> 00:55:40,669
I need to look after
you all your life...

816
00:55:41,313 --> 00:55:42,473
and I will.

817
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:47,845
Saheb!

818
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,790
No, listen to me.

819
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:55,724
Lodge a complaint with the
cops that you suspect Saheb.

820
00:55:55,794 --> 00:55:56,920
Oh really! You want me to
complain with the cops?

821
00:55:56,995 --> 00:55:59,122
Or tell Kapoor's family to
lodge a complaint with the cops.

822
00:55:59,197 --> 00:56:00,664
That's very smart of you!

823
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,667
You want me to officially declare
that Saheb and I are enemies?

824
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,669
And when he is killed,
nobody will ever suspect me!

825
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,365
Who even appointed you as minister?

826
00:56:09,107 --> 00:56:10,506
Who appointed me as minister?

827
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,440
I told you this is my office.

828
00:56:12,544 --> 00:56:15,138
Stop buzzing around like mosquito!

829
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:17,610
Now wait a minute!

830
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:19,477
Yes!
- Yes sir?

831
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,984
Stop calling me sir and don't
think you can screw around with me!

832
00:56:22,054 --> 00:56:23,646
You were sent to do something,
what's the status?

833
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:24,814
That's precisely why I called!

834
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,858
Saheb spends every
night with his whore.

835
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:29,459
Is it every night or
whenever he feels like it?

836
00:56:29,828 --> 00:56:32,353
Gainda Singh, will you keep it
down... it's Saheb on the line.

837
00:56:32,698 --> 00:56:34,063
Hello! Yes, Saheb?

838
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:35,597
Minister...

839
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:37,562
I heard that Kapoor is no more.

840
00:56:37,669 --> 00:56:39,694
My area would have prospered...

841
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,262
had businessmen like
Kapoor invested here.

842
00:56:42,374 --> 00:56:45,673
In my area it is my people
that should prosper, minister.

843
00:56:45,977 --> 00:56:47,604
What's the status of my file, sir?

844
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:49,806
As soon as Saheb is gone,
your file will also vanish.

845
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:52,074
Your support is all
I ask for, Saheb.

846
00:56:52,317 --> 00:56:54,717
You know it's not easy
to make friends at my age.

847
00:56:54,886 --> 00:56:56,945
There's an English phrase...

848
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:59,050
'a leopard can never
change his spots'.

849
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,093
What was that?
Let me write it down.

850
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:04,853
This is what I like about you.

851
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,455
Apart from the votes,
I even get pearls of wisdom.

852
00:57:07,532 --> 00:57:09,966
This just proves that no matter

853
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,626
what you do... a dog's tail...
can never be straight!

854
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:13,830
Is that so?

855
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:16,703
That phrase is true for
both of us, Prabhu Tiwari.

856
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,206
The only difference is I'm
the leopard... Leopard.

857
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:22,208
And you're the dog.

858
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:25,013
I've hired some assassins,
I'll send them to Devgadh.

859
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,277
Let me know when he goes there.

860
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:27,612
Nothing is fixed...

861
00:57:27,786 --> 00:57:29,481
but he does go there
a few nights every week.

862
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:31,579
I shall kill you, Prabhu Tiwari...

863
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,156
and believe me it
will be my pleasure.

864
00:57:37,629 --> 00:57:38,926
In the elections...

865
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,063
I will defeat you.

866
00:57:47,973 --> 00:57:50,942
We will kill him
when he is with his whore.

867
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:52,841
Yes, sir.

868
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,242
What did he say?

869
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,881
What did he say?

870
00:57:59,084 --> 00:58:01,279
He said he will contest
the elections against me.

871
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,019
What have you thought about it?

872
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:04,487
I don't want to think.

873
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:07,353
I suggest you come up
with a plan to get rid of him.

874
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:10,261
Now you're talking like a minister.

875
00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:22,170
Don't move... Madam is watching.

876
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,099
Pull the bed sheet.

877
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,873
This is a
consequence of the songs...

878
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:31,877
you sing for her at night.

879
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:33,816
If Saheb gets as much as
a whiff about this...

880
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,410
neither will you be able to
play the guitar... nor sing.

881
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,823
You'll spend the rest of your
life counting stars from a bed.

882
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:46,355
Ever since I got here either
I have heard nonsense or warnings.

883
00:58:46,965 --> 00:58:49,763
Don't confuse my respect
for uncle as my weakness.

884
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:54,598
I know what this palace and the
people around here are truly like.

885
00:58:55,207 --> 00:58:57,072
Very soon all of them
will be resigned to history.

886
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:58,804
Once upon a time
there was a king...

887
00:58:58,877 --> 00:59:00,936
and his queen...
- Babloo, get the car.

888
00:59:30,742 --> 00:59:32,710
What happened last night?
- Sorry?

889
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:35,543
Nothing at all.

890
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:37,844
I was singing a song for you and...

891
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,683
well, suddenly you took ill.

892
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,616
You must be very bad at singing.

893
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,119
I guess.

894
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:47,186
Nothing else happened, right?

895
00:59:48,727 --> 00:59:50,092
Of course not.

896
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:54,588
I remember everything...

897
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:56,360
I know what you did.

898
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:01,269
Opportunist!

899
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:32,398
My eyes were deceived and

900
01:00:32,637 --> 01:00:36,767
I fell in love

901
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:42,105
My eyes were deceived and

902
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,712
I fell in love

903
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:55,988
A cheat you came
along and I trusted you

904
01:00:57,162 --> 01:01:06,332
A no-good con artist
like you I trusted

905
01:01:07,138 --> 01:01:15,773
A cheat you came
along and I trusted you

906
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:21,550
My eyes were deceived and

907
01:01:21,653 --> 01:01:25,919
I fell in love

908
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:31,657
My eyes were deceived and

909
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:36,594
I fell in love

910
01:01:49,714 --> 01:02:00,090
Ever since I looked into your eyes

911
01:02:02,627 --> 01:02:12,662
Ever since I looked into your eyes

912
01:02:14,072 --> 01:02:19,374
My eyes were deceived and

913
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:23,642
I fell in love

914
01:02:40,899 --> 01:02:44,198
What's the matter? Tell me!

915
01:02:44,903 --> 01:02:46,495
Soon you will be gone...

916
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,500
Sundar is much better now.

917
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:50,470
How about another fracture?

918
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,405
It was a joke!

919
01:02:58,049 --> 01:02:59,710
It's probably a joke for you...

920
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,579
but I believe it to be true.

921
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:06,083
What?

922
01:03:10,095 --> 01:03:11,756
I am in love with you.

923
01:03:14,566 --> 01:03:16,193
You will go away...

924
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,894
leaving me behind all alone...

925
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,301
and sick.

926
01:03:30,315 --> 01:03:33,682
I'll ask Saheb to give
me a job at the palace.

927
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:38,850
Only people loyal to him
get to live at the palace.

928
01:03:40,225 --> 01:03:41,852
Are you loyal to him?

929
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:50,696
No.

930
01:03:52,937 --> 01:03:54,632
What are you looking at?

931
01:03:56,808 --> 01:03:59,368
You are...
- I'll tell you...

932
01:03:59,444 --> 01:04:01,776
you don't have class.
You are a brute!

933
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,972
I'm not worthy of this.

934
01:04:06,684 --> 01:04:08,447
I am aware of your worth.

935
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:12,585
Opportunist! Please don't say that!

936
01:04:14,859 --> 01:04:16,087
I'II...

937
01:04:18,429 --> 01:04:20,363
take up a job at the palace.

938
01:04:20,932 --> 01:04:22,399
And...

939
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,065
I will earn Saheb's loyalty

940
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,664
and become...

941
01:04:26,804 --> 01:04:28,203
your Saheb.

942
01:04:31,876 --> 01:04:33,741
Really? How?

943
01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:15,153
That's enough.

944
01:05:21,735 --> 01:05:23,168
What else have you told Gainda Singh?

945
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,567
I told him that...

946
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:27,734
you meet a woman at Shikaar Baadi.

947
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,413
What do I do with you?

948
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:36,008
Give me...

949
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,710
a job over here, Saheb.

950
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:41,249
I will guard you with my life.

951
01:05:42,122 --> 01:05:45,580
I confessed that I was
working for Gainda Singh.

952
01:05:47,661 --> 01:05:49,891
You can kill me if you wish.

953
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:51,791
I have...

954
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:53,489
proved my loyalty.

955
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:56,860
Lock him up.

956
01:05:57,104 --> 01:05:58,696
Gainda Singh will attack you, Saheb.

957
01:05:58,772 --> 01:06:00,399
Gainda Singh will attack you.

958
01:06:00,507 --> 01:06:01,599
Be careful.

959
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,766
Gainda Singh will...

960
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:03,968
attack you.

961
01:06:04,178 --> 01:06:06,476
Trust me, Saheb...

962
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:14,713
In search of the
fragrance I flew high and away

963
01:06:14,821 --> 01:06:18,723
But in the jungle I went astray

964
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:23,558
Will I turn into a star someday

965
01:06:23,664 --> 01:06:28,658
Or remain here as an innocent loser

966
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:05,060
Come on soon!

967
01:07:12,746 --> 01:07:13,940
Saheb...

968
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:17,442
Sir...

969
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:20,779
Saheb!

970
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,558
This is for you.

971
01:07:35,168 --> 01:07:36,294
Saheb has sent this for you.

972
01:07:38,038 --> 01:07:39,164
But why?

973
01:07:40,607 --> 01:07:42,507
You aren't just a driver anymore.

974
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:46,078
Saheb feels you can be trusted...

975
01:07:46,847 --> 01:07:48,109
but I don't.

976
01:07:48,615 --> 01:07:50,742
You don't think I can be trusted?

977
01:07:51,885 --> 01:07:54,149
People who are loyal don't question.

978
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,814
Saheb feels you can be trusted...

979
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:00,817
and I didn't question him.

980
01:08:01,528 --> 01:08:02,654
Listen carefully.

981
01:08:02,729 --> 01:08:03,889
Okay.

982
01:08:03,964 --> 01:08:05,693
If you make another mistake...

983
01:08:06,466 --> 01:08:08,093
Saheb will be upset.

984
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,497
But I will kill you.

985
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:19,372
How's the pain?

986
01:08:19,446 --> 01:08:20,879
It's much better now.

987
01:08:39,099 --> 01:08:40,691
Because of him I got to retire.

988
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,691
I've fulfilled my responsibility.

989
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:46,331
You think a traitor
can ever be responsible?

990
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:48,736
He has confessed to his mistake.

991
01:08:50,344 --> 01:08:51,811
The mistake is yet to happen.

992
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,006
Now it's merely the
thought of making one.

993
01:09:03,924 --> 01:09:05,050
Happy Birthday...

994
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,217
your Highness.

995
01:09:08,261 --> 01:09:09,387
Thank you.

996
01:09:10,097 --> 01:09:11,359
I heard you were attacked.

997
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,729
Did you find out who they were?

998
01:09:15,535 --> 01:09:16,661
Well...

999
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,796
there are plenty out there
who don't want me alive.

1000
01:09:20,607 --> 01:09:21,972
This is for you.

1001
01:09:22,676 --> 01:09:24,371
I hope you'll like it.

1002
01:09:24,945 --> 01:09:26,572
You shouldn't have!

1003
01:09:27,147 --> 01:09:29,047
I have more than 400 sarees...

1004
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:30,673
and I haven't worn some...
- Surely you can accept it.

1005
01:09:31,218 --> 01:09:33,118
It has been paid for with your money.

1006
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,682
Girdhari...

1007
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,050
set the table.

1008
01:09:39,126 --> 01:09:40,252
Sure.

1009
01:09:44,364 --> 01:09:46,332
You can spare me the
sarcasm for today.

1010
01:09:46,566 --> 01:09:48,500
At least once a year...

1011
01:09:48,568 --> 01:09:50,593
you can accord me some respect.

1012
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,400
Trust me, I do try. But...

1013
01:09:55,909 --> 01:09:56,933
sorry.

1014
01:10:01,915 --> 01:10:02,973
This is for you.

1015
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:04,175
Oh no!

1016
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:06,048
You have provided us with everything.

1017
01:10:06,153 --> 01:10:07,245
Please.

1018
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:09,382
I am giving it to you.

1019
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:10,783
It's my wish...

1020
01:10:11,024 --> 01:10:12,218
take it.

1021
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:17,756
Oops...

1022
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:22,061
sorry.

1023
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,500
How did you get hurt?

1024
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:24,930
It's nothing...

1025
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,199
There was some water
and I didn't see it...

1026
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,536
You didn't see it? You
really didn't see it.

1027
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:30,333
When Saheb was leaving the palace...

1028
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,843
did you not look at him?

1029
01:10:31,945 --> 01:10:33,879
He was wearing a bullet-proof vest.

1030
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,175
I'm sure it was obvious,
but you didn't see.

1031
01:10:37,784 --> 01:10:39,217
I sent you there to spy for me...

1032
01:10:39,286 --> 01:10:40,776
and you are enjoying
the palace as a tourist!

1033
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:42,183
That's not true, sir.

1034
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:43,415
Babloo...

1035
01:10:43,857 --> 01:10:46,052
you aren't taking this seriously.

1036
01:10:46,726 --> 01:10:49,559
Guess you've forgotten that you
are accused for attempt to murder.

1037
01:10:51,565 --> 01:10:53,123
I'm sorry for your loss.

1038
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:55,891
The Lord decides everything.

1039
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:57,334
This is Babloo.
- Give me a cigarette!

1040
01:10:57,571 --> 01:10:58,663
Babloo...

1041
01:10:58,738 --> 01:11:00,103
your case is in his hands.

1042
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,663
Seek his blessings and you
will be safe. - Greetings, sir.

1043
01:11:01,741 --> 01:11:03,641
I am sorry about your father.

1044
01:11:03,743 --> 01:11:05,301
Cut the crap!

1045
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:06,840
Did you know him?

1046
01:11:07,214 --> 01:11:08,545
Listen carefully.

1047
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:11,444
The Lakhimpur Bridge
contract will be out soon.

1048
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:14,611
I want to know Saheb's bid.

1049
01:11:18,124 --> 01:11:20,592
You are very good at kite flying,
I didn't know this.

1050
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:22,417
If you continue to stay at home...

1051
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:24,896
you will learn a lot about me.

1052
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:26,291
Kanhaiya...

1053
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,731
why don't you shoot me...

1054
01:11:27,834 --> 01:11:29,131
so I can't leave home.

1055
01:11:29,236 --> 01:11:30,533
Allow me the honor.

1056
01:11:30,804 --> 01:11:31,998
I will shoot you...

1057
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:33,805
so that you can't go anywhere.

1058
01:11:33,907 --> 01:11:34,999
Is that so?

1059
01:11:35,108 --> 01:11:36,200
Yes.

1060
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:37,799
Good afternoon sir.

1061
01:11:44,451 --> 01:11:45,884
I met Gainda Singh.

1062
01:11:46,653 --> 01:11:49,918
He wants to know what you are
bidding for the Lakhimpur Bridge.

1063
01:11:50,624 --> 01:11:51,818
200 million.

1064
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,218
Tell him.

1065
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:56,462
He will bid a lower
amount and get the contract.

1066
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:02,396
I will set up a new
company in Madam's name...

1067
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:04,528
and enter another bid at 150 million.

1068
01:12:12,512 --> 01:12:14,537
Why don't you go out for a drive?

1069
01:12:14,614 --> 01:12:16,138
Babloo... get the car.

1070
01:12:16,516 --> 01:12:17,676
Yes.

1071
01:12:22,222 --> 01:12:23,985
I don't feel like going out.

1072
01:12:24,524 --> 01:12:25,923
I am fine.

1073
01:12:27,394 --> 01:12:28,827
I have...

1074
01:12:28,895 --> 01:12:30,294
a headache.

1075
01:12:30,564 --> 01:12:32,088
But I don't want to go!

1076
01:12:50,383 --> 01:12:53,250
Just because you are good at
flying kites doesn't mean...

1077
01:12:53,486 --> 01:12:55,317
you let my words fly
out into the open.

1078
01:12:55,422 --> 01:12:56,616
Now go.

1079
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,651
She breathes for her husband

1080
01:13:02,762 --> 01:13:05,526
But she has many lovers

1081
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:10,366
She breathes for her husband

1082
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,370
But she has many lovers

1083
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:14,268
She is nobody's slave

1084
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:16,366
She strikes like lightning

1085
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:18,967
Come and be mine

1086
01:13:19,045 --> 01:13:22,811
Oh be mine

1087
01:13:23,783 --> 01:13:25,683
Her walk sets my heart on fire

1088
01:13:25,785 --> 01:13:27,377
Her steps put me under a spell

1089
01:13:27,454 --> 01:13:28,944
No, don't need it.

1090
01:13:40,567 --> 01:13:41,864
Who is that?

1091
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,132
The cure for Saheb's headache.

1092
01:13:46,706 --> 01:13:50,836
She looks amazing And she is sensuous

1093
01:13:50,944 --> 01:13:52,741
She loves to flirt

1094
01:13:52,812 --> 01:13:54,803
She's more intoxicating than wine

1095
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:57,145
Come and be mine

1096
01:13:58,785 --> 01:14:01,117
Oh be mine

1097
01:14:03,623 --> 01:14:04,885
Babloo, turn the car around.

1098
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:06,284
I want to go home.

1099
01:14:06,393 --> 01:14:07,553
But why? What's wrong?

1100
01:14:08,428 --> 01:14:10,328
She was going in and
I was stepping out...

1101
01:14:10,664 --> 01:14:11,926
eventually that's what will happen.

1102
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:14,032
How dare she...

1103
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,431
I want to go home.

1104
01:14:15,502 --> 01:14:17,527
Why are you worried about her?
Who the hell is she?

1105
01:14:17,637 --> 01:14:19,468
Stop the car... I want to go home.

1106
01:14:27,447 --> 01:14:29,415
Her moves are swift and fast

1107
01:14:29,516 --> 01:14:32,383
She can be crazy

1108
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:41,382
Lalit...

1109
01:14:41,461 --> 01:14:42,689
Lalit...

1110
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:44,325
Lalit...

1111
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,160
Lalit...

1112
01:14:47,534 --> 01:14:48,762
Lalit...

1113
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,696
I am here.
- Lalit...

1114
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:51,998
I am here.
- Lalit...

1115
01:14:52,105 --> 01:14:53,333
I am right here.

1116
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,800
I wasn't calling out to you.

1117
01:14:57,977 --> 01:14:59,342
I was calling out to him...

1118
01:15:00,213 --> 01:15:01,805
who was killed by them.

1119
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:04,407
Who killed...

1120
01:15:05,018 --> 01:15:06,246
They killed Lalit.

1121
01:15:10,056 --> 01:15:11,250
But why?

1122
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:13,725
Because he loved me.

1123
01:15:17,197 --> 01:15:18,562
Only he ever...

1124
01:15:19,365 --> 01:15:20,923
truly loved me.

1125
01:15:24,637 --> 01:15:25,899
Before your wedding?

1126
01:15:30,844 --> 01:15:32,675
Even I love you.

1127
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:35,775
And they will kill you too.

1128
01:15:36,883 --> 01:15:38,407
I will be fine.

1129
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,310
Before they can kill us...

1130
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:45,282
you should kill them all.

1131
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:49,160
Kill whom?

1132
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:54,759
Mahua.

1133
01:15:55,368 --> 01:15:58,997
Why are you worried about her,
let her be with Saheb.

1134
01:15:59,405 --> 01:16:00,531
As long as she is alive...

1135
01:16:00,607 --> 01:16:03,132
Saheb will squander
every thing for her.

1136
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:05,336
I will be resigned to
a room in the palace...

1137
01:16:06,012 --> 01:16:08,037
and you will be her chauffeur.

1138
01:16:15,421 --> 01:16:17,321
Fine, I'll kill her, then what?

1139
01:16:18,424 --> 01:16:21,291
Saheb's trips will be over
and so will our time together.

1140
01:16:26,599 --> 01:16:28,533
Do you like meeting like this?

1141
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:34,570
No.

1142
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,206
We'll meet without any fear.

1143
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:39,005
Restore my status back
to where it truly belongs.

1144
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,151
Then I will claim my right.

1145
01:17:16,649 --> 01:17:17,911
Yes?

1146
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:22,515
Okay, that's fine.

1147
01:17:22,622 --> 01:17:23,680
You too.

1148
01:17:24,757 --> 01:17:26,816
Got some good news after ages.

1149
01:17:27,627 --> 01:17:29,060
I got the contract.

1150
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:30,592
That's great, Saheb.

1151
01:17:33,132 --> 01:17:35,566
You better stop
shedding those tears...

1152
01:17:35,668 --> 01:17:38,228
the chicken will turn out salty.
- Sir!

1153
01:17:38,338 --> 01:17:39,930
That was a huge contract.

1154
01:17:40,006 --> 01:17:41,769
I think about it and start crying.

1155
01:17:41,975 --> 01:17:43,465
Don't worry...

1156
01:17:45,011 --> 01:17:47,639
you can have the tender chicken leg.
- Sir...

1157
01:17:47,714 --> 01:17:48,874
I am a vegetarian.

1158
01:17:49,215 --> 01:17:50,409
Vegetarian!

1159
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:51,942
Gainda Singh...

1160
01:17:52,051 --> 01:17:53,109
this wasn't necessary.

1161
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:56,347
Perhaps the red beans are
actually black eyed beans.

1162
01:17:56,456 --> 01:17:57,480
It's alright, sir.

1163
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,080
We aren't out on the streets, sir.

1164
01:17:59,192 --> 01:18:00,921
We'll get some other contract.

1165
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:02,254
That's the spirit.

1166
01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:05,357
That's the spirit, Mr. Tandon.
- How can you say that, sir?

1167
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:07,928
We had to travel up
and down a hundred times.

1168
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:10,133
We even paid Gainda
Singh quite a hefty amount.

1169
01:18:10,203 --> 01:18:11,329
It's alright, Kashyap.

1170
01:18:11,404 --> 01:18:12,769
Sir, you may think it's alright...

1171
01:18:12,872 --> 01:18:14,533
but I've got to manage the business.

1172
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,165
How can we conduct business...

1173
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:17,573
on false promises?

1174
01:18:17,644 --> 01:18:18,804
That's enough!

1175
01:18:23,716 --> 01:18:25,081
Now why would you do that?

1176
01:18:25,184 --> 01:18:27,277
Mr. Tandon is a vegetarian.

1177
01:18:29,589 --> 01:18:32,353
My heart is already burning
with anger over my own mistake...

1178
01:18:32,692 --> 01:18:34,455
then why did he have
to stoke the flame!

1179
01:18:34,527 --> 01:18:35,721
Sir...

1180
01:18:35,828 --> 01:18:37,159
Sir... my wife had warned me...

1181
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:39,388
about conducting
business in this area.

1182
01:18:39,499 --> 01:18:42,059
The people over here aren't
as bad as you think they are.

1183
01:18:43,069 --> 01:18:44,400
Conduct your business...

1184
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:47,496
not your wicked deeds.

1185
01:18:58,451 --> 01:18:59,748
Saheb...

1186
01:19:00,353 --> 01:19:01,945
it's Mr. Tandon.

1187
01:19:03,289 --> 01:19:07,123
I apologize that you had
to walk through the jungle.

1188
01:19:07,927 --> 01:19:09,394
You see, it's a small area...

1189
01:19:09,462 --> 01:19:10,952
and there aren't many
places to have a secret meeting.

1190
01:19:11,064 --> 01:19:12,554
That's alright, sir.
- How are you?

1191
01:19:15,034 --> 01:19:16,365
It's okay, he works for me.

1192
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:19,099
Tell me something...

1193
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:21,572
if you had won the
contract for the bridge...

1194
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:24,471
what would be your cut?

1195
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,278
About 60-70 million, sir.

1196
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,472
Okay.

1197
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:30,780
I suggest...

1198
01:19:31,384 --> 01:19:33,079
you give me 30 million...

1199
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:34,710
and you can construct it.

1200
01:19:35,455 --> 01:19:38,356
I mean, I'd rather not get
into this construction thing.

1201
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,755
But...

1202
01:19:40,093 --> 01:19:42,152
but if I join hands with you...

1203
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:43,990
Tiwari and Gainda Singh will...

1204
01:19:44,097 --> 01:19:45,155
come...

1205
01:19:45,264 --> 01:19:46,663
come after me.

1206
01:19:48,067 --> 01:19:50,331
Why don't you stay back,
we'll cook a deer for you.

1207
01:19:50,603 --> 01:19:52,901
You see, I am a vegetarian, sir.

1208
01:19:52,972 --> 01:19:54,371
And I need to get to Delhi.

1209
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,998
There's a flight in
two hours from Lucknow.

1210
01:19:56,809 --> 01:19:59,300
Great! I'll come
along with you to Delhi.

1211
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,442
You can arrange for my lunch and...

1212
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,038
the money.

1213
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:06,744
But what about
Tiwari and Gainda Singh?

1214
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,989
If you would have received
this contract, do you think...

1215
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:13,424
I would spare your life?

1216
01:20:16,329 --> 01:20:18,627
I have had people killed in Delhi.

1217
01:20:20,133 --> 01:20:21,964
Alright, let's go.

1218
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:29,398
There's something
about these clothes...

1219
01:20:33,813 --> 01:20:35,747
and it feels good.

1220
01:20:37,483 --> 01:20:38,916
What do you think?

1221
01:20:39,619 --> 01:20:41,416
I think you look
better without clothes.

1222
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:43,746
Well that's only in bed.

1223
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:48,026
Get used to seeing me
with my clothes on too.

1224
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:53,061
It's not only in bed
that we'll be together.

1225
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:56,296
This is how you'll walk with me.

1226
01:20:58,704 --> 01:21:00,228
Come...

1227
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:03,470
closer to me.

1228
01:21:14,087 --> 01:21:15,884
Now who is this black stone for?

1229
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:17,989
You.

1230
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,092
I am black?

1231
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:26,322
It's because you sneak
in at night in the dark.

1232
01:21:32,171 --> 01:21:33,798
Massage my feet.

1233
01:21:33,906 --> 01:21:34,964
What?!

1234
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,135
Why...

1235
01:21:37,677 --> 01:21:38,837
Is there a problem?

1236
01:21:40,246 --> 01:21:42,840
I don't think Saheb
ever gave you this joy.

1237
01:21:48,788 --> 01:21:49,948
A little over here...

1238
01:21:50,056 --> 01:21:51,648
it hurts a lot.

1239
01:21:59,432 --> 01:22:00,729
Answer!

1240
01:22:02,101 --> 01:22:03,261
Saheb!

1241
01:22:07,306 --> 01:22:08,500
Yes, sir?

1242
01:22:10,576 --> 01:22:11,702
Okay, sir.

1243
01:22:13,246 --> 01:22:13,974
Okay.

1244
01:22:15,748 --> 01:22:17,477
I have to take Mahua to Lucknow.

1245
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,747
Saheb will come
back there from Delhi.

1246
01:22:23,656 --> 01:22:25,453
You can kill Mahua on the way.

1247
01:22:26,292 --> 01:22:27,623
A car accident...

1248
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,093
or shoot her, say you were attacked.

1249
01:22:30,163 --> 01:22:31,687
Prabhu Tiwari...

1250
01:22:32,932 --> 01:22:34,365
Hold on...

1251
01:22:35,635 --> 01:22:37,125
let me think.

1252
01:22:41,474 --> 01:22:42,873
Continue with the massage...

1253
01:22:43,976 --> 01:22:45,876
it helps me think.

1254
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:49,805
I don't want this joy.

1255
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,816
I'm not used to it.

1256
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,981
Saheb himself will kill Mahua.

1257
01:23:12,638 --> 01:23:13,832
How?

1258
01:23:15,274 --> 01:23:16,707
How?

1259
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:20,035
I want you to tell me, how?

1260
01:23:28,354 --> 01:23:30,185
I haven't seen you before.

1261
01:23:30,623 --> 01:23:32,181
It's only recently that I got to

1262
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:33,623
this position that I could be seen.

1263
01:23:37,163 --> 01:23:38,960
You have a good sense of humor.

1264
01:23:39,732 --> 01:23:41,029
Are you educated?

1265
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,328
I'm a graduate.

1266
01:23:42,668 --> 01:23:43,862
Really?

1267
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,528
At least I have interesting company.

1268
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:47,334
I'll send my stuff.

1269
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:49,271
Excuse me, please... please...

1270
01:23:49,342 --> 01:23:50,832
my phone battery has died out.

1271
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,774
May I use yours?

1272
01:23:53,546 --> 01:23:55,013
Sure.
- Thank you.

1273
01:23:59,218 --> 01:24:00,310
Babloo...

1274
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:01,546
listen to me.

1275
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:03,486
Stop calling me.

1276
01:24:03,856 --> 01:24:05,346
I asked you to do something...

1277
01:24:05,424 --> 01:24:06,652
but it backfired on me.

1278
01:24:06,759 --> 01:24:08,420
But sir, it's not my fault.

1279
01:24:08,494 --> 01:24:11,019
I informed you about the
bid amount for the contract.

1280
01:24:11,097 --> 01:24:12,997
Of course, it's not your fault.

1281
01:24:13,266 --> 01:24:15,427
Apparently, your
star signs and mine...

1282
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:17,093
don't seem to match.

1283
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,528
Get lost...

1284
01:24:18,638 --> 01:24:19,764
move it.

1285
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:22,369
Now, before I get hurt again...

1286
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,773
I think we should end
our relationship, Okay?

1287
01:24:24,844 --> 01:24:26,436
Please don't say that, sir.

1288
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,144
Right now, I'm about to give
you some juicy information.

1289
01:24:29,215 --> 01:24:30,648
And then you can either kill me...

1290
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,274
or do anything you want with me.

1291
01:24:32,852 --> 01:24:33,978
Go on!

1292
01:24:34,053 --> 01:24:36,453
Saheb and his darling
will spend the night...

1293
01:24:36,555 --> 01:24:39,080
at Jaiswal's farm house.

1294
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:41,887
Kanhaiya will be there and...

1295
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:43,222
so will I.

1296
01:24:43,296 --> 01:24:45,059
Choose an auspicious
hour for your attack.

1297
01:24:45,765 --> 01:24:47,130
Fine.

1298
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,323
This better be good because...

1299
01:24:49,435 --> 01:24:51,062
even if Saheb gets out alive...

1300
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:53,128
I'll make sure you die.

1301
01:25:00,646 --> 01:25:01,977
Welcome...

1302
01:25:02,748 --> 01:25:03,806
Hello!

1303
01:25:03,883 --> 01:25:05,180
Please come!

1304
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:11,857
You have a nice place.
- Thank you.

1305
01:25:15,261 --> 01:25:16,489
Sir...

1306
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:18,562
darling is at the venue...

1307
01:25:18,898 --> 01:25:20,388
the other is yet to come.

1308
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:22,161
Should be here soon.

1309
01:25:22,268 --> 01:25:23,565
Inform me immediately.

1310
01:25:23,636 --> 01:25:24,796
Alright, sir.

1311
01:25:27,106 --> 01:25:28,505
So... who lives here?
- Well...

1312
01:25:28,574 --> 01:25:29,700
Excuse me...

1313
01:25:29,775 --> 01:25:30,867
your phone.

1314
01:25:30,976 --> 01:25:32,102
It was in the car.

1315
01:25:33,112 --> 01:25:34,443
Saheb is calling.

1316
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:36,374
Hello...

1317
01:25:37,149 --> 01:25:38,446
yes, I am here.

1318
01:25:39,352 --> 01:25:40,614
Okay.

1319
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:43,047
He will be here soon.

1320
01:25:43,122 --> 01:25:44,555
Oh! Very nice.

1321
01:25:55,368 --> 01:25:56,494
Welcome Saheb.

1322
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:57,866
How are you, Jaiswal?

1323
01:25:57,937 --> 01:25:59,928
Everything in order?
- Don't worry about anything.

1324
01:26:00,005 --> 01:26:01,131
Everything has been taken care of.

1325
01:26:01,207 --> 01:26:02,401
My servant and I are here.

1326
01:26:02,508 --> 01:26:04,373
I gave the others a day off.
- Thank you Jaiswal.

1327
01:26:04,443 --> 01:26:06,138
With elections around the
corner we have to be cautious...

1328
01:26:06,212 --> 01:26:07,679
about what we do.
- Exactly.

1329
01:26:07,947 --> 01:26:10,780
With whom we spend time...
- Don't you worry at all.

1330
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:12,317
Madam is inside.

1331
01:26:12,685 --> 01:26:14,516
Yes!
- Not her...

1332
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:16,687
I was talking about you.

1333
01:26:17,523 --> 01:26:19,252
Oh yes!
- See you in the morning.

1334
01:26:22,962 --> 01:26:24,589
Working on your shopping list?

1335
01:26:24,697 --> 01:26:25,925
No...

1336
01:26:25,998 --> 01:26:27,863
I was anxiously waiting for you.

1337
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,195
Would you like some tea?

1338
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:31,134
Tea... at this hour?

1339
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:32,798
Kanhaiya!

1340
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,032
Wow!

1341
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:37,871
A record player!

1342
01:26:38,644 --> 01:26:42,171
Does it play?
- I'll check.

1343
01:27:07,673 --> 01:27:09,300
There are four people.

1344
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:11,073
So, we'll storm in?

1345
01:27:11,777 --> 01:27:13,039
Where are you?

1346
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,375
Behind the tree
that's in front of you.

1347
01:27:16,782 --> 01:27:17,874
Now?

1348
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,211
No, wait...

1349
01:27:19,285 --> 01:27:20,718
Enter only when I tell you to.

1350
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,912
Okay.

1351
01:28:43,602 --> 01:28:45,593
He betrayed us.

1352
01:28:46,805 --> 01:28:48,033
Babloo!

1353
01:28:48,374 --> 01:28:50,842
Saheb, he told me...

1354
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:54,111
there would be no one else but...

1355
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:13,661
Hail the king!

1356
01:29:27,846 --> 01:29:29,473
Let them chant some more...

1357
01:29:29,582 --> 01:29:30,844
I'll be out soon.

1358
01:29:33,185 --> 01:29:34,277
Let's go.

1359
01:29:39,658 --> 01:29:41,455
What is it? Now what's troubling you?

1360
01:29:41,527 --> 01:29:42,721
What's wrong with you?

1361
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,092
Why don't you tell me, Saheb?

1362
01:29:46,165 --> 01:29:48,133
Take a look at this mobile bill.

1363
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:49,725
You are only supposed to sign,
Madhavi.

1364
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:51,030
Not go through the call list.

1365
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:53,229
What if Mahua's bill is
comparatively high this month?

1366
01:29:53,739 --> 01:29:55,138
I care a damn...

1367
01:29:55,207 --> 01:29:57,175
if she fritters away your wealth.

1368
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:59,502
But I won't tolerate...

1369
01:29:59,578 --> 01:30:01,170
if she plays around with your life.

1370
01:30:01,614 --> 01:30:03,138
What are you talking about?

1371
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,750
Check the numbers called on the 12th.

1372
01:30:07,019 --> 01:30:08,748
A particular number was called twice.

1373
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:10,584
What... whose number is it?

1374
01:30:11,123 --> 01:30:12,317
Was.

1375
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:14,891
It was Gainda Singh's number.

1376
01:30:17,096 --> 01:30:19,064
That's the day he attacked you.

1377
01:30:58,904 --> 01:31:00,337
Another drink?

1378
01:31:02,508 --> 01:31:03,805
What's the matter?

1379
01:31:04,309 --> 01:31:06,140
You seem lost.

1380
01:31:11,784 --> 01:31:13,046
Listen...

1381
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,413
tell me something.

1382
01:31:15,688 --> 01:31:16,848
What?

1383
01:31:19,124 --> 01:31:20,989
I know I have loved you...

1384
01:31:24,096 --> 01:31:25,688
and also made you cry.

1385
01:31:29,435 --> 01:31:31,130
Have I given you more love...

1386
01:31:32,071 --> 01:31:33,402
or tears?

1387
01:31:36,608 --> 01:31:37,768
Both.

1388
01:32:29,128 --> 01:32:30,618
Saheb...

1389
01:32:31,563 --> 01:32:33,155
Saheb...

1390
01:32:33,499 --> 01:32:35,160
Saheb...

1391
01:32:37,202 --> 01:32:39,762
Here they come, loud and strong

1392
01:32:39,872 --> 01:32:44,400
Hundreds they've
brought to the ground

1393
01:32:46,845 --> 01:32:49,336
Here they come, loud and strong

1394
01:32:49,414 --> 01:32:54,078
Hundreds they've
brought to the ground

1395
01:32:54,186 --> 01:32:56,848
The kings now hold the reins

1396
01:32:56,955 --> 01:33:01,289
Having tasted blood
from a thousand veins

1397
01:33:01,393 --> 01:33:03,657
Quick and fast, to get things done

1398
01:33:03,729 --> 01:33:05,924
Swift and brave, under the same sun

1399
01:33:06,031 --> 01:33:08,397
Quick and fast, to get things done

1400
01:33:08,467 --> 01:33:10,560
Swift and brave, under the same sun

1401
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:12,933
The path is fraught
with untold danger

1402
01:33:13,038 --> 01:33:15,472
No one ever got out alive

1403
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:17,839
Walked from miles only to reach

1404
01:33:17,943 --> 01:33:20,810
The spot he had just gone by

1405
01:33:20,913 --> 01:33:22,972
Round and round goes the maze

1406
01:33:23,048 --> 01:33:25,573
Spells and witchcraft abound

1407
01:33:25,651 --> 01:33:27,676
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins

1408
01:33:27,786 --> 01:33:29,981
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns

1409
01:33:30,055 --> 01:33:32,387
Oh how the sinister plot unfolds

1410
01:33:32,457 --> 01:33:34,015
Spells and witchcraft abound

1411
01:33:34,092 --> 01:33:36,322
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins

1412
01:33:36,428 --> 01:33:38,521
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns

1413
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:41,030
Oh how the sinister plot unfolds

1414
01:33:42,968 --> 01:33:45,960
We are landlords and we don't need
to beg for anything from anyone!

1415
01:33:46,471 --> 01:33:48,939
Once was a king very tough

1416
01:33:49,007 --> 01:33:51,373
And his queen with unbridled love

1417
01:33:51,443 --> 01:33:53,775
The king was also charming and mild

1418
01:33:53,846 --> 01:33:56,246
But the queen's temper,
untamed and wild

1419
01:33:56,348 --> 01:33:58,646
Along came a bloke following his luck

1420
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,980
With the might of a storm he struck

1421
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:03,544
The king and queen
were hooked to his jingles

1422
01:34:03,622 --> 01:34:06,284
And he pulled their
strings with his fingers

1423
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:08,450
Round and round goes the maze

1424
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,118
Spells and witchcraft abound

1425
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:12,663
Everything here is upside down
Heaven help, oh the terrible sins

1426
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:15,723
Swindlers trapped by
their own wicked djinns

1427
01:34:15,834 --> 01:34:18,735
Oh how the sinister plot unfolds

1428
01:34:19,471 --> 01:34:20,733
Who is it?

1429
01:34:21,974 --> 01:34:23,100
It's me.

1430
01:34:36,355 --> 01:34:37,617
Come in.

1431
01:35:42,354 --> 01:35:43,685
Wake up!

1432
01:35:47,192 --> 01:35:48,716
Shall I add a large one to the tea?

1433
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:50,792
Your day will be a breeze.

1434
01:35:52,564 --> 01:35:56,091
Why don't you talk a
little less in the morning!

1435
01:36:00,305 --> 01:36:02,273
Have you gone blind?

1436
01:36:27,799 --> 01:36:29,790
Had you done this a long
time ago, I would've relented.

1437
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:31,334
But now...

1438
01:36:31,737 --> 01:36:32,999
Let me go or I will scream!

1439
01:36:33,105 --> 01:36:34,732
I do the same thing...

1440
01:36:34,806 --> 01:36:36,171
your father does...

1441
01:36:36,241 --> 01:36:37,469
Suman.

1442
01:36:37,576 --> 01:36:38,838
Wait a minute!

1443
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:41,242
My forefathers have been
commanders of the army here.

1444
01:36:41,513 --> 01:36:45,108
They had taken an oath
to protect Saheb's family.

1445
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:46,946
My father is the commander.

1446
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:49,247
But I only want to marry you.

1447
01:36:58,163 --> 01:36:59,289
Morning, sir.

1448
01:37:00,532 --> 01:37:01,658
What's the news?

1449
01:37:02,034 --> 01:37:03,092
Everything is...

1450
01:37:03,168 --> 01:37:04,294
under control.

1451
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:06,569
Mr. Tandon is coming over today.

1452
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:11,740
Greetings, Saheb.

1453
01:37:11,943 --> 01:37:13,535
Suman, something special today?

1454
01:37:13,612 --> 01:37:14,738
Saheb...

1455
01:37:14,813 --> 01:37:15,939
today is my birthday.

1456
01:37:16,014 --> 01:37:17,276
Oh...

1457
01:37:17,449 --> 01:37:18,507
Congratulations!

1458
01:37:18,617 --> 01:37:19,845
Thank you, Saheb.

1459
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:22,211
Bless you.

1460
01:37:22,421 --> 01:37:23,683
My best wishes to you, Suman.

1461
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:24,847
Thank you.

1462
01:37:30,529 --> 01:37:31,655
Happy birthday...

1463
01:37:31,963 --> 01:37:33,089
to you.

1464
01:37:34,366 --> 01:37:35,594
Father...
- Bless you.

1465
01:37:38,703 --> 01:37:39,795
Suman.

1466
01:37:40,138 --> 01:37:41,196
Yes, Saheb?

1467
01:37:43,442 --> 01:37:44,636
This is for you.

1468
01:37:45,677 --> 01:37:47,406
You have always provided
all that I need, Saheb.

1469
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:48,571
Take it, Suman.

1470
01:37:48,647 --> 01:37:49,807
You shouldn't refuse.

1471
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,985
Thank you.
- How old are you?

1472
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:58,248
Sorry...

1473
01:37:58,323 --> 01:37:59,415
I know it's not right to ask.

1474
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:01,186
Well, she has come of age, Saheb.

1475
01:38:01,259 --> 01:38:04,057
In that case, aren't you
thinking about her marriage?

1476
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:06,128
With your blessings...

1477
01:38:06,531 --> 01:38:08,556
why should I worry about it?

1478
01:38:10,569 --> 01:38:11,866
Babloo...

1479
01:38:12,003 --> 01:38:13,470
for how long will
you wander all alone?

1480
01:38:13,738 --> 01:38:14,966
You should marry Suman.

1481
01:38:15,073 --> 01:38:17,007
You won't find a girl as nice as her.

1482
01:38:17,075 --> 01:38:18,201
Sir, but I...

1483
01:38:18,276 --> 01:38:20,005
Listen, both of you are educated...

1484
01:38:20,178 --> 01:38:21,975
and you will get a
good job in the city.

1485
01:38:22,047 --> 01:38:24,174
Do you intend wasting
your youth in this village?

1486
01:38:24,449 --> 01:38:25,780
Kanhaiya, do you have any objection?

1487
01:38:25,851 --> 01:38:26,977
You...

1488
01:38:27,219 --> 01:38:29,119
could get her
married to a rock, Saheb.

1489
01:38:29,454 --> 01:38:30,614
Sir...

1490
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:32,748
but...

1491
01:38:32,858 --> 01:38:34,120
I am...
- Suman

1492
01:38:34,559 --> 01:38:35,856
do you have any objection?

1493
01:38:44,736 --> 01:38:45,930
Hello Babloo...

1494
01:38:52,043 --> 01:38:53,101
Babloo...

1495
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:55,245
the petrol pump guy
refused to give petrol.

1496
01:38:55,413 --> 01:38:57,210
He said I should get
a note from Kanhaiya.

1497
01:38:57,415 --> 01:38:59,076
I was insulted.

1498
01:39:02,154 --> 01:39:03,621
Hello Babloo...

1499
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:08,856
Will you inform him that I am here.

1500
01:39:09,327 --> 01:39:10,692
Saheb should be here soon.

1501
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:13,627
It's my daughter's
wedding invitation.

1502
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:21,502
Mr. And Mrs. Aditya Pratap Singh?

1503
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:26,338
You haven't invited me?

1504
01:39:26,611 --> 01:39:29,375
I will organise a grand
party for all of you later.

1505
01:39:29,981 --> 01:39:31,243
But why later?

1506
01:39:32,584 --> 01:39:34,711
You don't think I'm worthy
of attending the wedding?

1507
01:39:35,187 --> 01:39:36,518
It's not like that.

1508
01:39:36,621 --> 01:39:37,713
Then what is it?

1509
01:39:38,023 --> 01:39:39,888
I'm the customer service guy.

1510
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:42,456
Can't get through
Saheb so I should call him!

1511
01:39:43,762 --> 01:39:45,730
Don't you talk to me like that!

1512
01:39:46,398 --> 01:39:48,559
Is Saheb angry?

1513
01:39:49,701 --> 01:39:52,329
No, not Saheb, I am angry at you.

1514
01:39:52,404 --> 01:39:54,998
What I can't be angry
at you, you bastard?

1515
01:39:55,106 --> 01:39:56,539
I can't be angry?
- Hey...

1516
01:39:56,608 --> 01:39:57,905
what's going on?
- Who do you think you are?

1517
01:39:57,976 --> 01:39:59,409
Babloo...

1518
01:39:59,611 --> 01:40:00,737
what happened?

1519
01:40:01,413 --> 01:40:03,005
He was insulting Saheb
and I couldn't bear it.

1520
01:40:03,114 --> 01:40:05,048
What?
- I was insulting Saheb?

1521
01:40:06,651 --> 01:40:08,642
Kanhaiya... that's an absolute lie.

1522
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,050
I came here with my
daughter's wedding invitation.

1523
01:40:10,121 --> 01:40:11,213
Please come inside.

1524
01:40:13,892 --> 01:40:15,052
Saheb will return at night...

1525
01:40:15,126 --> 01:40:16,388
he is at a nearby village.

1526
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:25,061
Listen!

1527
01:40:27,205 --> 01:40:28,365
Listen!

1528
01:40:29,307 --> 01:40:31,241
Come down, I want to speak with you.

1529
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:35,378
Come down right now, I
have to speak with you.

1530
01:40:51,596 --> 01:40:52,756
What the hell is going on?

1531
01:40:53,498 --> 01:40:54,590
You got Saheb back and...

1532
01:40:54,699 --> 01:40:56,326
you are getting me married
to Suman and sending me away.

1533
01:40:58,937 --> 01:41:00,962
Everything I did, I did it for you.

1534
01:41:01,506 --> 01:41:03,064
This way it's better for you.

1535
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:04,968
You get to be with both.

1536
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:06,636
I want you!

1537
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,076
Take it there.

1538
01:41:14,419 --> 01:41:15,545
Now!

1539
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,721
You were fooling around with me!

1540
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:30,760
I know you are behind
this plan to send me away.

1541
01:41:31,603 --> 01:41:33,901
How could you even say that?

1542
01:41:34,572 --> 01:41:36,267
And what's wrong with it?

1543
01:41:36,808 --> 01:41:38,400
It's good for everyone.

1544
01:41:38,476 --> 01:41:41,070
You will get a job in the city.

1545
01:41:41,346 --> 01:41:43,974
We have been meeting clandestinely...

1546
01:41:44,049 --> 01:41:45,107
and we will continue to do so.

1547
01:41:45,216 --> 01:41:47,184
I don't want to continue like that.

1548
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,150
And nor do I want to work somewhere.

1549
01:41:50,322 --> 01:41:51,755
I will stay here...

1550
01:41:51,956 --> 01:41:53,446
and you will stay with me.

1551
01:41:53,758 --> 01:41:55,123
Not as Madam...

1552
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,657
but as the Queen.

1553
01:41:58,697 --> 01:41:59,823
As for Saheb...

1554
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,490
I will get rid of him.

1555
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,332
What do you mean?

1556
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:07,334
You will kill him?

1557
01:42:07,639 --> 01:42:11,575
If you wish, he will breathe
his last begging at your feet.

1558
01:42:11,743 --> 01:42:12,971
Babloo...

1559
01:42:14,612 --> 01:42:16,102
Babloo...

1560
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:20,784
our affair is confined to a room...

1561
01:42:21,619 --> 01:42:24,986
and it's no more than a bed.

1562
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:27,854
Please let it be.

1563
01:42:28,927 --> 01:42:30,053
You are scared.

1564
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:34,496
I will change everything in two days.

1565
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,666
Saheb...

1566
01:42:43,775 --> 01:42:45,333
we belong to four villages and...

1567
01:42:45,443 --> 01:42:47,240
we are here because
we are in trouble.

1568
01:42:47,345 --> 01:42:49,404
There is a man-eating
leopard in the jungle.

1569
01:42:49,481 --> 01:42:51,676
He has already killed five of us.

1570
01:42:51,783 --> 01:42:53,614
Complain to the forest department.

1571
01:42:53,685 --> 01:42:55,312
Sir, we are from the
forest department.

1572
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:58,184
We neither have the means nor
weapons to kill the leopard.

1573
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:00,588
We have requested for weapons
but don't know when we'll get them.

1574
01:43:00,658 --> 01:43:03,149
Until then he could
kill some more of us.

1575
01:43:03,294 --> 01:43:05,785
Yes, he will kill us!

1576
01:43:05,864 --> 01:43:07,729
Please kill the leopard.

1577
01:43:08,199 --> 01:43:09,860
We will be grateful to you.

1578
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,492
As you wish.

1579
01:43:11,703 --> 01:43:13,500
Day after tomorrow I
will camp out in the jungle.

1580
01:43:13,571 --> 01:43:16,335
Keep track of where the
leopard was last seen.

1581
01:43:40,565 --> 01:43:41,691
What is this?

1582
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,358
What?

1583
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:45,459
I told you to come alone.

1584
01:43:45,537 --> 01:43:47,129
And are you all alone?

1585
01:43:48,373 --> 01:43:50,102
As much as you fear me...

1586
01:43:50,742 --> 01:43:52,767
I fear you just the same.

1587
01:43:53,778 --> 01:43:54,972
What...

1588
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,638
what do you want?

1589
01:43:56,948 --> 01:43:58,779
I want to talk to him alone.

1590
01:43:58,850 --> 01:43:59,942
No, sir.

1591
01:44:00,018 --> 01:44:02,043
I can't leave you
alone with him. Hey!

1592
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:04,644
Just say what you want to,
we don't have time to waste.

1593
01:44:04,756 --> 01:44:06,280
Lower your voice.

1594
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:08,258
You see my thugs outside?

1595
01:44:08,393 --> 01:44:10,884
A loud voice is like a
danger signal to them.

1596
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:14,792
I hope that our friendly
conversation isn't disturbed.

1597
01:44:14,866 --> 01:44:16,026
Hey!

1598
01:44:16,301 --> 01:44:17,461
Just a second!

1599
01:44:17,769 --> 01:44:18,861
You... out of the car...

1600
01:44:18,937 --> 01:44:20,302
I said out!

1601
01:44:20,572 --> 01:44:22,369
Come on... now!

1602
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:28,340
Release Gainda Singh's
brother who is in prison.

1603
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,140
Gainda Singh's brother? But why?

1604
01:44:34,185 --> 01:44:36,881
I am sure he is dying to kill Saheb.

1605
01:44:37,589 --> 01:44:39,386
He is a student, a decent guy.

1606
01:44:39,457 --> 01:44:42,017
It was because of you guys
that I had him locked up.

1607
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:46,093
Saheb is contesting elections again.

1608
01:44:46,464 --> 01:44:49,524
And he will defeat you
because he has enough funding.

1609
01:44:49,934 --> 01:44:53,062
Therefore I want you to release him.

1610
01:44:55,406 --> 01:44:57,169
When Saheb is killed...

1611
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:59,240
he will be the prime suspect.

1612
01:44:59,677 --> 01:45:01,577
You can lock him up again...

1613
01:45:01,746 --> 01:45:03,077
and you are secure.

1614
01:45:04,983 --> 01:45:06,075
What about you?

1615
01:45:06,317 --> 01:45:07,443
Me?

1616
01:45:08,486 --> 01:45:10,454
I will be the new Saheb.

1617
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:33,236
Rukma!

1618
01:45:40,618 --> 01:45:41,744
Saheb...

1619
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,650
before you come in,
I want to confess something.

1620
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:46,784
You see...

1621
01:45:47,492 --> 01:45:50,120
it's about Babloo.

1622
01:45:51,629 --> 01:45:54,826
He has mistaken the way
I speak and my behavior...

1623
01:45:55,133 --> 01:45:56,794
to mean something else.

1624
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:58,360
He says...

1625
01:45:58,536 --> 01:45:59,867
he is in love with me.

1626
01:46:00,004 --> 01:46:01,096
Please...

1627
01:46:01,172 --> 01:46:02,571
please make him go away from here.

1628
01:46:02,674 --> 01:46:04,369
He has over stepped his limits.

1629
01:46:06,811 --> 01:46:08,938
Please don't be upset with me.

1630
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:11,207
It's not my fault.

1631
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:12,981
Please, Saheb.

1632
01:46:47,619 --> 01:46:51,578
My thirst knows no bounds, O King!

1633
01:46:51,689 --> 01:46:53,452
Dig a well for me

1634
01:46:53,524 --> 01:46:54,752
Dig a well for me

1635
01:46:54,859 --> 01:46:58,522
My thirst knows no bounds, O King!

1636
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:00,291
Dig a well for me

1637
01:47:00,365 --> 01:47:05,359
And if a well you can't dig
I suggest You set up a tap for me

1638
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:06,595
Whatever you do...

1639
01:47:06,704 --> 01:47:08,137
don't shoot at his chest.

1640
01:47:08,406 --> 01:47:10,601
He wears a bullet-proof vest.
- Okay.

1641
01:47:10,875 --> 01:47:12,001
Now...

1642
01:47:12,076 --> 01:47:13,373
move it!
- Okay. - Take care.

1643
01:47:13,444 --> 01:47:15,036
And if water
doesn't flow from the tap

1644
01:47:15,146 --> 01:47:18,274
I suggest, you bring me the rains

1645
01:47:18,383 --> 01:47:20,681
Bring the rains.
- Sing it

1646
01:47:20,785 --> 01:47:23,686
I love to love you baby

1647
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,314
I love to love you baby

1648
01:47:27,425 --> 01:47:31,054
I love to love you baby

1649
01:47:31,462 --> 01:47:34,522
I love to love you baby

1650
01:47:34,599 --> 01:47:36,692
I hope you aren't upset with me.

1651
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,293
Upset about what?

1652
01:47:38,603 --> 01:47:40,161
About last night.

1653
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:42,836
The thing I told you about Babloo.

1654
01:47:43,241 --> 01:47:44,572
What are you talking about?

1655
01:47:45,243 --> 01:47:46,972
You told me nothing.

1656
01:47:47,512 --> 01:47:49,480
I hope you are taking
your medicines regularly.

1657
01:47:49,847 --> 01:47:55,342
Bring me such rains that

1658
01:47:56,854 --> 01:48:00,312
Bring me such rains that

1659
01:48:00,425 --> 01:48:03,053
Will last twelve months

1660
01:48:04,629 --> 01:48:07,826
Let the world get wet in those rains

1661
01:48:07,899 --> 01:48:09,457
Make sure some
thirst is left for later

1662
01:48:09,534 --> 01:48:11,331
Make sure some
thirst is left for later

1663
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:16,066
Some thirst is left for later

1664
01:48:17,875 --> 01:48:19,536
Who was at the door the night before?

1665
01:48:23,981 --> 01:48:27,109
I love to love you baby

1666
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:30,620
Please don't be upset with me.

1667
01:48:31,055 --> 01:48:32,955
It's not my fault.

1668
01:48:33,458 --> 01:48:34,891
Please, Saheb.

1669
01:48:37,195 --> 01:48:42,599
Hey beautiful girl Your
lover is quite a flirt

1670
01:48:42,967 --> 01:48:47,961
Hey beautiful girl Your
lover is quite a flirt

1671
01:48:48,339 --> 01:48:51,831
What brought you two together

1672
01:48:51,909 --> 01:48:55,709
O Lord, how did they end up together

1673
01:49:06,491 --> 01:49:10,052
My demand is pretty small

1674
01:49:10,128 --> 01:49:11,857
You can fulfill it

1675
01:49:11,929 --> 01:49:13,328
You can fulfill it

1676
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:17,294
My demand is pretty small

1677
01:49:17,368 --> 01:49:18,960
You can fulfill it

1678
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:22,870
If you don't fulfill it,
I will curse you

1679
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,567
Find a lover for me

1680
01:49:24,642 --> 01:49:26,371
Find a lover for me

1681
01:49:26,544 --> 01:49:31,379
If you can't find

me a lover I suggest

1683
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,845

Greetings!

1686
01:50:04,215 --> 01:50:05,580
Greetings!

1687
01:50:05,683 --> 01:50:06,980
The leopard has been sighted.

1688
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:09,619
About four kilometers
from here at Sitapur.

1689
01:50:10,655 --> 01:50:12,486
Go ahead, I'll have my
breakfast and join you.

1690
01:50:12,657 --> 01:50:13,851
Alright, sir.

1691
01:50:17,161 --> 01:50:18,423
Morning, sir.

1692
01:50:36,247 --> 01:50:38,044
I also want to come
with you to the jungle.

1693
01:50:38,683 --> 01:50:40,617
In the jungle you need to walk...

1694
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:42,608
and you're not used to walking.

1695
01:50:43,688 --> 01:50:45,280
I'll be back in the evening.

1696
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:48,818
I need to speak with you.

1697
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,359
I have to tell you something.

1698
01:51:40,011 --> 01:51:41,569
Saheb!

1699
01:52:28,726 --> 01:52:29,886
Father!

1700
01:52:43,741 --> 01:52:45,572
Enough of your services...

1701
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:47,277
time to take some rest.

1702
01:52:50,214 --> 01:52:51,306
Father!

1703
01:52:54,919 --> 01:52:56,944
You better not insult me today.

1704
01:52:57,655 --> 01:52:59,020
If I feel offended...

1705
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,990
I may do something wrong.

1706
01:53:05,596 --> 01:53:07,996
What did you do?

1707
01:53:08,432 --> 01:53:10,127
Everyone will cry for a few days...

1708
01:53:10,234 --> 01:53:11,565
and then things will
be back to normal.

1709
01:53:11,736 --> 01:53:13,135
Enough of bowing to someone.

1710
01:53:13,304 --> 01:53:16,796
Now you will see others bow, uncle.

1711
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:19,907
Where are you going?

1712
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:24,639
I told you, I would
change everything in two days.

1713
01:53:25,349 --> 01:53:26,577
My queen...

1714
01:53:28,285 --> 01:53:29,445
I love you.

1715
01:53:32,289 --> 01:53:34,587
Only I truly love you.

1716
01:53:37,328 --> 01:53:40,297
You made me run around in
circles in your quest to be with him.

1717
01:53:42,833 --> 01:53:44,528
I will forget everything.

1718
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:47,530
Everything.

1719
01:53:48,172 --> 01:53:50,606
Let's go.

1720
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:03,981
Madhavi...

1721
01:54:11,228 --> 01:54:12,490
I told you...

1722
01:54:13,197 --> 01:54:15,131
I told you our affair
was confined to a room...

1723
01:54:15,232 --> 01:54:17,097
and was no more than a bed.

1724
01:54:17,868 --> 01:54:19,358
You will become the Saheb?

1725
01:54:19,537 --> 01:54:21,505
You don't look good giving orders.

1726
01:54:21,906 --> 01:54:23,373
If I were to stay with you...

1727
01:54:23,474 --> 01:54:25,942
people would pity
me and ridicule you.

1728
01:54:29,713 --> 01:54:30,805
Saheb!

1729
01:54:50,601 --> 01:54:54,697
King Aditya Pratap Singh... forever!

1730
01:54:54,872 --> 01:54:57,238
King Aditya Pratap Singh... forever!

1731
01:54:57,675 --> 01:54:59,336
Long live the queen!

1732
01:54:59,410 --> 01:55:01,469
Try to lift your hands higher.

1733
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:03,670
They will think
you're getting better.

1734
01:55:05,483 --> 01:55:09,681
Thank you for your support,
and making us win the elections.

1735
01:55:23,067 --> 01:55:24,591
Who is he?

1736
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:26,359
My new chauffeur.
