1
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,760
Eat this please!

2
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,640
Get up please!

3
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
Eat this!

4
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,160
Please eat!

5
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
Please stand up!

6
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
Take! Eat this!

7
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,640
My grandpa used to always say..

8
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,440
That life and death is the
rule of the nature!

9
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,200
And everyone needs to keep
taking birth again and again!

10
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,240
So that he could bring joy
to the lifes of others!

11
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,400
So taking forward his legacy!

12
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,520
Let us not waste a moment
to celebrate life!

13
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,440
DJ Jango, Lets play.

14
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,760
Bye..bye..Jango!

15
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,720
Sir, I've checked your card!

16
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
It is blocked!

17
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,000
Your grandpa died in
the noon and how..

18
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,640
..dare you attend
a party at night?

19
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
Don't you have any shame?

20
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Listen!
You keep cool here! Let me talk!

21
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,440
I'm present here!
I will talk! -Do you understand?

22
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,160
Oh! Hi! Sorry to keep you
waiting here Mr. Karan!

23
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
How dare you?

24
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,960
How could you dare
to block my card?

25
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
Do you know how embarrassing
that was?

26
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,280
I had to call uncle at
midnight for money!

27
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,280
I am sorry...!
-....about the loss!

28
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,440
Your gradfather Mr. Purohit
was a gem of a person!

29
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I know...!

30
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,480
Yes..tell me..where
are the papers?

31
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,440
Where am I supposed to sign?

32
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
Let us finish the formalities!

33
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,280
And listen to one more thing!

34
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
My grandfather has passed away
and you are also being fired!

35
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
What?
-Give me the money and get lost!

36
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
Keep calm! Am I not there?

37
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,080
I will talk! Keep cool!

38
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,920
There is one more bad news
for you Mr. Karan!

39
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,320
Your grandfather..Mr. Harkishan
Purohit!

40
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,760
Has not left anything in his
Will for his grandson!

41
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,800
Is this some kind of a joke?

42
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
What do you mean?

43
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,600
What she means is that...!

44
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,040
Your grandfather has donated
all the property..

45
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
..wealth and money!

46
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
What?

47
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,880
Impossible!

48
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,240
My grandfather won't do
anything like this!

49
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,880
Why don't you say something?

50
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
You were his manager for
bloody thirty years!

51
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,920
I am sorry! Mr. Mehta is
no longer his manager!

52
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
What?

53
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,720
Yes Mr. Mehta! -Mr. Purohit has
donated all his property..

54
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
..from India and all his
accounts in USA funds, bonds..

55
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,440
..equity funds and policies as
well as off shore investments!

56
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,000
He has donated everyting
in charity!

57
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Oh yes!

58
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,000
There are twelve motels!

59
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,000
He has appointed you as manager
for those motels!

60
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,560
Good..good! Thank god!

61
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,000
This is some kind of a game
you are playing with me!

62
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,800
My grandfather must not have
done anything like this!

63
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,040
This is your own fraud!

64
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
More than me it is
you who must be..

65
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,960
..knowing your own grandfather!

66
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,560
Do you think your grandfather
can't cannot..

67
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,760
..do anything
like this with you?

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,880
Bloody old man has died
but he's harassing..

69
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,320
..me even after his death!

70
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
Hello...just a minute!

71
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,160
Where are you going?

72
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,040
I will go to meet another lawyer
and get this Will checked!

73
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,840
That's up to you!

74
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,800
But don't go to home!

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,040
Why the court has already sealed
your home today morning.

76
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,640
What? What the hell is this?

77
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
And one minute!

78
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
Give me your car keys please!

79
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,920
Okay! Take this! -No, manager!
I want the keys of his car!

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,040
Yes..these are
his car keys only!

81
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,000
What the hell you are giving
keys of my car for?

82
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,880
What am I supposed to do and
where am I supposed to go?

83
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Why are you not saying anyting?

84
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,880
I'll talk only when you'll
let me say anything man!

85
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
By the way Mr. Lawyer!

86
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,520
Has Mr. Purohit beqeathed
something at..

87
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,800
..least in his Will
for his grandson?

88
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Oh yes! There is...!

89
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Please sit down!

90
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,160
Yah! My parents?

91
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,280
Something must be
written in his..

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,760
..will about my mother
and father?

93
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,320
Who are they and where are they?

94
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Something must be mentioned!
-Unfortunately..

95
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,680
..your grandpa has mentioned
only you as a family member.

96
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,480
No other information
is there about any..

97
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,320
..other family member
in this will!

98
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,600
Did you see that?

99
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,040
He always told that he would
disclose at an appropriate time!

100
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,080
Before the right time came
he has passed away!

101
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,680
If money is not bequeathed to me
then to whom has he given it?

102
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,360
There is one Ashram
located at the..

103
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,000
..bank of River Narmada
in Gujarat!

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
Your grandfather was a trustee
of that Ashram!

105
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,400
Your grandfather has
donated all..

106
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,200
..his wealth to
that Ashram only!

107
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
And if you want your share!

108
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,360
You'll have to go to the
trustees of that..

109
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,520
..Ashram and get their
signature..

110
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,880
..on this 'No Objection
Certificate'!

111
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
I have also been instructed that
all these funds should be..

112
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,240
..transferred into the Ashram's
bank after three months!

113
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,600
You mean to say for securing my
own rights and privileges..

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,440
..I must get a signature
of those..

115
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,040
..poor and beggars for the sake.

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
Yes Mr. Karan!

117
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,680
Because that is the only way!

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
But considering the reality..

119
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
..the position you are
occupying today...!

120
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,600
You are appearing to be a
real poor and a beggar!

121
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Because the money is with them!

122
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
Yes Savio? Listen to me bro!

123
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,760
Come outside I have
a gift for you.

124
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,400
Thirteen days it is..

125
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,000
If I don't get my money,.

126
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
The fourteenth day your
girlfriend will weep for you!

127
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
The foreigner has passed away!

128
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,240
His grandson, Karan, is coming
to the Ashram soon!

129
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,840
Hello uncle!

130
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,560
Listen Karan! Have you reached?

131
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,320
Yes, I have reached in India!

132
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,800
It's humid!
It is quite hot here!

133
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,040
Okay! -And thank you for
sponsoring my ticket!

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
But you haven't sent me the
details of my next flight as yet!

135
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,440
My son,
no flight goes to the place..

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
..where you will be going next!

137
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Then what?

138
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Uncle!

139
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm sorry to keep on
disturbing you but!

140
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,760
This is unbearable!

141
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
What?

142
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,800
At least you could have
found me a reservation!

143
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,480
Listen to me grandson!

144
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,280
In India, you can get admission
in a reservation..

145
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,920
..quota in a medical college..

146
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,280
..but not in train!

147
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,200
Just endure through
this journey!

148
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,320
I am doing the arrangements
for the..

149
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,240
..remaining part of your journey!
-Make it quick damn it! -What?

150
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,120
Uncle! Please! Make it
as soon as possible!

151
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,080
I hope you understand!

152
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,880
I am suffocating here!

153
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm feeling as if how
soon I get a sign..

154
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,000
..of those poor trustees
and I return!

155
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,920
You won't get a sign
in so much haste!

156
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,280
And yes..by the way!

157
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,360
Haven't you kept the
documents safe?

158
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,840
Yah! Yah! They are very
much safe in my pouch!

159
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,000
You fool!
Don't touch! It is not a toy!

160
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,840
Karan!
Have you kept the last remains..

161
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,800
..of grandpa safe
in your luggage?

162
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
Yes!
Those last remains are safe in..

163
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,960
..my bag and I
had to waste two..

164
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
..hours at the airport
security for that!

165
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,440
It's too heavy! -What?

166
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,680
Nothing!
-You go and sleep my dear!

167
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,800
What for are you interrupting?

168
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,640
When did I say anything
in between? -Okay!

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
Listen to me Karan!

170
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,200
One gentleman called
'Guptaji' will..

171
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,440
..come to receive you
at the station!

172
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,600
He will take you from
there to the ashram!

173
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,920
And at the ashram..? Who?

174
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,120
That lady....Supriya! -You will
meet 'Supriya Bharati' there!

175
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,280
She is the main administrator
there!

176
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,800
All these old characters
like 'Supriya..

177
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,120
..Bharati' and 'Gupta'
will bore me now!

178
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,200
It is the worst journey
of my life!

179
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Hello?

180
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,200
My son,
the worst is yet to come!

181
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,800
Nothing happens in Rs. 50/-!

182
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,200
Please come! This is your seat!

183
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,080
Please sleep comfortably!

184
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Thank you!

185
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,640
What will Rs. 500 achieve?

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,920
I want my three million dollars!

187
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,880
I want it at any cost!

188
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,720
Goddess Narmada please bless us!

189
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,000
Excuse me! Let me help you!

190
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Aunty..what is this
you are doing?

191
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,120
I am praying to Goddess Narmada
for the safety of my nephews!

192
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,960
River safeguards anybody
or lets us sink..

193
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,640
..it entirely depends on one's
own belief, my son.

194
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,080
Victory to my mother Narmada.

195
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,720
Mother Reva Reva!
Your water is so pure!

196
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,240
Mother Reva Reva!
Your water is so pure!

197
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,680
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

198
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,840
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

199
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,280
Please wear clothes to the
dear Lord Krishna o dear!

200
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:07,080
Use the colours of flowers to
the ears of Lord Krishna!

201
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,040
To the dear Lord Krishna!

202
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:19,920
Please wear clothes to the
dear Lord Krishna o dear!

203
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,720
Please wear clothes to the
dear Lord Krishna o dear!

204
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,560
He steals the butter and
breaks the earthen pots!

205
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,320
He,
Lord Krishna, teases Radha also!

206
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,920
Purya, Where are you standing?

207
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,120
You will fall down!

208
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,040
You came here without
informing me at all!

209
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,080
Come.. Rambali is Calling you.

210
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,400
Yes! We have reached!

211
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,120
Come on! Come on! Get going!

212
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Hello? Where is the platform?

213
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Just a minute! Hello?

214
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,640
Let me take my bag!

215
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,680
My bag! My bag!

216
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,480
My bag! Where are you taking it?

217
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
You girl! Just stop!

218
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,600
Hey..wait..wait! My bag!

219
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,680
I don't want to go with you!

220
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,800
Guptaji is coming to
receive me here!

221
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,000
Hey you! Wait!

222
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,760
Why is it necessary to
take him with us?

223
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,040
What? Then where will he go?

224
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,960
He will die here sitting alone!

225
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,680
Tiger keeps coming here!

226
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,000
Your 'Gupta' is a rich person!
He'll come only in the morning!

227
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,600
How much luggage have
you brought?

228
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,160
Okay!
Even I will sit here with you!

229
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,280
Thank you! But no thank you!

230
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,960
Go!I say you go away!

231
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Hey!Take her!

232
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Come! Let us go!

233
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,240
There is a place called
'Muni Ka Dera' a..

234
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,800
..little ahead from here for you
to relax! -Go and sit there!

235
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,200
Okay!

236
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,720
Your Guptaji's car also will
come at that place only!

237
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,960
Okay!

238
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Only the ashes are
to be immersed!

239
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,360
Not the metal pot, isn't it?

240
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,720
Mother Goddess Reva!

241
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,360
Mother Goddess Reva!

242
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,960
Mother Goddess Reva!

243
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:34,160
Mother Goddess Reva!

244
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,280
God bless me! God bless me!

245
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,040
Are you Guptaji?
-God bless me! Quite right!

246
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,880
I apologise for being
little late!

247
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,720
I started after performing puja!

248
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Okay! No problem!
-I have brought some tea for you!

249
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,760
Hello? -I don't drink tea!

250
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
I don't drink tea!

251
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,360
Your grandpa, the foreigner,
was a great fond of tea!

252
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,560
Who? Foreigner?

253
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,560
Your grandfather! -Oh yah!

254
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,000
I felt really sad after
hearing about..

255
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,520
..the demise of
your grandfather!

256
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,840
May River Narmada offer
peace to his soul!

257
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
Yah! Yah! RIP! Shall we start?

258
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,560
What? -Shall we start from here?

259
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,640
Yes! Yes! We will start!

260
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,800
Mother Goddess Narmada bless me!

261
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,120
Is this River Narmada?

262
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,200
Of course it is Narmada only!
-But yesterday when I was in train..

263
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,920
..I saw Narmada during
my journey!

264
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
And River Narmada is
there so far also?

265
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,720
Everything here is River
Narmada only!

266
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,440
Mother Reva Reva!

267
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
Mother Reva!

268
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,920
Mother Reva!

269
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,760
Mother Reva O Mother Reva!

270
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Mother Reva!

271
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,840
Mother Reva!

272
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
Mother Reva O Mother Reva!

273
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,800
You flow so swiftly..

274
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,680
..with your pure water!

275
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,600
You flow so swiftly..

276
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
..with your pure water!

277
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,520
Blessed is the land O Narmada,.

278
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,200
We humans are also blessed.

279
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,440
Blessed is the land O Narmada,.

280
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,360
We humans are also blessed.

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,320
By the holy touch of your water.

282
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,960
Mother Reva!

283
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040
Mother Reva!

284
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,760
I have heard a lot
about River Ganga!

285
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,160
But it seems Narmada is also
a very big river here!

286
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,880
It must be originating from the
jungles here, isn't? -No, my dear!

287
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,520
It starts from a far off place!

288
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,920
It originates
from the mountains!

289
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,120
It originates from a place
called 'Amar Kantak' and..

290
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,560
..then merges into the ocean
after flowing for 800 miles!

291
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,080
You originate from 'Amar Kanth'!

292
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,560
You bring peace and prosperity!

293
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,120
You originate from 'Amar Kanth'!

294
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,200
You bring peace and prosperity!

295
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,320
You quench the thirst of our
civilisation since ages.

296
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,800
You quench the thirst of our
civilisation since ages.

297
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
You bless peace and properity!

298
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,600
Mother Reva!

299
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,040
Mother Reva!
-You have come at the right time!

300
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,840
Tomorrow 'Narmada Anniversary'
is there!

301
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,680
Tomorrow morning there
is a holy worship..

302
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,240
..of Narmada on the river bank!

303
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,240
So far your grandfather
performed the worship!

304
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,640
From now onward you do it!

305
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,360
Guptaji...not all this now!

306
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,040
I have important things to do!

307
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
And early morning
is not my time!

308
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,120
Let us meet tomorrow in the noon!
-What?

309
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Yah!

310
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,280
Here we have reached Timba-Tola!

311
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,720
From here a mountain route goes
to the ashram! We'll walk now!

312
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Come with me!

313
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
On foot?

314
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
Yes! On foot!

315
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,320
Are you sure dude?

316
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,720
What? -I mean...uncle!

317
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,120
Isn't there any other route
to reach up to the ashram!

318
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
If you can fly then do it!

319
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,080
So it is better that
you pray for..

320
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,040
..the Mother Narmada
and get going!

321
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,840
May Goddess Narmada bless us!

322
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,720
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

323
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,320
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

324
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,280
Blessed is the land O Narmada,.

325
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
We humans are also blessed.

326
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,200
Blessed is the land O Narmada,.

327
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,080
We humans are also blessed.

328
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,440
By the holy touch of your water.

329
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,200
Mother Reva!

330
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,960
Mother Reva!

331
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,560
No..I can't walk any more!

332
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
I am very exhausted now!

333
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,960
Just assume that we've reached!

334
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,640
Yes..of course!
-Do you see that point?

335
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,160
Where?

336
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,440
Where? -That point..

337
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,000
The ashram is located there?

338
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,040
After reaching there
the ashram will..

339
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,400
..come within the range
of our sight! -What?

340
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,640
Yes! Come..follow me!
-Just assume that we've reached!

341
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,360
Take care! Easy! Easy!

342
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
Hey see! Uncle Gupta has come!

343
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,720
Gupta uncle has come
with the guest!

344
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes! I've come with the guest!

345
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,960
Yes! Stop! Stop!

346
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,520
Take care..my son! Take care!

347
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
Finally!

348
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,360
Give me the bag! -No!

349
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,040
What? -Rupees five hundred?

350
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,640
I got rupees five hundred!

351
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,400
Go man go! God bless you!

352
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,840
Come! Come please!

353
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
No..no..not all this just now!

354
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,760
But this is a holy gesture
to welcome a guest my son!

355
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,120
Not now please! -Guptaji!

356
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Okay...okay.. As you please!

357
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,360
Sister Kamala,
you do the rites later!

358
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,720
You can go now!

359
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,800
And this is your room, my son!

360
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,040
You have a wash first and then
we will have our food soon!

361
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
No!

362
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
I am not going to stay here!

363
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
What is this?

364
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,920
I won't stay here!

365
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,360
The foreigner used
to stay here only!

366
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,160
Yah! But I am
not my grandfather!

367
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,360
You arrange for
some other place!

368
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,280
Is there any hotel nearby? -It's
okay even if it may be a 3-star!

369
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,160
Look at his whims and fancies!

370
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,920
This is an ashram and not a
shelter home for pilgrims!

371
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,160
You come at any time and then
you cause so much trouble?

372
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,080
Tell me that you'll come
in time from tomorrow?

373
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,200
Yes!
I'll come in time from tomorrow!

374
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,560
You won't trouble Kamala ma'am!
-I will trouble her!

375
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,280
What?
-If she shouts at everybody..

376
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,760
..then even I will do the same!

377
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,480
You scoundrel! Wait!

378
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,960
Come! Meet your guest!

379
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,960
She is 'Supriya'?

380
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Namaste!

381
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,160
Hey...Hi!

382
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,160
I mean...Namaste!

383
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,600
Hi! -Actually, I was busy
in tomorrow's program..

384
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,120
..so I got late to come here!

385
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,880
Gupta-uncle,
did you show him the room?

386
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,200
He is refusing to stay there!
-It is not acceptable to him!

387
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,360
We'll have to arrange for
some other accommodation!

388
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
Oh..no..no! It's not like that!

389
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
When did I refuse Guptaji?

390
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh God? -I wanted to say
that this room should..

391
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,240
..be preserved in memory
of my grandpa!

392
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
But it's okay!

393
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,960
It's fine! -I'll stay here!

394
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,920
I will stay here only, Guptaji!

395
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,000
Great! So you become fresh!

396
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,920
Okay! -Eat some food and relax!

397
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,640
I have some work! -I will finish
that and then meet you!

398
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,440
Ah! By the way...! -Please set
up an alarm of 5 AM tomorrow..

399
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,440
..for a function to attend!
-He has already refused!

400
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,160
When did I refuse Guptaji?

401
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,160
I thought that the
program is today!

402
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Okay.

403
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,080
Tomorrow..I don't mind!

404
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I'll come!

405
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,600
I will surely come Guptaji!

406
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,240
I'll join you tomorrow!

407
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,280
You will enjoy the program!

408
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,360
The grandpa never missed it!

409
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,680
Supriya...come quickly!

410
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,520
Yes! I am coming!
-Okay! I will meet you later!

411
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,840
In this ashram...!

412
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,400
Supriya..listen!

413
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
I have ordered for
everything that..

414
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,520
..you need in tomorrow's
function!

415
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,760
I'll enjoy!
I will enjoy here a lot!

416
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay! I'll go!

417
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,040
No! I won't spare you!
I'll beat you!

418
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,240
Leave her please!

419
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,880
Leave her! Come!

420
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,160
Rambali has beaten her!
This is a everyday trouble!

421
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,600
I keep telling her to go and
stay with her in-laws!

422
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,520
The dispute will end
then-and-there!

423
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,400
I did not do anything!

424
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,800
That boy was bent on
going to the river!

425
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,400
So I took him there!

426
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,440
Upon returning from there
Rambali started..

427
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,000
..shouting at me as 'Issueless'!

428
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,640
She was asking why did
I touch her son..

429
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,320
..without taking her
permission first!

430
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,760
She didn't even listen to me!

431
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
This is wrong!

432
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,480
Before beating you so much
she should have..

433
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,120
..at least heard your
side of story.

434
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,400
Rambali just needs an
excuse to hit me!

435
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,200
Her husband is a gentleman!

436
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,400
He looks after me like a sister!

437
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,320
But Rambali has a doubt in mind!

438
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,680
Okay! -She accuses me as
her husband's keep!

439
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,720
Because I don't have a
child and because..

440
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,400
..I don't stay at my Gharwala!

441
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,760
Gharwala?

442
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Yes!

443
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,280
Gharwala?

444
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,640
My Dhani!

445
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
My Dhani. -Husband! -Dhani? Who?

446
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,120
I mean...my husband!
-Okay..okay..your husband!

447
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay..then why don't you
stay with your husband?

448
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,480
Go and stay with him!
What is the problem?

449
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,160
He is the root of the
whole problem!

450
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,400
The fault is in my husband only!

451
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,200
But everybody feels afraid
of telling him!

452
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,320
On the contrary..

453
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,760
..when husband calls me issueless,
everybody endorse him only!

454
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,000
Bloody feminine!

455
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,320
So it is better that I
stay without him only!

456
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,600
I don't want a child!

457
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,240
That boy. -Laddoo.

458
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,760
Is there with me!
I look upon him as my son only!

459
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,360
Okay! Forget all this! You come!

460
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
You come and show me all
of my grandpa's..

461
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,040
..prop..I mean the ashram!
-Come! Let us go!

462
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Come on..get up!

463
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,960
This is the school!

464
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
It is nice!

465
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,680
Is this a symbol made
by 'Saath-Sali'?

466
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Who?

467
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,880
Do you mean,
you recognise this symbol?

468
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,280
What? This is the local God
of the villagers here!

469
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,760
Is it?
Where will I meet 'Saath-Sali'?

470
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,680
Only the Bittu-Banga know that!

471
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,680
Yes! I had read this name!
I have shot a photograph!

472
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,320
Look at this photo!

473
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,640
Bittu-Banga's photo?

474
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,920
Oh damn it! My battery..

475
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,720
What? -No..nothing! -The network
doesn't reach here in the ashram!

476
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,640
Even that is known to
Bittu-Banga only!

477
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,000
This Bittu-banga seems to be
knowing everything here!

478
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,040
Are they any sage here or what?

479
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,320
What happened?
-Why are you laughing?

480
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,160
Oh hello? Why are you laughing?

481
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
Welcome to India Karan!

482
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,880
Hello Kamala Doshi! Come here!

483
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,080
Look..Supriya and Karan
also have arrived!

484
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,920
Welcome! Welcome!

485
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,480
Everything is ready here!

486
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Uncle..I will look after the
food preparations and come soon!

487
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,520
Hello Guptaji? How are you?

488
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm fine! Everything is ready!
-What is this?

489
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,400
Oh..what?

490
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Hey.. what?

491
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,760
What the hell? Leave me!

492
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,440
Hey you! Stay away!

493
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,880
He's asking you to stay away!

494
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,960
Did you meet them?

495
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Who?

496
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,160
Both of these men! -These men?

497
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,040
Yes! Of course! They
are 'Bittu-Banga'!

498
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,240
Our sages!

499
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,960
This is 'Bittu' and
this is 'Banga'!

500
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,880
Are these the 'Bittu-Bangas'?

501
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,040
Both of them are brothers only!

502
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,800
They belong to our ashram's
family only!

503
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,320
And this is our....

504
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,360
Brother Karan!
-I recognised him!

505
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Hi Banga!

506
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,320
My name is 'Bittu'!

507
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
Okay! He is 'Bittu'!

508
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,760
We call them 'Bittu-Banga' only!
It causes lot of confusion!

509
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,240
Yes!
They call us 'Bittu-Banga' only!

510
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Shall we begin the puja? -Yes..

511
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,680
Bittu-banga! You come with me!

512
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
And Bittu-Banga?

513
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,840
You go to the river bank with
the red saree stand!

514
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,800
Go! Get going about it!
-Go! Do it quickly!

515
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,280
Come on Karan! We'll go!

516
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,040
Okay!
Okay! Lift it and let us go!

517
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,000
Now you'll have to tell me
what is all this going on?

518
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,360
Today is 'Narmada-Anniversary'!

519
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,040
So for this holy purpose
there is a..

520
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,680
..worship function
scheduled here!

521
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,920
And a Saree will be worn to
the River Narmada now!

522
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
What?

523
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,640
A saree will worn to a river?
-Yes! -How?

524
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,040
You see it yourself!

525
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
My son!

526
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,160
So far your grandpa used
to perform the Abhishek.

527
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,440
The holy worship!

528
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,000
Now today onward you perform it!
-Take this!

529
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,000
May Mother Goddess
Narmada bless!

530
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,920
May Mother Goddess
Narmada bless!

531
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,080
You cleanse lakhs of sins
with your river body..

532
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,440
..which is beautifully decorated
by lakhs of swans.

533
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,960
In that holy place..

534
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,360
..you give both prosperity
as well as..

535
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,680
..liberation to the
humans and animals.

536
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,560
The presence of Brahma..

537
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,960
..Vishnu and Shankara
in your holy river..

538
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,080
..body provides the
protective shield.

539
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,240
O devi Narmada..

540
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,960
..I bow down to your lotus feet,
please give me your refuge.

541
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,200
You are the yoga of
all the yogis!

542
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,160
You are the meditation
of all the sages!

543
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,560
Your presence here today
is a sacred..

544
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,720
..blessing for the entire world!

545
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,960
Jumping and flowing
everywhere you..

546
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,840
..are always alert and awaken!

547
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:30,640
To seek you and to meet you
everybody worships you!

548
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:45,680
Namarda, Mekalsuta, Neeva
Induja, Shivatmaja, Reva!

549
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:59,960
Namarda, Mekalsuta, Neeva
Induja, Shivatmaja, Reva!

550
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,600
These are different names
of the River Narmada!

551
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,560
Bless us with water
and with life..

552
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,720
..we bow down to you
o mother Narmada.

553
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,080
I can't believe this!

554
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,720
These guys should
go to Olympics, man!

555
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Just a second!

556
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,040
Sure!

557
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Yes Mehta-uncle?

558
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,800
Karan, I've been trying to
call you since yesterday!

559
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,360
There is no network
in the ashram!

560
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,920
I have come to a near-by town!

561
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,680
Okay..okay! By the way!

562
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,280
Did you meet the trustees?

563
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,760
Ya.. Met the ones you mentioned
about.. -That Guptaji and Supriya!

564
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,080
And what about other trustees?

565
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Don't know yet!

566
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,000
How much time will it take
to meet all these people?

567
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,520
Guptaji seems to be a very
emotional type of a person!

568
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,120
I will win his confidence and
get the remaining information!

569
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,320
Okay! -I can't call you everyday
because I've to..

570
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,120
..walk out of the ashram
a lot for that!

571
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,680
I will keep recording
video clips..

572
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,480
..and keep sending them to you!

573
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,840
Take care! We'll talk later!

574
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
Hey! -Hi!

575
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,080
What's happening there?

576
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,680
What are these people doing?

577
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,080
Uncle's family members have
arrived to bid him a 'Bye' here!

578
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,920
Uncle is starting a
'Parikrama' today!

579
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,120
Parikrama means walk along river!
-What Parikrama?

580
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Narmada river's Parikrama!
Parikrama means walk along river!

581
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
Today they start walking
from here and they..

582
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,000
..aim to reach up to the river's
origin! -Walking?

583
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,840
Yes! -They will go up to the
confluence of river..

584
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,800
..Narmada with sea
and then return!

585
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,920
You mean these
people will walk..

586
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,920
..a distance of
2,600 kilometers?

587
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,000
And that too through
these jungles?

588
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,760
Yes! -Why?

589
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,160
I mean.. What will they achieve?

590
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Reva!

591
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,760
Meet Reva? -Yes!

592
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,640
Every pilgrim doing this leave
from here with a certain faith!

593
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
That during the whole
journey the river..

594
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,400
..Narmada herself will
protect them!

595
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,240
And keep meeting
them throughout!

596
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
And you believe in this?

597
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,840
I can't claim that I
don't believe it!

598
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
What a joke!

599
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,200
Are all these people going
for a 'Parikrama' today?

600
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Yes!

601
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Hey..hello sir?

602
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
Yes..you?

603
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,680
Mother Goddess Narmada bless us!
-Mother Goddess Narmada bless us!

604
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,040
Are you going for a Narmada
Parikrama?  . -Yes!

605
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,080
Doing it second-time!
-Take this Prasad. -pious food!

606
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,680
Take it in right hand!

607
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,120
I couldn't complete it first
time because of my job duties!

608
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,120
But this time I won't go back
without completing it now!

609
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,800
And you believe that during
this journey..

610
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,800
..the river will come
and say to you..

611
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,280
Hi dude! I am Narmada!

612
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,440
It won't say this actually!

613
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,600
But when she will meet
me I pray I don't..

614
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,600
..do a mistake in
recognising her!

615
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,520
Oh you Indians!

616
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,760
You romanticise everything
in life!

617
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,360
Hello..this is a river!

618
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
This is just a river!

619
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,800
Rivers are there everywhere
throughout the world!

620
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,560
In America also there are
Amazon and Mississippi..

621
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,680
..rivers and I
have seen people..

622
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,520
..doing lots of adventures
over the river there!

623
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,240
Scuba-diving and river-rafting
etc.!

624
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,480
But I never heard
that anyone has..

625
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,160
..seen River in a
human form there!

626
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,720
Well, if you do parikrama
of those rivers with..

627
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,120
..such a faith they may
also appear before you!

628
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,440
It seems this country has survived
on the basis of faith only!

629
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,840
And I am sorry I don't
believe in all this!

630
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,040
Do it to believe it!

631
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,360
If he walks back up to
the ashram its more than enough!

632
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,080
One more thing!

633
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,080
If you meet Reva then take a
selfie and show it to me! Okay?

634
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,600
God bless you! What's this?
-Mother Goddess Narmada bless us!

635
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,080
Mother Goddess Narmada bless us!
-Shall we go to eat food?

636
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,920
Coming to eat? -You please
continue! -I am not really hungry!

637
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,640
Mother Goddess
Narmada bless you!

638
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,360
What do you gain by
doing a parikrama?

639
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,400
I mean..it is waste time..waste
of energy!

640
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,280
If you don't believe in the
tradition of Parikrama..

641
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,480
..then no problem!

642
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,960
Whatever we like is
the ultimate truth!

643
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,240
No..my problem is that
how do you like..

644
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,720
..all this being so
educated and sane?

645
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,720
Oh..in that case..let
me tell you!

646
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,280
Experience and assumptions
are two different notions!

647
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,680
Experience and assumptions!

648
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,000
The faith that river
Narmada appears..

649
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,680
..in human form
is my experience!

650
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,160
And river Narmada does
not appear in..

651
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,680
..human form is
your assupmption!

652
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,960
Neither your argument nor
my faith has been..

653
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,680
..proven and hence can't
be falsified!

654
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,320
So I am respecting
your half truth..

655
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,840
..and you should respect mine!

656
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,400
Okay! You are right!

657
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,840
You should have eaten food there
on the river bank itself!

658
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,040
Don't you think the
hygine standard..

659
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,280
..in our ashram needs
to be improved?

660
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,000
I mean we should replace
the old..

661
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,600
..cook and bring
in some new guy?

662
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,680
One can always cook for
oneself in Ashram.

663
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,160
Ah..Bandu fakir!

664
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,080
Who? -Yes..Bandu fakir!

665
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,760
Hey you girl! Stop!

666
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,280
I am coming with you!

667
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Is he the guy?

668
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,840
We offer our respects please!

669
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,680
Namaste!

670
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,280
I will come with you and
eat rotis cooked by you!

671
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,760
Good! Let us go!
I'll myself cook them!

672
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Who is he?

673
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
He is a monk!

674
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,040
Nothing to worry! Let us go!

675
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,880
I will not allow you to proceed,
brother!

676
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,800
I won't at all allow
you to proceed!

677
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,000
You must eat something with me!
-Not now dear!

678
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
We will come some other time!

679
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,920
But I cannot let you go without
eating something at my home!

680
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,760
Okay!
Let us eat at your home today!

681
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,080
Hey you girl..will you come?

682
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,600
Okay! -My home has become a
place of pilgrimage today!

683
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
What the hell...!

684
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,080
My home has become a place
of pilgrimage today!

685
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,120
I won't let you proceed
without eating!

686
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,920
Will you just keep talking or
give us anything to eat?

687
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes...sure!

688
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,120
What happened?

689
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,280
There is nothing at home today!

690
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,680
But don't go without
eating anything!

691
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,400
That is a country liquor!
Isn't it? -Yes! Yes!

692
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,520
You will die without
eating food but..

693
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,800
..you won't give up
drinking liquor!

694
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,600
There is not even a grain
of food at home!

695
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,560
Do you have some salt?

696
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,360
I mean it...salt!

697
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,160
Yes! -Then get it!

698
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
Be quick!

699
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,080
What now?

700
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,080
May Mother Goddess
Narmada bless me!

701
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,320
Happy? -Yes!

702
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,280
What is there in this bag?
-Hello..first of all this is not a bag!

703
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
This is my energy bar!

704
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,200
Hey..hello..excuse me!

705
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,480
Boys..hey you boys!

706
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Come here quickly!

707
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Take this! -No...no!

708
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,520
A fakir is giving this! Take it!

709
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,280
Hello..but they don't want it!

710
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,680
Go..go! I bless you!

711
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Let us go!

712
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,960
What the hell? -Relax!

713
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,640
Unless you go to such
huts one doesn't..

714
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,320
..realise what is real
face of poverty!

715
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,720
Your grandpa really wished
that these poor..

716
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,760
..people must get
food twice a day!

717
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Okay!

718
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,800
Hey you girl?
Why am I coming with you
?

719
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,640
The food can be eaten at
ashram only! Isn't it?

720
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,480
Do you understand what I mean?

721
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,600
If I eat food at your
place today it will..

722
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,360
..mean that man left
us hungry today!

723
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,960
But you didn't eat anything!
-How can you say that?

724
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,160
I did eat whatever
that he offered!

725
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,520
You go now!
I have eaten my diet today!

726
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Go!

727
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,560
Will you go please?

728
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,080
People look upon me as a 'Fakir'
but I cannot deceive myself!

729
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
Go...I say!

730
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,520
He drank country liquor
on empty stomach!

731
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,680
His stomach will burn if
he doesn't eat anything!

732
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,080
Don't worry! Kalewali Maa will
feed him something for sure!

733
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,040
Mehta uncle!
I forgot to tell you!

734
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,400
It would be nice if you can
arrange a bike for me here!

735
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,680
I am being required
to walk a lot here!

736
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,160
And yes! -Before expecting
these people to sign..

737
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,880
..I wish to roam around with them
here! -I must understand them!

738
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,400
But understanding these people
is very difficult!

739
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,040
Understanding Bittu-Banga
is okay but an educated..

740
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,040
..girl like Supriya bows
before a fakir!

741
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,840
Bittu-Banga are uneducated
but they..

742
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,440
..have an engineer's
intelligence!

743
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,480
And how perfectly they
shoot an arrow!

744
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,240
Puriya is also an uneducated
girl but she sings so nice!

745
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,960
The poverty here is so
grim that people..

746
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,560
..here are even greedy
for eating!

747
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,400
I gave some of my chocolates
to a few hungry kids!

748
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,120
Their faces glowed with
so much joy that..

749
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,800
..I had never seen
such faces before!

750
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,880
You can feed a family
of five persons..

751
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,280
..for five days in just $10!
You know!

752
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,640
Eat this brother Karan!
Eat it..it is hot!

753
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,880
But I don't want
to eat just now!

754
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,000
Why?
You didn't eat in the noon also!

755
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,480
Supriya was telling me that!

756
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,200
She has cooked this herself!

757
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,760
Has Supriya cooked this? -Yes!

758
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,800
For my sake..? -Not for your
sake but for everybody!

759
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,040
Darn it! For everybody!

760
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,080
Hey you girl!

761
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,600
Karan will eat it himself!
You go to your home!

762
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,880
You will get late!
-But let him eat the food first!

763
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,360
Then I will go anyway! -Eat this
prasad. -the sacred food! -Okay!

764
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
Give me!

765
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,280
Oh hello?
-Does anyone eat prasad.

766
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,800
The sacred food on the palm
of a left hand at all?

767
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,560
You girl..is this any
right manner..

768
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,440
..of behaviour with a guest indeed?
-It's okay Guptaji! It's okay!

769
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,560
But what wrong did I do?

770
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,240
I was only teaching him the
right manner! -It's okay!

771
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,440
Karan, are you going
to pay for today's..

772
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,960
..function by cheque
only or by cash?

773
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,560
Why I have to pay for it?
-Your grandpa.

774
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,760
The foreigner only used to
sponsor every year till now!

775
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,800
Now it has become almost
like a tradition my son!

776
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,280
Okay! How much?

777
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,480
I mean..what's the amount?

778
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,880
Everything put together,
the amount is Rs. 1,28,000/-!

779
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,080
One lakh twenty eight thousand?

780
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,600
The food and puja was managed
at a cost of Rs. 28,000/-!

781
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,040
We donated a sari worth one lakh
to the mother River Narmada!

782
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,040
But I am not having
so much cash!

783
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,240
I am having only 20-25 thousand!

784
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,560
Nothing more is there with me!
-Oh god! This is a big problem!

785
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,280
There is no ATM also
located nearby!

786
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,960
No?
Oh yah! No ATM is there nearby!

787
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,160
Otherwise I would have paid
you the amount right away!

788
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,040
No..you don't worry!
We'll find some solution!

789
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,200
Let me leave for my home
at Dungarpur now!

790
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,040
I am supposed to come
early tomorrow!

791
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,240
Serve him the food!
Go on..go on!

792
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,160
No! You keep it! I'll eat
it! You go home now!

793
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,640
Hello..this Gupta keeps talking!

794
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,600
I won't go without
feeding Supriya!

795
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,720
Supriya has not eaten
food as yet? -No!

796
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Why?

797
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
I don't know! She was saying
that she won't eat food today!

798
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,240
But why?

799
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,160
Going by my experience I am
making an assumption..

800
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
..that you are not eating food..

801
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,280
..because a fakir has
not eaten food today!

802
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,880
No..There is nothing like that!

803
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,480
That is why you didn't eat food!

804
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,800
By the way I have brought
some sweet for you!

805
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,280
You can't say no!

806
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,120
It is a prasad. -a sacred food!

807
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,560
Thank you!

808
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,400
This is 'Mahabharata'! Right?
-Yes! Mahabharat!

809
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Oh yah!

810
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,600
Mahabharat!

811
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,280
Have you read it?
-No! Never got a chance!

812
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,720
But you must be knowing
something!

813
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,160
Yes! I know Bheem,
Arjun, Krishna etc.!

814
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,080
Do you know 'Draupadi's
Swayamwar'? -Yah! I know that!

815
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,920
Arjun had shot an arrow in the
eye of a fish above! Right?

816
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,320
Not bad!

817
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,520
Do you know 'Lakshagriha'?
Lakshagriha means home of wax!

818
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,160
Yah! Duryodhana had made a
conspiracy to kill the Pandawas!

819
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,800
House of Wax!
-'Vishwarup Darshan'?

820
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,000
Vishwarup Darshan' means view
of universe! -Yah! I know!

821
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,120
Nice! -'Bhishma's Pratidnya?'
Pratidnya means oath!

822
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Yah! -Geeta?

823
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,800
Yah! -Gandhari's Shraap?
'Shraap' means curse! -Yah!

824
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,160
Sudarshan Chakra'? Sudarshan
Chakra is Krishna's weapon! -Yah!

825
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,080
Eklavya? -Shakuni's pasa?
'Pasa' means dice!

826
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
Yes!

827
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,680
I never knew that
I know so much!

828
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,920
Exactly!
-Even I had felt the same!

829
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,360
When I sat down to read the
stories I haven't heard or read..

830
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,280
..even I felt that I..

831
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,560
..knew all these thing already!

832
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,720
Not only me but the people
of our country..

833
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,720
..must be knowing
all these things!

834
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,320
Whether it may be an
educated scholar..

835
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,200
..or even an uneducated
aborigine!

836
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,440
The noble work which you
are doing to educate..

837
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,640
..the rural aborigines is great!
-That's incredible!

838
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,360
I don't know whether
we have a right..

839
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,760
..to improve the aborigines..

840
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,000
But it is enough that
we can bring..

841
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,240
..some improvements
to their lives!

842
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,160
And a lot is yet to be done!

843
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,760
These people are forced
to go to the urban..

844
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,360
..areas for work except
in monsoon!

845
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,400
I wish to develop means
of employment..

846
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,880
..for them at this place only!

847
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,040
My father used to organise a
musical program every two years!

848
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,040
I wish to reinstate
this tradition!

849
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,600
May I ask you something?

850
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,120
Why did you choose this work?

851
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,040
It is hereditary!

852
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,800
My mother, father..

853
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,000
..Shastri-Uncle, Guptaji and
even your grandfather..!

854
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,400
I have seen all of them
offering service..

855
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,920
..here with a great faith
in their minds!

856
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,400
But it is not necessary
that every..

857
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,960
..case that faith need to exist!

858
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,680
According to me the upbringing
makes a big difference!

859
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,280
You have stayed in America
for so many years now!

860
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,320
Even after grandpa's death
you have come here!

861
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,360
Without any selfish motive!

862
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,920
Ah! Yah!

863
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,000
Without any selfish motive!

864
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,600
No! Not possible!

865
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,160
But why? -That work belongs
to the aborigines!

866
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,760
We won't do that!

867
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,480
You will get good income
through the work..

868
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,320
..by keeping it at home
for whole year!

869
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,560
Sir..you please come here!

870
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,880
Me?
-Yes..yes! Sir..you please come!

871
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,440
Please do come here!

872
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,480
Please tell them how they
can get more honey..

873
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,200
..safely at home instead
of jungle!

874
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,240
Please convince them about this!
-But what am I to tell them?

875
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,600
Even I will feel very
happy if Mr. Laxman..

876
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,960
..succeeds in what he
is pursuing for!

877
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,200
If you feel happy
about it I'll..

878
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,440
..try to say a
few words to them!

879
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,360
Hello friends..

880
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,080
..what this brother is telling
you really a piece of wisdom!

881
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,200
Everybody should
cultivate honey!

882
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,120
Cultivate?
-Say 'Ucher' means cultivate!

883
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,280
Okay! -You should cultivate
honey at home!

884
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,720
And thereby achieve
progress in life!

885
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,880
Good!

886
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,200
Jai Hind! -Thank you!

887
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,600
Where is Dityo?

888
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,920
The foreigner arrived
at ashram is asking..

889
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
..everybody to domesticate
honey gathering!

890
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,640
Is it?

891
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,680
A job nobody else except
me could do will..

892
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,640
..now be done by the
kids at home?

893
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,200
Come! Let us go and see!

894
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,520
Good morning Guptaji!

895
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,200
Welcome!
Welcome! Karan! Welcome!

896
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,440
Take this! I'm having only Rs.
20,000 with me just now!

897
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,080
Please keep this as
long as I arrange..

898
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,400
..for the remaining amount!
-I was in no hurry!

899
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,920
You could have given the
whole amount together!

900
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,120
No! No!
I won't let any work of the..

901
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,200
..ashram get hindered for money!

902
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,080
By the way what I wanted to say!

903
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,480
Now that I have come shall
we conduct a meeting..

904
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,720
..with the trustees
of the ashram?

905
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,000
So that I get to know
who does what?

906
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,280
Listen to me my son? -Yes! -You
have already met me and Supriya!

907
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,520
Yes! You are right! -Besides
from among the remaining you..

908
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,920
..met Bittu-Banga
also yesterday!

909
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,560
Bittu-Banga?

910
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,680
Are they also the trustees?

911
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,880
Yes!
Actually their mother 'Naradi'

912
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,600
Was a trustee here earlier!

913
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,440
But after her death
your grandfather..

914
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,800
..made both of
them the trustees!

915
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,120
Right! Right!
-Both of them are very smart!

916
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,000
Both look after farming..

917
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,760
..cows shelter and ration for
kitchen of the ashram very well.

918
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,120
Hmmmm! Okay! And who is this?

919
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,400
Ganesh Shastri?
-Ganesh Shastri? -Yes!

920
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,800
He is a very learned Pandit!
Very highly learned indeed!

921
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,240
He runs a medicine clinic
far away from here!

922
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,840
At a place called 'Kankavati'!

923
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,240
Okay! Do arrange my meeting
with him! -Sure!

924
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,640
And..yah..Maulana Ali Baksh?

925
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,920
Who is this? -The whole of the
jungle bows before his command!

926
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,520
Okay! But what does he do?

927
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,000
My son..even if we just
get his blessings..

928
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,760
..then also we're obliged!

929
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,680
Okay! -He is a fakir..

930
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,280
Okay! He is a fakir?

931
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
Yes!

932
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,720
Just a minute!

933
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,360
Maulana Ali Baksh means is
he that 'Bandu fakir'?

934
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,600
Yes! Exactly! That's him! -What?

935
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,360
Namaskar!

936
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,680
Yes..tell me?

937
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,440
I wanted to talk with
you regarding..

938
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,120
..the funds left by
your grandfather!

939
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,680
Yes! Yes! Of course! Please sit!

940
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,880
Please be seated!

941
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,840
Yah!

942
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,720
The point is thousands
of people begin the..

943
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,400
..journey of Narmada-Parikrama
every year!

944
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,120
Yah! Yah! -And it is said that
nobody who does the..

945
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,080
..Parikrama never sleeps
hungry at night!

946
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,240
Incredible!

947
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,440
Mother Reva delivers the
grains for food..

948
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,280
..in one or the other
manner to them!

949
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,400
Right...right!

950
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,560
And men like me always
feed those pilgrims..

951
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,280
..to remit our debt
to the Goddess!

952
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,480
Sada...what? -Serving food
for all the pilgrims!

953
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,640
Okay! Okay!

954
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,520
Your grandfather used
to donate Rs.

955
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,200
51,000 every year
for this cause!

956
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,120
How much would you
like to donate?

957
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,440
This old man has not given
me any property..

958
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,960
..but he's been donating freely!

959
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,400
Yes...tell me! -Look old man!

960
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,160
This is not a good time to talk!
Right?

961
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,800
Shall we talk some other time?
Okay?

962
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,920
Sir..whatever you can afford!

963
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,640
Listen to me loud and
clear old man?

964
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,720
I am not interested in
your fairy-tales..

965
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,760
..of this river appearing
in human form!

966
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,040
And if you don't have
money what's the..

967
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,880
..point in begging from
others too feed?

968
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,040
Sir..howsoever poor
a man may be..

969
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,080
..but he does feed
his own family!

970
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,000
I believe that the pilgrims
coming for..

971
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,280
..the Narmada-Parikrama
are my brethern!

972
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,880
Even your grandfather
believed the same!

973
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,840
My grandpa may be believing
this but I can't..

974
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,280
..spend money for anybody's
free diet!

975
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,880
Don't show me your depressing
face ever again!

976
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,920
Bittu-Banga..I need your sign!

977
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,080
Shhhhhh! Keep quiet! -What?
What happened?

978
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,960
Yes..tell me..brother Karan?

979
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,040
What happened?

980
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,680
Just a minute!

981
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,880
I came for this purpose!

982
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,360
What you are saying is right!

983
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,240
But all these are legal
formalities!

984
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,800
Yes? -What are we supposed
to do in all this work?

985
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,400
Okay! -We just follow what
Shastriji tells us!

986
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,120
But I mean this is my-I
mean this is..

987
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,920
..a work related with
ashram only.

988
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,600
Then do one thing first!

989
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,560
You talk with Shastri first!

990
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,800
Now what is all this?

991
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,920
Nothing..Now that grandpa
is not there it's..

992
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,560
..me who is looking
after all his work!

993
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,440
So this is a letter for
that permission!

994
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,240
That is anyway
you'll have to do!

995
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,800
What permission is
needed for that?

996
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,240
But everything needs
to be put on paper..

997
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,600
..for legal purposes! Isn't it?

998
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:22,760
It is for that purpose I need it!
-Okay! Okay!

999
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,120
But all this text is in English!

1000
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,280
What? -Listen to my son!
I don't know English!

1001
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,080
Besides, I don't understand
anything in legal matters!

1002
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,840
So you do one thing! -What?

1003
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,680
You go and talk with
Ganesh Shastri!

1004
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,600
I am always here for you!

1005
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,600
But when does Ganesh
Shastri come?

1006
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,880
He always comes in
Chaturmas season!

1007
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,600
Chaturmas means monsoon time!
-What...what..which mass?

1008
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,120
What...which mass?

1009
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,320
Hello..do you know anything
about what Guptaji spoke?

1010
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,440
Chatur? Chatter?

1011
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,200
Do you mean 'Chaturmas'?
-Yes! Quite right!

1012
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,000
Chaturmas? -What is the
meaning of Chaturmas?

1013
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,560
Chaturmas meaning...!

1014
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,800
It means four months!
-I see! Four months!

1015
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,520
But which four months?

1016
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,680
Chaturmas means which
four months?

1017
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,760
Hmmmmmm!

1018
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,920
You don't know!
Go away! -Hello! I know!

1019
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,160
It is the month in which
the pilgrims..

1020
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,360
..doing a parikrama come here!
-Then tell me quickly!

1021
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,960
But when do the pilgrims
doing a..

1022
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,160
..parikrama come here after all?
-Hmmmmmm!-.

1023
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
You go away boy!

1024
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,040
During the month of monsoon!

1025
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,880
But when does the monsoon
fall here?

1026
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,880
Wait! Wait! I'll tell you!

1027
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,480
I know that! I know that!

1028
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,480
I counted it! I know!

1029
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,320
Chaturmas begins after
fifteen days!

1030
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,160
Fifteen more days?

1031
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,480
In this country with mosquito
and humidity?

1032
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,560
Yes! Quite right!

1033
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,040
Girl, you forgot to calculate
the days of 'Adhik Mass'.

1034
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,360
The additional month also!

1035
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,280
What is the meaning of this
'Adhik Mass'? -Thirty more days!

1036
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,880
What? Forty-five days?

1037
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,560
The Adhik-Mahina.

1038
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,920
Additional month is coming
in between to be counted!

1039
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,280
What is this now?

1040
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,080
This is a machine
to wash clothes!

1041
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,840
If you can do all this
then please do..

1042
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,720
..something to get a
network in mobile!

1043
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,160
That network signal doesn't
reach here! -Then what?

1044
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,520
You need to go to a place
called 'Indra-Sidhi'

1045
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,480
To get mobile network!
-Inra-sidi.

1046
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,720
Inra-sidi.

1047
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,080
Inra yah! Whataver is that!

1048
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,680
How to go there?

1049
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,560
Go to the fig tree from
above the bank!

1050
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,360
Turn right and you
get another tree!

1051
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,120
Go straight from there
till next tree!

1052
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,640
Go twelve steps from
there and you..

1053
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,160
..get another
place 'Saat-Bandh'!

1054
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,480
Mountains begin from there!

1055
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,840
Climb the mountain
first to the top!

1056
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,760
Go walking stright from the top!

1057
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,400
Just a minute please..

1058
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,680
It's confusing! -The starting
point is from which tree?

1059
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,520
How far is remaining now?

1060
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,280
It is nearby only!

1061
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,120
What happened? -Banga?

1062
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,160
Mother Goddess is passing!

1063
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,520
Yes!

1064
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,320
It is the Mother Goddess only!

1065
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,840
Near the rocks she can be seen!

1066
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,240
Who is that?

1067
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,760
Is she any Goddess of yours?

1068
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,560
She is the Goddess
of everybody here!

1069
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,400
The whole of our jungle
bows before her!

1070
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,360
But about whom are
you guys talking?

1071
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,280
About Mother 'Kaale-waali'!

1072
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,640
Hey Bittu? -Yes? -Come! Let us
go and pay respects to her!

1073
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,680
Yes...sure! -Hello...no...no!

1074
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,600
First help me get a network
for my mobile!

1075
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,680
Then even I will come to pay
my respects to her with you!

1076
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,280
Mother doesn't meet anyone!
-She won't even talk!

1077
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,040
Yes! Quite right! -And till the
time she doesn't wish nobody..

1078
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,720
..except tribesmen
can meet her here!

1079
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,360
Do you understand that?

1080
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,240
Hey just a second!
Then how will you meet her?

1081
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,600
We are empowered to approach
the Mother Goddess any time!

1082
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,000
Because our mother has
spent her life..

1083
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,320
..in the service of
this mother only!

1084
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,160
We are a part of the
'Saath-Saali' tribe!

1085
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,600
All this knowledge of
worship has been..

1086
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,280
..taught to us by those
tribesmen only!

1087
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,480
It is they only who have
taught the art of..

1088
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,080
..drawing this picture
on your forearm!

1089
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,600
'Indra-Seedhi' is located
nearby only!

1090
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,760
You can go walking there easily!
-But...you see...!

1091
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,920
Hello...but which side
am I supposed to go?

1092
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,080
Just stick to this
direction only!

1093
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,560
This direction?

1094
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,200
Be quick! Get going!

1095
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,480
Bloody this direction!

1096
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,000
'Indra Seedhi'!

1097
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,800
Hello?

1098
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,120
Hello? Yah, uncle! -Finally!

1099
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,040
Yes..tell me!
-What are you saying?

1100
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,240
Uncle,
grandpa has crossed the limit!

1101
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,760
He hasn't left a penny
on my name but..

1102
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,640
..he has made
such guys trustees!

1103
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,480
Hearing that you will go mad!
-Karan..please calm down!

1104
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,560
Tell me exactly what
has happened?

1105
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,280
This Supriya and Guptaji
are okay but..

1106
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,160
He has made Bittu-Banga
as trustees!

1107
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,920
And Bandu fakir also!

1108
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
He is a fakir!

1109
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,400
You know a fakir! Who wears
the garb of a beggar here!

1110
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,440
If they learn that millions
of dollars are..

1111
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,200
..being transferred in
their account then..

1112
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,600
..they will die on the spot by
heart-attack! -Listen to me Karan!

1113
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,080
There is someone called
'Shastri' also!

1114
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,360
Who is he and where is he?
I don't know anything about it!

1115
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,160
But everybody is telling
me that if..

1116
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,680
..Shastriji signs we all will
follow! -Now you tell me what to do?

1117
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,920
Tell me what to do?

1118
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,880
Hello..
Be at ease! Don't get up!

1119
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,240
Don't stand up!

1120
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,720
It is Mother Narmada's
blessing that..

1121
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,760
..you didn't get hurt too much!

1122
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,760
You have been hit on the head
but you will get well soon!

1123
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,240
But there is light injury
on your foot..

1124
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,240
..in addition to some
swelling there!

1125
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,120
But after I apply this paste
everything will be fine soon!

1126
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,360
But where am I just now?

1127
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,360
You are in the laps
of Mother Narmada!

1128
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,480
Kaalewaali Mother
dropped you here!

1129
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,960
Kaalewaali Mother? -Yes! See!

1130
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,200
Assume that this your
home only and..

1131
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,200
..relax here comfortably! Okay?

1132
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,160
But..I was at 'Indra-Seedhi'!
Isn't it?

1133
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,640
Suddenly some goons came there
and I don't know why he hit me!

1134
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,080
That was Dityo!

1135
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,680
Who? -Dityo!

1136
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:51,080
Dityo? -Dityo collects
honey from the jungle!

1137
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,000
Okay! -He felt that you had come
to shut down his livelihood!

1138
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,840
What? -And he thought that
you were educating the..

1139
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,680
..people of ashram to domesticate
honeybees! -Oh no....not me!

1140
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,120
Yes..not you..Laxman!

1141
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,640
Yes..right! -Yes...I know that!

1142
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,560
Dityo had misunderstood
the matter That..

1143
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,080
..is why he ended
up hitting you!

1144
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,760
Oh! -But Bittu-Banga have
scolded him well!

1145
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,880
Shastri-uncle?

1146
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,800
Baldev..see who has come?

1147
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,920
Yes! I am coming!

1148
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
Is he Shastri?

1149
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,920
Om, May All become Happy,.

1150
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:30,320
May All be Free from Illness.

1151
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,960
May All See what is Auspicious,.

1152
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:40,880
May no one Suffer.

1153
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,720
Are you Shastri?
I mean Shastri-uncle!

1154
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,920
You need not use formal terms!
You can just call me 'Shastri'!

1155
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,960
Shastri-uncle! Shastri-uncle!

1156
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,600
Calm down!
Calm down! What happened?

1157
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,800
Shastri-uncle! My mother has
stopped eating food altogether!

1158
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,400
I don't understand what to do!

1159
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,040
She is too determined
not to eat!

1160
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,560
Your mother will live for ten
more years! You don't worry!

1161
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,520
But I'm bound to feel worried!

1162
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,960
She has not eaten anything
for last four days now!

1163
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,760
Now you only tell me
how can this go on?

1164
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,640
Yes! Yes! This is not proper..

1165
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,320
..she should eat! Right?

1166
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,920
Bhola! Tell your mother..

1167
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,640
..this is water from Narmada
given by me as blessing.

1168
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,200
Don't you disrespect it!

1169
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,520
Shastri-uncle..

1170
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,120
..if my mother gets well I
will take an oath for her!

1171
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,240
I will undertake a
Narmada-Parikrama!

1172
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,880
Okay! Good!

1173
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,240
Go and make her
drink this water!

1174
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,360
Go! Be quick!

1175
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,360
What? Bloody superstitious!

1176
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,120
Welcome! Welcome!

1177
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,960
God bless you!

1178
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,840
Good morning! -Good morning!

1179
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
Good morning!

1180
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,200
Hello..Guptaji?

1181
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,320
When did you come? -I heard you
had fallen down in river?

1182
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,040
Did you drink the country-liquor?
-What Guptaji?

1183
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,640
Are you alright now?

1184
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,680
Yah! I am..I am fine now!

1185
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,360
Did you withdraw
money from bank?

1186
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,480
I am asking about
the expense we..

1187
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,240
..incurred for the puja that day!
-Oh..It is causing pain!

1188
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,120
Talk about it later!

1189
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,560
Yes! It must be paining a lot!

1190
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,800
What were you saying?

1191
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,800
No..nothing! You relax now!

1192
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,000
Okay! Okay! -We'll talk about it
in the evening! -Okay! Okay!

1193
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,160
I will go to meet Shastri first!
-Okay!

1194
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,680
I have brought fruits for you!

1195
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,000
Yah! Please...!

1196
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,600
It is good that you came!

1197
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,880
I am feeling a lot weak now!

1198
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,120
Shastri-uncle has asked
you to take rest!

1199
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,640
You relax first!
You need to take rest!

1200
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,680
We will meet later!
-But....hello...?

1201
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,400
Oh no...please continue!

1202
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,400
I am sorry to disturb
you but I was..

1203
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,640
..searching for Supriya
and Guptaji!

1204
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,360
They have gone to take a holy
view of the Narmada river!

1205
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,120
They must be coming! -Okay!

1206
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,240
Shastri-uncle?

1207
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,200
Are you sure I need
not go to a doctor?

1208
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,880
I mean...my swelling has
not subsided as yet!

1209
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,640
If you can come here walking
on your own within..

1210
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,680
..a single day and
yet you ask this?

1211
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,480
Be frank and come to the point!
What do you want to know?

1212
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,400
Look! I am sorry to doubt
on your remedies but...!

1213
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,880
Using only the water
of River Narmada..

1214
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,120
..one can recover is...I mean!

1215
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,000
Oh yah! About Bhola?

1216
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,240
Ah...What?

1217
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,920
Ajwain and Rachko?

1218
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,640
Salary and Ulpha-ulpha for you!

1219
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,600
I added a few drops of
these extracts in..

1220
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,880
..the water I happened
to send to her!

1221
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,120
What it does is it repairs
the digestive system..

1222
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,720
..and helps trigger
hunger response..

1223
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,560
..in the patient and once
he starts eating..

1224
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,880
..the body starts working
automatically!

1225
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,640
Wow! That's great!

1226
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,560
You should have directly
given medicine!

1227
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,600
Why did you philosophise
reliogion in it?

1228
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,600
Because that lady can refuse
drinking medicine..

1229
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,000
..but not Narmada river's water!

1230
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,120
Karan, this country
has been surviving..

1231
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,680
..between two extremeties
for ages now!

1232
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,280
At one end there are
great learned men..

1233
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,560
..of a rich language
like Sanskrit..

1234
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,040
..and at other end there
are illiterate people..

1235
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,680
..also who call Indra
as 'Indrani'!

1236
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,000
That is why this system
of philosophising..

1237
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,720
..in terms of religion
has evolved here!

1238
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,960
These people toiling
whole day have no..

1239
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,200
..interest in scientific
explanations!

1240
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,880
They understand the language
of sins and..

1241
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,800
..blessings or sacred
and evil only!

1242
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,960
That might be!But I have
no faith in this religion etc.!

1243
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,200
That is not necessary either!

1244
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,000
It is okay if you don't
have faith in religion!

1245
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,200
Yes! But an individual
must have faith!

1246
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,680
This country has survived
on the basis..

1247
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,680
..of spirituality
and not religion!

1248
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,240
Our culture believes in
updating the religion..

1249
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,720
..with changing times in life!

1250
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,160
We are the one who have
faith in ultimate..

1251
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,760
..God and not in religion!

1252
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,520
Look..they have come!

1253
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,640
Yes..we have come! Good morning!

1254
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,120
I suggest Karan..you
also go to..

1255
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,040
..seek blessings of
Narmada river!

1256
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,600
No..there is no need to
go walking anywhere!

1257
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,680
You just need to take rest!

1258
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,800
Yah! Okay! Okay!

1259
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,000
Shastri-uncle?
-What happened now Bhola?

1260
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,080
My mother has started
eating food!

1261
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,280
It is a nice thing then!
What is it to worry about man?

1262
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,120
But now I will have to
undertake a parikrama!

1263
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,680
Oh yah! Right!

1264
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,840
What was that oath?

1265
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,240
He had a lot of faith
in taking oath!

1266
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,000
But don't worry Bhola!

1267
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,680
There must be some solution
in religion! Right Shastri?

1268
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,360
What if he doesn't undertake
a parikrama?

1269
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,360
Then I will be committing a sin!

1270
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,560
And then what if anything wrong
happens to my mother?

1271
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,480
But when did you commit
that you would..

1272
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,240
..immediately undertake
a parikrama?

1273
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,360
You are free to do
it whenever you..

1274
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,880
..may think it suitable in life!

1275
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,640
Besides,
you are more needed to be here..

1276
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,400
..to first look after
your mother!

1277
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,160
Yes!

1278
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,240
You go home peacefully and look
after your mother only! -Go!

1279
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,360
Shastri?
What advice did you give him?

1280
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,040
That will invite a big disaster!

1281
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,080
Once an oath is taken then it
must be filfilled! Isn't it?

1282
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,520
God's mind is not so cheap!

1283
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,560
That it will immediately
dictate a punishment..

1284
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,200
..if you don't fulfill an oath!

1285
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,720
Then assume that he won't ever
undertake a parikrama now!

1286
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,520
Yes! A parikrama needs
to be done only..

1287
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,160
..if there is enough
faith in mind!

1288
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,880
Not just for the sake of
fulfilling an oath only!

1289
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,280
River Narmada doesn't
bind anybody!

1290
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,080
She flows freely!

1291
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,160
Likewise she emancipates
everybody!

1292
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,600
Freedom is our birthright!

1293
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,920
Okay! Fine!

1294
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,760
How can I dispute what
Ganesh-Shastri dictates about religion?

1295
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,760
God bless me!
-Yah! But I have a question?

1296
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,880
Yes..tell me!

1297
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,880
Am I the only one who
is worried about..

1298
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,240
..dinner or even you
are craving for it?

1299
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,560
Come uncle!
I'll help you in kitchen!

1300
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,160
Okay! Okay! Let us go!

1301
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,600
Please wait for me also!
-God bless me!

1302
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,920
Yes! Come!

1303
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,040
That Karan was asking for a
signature on some papers!

1304
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,600
Myself and Supriya are
leaving for ashram!

1305
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,960
So you have a look at
what he was asking!

1306
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,440
And yes..one more thing!

1307
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,560
Don't you go to the mountains
during Chaturmas times!

1308
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,440
If Karan has come all of us will
stay together in ashram!

1309
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,600
But till then he must last here!

1310
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,720
What? What do you mean?

1311
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,760
No..nothing..come let us go!

1312
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,080
God bless me!

1313
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,800
She is 'Vanita'!
Supriya's mother!

1314
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,280
If she'd be living today
I and Guptaji wouldn't..

1315
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,080
..worry about
Supriya's marriage!

1316
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,600
I know about Supriya's father!

1317
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,480
But about her mother..?

1318
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,400
She became a nun! -What?

1319
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,120
She was a nun only!

1320
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,640
Even Supriya is a nun only!

1321
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,160
Can anyone become a nun by
sacrificing one's own daughter?

1322
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,080
Religion is like addiction!

1323
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,280
Perhaps some debt of
the previous life..

1324
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,880
..must be remaining unremitted!

1325
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,880
Do you believe in the past life?

1326
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,560
Do you believe in
the present life?

1327
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,680
Hey...is this you?

1328
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,440
You look very handsome with
hairs on your head!

1329
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,000
You mean..now I don't
look handsome?

1330
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,760
No..no..it's not like that!

1331
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,200
And that's grandpa..right?

1332
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,960
Yes...this is a photo when he
had undertaken a parikrama!

1333
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,640
What?

1334
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,480
Grandpa had undertaken
a parikrama? -Yes!

1335
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,720
Unbelievable!

1336
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,760
So?
Did he meet Reva in human form?

1337
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,600
What he got was very priceless!

1338
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,880
You possess the photos
of everybody!

1339
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,000
Don't you have the photos
of my parents?

1340
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,760
Grandpa never told me about
who are my parents!

1341
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,960
Do you have any idea?

1342
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,640
Your grandpa knows it better!

1343
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,800
Why has your grandpa given
all his wealth..

1344
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,960
..to the ashram instead of you?

1345
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,000
Yes? -These papers...!

1346
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,800
Isn't this the only reason why
you were searching for me?

1347
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,200
Yes...yes..but how
it reached you?

1348
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,200
How did this happen?

1349
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,120
When you came here this
was the only..

1350
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,200
..thing that was left
proper here!

1351
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,920
I have made the signature!

1352
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,040
I have full faith in you!

1353
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,320
Just like you..even
I have the faith!

1354
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,760
When you'll go tomorrow
I won't be there!

1355
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,640
Baldev will drop you at Harikot!

1356
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,200
I am looking forward to meet
you at the ashram..

1357
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,160
..when I'll come there
for Chaturmas!

1358
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,800
Everything else is left
to your wishes!

1359
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,240
Mehta uncle! Congratulate me!

1360
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,440
The first and the most
important signature..

1361
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,840
..of Shastri is obtained!

1362
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,000
Now everybody else's signs can
be obtained very quickly!

1363
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,240
I am coming back soon!

1364
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,720
This Shastri seems to
be a sensible fellow!

1365
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,480
He also appeared a little
more faithful!

1366
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,320
He gave me a signature
without asking..

1367
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,800
..me any further questions!

1368
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,440
Only for the sake of his faith!

1369
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,640
Any way..I will give rest
of the details..

1370
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,000
..after returning to America!
-See you soon!

1371
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,160
My next target is 'Gupta'!

1372
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,560
Give me! Show me where am I
supposed to give my signature?

1373
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,800
At this place please!

1374
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,880
Where will I get to
meet Bittu-Banga?

1375
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,200
We'll have to get an iron door
after reaching the town now?

1376
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,640
Hey Bittu-Banga!

1377
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,960
Hey Bittu-Banga!

1378
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,320
We want money!

1379
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,520
Yes! But first finish my job!

1380
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,840
You had said that if
Shastriji signs..

1381
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,120
..then even you
will do the same!

1382
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,640
See this!
Shastriji has given it!

1383
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,960
Will you give us some money for
Ghal-sandi. -an iron door?

1384
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,040
Ghal...what?

1385
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,600
How much do you want?
-Rupees two thousand!

1386
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,080
Only rupees two thousand?
-Yes! -Yes..yes..I'll give you!

1387
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,760
Do your signature properly!

1388
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,440
It would have been nice
if either one..

1389
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,160
..of you guys would
become a trustee!

1390
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,280
What?

1391
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,920
With whom is he talking alone?

1392
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,280
Excuse me? -Shhhhh!

1393
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,520
Yes? What do you want? -You had
said to me that you will sign..

1394
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,840
..if Shastriji offers
his signature!

1395
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,680
Take this paper and
give me your sign!

1396
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,880
Is this any work of the ashram?
-Yes. Of course!

1397
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,800
It is related to the ashram only!
-Did I say that?

1398
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,880
Yes, you had said that!
-Promise! You had said that!

1399
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,280
What?

1400
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,080
Please give me your sign!

1401
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,880
Go away!

1402
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,880
Bandu fakir won't give his
signature so quickly!

1403
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,200
Supriya!

1404
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,000
These plants have dried up...!

1405
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,600
Remove them and sow
these new ones!

1406
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,320
Okay?
And give water to each of them!

1407
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,920
Supriya? -Just a minute please!
Add some fertilisers also!

1408
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,360
Yes...tell me?

1409
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,160
You don't wander in
bright sunlight!

1410
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,000
Shastri uncle has told
you to take rest!

1411
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,400
I will take rest only after
returning to America now! -What?

1412
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,240
I mean..I will take rest!

1413
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,960
Are you going back?

1414
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,360
Well..hmmmm..the thing is!

1415
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,160
Sister?! Sister?!

1416
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,920
Supriya-sister?

1417
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,200
What happened Paka?
What makes you so much excited?

1418
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,320
Puriya... An evil spirit
has captured Puriya!

1419
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,080
Where is Puriya, Paka?
Where is Puriya?

1420
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,600
Paka, where is Puriya?

1421
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,680
Paka...speak up!
Where is Puriya?

1422
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,440
She is at the same place
where an evil..

1423
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,280
..spirit is burnt
alive every time!

1424
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,680
At the 'Karma-Shiksha' chowk!

1425
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,600
What? What is happening here?

1426
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,280
Zurka! Zurka! Go fast! Go!

1427
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,400
Supriya! Please tell me!
What is happening here?

1428
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,160
It is being claimed that an evil
spirit has captured Puriya!

1429
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,520
Very bad incident is
going to happen!

1430
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,720
They will kill that poor girl
now! -They will burn her alive!

1431
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,240
Come..Paka..run!

1432
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,960
Wait...wait!

1433
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,280
Paka, what is
all this happening?

1434
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,840
An evil spirit has
captured Puriya!

1435
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,800
So now Puriya has become
woman of evil spirit!

1436
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,160
Now that evil spirit will cease
only if she is burnt alive!

1437
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,280
Otherwise Puriya will kill
everybody from our village!

1438
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,800
What are all these
superstitions?

1439
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,200
Do you even believe this?

1440
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,000
It doesn't matter whether
you or me believe this!

1441
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,640
We must reach there in time or
else they will burn Puriya!

1442
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,880
They claim that Puriya has
become an evil spirit!

1443
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,280
Now she doesn't have any right
to stay in this jungle!

1444
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,800
Oh! Darn it! This is so insane!

1445
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,080
That is why in America..

1446
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,960
..India is known as a country
of black magic!

1447
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,520
I am sorry! I am sorry! Shall
we go to the police?

1448
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,760
It is of no use! -Even the nearest
police station is 40 kms. Away!

1449
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,400
What the hell is this?

1450
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,240
Come! Let us go quickly!

1451
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,080
An evil spirit has captured
my daughter!

1452
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,160
Aunty, stop crying and first
tell me what happened?

1453
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,200
The boy of my elder
daughter Rambali..

1454
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,160
..got lost yesterday morning!

1455
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,400
The whole village was
searching for him!

1456
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,280
When Rambali saw in the
morning that Puriya..

1457
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,240
..was weeping holding the half..

1458
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,520
..corpse of that boy
-Laddo, in her laps!

1459
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,880
Where is Rambali?

1460
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,760
Rambali has ran away!

1461
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,240
Rambali has ran away?

1462
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,680
Why did you allow
her to run away?

1463
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,120
Puriya has eaten that boy!
She will eat Rambali also!

1464
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,080
How will an evil spirit
spare anyone?

1465
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,080
You just sit here and I will go
to the chowk and return soon!

1466
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,640
Darn it! -Wait! Wait! You!

1467
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,160
He was talking about his wife!

1468
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,400
How can these people
burn someone alive?

1469
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,720
I will lodge a complaint
with the police!

1470
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,880
We are killing an evil spirit!
What has police got to do?

1471
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,680
Are we killing any living being?
-Come! Let us go!

1472
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,280
Mother,
we will take Puriya at a..

1473
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,280
..far off place from this jugle!

1474
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,440
I won't let her come here again!

1475
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,440
No! I won't let her go!

1476
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,160
We will have to kill
her now when she..

1477
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,840
..has become an evil spirit now!

1478
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,040
They will cut her and
then burn her!

1479
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,920
Aunty..she is your daughter!

1480
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,880
Bittu-Banga!
Let us go! -Just wait a minute!

1481
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,160
Even I will come along!
Even I want to meet Puriya!

1482
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,600
I am not going to meet Puryia!

1483
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,320
Please Karan! You stay back
here only! -It is not safe!

1484
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,840
For God's sake you
stay here only!

1485
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,560
Please don't interfere in this!

1486
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,680
Come! Let us go!

1487
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,000
Hey! You take me to Puriya!

1488
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,800
But sister has disallowed!
-Didn't I tell you?

1489
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,880
Come! Let us go!

1490
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,520
Come...I say!

1491
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,960
Hello sir? What are you doing?

1492
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,800
Don't go near that evil woman!

1493
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,080
Who is evil woman?
-She has become an evil woman!

1494
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,080
Puriya...what is all this?

1495
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,000
Come on...come with me!

1496
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,880
You go away from here!
Else I will eat you!

1497
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,920
Don't you see? I've become a
woman captured by an evil spirit!

1498
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,440
Are you mad?
Stop talking nonsense!

1499
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,120
I am a woman of
evil spirit only!

1500
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,560
Even my husband claimed
that I'm a..

1501
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,160
..woman captured by an evil
spirit! -Rambali also said!

1502
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,000
All the good villagers
said the same!

1503
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,680
I have become a woman
of evil spirit!

1504
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,920
Not only that but even
Rambali's husband..

1505
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,320
..also said the same thing!

1506
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,040
I have become a woman of evil
spirit! -I ate his son!

1507
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,520
Hey..hey! Because of you she is
becoming ready to die today!

1508
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,600
She looks upon you as a brother!

1509
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,720
And do you think she
will eat your son?

1510
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,200
Tell her that she is not a woman
captured by some evil spirit!

1511
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,880
Hello sir? Enough is enough!

1512
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,680
This is a matter of our village!

1513
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,720
Allow us to look after our
religious faiths and matters!

1514
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,360
What religious
matters are yours?

1515
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,440
At one end you offer saree
to a river and..

1516
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,560
..other end you are burning
a girl alive?

1517
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,000
The evening is approaching
and the strength..

1518
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,560
..of the evil woman will grow!
-Just shut up! -Shut up you coward!

1519
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,920
Puriya?

1520
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,640
Spare him! Don't you beat him!

1521
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,840
I am not a woman captured
by evil spirit!

1522
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,240
No evil spirit has captured me!

1523
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,160
A forest animal had eaten Laddu,
the boy!

1524
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,880
I was only kissing his corpse!

1525
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,680
I was pleading before him
to somehow open his eyes!

1526
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,600
I am not a woman captured
by evil spirit!

1527
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,720
Brother,
at least you believe in me!

1528
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,000
Did you listen her? Did you?

1529
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,560
Hello? Tie him down!

1530
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,080
Hey...!

1531
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,680
Hey..leave me!

1532
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,880
I am not a woman captured
by evil spirit!

1533
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,960
Give me my bag! -I am not
a woman captured by evil spirit!

1534
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,920
Begin the rites of
sacrifice quickly!

1535
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,160
No! Don't burn my bag!

1536
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,800
I am not a woman captured
by evil spirit!

1537
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,560
I am not a woman captured
by evil spirit!

1538
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,920
Come!

1539
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,760
I have bound the evil spirit!

1540
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,160
I will carry it and
bury it somewhere..

1541
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,240
..it won't ever come now
to cause trouble to you people!

1542
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,000
Sit! Sit! Sit! -Where is Puriya?

1543
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,320
Puriya? Where is she?

1544
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,960
She is fine! -She is safe!

1545
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,120
What? -Kaale-Waali Mother
has taken her into..

1546
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,320
..her Raani-Gufa (Queen's cave)!
-You need not worry!

1547
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,120
But what will those
people do with her?

1548
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,080
Do you mean, in the Raani-Gufa?

1549
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,440
In Rani-Gufa..

1550
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,880
..Puriya will be as safe as a
fetus is in mother's womb.

1551
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,080
Okay? -Kaale-Waali Mother heself
will look after Puriya there!

1552
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,160
Okay? Now you take rest!

1553
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,400
Take a little rest! You will
feel nice! -No! No! I am fine!

1554
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,880
My bag? My bag? -What?

1555
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,200
Where is my bag?
-Hello? Listen to me! Hello?

1556
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,000
Isn't it good that your
life was saved?

1557
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,280
I had warned you not to interfere!
You could have died there!

1558
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,560
You don't know what they can do!

1559
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,960
These idiot people were going
to burn a living..

1560
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,840
..girl for the grip
of blind faith!

1561
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,040
And do you expect me
to keep looking..

1562
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,600
..at all this nonsense there?
-She was almost killed!

1563
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,600
But the traditions here!

1564
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,080
Bloody hell with your
stupid traditions!

1565
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:35,040
Is this your culture?

1566
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,960
Is this your birth-right
for emancipation?

1567
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,680
At one end you boast about
your rich heritage..

1568
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,360
..and ancient culture of India..

1569
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,160
And on the other end you
are behaving with..

1570
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,840
..an idiotic stupidity
to kill anyone?

1571
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,120
Where is that Shastriji?
Call him here immediately!

1572
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,680
He wants to have faith here?
Isn't it?

1573
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,560
You keep hoisting the flag
of your traditions..

1574
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,080
..in such stupid concepts!

1575
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,200
Forgive me please!

1576
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,040
I don't want to stay here!

1577
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,200
Uncle, whatever that happened
here today I..

1578
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,240
..can't explain but one
thing is decided!

1579
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,680
That these people are crazy!

1580
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,600
They had become so mad in
mob mentality that..

1581
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,760
..they would've killed
me also perhaps!

1582
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,240
Grandpa was wrong and I was,
as usual, right!

1583
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,320
It's a country of the people
who leave work and..

1584
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,160
..offer coconuts or flowers
on a full moon..

1585
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,680
..night to do sacrifices
to earn solace without..

1586
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,120
..sensing that they are
polluting their rivers!

1587
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,440
I don't want to stay here
even for a day now!

1588
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,360
Signs were all done almost!

1589
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,960
But the papers got burnt!

1590
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,760
I have no patience to get all
the signs once again any more!

1591
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,720
I am coming back by next flight!

1592
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,240
I want my money in my
account at any cost!

1593
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:47,720
Listen! How many dollars have
you borrowed from them already?

1594
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,160
That negro had come into
the hotel and..

1595
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,160
..he has destructed
everything here!

1596
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,960
He has beaten me also a lot!

1597
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,000
He has given a credit
of only one week!

1598
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,120
This is my last help to you!

1599
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,120
Go quickly get the sign of
the trustees and return..

1600
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,640
..here with money immediately!

1601
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,040
Spare me from these
dangerous negros..

1602
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,800
..after bring home the money,
my dear!

1603
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,640
Where is brother-Karan?

1604
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:23,200
Hello Supriya..his bag is burnt!

1605
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,960
These papers with a few signs
also have got burnt today!

1606
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,240
He was claiming that they were
very important documents!

1607
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,720
See this!
Only a few could be saved!

1608
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,640
Take this bag also!

1609
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,720
Okay!

1610
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,080
Supriya..I spoke with
you a little too..

1611
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,920
..harsh under the
stroke of anger!

1612
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,640
But the thing is I am in
a big problem right now!

1613
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,520
I will have to complete
a few formalities..

1614
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,200
..before leaving from
here urgently!

1615
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,440
After looting the ashram's
property..

1616
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,760
..and the hopes of the
people here? -Supriya?

1617
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,760
You have stabbed us in the back!

1618
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,200
You have spoilt the
grandpa's name!

1619
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,520
Here in the jungles only
it is a custom..

1620
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:29,600
..to think of the others
at every breath!

1621
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,600
It is the custom of
this soil only!

1622
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,800
Anybody born here always
talks of sacrificies..

1623
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,400
..and sufferings for others!

1624
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,480
You have frustrated me Karan!

1625
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,320
You have proved today
that you don't..

1626
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,920
..belong to this mother
soil here!

1627
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,640
Guptaji and Bittu-Banga..

1628
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,360
..everyone thinks of you as
a successor of the grandpa!

1629
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,480
That is why they respect
you today!

1630
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,440
I don't wish that the
respect toward you..

1631
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,200
..in their minds reduces
for any reason!

1632
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,960
They will feel terribly
sad for that!

1633
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,800
And I do not wish
to see them sad!

1634
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,440
But if you don't leave
from here within..

1635
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,040
..two days then I'll tell
everybody! -Supriya...listen! -I am...!

1636
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,360
Please....please leave!

1637
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,400
Please....please leave! -There
is no need to do so much drama!

1638
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,360
The people here are as pure as
the water of the River Narmada!

1639
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:29,880
Please...please don't
pollute them!

1640
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,320
And yes..do send the document!

1641
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,760
I will sign it and
courier it to you!

1642
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,160
Have you quarrelled
with anybody?

1643
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,200
Yes?

1644
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,760
When I saw you first
time I felt as if..

1645
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,640
..someone has mixed
turmeric with tea!

1646
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,920
Turmeric is always nice
but it deserves..

1647
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,920
..to be mixed with milk only!

1648
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,160
And not with the tea!

1649
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,480
I thought the son of
the foreigner must..

1650
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,000
..have come here
by mistake only!

1651
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:59,000
But when you staked
your own life to..

1652
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,320
..save Puriya at that
deadly place..

1653
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,160
That time I felt that this
is something only..

1654
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,040
..the grandson of the
foreigner can do!

1655
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,600
Now I have started realising
why Mother..

1656
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,520
..Narmada has called you here?

1657
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,160
If your Mother Narmada
river has called me..

1658
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,800
..here then why didn't
it give me what.

1659
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,360
I had sought to get from here?

1660
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,760
May be the right time may
not have reached as yet!

1661
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,840
But Mother Naramada doesn't let
anyone return empty handed!

1662
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:40,480
When I was doing the Parikrama
of the River Narmada...

1663
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,760
That time my soul...!

1664
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,680
Parikrama? -Yes! Indeed!

1665
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,680
You are Maulana Ali-Baksh!

1666
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,200
Even you believe in Parikrama?

1667
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,720
Whether I become a sage
or I become a drunkard!

1668
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,880
Where will the faith
hidden in me vanish?

1669
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,560
Then has your faith
helped you see..

1670
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,120
..the River Narmada
in human form?

1671
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,240
Did you meet Reva?

1672
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,080
You yourself walk and see that!

1673
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,600
Do you want to come and see it?

1674
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,360
I do not believe in
this Parikrama!

1675
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,240
What else you are doing except
a Parikrama only?

1676
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,880
Immediately after birth..

1677
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,920
..the earth had started
surrounding the sun!

1678
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,840
Likewise in every material
object the..

1679
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,920
..rmotion is set on
an atomic level!

1680
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,680
It is through this constant
motion only that..

1681
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,280
..everybody evolves and
blossoms in life!

1682
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,320
My dear Guru! You are right!

1683
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,560
Correct!

1684
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,720
Even I was in constant motion.

1685
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:54,400
I used to run around my grandpa
during all my childhood days!

1686
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,680
To find out who were my parents?

1687
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,760
After growing I started
running around..

1688
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,440
..to win money in life
and now after..

1689
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,160
..continuing the run
after run I have..

1690
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,760
..finally reached here at last!

1691
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,360
Here I ran around and
around to win..

1692
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,960
..someone's heart and love now!

1693
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,600
But I have come across
failure again!

1694
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,680
Total failure!

1695
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,800
Failure!

1696
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,720
Yes! Failure indeed!

1697
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:22,360
You become a failure only
when you give up!

1698
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,240
When Draupadi's clothes were
being snatched by Dushasan..

1699
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,680
That time she had held
her saree using..

1700
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,200
..one of her hands
and using second..

1701
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,320
..hand she was pleading
for Lord..

1702
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,920
..Krishna to come
for her rescue!

1703
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,880
That time Lord Krishna
didn't come!

1704
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,120
But when Draupadi begged
for Lord Krishna..

1705
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,040
..upholding both of her hands..

1706
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,000
..then Lord Krishna
came running!

1707
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,960
Till you have a doubt
in mind you won't..

1708
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,960
..get to meet your God
or your purpose!

1709
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,040
When you will have full
faith and when..

1710
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,160
..you will raise both
of your hands to..

1711
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,080
..beg for the mercy
of your God it..

1712
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,760
..is only then...your God...!

1713
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,880
See! Today Mother River
Narmada forced..

1714
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,960
..you to sleep in her
close company?

1715
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,560
Isn't it?

1716
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,520
Where were you?

1717
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:56,680
Guptaji..I was going
to tell you that!

1718
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,760
Don't you remember I am
going to Amarkantak..

1719
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,840
..today to see a groom
for my daughter?

1720
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,240
What?

1721
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,040
Now that I am going that
far I thought I..

1722
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,640
..will also pay a visit
to the pilgrimage?

1723
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,760
Yes..Yes! I just forgot that!

1724
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,120
Come!
Come on! Come inside quickly!

1725
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,080
I was waiting for you only!

1726
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,160
Now at least take your seat man!
-Yes..yes!

1727
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Sit down please!

1728
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,040
Just like as I told you that
I am going out today!

1729
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,520
And the pilgrims doing
Parikrama also..

1730
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,040
..will start coming from today!

1731
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,440
So will you guys be able
to look after..

1732
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,600
..all the work of the ashram?
-Don't worry! We'll do it!

1733
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:29,960
Yes! We'll do it!

1734
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,280
But Guptaji, I need to leave
within next two days!

1735
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:35,840
Where?

1736
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,280
Back to America!

1737
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,240
God bless me now!
You are telling me now?

1738
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,120
My son, you've just started
to understand..

1739
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,080
..the entire undertakings
of the ashram!

1740
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,960
Yes..but some urgent
work has come up!

1741
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,280
But if you are forcing
me so much..

1742
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,880
I can stay back here for
a few days more! Okay?

1743
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,320
Listen to me son!

1744
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,520
I don't have right over
you as much as..

1745
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,160
..it was like your
grandfather could!

1746
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,800
But one thing I do
say as a request!

1747
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,320
You stay here as long
as I don't return!

1748
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,480
But uncle,
when he is telling that he's..

1749
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,080
..having an urgent work
then let him go!

1750
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,680
We all are here to look
after the work!

1751
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,240
No..no! I can manage!

1752
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,840
Yes..He'll have to manage!

1753
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,400
Supriya,
the pilgrims doing a Parikrama..

1754
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,680
..will come here in the ashram!

1755
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,280
Thousands of other
works are there!

1756
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,520
If he stays back he will share
some of our responsibilities!

1757
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:30,120
Isn't it? -But uncle, if
he is going to stop then let..

1758
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:34,600
..him handle the task of
welcoming pilgrims!

1759
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,320
Of course! -Isn't it? -Oh yes!

1760
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,160
Of course! -Yes! -Look at that!

1761
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,080
The pilgrims doing a Parikrama
have started coming!

1762
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,320
May Goddess Mother
Narmada bless us!

1763
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,960
May Goddess Mother
Narmada bless us!

1764
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,320
May God bless you a long life!

1765
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,880
May God bless you a long life!

1766
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,880
May Goddess Mother
Narmada bless us!

1767
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,000
Yes! Yes! Let us go!

1768
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,960
I can't stay here!
I don't wish to stay here!

1769
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,160
There is another room here!
-No man can stay here!

1770
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,040
Bittu-Banga!
Wait! What's the problem sir?

1771
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,200
If you can't do proper service
be frank to say it on face man!

1772
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,720
Do you insult the pilgrims
walking in the..

1773
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,360
..Parikrama by showing
such dirty rooms?

1774
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,160
Do you want to have
a shortcut even..

1775
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,120
..to earn some sacred goodwill?

1776
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,840
The rooms are so dirty that
even the stables..

1777
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,320
..of horses can't be made here!

1778
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,400
How can the pilgrims
walking in a..

1779
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,480
..Parikrama stay at such places?

1780
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,160
Sir, I request, you
eat your breakfast!

1781
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,520
Till that time I'll get
the room cleaned!

1782
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,600
Yes!
Get the room cleaned till then!

1783
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,920
God dwells only where cleanliness
spreads! Got it? -Okay!

1784
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,080
Everything else is fine
but I can't do this..

1785
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,280
..work of looking after
the pilgrims!

1786
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,600
I've delegated the work
to Bittu-Banga!

1787
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,440
Bloody arrogant, idiot!

1788
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,400
Are you asking about the
pilgrim who was..

1789
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,480
..insisting to get
the rooms cleaned?

1790
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,960
Yes! Have you met him earlier?

1791
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,880
Isn't he a man looking whom one
can lose one's own balance?

1792
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,720
Service takes place not
through brains but..

1793
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,800
..always through one's heart,
my son!

1794
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,640
If you wish to earn goodwill
by serving..

1795
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,240
..such men then go
ahead and do it!

1796
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,440
I am not interested to
earn any goodwill!

1797
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,520
These thousands of people
are not serving..

1798
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,080
..the pilgrims doing Parikrama!

1799
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,960
They are doing only to preserve
the tradition of Parikrama!

1800
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,640
It cannot be that you
will offer service..

1801
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,880
..to someone because
he is decent and..

1802
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:14,960
..refuse to serve someone
because he..

1803
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,520
..is arrogant
cannot be accepted!

1804
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,280
But forget it!
No problem at all!

1805
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:24,320
What all these uneducated
aborigines from..

1806
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,600
..this land of Reva
can heartily do..

1807
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,640
..can't be done by educated
men like you!

1808
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,360
I will do it!

1809
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,760
He has started feeling
affectionate..

1810
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,880
..for the local landscape
and people!

1811
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,000
He has started liking
the fragrance of..

1812
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,960
..the local soil and
the culture here!

1813
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:03,120
The mind is echoing to the
local ethos apparent here!

1814
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:07,520
The mind is echoing to the
local ethos apparent here!

1815
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,280
The affection of the village
is creating warmth in mind!

1816
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,280
He has started liking
the fragrance of..

1817
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,280
..the local soil and
the culture here!

1818
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,400
You cannot do even a single
work properly!

1819
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:21,680
Do you know that
once again new..

1820
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,320
..documents will
have to be made!

1821
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,760
It takes 15 days to send
the papers by courier..

1822
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:25,960
..after getting them
from a lawyer!

1823
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,800
No problem uncle because
as it is even..

1824
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,920
..I have to stay back
here for 15 days!

1825
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,440
I have some work to do here!

1826
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,080
Someone is huffed with me! -I
will have to deal with that. -What?

1827
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,840
I mean one of the trustees
is huffed!

1828
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,840
Some conflict has taken place!

1829
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:39,920
I will have to pamperthat
person to..

1830
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
..obtain the
signature on papers!

1831
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,320
What about that Savio
will pounce on me..

1832
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,000
..till the time you pamper
someone there?

1833
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,760
Uncle, you have helped me a lot!
-See...this time...!

1834
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,760
Now don't you burden me
with your expenses..

1835
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,280
..taking place there! Please.

1836
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:56,800
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1837
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,160
You are not realising
that what you..

1838
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,320
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1839
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:05,080
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1840
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:09,000
You are not realising
that what you..

1841
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,880
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1842
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,600
Okay! What is the matter now?

1843
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:23,280
Ration!

1844
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,760
What?
-Kamalaba was telling me that..

1845
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,320
..the stocks are finished now!

1846
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,200
Arrangements will
have to be done!

1847
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,040
I have already signed
the document! -What?

1848
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,600
Try to manage everything
in whatever..

1849
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,280
..you guys can try
to put together!

1850
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,280
We'll see what needs to be done!

1851
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:43,920
Keep suffering and live
with the trouble!

1852
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,680
But keep flowing like
water of the river.

1853
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,200
Keep asking whatever
comes to your mind..

1854
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,080
..answers to all your questions,
you will find.

1855
01:41:56,240 --> 01:42:00,520
The mind that has become
dry and parched!

1856
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:04,000
It will soon blossom
with greenery now!

1857
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:08,160
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1858
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,200
You are not realising
that what you..

1859
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,200
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1860
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:16,560
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1861
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:20,000
You are not realising
that what you..

1862
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:23,840
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1863
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,200
That day I hit you by mistake!

1864
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,080
But what do I do?

1865
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,800
I climb on the trees
up to the height..

1866
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,440
..of 50-60 feet to gather honey!

1867
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,880
Now if people start making
honey at leisure..

1868
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,960
..by these boxes how
will I survive?

1869
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,560
Today he fell down from
a height of 20 feet..

1870
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:48,320
..and has got fractured
his arm now!

1871
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,600
Now stop climbing on the trees!

1872
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,360
I will also rear honeybees
using a box!

1873
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,280
We will gather honey
in the boxes only!

1874
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,600
Please give one box to us also!

1875
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:02,560
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1876
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,480
You are not realising
that what you..

1877
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,800
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1878
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,880
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1879
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,880
You are not realising
that what you..

1880
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,040
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1881
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,600
You are in the same
pot where it..

1882
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:25,680
..is floating in the same ocean!

1883
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,040
You have found your God now in
the same soil and stones here!

1884
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,120
Uncle,
I went to work in a farm for..

1885
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,560
..the first time in
my life today!

1886
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,080
And I slipped down in mud then!

1887
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,280
And everybody was laughing
a lot on me!

1888
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,720
These people are so innocent
that they..

1889
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:37,360
..cannot even hide
their feelings!

1890
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,600
Their innocence made me also
to laugh in joy with them!

1891
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,240
I worked with these
people for 2-3..

1892
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,800
..hours in the
agricultural farm!

1893
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,600
And then I developed a hell of
a lots of pain in my back now!

1894
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,680
I just worked for doing
a change but how..

1895
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:53,480
..those who this daily
must be suffering?

1896
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,320
Their work will become
easy if these people..

1897
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,040
..get latest farming technology!

1898
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,240
Can you help?

1899
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,760
Brother Karan? -Yes?

1900
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,160
This is the money to buy ration
grains in the ashram!

1901
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,680
From where did you get this
money? -Supriya has given it to us!

1902
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,600
Supriya has given it? -Yes!

1903
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,720
She'd saved this money for
musical orchestra..

1904
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:15,920
..but she spared
this money for..

1905
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,440
..buying grains because
this year no money..

1906
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,044
..will come as a grant
for the ashram!

1907
01:44:21,124 --> 01:44:22,730
Then how is she going
to conduct..

1908
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:24,720
She was saying that she
is not in any mood..

1909
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,338
..to conduct musical orchestra
this year! -No!

1910
01:44:26,418 --> 01:44:28,200
She very much wants to conduct
a musical orchestra!

1911
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,560
But she is definitely
hiding something!

1912
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:32,200
I suspect she was weeping!
-Am I right? -Yes! Quite right!

1913
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,560
Okay! We will do something!

1914
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:38,000
The mind that has become
dry and parched!

1915
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,520
It will soon blossom
with greenery now!

1916
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:44,960
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1917
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,320
You are not realising
that what you..

1918
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,720
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1919
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,920
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1920
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:57,520
You are not realising

01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:01,320
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1922
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,960
You are a drop in the ocean
and ocean in the drop.

1923
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,800
You are the diamond and
you only the rock.

1924
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,720
You are the traveller and you
only the destination..

1925
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,840
..you are the path and you
only the companion.

1926
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,880
You are a drop in the ocean
and ocean in the drop.

1927
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,880
You are the diamond and
you only the rock.

1928
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:21,080
You are the traveller and you
only the destination..

1929
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,200
..you are the path and you
only the companion.

1930
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:27,280
Wake up you pilgrim please!
What are you searching for?

1931
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,560
You are not realising
that what you..

1932
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:35,480
..are searching for
is yourself only!

1933
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:43,680
Wake up you pilgrim please!

1934
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,160
Musical orchestra would
be a great fun if a..

1935
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,560
..singer like Puriya will
also be present?

1936
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:51,360
Yes!Just a minute!

1937
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:53,800
I know Puriya cannot
come here but you..

1938
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,960
..guys can go to the
'Sath-Saali' caves?

1939
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,560
Please take me there once guys?

1940
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,320
I do want to meet her! -Let me
at least see whether she's fine?

1941
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,160
Please guys...take me there!

1942
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,200
No! You can't go there! Forget
her please! -Forget her please!

1943
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,760
Forget her please!

1944
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,200
But please listen to me guys!

1945
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,280
Supriya? -Yes?

1946
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,920
Why don't you come to sing?

1947
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:15,760
You are the best singer!

1948
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:20,480
You come to sing and brother-Karan
will play his guitar also!

1949
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,320
Can't you see I have
lot of work to do?

1950
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,720
Why do you keep working
the whole day?

1951
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,520
Brother-Karan has said
that if you sing the..

1952
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,400
..musical orchestra will
be a great fun!

1953
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,200
Didn't you hear me that I have
lot of work to do now?

1954
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,520
You go away now!

1955
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,600
Who will go to distribute
the invitations..

1956
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,280
..in the surrounding villages
from here? -Yes?

1957
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,360
I will go to Chatti-tola
and Timba-tola..

1958
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,800
..villages but not to
the Kanha villages!

1959
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,760
Why? Why won't you go to
the Kanha villages?

1960
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,000
He is afraid of going
because of..

1961
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,720
..the tigers in the
Kanha forests!

1962
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:51,800
Tiger? -Tigers are there
but nowadays one tiger..

1963
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,840
..from there has become
a man-eater!

1964
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,800
I heard that he attacked
the daughter..

1965
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,640
..of the Naik on the
full moon night!

1966
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,200
Hello guys! You don't worry!
-Everything will be fine!

1967
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,000
Yes! Bittu-Banga will go to the
Kanha villages in forest!

1968
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,840
The musical orchestra
is taking place for..

1969
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:18,680
..the first time after
your father's death!

1970
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:22,360
Yes!
-But you don't seem to be happy!

1971
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,960
No uncle! Nothing like that!

1972
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,400
Okay..fine!

1973
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,440
What happened?

1974
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,040
There are some questions
in your mind!

1975
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,880
No! Nothing like that!

1976
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:43,960
The question in your mind
is why did I sign..

1977
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,000
..Karan's papers despite
knowing everything?

1978
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,880
Didn't you ever think
even once about the..

1979
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,680
..residents of the ashram
before signing?

1980
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,680
Who will take away whatever that
is there in the destiny..

1981
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:01,880
..my dear Supriya?

1982
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,680
And even though I've
signed the papers..

1983
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,680
..look at now what is
the picture today?

1984
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,440
He has opted to stop here!

1985
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,400
Although he has stopped
I doubt that..

1986
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:17,120
..is also out of selfishness
only!

1987
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,080
Now that the papers are burnt!

1988
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,160
What if he gets another
copy of the..

1989
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,320
..papers then what will he do?

1990
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,520
Then do whatever you
think is right!

1991
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,400
Have all the invitations been
delivered? -Yes! Sure! -Yes! Sure!

1992
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,840
Then why these Bittu-Banga
haven't reached as yet?

1993
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,800
Karan! Come fast
to the hospital!

1994
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:43,920
What?

1995
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:48,960
Bittu?

1996
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:50,800
Banga, what happened?

1997
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,000
His neck is injured and so he
is not able to talk anything!

1998
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,760
Keep calm! Keep calm!

1999
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,600
Don't you have any senses?

2000
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,720
Why didn't you stop somewhere
when it was an evening already?

2001
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,280
Why was there
any need to return?

2002
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,520
Keep calm! Keep calm!

2003
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,480
Please..doctor..doctor!

2004
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,400
Tiger has bitten him
on the neck and..

2005
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,080
..therefore lot of
blood has flowen!

2006
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:11,000
I didn't let anything
happen to him!

2007
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,360
I was there with him only!

2008
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,600
Keep calm! Keep calm!

2009
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,160
When the tiger attacked Bittu I
dashed and made him run away!

2010
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,720
Nothing will happen to him!
-Okay! Calm down! Calm down!

2011
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,920
Doctor..please do something!

2012
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,960
You leave the doctor!
Let him do something!

2013
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,280
Calm down! Calm down please!

2014
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:32,080
Doctor..please do something!

2015
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,080
I won't go out now!

2016
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,640
You come with me outside!

2017
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:38,880
No! I won't go out now!

2018
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,760
Come with me!
Come! -Oh my dear Bittu!

2019
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,960
I won't go out now!

2020
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:48,760
Sister? -We'll take him to
the hospital in the..

2021
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,400
..city of he does
not improve here!

2022
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,640
Whatever it will cost
I will remit..

2023
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,000
..the expense by working here!
-Calm down! Calm down please!

2024
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,480
We don't have time to take him
to a hospital in the city!

2025
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,160
We'll have to give him a best
treatment here only!

2026
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,520
Why urban doctor but I
will get the best..

2027
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,840
..doctor from America
also to give him..

2028
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,160
..a best best treatment
but I'll cure him!

2029
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:04,640
But you don't worry about him!

2030
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:13,080
May Mother Goddess
Narmada bless him!

2031
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,600
Bittu! Bittu!

2032
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,280
Banga,
we can take the dead body..

2033
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:11,920
..on tomorrow morning only,
Banga!

2034
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,720
Don't say 'Banga' only Guptaji!

2035
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,920
Say 'Bittu-Banga' only!

2036
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,200
Yes! Bittu-Banga!

2037
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,880
Six days have passed for our
Bittu to have passed away!

2038
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:46,040
But its still unbelievable!

2039
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:55,720
Brother-Karan!
That pandal owner has come!

2040
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,440
He must have come to
decorate the stage!

2041
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,000
But I wonder whether
we should conduct..

2042
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,680
..the musical orchestra now!

2043
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,240
I am unable to...?

2044
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:32,960
What happened?

2045
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,080
Only two days are remaining
for the..

2046
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,680
..musical orchestra to be held!

2047
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,440
Don't you want to
do any practice?

2048
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,800
Leave it now! Leave it!

2049
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,720
Yes..now it is standing!

2050
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:05,440
Yes..good!

2051
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,200
Now there won't be a problem!

2052
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:09,600
Okay! Let us go!

2053
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,000
Brother-Karan? -Yes?

2054
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,160
You have done a lot for me!

2055
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,480
I have brought
something for you!

2056
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,080
You had got acquainted first
with Puriya in this ashram!

2057
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:30,200
I'll take you to meet
Puriya but only once!

2058
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,800
You be ready at night
of the musical..

2059
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,640
..orchestra and I'll
take you to her!

2060
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,520
Thank you!

2061
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,000
Thank you Bittu-Banga!

2062
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,760
Can we talk for two minutes?

2063
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,600
Yes of course! Tell me!

2064
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,200
Thank you Karan!

2065
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,160
For supporting Banga
like a brother..

2066
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,280
..after the sad demise of Bittu!

2067
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:03,360
Thank you for associating
with the work of..

2068
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:06,240
..the ashram and revitalising
everybody!

2069
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,400
Thank you for fulfilling
my dream of..

2070
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,600
..conducting a
musical orchestra!

2071
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,640
Is this a genuine compliment
or a sarcasm?

2072
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:17,640
It is a genuine compliment!

2073
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,480
We are the people staying
with nature!

2074
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,040
Telling lies is not
in our culture!

2075
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,600
And tolerating lies also doesn't
fit in our nature!

2076
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,600
Now this is a sarcasm!

2077
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,240
Doing all this is not
necessary Karan!

2078
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:45,080
The papers you had sought have
arrived from America now!

2079
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,120
And I have already obtained
everyone's signature..

2080
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,760
..to reduce your troubles also!

2081
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:58,640
So now you need not
do all this drama!

2082
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,840
Now you go from here as
early as possbile!

2083
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,920
You still don't trust me?

2084
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,160
My mind believes in you!

2085
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,440
That I should trust
you once more!

2086
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,800
But now these papers of yours
have arrived from America now!

2087
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,400
Uncle Mehta has
sent them not me!

2088
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,320
Please Karan! -Please!

2089
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:27,640
My mind doesn't have strength to
withstand even a single lie!

2090
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,120
Before all these people
come to know..

2091
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,640
..the truth about
you..please go!

2092
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,440
You can go after the musical
orchestra gets over!

2093
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:45,320
Papers!

2094
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:15,080
I plead before my beloved
partner that..

2095
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:20,080
..I have become a nun to serve!

2096
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:30,880
I set my eyes on your path
O Lord Krishna my beloved!

2097
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,880
I plead before my beloved
partner that..

2098
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,040
..I have become a nun to serve!

2099
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:40,320
I set my eyes on your path
O Lord Krishna my beloved!

2100
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,120
When will you come
O Lord Krishna?

2101
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:49,600
We are craving for your
arrival o dear!

2102
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,960
Please don't make us
yearn like this!

2103
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,880
O Lord Krishna
my beloved o dear!

2104
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,760
Please don't make me
yearn to meet..

2105
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,320
..and get blended
with you o dear!

2106
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:11,880
Life is like a mysterious fire
like a rhyming tune burning!

2107
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:14,440
A lot many anger and
many questions are..

2108
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,640
..hidden today even
in my mind dear!

2109
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:21,480
Even I am wandering on earth
like a bolstering ocean here!

2110
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:25,040
Who on the face of
this earth knows..

2111
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:28,160
..the meaning of my questions?

2112
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:36,880
Life is like a mysterious fire
like a rhyming tune burning!

2113
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,560
A lot many anger and
many questions are..

2114
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,800
..hidden today even
in my mind dear!

2115
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:45,880
Even I am wandering on earth
like a bolstering ocean here!

2116
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:50,000
Who on the face of
this earth knows..

2117
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:53,280
..the meaning of my questions?

2118
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:25,920
Someone is sage and
someone is in rage!

2119
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:30,520
Someone is infected and
someone is king!

2120
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:34,880
Someone is wicked and
someone is capable!

2121
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:39,040
Someone is inferior and
someone is superior!

2122
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:43,800
No one here is immortal!

2123
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,160
Whether you are a diamond
or a coal soil..

2124
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:48,600
..is the destination
of your soul!

2125
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:53,600
Then why should one bother
about all these drama?

2126
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:59,640
Apply medicine to the
one who is injured!

2127
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,360
Give water to the one
who is parched!

2128
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:08,720
Live the life in such
a manner that..

2129
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:13,040
..even the death
will be ashamed!

2130
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:15,880
The one who knows how
to win the hearts..

2131
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,760
..will live even after death!

2132
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:20,080
Neither there will any
sword live nor..

2133
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,480
..an arrow will survive in life!

2134
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:28,520
Then why should one bother
about all these drama?

2135
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:41,680
Then why should one bother
about all these drama?

2136
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:48,400
Whether you are a diamond
or a coal soil..

2137
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:53,960
..is the destination
of your soul!

2138
01:59:54,280 --> 02:00:06,360
Then why should one bother
about all these drama?

2139
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,200
Puriya?

2140
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,280
You need to wash your
feet here first!

2141
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,600
Okay!

2142
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,720
I am possessing this and
I wish to meet Puriya!

2143
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:25,520
But first you wash your feet!

2144
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,680
I wish to meet Puriya!
I am having this...!

2145
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:44,720
Didn't you learn as yet to
forward the right hand?

2146
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,680
Puriya?

2147
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:49,440
Finally...!

2148
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:54,520
How are you?

2149
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:55,800
I am fine!

2150
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:59,160
How about you? -I am also fine!

2151
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:02,840
I was really very worried
about you!

2152
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,400
You don't worry about me at all!

2153
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,480
'Kaale-Waali' Mother
looks after..

2154
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:09,040
..all of us really very well
here! -Really...I mean it!

2155
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,520
And we, all of us, treated
one and the same here!

2156
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,320
Someone is either an orphan
or someone else..

2157
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,120
..stays here because
dowry problems!

2158
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,320
This is a 'Raani-Gufa'
(Queen's Cave) and..

2159
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:25,280
..all of us are 'Queens'
of this premises!

2160
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:30,280
Forget about all that! -You
first tell me how is Supriya?

2161
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:34,680
She is fine!
She remembers you a lot!

2162
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:36,680
Have you spoken with
her anything?

2163
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,560
Or is it that you haven't
disclosed yet?

2164
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,160
What? -Why are you staring
at me like this?

2165
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,040
I know you like her a lot!

2166
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:48,800
Yes!But I am returning now!

2167
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,960
Why?
Are you going back to America?

2168
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,680
Yes! -Why?

2169
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,840
Just like that!

2170
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,080
Okay...now that you
have come here do..

2171
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:01,600
..come and meet Mother
'Kaale-Waali'!

2172
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:05,240
No...but I have heard that
she does not meet anybody!

2173
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:07,360
The fact that you have
come so far means..

2174
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:09,160
..Mother 'Kaale-Waali'
wants to meet you!

2175
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:10,680
Now just follow me!

2176
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,160
Is it?

2177
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:14,720
Okay!

2178
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,680
Now wear your shoes! -Yes!

2179
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,680
She is Mother 'Kaale-Waali'!

2180
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,640
She is 'Vanita'!
Supriya's mother!

2181
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:00,880
She became a nun!

2182
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:03,200
What? -She was a nun only!

2183
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,440
Welcome Karan!

2184
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,480
Please sit!

2185
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:30,680
Karan?

2186
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,400
Hello Karan?

2187
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:38,240
I need to show you the
accounts of yesterday!

2188
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:40,400
Karan..?

2189
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:45,320
Dosi, did you
see Karan anywhere?

2190
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:48,200
No! Today morning he has not
come even for eating breakfast!

2191
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:50,160
What? -He wanders nowadays
with Bittu-Banga only!

2192
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:52,560
He must have taken
him somewhere!

2193
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:54,840
Okay! Okay! Where has he gone?

2194
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,600
Hey...Tempuriya? Come here!

2195
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:58,560
Go to Bittu-Banga and tell
him that Guptaji..

2196
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:00,720
..is calling him in the office!
-Go...run!

2197
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:03,120
Where has he gone? I am searching
for him since today morning!

2198
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:06,080
I need to show these accounts!
I wonder where has Karan gone?

2199
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:07,920
And even our Shastriji!

2200
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:10,960
Just told me that he's going for
a bath in Narmada and gone!

2201
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:12,440
He has not returned as yet!

2202
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:16,200
I am feeling tempted to ask
which such place has he gone?

2203
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,560
Take me also there!

2204
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,080
Yes? Girl..are you listening
to me or am..

2205
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,000
..I just talking alone
myself to a wall?

2206
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:26,240
Look at him! He has come! He
is a replica of another!

2207
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:27,960
Where is he? -Who? -Karan!

2208
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:29,440
Where is brother-Karan?

2209
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,920
Karan won't come here now!

2210
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:32,880
What?

2211
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,600
Karan won't come because he
has left the ashram now!

2212
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:41,280
What is this you are
talking my dear?

2213
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,760
I am telling you
the truth uncle!

2214
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:49,160
Karan hadn't come to look
after grandpa's..

2215
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:53,440
..work but only for taking
our signatures!

2216
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:59,160
So that he gets all the property
of his grandpa!

2217
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:02,360
I have given all the
documents to him..

2218
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,400
..yesterday night which
you had signed!

2219
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,520
What?

2220
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,720
Today morning he has
left from ashram!

2221
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:17,880
With him and may be this ashram
will also be gone soon..

2222
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:35,960
Where is Karan?

2223
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,480
Where is Karan?

2224
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,960
Mr. Mehta?
-Yes! Of course! I am Mehta only!

2225
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:42,440
Please call Karan here!

2226
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:46,720
He is not there here! -What?

2227
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:50,840
He has returned back! -Don't
lie! I know he is here only!

2228
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:54,080
How can he give up such
a huge property?

2229
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:56,400
He has not given up all
the property but he..

2230
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,240
..has taken all the documents
of ashram!

2231
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:59,680
Impossible!

2232
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:02,360
During his last call itself he
had himself told me that!

2233
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:03,480
Mehta-uncle..

2234
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,560
..please inform this
message of mine..

2235
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:07,160
..to the grandfather's lawyers!

2236
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:11,080
I don't want anything
from the property!

2237
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,040
Please transfer all
the money into..

2238
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,640
..the account of the ashram now!

2239
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:20,280
And I'm really very sorry
for all the trouble!

2240
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:26,080
For some time I won't come back!
I will be staying here only!

2241
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,560
But I will be fine!
Don't worry about me!

2242
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:32,480
Bye!

2243
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,960
You are telling me that
Karan is not here!

2244
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:39,240
He has not returned
to America also!

2245
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:40,840
Then...

2246
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:44,360
Where is Karan after all?

2247
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:48,400
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2248
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:53,680
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2249
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:57,720
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2250
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:02,280
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2251
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:06,880
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2252
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:11,080
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2253
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:16,200
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2254
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:21,280
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2255
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:38,800
Sorry! I am sorry!

2256
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:40,520
Keep it! Keep it with you only!

2257
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,720
I have already read that! I am
reading it for second time now!

2258
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,640
Are you sure? -Yes! I am sure!

2259
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:49,040
I am little slow in Gujarati
language! -Yes! I can see that!

2260
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,560
How? -That is why you
didn't recognise me?

2261
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:53,840
What? -No..nothing!

2262
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:55,720
Please read this
book peacefully!

2263
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:58,120
Go to its depth slowly!

2264
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:05,680
I know you!

2265
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,720
I have see you earlier somewhere!
-Forget about that introduction!

2266
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:12,520
Forget about that!

2267
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,240
I am only a pilgrim now
going for a Parikrama!

2268
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:18,000
You've undertaken a Parikrama
at this age?

2269
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:20,280
I have shot too many selphies
at this age, my dear brother!

2270
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:22,680
Now I am on my journey to
discover my own self!

2271
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,840
Good!

2272
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:26,520
Thank you!

2273
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:28,280
Okay! Even I will leave now!

2274
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:31,720
Are you a pilgrim doing
a Parikrama?

2275
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,360
I have no idea!

2276
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:39,800
Mother Revaa!

2277
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:50,840
God know who first started a
Parikrama of River Narmada!

2278
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:53,960
And then started this
novel tradition!

2279
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:57,040
Even today this tradition
is going on!

2280
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:00,400
It is not a meaningless
tradition but..

2281
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:02,520
..indeed a very meaningful
tradition!

2282
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:07,200
If it was meaningless it cannot
last for centuries!

2283
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:33,800
The tunes of flowing
River Reva echos..

2284
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:42,360
..the sounds of ancient sages!

2285
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:46,200
I love watching this daughter
of Mekal in the..

2286
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:49,200
..day and I am fond of its
sound in the night!

2287
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:51,760
If it is a visual to
be seen in the day..

2288
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:53,840
..and the music to
be heard at night!

2289
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:58,240
In the day it is Narmada
and at night its Reva!

2290
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:02,600
In your sound of the flow the
voices of sages are blended!

2291
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:06,840
In your sound of the flow the
voices of sages are blended!

2292
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:11,160
In the day you are Narmada
and at night you are Reva!

2293
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:18,240
In the day you are Narmada
and at night you are Reva!

2294
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:23,600
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2295
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:28,160
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2296
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:32,280
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2297
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:37,080
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2298
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:42,920
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2299
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:47,360
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2300
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:51,680
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2301
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:56,920
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2302
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:58,920
Welcome sir! Welcome!

2303
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:01,440
Please have some tea made with
milk of mother Narmada!

2304
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:06,920
Mother Narmada's milk?
-Yes! My cow's name is 'Narmada'!

2305
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:08,560
Oh....I see!

2306
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,760
I was just closing my
shop in the evening!

2307
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:13,840
But it seems this last cup
was meant for you only!

2308
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:15,320
Take it! -Thank you!

2309
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,400
Are you going on a Parikrama?

2310
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:21,600
Hmmm....Yes!

2311
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,960
Me and my cow Narmada also have
completed a Parikrama!

2312
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:26,120
This cow has completed
a Parikrama?

2313
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:29,720
Yes! When we started from
Amarkantak she was a little calf.

2314
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,080
By the time we reached
the end of the..

2315
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:32,920
..Parikrama near sea
it became a cow!

2316
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:36,600
Right! But now the Chaturmas.
-Four months of monsoon has started!

2317
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:39,080
Have you made any
arrangements to..

2318
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,600
..stay somewhere at night? -No!
-Then please come at our temple!

2319
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,640
It is located very
near from here!

2320
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:46,200
No, I don't want to stay here!
-Please stay for tonight!

2321
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:48,920
It is evening now and there
is no guarantee..

2322
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,400
..when the rains will start!

2323
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:52,320
And sir..please give
me also a chance..

2324
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:54,000
..to earn a little
sacred goodwill!

2325
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:56,200
Okay! Fine! Let us go!

2326
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,160
Panditji..a pilgrim walking in
a Parikrama has arrived here!

2327
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:12,920
I....I remember you!

2328
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,480
We had met earlier! Right?

2329
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:17,920
Yes! At Dungarpur river bank!

2330
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:21,280
Yah! -You walked all the way
just to check my selfie?

2331
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:24,640
This is a Mahant. -a sage here!

2332
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:26,720
Oh! Hello! -I mean..Namaste
-Nice to meet you!

2333
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:29,240
Anybody who goes for
a Parikrama..

2334
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:31,880
..during a Chaturmas
is our guest!

2335
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,640
Please take bath and
refresh yourself!

2336
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:37,080
Next we'll do evening
prayer and chat!

2337
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,440
Go and tell the cook
to prepare some..

2338
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:43,480
..sweet dish at
night for dinner!

2339
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:51,600
So far the journey ws
smooth but now..

2340
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:53,640
..the area of
Shulpan will start.

2341
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,600
It takes 2-3 days to
pass through that..

2342
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:58,320
..area and we come
across the Kabas.

2343
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:59,440
The tribals!

2344
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:01,160
They loot the pilgrims!

2345
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:02,720
I havent experienced this..

2346
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:04,720
Let me have this
experience too..

2347
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,600
I am not joking my dear friend!

2348
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:07,720
Ask him?

2349
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:10,120
Haven't you been looted by the
Bheels. -the tribal people?

2350
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:14,040
Of course! Not only me but the
had looted my cow also!

2351
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:15,520
All the ornaments that
were there on..

2352
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,000
..my cow were fully
looted by them!

2353
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:19,480
What if they would have looted
the cow also? -I would rather die..

2354
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,960
..than let them take the cow
away. -But don't worry my son!

2355
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:24,640
You need not worry at all!

2356
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:27,200
I am staying here for
last ten years!

2357
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:30,440
I haven't heard even a
single example of a..

2358
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:33,640
..pilgrim who got lost
in the jungles here..

2359
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:38,080
..one or other way,
he gets the shelter!

2360
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:40,480
I will manage
to pass from there!

2361
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:43,280
A pilgrim going on a parikrama
passes from there..

2362
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:46,000
..just like a newborn child
comes out of a womb!

2363
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:47,920
He comes out full
naked from there!

2364
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,960
That is better! It will be as if
one is reborn in a new world!

2365
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:55,760
Destiny and time is stronger
than the human beings indeed!

2366
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,000
Using the same bows and
arrows tribals have..

2367
02:14:58,120 --> 02:14:59,840
..looted even historical
King Arjun!

2368
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:01,520
Looting the pilgrims
is the duty..

2369
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:03,080
..of the tribals and they do it!

2370
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:08,440
The only thing I know
is that whatever..

2371
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:12,720
..I get robbed with returns
to me later!

2372
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:15,960
And even if we don't get
back anything yet..

2373
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:19,000
..Mother Narmada is always
there with us!

2374
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:21,000
Our Mother Narmada
never sleeps..

2375
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:22,720
..and she keeps
flowing smoothly!

2376
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:25,640
May I ask you something?

2377
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:29,960
When you had met me first
time you were an atheist!

2378
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:32,720
You had no faith in
religion that time!

2379
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,320
I don't know about
the religion..

2380
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:36,160
..but I have
developed faith now!

2381
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:42,560
Excellent! Only a true atheist
can become a true believer!

2382
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:46,000
But what so great happened that
you embarked upon a Parikrama?

2383
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:55,120
You....You?

2384
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:58,280
Yes! I am only Kalewali Mother!

2385
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:02,200
And I am the same lady 'Vanita'
who gave birth to Supriya!

2386
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:06,040
And now I have become a Mother
of this whole jungle!

2387
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:09,280
How you became Kalewali Mother
-a nun!

2388
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:11,480
Circumstances!

2389
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:17,440
What kind of circumstances
forced you..

2390
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:21,120
..to stay away from your
daughter and your husband?

2391
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:27,040
Supriya's father had convened
a very big musical..

2392
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:29,720
..concert at the time
of her birth!

2393
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:32,240
In the morning I heard
the sound of..

2394
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:33,800
..an infant wailing
very strongly!

2395
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:36,560
I saw that a big Jackal
was snatching..

2396
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:40,200
..a little child deep
into the forest!

2397
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:44,400
I chased that Jackal
in the jungle!

2398
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:49,120
The Jackal perhaps saw
a danger in me and..

2399
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:53,640
..it dropped the child
and vanished!

2400
02:16:56,960 --> 02:17:01,160
I lifted that infant in my arms!

2401
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:07,280
That poor child was crying and
yelling because of pain!

2402
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:11,200
So I tried to calm it down!

2403
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,400
But the villagers who
came running there..

2404
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:24,400
..thought that I was
eating that child!

2405
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:28,720
They assumed that an evil
spirit had entered in me!

2406
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:37,360
So just like Puriya
preparations..

2407
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:41,480
..were started to burn me alive!

2408
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:45,080
But the 'Kalewali Mother'
of my times..

2409
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:47,760
..saved me and brought me here!

2410
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:51,640
I am really sorry for that!

2411
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:56,160
Supriya's father Suren now
had the responsibility..

2412
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:57,720
..of a single parent of Supriya!

2413
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:00,400
My beloved Supriya
had a mother but..

2414
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:03,760
..still she had to
live without me..

2415
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,880
..you both suffered from
such grave miseries..

2416
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:08,680
..just for the sake of
an unknown child!

2417
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,360
By the way,
did that child survive?

2418
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:15,680
Yes!
Do you know how this mark on..

2419
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:17,240
..your forearm came into being?

2420
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:29,960
Give everything
that you possess!

2421
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:40,360
Remove your clothes also!

2422
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:49,960
Don't take that!

2423
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:53,680
Don't take that!

2424
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:55,560
Give me that!

2425
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:57,400
Please give that back to me!

2426
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:37,440
You cleanse lakhs of sins
with your river body..

2427
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:40,520
..which is beautifully decorated
by lakhs of swans.

2428
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,160
In that holy place..

2429
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:44,280
..you give both prosperity
as well as..

2430
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:46,360
..liberation to the
humans and animals.

2431
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:48,840
The presence of Brahma..

2432
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:51,360
..Vishnu and Shankara
in your holy river..

2433
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:53,680
..body provides the
protective shield.

2434
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:55,400
O devi Narmada..

2435
02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:00,720
..I bow down to your lotus feet,
please give me your refuge.

2436
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:10,560
By this time he must
have crossed the..

2437
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:12,280
..tribal's area during
the parikrama..

2438
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:50,840
..you have instilled faith
in the hearts of many..

2439
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:54,880
..you have instilled faith
in the hearts of many..

2440
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:57,320
..and took away all
the pain and..

2441
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:59,360
..agony with your
flowing water..

2442
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:02,680
..and took away all
the pain and..

2443
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:06,320
..agony with your flowing water.

2444
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:12,160
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2445
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:16,760
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2446
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,040
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2447
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:25,720
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2448
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:31,360
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2449
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:36,400
Mother Reva, you flow so swiftly
with your pure water!

2450
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:40,680
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2451
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:45,520
You flow so swiftly with
your pure water!

2452
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,400
In this world..

2453
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:20,480
..the one who is..

2454
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:22,000
..humble, seeker, kind, generous,,
sacred, peaceful, balanced.

2455
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,080
As well as protector of unity..

2456
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:27,120
..alone deserves to seek
final emancipation!

2457
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:35,680
What mark is this
on your forearm?

2458
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,400
The Jackal had caught hold of
you here at the forearm!

2459
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:46,360
The marks of the wound
on your forearm used..

2460
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,080
..to make you cry out
of severe pain!

2461
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:51,920
To hide those marks
I tattooed the..

2462
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:55,240
..symbol of the 'Saath-Saali'!

2463
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,680
That means it is because
of me you and Supriya..

2464
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:12,240
..are suffering
from these pains!

2465
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:16,160
You need not feel sad Karan!

2466
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:22,880
I feel all these incidents are
only mere pretexts in life!

2467
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:27,280
This was my destiny!

2468
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:30,720
My parents!

2469
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:34,760
I mean..my mother and father!

2470
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:37,680
You must be surely knowing
who were they?

2471
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:45,560
I don't know who was
your father but..

2472
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:49,640
..your mother is River Narmada!

2473
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:52,280
Three years before this
incident of the..

2474
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:56,080
..Jackal you were found
to your grandpa..

2475
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:58,200
..while he was travelling
while doing..

2476
02:23:58,280 --> 02:23:59,960
..his parikrama of
the River Narmada!

2477
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:09,560
That means grandfather has hidden
many things from me in life!

2478
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:14,560
Didn't you hide from others your
true motive of coming here?

2479
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:23,280
Your grandfather was afraid
that after you..

2480
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:27,560
..would learn the truth
you would go away!

2481
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,240
That is why he kept it a secret!

2482
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,640
Karan, always
remember one thing!

2483
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:40,680
If your grandfather wouldn't
have adopted you..

2484
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:45,760
..then you'd have become
a tribal today!

2485
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:48,880
Or you would have
been eaten by..

2486
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,800
..some wild animal
in the jungle!

2487
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,760
Destiny has donated you a
chance to survive twice!

2488
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,960
There must be some
reason for that!

2489
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:03,400
Even after this if you feel..

2490
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:06,875
..you alone hold the right over
your grandfather's property then..

2491
02:25:07,543 --> 02:25:10,560
..go back to your country and
take away all the wealth!

2492
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:15,520
Perhaps this alone could be
the desire of Mother Reva!

2493
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,520
Mother Narmada may bless us all!

2494
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:50,360
All my expectations from life
were proved false by you!

2495
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,280
Now I can understand..

2496
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:59,160
That all these incidents
were mere pretexts!

2497
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:02,600
Just to bring me here!

2498
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:05,120
But as long as I don't
experience..

2499
02:26:05,960 --> 02:26:09,640
..you even I will
not go from here!

2500
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:13,560
I won't believe in.

2501
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:39,520
In this world, the one who is,.

2502
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:43,760
Humble,.

2503
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:48,160
Seeker,.

2504
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,120
Kind,.

2505
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:57,720
Generous,.

2506
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,480
Sacred,.

2507
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,400
Peaceful,.

2508
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:08,360
Balanced.

2509
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:14,240
As well as protector of unity,.

2510
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:17,160
Alone deserves to seek
final emancipation!

2511
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:46,920
Hello Mehta-uncle? How are you?

2512
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,840
Hey Karan?
How are you my boy now?

2513
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:51,120
I am fine! Can you see?

2514
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:53,080
Shastriji's herbal medicine
has made..

2515
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:54,840
..my recovery very fast indeed!
-How nice!

2516
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:56,320
The place where all of
you had found me!

2517
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:58,920
From the same place I am going
to resume my parikrama again!

2518
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:01,280
And don't worry about
me because even..

2519
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:02,960
..Supriya is going
to join me now!

2520
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:06,680
Bye for now!

2521
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:11,600
Normally pilgrims begin the
journey of the Parikrama..

2522
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:14,240
..from a temple or
famous river bank!

2523
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:19,080
But why are we beginning the
Parikrama from this place?

2524
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,040
Because your faith was true!

2525
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:32,840
That day when all of you found
me here while being ill!

2526
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:34,040
Before that!

2527
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,360
Take this and eat!

2528
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:45,760
Take this and eat!

2529
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:51,200
Take this and eat!

2530
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:56,920
Who are you?

2531
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,320
Reva..!
