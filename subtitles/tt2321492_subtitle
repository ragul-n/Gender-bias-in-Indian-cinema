1
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:35,357
A peacock feather in his
hair and a winning smile

2
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:42,996
He is fun, he plays the flute

3
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:49,935
A peacock feather in his
hair and a winning smile

4
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:53,813
... his friend Radha calls him Shyam

5
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:57,650
These old legends of
the little hero...

6
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:02,715
have passed into folk tales

7
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,989
Hey Krishna...

8
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:10,756
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

9
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:14,793
Hey Krishna...

10
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:18,864
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

11
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:30,275
The blue-skinned boy
who tended his flock...

12
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:34,050
He has many names,
he plays divine music

13
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,886
and he has been
worshipped down the ages

14
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:43,297
Such are the old legends
that have passed into folk tales

15
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,395
Hey Krishna...

16
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:51,463
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

17
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,341
Hey Krishna...

18
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:59,075
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

19
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:03,650
In a village on the banks of
Yamuna ... there it all began

20
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:09,853
It was in those meadows his
flocks grazed and his flute played

21
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:14,329
In a village on the banks of
Yamuna ... there it all began

22
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:18,333
It was in those meadows his
flocks grazed and his flute played

23
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:22,030
And the notes of his
flute rose in the air

24
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:25,730
making melodies we so love to hear

25
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,935
of how little Krishna...

26
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:29,775
won the hearts of men and
how he stole their butter...

27
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,681
and the songs tell of his strength,
how he moved mountains with a finger

28
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:39,316
Hey Krishna...

29
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,382
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

30
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,918
Hey Krishna...

31
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:50,831
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

32
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:10,869
Butterfly...

33
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:14,439
What is that thing?
- A rising storm?

34
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,883
Look at it... coming in.
- Will it rain?

35
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,853
Is it... the earth rumbling?

36
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:27,261
Look at that cloud...
Let it rain, let it rain...

37
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,957
Not a raincloud...

38
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,794
A cloud of dust... armies?

39
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:39,606
Armies...?
- Yes, it is an army

40
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:47,882
Run... run for your lives... now!

41
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:51,580
The murderous Prince of Mathura!

42
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,756
Go... run away, while you can...

43
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,529
Run...

44
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:22,476
Chanur... Mustik... let the hunt begin

45
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:27,581
It was the era of evil,

46
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:31,926
an age of sin

47
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:35,453
Greedy kings and their
bloodthirsty armies...

48
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,523
unleashed terror

49
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,001
and in the blood of
countless innocent people..

50
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,330
..this earth was drenched...

51
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:49,504
and in songs and stories of those
who were wounded and made slaves,

52
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,572
the legends and
histories of this world were told

53
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,648
Start the fires...

54
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,235
Round them up

55
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,340
Into the cages

56
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,916
Please Prince, show us mercy...

57
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:42,560
..do not take our food,
don't take our cattle...

58
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:47,592
do not leave us to starve to death

59
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:54,633
Please, at least not our children...
please Mercy prince... mercy

60
00:07:57,313 --> 00:08:02,512
I am Kans... what I
fancy is mine to take

61
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:05,817
Hurry!

62
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:59,566
Is there no end to our pain?

63
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,673
When will this torture stop?

64
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:08,278
When will You send us a savior?

65
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:10,481
When...?

66
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:28,461
Out of our way...

67
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:31,336
The Prince is coming home

68
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,288
Victory to Prince Kans

69
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:54,956
Long live prince Kans

70
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:58,626
Long live prince Kans
- Back to work, slaves

71
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:02,634
Don't drop the bag of cement

72
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,297
Do work.

73
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:47,442
My power is so great, my
rule will spread beyond Mathura

74
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:50,315
And the whole world will
become the kingdom of Kans

75
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,320
I shall shatter the peace of heavens..

76
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:55,585
..and I shall
unleash the furies of hell

77
00:10:55,658 --> 00:11:00,652
and history will speak
of how I thrust my sword..

78
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:03,732
..into the heart of the earth

79
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,860
This, the world's biggest stadium..

80
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:09,929
..will become a symbol of my greatness

81
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:14,306
If it is not finished by
the time of my coronation,

82
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:17,574
then, you slaves will be buried
alive under the sands of this arena

83
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,878
And your bones will be
mixed with the concrete

84
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:30,552
Put the new slaves to work

85
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,322
Double the working shifts

86
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,728
And halve the rations

87
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,418
Kans' cruelty reflects...

88
00:11:56,486 --> 00:12:01,583
my failure as a parent

89
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:05,290
In Mathura, I Emperor Ugrasen...

90
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,921
stand reduced to a helpless father

91
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:12,263
But Uncle, cousin Kans is so caring...

92
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:15,964
he always remembers to bring me gifts

93
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,770
He is always worried
about my safety, protection

94
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:24,302
I know, Devaki. But
I am afraid that...

95
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,377
after you're married
and gone from here..

96
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:30,509
..he might abandon all human values

97
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:35,756
But please, you must never abandon him

98
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:40,656
For he is to be the king of our clan

99
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:44,365
I can only hope and pray that..

100
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:47,892
..he doesn't destroy the other clans

101
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:50,805
He is the sum total
of my fears, Devaki

102
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:55,842
It's a fragile peace
between warring clans...

103
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:59,575
Your marriage with Prince Vasudev..

104
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,311
..promises to be the
first alliance for peace

105
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:06,645
Eighteen warring clans will be united

106
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,495
This is the beginning of
my dream for a golden age

107
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:14,928
But..

108
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,596
Cousin Kans...

109
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:20,502
it's got to be you

110
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,472
Devaki, you are the apple of my eye

111
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,038
But I find it so hard to believe...

112
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:32,475
..that you are getting
married and leaving us

113
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:55,370
Live a long and healthy life

114
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:01,003
I had promised your father..

115
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:06,674
..that you will be given a
wedding fit for a princess of Mathura

116
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,775
I have fulfilled my promise

117
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,854
Akrur, won't you bless Devaki?

118
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,452
Live happily

119
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,894
May you have mighty sons

120
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,801
Dear cousin...

121
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:34,669
Everyone in Mathura
will miss you, Devaki

122
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,543
Vasudev...

123
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:46,421
I give her to you. She
is as dear to me as life

124
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:51,692
Therefore care for her as I have

125
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:56,330
Never bring her any sorrow

126
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,526
Her wish is my command

127
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,302
Hey...

128
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,598
climb down

129
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:05,800
I shall drive the bride's chariot

130
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:15,307
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

131
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:18,842
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

132
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:22,357
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

133
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,950
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

134
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:28,258
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

135
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:31,892
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

136
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:35,597
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

137
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:39,334
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

138
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:42,605
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

139
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,839
Beware Kans...

140
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:22,977
know this... the one whom
you are saying goodbye to...

141
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:26,580
the eighth son of this very Devaki...

142
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:29,453
will kill you

143
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,704
Her child will be my undoing?

144
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,537
I cannot allow this
prophecy to be true...

145
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:50,375
..to let her son be born
so that he can kill me...?

146
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:53,006
Never... never...

147
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,748
Devaki,

148
00:16:55,818 --> 00:17:01,313
forgive me, forgive
me my dearest cousin

149
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:11,898
Kans..?

150
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:21,943
No Kans... no!

151
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:27,439
If your life is to be the
cause of my death Devaki...

152
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,542
..then in your death is my life

153
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,280
Kans, stop

154
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:34,684
This is Devaki... she is a woman...

155
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:36,622
..and she is your cousin

156
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,020
... and we are Just-married

157
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,723
Holding a knife on her...

158
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:45,023
..doesn't suit... a
great warrior like you

159
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:48,725
It's her tough luck.
I must do what I must

160
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,967
Then I am bound to
defend my wife, Kans

161
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,305
And remember...

162
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,868
if I am forced to raise my sword,

163
00:17:56,946 --> 00:18:00,507
..then your clan and mine are at war..

164
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,677
..and my allies are
also at war with you

165
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:06,244
Are you threatening me, Vasudev?

166
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:07,687
No! He isn't threatening

167
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,883
Please! Have mercy upon us...

168
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:15,222
Should I invite my death?

169
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,958
No!

170
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:24,737
Neither I nor Devaki
will cause of your death ...

171
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,275
..it is the eighth son

172
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:30,944
I..

173
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,915
I give you my word...

174
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:38,276
Each of Devaki's sons,
as soon as they are born,

175
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:40,915
I shall give to you

176
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:47,826
You are truthful and a
man of honor, Vasudev

177
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:51,663
But as long as I am alive,

178
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:56,364
you shall remain my prisoner

179
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,831
Soldier...

180
00:18:57,907 --> 00:18:59,670
As you wish, my Lord

181
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:11,638
Kans has imprisoned his cousin..

182
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:14,511
..and her husband

183
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,051
It's because of that prophecy...

184
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:21,313
..that Devaki's
eighth son, will kill Kans

185
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:28,792
How cruel of him... to throw a
newly-wedded couple into the dungeons

186
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:32,925
How could he be so heartless...
this son of Ugrasen?

187
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:35,402
The list of his
misdeeds grows longer...

188
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:39,339
it's said that Kans
has angered his father

189
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:50,347
This would've Qualified
for a death sentence..

190
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:53,950
..this betrayal borders on treason

191
00:20:54,857 --> 00:20:58,486
but a crown prince is given
a chance to defend himself

192
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:03,625
I shall defend myself by the
might of my sword, Your MaJesty

193
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:07,863
The blade that got rid
of Mathura's enemies..

194
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:13,307
..will be my defense in
the face of your charges

195
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:18,403
What you have done is not
only unJust, it Is a sin

196
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:23,284
Self defence is
every warrior's right...

197
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,014
If that doesn't satisfy your Question,

198
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:32,716
you may also retire to a prison,
to debate good and bad in peace

199
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:35,764
Are you threatening me...
threatening your father...?

200
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:37,890
How dare you threaten the emperor?

201
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:43,871
Not threatening, dear Father...
I advise you to be careful

202
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:54,378
Akrur, now I wish that
I never had this son...

203
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:58,412
I am a total failure as a father..

204
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,786
..Or, is he a punishment for my sins?

205
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:05,686
Keep faith, Your MaJesty

206
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:10,562
The night is darkest Just
before the beginning of a new dawn

207
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:35,820
Who is more unfortunate than I...

208
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:42,723
..to spend my
wedding night in prison...

209
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,961
Nothing can happen
against God's will, Devaki

210
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:52,036
It is possible that this life is
prison may mean freedom for many

211
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:03,846
What does Vasudev's
clan think of themselves?

212
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,387
For Vasudev's sake...

213
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:09,652
they are willing to
pick a fight with you?

214
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:13,525
If the stupid subJects of
our kingdom support this idea..

215
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:16,723
..it can become a dangerous situation

216
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,728
Use the fear of an attack,
declare emergency...

217
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:25,399
..in the name of
security of the state...

218
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:31,310
and imprison everyone who
sympathizes with Devaki and Vasudev

219
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,406
And hang anyone who dares to oppose us

220
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:37,417
Hang them

221
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:59,033
Victory to King Kans

222
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:01,902
Victory to King Kans

223
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:04,707
Long live the king

224
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:57,354
Your MaJesty, a holy
man wants to meet you

225
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:01,358
A holy man? In the kingdom of Kans?

226
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:05,501
I warned him that the king
has ordered all holy men..

227
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:07,633
..to leave the kingdom

228
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,374
And...?

229
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:13,972
He said, tell the
king that Narad has come

230
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,781
Narad? Why did'nt you
tell me earlier, you fool?

231
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:21,916
Narad is a devotee of
Lord Vishnu, my enemy

232
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,855
He is worth my time
if I can find out..

233
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:28,863
..what Lord Vishnu
is plotting against me

234
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,497
Praised be the Lord

235
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:35,662
Praised be the Lord

236
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,678
A devotee of Lord Vishnu in
the kingdom of his biggest enemy?

237
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:50,975
Are you so scared of me
that you have left him..

238
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:53,544
..to Join me?

239
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:57,786
One who sees God's
presence everywhere has no fear

240
00:25:58,026 --> 00:26:00,654
I have come to advise you..

241
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:06,223
..that the very God you
want to fight lives within you

242
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:11,534
All that lives
within me is my ambition.

243
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:15,543
You are certainly a mighty king.

244
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:18,580
But both the mightiest
and the wisest know that..

245
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:25,779
the power of life and
death is in God's hands.

246
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,931
Your MaJesty...

247
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,497
I have come to make good my promise

248
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,434
Here is my first born...

249
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,269
my son

250
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:50,841
I am unfortunate that..

251
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:59,620
..I can not feel happy at his birth

252
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,224
Narad, you see...

253
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:07,490
The life of this baby is in my hands

254
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:13,592
Nothing that you say
about morals can stop me

255
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:16,001
I can do whatever I want

256
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:26,340
Bring me your eighth son...
I am waiting...

257
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:38,258
I shall forever be
grateful for your kindness

258
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:45,524
Now tell me Narad, who is more
powerful? Me or Lord Vishnu?

259
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:51,296
As you can see, I even control Death

260
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,366
Such pride is not good Kans

261
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:59,642
Lord Vishnu rules all creation

262
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:01,910
Time also follows His design

263
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:05,886
Oppose Him and you invite destruction

264
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:08,388
While there is still time,
change your ways..

265
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:13,451
..and seek forgiveness from the Lord

266
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,991
For Kans, there is no God!

267
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:24,664
Kans rules Earth by his might

268
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:29,233
Soon, I shall also conQuer
the skies and heavens...

269
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:37,514
and your Gods and you
god-men will all serve me as slaves

270
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:41,882
Then instead of singing
the praises of the Lord..

271
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:44,792
..you will all sing my praises.

272
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,889
Your ignorance is your misfortune

273
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:56,533
To protect His disciples,
to destroy the likes of you,

274
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:59,472
The Lord has decided to assume
human form and appear on earth

275
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:02,942
That time is at hand,
and reJoicing has begun

276
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:06,280
The Gods are
descending on earth as humans.

277
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:11,911
In the time ahead, your
death waits. Mark, my words

278
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,688
But by the time you
realise your mistakes..

279
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:18,317
..it will already be too late for you

280
00:29:38,814 --> 00:29:42,875
Your MaJesty, there's no
point in taking Narad seriously

281
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:46,784
He's only good at twisting facts

282
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:52,292
You are our emperor,
your life is precious

283
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,730
What value is a child's life,
compared to yours?

284
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,395
MaJesty, this waiting
for the eighth son means..

285
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:05,262
..giving death seven
chances to cheat you

286
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:06,706
But of course!

287
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:12,042
Odds are, that the first son
could be as dangerous as the eighth

288
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:33,934
I knew it! Kans can never be so cruel!

289
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,800
I was the apple of his eye...

290
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:40,774
that makes you his dearest nephew

291
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,323
Oh... it's you...!

292
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,426
His MaJesty has been kind...
has he come to set us free...?

293
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,798
Yes!

294
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:11,898
Has my son brought us our freedom...?

295
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:18,410
Couldn't stay away
from the little one...

296
00:31:18,947 --> 00:31:20,676
..so I thought, let's pay him a visit

297
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:24,613
Yes, our son is so lovable..

298
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,485
I could keep on
looking at him forever..

299
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:31,053
Look at him glowing,
like the full moon

300
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:34,057
A good comparison...
your little one...

301
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:37,595
is like the moon,
about to be eclipsed...

302
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:38,826
But... what...?

303
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,803
Your son and I are linked by destiny

304
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:47,408
For me, he is death...
and I mean death for him.

305
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,966
You said that you'd spare his life...

306
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,036
..because, he's our first born

307
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:02,482
In this lotus, which
petal is number one..

308
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:05,492
..and which is the eighth...?
Who can say...?

309
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:09,263
Clockwise, the first
is also the eighth..

310
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:12,289
..counter clockwise the
eighth is also the first

311
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:16,269
Any petal can be that number eight

312
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:20,832
That's why each of your
sons can mean my death

313
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:22,671
Give him up

314
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:25,941
No... no...

315
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:29,781
Spare my son!

316
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:32,945
Don't...

317
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:36,743
When the earth is scorched

318
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:46,378
sing a song of hope

319
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,622
For our darkest of times

320
00:34:53,695 --> 00:35:01,966
there's a song of hope

321
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:08,501
For our world to be a nicer place

322
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:12,606
For life without sorrow's traces

323
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:16,576
For the darkness to be lit...

324
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:21,481
that the Sun may shine upon us...
Open your heart, let him in

325
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:23,387
So let us reJoice...

326
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:24,981
in prayer and songs

327
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,752
of love...

328
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:30,992
So awaken, arise...

329
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:32,995
make a wish and pray

330
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:36,760
that He may come unto us

331
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,503
It is He, and he is coming
and our world is changing

332
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:54,586
Open your heart, let him
in Feel the warm glow within

333
00:35:55,323 --> 00:36:02,422
Let Him in, let Him touch your heart

334
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:10,693
Wipe your tears and feel the love

335
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:47,308
Feel the love in hills and seas,
clouds of hope and rain

336
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:51,574
Songs of birds and cricket's cheer,
let's fall in love again

337
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:59,277
And once you've found peace,
you must make a wish...

338
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:03,551
For him to be with you
and you with him, always

339
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,493
Sung in the music of the singing bees

340
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:11,293
All songs of prayer, of hope, of love

341
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:18,602
It's that someone, and he is
coming and our world is changing

342
00:37:19,307 --> 00:37:26,839
Open your heart, let him
in Feel the warm glow within

343
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:34,687
Let it in, let it
touch your heart and smile...

344
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:42,856
smile and feel the
love... love... love... love...

345
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:19,256
Give up sadness n despair,
go and speak the word of hope

346
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:23,634
Tell them the world's changing,
tell em it's the power of love

347
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:31,301
In faith and belief, hope and prayer,
sing songs of Joy and cheer

348
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:35,645
it's the advent, it's Him, it's
the coming, the avataar of hope

349
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:39,551
ln times of Despair,
nine times before, in nine...

350
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:43,387
ages of man, He was with us,
now He comes again

351
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:50,796
It's that someone, and he is
coming and our world is changing

352
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:58,669
Open your heart, let him
in Feel the warm glow within

353
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,812
Let Him in, let Him touch your
heart Wipe your tears and feel the love

354
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:14,811
Let Him in, let Him touch your
heart Wipe your tears and feel the love

355
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:50,815
Vasudev... Devaki...

356
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,349
Do not fear

357
00:40:53,921 --> 00:41:00,850
You have worshipped
me for many lifetimes

358
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,728
Because of your devotion..

359
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:08,997
..I am to be born to you as a son

360
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:30,051
Vasudev, do not hesitate

361
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,886
Put me in a basket,
cross the river Yamuna..

362
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,360
..take me to Gokul, the
village of the cowherds

363
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:40,492
There, find Nanda's wife Yashoda.
She has given birth to a baby girl

364
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:45,871
Yashoda is tired and fast asleep

365
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,738
Put me down right beside her,

366
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,745
pick up her daughter
and bring her here

367
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:54,441
Quickly now, Vasudev

368
00:42:14,468 --> 00:42:16,993
What a miracle this is, Devaki

369
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:20,468
At this darkest hour of night...

370
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:24,409
with the monsoon rains
wreaking havoc outside...

371
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:26,639
we seemed to have no choice ..

372
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:30,012
..but to witness the inevitable
murder of our eighth child...

373
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:32,711
in such dire circumstance...

374
00:42:32,787 --> 00:42:34,846
our son has been born

375
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:51,596
It's a daughter!

376
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,365
My son would have
been a danger for you!

377
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:57,876
Kill me if you wish,
but spare her life

378
00:47:57,945 --> 00:48:02,473
Spare her life, spare her life

379
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:09,479
Be it boy or a girl, Death never
differentiates. Why must I...?

380
00:48:10,758 --> 00:48:12,225
No Kans no...

381
00:48:12,293 --> 00:48:13,590
Please don't...

382
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:20,958
Foolish Kans!

383
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,227
You will get nothing by killing me

384
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,969
Your nemesis has been born

385
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,708
The world's savior has arrived

386
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,544
God has descended on Earth.

387
00:48:34,648 --> 00:48:38,709
It's a certain end
for sinners like you

388
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:25,789
Pootna

389
00:49:43,017 --> 00:49:49,252
Stay away! Stay away from me

390
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:56,262
I'm bad and very evil

391
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,289
Better be afraid of me

392
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:09,836
Stay away! Stay away from me

393
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,274
I'm bad and very evil

394
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,871
Better be afraid of me

395
00:50:14,948 --> 00:50:17,542
That's the venom..

396
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:20,382
on my breath

397
00:50:20,454 --> 00:50:22,888
And the things I do...

398
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:25,754
will drive you to death

399
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,590
So keep the babies away from me

400
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:31,927
I'm the evil woman

401
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:00,654
I deal in black magic,

402
00:51:00,761 --> 00:51:03,958
evil spells,

403
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:11,398
I deal in black magic,

404
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:13,940
evil spells,

405
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,601
evil spirits

406
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,871
even death

407
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:20,413
I cast spells

408
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:21,879
to kill babies

409
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,474
I'm the mother of terror

410
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:27,315
I have destroyed, uprooted,

411
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:29,913
sent men to terrible deaths

412
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:35,320
So keep the babies away from me

413
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,921
I'm evil in every breath

414
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:43,300
Stay away! Stay away from me

415
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:45,736
I'm bad and very evil

416
00:51:45,806 --> 00:51:48,934
Better be afraid of me

417
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:15,893
It's the poison in me that kills

418
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:25,937
It's my poison that kills...

419
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:31,315
the simplest who are seduced

420
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:32,545
I cast spells

421
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,950
to kill

422
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:36,455
I'm the mother of evil

423
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:39,321
I have destroyed, uprooted,

424
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:41,987
sent men to terrible deaths

425
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:47,392
Stay away! Stay away from me

426
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:50,561
I'm bad and very evil

427
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:55,007
That's the venom..

428
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:57,873
on my breath

429
00:52:57,945 --> 00:53:00,539
And the things I do...

430
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:03,378
will drive you to death

431
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,010
So keep the babies away from me

432
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,811
I'm bad and very evil

433
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:22,792
Pootna

434
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:27,898
Kans...? It's been so long...

435
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:49,385
O'mighty Kans, what
pleasures do you desire?

436
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:53,627
My death has come in the form
of a boy, he must be killed.

437
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,793
Only one boy...?

438
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,536
A few hundred and it's
somewhat worth my time

439
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:08,947
A few thousand means good money..

440
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:12,776
..and some Job satisfaction

441
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:22,691
Fun for me begins... when I'm
counting in hundreds of thousands

442
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:25,288
But one child...?

443
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:30,029
Mighty Kans, I am Pootna remember?

444
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,831
The one and only evil
witch with breasts..

445
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:39,311
..that produce poison, not milk

446
00:54:39,513 --> 00:54:41,037
Poison

447
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:42,846
Stay

448
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:49,416
My target is a lone baby,
but he is not an ordinary boy

449
00:54:49,523 --> 00:54:51,889
This is ordained

450
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:58,797
So you have to kill all boys
born in the last ten days.

451
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:09,738
Now, I'll have some fun

452
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:39,396
No! Don't take my baby away!

453
00:55:39,573 --> 00:55:42,906
Are there any more left?

454
00:55:55,278 --> 00:55:56,802
Welcome

455
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:00,878
Thank you for coming

456
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:04,319
Vrishabhan...

457
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:06,015
Good to have you here

458
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:07,556
Welcome, lady

459
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,917
Congratulations on
the birth of your son.

460
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:11,956
How is Yashoda?

461
00:56:12,028 --> 00:56:14,292
They're fine... please go inside

462
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:19,897
All well?

463
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:22,162
The Lord is kind

464
00:56:22,272 --> 00:56:24,263
My congratulations , Nand

465
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:25,433
Thanks

466
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:28,568
I hope you too will have a baby soon

467
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:32,439
We have been hoping for years

468
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:33,607
And waiting...

469
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,114
We leave it in God's hands

470
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:38,017
God will answer your prayers

471
00:56:38,088 --> 00:56:40,420
He always does

472
00:56:53,837 --> 00:56:57,534
Garg, you are wise
and can see the future

473
00:56:57,807 --> 00:56:59,138
Bless my son, give him a name.

474
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:02,143
And tell us what the
future holds for him

475
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:19,121
How can I see the future of
a child who will influence..

476
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:22,926
..the future of man till eternity?

477
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,300
Mark my words

478
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:29,129
Born at midnight on
August's Wednesday..

479
00:57:29,272 --> 00:57:32,070
..that eighth night in the
cycle of the waning moon..

480
00:57:32,142 --> 00:57:35,339
..your son will find a
following amongst men..

481
00:57:35,545 --> 00:57:37,410
..as a shepherd to mankind.

482
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,210
He will lead men to a
higher consciousness.

483
00:57:40,283 --> 00:57:45,084
Therefore, I name him Krishna

484
00:57:51,361 --> 00:57:53,989
Krishna... my angel

485
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:04,032
I'm going with you

486
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:09,401
Balram, who will take
care of Little Krishna?

487
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:12,312
When I am away, you will
be the man of the house.

488
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:14,315
Krishna is Just a baby.

489
00:58:16,486 --> 00:58:21,583
I will settle the taxes in
Mathura and return soon.

490
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:43,009
I have heard that a
demon is kidnapping children

491
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:44,603
Goodness!

492
00:58:44,848 --> 00:58:47,476
And the King is doing nothing about it

493
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:50,782
Hey, keep an eye on Krishna

494
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,788
Sure, I will

495
00:58:52,856 --> 00:58:56,223
Don't let him out of your sight

496
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:57,987
I won't

497
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,265
You were doing Just fine...

498
00:59:12,575 --> 00:59:14,543
what happened all of a sudden?

499
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:17,970
All right hush, I'll call your mother

500
00:59:39,436 --> 00:59:44,373
Shut the door... my husband is away
and there's no man in the house...

501
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:51,847
Who are you?

502
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:54,879
I'm a celestial maiden

503
00:59:55,085 --> 01:00:00,113
I was passing by and I
saw your lovely baby

504
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:03,455
So, I stopped by to give my blessings

505
01:00:03,526 --> 01:00:06,518
As you might know..

506
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:11,460
..demons are
kidnapping and killing babies

507
01:00:11,835 --> 01:00:14,895
My breast milk has the elixir of life

508
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:18,506
If your son feeds at my breast..

509
01:00:19,008 --> 01:00:23,172
..no body will be able to harm him.

510
01:00:37,127 --> 01:00:40,460
Drink child, drink

511
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:44,555
It's the elixir of life

512
01:00:46,236 --> 01:00:52,266
Just drink my milk and you
will be... free from life!

513
01:00:52,342 --> 01:00:56,904
Forever free...

514
01:01:05,388 --> 01:01:07,322
Let go of me...

515
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:10,526
Let go of me...

516
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:16,261
Krishna.. Somebody help!

517
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:26,399
Somebody help!

518
01:01:29,078 --> 01:01:32,104
Looks like...

519
01:01:32,182 --> 01:01:37,347
..it's Krishna who
has got her instead.

520
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,411
Save my baby!

521
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:57,764
Krishna...

522
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:01,271
Krishna...

523
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:03,509
Krishna...

524
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,042
Krishna...

525
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:07,073
My precious little one...

526
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:28,836
At long last... our
prayers are answered

527
01:02:29,439 --> 01:02:34,467
God has sent us a
precious little Jewel

528
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:40,544
You can't imagine how happy we were

529
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,580
to find this pretty
creature lying on a lotus bed..

530
01:02:45,955 --> 01:02:50,824
..floating down the river

531
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:55,189
So beautiful, so exQuisite...

532
01:02:55,265 --> 01:02:58,996
My friend... tears in a time for Joy?

533
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:03,434
I would've reJoiced at the birth..

534
01:03:03,473 --> 01:03:07,777
..but... it has been
eleven days since, and still...

535
01:03:07,777 --> 01:03:10,268
she has not opened her eyes...

536
01:03:25,028 --> 01:03:27,861
She has opened her eyes!

537
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,366
She opened her eyes
at Krishna's touch!

538
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:39,465
Perhaps your daughter
didn't open her eyes..

539
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:45,811
..because she wanted
to see Krishna first

540
01:03:46,282 --> 01:03:52,915
I want to name her Radha..

541
01:03:53,222 --> 01:03:58,819
..the first devotee of Krishna

542
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:03,292
I don't understand this...

543
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:08,459
how did an infant like
Radha recognise Krishna?

544
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:11,939
Set your mind to it
and it defies logic.

545
01:04:12,008 --> 01:04:15,273
But seek within your
hearts and you may realise...

546
01:04:15,345 --> 01:04:18,508
theirs is an eternal friendship

547
01:04:18,848 --> 01:04:22,784
Your daughter Radha
is no ordinary girl.

548
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:27,415
She is the feminine
expression of the Joy of life

549
01:05:27,283 --> 01:05:31,185
Trinavart

550
01:05:48,805 --> 01:05:54,835
Mighty Kans, what do you wish?

551
01:05:57,814 --> 01:06:03,480
Pootna never returned...
she's gone without a trace...

552
01:06:03,553 --> 01:06:05,817
Trinavart, now you are the
one who will kill the one..

553
01:06:05,855 --> 01:06:07,322
..who intends to kill me

554
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,823
This is my wish

555
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:14,227
Nobody has survived my tornadoes

556
01:06:30,346 --> 01:06:34,942
May my Krishna's arms and his hands..

557
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:40,521
..grow longer, stronger, faster

558
01:06:44,494 --> 01:06:50,160
May my Krishna's legs and his feet..

559
01:06:50,266 --> 01:06:55,294
..grow longer, stronger, faster

560
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:02,000
And God protect you from the evil eye

561
01:07:51,928 --> 01:07:53,327
Help...

562
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:57,796
My baby...

563
01:08:07,977 --> 01:08:10,878
It was strange that a child
should possess such strength,

564
01:08:10,947 --> 01:08:14,075
unimaginable that this
child would come to our rescue

565
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:17,278
It surprised all men
to hear such tales

566
01:08:17,553 --> 01:08:20,386
And thus came to be
Krishna's following

567
01:08:20,856 --> 01:08:23,586
It was strange that a
child could overcome such evil,

568
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:26,920
unimaginable that this
child would challenge tyranny

569
01:08:26,996 --> 01:08:30,090
It surprised all men
to hear of his courage

570
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:33,363
... thus Krishna's
following came to be

571
01:08:46,349 --> 01:08:49,341
It was strange that a
child could overcome such evil,

572
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:52,819
unimaginable that this
child would challenge tyranny

573
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:29,890
My baby...

574
01:09:30,559 --> 01:09:34,518
Thank God!

575
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:56,774
In our village every day

576
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,885
we have seen Krishna at play

577
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:05,885
That lovely little boy...

578
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:10,159
showed us how to move the moon

579
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:14,464
Growing up amongst us,
he makes us think...

580
01:10:14,537 --> 01:10:20,339
if there can be a mystery
in every mischief we see

581
01:10:23,145 --> 01:10:27,514
We have seen him,
everyone has seen him

582
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:31,849
We have seen his miracles at play

583
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:36,358
Oh, let him steal some butter

584
01:10:36,425 --> 01:10:40,953
Let him play his flute

585
01:11:07,089 --> 01:11:09,455
He's blue

586
01:11:09,525 --> 01:11:11,789
He's as Quick as deer

587
01:11:11,827 --> 01:11:15,786
And there's a peacock
feather in his crest

588
01:11:15,865 --> 01:11:18,129
He's always after pots of milk

589
01:11:18,234 --> 01:11:20,327
And he will thrash
anyone who tries to bully us

590
01:11:20,436 --> 01:11:24,463
We're glad he's here with us

591
01:11:25,007 --> 01:11:29,103
Glad to hear his flute,
glad to hear his song

592
01:11:29,178 --> 01:11:33,239
As glad as Radha is,
when she dances to his song

593
01:11:33,315 --> 01:11:37,149
In our village every day

594
01:11:37,486 --> 01:11:41,513
we have seen Krishna at play

595
01:11:41,991 --> 01:11:46,325
Oh, let him steal some butter

596
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:50,991
Let him play his flute

597
01:12:17,092 --> 01:12:19,117
Just imagine that little mite...

598
01:12:19,195 --> 01:12:21,288
has the guts to put up a fight !

599
01:12:21,363 --> 01:12:25,561
Our Krishna is afraid of no one

600
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:28,030
Even his worried mother smiles

601
01:12:28,103 --> 01:12:30,264
And when he laughs,

602
01:12:30,339 --> 01:12:35,208
in that ringing laughter hides,
the whole universe

603
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,044
Glad to hear his flute,
glad to hear his song

604
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:46,117
As glad as Radha is,
when she dances to his song

605
01:12:46,255 --> 01:12:50,191
In our village every day

606
01:12:50,426 --> 01:12:54,522
we have seen Krishna at play

607
01:12:54,897 --> 01:12:59,163
That lovely little boy...

608
01:12:59,235 --> 01:13:04,434
showed us how to move the moon

609
01:13:24,326 --> 01:13:28,126
Where is that enemy of mine...
where is he?

610
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:33,833
Pootna has disappeared

611
01:13:33,903 --> 01:13:35,962
Trinavart has vanished

612
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:40,168
What strange powers protect him?

613
01:13:48,517 --> 01:13:53,318
Bakasur...

614
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:25,910
Look!

615
01:14:43,372 --> 01:14:46,808
Eat ! We have lots more

616
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:24,105
Yashoda is such a
wonderful mother to her children

617
01:15:26,548 --> 01:15:32,487
Krishna is so full of mischief,
but she never loses her temper

618
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:45,491
Duddy if you do as I say...

619
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:50,903
we will get as much
milk to drink as we want!

620
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:13,828
Look at the way she is walking!

621
01:16:13,896 --> 01:16:17,423
She is not walking, she is dancing

622
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:25,433
Looks like she is
going to see her boyfriend

623
01:16:36,518 --> 01:16:40,579
She's so funny, I'm
nearly breathless... but ...

624
01:16:40,856 --> 01:16:44,952
does laughter also
leave you light-headed?

625
01:16:45,494 --> 01:16:49,863
I guess a good laugh
lightens your burden

626
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,470
Hey Krishna...?

627
01:17:03,545 --> 01:17:05,445
Run

628
01:17:05,514 --> 01:17:08,813
Yes, go on, run... hide where you can!

629
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:13,481
Wait till I tell Yashoda...
all about these pranks...

630
01:17:13,555 --> 01:17:16,547
then she is going to take care of you

631
01:17:16,825 --> 01:17:20,955
Krishna you should..

632
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:24,192
..sweet-talk your mother

633
01:17:24,299 --> 01:17:29,896
And get it over with
before these girls turn up

634
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:43,051
Hey Krishna...

635
01:17:44,486 --> 01:17:46,420
Come here my darling...

636
01:17:46,855 --> 01:17:47,913
Come here

637
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,481
Why are you standing there? Come...

638
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:54,120
Mother, I've made a mistake

639
01:17:57,166 --> 01:18:00,192
Mistake? What could my
little Krishna have done!

640
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:06,569
It's all this...
cream... and butter...

641
01:18:07,509 --> 01:18:11,309
Cream and butter?
What's this about? Speak up

642
01:18:12,014 --> 01:18:18,112
I've never seen such delicious cream
and butter in all my life, mother!

643
01:18:19,855 --> 01:18:26,055
You are not even seven years old
and you're talking about life?

644
01:18:27,563 --> 01:18:31,055
You see this cream
and butter every day...

645
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:33,167
Can you give me a little mother?

646
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:38,498
Not now. Wait a bit son,
don't be in a hurry,

647
01:18:38,574 --> 01:18:42,271
Be patient,
everything here is yours ...

648
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:48,077
If you wait the reward will be sweeter

649
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:54,546
It's very difficult to wait
when it's right in front of you

650
01:18:54,790 --> 01:19:00,023
Krishna stop wasting time!

651
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:02,787
Figure a way out!

652
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:05,263
Those girls are right here!

653
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:14,400
Mother I have a Question...

654
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:16,407
So ask...

655
01:19:16,478 --> 01:19:18,878
First you say I've made a mistake.

656
01:19:18,947 --> 01:19:20,505
Then you say... this is the
most delicous cream and butter

657
01:19:20,582 --> 01:19:22,072
you have seen in your life...

658
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:24,482
And now you say you have a Question?

659
01:19:26,188 --> 01:19:29,385
Mother am I not your son?

660
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:32,150
Who has been saying this to you?

661
01:19:32,427 --> 01:19:34,588
You're my little darling

662
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:41,326
They all say you
bought me at the market.

663
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:45,067
Tell me mother, am I not your son?

664
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:48,805
The market? Who dares to say that?

665
01:19:48,944 --> 01:19:51,310
Tell me who ... let
them come in front of me!

666
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,180
Right! Very good! Krishna
deserves to be punished!

667
01:19:55,384 --> 01:19:58,012
Punished? Why would I punish Krishna?

668
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:00,919
He destroyed our
milk-pots and stole the milk

669
01:20:01,223 --> 01:20:06,024
We have all the milk and
cream we'll ever need.

670
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:07,788
Why would Krishna steal?

671
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:09,797
Why would we lie, Yashoda?

672
01:20:09,831 --> 01:20:12,391
Do we enJoy complaining about Krishna?

673
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:16,028
Yashoda, it was certainly him.
This beautiful complexion..

674
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:22,236
..the headfull of curls, the
sweet mischievous smile...

675
01:20:22,311 --> 01:20:26,543
Who else could it be but Krishna?

676
01:20:26,815 --> 01:20:29,511
Mothet they're lying

677
01:20:29,818 --> 01:20:32,252
Look me in the eye and swear that..

678
01:20:32,321 --> 01:20:34,949
..you saw me breaking your pots
and then drinking the milk...?

679
01:20:41,563 --> 01:20:45,829
Yes! Krishna smashed my
milk and drank the pot...

680
01:20:46,335 --> 01:20:49,793
I mean smashed the pot and milk...

681
01:20:49,905 --> 01:20:52,806
No, no, no! The pot was in the milk...

682
01:20:52,874 --> 01:20:56,310
Oh God! What do I do?

683
01:20:56,378 --> 01:21:00,508
I want to say it... I can't say it...

684
01:21:13,562 --> 01:21:16,429
He made us brides
and confused the monkey

685
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:20,127
No, no! Made the
monkey a bride and then...

686
01:21:20,235 --> 01:21:26,504
Oh I can't look at him... I
can't look away... What do we do?

687
01:21:26,575 --> 01:21:30,568
Krishna always puts us in his
spell and manages to get away.

688
01:21:30,812 --> 01:21:31,938
What do we do?

689
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:33,139
Enough, enough

690
01:21:33,248 --> 01:21:35,808
You girls are blaming him for nothing

691
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:39,514
Now go and take fresh
milk from the store. Go...

692
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:48,224
Krishna you also go... you have
to take the cows to the fields.

693
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:46,803
Will you open your eyes, or
shall I open them for you?

694
01:28:40,475 --> 01:28:43,911
In the face of merciless persecution,

695
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:46,971
in the face of violence, hatred,

696
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:02,789
deliver us from evil, oh Lord!

697
01:29:02,831 --> 01:29:08,997
Oh Lord, may Thy kingdom come

698
01:29:49,777 --> 01:29:51,938
Balram... there he is...

699
01:29:55,250 --> 01:30:00,552
This is what you call ''out
of the pan and into the fire''

700
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,786
Find a blanket

701
01:30:06,995 --> 01:30:10,055
Krishna, Jump

702
01:30:10,798 --> 01:30:13,790
I am afraid...

703
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:19,238
Don't be scared.
Jump! We're here for you

704
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:22,976
It is easy to say Jump
when you are standing there.

705
01:30:23,044 --> 01:30:29,381
Looking down from here all I
can think of is broken bones...

706
01:30:46,467 --> 01:30:48,992
Now what?

707
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:52,801
Krishna Just shut your
eyes and take the plunge...

708
01:30:53,308 --> 01:30:54,434
No...

709
01:31:22,537 --> 01:31:25,529
Your destroyer has taken birth...

710
01:31:25,807 --> 01:31:29,436
Your death awaits you

711
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:32,911
The eighth born son
will be your end...

712
01:31:41,289 --> 01:31:42,381
MaJesty...

713
01:31:44,525 --> 01:31:46,823
Your MaJesty,

714
01:31:47,095 --> 01:31:48,824
But I've done nothing...

715
01:31:57,071 --> 01:31:58,368
Where is my destroyer?

716
01:31:58,439 --> 01:31:59,838
My destroyer... where is he?

717
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,133
Why does he not reveal himself?

718
01:32:01,442 --> 01:32:02,966
Where does he hide?

719
01:32:03,344 --> 01:32:04,470
MaJesty

720
01:32:05,046 --> 01:32:07,014
He is merely a child

721
01:32:07,982 --> 01:32:11,110
And he has brought
you to this state...?

722
01:32:11,386 --> 01:32:13,854
I feel very pained to
see you like this...

723
01:32:14,222 --> 01:32:16,884
Pained? Then why
don't you do something?

724
01:32:17,191 --> 01:32:20,854
What is this magical
power protecting him?

725
01:32:20,928 --> 01:32:24,489
Who dares to be Kans' enemy?

726
01:32:24,565 --> 01:32:28,023
Who is this... so fearless?

727
01:32:28,102 --> 01:32:30,002
Excuse me, Your MaJesty...

728
01:32:30,438 --> 01:32:32,497
You are the one who sounds fearful

729
01:32:33,474 --> 01:32:36,500
Mighty Kans, this fear
is unbecoming of you

730
01:32:36,944 --> 01:32:39,412
Yes! I am filled with fear

731
01:32:42,884 --> 01:32:44,818
What a strange situation...

732
01:32:45,019 --> 01:32:48,250
the Mighty Kans is
afraid of a mere baby?

733
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:57,460
However I ... I shall
surely overcome my fear

734
01:32:57,899 --> 01:33:01,767
I will conQuer death

735
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:07,372
Wherever my destroyer
is I will destroy him

736
01:33:07,809 --> 01:33:11,540
I will annihilate him

737
01:33:11,779 --> 01:33:18,446
I will annihilate him

738
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:30,087
The Victor shall destroy

739
01:33:30,164 --> 01:33:33,930
with all his might, all
evil that stands in his way

740
01:33:34,035 --> 01:33:37,493
Only a ConQueror can overcome

741
01:33:37,805 --> 01:33:41,536
the demons that besiege him

742
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:52,850
A Hero will rise to every challenge,

743
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:57,482
in the moment of truth,
he will hold his ground

744
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:32,850
Come Judgment day,
holocaust and apocalypse,

745
01:34:32,927 --> 01:34:36,454
only the Hero shall save and redeem

746
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:01,082
What is happening?

747
01:35:01,222 --> 01:35:05,750
Is this really an earthQuake,
or am I imagining it?

748
01:35:06,227 --> 01:35:09,253
What fears have overcome me of late?

749
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:11,457
The hunt for this boy...

750
01:35:11,532 --> 01:35:18,062
has lasted for ten years and
still there's no a trace of him...?

751
01:35:18,139 --> 01:35:20,437
What's ten years, Kans?

752
01:35:20,508 --> 01:35:23,136
One can seek Him for centuries,
millenniums,..

753
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:24,769
.. lifetimes and all ages of man...

754
01:35:24,812 --> 01:35:28,805
but you will see Him only
when He wants to see you

755
01:35:30,418 --> 01:35:31,885
Narad...

756
01:35:32,253 --> 01:35:36,087
If you know so much about that boy,..

757
01:35:36,357 --> 01:35:39,019
..you must also know where he is?

758
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:42,058
Ah... I know because
He wishes me to know

759
01:35:42,129 --> 01:35:43,994
And it is because of His wish that

760
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:46,431
... this is the time for you to know.

761
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:51,802
Kans, your destroyer, Vasudev
and Devaki's eighth son, Krishna...

762
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:55,570
is in Vrindavan...in the
care of his foster parents

763
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:58,278
Nand and Yashoda and
their son Balram...

764
01:35:58,346 --> 01:36:02,942
Vasudev and Devaki deceived me

765
01:36:05,386 --> 01:36:06,580
Akrur,

766
01:36:07,989 --> 01:36:12,085
I shall not rest in peace
until I have met my dearest nephew

767
01:36:12,426 --> 01:36:17,830
You must get to Vrindavan
Quickly and fetch my beloved nephew

768
01:36:17,898 --> 01:36:22,562
Invite him to the wrestling
matches in the arena of Mathura

769
01:36:22,937 --> 01:36:28,967
I have ached ten long, long
years to set my eyes upon him

770
01:36:29,844 --> 01:36:34,042
Let there be no delay. Depart, now

771
01:36:55,036 --> 01:36:56,162
Krishna...

772
01:36:56,304 --> 01:36:58,101
His Excellency Arkur
of Mathura has come...

773
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:04,902
We are honored by your presence,
Your Excellency

774
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:10,008
All my life, I have waited
eagerly to see You Krishna

775
01:37:10,318 --> 01:37:15,915
Here you are before me,
yet I cannot believe my eyes

776
01:37:17,224 --> 01:37:19,886
Krishna, my Lord!

777
01:37:20,161 --> 01:37:22,959
You are the one the world has awaited

778
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:28,400
All creatures bright and beautiful,
all yearn for You

779
01:37:28,602 --> 01:37:33,562
Because each seeks divine love and Joy

780
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:37,876
This world can provide kingdoms,

781
01:37:38,212 --> 01:37:40,544
and riches and wealth, eminence...

782
01:37:40,915 --> 01:37:47,411
But nothing worldly
provides Joy or bliss

783
01:37:48,022 --> 01:37:52,459
Of that eternal bliss,
You are the fountainhead

784
01:37:54,061 --> 01:37:59,931
To show us the path of
selfless devotion, of endless love,

785
01:38:00,368 --> 01:38:03,462
You come amongst us again and again

786
01:38:03,971 --> 01:38:11,002
When the world is
full of misery and grief

787
01:38:11,412 --> 01:38:15,246
You take mercy upon us ..

788
01:38:15,549 --> 01:38:21,078
..and descend amongst us to
lead us to truth and light

789
01:38:23,924 --> 01:38:27,917
Kans is a cruel king

790
01:38:28,496 --> 01:38:31,863
He has cast aside his duties as a king

791
01:38:32,433 --> 01:38:37,200
He is ruling Mathura
with the help of demons

792
01:38:38,072 --> 01:38:43,977
He imprisoned his father
and declared himself Emperor

793
01:38:44,378 --> 01:38:48,940
Eighteen tribes have been
forced to flee their homelands

794
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,512
And your parents...

795
01:38:52,019 --> 01:38:56,046
the torture that he has
inflicted upon your parents...

796
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:59,954
In his attempt to eliminate you,
he killed your brothers,..

797
01:39:00,027 --> 01:39:02,996
.. six of them in cold blood

798
01:39:03,297 --> 01:39:08,792
I cannot describe to
you his cruelty in words

799
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:13,999
All her life, your mother
could only weep helplessly for..

800
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:16,804
..the children she has seen murdered

801
01:39:17,845 --> 01:39:21,008
And the unspeakable pain and sorrow..

802
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:24,847
..that your father has lived with...

803
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,454
The time for my parents' freedom...

804
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:31,883
and Kans' death has come

805
01:39:32,393 --> 01:39:36,159
It's high time that the
world is rid of this evil

806
01:39:36,831 --> 01:39:41,461
Kans is inviting
gladiators to wrestle in his arena

807
01:39:41,869 --> 01:39:44,167
He has invited you too

808
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:47,537
To make a public show of
your death in Mathura's arena

809
01:39:48,776 --> 01:39:50,403
And I have the sad task...

810
01:39:50,478 --> 01:39:56,906
to escort you there

811
01:39:57,384 --> 01:39:59,477
There is no cause for worry,
Your Excellency

812
01:39:59,553 --> 01:40:00,884
What do you say, brother?

813
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:10,028
Whenever I hear the flute...

814
01:40:12,867 --> 01:40:17,861
the lilting flute

815
01:40:18,138 --> 01:40:23,132
why am I overwhelmed,

816
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,801
why does my heart aches,

817
01:40:26,213 --> 01:40:28,443
why do my eyes yearn,

818
01:40:28,516 --> 01:40:31,007
why does my heart aches,

819
01:40:31,085 --> 01:40:33,815
why do my eyes yearn,

820
01:40:33,888 --> 01:40:38,825
oh why do tears come
to my thirsting eyes?

821
01:40:38,893 --> 01:40:49,235
Have you heard Krishna's flute,
have you felt the emotional tides,

822
01:40:49,303 --> 01:40:51,931
the heartache,

823
01:40:52,006 --> 01:40:54,770
my yearnings?

824
01:40:54,808 --> 01:40:59,802
Why does my heart ache,
why do I yearn so...

825
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:04,908
oh why do tears come
to my thirsting eyes,

826
01:41:04,985 --> 01:41:11,515
at the sound of the wind in a flute?

827
01:41:12,426 --> 01:41:15,827
Here amongst the
people of Vrindavan,..

828
01:41:15,863 --> 01:41:17,490
.. I have found that
love can be devotion

829
01:41:17,798 --> 01:41:19,197
I've found your love can be selfless,
devoid of any desire, ..

830
01:41:19,266 --> 01:41:20,927
..even wish or purpose

831
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:27,304
Almost divine, such love
is boundless and full of Joy

832
01:41:35,049 --> 01:41:36,448
And you Radha...

833
01:41:37,051 --> 01:41:39,815
I am seeing in you love as
if in human form, personified

834
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:43,180
To tell the truth, I
can never love you...

835
01:41:43,257 --> 01:41:44,986
as much as you love me

836
01:41:45,259 --> 01:41:47,193
For love is a debt
that can never be repaid

837
01:41:48,062 --> 01:41:51,759
Forgive me, Radha.
Mathura is where I need to be

838
01:41:52,099 --> 01:41:54,294
There's a world
waiting for me out there...

839
01:41:54,768 --> 01:41:56,861
my destiny is calling me...

840
01:41:57,504 --> 01:42:02,373
Oh do not remind me
of times with you...

841
01:42:02,443 --> 01:42:07,847
I have stopped fighting those memories

842
01:42:08,182 --> 01:42:10,912
But why are you so pitiless,..

843
01:42:10,985 --> 01:42:13,146
..or is your music's
pleasure in making me sad?

844
01:42:13,253 --> 01:42:18,350
Will you ever return to me Krishna,
my friend, my foe...

845
01:42:18,425 --> 01:42:23,453
Have you ever heard His flute,

846
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:28,797
passion's surge that music makes,

847
01:42:29,036 --> 01:42:31,436
the tortured heart...

848
01:42:31,505 --> 01:42:34,235
that brings tears to eyes...

849
01:42:34,308 --> 01:42:36,538
the tortured heart...

850
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:39,108
that brings tears to eyes...

851
01:42:39,213 --> 01:42:44,344
Oh why do I weep

852
01:42:44,418 --> 01:42:51,347
Have you ever heard His flute,

853
01:43:22,222 --> 01:43:24,315
Attention!

854
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:26,919
Our most beloved...

855
01:43:26,994 --> 01:43:30,486
our ruler and provider...

856
01:43:30,564 --> 01:43:32,122
the sovereign of Mathura...

857
01:43:32,232 --> 01:43:37,329
The King, Emperor,
The Almighty Kans...

858
01:43:37,404 --> 01:43:41,534
comes amongst us

859
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:48,311
And now...

860
01:43:48,749 --> 01:43:51,513
the Emperor's guests of honor...

861
01:43:51,952 --> 01:43:55,388
Devaki and Vasudev's son Krishna...

862
01:43:55,456 --> 01:43:57,788
and Balram...

863
01:43:58,025 --> 01:44:01,426
are entering the arena

864
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:09,531
My son... this is my son!

865
01:44:09,837 --> 01:44:11,236
My son has come!

866
01:44:11,472 --> 01:44:14,236
My Krishna... and Balram... at last...

867
01:44:15,776 --> 01:44:18,802
A team of two, this duo...
from Vrindavan?

868
01:44:18,879 --> 01:44:22,815
The whole town is full
with stories of their bravery

869
01:44:22,883 --> 01:44:25,147
But the two of them are Just children!

870
01:44:28,889 --> 01:44:31,949
So this is my destroyer?

871
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:38,127
Chanur

872
01:44:40,334 --> 01:44:42,859
I am Chanur

873
01:44:43,036 --> 01:44:46,995
You must be Krishna...
and that is Balram

874
01:44:47,141 --> 01:44:49,473
Bravest of the brave?

875
01:44:53,447 --> 01:44:56,974
And I am Mustik. Which
one is taking me on?

876
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,847
I think, my brother will

877
01:44:58,919 --> 01:45:00,511
Chanur is my opponent

878
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:02,244
Accepted

879
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:18,770
This is so unfair

880
01:45:18,806 --> 01:45:21,969
A boy pitted against a
killer like Chanur...?

881
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:48,893
Shala, Toshala, Kut...

882
01:46:04,017 --> 01:46:07,817
Krishna...

883
01:46:12,092 --> 01:46:14,322
Krishna...

884
01:46:14,394 --> 01:46:19,161
Uncle here I am. You have been
looking for me for ten years...

885
01:46:19,266 --> 01:46:22,599
I accepted your
invitation and I have come

886
01:46:22,836 --> 01:46:25,430
When repression reaches its heights...

887
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:28,406
it invites its own end

888
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:31,536
You also have invited me

889
01:46:31,612 --> 01:46:32,909
Thank you for inviting me

890
01:46:50,831 --> 01:46:54,528
Krishna...

891
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:57,565
Krishna...

892
01:46:57,804 --> 01:47:00,932
Krishna...

893
01:48:01,535 --> 01:48:03,503
This, for my six brothers...

894
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:06,403
the six infants whom you
flung upon the rocks..

895
01:48:06,473 --> 01:48:08,805
and you bashed them until they died

896
01:48:09,476 --> 01:48:15,210
This, for my innocent parents,
whom you have held captive

897
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:28,327
This, for the tears that my
mother held back for ten years

898
01:48:31,598 --> 01:48:36,865
This, for the eighteen clans
who were forced to flee Mathura

899
01:48:42,075 --> 01:48:44,942
This, for your
persecution of the people of Gokul,

900
01:48:45,012 --> 01:48:46,604
Vrindavan and Mathura...

901
01:48:46,847 --> 01:48:49,111
the countless people you have tortured

902
01:49:05,065 --> 01:49:09,502
This Avatar of Vishnu the Lord of
Life, who was born amongst us...

903
01:49:09,569 --> 01:49:12,402
and used his might to redeem us,

904
01:49:12,472 --> 01:49:16,909
to deliver us was called Krishna,
the son of Vasudeva

905
01:49:16,977 --> 01:49:19,571
Victory to Krishna!

906
01:49:19,846 --> 01:49:22,178
Victory to Krishna!

907
01:49:22,249 --> 01:49:24,809
Victory to Krishna!

908
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:27,251
Victory to Krishna!

909
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,584
Victory to Krishna!

910
01:49:29,823 --> 01:49:32,417
Victory to Krishna!

911
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,854
People of Mathura, in
every era, in every age...

912
01:49:37,931 --> 01:49:39,865
this has been the fate of every tyrant

913
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:49,236
Death to the tyrant add when
the statue of Kans is falling down

914
01:49:49,309 --> 01:49:53,177
Death to the tyrant add when
the statue of Kans is falling down

915
01:49:53,246 --> 01:49:57,307
Death to the tyrant add when
the statue of Kans is falling down

916
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:04,448
Victory to Krishna!

917
01:50:04,524 --> 01:50:06,958
Victory to Krishna!

918
01:50:07,027 --> 01:50:08,995
My son... my baby...

919
01:50:09,062 --> 01:50:13,522
My Krishna... come...

920
01:50:19,106 --> 01:50:24,874
Krishna... my baby... I love you

921
01:50:25,445 --> 01:50:28,414
Mother, wipe your tears

922
01:50:29,082 --> 01:50:32,074
The time of sorrow is gone

923
01:50:43,497 --> 01:50:47,058
Say hail to King Ugrasen Hail!

924
01:50:47,134 --> 01:50:50,228
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

925
01:50:50,303 --> 01:50:53,500
Victory to Krishna and Balram

926
01:50:53,773 --> 01:50:56,469
Victory to Krishna and Balram

927
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:57,772
5000 years on, the
legend of Krishna, his birth,

928
01:50:57,844 --> 01:51:00,108
his feats, still evokes awe,
inspiration, devotion

929
01:51:01,014 --> 01:51:02,777
The philosophy of duty and love that

930
01:51:02,816 --> 01:51:05,785
he espoused is the
cornerstone of culture

931
01:51:05,852 --> 01:51:07,786
in the land of his birth
and elsewhere

932
01:51:08,855 --> 01:51:09,787
this land seeking to
fathom Krishna's legend...

933
01:51:09,856 --> 01:51:11,118
and to re-live the music,
to study a culture...

934
01:51:11,191 --> 01:51:12,249
this Krishna consciousness
that has survived Tim
