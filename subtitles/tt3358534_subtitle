1
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,050
Why can't you use the back foot to board?

2
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,550
Sir, always take risks in life.

3
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,680
Did you find my bus to take risks?

4
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,190
Conductor, don't scold me.
Today is my birthday.

5
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,260
So what? Free to do anything?
Get lost!

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,420
- Ticket to Central... - Take it...

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,300
Hello, don't buy ticket...

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,700
What happened to you?

9
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,770
I'm going to make your journey a memorable,
it's my birthday treat.

10
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,840
I didn't get you.

11
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,570
I'll buy tickets for you all.

12
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,640
I've bought my ticket.

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,540
It's okay... no problem...

14
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,620
You take back the ticket
and pay money.

15
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,110
Good citizen!

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,240
- Thank you!
- Okay.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,150
He is a good person.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,290
Take and give tickets to all of them.

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,460
You distribute the tickets
and return the balance.

20
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,860
He has bought tickets
for all of you, hasn't he?

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,000
Why don't you wish him on his birthday?

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:54,080
Happy birthday to you!

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,700
<i>All of you be ready with your tickets.</i>

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,580
Show your tickets.

25
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,190
Mind your work, man.

26
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,520
<i>Ticket please... show me your ticket.</i>

27
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,360
He has bought tickets for all of us.

28
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,260
Show me their tickets.

29
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,960
I've bought all the tickets.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,370
Today is my birthday.

31
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,630
So I wanted to travel alone in the bus...

32
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,770
But a crowd came.

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,680
I've bought the tickets but I'm standing.

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,750
Look at them sitting
happily without tickets.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,980
Talking rubbish?

36
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,370
What about their tickets then?

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,710
How should I know?

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,550
What happens when you don't have a ticket?

39
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,620
Rs.500 fine.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,980
Okay!

41
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,300
If they don't pay?

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,920
6 months imprisonment!

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,520
All fraudsters, pay the fine.

44
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,500
Why did you cheat us?

45
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,360
- I'll pay you, return my ticket.
<i>- Give me Rs.4.50 ticket.</i>

46
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,200
Wait...

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,700
Hey, please return the tickets...

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,140
Rs.2 ticket for Rs.4.

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,000
And Rs.8 for Rs.10.

50
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,340
Rs.2 for Rs.4, Rs.4 for Rs.8.
And Rs.8  for Rs.10.

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,760
Give it or it'll be a fine
or 6 months in jail.

52
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,740
The fine is Rs.500.

53
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,540
Rs.2 ticket for 4.
- Hey, you're a bloody crook.

54
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Hey, you're one to talk!

55
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,950
You got paid for a used ticket.7

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,350
Am I a cheat if I sell the tickets
I bought for all of you?

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,080
You're talking too much.

58
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,820
For you a Rs.4 ticket is Rs.40.

59
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,480
He wants a fine!

60
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,230
Rs.2 for Rs.4. Rs.4 for Rs.8.
Rs.8 for Rs.10.

61
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,050
It's free for you.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,130
Rs.2 for Rs.4. Rs.4 for Rs.8.
And Rs.8 for Rs.10.

63
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,030
For me too?

64
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,100
Oh! You're the conductor? Sorry.

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,880
If you delay further...
Rs.2 tickets will go up to Rs.10.

66
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,320
The fine is Rs.500 or spend 6 months in jail.

67
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,710
What is going on here?

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,910
There is a small function in our area.

69
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,150
I'm collecting funds.
- I'm confused!

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,720
Whatever it is, everyone has tickets.

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,750
You're the 1st man in the world
black marketing tickets in a running bus.

72
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,050
Thiru, why do you look lost?

73
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,760
You're here on time.
Is the poster ready?

74
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,930
- Did you finish everything else?
- Yes we did.

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,330
Why is he shouting like this?

76
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,480
This dumb wants us to paste the poster
before the auspicious time elapses.

77
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,300
Are you a great man?
Come on...

78
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,280
Being dumb you're already such a
pain in the neck. What if you could talk?

79
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,380
Paste it, buddy.

80
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,040
You should've gotten a double sheet poster.

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Paste it.

82
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,180
Hey Thiru, Valarmathi looks
beautiful in her half sari.

83
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,520
She bloomed like a flower unnoticed.

84
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
The poster is good.

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,190
Isn't she beautiful?

86
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,620
The next one should be pasted
on Valarmathi's house.

87
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,990
<i>We congratulate Valarmathi for her coming of age and
for growing into a beautiful woman.</i>

88
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,860
<i>Regards, 5 Stars Group.</i>

89
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,170
<i>Thiru stares...</i>

90
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,970
<i>... and laughs...</i>

91
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,870
<i>Thiru stares...</i>

92
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,200
<i>... and laughs...</i>

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,610
<i>Thiru stares...</i>

94
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,010
<i>... and laughs...</i>

95
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,620
<i>Dance baby!</i>

96
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,250
<i>Dance baby!</i>

97
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,290
<i>Fragrance all over the streets...</i>

98
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,490
<i>... I wonder which flower</i>
<i>has bloomed today.</i>

99
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,130
<i>Has Valarmathi of door No: 7</i>
<i>come to age...?</i>

100
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,270
<i>Let her maternal uncle</i>
<i>build the customary hut...</i>

101
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,250
<i>Let me paste posters</i>
<i>wishing her good luck...</i>

102
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,780
<i>A bud has bloomed into flower...</i>

103
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,650
<i>Demand honey from it...</i>

104
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:17,120
<i>A chick has grown into a hen...</i>
<i>celebrate it...</i>

105
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,490
<i>Cocks call an urgent meeting</i>
<i>to celebrate the event...</i>

106
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,900
<i>Dance baby!</i>

107
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,700
<i>Dance baby!</i>

108
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,640
<i>Dance baby!</i>

109
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,930
<i>Dance baby!</i>

110
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,470
<i>Long skirts have become Salwar suits...</i>

111
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,540
<i>and it is making young men</i>
<i>to lose their sleep...</i>

112
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,110
<i>If girls stop coming out...</i>

113
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,540
<i>the streets become lifeless...</i>

114
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,910
<i>and life becomes tasteless...</i>

115
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,950
<i>What should be done?</i>

116
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,680
<i>Why should young women hide in homes?</i>

117
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,590
<i>This orthodox custom should be banned...</i>

118
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,150
<i>Respect our desires...</i>

119
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,350
<i>Think about your past...</i>

120
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,120
<i>Past is past...</i>

121
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,530
<i>Now the days are colorful...</i>

122
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,730
<i>Will you lose your chastity</i>
<i>if we look at you?</i>

123
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,730
<i>Dance baby!</i>

124
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,000
<i>Dance baby!</i>

125
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,290
<i>I'm not the Cupid...</i>

126
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,490
<i>But still I have desires...</i>

127
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,020
<i>In the moonlight...</i>

128
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,530
<i>with the waves caressing our legs...</i>

129
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,960
<i>won't I be lucky to</i>
<i>embrace my sweetheart?</i>

130
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,530
<i>Love is like the elections...</i>

131
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,500
<i>Take the lead in canvassing yourself...</i>

132
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,130
<i>Make hay when the sun shines...</i>

133
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,270
<i>Adjust love to your requirements...</i>

134
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,110
<i>If I see an angel...</i>

135
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,610
<i>if I fall in love with her...</i>

136
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,590
<i>I'll chose an auspicious date...</i>

137
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,450
<i>to marry and enjoy...</i>

138
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,320
<i>Dance baby!</i>

139
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,190
<i>Dance baby!</i>

140
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,890
<i>Fragrance all over the streets...</i>

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,370
<i>... I wonder which flower</i>
<i>has bloomed today.</i>

142
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,970
<i>Has Valarmathy of door No: 7</i>
<i>come of age...?</i>

143
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,040
<i>Let her maternal uncle</i>

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,840

<i>A chick has grown into a hen...</i>

148
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,930
<i>Cocks call an urgent meeting</i>
<i>to celebrate the event...</i>

149
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,880
<i>Dear residents of Ayanavaram Aandalpuram,</i>

150
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,440
<i>on the occasion of
Valarmathi's coming of age,</i>

151
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,750
we are distributing free
Turkey biryani.

152
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,880
In the presence of the former President
of the 5 Stars Group, Mr. Angusamy,

153
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:10,460
and his brother, Mr. Pangusamy,
the present President Mr. Thiru will distribute it.

154
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,940
Give them a big applause.

155
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,970
We missed out on all this fun in our times,

156
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,110
men used to come, have a feast
and walk out.

157
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm very happy to see you
celebrating the event.

158
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,420
- Long live the 5 Stars group!
- Thanks to the well wisher.

159
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,390
What's it, Thiru?
Just biryani? No drinks?

160
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,120
Brother, I too would like it.
But it's financially difficult.

161
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,120
Saraswathi should come of age next week.

162
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,430
- I'll arrange it then.
- Long live.

163
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,120
Hey, people are coming in
autos to get free food.

164
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,670
<i>This is not a new problem.</i>
<i>This has been going for 20 long years.</i>

165
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,380
<i>When will this end?</i>
<i>Nobody knows it!</i>

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,490
Why did you paste posters for
our area girl's coming of age?

167
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,130
It was your duty to do it.

168
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,520
But you failed to do it.

169
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,060
So Thiru had to sell bus
tickets in the black market.

170
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,040
You shouldn't have paste it!

171
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,630
If you can ogle girls in my area,

172
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,970
why can't I paste posters
for your area's girls?

173
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,280
- You shouldn't have paste it!
- We will.

174
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,250
If you've guts, stop us.

175
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,250
- We will kill you...
- Try it...

176
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,820
Thiru is running away.

177
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,770
Where is the stick?

178
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,940
Oh God!

179
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,360
Hello...
- Yes, come in.

180
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,450
<i>The day I saw you...</i>
- My name is Mala.

181
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,690
Hey! Come on, man.

182
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,100
Read my message.

183
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,070
I'm a good man.
I can't bear it if you beat me.

184
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,570
Don't insult me by beating me in public.
Basically, I'm an orphan.

185
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,540
Yours -Tiger Kumar.

186
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,340
It's me! - Yuck!

187
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,890
They are beating mercilessly.
- Have a drink.

188
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,740
What are you doing, buddy?
- Mixing!

189
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,770
Beat the drums.

190
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,890
The police!

191
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,240
Hey, what's the trouble here?

192
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,740
Sir, I'm blind...
- What's going on here?

193
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm a stranger.
- What's the problem?

194
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,840
I know, sir...

195
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,110
- I don't know, sir.
- Hey, who was that?

196
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,110
Who hit him?
Who is it? Tell me...

197
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,040
Did you stone him?
- No.

198
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,100
I'll tell you who hit him with a stone,

199
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,720
and who is responsible for this skirmish.
- What?

200
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,790
I swear, trust me.
I know his address.

201
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,150
Tell me.

202
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,330
Hey, is it No:16?
- Yes.

203
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,930
Sir, what's this?
Why did you give your address?

204
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,840
He is my son.

205
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,570
I swear, he is my son.

206
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,400
He is having his food inside.

207
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,310
If you go silently, you can catch him.

208
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,880
Hey follow me...

209
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,520
Didn't I tell you not to make noise?

210
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,420
Brother Swaminatha...
- Get lost!

211
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,380
Search him there.

212
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,790
Where is mom?

213
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,030
Mom is here!

214
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,690
Mom, police has come...
ask them to go...

215
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,940
Isn't ours respectable family?
- Okay... let's see...

216
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,160
- Take him, sir...
- Mother...

217
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,100
Yes I'm your mother. Take him.
- Come on...

218
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,040
Sir, just a minute...

219
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,040
A mother must be like an angel.
She shouldn't betray.

220
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,940
Nothing less in this!

221
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,620
Sir, add this to the charge sheet.

222
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,410
Go man... you will get stick there!

223
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,320
Leave me, sir.
I'll kill him and come.

224
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,820
Hey, stop beating him...
- Leave him

225
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,050
First take him away.

226
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,790
Hey, Specty! I'll come back
and see you!

227
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,100
Why are you shouting at me sir?

228
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,060
Do you know who my father is?
- Who is he?

229
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,230
If I inform my father,
you will be dismissed.

230
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,300
Your father helped us catch you.
- What?

231
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,810
Dad, what's this?

232
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,880
We failed as parents, but the
police will straighten you up.

233
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,250
A few days in jail will reform you.

234
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:15,920
Take him away.

235
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,140
If your father had done this to you,
you would've known it.

236
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,150
- Go man...
- Take off your hand, sir...

237
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,380
Don't know when he is going
to reform and settle in life?

238
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,860
Look at his appearance and his dress.
What's your name?

239
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,200
You're police, aren't you? Find out...
- What?

240
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,270
We had printed our names in the
poster, hadn't we? Read it...

241
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,340
What's your name?
- Tiger Kumar.

242
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,070
- Tiger Kumar?
- Dared hit me?

243
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,810
Are you great Tiger?

244
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,540
He loves the Puli brand...
that's why he's Tiger Kumar.

245
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,120
What?

246
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,120
Puli means Tiger!
That's why Tiger Kumar.

247
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,020
The inspector doesn't know that "puli"
means "tiger" in Tamil.

248
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,160
Your name?

249
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,960
- What?
- Sir, he is a dumb.

250
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,690
Good morning, sir.
- Your name?

251
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,800
- Yamaha Raji.
- Do you own a Yamaha bike?

252
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,590
He steals bikes.

253
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,930
Nothing less in this!
Five Stars group!

254
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,070
Whether Valarmathi comes of age or not,
what's it to you?

255
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,830
Why did you paste posters
all over the area?

256
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,750
Sir, if any MLA or MP or a Party secretary visits,
they splash the city with posters.

257
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,370
Valarmathi is our girl.
- So?

258
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,320
When they paste posters
whether they win or lose,

259
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,910
why not for Valarmathi, who will
come of age only once?

260
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,320
You should not!
- Why sir?

261
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,820
You should not!
- Give me the reason!

262
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,960
Because Valarmathi is my daughter!

263
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,190
Sorry sir.

264
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,670
No use of saying sorry now.

265
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,010
Back from school?

266
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,520
Back from jail?

267
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,760
Starting all over again?

268
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,540
Behave like a younger brother.

269
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,260
Behave like an elder brother.

270
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,960
How can I love such a boy?
- Keep quiet.

271
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,790
Rap... rap on my head as you please.

272
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,600
I'm tired. I'll do it after eating.

273
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,360
No way!

274
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,940
How did he come home?

275
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,180
Mother brought him back.

276
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,250
Why did you bring him here?

277
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,150
I'm asking you...
why did you bring him here?

278
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,380
What are you talking?
He is our son.

279
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,860
Great son! I feel ashamed of him.

280
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,290
Always loitering around,
or in a bar,

281
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,330
Now police station!

282
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,160
That's why I didn't want to come here.
You didn't listen to me.

283
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,000
You could've gone elsewhere.

284
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,570
Mother, ask him to mind his words.

285
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,640
Or I may be forced to talk.

286
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,140
What will you say?
Can't even find a job for yourself!

287
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:53,840
Arguing with me.

288
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,340
I can't work for others!
- Why can't you keep quiet?

289
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,220
What else will you do?

290
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,240
I'll start a business.

291
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,320
I've been asking for a hundred thousand
for the past 6 months.

292
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,650
You turn deaf to it.

293
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,890
Do you know the meaning of business?

294
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,780
Why not?

295
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,960
Keep quiet.
- Leave me, mother.

296
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,130
I'll do business in
real estate like you.

297
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,330
Impossible!

298
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,500
Listen, I've already invested 2.5 millions
on a land trusting a man,

299
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,630
and I've been struggling for 6 months.
I can't sell it nor get back my money.

300
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,920
Business isn't a joke.

301
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,870
I won't get cheated like you!

302
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,940
Mother, I didn't ask him to take a loan.

303
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,440
I'm asking him to give me his savings.

304
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,680
Listen, I have already lost enough

305
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,640
I don't want to lose my savings on you

306
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,810
and end up on the streets.

307
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,720
You trusted an outsider and
invested 2 millions.

308
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,660
Why don't you entrust a
hundred thousand to your son?

309
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,060
I wouldn't entrust a rupee to him,
let alone thousands.

310
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,890
If you don't, I'll live on my own.

311
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,060
I'll do what I want then.

312
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,100
Then you don't have the
right to live in my house.

313
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,430
I'll go then...
- Go...

314
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,800
Just a minute...

315
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,370
Don't tell anyone you're my son.

316
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,940
It's not something I tell people.

317
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,980
He hasn't eaten yet.

318
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,570
Ask him to eat first.
- You stupid woman!

319
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,410
Does he look hungry?

320
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,680
He has loaded fully,
just his face is like that.

321
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,410
Yes father. He had 7 dosas.
- Don't I know?

322
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,320
Oh my God!

323
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,550
Add numbers in your books.
Not on how much I eat!

324
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,820
Get lost, you pig.

325
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,060
Hey dumb, don't drink too much,

326
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,930
I won't be able to answer your father then.

327
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,660
Come, Thiru...

328
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,470
I was worried you wouldn't come
to foot the bill.

329
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,230
Speaks in English after few pegs.

330
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,710
Why are you dull?

331
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,870
My dad refused to invest money
in my business.

332
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,810
My dad won't give me
money even for bus fares.

333
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,610
Your dad is far better.

334
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,810
Why fathers don't trust their sons?

335
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,510
All fathers consider themselves
as God fathers.

336
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,660
But actually they're bad fathers!

337
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,450
Well said, boss.

338
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,050
Hi everybody!

339
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm Venugopal from Tidel Park.

340
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,190
Oh I see...

341
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,960
Glad to meet you.
- What? Granny is missing?

342
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,430
No. I said I'm happy to meet you.

343
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,230
If you don't mind, can I have a cigarette?

344
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,560
Oh Yes, take it.

345
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,600
Hey, don't give him.

346
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,800
No problem. He may mistake you.
- Not at all...

347
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,800
Hey, he is from Tidel Park.

348
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,760
Please have it, sir.

349
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,750
Sorry for disturbance...
- No problem.

350
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,100
- Please carry on...
- Okay.

351
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,620
Sorry...
- Okay sir.

352
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,180
My mother tried a lot,
but my father isn't convinced.

353
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,520
All our fathers are making
our mothers worthless.

354
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,060
You're right!

355
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,060
I'm Venugopal, from Tidel Park.
- You said this earlier, sir.

356
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,760
If you don't mind, can I have little Pepsi?

357
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,930
Give him.

358
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,870
Enough.

359
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,520
Thank you. Carry on...

360
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,940
What happened to you?

361
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,280
Friend, life has become a bore.

362
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,200
Only life should get bored of us, not we.

363
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,950
Well said, sir.

364
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,250
I'm Venugopal from Tidel Park.

365
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,590
You said this thrice.

366
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,350
What do you want now?

367
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,520
If you don't mind...

368
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,750
Can I have a peg?

369
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,200
Thank you.

370
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,600
Thank you. You carry on...

371
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,430
No one...

372
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,370
No one cares for us.

373
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,740
Father isn't giving me money.

374
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,750
Banks are rejecting my loan applications.

375
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,710
Buddy, the bank has no authority
to reject you loans.

376
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,550
We will lend money to the banks.

377
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,120
We will definitely reach the top.

378
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,980
Impossible!

379
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,390
It's impossible for me to walk.

380
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,530
Then will you run?

381
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,660
- I'm Venugopal from...
- Tidel Park.

382
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,100
A big request...

383
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,110
Oh no!

384
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,110
I'm finished.

385
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,640
I'm fully drunk.
- You will since you get it freely.

386
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,050
I don't like walking...

387
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,980
Venu, shall I get you an auto?

388
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,350
No need.

389
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,460
If you give me money,
I'll catch an auto and go home.

390
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,730
What else then?

391
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,830
Would you like to come with me?

392
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,030
What did you ask me?

393
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,160
Money.

394
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,760
Don't you have money then?

395
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,570
I always come here
without money.

396
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,810
Hey, you told us that
you're from Tidel Park.

397
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,380
What does it mean?

398
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,210
I'll get tight drunk and
sleep in a park.

399
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,020
Is it not a Software Company?

400
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,880
What does it mean?

401
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,590
Hey, watching the show? Beat him.

402
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,920
You want an auto to sleep in the park?

403
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,140
He has come!

404
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,620
Had food, mother?

405
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,290
Oh no! He is calling me "mother"!

406
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,330
What's the time now?

407
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,260
I can't sleep tonight.

408
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,770
Didn't I ask you? What's the time now?

409
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,730
Means?

410
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,070
Dad, he is saying it's 17.

411
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,150
17?
- What happened?

412
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,950
Mom, he is drunk.

413
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,120
Mother...

414
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,480
Why are you beating him?

415
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,480
He is more matured than you.

416
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,690
You will know his true color
when he becomes like me.

417
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,390
Don't worry about that.

418
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,160
He will be a Collector at your age.

419
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,220
No way!

420
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,100
Getting drunk,
why are you behaving cheaply?

421
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,430
You will never come up in your life!

422
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,900
I'll also succeed in my life.

423
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
First stand straight.

424
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,740
I know, you can't do it.

425
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,740
Didn't you yell at me for
not give him money?

426
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,470
If I had given him,
he would've spent it on drinks.

427
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,800
Don't talk when you didn't do it.

428
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,010
First give me money...
- You'll never come back here.

429
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,880
Why are you behaving like this?

430
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
He refused to give me
money so I got drunk.

431
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,920
I got drunk so I lost my bike.

432
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,520
What? You lost your bike?

433
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,460
Is it? Very good!

434
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,290
He has done a great job!

435
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,220
In spite of his warnings,

436
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,960
I sold my jewels
and bought you a bike.

437
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,800
How can you be so careless?
Where did you lose it?

438
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,630
No. He didn't lose it.

439
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,500
He pledged it to have drinks.

440
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,670
I'm not lying.

441
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,830
I lost the bike.

442
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,240
Talking philosophy in drunken stupor?

443
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,380
I swear, he has sold his bike.

444
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
Didn't I tell you that I lost my bike?

445
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,780
Won't you believe me?
- How dare to shout at me?

446
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,620
You're grown up, so
I don't want to beat you.

447
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,350
And you yell at me when after misbehaving?

448
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,680
- Get out...
- Hubby...

449
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,450
You keep quiet.

450
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,380
I say get out from here.

451
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,230
Why should I?

452
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,450
Because this is my house.

453
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,620
Find your bike
or don't come back.

454
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,080
Mother, whatever you say, I can't come.

455
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,950
I won't!

456
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,640
Hang up the phone...

457
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,780
What boss?
Have you also lost your bike?

458
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,110
My parents fixed my marriage.

459
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,520
I don't like her.
- Why boss?

460
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,290
When we see a girl,
we should feel like living with her

461
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,400
and sacrificing
our life for her.

462
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,520
We shouldn't think
of running away like I did.

463
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,390
I didn't get you.

464
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,800
I'll explain it to you.
- Yes, tell me.

465
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,200
Brother, when we see a girl,
we must feel the heat of fire.

466
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,500
Fire?
- Yes.

467
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,780
Oh Lord! The fire has come!

468
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,260
Great fire!

469
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,880
Oh no! My bike!

470
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,220
I'm Venugopal from Tidel Park.

471
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,950
Thirukumaran from Ayanavaram.

472
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,820
Nice. You're really brilliant.

473
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,990
You found it within a day!
I appreciate you!

474
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,190
Priest, offer special prayers in his name.
- Okay.

475
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,870
Where is your TVS Champ parked?
- Parked it outside.

476
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,730
Thank god! I got back my bike.

477
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,800
Lady luck has graced you,
you got back your bike.

478
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,240
<i>Once I saw you...</i>

479
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,170
<i>you hid my identity within me...</i>

480
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,880
<i>You mesmerized me with your smile...</i>

481
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,880
<i>You stole my broken heart...</i>

482
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:45,050
<i>I've lost myself...</i>

483
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,730
<i>My heart wants you without</i>
<i>even knowing your name...</i>

484
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,970
<i>You gave me an endless pain...</i>

485
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,770
<i>Oh my love! Will you love me?</i>

486
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,350
<i>Oh my love! Will you love me?</i>

487
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,680
<i>Once I saw you...</i>

488
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,450
<i>you hid my identity within me...</i>

489
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,220
<i>You mesmerized me with your smile...</i>

490
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,120
<i>You stole my broken heart...</i>

491
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,950
<i>When you walk on streets...</i>

492
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,600
<i>All trees will murmur your name...</i>

493
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:58,390
<i>Sun rises only after seeing you...</i>

494
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,900
<i>Who are you?</i>

495
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,810
<i>I'm fully shaken because of you...</i>

496
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:09,400
<i>You've made me fall in love</i>
<i>with a single glance...</i>

497
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,350
<i>Before I express my love,</i>
<i>you disappear...</i>

498
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,320
<i>Don't go away from me, my sweet heart!</i>

499
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,490
<i>I'll die, if you leave me...</i>

500
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,430
<i>Once I saw you...</i>

501
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
<i>you hid my identity within me...</i>

502
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,140
<i>You mesmerized me with your smile...</i>

503
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,140
<i>You stole my broken heart...</i>

504
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,900
<i>You're soft like a flower...</i>

505
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,870
<i>The entire world belongs to you...</i>

506
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:11,470
<i>I'm very fortunate to live with you...</i>

507
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,980
<i>You are rain bearing cloud...</i>

508
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,780
<i>And I'm thirsty of love...</i>

509
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,360
<i>I've fallen in love after seeing you...</i>

510
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,790
<i>Love has taken deep</i>
<i>roots in my heart.</i>

511
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,430
<i>My sorrows disappear from today...</i>

512
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,400
<i>I've seen my dawn after seeing you...</i>

513
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,250
<i>you hid my identity within me...</i>

514
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,940
<i>You mesmerized me with your smile...</i>

515
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,920
<i>You've stolen my heart...</i>
<i>I've lost myself...</i>

516
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:56,150
<i>Oh my love! Will you love me?</i>

517
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,860
<i>Oh my love! Will you love me?</i>

518
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,910
Hi...
- Hi...

519
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,410
When did you come here?

520
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,650
2 days back.
- I never saw you.

521
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,480
What's your name?

522
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,350
Urmila.

523
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,710
Nice name.
- Thank you.

524
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,980
I'm Swaminathan.

525
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,220
What?
- Swaminathan!

526
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,250
Oh Swaminathan!

527
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,950
Urmi, is your dad rich?

528
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,130
Hey, somebody is watching...
- Where?

529
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:35,830
There...

530
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,200
Who is it?

531
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:39,970
Oh no!

532
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,870
You will never leave me in peace!

533
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,370
Brother...

534
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,980
Brother?!

535
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:52,840
Who is it?

536
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,820
Urmila.

537
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,020
Urmila?!

538
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,660
Hey Swaminatha...

539
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,090
Father hopes that you will
become a Collector.

540
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,060
But I don't think you will
even finish high school.

541
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,230
Hey you... What is this?

542
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,400
Are you using incense sticks for vapor?

543
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,830
I'll tell on you... mother...

544
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,540
Brother, please don't reveal it...

545
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,940
Am I handsome, little brother?

546
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,950
Tell me...
- Handsome... I'm afraid...

547
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,680
That's it!

548
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,080
Why have you suddenly
become beauty conscious?

549
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,320
I saw a girl in the temple...
She was very beautiful.

550
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,120
I just want to confirm
whether we will match.

551
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,420
Is she very beautiful?

552
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,030
She is a world beauty. - Really?

553
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,660
Is she like our Tiger Kumar's sister?

554
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,900
Don't compare that ugly duckling with her?

555
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,300
Will she look like her?

556
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,370
She is an aunt.

557
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,540
What about your girl then?

558
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,110
She is an extraordinary girl!

559
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,110
What about that girl?

560
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,150
Tell me brother...

561
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,450
I'm asking, tell me!

562
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,280
She is the same girl! You fool!

563
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,750
Hey, why are you going this side?

564
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,930
School is that side...

565
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,000
Come on... I'll drop you at the college.

566
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,160
Hey, drop me at my school.

567
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,960
Keep quiet... - I'll tell father...

568
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,700
- Hey, keep quiet...
- I'm going to kill you...

569
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,670
Police, help me...

570
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,770
I'm talking from Pillar signal...

571
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,570
A school boy is being kidnapped
by a guy on a Yamaha No: 5969.

572
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,980
- Follow him immediately.
- Please save me...

573
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,990
Hey, the police is chasing you...

574
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,690
Hey, dad wants me to become a Collector.

575
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,590
Stay calm...
I'll drop you at the Collector's office.

576
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,130
It's my fault for
pointing at that girl.

577
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,890
Well trapped!

578
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,290
Hey, why did you kidnap him?

579
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,780
Kidnap?
He is my brother.

580
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,700
Is it true?
- No sir.

581
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,030
Hey Swaminatha, I'll talk to dad about Urmila...

582
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,010
Who is Urmila?
- His girl friend!

583
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,500
You too need a girl friend?
- Sir, got confused in tension, he's my brother.

584
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,140
Kidnapping your own brother?
- He saw his girlfriend.

585
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,480
He chased after her and forgot
to drop me to school.

586
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,450
You too have a girlfriend?

587
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,920
Not yet confirmed, sir.

588
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,020
Your people trust you
to drop him to school?

589
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,260
Sir...
- What?

590
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,080
Your girlfriend is on the line.

591
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,130
Everybody has a girlfriend.

592
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,880
I'll take my leave...

593
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,230
You come in after Thiru comes.
We will go inside.

594
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,420
Why are you shouting?

595
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,040
If you go in first can you tell
the entire screenplay?

596
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,230
Any film is wasting on you.
You can't express yourself.

597
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,740
Sir, he black marketing tickets.

598
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,410
Hi Thiru...

599
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,240
Sorry buddy...

600
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,780
Film started?

601
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
Going to start now.
Let's go...

602
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,950
Who is that girl?

603
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,360
Didn't I tell you about a girl?
- Yes.

604
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,460
That's her!

605
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,190
Hi, are you fine?

606
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,900
This is our friend, Suri.

607
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,600
He's been in love with you for a long time.

608
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,100
I told him that you belong
to a rich family.

609
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,370
And we are from a slum.

610
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,820
He says that love has no disparities.

611
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,610
So you love him
and free us from his torture.

612
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,100
What do you say?
- Hey you rascal...

613
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,100
Are you joking?

614
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,020
It's decided...

615
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,490
From now on, you are lovers.

616
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,450
Leave my hand...

617
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,920
Man, take her inside and
show her your love.

618
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,680
Take her inside...

619
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,440
Why are you feeling shy to hold her hand?

620
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,860
Take her inside...

621
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,550
Stupid fellows!

622
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,590
Hey, stop... my sister...

623
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,420
Have you seen your face in a mirror?

624
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,960
Will you take my sister inside the theater?

625
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,180
Do you know who I am?

626
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,660
- Who?
- I'm an MLA's brother-in-law.

627
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,190
Do you know about me?

628
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:23,490
Guru! How dare to touch my sister?

629
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,900
Hey, she is Guru's sister!

630
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,130
If anyone misbehaves with her,
I'll cut him into pieces.

631
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,400
Come on, dear...

632
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,220
Is he a big goon if he beats 4 people?

633
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,940
She has only one brother.

634
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,120
But you've 4 friends.

635
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,470
We are ready to sacrifice
our lives for your love.

636
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,900
Don't hope to hear this from us.

637
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,200
Is he a human?

638
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,000
A lone man is beating 4 people!

639
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,340
Forget that girl!

640
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,840
You're right, buddy.

641
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,410
He has beaten them black and blue
for ogling at his sister.

642
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,470
If he knows that I love her...

643
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,720
He will definitely kill me!

644
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,050
Did you expect me to say like this?

645
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,700
It's the girl I love.

646
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,050
Her range is different from ours.
- To hell with your range!

647
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,260
Didn't get him?

648
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,490
He says accept your limitations
and then aim high.

649
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,300
Whatever you say...

650
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,500
I love her.

651
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,800
Why do you want to take risks?

652
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,640
I've decided.
- It won't happen.

653
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,110
It will!
- It's impossible!

654
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,880
For me, it is possible!

655
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,550
I'll make her say 'I love you' to me.
And I'll bring her here to meet you.

656
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,330
- Hi...
- Hi...

657
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,130
She is Priya, Thiru's girlfriend.

658
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,610
He is Tiger Kumar.

659
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,970
- Hi... - Hi, Kumar.

660
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,080
This is Yamaha Raj.

661
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,750
This is Shiva.

662
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,880
He is dumb...

663
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,590
- He is Kutty. - Hi Kutty...

664
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,530
She fell for him like he said.
- How did she fell?

665
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,900
He may have fallen at her feet.

666
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,530
I heard what you said...

667
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,190
Buddy, how did you get her?

668
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,200
Actually, when I
saw her for the first time...

669
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,030
Hey, don't act too smart...

670
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,500
I'll explain to them...

671
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,870
How did he express his love to you?

672
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,840
He didn't express it to me.

673
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,910
Then to whom?

674
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,330
108 days earlier...

675
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,020
Greetings.

676
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,040
What do you want?

677
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,780
I want to meet Mr. Guru.

678
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,280
Regarding?

679
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,120
I love his sister.

680
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,090
I want to talk to him about that.

681
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:30,990
Hey, what do you mean?

682
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,950
I love his sister.

683
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,290
I want to talk to him...
...about that...

684
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,740
- Allow him inside.
- Okay sir.

685
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,150
Greetings, sir.
- Sit...

686
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,780
What were you blabbering outside?

687
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,290
I didn't blabber. I said the truth.

688
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,960
Look, today is my birthday.
- Happy Birthday, sir.

689
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,030
Don't make me tense.
Come to the matter.

690
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,830
Sir, my name is Thiru.

691
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,370
I'm from Ayanavaram.

692
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,130
Sir, I love your sister very much.
- Hey...

693
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,140
I'm in a meeting.
I'll get back to you later.

694
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,660
What did you say?

695
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,810
Excuse...

696
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,120
Hey buddy, I'm in an important meeting.

697
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,820
I'll call you later.

698
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,490
Sorry sir.

699
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,380
Does my sister Priya loves you?

700
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,030
Is Priya your sister's name?

701
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,430
I've seen your sister.

702
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,070
But she hasn't seen me.

703
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,900
Are you mad?

704
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,100
Why sir?

705
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,740
You guys will first express your
love to your girlfriends.

706
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,770
Then to their parents.

707
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,070
Why are you
telling me?

708
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,870
Sir, that's old trend.

709
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,180
I just want to try something new...

710
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:55,870
How?

711
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,180
You will tell your sister about my visit.

712
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,380
Your sister will be
eager to see me in person.

713
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:09,290
I believe that this will help
develop her love for me.

714
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,030
Then?

715
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,530
You tell her about my visit.

716
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,140
She will definitely ask about me.

717
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,340
Look, again I'm warning you...
Today is my birthday...

718
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,900
I've promised not to hurt anyone.

719
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,340
Before I open my eyes,
vanish from here.

720
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,940
Hey, don't touch...

721
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,810
Sir, think again and tell me...

722
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,360
Sir, I've come with great hope.

723
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,650
Sir, please don't shoot him...

724
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,520
Hey, come on...

725
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,830
Come... get out...

726
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:43,760
Please explain to him.

727
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,360
I've understood everything.
Get lost, man.

728
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,530
Respect me.
- For you?!

729
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,100
He seems to be mad!

730
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,500
You took out a gun, he wasn't scared.

731
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,470
Are you calling him mad?

732
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,160
What did you say?

733
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,240
You aimed a gun at him,
but he stood rock steady,

734
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,510
You're calling him mad.

735
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,880
Hey, call the person
who had just left.

736
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,620
He is just leaving on a bicycle.
Do you want me to call him?

737
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,280
It seems he is going on a bicycle.

738
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,180
Bicycle?

739
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,040
Brother, why are you laughing?

740
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:21,740
Nothing, Priya.

741
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,880
Tell me, brother...

742
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,210
It seems a guy loves you...

743
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,440
He came and expressed it to me.

744
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,640
Me?

745
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,250
Yes.

746
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,480
How was he?

747
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,450
<i>"You tell her about my visit.</i>
<i>She will definitely ask about me".</i>

748
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,820
Please tell me brother...

749
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,190
Why are you bothered about him?

750
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,550
Sorry brother.

751
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,660
Sorry, I got angry in tension.

752
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:46,900
Okay.

753
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,690
Hey, I'll kill you...

754
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,700
Just one piece... little...

755
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,040
Sir, you're a business magnate.
Why are you cooking?

756
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,020
What are you talking about?

757
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,910
Priya is everything to him.

758
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,220
Business comes next.

759
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,740
Well said!

760
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,620
Who is it?

761
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,630
I got a missed call from this number...

762
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,460
Sir, it's me!

763
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,670
Just Rs.2 balance.
That's why I gave a missed call.

764
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,720
I didn't get you.
Who are you?

765
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,020
Sir, I came this morning
regarding your sister.

766
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,570
Sir, I told you about my love, didn't I?

767
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,440
What have you decided?

768
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,610
Hey, if I come there, I'll kill you.
Where are you now?

769
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,050
He cut the line.
- Who is he, brother?

770
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,520
The mad boy who came today
morning expressing love for you.

771
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,340
How did he get my number?

772
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,590
Saying "I want to fix a
Rs.80 millions worth business deal"

773
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,950
He got your number from watchman.

774
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,430
How did he look like?

775
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,390
Is it important now?

776
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,460
No. I'll be careful if
I know about him, won't I?

777
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,830
I'm sorry.

778
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,800
His face would've been recorded on CCTV.
Show it to her...

779
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,070
Hi...
- Hi...

780
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,610
How are you?
- You how?

781
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,220
Fine.

782
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:45,810
I started liking you the moment
I saw you on our TV monitor.

783
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,550
Wow! It has worked out!

784
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:49,100
What happened?

785
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:51,650
Thanks.

786
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:58,800
My friends said the man I love
must be more brave than handsome.

787
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,140
But you are handsome and...

788
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,260
...brave too...

789
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:08,910
Thanks again.

790
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,110
I've a lot to talk with you.

791
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,820
Shall we go somewhere else?

792
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:18,280
Oh sure!

793
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,050
Great, buddy!

794
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,520
Buddy, you trapped her within a day!

795
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,160
Where did you go first?

796
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,230
Thiru, they are all your friends.

797
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,800
Hi... - Thiru from Ayanavaram.

798
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,400
Where in Ayanavaram?

799
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,900
Saraswathi Road, 3rd cross street.

800
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,570
I know a Postman Palanivel there.

801
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,410
Oh no! My house is just opposite
to his house.

802
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,740
We have come very closer.

803
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,510
Where shall we go, beach or hotel?

804
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,910
Let's go to the hotel first.
- Why?

805
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,650
Only then, we can play well
in the beach.

806
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,160
Yes. You should play well with us.

807
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,130
Look, she's using double meaning.

808
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,690
Welcome Mr. Thiru.

809
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,070
Why did you stop here?

810
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,640
Let's go and meet my friend SI Kiran.

811
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,580
No...

812
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,040
Come on, Mr. Thiru...

813
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,340
No member of my family has ever
stepped into a police station.

814
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:16,920
Why?

815
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,550
In 1978, my father got
an offer to become an IGP directly.

816
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,460
He rejected the offer to avoid
entering the Police station.

817
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,320
Even my grandpa suggested
jumping over the threshold.

818
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,330
But my father refused outrightly.

819
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,130
After that?

820
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,170
Why are you digging the past?

821
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,070
Hey, why should we hear him?

822
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,360
Lift him...
- What?

823
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,770
Oh no! Oh my God!

824
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:46,210
Hey fatso! I suspected this to happen...

825
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,840
Oh no! What happened then?

826
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,080
SI was well known to me.

827
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,840
He told me,"Mr. Thiru, why did you come here?".
One call and I would've come myself.

828
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,350
I said it's a love matter.

829
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,530
Immediately he asked men to buy garlands.

830
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,320
Why?

831
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,690
To perform our marriage.

832
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,620
I said, first business and then marriage.
- You're right.

833
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,100
Hey, tell only the truth.

834
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,770
Sister...

835
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:12,600
Who is sister to you?

836
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,400
Remove your shirt.

837
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,150
Sister, don't force.
Ladies are here...

838
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,850
Who are we then?

839
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,950
Don't we look like ladies?

840
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,920
Rascal, get up... get up man...

841
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,190
Hey, what's this?

842
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,650
Face cream, Sister.

843
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,780
I wanted to be fairer
when I propose to her.

844
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,530
You ruined everything, Sister!

845
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,530
Again calling me sister?

846
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,290
If I had a brother like you,
I would've killed him.

847
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,190
If you call me 'sister',
will I spare you?

848
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,500
Oh no!

849
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,030
Forget it.

850
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,040
Flashbacks are never fully true.

851
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,240
Lies will creep into flashbacks.

852
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,810
I accept it!

853
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,740
After the incident he wouldn't have
come to your college, right?

854
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,980
I too thought the same.

855
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,750
But he was there before me.

856
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,900
Priya...

857
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,470
Hey, what do you want now?

858
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,370
Are you sure, won't you love me?

859
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,030
I won't.

860
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:17,880
Really?

861
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,670
Yes.

862
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,570
Then make a phone call and tell him.

863
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,210
Tell whom?

864
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,420
Tell my father.

865
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,860
Why should I inform your father?

866
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,580
Didn't I express my love to your brother?

867
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,780
You should tell my father
you don't love me.

868
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,380
Okay. Tell me your father's number.

869
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,660
Okay.

870
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,400
Priya, is this your phone number?

871
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,740
Okay. Send me an SMS about
tomorrow's meeting place.

872
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:50,080
Bye...

873
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,860
No Simran, I won't love you.

874
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,890
Whatever you say...

875
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,990
Oh no! You may have a car,
a bungalow, 2 dogs...

876
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,720
I can't do anything about it...

877
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,670
Why did you cut the call
and call back?

878
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,270
What's all this?

879
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,280
Whatever you say, I love only Priya.

880
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,650
You're like a mosquito.
How dare you love Priya?

881
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,940
Don't you know mosquitoes
won't allow us to sleep?

882
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,290
If I tell my brother, he will sack
them out, don't you know?

883
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,620
I'll come back again and buzz you.

884
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,860
How much ever you try,
Priya won't love you. You know?

885
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,900
I swear on you,
she will definitely love me.

886
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,530
I swear on you, I will never love him.

887
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,150
What ever you do, I won't love you.

888
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:00,880
Why?

889
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,100
Hey, her status won't match yours.

890
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,850
What is her status?

891
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,280
Do you know how much
she spends for a day?

892
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,720
As a leech, you should
know it better.

893
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,090
Hey, you're talking too much...

894
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,180
Hey, you're eating more...

895
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,530
Priya, he is a fraud.
Don't believe him.

896
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,730
Who is fraud?

897
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,600
Fraud? What's this? Cheat!

898
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,290
He has insulted me.
I'll take my leave.

899
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,670
I warn you again, don't believe him.

900
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,040
Priya, I love you.

901
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:26,380
Hey, take off your hand...

902
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,010
She won't suit you.

903
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:29,570
Why?

904
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,820
Did you see your complexion?

905
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,410
Fair complexion is a disease.

906
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,280
It can't bear neither cold nor summer.

907
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,190
Is this good complexion?

908
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,680
Go and see in Mahabalipuram.

909
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:42,250
Foreigners are taking sun bathes
to suntan their skin.

910
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,860
Today is Sunday.
Won't you leave me alone?

911
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,430
No day is against love.

912
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,320
All days are meant for love.
I love you.

913
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,500
I can't love you.
- Why?

914
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,410
Because my family is important to me.

915
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,310
You girls are always behind
your family members!

916
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,870
All they can give you is new clothes
and good care. That's all!

917
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,110
But I'm ready to give anything you like.

918
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,180
What can you do?

919
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,490
I'll sacrifice my life.

920
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,780
I'll sacrifice my life for you.

921
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,660
Okay then. Jump here and die for me.

922
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,330
You always mistook my words.

923
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,220
I didn't mean like that...
- Then?

924
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,700
What I meant was...

925
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,390
After you accept my love,
we will get married.

926
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,000
After our marriage,
I'll give you a life... a child.

927
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,800
A small family is a happy family.
You, me and our child.

928
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:34,280
In the future,
if I die before you in old age...

929
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,840
Our child will take care of you.

930
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,250
This is what I meant.

931
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,320
Now tell me, do you love me?

932
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,450
I will never love you. Get lost!

933
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,280
You will love me.

934
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,740
How can you say so?

935
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,890
Confidence.

936
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,660
An elephant's strength is it's trunk.

937
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,490
Hope is the strength of men.

938
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,900
I can take any risk to win your love.

939
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,430
Any risk? - Yes.

940
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,310
First, get back that ring.
Let's see how confident you are.

941
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,660
Priya, I think it's very deep.

942
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,720
Do you really want it back?

943
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,730
That's your wish!

944
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,140
Did you find that ring or not?

945
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,930
Buddy, tell me, did you find it or not?

946
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,510
No.

947
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,770
I know that you won't get it.

948
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,410
Now you know your confidence level?

949
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,140
Tsunami and earthquakes
are disastrous,

950
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,410
but don't shake our faith in God.

951
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,540
Similarly, you can't judge
my love with this ring.

952
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,720
It's fate's diktat that we should unite.

953
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,750
How can you say that?
- Yes.

954
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,720
The day I saw you at the temple,
I fell for you.

955
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,500
When I was very eager to
see you again...

956
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,760
I met you.

957
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,340
I was waiting for the moment
I'll see you again...

958
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,770
But it was fate.
I met you on that very day.

959
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,200
Whenever I wished
to see you, I did.

960
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,570
What do you say about that?

961
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,510
Love should blossom
on both sides.

962
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,380
One sided love is just a dream.

963
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,450
Stop dreaming and mind your work.

964
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:15,820
Whatever you say...

965
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,550
You will definitely fall for me.

966
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,710
I've that confidence.

967
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,390
Okay. If you're so confident
and believe in your fate...

968
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,230
Before tomorrow evening 5 pm,

969
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,560
will you manage to see me?
- I will.

970
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,740
Wherever you go in this world,
I'll see you.

971
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,930
If that happens, I'll believe you.

972
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,600
Okay?

973
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,440
Hey Priya, he is a dangerous boy.

974
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,180
He will definitely find you.

975
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,220
It's impossible for him
to find the place I'll be at.

976
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,110
What is that secret place?

977
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,090
Who is she?

978
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,520
She is from Coimbatore.

979
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,300
She was going to Postman Palanivel's house.

980
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,130
He has moved out, hasn't he?
- She doesn't know his new address.

981
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,830
Her train is at 5 pm.
She will wait here till then.

982
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:04,830
Please sit...

983
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,880
<i>If you're so confident and</i>
<i>believe in your fate...</i>

984
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,590
<i>Before tomorrow evening 5 pm,</i>

985
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,810
<i>will you manage to see me?</i>

986
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,600
How did you come here?

987
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:37,500
In an auto.

988
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,100
From Coimbatore?

989
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,600
<i>The dialed number is switched off.</i>

990
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,910
Hey... what man?

991
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,880
Who is he?

992
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,760
We have to go to the hospital.
Come home quickly.

993
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,160
Please mother...
today you take father with you.

994
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,260
Hey, what is it?

995
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,960
I've an important work.

996
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,300
It seems he has an important work.
He refused to come.

997
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,770
Is it more important than your health?

998
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,060
Did you take the X rays?
- Yes.

999
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,450
We will go to the hospital and come.

1000
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,360
You stay here.
My younger son will come now. - Okay.

1001
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:07,990
We will try to come back quickly.

1002
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,000
If it's time to catch the train,
you carry on... okay?

1003
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,510
- Is it Thirukumaran's house?
- Yes.

1004
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,340
Come immediately to Royapettah G.H.

1005
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,180
What happened?

1006
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,020
Driver, go fast.

1007
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:06,490
Okay.

1008
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:31,750
<i>If you're so confident
and believe in your fate...</i>

1009
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,920
<i>Before tomorrow evening 5 pm,
will you manage to see me?</i>

1010
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:22,030
<i>My eyes started dreaming about you...</i>

1011
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:29,910
<i>Your footsteps are lingering in my heart...</i>

1012
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:33,870
<i>You've touched my heart...</i>

1013
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:37,940
<i>I've taken a new birth because of you...</i>

1014
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:41,950
<i>Oh dear! Is this called love?</i>

1015
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:50,100
<i>My eyes started dreaming about you...</i>

1016
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:21,230
<i>After falling in love,</i>
<i>I've started writing poems...</i>

1017
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:29,430
<i>I avoid my friends...</i>
<i>I want to meet only you...</i>

1018
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:34,140
<i>I feel alone even in my parents' company...</i>

1019
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,950
<i>If you marry me,</i>
<i>my life becomes fruitful...</i>

1020
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:42,080
<i>Till yesterday, my home was my world...</i>

1021
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:45,390
<i>But today I would like</i>
<i>to join in your family...</i>

1022
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:49,850
<i>From the moment I love you,</i>
<i>I lived in your heart...</i>

1023
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:58,170
<i>My eyes started dreaming</i>
<i>about you...</i>

1024
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:33,640
<i>In dreams, I take your photos...</i>

1025
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:41,880
<i>I consider my dreams as true...</i>

1026
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:46,280
<i>Oh maiden! I never forget you...</i>

1027
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:49,920
<i>I can think only when I forget you...</i>

1028
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:54,220
<i>You're my breath...</i>

1029
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:57,460
<i>You're my life...</i>

1030
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:02,130
<i>True love never fails...</i>

1031
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:10,270
<i>My eyes started dreaming about you...</i>

1032
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:18,260
<i>Your footsteps are lingering in my heart...</i>

1033
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:22,220
<i>You've touched my heart...</i>

1034
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,190
<i>I've taken a new birth because of you...</i>

1035
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,490
<i>Oh dear! Is this called love?</i>

1036
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,480
I'm afraid of my brother.

1037
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,890
I fear that he may trouble you.

1038
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:55,290
Everything will end well, isn't it?
- Definitely.

1039
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,760
Okay. Touch one finger...

1040
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,330
Don't you believe me?

1041
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:04,160
Please... touch one...

1042
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,150
Whether your brother accepts or not,
I'll marry you.

1043
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,380
When did you find this?
- That day itself.

1044
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,560
Why didn't you give it to me then?

1045
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,680
Financial problems.
So I pledged the ring.

1046
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,560
You shameless...

1047
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,400
No Priya. I thought of returning it
the day you accept my love.

1048
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,460
If I didn't accept it...
you would've taken it.

1049
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,200
I knew you would accept my love.

1050
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:40,330
How did you know it?
- Confidence!

1051
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,410
Thiru, anyhow you've won her love.

1052
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,880
Your marriage should take place smoothly.

1053
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,020
What happened, Priya?

1054
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:23,700
Does your brother
know about us?

1055
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,750
Let's not talk here.
Let's go somewhere else.

1056
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:30,620
Tell me, Priya.
What happened?

1057
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:31,920
Nothing happened.

1058
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,360
I was really tensed...

1059
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,930
This is how you should be
afraid of my brother.

1060
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,400
Wait. I'll get you an ice cream.

1061
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,070
Hey 2 cornetto.

1062
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,780
Hi... how come you are here?

1063
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,580
No college?

1064
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,820
Have you come with friends?
- Yes.

1065
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:56,680
Where are they?

1066
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,650
They are nearby...

1067
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:25,980
Madam, ice cream...

1068
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:28,950
Sir, what would you like to have?

1069
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,920
Are you working here?

1070
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,390
You want me to believe that?

1071
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,410
Oh! Is it paining to you, if I beat her?

1072
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,400
Yes.

1073
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:53,440
Brother please...

1074
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,710
Brother, don't beat him...

1075
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,180
Please leave him...

1076
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:01,250
Brother, please...
please brother, leave him...

1077
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,860
Brother, don't beat him...

1078
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,390
Please leave him...

1079
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,070
Brother please

1080
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:54,840
Have it.
- No.

1081
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:57,810
Listen to me...

1082
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:59,140
I said no, right?

1083
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,090
You rascal, hang up the phone.

1084
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,540
Priya, what's all this?

1085
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,450
Priya has slashed her hand.

1086
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:43,830
I'm tensed. I'll call the doctor.
You come home quickly.

1087
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:57,970
I didn't call you here to perform
your marriage with my sister.

1088
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,440
I called you to protect my life.

1089
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,780
My sister Priya is my life.

1090
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,150
I also didn't come here for your word.
I came to protect my life.

1091
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,550
My Priya is my life!

1092
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,690
Forget Priya and mind your work.

1093
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,920
She won't suit you.

1094
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:14,750
She will!

1095
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:15,890
She won't!

1096
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,990
Sir, she will suit me.
We will live together.

1097
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,300
That's impossible.

1098
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,930
Sir, that's possible.
- Impossible.

1099
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,490
It's possible, sir!
- If it happens, I'll kill you!

1100
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,610
I'm ready to die.

1101
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:31,640
Hey, I'm tolerating you just
because my sister loves you.

1102
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,080
You know that she loves me, don't you?

1103
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,900
Can't you agree to our marriage?

1104
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:34,740
No way!

1105
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:37,150
Please, try to understand.
Why are you talking like a villain?

1106
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:40,850
Who is villain?

1107
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,590
I took care of her for years and
wish to marry her into a good family...

1108
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:46,720
Am I a villain to you?

1109
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:50,450
A jobless poor man like you chasing
her in the name of love, is a hero?

1110
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:51,520
Yes sir.

1111
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,430
A girl has her father's initial
till her marriage.

1112
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,330
After that she uses
her husband's initials.

1113
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:01,460
A. Kavitha becomes B. Kavitha.
And C. Uma, D. Uma.

1114
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,710
Everything is possible in love!

1115
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,480
That is the power of love!

1116
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,010
You cheats lure girls with these talks.

1117
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,580
Who is cheating?

1118
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,320
Your responsibility is over after
your daughter's marriage.

1119
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,390
After that it's we who look after them.

1120
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,290
That is love!

1121
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:18,590
Stupid love.

1122
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:20,750
You love and marry a girl.

1123
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,830
If there is any problem,
you will leave her.

1124
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:25,400
Even then, it's her relations
who support her.

1125
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,200
Love may break.
But not the relationship!

1126
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,100
Sir, I don't know about others.

1127
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,600
But I'll take good care of Priya.
- How?

1128
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,170
Will you feed her?
- Sir...

1129
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:36,680
What 'sir'?

1130
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,980
What qualification do you
have to marry my sister?

1131
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,080
Sir, what do I lack?

1132
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,610
Not handsome, no brain,
no status, no money.

1133
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,710
Sir, money isn't important to love.

1134
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,890
A loving heart is more than enough.

1135
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:49,950
Shit! You fool, be practical.

1136
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,990
A loving heart is enough!

1137
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,390
What can you do with a loving heart?

1138
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,690
Can you buy a kilogram
of rice or medicines?

1139
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,130
We need money to live.

1140
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:02,510
My sister prefers to dine
in 5 Stars hotels.

1141
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:05,400
You need to work a month
for one of her meals.

1142
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,040
You can sleep anywhere you like.

1143
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:11,620
But my sister can't sleep without an AC.

1144
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,780
You worry about what dress to go out with.

1145
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:19,820
But my sister worries about
which car to go out with.

1146
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:23,290
You can't keep her happy
even for an hour.

1147
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,690
I'll die, if she isn't happy.

1148
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:30,600
That's why I'm telling you...
Please forget my sister!

1149
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,060
You could've said this to your sister.

1150
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:37,700
She isn't listening to me.
- Then why should I?

1151
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:48,640
My beloved sister slashed
her hand in protest.

1152
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,320
I beat you.

1153
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,790
But still you respected my word
and came here.

1154
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,160
Because men are more
sentimental than women.

1155
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,130
That's why I'm requesting you...

1156
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,670
I never asked anything
from anyone in my life...

1157
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:12,670
For the first time, I request you...
to forget my sister.

1158
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,480
She is my world.

1159
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:21,190
Try to understand my feelings
and please forget her.

1160
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,660
Okay boss.

1161
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,660
I understand your feelings.

1162
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,400
Mere sentiments won't workout.

1163
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,300
If you finalize an amount,
I can take my leave.

1164
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:37,390
What?

1165
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,300
A settlement, boss.

1166
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,310
How much do you want, tell me?

1167
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,880
The product is yours.
You fix an amount.

1168
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,020
Two hundred thousands?

1169
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,750
What two hundred thousands?

1170
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,650
Do you think love is so cheap?

1171
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,390
What's this, Mr. Guru?

1172
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,700
By fixing an alarm at 5 am,

1173
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,590
waking up before it rings,

1174
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,760
silencing the alarm without
disturbing others,

1175
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,060
picking a few rupees in dad's pocket,

1176
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,470
we leave on our bike,
which breaks down half way,

1177
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,140
If we go to a petrol bunk
and ask to fill half a liter,

1178
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,710
he will look at us cheaply.

1179
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,880
Bearing all these insults,
when we come to the bus stop,

1180
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:20,410
a guy more handsome than me
will be standing there,

1181
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,450
that will give shivers down the spine,

1182
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:26,980
after over taking him and
getting the attention of the girl,

1183
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:30,620
someone else will stop you
from behind. It's the police!

1184
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,590
They will book us with an
eve teasing case.

1185
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:36,490
After facing all this,
when we go after the girl,

1186
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:41,870
she will say 'you dog, wastrel,
don't you have sisters'?

1187
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:45,340
She'll abuse not only me
but my entire family.

1188
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,770
Without bothering about all this,

1189
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:52,150
we manage to find a place
in her heart slowly.

1190
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,720
We make them feel
we are their everything,

1191
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,940
and everyone else are nothing.

1192
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,990
The hell we go through to achieve this,

1193
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,990
even a dog will feel for us
if it hears our tale.

1194
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,890
Drink water...

1195
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,460
You are tired hearing it.
How will I be after narrating it?

1196
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:15,070
Okay. Fix a price.

1197
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:19,140
I'm telling you again, the product is yours.
You fix the price.

1198
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,110
2 millions...?

1199
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,510
2.5 millions.
This is the final!

1200
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,440
There're 2 counterfeit notes.

1201
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:44,440
Hey, did we print them?
You got it by mistake.

1202
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,800
Just 2, isn't it?

1203
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,370
It's okay if it's false love,
but mine is true.

1204
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,640
Uncle, give me Rs.100.
- Why?

1205
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,150
For auto fare.
- What?

1206
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:01,380
This isn't included in the account.
Give me...

1207
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:04,680
Take it.

1208
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:10,060
You won't trouble me again in
the name of love, will you?

1209
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,070
Till now, I respected love.

1210
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,660
Hereafter, I will respect money. Bye!

1211
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,910
Don't insult your brother by
writing with a tiny pencil.

1212
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,690
Take Rs.1000. Buy pencils.

1213
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:12,300
- Take Rs.500.
- For what?

1214
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:15,270
You will make mistakes.
Buy erasers.

1215
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:18,040
Daddy, brother has a lot of money.

1216
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:18,840
What?

1217
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,970
Father is not able to sell
a piece of land, isn't he?

1218
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,480
I'll buy that land.

1219
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,890
Ask him the price.

1220
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:29,080
- What do you mean?
- I'm the telling the truth.

1221
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:30,590
If you don't believe me, look at this.

1222
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,420
Rs.2.5 millions.

1223
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,760
Where did you get this money?

1224
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:39,260
Tell him.

1225
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,630
Ask him where
he stole it?

1226
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,900
Feel happy that I have
made this much money.

1227
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:45,000
Do not doubt me.

1228
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:49,080
Swear on your mother and tell me
how did you get this money?

1229
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,410
Swear on me!

1230
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:54,350
Yes, he has stolen it from somewhere.

1231
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,950
No, I didn't steal.

1232
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:00,820
I know the pain one has to go
through to earn a penny.

1233
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:02,760
Where did you get this much money?

1234
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,550
- Tell me I say.
- Please tell him.

1235
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,760
I'll tell you.

1236
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,470
You know that I was in love.

1237
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,660
Her brother called me

1238
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,870
and gave me Rs.2.5 millions
to forget his sister.

1239
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:21,410
Between love and money,
I felt money was more important.

1240
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:23,910
So, I took the money.

1241
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,250
Till now, I thought that you are
not responsible enough.

1242
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,410
But now, I feel that you have no heart.

1243
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:35,820
How could you trade
a girl's love for money?

1244
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,020
You will never come up in life.

1245
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:40,800
Go away! Take all your
money and get out.

1246
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,330
Money is very important in life.

1247
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,990
It applies to you and not to us.

1248
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,230
Do you know what I'm going
to do with this money...

1249
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,530
Don't say anything.
First get out.

1250
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:55,640
Till now father used to say this.

1251
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:58,080
Now you have also joined him.

1252
01:17:59,050 --> 01:17:59,610
I will go.

1253
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,080
I thought of starting a new
business from our house.

1254
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,790
That will not happen.

1255
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,450
If you need money, ask me.

1256
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,590
If you feel shy to ask me
in person, call me.

1257
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:16,730
My phone is 9884062004.

1258
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:25,240
I'll bring lunch to your school.

1259
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,300
Where are you going, Priya?

1260
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:29,780
The doctor told you to take rest.

1261
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,040
I'm going to meet Thiru.

1262
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:38,150
- He won't meet you if you go now.
- Why?

1263
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,360
Tell me.

1264
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,490
You can't bear the truth.

1265
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,790
He loves your money and not you.

1266
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,940
What are you saying?

1267
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:47,840
He traded with your brother
and exchanged your love with money.

1268
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,260
- Did brother asked you to say this?
- No.

1269
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,080
I won't trust you.

1270
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:54,370
Priya, Muthukrishnan is right.

1271
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:59,740
I'm sure that he wouldn't have
traded my love with money.

1272
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:01,450
I trust him.

1273
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,420
I gave him the money.
Won't you believe me?

1274
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,160
No way.

1275
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:09,210
Will you believe if he says it?

1276
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,880
- No Priya.
- But my brother told me.

1277
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:15,820
Yes, he proposed it.
'I'll give you money,

1278
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,390
forget about my sister'.

1279
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,800
I rejected his offer.

1280
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:25,230
While I was leaving, he even gave
me Rs.100 to catch an auto.

1281
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:27,970
But I took nothing.

1282
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,800
So, you didn't take his money.

1283
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:33,880
- Do you believe me?
- Thiru...

1284
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,080
It's fine for your brother
to accuse me.

1285
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:40,310
But when you suspect me,
I can't bear it.

1286
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,460
Love is like a tree.

1287
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,050
Money is like the wind.

1288
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,590
When the wind blows,
the tree will shake.

1289
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,290
But it will never go with the wind.

1290
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,770
This is not only true for your brother

1291
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:54,770
but also for the entire world,

1292
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:56,770
money can't buy love.

1293
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:01,940
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

1294
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,080
I'm scared of my brother.

1295
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,720
How will you handle him?

1296
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,910
<i>I saw you accidentally...</i>

1297
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:42,110
<i>I fell for you knowingly...</i>

1298
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:51,130
<i>I saw you accidentally...</i>

1299
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:54,500
<i>I fell for you knowingly...</i>

1300
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,870
<i>I wonder what is going to happen...</i>

1301
01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:01,530
<i>I wonder what would be the end...</i>

1302
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,060
<i>I'm in troubles...</i>

1303
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,630
<i>I've lost my sleep...</i>

1304
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,510
<i>I saw you accidentally...</i>

1305
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,780
<i>I fell for you knowingly...</i>

1306
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,320
<i>I wonder what is going to happen...</i>

1307
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,760
<i>I wonder what would be the end...</i>

1308
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,450
<i>I'm in troubles...</i>

1309
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,080
<i>I've lost my sleep...</i>

1310
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:23,130
<i>I saw you accidentally...</i>

1311
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:26,570
<i>I fell for you knowingly...</i>

1312
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:53,490
<i>Your brother tortures me like Hitler...</i>

1313
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,790
<i>He is very affectionate to me...</i>

1314
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,370
<i>I'm his life, know that?</i>

1315
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:03,830
<i>And you won't understand that either...</i>

1316
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:07,000
<i>Tell me, sweetheart...</i>

1317
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:10,840
<i>If you don't tell me,</i>
<i>I won't talk to you...</i>

1318
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:17,640
<i>If a speck gets into my eyes,</i>
<i>he would stop the wind from blowing...</i>

1319
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:22,890
<i>Even if a thorn pricks me,</i>
<i>he would burn down the entire forest...</i>

1320
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:26,490
<i>I saw you accidentally...</i>

1321
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,620
<i>I fell for you knowingly...</i>

1322
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,680
<i>Love is a fort...</i>

1323
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:52,660
<i>Once your break the doors,</i>
<i>it's your hunting ground...</i>

1324
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,220
<i>Let's go inside...</i>

1325
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:56,020
<i>Will hunger hit us?</i>

1326
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,390
<i>I'm an iron man...</i>

1327
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,990
<i>It's fun till dawn...</i>

1328
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,300
<i>No, my darling...</i>

1329
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,500
<i>If my brother sees us,</i>
<i>he will kill you...</i>

1330
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:13,330
<i>Is your brother a don?</i>

1331
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:16,810
<i>Why is he against love?</i>

1332
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:22,050
<i>If you tries to hurt me,</i>
<i>I will cut his throat...</i>

1333
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:25,750
<i>I saw you accidentally...</i>

1334
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:29,090
<i>I fell for you knowingly...</i>

1335
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:32,560
<i>I wonder what is going to happen...</i>

1336
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:36,230
<i>I wonder what would be the end...</i>

1337
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,760
<i>I'm in troubles...</i>

1338
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,390
<i>I've lost my sleep...</i>

1339
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:42,340
<i>I saw you accidentally...</i>

1340
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,740
<i>I fell for you knowingly...</i>

1341
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,460
Now you know that he is a fraud?

1342
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,760
I'm ashamed to come to this house.

1343
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,900
- What did he say?
- He said the truth.

1344
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,100
What truth?

1345
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,460
He said he didn't take money from you.

1346
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,960
Scoundrel! He lied to you.

1347
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:21,080
If anyone speaks bad
about Thiru, I will die.

1348
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:26,750
Ask him to come here.

1349
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,360
Hello... come here immediately.

1350
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,460
<i>It would take a week...</i>

1351
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,260
I will rip you apart.

1352
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,420
I will talk to him.

1353
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,900
Why didn't you accept that you
took money from him?

1354
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:46,110
What are you talking about?
- I'll kill you.

1355
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:49,640
I said I will handle him.

1356
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:54,080
- Do you love his sister?
- Yes.

1357
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,220
- Did he tell you to forget her?
- Yes, he did.

1358
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,220
- What did you ask in return?
- Money.

1359
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:00,120
- How much?
- Rs.2.5 millions.

1360
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:01,920
- Did he give you?
- Yes he did.

1361
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,750
After accepting the money,
what did you tell her?

1362
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,260
I said I didn't take money from him.

1363
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,330
I said I will talk to him, right.

1364
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,360
- Did you come to the terrace?
- Yes, I did.

1365
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:12,690
What did he say?

1366
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,830
He asked me to forget his sister.

1367
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,660
- What did you ask in return?
- Money.

1368
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:18,240
- How much did he give you?
- Rs.2.5 millions.

1369
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,140
After accepting the money,
what did you tell her?

1370
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:21,200
I said I didn't take his money.

1371
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:26,980
You took money saying
that you'll forget her.

1372
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,350
Then why did you lie to my sister that
you never took any money from me?

1373
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:34,290
I took money from you saying
that I will forget her.

1374
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:37,550
It would cost you more to say
this to your sister.

1375
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,360
How much?

1376
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,490
I'm telling you again,
it is you who should decide.

1377
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,700
- Rs.1 million.
- Very happy.

1378
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,240
Rs.100 for you.

1379
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,180
For what?

1380
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,080
To catch an auto.

1381
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,410
Sorry. I've bought a car.

1382
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,380
Bye brother-in-law.

1383
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:28,270
Good morning, sir.

1384
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,510
Thiru, Priya has come.

1385
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,210
She is waiting for you.

1386
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:40,290
- Hi Priya...
- Hi...

1387
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:42,620
Again you are...

1388
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,160
Just a minute...
I'll finish my prayer.

1389
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:49,660
Tell me Priya...

1390
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:52,500
My brother told me that you
took money from him.

1391
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:53,440
But I don't think so.

1392
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:56,110
Why do you always trust others' words?

1393
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,740
Why don't you believe
your brother's words?

1394
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,440
So you accept that
you've taken money.

1395
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,550
I've seen you hiding
and watching us.

1396
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,710
Are you acting smart with me?

1397
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,890
I was a great shakes as an actor
in primary school itself.

1398
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,850
I got thunderous applause.

1399
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,660
Even our English teacher
praised my performance.

1400
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,250
Why did you love me then?

1401
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,430
Your brother threatened to kill me.

1402
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,030
Think for a while...

1403
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:25,560
Without accepting money, if I had
talked highly about our love...

1404
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,780
He would've paid two hundred thousand
to someone else and got me killed.

1405
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,040
Why others?

1406
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,470
If he pays my father just two thousand,

1407
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:35,170
He will surely kill me.

1408
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,040
My side is very weak.

1409
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,750
Priya, if I die, how long
will you cry for me?

1410
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,550
For a month?

1411
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,190
2 months?

1412
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:45,620
After that...?

1413
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,660
Your brother will send you to America
to change your mind.

1414
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,360
What will you do then?

1415
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,020
You will forget our country.

1416
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:55,030
When you can easily forget our motherland,

1417
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,800
it won't take much time to forget me!

1418
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,180
You're the one who sold our love

1419
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,060
and you're saying that?

1420
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,870
I got a good price, I sold it.

1421
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:03,940
What else do you want me to do?

1422
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:06,440
I don't know how to fight.

1423
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,160
Didn't you tell me that
our love is like a tree...

1424
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,590
...and it will stand forever?

1425
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,620
The wind won't do anything,

1426
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:15,060
but a typhoon will make it fall.

1427
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,540
Finally, what have you decided?

1428
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:21,790
Generally girls tell boys,
to find a good girl and marry.

1429
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,590
Now I'm breaking it.

1430
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,060
You marry a good man.

1431
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,220
What's this, Priya?

1432
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:46,190
Oh no!

1433
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,090
Where is the Bank of Baroda?
- Don't know, sir.

1434
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,760
No 52, Thirumalaiappan road...?

1435
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,870
Go straight and turn left...

1436
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,010
Okay thanks.

1437
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:21,790
What's this, Thiru...?

1438
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:26,430
I've given you the check
but there is no bank here.

1439
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,560
This bank doesn't exist anymore.

1440
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,300
Like your love!

1441
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,760
Till now you have seen
duplicate checks.

1442
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,400
But now, the bank itself is a false one.

1443
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:42,470
Hey, we have given you a duplicate check.

1444
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,360
Are you bargaining with my sister's love?

1445
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:51,920
Do you want me to
shell out your demand?

1446
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:52,990
That is okay.

1447
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,500
Didn't he ask for auto fare too?

1448
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,050
That was the height of his arrogance.

1449
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:58,320
Are you blackmailing me?

1450
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:02,230
Hey, I'm a born business man.

1451
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,000
You know only to solve problems.

1452
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,740
But I'm a master in creating them.

1453
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:11,440
You bean pole!
Showing your antics on me?

1454
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,900
Stop it with this.

1455
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,350
Or else I'll bury you here.

1456
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,050
Hey, I may look like a high class man.

1457
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:22,550
But if I stoop down
I'm a worse rogue than you.

1458
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:53,350
Sir, Collector is on the line.

1459
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,120
Excuse me...

1460
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,180
Yes sir...

1461
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,730
Oh my beloved... oh my darling...

1462
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:10,200
Who are you, sir?
- Can't you recognize my voice?

1463
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:13,280
Hey you wastrel!
Is this the time to call me?

1464
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:14,980
I'm sorry.

1465
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,180
Guru sir, don't get emotional...

1466
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:21,210
I would've replied to you there itself.

1467
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,280
But you may be carrying a gun.

1468
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,620
If you had shot me in tension,

1469
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,650
I would've died in slow motion.

1470
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,190
That's why I left silently.

1471
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,520
What do you want?

1472
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:34,360
Guru sir,
I've many photos with your sister.

1473
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,160
photographed with glamour...

1474
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,160
What do you mean?

1475
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:39,770
You pay the amount you were supposed to
and take the photos.

1476
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:40,880
If I don't pay you...?

1477
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:43,700
'Guru's sister is in love with Thiru

1478
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:45,730
Mr Guru is in depression.'

1479
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,510
If I pass this news on the Internet...

1480
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:51,710
You will go mad!

1481
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:56,180
After that you can't find anyone in
this world to marry your sister.

1482
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,010
Where do we meet?

1483
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,650
At the Bank of Lies.

1484
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:02,100
Didn't get me? At the same place!

1485
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,220
Hi, darling...

1486
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:18,300
Did you wait long?

1487
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,600
We just arrived.

1488
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,110
Had I known I would've
come half an hour later.

1489
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,320
What did you say?

1490
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:29,650
Am I a bean pole?

1491
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:31,750
I agree with you.

1492
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:34,560
But everyone else have only
1.4 kilograms of brain.

1493
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,490
I've 1.5 kilograms of brain!

1494
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,660
You will issue a fake check,

1495
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:43,570
and if I question you,
you will say it's a game.

1496
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,500
If the listener is stupid,

1497
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:50,870
you will say any
nonsense to him, won't you?

1498
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:54,880
What did you tell me?

1499
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,940
Are you a master in creating problems?

1500
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:00,910
Guru sir, your problems can't be solved.

1501
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,620
First we should analyze the problem,

1502
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,720
Only then we can solve it.

1503
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:06,460
Hey, give me the photos.

1504
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,020
Give the money.

1505
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,360
Check the amount.

1506
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:15,060
This time, I don't think you will take
any risk with your sister's matter.

1507
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,500
Here are the photos and negatives.
Check it out.

1508
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:19,900
See you!

1509
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:23,970
What did you say?

1510
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,650
Is your brain 1.5 kilograms?

1511
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:27,980
It will get blown up.

1512
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,380
Keep the suitcase down

1513
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:31,980
and leave that car you bought
with my money,

1514
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,710
catch a share auto and run away.

1515
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:37,060
Boss, he shouldn't live.
Shoot him...

1516
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,160
Why are you laughing now?

1517
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:43,370
I knew you would react like this.

1518
01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:45,870
So, before coming here, I've filed
a complaint to the Commissioner.

1519
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,100
If anything happens to me...

1520
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,240
The very next day,
the police will come for you.

1521
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:53,410
What?
- Your name is topping the list.

1522
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:54,700
I'm just an assistant.

1523
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,210
Don't take my words seriously.
Put down your gun...

1524
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:59,240
While you take care of your sister's life,
he may end mine.

1525
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:02,420
Duplicate copy of the complaint.

1526
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:06,990
Guru sir, you may be a worse rogue
than me if you stoop down.

1527
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:09,250
But I'm a born rogue! Bye!

1528
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:35,410
People welcome Dr. Karunanidhi's
Rs.2 a kg rice scheme. What's this?

1529
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,820
He gave us a newspaper
saying it's a police complaint.

1530
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,400
Come on... place this stone here...

1531
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:55,640
May your business flourish well.

1532
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:57,640
Pray well.

1533
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:46,720
Today we are going to meet Mr Thiru,
who is an upcoming businessman.

1534
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,820
Hello Mr Thiru...
- Hello.

1535
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:50,020
<i>How are you?</i>
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

1536
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:54,160
Mr Thiru, you're a leading
businessman at this young age...

1537
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:56,620
How did you achieve this?

1538
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,760
Generally people like visiting
places around the world.

1539
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:03,800
But I wished to be an all-rounder.
- Stop it man!

1540
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,120
I'll definitely achieve my goal.

1541
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:09,740
Is there any particular reason for
this tremendous growth?

1542
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,280
Normally, people wish to get
their salaries promptly.

1543
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,790
But I wished to be a owner.

1544
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,610
Heard him?

1545
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:21,020
According to me, hard work and
sincerity will pay you.

1546
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:21,790
Oh my God!

1547
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:27,830
For youngsters, give us tips
on how to succeed in business.

1548
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:30,230
- I thought about it...and you asked.
- Tell me.

1549
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,730
Don't desire others' money.

1550
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,760
Can you explain this?

1551
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:38,900
Why should we desire others' money?

1552
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:18,340
<i>Hi dear, how are you?</i>

1553
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:21,620
<i>Hi darling, I'm fine...</i>

1554
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:25,020
<i>Hi dear, how are you?</i>

1555
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,330
<i>Hi darling, I'm fine...</i>

1556
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,630
<i>I look like a small boy...</i>

1557
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:34,730
<i>But I'm the key to your lock...</i>

1558
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:41,900
<i>You're a good citizen...</i>
<i>You're a duplicate key to my lock...</i>

1559
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:44,910
<i>Hi dear, how are you?</i>

1560
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:48,270
<i>Hi darling, I'm fine...</i>

1561
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:18,340
<i>I'm a multimillionaire...</i>

1562
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:22,040
<i>Hey you bony, what do you own?</i>

1563
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,020
<i>You've a beautiful sister...</i>

1564
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,720
<i>And I'm lucky to be her husband...</i>

1565
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:34,730
<i>Don't compete with me</i>
<i>with sentiments...</i>

1566
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:41,270
<i>I'll win and give you a hot news...</i>

1567
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:47,200
<i>You can't win over me...</i>
<i>I won't get defeated...</i>

1568
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:50,440
<i>Ant can trouble an elephant</i>
<i>entering it's ears...</i>

1569
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,650
<i>Hi dear, how are you?</i>

1570
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:26,820
<i>If I wish, I can buy the heaven...</i>

1571
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:30,390
<i>A wastrel, nothing is possible for you...</i>

1572
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,790
<i>Your wealth can buy heaven...</i>

1573
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:37,350
<i>My brain can create heaven...</i>

1574
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:44,230
<i>Your wrong intention will pull you down...</i>

1575
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:51,150
<i>My will power will win over you...</i>

1576
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:55,710
<i>Cheats fail... they can't win...</i>

1577
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:59,020
<i>I'll win you and marry your sister...</i>

1578
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:02,080
<i>Hi dear, how are you?</i>

1579
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:05,290
<i>Hi darling, I'm fine...</i>

1580
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,790
<i>Hi dear, how are you?</i>

1581
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:12,060
<i>Hi darling, I'm fine...</i>

1582
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:15,070
<i>I look like a small boy...</i>

1583
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:18,870
<i>But I'm the key to your lock...</i>

1584
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,500
<i>You're a good citizen...</i>

1585
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:25,570
<i>You're a duplicate key</i>
<i>to my lock...</i>

1586
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:33,050
<i>Hi dear, how are you?</i>
<i>- Hi darling, I'm fine...</i>

1587
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:37,620
<i>You were listening to the song</i>
<i>from the film Mr. Bharath.</i>

1588
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:43,760
<i>You were listening to the program,</i>
<i>"Small boss and Big boss".</i>

1589
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:49,470
Thanks sir.

1590
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:50,980
Happy Diwali, sir.

1591
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:52,140
Thanks.

1592
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,380
Thanks, buddy.
- No thanks in friendship.

1593
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:09,650
I'm very happy, buddy.
Last year, we craved for this.

1594
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,960
Now we have reached this level
and are helping others.

1595
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,100
Okay then. I'll take my leave.

1596
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,930
Tomorrow don't forget to come
to my house. - Bye...

1597
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,320
Tomorrow your lunch is in my house.

1598
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,260
You should come definitely.
I will surely. - Okay.

1599
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,200
Are you fine?
- Yes.

1600
01:42:25,410 --> 01:42:27,100
Are you fine?
- How about you? - I'm fine.

1601
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:33,850
Welcome mother... take it.
- Greetings, dear. How are you?

1602
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:34,440
I'm fine.

1603
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:40,780
I was very much worried about him.
But now I'm peaceful.

1604
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,690
Tomorrow you should definitely
come to my house. - I will.

1605
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,130
- See you...
- Okay.

1606
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,320
Why are you bursting sparklers
like a girl? Fire crackers.

1607
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,760
Don't get scared...

1608
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:12,620
Hi Urmila...

1609
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:13,990
Happy Diwali.
- Same to you.

1610
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:17,900
Concentrate here...

1611
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:19,960
Why are you so afraid?

1612
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:21,940
Me? Not at all!

1613
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:25,420
He won't listen to us.

1614
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:46,230
Father, light it... mother, light it...
Why are you getting scared?

1615
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:48,920
Father, come on... what's this, dad?

1616
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:53,400
Watch now... how is it?

1617
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:36,210
Open it and give it to him.

1618
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,110
Hey, fire them one by one...

1619
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:44,660
Light this one...

1620
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:48,120
Hubby...

1621
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:07,850
Brother...

1622
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,740
Why did you come inside?

1623
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,650
If I stay there for few more minute.
I fear I might call him in.

1624
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:16,680
That's why...

1625
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:22,590
Shall I give him the new clothes
which we bought for him?

1626
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:24,000
Give him.

1627
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:26,060
But refuse to take anything from him.

1628
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:37,580
Mother, brother left.

1629
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,450
Brother gave me this shirt.

1630
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:52,320
He asked me to wear it inside
without father's knowledge.

1631
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:58,430
Brother asked me to give
these bangles to you.

1632
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:09,770
There's a land on auction at
Sholinganallur for unpaid loans.

1633
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,180
If we buy the land, we can start
a mineral water factory there.

1634
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,980
I heard that the ground water is good.

1635
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,410
Let's buy it.

1636
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,880
We can. But we'll have competitors.

1637
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:20,380
How many?

1638
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:23,890
Many builders like Arihant, Ceebros
and Salim's are coming.

1639
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,020
When they learn
we're interested...

1640
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:27,640
They will hold back.
Don't bother.

1641
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:34,730
Sir, no one has come to compete with us.

1642
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:03,630
Greetings, Muthukrishnan.
Are you fine?

1643
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:05,130
Are your family members fine?

1644
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:06,930
Sir, I'm in no way connected to him.

1645
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,360
He plans to break our relationship.

1646
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,770
I would've lost my job.

1647
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:17,080
Mr. Chandramohan, owner of 8 acres
of land in Sholinganallur.

1648
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:20,610
His land is on auction
for unpaid bank loans.

1649
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,580
The auction begins at 3.5 millions.

1650
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,240
Interested candidates can bid.

1651
01:47:25,190 --> 01:47:26,380
4 millions...

1652
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:29,960
5 millions...

1653
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:31,530
6 millions...

1654
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,090
7.5 millions...

1655
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:37,130
7.5 millions!

1656
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:43,300
7.5 millions once... twice... thrice.

1657
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:53,550
Muthukrishnan, see you then.

1658
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,440
Hey, I've lost 2.5 millions
in this auction.

1659
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:03,980
Still I've won against you.
That was my business plan.

1660
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,900
Business?

1661
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,830
Guru sir... I'm the cheat who sold
bus tickets in the black market.

1662
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,640
You've lost your 2.5 millions with your pride.

1663
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:17,670
But I've gained 2.5 millions
with my silence. - How?

1664
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:25,580
The land you bought is my father's land
which remained unsold for a long time.

1665
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:26,620
Look there...

1666
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:31,240
The man who is signing there
happily is my father.

1667
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,020
2.5 millions is fine to us?

1668
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:39,330
My dad tried a lot to sell
that land for a long time.

1669
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:45,100
I spread rumors about
the good ground water.

1670
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:49,460
You should've understood
finding no one here...

1671
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:53,780
I swear, my aim was not
to trap you in this...

1672
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:55,380
I was directed to anyone...

1673
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,910
But you voluntarily walked into it.

1674
01:48:58,350 --> 01:49:01,380
What I did was a plan.
What happened to you is fate.

1675
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:04,920
Bye, dear!

1676
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:42,130
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

1677
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,070
Hello, may I speak to Mr Thiru?

1678
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:49,260
Yes, Mr Guru...

1679
01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:51,170
Good! You recognized my voice.

1680
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,240
If I fail to do this... at this young age...

1681
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,210
How can I become
a big industrialist?

1682
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:01,280
- You'll pay for it now.
- I didn't get you.

1683
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:04,080
I agree that you've become
a big industrialist.

1684
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:07,320
But a big industrialist has
to face many problems.

1685
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:08,950
I don't know how you're
going to manage it.

1686
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:12,190
What man? No reply?

1687
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:18,160
I will spare 10 minutes of my day for you.
Didn't get me?

1688
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:20,570
Hereafter, you won't understand anything.

1689
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:24,500
You might've seen my anger...
you might've seen my style...

1690
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:25,800
But you haven't seen my game, right?

1691
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:29,310
This is known as Guru's game.

1692
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:34,080
I'm going to win sitting in my office.

1693
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,520
<i>Turn to your right and see...</i>

1694
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:49,890
We are from the Income Tax department.

1695
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:53,400
We want to search your place.

1696
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,970
Guru sir, I'm Thiru here...

1697
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,630
What? Got scared?

1698
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:24,700
Sir, please help me...

1699
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:28,210
Those men would've spoken
to you in English.

1700
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:29,070
How did you manage them?

1701
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,080
Mr. Thiru, we have fully
searched your office.

1702
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:36,840
Your construction, real estates,
departmental stores, exports...

1703
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:38,220
You've good records of accounts.

1704
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:42,920
But we want to know the
source for this business.

1705
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:45,490
How did you get money?

1706
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:48,290
You don't have evidence
of any bank loan.

1707
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,060
Then how is it possible?

1708
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:51,960
Come on tell us...

1709
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,370
- Please come out...
- Speak out...

1710
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:58,700
Reply please...
Tell me, where's the proof?

1711
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,230
Only my boss can answer you.

1712
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,210
Who is your boss?

1713
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:09,740
My boss!

1714
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:13,880
Sincere, dedicated and lucky man!

1715
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:14,460
Hey...

1716
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:21,860
Buddy, what you played was just a game.
But I've played with your fate.

1717
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:26,630
Didn't you say that you will
win against me sitting in your office?

1718
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,440
But I'll sit after winning against you!

1719
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:36,140
Didn't you ask me to turn right?
Now you turn left and see...

1720
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,850
Mr Thirukumaran pointed you
as his boss.

1721
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,560
It seems he is looking after
your business. Is it true?

1722
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,290
I don't know who he is.
I'm in no way connected with him.

1723
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,720
He is running his business in your name.
We have all the records.

1724
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:01,030
Sir, there are many Gurus.
How can I be responsible for it?

1725
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,010
He is worshiping your photo.

1726
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:04,580
Tea shops display
actress Trisha's photos.

1727
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:05,480
Does it mean she owns them?

1728
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,800
Is the photo the matter?
I'm in no way connected to him.

1729
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:11,640
Did you inform him that his
office was going to be raided? - No sir.

1730
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:16,110
Did Thiru inform you that we
were going to come here? - No sir.

1731
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:18,250
Then, give me your cell.
- Oh no! Yes sir.

1732
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:18,980
What's this?

1733
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:20,560
You both are answering differently.

1734
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:23,790
That's... his sister's love affair...
Sir, that is a different issue.

1735
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:26,420
What is that? Tell me...

1736
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:28,090
That is personal. Please...

1737
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,170
Okay. That is personal.

1738
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:31,640
Now answer me.
Did you give money to Thiru?

1739
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:34,530
Yes sir.

1740
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:35,640
Oh my God! No sir...

1741
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,270
Again answering differently?
- Sir, that is...

1742
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,450
Yes sir. We gave him.

1743
01:53:39,550 --> 01:53:41,170
Why? How much?

1744
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:42,980
- That is...
- Do you have the record?

1745
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:45,480
Yes that is... - Tell me...

1746
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:49,220
It's a taxable income.
- Please answer...

1747
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,950
Come on tell me sir... tell the truth...

1748
01:53:52,230 --> 01:53:53,190
Why did you give him?

1749
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:56,090
I just gave him money to
develop his business.

1750
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:01,000
Who will pay tax for that amount?
- I'll pay the tax for it.

1751
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,730
Okay then... problem is solved.

1752
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:06,370
- Thanks for the cooperation.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1753
01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:08,700
Hey, pay the tax.

1754
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:11,010
Sir, people won't pay the tax
for their own income.

1755
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:12,840
But you're paying taxes
on others' income.

1756
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:14,170
Do what I say, man!

1757
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:18,150
You will never spend for me!

1758
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:29,730
<i>I've been with you since morning,
bunking college.</i>

1759
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:32,130
<i>Why do you want to go there?</i>
<i>Better stay with me.</i>

1760
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:33,600
<i>You always want to leave early.</i>

1761
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:38,170
Okay. My family will search for me.
I'll take my leave now.

1762
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:39,240
Just a minute...

1763
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:41,970
Why?

1764
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:43,980
It may rain.
You shouldn't get drenched.

1765
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:49,610
- Take it.
- Joking? It's hot. How will it rain?

1766
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:52,450
It's impossible.
- It will rain.

1767
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:53,550
It won't...

1768
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,050
I'll take my leave.

1769
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:13,140
How did you know?
- I knew!

1770
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:14,480
Tell me, how did you guess it?

1771
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:16,300
They announced it on TV.
- That it will rain?

1772
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:17,310
No. That it won't.

1773
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:48,970
<i>I'm from Madurai...</i>
<i>I'm a lucky man...</i>

1774
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:51,450
<i>I'm a beauty from Pattukottai...</i>

1775
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:54,750
<i>If you come near me,</i>
<i>I won't spare you...</i>

1776
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:57,380
<i>Hey sexy lake...</i>

01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:00,460
<i>Can I row my boat in your lake?</i>

1778
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:03,430
<i>Don't blabber...</i>
<i>You're going to get it from me...</i>

1779
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:06,330
<i>I'm a</i> '<i>Yes man' to you...</i>

1780
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:09,460

1781
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:15,530
<i>Don't show off to me...</i>
<i>I won't marry you...</i>

1782
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:21,500
<i>I'm from Madurai...</i>
<i>I'm a lucky man...</i>

1783

1787
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:15,130
<i>I'll trap and win over you...</i>

1788
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:21,270
<i>I'll break your legs...</i>
<i>I'll teach you a good lesson...</i>

1789
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:27,280
<i>Don't hide your beauty...</i>
<i>Don't upset me...</i>

1790
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:33,310
<i>Don't kindle my anger...</i>
<i>Don't make me a killer...</i>

1795
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:23,270
<i>If you marry me,</i>

1796
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:26,310
<i>I'll give myself to you...</i>

1797
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,880
<i>Is it scientifically developed body?</i>

1798
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:32,110

<i>Later, I'll offer myself to you...</i>

<i>Don't show off to me...</i>
<i>I won't marry you...</i>

1811
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:42,090
Sir, he's Naresh Kumar.
He's a doctor in America.

1812
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:44,720
He earns 0.4 millions a month.
- Next?

1813
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:48,960
Sir, he's Rahul.
He's from London.

1814
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,430
I've only one sister.

1815
01:59:51,870 --> 01:59:55,330
Look for a groom who is near to me.

1816
01:59:55,770 --> 01:59:57,000
Sir, look at this one...

1817
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:03,310
People are saying he's the
next Ambani.

1818
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:06,380
Sir, his name is Thiru.

1819
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:07,950
He is an upcoming Industrialist.

1820
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:11,580
But I don't know where he got his money from!
- We know it.

1821
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,880
He is a master in business.
- He will be!

1822
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:19,790
I'll accept any man other
than him for my sister.

1823
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,390
Fix that American groom.

1824
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:30,640
Music band from Tanjore.

1825
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:31,830
Betel leaves from Kumbakonam.

1826
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:33,130
Food from Chettinad.

1827
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,210
<i>Jasmine from Madurai.</i>

1828
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:35,370
<i>And Halwa from Thirunelveli.</i>

1829
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:36,970
We couldn't get a groom in India.

1830
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:38,510
But we found one in America.

1831
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:40,080
Congratulations.

1832
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:42,180
He is congratulating you.

1833
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:46,260
First, let the marriage get over.

1834
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:47,650
Then I will teach you a lesson.

1835
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,230
See whether the marriage
gets done or not.

1836
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:50,620
Threatening me...?

1837
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:51,620
Wait and see.

1838
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:52,520
What?

1839
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:55,760
Wait...and...see.

1840
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:04,470
Priya...
- What's the matter?

1841
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:06,440
I've finalized a boy for Priya.

1842
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:07,810
The marriage is very soon.

1843
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,250
Priya... here...

1844
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:13,410
Brother... - What happened, dear?

1845
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:17,850
- I didn't tell you something.
- What is it?

1846
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:23,330
The day I accepted his love,

1847
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:26,660
we got married at the registrar's office.

1848
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:32,570
Sign here Priya.

1849
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:43,310
Why didn't you say this before?

1850
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:47,700
Do not tell your brother about
our marriage till I ask you.

1851
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:48,820
Why?

1852
02:01:49,590 --> 02:01:53,390
He might create unnecessary problems.

1853
02:01:53,730 --> 02:01:58,400
That's why...
- Okay I won't tell him.

1854
02:01:59,470 --> 02:02:00,260
Promise.

1855
02:02:06,570 --> 02:02:08,870
Your brother is my God.
Swear on him.

1856
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:13,510
I promise.

1857
02:02:14,850 --> 02:02:16,580
I swore on you.

1858
02:02:17,190 --> 02:02:20,940
I hid the truth to keep the promise.

1859
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:22,340
What else can happen after this?

1860
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:24,880
Shall I arrange the money?
- For what?

1861
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:26,960
He makes mountain out of a mole hill.

1862
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,190
Now he has a mountain.

1863
02:02:29,370 --> 02:02:30,350
Call him.

1864
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:42,740
The number you've dialed is switched off.

1865
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:57,190
The phone dialed is again switched off.

1866
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:02,300
Will the cell phone company greet the
callers with the caller's name?

1867
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:05,030
- Where is his office?
- In Mount road.

1868
02:03:09,070 --> 02:03:10,300
What?
- Checking.

1869
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:13,340
Sir...

1870
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:15,500
Remove your clothes.

1871
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:16,910
For what?
- I hear a beep sound.

1872
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:18,400
It's coming from your cell phone.

1873
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:19,940
Hello...

1874
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:21,550
Where is he?

1875
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:23,720
Find where he is.

1876
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,660
Hey...

1877
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:43,040
Welcome Mr. Idiot.

1878
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:48,100
What's here that needs a fan?

1879
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:50,510
The the fan's inventor will
commit suicide if he sees this.

1880
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:53,680
Why are you so tensed?

1881
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:59,080
You cheated my sister into marriage.

1882
02:03:59,190 --> 02:04:01,680
We love each other,
so we got married.

1883
02:04:01,730 --> 02:04:04,920
I spared your life because of my sister.

1884
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,720
Her marriage is due next week.

1885
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:11,290
Give me the registered marriage
documents and evidences

1886
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:15,140
and sign here that you're ready
to divorce Priya willingly.

1887
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:16,000
I can't.

1888
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:18,370
Sign here I say.
- I can't.

1889
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:21,770
Sign.
- No, I can't.

1890
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:23,680
I said sign here.

1891
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:25,180
Sign.

1892
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:27,580
Sign.

1893
02:04:35,230 --> 02:04:36,490
Marriage certificate.

1894
02:04:46,670 --> 02:04:50,870
Have I done anything that you don't like?

1895
02:04:53,110 --> 02:04:54,840
I built this house to your taste.

1896
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:58,450
I married the girl you liked.

1897
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:01,550
I always do the things you like.

1898
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:05,450
Then, why don't you understand my feelings?

1899
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:09,460
Your brother has never begged anyone.

1900
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:13,230
But I know how many insults
he had to bear for you.

1901
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:17,330
Even your parents wouldn't have
been so affectionate to you.

1902
02:05:19,710 --> 02:05:21,180
You must forget him.

1903
02:05:22,010 --> 02:05:23,480
It's not my decision.

1904
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:27,910
It's Thiru's decision.

1905
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:35,040
Your marriage certificate.

1906
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:39,720
Divorce papers signed by him.

1907
02:06:07,090 --> 02:06:08,720
- Hello. - It's me Priya.

1908
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:11,790
- How are you?
- Don't talk.

1909
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:13,120
Just listen to me...

1910
02:06:13,130 --> 02:06:15,430
If you say anything,
I'll hang up.

1911
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:17,960
<i>I have been crying all day.</i>

1912
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,630
Do you know why?

1913
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:21,970
Not because I fell in love.

1914
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:25,370
But for falling in love with
a wrong guy like you.

1915
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:28,100
<i>I thought you would reform some day.</i>

1916
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:33,070
But the moment you gave away our marriage
certificate and handed over divorce papers...

1917
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,060
Please listen to me.

1918
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,920
From now on, there is nothing between us.

1919
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:40,190
I'll marry my brother's choice.

1920
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,630
It will take a month.

1921
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:50,800
No way.

1922
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,470
I don't care about the cost,
but do it in 1 week.

1923
02:06:52,570 --> 02:06:53,220
I will try, sir.

1924
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:55,870
Don't try. Do it.

1925
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:56,500
Okay sir.

1926
02:06:57,210 --> 02:06:59,680
I'm very happy that Priya has
accepted this marriage.

1927
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:02,510
He shouldn't create any problem
in my sister's marriage.

1928
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:05,540
Remove the original certificates
in Registrar's office.

1929
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:14,430
No marriage was registered on the 24th.

1930
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,250
It did.

1931
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:16,760
That's the date on the certificate.

1932
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:17,390
Take a good look.

1933
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:19,560
What seal is this!

1934
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:22,230
The seal says "Saravana Stores, T. Nagar".

1935
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:28,440
What?
"Saravana stores, Ranganathan street".

1936
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:31,480
The marriage certificate is a fake.

1937
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:31,500
What?
The marriage certificate is a fake.

1938
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:32,280
What?

1939
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:33,780
It's a seal of Saravana Stores.

1940
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:36,010
Saravana Stores...?

1941
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,840
"Sparkling and magnificent..."

1942
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:38,920
Shut up.

1943
02:07:39,290 --> 02:07:40,750
What should I do now?

1944
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:44,060
He has given us a fake
marriage certificate.

1945
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:46,260
He will do anything.

1946
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:49,660
I've done many things for my sister.

1947
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:51,930
Just a murder.

1948
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:53,160
- Sir...
- No Muthu Krishnan.

1949
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:55,070
He is a criminal.

1950
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:56,740
He won't let me live in peace.

1951
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:59,070
He must die before Priya's marriage.

1952
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:01,310
No. My sister's life is important to me.

1953
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:05,560
Kill him.

1954
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:37,560
Get out.

1955
02:13:38,230 --> 02:13:39,400
- Get out.
- Listen to me.

1956
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,790
Listen to what? Get out.

1957
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:43,360
- Sir, please...
- Get out I say.

1958
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,600
I have smashed your men.
Beating you is not a big thing.

1959
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:59,610
What? You thought you'll reveal
everything and stop the marriage?

1960
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:02,790
I didn't hide anything
when I arranged this marriage.

1961
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:04,620
I won't let this marriage happen.

1962
02:14:08,230 --> 02:14:12,760
You took my money saying that
you'll have no relation with her.

1963
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:13,860
Then, why are you here?

1964
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:15,930
I took the money not to leave Priya.

1965
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:19,330
But to succeed in my love.

1966
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:22,560
You're the one who said that...

1967
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:26,660
To marry your sister one should have
a car, a bungalow and fame.

1968
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,180
Now I have all that.

1969
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:31,080
You should've gotten it with
hard earned money.

1970
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:32,050
I didn't have money.

1971
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:35,050
Even I wanted to become
a big business man.

1972
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,720
I had the skill to earn.

1973
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:39,720
But no one gave me a chance
to show my skills.

1974
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:43,120
You can't become Sachin,
if you don't get an opportunity.

1975
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:49,330
I asked my father to give me
money to start a business.

1976
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:52,800
He was ready to invest
on land but not on me.

1977
02:14:52,970 --> 02:14:54,600
I approached the bank for a loan.

1978
02:14:54,970 --> 02:14:58,820
They wanted a guarantor,
some surety or a property.

1979
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:03,280
Where would I go for all these?

1980
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:08,550
Loan are given on cows but
not on humans.

1981
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:13,140
I even approached a pawn broker.

1982
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:17,620
There I found out that a gold ring has more
value than educated youngsters.

1983
02:15:19,330 --> 02:15:20,920
I fell in love with your sister.

1984
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:25,100
You weren't concerned about my character,
skill or if I can look after your sister.

1985
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:26,920
You wanted me to
be settled in life.

1986
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:31,340
If people marry only those
who have settled in life,

1987
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,010
no one can marry in their 20's.

1988
02:15:33,010 --> 02:15:34,640
Marry only at the age of 60.

1989
02:15:34,750 --> 02:15:37,880
You can only go for a walk with her
but not live with her.

1990
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:42,190
What did you say the other day?

1991
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:45,820
I need one month's salary to
feed one meal to your sister.

1992
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:49,330
Today, my one day's earning can meet
her one month's expenses.

1993
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:55,760
Even I wanted to come up in life
and then marry your sister.

1994
02:15:57,210 --> 02:16:00,840
But I'm not an heir to riches.

1995
02:16:03,450 --> 02:16:06,040
My love was my only wealth.

1996
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:11,320
I pledged my love and
took money from you.

1997
02:16:14,260 --> 02:16:16,320
I've earned a lot from that money.

1998
02:16:18,590 --> 02:16:20,390
Take your money.

1999
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:22,030
Return my love.

2000
02:16:24,970 --> 02:16:27,380
I may have taken the wrong path.

2001
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:29,800
But I've made money in a honest way.

2002
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:32,870
I'm constructing a house for Priya.

2003
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,700
Once the construction is over,

2004
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:38,940
I thought of telling you the truth
and take Priya with me.

2005
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:43,560
I'll take very good care of your sister.

2006
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:46,720
Your permission is more important to me than Priya's.

2007
02:16:50,290 --> 02:16:52,240
If you still don't trust me...

2008
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,630
You made me sign the
divorce papers by force.

2009
02:16:57,440 --> 02:16:58,440
I will do it voluntarily.

2010
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:06,020
Stop.

2011
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:09,010
I don't like you.

2012
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:12,960
I don't like your personality and activities.

2013
02:17:14,550 --> 02:17:16,350
But I like you as a talented businessman.

2014
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:21,750
You could've taken her away
on the day you married her.

2015
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:25,900
But you wanted my permission for that.

2016
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:28,190
I like your sentiment.

2017
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:34,070
If it was someone else,

2018
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:38,020
he would've taken the money
and spent it on drinks.

2019
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:42,240
But with a will to win,
you've succeeded in business.

2020
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:44,450
I admire your love.

2021
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:49,000
You wanted to take better
care of her than me.

2022
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:52,890
I like that character in you.

2023
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:56,890
My brother might have accepted you.
But I won't.

2024
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:02,100
Have you both ever thought about me?

2025
02:18:05,410 --> 02:18:08,030
Love is not something
to be pledged.

2026
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:11,940
I did all this to keep you happy
and give you a comfortable life.

2027
02:18:12,050 --> 02:18:16,180
Did I ask you for a car or a bungalow?

2028
02:18:16,580 --> 02:18:19,210
I loved you knowing that
you had none of these.

2029
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:21,160
We don't need these
to fall in love.

2030
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:22,880
But after marriage,
we tend to want them.

2031
02:18:23,480 --> 02:18:24,920
No use brooding then.

2032
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:26,720
Let's brood now and be happy later.

2033
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:31,140
I wanted to see you only
after succeeding in life.

2034
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:33,400
That's why I didn't tell you either.

2035
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:36,470
Still, what you did was wrong.

2036
02:18:39,010 --> 02:18:40,300
Yes, it is wrong.

2037
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:42,500
Forgive me.

2038
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:46,520
Do you know how much
I've cried, missing you?

2039
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:52,290
From now on you'll be missing me and cry.

2040
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,750
You are saying that in anger.

2041
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:55,720
You still love me.
- No.

2042
02:18:55,790 --> 02:18:57,420
But I still love you.

2043
02:18:58,860 --> 02:19:00,540
If you don't love me anymore...

2044
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:02,980
Marry him.

2045
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,960
I'll be the luckiest man in the world...

2046
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:09,060
to be able to see my wife
marry someone else!

2047
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:11,720
I'll be watching.

2048
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:58,820
Do you have a brother?
- No.

2049
02:19:58,960 --> 02:19:59,920
I'm Thiru.

2050
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:01,430
I'm Angayarkanni.

2051
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:02,420
It's okay.

2052
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:03,250
Hey!

2053
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:12,800
You scoundrel! Rascal.

2054
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:16,040
Trying to tease me?
You're pulling my leg?

2055
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:17,720
I'll show you!

2056
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:19,000
Take this!

2057
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:20,370
But you were ready to marry him.

2058
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:21,580
I wasn't going to!

2059
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:22,540
I was pulling your leg!

2060
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:24,200
Me too... I was pulling your leg.

2061
02:20:36,130 --> 02:20:36,960
Give me money.

2062
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:39,900
You were like a good boy till now.

2063
02:20:39,940 --> 02:20:40,980
Asking him for money now?

2064
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:44,700
Just give me one rupee.
You're bringing me luck.

2065
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:46,910
What can you do with one rupee?

2066
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:49,980
He'll outshine Ambani with 50 pennies.
What a question!

2067
02:20:50,660 --> 02:20:52,540
Sir will do it... sir!

2068
02:20:59,150 --> 02:21:00,620
I can buy the world.

2069
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:01,240
But how?

2070
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:04,440
Confidence, boss. Confidence!
