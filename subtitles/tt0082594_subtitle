1
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,099
So kids. have you ever
heard of Muktar Singh?

2
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,586
No.  Then what do you
know of this world?

3
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,587
Muktar Singh is such 8 man

4
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:31,289
Both the police and the public of
this city fear Mukhtar Singh.

5
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:35,593
When he passes through the market,
it seems there's a curfew.

6
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,632
The market turns empty, and shops
are closed. - Then?

7
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:44,234
Today he made the mistake
of challenging me. - How?

8
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:50,606
Like the Government., he collects tax
from everybody.

9
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:54,485
From shopkeepers, merchants,
workers, etc.

10
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:59,058
Today he came to demand tax
from me. Ask why .. - Why?

11
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,989
For walking on the road!
- Well?

12
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,525
l asked: ''Why only me? What about
the other pedestrians?''

13
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:11,593
He said: '' Because the road wears out
more due to your long legs.''

14
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:15,295
The trouble started this way.

15
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,971
First, he caught my neck.
- Then?

16
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:22,456
l tripped him, then hit him
this way!

17
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:29,712
He lost his senses, and froth
came out from his mouth.

18
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:32,384
What happened then, Kallu?

19
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:39,127
l saw his dog coming.
You know what dog? - What?

20
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:41,888
An Alsatian dog!

21
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,464
He was bigger than a lion!

22
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,198
We looked at each other
and growled. - Then?

23
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,508
Like his master,
he leaped at my neck.

24
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:57,346
But, before he could jab his nails
into my neck, ..

25
00:01:57,615 --> 00:02:00,982
.. l put my hands into his mouth
and tore his body into two!

26
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:07,751
What happened after that?
- Then ..

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,657
Go away!

28
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:36,751
Get lost! .. Auntie, restrain him!

29
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:04,699
Why are you panting, Kallu?
- Who's panting?

30
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:09,034
Do you know what happened
in the market today? - What?

31
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:15,641
Have you heard of Mukhtar Singh? - No.
- Then what have you heard?

32
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:21,942
He's the man who's feared by both
the police and the public.

33
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:27,290
When he passes through the market,
it seems there's a curfew.

34
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:31,293
The market turns empty, and the shops
are closed. - Then?

35
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:33,826
He challenged me ..!

36
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,565
He's come here!

37
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:41,366
Then what happened, Kallu?
- Sister-in-law ..!

38
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,406
Out!

39
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:57,421
Uncle, your friend's gone;
come out now.

40
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:04,760
He didn't go, he ran away!
He's scared of me!

41
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:08,757
Everyone's scared of you. But you had
gone to buy potatoes.

42
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:14,061
l had forgotten;
l'll get them right now!

43
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:17,664
Munni, how are you?

44
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:45,363
Auntie, why are so many people here?

45
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:48,901
Don't you know? Ramdin is going
to have a child. - l see!

46
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:55,043
Where are you going?
- l may be required inside.

47
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:59,248
You'll be required outside;
if possible, help Ramdin.

48
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:12,161
Ramdin, what's the matter?
There's no need to get tense.

49
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,688
This is your first child, but l have
sired ten children. - You? - Yes!

50
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,665
l'm not married, but held the hands
of wives on such occasions.

51
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,405
Don't worry, you'll get a son!

52
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,912
Listen: have you heard the name
of Mukhtar Singh? - No!

53
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:35,117
Then what have you heard?

54
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:40,584
Both the police and the public
are scared of Mukhtar Singh!

55
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:42,725
When he passes, it seems as if
the city ..

56
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:55,866
The child's born! Listen everybody ..!

57
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:15,690
Ramdin has got a son!

58
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:28,965
Has your father sired a son?
- No, Ramdin has!

59
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:38,648
Get lost, or l'll cut you to pieces!

60
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:53,995
Did you bring the potatoes?
- No!

61
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:57,501
Narayan bashed me up on the way.

62
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,762
See this! - My God! Did Narayan
beat you up?

63
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:05,375
Listen to why he did it:

64
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:10,509
l was telling everyone the news
of Ramdin's son. ls this any reason?

65
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:15,452
Don't worry. l'll talk to your brother
about Narayan.

66
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,256
l've heard everything from Narayan -
it's all his fault!

67
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,119
He's getting out of control.

68
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:26,287
Why did you have to go there
as a local reporter?

69
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:30,796
Narayan only slapped you; l'd have
broken your face! Rascal!

70
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:34,964
Even you are scolding him!
- What else should l do?

71
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,203
He's making life difficult for me.

72
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,170
He doesn't do any work,
but can only eat.

73
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:44,970
He plays marbles and flies kites
with children.

74
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:50,333
When he gets time, he rubs salt
on people's wounds.

75
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:55,550
Narayan hasn't had a child for 5 years,
and he went there to celebrate!

76
00:09:56,827 --> 00:10:04,063
l won't listen to complaints
against you again! Understand?

77
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:09,897
Uncle!

78
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:15,912
You just did what everybody does.

79
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:19,881
You're angry with your bosses,
but took it out on your brother.

80
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:23,652
ls he responsible for the strike
in your factory?

81
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:28,991
Or the fact that there's hardly
any food in the house?

82
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:33,988
Sorrowed by your anger,
if he leaves our house ...

83
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:38,159
.. then even l won't stay here!
- He won't go anywhere.

84
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:45,838
He can leave me, but not you;
he'll return.

85
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:56,280
Long live mill workers!
Fulfil our demands!

86
00:10:57,354 --> 00:11:02,314
Bonus is not charity,
but a right of workers!

87
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:27,513
Bonus is not charity,
but a right of workers!

88
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:37,187
l agree to this. l'm the new owner of
this mill; l'll grant all your rights.

89
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:41,628
Who's your leader?

90
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:48,628
Shamu, go ..

91
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:57,774
l'm ready to give you
two months' bonus.

92
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:02,647
But work should start
right from this moment.

93
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:07,657
But we have one more demand.
- What is it?

94
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,522
All the machines in your factory
are either old or rusted.

95
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:17,198
An accident can happen any moment,
killing some worker.

96
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:22,028
So, we demand that the machines
be replaced with new ones.

97
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:26,907
Time is required for that,
and l don't have it.

98
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:31,576
lf the time of rich people is valuable,
so is the life of a worker.

99
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:36,686
Unless new machines are set up in your
factory, work won't start!

100
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:43,118
All right! l ask the workers ..
What do you want?

101
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:50,133
Your leader wants to strike,
but l want work.

102
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:54,303
What do you want?

103
00:12:54,905 --> 00:13:02,107
Hunger, or money? Strike, or bonus?
- Bonus!

104
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:07,106
Then it's decided!
Those who want bonus can enter.

105
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:12,180
Those who want to strike
can stand outside.

106
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:22,030
Abdul Uncle!

107
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:30,370
You had demanded the machines
to be changed .. but now ..

108
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:35,142
l haven't forgotten anything,
but remembered my children.

109
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:46,484
l can accept danger to my life,
but not my children's hunger!

110
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:12,274
Times have really changed!

111
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:16,646
Before, the leader used to walk
in front of the public.

112
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:24,150
Now, the public walks
in front of the leader!

113
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,335
You're an old player of the races.

114
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,831
But you've erred today, Sahani Seth ..

115
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,833
l've come from the mill just now.

116
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:41,709
You've put 15 lakhs
on a lame horse.

117
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:48,207
Rawat, l've spent my whole life
in the race-course; you're new.

118
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:56,085
You don't know: whoever wins
on a lame horse, wins a lot.

119
00:14:56,693 --> 00:15:01,790
And you don't even know
which game l'm playing!

120
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:14,639
l haven't bought this mill
just to manufacture cloth.

121
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:37,758
These lorries are carrying the gold
that was in our godown at Dongri.

122
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:40,466
lt could have fallen into the hands
of the police any time.

123
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:48,468
Now that gold will be hidden
with the cloths of this mill.

124
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,609
And will be sent
all over our country.

125
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:22,411
Abdul Uncle! ..
- No!

126
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:59,378
Shanti, nothing's happened to me.

127
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:12,254
No! Doctor, what have you done?
My hands .. - Please keep your courage.

128
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:18,267
My hands have been cut!

129
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:25,700
Brother, lie down.

130
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:34,850
What are you doing, Uncle?

131
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:39,016
l'm searching for my God
in the darkness of my heart!

132
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:46,352
l want to ask Him: why are you kind
to sinners like me ..

133
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:52,030
.. but angry with angels like him?

134
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,973
You should have cut my hands!

135
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:02,938
Why did you cut the hands that were
always raised to you in prayer ..

136
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,640
.. or to save the lives of others?

137
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:16,452
Munni, take your milk!

138
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:22,725
Come and take your milk!

139
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:31,832
Take this. - We don't want milk anymore.
- Why?

140
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:36,209
We spent all our money
for my husband's treatment.

141
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,211
Then take it on credit and pay me
from his salary next month.

142
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:44,544
Where will any salary come from now?

143
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:49,588
We don't want any milk.
- l'm feeling very hungry!

144
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,321
Keep quiet, there's no milk!

145
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:50,443
Which one? - This!
- Move!

146
00:19:56,193 --> 00:20:02,325
l hit it! .. Come on,
bring them out!

147
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:11,007
Brother!

148
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,644
The doctor told you not to get up,
and you're pulling this load!

149
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:21,279
The weight of Munni's tears
for a pint of milk ..

150
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,547
.. was far greater than the weight
of this load!

151
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:32,185
You go home, l'll take this.

152
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:38,132
From now on, Munni will never have to
cry for anything!

153
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:45,074
Take this milk ..
drink as much as you want.

154
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,476
The doctor is inside.

155
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,614
You shouldn't have lifted such a load
in this condition.

156
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:55,316
The stitches on your wounds
have been torn.

157
00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:01,220
l advise you to get another operation
done by some big doctor.

158
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:06,888
How much will this operation cost?
- At least Rs. 500/-

159
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:15,563
Where will we bring this money from?
- l'll bring it!

160
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:09,939
Sir, save my brother's life! Rs. 500/-
is required for his operation!

161
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:16,611
Rs. 500/-?
- Yes, Sir!

162
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:36,337
Rs. 500/- can save my brother's life!
- l can't give it to you.

163
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:41,476
l'm a simple industrialist.

164
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:45,448
l'm not responsible for
anyone's life or death.

165
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:52,312
Your brother was at fault,
but l suffered a loss.

166
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,326
His blood ruined cloth worth thousands.

167
00:24:57,694 --> 00:25:00,857
And there are also the repairing costs
for the machine.

168
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:07,237
For me, you come next to God. My brother
is fighting for his life.

169
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:13,508
Please save his life!
l beg you at your feet!

170
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:17,105
Watchmen, show him the board
on my gate:

171
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,780
''Dogs and beggars are not
allowed inside.'' - Sir!

172
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:32,457
Please listen to me! Save my
brother's life! l beg you!

173
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:08,163
Wonderful!

174
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:14,370
You came as a beggar first, and now
as a thief! You're progressing!

175
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:19,773
My request is the same even now: l need
Rs. 500/- for my brother's life!

176
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:24,537
My reply is also the same:
l can't give you any money!

177
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:30,750
You have a river of wealth here;
l'm asking you for only two drops!

178
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:36,925
Put back the money, or l'll have to
use this revolver!

179
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:44,267
l beg you, Sir! Rs. 500/- can save
my brother's life!

180
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:52,501
l've brought the money!

181
00:26:56,847 --> 00:27:02,183
Brother! .. No!

182
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:18,895
lnspector, he's the thief -
arrest him!

183
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:32,913
Sahani, you killed my brother! ..
l won't leave you!

184
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:57,169
Accused Kallu, because of robbing
at Mr. Sahani's house ..

185
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:01,236
.. and attacking a uniformed
police officer, ..

186
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:05,614
.. the court sentences you
to nine months in prison.

187
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,450
Have you anything to say
in your defense?

188
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:19,962
l feel this sentence
to be really unjust.

189
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:32,967
A child is born after nine months;
even Kallu will be reborn.

190
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:40,343
lf a child makes a mistake, there are
two ways of correcting him:

191
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:49,387
To make him understand with love,
or to punish him.

192
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:59,736
This is Kallu's first blunder,
but it hasn't been forgiven.

193
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:07,836
By punishing him, l feel the court is
putting him straight into the university.

194
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:14,614
Stepping into the university, he'll meet
big professors of crime.

195
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:32,026
Each professor will be an expert
in his subject.

196
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:40,569
They won't rest until he too
becomes an expert like them.

197
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:49,982
After 9 months, Kallu would have
got his new life.

198
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:11,537
You haven't finished with the clothes,
when will you do the utensils?

199
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:18,481
What has she done? - She stole,
the way you taught her!

200
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:24,414
Feeling very hungry, l took some
leftovers from their plate.

201
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:32,719
l didn't steal, he's lying! - Yeah!
Your mother and uncle are angels!

202
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:36,557
Don't say anything against my uncle!
- Get lost!

203
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:46,068
Sister-in-law, take Munni!

204
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:49,605
You hit this innocent child, Narayan!

205
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:15,532
What a stride! - Where are you going?

206
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:22,575
To kill his old enemy - Sahani Seth!
- l see!

207
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:27,142
We have all the items
required for murder.

208
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:32,421
Take this English pistol.
- And this Rampuri knife.

209
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:35,915
Take whatever you wish!

210
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:50,302
But, when Sahani Seth dies,
and you are hanged, ..

211
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:54,971
.. then what will happen
to your sister-in-law and Munni?

212
00:31:56,046 --> 00:32:00,574
You should kill your enemy
with his own weapon.

213
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:05,144
And Sahani's weapon is gold!

214
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,333
Kallu, sit inside, fast!
- You all go.

215
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:34,840
l'll come afterwards. l have to settle
an old account with this mill.

216
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:24,125
Fire!

217
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:07,731
lnspector, he set fire to my mill!
Arrest him!

218
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:17,507
Through this fire, l declare war
on you, Sahani Seth!

219
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,744
Henceforth, any step you take
will go towards your death!

220
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,752
lf you dare, tell these policemen about
what you've lost and what l've gained!

221
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:40,301
Kallu, because you set fire
to Sahani Seth's mill ..

222
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:45,372
.. this court sentences you
to two years in prison.

223
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,513
Your sentence is very long -
two years!

224
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:56,513
On the path which Sahani
has pushed me into ..

225
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,254
.. there will be many more
courts and prisons.

226
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:05,756
Behind me, there's only
the darkness of poverty.

227
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:10,925
But, ahead, the bright sun of wealth
is inviting me.

228
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:16,797
Kallu is about to turn Kaalia! ..
Come on!

229
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,171
Are you Kallu's sister-in-law?
- Yes.

230
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,543
Has he done something wrong again?
- Ask about what he's done.

231
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,820
What has he done?

232
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:37,251
ln one day, he has made profits
worth millions for our company.

233
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:41,130
We've made him our fourth partner.

234
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:48,600
Kallu made profits worth millions
in one day? l don't understand!

235
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,479
Just understand that we are jewelers.

236
00:36:55,846 --> 00:37:01,978
At first sight, we knew that your
brother-in-law was made of gold.

237
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,983
He is!

238
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:15,997
See this!

239
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,102
What is all this?

240
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:25,767
Kallu has earned this money.
And these are two keys.

241
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:30,942
One is of your new house,
and the other of your new car.

242
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:37,583
Before becoming a partner,
Kallu put two conditions:

243
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:43,916
That you won't stay in this slum,
and won't have to walk all the time.

244
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:52,391
So sit in your new car
and visit your new house.

245
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,311
ln one day, you've taken Kallu
to such heights!

246
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:07,311
God, give him success and abundance
in his work and earnings.

247
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:52,158
That is my plate!
- But you're not even in line!

248
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:58,562
The line always starts
from where l stand!

249
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,969
My name is written on this plate!
- Who are you?

250
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:39,608
l'm also a person who never stands
behind anyone.

251
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:45,848
The line always starts from where
l stand. .. Fill the plate!

252
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,969
You're lucky that you survived today,
Michael.

253
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:24,174
Your death was as near as this bar is
from you!

254
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:36,020
Kaalia can never attack
an unarmed man!

255
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:16,328
Sir, as you ordered, all prisoners
have been lined up outside.

256
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,576
That bloody jailer is coming!

257
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:37,415
How do you know? - Jailers and prisoners
are like husbands and wives.

258
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:44,219
For a successful marriage, they should
understand each other!

259
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,676
He'll descend four steps, then stop.

260
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,544
Then he'll feel his trouser pocket.

261
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,752
But he'll find his cigar
in his left shirt pocket.

262
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:20,329
He'll chew on the cigar, then spit.

263
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:32,165
He'll now light the cigar, and the
matchstick will land on my back!

264
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,313
Prisoner 602!

265
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:48,690
Here l am!
- Talk with your head bowed!

266
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:52,690
This head can never bow
in front of any human being.

267
00:43:53,396 --> 00:44:00,199
lt'll only bow at God's door,
or His court. - Very good!

268
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,901
l respect such heads.

269
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:08,744
But what you did in other jails
shouldn't happen here.

270
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:15,917
lf it does, you'll be really sorry!
l've read all your records.

271
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:20,818
Then you'll know that the jailer
of whichever jail l go to ..

272
00:44:21,424 --> 00:44:28,159
.. gets himself transferred, or goes
on a long leave. - l'm not like that!

273
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:32,159
l won't go on a leave, nor will
l apply for a transfer.

274
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:36,830
Even l have a record.

275
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:43,324
Any criminal who's been released from
my jail has only one prayer:

276
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:46,654
Never to come to my jail again!

277
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,089
You haven't eaten your food.
Has some prisoner irked you again?

278
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,123
Yes, there's a prisoner.

279
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:26,893
He's completely wild and unbridled,
like some wayward tempest!

280
00:45:27,504 --> 00:45:32,168
l'll have to bridle this tempest!

281
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:38,677
There was such a prisoner before,
whom you bridled.

282
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:45,945
But could you ever forget
the hoof marks he left on your heart?

283
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:58,592
No, l can never forget it!
l had only one daughter.

284
00:45:59,436 --> 00:46:04,806
She was 3 years old when that devil
abducted her.

285
00:46:05,576 --> 00:46:08,477
But l can't also forget
that l'm a jailer.

286
00:46:08,912 --> 00:46:14,373
lt's my duty to define to them
the meaning of hard punishment.

287
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:20,322
So that, after their release, they'll
never want to return to jail again!

288
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:31,191
The Sessions Court has accepted
your appeal.

289
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:37,071
l have commenced the order
for your release. You can go.

290
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:43,069
You must be sorry that you didn't
get time to reform me.

291
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:46,915
l'll get it in the future.

292
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:54,120
The path you have taken
ends right here.

293
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:58,192
You'll come again,
and l'll meet you here.

294
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:05,033
Your unfinished training will be
completed then. - All right.

295
00:47:05,636 --> 00:47:10,869
Just think that our contest with
each other has ceased for some time.

296
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:18,275
When the game starts again, we'll
pick up the pawns from right here!

297
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:34,029
Gopal!

298
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,503
How was it? - All right. But has
my sister-in-law learnt anything?

299
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:44,399
No. She only knows that
you're returning from America.

300
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,802
Here's your luggage.

301
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:51,671
There are saris for Bhabhi,
and frocks and toys for Munni.

302
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:55,549
The plane from New York has arrived;
Sir will be here any moment.

303
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:59,220
But nothing's ready here!
The dining table is empty.

304
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:02,754
As soon as he comes, he'll say:
''l'm really hungry'' !

305
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,623
''Everything's available abroad,
except food cooked by you.''

306
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:18,935
He's arrived! .. Ramu, set the table
and get the ''aarti'' items.

307
00:48:24,448 --> 00:48:28,282
Wait; first let me do the ''aarti''.

308
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,987
l keep going abroad all the time.
For how long did l go this time?

309
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:42,655
The house gets empty without you.
- Give ..!

310
00:48:45,135 --> 00:48:47,865
Your ''aarti'' is done.
What have you cooked for lunch?

311
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:49,696
l've come hungry from America.

312
00:48:49,973 --> 00:48:54,637
Everything's available there,
except food cooked by you.

313
00:48:57,548 --> 00:49:01,245
l've told you so many times not to
bring such expensive things for us.

314
00:49:01,618 --> 00:49:08,490
The wardrobes are already full.
- l bring them in my own interest.

315
00:49:08,826 --> 00:49:12,262
Wear whatever you like, and put away
the rest for Munni's dowry.

316
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:15,293
And nothing for your bride?

317
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,298
Before Munni, l'll get you married.

318
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:28,668
My husband desired your marriage
so much! - Don't ever weep!

319
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:34,349
For one drop of your tears,
l can shed my entire blood!

320
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,121
These are tears of gratitude!

321
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:47,195
How do you earn so much money?

322
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:54,429
My money comes from a gold mine.

323
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:57,467
Do you know where it is?
- Where?

324
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,771
Beneath your feet!

325
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:04,444
You'll never change!

326
00:50:17,494 --> 00:50:26,527
This is just a pistol .. l have
a license .. Here it is!

327
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:31,666
There's a govt. seal.
Do you believe now?

328
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:37,670
l trust you the same way
l trust God.

329
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:43,881
My entire world and life stand on
these two pillars of faith.

330
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:55,561
lt's a full-moon night,
and you are in this darkness!

331
00:50:58,802 --> 00:51:02,294
You don't know what happened today.
- What happened?

332
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:09,304
Seeing the revolver, Bhabhi
shivered once, and l got scared.

333
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:16,651
Today, l lied and handled
the situation.

334
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:22,454
But for how long will l hide
the truth? - l understand!

335
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:28,026
Your conscience is troubling you!

336
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:35,694
Then leave this luxury and pick up
a beggar's bowl!

337
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,243
Forget you ever had a brother
who died for just Rs. 500/-!

338
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:44,073
Send your sister-in-law
to some widows' home!

339
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:46,746
Put Munni in some orphanage -
our country has lots of them!

340
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:58,360
As long as l am alive, Munni
can't be an orphan! - My throat!

341
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:05,327
Never mind. See this card.

342
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:10,033
There's a party, which will be attended
by the princess of Jeetnagar.

343
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:12,465
She wears a particular diamond
on her neck.

344
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:18,146
lf you manage to get it,
your life will be blessed!

345
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:23,548
l'm ready, Sahani Seth.

346
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,427
People who go to get
priceless diamonds ..

347
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:36,425
.. shouldn't be dressed
as washermen!

348
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:41,927
Your bow looks as if
it's been borrowed!

349
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:47,966
Big shots of the city will be coming
to the place we're going to.

350
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:52,973
Kings, rich people ..

351
00:52:53,750 --> 00:53:03,455
Also hoodlums like you,
who'll be eyeing the diamond.

352
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:10,124
But today, that diamond
will become forever mine!

353
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:38,921
Who took the diamond
straight from my hands?

354
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:50,839
Sahani Seth, the diamond is
with me. - Who are you?

355
00:58:51,242 --> 00:58:58,410
Your master, whom you
created yourself .. Kaalia!

356
00:58:59,817 --> 00:59:03,753
Who's this Kaalia? - Don't worry!
Whoever Kaalia may be ..

357
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:09,490
.. l'll get you the diamond
within 24 hours! - 24 hours?

358
00:59:11,095 --> 00:59:18,160
lf you can do that, l promise
to give you this seat.

359
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:28,005
To get it, many of your colleagues
are ready to die or kill!

360
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:44,320
Search the entire flat, you'll
get the diamond right here!

361
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:41,173
Greetings, Sir!

362
01:00:44,822 --> 01:00:48,622
Did you see anything?
- l see many things.

363
01:00:48,892 --> 01:00:56,128
My hands work on shoes,
but my eyes roam everywhere!

364
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,431
Did you see anything particular
last night?

365
01:00:59,737 --> 01:01:05,835
l saw, but my tongue
feels scared to move!

366
01:01:13,384 --> 01:01:21,120
Will it move now?
- This isn't enough!

367
01:01:23,594 --> 01:01:25,926
Now?

368
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:32,797
Last night, a car came
and stopped out there.

369
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:36,972
The men inside were
watching your flat.

370
01:01:37,408 --> 01:01:43,404
Then you came downstairs
and went off in your car.

371
01:01:44,081 --> 01:01:49,314
Then? - They went and barged
into your flat.

372
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:56,391
After sometime, they returned
and went off in their car.

373
01:02:00,364 --> 01:02:10,000
Here's Rs. 50/- ..
Tell me the number fast!

374
01:02:14,378 --> 01:02:18,212
What are you doing?
- l'm searching for the number!

375
01:02:18,682 --> 01:02:26,088
l don't know which cell of my brain
it's hidden itself in!

376
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:42,732
See the 100-rupee note and come out!
.. lt's come out!

377
01:02:58,122 --> 01:03:02,422
l like this toy of yours.
- Sir, it's not a toy!

378
01:03:02,726 --> 01:03:05,957
lt's a magical bird
that flies in the air!

379
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:11,167
You won't get such goods everyday;
buy it immediately!

380
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:17,765
First l'll take a test drive.

381
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:26,877
Here are the keys -
drive and see how it glides!

382
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:45,267
Tell me a little thing.
- Yes?

383
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:49,872
Who took this car
from your showroom last night?

384
01:03:53,944 --> 01:03:59,541
l can't tell it to you!
- You can't?

385
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:08,352
My showroom!

386
01:04:09,793 --> 01:04:14,628
Stop the car! You are crazy!

387
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,539
Have you come from an asylum?
Leave me!

388
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:55,428
Put on the brakes!
What are you doing?

389
01:04:59,743 --> 01:05:03,577
The hood's gone!

390
01:06:15,552 --> 01:06:22,048
Mr. Champion, l'm the only son
of my parents!

391
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:41,068
Tell me who it was, or l'll strip
this car! - l'll tell you!

392
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:50,219
Sahani Seth's man Rawat!

393
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:41,570
You entered my house last night!

394
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:47,602
Henceforth, if you even look towards it,
you'll become like this!

395
01:07:48,745 --> 01:07:51,680
There won't be any roof over you,
or ground beneath you.

396
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:59,385
And the pieces of your body will fly
in the air like paper! Understand?

397
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:05,519
One more thing!

398
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:08,188
Those who know the value of diamonds ..

399
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:12,195
.. don't hide them in mattresses
or pillows.

400
01:08:12,903 --> 01:08:15,531
They attach them to themselves!

401
01:08:20,844 --> 01:08:23,039
Like this!

402
01:08:33,223 --> 01:08:38,456
l want that diamond, and you can
get it! - What diamond?

403
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:44,192
Due to it, my life is lying at stake
with Sahani Seth!

404
01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:45,363
lt's tied to Kaalia's wrist
in a gold chain.

405
01:13:31,421 --> 01:13:34,322
Did you get the diamond? - Yes!
- Where is it? - With me.

406
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:42,396
Where are you? - Me?
.. With the diamond!

407
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:47,030
What rubbish!
- My job's over from today.

408
01:13:47,904 --> 01:13:52,864
l want a share - fifty-fifty!

409
01:13:53,910 --> 01:14:00,816
Look behind you. Those two guys will
turn you into fifty-fifty!

410
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,478
Mother!

411
01:15:44,715 --> 01:15:49,084
See what l've brought!
We're not poor anymore!

412
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:55,686
Get up and see what the sun
of wealth looks like!

413
01:15:56,327 --> 01:16:03,495
My days are over.

414
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:18,713
My daughter Rina is not your
younger sister, as you think.

415
01:16:19,316 --> 01:16:23,776
What are you saying?
- Many years back ..

416
01:16:24,588 --> 01:16:30,857
.. someone had abducted
and brought you ..

417
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:38,694
.. and left you with me.
- Why didn't you tell me before?

418
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:49,206
How could l? That butcher
had threatened to kill me.

419
01:16:50,681 --> 01:17:03,685
But what fear do l have now? ..
He was .. - Tell me!

420
01:19:18,162 --> 01:19:24,123
Rawat, l'm drinking this to
your success and my happiness.

421
01:19:24,568 --> 01:19:27,128
l applaud you.

422
01:19:28,071 --> 01:19:32,303
Taking the diamond from Kaalia
was as difficult as ..

423
01:19:33,177 --> 01:19:37,136
.. snatching a chunk of meat
from a tiger's jaws.

424
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:41,549
l'm now fit for this seat,
Sahani Seth. - No!

425
01:19:44,454 --> 01:19:46,354
Not as yet!

426
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:56,699
The diamond in Sahani's glass
is a fake, like your success!

427
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:02,730
What rubbish are you saying?
- l'm speaking the truth.

428
01:20:03,774 --> 01:20:07,232
Bathing fake diamonds in wine
doesn't turn them real.

429
01:20:07,744 --> 01:20:11,441
Like bathing in the Ganges doesn't
turn donkeys into humans.

430
01:20:12,482 --> 01:20:16,680
This is the real diamond!

431
01:20:22,326 --> 01:20:25,295
You've recognized this diamond.

432
01:20:25,929 --> 01:20:29,626
Now look carefully
and try to recognize me.

433
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:34,565
l'm that same Kallu,
whom you turned into Kaalia.

434
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:42,170
l had heard that God writes
the destinies of human beings.

435
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:47,944
But you wrote mine by cutting
my brothers hands.

436
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:55,554
From now on, don't try to
use your hands too much ..

437
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:00,094
.. nor should you try
to stretch them too much!

438
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:13,206
lf you stretch them,
l'll cut and crush them!

439
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:19,644
She'll become conscious after
some time; l'll come again.

440
01:21:21,952 --> 01:21:26,013
Till then, give her these medicines
every two hours.

441
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:08,627
What are you looking at? - What l
haven't seen in you for many years.

442
01:22:09,099 --> 01:22:15,595
Anxiety, hope, and love. When your
daughter had fallen ill ..

443
01:22:16,073 --> 01:22:20,976
.. you had sat like this
for three days and nights.

444
01:22:23,849 --> 01:22:28,847
Yes. Rani would also have been
of the same age now.

445
01:22:29,447 --> 01:22:37,136
Who knows where she is,
and in what condition?

446
01:22:39,516 --> 01:22:43,316
Look after her and give the medicines
every 2 hours. - Yes.

447
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:02,505
How's your wife? - She's well,
and has returned from the hospital.

448
01:23:10,648 --> 01:23:14,516
Did your daughter pass her exams?
- She passed last year..

449
01:23:14,785 --> 01:23:18,186
.. and is now attending college.

450
01:23:23,994 --> 01:23:26,462
What's happened to him today?

451
01:23:27,097 --> 01:23:32,057
For the first time,
l'm seeing him so gentle.

452
01:23:33,037 --> 01:23:37,633
He treated us like humans,
and also spoke like one!

453
01:24:04,234 --> 01:24:09,433
Where's the girl? - She's gone.
- Where? - l don't know!

454
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:13,335
Why did you let her go?
- l didn't let her go.

455
01:24:13,711 --> 01:24:17,772
l had gone to make tea.
When l returned, she was gone.

456
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:21,816
l regret even leaving this place.

457
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:32,118
lt's not your fault. For how long
would she have stayed here?

458
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:38,632
Daughters have to leave their homes
one day or the other.

459
01:24:39,603 --> 01:24:44,336
And she didn't have any kinship
with this house or me.

460
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:48,743
Madam, it's ready.
- Keep it here.

461
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:57,819
Where are you preparing to go?
- You are going. - Where?

462
01:24:58,122 --> 01:25:01,819
To visit Munni. See her letters.

463
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:06,659
She asks only one question: ''When will
Uncle come to meet me?''

464
01:25:07,431 --> 01:25:10,093
lf l could, l'd have gone to
meet her every week.

465
01:25:11,168 --> 01:25:14,501
But what can l do?
My feet are tied.

466
01:25:14,838 --> 01:25:18,831
l wonder when you'll be able to
stay with me restfully.

467
01:25:23,113 --> 01:25:23,977
Very soon.

468
01:25:32,122 --> 01:25:36,354
l have to settle some accounts
with the world.

469
01:25:37,227 --> 01:25:41,220
Once they are settled,
there'll only be rest after that.

470
01:25:47,571 --> 01:25:51,632
l'm leaving the school,
but why are you crying?

471
01:25:52,009 --> 01:25:57,174
Because you're leaving.
- Don't cry!

472
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:02,148
Life offers only two paths
to human beings:

473
01:26:03,086 --> 01:26:06,817
The right, and the wrong.

474
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:10,491
l used to follow the wrong path.

475
01:26:10,861 --> 01:26:14,991
But l promised my dying mother
to leave that path.

476
01:26:15,766 --> 01:26:23,036
That's why l can no longer pay
my sister Rina's fees.

477
01:26:23,707 --> 01:26:29,202
Don't get disheartened. You're sitting
in front of the Son of God.

478
01:26:29,913 --> 01:26:35,317
And God surely helps those who decide
to help themselves.

479
01:26:36,253 --> 01:26:42,886
l have full faith that He will
send someone to help you.

480
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:17,020
l never thought God would answer
anyone's prayers so quickly.

481
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,658
l don't understand.
- l prayed to Him just now ..

482
01:27:23,267 --> 01:27:28,398
.. to send a kind angel.
And He has sent one!

483
01:27:29,373 --> 01:27:35,209
Where's this angel? - He's standing
in front of me!

484
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:39,811
Uncle!

485
01:27:52,029 --> 01:27:55,988
Why are you crying?

486
01:27:56,900 --> 01:28:03,703
She's also crying; she hasn't paid
her school fees, and is leaving.

487
01:28:04,007 --> 01:28:08,341
lf she leaves the school,
l'll cry a lot! - Enough!

488
01:28:08,879 --> 01:28:10,052
l won't let anyone of you cry.

489
01:28:11,223 --> 01:28:14,383
And l won't let you cry either

490
01:28:14,669 --> 01:28:19,541
Your school fees had been paid.
Now you will not leave Munni.

491
01:28:20,119 --> 01:28:21,031
Really, uncle

492
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:23,169
You too give me a kiss

493
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:24,170
come on

494
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:27,171
Sister

495
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:34,641
You paid my fees.
- Not me. he paid it.

496
01:28:36,526 --> 01:28:37,642
Let's go

497
01:28:44,174 --> 01:28:47,716
l didn't even imagine that we would
meet again. that too here.

498
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:52,037
l didn't even imagine that
you would do thing to me.

499
01:28:53,809 --> 01:28:54,038
What have l done?

500
01:28:56,725 --> 01:28:58,039
You have made a charity

501
01:28:59,415 --> 01:29:01,040
You know that you have
0iven it to me.

502
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:05,786
Won't you like to take it back?

503
01:29:06,463 --> 01:29:11,771
No. Mother Superior told
me about your ga0a

504
01:29:11,772 --> 01:29:15,693
ln some way our aagas are similar,
and not are well.

505
01:29:18,281 --> 01:29:21,011
We were both following
the same path.

506
01:29:21,385 --> 01:29:25,344
You faced a bend from which
you could have turned back.

507
01:29:25,856 --> 01:29:30,520
But l've reached a position
from where l can't return.

508
01:29:31,061 --> 01:29:37,022
Even l didn't have any way.
But you arrived ..

509
01:29:37,834 --> 01:29:42,203
.. to save my wayward
and dissipated life.

510
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:47,051
lf you look carefully, you'll see
my selfishness even in this.

511
01:29:47,761 --> 01:29:50,889
l didn't save you, but saved myself.

512
01:29:51,699 --> 01:29:53,997
l thought l had lost everything.

513
01:29:54,368 --> 01:30:01,774
But, after coming here, l've found
that there's still something remaining.

514
01:30:03,711 --> 01:30:11,777
A bit of idealism and integrity
that could help somebody.

515
01:30:12,686 --> 01:30:20,320
l've met you before, but now l feel
l'm meeting someone else.

516
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:32,630
Even l've met a person who had become
completely alien to me.

517
01:30:34,475 --> 01:30:38,206
After a long time, l've met myself
again today!

518
01:35:52,989 --> 01:35:57,653
Jagir Singh, your goods have arrived.

519
01:38:35,051 --> 01:38:40,284
Wow! How superbly
you lifted the glass!

520
01:38:43,993 --> 01:38:46,223
Now do something for me:

521
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:51,433
My briefcase is there
in that cabin.

522
01:38:52,101 --> 01:38:58,438
l've kept a gift for you inside it.
Go and get it.

523
01:39:16,959 --> 01:39:21,623
That was Jagir Singh,
the uncrowned king of our docks.

524
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:28,126
Our goods would reach the docks,
but Kaalia would take them.

525
01:39:30,073 --> 01:39:35,409
The situation is similar
at Madh lsland.

526
01:39:36,446 --> 01:39:42,351
Gold is sent to us from abroad,
but reaches Kaalia.

527
01:39:43,553 --> 01:39:48,286
And these Madh lsland people
sit on the shore, fishing!

528
01:39:51,194 --> 01:40:02,002
lf this happens again, you'll all
end up like Jagir Singh!

529
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:07,665
Don't stare at me like that!

530
01:40:08,511 --> 01:40:12,572
Think of some way
to defeat Kaalia.

531
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:19,649
He's not some angel, but human ..
like you and me.

532
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:26,722
A human being can be destroyed;
he has to have some weakness.

533
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:33,596
Find Kaalia's weakness;
it is our strength!

534
01:40:35,037 --> 01:40:37,437
My biggest weakness is
my sister-in-law.

535
01:40:38,107 --> 01:40:42,100
Will you go this way
in front of her?

536
01:40:44,046 --> 01:40:49,643
Then how should l go?
- This indecent dress won't do.

537
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:53,946
Wear this sari.

538
01:41:21,651 --> 01:41:23,915
l'm ready!

539
01:41:33,996 --> 01:41:39,161
l'm ruined!
- What happened?

540
01:41:40,269 --> 01:41:46,333
lt looks like you've tied
a turban around you!

541
01:41:46,709 --> 01:41:49,701
Let me show you
how to wear a sari.

542
01:41:54,116 --> 01:41:59,679
A part of it should be attached.

543
01:42:04,193 --> 01:42:08,630
A part should be suspended.

544
01:42:11,567 --> 01:42:18,837
And a part should be folded ..
like this!

545
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:29,307
Now the sari is ready! lnstead of
dropping the hem from your shoulder ..

546
01:42:31,387 --> 01:42:34,652
.. put it over your head.

547
01:42:39,328 --> 01:42:40,852
The face should be covered,
like the moon by a cloud!

548
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:52,029
Exposure is a western fashion;
shyness is lndia's ornament.

549
01:42:52,742 --> 01:42:54,334
My sister-in-law really likes it.

550
01:42:56,178 --> 01:43:03,380
Bhabhi, the girl l'd told you about
is here. - Bring her inside.

551
01:43:06,922 --> 01:43:12,986
So she's the one who you've been
lauding so much.

552
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:18,459
Don't you like her?
- Let me see her first.

553
01:43:18,968 --> 01:43:23,098
Why has she covered her face?
ls there some mark?

554
01:43:23,973 --> 01:43:26,271
No! - lsn't she as lovely
as the moon?

555
01:43:26,709 --> 01:43:32,238
You never see anything in sunlight;
how can you see the moon?

556
01:43:33,983 --> 01:43:37,976
She's beautiful, but what about
other qualities?

557
01:43:38,354 --> 01:43:44,418
She's very educated:
she's done her matriculation!

558
01:43:44,727 --> 01:43:46,251
l didn't ask about her degrees.

559
01:43:46,562 --> 01:43:51,966
Can she use her hands
for household work? - Hands?

560
01:43:52,735 --> 01:43:57,195
She's an expert in sleight-of-hand!
- You shut up!

561
01:43:57,506 --> 01:44:01,704
l'll ask everything myself.
.. Don't mind, Sister ..

562
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:06,172
Before buying gold, one has to
examine it thoroughly.

563
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:12,615
Can you cook?
- She can cook all dishes:

564
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:16,955
lndian, western, Chinese,
Russian ..

565
01:44:17,326 --> 01:44:23,492
She can cook pulav, biryani, and my
most favorite dish: omelet!

566
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:28,728
Then come to the kitchen
and make an omelet.

567
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:39,839
Here are the eggs, frying pan,
and ghee. How long will you take?

568
01:44:45,388 --> 01:44:51,258
Two! .. ln two minutes!
- All right.

569
01:45:49,852 --> 01:45:53,413
What have you done?

570
01:46:04,833 --> 01:46:10,390
She's very nervous today, so she erred.
She'll learn everything in time.

571
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:13,259
Just tell me whether she has passed
or failed.

572
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:19,504
Passed!
- She's passed!

573
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:37,396
Why are you closing so early?
l've come to buy flowers.

574
01:46:38,067 --> 01:46:41,798
A customer came and bought
all the flowers.

575
01:46:42,372 --> 01:46:45,068
Who's this connoisseur
in Bombay city?

576
01:46:45,408 --> 01:46:47,899
There's only one: Kaalia!

577
01:46:50,913 --> 01:46:56,078
Make me a nice bouquet.
- No flowers are left.

578
01:46:56,486 --> 01:46:59,421
But what about all these flowers,
and the ones on that truck?

579
01:47:00,156 --> 01:47:03,819
All these flowers are for Mr. Kaalia.

580
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:09,664
ls this man new in Bombay?
- You don't know Mr. Kaalia!

581
01:47:10,299 --> 01:47:13,200
His name is on everyone's lips
nowadays.

582
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:16,370
Yes, they will reach there.

583
01:47:34,757 --> 01:47:39,956
You can't help me. l wanted
to buy a small bouquet.

584
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,657
But it seems all the flowers
in this city have been sold.

585
01:47:42,999 --> 01:47:45,695
To only one person - Kaalia!

586
01:47:46,069 --> 01:47:50,631
Yes. Do you know him?
- No.

587
01:47:51,174 --> 01:47:56,043
But l definitely want to know -
who's this Kaalia?

588
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:01,014
Kaalia is the king of crime,
like this pawn is of chess.

589
01:48:01,918 --> 01:48:09,347
ln chess, others are killed, but
the king remains safe till the end.

590
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:15,761
This might be the same Kaalia
who had once come to my jail.

591
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:26,108
How did he become a king so soon?
- Go and see for yourself.

592
01:48:26,976 --> 01:48:31,276
Kaalia is giving a party today,
and dared to even send me a card.

593
01:48:32,048 --> 01:48:37,315
He's written that l should bring
a full platoon with me!

594
01:49:05,348 --> 01:49:09,808
There's Kaalia,
whom you wanted to meet.

595
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,620
Congratulations!

596
01:49:16,726 --> 01:49:19,661
l've recognized him.

597
01:49:20,096 --> 01:49:24,328
He's come very fast from prison
to this palace!

598
01:49:25,101 --> 01:49:28,798
l've seen something else, which
you may have missed, Mr. S.P.

599
01:49:29,205 --> 01:49:34,768
Today, crime is so prosperous,
and the law so helpless!

600
01:49:57,033 --> 01:50:01,436
Mr. Jailer, l'd forgotten to invite
you, but l'm happy you've come.

601
01:50:02,138 --> 01:50:05,437
l was your guest once,
now you are mine!

602
01:50:10,546 --> 01:50:14,778
You must be sorry that l didn't
stay with you too long.

603
01:50:15,918 --> 01:50:18,614
And you couldn't extend me the
hospitality you'd have liked to.

604
01:50:19,155 --> 01:50:20,986
l'll get more opportunities
for that.

605
01:50:21,257 --> 01:50:27,890
But now, l want to meet the person
for whom you bought so many flowers.

606
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:43,535
This is Shalini, my fiancee.
- l've met her before.

607
01:50:44,347 --> 01:50:51,810
She was unconscious then ..
and even now!

608
01:50:53,456 --> 01:50:57,586
You're not in your senses to say
such things on such an occasion.

609
01:50:58,394 --> 01:51:06,665
l wish l could pray for your
eternal happiness as a wife.

610
01:51:07,937 --> 01:51:16,174
But l can see what none of you can.

611
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:21,341
When criminals travel on
the flashy road of success ..

612
01:51:21,984 --> 01:51:30,119
.. they forget that this road ends
at the prison, or the scaffold!

613
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,888
Then listen to me too:

614
01:51:34,347 --> 01:51:38,875
What delight is there in troubles,
if death doesn't come at youth?

615
01:51:39,585 --> 01:51:43,988
What delight is there in a funeral,
if there's no weeping?

616
01:56:43,411 --> 01:56:45,811
You? .. Here?

617
01:56:46,748 --> 01:56:51,481
l had come to meet Kaalia,
but it seems he's not at home.

618
01:56:52,087 --> 01:57:00,426
Yes, he's gone out for some work.
- But l've met you at least.

619
01:57:01,729 --> 01:57:06,029
When l had met you first,
what a condition you were in!

620
01:57:06,468 --> 01:57:10,564
But see your grandeur today!
You people have really progressed!

621
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:17,103
We have progressed only due to
Kallu's hard work. - Wrong!

622
01:57:17,946 --> 01:57:22,849
Through hard work, one can build
a hut, not such a palace.

623
01:57:23,151 --> 01:57:27,451
l know this, because l too
live in such a palace.

624
01:57:27,956 --> 01:57:33,155
The tree of wealth grows only
on the soil of crime. - No!

625
01:57:33,595 --> 01:57:37,429
My brother-in-law can never bring
sinful earnings into my house!

626
01:57:37,966 --> 01:57:42,369
lt seems he keeps telling you
false stories, and you believe them!

627
01:57:43,238 --> 01:57:49,438
He'd go to jail, but tell you
that he was going abroad.

628
01:57:50,145 --> 01:57:55,208
lf you don't believe me, then go
and enquire at any prison.

629
01:57:55,583 --> 01:58:01,749
You'll find his entire life story
in the registers there.

630
01:58:08,396 --> 01:58:12,924
Where are you going? - l won't stay
in this house any longer!

631
01:58:13,401 --> 01:58:16,336
What happened?
What have l done?

632
01:58:16,604 --> 01:58:19,767
Even outsiders didn't do
what you did!

633
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:22,335
They had only cut
my husband's hands ..

634
01:58:22,610 --> 01:58:25,670
.. but you've stabbed my heart!
- What are you saying?

635
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:29,507
What have you left for me to say?

636
01:58:30,084 --> 01:58:33,349
The light of my life left me
along with my husband.

637
01:58:34,022 --> 01:58:37,685
But the lamp of faith in you
kept burning.

638
01:58:38,826 --> 01:58:41,556
Even that's got extinguished today!

639
01:58:42,096 --> 01:58:46,055
l considered your brother to be Ram,
and you to be Laxman.

640
01:58:46,501 --> 01:58:50,562
l didn't know that my Laxman
had turned into Ravan!

641
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:54,600
Let me go; you can enjoy
your golden Lanka!

642
01:58:55,143 --> 01:58:59,603
Who had come here to tell you
false stories?

643
01:59:01,082 --> 01:59:04,540
lf they are false, swear on me
and tell the truth!

644
01:59:04,919 --> 01:59:09,652
That you've earned all this wealth
through labor, not crime!

645
01:59:11,092 --> 01:59:16,359
Through labor, one can erect a hut,
not such a palace. - Enough!

646
01:59:16,864 --> 01:59:21,324
You've started speaking the words
of your brother's killers!

647
01:59:21,903 --> 01:59:27,569
l can no longer stay in this hell.
- Then was the place we left heaven?

648
01:59:28,843 --> 01:59:32,404
Where, to save the repairing costs
of a faulty machine ..

649
01:59:33,181 --> 01:59:37,049
.. two strong hands and a young life
could be cut!

650
01:59:37,785 --> 01:59:42,984
Where Rs. 500/- could be spent
for some brief entertainment ..

651
01:59:43,291 --> 01:59:47,625
.. but not to save a life
and a family!

652
01:59:49,564 --> 01:59:55,503
There's no sin in my blood,
nor was it in my mother's milk.

653
01:59:57,005 --> 02:00:01,669
The venom of sin
was injected into me.

654
02:00:02,343 --> 02:00:05,870
Until l spit this venom onto
the faces of my enemies ..

655
02:00:06,681 --> 02:00:09,673
.. l can't even think about
sin or virtue.

656
02:00:10,385 --> 02:00:14,845
But l can! ..
Therefore, l'm leaving!

657
02:00:15,557 --> 02:00:19,891
lf you even step outside,
you'll see my corpse!

658
02:00:20,929 --> 02:00:23,227
What oath have you sworn?

659
02:00:23,799 --> 02:00:29,465
l can't go outside, yet can't stay
here with a sinner like you!

660
02:00:30,839 --> 02:00:34,935
Even if the sinner wants
to reform?

661
02:00:36,211 --> 02:00:40,944
Think that the sinner
has changed his ways.

662
02:00:42,184 --> 02:00:47,451
Henceforth, whatever l did
won't happen again!

663
02:00:54,029 --> 02:00:56,463
You won't leave me now,
will you?

664
02:00:57,265 --> 02:01:00,757
l could have left Kaalia, but where
will l go if l leave my Kallu?

665
02:01:21,556 --> 02:01:26,994
Who? Kaalia?
- Yes; l want to meet you.

666
02:01:27,562 --> 02:01:31,999
When, and where?
- Whenever and wherever you wish.

667
02:01:33,835 --> 02:01:36,303
lt's ten now.

668
02:01:36,838 --> 02:01:42,003
Can you meet me at 1 1 near the ruined
church at Madh lsland? - Why not?

669
02:01:43,044 --> 02:01:50,610
You'll come first; but you'll keep
your car headlights on. - Okay.

670
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:10,032
Get my car.
- At once!

671
02:02:10,572 --> 02:02:18,206
But you won't drive, l will; because
l'll have to go alone today.

672
02:02:48,977 --> 02:02:54,677
Sahani Seth, today l'll do to you
what you did to Ramani Seth.

673
02:02:55,016 --> 02:03:03,515
lt's the rule in our profession
that seats are only snatched!

674
02:03:07,996 --> 02:03:15,960
What's this? - You're not taking me
along, so you might need this!

675
02:03:21,643 --> 02:03:23,873
But, seeing your conduct,
l've changed my decision.

676
02:03:24,379 --> 02:03:29,407
You and your weapon
will now come with me!

677
02:04:11,926 --> 02:04:15,555
Why are you glancing at
your watch all the time?

678
02:04:16,431 --> 02:04:20,026
A driver should always
look at the road.

679
02:04:26,107 --> 02:04:30,601
The car is air-conditioned,
but you're sweating!

680
02:04:31,146 --> 02:04:35,276
What's the matter?
- Nothing!

681
02:04:35,717 --> 02:04:39,084
Rawat, stop the car.

682
02:04:40,121 --> 02:04:42,453
Open the bonnet.

683
02:05:14,789 --> 02:05:19,453
You should have thought of
some new stratagem to kill me.

684
02:05:20,495 --> 02:05:27,128
l am an old player of this game.

685
02:06:07,008 --> 02:06:13,641
Sahani Seth, you had drawn a line
of blood between you and me.

686
02:06:15,416 --> 02:06:19,978
lt would have ended with the death
of either of us.

687
02:06:21,122 --> 02:06:26,856
l've come to tell you that
l've erased that line myself.

688
02:06:28,429 --> 02:06:37,235
Your death was near - but thank
those hands that turned back the clock.

689
02:06:38,139 --> 02:06:41,540
But don't think that
you've defeated me.

690
02:06:43,511 --> 02:06:50,576
Today, l'm not drawing, but throwing
a weapon in front of you!

691
02:06:51,619 --> 02:07:01,688
But fear that day when you'll force me
to pick up a weapon!

692
02:07:30,291 --> 02:07:32,657
The court has heard the full story
about the murder ..

693
02:07:32,927 --> 02:07:35,828
.. and the testimonies
from both sides.

694
02:07:36,197 --> 02:07:39,860
The accused has himself
made my work very easy.

695
02:07:41,002 --> 02:07:46,804
The corpse was found in
the arms of the murderer.

696
02:07:49,244 --> 02:07:54,477
The accused's fingerprints
were found on this knife.

697
02:07:55,350 --> 02:08:00,515
Bloodstains were found
on the accused's clothes.

698
02:08:01,155 --> 02:08:07,287
There's no doubt now that this
killer committed the murder!

699
02:08:07,895 --> 02:08:14,562
l don't have to tell the court what
punishment such a murderer deserves!

700
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:26,103
Such a murderer deserves death,
but the crime should be proved!

701
02:08:30,318 --> 02:08:35,381
The foundation of our country's
law and justice is that ..

702
02:08:35,990 --> 02:08:44,159
.. one cannot be considered a criminal
unless proved guilty!

703
02:08:45,567 --> 02:08:52,803
None of the witnesses produced were
present at the scene of the crime.

704
02:08:53,975 --> 02:08:59,413
They spoke about what happened
before or after the crime.

705
02:09:00,282 --> 02:09:07,688
ln a murder trial, an eyewitness'
statement is the most valuable.

706
02:09:08,823 --> 02:09:14,386
Until such a witness is produced,
the accused cannot ..

707
02:09:14,663 --> 02:09:18,929
.. get the punishment that
my colleague is demanding!

708
02:09:21,436 --> 02:09:23,904
l agree with my worthy colleague.

709
02:09:24,806 --> 02:09:28,435
An eyewitness is most valuable
in a murder trial.

710
02:09:28,810 --> 02:09:32,576
l'm sorry that l couldn't produce
such a witness before.

711
02:09:33,481 --> 02:09:37,850
But l can do so now!

712
02:09:39,287 --> 02:09:47,285
This witness saw the murder happen
with her own eyes!

713
02:10:07,082 --> 02:10:16,684
Swear on this Gita: ''l will speak
nothing but the truth''.

714
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:28,301
What relationship do you have
with the accused?

715
02:10:28,737 --> 02:10:30,466
He's my brother-in-law.

716
02:10:30,805 --> 02:10:37,472
ls it true that he was dearer to you
than a son? - He is even now.

717
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:44,678
Did you see him commit
the murder? - Yes!

718
02:10:48,189 --> 02:10:51,625
l have nothing more to ask.

719
02:10:54,129 --> 02:10:57,496
Don't ask anything
to my sister-in-law.

720
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:06,405
For me, her words are always
like the words of God.

721
02:11:08,777 --> 02:11:14,113
Throughout her life, she has spoken
only the truth.

722
02:11:14,983 --> 02:11:19,613
lf she's seen me commit this murder,
then l have committed it!

723
02:11:20,722 --> 02:11:23,452
After this, l don't want
to make any statement.

724
02:11:24,092 --> 02:11:36,061
l only want to confess that
l have committed this murder!

725
02:11:57,625 --> 02:12:00,423
l was waiting for you, Kaalia.

726
02:12:00,995 --> 02:12:12,099
l'd told you that the path you were
following ends at the scaffold!

727
02:12:13,041 --> 02:12:18,172
l've myself opted for that scaffold!

728
02:12:19,114 --> 02:12:21,674
The judge only wrote
my death sentence.

729
02:12:22,784 --> 02:12:28,086
But, even now, l worship as God
the person who sealed it!

730
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:35,518
l told the court
whatever you asked me to.

731
02:12:36,164 --> 02:12:40,863
Now please return my daughter to me!

732
02:12:42,937 --> 02:12:45,770
The death sentence has only
been passed now.

733
02:12:46,875 --> 02:12:53,439
Till Kaalia is hanged, l can't return
your daughter to you!

734
02:13:07,795 --> 02:13:11,663
What is this?
- Your Kallu's shroud!

735
02:13:14,602 --> 02:13:19,232
You're so different from
what he thought you to be!

736
02:13:20,008 --> 02:13:26,413
He brought you here,
but see where you've sent him!

737
02:13:27,282 --> 02:13:30,410
What did his enemies give you
that he didn't?

738
02:13:30,919 --> 02:13:36,353
How much did you sell his life
for? - Enough, Shalini!

739
02:13:36,641 --> 02:13:45,982
How deep is your lust for wealth,
that only Kallu's death can fill it?

740
02:13:46,918 --> 02:13:53,187
lf possible, put this shroud over me
and burn me alive!

741
02:13:53,925 --> 02:14:01,354
l deserve this punishment! ..
l have no way to go ..

742
02:14:02,234 --> 02:14:14,874
My Kallu is in prison, and my
daughter is with Sahani Seth! - What?

743
02:14:16,181 --> 02:14:19,912
My sister-in-law did the right thing.

744
02:14:21,286 --> 02:14:27,953
The story begun by Sahani Seth
doesn't end, but starts from here.

745
02:14:29,828 --> 02:14:36,961
He wrote the first word of this
story, but l'll write the last!

746
02:14:38,570 --> 02:14:42,301
The meeting time is over.

747
02:15:00,859 --> 02:15:05,796
Meetings can end, but not time!

748
02:15:50,742 --> 02:15:54,200
You've leaped really high today!

749
02:15:54,846 --> 02:15:59,215
Many prisoners have tried to escape
from my jail.

750
02:15:59,818 --> 02:16:05,279
But nobody could reach
as far as you did!

751
02:16:16,368 --> 02:16:18,996
Freedom is every prisoner's dream.

752
02:16:19,604 --> 02:16:28,945
But now, your entire being
will regret ever seeing it!

753
02:16:36,454 --> 02:16:46,420
Chain him so much that he'll never
think of escape again!

754
02:16:50,135 --> 02:16:53,935
Till now, you've seen the iron
of chains and bars ..

755
02:16:54,472 --> 02:16:59,034
.. but not the steel of my guts! ..
Shackle my entire body!

756
02:16:59,377 --> 02:17:05,179
Erect iron walls all around,
but l'll tear them apart!

757
02:17:05,717 --> 02:17:09,744
l'll break all the shackles
and show you! .. Understand?

758
02:17:25,003 --> 02:17:34,674
Chain him so much that he'll never
think of escape again!

759
02:26:33,518 --> 02:26:36,646
Kallu, run!

760
02:27:32,243 --> 02:27:46,249
Death arrived before you, Jailer ..
Kaalia is no more!

761
02:27:53,331 --> 02:27:57,427
l wanted to hand over Kaalia
to the law alive.

762
02:27:57,936 --> 02:28:01,303
By dying, he has really wronged me!

763
02:28:02,006 --> 02:28:06,466
But you have my full sympathy.

764
02:28:09,214 --> 02:28:12,012
And l sympathize with you, Jailer!

765
02:28:14,152 --> 02:28:19,715
The tables have turned now!

766
02:28:20,592 --> 02:28:25,620
lf you follow me even one step, l'll put
all the bullets inside you!

767
02:28:26,164 --> 02:28:31,727
l'll take all the bullets,
but won't budge from my place!

768
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:40,473
You're an escaped prisoner,
and it's my duty to arrest you!

769
02:28:40,878 --> 02:28:46,316
Like you, even l am bound by my duty!

770
02:28:50,255 --> 02:28:53,281
The tables have turned again, Kaalia!

771
02:28:54,259 --> 02:29:02,030
lf you advance even one step, l'll put
all the bullets inside you!

772
02:29:03,801 --> 02:29:09,706
How can one who swallows fire
get scared of sparks?

773
02:29:10,608 --> 02:29:15,238
Shoot! You came here following
a line of blood ..

774
02:29:15,947 --> 02:29:20,043
.. but l'll go, even if l have to swim
on a canal of blood!

775
02:29:20,718 --> 02:29:28,784
You're fighting for medals, but l
want to save a small life.

776
02:29:31,963 --> 02:29:36,161
Small life?
- Yes, his niece.

777
02:29:36,567 --> 02:29:40,230
To save her, his sister-in-law
falsely accused him of murder.

778
02:29:40,738 --> 02:29:43,138
And he accepted it.

779
02:29:43,708 --> 02:29:50,637
lf you don't believe even this,
do whatever you wish; l'm going!

780
02:29:54,719 --> 02:29:57,347
Stop!

781
02:29:58,656 --> 02:29:59,145
Like you, even l have drunk
the milk of a tigress!

782
02:30:04,762 --> 02:30:08,129
By mentioning about that small life ..

783
02:30:09,434 --> 02:30:15,737
.. you've made me decide
to take a risky decision.

784
02:30:16,474 --> 02:30:21,241
l'll accompany you
wherever you're going.

785
02:30:21,813 --> 02:30:28,377
Think that now you have four hands!

786
02:30:44,102 --> 02:30:52,339
Where's Sahani?
Speak, or l'll shoot you!

787
02:32:21,032 --> 02:32:26,698
Get up Sahani, and take me to Munni!

788
02:33:29,534 --> 02:33:32,560
You've done enough of your firing.

789
02:33:33,304 --> 02:33:37,468
You're now standing on
a chess-board of death!

790
02:33:40,912 --> 02:33:47,408
lf you have the guts, come forward
and make the first move!

791
02:33:52,623 --> 02:33:59,324
The game will start later,
first see your stake!

792
02:34:05,336 --> 02:34:08,567
Uncle!

793
02:34:11,042 --> 02:34:15,274
You did the right thing by coming back
to the white spot.

794
02:34:16,047 --> 02:34:21,041
Else, Munni would have got crushed
.. Now look there!

795
02:34:23,521 --> 02:34:27,321
Beware! .. Don't step forward!

796
02:34:27,992 --> 02:34:34,158
On this board, only that white spot
means life, the rest mean death!

797
02:34:35,433 --> 02:34:40,996
lf you step on that red spot,
Munni will die.

798
02:34:41,473 --> 02:34:47,036
lf you step on this green spot,
your sister-in-law will die.

799
02:34:47,812 --> 02:34:52,806
They'll stay alive only if you remain
inside that white spot.

800
02:34:54,519 --> 02:35:02,688
There's one more rule of this game:
only l will make all the moves!

801
02:35:03,495 --> 02:35:14,030
Now l'll show you the strength of
this hand, which you wanted to cut!

802
02:35:31,089 --> 02:35:39,224
lf you even try to raise your hands,
you'll be riddled with bullets!

803
02:35:42,267 --> 02:35:48,331
That was for stealing from my house,
so it was a bit gentle!

804
02:35:51,943 --> 02:35:58,178
That was for setting fire to my factory,
so it was a bit hard!

805
02:36:07,458 --> 02:36:12,020
That was for the priceless diamond ..

806
02:36:12,864 --> 02:36:18,268
.. which was your biggest victory,
and my biggest defeat!

807
02:36:30,915 --> 02:36:37,411
These blows were for that gold,
which reached the docks for me ..

808
02:36:38,189 --> 02:36:41,590
.. but landed up in your godowns!

809
02:36:47,198 --> 02:36:52,295
You're already staggering! l have
many more accounts to settle.

810
02:36:52,570 --> 02:36:55,801
lf you must settle your accounts
with my death, do so.

811
02:36:56,307 --> 02:37:00,676
But let these innocent people go.
- And climb the scaffold myself?

812
02:37:01,479 --> 02:37:05,108
l'm not that stupid.

813
02:37:06,084 --> 02:37:11,545
One's own life is always dearer
than that of others.

814
02:37:12,223 --> 02:37:17,752
Maybe for scoundrels like you! ..
lf l had thousands of lives ..

815
02:37:18,529 --> 02:37:21,123
.. l'd have sacrificed them for
my sister-in-law and Munni!

816
02:37:21,866 --> 02:37:28,635
l admire your love, that's why
l'm killing you so slowly!

817
02:38:10,214 --> 02:38:21,216
Well done! You've saved Munni,
now watch your sister-in-law die!

818
02:38:52,457 --> 02:38:56,154
Tell your men to drop their weapons!

819
02:39:08,339 --> 02:39:14,073
Now l'll arrest you and take you
to the place ..

820
02:39:14,679 --> 02:39:17,842
.. where you wanted this innocent man
to be hanged for your crime!

821
02:39:18,149 --> 02:39:21,175
Drop your revolver, Jailer!

822
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:27,724
Or she'll be killed!
- Well done, Khadag Singh!

823
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:32,127
You've given a new twist
to this story!

824
02:39:34,332 --> 02:39:37,495
Tie them up!

825
02:39:55,086 --> 02:39:59,614
Do you remember, Jailer:
twenty years back ..

826
02:40:00,324 --> 02:40:06,593
.. one of your prisoners had
abducted your daughter.

827
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:14,504
Look at me closely ..
l'm that prisoner!

828
02:40:16,307 --> 02:40:23,679
Jaswant? - Yes! Would you like to know
where your daughter is?

829
02:40:24,482 --> 02:40:30,011
Where's she?
- Right here!

830
02:40:36,527 --> 02:40:41,692
Father!
- Rani!

831
02:40:42,533 --> 02:40:49,200
My daughter!

832
02:40:51,309 --> 02:40:52,776
l'm so happy today!

833
02:40:55,179 --> 02:40:57,443
You scoundrel!

834
02:40:58,216 --> 02:41:01,049
Your meeting time is over!

835
02:41:02,453 --> 02:41:08,881
Twenty years back, a prisoner was
meeting his wife this way.

836
02:41:09,494 --> 02:41:14,693
Then you used your whip and said:
''Time's over'' !

837
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:29,608
Your whip was fiery; my back still
burns. Now it'll be cooled!

838
02:41:31,549 --> 02:41:42,323
l won't hit you,
but your delicate daughter!

839
02:41:50,601 --> 02:41:52,660
You devil!

840
02:41:54,338 --> 02:41:55,930
You bastard!

841
02:42:23,901 --> 02:42:30,067
You've made all your moves -
it's my turn now!

842
02:42:31,609 --> 02:42:41,280
You taught an inexperienced foot soldier
like me the game of crime!

843
02:42:42,987 --> 02:42:49,017
You made me a powerful minister,
who could hit like this!

844
02:43:00,638 --> 02:43:06,508
That was for the Rs. 500/-, which you gave
to a harlot, but not to me!

845
02:43:11,916 --> 02:43:18,617
That was for my brother's death,
who had taught me idealism!

846
02:43:22,293 --> 02:43:33,033
That was for turning an honest man like me
into a devil like you!

847
02:43:36,607 --> 02:43:42,773
l won't give you an easy death.

848
02:43:43,681 --> 02:43:47,947
l'll definitely kill you, but very slowly!

849
02:43:54,458 --> 02:43:56,722
Get up!

850
02:44:06,337 --> 02:44:13,140
l'm arresting you and taking you
to your rightful dwelling!

851
02:44:14,145 --> 02:44:22,712
Pray that you don't land-up
in my jail!

852
02:44:24,923 --> 02:44:31,123
Mr. l.G.P., you'll escort me outside!

853
02:44:32,797 --> 02:44:34,526
Come on!

854
02:44:51,249 --> 02:44:54,810
Now l'm handing my prisoner
over to you.

855
02:44:55,286 --> 02:45:00,952
Watch him carefully,
he has a habit of escaping!

856
02:45:03,561 --> 02:45:07,088
l want to ask you something:

857
02:45:07,865 --> 02:45:10,231
Have you heard of Mukhtar Singh?
- No!

858
02:45:10,501 --> 02:45:16,064
Then what have you heard?
The name of Mukhtar Singh ..
