1
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,240
Kumar, why did chief ask us to
clean it up during the night?

2
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,820
Did you expect to clean all this
dirt in the broad daylight?

3
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,696
As if this place is crowded during day. Who
would come into these parts of the woods?

4
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,956
Do one thing, I'll call him
up just convey it to him.

5
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,220
Come on now!

6
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,210
- Shut up.
- Well, then you shut up!

7
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,910
Kumar! Kumar!

8
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,970
- What was that noise upstairs?
- I thought it came from downstairs.

9
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:57,360
RUM

10
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,670
In Vellore district, retired
police officer Mr. Rangarajan,

11
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,190
who was considered missing
since few days ago...

12
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,286
was found dead at
the Elagiri forest.

13
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,986
Series of murders and this
murder of a retired officer

14
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,460
has raised serious concerns
in and around Vellore.

15
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,440
Move! Do not crowd here. Move!

16
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,760
Bullets shots were found
in Rangarajan's body.

17
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,480
His son's throat has been slit.

18
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,510
There is no news on
his daughter Tulasi.

19
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,520
Investigation will proceed based
on the evidences found so far.

20
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,550
During war season many lives
are lost in the battle field.

21
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,649
In order to ensure that
the spirits of these dead

22
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,496
soldiers don't create
any further troubles...

23
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,530
lemons and gypsum are buried in specific
spots all around the battlefield.

24
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,140
Join these spots
and they form a...

25
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,560
pyramid structure.

26
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,226
Apparently, the pyramid and
the gypsum used to build

27
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,140
it has the capacity to
preserve energy in them.

28
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,660
Any questions?

29
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,436
You. Tell me.

30
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,240
So you say that the spirits can
be controlled by certain methods.

31
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,440
Have you ever tried that?

32
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,910
I have.

33
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,300
When we try changing the fate it
results in new set of reactions.

34
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,030
It's a huge chain reaction.

35
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,720
And it's outcome can
be very dangerous.

36
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,930
Hence these gypsum distract
the spirits from their focus.

37
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,756
Are those gypsum stones
indeed so powerful?

38
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,230
Of course.

39
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,230
The stones in our
good luck ring,

40
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,450
the varieties of stones
in a king's crown,

41
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,830
in fact...

42
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,770
all the idols of the gods that we
worship are made out of stones.

43
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,030
Because...

44
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,100
these gypsum stones have the capacity
to store in positive energy.

45
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,900
Do such gypsum still exist?

46
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,090
It does.

47
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,440
But not here in India.

48
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,100
In countries like Egypt, Vietnam,
Cambodia and Thailand...

49
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,650
gypsum stones are used
to build temples.

50
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,970
Even lemon has the power
to control spirits.

51
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,030
Lemon, mentioned stones etc...

52
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,270
are used to control the spirits.

53
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,500
Mr. Raj...

54
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,540
get Kural's attention.

55
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,220
Thomas has informed me
about the next project.

56
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,460
Get done with this and
we'll be settled for good.

57
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,700
This project is huge.

58
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,966
Hence it's very risky.

59
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,020
How much worth is it?

60
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,080
250 million.

61
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,110
Come again.

62
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,750
250 million.

63
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,746
Long back in the 7th
century, a Tamil king had

64
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,906
built the biggest temple
in south east asia.

65
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,420
In a recent archeological
excavation that took place there...

66
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,423
they recovered the king's
treasure, containing

67
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:58,430
lots of precious
jewels and stones.

68
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,080
A richie rich from here has
bought them in an auction

69
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,940
and he plans to hand it
over to the government.

70
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:06,924
The government has decided to put up the
stones at Salar Jung museum in Hyderabad.

71
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,030
But since the king is from Tamil
Nadu, few people from here...

72
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,716
are protesting to put up them
in a museum in Tamil Nadu.

73
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,860
So coming 15th...

74
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,320
they are moving it out in a flight but
that's just to divert those people.

75
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,660
Instead it's taken to Hyderabad
in a secured container.

76
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,950
The container will take the Gumudipundi.
- Tada route to reach Hyderabad.

77
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,590
So before the container crosses the Tada
stretch we must have robbed the stones.

78
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,293
Permissions have
been issued to build

79
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:36,290
industries for the sake
of earning commission.

80
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,660
And those industries have
polluted my country real bad!

81
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,550
What in the hucking fell, non sense
topic are you talking about?

82
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,086
Turning non sense to
common sense is what I do!

83
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,760
So are you going to
revolt against them?

84
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
No!

85
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,490
We are going to rob them!

86
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,320
What are you blabbering?

87
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,150
Past Gumudipundi it's
full of industrial area.

88
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,388
The dust and smoke emitted
from those industries

89
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,260
blurs the vision and
makes it tough to drive.

90
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:59,824
Over that, winter is here.

91
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,810
So...

92
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,180
the smog will make it difficult to
even view the vehicle going ahead.

93
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Smog?

94
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,910
Foggy smoke.

95
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,830
Smoke plus fog is equal to

96
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
smog.

97
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,976
It's quite misty out there.
Isn't it?

98
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes.

99
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,950
Mr. Raj...

100
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,360
be ready. The vehicle
is about to reach.

101
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,136
Nepali...

102
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,540
be alert. We are almost there.

103
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm ready Shiva.

104
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
Mr. Raj.

105
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,690
Nepali.

106
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,430
- Sir the signal is interrupted.
- Looks like it is blocked.

107
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,550
There is no signal.

108
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,866
Check post officer,
is everything ok?

109
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,020
The signal is lost.

110
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,540
We too aren't receiving
any signal here.

111
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,880
Over that, the mist is
giving us a tough time.

112
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,720
Any problem there?

113
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,510
Driver do you copy?

114
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,730
There will be security
guards inside the container.

115
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,120
We gotta handle them.

116
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
Bro...

117
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,930
how about smothering them with
a chloroform scented kerchief?

118
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,760
- Is this your kerchief?
- Yes.

119
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,060
Forget the chloroform. Just use the
kerchief alone and that ought to do it.

120
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,260
Get over with old methods!

121
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,440
Let me tell you the
latest method.

122
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,860
Bro, what are you up to?
Stop playing with colors.

123
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,050
Now how's that?

124
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,460
This is my formula.

125
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,640
All you need is a drop of it.

126
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,020
And you'll be out!

127
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,860
We must find the GPS tracker in the
container and remove it first.

128
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:54,196
Kural...

129
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,390
that's your job.

130
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,116
Once the security car
crosses the check post...

131
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,410
they'll comeback in
search of container.

132
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,300
We'll have to take
care of them too.

133
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,126
There is a type of alkali.

134
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,776
The second it's comes in contact
with water it'll blast.

135
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,806
How did you become such
an expert in chemistry?

136
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,630
My chemistry teacher was really hot
and I was desperate to impress her.

137
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,760
The CCTV footage within
the container is lost.

138
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,310
Even the GPS isn't detecting.
Any problem?

139
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,930
No idea sir. We
shall go and check.

140
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,406
Moreover it's quite misty and
hence the vision is too blurred.

141
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,920
Ok. Go check immediately.
Stay connected.

142
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,400
The tyre is on fire!

143
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,160
Get down! Now!

144
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,926
Driver, do you copy?

145
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,620
Security car driver,
do you copy?

146
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,746
The GPS is back on track.

147
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,336
Container is approaching
towards you.

148
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Sir, there was minor yet
a sudden tyre explosion.

149
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,500
Something is fishy.
We need back up!

150
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,276
Ok.

151
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,710
I'll inform the control room.

152
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,520
The container is fast
approaching towards us.

153
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,970
Sir, looks like a bomb!

154
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,580
Hold on.

155
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,316
Grab all that sticks to your hand;
everything here is for you to rob.

156
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,510
You came in to this world empty handed;
so own all that you can before you leave.

157
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,806
All that you own now in what
the world has lost to you.

158
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,840
So, grab all that sticks to your hand;
everything here is for you to rob.

159
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,060
The games have just begun;
hell will be raised...!

160
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,456
Hell will be raised...
before it's done!

161
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,146
Hunger of a different
kind; it keeps

162
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:08,836
playing...! it keeps
playing with your mind!

163
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,756
The games have just begun;
hell will be raised...!

164
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,136
Hell will be raised...
before it's done!

165
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,938
Hunger of a different
kind; it keeps

166
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,740
playing...! it keeps
playing with your mind!

167
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,860
Call me king of the city; sing with
me and let's introduce some anarchy.

168
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,140
Building castles in the air
and swimming with despair.

169
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,910
A mind full of
catastrophic ideas!

170
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,740
I ain't your momma!
So have some mercy!

171
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,636
The king of the rap is here; so behold!
Others stay clear!

172
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,910
No pain no gain; Now
that sounds like a man!

173
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,660
Get high on money,
not high with money!

174
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,276
Get high on money because that's
what this is all about, honey!

175
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,940
Silk rhymes flow sharp
just like the shark tooth!

176
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,650
So kneel because I'm for real!

177
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,646
If you are for real I'm with you; else
you'll be a goner if it's not true!

178
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,410
So get into the groove!

179
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,020
Hello Shiva.

180
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,370
I know who you are.

181
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,410
I know what you all do.

182
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,020
I know everything
about you guys.

183
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,250
Sorry.

184
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,520
Wrong table.

185
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,126
I went a bit over board
with the liquor.

186
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,150
See you.

187
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,590
Who is he?

188
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,800
A police? Media guy?
Could be a meme creator?

189
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,420
Oh! Oh! That's me
in that footage!

190
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,720
We could have been caught.

191
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,210
We can tried for many charges.

192
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,990
We could be in prison.

193
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,660
It's better we agree
to his "60-40" deal.

194
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,050
Giving him a share
isn't a big deal.

195
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,796
He will use us...

196
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,846
and when time comes...

197
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,000
he'll show his true color!

198
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,700
That is what concerns me.

199
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,850
What do we do now?

200
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,590
You have any better option?

201
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
That is how the
underworld works.

202
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,490
Here, you gotta do
business with traitors.

203
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,060
But we must save ourselves
from any kind of betrayal.

204
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,434
All I hear is, get sloshed
and don't get wasted!

205
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,840
For the past few days,
many areas in Chennai...

206
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,116
has witnessed robberies, where millions
of worth money and jewels are stolen.

207
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,470
The polices doubts that this could be
the work of thieves from the north.

208
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,210
I'm off to meet Thomas.

209
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Super!

210
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,970
Here, your share.

211
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,860
Once you are done with the
robbery, the plan is ready.

212
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,500
I want all of you to come
to Sriperambudur. Ok?

213
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,250
Don't forget. Sriperambudur.

214
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,520
Don't forget. I
want all you there.

215
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,640
Riya, stop the car.

216
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,696
I told you don't gulp
down that much beer!

217
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,850
This is beginning of one
of those halts to pee!

218
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,400
What happened Shiva?

219
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,710
- What's the matter?
- Give me your mobile.

220
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,330
- Your mobile too.
- Why are you switching it off?

221
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,270
We are not meeting Thomas.

222
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,440
What do you mean? Why?

223
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Stop yelling!

224
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,129
Who among us was dealing all
this while with Thomas?

225
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,130
You were.

226
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,920
Then why does he want
all of us to be there?

227
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,056
Stop acting like a fool. He'll
finish us if we don't go.

228
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,620
- Go there and still he'll finish us off.
- He has the footage of our robbery!

229
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,960
Thomas won't harm us until he
gets his hands on the stones.

230
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:09,626
But that doesn't mean
he won't pursue us.

231
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,106
By now, he would have started
sniffing to trace us down.

232
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,390
Stop it with your Batman
vs Superman fan war.

233
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,646
We are in the middle of
the road not on Facebook!

234
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,370
Now calm down and compromise.

235
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,060
What's your plan?

236
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,880
I don't know.

237
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,130
I can see that from your looks.

238
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,310
We need a hide out
for couple of days.

239
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,210
A hide out? Where
do look for that?

240
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,200
How about booking a hotel room?

241
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:35,024
What's with her craze
for hotel rooms?

242
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,170
Hotel room won't work out.

243
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,780
That is why she is
proposing that idea.

244
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,100
It should be an isolated place
where no one can find us.

245
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,176
Isolated and where
no one can find us?

246
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Then I guess we must head
deep into the woods!

247
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,026
Wait, what did you just say?

248
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,690
I said the woods, she said the city.
Are you proposing underground?

249
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:50,714
No.

250
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,638
Shiva, there is a forest
area named 'Moonlight

251
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,370
park' by my native.
What do you say?

252
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,876
Tell me your native first.

253
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,946
Elagiri. I know a
house owned by a NRI.

254
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,919
It has been empty for two years now.
It's an apt choice.

255
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,316
I hope there won't
be any problem.

256
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,460
It's very safe.

257
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
What do you say?

258
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,830
Don't forget. I want all
of you to be there.

259
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,390
Let's go.

260
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,370
This is getting interesting!

261
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,110
What next?

262
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,580
Shiva...

263
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,370
check in to that gas
station on the left.

264
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,720
Let's buy all that we need.
There are no shops further.

265
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:24,984
Riya, fill up the gas tank.

266
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,500
- What about our tanks?
- I've already bought them.

267
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,600
Looks like he understood!

268
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,580
Flash news:

269
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,278
Popular businessman, Vijay
was all set to handover the

270
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,900
historical stones and
diamonds to the government.

271
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,908
However on it's way to
Hyderabad, the stones

272
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,740
have been robbed by
a mysterious gang.

273
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,810
The police are on the
hunt to nab the culprits.

274
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,140
How about this?

275
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,490
Shall I?

276
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,840
36-28-36.

277
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,510
She looks like a hotty
from this angle.

278
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,100
It's time to get
down and woo her.

279
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,820
She's got beautiful long hair.

280
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,150
My god.

281
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,136
Excuse me.

282
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,670
- Can I help you?
- Why not?

283
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,870
I am looking for the "The dark knight
" DVD. Can you help me with that?

284
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,510
Careful, the Joker might just put a smile
across that toothless face of yours.

285
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,790
Sorry I have something
else to take care of.

286
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,110
Here, add these too in the bill.

287
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Why do you look upset Mr. Raj?

288
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,970
It's not how I look always but
it's what I do that upsets me!

289
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,530
Well that was a great escape.

290
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,100
Come on stop quoting the
Batman and tell us.

291
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,636
It's not what I quote but it's what I do
that keeps you guessing. Sounds good?

292
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,260
Stop it!

293
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,280
I've heard of 'Tooth fairy' but
that was more of 'Toothless scary.'

294
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,350
Nepali...

295
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,876
Can't you hear him calling you?

296
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,710
- Yes Shiva?
- How do we go from here?

297
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,990
Take a right.

298
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,440
Drive carefully, the
road ahead is pathetic.

299
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,440
I don't feel any different.

300
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,150
What is he observing?

301
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,450
Stop it with your spooky looks!
Get lost!

302
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,460
Mr. Raj...

303
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,990
how does the house look?

304
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,049
So this is the forest area
named 'Moonlight park?'

305
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,358
Nope, this the 'Moonlight
Forest' in the park.

306
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,690
Was that a joke?

307
00:28:09,714 --> 00:28:12,204
Let me see if I can crack that
joke in few years from now.

308
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,600
Listen, don't stand
here for long.

309
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,041
This is a forest, snake might
sneak through your trousers.

310
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:30,205
Don't play that snake joke on me!
You can't scare me with snakes.

311
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,550
Hit it hard.

312
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Nepali!

313
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,970
What is it buddy?

314
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,530
Don't forget the car keys.

315
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,320
Ok.

316
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
What happened?

317
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,400
I smell it!

318
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,770
I can smell it here.

319
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,970
What is that you smell?

320
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,340
This place smells of liquor.
I'm sure there is liquor here.

321
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
How do you say?

322
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,220
Look at that. The sticker that
comes along the liquor bottles.

323
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,950
The government seal sticker!

324
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,510
You are a 'liquor shot' genius.

325
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,230
Looks like the lights
don't work here.

326
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,330
Let's try finding
another switch.

327
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Shiva there is no power
connection here.

328
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,770
There is a generator here.

329
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,740
It's in the basement.

330
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,380
What is it?

331
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,120
Do you see that?

332
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
You mean the chair?

333
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,020
Don't you see anything else?

334
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,126
Yes, I don't see anything else.

335
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,150
Look again. Are you sure?

336
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,640
Yes. I see only the chair.

337
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
What do you see?

338
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,560
I too see the same. I'm
just getting it confirmed.

339
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
- You son of...
- Woah! Woah, hold it right there.

340
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,530
- Don't make me curse you.
- Ok dear.

341
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,020
I see only the chair.

342
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,460
We need diesel.

343
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,810
There is some diesel
in the car trunk.

344
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
Wait.

345
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,600
- I'll get it.
- Make it fast.

346
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,420
Oops! The torch light?

347
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,980
Scared the hell out
of you, did I?

348
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,636
Your face looks like the one
on the horror movie poster.

349
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,570
When the doll started playing, my
heart almost came into my mouth.

350
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,050
Stop it!

351
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,926
How can the doll
play on it's own?

352
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,500
Why are you here?

353
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,870
I'm going out to fetch
diesel from the car trunk.

354
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,896
Fine. Go. Don't be scared.
Ok dear?

355
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,120
Don't forget the liquor,
that is too in the trunk.

356
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:41,366
- Ok.
- Wait.

357
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,120
Looks like you got scared real bad.
Give me the keys. I'll go get it.

358
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,136
It's ok. I'll get it.

359
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
You chickened out the moment
you saw a doll and you

360
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:50,290
say you'll go all by yourself?
Now give it to me.

361
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,090
Walks like boy and gets scared
like a sissy; the name is Nepali.

362
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,060
Youth these days
are such a wuss.

363
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,460
No one can beat me, Mr. Raj!

364
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,236
The name is Raj, the
one and only Raj!

365
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm not afraid,
to take a step...

366
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,270
Everybody, I'm not afraid...

367
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,900
I'm slightly afraid,
I'm slightly afraid.

368
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,940
Why did you send that doofus?
You done it yourself.

369
00:33:27,026 --> 00:33:28,466
Did I just hear you
call me 'doofus?'

370
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,620
- Don't take me so light.
- Remove the cork now!

371
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,276
What's with the
abusive language?

372
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,230
- I said remove the cork.
- Oh is it? I heard something else.

373
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,720
Why isn't it working?

374
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,380
We can't stay in the dark!

375
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,220
Wait. We'll find a
way to make it work.

376
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,070
- Try once again.
- Try!

377
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,690
We could have halted
somewhere else.

378
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:14,680
How about Thomas' house?

379
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,510
Shiva! Shiva!

380
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,980
Come with me.

381
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,630
Check this out.

382
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,660
Why? Why? Why would you do that?

383
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,106
I was helping you get out.

384
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,770
He pulls me down and you pull me up.
Are you guys ripping me apart?

385
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,450
- Well, I didn't know that.
- Take a hike!

386
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,230
Now you come on!

387
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,900
What a doofus!

388
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,950
I said move!

389
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,970
Never did that yogasana before.
Phew!

390
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,390
This house is so confusing!

391
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Checking out the
chick in the poster?

392
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,740
I guess the guy who owned this
house must be an art lover.

393
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,090
So...

394
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,430
you mean she is Hart?

395
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,630
I said 'Art' lover not
porn star 'Hart' lover!

396
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,780
Pathetic!

397
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,250
Stop it! Stop acting naughty!

398
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,340
No, you were right. She does resemble the
porn star Hart. I was looking for the name.

399
00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:44,926
Did you find it?

400
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,240
Nope, even the artist's
name isn't seen.

401
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,830
So tell me, what's
bothering you?

402
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,520
Well nothing.

403
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,070
What happened Riya?

404
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,556
How long are we going to live
with fear of getting caught?

405
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,660
What's the problem?

406
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,290
Once this is settled, we'll
go back to our normal life.

407
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,470
We won't have to live
in fear anymore.

408
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,760
Trust me.

409
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,870
Hey angel, stop blowing
me away with your love!

410
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,756
Hey beauty, stop killing me
with those looks of yours.

411
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,250
Oh! The mesmerizing romance!

412
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,900
Hey birdie stop pushing
me further down in love.

413
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,290
When I hold you close to me;
I realize that this is life.

414
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,840
With you around me, the tears of
sorrow will never see the light.

415
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,580
Until you are here
death has gotta wait.

416
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,940
You are my everything;
you are my soul mate.

417
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,450
Your grace can give moon a
run for it's brightness.

418
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,130
Your touch is magical.

419
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,580
Even when you are silent, your voice
plays like a melody in my mind.

420
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,016
I'm lost in your love.

421
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,040
Your smile brings new
colors in my life.

422
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,356
I wish I had more than a single
heart to shower more love you.

423
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,406
All my bubble like merry
memories are filled up with you.

424
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,210
Let's get lost in love land and
create a world of our own.

425
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,870
A world of our own.

426
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,480
Shower more love you.

427
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,050
You are mine.

428
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,240
Oh it was you! Mr. Raj?

429
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,460
I did say " I'll be back."

430
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,590
In 'Judgment day' I did
say 'I'll be back."

431
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,730
Tell him the terminator is back!

432
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,830
Ok say something now!

433
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:19,456
Now stop it guys!
What do you want?

434
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,410
We forgot the munchies
and the smoke packet.

435
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,540
Take it and get lost!

436
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,870
- Hastla Vista baby.
- Shut up!

437
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,900
Shiva we've got
whatever we need.

438
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,580
- Do you need anything snacks?
- Snacks?

439
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:33,324
Standing right next to him is his
main course. Just leave them alone.

440
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:34,348
Ok now leave.

441
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,490
Phew!

442
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,470
What is Kural up to?

443
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,516
Why does he look so frightened?

444
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,150
Now stop asking
questions and get him.

445
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,190
What are you doing here?

446
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,170
Listen, refrain yourself
from going there.

447
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Got it?

448
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Now come on.

449
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,710
Keep moving. Can't you hear me?

450
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,310
Welcome to my house...

451
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,070
let me take the mic
and abuse now!

452
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,126
What's with the all the lyrics?

453
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,400
This ain't the bible to
recite the verses as it is.

454
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,526
We got the full rights to modify the lyrics
and sing songs according to our mood.

455
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,600
According to our mood?

456
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,380
Talking about which, what
if Thomas come here?

457
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,410
How will it affect your mood?

458
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,200
You think Thomas intimidates me?
Call him! Where is he?

459
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,150
Tell me! Where is he?

460
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,166
No matter where he is.

461
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,066
I don't give a damn
if Thomas comes here.

462
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,090
Do you think he is hiding
here in the cupboard?

463
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,350
What is it?

464
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,830
Is Thomas indeed here?

465
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,160
Thomas who?

466
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,870
Nope.

467
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,940
It's the one and only our
favorite and famous...

468
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,400
Come to me my darling.

469
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,380
Now this is the
real crowd puller.

470
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,250
Wow!

471
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,440
I was worried that we were
going to fall short of liquor.

472
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,080
Now this is a bonus!

473
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:13,886
Nepali...

474
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,690
do you know who holds the record
for winning the slurping contest?

475
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,740
There you go.

476
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,170
It's so cold in here. I should have
not worn this baywatch attire.

477
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,330
The basic and most important needs
of a human is liquor and sweater.

478
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,260
Let me go get the sweater. I can't
take this cold, I gotta pee.

479
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,400
The great Avvaiyar was
right when she said...

480
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:50,160
"No matter where you roam, in the end
you'll find peace only in the restroom."

481
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,740
What was that noise?

482
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,770
What was that noise?

483
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,120
Nepali!

484
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,450
Wake up Nepali.

485
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,010
What happened?

486
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,440
What happened Kural?

487
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,010
Tell us what happened?

488
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,340
Tell us.

489
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,350
Oh! Oh! Hope he does tell on me,
that I let him drink. - What?

490
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,556
He says something pushed him.

491
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,086
Thank god, I'm happy
that he can't speak.

492
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,110
You okay?

493
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,426
Come let's go.

494
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,830
Let's take him. Come on.

495
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,370
Careful. Thank god.

496
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,210
Didn't I tell you to
refrain from coming here?

497
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,890
- You shouldn't have drunk and stepped out.
- He drank?

498
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,986
Mr. Raj, how many times have I
warned you from giving him booze?

499
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,483
I never got him drunk.
He drinks like a fish

500
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:24,980
and this dumb head
doesn't know about it!

501
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,656
What did you say?

502
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,176
I said he might have hurt his head.
Check him.

503
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,800
Can't you leave us in
peace for few mins?

504
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,574
Will that be all your honor?

505
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,776
Don't you guys wanna sleep?

506
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,330
Sleep? When there is
liquor who needs sleep?

507
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,340
- I got an idea.
- What?

508
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,290
How about bonfire?

509
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,240
- No nee..
- Now that's an awesome idea. Yes!

510
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:52,710
Yes?

511
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,890
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

512
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,480
You go get the liquor and
I shall set the bonfire.

513
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,550
To hell with you excitement!

514
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,080
Why is he delaying?

515
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,630
Let me go check.

516
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:08,950
Are you ok?

517
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,640
Waiting for food and booze
is the worst pain ever!

518
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
Thank god.

519
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,970
No one saw that. That
would've been embarrassing.

520
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:45,990
Hey Nepali.

521
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,130
What are you up to?

522
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,070
Didn't I ask you
to get the booze?

523
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,930
Your looks tell me
something is fishy.

524
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,750
Nepali?

525
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,230
I told you to get the booze.
Isn't it?

526
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,850
It is right here. What were
you doing in that room?

527
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,740
Stop removing your pants.

528
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,140
I went there to get
the cigarettes.

529
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Smoke?

530
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:12,760
You know well about me that I smoke
a cig with a peg every time.

531
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,720
Of late you have been
smoking too much.

532
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,050
What to do?

533
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,420
The company that
sells cigarette...

534
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,590
is the same company that sells
anti smoking chewing gum.

535
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,850
If we quit smoking...

536
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,120
then the poor business man
will run of business.

537
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:28,510
Think about it.

538
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,590
Bite me!

539
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,050
Come on now, smile.

540
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,090
I said smile!

541
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,460
Riya...

542
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,396
why does he look like
he is possessed?

543
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,420
So...

544
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,550
do ghost really exist?

545
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,150
It's not about if ghost
do exist for real...

546
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,070
it all about what they
can do defines them!

547
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,590
I'm Batman!

548
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,310
Come on Mr. Raj...

549
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,140
tell us, do ghost really exist?

550
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:05,376
Those frustrated with
life and bids good bye.

551
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,420
Will never want to return as ghost to
this dangerous land below the sky!

552
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:15,900
When caught between death and devil, we
are never gonna back down; we are rebel.

553
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:21,136
The mortals act as if they are petrified
but will take the ghost for a ride.

554
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,626
We call it ghost-phobilia;
Are you game for real?

555
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,146
Don't you chicken out in fear?
It's all unreal.

556
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,896
Truth is that we are the
jokers; we are the stooges,

557
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,520
we are the prankster; so stop
beating around the bush!

558
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,766
Fear is an evil devil.

559
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,120
Conquer it and you'll
be a daredevil.

560
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:09,766
The whisper that you hear in the
dark, it ain't the demon...

561
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,520
it's Mr. Bruce Wayne,
our very own Batman!

562
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,340
The one who fears the ghost never
lives life to the fullest!

563
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,560
So stop being a chicken and don't
live every second in fear!

564
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,326
Everything in your
life will be smooth...

565
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,910
until you yourself
invite the spook!

566
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,890
If you can't escape your uncertainties;
stop blaming it on the ghosts!

567
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,776
We call it ghost-phobilia;
Are you game for real?

568
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,906
Don't you chicken out in fear?
It's all unreal.

569
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:40,880
Truth is that we are the
jokers; we are the stooges,

570
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,546
we are the prankster; so stop
beating around the bush!

571
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:48,090
Those frustrated with
life and bids good bye.

572
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,470
Will never want to return as ghost to
this dangerous land below the sky!

573
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:58,710
When caught between death and devil, we
are never gonna back down; we are rebel.

574
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:04,000
The mortals act as if they are petrified
but will take the ghost for a ride.

575
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,746
We call it ghost-phobilia;
Are you game for real?

576
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:19,000
Don't you chicken out in fear?
It's all unreal.

577
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:21,866
Truth is that we are the
jokers; we are the stooges,

578
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,630
we are the prankster; so stop
beating around the bush!

579
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,500
I'm sloshed!

580
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:45,980
So it's time for me to sleep...

581
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,876
so you too go to sleep.

582
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,990
Good night.

583
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,590
Good morning Kate Winslet!

584
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,350
No movie ever ran
successfully like 'Titanic.'

585
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,860
In fact these days you find movies on
torrents on the very day of it's release!

586
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,980
I did put out the fire...

587
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,750
did it light up again?

588
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,990
Why are you talking to yourself?

589
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,150
No, when I was coming in...

590
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,320
Fire! Fire! Watch out!

591
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,920
Now what was that?

592
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,950
I was just puling your leg.

593
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,000
Why did you push me?

594
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,850
I just saw it catching fire.

595
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,590
I was trying to save you.

596
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,770
Stop it with your pranks!

597
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,950
Look you spilled all the liquor.

598
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,520
Damn it!

599
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,246
Forget it. Come let's crash.

600
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:13,020
- I saw fire!
- Something's wrong with you.

601
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,450
Move!

602
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,140
Listen...

603
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,020
stop wandering around in here.

604
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,550
Go to bed now.

605
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:31,990
Got it?

606
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,910
I guess he understood.

607
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,930
Mr. Raj what about you?

608
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,470
Where did I forget my watch?

609
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,240
Nepali...

610
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,460
what's the time?

611
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,200
When did we arrive here?

612
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,196
We reached here around 2 -
3 in the early morning.

613
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,430
Did we arrive that late?

614
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,950
We finished of two
bottles of booze...

615
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,130
and it would have been almost
5 hours since we are here.

616
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:17,390
Just look out. It's still dark.

617
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,870
Now stop torturing
and go to sleep!

618
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,670
Check your...

619
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,470
Check your mobile and
tell me what's the time.

620
01:00:28,026 --> 01:00:30,546
Oh yeah! Shiva had took all our
cell phones and switched it off.

621
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,040
But he uses his cell phone.
Now that's unfair.

622
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,920
What about us?

623
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,100
Can't we even carry our mobiles
with us and put in flight mode?

624
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,270
Do you think he trusts us?

625
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,756
You don't even pay
heed when I say it.

626
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,716
Forget it.

627
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,620
Yes, he is being a
bit mean and rude.

628
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:50,016
Who does he think he is?

629
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,220
Iron man with
different iron suits?

630
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,650
I better sleep now.

631
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,670
This guy is a question bank!

632
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,360
Woah! What's with that look?

633
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,640
Can you guys please
stop torturing me?

634
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,660
That fellow tortures me with questions
and this fellow with looks!

635
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,740
If I knock the door, he'll start
howling at me like a mating wolf!

636
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,570
I better go and get my
mobile from the car.

637
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,370
Why is it lying here?

638
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,810
None of the cell phones
are switching on.

639
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,180
How dare you play
Judas with me Nepali?

640
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,070
I hope you forgot that you
are messing with Thomas!

641
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,740
Do you wanna join your
friend Sharath in hell?

642
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,126
No, I was trying to find a
moment to call you but...

643
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,506
Well then you must have! What
in the hell were you up to?

644
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,070
Fool!

645
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,150
I'll kill you all and no
one will ever trace it.

646
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,090
Shiva might not know
me well but you do!

647
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:33,930
Thomas...

648
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,240
it's a mess here.

649
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,660
All of a sudden Shiva became
alert and changed the plans.

650
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:39,376
What do you mean?

651
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,710
When you wanted to meet all
of us at Sriperambudur,

652
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,040
he joined all the dots
and he made a guess.

653
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,989
Did he make the guess or...

654
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,180
did you help him guess?

655
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:51,290
Don't think you can get away
by joining hands with him.

656
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,306
Thomas.

657
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:53,330
Try to understand.

658
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
What was that?

659
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,270
Come again Nepali.

660
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:56,820
Thomas...

661
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,930
please try to understand me.

662
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,370
It was a last minute plan by Shiva
to escape with the diamonds.

663
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,630
I was clueless and hence I
diverted them to our place.

664
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,560
Which place?

665
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,070
To the 'Moonlight park.'

666
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,220
Why in the hell
did you go there?

667
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,290
Hello?

668
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,780
Thomas?

669
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:22,730
Thomas?

670
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:35,950
This doesn't seem to work.

671
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,970
Let me go out for a drive.

672
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:01,290
Who's that?

673
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:45,570
Shiva!

674
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:54,970
Shiva!

675
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,310
Shiva! Shiva!

676
01:06:58,446 --> 01:06:59,446
Look...

677
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,870
someone's shaking the bed
from beneath the cot.

678
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,040
I'm scared.

679
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:34,350
Shiva, someone's
shaking the bed above.

680
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:35,970
I'm scared!

681
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,590
I'm scared Shiva!

682
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:05,010
Riya...

683
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,230
- Come let's go.
- Shiva...

684
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:35,830
Shiva!

685
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:37,510
Look Nepali.

686
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,720
What happened?

687
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:40,130
Nepali?

688
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,060
Shiva something's wrong here.

689
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,410
Tell us, what happened?

690
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:47,030
Let's leave this place at once.

691
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,666
Hold him Shiva.

692
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:57,690
Careful.

693
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,620
What happened to you?

694
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,740
No.

695
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,240
Please no.

696
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,540
No. Please no. Don't hurt me.

697
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:54,929
It's day outside this compound.

698
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,910
It's dark only in here.

699
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:58,020
What do you mean?

700
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,550
When I stepped out of the gate,
the sun was shining everywhere.

701
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,780
- We are in deep trouble!
- Shiva?

702
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,070
- Where are you?
- Why can't you answer?

703
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,106
Answer me Shiva.

704
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:08,970
What was that noise?

705
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,520
- Who's that?
- Shiva where are you?

706
01:13:10,544 --> 01:13:12,230
- Who's that?
- Where are you guys?

707
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,840
- Who's that?
- I guess we are doomed!

708
01:13:13,864 --> 01:13:15,864
- We are doomed for good!
- Shiva? Is that you?

709
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,250
Shiva!

710
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:22,150
Shiva?

711
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:23,410
Shiva here.

712
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:29,336
Mr. Raj, throw me that
night vision goggles.

713
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,966
Night vision what?
Now where is that?

714
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,990
- The one around your neck.
- Oh yeah right.

715
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,560
Yes. Here.

716
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,330
Riya it's me. Don't be scared.

717
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,030
Shiva I doubt if
it's really you!

718
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:54,350
I am unable to light
up the match stick.

719
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,270
- This place is scaring the hell out of me.
- Use the lighter.

720
01:13:57,294 --> 01:13:58,724
I'm unable to light that up too.

721
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:02,220
- Some one switch on the lights!
- Use the flash light in your phone.

722
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,970
It's not working.

723
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,840
Lights please, for heaven sake!

724
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:15,480
Shiva...

725
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,170
Shiva! Come here my dear.

726
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:19,450
What did you say?

727
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,226
- It's day outside?
- Yes.

728
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,560
Just step outside the gate
and see it for yourself.

729
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:30,870
I told you. There is something
fishy about this place.

730
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,710
Now look what has happened?

731
01:14:36,546 --> 01:14:37,546
Please Shiva.

732
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:40,840
Let's not stay here anymore.
Let's leave at once.

733
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,140
Yes, let's leave
this place at once.

734
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,380
Where is Kural?

735
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,300
Kural?

736
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,700
What are you wondering?
Where is Kural?

737
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,540
Kural is in that room.

738
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:55,830
Yes, he is in there.

739
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,760
He asked me if ghost
really existed...

740
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,400
and the ghost shoved his
leg down his throat.

741
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,146
And I went a bit over board with my
answer about ghosts and mocked it.

742
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:41,816
I wonder what's going to get
shoved on which part of mine.

743
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,280
- Lord of the dark please save me.
- What happened Shiva?

744
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:45,820
Kural isn't there in that room.

745
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:47,310
What?

746
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,000
Where is Kural? He is
not there in that room.

747
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:55,050
If he is not in there then
I don't know where he is.

748
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,900
- Can you hear that noise?
- It coming from inside.

749
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,550
Yes, it's coming from there.

750
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,670
You go ahead. Move.

751
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,140
Wait for me! Wait!

752
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,930
The door's not opening. Lord
of the dark please help me.

753
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:47,480
What's going on here?

754
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:52,090
With whom is he
playing ping pong?

755
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:59,300
Lord of the dark please help me
open the door. No it's not working.

756
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:06,640
Look at the plight of that ball.
Imagine the plight of our...

757
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,430
I wonder what's going
to happen to us.

758
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,560
Phone! It's your phone!

759
01:17:21,656 --> 01:17:22,656
It's Thomas.

760
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,670
- Pick it up.
- Thomas?

761
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,690
Attend it!

762
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,160
Hello...

763
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,670
How dare you crooks
double cross me?

764
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,540
Thomas...

765
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,266
- well, that...
- Where are the stones?

766
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:35,320
Why in the hell did you
switch off your phones?

767
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,370
Where is Sures...
err, I mean Nepali?

768
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,760
I have no idea what's
going on here.

769
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,680
Nepali is dead!

770
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,520
Thomas...

771
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,510
it's me Nepali!

772
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,680
They are lying!

773
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,680
They have locked me up.

774
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,280
Please come save me!
Make it fast!

775
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,240
Shiva?

776
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,720
Was it indeed Nepali
who spoke to me?

777
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,890
So was Shiva lying?

778
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,160
If Nepali is dead...

779
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,360
how would he talk to me?

780
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,000
Why did Shiva lie to
me that Nepali died?

781
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,820
So that means Nepali is alive.

782
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:33,260
If they had locked up Nepali...

783
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,320
how could he speak to
me from Shiva's phone?

784
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:43,280
Are they trying to use him
as bait and lock me too?

785
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,600
Moonlight Park.

786
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,490
Moonlight Park.

787
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,590
Moonlight Park.

788
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,460
Moonlight Park.

789
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,040
You are in great danger.

790
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,790
Sir, there is a fellow
wandering around the house.

791
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:36,431
When inquired, he says that there
is some problem around the house.

792
01:20:36,455 --> 01:20:37,455
Problem?

793
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,440
- Hand the phone to him.
- Ok sir.

794
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,626
Does this house belong to you?

795
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:50,970
Yeah. What is it?

796
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:54,030
- What did you do in here?
- What do you mean?

797
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,730
You are in great danger.

798
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,830
Would you stop blabbering?

799
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,680
Hand over the phone back
to guy who gave it you.

800
01:21:07,286 --> 01:21:08,286
Sir?

801
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:10,750
He sounds too mean.
How does he appear?

802
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:14,310
He must be around
45-50 years old.

803
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,820
- He is wearing a jean...
- Cool, very good.

804
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:20,700
What else? Does he have 2 arms.
2 legs and a di...

805
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:24,236
I meant does he look like someone
from the police or media?

806
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,090
No, he doesn't look so.

807
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,180
- He claims to be an exorcist.
- An exorcist?

808
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,120
Fine. Ask him to leave and...

809
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:32,800
then you guys clean the house.

810
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,150
Hold on...

811
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
Not now.

812
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,790
- You guys do the cleaning during night.
- Ok sir.

813
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:55,630
Shit!

814
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,560
Sir...

815
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,670
I am Thomas.

816
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,509
It was my house you
were investigating.

817
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,900
Remember we spoke over
the phone the other day?

818
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:55,480
You said I was blabbering?

819
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:57,570
And yet here you are.

820
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,690
I didn't understand the
seriousness back then.

821
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,400
I had been there
for a research...

822
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,976
when I got in to the
compound of your house the

823
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,670
energy meter in my device
started moving high.

824
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:21,030
I went in and investigated.

825
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,170
I sensed that there were very
furious spirits in there.

826
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:29,496
The spirits had been in control of
that place for long and as a result...

827
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,688
that place has turned
dark, so dark that even

828
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,880
the day light cannot
penetrate in there.

829
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:40,241
As a temporary prevention
measure to prevent

830
01:23:40,253 --> 01:23:41,936
those spirits from
stepping outside...

831
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,580
I was carrying out
some procedures.

832
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,520
That's when your men stopped by.

833
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:48,850
And then they informed you.

834
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:52,120
You must be thinking why would
I help you for no reason.

835
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,760
My intention is not to help you.

836
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,260
My intention is to help such struggling
spirits to find light and peace.

837
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,440
In order to solve this issue...

838
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:05,970
what should I do?

839
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,620
Tell me what happened there?

840
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,140
What did you do over there?

841
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,690
Tell me without missing even
the smallest of detail.

842
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,570
Only if you tell me
the destination...

843
01:24:15,594 --> 01:24:17,044
I'll be able to guide you to it.

844
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,750
So tell me.

845
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,440
Well..

846
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:23,009
Your hesitating
behavior shows that...

847
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:24,630
you have done
something very wrong.

848
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:27,760
Only if you can tell
me everything...

849
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,220
I can try doing something.

850
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,050
I am a police
officer at Vellore.

851
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,260
Once...

852
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:41,970
Buddy, I feel very bad.

853
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,740
I have no idea whom
to share with.

854
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:49,696
Suresh, I joined hands with Thomas
after you recommended him to me.

855
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,800
I committed all the crimes out there
and for what? All for damn money!

856
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:55,840
But that bastard...

857
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:57,600
had an affair with my wife.

858
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:04,660
Forget that pervert but see
what my wife did to me?

859
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,220
I'm gonna kill her and...

860
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:08,510
then I'll commit suicide.

861
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,720
Buddy...

862
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:18,160
Thomas carries out all his smuggling and
black money transactions under my name.

863
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,590
All those documents
and details...

864
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,950
will be sent you in a
video file in whatsapp.

865
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:27,000
Don't worry, you both are safe.

866
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:32,100
That son of a gun should never
wear the police uniform again.

867
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:33,770
Today it's me.

868
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:35,870
Tomorrow it could be you guys.

869
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,760
So you guys better leave him.

870
01:25:39,396 --> 01:25:40,396
Suresh...

871
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,730
please ensure that this video reaches
where it is supposed to reach.

872
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,440
Did you finish him off already?

873
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,940
Dispose this lady's corpse.

874
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,680
- Ok.
- Let his corpse be here.

875
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,890
Make sure you don't leave
any evidence behind.

876
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,760
Do not dispose the
corpse in this locality.

877
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,070
- Dispose it off in the forest nearby.
- Ok.

878
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:33,810
Also, delete those
videos in your mobile.

879
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:41,900
Hold her.

880
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:45,310
Lift.

881
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,130
Sir, retired ACP Rangarajan
is here to meet you.

882
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,410
Why is he here now?

883
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:12,270
Send him in.

884
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:23,940
- Hello Thomas.
- Hello sir.

885
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:25,370
Please.

886
01:27:39,946 --> 01:27:40,946
How are you sir?

887
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,970
You tell me Thomas,
how have you been?

888
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:43,760
I'm fine sir.

889
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:45,330
This is my daughter Tulasi.

890
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,820
She is doing her final
year B.Sc Criminology.

891
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,130
Sir...

892
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:52,490
I am here to discuss
about her internship.

893
01:27:53,239 --> 01:27:54,519
You could have just made a call.

894
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,790
Nope. I thought it would be better if I
could meet you in person and request.

895
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,110
You can join anytime. You
can even join tomorrow.

896
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:03,990
Thank you sir.

897
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,280
Thank you Thomas. I don't want
to take much of your time.

898
01:28:06,304 --> 01:28:07,854
No mention sir. I'll
take care of her.

899
01:28:07,954 --> 01:28:08,954
Sure.

900
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,340
Shall we leave?

901
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:18,700
God be the answer.

902
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,480
God be the reason.

903
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:24,736
God be the answer.

904
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,030
God be the reason.

905
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:46,426
This life is sweet like
a never ending kiss...

906
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:50,900
What else could you ask for?

907
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:58,436
A bright and graceful moon...

908
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:03,040
shines upon me.

909
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,430
A shoulder to rest
and feel secure.

910
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,720
Thanks to destiny for placing
me safely in your hands.

911
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:18,540
God be the answer.

912
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:21,840
God be the reason.

913
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,666
A surgery might help talk again.

914
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:27,550
God be the reason.

915
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,310
God be the answer.

916
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,336
God be the reason.

917
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:32,810
Fool!

918
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:34,410
Can't you safe guard a file?

919
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:37,450
- Sir it accidentally got deleted.
- Stop giving me such lame excuses!

920
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,350
What happened sir?
Why are you upset?

921
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,970
Well, there is this
important case file.

922
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,810
It accidentally got deleted.

923
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:49,980
Shall I give it a try
to retrieve it back?

924
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,360
May I?

925
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:54,900
Sorry.

926
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:58,520
God be the answer.

927
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:01,270
God be the reason.

928
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:04,586
God be the answer.

929
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:07,200
God be the reason.

930
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,310
God be the answer.

931
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,450
Now that was awesome. Is it possible
to retrieve any deleted file?

932
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:18,390
Any deleted files can be recovered from the
data storage device using this method.

933
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,930
God be the answer.

934
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,970
God be the reason.

935
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,600
God be the answer.

936
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:11,220
A life filled with affection
makes it worth living.

937
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:16,930
Even tough times for the
loved ones brings sorrow.

938
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:23,180
Like the ever smiling dolls
and worry free children...

939
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:28,860
we live happily. We are
the epitome of love.

940
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:35,230
At the hour of need even
father cares like a mother.

941
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:40,610
Thanks to god for
granting all the wishes.

942
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:47,350
A shoulder to rest
and feel secure.

943
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:52,516
Thanks to destiny for placing
me safely in your hands.

944
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,156
God be the answer.

945
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,660
God be the reason.

946
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:00,920
God be the answer.

947
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,960
God be the reason.

948
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:07,186
God be the answer.

949
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:09,970
God be the reason.

950
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:12,800
God be the answer.

951
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:16,070
God be the reason.

952
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:31,116
God be the answer.

953
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:34,080
God be the reason.

954
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,970
Greetings sir.

955
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,096
I am coming from 3rd
street, Kumaran colony.

956
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,956
The is a very bad stinking odor
coming from my neighbor's place.

957
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,320
I don't anyone in there.

958
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:02,490
So I peeked in and found that the
person living there was dead.

959
01:33:03,596 --> 01:33:04,596
Where did you say?

960
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,060
3rd street, Kumaran colony.

961
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,610
- Fine. Check for any evidence.
- Ok sir.

962
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,950
Hello?

963
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:02,960
It's me. Suresh.

964
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,570
Please move away.

965
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,060
Tell me.

966
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,810
Hope everything is
executed safely.

967
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:14,390
Yes. Perfectly executed.

968
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:41,680
That's fine. Why are you
calling from a new number?

969
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,640
Well nothing, I misplaced
my cell phone.

970
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,460
I didn't find it anywhere.

971
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,630
I'll go check
Sharath's house once.

972
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:04,980
Isn't this Suresh's cellphone?
Why is it here?

973
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:23,330
You fool!

974
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:26,300
And you are telling it now and
you talk like it's no big deal?

975
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:27,980
You are nothing but useless!

976
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:30,330
To hell with you! Now
hang up the call.

977
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,640
- Kumar.
- Yes sir.

978
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,570
- Did you find any cell phone?
- Cell phone?

979
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:49,630
No sir, I didn't
find any cell phone.

980
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:56,650
Did you get any evidence?

981
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:59,150
There are nail marks on
the deceased person.

982
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,170
Apart from that I didn't
find anything else.

983
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:03,940
Did you happen to
find anything else...

984
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:07,420
like his or his
wife's cell phone?

985
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:10,590
No sir. I didn't find
anything of that sorts.

986
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,510
Oh. Ok.

987
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:35,500
It's empty.

988
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,460
Velu was the town
inspector back then.

989
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,210
I got introduced to Thomas then.

990
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:07,580
I carried out petty crimes
based on his orders.

991
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:11,290
Thomas and auditor Jagadish were
involved in black money dealing.

992
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:14,890
They both had a clash
while sharing the loot.

993
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,200
Thomas ended up thrashing
that auditor to death.

994
01:37:17,636 --> 01:37:18,636
Later...

995
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:21,670
he staged a play and turned the
murder in to an accident case.

996
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:26,330
He took up that case himself
and closed the file.

997
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:30,650
Shit!

998
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:34,280
I never expected this from him.

999
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:37,660
Now that we have all the evidences, leave
it to me. I'll handle those culprits.

1000
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,230
No, when I went in there...

1001
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:47,730
she was all smiles and
watching television.

1002
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,160
But...

1003
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,500
the moment she saw me
she ran away inside.

1004
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:56,036
I have a strong doubt
that she has the phone.

1005
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:57,060
You doubt?

1006
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,390
If she has the phone...

1007
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:05,970
and if she had checked it...

1008
01:38:08,290 --> 01:38:10,570
it would be empty. You
deleted everything, right?

1009
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:13,370
How can the deleted files be...

1010
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:15,960
How can it be retrieved? How?

1011
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:19,290
Recovery! Recovery software!

1012
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,800
You numb nuts! Can't you
safe guard a petty phone?

1013
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:29,010
If she had recovered
the files...

1014
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:32,130
then she would have got to
know the complete details.

1015
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,920
Than how would she smile at you?

1016
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,520
Obviously she won't.

1017
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,750
If she has found
out everything...

1018
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:47,410
whom would she approach next?

1019
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,660
Whom will she approach for help?

1020
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:52,920
Hello Sathyamurthy sir?

1021
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:54,620
It's me Rangarajan.

1022
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:56,510
She would have got
her dad's help.

1023
01:38:58,190 --> 01:38:59,960
If she had approached her dad...

1024
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:02,550
what would he do?

1025
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:05,870
What would he do?

1026
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:15,020
Sir?

1027
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,100
Hey Janani...

1028
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:20,270
We are starting. We'll
reach there on time.

1029
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,920
Who is this?

1030
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:30,310
And this?

1031
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:34,580
Now who is this?

1032
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:36,260
Then, this one and this one?

1033
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:08,230
What happened?

1034
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:10,420
The tyre has gone flat.
I'll fix it.

1035
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:11,830
What happened dad?

1036
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,200
It's a flat tyre.

1037
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:17,180
I told you not to
take this route.

1038
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:19,090
This is the easiest
of all the routes.

1039
01:40:19,490 --> 01:40:20,490
Fine. Make it fast.

1040
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:33,130
Looks like he wants to pee.
Come I'll take you.

1041
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:54,150
Hold this.

1042
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,870
- Where is Tulasi?
- Sir, it's fixed.

1043
01:41:07,894 --> 01:41:09,894
I don't know. I saw
her going that way.

1044
01:41:19,110 --> 01:41:20,110
Tulasi!

1045
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:23,446
Who's that? Hey Tulasi!

1046
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:24,510
Hey you!

1047
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:35,520
What you did was too cruel.

1048
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,620
The affected spirits are
furious and fierce.

1049
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:42,870
Now, what do I do?

1050
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:46,690
You or any one even remotely related
to you goes in to that house,

1051
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:48,150
in fact...

1052
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,820
if some one calls out your name
it'll drive those spirits crazy!

1053
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:55,450
The glass pyramid and lemons that I had
buried are only a temporary solution.

1054
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:58,560
So don't we have any
permanent solution?

1055
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:01,256
In order to permanently see off those
spirits back to light and peace...

1056
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,480
we would require a different
kind of mercury limestones.

1057
01:42:03,504 --> 01:42:05,814
If it can be buried at certain
point around the house...

1058
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:07,930
the spirits will rest
in peace forever.

1059
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:09,900
But such mercury lime stones...

1060
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:11,390
are rare these days.

1061
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:14,280
It can be probably
found in some museums.

1062
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:18,150
So the pyramids and lemon
that you had buried,

1063
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:20,000
how long will they hold good?

1064
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:22,540
At the maximum 2 to 3 years.

1065
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,610
By then if the spirits
don't rest in peace...

1066
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:26,760
no one can save you.

1067
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:30,060
So if I get those mercury stones
can we get rid of those spirits?

1068
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:33,410
You can never get rid
of the spirits...

1069
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,980
but they can be convinced
and put to rest in peace.

1070
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,620
Do such gypsum still exist?

1071
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,840
It does.

1072
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:45,860
But not here in India.

1073
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:49,870
In countries like Egypt, Vietnam,
Cambodia and Thailand...

1074
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:52,510
gypsum stones are used
to build temples.

1075
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,256
Bullets shots were found
in Rangarajan's body.

1076
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,320
His son's throat has been slit.

1077
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:03,236
Retired ACP Rangarajan's
murder case gets intense...

1078
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,928
as the police are now
on the lookout for his

1079
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:08,620
missing daughter and
his relative Suresh.

1080
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,700
Based on speculations
it looks like...

1081
01:43:10,724 --> 01:43:14,764
the affair between Tulasi and Suresh could
be the reason behind Rangarajan's death.

1082
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:26,270
So if you finish me off, do you
think it'll solve your problems?

1083
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:28,240
You fool!

1084
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:30,840
You are the root cause
of all my problems.

1085
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:34,190
Now is that your fault...

1086
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,950
or your bad luck?

1087
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,380
Don't you know about me?

1088
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:44,490
I can finish you right here, right now
and there won't be a trace of it.

1089
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:48,150
Don't worry.

1090
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:49,910
I won't do that...

1091
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,560
because...

1092
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,610
I need a favour from you.

1093
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:56,740
You must do it.

1094
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:58,030
You will do it.

1095
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:01,620
I want you to join a gang.

1096
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:04,273
Finish the assignments
along with them and ensure

1097
01:44:04,285 --> 01:44:06,200
that all the loot is
delivered to me safely.

1098
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:20,900
Mr. Raj...

1099
01:44:21,936 --> 01:44:22,936
Mr. Raj!

1100
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,240
Thomas believe me.
I am innocent!

1101
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,680
- It was all Shiva's plan...
- Hey!

1102
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:30,820
Mr. Raj...

1103
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,810
- Where is Kural?
- Kural?

1104
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:34,166
Kural?

1105
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:35,460
How would I know?

1106
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,350
He has started talking
out of the blue...

1107
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:40,560
and has even started to mimic other's
voice. I've no idea where he is.

1108
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:41,880
Look what you've done!

1109
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,830
Oh! This one?

1110
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:47,270
Once during childhood, when I
watching the horror movie "Omen"...

1111
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:49,266
and it scared me so much that I
peed right there in the theater.

1112
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:51,058
After that, I had a good
run so far but today

1113
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:52,850
again I lost it after
what I witnessed here.

1114
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:55,359
Please do not tell anyone else
about this leaking incident.

1115
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,889
Especially, please do not let any
of the ladies know about this.

1116
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:59,390
You see that will
spoil my image.

1117
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:02,410
Why does she look upset?
Did she too...?

1118
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,480
I can hear some
noise from outside.

1119
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:20,930
Oh my god!

1120
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:37,740
- We must escape from here!
- Yes! Yes!

1121
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:39,936
- What about Kural?
- Forget Kural!

1122
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,940
Now that he can talk, he'll
find his own way out.

1123
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:45,510
We must escape and come back
with back up to save Kural.

1124
01:45:45,534 --> 01:45:47,894
So what are you waiting for?
Let's escape!

1125
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:49,480
The door's not opening.

1126
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:54,240
Oh! Oh! We are locked inside.

1127
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,710
We are in deep shit!

1128
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,240
We are gonna die!

1129
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,396
What now Shiva?

1130
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:01,800
Yeah right! Ask for
more ideas from Shiva!

1131
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:04,070
All this is happening
because of Shiva.

1132
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:06,836
Look at you. Tell me, do you ever
use your brain. I mean, like ever?

1133
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,420
It was your idea to come here!
Now look!

1134
01:46:08,444 --> 01:46:10,066
Mr. Raj, mind your tongue.

1135
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:12,440
No I won't. You numb nuts!

1136
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:15,166
How dare you raise
your hands on me?

1137
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:17,510
I adopted you, raised you and
this is what I get in return.

1138
01:46:17,534 --> 01:46:19,806
If you have guts then I challenge
you to wrestle with me!

1139
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:22,370
How about escaping from the
balcony in the bedroom?

1140
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:25,000
Let's do that. Come on.

1141
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:30,056
I knew it! I knew you won't have the guts!
You better watch out.

1142
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,869
The most important thing
in a man's life...

1143
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:33,200
is honor and nothing else!

1144
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,030
Bleedy!

1145
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,660
At times, honor is
not that important.

1146
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:41,916
Life is what counts the most.

1147
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:44,450
Hey wait for me. Take me
along with you. Wait!

1148
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:50,366
I guess this ghost must
have been a security guard.

1149
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:52,110
The security here seems
to be very tight!

1150
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,670
Now look at that.

1151
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:58,810
Looks like the ghost like us
and doesn't want us to leave.

1152
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:06,840
You again?

1153
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:08,710
Didn't I warn you not
to come back here?

1154
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:10,860
Now what do you want?

1155
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,720
Sir, I have found those
mercury lime stones.

1156
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:15,100
You found them?

1157
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,440
Hand them over to me and leave.

1158
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:20,220
Well...

1159
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:22,020
those stones are
inside that house.

1160
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:23,310
How did it end up there?

1161
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:25,900
Well that... few
of my friends...

1162
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:30,860
This is Karma at work Thomas, which
is why the stones are locked there.

1163
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,520
Sir...

1164
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:34,620
What do you want me to do?

1165
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:35,730
You must tell me.

1166
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:37,670
We must retrieve those stones.

1167
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,200
It's not a walk in the park.

1168
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,130
You can't get them back.

1169
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,960
We must. At least to rescue
my friends in there.

1170
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:06,510
Go rescue them.

1171
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,580
- With this?
- Confused?

1172
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,040
Are you confused how this lemon
can help you rescue them?

1173
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:16,910
I've piled up positive
energy in it.

1174
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,990
No spirits can harm
you when you have it.

1175
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:24,616
The negative energy there will slowly start
to absorb the positive energy in this.

1176
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:27,710
Before it's power wears out
you must get out from there.

1177
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,400
What do you mean?

1178
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:32,220
How will I know it?

1179
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:35,150
As soon as you get in with it, the
lemon will start getting dehydrated.

1180
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,960
It'll rot completely.

1181
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:41,170
The minute it starts to rot
you must get out from there.

1182
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:44,250
Once it is completely rotten
and if you are still inside...

1183
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:46,274
then no one can save you.

1184
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:54,670
Ok sir.

1185
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:01,100
Shiva, what do we do now?

1186
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:03,370
Nothing else...

1187
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:05,180
but wait here for death.
Thanks to him.

1188
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:06,850
At least we had met Thomas...

1189
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:09,680
he would given us at least diamond
pieces if not the stones.

1190
01:49:10,150 --> 01:49:12,760
But instead this fellow dragged
us on to our own death.

1191
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:15,330
Amidst all this tension
look at these love birds,

1192
01:49:15,354 --> 01:49:17,284
they can't just keep their
hands off each other!

1193
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:18,750
Shiva!

1194
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:21,120
Remember the cellphone
Kural destroyed?

1195
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:22,930
Let's try reassembling
it and see if it works?

1196
01:49:22,931 --> 01:49:25,226
There is no clue about what
happened to Nepali's corpse.

1197
01:49:25,227 --> 01:49:27,526
Are you sure we'll be able
to get that cell phone?

1198
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:29,040
- Mr. Raj, please...
- Ok.

1199
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:30,580
I'll try finding it.

1200
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:33,270
Dear Shiva...

1201
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:35,550
don't mind me telling
this to you.

1202
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:38,120
If we get that cell phone
and if it works...

1203
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,740
let's call up Thomas and...

1204
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:44,180
ask him send us a
cab, so that...

1205
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:47,330
we can escape from here...

1206
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:52,010
There he goes again with that
expression-less expression.

1207
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:56,530
Someone please tell me
if he is angry or sad!

1208
01:50:16,616 --> 01:50:17,616
Riya...

1209
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:18,640
any help?

1210
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:21,000
Do you have idea about it?

1211
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,370
Of course. I know it
works on Under-void OS.

1212
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:25,520
It's Android!

1213
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:27,660
I guess they must
have changed it.

1214
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:31,240
Post Steve Job era everything has
changed in the Android world.

1215
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:35,490
What?

1216
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:36,950
Why are you staring at me?

1217
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:38,960
Stop it. You are scaring me!

1218
01:50:41,370 --> 01:50:43,120
So you were looking for this?

1219
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:46,080
Nepali?

1220
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,010
Indeed it's him.

1221
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:49,050
Why is his photo here?

1222
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:50,220
Shiva!

1223
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:52,970
Check this out.

1224
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,760
This house, Thomas and Nepali...

1225
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,780
there is definitely some
link between these three.

1226
01:51:18,770 --> 01:51:19,990
If my guess is correct...

1227
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,270
then Thomas must be
on his way here.

1228
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:45,086
Please don't harm me!

1229
01:51:45,110 --> 01:51:46,256
- Tulasi.
- Leave me!

1230
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,080
Please don't harm me!

1231
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:50,910
Please don't harm me!

1232
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:36,260
Aren't you guys done yet?

1233
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:39,040
Why wait for me always?

1234
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:42,410
I ain't that
dedicated at work...

1235
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:45,600
but look at you, so dedicated
even after retirement.

1236
01:54:47,410 --> 01:54:49,166
One last thing.

1237
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:50,190
Don't do this!

1238
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:53,560
My heart felt thanks for having
such a beautiful daughter.

1239
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:56,920
My dear partner, a big
thanks to you too.

1240
01:54:57,070 --> 01:54:58,070
Thomas!

1241
01:55:06,986 --> 01:55:07,986
Listen...

1242
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:09,290
dispose off all their bodies.

1243
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:11,370
Ok?

1244
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,620
What about Tulasi?

1245
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:14,970
Leave her there.

1246
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:18,910
Come on help me.

1247
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:33,540
Shiva!

1248
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:35,870
Upstairs.

1249
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:49,180
Nope!

1250
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:51,180
It must be Thomas.

1251
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,830
Shiva, we are doomed!

1252
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:36,420
Thomas is not here empty handed.

1253
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:37,366
What?

1254
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:38,390
He has a gun!

1255
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:48,140
What happened? I hear nothing.

1256
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:50,700
Do you think the ghost might
have finished off Thomas?

1257
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:57,860
Shiva!

1258
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:01,950
There you go! This fellow ain't leaving
here without the Ghost's blessing.

1259
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:04,110
I wonder what he'll to do us?

1260
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,250
Shiva!

1261
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:06,070
Where are you?

1262
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:08,870
If Thomas find us out...

1263
01:59:25,276 --> 01:59:26,276
Hey!

1264
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:27,300
Who's there?

1265
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:39,720
Who's that?

1266
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:42,270
Shiva?

1267
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,720
Is it you?

1268
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,530
You better come out.

1269
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:55,916
Shiva...

1270
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:56,940
is it you?

1271
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:59,510
How dare you raise
your hands on me?

1272
02:00:08,150 --> 02:00:09,296
Oh my god!

1273
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,880
Mr. Raj, I guess Thomas
has murdered Shiva!

1274
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:13,300
Riya!

1275
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:16,250
I'll take it from here.

1276
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:17,370
Mr. Raj?

1277
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:21,340
I'll be back!

1278
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:23,940
I'll be back.

1279
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:26,560
- Mr. Raj don't go.
- I'll be back.

1280
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:17,890
Shiva?

1281
02:01:27,646 --> 02:01:28,646
Shiva!

1282
02:01:28,670 --> 02:01:29,670
Shiva!

1283
02:01:49,830 --> 02:01:50,830
Riya!

1284
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:52,950
Turn on the lights.

1285
02:01:54,916 --> 02:01:55,916
Shiva...

1286
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,250
please don't do this to me.

1287
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:58,750
That stones are all I need.

1288
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,086
Hand them over to me...

1289
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:01,980
my life relies on them. Please!

1290
02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:04,690
Your life doesn't rely
on those stones...

1291
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:06,250
it's in this gun point.

1292
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:08,970
Just let me go. Please!

1293
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:12,366
Didn't see that coming, right?

1294
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:14,390
You didn't see it coming right?

1295
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:16,250
Don't call yourself Thomas...

1296
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:17,676
You are Dumb a$$!

1297
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:20,090
You are held at gun point
as well as knife point.

1298
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:21,750
How are you gonna escape this?

1299
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,716
Now, I didn't see that coming.

1300
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:26,690
Won't you guys ever
let me play hero?

1301
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,040
Shiva, help me please.

1302
02:02:30,370 --> 02:02:33,440
Did you just say that my
life is at your gun point?

1303
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:35,740
Don't you under
estimate me you kiddo!

1304
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:37,640
Hand me over those
stones or else...

1305
02:02:38,130 --> 02:02:40,670
I'll slit him nice and slow!

1306
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,640
Officer I agree
that he is a kid.

1307
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:45,530
But I'm a senior citizen so
please have some consideration.

1308
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:57,090
Nepali?

1309
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:58,950
Nepali!

1310
02:02:59,350 --> 02:03:01,600
- What did you guys do to him?
- That was not us.

1311
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,440
A guy like Morgan Freeman from
'Bruce Almighty' showed up and...

1312
02:03:04,464 --> 02:03:07,810
finished him off! He made
Nepali salute with his own leg!

1313
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I am going to
finish you all off!

1314
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,200
Lord Blackwood please
open the door!

1315
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:17,936
Err... I mean lord of dark
please open the door.

1316
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:18,986
Please open it! Please!

1317
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:20,710
Don't you escape!
I'll gun you down!

1318
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,790
Please open it! Please!

1319
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:24,590
Thank you lord of the dark!

1320
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:30,580
Come on.

1321
02:03:33,026 --> 02:03:34,026
Shiva!

1322
02:03:34,050 --> 02:03:35,050
Open the door!

1323
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:37,480
Stop irritating me fellas!

1324
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:40,280
Hand me over the stones! Shiva!

1325
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:42,890
You can't escape
anywhere from here.

1326
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,550
So just open the door!

1327
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:58,470
Shiva...

1328
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:00,380
Shiva.

1329
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:04,266
Can't you hear me going on and on.
Can't you at least reply?

1330
02:04:04,290 --> 02:04:05,720
Mr. Thomas!

1331
02:04:20,910 --> 02:04:21,910
Nepali?

1332
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:40,700
Nepali...

1333
02:04:40,970 --> 02:04:41,980
stop kidding.

1334
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:44,340
We are running out
of time Suresh!

1335
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:47,770
I'm already confused.
So stop kidding!

1336
02:04:48,530 --> 02:04:49,550
These guys I tell you.

1337
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:28,170
Is it you?

1338
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,350
How dare you raise
your hands on me?

1339
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:38,300
Your time is up!

1340
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:43,690
Thomas!

1341
02:06:34,156 --> 02:06:35,156
Mr. Raj...

1342
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:36,940
- Come on. Quick!
- Start the car.

1343
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:39,940
- Where is Kural?
- He is coming. You start the car.

1344
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:46,180
Kural! Make it fast.

1345
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:48,080
Come on. Quick!

1346
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:54,380
Please let me go!

1347
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:56,420
Let me go. No!

1348
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:25,910
Dear god and goddess
of the dark, bless me!

1349
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:28,010
Mr. Raj, want some chicken?

1350
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,520
Chicken?

1351
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:33,640
Well, no thank you. You may
have the chicken and the chick.

1352
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:36,790
Sir, what's with your attire?

1353
02:07:37,170 --> 02:07:39,040
Looks very funny!

1354
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:40,790
I needed that!

1355
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:45,530
Had I been in fashion I would have
given Lady Gaga a run for her money.

1356
02:07:46,190 --> 02:07:49,350
But thanks to this horror season and the
ghosts, I have opted for spirituality.

1357
02:07:49,550 --> 02:07:50,770
So take a hike.

1358
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,810
Go do some good deeds.

1359
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,210
Come on, seal the deal.

1360
02:08:08,410 --> 02:08:10,830
Youths these days are
mere chatter boxes!

1361
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:12,800
They have no
responsibility at all.

1362
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:15,810
How could they be so
careless with this box?

1363
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:39,470
Mr.Raj...

1364
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:40,406
where is Kural?

1365
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:41,430
Kural?

1366
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,080
I don't know. Let
me go find him.

1367
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:05,286
ACP Sathymurthy speaking.

1368
02:09:05,310 --> 02:09:06,310
It's me.

1369
02:09:07,286 --> 02:09:08,286
Thomas!

1370
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:09,530
Where were you all these days?

1371
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:12,050
The whole department
is looking for you.

1372
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:14,280
They want to meet you.

1373
02:09:14,806 --> 02:09:15,806
Meet me?

1374
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:16,830
Who are they?

1375
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:18,250
Stop blabbering!

1376
02:09:27,190 --> 02:09:29,930
For all those jump-scares you gave
me, I'm gonna get back at you!

1377
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:44,990
Looks like the ghost isn't
done blessing us all!
