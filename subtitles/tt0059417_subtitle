1
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,335
Hail Baba Virinchi!
Hail Baba Virinchi!

2
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,645
Where are you from?

3
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,406
Sir, we are from Benaras.

4
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,477
Oh!, Kashi!! - Yes, sir.

5
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,315
I haven't been to that
place for a long time

6
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,156
Oh! So you also.. I mean..

7
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,320
It's too crowded.

8
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,831
So true, Sir.. still..

9
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,327
I had predicted long ago,
the city is built..

10
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,840
..but it wouldn't remain the same.

11
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,675
It will go through many changes.

12
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,714
Lot many people would come & go..

13
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,686
One day Shankar came to me and told,
You may not agree to Evolution".

14
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,692
But you must accept
that Gautam destroyed the country.

15
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,788
Don't you think that
a solution should be brought out?

16
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:33,804
I said, What solution? Go ahead
if you get peace through it.

17
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,639
But remember one thing. People
will be there to spoil your deeds..

18
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,807
..people will play football with
religious sentiments. Be prepared.

19
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:51,323
He was talented. But medical
Science had not progressed much.

20
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,828
So he breathed his last
at the age of 25 itself.

21
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,131
Rise up!

22
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,138
Rise up!

23
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,222
I need to have a look at my son
once daily, just to be sure.

24
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,659
Baba.. - What's the matter?

25
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,891
I am mentally very much
disturbed, Baba.

26
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,699
What's your name?

27
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,499
My name is Gurupad, Baba.

28
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,330
Please come here.

29
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,775
Touch his feet.

30
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:30,388
She is my youngest daughter.
Her name is Bujhki.. Nilima.

31
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:37,453
I am at my wits end in trying to
find a suitable match for her.

32
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,132
Please make her get a
suitable match, Baba

33
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,794
I've not been able to
Get a suitable match

34
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,205
Not been able to get one? -Yes, Baba

35
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,473
I'm not able to do anything,
despite all my efforts.

36
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,209
Hold it!

37
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,311
Hold it tightly!

38
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:13,665
Tell me now, is there any
disturbance in the mind..

39
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,567
..any pain or sorrow..

40
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,834
..any tiredness, any complaint..

41
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,459
What happened, brother Nitai?

42
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:51,462
If I meet a learned saint then
I'll abandon my family & leave

43
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,136
But why?

44
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,406
You'll take into asceticism!!!

45
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,145
You won't understand.. my
life has become a hell.

46
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,153
At home my wife doesn't stop
nagging for a moment..

47
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,157
..in the office, the new boss
is always eating my head..

48
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,319
..I am in a real mess.

49
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,766
If you know any good saint
then please let me know

50
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,325
You won't meet any saint ever..

51
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,338
..as by speaking all rubbish
you've made me lose my minister

52
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:31,342
It's a primary condition to speak
less in spiritual pursuits.

53
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,178
You are an lnsurance Agent.
When even you can practice..

54
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,252
..meditation, then why
won't I get a saint?

55
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:48,351
I am an intellectual, well, leave
it. You won't understand.

56
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,364
Huh! Keep all your lousy
talks to yourself

57
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,361
Do you have the habit
of eating green chilies?

58
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,547
Brother Nitai..

59
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,217
Yes.

60
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:23,554
There is a saint on the
bank of Jaggannath.

61
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,164
Lots of people have visited him
and have donated full heartedly

62
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,329
The next day onwards they are
getting relief from their troubles

63
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,437
Would you like to try with a new
one, like Swami Taritananda

64
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,175
There are 2 types of treatments
given by the saint

65
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,843
One is Negative, the
other is positive

66
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,682
He brings down the electricity
from the sky and blows it..

67
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,779
..on people with a leaf.
- Oh! Really?

68
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,348
Please go to him, all your
sufferings will vanish

69
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,861
Electrotherapy!!!

70
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:05,530
I have just one suffering.
That's scarcity of money.

71
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,540
I'll appreciate his powers if
he can get me some great wealth

72
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,601
How famous a saint he is?

73
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,218
Sure, you'll. Let's say you
are taken to the market..

74
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,220
..for one day in 1 914. - Well, go on

75
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,718
You buy some iron.

76
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,820
Iron!! Okay, go on.

77
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,497
Then you..

78
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,574
What after 1 914?

79
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,442
What happened after 1 914?

80
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,180
After 1 914 you are again
brought back to the '60s

81
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,245
With the irons, you mean..
- Yes, with the irons.

82
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,347
And you sell them off
in the current rate

83
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,187
Current rate?

84
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,595
What happened?
- Disaster!!

85
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,869
200, 300, 400..

86
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,702
The matter is solved.
Once it materializes..

87
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,211
..I'll have a plot of land
and 3 houses in Narendrapur.

88
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,214
I just need the right saint
now - Saint again!!!

89
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,273
Chess is an intellectual play.
People fooling around here..

90
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,875
..are a shame.

91
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,318
This bastard's voice
has spoiled it all

92
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,153
Bujhki has become a disciple

93
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,659
What? -Bujhki has become a disciple

94
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,887
One saint has appeared at their
house. Her father has already..

95
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,158
..submitted himself at his feet.
Now She'll be accepted this time.

96
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,163
Did you go there? - I am
coming from there only

97
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,428
But is the news a good
one or a bad one?

98
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,165
How can her becoming a disciple
be a good news? -Why not?

99
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,569
Even I am considering being a
disciple if I get a good saint

100
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,577
But I am going to propose
to her in a few days

101
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,442
But I have proposed to her -So
what if you're to propose?

102
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,346
Actually you don't know
the character properly

103
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,682
That's why you have failed to
figure out the reason behind..

104
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,451
..Satya's anxiety. You
need an introduction.

105
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,520
Bujhki is..

106
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,522
She is the youngest daughter of
my friend from Alipur, Gurupad.

107
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,264
His wife was Saudamini.
She was Shashi's daughter.

108
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,362
Got it? - Got it

109
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,876
It's almost 3 years now
since she passed away.

110
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,414
My connection to them has the
root in the famous scientist..

111
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,475
..& my childhood friend
Kushuambhini. And his wife is..

112
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,488
..Gurupad's eldest
daughter Nirupama.

113
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:44,157
Satya met Bujhki for the first
time in Nirupama's house.

114
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,664
It was a love at first sight, and
a great desire to marry her..

115
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,759
..from then on.

116
00:12:52,438 --> 00:13:00,243
Clear? - Clear. That matter is that
Satya is in love with Bujhki

117
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,442
And Bujhki has told him that
she will become a disciple

118
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,577
The matter is really
serious. - Exactly!

119
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,183
Satya, carry on please

120
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,348
Fatik, please bring tea for us

121
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,691
They came back from Kashi just
yesterday. I wanted to go..

122
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,665
..there yesterday itself. But my
dress was not ready in the..

123
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,467
..Iaundry. So I had to
postpone it to today

124
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:31,533
This morning, at around 8 O clock,
I reached their house

125
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,374
As soon as I reached, I felt as
if the atmosphere is something..

126
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,143
..strange. The gatekeepers were
standing in a corner & talking.

127
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,648
Even the transistor
was not being played.

128
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,549
It was something strange.

129
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,317
The moment I stepped in to go
upstairs, I glanced back after..

130
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:49,225
..someone's call and saw,
it was uncle Ganesh

131
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,421
Who is this uncle Ganesh now?

132
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,762
Uncle Ganesh is Mr. Mitra's
brother in law.

133
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,563
He is Bujhki's maternal uncle.

134
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,832
Clear? - Clear. After that..?

135
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,230
Isn't Bujhki upstairs?

136
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,674
She is. But they are busy there

137
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,339
Bujhki's father has become
a disciple. -Disciple?

138
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,576
What's there to laugh
at that matter?

139
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,346
The person is a great saint. He
was present in flesh & blood..

140
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,355
..at the time of Kashi's fall.

141
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,412
Kashi? Which Kashi?

142
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,515
Kashi in Benaras. Not a Disease!!

143
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,788
Is the fellow some magical person?

144
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,853
No doubt about it.

145
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,807
You please take leave for today.
Come some other day. - But..

146
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:47,311
Is your son in law alright?

147
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,377
Ok, good bye then.

148
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,817
Satya.. wait a minute please

149
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,759
Do you have any openings for him?

150
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,489
There is one.. but I think
he's also trying his best

151
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,397
Nowadays, trying without
some good backing is futile

152
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,334
But backing takes away
one's self-confidence

153
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:09,340
Well, you know the ways
of the world nowadays.

154
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:14,345
Okay, you go upstairs and
have a quick look at her

155
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,849
I'll come back in a minute.
Please wait over here

156
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,327
Are you calling for me?

157
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,395
What's the matter?

158
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,567
What's all these being
a disciple now?

159
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,501
I've also been a disciple?

160
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,439
Have not you received my letter?

161
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,246
Your letter? - Why? The one
I gave you last time..

162
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,184
Was that written by you?

163
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,280
Huh! Out of 7 lines, 2 lines were
from Shelly, 2 lines from..

164
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,122
..Chandradas and 2 lines
from the poem Sesher Kabita.

165
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,455
And then the ending line, How
are you? Hope you are fine.

166
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,295
But the feelings are purely mine..
I just borrowed their language.

167
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,130
Be happy with your feelings

168
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,395
Listen. - I am busy - But l
have something to say..

169
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,564
Let me first become a disciple,
then I'll hear your talks.

170
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,475
After that? -I came back

171
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,814
Brother Nivaran, now
you are the only hope

172
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,487
Huh! You'll write quotations
in place of love-letter

173
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,651
And then you expect me
to come to your rescue

174
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,321
I'll take care of that matter. You
just remove the saint from there

175
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,160
What if the saint is genuine

176
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,168
Do you think that he
is a genuine saint?

177
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,231
I have an open mind. If he can
survive with his intellect, then..

178
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,333
..it's alright, else
he'll see his doom

179
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:30,508
Will I be able to secure an
appointment with the saint?

180
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,118
Did you see Bujhki's
sister there, Satya?

181
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,446
And does he have any assistant also?

182
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:41,118
Assistant.. yes, he has
one assistant with him

183
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,201
How much is his age? 2000?

184
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:58,534
Get him insurance. You'll
get a good premium

185
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:05,473
Hello, is it Putli? May
I speak to your father?

186
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:10,147
Not at home? Then may
I speak to your mother?

187
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,813
Tell her that Uncle Nivarn wants
to have a word with her

188
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,161
He said that he was present at the
time of Kashi's fall. Right?

189
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,222
He must be talking about his
previous birth. But is it possible?

190
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:27,428
Is it sister-in-law? Where
is your husband?

191
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,505
What experimenting he
has got this time?

192
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,568
Boiling the grass??

193
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,672
Why? Isn't he able to
bear the pipes anymore?

194
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,515
The protein synthesis
is taking place here

195
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:52,361
Grass will become carbohydrate
after being hydrolyzed.

196
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,592
What's that pipe for?

197
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,657
Putli, please play it for him

198
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,276
Only that bubbling??

199
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,385
It's getting oxidized

200
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,480
Please come fast, else
the tea will get cold

201
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,358
So now music will flow from the
rubber pipes and after getting..

202
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,397
..mixed up with grass, will
produce something extraordinary!!

203
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,166
If I get success in this, then
I feel there will be..

204
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,569
..no scarcity of..,

205
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,839
Rice? So there won't be
any scarcity of it?

206
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:47,185
Sister in law, now start
practicing grass-cutting

207
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:52,189
If everyone does it, why should
I have any objection?

208
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,348
I wanted to ask you something.

209
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:58,192
is man walks by two
legs or four legs?

210
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,197
One advantage for the four
footed are the speed

211
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:06,196
Two plus two, four

212
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,803
Sister in law, will you please
tell me about the saint?

213
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,712
Are you talking about Virinchi Baba?

214
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,876
Oh! Is that his name?

215
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:24,546
Putli, please take care of
the cooking - Ok, mother.

216
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:34,564
What's there to tell
about the saint..

217
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,167
When I went home I saw that my
father has become a disciple of..

218
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,170
..the saint. After my mother
passed away, my father had..

219
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,174
..stopped talking to almost all.
He had stopped meeting people.

220
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,177
We thought he was growing mad.

221
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,612
But now he has got a teacher

222
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,243
And a teacher is everything
- So true

223
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,447
So you want to say that
he has gotten into a..

224
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:01,515
..semi-permanent settlement.

225
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,693
I am not that religious

226
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,193
When people become old, they
become religious naturally

227
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,362
Sister in law, what do
you think about him?

228
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,870
He talks very attractively.

229
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:19,878
I don't follow everything. He
speaks of some.. alivity..

230
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,379
Aha.. 'relativity'.

231
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,275
That's the word

232
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,476
So you have also visited him!

233
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:32,820
Not only him, people from all
the communities have flocked in

234
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:41,430
Leonardo Da Vinci. The saint
knows just everything.

235
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,558
Oh! Really?

236
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:47,327
He talks of Czechoslovakian politics.

237
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,336
Einstein used to visit him
- Him? -Yes

238
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,435
He only taught him. -What?

239
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:57,846
The theory of relativity,
E = Mc^2

240
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,180
Babaji taught this!!

241
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,187
To Einstein?

242
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,457
He told this in front of you all!!

243
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,859
And everyone even believed it!!!

244
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,864
Everyone clapped.

245
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,374
Sister in law, can you tell me
the longest age for a human?

246
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,207
Please ask the one
who knows about it

247
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,146
How long can a human being survive?

248
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,306
It can vary.

249
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,682
Still, for how long? 1 50.. 200?

250
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,313
200 to 500.

251
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,484
Can a human live that long?
- Not a Homosapien

252
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,657
And 2000? -1 000? - 2000!

253
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,828
Can a person live since the
fall of Kashi till now?

254
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,839
Why don't you finish the tea?
It's getting cold.

255
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,600
Can one live that long?

256
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,501
By seeing him, he
doesn't look so old.

257
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,175
Bullshit! Not possible
for a homosapien.

258
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:13,189
Would you like to listen to the
incident of Buddha's enlightenment..

259
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,688
Why didn't you expose his reality
when he spoke about..

260
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,858
..Einstein & all, despite
yourself being a scientist?

261
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,392
Don't laugh now

262
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,371
What's the need? If I do such a
thing, people will tell that..

263
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,305
..I am interfering in his
religious matters out of..

264
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,866
..my greed for his property.

265
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,147
But there is an interesting
matter - What?

266
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,206
Please come closer.

267
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,752
This is Present.

268
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,810
Where?

269
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,313
This contact point

270
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,825
This right hand..

271
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,559
..is moving clockwise

272
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,757
This is Future - Oh, really?

273
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,168
And this hand is moving..
- Anti-clockwise.

274
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:04,766
This is by gone, means past.
- Now both are moved together

275
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,835
Moved together? You mean,
in opposite direction?

276
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,179
He says, there is nothing
called Present.

277
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,341
As the time has not
halted for a moment

278
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,353
Difficult!!

279
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,466
Sister in law, can you do it?
Please give it a try - Let me try,

280
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,799
How would I be able to do
it when he himself failed?

281
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,809
Listen to it -What now?

282
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,156
The voice of Babaji!

283
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,335
Time(Kaal) is a very strange thing

284
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:23,711
People say that today
is there, not yesterday.

285
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,849
I say yesterday is there, not today

286
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,127
Yesterday, means Kaal(Time)

287
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:41,137
Time is surely there. But there is
nothing called today or Present

288
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,297
And how can it exist?

289
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,143
As future.. meaning what
will happen in future..

290
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:54,615
..is not staying in one place,
which can be put in chains..

291
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,553
..and kept in one place.

292
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:07,691
Then you'll go and catch it
and say, this is Present.

293
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:15,671
A few days go by.. and the same
time is described as..

294
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,507
..'has happened', or 'happened'

295
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:25,846
It means Past(Bhoot)

296
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:42,131
It made me have an argument
with Plato many a times

297
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,462
What name did he utter?

298
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,299
Plato, the great Roman Astrologer

299
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:55,470
Plato said, I am not
able to follow you.

300
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,538
I am not able to understand you.

301
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,882
You are speaking rubbish.

302
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:14,563
I said, Alright. If you are
unable to follow my words..

303
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:20,572
..then I'll make you understand
with the help of signs.

304
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:27,340
He then asked me, What
signs? He was scared of me.

305
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:33,781
I told him, There is no need
to panic. Have a look here.

306
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:38,451
This is my right hand. And
this is my little finger.

307
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:43,119
This starts moving towards
the right. Clockwise.

308
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,290
It means the direction
in which time moves

309
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,526
In which direction does time move?

310
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,592
Time moves towards the future

311
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:57,800
And this is my left hand. It
starts moving towards left.

312
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,473
Anti-clockwise, meaning, in the
direction of the incidents..

313
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,311
..that have already taken place.

314
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,820
Now they both start moving together

315
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:36,171
Back & front this is what
life is consisted of.

316
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:49,350
Past & Future. The life is bounded
between these 2 points.

317
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:56,732
Please go there and have a
seat behind those people.

318
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,599
Please don't worry. We'll
go and seat silently.

319
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,801
As there are lots of sins in the
mind, we need to purify it.

320
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,203
Please come in.

321
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,550
Go and say the words

322
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,220
Me? - Yes

323
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,227
Go and say your words

324
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,178
Lord..

325
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,181
Who is it?

326
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,187
It's me..,

327
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:54,348
Your face looks familiar.
Where have I seen you?

328
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,416
Seen me? -ln Nepal?

329
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,786
Sir, I stay in the Serpentine Lane

330
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,194
What's your name?

331
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,701
S..Satyaranjan De Sarkar

332
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,405
Now I remembered

333
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,812
In jagat seth's House.

334
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,212
It was his mother's
Funeral day that day.

335
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:29,216
There were lot many people.
King Krishna Chandra..

336
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:36,495
..Janaki Prasad.
Nawab and many more

337
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:43,230
That day Sethji ate a lot.

338
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:47,674
But there was also mismanagement
in the..

339
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:51,841
..distribution of the food.
So many of them left with..

340
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,851
..a bitter mouth.

341
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,189
Incredible!

342
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,857
Now it's your turn.
-Wait for some time

343
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,194
Let it be

344
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,253
So,..son Matiram,

345
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,353
Matiram..!?!

346
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:11,266
I used to know you by that name only

347
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,362
You used to be Sethji's Accountant.

348
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:23,804
You start chanting
the Tujjati chants.

349
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:30,744
After waking up in the morning
chant 'Tujjati' for 1 08 times

350
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,813
Chant it with a fast pace

351
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,880
You may leave now.

352
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:41,163
Lord, which is greater between
the two Paths(Marga)?

353
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,233
Lo & behold!!!

354
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:51,235
The same question was asked to
me by Tulsi, I mean Tulsidas

355
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:57,508
We take food. Don't we?

356
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:02,176
But why do we need to take food?

357
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,344
Because we feel hungry.

358
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,185
What food do we take?

359
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:11,859
We take rice, fruits, vegetables,
meat, fish, etc.

360
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,192
What happens when we have food?

361
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,360
When we have food, the
hunger is satisfied

362
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,529
Therefore.. -Therefore..

363
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,472
At the root of consuming
is man's nature

364
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,204
And the result of consuming
is satisfaction.

365
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:40,150
Tulsi was an ascetic. I told
him, in the absence of..

366
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:47,163
..consuming, satisfaction
will not be attained

367
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,264
After he finished writing the
Ramayana, I introduced him to..

368
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,363
..King Maan Singh, so that
he can have a great life.

369
00:32:55,506 --> 00:33:00,773
He gathered lots of wealth.
But nothing were left

370
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,838
His son Jagat Singh married
a Bengali girl...

371
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,352
..& spent all the money.

372
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,349
Please give me a solution, Lord

373
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,518
What do you want?

374
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,188
Please take me to 1 914

375
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,595
I want to buy some iron
At a cheaper rate

376
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,796
Iron??
- Yes Sir, sorry Lord

377
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,202
At a cheaper rate!!

378
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,136
At the rate of 1 914.

379
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,299
What do you do?

380
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,368
I work as the Ledger Keeper
In an office at Belchapara.

381
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,434
I get a monthly wage of Rs.233.

382
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,140
It's impossible to run my family
with that little money

383
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,306
Impossible to run the family!!

384
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,147
Iron.. my Lord

385
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:46,480
The life is not that easy, my son

386
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,889
Impossible!!!

387
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:57,324
It needs a great deal of
hard work & perseverance

388
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:02,772
It requires great powers to become
strong & stable like the Sun

389
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:09,335
But one has to bring the
Sun also to a back foot.

390
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:14,341
In not having the knowledge
of the Sun-science..

391
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:18,355
..one cannot control Time

392
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,587
It needs a lot of expenditure.

393
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,527
Then Sir.. sorry, Lord..

394
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,188
Then what?

395
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,597
Please show me a way, Lord

396
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,794
There is a way

397
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,299
Is there? - Sure there is.

398
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:43,143
At the dead noon, when
the clock strikes 1 2..

399
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:48,308
..go to the terrace
and look at the Sun

400
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,153
Fixing your look at the Sun,
chant Mattamma for 1 08 times

401
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,815
Mattamma.. Mattammaa

402
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:01,230
Careful so that you don't blink
even for once in between

403
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,768
Your tongue shouldn't get crawled up

404
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,811
The person is..
- What?

405
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,307
Incredible!

406
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,149
But please postpone your decision
to be a disciple for some days

407
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,312
Thank you for your advice.

408
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,219
Everything will be alright -Yes,
he'll set everything alright

409
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,179
This won't work. This
saint is not for me.

410
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,837
So you got fed up so early?

411
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,381
If he really has some magical
powers he should show them.

412
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:37,394
He only keeps describing his
past glories. Bullshit!!!

413
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,622
That also, who can do?

414
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,291
He asked me to look directly
at the Sun and..

415
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,392
..chant without having
a wink. Is it a joke?

416
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:51,203
Let him show me if he can perform
it once without blinking.

417
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,302
There you missed it. If he has
to do it, he'll minimize..

418
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,145
..the brightness of the Sunrays.

419
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:03,817
Nivaran, if you are planning to
unmask that Babaji, I'm with you.

420
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,483
Babaji's new incarnation.

421
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,548
What? - Magician

422
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,222
Have a seat.

423
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,770
When I went there I came
to know about it - Why?

424
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,241
I thought I'll pay a visit to Bujhki

425
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,279
Why? - I knew that I won't be able
to meet her. So I carried..

426
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,180
..a letter with me.
- Quotations again?!?

427
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,274
Not at all, this time
I wrote a poem.

428
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,287
What did you write? - I wrote..

429
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,789
Babaji is a fraud.. but,

430
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,788
You won't mind, I hope - Go on.

431
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,393
But my love is just so pure.

432
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,667
If you become a disciple,
why should I live anymore.

433
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,399
That's all, understood.

434
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,146
Couplet

435
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,148
Great deed. Did you give
her the letter after all?

436
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,549
Actually, I thought that Babaji
gets into his meditating-sleep at

437
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,556
..7 & then people start leaving
for home. So if I go around..

438
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,651
..at 8, I may carry a
chance of meeting her

439
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,824
To be on the safe side, I had
carried the letter with me

440
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,835
When I reached there,
it was exactly 8

441
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,171
There was no sound except the
sound of a clock from inside

442
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:39,180
I did feel a bit nervous,
still I stepped inside

443
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:44,378
Just when I began to climb the
stairs, I felt that there is..

444
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:48,357
..nobody upstairs. Will I have
to go home hopelessly after..

445
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:52,362
..gathering up all courage and
coming here.., I thought

446
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,457
I wanted to have a last try.
I decided to check..

447
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,695
..the backyard of the house.

448
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,199
As soon as I started walking
in that direction..

449
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,364
..I got to hear a strange sound

450
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,869
Then..?
- Then there was the climax

451
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:31,150
She dropped this on the mail
box on her way to the college

452
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,318
What's it?

453
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,665
I know and understand everything,
but I am helpless.

454
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,831
I'll be rescued if Babaji
is flown off from here.

455
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,242
Oh, so Bujhki has got
to know the reality?

456
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,835
She's not that blockheaded
not to understand all these

457
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,507
So it's delighting time for me.

458
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,849
Remove the obstacle & she is mine

459
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,525
So how to remove the obstacle now?

460
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,596
It won't be that so easy

461
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,606
Brother Nivaran, you too!!

462
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,400
He is in a powerful position.

463
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:31,141
He is the greatest obstacle to
my romance & you are saying,

464
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:38,646
That person is a genius. He is
quite learned. Has an amazing..

465
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:44,558
..memory, imagination and..

466
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:48,325
..a great presence of mind.

467
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,562
What else does he need?

468
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:55,435
Then how can you trap him?

469
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:59,840
That's the problem.

470
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,370
But.. - But..

471
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,176
He.. - He..

472
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,184
He would have to be exposed.

473
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,344
Because, -Because?

474
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,720
Because even they won't be able
to carry on if he's not exposed

475
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:19,195
Who?-They, who've encouraged
Him and given shelter to him

476
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,859
Who are supporting him
and letting him grow!

477
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:29,396
What is needed now..
-..is a double exposure

478
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,800
So that two birds are killed
with one arrow itself

479
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,306
But - Again 'But'!!

480
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,480
What is that 'Houn Houn' now?

481
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,490
O genius!

482
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,428
He's a man of policies.

483
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,692
Why don't you do
something about him?

484
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,428
It would have been better
had he not come here.

485
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:02,495
Instead, he should have spent that
money on an insurance policy.

486
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,477
Satya..

487
00:44:56,326 --> 00:45:00,319
Do you have a good relation with
any servant from that house?

488
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:05,334
Yes, that day I gave Rs.1 0
to him as a tip.

489
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,168
Good. Tips is a..

490
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:15,843
Brother, get me some polish.

491
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,181
How much? - I think one
would be enough.

492
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,340
Why so much secrecy, brother?

493
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,407
Why suddenly? - I am thinking..
What's so mysterious about it?

494
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,475
Hello

495
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,718
Listen, rats have become
unbearable in my house

496
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:39,134
Do you have any solution for it?
What? Nitric acid copper..

497
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:49,144
..trinitrodite.. no, no..

498
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,804
I don't need all
those colorful smokes.

499
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,649
What's sister saying?

500
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,552
..what? Oh! That's splendid.

501
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:08,424
The Nobel Prize should go
to sister in law this time.

502
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:13,827
One..

503
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,831
..towel.

504
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:27,349
Cosmos

505
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,280
Whistling..

506
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,122
What? -Whistling

507
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,454
It's Whistling

508
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:07,220
The life has become dull, Uncle.
Let's take a break.

509
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,153
Keep practicing.

510
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,490
I am trying hard, but not been
able to master the Natraj posture

511
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,325
You aren't practicing with
your heart and soul.

512
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,231
This Natraj posture is
a big problem.

513
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,466
Who is it?

514
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,564
It's me, Lord.. Gurupad.

515
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,336
Please wait

516
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:42,248
I think I've interrupted your rest

517
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,344
Why would I need any rest at all?

518
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:51,191
Actually.. I have been anxious
for some days now..

519
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,521
Anxious for what?

520
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:59,199
Well...since you don't ask
for anything on your own..

521
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,202
..I mean, if you have any issue
with the food or anything

522
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,465
Oh! That's the matter

523
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,205
I mean.. are you getting
your food properly?

524
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:13,375
Gurupad, you have done everything
to your level best.

525
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,546
And I would never want you to
do more than what you can..

526
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,614
..afford to. And about the matter
related to food, am I going..

527
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:25,560
..to ask for a hippopotamus in
my dinner? I'd never do that.

528
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:31,497
Because I know that it's more
than what you can afford.

529
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,366
If you at least tell me how
the curry & all should be..

530
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,837
It should be delicious.

531
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,373
I have eaten a lot in the age
you refer to as Stone Age

532
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:38,499
That time I ate plenty.

533
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,167
You can't get that kind of food now

534
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:45,509
If you want to have something
of that kind.. I mean..

535
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,847
It would have been better had it
been something easily accessible

536
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,353
Or we can even search for a
hippopotamus, as now a days..

537
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,447
..almost everything is
available in the market.

538
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,186
Then please search for the same.

539
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,194
Please don't be worried.
I'll easily get it

540
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,790
Do you have any discomfitures?

541
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,800
Please don't make me
ashamed by asking me

542
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:11,205
I am nobody, a non-existent, too
humble, simple a creature..

543
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:15,711
I don't have any happiness
to be called as my own

544
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:20,876
In my Lord's happiness
rest my happiness

545
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:25,377
I got him in a fruit
market in Babylon

546
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,446
He was an infant at that time

547
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,219
I was a child at that time

548
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,226
Then does he too..?

549
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:36,493
I was buying watermelon from a
shop, when I realized that..

550
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:41,833
..someone was pulling an edge
of the shawl I was wearing

551
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:47,436
It was him.. and since then
he has been staying with me

552
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,842
How surprising!

553
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:53,679
But since he descends
from the demon clan..

554
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,914
..and he was a scorpion in his
last birth. That's why he is..

555
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,590
Okay, we would like
to take leave now..

556
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:11,800
Whenever you have any issues,
- I'll surely tell you

557
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,613
It's been a long time since
I had any good food

558
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,208
Will you please prepare a delicious
Mutton Biriyani dish?

559
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,151
So, is Lord Mahadev
sure for this time?

560
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,689
I have already announced it

561
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,159
Sure. This time Mahadev, then in
next Amavasya, it'll be Vishnu..

562
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:41,161
..then Jesus, followed by Buddha,
then Hanuman..

563
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,322
Why don't you prepare a list of
the same and hang it outside?

564
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,426
The problem is that the crowd
insists on coming in then

565
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,432
The house is small. So there
is no way other than rotation

566
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:54,671
I would like to make a request.
No young man or woman..

567
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,645
..should be allowed inside. The
guy that you talked to that day,

568
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:01,343
Satya! He is an idiot.
He is harmless

569
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:05,684
Please Uncle. Only middle-aged
people should be let to enter..

570
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:09,191
..who have feelings of devotion
in their minds & no brains.

571
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,348
Otherwise we are not going
to continue here

572
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,191
Stop. The age is also a
matter to be considered.

573
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,196
Actually, the basic point is..

574
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:19,199
The other day Bajpai promised a lot.

575
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:24,204
That he'll make it a hermitage,
with the cooling system fitted in

576
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:29,209
You seem to be very happy as then
you'll also have your share

577
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:33,139
Just don't forget about
my 1 0% commission

578
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:36,652
Does anyone forget one's
Uncle's brother?

579
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:02,904
A dinner of hippopotamus!!

580
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,512
Exactly at 7

581
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:12,351
But we have to be very careful.
A slightest mistake..

582
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,619
..on our part will spoil
the entire plan.

583
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:20,356
As soon as the clock strikes
7, we will start.

584
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:26,696
And what will Brother Nitai do?
Will he just listen to his talks?

585
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:34,340
Please be alert & stand by
the window - By the window?

586
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,468
Will you be able to act
as being terrified?

587
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:43,416
Why should I act? As soon as l
remember my wife, I will..

588
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,319
What about me? -You!

589
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:51,156
Why don't you think on your
own about your role?

590
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:55,162
One house, lots of people. There
is a fire.. and all will panic

591
00:53:55,332 --> 00:54:00,565
Think what you are going
to do there in the scene

592
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,762
Rescue! -Good!

593
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,171
Will I be able to settle the
matter this time itself

594
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,343
Yes, you can do it. - But if
she doesn't agree then?

595
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,675
Idiot. What do you mean
by not agreeing?

596
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,516
Good night!

597
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,919
Evening.
- How are you?

598
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,455
Excuse me, what's the incarnation
today? Vishnu?

599
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,464
No sir, its Shiva.

600
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,131
I had told you the same

601
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,141
Welcome
- Greetings Mr. Ganesh

602
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,305
What's there? -These are for Guruji

603
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,747
Will I surely get to see the
Godly appearance of Babaji

604
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:51,150
Please be rest assured, you'll
surely get to see it

605
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,310
You are right. -Right

606
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:58,225
Now please get in quickly, else
you'll have to stand in the queue.

607
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,828
If you wish, then you'll
be able to help me.

608
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,564
Really? - Really!

609
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:13,233
Ok, go ahead and take your seat,
else it'll get crowded over there.

610
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,245
Please come in

611
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,776
May I also.. with them..

612
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,316
Satya, the letter for the interview
hasn't reached yet

613
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:32,122
That is expected any day from now

614
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:37,198
And in case of any complicacies,
you can always count on me

615
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,292
That's right. Now go upstairs
and have your seat.

616
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,463
Please take a seat away
From the front.

617
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,803
Babaji does not agree with present

618
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:48,139
Even present generation.

619
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:53,475
Non-existent. Only Past
and Future. Isn't it?

620
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:10,826
Everybody hankers after money
and wealth in this world.

621
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:17,830
But they should always reach
only the right hands

622
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:23,176
The person should be eligible to
receive that wealth and money

623
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:28,681
Otherwise it may lead to destruction

624
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,118
And it leads to all the chaos

625
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:41,624
The wealth is not the main point.
The main point is the person..

626
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:47,603
..who has acquired it. This is
at the root of many a fights.

627
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,298
This has only led to my
differences with others

628
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,136
Do you know with whom?

629
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,811
Jesus!

630
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,484
Incredible!!!

631
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,160
Baba!

632
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:43,283
Jesus told me that the rich
never attains Heaven.

633
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:54,795
I asked him why. One should just
make the good use of his money

634
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,807
That day..

635
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:06,748
That day I said many harsh
words towards him

636
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:12,687
Later, I repented a lot.

637
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:21,323
Pity! What a death he had!!

638
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,245
Excuse me, Lord.

639
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,185
Who is it?

640
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,185
Please come closer. Please
let him pass through

641
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,850
Please speak up your mind

642
00:58:54,864 --> 00:59:00,200
Guruji.. I.. - I remembered
Manu after seeing you

643
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,702
Are you talking about
Manu Chatterji?

644
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,267
Manu Shaymbhu..

645
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,616
He came to me and told me,
' Please have a look on my work.'

646
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,718
I have worked really
hard to compose them

647
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:28,389
I can't do without your approval

648
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,163
I said, ok, let me see
what you have written

649
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,166
One lakh shlokas.

650
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,673
My goodness, what have you done?
Who has the time to..

651
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,906
..read all these? Shed them off

652
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:48,841
I chose 300 Slokas from his
composition, & told him..

653
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:53,446
Keep them, as they will be useful.
Shed off all the rest

654
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:54,512
Excuse me,

655
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,183
Let me tell you one more
incident about Manu

656
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:04,359
It was immediately after
the great destruction

657
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:10,200
One day Vaibaswat came
and told me,..

658
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:15,811
Man is created now. But where
will he stay, what will he eat?

659
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,869
As everywhere it's only water

660
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:23,885
Seeing this condition of the
harth hee was feeling scared

661
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,379
Seeing his state l
felt pity for him.

662
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,220
What's there to feel so
scared Vibhu, I asked

663
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:34,228
I am here, and the Sun science
is under my total control

664
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,322
I heated up the Sun more and more..

665
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,493
..and the water around dried up..

666
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:43,369
The Mother Earth emerged in
her full maturity & fruition.

667
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:47,341
Lord, did you know Jesus?

668
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:53,177
People say it was Crucification.

669
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,250
I say it's Crucifact.

670
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:59,253
Because I saw him crucified
right in front of me

671
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:03,348
My God! And Gautama Buddha?

672
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,521
Gautam.?!?

673
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:12,357
Gautam is the kid of a recent past.

674
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:16,369
I was already old when he was born.

675
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:56,342
Fire!!!
- Fire!!!

676
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,158
Hello, Fire Brigade..

677
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:04,335
Please leave me. There
is a fire around.

678
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:23,526
Now go away, never come back.

679
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,308
Where are you taking me to?
-To the main street.

680
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,412
Believe me please, this
is not a quotation

681
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,822
These words are purely mine.

682
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,217
What?

683
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,827
