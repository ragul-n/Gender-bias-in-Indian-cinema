1
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:11,507
Param, you are behaving as if
its Dussehra, on the day of Holi.

2
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,064
Are you doped?

3
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:18,312
The Hemp can slow done,
but I am permanently high now.

4
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,089
If you stare so much,

5
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:46,646
you will come down from the
category of a lover to a ruffian.

6
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,884
Hey, look.

7
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:52,939
Oh God I died.

8
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:58,945
Sister in law.

9
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:06,277
I have seen a horse raising
both his legs in the air.

10
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:09,175
First time I am seeing
a tractor flying in love.

11
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:28,205
Param, the next festival
after the rainy season,

12
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:30,086
is the festival of Raksha Bandhan.

13
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,761
Shut up.
- Think about it.

14
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:33,301
Be positive.

15
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,847
But buddy Gurpreet you are right.

16
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,316
Maybe I will keep staring
at the girls

17
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:40,502
during the festivals
and keep shying away.

18
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:42,036
And finally I will be ashamed
in my life.

19
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,128
Do one thing,
- What?

20
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,480
Get me married.

21
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,197
You can’t even love
and you want to marry.

22
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,573
I am not talking of my wedding
but of someone else’s.

23
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,783
You are aware in Punjab, love
happens during other’s weddings.

24
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:55,959
And in your own wedding,
others are scheming.

25
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:59,024
The girl is Jasmeet’s friend.

26
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,324
So the guy is ours.

27
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:02,996
So find out, who will sacrifice.
Find out.

28
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:06,540
No worries, I have a scheme.

29
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,153
Who will stop Gurpreet Singh
from sacrificing...

30
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,912
in this whole village? Tell me?

31
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:11,990
Correct.

32
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:30,231
No aunty, don’t,
I have already eaten 12 ice creams.

33
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,065
If I eat any more I will be frozen.

34
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,170
How is that son,

35
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,682
you are young and hot blooded,
if you eat even the ice will melt.

36
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,853
This is only ice cream. - No
I don’t want, my stomach is full.

37
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:42,249
You have eaten 12 ice creams?

38
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,516
And I have not even had one.

39
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,796
We had called 15 people
from his house.

40
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:49,885
He has come alone.
He deserves to eat the ice creams.

41
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:52,746
Aunty, feed her.
Assume I have eaten it.

42
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,048
No son, that’s not done.

43
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,351
She isn’t your wife.

44
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:59,274
That if she eats
and it will enter your body.

45
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,219
Ok, then feed his wife.

46
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:04,268
Stop.

47
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:06,819
I am not married.

48
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,982
Engaged?
- No I myself have stopped.

49
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:17,191
You must have had an affair.
- No.

50
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:21,242
But I had fallen in love.
Last Dussehra.

51
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:24,646
With the one,

52
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,228
whom you keep staring
at all the festivals?

53
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:30,353
The loafers stare,

54
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:33,595
the lovers, gaze.

55
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:40,835
It is not ringing in your dreams.

56
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,711
It’s coming from there.

57
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,602
Listen.
- Yes.

58
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,951
I am making an excuse
and going to bring ice creams.

59
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,327
It’s an excuse of returning late.

60
00:07:57,057 --> 00:08:00,196
So that you both can sit together
and converse.

61
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:03,008
No aunty, what are you saying?

62
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:04,935
Your heart must be happy.

63
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,686
If you are not interested,

64
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:10,337
go and eat ice cream
with your friends.

65
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,812
I am leaving my Stole here and going.

66
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,630
Hear it is.

67
00:08:21,513 --> 00:08:22,551
Ice cream.

68
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,946
Thank you aunty.

69
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,994
But son,
Param is playing with fire.

70
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:32,769
Jasmeet’s grandfather
is a very orthodox man.

71
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:34,828
If he comes to know,

72
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,164
he will get
the girl married elsewhere.

73
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,136
Greeting, blessings.
- Bless you.

74
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:41,962
It was very nice meeting you.

75
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,333
Any progress?

76
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:51,549
Half. 50%

77
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,612
Means?

78
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,609
From my side.

79
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,297
75%.

80
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,717
It has to be 100%.

81
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,410
"Gala celebration have begun,
so have lost all senses."

82
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,731
"Crazy guy, tell her about
your heart’s desires, today."

83
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:25,649
"Gala celebration have begun,
so have lost all senses."

84
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:30,742
"Crazy guy, tell her about
your heart’s desires, today."

85
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:35,892
You are colorful today,
with your flirty and sassy self.

86
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:41,587
"With wedding musical instruments
echoing in my heart."

87
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:09,141
"If I can’t see you all the time,
Then what is the use of the eyes."

88
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:14,365
"I am always thinking about you,
Whether its morning or night."

89
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:19,610
"You are Sohni, I am your Mahiwaal.
You are Heer, I am your Raanjha."

90
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:24,362
"We both are in our trance. Will
oppose the world in the evening."

91
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:29,994
"Let them grumble, if they want.
Now my days and my nights."

92
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:37,656
"Now my days and my nights.
Are singing new dreams."

93
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,231
"I am shocked and surprised."

94
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:42,742
"My words don’t make
any sense anymore."

95
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:47,863
"Now my days and my nights.
Singing new dreams."

96
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:50,430
"I am shocked and surprised."

97
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,380
"My words don’t make
any sense anymore."

98
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,060
Father is coming in 2 hours.
By then set it up.

99
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,416
Is this a movie?

100
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,208
Go down and guard the gate.

101
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,855
Jasmeet.

102
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,041
Should we inaugurate our love?

103
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:50,580
Yes.

104
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:53,930
But I have a condition.
- Condition?

105
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,198
I want to work after the wedding.

106
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,606
I am a Jewelry designer,
and want to keep doing it.

107
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:04,542
But grandfather and brother
will never allow this.

108
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,389
There is only one reason
for me to live.

109
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,914
That my husband
will be understanding

110
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,765
and will let me do
what my heart wants.

111
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,081
I have no right to make a decision.

112
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,291
But if I have the right
then the decision,

113
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:25,173
will be in your favor.

114
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,067
The girl can predict,

115
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:41,627
whether the boy has
passed or failed,

116
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,419
by the way the boy holds her hand.

117
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:46,415
What is my result?

118
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:55,748
You have ranked. First class first.

119
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:25,264
"Since I have gazed at you,
since then you are my addiction."

120
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:30,149
"Of your love, of your desire."

121
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:35,454
"Since I have gazed at you,
since then you are my addiction."

122
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:40,547
"Of your love, of your desire."

123
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:43,093
"I was roaming
like strong and brawny."

124
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:45,681
"Memorizing your name."

125
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:50,641
"Wearing the band of love."

126
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:56,571
"If the world is restless,
let them be."

127
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:03,928
"Now My days and my nights.
Are Singing new dreams."

128
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:06,488
"I am shocked and surprised."

129
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,000
"My words don’t make
any sense anymore."

130
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,112
"Now My days and my nights.
Are Singing new dreams."

131
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,751
"I am shocked and surprised."

132
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:20,280
"My words don’t make
any sense anymore."

133
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:35,900
Param, the danger of you
both getting caught is increasing.

134
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:37,451
Is it?
- Yes.

135
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:41,104
Then start thinking of new excuses
from tomorrow.

136
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:43,020
Done.

137
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:47,686
Hello.

138
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,083
Bless me grandfather,
I am Mitti speaking.

139
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,384
Bless you dear.

140
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,039
The boy is coming to meet me,

141
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:56,166
if you could send Jasmeet,
then my life would be easier.

142
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,314
Sure dear. Why not. Definitely.

143
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:06,221
Grandfather if Jasmeet
could help me in History...

144
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:07,296
Yes dear.

145
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:10,223
Grandfather,
if Jasmeet could teach me...

146
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:12,197
how to cook desert.
- Sure dear.

147
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,398
Grandfather,
the boy is coming to see me.

148
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:15,620
Again?

149
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:18,662
Sure dear.

150
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,792
Greetings, grandfather.

151
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,698
If Jasmeet could...

152
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:26,598
If Jasmeet could,
if she could teach me to stitch.

153
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:28,334
Yes, why not dear.

154
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,436
Grandfather, bless me,

155
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:32,996
send Jasmeet,
the boy is coming to meet me.

156
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:37,163
Why don’t you try fasting dear?
Or else this is go on forever.

157
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:39,107
Yes I will try that too.

158
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:41,512
Don’t you have any other excuse?

159
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:42,831
There are not so many boys
in Punjab,

160
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:43,899
the number of times
you have used this excuse.

161
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:44,974
Aren’t you ashamed?

162
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,728
Who will find
new excuses every day?

163
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:48,127
If it can be used, let it be.

164
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,178
Hurry, hurry up.

165
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,320
Sit down.

166
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:57,274
The gate is locked,
now nobody can come in.

167
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,492
Brother has to do for his brother.

168
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:02,514
Starters are not ready.

169
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,927
Get 2 cottage cheese pancakes.

170
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,644
Wow, my favorite.
Is it the sweet one?

171
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,278
Last time there was lot of salt.

172
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,305
Drink.

173
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:16,381
You are sad.

174
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:18,488
What happened?

175
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,175
Oh so my lover
has reached that stage

176
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,083
where he can x ray me
with his eyes.

177
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:29,123
What kind of lover is he,
if he can’t know her heart?

178
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:35,865
Come on, tell me.

179
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:41,461
After seeing my designs,

180
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:44,322
a jewelry designer from Amritsar
has called me.

181
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,014
For the job of a consultant.

182
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:48,330
Wow that’s amazing.

183
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:50,491
They are paying me well too.

184
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:54,299
Then why are you sad?
You should be happy.

185
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,395
I can’t understand girls.

186
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,603
You can’t understand girls

187
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,472
because girls are not supposed
to be understood.

188
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:03,338
It’s thrice in a week.

189
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,797
Grandfather and brother
have blankly refused.

190
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:12,151
Because I am a girl.
That’s why I am barred.

191
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,141
Sorry dear.

192
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:18,731
Grandfather and brother
are doing wrong by stopping me.

193
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,371
Then I too will cheat with them.

194
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,552
Will you drop me to Amritsar,
thrice a week?

195
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:27,009
It’s a matter of 3 days,

196
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,773
so will have 3 excuses to drop
and pick you from Amritsar.

197
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,949
Done.

198
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:43,385
Don’t hug me like this, girl.

199
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:48,229
You don’t know,
what all thoughts, run in my heart.

200
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,366
"Don’t stare at me that way,
I feel shy."

201
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:57,905
"Don’t come so close to me
that I get scared."

202
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,740
"Even if I wish,
how do I tell you?"

203
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,120
"If you stare,
my heart starts beating rapidly."

204
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:15,205
"If you come closer,
my hearts get more entangled."

205
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,955
"When drum rolls of love
are beating."

206
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:23,507
"Then balloons are popping
in my heart."

207
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:28,285
"Body is dancing, head is swaying."

208
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:31,141
"When drum rolls of love
are beating."

209
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,715
"Then balloons are popping
in my heart."

210
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:38,497
"Body is dancing, head is swaying."

211
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,431
"You have dissolved
the spell of love,"

212
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,883
"I am with my arms open."

213
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:48,987
"My beating heart
is yearning for you to come."

214
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:54,634
"If your heart is hesitant,
then let it be."

215
00:18:56,357 --> 00:19:02,212
"Now My days and my nights.
Are singing new songs."

216
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:04,793
"I am shocked and surprised."

217
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:07,317
"My words don’t make
any sense anymore."

218
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:12,470
"Now My days and my nights.
Are singing new songs."

219
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,980
"I am shocked and surprised."

220
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,880
"My words don’t make
any sense anymore."

221
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:35,179
"Gala celebration have begun,
so have lost all senses."

222
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:40,351
"Crazy guy, tell her about
your heart’s desires, today."

223
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:45,417
"Gala celebration have begun,
so have lost all senses."

224
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:50,825
"Crazy guy, tell her about
your heart’s desires, today."

225
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,341
Param Statue.

226
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,827
Such expensive, glares?

227
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:08,946
You spent your whole salary
on this or what?

228
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:11,625
It’s my salary,
I can spend on whoever I want.

229
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:14,227
Now, what is this?

230
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,976
New clothes for you. Wear it.

231
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:17,781
Have you started taking loans?

232
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,498
No, this is from my bonus.

233
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:34,258
Hey sonny.

234
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,295
Yes, father.
- Hey son.

235
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:39,035
You have been wearing this
since a week.

236
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:40,567
Take it out.

237
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:43,916
Or the municipality guys
will throw you out.

238
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,396
Greetings grandfather.

239
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:58,816
Send Jasmeet,
the boy is coming for alliance.

240
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,163
Do boys come every day to meet you?

241
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:03,211
Not every day, thrice a week.

242
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,281
Has your father fixed this,

243
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:06,693
or is it written outside
your house,

244
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,256
meet the girl on this day only.

245
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,926
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, is good.

246
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:14,565
Have I ever called you on Saturday
Sunday, or Tuesday Thursday?

247
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:17,159
That is true, okay, best of luck.

248
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,184
Keep the phone away sometimes dear,
everyone has equal share on it.

249
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,728
Greetings Grandfather,
its baby shower.

250
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,118
Congratulations dear.

251
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,415
Greetings grandfather.

252
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:31,138
The other girls are having
their baby showers.

253
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:32,896
You are still stuck
with the boys alliances.

254
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,017
What’s the matter?

255
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:54,209
Lala.
- Yes.

256
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,544
What happened?
- What happened?

257
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:58,359
What about Mitti?

258
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,163
What happened to Mitti?

259
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,089
Did Mitti’s alliance work out?

260
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:04,432
What was supposed to happen
to Mitti?

261
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:06,856
Since 6 months, every week,

262
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:10,554
she is meeting boys thrice,
so at least 72 boys have seen her.

263
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:12,187
Then what happened?
- Listen,

264
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:14,694
you may be big built.

265
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:18,253
But I too have grown up
watching wrestlers.

266
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:19,742
Don’t talk nonsense.

267
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:22,348
I was just enquiring,

268
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:26,334
you have seen so many boys,
and then do you like any of them?

269
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:28,183
What are you talking?

270
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:31,062
Mitti’s wedding
has been fixed a year ago.

271
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,733
With Amarnath’s son, Kapil.

272
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:34,737
Who told you all this?

273
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:41,101
You are working behind our backs?

274
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:44,765
You are travelling
to Amritsar alone.

275
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,528
What is so wrong in working,
grandfather?

276
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:51,146
It is wrong to go against
our wishes.

277
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,867
Why is there so much disparity
between brother and me?

278
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,374
It’s a man’s duty to feed a woman.

279
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,902
And a woman’s duty is
to give birth to his children,

280
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:03,331
and take care of them.

281
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:05,660
That is the difference.

282
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,963
Find a groom for her.

283
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:18,956
Jasmeet, everything will be fine.

284
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:22,493
The iron is hot now, strike it.

285
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,898
Even if the house changes,

286
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,979
the fate of the girls
doesn’t change.

287
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:30,995
Chill. Once you come to my house.

288
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,542
Then how does his rule
and regulations matter?

289
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:40,405
Please eat.

290
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:48,203
What was the need
of writing a letter?

291
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:49,719
You could have just told.

292
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:52,099
For the first time, I am talking
about the marriage proposal,

293
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:54,468
so was hesitant.
Won’t do it next time.

294
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:57,924
What nonsense I am talking.

295
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:00,663
If I meet Jasmeet’s grandfather
for you marriage proposal then...

296
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:02,133
What will I get?

297
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,235
You will have to spend now,

298
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,867
after 5 years a granddaughter
or son.

299
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:09,057
I am not asking for any investment
scheme, but grandchildren.

300
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,515
Five years?

301
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,458
Gave 3.
- No 4.

302
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:13,886
Done deal at 3 and half.

303
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:15,319
Done.
- Done.

304
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,188
Congratulations.

305
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:39,799
Congratulations

306
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,861
Daughter Jasmeet, Come dear.

307
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,148
Jasmeet is going to become
the daughter in law of your family.

308
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,550
But I have one condition.

309
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,153
Food, and clothes,
will be according to your wishes.

310
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,435
But you have to promise one thing.

311
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,305
But after the wedding,
Jasmeet will not go out to work.

312
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:38,999
The world is changing.
Then its Jasmeet’s wish.

313
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:41,634
There is no limit
for wishes and desires.

314
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,506
But it’s about our society.

315
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:45,644
The world is changing,

316
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:47,648
then why hasn’t
the society changed.

317
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:49,669
I am elder than you.

318
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:52,397
Then too I am folding my hands
and requesting you.

319
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:55,143
No sir, you are elder,
don’t do this.

320
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,153
Then promise.

321
00:25:59,121 --> 00:25:59,946
Promise.

322
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,474
Sorry, girl.

323
00:26:21,168 --> 00:26:23,631
I know how much you wanted to work.

324
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:29,414
It’s not about working,
or doing a job.

325
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,649
It’s about having the independence
of making your own decision.

326
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:39,121
Which I never had, nor ever will.

327
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:43,743
Forget it Jasmeet,
everything will be fine.

328
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,615
Nothing will ever be fine.

329
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:49,417
You are a man,

330
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:52,540
you will not understand.

331
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,800
I don’t understand your desire
to live independently?

332
00:26:58,054 --> 00:27:00,939
Father respected your grandfather
and promised him.

333
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:03,767
If you want,

334
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,309
I can still break this relation.

335
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:12,810
I dream,

336
00:27:13,768 --> 00:27:14,992
but I am not mad.

337
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:23,201
I had 2 dreams,

338
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:29,439
one to live my life
on my own terms.

339
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:34,881
And other to marry you.

340
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:39,657
The first one
will not be fulfilled. - Hey.

341
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:42,355
Let me complete the second wish.

342
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,737
Okay, so where will you take me
for our honey moon?

343
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:56,546
Honey moon will begin here.

344
00:27:57,448 --> 00:28:00,442
Because you know,
when you hug me like this,

345
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:05,257
then what all kinds of thoughts run
in my heart. Girl.

346
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:07,843
Param.
- Jasmeet.

347
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:20,454
Greetings.

348
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:24,092
God bless, son.

349
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:25,487
Everything is alright.

350
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,271
Welcome dear.

351
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,600
You have become a stranger
after getting my sister in law.

352
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:34,261
We don’t get to see you.

353
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:37,427
She wants to go to Switzerland
for honey moon.

354
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:41,241
Switzerland.
Means setting is final.

355
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,748
Wow, congratulations.

356
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,912
Hey, get a beer.

357
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,849
No, beer.
- Why?

358
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:50,394
It’s not finalized.
Where is the visa?

359
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:53,888
All the property, papers, income,
is in father’s name.

360
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:55,847
Then I can’t get the visa.
How will I go?

361
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,587
Why are you tensed,
when Gurpreet is around?

362
00:28:58,677 --> 00:28:59,754
It’s a shame then.

363
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:02,356
Listen, you give all the documents.

364
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:05,573
I will gift you the honey moon visa
on your wedding.

365
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,003
When will father help?
You don’t worry.

366
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:09,697
You have a beer. Bring the beer.

367
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:47,364
"Gala celebration have begun,
so have lost all senses."

368
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:52,462
"Crazy guy, tell her about
your heart’s desires, today."

369
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:57,590
"Gala celebration have begun,
so have lost all senses."

370
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,966
"Crazy guy, tell her about
your heart’s desires, today."

371
00:30:06,664 --> 00:30:08,568
Make a large one for me.

372
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:24,392
Did you make a large peg?

373
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:26,738
It is so diluted.

374
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,137
Son, are you in your senses?

375
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,942
I have never touched it,
and you sprayed it on me.

376
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:40,729
The enlightened one,
impart your knowledge elsewhere.

377
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:44,759
It only fell on  your clothes,
not down your throat.

378
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:48,245
Fell on my clothes. Rubbish.

379
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,371
Param.

380
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:51,626
Apologize.

381
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:54,748
It's okay, son. He has no manners.

382
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,691
He is your friend, he is our guest.

383
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:57,986
Let it be.

384
00:30:58,141 --> 00:30:59,657
I will forgive the guest.

385
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,039
But how can I forgive my friend.
- Param.

386
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,175
He has to apologize. Shut up.
- Param.

387
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:06,980
He has to make it right.

388
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,005
Apologize.
- Param, leave me.

389
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:10,422
Say sorry.

390
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:12,222
Param, let me go.

391
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:14,746
Param let it be.
- Param, let me go.

392
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,021
Param, let me go.

393
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:25,301
Param, you have insulted me
in front of everyone.

394
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:28,091
It’s okay.

395
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:32,054
You have exploited me a lot
in friendship.

396
00:31:33,128 --> 00:31:35,237
Now you will come to know about
the losses due to enmity with me.

397
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:39,023
You are in a mood of going to
Switzerland for your honeymoon.

398
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,756
I will not allow your Visa
to be passed.

399
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:47,078
And if you get your Visa,

400
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:50,214
deal with me.

401
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:51,505
Get lost.

402
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:53,941
I will not get your visa done.

403
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:56,676
Watch now.

404
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:21,994
'Thank you.'

405
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:26,031
'Your lunch. My lunch, check.'

406
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,561
'Phone check.'

407
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:31,429
'Glares check.'

408
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,827
'Okay, I am leaving. Bye.'

409
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,211
'Keys check.'

410
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,298
'You can drive without the keys?'

411
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,472
'Why do I have the feeling that'

412
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,636
'I am not going to get
this key back for free?'

413
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,017
'Because the Jat,
has a bad character.'

414
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:51,561
'And he will not give anything
for free.'

415
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,285
'Now, I am getting very late.'

416
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,757
'Come.'

417
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,270
'Come.'

418
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,511
'Take it.'

419
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,735
'Leave me. Leave.'

420
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,409
'Leave me.'

421
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:10,136
Leave me.

422
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:13,401
Leave.

423
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,929
Girl.
- Yes.

424
00:33:16,322 --> 00:33:18,021
Return back from abroad.

425
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:28,571
Gurpreet Singh has cancelled
so many times that,

426
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:32,568
I have no other option
to go abroad, except in my dreams.

427
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:35,546
But you have a good scheme
to go abroad.

428
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:38,454
Cheap, pretty and long lasting.

429
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:42,257
I get depressed every morning.

430
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:46,270
Today don’t get depressed,
but impressed.

431
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:49,308
Have to meet grandfather today,
have to go to your house.

432
00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:52,447
Yes that it is.

433
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:57,147
So we have another chance
to talk about the job.

434
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:01,111
Lovely, my life is made.

435
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:05,274
No, life is yet to be set.

436
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:09,885
You know, my character is bad.

437
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:12,032
Nothing is free.

438
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:14,638
Get started. Please start.

439
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:18,014
Don’t be shy.
- Leave.

440
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,638
You haven’t even brushed.

441
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:27,585
After one year of the wedding
you are talking of brushing.

442
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:30,126
After 3 years
you will talk of bathing.

443
00:34:30,824 --> 00:34:32,202
You talk a lot.

444
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:35,345
Then seal my lips.

445
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,274
Why do you make
your lover chase you?

446
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:56,468
If you don’t make
your guy chase you,

447
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:58,367
then he will chase someone else.

448
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:02,483
You can make me run here
or there, this lover

449
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:05,870
will always be behind you.

450
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,170
Today,
convince grandfather for my job.

451
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:13,605
Such a petty request,
I can kill for this.

452
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,061
Murder.

453
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:20,868
Son it’s been a year
since you are married.

454
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:26,486
I want my grandchildren voice
to echo in this house now.

455
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:30,853
Unlike the working women.

456
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,136
Who for years are
after their career?

457
00:35:34,363 --> 00:35:37,685
Then keep visiting various doctors.
And ask for help.

458
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,043
Do you understand?

459
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:51,434
Hello.
- Param.

460
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:54,263
Have to take Bhavri
for an injection.

461
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:56,572
Okay father.

462
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:06,336
Make her also sit behind.

463
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:09,618
It’s good if she walks a bit,
she has put on a lot of weight.

464
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:10,853
Bull  will divorce her.

465
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:17,716
Jasmeet. Jasmeet.

466
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:19,409
Harpreet.

467
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:21,595
Who is she?

468
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:24,761
Harpreet, she was studying with me
in high school.

469
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:28,337
She failed in 8 th grade
so she never came back to school.

470
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,061
She had never travelled
outside Amritsar.

471
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:32,760
She is married in London.

472
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,427
Hi Jas.

473
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:42,053
We are very, very sweet yo.

474
00:36:43,913 --> 00:36:46,955
You are so cute, totally.

475
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:48,938
How are you?
When did you come from London?

476
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:50,283
How is Sukhwinder?

477
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,840
Busy, busy, busy. You know.
He doesn’t get a leave.

478
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:54,767
He is at a high post,
so has severe headaches too.

479
00:36:54,857 --> 00:36:57,451
But I told him, hello, excuse me.

480
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:01,569
It’s been 5 years. I am going
to India, at times I miss a lot.

481
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:04,804
I get so nostalgic sometimes Jas.
- I know.

482
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:05,894
Oh, so it’s only been 5 years,

483
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:07,964
since you have shifted to London?
- Yes.

484
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:09,740
After listening
to your fluent English

485
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,035
I thought you were born there.

486
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,949
This is my husband. Param.

487
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,704
Hi.
- Hello.

488
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,557
He jokes a lot.

489
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,342
I am not a jockey, I am a farmer.

490
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,423
I have done M.Sc.,
in agriculture sciences.

491
00:37:23,513 --> 00:37:26,966
I meant you are very humorous.
Funny.

492
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:28,579
That’s why I cracked this joke.

493
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:35,611
So what does your husband do
at London?

494
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:37,657
At London’s Heathrow airport.

495
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:40,516
He has the responsibility
of keeping the airport,

496
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:41,919
ecofriendly
on his strong shoulders.

497
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,004
Wow.

498
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,545
Come home along with me,
we will catch up over a cold drink.

499
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:48,438
Okay, you go.
Catch up over a cold drink.

500
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:49,674
I will get her injected.

501
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:51,407
Injection? Is everything alright?

502
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:52,567
Yes, everything is good.

503
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:53,795
You, see this buffalo,
she is preggers,

504
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:55,801
so I am just going to take her
for a shot. Nothing else.

505
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:58,989
Wow, you speak English so well.

506
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,880
You should be in London.

507
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,089
You are wasting your talent
by giving shots to the buffaloes.

508
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:05,121
Frankly I am telling you.

509
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:06,444
Okay, let’s go.

510
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,304
It was good meeting you.
- Same here.

511
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:13,055
I was sweating in this heat.

512
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:16,385
If you are healthier than me,

513
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,816
but to go out here,
have to wear 8 meter cloth.

514
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:21,273
You know what I mean. Really,

515
00:38:21,406 --> 00:38:23,286
in London,
I can just go like this...

516
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:26,393
And whoever I meet, Indian
or others, hello, hi, greetings.

517
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:27,580
And will leave.

518
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,116
But here if I leave,

519
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,511
then there will be my MMS made
called, fun sister in law.

520
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:33,982
Do you remember Chutki?

521
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,931
How had a faint moustache?

522
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,686
Yes moustache suits her.

523
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:42,728
She is the hero of the house.

524
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:46,026
After having 2 kids,
she went to college.

525
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:47,842
And now she is a lawyer for women.

526
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:50,578
You too has reached heights,
Harpreet.

527
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:52,437
Yes, look at me.

528
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:56,298
I am no longer a village belle,
I mean I have worked on myself.

529
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:58,522
I went to a night school,
did a course of a beautician.

530
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:00,218
Taught myself English.

531
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:06,094
Means bank account, kids,
I can manage all kinds of work.

532
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:07,738
It’s great.

533
00:39:08,035 --> 00:39:10,346
But you tell me,

534
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:12,272
first class first.

535
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:15,509
You had showed us the dream
to prove ourselves.

536
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,342
We are conquering forts.

537
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:22,204
And you have become a housewife and
giving injection to the buffaloes.

538
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,077
What do you think?

539
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:27,660
Did I not see the dream
of doing something?

540
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,213
But you are also aware,

541
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,996
there here girls don’t have
any freedom to do anything.

542
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,599
Yes I know.

543
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:38,481
That’s why girls like me marry
and run away from here.

544
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,135
Dreams like ours can
only be fulfilled by going there.

545
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:45,392
My dream will never be fulfilled.

546
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:48,213
The reason is Gurpreet Singh Karon.

547
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:52,287
He was rude to my father
during the wedding.

548
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:53,992
Param raised his hands on him.

549
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:55,865
Param did the right thing,

550
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:59,296
but Gurpreet is very influential.

551
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:01,692
After a lot of effort also,

552
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:03,756
Param is unable to get the visa.

553
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:07,299
I have a solution to your problem.

554
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:18,642
Gurnaam Singh Visa.

555
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,016
But will your hero,
take the illegal path?

556
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:33,978
Look.

557
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:35,563
Where do I see?

558
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:40,673
Should I write the property
in your name on this paper?

559
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,737
Please see carefully. Get up.

560
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:47,346
I have seen you very carefully.

561
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,390
Look, for a minute.

562
00:40:49,536 --> 00:40:52,321
Harpreet has given,
the number of Gurnaam Singh.

563
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:55,512
This can help us in settling
in England.

564
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:59,001
So today’s idea of the
wedding night was of Harpreet’s.

565
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:02,278
You keeps doing this
to your innocent husband.

566
00:41:04,036 --> 00:41:05,749
Idea was of Harpreet,

567
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:08,357
@but it was my wish.

568
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,842
You have looted me by emotions,
come my girl.

569
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:15,436
Please not now. Listen to me.

570
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:18,314
I am sure after seeing Harpreet.

571
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:21,728
After going to London
all out troubles will end.

572
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:24,238
Okay.

573
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:28,196
But have to talk to father.

574
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,700
I will not go anywhere
without his permission.

575
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:37,954
Yes.

576
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,970
Carefully.

577
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:45,057
Father.

578
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,567
Yes.

579
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,821
I wanted to talk to you.

580
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:50,365
Speak son.

581
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,363
Father I...

582
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:57,029
Father I mean...

583
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,087
Father,
Param is unable to tell you that,

584
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:00,602
he wants to settle down in London.

585
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,465
Half of Punjab is settled there,
son.

586
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:08,426
You also go there.

587
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,230
Father,
you are happy with my decision?

588
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,826
Look son,

589
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:18,916
when I had a heart attack.

590
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,341
Then you were into the fields
like the bulls.

591
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:27,062
After studying so much at Amritsar.

592
00:42:27,152 --> 00:42:30,282
You never wished to stay
in the city.

593
00:42:31,556 --> 00:42:33,991
You have given 5 years
to the family.

594
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:35,727
That is...

595
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:40,381
Now it’s the time for your family.

596
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:43,250
I will call you
as soon as I get settled.

597
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:46,991
You have to teach my children too.

598
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:52,956
I will come and teach that,

599
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:58,479
like my son is,
they too have to be like that.

600
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,090
Be like him.

601
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:03,397
Yes, father.

602
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:27,352
Take this.

603
00:43:27,442 --> 00:43:29,149
Look after, I will be back.

604
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,546
Where?
- Over there.

605
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:02,638
Enough.

606
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:04,791
Enough of it dear.

607
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:07,758
Enough.

608
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:14,927
You are a big star.

609
00:44:16,145 --> 00:44:18,493
When you will sing
and the world will hear.

610
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:21,018
Then they will forget
Wadali brothers.

611
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:24,611
Wadali brothers are 2, he is alone.

612
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:30,868
If he calls himself as both,
then he will be called a star.

613
00:44:32,707 --> 00:44:34,377
Darling what are you seeing,

614
00:44:34,585 --> 00:44:37,104
bring snacks and drinks,
for the star.

615
00:44:37,663 --> 00:44:40,336
And listen.
Don’t put ice in the butter milk.

616
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:43,226
Star’s voice is a gold mine.

617
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,657
If he will ice there will a flood.

618
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:47,676
Yes.

619
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,950
Okay darling go
to the next room, fill up the form.

620
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:56,283
Have you got money from father?
Deposit it.

621
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:59,166
Don’t go without
drinking the butter milk.

622
00:45:03,686 --> 00:45:05,315
Good morning.

623
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:07,339
Don’t worry darling,

624
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:11,514
not only visa, I will send you
to America without passport too.

625
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:14,185
Okay,
don’t want to say, then 4 months

626
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:16,638
Look darling,

627
00:45:17,295 --> 00:45:20,119
he is being tensed, even after
being a client of Gurnaam Singh.

628
00:45:20,438 --> 00:45:22,369
Is it the first time that
I am sending anyone overseas,

629
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:24,092
without the passport.

630
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,929
Bro, he isn’t tensed about going,

631
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:30,200
but returning back
after being caught.

632
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:32,931
Darling, some people do get caught.

633
00:45:33,073 --> 00:45:35,207
But so does an aircraft crashes
ever year.

634
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:36,561
Does that mean that

635
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,014
people get scared and stop sitting
in the plane.

636
00:45:40,263 --> 00:45:42,991
Sir, you give very good examples.

637
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:46,086
You give good examples,
or give Visa too.

638
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:49,663
Who are you?

639
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:51,908
Who is he?

640
00:45:52,372 --> 00:45:53,776
Do you have an appointment
or disappointment?

641
00:45:53,866 --> 00:45:57,428
I will be disappointed if you
don’t get the England done for me.

642
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,169
Harpreet said, you will surely
make me reach England.

643
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:03,716
Param Singh,
who never gets his visa?

644
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,935
Listen,
for young Punjabis to get visa

645
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:10,213
is as difficult as terrorist
getting heaven.

646
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,228
But darling, you don’t worry.

647
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:15,075
I will make you reach your heaven.

648
00:46:15,287 --> 00:46:17,572
Can’t I go alive, with a visa.

649
00:46:18,316 --> 00:46:21,557
Darling Gurpreet Singh Karon,
is not giving you the visa.

650
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,320
And I will not let you stay
in India.

651
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,826
Father will not let me go by,
trafficking.

652
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:29,319
Darling you are grown up,

653
00:46:29,483 --> 00:46:30,807
and still you are still scared
of your father.

654
00:46:30,897 --> 00:46:32,440
I was never scared of him,
even in my childhood.

655
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:34,862
But I respect him from childhood.

656
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:43,966
You have won my heart.

657
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:46,747
And along with it visa too.

658
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:49,896
So much respect for parents.

659
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:57,082
Look.

660
00:46:57,884 --> 00:46:59,128
Oh your parents.

661
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:00,165
No, darling.

662
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:03,623
This is Yashpal Singh
in front of the rickshaw.

663
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:07,635
Same to same Yashpal
is standing next to BMW.

664
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:10,375
And to make him stand next to a BMW

665
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:12,602
is London’s lady Maya.

666
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:15,778
She had mercy on him,
got married to him.

667
00:47:15,868 --> 00:47:17,513
And took him to London
and went away.

668
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,848
Darling this is the only way.

669
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:27,925
Darling go to London and laugh.

670
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,674
You have started laughing here,
itself.

671
00:47:32,026 --> 00:47:35,396
Gurnaam bro,
you have done it without the visa.

672
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,402
I just can’t stop laughing.

673
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,163
I was going to bash him.

674
00:47:43,395 --> 00:47:44,387
Then I remembered,

675
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:46,972
already Gurpreet has taken away
all our visas.

676
00:47:47,356 --> 00:47:48,587
If I hit him,

677
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:50,566
I will not even be able to go
to Bangladesh in my life.

678
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:52,240
But what did he say?

679
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,998
I can’t even repeat it. Let it be.

680
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:55,269
If you were there and heard it,

681
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,695
you would have murdered him,
Jasmeet.

682
00:47:56,965 --> 00:47:58,564
But what did he say?

683
00:47:58,654 --> 00:47:59,808
He said darling.

684
00:47:59,898 --> 00:48:01,508
No need to be romantic.

685
00:48:01,806 --> 00:48:04,046
He said darling.
- Oh.

686
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:05,717
He calls everyone darling.

687
00:48:06,244 --> 00:48:08,441
He said you marry a girl
from London.

688
00:48:08,879 --> 00:48:10,579
She will get you a visa. Take you
along with her for some time.

689
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:12,637
You will get residency
after a few days. Then divorce her.

690
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,688
Then come back here and
get married to Jasmeet again

691
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,375
and then go back to London.

692
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:18,713
He said this.

693
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:29,707
Jasmeet there is
no use of getting angry.

694
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:31,408
Listen to me, leave it.

695
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:32,551
Please.

696
00:48:34,105 --> 00:48:35,464
Leave it. Please.

697
00:48:36,403 --> 00:48:38,847
Brother, Gurnaam.

698
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:42,244
Param Singh has come with his wife.

699
00:48:42,648 --> 00:48:43,657
Should I increase your security?

700
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:47,116
My security is in my head.

701
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:48,529
Let them come.

702
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:55,113
Sister in law. Greetings.

703
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,501
I know you are very upset with me.

704
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:01,123
Anyone will flare up,
since when I have constrained her.

705
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:04,798
Sister in law,
your husband is very handsome.

706
00:49:05,427 --> 00:49:07,773
And handsome men are very foolish.

707
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,350
I want to explain to you.

708
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,369
This is only... - That this will
only be acting. I understand.

709
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:16,858
You are not at all handsome.

710
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:18,527
So I thought
you will be intelligent.

711
00:49:19,077 --> 00:49:20,375
And if you are smart,

712
00:49:20,538 --> 00:49:21,769
then I could not understand

713
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:23,735
why you were unable
to make him understand.

714
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:27,403
I was so stupid, I was not
able to understand your reaction.

715
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:29,453
Sister in law, I did not know,

716
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:32,344
that before explaining to you,
I have to explain him.

717
00:49:32,459 --> 00:49:33,933
Or else I would have
explained earlier.

718
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,966
Happy, sister in law is looking.

719
00:49:37,237 --> 00:49:39,125
Bring sweet
on this joyous occasion.

720
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:40,924
Sweets for what?
No need of any sweet.

721
00:49:41,118 --> 00:49:43,714
Sit. Sit down.

722
00:49:44,195 --> 00:49:46,144
Why are you sitting?
- Please be seated.

723
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,164
Hey, Jasmeet.

724
00:49:48,254 --> 00:49:51,807
Darling, you must be
watching movies. - I do, so.

725
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:56,089
So when Shahrukh acts like
the husband of Deepika.

726
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,583
Then he doesn’t cry or blabber
in front of the director.

727
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:03,468
Director sir,
I am married to Gauri.

728
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:05,849
How can I marry someone else?

729
00:50:05,987 --> 00:50:09,845
I cannot do acting of love
and marriage. I can’t do.

730
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:12,048
But who will be the director there?

731
00:50:12,204 --> 00:50:13,776
There will only be the lady and me.

732
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:17,955
And Gauri too never
gets suspicious of Shahrukh.

733
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,366
Because she knows, that Shahrukh
is just acting for her and kids.

734
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:25,755
Sister in law,
you explain much better than me.

735
00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:29,098
You get it,
you have to become Shahrukh.

736
00:50:29,188 --> 00:50:30,780
But Shahrukh is acting,

737
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,386
not going to a government office
and marrying

738
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:33,277
in the morning with Deepika,

739
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,505
then divorcing her and night
and marrying Gauri again.

740
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:36,810
What are you saying?

741
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,560
Your role is lengthier and
better than Shahrukh, darling.

742
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,986
This is a moment of happiness.

743
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,400
Darling get inspired by Shahrukh.

744
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:47,464
Don’t focus on the time
but on acting.

745
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:49,364
What if I get more inspired.

746
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,706
What if the naughty man inside me
gets instigated?

747
00:50:51,796 --> 00:50:53,808
What if the lady
starts over acting?

748
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:57,475
Darling I will manage the lady.

749
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,460
But sister in law, if the actor
doesn’t have faith on his acting.

750
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,232
Then what can I do?

751
00:51:03,322 --> 00:51:04,671
What rubbish.

752
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:05,954
I am saying with right means,

753
00:51:06,044 --> 00:51:08,469
neither can you go to London
nor to Tata.

754
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:17,165
Don’t scare me.

755
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:20,552
If you want to get angry on me,
then do it.

756
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,204
I will slap you.

757
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,670
Have you gone mad?
Have you lost it?

758
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:27,278
What nonsense
were you saying there?

759
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:28,863
I will get married to another woman
and go away

760
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:29,895
and it won’t affect you?

761
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:33,105
It is not a real wedding.
It’s just a compromise.

762
00:51:33,729 --> 00:51:37,492
After compromising so much in life,
it has stopped effecting me.

763
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:40,427
After all this, once we go there,

764
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,105
all compromises
will come to an end.

765
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:43,632
Please understand.

766
00:51:45,129 --> 00:51:48,029
You want to play such a gamble
for your independence in life.

767
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,549
Not only me, but any girl
who is living my life will agree.

768
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:57,424
They don’t even have a chance
to live their life.

769
00:51:58,337 --> 00:52:01,697
I have, and the reason is you.

770
00:52:04,176 --> 00:52:06,859
Param,
I trust you more than my own self.

771
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,201
I can make a mistake,
but you will not.

772
00:52:12,374 --> 00:52:14,668
Jasmeet it does not matter
where we stay.

773
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,512
With whom we stay
and how much they love me.

774
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:20,867
That makes the difference.

775
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,825
Give me my independence here,
I will not go.

776
00:52:25,888 --> 00:52:28,204
Is it so wrong to dream?

777
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,728
There is no harm in dreaming.

778
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,586
To fulfill it in the wrong way is.

779
00:52:36,228 --> 00:52:38,647
By doing this,
you are gambling your marriage.

780
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:42,959
But I cannot do this.

781
00:52:59,248 --> 00:53:01,068
Param, come.

782
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,053
Today you thought of me
after your wedding?

783
00:53:04,194 --> 00:53:05,722
Come dear.
- Gurpreet,

784
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:09,253
I have come to apologize.

785
00:53:11,077 --> 00:53:12,645
If you want I will apologize

786
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,962
in front of the whole village.

787
00:53:16,223 --> 00:53:18,220
No need to say sorry bro.

788
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:20,690
You are my friend. I forgive you.

789
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:24,632
Thank you.

790
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:26,213
But...

791
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:32,053
on whose legs you had made me fall,

792
00:53:33,332 --> 00:53:34,829
Let him bow down to my legs.

793
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:36,520
Then it is equal.

794
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:52,894
Sister in law.

795
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:57,425
I was tensed searching for you.

796
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:00,573
What are you thinking, come sit?

797
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:02,485
I will drop you till London.

798
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:06,643
Sister in law, I will send you
to London on a work visa.

799
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:08,051
Come.

800
00:54:08,268 --> 00:54:09,791
Param.

801
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,471
The trouble has come.
- Param.

802
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:13,553
What happened?

803
00:54:13,643 --> 00:54:15,599
You will not believe what happened.

804
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:16,741
I will, tell me.

805
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:20,513
I got a job in London.

806
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:23,405
And you will go?

807
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:26,321
Leaving me.

808
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,142
Alone.

809
00:54:29,585 --> 00:54:31,568
But we had spoken about this.

810
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:35,106
We had decided.

811
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:50,846
But you had promised,
that she will not do a job.

812
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:55,742
Grandfather,
she is just going on a work visa.

813
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,559
She will stay at my friends place
and enjoy her holiday.

814
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,347
Gurpreet should hear this.

815
00:55:01,595 --> 00:55:04,056
Then he will say that,
he is making his wife overseas.

816
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,567
He will spoil
my reputation much more.

817
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:07,631
He will forget.
But what will happen by then.

818
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,721
My friend will somehow
get a residency for Jasmeet.

819
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,110
Once I get the visa for residency.
No law can separate a couple.

820
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:18,576
Jaspreet will call me there.
And Gurpreet cannot do anything.

821
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:20,946
It’s a plan.

822
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:26,550
Can anyone stop me now?

823
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,507
Mad girl, stop. Listen.

824
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:40,609
"You tell me, who are you of mine?"

825
00:55:40,894 --> 00:55:46,589
"Since when you are staying
in my heart. Who knows?"

826
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:52,261
"Why do I feel? That without you."

827
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,086
"My life will not get happiness
even for a moment."

828
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:03,735
"I got to know you,
then I came to know."

829
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:09,748
"That I am truly alive."

830
00:56:09,979 --> 00:56:15,491
"Only for you."

831
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:21,256
"Every moment I live,
only for you."

832
00:56:21,665 --> 00:56:27,301
"For you, only for you."

833
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:33,490
"Every moment I live,
only for you."

834
00:56:51,351 --> 00:56:52,785
What are you watching?

835
00:56:54,066 --> 00:56:55,544
West minister abbey?

836
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:57,502
Can I tell you something?

837
00:56:57,592 --> 00:56:58,893
When I see this place,

838
00:56:59,158 --> 00:57:01,567
I feel like going to London
and watching this place.

839
00:57:01,657 --> 00:57:02,785
By God.

840
00:57:03,476 --> 00:57:06,620
Seeing the place or watching Kate?

841
00:57:07,355 --> 00:57:08,830
She is nothing compared to you.

842
00:57:09,348 --> 00:57:12,638
I want to go
as it’s a must for two lovers

843
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:15,202
to hold hands and walk like this,
at such a place.

844
00:57:16,943 --> 00:57:22,394
"The desire has spread
over my heart."

845
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:28,136
"Has the same desire
surrounded you too?"

846
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:33,767
"The pictures of the moments
that we spent together."

847
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:39,811
"We capture the moments
and save them in our eyes."

848
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:45,647
"Then wherever you are,
I feel you are close to me."

849
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:51,709
"I am truly alive."

850
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:57,744
"For you, only for you."

851
00:57:57,876 --> 00:58:03,433
"Every moment I live,
only for you."

852
00:58:03,756 --> 00:58:09,029
"For you, only for you."

853
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:15,511
"Every moment I live,
only for you."

854
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:30,558
"What you have said is
the feelings of your heart."

855
00:58:31,815 --> 00:58:36,315
"You are crazy,"

856
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:42,506
"my words have remained
unspoken and unheard."

857
00:58:42,596 --> 00:58:46,248
"You understand my beloved."

858
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:50,294
"Whether I say it or not."

859
00:58:52,348 --> 00:58:57,899
"My love,
I am yours with all my heart."

860
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:04,381
"Till yesterday we were strangers,
on the path."

861
00:59:04,996 --> 00:59:10,232
"Now you are present
in my breath and my sighs."

862
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:15,983
"Someone tell me,
when the dream spread all over."

863
00:59:16,148 --> 00:59:21,883
"When did we both come closer?"

864
00:59:22,127 --> 00:59:27,816
"What kind of magic is awakened?
It’s only me and you."

865
00:59:27,991 --> 00:59:34,001
"That I am truly alive."

866
00:59:34,189 --> 00:59:39,614
"For you, only for you."

867
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:45,389
"Every moment I live,
only for you."

868
00:59:45,855 --> 00:59:50,976
"For you, only for you."

869
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:57,407
"Every moment I live,
only for you."

870
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:29,085
"For you, only for you."

871
01:00:29,528 --> 01:00:35,014
"Every moment I live,
only for you."

872
01:01:02,507 --> 01:01:05,463
This is not the place, girl.

873
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:09,034
You know,
when you hug me like this,

874
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,395
then so many naughty thoughts
run in my heart.

875
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:18,550
This is the departure lounge.

876
01:01:19,955 --> 01:01:23,890
We may be separated, but
we should get a room at least.

877
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:27,444
Don’t try to make me laugh,
I will cry.

878
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:33,516
Don’t stop me
from talking nonsense.

879
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:35,951
Or else I will cry.

880
01:01:44,426 --> 01:01:45,505
I have...

881
01:01:48,677 --> 01:01:50,453
I have hidden something from you.

882
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:52,888
Jasmeet, let’s go.

883
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:02,265
I am marrying Samar
and going on a marriage visa.

884
01:02:03,328 --> 01:02:04,718
I am sorry.

885
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:07,428
I have done all this for us.

886
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:10,992
Trust me. Forgive me.

887
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:13,661
Take care of yourself.

888
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:15,477
I have to go.

889
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:48,776
Grandfather.

890
01:03:56,286 --> 01:03:59,690
Oh Jasmeet.

891
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:03,627
Bless me grandfather.
- Live long dear.

892
01:04:03,717 --> 01:04:08,485
Samar would have sweet talked
a lot to you.

893
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:13,433
But he is a number one rogue,
government official.

894
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:29,257
Whether anyone understand or not,
you surely will,

895
01:04:29,563 --> 01:04:31,190
that’s why I dared to do this.

896
01:04:39,826 --> 01:04:40,751
Sam.

897
01:04:41,952 --> 01:04:43,746
Hey guys.

898
01:04:45,655 --> 01:04:47,886
Alright, thank you so much.

899
01:04:50,571 --> 01:04:52,851
The literacy levels of UK
are going to fall.

900
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:55,259
Sam has imported such a villager.

901
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:04,169
Hey Sam.
- Hello darling, how have you been?

902
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:08,204
Happily and married.
How did all this happen?

903
01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:13,712
Wait, let me guess?
Lust at first sight.

904
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:16,185
But without a wedding,

905
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,012
a Punjabi girl would
not have agreed.

906
01:05:19,296 --> 01:05:21,577
No, it will be in your case.

907
01:05:22,463 --> 01:05:23,952
Lust at first sight but,

908
01:05:25,347 --> 01:05:27,284
the rest you had agreed
without the wedding.

909
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:28,580
So I was right,

910
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:30,585
she dint agree so you married her
and got her.

911
01:05:30,675 --> 01:05:31,720
Excuse me.

912
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:34,527
And by the way, like this...

913
01:05:36,741 --> 01:05:38,501
Jasmeet this is Alisha.
Alisha this is Jasmeet.

914
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:39,979
Hi.
- Hello.

915
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,866
You know what,
he is my childhood friend.

916
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,903
And a very big idiot.

917
01:05:47,512 --> 01:05:49,526
If he troubles you,
just let me know.

918
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:52,515
I want to set him right.
Isn’t it Sam?

919
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:56,920
Excuse me.

920
01:06:13,852 --> 01:06:15,047
Hello.

921
01:06:15,568 --> 01:06:16,957
It’s me Jasmeet.

922
01:06:17,776 --> 01:06:20,317
Not so many days have passed
that you have to tell your name.

923
01:06:20,937 --> 01:06:22,199
You are upset with me?

924
01:06:23,206 --> 01:06:24,612
You hate me?

925
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:26,090
I am trying my best.

926
01:06:29,859 --> 01:06:31,598
Even after 8 beers,

927
01:06:31,974 --> 01:06:33,352
I still miss you
and not feel anger.

928
01:06:33,966 --> 01:06:35,422
Why are you so nice?

929
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:37,530
Scold me.

930
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,407
Abuse me.

931
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:41,976
Why did I do? How did I do?

932
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:43,980
At least ask me that much.

933
01:06:44,156 --> 01:06:45,490
You had written,

934
01:06:47,206 --> 01:06:51,208
whether anybody else understands
or not, I will understand.

935
01:06:53,964 --> 01:06:55,835
So then I have understood,
what is there to ask.

936
01:06:57,995 --> 01:06:59,970
'Sister in law,
you watch pictures.'

937
01:07:00,662 --> 01:07:01,808
'I will tell you story.'

938
01:07:01,898 --> 01:07:04,426
'The pictures are of the heroes.'

939
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:06,984
'Samar Singh Sandu, alias, sam.'

940
01:07:07,509 --> 01:07:09,015
'He has lot of wealth.'

941
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,869
'But he just has a relative
a grandfather.'

942
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:13,050
'Who is unwell
and is 90 years old.'

943
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:16,437
'And on top of that he has cancer.'

944
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:18,618
'I have many girlfriends
in London.'

945
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,412
'I have a rocking social life.'

946
01:07:21,502 --> 01:07:24,650
'But my grandfather feels that
if I don’t marry an Indian girl.'

947
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:26,782
'Then my life style
will destroy my life.'

948
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:28,893
'So for his happiness,'

949
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:33,609
'Sam is marrying a beautiful,
Punjabi girl.'

950
01:07:34,256 --> 01:07:35,839
'But fake.'

951
01:07:36,675 --> 01:07:38,568
'There will be no relation
between us.'

952
01:07:39,841 --> 01:07:41,469
'You will not even touch me.'

953
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:43,904
'You are doing it
for your grandfather,'

954
01:07:45,055 --> 01:07:48,182
'and I am doing
for citizenship of UK.'

955
01:07:49,883 --> 01:07:53,415
'For both these things,
till we require to remain married,'

956
01:07:53,593 --> 01:07:54,778
'we will.'

957
01:07:54,988 --> 01:08:00,225
'Sister in law, don’t let Sam know
that you are already married.'

958
01:08:00,712 --> 01:08:03,717
'Or else the deal will break.'

959
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:06,314
It’s okay
if the world says I am wrong.

960
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:09,302
Will you forgive me?

961
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:12,082
Then I don’t care about the world.

962
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,076
I had forgiven you at the airport.

963
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:18,244
Or else you would
not have boarded the flight.

964
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:21,830
And I would not be at home,
but at the jail.

965
01:08:23,191 --> 01:08:27,182
Because you are so good,
I take advantage of you.

966
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:29,374
Getting married again
despite of being married,

967
01:08:29,464 --> 01:08:30,791
and you call it taking advantage?

968
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,388
Param, this is not a marriage.

969
01:08:33,478 --> 01:08:34,738
And our wedding?

970
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,046
Does that remain a marriage?

971
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:39,244
Remains absolutely.

972
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:42,163
Even if you would have to London
then also it would have remained.

973
01:08:42,761 --> 01:08:45,235
I have come here,
then also it will remain.

974
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:47,487
And will remain forever.

975
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:52,710
You just wait for me to come
and fetch you here.

976
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:08,485
Whether you are here or there,
you are good at waiting.

977
01:09:10,576 --> 01:09:11,761
Not I.

978
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:18,106
I want to go to London.

979
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:22,202
Legal, illegal. Everything is fine.

980
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:27,937
Darling before Gurpreet
comes to know,

981
01:09:28,027 --> 01:09:29,287
you go along with my men.

982
01:09:29,377 --> 01:09:32,431
You cross Bengal
and enter Bangladesh.

983
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:46,157
"I am here,
I am there, where I go."

984
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:52,128
"The heart ask me where you are.
Where you are?"

985
01:09:52,218 --> 01:09:58,627
"I have left the whole world
behind. Just for you."

986
01:09:58,717 --> 01:10:04,699
"Separation is on our paths."

987
01:10:04,789 --> 01:10:10,938
"Even if there is a distance.
Even if we are helpless."

988
01:10:11,028 --> 01:10:17,794
"I have decided,
I will attain you."

989
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:23,260
"I am coming to find you
like a crazy lover."

990
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:27,932
"One day the world will accept."

991
01:10:28,022 --> 01:10:30,212
From Dhaka, you take a small boat,
and in the middle of the ocean,

992
01:10:30,302 --> 01:10:33,085
you will be transferred
to a bigger boat.

993
01:10:33,175 --> 01:10:35,194
From where you will reach Brussels.

994
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:42,037
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

995
01:10:42,127 --> 01:10:48,165
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

996
01:10:48,294 --> 01:10:54,738
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

997
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:05,736
What happened? Are you mad?

998
01:11:06,091 --> 01:11:07,955
There are more than 50 people here,

999
01:11:09,248 --> 01:11:13,747
and I thought that only my girl
is crazy after England.

1000
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:15,660
Jasmeet.

1001
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:20,636
We need to take some
new clothes for you. Let’s go.

1002
01:11:21,442 --> 01:11:24,474
New clothes? I have clothes.

1003
01:11:25,474 --> 01:11:27,033
You can’t wear
these kind of clothes in my circle,

1004
01:11:27,123 --> 01:11:28,348
to look like my wife.

1005
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:29,711
You need a makeover.

1006
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:44,194
Jasmeet, hold on.
I am going to pay for it.

1007
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,599
No, I have money.

1008
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:48,719
We will only do that much
for each other,

1009
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:50,782
what we had promised.

1010
01:11:52,172 --> 01:11:53,071
Thank you.

1011
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:01,242
Awesome.

1012
01:12:01,992 --> 01:12:04,046
Girl, bless you dear.

1013
01:12:04,136 --> 01:12:06,299
You have brought me back
to my roots.

1014
01:12:07,075 --> 01:12:08,917
Without the tickets.

1015
01:12:10,213 --> 01:12:12,874
Even my accent has changed.

1016
01:12:13,025 --> 01:12:16,608
I am saying,
tic kas instead of tickets.

1017
01:12:20,446 --> 01:12:25,201
My dear, now
I can attain salvation definitely.

1018
01:12:25,644 --> 01:12:28,971
That too without tic kas.

1019
01:12:35,054 --> 01:12:36,747
Move aside.

1020
01:12:38,713 --> 01:12:40,905
Give me some more.
It’s less for me.

1021
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:43,390
Here you will only get this much.
Old man. Move.

1022
01:12:52,397 --> 01:12:55,723
What to do son,
have to bear this much.

1023
01:12:56,769 --> 01:12:59,266
Have left Punjab in search
of a job to get food.

1024
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,541
Grandfather, you can get food
at a Gurudwara too.

1025
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:07,978
You can get however much you want,
that too free.

1026
01:13:12,777 --> 01:13:16,651
We go overseas for luxuries,
like bungalows and cars.

1027
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:18,583
Not because of food.

1028
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:24,941
"My loneliness
is telling the story,"

1029
01:13:25,122 --> 01:13:30,666
"of the beautiful days spent."

1030
01:13:31,294 --> 01:13:37,373
"When we were together,
hand in hand together."

1031
01:13:37,463 --> 01:13:43,330
"Every moment was
beautiful around us."

1032
01:13:43,657 --> 01:13:46,658
"Why shouldn’t there be showers
of memories,"

1033
01:13:46,813 --> 01:13:49,797
"why shouldn’t my eyes yearn."

1034
01:13:49,887 --> 01:13:55,970
"It’s searching for you."

1035
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:02,561
"If I meet you,
I just want to tell you."

1036
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:05,275
From Brussels you will go
to Paris via train.

1037
01:14:05,365 --> 01:14:07,937
Because when once you enter Europe,

1038
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,128
then they don’t check
your passport.

1039
01:14:11,578 --> 01:14:17,722
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1040
01:14:17,812 --> 01:14:23,918
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1041
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:27,992
"You are mine, I am yours."

1042
01:14:54,173 --> 01:14:57,013
The biggest danger
of the whole journey is

1043
01:14:57,103 --> 01:14:58,446
at Clive check post.

1044
01:14:58,646 --> 01:15:01,712
The check using carbon dioxide,

1045
01:15:01,884 --> 01:15:03,555
if anyone is hidden
inside the truck.

1046
01:15:03,981 --> 01:15:06,339
You have to cover your head
with a plastic bag.

1047
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:09,268
And whatever happens,
even if you lose your life,

1048
01:15:09,358 --> 01:15:11,660
the bag should not be taken out.
Remember it.

1049
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:20,361
"The journey is difficult,
day and nights are tough."

1050
01:15:20,451 --> 01:15:26,333
"It follows me like a shadow."

1051
01:15:26,633 --> 01:15:32,699
"The feet are wounded,
but my heart is still adamant."

1052
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:38,776
"It still wants
to be close to you."

1053
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:45,208
"The loneliness of the paths,
and the fatigue of the body."

1054
01:15:45,298 --> 01:15:51,220
"I am a target so many arrows."

1055
01:15:51,419 --> 01:15:57,407
"After this I have realized."

1056
01:15:57,618 --> 01:16:03,746
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1057
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:09,968
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1058
01:16:10,058 --> 01:16:16,148
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1059
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:22,396
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1060
01:16:22,486 --> 01:16:28,540
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1061
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:34,747
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1062
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:40,995
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1063
01:16:41,085 --> 01:16:47,111
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1064
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:53,297
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1065
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:59,503
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1066
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:05,946
"You are mine, I am yours.
You are mine, I am yours."

1067
01:17:21,017 --> 01:17:22,456
London girl.

1068
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:27,864
If I wasn’t married,
I would have surely married you.

1069
01:17:32,557 --> 01:17:34,810
What have you become?

1070
01:17:35,363 --> 01:17:36,825
Where are you staying?

1071
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:40,290
Don’t worry about me,
I have planned everything.

1072
01:17:47,032 --> 01:17:48,848
I had told you in Punjab,

1073
01:17:49,811 --> 01:17:53,259
I had no problem, of you having
a fake wedding and coming here.

1074
01:17:53,746 --> 01:17:55,617
Then why do you have a problem?

1075
01:17:57,925 --> 01:17:59,304
I had also said there,

1076
01:18:00,328 --> 01:18:01,933
that I don’t have a problem,
in you coming here.

1077
01:18:02,564 --> 01:18:04,673
Problem is of lies,
with this drama.

1078
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,876
I am doing this drama
for both of us.

1079
01:18:07,384 --> 01:18:09,243
For us to settle down here.

1080
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:14,008
Till we get a visa to stay.
I will do whatever possible.

1081
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:18,115
I will have to lie to Samar.
I will lie.

1082
01:18:19,697 --> 01:18:23,135
I have taken such a big risk,
lowered myself in everyone’s eyes.

1083
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:24,623
And I have come here.

1084
01:18:27,033 --> 01:18:30,581
Param, now I will not go back.
Whatever happens?

1085
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,386
Your grandfather, your whole family
did wrong with you.

1086
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:38,574
For that you can’t take revenge
from the whole world.

1087
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:41,348
The war is only fought,
where it belongs to.

1088
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:46,506
I...

1089
01:18:57,786 --> 01:18:59,339
Hello.
- Hey it’s me.

1090
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:02,338
Listen we have to go
for the inauguration of Zaika.

1091
01:19:02,808 --> 01:19:03,632
Zaika?

1092
01:19:03,722 --> 01:19:04,823
It’s an Indian restaurant.

1093
01:19:05,257 --> 01:19:07,578
You reach home,
we should be leaving soon.

1094
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:09,712
Okay, I coming.

1095
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,639
I have to go for the inauguration
of an Indian restaurant.

1096
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:20,604
I have to go.

1097
01:19:21,021 --> 01:19:23,262
You are just tasting this place
or have started working too?

1098
01:19:25,037 --> 01:19:26,242
For which, you had come here.

1099
01:19:30,389 --> 01:19:31,677
The job that I want to do,

1100
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,197
I cannot do,
till I get my residency.

1101
01:19:34,914 --> 01:19:36,344
It’s not possible legally.

1102
01:19:38,496 --> 01:19:40,152
But I have prepared everything.

1103
01:19:40,789 --> 01:19:43,225
Spoken to the Jewelers,
my designs are ready too.

1104
01:19:43,315 --> 01:19:44,478
Everything is ready.

1105
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:46,847
Once I get my residency.

1106
01:19:48,145 --> 01:19:49,601
Nobody can stop me.

1107
01:19:59,426 --> 01:20:01,923
Jasmeet I thought it was
your childishness.

1108
01:20:04,337 --> 01:20:06,413
But this city has become
your obsession.

1109
01:20:10,243 --> 01:20:11,588
First time...

1110
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:15,357
I am witnessing a woman’s affair
not with a man, but with a city.

1111
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:21,757
Since I have come already,

1112
01:20:21,847 --> 01:20:23,152
let me see after all
what this city is about.

1113
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:27,630
But Girl, remember.

1114
01:20:29,085 --> 01:20:30,286
I am a true lover.

1115
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,178
I will only be in peace

1116
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:38,224
after removing
this obsession from you.

1117
01:20:48,071 --> 01:20:51,896
Finally after reaching London,
you will meet a man,

1118
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,272
whose name is Iqbal Khan,
from Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

1119
01:20:55,582 --> 01:20:57,426
Darling, he will help you onwards.

1120
01:20:59,363 --> 01:21:01,112
Param.
- Yes.

1121
01:21:01,355 --> 01:21:02,789
So you are an army man.

1122
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:05,639
I am a farmer. Doing M.SC.

1123
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:07,516
Fresher from Punjab.

1124
01:21:07,936 --> 01:21:10,223
Here illegal guys
are called army men.

1125
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:11,606
Oh that’s respect.

1126
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:16,002
In our country, an army man
expels the illegal guys.

1127
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:18,575
You are a jolly guy.

1128
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,675
You come along me
to Buckingham Palace. Come on.

1129
01:21:22,788 --> 01:21:24,912
This is your Buckingham Palace.

1130
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:27,952
Only the queens don’t live here,
only the kings.

1131
01:21:28,118 --> 01:21:29,457
This is Shyam.

1132
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:32,923
And he is Murlidharan.

1133
01:21:34,616 --> 01:21:35,690
And that’s mine.

1134
01:21:36,072 --> 01:21:39,759
Illegal Asian tiger’s v/s
legal home department of England.

1135
01:21:41,093 --> 01:21:42,743
Since 10 years the Trophy
belongs to us.

1136
01:21:42,886 --> 01:21:46,407
I will teach you the trick
of roaming freely as the army men.

1137
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,595
My bed?

1138
01:21:51,969 --> 01:21:53,868
We won’t let you sleep
in the drawing room.

1139
01:21:55,496 --> 01:21:58,020
This is your lavish bed room.

1140
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:59,530
This is the bathroom.

1141
01:22:00,377 --> 01:22:03,283
From morning 6 to night 10.

1142
01:22:04,047 --> 01:22:05,386
After that...

1143
01:22:07,734 --> 01:22:10,186
It turns into a bedroom.

1144
01:22:10,276 --> 01:22:12,769
But you have to sleep
after 10 o clock.

1145
01:22:12,947 --> 01:22:15,050
Come, I will show you more.

1146
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:17,767
Keep the empty boxes.

1147
01:22:19,444 --> 01:22:21,724
She is my wife and,
she my daughter.

1148
01:22:22,245 --> 01:22:24,603
When I left home, she was still
in her mother’s womb.

1149
01:22:27,431 --> 01:22:28,891
I saw her on video call.

1150
01:22:32,613 --> 01:22:35,706
But I could never pull her cheeks.

1151
01:22:37,235 --> 01:22:39,954
Could never play with her
on my lap.

1152
01:22:44,707 --> 01:22:46,838
This is the biggest problem
of the Punjabis.

1153
01:22:47,454 --> 01:22:50,304
Whenever we meet the other Punjabi
the flood of tears start flowing.

1154
01:22:51,364 --> 01:22:53,827
Oh my kids, my wife.

1155
01:22:55,197 --> 01:22:58,352
If we loved them so much,
then why did we leave our land?

1156
01:22:58,442 --> 01:22:59,901
And come to London to earn pounds.

1157
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:05,013
But I have an answer for it.

1158
01:23:05,829 --> 01:23:08,687
Even if I am not there,
their lives are sorted.

1159
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:11,114
Life is set.

1160
01:23:14,738 --> 01:23:16,626
This answer of yours is wrong.

1161
01:23:17,696 --> 01:23:20,387
You are here, she is there.

1162
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:23,465
How is their life sorted?

1163
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,540
I started off, on the first day.

1164
01:23:28,077 --> 01:23:30,712
You enjoy. I will get beer.

1165
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:33,724
Then will cry, I mean will talk.

1166
01:23:34,106 --> 01:23:35,042
Let’s go.

1167
01:23:37,743 --> 01:23:39,198
Brother Iqbal.
- Yes.

1168
01:23:39,475 --> 01:23:40,715
Show me an address?

1169
01:23:42,087 --> 01:23:44,052
Rest of the beer
I will drink there.

1170
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:51,691
Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1171
01:23:52,598 --> 01:23:53,677
Cheers.

1172
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:01,178
This is for you.

1173
01:24:04,173 --> 01:24:05,578
What is this?

1174
01:24:06,891 --> 01:24:08,452
For what you have done
for grandfather.

1175
01:24:09,154 --> 01:24:10,621
This is nothing
in comparison of that.

1176
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:15,647
A girl can make so much
of a difference in someone’s life.

1177
01:24:15,985 --> 01:24:17,280
I learnt, after meeting you.

1178
01:24:18,952 --> 01:24:20,097
Thank you for the lesson.

1179
01:24:23,182 --> 01:24:24,593
Trust me, it’s a gift.

1180
01:24:25,097 --> 01:24:27,056
Please, no gifts.

1181
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:30,233
I don’t want to divorce you.

1182
01:24:31,926 --> 01:24:33,271
Because I really like you.

1183
01:24:34,351 --> 01:24:36,006
You are a fantastic person.

1184
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:40,436
You are attractive,
and we are formally married too.

1185
01:24:40,526 --> 01:24:42,202
Jasmeet Malhotra.

1186
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:48,490
Finally you reached London.

1187
01:24:48,711 --> 01:24:52,238
Wow,
that’s what I called a Desi Hunk.

1188
01:24:52,328 --> 01:24:54,734
Oh God, one more Indian.

1189
01:24:55,244 --> 01:24:58,056
UK, government
should ban these Indians.

1190
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:00,342
You speak another word about him.

1191
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:03,154
And I am going to kill you.

1192
01:25:05,257 --> 01:25:07,864
Do you guys know each other?
Know each other?

1193
01:25:09,641 --> 01:25:11,522
We both marry...

1194
01:25:11,854 --> 01:25:12,729
Wedding.

1195
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:17,065
We both used to go
to the village weddings

1196
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:21,001
and whack ice creams
and sweets and deserts.

1197
01:25:21,091 --> 01:25:23,033
That’s why our bodies
are like this.

1198
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:25,396
You should have told.
- By the way I am Sam.

1199
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:27,228
Nice to meet you, man.

1200
01:25:27,759 --> 01:25:30,211
Actually Jasmeet will give
a better introduction of mine.

1201
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:31,790
Introduce me Jasmeet.

1202
01:25:34,584 --> 01:25:37,440
He is Param Singh. My...

1203
01:25:39,321 --> 01:25:41,015
He is my...
- Neighbor.

1204
01:25:42,543 --> 01:25:44,696
You took so long to say neighbor.

1205
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:46,993
Your Hindi has become poor,
in London.

1206
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:49,191
But don’t worry,
I will improve your Hindi.

1207
01:25:49,281 --> 01:25:51,112
Sam we are neighbors.
- Okay.

1208
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,418
Hey gorgeous lovely people.

1209
01:26:01,508 --> 01:26:03,716
Ladies and gentleman,
we know that you.

1210
01:26:03,806 --> 01:26:06,234
All like to do a bit of Bhangra.

1211
01:26:06,445 --> 01:26:11,426
So girls and boys, get ready,
let’s get some dancing.

1212
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:18,999
Okay I am going to get. Watch me.

1213
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:21,334
"Don’t go alone."

1214
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,176
"Don’t go alone."

1215
01:26:26,887 --> 01:26:28,652
"Don’t go alone."

1216
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,189
"Don’t go alone."

1217
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:38,698
"In a crowded market,
in a crowded market baby."

1218
01:26:38,788 --> 01:26:42,372
"Don’t go alone, or else
there will be a commotion."

1219
01:26:42,462 --> 01:26:44,163
"In a crowded market,
in a crowded market baby."

1220
01:26:44,253 --> 01:26:47,772
"Don’t go alone, or else
there will be a commotion."

1221
01:26:47,862 --> 01:26:53,296
"Everyone is a lover,
everyone is a lover,"

1222
01:26:53,386 --> 01:26:56,955
"will come to drop you home."

1223
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,753
"In a crowded market,
in a crowded market baby."

1224
01:26:58,843 --> 01:27:02,462
"Don’t go alone, or else
there will be a commotion."

1225
01:27:02,552 --> 01:27:04,206
"Don’t go alone."

1226
01:27:06,182 --> 01:27:07,782
"Don’t go alone."

1227
01:27:09,769 --> 01:27:13,422
"You will cause fight
amongst the lovers."

1228
01:27:13,512 --> 01:27:17,064
"Still nobody
will be able to reach you."

1229
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:20,762
"You will cause fight
amongst the lovers."

1230
01:27:20,852 --> 01:27:24,332
"Still nobody will be
able to reach you."

1231
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:29,894
"She will tell you to go away,
tell to go away."

1232
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:33,520
"But baby,
this will not be able to happen."

1233
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:35,402
"In a crowded market,
in a crowded market baby."

1234
01:27:35,492 --> 01:27:38,996
"Don’t go alone, or else
there will be a commotion."

1235
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:40,624
"Don’t go alone."

1236
01:27:42,705 --> 01:27:45,368
What was I saying? Listen.

1237
01:27:45,738 --> 01:27:49,298
"Baby,
I know you have a large heart."

1238
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:52,973
"That’s why I am waiting for you
at the dance floor."

1239
01:27:53,063 --> 01:27:56,589
"Don’t move your shoulders
while sitting."

1240
01:27:56,679 --> 01:28:00,353
"Shake your legs and show me
your dance moves."

1241
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:02,562
"She shoots with her eyes."

1242
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,338
"She keeps dangling
everyone’s hearts."

1243
01:28:04,428 --> 01:28:06,204
"Is she a school teacher?"

1244
01:28:06,294 --> 01:28:08,019
"As she keeps lecturing everyone
all the time."

1245
01:28:08,109 --> 01:28:11,661
"I have written this song for you.
Will you sing along with me?"

1246
01:28:11,751 --> 01:28:15,816
"Why are you staring at me madam?
Will you bite me?"

1247
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:19,455
"Will you bite me or what?"

1248
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,012
Jasmeet, you were amazing.

1249
01:28:29,644 --> 01:28:31,177
You have hidden
a lot about yourself.

1250
01:28:31,267 --> 01:28:33,551
This is just the beginning. Sam.

1251
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:38,045
She is a stock of surprises.
She has surprises in Kilos.

1252
01:28:38,565 --> 01:28:41,406
Look she doesn’t get angry.

1253
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:44,848
But when she rolls her eyes
that means it time to shut up.

1254
01:28:46,908 --> 01:28:48,302
Param, can I drop you somewhere?

1255
01:28:48,613 --> 01:28:50,318
I always get dropped by girls.

1256
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:52,355
You too drop me.

1257
01:28:52,445 --> 01:28:54,176
Come, my car is right there,
see you guys.

1258
01:28:54,266 --> 01:28:55,599
Bye.
- Bye.

1259
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:58,046
It was nice meeting you Sam.
- You too Param.

1260
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,624
I will see you soon.
- Yes, surely.

1261
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:02,381
Jasmeet I will be there,
waiting for you. - Yeah.

1262
01:29:04,363 --> 01:29:06,549
It was very nice meeting you too,
Jasmeet.

1263
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:07,694
We will dance again,

1264
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:10,428
I mean will meet again.

1265
01:29:11,004 --> 01:29:14,165
Yes, we have to meet.

1266
01:29:16,721 --> 01:29:19,899
Don’t trouble Alisha much.

1267
01:29:20,264 --> 01:29:22,916
And don’t let her trouble you also.

1268
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:26,856
I can take my guarantee, not hers.

1269
01:29:33,885 --> 01:29:35,357
Alisha, where have you got me?

1270
01:29:36,447 --> 01:29:38,484
This seems like a hill station
in London.

1271
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:41,147
How does it matter?

1272
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:47,302
Don’t bite, it will help me
in wearing spectacles in old age.

1273
01:29:55,936 --> 01:29:57,020
What’s wrong Param?

1274
01:29:58,537 --> 01:29:59,760
You don’t find me attractive?

1275
01:30:00,635 --> 01:30:01,863
Attractive?

1276
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:04,614
If in Punjabi
we have a girl like you,

1277
01:30:04,704 --> 01:30:06,634
then we call it Diwali Bumper.

1278
01:30:07,674 --> 01:30:09,401
Then why are you acting funny?

1279
01:30:11,361 --> 01:30:14,167
I hope you have a reason
to act like this?

1280
01:30:16,415 --> 01:30:17,754
Wedding.

1281
01:30:18,894 --> 01:30:20,112
I am married man.

1282
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:23,793
Param,

1283
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:26,727
I like experienced men.

1284
01:30:26,817 --> 01:30:28,476
I am married to Jasmeet.

1285
01:30:29,196 --> 01:30:31,072
And I have come to London for her.

1286
01:30:46,679 --> 01:30:48,639
Punjabi girl was looking so...

1287
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:51,140
Sam, what are you doing?

1288
01:30:51,384 --> 01:30:52,430
What are you doing?

1289
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,539
Helping you to decide.

1290
01:30:54,755 --> 01:30:56,908
Sam, please.

1291
01:30:58,707 --> 01:30:59,859
You know what,

1292
01:31:00,862 --> 01:31:02,500
I am not used to hearing a no.

1293
01:31:04,925 --> 01:31:07,355
We both had promised something
to one another.

1294
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:10,305
I am abiding my promise.

1295
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:13,340
You too abide.

1296
01:31:14,132 --> 01:31:15,560
What if I break my promise?

1297
01:31:16,861 --> 01:31:18,610
What if I don’t divorce you?

1298
01:31:34,278 --> 01:31:37,111
Do you know,
if today I tell Jasmeet,

1299
01:31:37,288 --> 01:31:38,606
that live in London without me?

1300
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,723
Or come back to India with me.

1301
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:44,385
She will come quietly come back
with me.

1302
01:31:44,778 --> 01:31:47,120
She loves me so much, mad girl.

1303
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:52,019
But I don’t want her to be helpless
and take this decision.

1304
01:31:53,663 --> 01:31:55,368
I want her to take the decision
with her heart.

1305
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:00,790
If there were more boys like you.
Then I too would have been married.

1306
01:32:02,534 --> 01:32:03,736
So I will help you to stay.

1307
01:32:04,599 --> 01:32:05,490
Thank you.

1308
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:07,272
But what is the point
of just staying.

1309
01:32:09,276 --> 01:32:11,451
I don’t think, Jasmeet will go back
to India again.

1310
01:32:13,067 --> 01:32:17,456
In today’s world, marriage, love,
has no importance.

1311
01:32:17,546 --> 01:32:18,956
Has no value.

1312
01:32:19,736 --> 01:32:21,928
Even today there is
only one thing left.

1313
01:32:22,942 --> 01:32:24,519
On which the whole world
is dependent.

1314
01:32:25,831 --> 01:32:27,066
Love.

1315
01:32:29,263 --> 01:32:32,976
My Jasmeet will surely come back,
and I know how.

1316
01:32:36,867 --> 01:32:38,256
You get married to me.

1317
01:32:42,668 --> 01:32:43,726
Fake.

1318
01:32:48,177 --> 01:32:49,826
If she finds me making a mistake.

1319
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:53,346
Maybe she herself
will realize her mistake.

1320
01:32:54,586 --> 01:32:56,590
Mad girl will understand.

1321
01:32:57,492 --> 01:33:01,306
To first hurt someone and then
search for happiness is stupidity.

1322
01:33:02,009 --> 01:33:03,127
It’s stupid.

1323
01:33:04,544 --> 01:33:06,006
It’s very profound.

1324
01:33:08,192 --> 01:33:10,395
And it sounds like fun. I must say.

1325
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:12,388
Okay I am ready.

1326
01:33:13,473 --> 01:33:14,647
But here is the deal.

1327
01:33:16,302 --> 01:33:17,907
Till the exact time of the wedding.

1328
01:33:18,195 --> 01:33:20,647
If Jasmeet realizes her mistake,

1329
01:33:20,973 --> 01:33:23,015
and she is ready to go
to India with you.

1330
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:24,687
Then it’s fine.

1331
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:27,155
But if it doesn’t happen.

1332
01:33:28,146 --> 01:33:29,430
Then there will
surely be a wedding.

1333
01:33:30,802 --> 01:33:32,358
Not a drama but for real.

1334
01:33:32,968 --> 01:33:34,169
Means.

1335
01:33:37,457 --> 01:33:39,266
You will not marry me otherwise,

1336
01:33:40,445 --> 01:33:42,687
this is my single chance
to marry you.

1337
01:33:44,857 --> 01:33:46,478
So are you ready for this bet.

1338
01:33:50,429 --> 01:33:51,929
I am serious Param.

1339
01:33:53,428 --> 01:33:54,995
I know you are serious.

1340
01:33:58,166 --> 01:33:59,312
Done.

1341
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:02,062
I trust my Jasmeet completely.

1342
01:34:02,152 --> 01:34:03,606
And I believe this world.

1343
01:34:04,917 --> 01:34:06,257
Let see who wins.

1344
01:34:07,203 --> 01:34:08,559
The game starts tomorrow.

1345
01:34:24,939 --> 01:34:26,655
What happened guys?
Why aren’t you all sleeping?

1346
01:34:27,264 --> 01:34:28,476
His daughter is unwell.

1347
01:34:33,684 --> 01:34:35,118
What happened?

1348
01:34:36,258 --> 01:34:37,875
Got a call from the hospital.

1349
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,660
She is admitted there.

1350
01:34:44,805 --> 01:34:46,156
Have faith.

1351
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:48,757
Everything will be fine.

1352
01:34:50,347 --> 01:34:51,570
I trust him only.

1353
01:34:52,638 --> 01:34:54,575
Otherwise,
I have done what my heart desired.

1354
01:35:15,836 --> 01:35:17,192
Alisha.

1355
01:35:18,726 --> 01:35:19,855
You look lovely.

1356
01:35:19,945 --> 01:35:22,323
Thank you. How are you?
- Very nice.

1357
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:24,637
Hi Jasmeet.
- Hi.

1358
01:35:25,649 --> 01:35:26,756
You look beautiful.

1359
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:30,860
So, yesterday night’s dance,
and today’s surprise party?

1360
01:35:31,231 --> 01:35:32,897
Is there really a surprise or...?

1361
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:36,467
What will be the surprise
if I tell you?

1362
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:40,088
I had told you, we will meet again.

1363
01:35:40,602 --> 01:35:43,375
I had told you, we had to meet.

1364
01:35:43,465 --> 01:35:46,171
But here, like this,
I had not imagined.

1365
01:35:47,079 --> 01:35:50,367
Oh brother is here too,
what a surprise.

1366
01:35:50,457 --> 01:35:51,668
What is surprising in this,

1367
01:35:51,758 --> 01:35:53,561
Jasmeet’s husband
will be with Jasmeet.

1368
01:35:53,651 --> 01:35:54,718
Not necessary,

1369
01:35:54,808 --> 01:35:57,707
now a day’s many husbands
are not with their wives.

1370
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,080
Isn’t it Jasmeet?

1371
01:35:59,273 --> 01:36:01,062
Anyways you guys carry on.
I will see you around.

1372
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:04,183
You guys discuss your stories,
I will be back.

1373
01:36:04,644 --> 01:36:07,522
Param,
will you look after your friend.

1374
01:36:07,854 --> 01:36:09,963
If she allows me,
then I surely will.

1375
01:36:12,138 --> 01:36:13,754
Why has he come here?

1376
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:15,503
I like him.

1377
01:36:15,593 --> 01:36:16,444
Yuck Alisha.

1378
01:36:16,534 --> 01:36:17,668
Chill out, enjoy your party.

1379
01:36:17,758 --> 01:36:18,830
Hi guys, see you.

1380
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,343
What is all this? Why were
you not picking up my phone?

1381
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:23,009
I was sleeping.

1382
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:24,608
Where?

1383
01:36:24,698 --> 01:36:28,151
How does it matter?
Why are you asking this question?

1384
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:29,988
Did she do something with you?

1385
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,291
Till day I have not suspected Sam.

1386
01:36:32,381 --> 01:36:34,899
Then why are you suspecting Alisha.
Very bad.

1387
01:36:35,143 --> 01:36:36,703
Don’t procrastinate, answer me.

1388
01:36:37,534 --> 01:36:40,052
You are asking questions
like wives do.

1389
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:42,825
I am your wife.

1390
01:36:43,811 --> 01:36:46,435
Oh you remember. Congratulations.

1391
01:36:46,525 --> 01:36:48,322
I thought you must have forgotten.

1392
01:36:49,164 --> 01:36:51,578
Couldn’t you find anyone else,
to be friendly.

1393
01:36:52,403 --> 01:36:54,445
She is that type of a girl.

1394
01:36:54,535 --> 01:36:56,881
What are you saying?
She is a very good girl.

1395
01:36:57,069 --> 01:36:58,314
I can’t find a girl like her
in Punjab.

1396
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:01,209
Do you know, even while staying
in London, she is a vegetarian.

1397
01:37:01,419 --> 01:37:04,719
So what if she doesn’t eat meat.
She eats men.

1398
01:37:06,021 --> 01:37:09,270
She has slept with half
the people present in this party.

1399
01:37:09,774 --> 01:37:11,623
You remember,
Babli from my high school.

1400
01:37:11,713 --> 01:37:13,129
She is like that.

1401
01:37:13,278 --> 01:37:15,852
If someone tells her to sit,
she will lie down.

1402
01:37:17,202 --> 01:37:19,190
If people know that
she is a naughty girl,

1403
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,479
why do they tell her to sit?

1404
01:37:20,569 --> 01:37:23,784
When she is back, I will tell her,
Alisha don’t sit, not at all.

1405
01:37:23,874 --> 01:37:25,769
Whoever says anything don’t sit.
- Param,

1406
01:37:26,589 --> 01:37:29,666
I don’t like you getting friendly
with her.

1407
01:37:29,756 --> 01:37:31,520
Whether you do something or not.

1408
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:33,064
What If I say the same thing?

1409
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:41,688
You have no answer.

1410
01:37:42,589 --> 01:37:45,993
Jasmeet you enjoy the party.
And let me also.

1411
01:37:46,924 --> 01:37:48,457
Where is the bar?

1412
01:37:54,425 --> 01:37:57,182
How are you? Are you enjoying?

1413
01:37:58,976 --> 01:38:01,976
Yes I was going to. You halted me.

1414
01:38:02,148 --> 01:38:05,907
Party with London’s high society.

1415
01:38:06,476 --> 01:38:07,683
Everyone will enjoy.

1416
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:10,217
Especially if he comes
from such a place,

1417
01:38:10,511 --> 01:38:12,946
where there is nothing
except dust and dirt.

1418
01:38:14,213 --> 01:38:16,488
By the face, you look
as if you are made of the same mud.

1419
01:38:16,578 --> 01:38:18,676
No I am British.

1420
01:38:19,223 --> 01:38:20,347
I was born here.

1421
01:38:21,144 --> 01:38:21,959
I have never gone to India,

1422
01:38:22,049 --> 01:38:24,793
And I don’t like
to be called an Indian.

1423
01:38:26,044 --> 01:38:27,146
Trishanku,

1424
01:38:28,457 --> 01:38:30,283
You don’t like being called an Indian.

1425
01:38:30,955 --> 01:38:33,805
You are dying
to be called a British.

1426
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:37,342
But if a British man finds you
even a kilometer away,

1427
01:38:37,432 --> 01:38:40,288
he will say,
look an Indian is coming.

1428
01:38:41,189 --> 01:38:42,717
Excuse me.

1429
01:38:43,403 --> 01:38:44,483
What did you say?

1430
01:38:54,295 --> 01:38:56,569
So you hate being called an Indian.

1431
01:38:57,576 --> 01:39:00,045
Because we litter all around.

1432
01:39:00,317 --> 01:39:03,715
Spit betel leaves.
Break traffic signals.

1433
01:39:04,655 --> 01:39:06,454
We don’t like to stand in queues.

1434
01:39:06,869 --> 01:39:08,668
We take bribe and also give bribe.

1435
01:39:10,401 --> 01:39:12,670
There are more pot holes
than roads.

1436
01:39:13,473 --> 01:39:15,178
More scams than the ministers.

1437
01:39:16,097 --> 01:39:17,552
Though we are like this,

1438
01:39:20,786 --> 01:39:22,225
we are different too.

1439
01:39:23,804 --> 01:39:25,950
We have been independent
since 70 years.

1440
01:39:26,466 --> 01:39:28,995
Take any young country around us.

1441
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:31,779
There is still a question
on their identity?

1442
01:39:31,994 --> 01:39:36,202
But we make everything ourselves,
from a needle to a rocket.

1443
01:39:37,109 --> 01:39:38,698
After attempting 20 times,

1444
01:39:38,788 --> 01:39:41,820
larger countries send satellite
to mars.

1445
01:39:42,595 --> 01:39:45,628
But we in the first attempt,
at the cost of a Rickshaw,

1446
01:39:45,718 --> 01:39:47,554
have sent satellite
after satellite to mars.

1447
01:39:47,703 --> 01:39:50,267
Because we are very influential.

1448
01:39:53,278 --> 01:39:56,809
We were not like this from before.

1449
01:39:57,767 --> 01:39:59,333
We were the golden birds.

1450
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:02,698
The Kohinoor diamond which is in
the crown, at the tower of London.

1451
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:04,615
It is not made in Bartaniya
like you.

1452
01:40:05,058 --> 01:40:06,563
But made in India.

1453
01:40:08,533 --> 01:40:11,008
But we have not stopped
in our old glory.

1454
01:40:12,275 --> 01:40:13,576
We are progressing.

1455
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:15,791
We are changing.

1456
01:40:17,074 --> 01:40:20,107
If we develop at this speed, and
keep fighting against corruption.

1457
01:40:20,197 --> 01:40:23,949
Then, in the next 50 years,
India will develop so much that,

1458
01:40:24,452 --> 01:40:26,638
Americans and British’s will say.

1459
01:40:26,728 --> 01:40:29,051
We too want to be known as Indian.

1460
01:40:30,712 --> 01:40:33,553
Then don’t change your side,
Mr. Trishanku.

1461
01:40:35,927 --> 01:40:38,711
Be happy with what you are.

1462
01:40:39,132 --> 01:40:40,832
Don’t find mistakes of the country.

1463
01:40:42,992 --> 01:40:44,492
Not your identity.

1464
01:40:58,223 --> 01:40:59,458
She sat down.

1465
01:40:59,967 --> 01:41:02,729
Param Singh. Will you marry me?

1466
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:04,284
What?
- What?

1467
01:41:04,374 --> 01:41:05,330
What?

1468
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:06,719
Will you marry me?

1469
01:41:07,195 --> 01:41:09,133
I know it looks a bit odd. But...

1470
01:41:09,223 --> 01:41:10,871
Not bit, very odd.

1471
01:41:11,297 --> 01:41:15,244
Alisha, you don’t even know Param.

1472
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:17,115
I don’t care.

1473
01:41:17,774 --> 01:41:20,547
I just know the girl
who will marry Param,

1474
01:41:20,851 --> 01:41:22,960
will be luckiest girl in the world.

1475
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:25,324
Alisha, please get up.

1476
01:41:25,414 --> 01:41:28,501
Your knees must be paining.
He is anyway going to refuse.

1477
01:41:28,591 --> 01:41:30,089
Yes I am going back to India.

1478
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:33,278
I am okay.
I will go along with you.

1479
01:41:33,368 --> 01:41:35,254
But you will not be
able to settle there.

1480
01:41:35,344 --> 01:41:37,164
You will feel suffocated.

1481
01:41:37,254 --> 01:41:38,835
You will be entangled
in cooking chores.

1482
01:41:38,925 --> 01:41:40,119
You will feel like
going for shopping,

1483
01:41:40,209 --> 01:41:41,757
and you will have
to inject a buffalo.

1484
01:41:41,847 --> 01:41:43,296
You will not at all be
able to take up a job.

1485
01:41:43,782 --> 01:41:47,491
Param Singh, for you,
I will take the bull or buffalo,

1486
01:41:47,724 --> 01:41:50,321
to get injected.
- Really?

1487
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:54,052
Alisha. You get up.
He cannot marry you?

1488
01:41:54,142 --> 01:41:56,171
Why can’t he?
- Why can’t he?

1489
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:59,132
Because...
- Because?

1490
01:41:59,271 --> 01:42:00,538
He is already married.

1491
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:02,408
You are already married?

1492
01:42:02,498 --> 01:42:06,431
I was once upon a time but,
as I told you earlier,

1493
01:42:06,521 --> 01:42:08,531
husbands don’t live
with their wives now a days.

1494
01:42:08,621 --> 01:42:14,003
So now a days I am single
and ready to mingle.

1495
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:15,791
I do.

1496
01:42:20,865 --> 01:42:23,643
You were going to follow me,
here, there all around the world.

1497
01:42:23,733 --> 01:42:25,187
Which path did you take now?

1498
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:27,385
Was I upset at the airport?

1499
01:42:27,789 --> 01:42:29,112
Then why are you? Relax.

1500
01:42:29,588 --> 01:42:30,640
I...

1501
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:32,068
Ice cream.

1502
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:33,923
I have not married him in real.

1503
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:38,091
Sam was not begging on his knees.
Sam was acting.

1504
01:42:38,506 --> 01:42:40,073
Now the drama is over.

1505
01:42:40,544 --> 01:42:42,044
Why isn’t he giving you
the divorce?

1506
01:42:42,841 --> 01:42:45,265
The long haired guy
has started liking his role.

1507
01:42:45,642 --> 01:42:46,749
He is not going
to give you divorce,

1508
01:42:46,839 --> 01:42:48,764
it is written clearly on his face.

1509
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:52,301
Do you know why? Because
he has fallen in love with you.

1510
01:42:53,873 --> 01:42:57,337
Or you know that
he has fallen for you.

1511
01:42:57,427 --> 01:42:59,253
But you are hiding from me.

1512
01:42:59,463 --> 01:43:00,974
But I don’t love him.

1513
01:43:01,064 --> 01:43:02,352
So that means he does.

1514
01:43:02,507 --> 01:43:05,020
Irrespective of whether
he does or not, I don’t Param.

1515
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:08,176
But I also don’t love Alisha,
Jasmeet.

1516
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:11,359
Then why are you marrying her.
- The way you did.

1517
01:43:13,762 --> 01:43:15,970
I know Sam
is not going to divorce you.

1518
01:43:17,493 --> 01:43:19,950
I will marry Alisha.
We will get residency here.

1519
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,638
I will divorce her
after a few days.

1520
01:43:21,809 --> 01:43:23,630
We will register
our marriage again.

1521
01:43:23,785 --> 01:43:25,983
You will be a resident here.

1522
01:43:26,564 --> 01:43:30,793
In between, Alisha may fall
in love with me and get emotional.

1523
01:43:30,883 --> 01:43:32,920
Her heart might break,
she may be destroyed.

1524
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:35,117
How does it matter to us?
Right or wrong does not matter.

1525
01:43:35,207 --> 01:43:37,115
We just have
to get settled in London.

1526
01:43:49,025 --> 01:43:50,531
Enjoy the ice cream.

1527
01:43:51,218 --> 01:43:52,701
Where are you going?

1528
01:43:52,944 --> 01:43:54,826
I am getting married after 4 days
on the 14th.

1529
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:57,328
I have to do lot of preparations.
Bye.

1530
01:44:03,068 --> 01:44:04,380
Param.

1531
01:44:06,788 --> 01:44:08,288
Param.
- Leave me.

1532
01:44:08,637 --> 01:44:09,639
Param.

1533
01:44:19,261 --> 01:44:23,379
Harpreet. Harp.

1534
01:44:23,999 --> 01:44:26,375
Oh my God. Param bro.

1535
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:30,210
Oh bloody Aaru Greetings.
- Greetings.

1536
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:31,110
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1537
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,146
You are in London.
You did not inform me.

1538
01:44:33,236 --> 01:44:36,105
It was worth keeping it a secret.
- What?

1539
01:44:36,405 --> 01:44:38,881
I mean,
everything happened quickly.

1540
01:44:38,971 --> 01:44:41,503
You smell of Punjab.

1541
01:44:41,593 --> 01:44:44,403
Still? I have also have
had a bath after coming.

1542
01:44:44,748 --> 01:44:46,444
He is such a funny guy.

1543
01:44:46,534 --> 01:44:49,867
We really want to chat a lot,
but I have to drop him to work.

1544
01:44:49,957 --> 01:44:51,183
So, give me your number?

1545
01:44:51,273 --> 01:44:53,055
Oh very good,
we too will come along.

1546
01:44:53,295 --> 01:44:56,576
We will chat, will gossip,
Let’s see, let’s go, Heathrow.

1547
01:45:10,955 --> 01:45:12,427
Brother, if you don’t mind,
can I tell you something?

1548
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:17,480
I agree no work, is big or small.

1549
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:20,680
But you have a land in the village.

1550
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:23,093
Then also you are doing this.

1551
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,929
If an uneducated man comes here,

1552
01:45:27,727 --> 01:45:29,653
then these people won’t make him
the president directly.

1553
01:45:30,356 --> 01:45:33,623
So have to do whatever job I get.

1554
01:45:38,483 --> 01:45:43,687
Means everyone who comes to London
doesn’t have a story like this.

1555
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,689
Yes maybe better than this too.

1556
01:45:48,397 --> 01:45:50,074
Or worse than this too.

1557
01:45:51,325 --> 01:45:53,843
But the bad story
does not reach our country.

1558
01:45:54,717 --> 01:45:57,169
Or people like Gurnaam
don’t let them reach.

1559
01:46:04,785 --> 01:46:05,842
Hello.

1560
01:46:10,524 --> 01:46:11,675
Jasmeet, let’s go.

1561
01:46:32,794 --> 01:46:36,060
My daughter died. My daughter died.

1562
01:46:41,342 --> 01:46:42,631
I am doing things for them for them

1563
01:46:43,478 --> 01:46:46,235
whom I have never seen them alive.

1564
01:46:47,518 --> 01:46:49,300
Are you worried about youself?

1565
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:00,948
If you are waiting for
one more bad news from home.

1566
01:47:01,038 --> 01:47:02,456
No brother.

1567
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:05,490
Brother Iqbal.

1568
01:47:06,636 --> 01:47:09,769
Coming to London, working hard,
earning money.

1569
01:47:10,938 --> 01:47:12,582
There is nothing wrong in that.

1570
01:47:14,204 --> 01:47:16,745
This city respects people
who work hard.

1571
01:47:19,036 --> 01:47:21,476
But someone who has come illegally,

1572
01:47:22,705 --> 01:47:24,211
there is no respect anywhere.

1573
01:47:26,404 --> 01:47:27,605
Nowhere.

1574
01:47:51,796 --> 01:47:53,678
Iqbal brother, don’t look behind.

1575
01:47:54,209 --> 01:47:56,135
A real man is the one
who after everything

1576
01:47:56,225 --> 01:47:57,967
still has the courage
to walk ahead.

1577
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:01,620
It's home coming not a farewell.

1578
01:48:02,893 --> 01:48:04,348
What is the use of the tears?

1579
01:48:38,975 --> 01:48:40,890
Param. Hi.

1580
01:48:41,404 --> 01:48:43,176
You both are so happy to meet me

1581
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:44,565
that you forgot
to invite me inside.

1582
01:48:44,655 --> 01:48:45,893
Sorry, come in.

1583
01:48:47,106 --> 01:48:49,365
Wow, what a house?

1584
01:48:49,763 --> 01:48:52,212
Sam, after seeing your house,
I can understand why,

1585
01:48:52,302 --> 01:48:54,935
people are desperate to come
to London.

1586
01:48:55,025 --> 01:48:57,658
I thought you will be busy
preparing for your wedding.

1587
01:48:57,748 --> 01:49:00,542
I will have to come to you
for the wedding.

1588
01:49:00,885 --> 01:49:02,214
Don’t tell me,
she is the number one

1589
01:49:02,304 --> 01:49:03,276
wedding planner of your village.

1590
01:49:03,785 --> 01:49:07,687
No, she played a very
important role in my first wedding.

1591
01:49:07,777 --> 01:49:09,459
So it must be for the second too.

1592
01:49:10,892 --> 01:49:14,634
I want my second wedding should be
as challenging as the first one.

1593
01:49:14,724 --> 01:49:15,602
What?

1594
01:49:15,692 --> 01:49:16,786
Can I sit?

1595
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,535
You too sit, it’s your own house.
You forgot?

1596
01:49:21,105 --> 01:49:21,996
Jasmeet.

1597
01:49:22,086 --> 01:49:23,667
Yes Jasmeet sit.

1598
01:49:25,316 --> 01:49:26,960
Jasmeet you remember my wedding.

1599
01:49:28,227 --> 01:49:30,657
The most beautiful day of my life.

1600
01:49:31,692 --> 01:49:35,516
The girl whom I loved 100%,
I was going to marry her.

1601
01:49:37,614 --> 01:49:39,429
I remember,
she was looking so beautiful.

1602
01:49:40,015 --> 01:49:41,482
Hold on, let me get this right.

1603
01:49:42,838 --> 01:49:44,819
You want, your second marriage,

1604
01:49:45,218 --> 01:49:47,183
to remind you
of your first wedding?

1605
01:49:47,724 --> 01:49:49,313
My tomorrow is also a part of me.

1606
01:49:50,874 --> 01:49:54,050
Wherever I am today,
is because of tomorrow.

1607
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:56,807
And I never want to forget that.

1608
01:49:58,567 --> 01:50:00,842
I want Alisha to look exactly
like my first bride.

1609
01:50:01,058 --> 01:50:02,917
Make her wear the same clothes.

1610
01:50:03,565 --> 01:50:05,137
The same ambience,
the same atmosphere.

1611
01:50:05,386 --> 01:50:06,947
The same invitation card.

1612
01:50:07,107 --> 01:50:10,815
The same feast.
Everything same to same.

1613
01:50:11,092 --> 01:50:12,714
You must have
remembered everything.

1614
01:50:14,435 --> 01:50:17,801
Sam won’t you offer a drink
to Param.

1615
01:50:18,332 --> 01:50:19,816
Yes of course. What will you have?

1616
01:50:19,906 --> 01:50:22,423
Bring anything bro,
you have good taste.

1617
01:50:27,692 --> 01:50:29,696
If it’s a drama,
then why all these preparations?

1618
01:50:31,014 --> 01:50:34,340
If its drama, then why so much pain
in arranging all this.

1619
01:50:35,734 --> 01:50:36,841
Here you go.

1620
01:50:36,931 --> 01:50:38,374
Thank you.

1621
01:50:39,398 --> 01:50:41,092
Cheers.
- Cheers to a happy married life

1622
01:50:41,247 --> 01:50:42,698
and this one being the last.

1623
01:50:48,042 --> 01:50:49,609
Okay I am leaving.

1624
01:50:49,699 --> 01:50:51,723
Jasmeet I will see you tomorrow.
Done.

1625
01:50:52,802 --> 01:50:54,302
Take care.
- Take care. See you, man.

1626
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:02,761
Do you know Alisha, I did not wear
a suit on my first wedding.

1627
01:51:03,369 --> 01:51:05,019
God has fulfilled that desire.

1628
01:51:07,383 --> 01:51:09,797
Jasmeet. We will take black suit.

1629
01:51:09,887 --> 01:51:13,200
If she sees him in a suit then
will not divorce him for 7 years.

1630
01:51:14,016 --> 01:51:15,875
Silver, let’s buy a silver one.

1631
01:51:16,097 --> 01:51:18,322
I want to like a groom
not a pomfret fish.

1632
01:51:18,765 --> 01:51:20,741
If you don’t approve of my choice,
then why did you call me?

1633
01:51:20,831 --> 01:51:23,277
But I want my groom in black.

1634
01:51:24,278 --> 01:51:26,669
You have got your groom in black.

1635
01:51:26,759 --> 01:51:29,732
This connection is called black.
Isn’t it Jasmeet?

1636
01:51:29,822 --> 01:51:31,775
It’s your wedding you should know.

1637
01:51:32,284 --> 01:51:34,891
You must have had the experience.

1638
01:51:35,683 --> 01:51:38,849
I am buying a silver suit.
Don’t waste my time by chatting.

1639
01:51:39,712 --> 01:51:42,663
Should I buy black shoes or
wear golden and become a mermaid.

1640
01:51:43,035 --> 01:51:44,135
Mermaid?

1641
01:51:44,302 --> 01:51:46,051
Mermaid baby.

1642
01:51:46,827 --> 01:51:49,445
You are so sweet.
- That I am.

1643
01:51:50,386 --> 01:51:52,207
You have to give me
a discount please.

1644
01:51:52,297 --> 01:51:53,486
It’s already discounted.

1645
01:51:53,576 --> 01:51:56,375
She is asking for a discount
on her husband’s wedding suit.

1646
01:51:58,456 --> 01:51:59,691
She is looking nice.

1647
01:52:01,113 --> 01:52:03,137
But not like you.

1648
01:52:03,708 --> 01:52:06,820
No. 8 on 10.

1649
01:52:11,001 --> 01:52:12,148
Is she your friend?

1650
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:14,074
That you are rating her.
8 out of 10.

1651
01:52:14,164 --> 01:52:15,589
She is your rival.

1652
01:52:15,818 --> 01:52:17,833
What are you laughing for?
 If you were a real Punjabi...

1653
01:52:17,923 --> 01:52:19,103
...you would have jumped
on her by now.

1654
01:52:19,193 --> 01:52:21,074
Fighting with her,
pulling her hair.

1655
01:52:21,164 --> 01:52:23,491
Tore her clothes. You are laughing?
- What happened?

1656
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:25,577
Am I looking stupid?

1657
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,711
No not at all,

1658
01:52:27,801 --> 01:52:29,730
he keeps making me laugh
all the time.

1659
01:52:31,670 --> 01:52:33,083
She has gone in flash back.

1660
01:52:34,283 --> 01:52:36,028
Alisha you look very pretty.

1661
01:52:36,118 --> 01:52:39,446
If my first wife was here
she would have given you 8 on 10.

1662
01:52:43,816 --> 01:52:45,158
Baby.
- Come baby.

1663
01:52:45,248 --> 01:52:49,153
Thank you. - Actually not 8 out
of 10, you should get 10 on 10.

1664
01:53:00,087 --> 01:53:01,264
No she isn’t laughing.

1665
01:53:03,151 --> 01:53:05,667
But she isn’t wrestling also.

1666
01:53:11,224 --> 01:53:12,402
This is good.

1667
01:53:12,544 --> 01:53:15,457
The card should be simple
at the second wedding.

1668
01:53:15,547 --> 01:53:17,697
Jasmeet, it’s my first marriage.

1669
01:53:19,008 --> 01:53:19,871
Yes.

1670
01:53:21,625 --> 01:53:26,818
The card should be exactly the way
it was on our first wedding.

1671
01:53:28,488 --> 01:53:30,534
I mean my first wedding.

1672
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:35,210
You had made me write an oath
on that card, Jasmeet.

1673
01:53:37,779 --> 01:53:39,036
Do you remember the oath?

1674
01:53:40,506 --> 01:53:43,066
My husband,
my groom lives immortally.

1675
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:50,518
Never ending.

1676
01:53:52,248 --> 01:53:53,590
Never dying.

1677
01:53:55,828 --> 01:53:57,029
Beautiful.

1678
01:53:58,518 --> 01:54:00,145
What does that mean Jasmeet?

1679
01:54:02,703 --> 01:54:04,247
She just remembers the words.

1680
01:54:04,868 --> 01:54:06,617
She has forgotten
the meaning long ago.

1681
01:54:10,027 --> 01:54:13,399
My husband,
my groom lives immortally.

1682
01:54:14,776 --> 01:54:18,928
Never ending. Never dying.

1683
01:54:21,209 --> 01:54:22,914
The one who never abandons me.

1684
01:54:36,242 --> 01:54:37,842
Jasmeet.
- Sam.

1685
01:54:38,544 --> 01:54:41,566
I can understand everything
that you are trying to do.

1686
01:54:41,998 --> 01:54:44,467
You think I am a simpleton
from some village

1687
01:54:44,557 --> 01:54:47,710
whom you will not give residency
and I will keep tolerating quietly.

1688
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:50,033
And finally I will have
to obey you.

1689
01:54:52,193 --> 01:54:53,761
You will get residency tomorrow.

1690
01:54:57,570 --> 01:54:59,169
There is an interview
at the home department.

1691
01:54:59,512 --> 01:55:01,876
After that you can stay here
as long as you want.

1692
01:55:02,445 --> 01:55:03,525
Alone.

1693
01:55:06,308 --> 01:55:08,401
Can I give you the flowers
and open champagne,

1694
01:55:08,491 --> 01:55:09,895
or you still want to scold me?

1695
01:55:12,293 --> 01:55:15,038
No, I want to make a call.

1696
01:55:19,737 --> 01:55:21,863
'Oh west minister abbey.'

1697
01:55:22,416 --> 01:55:23,446
'Should I tell you something?'

1698
01:55:23,536 --> 01:55:25,034
'Whenever I see this place,'

1699
01:55:25,124 --> 01:55:27,823
'I feel like going to London
and seeing this place with you.'

1700
01:55:32,578 --> 01:55:36,929
'The place where 2 real lovers
walk hand in hand.'

1701
01:55:51,437 --> 01:55:53,246
And now may I kiss the bride.

1702
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:13,206
Param stop this wedding.

1703
01:56:14,490 --> 01:56:16,510
I am getting
the residency tomorrow.

1704
01:56:17,407 --> 01:56:19,493
Now there is no need of this drama.

1705
01:56:23,313 --> 01:56:26,591
Whether others understand or not,
I thought you would understand.

1706
01:56:26,681 --> 01:56:28,323
Why I am marrying, Jasmeet.

1707
01:56:29,541 --> 01:56:31,661
Param, the destination
is very near.

1708
01:56:33,034 --> 01:56:34,224
Please wait till tomorrow.

1709
01:56:36,893 --> 01:56:41,377
To harm each other today, thinking
that tomorrow will be better.

1710
01:56:44,997 --> 01:56:48,157
There can’t be anything more stupid
in than this in the world, Jasmeet.

1711
01:56:48,247 --> 01:56:51,157
It can’t be.
- "The heart is stubborn."

1712
01:56:51,301 --> 01:56:53,985
"It doesn’t listen."
- what are you talking?

1713
01:56:54,149 --> 01:56:57,343
Param.
- "To the troubles."

1714
01:56:57,433 --> 01:57:02,861
"The heart is stubborn.
It doesn’t listen."

1715
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:06,504
"To the troubles."

1716
01:57:06,594 --> 01:57:14,082
"I try to convince it, and
appease it a million times."

1717
01:57:14,172 --> 01:57:20,938
"But still
the insistent heart says."

1718
01:57:21,028 --> 01:57:28,332
"You are its desire.
You are its yearning."

1719
01:57:28,422 --> 01:57:31,853
"My heart is an island."

1720
01:57:32,008 --> 01:57:35,609
"You are the ocean surrounding it."

1721
01:57:35,699 --> 01:57:42,128
"What should I do?"

1722
01:57:42,986 --> 01:57:49,663
"Should I live or die?"

1723
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:57,066
"What should I do?
What should I do?"

1724
01:57:57,539 --> 01:58:05,032
"You tell me, what should I do?"

1725
01:58:23,366 --> 01:58:26,798
"My heart is saying."

1726
01:58:26,888 --> 01:58:30,644
"Life is night,
and you are the light."

1727
01:58:30,734 --> 01:58:33,765
"The heart lives in."

1728
01:58:34,173 --> 01:58:37,950
"The world of dreams
that is occupied by you."

1729
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,163
"The heart is suffering."

1730
01:58:41,507 --> 01:58:45,298
"The season of loneliness,
in which you are not there."

1731
01:58:45,388 --> 01:58:48,305
"The heart is flowing."

1732
01:58:48,770 --> 01:58:52,617
"In the river of pain,
in which it is flowing."

1733
01:58:52,707 --> 01:58:59,756
"All the helplessness
have distanced."

1734
01:59:00,155 --> 01:59:06,476
"But the heart still insists."

1735
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:14,353
"You are its desire.
You are its yearnings."

1736
01:59:14,443 --> 01:59:18,000
"My heart is an island."

1737
01:59:18,090 --> 01:59:21,714
"You are the ocean surrounding it."

1738
01:59:21,804 --> 01:59:27,803
"What should I do about my heart?
What should I do?"

1739
01:59:28,952 --> 01:59:36,319
"Should I live or die?"

1740
01:59:36,409 --> 01:59:43,012
"What should I do?
What should I do?"

1741
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:49,135
We are waiting for you
miss Jasmeet. Please come in.

1742
01:59:53,752 --> 02:00:00,744
"What should I do?
What should I do?"

1743
02:00:00,834 --> 02:00:06,583
"What should I do?"

1744
02:00:14,758 --> 02:00:15,854
I am married.

1745
02:00:17,691 --> 02:00:20,869
Param and me.

1746
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:22,800
I knew it.

1747
02:00:25,441 --> 02:00:26,703
Because if you went married

1748
02:00:27,943 --> 02:00:29,704
then you could not have resisted
my charm.

1749
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:33,368
Now, go, to him.

1750
02:00:46,995 --> 02:00:49,237
Excuse me. Where is the wedding?

1751
02:00:50,703 --> 02:00:51,938
My wedding.

1752
02:00:55,812 --> 02:00:58,148
Did you really think,
Param would do something like this?

1753
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:01,629
I know he is your husband.

1754
02:01:02,829 --> 02:01:05,901
He told me the day I met him.

1755
02:01:08,022 --> 02:01:09,527
Param can be duped,

1756
02:01:11,371 --> 02:01:12,533
but he can’t dupe.

1757
02:01:13,148 --> 02:01:14,753
'I will fulfill my promise Alisha.'

1758
02:01:17,964 --> 02:01:19,443
'I will just do the ceremony
but not the vows.'

1759
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:21,358
'I will not be able to say them.'

1760
02:01:23,904 --> 02:01:25,985
'Because my heart and life
is somewhere else.'

1761
02:01:27,204 --> 02:01:31,466
'Who will take second hand love
from such a loving person?'

1762
02:01:33,176 --> 02:01:36,952
'Go, you are hers for 7 lives.'

1763
02:01:37,911 --> 02:01:40,811
'Then it’s my chance. Promise.'

1764
02:01:41,808 --> 02:01:43,297
'And I will not let you break it
this time.'

1765
02:01:45,783 --> 02:01:47,089
'Thank you.'

1766
02:02:15,105 --> 02:02:17,955
'I never thought that one day
the city will win and I will lose.'

1767
02:02:18,951 --> 02:02:20,584
'But I was wrong.'

1768
02:02:21,962 --> 02:02:23,268
'I made one more mistake.'

1769
02:02:24,227 --> 02:02:25,699
'To come here illegally.'

1770
02:02:26,668 --> 02:02:28,538
'I am going to rectify
that Jasmeet.'

1771
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:32,358
'I am going to Indian Embassy
and getting myself deported.'

1772
02:02:43,533 --> 02:02:44,541
Param.

1773
02:02:46,739 --> 02:02:49,235
Param, you haven’t lost.
You never lost.

1774
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:51,865
The minute I saw you, I realized

1775
02:02:51,955 --> 02:02:55,308
that I have made such a big mistake
of coming to London like this.

1776
02:02:56,249 --> 02:02:59,775
To cover up that mistake
I kept making more mistakes.

1777
02:02:59,865 --> 02:03:02,457
I felt when everything
will become alright,

1778
02:03:02,547 --> 02:03:04,217
we will forget all this.

1779
02:03:05,771 --> 02:03:06,928
But...

1780
02:03:08,423 --> 02:03:10,360
But I was cracking from inside.

1781
02:03:12,242 --> 02:03:16,564
I cannot forget that
I am doing so wrong with you.

1782
02:03:17,816 --> 02:03:20,289
I was doing so wrong
to Sam and Alisha.

1783
02:03:21,003 --> 02:03:24,445
The country whose praises
I was happy to hear.

1784
02:03:25,392 --> 02:03:27,213
I was doing so wrong with it.

1785
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:31,708
Param I have realized.

1786
02:03:34,309 --> 02:03:35,964
London is very nice.

1787
02:03:36,894 --> 02:03:41,317
But now London has
no meaning for me.

1788
02:03:43,973 --> 02:03:45,761
I want my Param.

1789
02:03:47,881 --> 02:03:49,331
I have understood

1790
02:03:50,770 --> 02:03:53,953
which city we live,
it makes no difference.

1791
02:03:55,719 --> 02:04:00,219
With whom we live,
and how much he loves us.

1792
02:04:00,856 --> 02:04:03,020
Only that matters.

1793
02:04:10,089 --> 02:04:11,888
What was the need to go so long.

1794
02:04:13,211 --> 02:04:14,733
You could have just hugged me
and said sorry.

1795
02:04:16,819 --> 02:04:17,710
You know that.

1796
02:04:18,165 --> 02:04:20,685
When you hug me,

1797
02:04:21,914 --> 02:04:25,181
so many naughty, naughty thoughts
run in my mind, girl.

1798
02:04:25,983 --> 02:04:27,583
Come into my arms.

1799
02:04:32,532 --> 02:04:34,524
'Girl, get ready.'

1800
02:04:35,205 --> 02:04:37,464
'We have a bigger war
to fight in Punjab.'

1801
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:40,275
'We will fulfill your first dream.'

1802
02:04:41,831 --> 02:04:45,747
'I promise you, I will
surely convince grandfather.'
