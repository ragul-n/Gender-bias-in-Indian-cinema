1
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:59,270
Neeli...

2
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:04,729
Neeli, open your eyes and look at me.

3
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,770
Grief ages even a creature like me.

4
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:18,520
Tell me...

5
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:21,395
What am I?

6
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:24,354
Who am I?

7
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:31,604
What curse
have I brought down upon myself?

8
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:41,979
Neeli...

9
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:48,770
How many times
must I tell you this tale again?

10
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,312
Neeli...

11
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:12,104
A long time ago,
this was my home.

12
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,895
And once, this was my country.

13
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:21,562
Did we beat them back, Umber?

14
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,895
Yes, but they'll be back.

15
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:28,951
Well done!

16
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,104
You killed one of them.

17
00:05:34,823 --> 00:05:37,823
Why are you bringing this dead Muslim
into our village?

18
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:40,531
What are you doing, my son?

19
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:44,823
Don't do it.
Don't poison our waters.

20
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:48,031
You'll bring down a curse on our village.

21
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:50,489
It's not our village anymore.

22
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:53,906
I'll leave them their own ghosts
to haunt them.

23
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,323
A true Sikh would never do this.
- We are nothing now.

24
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:04,073
Shall we get the women
back to the village?

25
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,198
It'll be safer in the morning.

26
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,864
Congratulations!

27
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,403
Here Mehar, take your daughter.

28
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,111
A daughter is also a blessing.

29
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:03,736
It's safe now!
The women can return to the village!

30
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,195
We can go back!
It's safe to go back to the village now!

31
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,586
Will you be all right?
- Yes. You go.

32
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,795
Tell my husband I'm here.
-Yes, I'll tell Umber.

33
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,157
Mehar! Mehar!

34
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,253
She's still back there.

35
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:03,586
Papaji!

36
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:07,427
Papaji!

37
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,420
Don't you want to see your daughter?

38
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:39,753
I've seen enough girls.

39
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,128
I'll get the cart for you.

40
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,753
Take care of yourself.

41
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:03,461
We managed
to hold off their attack last night.

42
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:11,069
But how long can we survive?

43
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:14,277
What will we do now?

44
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:22,277
The elders say the whole village
has to leave by this evening.

45
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:26,194
Are you ready to leave?

46
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,944
By evening we'll have to leave.

47
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:51,485
Listen, we cannot take much with us.

48
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:56,110
Are you sure you want to take me?

49
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:00,569
You are my wife.

50
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:34,569
Leave it open.

51
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,444
I don't want them
to break into our house.

52
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:44,332
You take care of the children.
I'll be back. Go!

53
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:54,194
Now, poison your own people.

54
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:44,078
The Partition had scattered us
like birds in a storm.

55
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:54,078
It took me four years
to get back on my feet.

56
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:07,036
They've brought you what they looted
from those who fled to Pakistan.

57
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,578
Have a look...

58
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:38,036
These will look good in your new home!

59
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:29,286
Papaji, is this for me?

60
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:34,620
Tomorrow we'll go to the jeweller
and get earrings for all of you.

61
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:40,328
We'll soon get back all your gold
that went into this house.

62
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:44,245
The house still needs a lot of work.
We'll worry about the gold later.

63
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,536
Let me worry about that.

64
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,370
What do you want to do
with your parents' house?

65
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,703
You are never going to go there.
It's so far away.

66
00:15:57,977 --> 00:16:00,203
You know Uncle Keerath wants it.

67
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,261
He'll never pay what it's worth.

68
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:10,745
I'd love
to take the children there one day.

69
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:16,370
Show them
what their mother's home was like!

70
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:21,123
It could help us
with the girls' dowry later.

71
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,828
Oh, their younger brother is on his way.
He will take care of that.

72
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:29,603
I'm not going back to the forest.

73
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:34,103
Until he is born
I will stay here with you.

74
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:40,019
It will be a girl again.

75
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,811
You'll see, this time it will be a boy.

76
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,394
Why have you come in?

77
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,811
You'll kill me if it isn't a boy?

78
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:17,353
Once more like a true lioness!

79
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:21,519
Be brave like a true Sikh!
You've already had three children!

80
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:25,478
She doesn't want to come into this world.

81
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,353
With more force.

82
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:38,811
Good.

83
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,478
Good.

84
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,356
Good.

85
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,815
Good.

86
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,329
Good.

87
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,853
Oh! Very good!
Congratulations!

88
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,811
Look, Mehar!

89
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:08,144
A son's come to our home!

90
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:11,436
You've had a boy!

91
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:17,936
Here, look!

92
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:22,269
Look!

93
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:28,019
After three daughters, we've had a son.

94
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,394
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

95
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:36,998
You need to rest.

96
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:41,136
Don't do this.

97
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,811
It's better to kill her.

98
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,728
What are you saying?

99
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:46,936
We finally have a son.

100
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,764
She's so beautiful.

101
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,561
My son!

102
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:59,894
My son!

103
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:40,986
Kanwar, come down!

104
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,486
Come down.

105
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,444
Come and bathe!

106
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:50,069
Papaji!

107
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:52,194
Come, come!

108
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:55,444
My moon!

109
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,236
Papaji!

110
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,194
Pull it up!

111
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:01,819
Pull.

112
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:13,156
Give it back!
Give me back my spool!

113
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:16,659
Pull.

114
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:18,448
Papaji!

115
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:20,310
Hold this...
- Papaji!

116
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:24,084
Kulbir and Sohni!
They ran off with my kite-spool!

117
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,388
I don't ever want to see you
crying like a girl!

118
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:29,308
Be a man and get it back!

119
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,695
Go!

120
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:06,144
Tall as a tree and still peeing in bed!

121
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:10,602
All of you old enough to be married
and have your own children!

122
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:14,477
Will you be doing the same
at your in-laws?

123
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,269
You'll bring nothing but shame on us!

124
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:19,602
Worthless girls!

125
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,336
Straighten it!

126
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,100
Mother, mother.
- Yes.

127
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:27,269
Shall we go?
- Get going!

128
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:28,769
Let's go

129
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:32,685
We'll sing Lohri

130
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:40,378
Today is our day
And every home waits for us.

131
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:46,519
We'll get sweets and money!

132
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:11,227
Kulbir look!
-That's Kanwar.

133
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:13,519
How did he get here?

134
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:15,034
Brother Kanwar?

135
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,227
Kanwar!
How did you get here?

136
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,644
Come down!

137
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:23,477
Come down.

138
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:26,810
Let's go!

139
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,519
You're such a rat!

140
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:35,019
Hurry up!

141
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:41,060
You always get us in trouble.

142
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,435
Tell me, why did you pee on my bed?

143
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:49,477
Why did you steal my spool?
- What's so special about you?

144
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:52,227
Let me see!
- Let me go!

145
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,852
Let me see!
-I want to see.

146
00:25:57,938 --> 00:25:59,003
Kanwar!

147
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:38,019
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

148
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:39,611
Bye.

149
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:02,435
Kulbir, come here.
Come here!

150
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:05,080
Come here!

151
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:07,578
Come here!

152
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,210
Come here!

153
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:12,808
Get up!

154
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,667
Mother.
- Mother.

155
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:25,144
Come here.
Come here.

156
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:38,440
Come here!

157
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,374
Mother.

158
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:40,343
Come here!

159
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:42,322
Come here!

160
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,352
Mehar! Stop!

161
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:46,894
Stay out of this!

162
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:49,269
Leave! Get out!

163
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:03,306
If anything happens to my son,

164
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:05,469
I'll cut them to pieces!

165
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:41,858
Greetings, child!

166
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,775
Our village's champion wrestler.

167
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:49,775
He's going to make you strong as iron.
- Hello, Sir.

168
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:53,858
God bless you, son.

169
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:58,525
Turn this way

170
00:28:59,983 --> 00:29:03,441
Let him take a look
just to check there are no twisted bones.

171
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:09,316
After your turban ceremony,

172
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:11,525
I'll take you hunting.

173
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:12,816
Hunting?

174
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:16,816
We're going to shoot bears.

175
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:22,525
Look what I've got for you.

176
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:25,441
Hold it.

177
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:28,941
He's fine.

178
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:33,983
I'm going to make you
as strong as a lion.

179
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,775
What a brave boy my son has become!

180
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,125
I'm so proud of you.

181
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,916
Come here.

182
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,375
Pull this up.

183
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:34,125
Always keep this cloth tightly tied.

184
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,500
Never forget it.

185
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,958
Once again.

186
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:53,809
Papaji!

187
00:31:55,474 --> 00:31:56,749
Papaji!

188
00:31:57,538 --> 00:31:58,705
Yes, son?

189
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:00,750
Blood.

190
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:02,621
Blood?

191
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:07,455
Did you hurt yourself when you fell?

192
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:18,746
How old are you now?

193
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:20,830
Twelve.

194
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,288
You've grown so quickly, my son.

195
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:34,788
So quickly you've grown.

196
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:42,080
Now you've become a real man.
Don't worry.

197
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:49,038
Kanwar,

198
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:54,996
don't tell your mother about it.

199
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:35,009
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

200
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:42,393
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

201
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:48,955
All pain will be assuaged, O Mother!

202
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:56,075
Teach your son to walk like a fragrance!

203
00:33:56,155 --> 00:34:00,134
Your son!

204
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:09,841
Teach him to walk like a fragrance!

205
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:16,966
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

206
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:24,338
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

207
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:46,915
I walk the path of clouds

208
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:54,364
A son is born into my home! O, I fly!

209
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:57,330
A son in my home!

210
00:34:57,607 --> 00:35:02,926
A moon glimmers in my home!

211
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,288
My son, my moon!

212
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:10,788
I fly! I fly!

213
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:19,973
A boy has come to my home, I fly!

214
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,538
Kanwar!

215
00:36:57,845 --> 00:36:59,988
Neeli, wait!
-No, I have to go.

216
00:37:00,612 --> 00:37:02,353
Neeli!

217
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:14,007
Your favourite dessert tonight!

218
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:08,655
I've been singing for you
since you were born.

219
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,915
I also sang at your turban ceremony.

220
00:38:24,147 --> 00:38:27,152
Neeli, look!

221
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,939
What have you found to rob?

222
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:28,064
Your own people will kill you!
- You think I've come to rob your palace?

223
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,213
Let's see.

224
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:46,189
What a great hunter!
Show it to me.

225
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,564
The daughter of a gypsy
has come to whore herself?

226
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,183
Don't even try.
You'll never be able to catch me.

227
00:40:55,464 --> 00:40:57,314
Run and we'll see.

228
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:02,273
Do you always talk like this?

229
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:05,648
Like what?
- Like you smell shit all around you.

230
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,940
I wanted to say sorry for slapping you.

231
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:11,519
Now, I feel like slapping you again.

232
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:14,648
So ask me to forgive you.

233
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:29,033
Have you ever sat in a truck before?
Or are you just a know-all?

234
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,482
Yes, many times.

235
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,509
Fine.

236
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:36,677
But I always sat in the back.
Never in the front!

237
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:42,607
Come on.

238
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:44,815
Today you sit in the front.

239
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:06,565
I also want to drive a truck.

240
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:08,773
Will you teach me?

241
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,440
No.

242
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,598
Have you ever gone hunting?

243
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:41,682
When do girls ever go hunting?

244
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:43,807
What nonsense you talk!

245
00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:47,523
My father killed a deer once.

246
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:50,598
And the whole village feasted on it!

247
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,890
I've killed bears.

248
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:59,140
The first time I was so scared.

249
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:02,506
It was father who had to shoot the bear.

250
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,598
He was very upset with me.

251
00:43:07,944 --> 00:43:10,848
But my second bear
I killed with one shot.

252
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:17,473
One night, it came to my cabin door.

253
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:23,554
And kept scratching
my door with its claws.

254
00:43:33,262 --> 00:43:35,515
It made no other sound.

255
00:43:45,348 --> 00:43:48,140
I stood here with my rifle.

256
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,682
Then I heard something.

257
00:43:52,494 --> 00:43:54,098
It felt like the bear was going away.

258
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:57,557
I opened the door.

259
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:01,067
But there it was.

260
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:05,775
It jumped up on its two feet

261
00:44:06,192 --> 00:44:07,859
and rushed at me.

262
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,192
I shot into the dark of its mouth.

263
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:17,859
Are you afraid of the dark?

264
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,025
Not at all.

265
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:32,400
Let's see, my brave one...

266
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:43,620
I am off, then.

267
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:46,567
Stay and cry here all night.

268
00:44:49,025 --> 00:44:50,400
I'm going.

269
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:26,150
What's happening there?

270
00:45:26,317 --> 00:45:29,317
A gypsy girl has been missing
since last night.

271
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:31,734
I'll send some of my men into the forest.

272
00:45:32,138 --> 00:45:34,150
You come with me.

273
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,525
Don't worry.

274
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,275
I'm with you.
We'll find your daughter.

275
00:45:56,861 --> 00:45:58,483
I hope the night wasn't too scary.

276
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:04,540
If you misbehave again,

277
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:08,517
I'll leave you locked up here forever.

278
00:46:09,048 --> 00:46:10,309
Now, get lost!

279
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,767
I told you to go.

280
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:15,225
Your father is searching for you.

281
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,600
Come, let's go.

282
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:24,809
You have to marry me now.
- What?

283
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:27,225
You have to marry me now.

284
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:29,620
Or my family will kill me.

285
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:31,475
And you, too.

286
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:36,517
It's the only way
they can redeem their honour.

287
00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:40,184
I didn't do anything.

288
00:46:40,852 --> 00:46:42,517
They won't believe that.

289
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,392
You tell them.

290
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:48,475
They won't believe me.
-Look...

291
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:52,895
My father will fix everything.

292
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:57,847
If this had happened to your sisters,
what would your Papaji do then?

293
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:16,100
I was born under an inauspicious star.

294
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,684
It's not my destiny to marry.

295
00:47:22,203 --> 00:47:26,192
A wife like me
could change your destiny.

296
00:47:33,802 --> 00:47:36,934
That really scared you, didn't it?

297
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:46,934
So you think you scared me?
-Of course, I did!

298
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:57,582
Let go of me!
You dog! You bully!

299
00:47:57,662 --> 00:47:59,359
Get off me!

300
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:08,396
Let go of me!
You dog! You bully!

301
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:10,494
Get off me!

302
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:15,219
Get off me!

303
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:17,934
Kanwar!

304
00:48:26,076 --> 00:48:29,951
Tarlok, wait! Please wait.

305
00:48:41,368 --> 00:48:45,326
I request
your daughter's hand for my son.

306
00:48:46,368 --> 00:48:47,826
My daughter?

307
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:52,784
My Neeli?
-Yes.

308
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,534
You are a great, honourable man.

309
00:48:58,993 --> 00:49:01,409
Oh, we are relatives now!

310
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:22,034
My son has become a man.

311
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:28,743
A man?

312
00:49:32,776 --> 00:49:34,494
Papaji!

313
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:47,159
My brave son!

314
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,951
Serve some milk to Kanwar.

315
00:49:58,618 --> 00:50:00,993
Child, you come with me.

316
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,363
Eat!

317
00:50:28,957 --> 00:50:30,951
Why don't you dance?

318
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:34,401
You should have told me the truth
before the wedding.

319
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,276
Now you're the queen of this mansion.

320
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:43,276
Whatever you want you will get.
Clothes, jewellery...

321
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:46,818
Everything in this house is yours.

322
00:50:57,252 --> 00:51:00,647
We have no tradition of the veil
in this house.

323
00:51:01,651 --> 00:51:04,222
You should have kept the tradition
for your son.

324
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:07,276
You... shut up!

325
00:51:08,053 --> 00:51:09,526
What are you saying?

326
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:16,151
Take off your veil.

327
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:20,852
Do you hear me?

328
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:37,151
You don't look stupid to me.

329
00:51:38,322 --> 00:51:41,652
I told you, Kanwar had an accident
when he was a boy.

330
00:51:43,036 --> 00:51:45,458
Nothing can be done about it now.

331
00:51:53,058 --> 00:51:54,496
Mehar.

332
00:52:02,258 --> 00:52:03,776
You speak to her.

333
00:52:09,901 --> 00:52:13,524
Let me go back to my home.
- Don't say that.

334
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:20,776
You think any married woman
can live like this?

335
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:26,651
Can you not live here as my daughter?

336
00:54:29,305 --> 00:54:30,513
Mehar...

337
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:37,472
This girl will do
whatever we ask her to do.

338
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:40,888
She'll accept everything as her destiny.

339
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:49,180
And Kanwar?

340
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:52,097
Tell me about his destiny.

341
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:55,088
How's this one?

342
00:55:55,255 --> 00:55:56,672
Beautiful?

343
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:04,755
Look at this one.

344
00:56:06,012 --> 00:56:08,228
How does this look?
- Very beautiful.

345
00:56:08,387 --> 00:56:09,868
Very beautiful, isn't it?

346
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:13,155
Let's buy this one.

347
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,447
Are you happy?

348
00:56:21,655 --> 00:56:24,679
When you have a son,
I'll buy you the whole shop.

349
00:56:37,863 --> 00:56:40,030
And how's our new bride?

350
00:56:42,113 --> 00:56:48,197
You know,
I was uprooted from my country and home.

351
00:56:49,655 --> 00:56:54,655
All the dreams of my ancestors
turned to ash.

352
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:03,280
It is only a wife...

353
00:57:06,197 --> 00:57:10,322
who can give you that which
no one can ever take away from you.

354
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,322
Everything comes to an end.

355
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,197
Nothing lasts.

356
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:38,155
If you manage to stay happy,

357
00:57:40,431 --> 00:57:42,441
Kanwar will be happy too.

358
00:57:52,658 --> 00:57:56,197
Without your mother,
you would never have been mine.

359
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:02,738
By giving you to me, your mother
rooted me to this earth again.

360
00:58:09,706 --> 00:58:15,780
And who could be a better son
to any father than you.

361
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:35,155
Come and eat.

362
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:51,280
Neeli?

363
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:15,046
Where are you going?

364
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:22,563
You are a part of my family.
Where are you going?

365
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:34,833
Our future is in your hands.

366
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:39,855
You cannot leave us and go.

367
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:41,438
Listen to me.

368
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:44,647
Kanwar!

369
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,697
What are you doing here?

370
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:53,614
Go away.

371
01:01:54,529 --> 01:01:55,656
Go.

372
01:01:56,205 --> 01:01:57,199
Kanwar!

373
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:58,697
Go away from here!

374
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:00,531
Go!

375
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:07,614
Go away from here, Kanwar!

376
01:02:08,248 --> 01:02:11,239
Understand... You...
Listen to me.

377
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:15,531
There is no other way.

378
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:17,822
Try to understand, son.

379
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:21,125
There is no other way.

380
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:27,492
There will be a son in your home...
in our home.

381
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:29,568
Go! Go!

382
01:03:33,085 --> 01:03:34,614
You're my son.

383
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,572
You're a good son.

384
01:03:44,468 --> 01:03:46,726
But you're a woman.

385
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,781
You are a girl.

386
01:03:52,423 --> 01:03:54,034
Papaji!

387
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:01,072
We'll have a son.

388
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,926
A real son.

389
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,412
Papaji!

390
01:05:04,695 --> 01:05:06,529
You should leave now.

391
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,570
There's gold and cash in the trunk.

392
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:13,779
And I've given the keys
of my father's house to Neeli.

393
01:05:14,435 --> 01:05:17,154
Why didn't you protect me
as you did my sisters?

394
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:23,904
I was also your child.

395
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:30,070
You should go.

396
01:05:30,237 --> 01:05:31,404
Go!

397
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:37,776
Go. You have a long journey.

398
01:05:39,612 --> 01:05:42,570
I have wanted so much
to sit and talk to you.

399
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,779
And now look,

400
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,862
you're sending me so far away from you.

401
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:01,987
I will come to you.

402
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:11,404
Now go!

403
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:14,154
Go!

404
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:15,819
Stop here.

405
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,404
Here are my clothes.

406
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,687
For you.

407
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:33,187
While on the train coming here,
I was thinking...

408
01:09:38,859 --> 01:09:40,354
You are free now.

409
01:09:44,261 --> 01:09:46,886
You can do whatever you want.

410
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:49,969
Forget your old life.

411
01:09:55,022 --> 01:09:57,178
Start anew here.

412
01:10:00,524 --> 01:10:02,303
Here, with me.

413
01:10:04,844 --> 01:10:07,011
You can be what you are.

414
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:25,844
It was all there.

415
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:30,761
I just never saw it.

416
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,678
Your face...

417
01:10:39,204 --> 01:10:41,178
Your eyes...

418
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:22,844
Neeli!

419
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:26,553
Come here...

420
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:34,636
Let me look at you.

421
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:55,636
I fell in love with a woman!

422
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:18,719
I, too, fell in love with a woman.

423
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:32,253
Come with me.

424
01:12:57,538 --> 01:12:58,836
Look...

425
01:13:01,063 --> 01:13:02,711
Look at this beautiful woman.

426
01:14:31,778 --> 01:14:35,028
You should have come
to Uncle Keerath first.

427
01:14:35,695 --> 01:14:39,278
You should have informed us.

428
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:42,231
Kanwar hasn't been too well.

429
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:44,814
What happened to him? Let's go see him.

430
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,856
Should we call a doctor?
- He doesn't really need a doctor.

431
01:14:50,272 --> 01:14:53,314
Let him rest then. We'll come later.
- Okay.

432
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:03,272
All right.

433
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:05,814
We'll come back later.

434
01:15:07,765 --> 01:15:09,419
Bye.
- Bye.

435
01:15:22,236 --> 01:15:24,777
How long can you hide like this?

436
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:29,027
It would be best...

437
01:15:29,444 --> 01:15:31,027
if I leave...

438
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,277
No, don't say that.

439
01:15:34,111 --> 01:15:36,236
What do we do then?

440
01:15:36,647 --> 01:15:38,986
How are we to live together?

441
01:15:40,722 --> 01:15:43,652
You've locked yourself in this house
and me too.

442
01:15:47,152 --> 01:15:51,361
Let Ma come,
then everything will be all right.

443
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:55,111
Nothing will be all right, Kanwar.

444
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:04,102
You can't leave me alone.

445
01:16:14,311 --> 01:16:16,561
I'll go and get Ma.

446
01:16:19,436 --> 01:16:21,644
We'll celebrate Lohri together.

447
01:16:34,144 --> 01:16:36,311
If we are to live together,

448
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,019
you have to accept...

449
01:16:41,811 --> 01:16:44,144
that you're a woman like me.

450
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:48,561
We are two women.

451
01:16:49,995 --> 01:16:51,269
Friends.

452
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:54,769
Sisters.

453
01:16:56,186 --> 01:16:58,311
I put on women's clothes...

454
01:16:59,852 --> 01:17:03,936
it feels like
I've got scorpions all over me.

455
01:17:05,852 --> 01:17:09,019
I no longer know who I am,

456
01:17:10,186 --> 01:17:11,977
what I am.

457
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:15,602
I will help you, Kanwar.

458
01:17:18,811 --> 01:17:20,227
I am with you.

459
01:17:51,802 --> 01:17:57,977
The night flows into us

460
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:08,269
A serpent of passion

461
01:18:24,737 --> 01:18:37,314
The blood-red star ascends

462
01:18:37,394 --> 01:18:43,534
Soaked in love, it beckons

463
01:18:43,614 --> 01:18:52,128
Hold me back, someone
Hold me!

464
01:18:52,208 --> 01:19:00,900
The threshold pulses
Red and red

465
01:19:25,096 --> 01:19:26,513
Ma?

466
01:19:30,096 --> 01:19:31,471
Ma?

467
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,221
Baali?

468
01:19:57,495 --> 01:19:58,230
Baali?

469
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:59,192
Brother.

470
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,576
Where did you go to?

471
01:20:08,544 --> 01:20:10,221
What happened here, Baali?

472
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:13,888
Fire.
- Where is Ma?

473
01:20:16,393 --> 01:20:18,055
Ma died in the fire.

474
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,409
Brother.

475
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:37,755
Brother Kanwar!

476
01:20:43,549 --> 01:20:44,930
Get up.

477
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,754
Get up.

478
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:55,928
Baali.

479
01:21:14,998 --> 01:21:16,346
Baali, come with me.

480
01:21:17,008 --> 01:21:18,675
No, I don't.

481
01:21:19,906 --> 01:21:21,008
My house.

482
01:21:22,457 --> 01:21:24,133
I'm cleaning Papaji's room.

483
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,500
You come with me, Baali.

484
01:23:03,824 --> 01:23:06,127
No. No... I have to clean.

485
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:08,125
So much to do!
- Baali!

486
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:17,238
If you ever loved my mother,
never set foot in this house.

487
01:24:22,988 --> 01:24:26,113
I'm going to take you and Neeli
back with me.

488
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:31,155
Never.

489
01:25:10,863 --> 01:25:13,738
Is this the first Lohri since you wed?
- Yes.

490
01:25:14,196 --> 01:25:16,863
It would have been so good
if Kanwar were here, too!

491
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:20,905
Wasn't Kanwar supposed to be back today?

492
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,655
You have to look at me.

493
01:26:29,055 --> 01:26:30,405
Look at your daughter.

494
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:37,071
You could never see me as I am,
could you?

495
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,363
Now, you have to look at me.

496
01:26:56,637 --> 01:26:58,438
Look at your daughter.

497
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,313
Your shameless daughter.

498
01:27:04,658 --> 01:27:06,605
Your worthless daughter.

499
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:11,063
Standing naked in front of her father.

500
01:27:15,759 --> 01:27:18,855
What should I do
with this disgusting woman?

501
01:27:22,386 --> 01:27:24,754
I can't hide her anymore.

502
01:27:27,478 --> 01:27:29,730
She doesn't want to hide anymore.

503
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,980
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

504
01:27:39,641 --> 01:27:41,605
She doesn't listen to anything.

505
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,313
What do I do with this shameless girl?

506
01:27:51,954 --> 01:27:53,730
Where should I hide her away?

507
01:28:07,634 --> 01:28:10,134
She should just die.

508
01:28:12,468 --> 01:28:14,343
She deserves to die.

509
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:19,968
What do I do now, Papaji?

510
01:28:23,634 --> 01:28:25,878
You always told me what to do.

511
01:28:27,509 --> 01:28:29,134
Why not now?

512
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:36,634
Why don't you speak?

513
01:28:37,683 --> 01:28:39,301
Why don't you look at me?

514
01:28:40,472 --> 01:28:41,964
Look at me!

515
01:28:44,134 --> 01:28:45,759
Look at me!

516
01:28:47,259 --> 01:28:48,676
Look at me!

517
01:28:51,931 --> 01:28:55,468
He's come to take you away from me.

518
01:28:56,579 --> 01:28:59,134
Who?
-I can't do anything.

519
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,801
There's nobody there.

520
01:29:04,191 --> 01:29:05,384
He is here.

521
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:08,718
He's not going to leave us.

522
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,051
He's come.

523
01:29:59,142 --> 01:30:01,509
You stay here. I'll go see.

524
01:30:10,926 --> 01:30:13,551
Call Kanwar.
- You know he's not here.

525
01:30:13,843 --> 01:30:16,468
I told you he's gone for his mother.
- Move away.

526
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,051
I should have guessed.

527
01:30:18,407 --> 01:30:21,142
But it never occurred to me
that this boy is not a boy.

528
01:30:21,423 --> 01:30:23,429
You are disgusting!

529
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:27,679
Shameless...
- I don't know what you are talking about!

530
01:30:27,888 --> 01:30:29,718
He'll be back with his mother
very soon.

531
01:30:29,996 --> 01:30:31,218
Come back then.

532
01:30:33,131 --> 01:30:34,551
Open the door!

533
01:30:34,926 --> 01:30:36,331
Break the door down!

534
01:30:38,947 --> 01:30:41,593
Someone saw you at the window.

535
01:30:41,856 --> 01:30:45,138
They're breaking down the door.
Run away!

536
01:30:45,337 --> 01:30:49,268
No! Let it all be over!
- You have to go.

537
01:30:49,348 --> 01:30:52,884
They'll kill us if they find you here.
- I'm not leaving you.

538
01:30:53,196 --> 01:30:55,441
I told Uncle Keerath
you'd gone for your mother.

539
01:30:55,521 --> 01:30:59,867
They'll calm down
if they don't find you here. Go!

540
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:50,298
Kanwar, you can't leave her there alone.

541
01:31:50,378 --> 01:31:51,918
They will kill her.

542
01:32:11,989 --> 01:32:15,001
You go back
and they'll kill both of you.

543
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:24,251
You are a part of me.

544
01:32:27,362 --> 01:32:29,668
You will always be part of me.

545
01:32:31,794 --> 01:32:34,126
We must save Neeli.

546
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:41,584
Kanwar,
there is only one way to save her.

547
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:48,834
She's going to die, Kanwar.
And you alone can't save her.

548
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,209
But together we can.

549
01:33:00,323 --> 01:33:02,543
There is only one way to save her.

550
01:33:03,513 --> 01:33:06,084
Her and our family.

551
01:33:21,826 --> 01:33:23,199
My son!

552
01:33:26,313 --> 01:33:27,686
My moon.

553
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:43,719
My son, you'll become a real man now.

554
01:33:55,081 --> 01:33:56,324
Papaji!

555
01:36:12,436 --> 01:36:14,102
She will not escape from us,

556
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,061
this Kanwar of yours.

557
01:36:16,936 --> 01:36:18,977
We'll find her.

558
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:21,602
Even if we have to go
to her father's house.

559
01:36:22,727 --> 01:36:25,186
We have seen what he really is, Neeli.

560
01:36:45,352 --> 01:36:47,394
What is he doing? Let's go!

561
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:52,436
I am Umber Singh's son.
Do I look like a girl?

562
01:36:52,602 --> 01:36:55,727
What have you got us involved in,
Keerath?

563
01:37:35,042 --> 01:37:37,644
We are going home now, Neeli.

564
01:37:54,383 --> 01:37:56,269
Whom are you hitting?

565
01:37:59,637 --> 01:38:01,186
Neeli...

566
01:38:05,281 --> 01:38:06,602
Kanwar?

567
01:38:09,724 --> 01:38:11,436
He is here.

568
01:38:49,974 --> 01:38:51,686
I was so alone.

569
01:38:56,990 --> 01:38:59,227
Sister-in-law!

570
01:39:46,882 --> 01:39:48,007
Neeli...

571
01:39:54,136 --> 01:39:55,394
Don't worry.

572
01:39:58,786 --> 01:40:02,019
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

573
01:40:24,861 --> 01:40:27,769
We'll tear this house down.

574
01:40:30,558 --> 01:40:33,061
We'll keep nothing from the past.

575
01:40:39,154 --> 01:40:41,852
We'll forget everything.

576
01:40:48,786 --> 01:40:52,811
I'll make for us
a better house than this one.

577
01:41:12,198 --> 01:41:14,736
I've cheated destiny before.

578
01:41:16,534 --> 01:41:18,111
I was a refugee once.

579
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:20,902
And I made a new life.

580
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:24,736
Built a new home.

581
01:41:28,977 --> 01:41:31,444
We'll defeat destiny again.

582
01:42:58,966 --> 01:43:00,319
Neeli...

583
01:43:01,517 --> 01:43:05,194
How many times
must I live this tale again?

584
01:43:16,759 --> 01:43:19,486
Neither a man nor a woman...

585
01:43:21,808 --> 01:43:24,361
Neither human nor a ghost...

586
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:32,027
Look at me, Neeli!

587
01:44:52,815 --> 01:44:55,075
Forgive me, Neeli.

588
01:45:12,436 --> 01:45:14,111
Free me.

589
01:45:18,923 --> 01:45:20,277
Free me now.

590
01:46:06,873 --> 01:46:12,992
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

591
01:46:13,317 --> 01:46:20,484
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

592
01:46:20,668 --> 01:46:27,165
All pain will be assuaged, O Mother!

593
01:46:27,245 --> 01:46:33,964
Teach your son to walk like a fragrance!

594
01:46:34,202 --> 01:46:39,251
Teach your son

595
01:46:41,132 --> 01:46:47,932
Teach your son to walk like a fragrance!

596
01:46:48,603 --> 01:46:54,808
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

597
01:46:55,089 --> 01:47:02,299
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

598
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:36,193
I walk the path of clouds

599
01:47:36,831 --> 01:47:43,674
A son is born into my home! O, I fly!

600
01:47:44,009 --> 01:47:49,306
A son in my home!

601
01:47:49,707 --> 01:47:54,703
A moon glimmers in my home!

602
01:47:54,783 --> 01:48:00,335
I fly! I fly!

603
01:48:00,415 --> 01:48:05,632
A boy has come to my home, I fly!

604
01:48:05,913 --> 01:48:09,135
A boy has come to my home, I fly!
