1
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:37,948
''Come, O moon.''

2
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:41,784
Come with a streak of lightening.

3
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:44,790
Come through the soaring mountains.

4
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:48,294
Come with milk for the baby!

5
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:54,733
Come soon with a pleasant breeze.

6
00:00:54,901 --> 00:01:01,033
Come in a palanquin and bring
a bright future for the bay.

7
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:28,767
''Dear, look, that's moon.''

8
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,099
Have you seen that mother?

9
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,162
''She is feeding her son, while
narrating a moon story to the baby.''

10
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:36,765
Lie. Everything is a lie.

11
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:39,107
''The moon doesn't come, and it
never brings anything with it.''

12
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:42,273
''But the kid will not eat, if he
is not told a lie about the moon.''

13
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,181
''That's why, she is
feeding him by telling a lie.''

14
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:50,118
This increases lies
in the whole world.

15
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,791
''We don't even have the interest,
to know what the truth is.''

16
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:01,231
''Except those two,
everything in this world is a lie.''

17
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:05,067
We grow in lies and
we will die in lies.

18
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,732
''lf she tell the truth to
that boy, while feeding that..''

19
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:10,902
''..the moon doesn't come to the earth,
how would have the child grown?''

20
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:15,073
''How could that mother be, who
tells the truth to her child?''

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,775
By the time the child is fed..

22
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,778
..the plate will turn dry.

23
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:49,279
lt is not needed for those..

24
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,785
..who doesn't need it.

25
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:58,814
There isn't any value of
the words of the people.

26
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:05,726
There isn't any truth
on this whole earth.

27
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:29,077
Hey! Wake up!
- You! l won't spare you.

28
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,741
What will you do?

29
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,756
Wait!

30
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:43,159
''Oh, God! Don't touch me. l
didn't complete my prayer.''

31
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,756
Leave her!

32
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,266
What?

33
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:00,302
''Rama, what happened?''

34
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,871
''Now, l have to take bath again.
Behaving like kids.''

35
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,706
Come. Come closer!

36
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,721
Come.

37
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:26,732
What is this?
- Hey!

38
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,069
Leave me!

39
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,755
You're looking super!

40
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,315
Hey! Catch this.

41
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,196
What is this? Again
ldli in breakfast?

42
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,031
''Mother, l don't want ldli.
Serve something else.''

43
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,867
''Today, l've prepared ldli.
And you have to eat it.''

44
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,032
''l don't like ldli.
See, how hard they are.''

45
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,881
What's this?
- ldli. My mother has prepared.

46
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,715
Those ldlies are better than mine.
Shut your mouth and eat.

47
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,722
Brother Chitty has sent us
for donation for Vinayaka.

48
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:29,225
''Rama, give them Rs.100. it's
kept near the Gods photograph.''

49
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,123
What's it?

50
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,724
Donation for rituals of Vinayaka.
- Wait!

51
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:39,235
''No need to give. We won't give
any donation. You may go, please.''

52
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,296
lt is not for my personal gains?
We're asking for rituals.

53
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,239
We also do rituals in our house.

54
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,072
Chitty Reddy has
sent us for donation.

55
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:46,237
l won't give donation to
any one. Go from here.

56
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,802
Why are you entering into an
argument? - Are you scared of them?

57
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,906
They don't have guts to harm.

58
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,247
We should not fear them.
Go from here.

59
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,020
''Dear, lf we fear them,
then they will abuse us..''

60
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:04,859
''..so, we have to be brave and
we shouldn't be afraid of them.''

61
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,866
''Hey! You don't like breakfast,
which l have prepared..''

62
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,869
''..so, take this Rs.100
and eat something out side.''

63
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:13,864
They're not giving donation.
- Did you mention my name?

64
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,202
They do not pay any heed.
We mentioned your name too.

65
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,709
''lnstead of giving us any respect,
they insulted us.''

66
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,041
We will have to deal with them.

67
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:26,047
''Come here. Hey, l am
telling you. Come here.''

68
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,727
Why are you afraid of us?

69
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,324
How much money is
there in your pocket?

70
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,736
Turn back. Turn!

71
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,677
''Hey, you are back so soon.
Did you eat your breakfast?''

72
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,241
Yes.

73
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:05,688
Lie. You should not
lie to your mother.

74
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,692
''You didn't have your breakfast,
did you? - Yes.''

75
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,694
''You have given money
to them, haven't you?''

76
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,691
Take100 rupees more from
there and have your breakfast.

77
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,760
''Dear, are you going somewhere?
- Yes, father.''

78
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:22,201
l just had my coffee.
lt has to digest.

79
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,275
Where is my cigarette?

80
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,995
You're in fire service & you yourself
are smoking? Can't you stop?

81
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:53,067
''ln my childhood, l
took only two puffs..''

82
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,074
''..and now, l am unable
to leave this habit.''

83
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,071
''l am ready to leave it, but
it is not ready to leave me.''

84
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,907
''Dear, this habit isn't good.
Once caught, it never leaves.''

85
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:05,075
You don't get habituated
with this. lt's a bad habit.

86
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:13,757
Mother is coming.

87
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,765
She is coming. Coming.

88
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,774
''No, you should not see father.
- What happened?''

89
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,937
''No, no..
- Why shouldn't l see? - No. - Hey!''

90
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:36,779
Move aside.

91
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:41,779
What happened to you?
ls there any problem?

92
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,287
What happened? Why are you quiet?

93
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,121
What's this? Why
are you turning pale?

94
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:51,286
Why don't you talk?
- Mother! Here.

95
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:54,059
Hey! Why have you
climbed here? Get down.

96
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,233
''Get down, slowly.''

97
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,068
Why are you doing like this?

98
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,900
''Get these articles, on your
way back. Ok. - Ok, mother.''

99
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,034
''While buying those things,
justcancel the articles from.. ''

100
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,134
..the list which
you've already bought.

101
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,736
''C'mon, go. - Ok. - l have to
prepare food with those articles.''

102
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,304
''You go, mother.
- You come and take..''

103
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:12,249
''..medicine, it
will cure you problem.''

104
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:17,750
Did she leave? - Yes. - l
thought she has caught us.

105
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,110
Pass it.

106
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,283
Eat it.

107
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:51,290
''Today, l've to consult so many
patients in the hospital. l've to go.''

108
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:59,888
l think that dog will
eat my rabbit up. Father!!!

109
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,727
''Father, that dog's
eye is on my rabbit.''

110
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,240
Your dog is eyeing on my rabbit.

111
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,746
''This isn't a dog.
- ls this a tiger? - No, it's Jimmy.''

112
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,805
Let it be. lf that
dog eyes my rabbit..

113
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,874
..l will kill..
- Will you kill your rabbit?

114
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,248
''lt won't look good to kill.
- No, l am not talking about..''

115
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:23,083
..rabbit. l am
talking about your dog!

116
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:24,280
''lf you want, you can abuse me. ''

117
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,257
''lf you abuse my dog, then
l won't spare anybody.''

118
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,763
Wait!
- l won't.

119
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,263
''l will wait.
- Thanks, sir.''

120
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:37,766
Father. He dared to touch mother.

121
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,828
Doesn't matter. l am a real man.

122
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,771
No one has the guts to stop me.

123
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,776
l said l'll wait.
- Why this fighting in between us?

124
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:47,108
''Please, control your jimmy.
- Ok.''

125
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,946
Definitely l will control my jimmy.

126
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:53,178
Thanks sir.
- Welcome.

127
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,880
He is a real man.

128
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,891
Only this much. lt seems we
got fewer amounts of donations.

129
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,956
''Brother, people
aren't afraid of you.''

130
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,059
No one is respecting us.

131
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:12,727
How many members gave
donation in the market? - 1 2.

132
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:14,898
Only 1 2 members gave donations
out of 100 shops in the market?

133
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:18,076
''Hey, Devudu. Nowadays you
aren't working with interest.''

134
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,168
''lt's not like that, brother.''

135
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:22,078
''We came to know that, you're roaming
with Malli in the market, weren't you?''

136
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,749
''She looks beautiful, isn't it?''

137
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:29,083
He told me.
- She is Badu's sister.

138
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,918
''What Badu, you never said that
you have a beautiful sister.''

139
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:37,762
l think you have shown pity on her..

140
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,921
''..and stopped asking
donation in the market, isn't it?''

141
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,263
No. l am doing my duty.

142
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:45,930
''Nowadays, those people in the market
are making a union and a leader.''

143
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,940
''They do not come to us,
for any problems.''

144
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:52,102
They solve it there itself.

145
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,712
ls it so.

146
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:58,715
''Hey, Badu, bring your sister
in the evening. - For what?''

147
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:03,778
Did you think of marrying
her without my seeing her?

148
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:07,219
Let him bring! l
want to see her once.

149
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:19,068
''Rama, will you drop me
to the fire station.''

150
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,907
l too will come along with you.
- No.

151
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:34,919
''Let her come.
- No, l said.''

152
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,750
''Ok, come dear.''

153
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,872
''Father, you come and sit
in front. Hey, you go back.''

154
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,207
What happened?
- Come front.

155
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:08,043
''Father, l am unable to
drive bicycle everyday.''

156
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,212
Can't you buy a bike for me?

157
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,052
''l'll, but you pass with
high percentage, first.''

158
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:15,719
You said it before when l
had passed my 10 standard.

159
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:18,895
''You repeated the same,
when l passed my college.''

160
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,899
''Forget it. lf you pass with high
percentage this time, then l'll.. ''

161
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,060
..definitely buy one for you.
- Really? - Yes.

162
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:27,070
What happened?
- She pressed them to me!

163
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,902
Pressed what?
- That..

164
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,402
How can l say?

165
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,073
''Hey! lf not, then shut you
mouth and ride this bicycle. - Yes.''

166
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,818
''What happened, again?
- She pressed them to me!''

167
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:52,090
Pressed what?

''Hey! lf not, then shut you
mouth and ride this bicycle.''

169
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,860
''l'm watching, your behaviour has
changed. Why are you behaving.. ''

170
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,872
''..like this, didn't
l say, l will buy a bike?''

171
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,875
''l will cancel your bike, if you
stop your cycle in the middle.''

172
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:06,036
And you sit on the bicycle.

173
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:08,237
Move.

174
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:15,047
''Come in the evening. - Father,
l won't take her along with me.''

175
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,879
''Uncle, see what he is saying?''

176
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,221
''Dear, it's not good to do like
this. Take her along with you.''

177
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:26,888
''C'mon. - Go, dear. - Hey!
Not behind. Sit in front.''

178
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:31,062
''l feel comfortable on the rear.
So, l'll sit behind.''

179
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:35,904
Hey! Remove your hand. l won't
spare you. lf you repeat it again.

180

throw you down from the cycle.

181
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:40,135
''l will see to it,
after throwing you.''

182
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,921
''Father, that dog is
eyeing on my rabbit, again.''

183
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,853
''Hey, Didn't l tell you to
keep your dog in control?''

184
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,922
''Didn't l tell you, it's
not a dog? lt's Jimmy.''

185
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,025
''No, it shouldn't eye on my rabbit.''

186
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:08,699
Why?

187
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,699
lt shouldn't eye. - lt won't.
- Wait. l won't. - l will wait.

188
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,711
''Father, he dared to touch mother.''

189
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:17,207
Doesn't matter. l'm a real man.
No one has the guts to stop me.

190
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:19,217
''Dear, you go inside.
l will talk to him.''

191
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,222
Hey! Don't abuse a real man.
- You go.

192
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:30,887
''Can't you keep your Jimmy
in control, for my sake?''

193
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,227
l can control anything for you.

194
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,133
''l know about that. - Thanks.
l too, know about your heart.''

195
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,728
Ok. l take your leave now.
lt's time to lay eggs.

196
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:42,899
''Eggs and you! - No, you
are thinking in a wrong way.''

197
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:46,069
''lt's time for exercise, so l
have to feed eggs to them.''

198
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:50,079
''Ok, see you.
- Bye.''

199
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:01,083
''Oh, Rama.''

200
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:05,856
''Get up.
- Oh, Rama.''

201
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:12,026
''lf l won't get up, are you
going to melt or what? - Yes.''

202
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,038
Can't you wait for a moment?
- No! l won't.

203
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,040
Are you feeling proud to be fair?

204
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:20,101
Yes. Move aside.
- Fair one is black hearted.

205
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,046
You should look like me.

206
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:29,878
''Sir, did you understand
what is going on in her mind?''

207
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:32,048
What?
- She is in love with you.

208
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:36,060
''So, l have to love her? Love
and with her! She is still a kid.''

209
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,062
Hey! Am l a kid?
- Yes.

210
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:50,070
Are you addressing me as a kid?

211
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:58,174
Why have l involved
myself with their matter?

212
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:35,043
''What's this? - You said that l am
a kid, didn't you? ls it ok, now?''

213
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,724
Why are you wearing these glasses?
To see clearly?

214
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,726
''Mother is coming. You
go from here, first.''

215
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:45,887
Why should l be afraid of her?
She is your mother not mine.

216
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,895
''You are shameless.
- Yes, l am.''

217
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:53,234
''Oh, mother is coming. Go. - No,
l won't go. - Ok, then l'll go.''

218
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:01,746
She is beautiful.

Hey! You go inside.
- l won't go.

220
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,874
''Hey! You turn back.
- No, we won't.''

221
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,749
Everyone is looking at you.
- l want everyone to look at me.

222
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,756
Anyway you men
never look at our face.

223
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:14,258
''Oh, what a beauty.''

224
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,089
ls this necessary to look at this
age? - Who is old here?

225
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:18,095
And why are you
addressing me as old man?

226
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:07,736
'''Why are you repeating
the words, which l say?'''

227
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:14,082
'l will repeat only
that which you say.'

228
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:19,750
'l don't like you. You will be
troubled. Why are you following me?'

229
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,917
'l hate you.'

230
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,930
'Don't fall on me.'

231
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,831
'''l am going my way, let me go.'''

232
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:31,768
'''Now, stop following me,
lt's enough, now.'''

233
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:16,745
'What ever you say. l'll do that.

234
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,750
Where ever you send.
l'll go. lsn't this love?'

235
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:22,753
'You tease me by calling
me as fair one.

236
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:25,255
And you will fall on me.
Why to trouble myself.'

237
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:28,350
'''One day, you will feel like you
are in love with me, don't you?'''

238
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:31,362
'l am waiting till today.
Will l not get bored?'

239
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,754
'''Don't you know, how
to behave in a house..'''

240
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:34,918
'''What's going to happen to me,
if you become my wife?'''

241
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:37,928
'''lf you are fair complexioned,
then l'll address you as a fair one.'''

242
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:40,931
'l will address you as my God.'

243
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,991
'Why are you comparing me with God.'

244
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,936
''There isn't any problem,
if you love me.''

245
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:19,333
Brother! Malli has come.

246
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,410
Are you the one who

247
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:39,086
You are beautiful. Hey!!

Devudu. ls

253
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:01,041
''What, brother?
- That one.''

254
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,215
''Seeing your faces, l think
both of you must have done that.''

255
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:10,719
''Ramesh, there is a temple
in your street, isn't it?''

256
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,053
Go and get 100 coconut tops.

257
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:18,889
''Badu, You belong to white
card or red card? - White card.''

258
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:24,066
''Then, go and get 10 litres

259
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:27,728
Malli! Come here. Come!!

260
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:36,245

''He works here as my man. You too
are just like him, for me. Move!''

264
00:25:56,768 --> 00:26:00,204
l will taste and tell
you about your selection.

265
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,202
''We're trying to douse the fire here,
and someone is increasing it there.''

266
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,704
What are to staring at me?

267

Tell me.
- We want to honor you. - Why?

271
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:43,741
Don't say like that. You
have saved our market..

272
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,744
..by putting your life in danger.

273
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:51,749
Property worth Lakhs has
been saved because of you.

274
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:55,685
''That's why we have to
honor you, most definitely''

275
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:59,087
To honor you is equal to honor
the entire good and..

276
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,091
..auspicious onesin this world.

277
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,150
''Please, don't refuse it.
- lt's my duty, sir.''

278
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:07,187
''Father, they are
requesting you. Accept it.''

279
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,860
''Yes, make it fast.''

280
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:13,700
We've arranged on 25th of this

Ok.
- Greetings.

283
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:22,707
''Sir, this is injustice to us.
How cruelly they burnt this office.''

284
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:26,717
lf you had been late here we
would have lost our millions.

285
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:32,052
''We have lost 2 million
because of the fire. See, this sir.''

286
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:35,057
''Do you know who is behind this?
- Shidha Reddy's men, sir.''

287
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:37,891
Will you become a witness for this?
- Yes. - Right now you will agree.

288
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:40,727
But when time comes your
tongues will be tied. We're being..

289
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,893
..fooled by you people
and troubling our selves.

290
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:48,065
l'll book a case only when you people
agree to speak the truth in the court.

291
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,734
''Sir, we will definitely say this
in the court. We are united now.''

292
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,902
''This, Shetty is our union leader.''

293
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:54,843
Will you speak in the court?

294
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:59,009
Yes. He did this because we've
stopped giving protection money

295
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:02,019
''No here, you have to
say this in the court.''

296
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:05,682
''lf you take my responsibility,
l'll definitely speak the truth.''

297
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,857
''Brother, because of our attack,
people from other markets have.. ''

298
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,869
..started to pay
protection money to us.

299
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:20,928
ls it?
- Yes.

300
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:24,305
''Malli, these people
have so much work.''

301
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:27,040
That's why they have
appointed me as their leader.

302
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:50,724
Stop it! Stop.

303
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,231
''Sir, he is Shidha Reddy. Yes,
he is Shidha Reddy.''

304
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:03,804
''Do you know this question?

This one? l don't know.

You do not know answers
to 2 out of 5 questions.

310
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:19,759
''Within half an hour,
rituals are going to start.''

311
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,822
''Meanwhile, will you study
these two questions? - Yes.''

312
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,850
''Mother, see.

''Nothing auntie, l've just shown

326
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:50,784
''Then, why are these lights
running instead of glowing?''

327
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:52,789
''They are coming to their
own place, again. ls it? ''

328
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:55,052
Then why that top line is walking?

329
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:57,725
Are you making me a fool? Come here.

330
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:02,733
What's the matter? Why these
lights are going under the ground?

331
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:05,895
''lf l get killed because of short
circuit, will you give my life back?''

332
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:07,962
lt looks like that but it
won't short-circuit. - ls it?

333
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,904
Then we'll also show you money and
you understand that we've paid you.

334
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:12,739
What rubbish are you talking?
- lt's not rubbish.

335
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:15,075
''Fix these lights properly,
it shouldn't go under.. ''

336
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:17,080
''..the ground, but
it should go above.''

337
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:21,346
lt is a festival day today. Do not
make me angry. Go and do your work.

338
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,254
l have to look at all
the works. Who is she?

339
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:41,138
This is a colorful Rangoli.

340
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:44,437
These are design in the
houses in front of the doors.

341
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:48,109
Everyone is enjoying
creating these designs.

342
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,981
Everyone is chanting the
name of Lord Rama as Raghurama.

343
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:03,057
Ram is the name of Lord Rama.
He is the lord of the deprived.

344
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:06,825
He is brave. He is the
bright rays of the sun.

345
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:10,356
''Now, he has come out with Goddess
Sita, in palanquin. Hail to them.''

346
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:14,963
You will be blessed by him!
O Lord Sitarama!

347
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,067
''O Lord, hail to you!''

348
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:04,886
Hail to Lord Raghurama!
Hail to Sita Rama.

349
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:11,719
You are more beautiful
than all the Gods.

350
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:14,458
''By seeing you Goddess
Sita, felt shy.''

351
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:19,727
''After seeing Goddess Sita,
Lord Rama was unable.. ''

352
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,738
..to control his happiness.

353
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:27,074
Ramalayam turned into a
temple of love.

354
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:28,737
Ramayanam has become a love story.

355
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:31,748
He is the Lord who fulfills
the wish of the devotees.

356
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:33,750
Hail to the feet of that Lord!

357
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:37,044
Lord Rama is in my heartbeats.

358
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:40,050
All the natures' gift
of this world are with him.

359
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:46,918
Goddess Sita is the one who is
filled with love for everyone.

360
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:50,188
There is no other couple like
them in the entire universe.

361
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:57,030
''Even Ravan who cast his eyes on
her, was killed by him! ''

362
00:35:57,101 --> 00:36:00,036
Hail to that Lord Rama.

363
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:24,885
''Devudu, they have arrested
our brother-in-law. You've to..''

364
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:27,898
..release him. You're the one
who has to look after this village.

365
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:33,233
Witness is very strong. And the
witness is in police protection.

366
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:37,741
What if we kill that witness?
- lt's not possible. Witness is in..

367
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:41,745
''..protection in the commissioner
office, with special force.''

368
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:45,078
''lf we blast the police station,
everything will be finished.''

369
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:48,243
Till the time we are good to the cops.
They'll continue to be good to us.

370
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,755
''lf anything happens to them,
then they won't spare anybody.''

371
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:56,686
Don't take it as easy that
they have taken bribe from us.

372
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:58,692
They are dangerous.
- What do we do now?

373
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,863
''Tomorrow they are taking that
witness to the court, isn't it?''

374
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:12,199
We have to set up
our fielding there.

375
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:24,880
Are you praying to God? Carry on.

376
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:29,720
''ls it completed? l'll teach
you something new, will you come?''

377
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:33,730
''Then, let's go! Careful.''

378
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:47,901
What're you doing here? - lt's
not important to tell you. - Move.

379
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,913
''l won't spare you, if you do it
again. - Ok, you go from here.''

380
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:53,747
''You too, go from here.
Forget about her.''

381
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:57,181
We will meet in the
evening at 6 Pm. Near Kothpet.

382
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:59,246
''Grandfather, why are
you doing like this?''

383
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:02,350
Grandfather! Who is grandfather
here? Do l look like that?

384
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:08,755
''What is your age? Let it be. lf
you go closer to girl, they may..''

385
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,858
.. have a doubt that
you will tease them.

386
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,871
lf l go closer to them
and if l touch them..

387
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,703
..they don't have any doubt on me.

388
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:22,869
She is Ratnalu. l've the guts to
kiss her. - lt's impossible for you.

389
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,938
Bet!
- Yes. - Amount. - Rs. 100.

390
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:33,721
Ratnalu!
- What's it?

391
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:36,726
Are these fruits yours?
- Yes. Where did you get them from?

392
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,729
From my village.
- ls it so?

393
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:42,732
''Then, why are they so small in size?''

394
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,065
Will you give me one?
- No! - You carry on with your work.

395
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:51,735
Ratnalu! - What's it? l am
willing to bet with you.

396
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:54,175
Bet? - l have seen
everything of you? - What!?

397
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:58,841
l've the guts to catch that coal
of you iron. - lt's impossible.

398
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,680
''lf l can't, then, l'll pay
you Rs. 10 for that. lf l did..''

399
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:04,688
..then you have to give me
one fruit from here. - Ok.

400
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,020
Wait!

401
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,687
''What's this? - l said l'll catch
the burning coal, but.. ''

402
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,697
..l didn't say l won't
pour water on it.

403
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,702
''Yes.
- Then, keep it on my hand.''

404
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,863
C'mon!

405
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,044
l won't agree with this?
- Why?

406
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:33,709
l want this fruit back.

407
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:36,219
''lf you want this fruit, then,
you have to bet again. - Again!?''

408
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:38,881
''What's it? - l'll kiss you,
without touching you.''

409
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,890
''ls it? lt's impossible.
- lf l can't, then l'll.. ''

410
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,892
..pay you Rs. 50 along
with this fruit.

411
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,225
''Rs.50? - lf l did, then
l'll take all these fruits.''

412
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,233
Hey! Have you heard?
She is ready for it.

413
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:54,067
You're ready for what? - For a kiss.
- Where should l kiss you? - Here.

414
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:58,899
''Look, you have to kiss me,
without touching. - Ok.''

415
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:08,249
''You have touched me. - Yes, l
have lost my bet. Take these.''

416
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,911
Hey! Give that Rs. 100
which you had put on wager.

417
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:15,759
You have fooled me.
- What have l done to you?

418
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:18,091
You fooled me for a kiss.

419
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:20,756
What have l done to you?
l have paid you for it.

420
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:25,269
''Why l have done this because,
they called me an old man.''

421
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:30,171
''Ratnalu! Give me one fruit, please.''

422
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:34,109
To hell with you! Why this
fruit to you in such old age?

423
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:39,112
''You scoundrel! What is
left now, to give you?''

424
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,783
''Not like that, dear.''

425
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,844
''lf l touch you, my
body receives shocks.''

426
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:49,450
''Shut up, you old man! You'll
die by shocks, if you touch me.''

427
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:55,225
''My wish is to touch you once.
lt doesn't matter, even if l die.''

428
00:40:58,136 --> 00:40:59,899
Grandfather! This is not
the right way.

429
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:01,905
''See, how l will
ask her for a kiss.''

430
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:10,908
'''Ratnalu, will you give me a kiss?'''

431
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:17,083
'''Ratnalu, l'll offer you chicken,
will you come to my place?'''

432
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:21,757
'lf you buy a bangle.
Then l'll buy kohl for you.'

433
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:24,761
'''lf you wear a blouse, then
l'll buy you a round neck jacket.'''

434
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:28,265
'Let the wrinkles.. Come..'

435
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:44,771
'l won't come. lt's
impossible to come.'

436
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:47,943
'There's no time to come.'

437
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,783
'What's this? You have started
some other song. Keep quiet.'

438
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,846
'You start the beats.'

439
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:22,917
'Your earnings won't get down.'

440
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:26,081
'Everyone feels
happy by seeing you.'

441
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:28,921
'''By seeing your youth, an
old man also comes in a mood.'''

442
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:32,087
'As the clothes are starched.'

443
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:34,757
'She is a beauty..'

444
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:41,771
'Behaves like she
doesn't know anything.'

445
00:43:04,795 --> 00:43:07,730
'Have you seen how she walks?
- Yes.'

446
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:09,732
'Touch her and see?'

447
00:43:12,904 --> 00:43:16,067
''He is dead. - Didn't l say,
you will die, if you touch me?''

448
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:46,097
'Cool as pearls.'

449
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,934
'''But, hot as pepper. '''

450
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:52,100
'She has forced me to hold her hand'

451
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:55,202
'''But, when l am trying to hold her,
she is slipping out of my hands.'''

452
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:57,713
'She looks like a beauty..'

453
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,723
'She won't allow me to
put my hand on her.'

454
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:29,903
''Devudu, they have arrested
our brother-in-law. You've to..''

455
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:33,075
..release him. You're the one
who has to look after this village.

456
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:38,255
Witness is very strong. And the
witness is in police protection.

457
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,085
What if we kill that witness?
- lt's not possible. Witness is in..

458
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:42,921
''..protection in the commissioner
office, with special force.''

459
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:49,923
''lf we blast the police station,
everything will be finished.''

460
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:53,402
Till the time we are good to the cops.
They'll continue to be good to us.

461
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:57,707
''lf anything happens to them,
then they won't spare anybody.''

462
00:44:57,775 --> 00:45:00,039
Don't take it as easy that
they have taken bribe from us.

463
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:03,046
They are dangerous.
- What do we do now?

464
00:45:10,788 --> 00:45:13,222
''Tomorrow they are taking that
witness to the court, isn't it?''

465
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,727
We have to set up
our fielding there.

466
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:23,315
''Greetings, brother. - What's
it, Badu? Why are you here?''

467
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:26,049
l've come here to greet you.
- ls everything alright? - Yes.

468
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,056
How is your sister? - She is fine.
- She looks so beautiful.

469
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:32,118
''That's why, l have come here?''

470
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:06,690
Hey! Wait.

471
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:18,865
''Come here. He is saying that, he
has to go to Warrangal for exams.''

472
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:22,035
''He'll, but, what's the problem? -
lt's a problem, because the exam is ''

473
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,706
''..on the 25th and on the same day,
you are going to be honored.''

474
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:26,875
''Oh! This is the problem, isn't it? ''

475
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:27,883
Then we'll change our
program for some other day.

476
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:28,884
This is not as
easy as you are thinking.

477
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:29,885
On top of that respected
personalities are also..

478
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:31,717
..coming and invitations also
distributed. l was thinking to go..

479
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:36,886
.. alone with him and even
l want to see the program.

480
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,054
''Don't worry, auntie.
You stay with uncle.''

481
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:41,120
l'll go along with him.

482
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:43,894
lt's a good idea.
- lt's not a good idea.

483
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:45,959

Yes. - Have you written

554
00:58:32,122 --> 00:58:34,056
''That which l taught you,

555
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:36,722
The function to honour your

''Function was completed nicely.

''Mother, she is joking. - Hey! Be

Wait a minute!

''Brother, it's also

571
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,781
Devudu is under the police watch.

572
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:45,726
Journalist will write as they wish.

l didn't understand why you
are paying for yesterday's paper?

574
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:49,889
''Sir, those
journalists are very brave.''

575
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:53,732
''May be we can't arrest Devudu, but
they will definitely arrest him.''

576
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:55,737
How will they arrest?
We've the strong evidence that..

when he was murdered.

''When we were doing the
rituals of Goddess, we saw Devudu.''

579
01:00:01,144 --> 01:00:03,135
What? They have seen the God?

580

''What is the cost of tomatoes? -
Dear, why are you behaving like this?''

''Don't you feel shy,
doing this?''

611
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:01,180
Hey! Stay in your limits.
- Are you her husband?

612
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:04,715
''Have you seen, brother?
She didn't even feel shy..''

01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:07,126
..upon doing such things
in front of her husband.

614
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:09,722
Women like her are here
to spoil guys like us.

615
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:14,236
We should not allow women
like her to live. Hey! Kill her.

616
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:22,238
''Hello, old man! Why are you
interfering in our matter?''

617
01:03:22,312 --> 01:03:26,078
''We want this woman, if

Go and give that water
tanker file in the RTA office.

''Don't worry, go to your house. - l

l will get the bail
orders and get him released.

632
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,062
Will my father come back home?

633

He hasn't committed any crime?
He will surely come home.

634
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:32,738
''Believe me. Ok, uncle.''

635

Only Rs. 10? What will

''lf you want to see your father,
then pay Rs. 100.''

01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:05,033
Take it.

641
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:09,041
Write your
father's name and sign it.

642
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:15,214
Hey! Murder case Venkateshwar Rao.

643
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,052
You can go.

644
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:31,060
''Rama!
- What happened, father?''

645
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:35,400
''First tell me, how did you
write in your exams? - Well.''

646
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:39,731
''How are you, Shanti?''

647
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:44,744
''What's this, father?
- What happened?''

648
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:47,914
Within two days l will be released.

649
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:52,250
l know that you never do anything
criminal. Nothing will happen to you.

650
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:57,691
At any cost l'll get you released.
You don't worry.

651
01:06:58,094 --> 01:07:00,688
Why should l be afraid?

652
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,692
l am proud to have a son like you.

653
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:06,700
''Ok, l take your leave now.''

654
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,872
Give this packet to your father.

655
01:07:34,897 --> 01:07:36,888
Shanti. l will stop
smoking after this.

656
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:48,741
''Rama, we know that your father
don't have any relation with them.''

657
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:50,745
But the court doesn't know all that.

658
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:52,747
We want the eye witness
to prove your father innocent.

659
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:56,683
Do one thing. Go to the market
and find at least one eye witness.

660
01:07:56,753 --> 01:08:00,689
''After that l'll get him released.
But, remember one thing.''

661
01:08:00,757 --> 01:08:04,193
The one who has died is Badu.
He was so close to Devudu.

662
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:07,696
That's why he won't
leave your father so easily.

663
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:12,030
''lt's very difficult to find a
person, who can go against Devudu.''

664
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:25,714
Did you see the person who killed
a boy here on 22nd of this month?

665
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:27,773
''No, we don't know.
- No, you have seen.''

666
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,875
''Can't you understand? We don't
know. Now, you go from here.''

667
01:08:36,893 --> 01:08:40,056
Did you see the person who
killed a boy here on Friday?

668
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:40,720
Are you asking about
last Friday's murder?

669
01:08:40,797 --> 01:08:42,731
Why are you putting
yourself in danger?

670
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,790
Don't ask about that.
Nobody will tell you.

671
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:49,231
Why are you putting
our lives in danger? Go!

672
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:53,071
Dear! Come here.

673
01:08:56,746 --> 01:09:00,182
''Did you see, sir?
- Yes. l have seen everything.''

674
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:03,685
Murder didn't happen on Friday.
lt occurred on Wednesday.

675
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:07,189
l will tell the truth in the court.
For that l want Rs. 5000.

676
01:09:08,191 --> 01:09:10,853
''Why do you need money,
to tell the truth?''

677
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:15,023
l buy the goats from Ziyaguda. And
sell them by chopping them to pieces.

678
01:09:15,097 --> 01:09:18,692
''l won't see that she is good
or bad, but it's my earning.''

679
01:09:18,768 --> 01:09:21,862
l earn Rs. 500 on a goat.

680
01:09:21,938 --> 01:09:24,702
''Are you my friend to tell the truth
in court, by leaving your profits?''

681
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:26,867
''Pay money, l will tell
the truth in the court.''

682
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,768
''l won't take any business,
which doesn't have any profits.''

683
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:33,709
''Mother!
- What's it, Rama?''

684
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:36,877
One man has agreed to tell the
truth. But he is asking for Rs. 5000.

685
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:41,882
Why do we need others to tell
the truth? l was there at the..

686
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:44,859
..same time when they
murdered him. l'll tell the truth.

687
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:47,725
lt's not possible. The court won't
agree to the witness of relations.

688
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:51,723
Why? They can believe on the
incorrect statements of others.

689
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:54,736
But they don't believe the
truth of the related person.

690
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:58,135
''Yes, mother. This is the
tradition of the world.''

691
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:37,773
Take this five thousand. You've
to tell the truth in the court.

692
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:41,783
l want to tell you one thing.
To whom you have prayed..

693
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:45,116
..his name is Allah.
Allah means the truth.

694
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:47,948
And you have sold the
truth to me for Rs. 5000.

695
01:10:49,191 --> 01:10:53,287
''That means Allah is not with you.
From now onwards, stop praying to him.''

696
01:10:58,901 --> 01:11:00,801
''Dear, wait!''

697
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:04,898
''Take your money,
back. Yes, you are right.''

698
01:11:04,974 --> 01:11:08,910
l'll tell the truth in the court.
l'm not saying it for you and not..

699
01:11:08,978 --> 01:11:11,913
''..for your father, but for my Allah.
lf l stay here, they'll kill me.''

700
01:11:11,981 --> 01:11:13,812
Take me to some safe place.
- Come.

701
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:28,092
''Did you see, brother's figure?
lt's like an iron body.''

702
01:11:29,098 --> 01:11:31,760
Brother that
Venkateshwar's son has gone with..

703
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:35,099
..mutton shop guy to
tell the truth in the court.

704
01:11:55,391 --> 01:12:00,055
''Hey, Malli! Why are you crying?
Will the dead person come..''

705
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:05,064
''..to life if you cry? No. l
will tell you, come. Come!''

706
01:12:05,901 --> 01:12:09,234
Did you think that l am dead?
Did you forget your brother?

707
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:12,741
''Then, what dear. You
didn't informed me till the..''

708
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:18,747
''..matter has become serious.
l know ministers, MLA's.''

709
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:21,806
''lf you had informed me before, l'd
have got him released within moments.''

710
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:24,751
''l was not in my state then,
what to do. - You have forgotten!''

711
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:28,085
''lf l was your real brother,
wouldn't you tell him?''

712
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:30,921
''Mother, he is the man who
has agreed to tell the truth.''

713
01:12:30,993 --> 01:12:33,928
''lf he stays in the market, they will
kill him. We've to hide him from them.''

714
01:12:33,996 --> 01:12:38,092
''Now, leave it to me. l
will take his responsibility.''

715
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:40,761
At least let me
help you in this way.

716
01:12:40,836 --> 01:12:43,930
''Brother, l am very thankful to you.''

717
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:46,770
Why thank me? When l
am helping my people.

718
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:49,777
''Now, there isn't any problem.
Your father will be released.''

719
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:53,781
''Go and tell this to your father,
he will feel happy. Go!''

720
01:13:17,907 --> 01:13:21,070
Hey! You all go out. You too.

721
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:26,077
You. Everyone. C'mon go out.

722
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:48,099
Do you recognize me? l am Devudu.

723
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:51,105
''You had hit me that day,
when l was burning the market.''

724
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:54,708
''l haven't left alive anybody,
who dare to hit me.''

725
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:58,870
''But l was doing my duty, and you
were doing your duty and bashed me.''

726
01:13:58,948 --> 01:14:01,712
''So, now that matter is solved.''

727
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:05,880
Badu is responsible for
me to get this position.

728
01:14:05,955 --> 01:14:07,889
And you have taken his life.

729
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:11,723
l was very angry on you. l
thought l should chop you in pieces.

730
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:16,060
''He died due to the reason l have
sent him to kill you, but he died.''

731
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:20,225
''So, this matter is also solved.''

732
01:14:20,803 --> 01:14:22,896
''Now, l am in big trouble.''

733
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:26,908
The one you have killed.
She is his sister.

734
01:14:27,076 --> 01:14:31,740
She is not my wife. l didn't
tie a nuptial thread. But..

735
01:14:31,914 --> 01:14:35,077
''..she used to please me, by
sleeping with me everyday.''

736
01:14:35,818 --> 01:14:38,753
''When she is pleasing me,
without being my wife..''

737
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:42,257
..then l have to repay her.

738
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:46,090
That's why l will kill the
one who killed his brother.

739
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:50,258
And then the
matter will be finished.

740
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:55,702
''You!
- Die! Yes, you have to die.''

741
01:14:55,771 --> 01:15:00,208
''Look dear, l didn't kill
your Badu. He died by mistake.''

742
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:04,872
''You are the one who committed
this and blaming me. Now, l am..''

743
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:08,714
''..saying this. Not only Badu, but
l will chop off people like you..''

744
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:12,049
..in the middle of the road.
ls it some life?

745
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:35,737
Bash him! His head should blast.

746
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:37,904
Yes! Bash him.

747
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:53,759
Devudu! Leave him. He will die.

748
01:15:56,765 --> 01:16:00,701
Take him out.
- Leave me.

749
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:04,865
''C'mon.
- Lock the cell. - Yes, sir.''

750
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:46,078
''Sir, l want to meet
firemen Venkateshwar Rao.''

751
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:54,681
''Take this Rs. 100.
- Sir, they want to meet him.''

752
01:16:54,757 --> 01:16:56,088
Come here.

753
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:02,691
What's your relation with him?
- l am his son. - ls it?

754
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:06,201
''Sir, keys of that cell. - Why
are you giving to me? Throw there.''

755
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,029
You come inside. l
have to talk to you.

756
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:14,709
Sit!

757
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:22,873
Your father is innocent.
He didn't commit any crime.

758
01:17:22,952 --> 01:17:25,716
lf l wish l can
release him right now.

759
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,723
''Do one thing. Go and get Rs. 50,000.''

760
01:17:29,224 --> 01:17:34,059
Now it's 8pm. l'll
release him up to 8.15pm. Go!

761
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:39,066
''Sir, if l get that much of money,
then what about our lives?''

762
01:17:39,134 --> 01:17:41,728
Why are you being
miserly for your father?

763
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:43,795
''l am telling it for
your good, understand it.''

764
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:48,241
''Then, it would be a bribe.''

765
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:51,905
My father didn't do any crime.

766
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:54,677
lt's not the matter of crime
which he committed or not.

767
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,843
l want money. That's all.

768
01:17:56,919 --> 01:18:01,015
Justice is with me. My father
will be released at any cost.

769
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,854
''lf we wish, he won't be released.
- He will, sir.''

770
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:09,023
l've the eye witness. The
court will release him by tomorrow.

771
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:13,194
l will book a case in 05 minutes and
arrest him again. What will you do?

772
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:16,867
Don't quarrel with us.
Go and get money.

773
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:18,930
No! l won't give any bribe.

774
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:26,041
Hey! Take him in to his father. Go!

775
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:30,217
''Hey! Get me the tea.
- Ok, sir.''

776
01:18:42,064 --> 01:18:48,731
''Father, Father!''

777
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:52,066
l am sleeping.

778
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:11,023
What happened to my father?
- We have served them food..

779
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:14,028
.. and your father tried to
steal other prisoners' food.

780
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:18,089
After that they both fought
and this situation is created.

781
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:22,695
lt's a lie. Lie!!

782
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:28,209
You are lying. You all are
trying to kill my father.

783
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:31,202
''lf he stays here any more,
you people will kill him.''

784
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:35,043
''l will take back my father.
Yes, l will.''

785
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:54,062
''Hey! Catch him.
- Sir, leave, him.''

786
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:18,085
Move!
- Father.

787
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:24,259
Dear!
- Father! - Move.

788
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,775
What are you thinking about us?
Do you think this to be..

789
01:20:34,843 --> 01:20:37,937
..a playground or college? You
are a student. Remain a student.

790
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:41,276
''lf you behave like this, then l
will shoot you with this pistol.''

791
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:46,287
''Now l am saying, listen.
You father won't be released.''

792
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:49,290
l will kill him in the prison.
What will you do? Tell me?

793
01:20:49,858 --> 01:20:52,952
l will complain this
to the commissioner.

794
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:58,731
You will say this to the
commissioner? What will he do?

795
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,236
All he can do is transfer me
or suspend me for 6 months.

796
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:06,898
He can't do more
than that. Go and tell.

797
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:09,739
''Not only him, tell
this to his mother also.''

798
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:11,243
They can't harm us.

You friends think that they
can do any thing. They are fools.

''But, they can't do anything.

''Now, it's our time. Only
that will happen, which we wish.''

804

Then why didn't he come? - Look.
