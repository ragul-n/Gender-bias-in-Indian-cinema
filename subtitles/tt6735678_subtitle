2
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:16,056
It’s your brother speaking

3
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:18,973
How come you called at this hour?
Where are you?

4
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,515
I'm in Gajuwaka godown.
Listen to me carefully.

5
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:25,973
Tell me brother. - I found the killer of our son
and son-in-law.

6
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:28,848
I'll mail you their video clippings.

7
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,556
Show it to our family
and ask them to be careful

8
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,390
Okay. It’s not safe for you to be alone.

9
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:37,598
Shall I send Chalapathi?
- It’s all right. I will take care.

10
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,098
Where are you, Srinu?
Someone cut the fencing here.

11
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,223
Who must have cut it?

12
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:07,306
Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,556
Security.

14
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:16,640
Where the hell are you guys?
Security…

15
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:56,848
Nothing but ashes is left.

16
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:59,848
We confirmed it’s your brother’s body
after examining the teeth.

17
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,765
It was a very cruel person
that killed him.

18
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:05,306
He was killed quite brutally for his age.
I am very sorry, sir.

19
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:13,015
Veerabhadram must have done this
for sure.

20
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:17,515
We are in pain and
he is celebrating there

21
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:20,140
He is not human,
He is a monster.

22
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,181
[ Fire crackers bursting ]
- [ Drums sound ]

23
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,181
Come on boys!

24
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,181
What is this noise?

25
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,640
Stop it. Stop it I say.

26
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,390
Brother-in-law,
- Yes.

27
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,306
Brother-in-law, have this sweet.
- Is it your birthday today?

28
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,848
It’s our enemy’s death day.
That is why we are celebrating.

29
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,181
Someone killed Sripathi
in his factory only

30
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:48,140
Damn! He slapped me.

31
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:49,181
Idiot.

32
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:52,306
How is our enmity satisfied
when someone else kills him

33
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:55,390
Can someone else get married
on your behalf?

34
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,806
Is your hunger fulfilled
when someone else eats?

35
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,890
We should only kill our enemy
- Yes, we should kill him.

36
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:05,431
I planned everything to kill Sripathi.
But someone else killed before us.

37
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:09,598
We should only kill anyone related
to Raghupathi’s family.

38
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,848
That is when our revenge is sought.
That becomes a celebration for us.

39
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:23,931
Sir, Mr. Raghupathi is here.

40
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:26,806
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

41
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:28,431
I would have come if you informed.

42
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,015
It is not respectful of me to call
a Government officer to me

43
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,473
Take a seat, sir.

44
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:38,140
I heard about your brother.
I am very sorry, sir

45
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,848
Did you find anything
about the murderer?

46
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,223
We are working on it, sir.

47
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,890
Are you suspicious about anyone?

48
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,765
We have many businesses.
Business is common in competetion.

49
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,931
We don’t realize who is our enemy
and who is our friend.

50
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,098
We already lost three lives in our family.

51
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,056
We are not ready to lose another one.

52
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:01,890
Ask Chalapathi for any
further information.

53
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:03,473
We'll leave.

54
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:04,973
Good sir.

55
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:16,306
Brother…

56
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,473
Auditor has called from Bangalore.

57
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:22,723
There is a meeting with the foreign clients.
He is asking you to come urgently

58
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:26,306
Go.
- Ok.

59
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:27,765
Come.

60
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,515
How far is he?

61
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:02,306
According to his mobile signals,
he will enter the highway in 10 minutes.

62
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:05,015
Brother.
- Did you find anything?

63
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:09,473
You have guessed it right.
Veerabhadram is not connected to the murder

64
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:14,223
Who must have done it then?

65
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:18,223
Only two pairs of shoe marks
were found outside the burnt godown.

66
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:20,015
There are no other clues.

67
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,431
So, two people…

68
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,098
Who are they?

69
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:32,931
Ganapathi just went out.
Ask him to come back

70
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:35,556
Get ready.

71
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:37,473
Ok. - He will be in range
in a minute

72
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:53,556
Tell me, Chinna.
- Uncle… Dad is calling you home immediately.

73
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:55,640
Stop the vehicle.

74
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,556
What happened?

75
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:05,515
He was in our range.

76
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:08,598
He took a U-turn just before
we were pressing the trigger

77
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,181
No problem. His death is written
somewhere other than the highway.

78
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:14,140
Let's go.

79
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:24,640
What is it? I said I had some work
with the auditor.

80
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:26,265
Why did you call me midway?

81
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,848
I'll speak with the auditor.

82
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,806
Bangalore is not our head office
from now on.

83
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:34,348
It's our place.

84
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,431
How will we manage
such huge businesses from home?

85
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,390
We have to.

86
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,056
Reduce the volume.
- Dad,

87
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,640
Do you want us to stay home
afraid of someone?

88
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:50,640
Pandavas didn’t go on exile being afraid.
Situations demanded that

89
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:52,931
I am not afraid like you all assume.

90
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,431
It's my responsibility.

91
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,515
We have a second enemy
we are not aware of.

92
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,515
But he knows us.

93
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:03,931
So, let us all stay together
and find out about him.

94
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:09,098
When will you find out?
You couldn’t find out despite being so rich

95
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:12,931
How long can we protect
our women at home?

96
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,431
Brother-in-law’s wife is a widower already.

97
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:23,098
Get our daughter married to someone
far away from us.

98
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,556
She would be safe there.

99
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:29,431
Brother looked for an American alliance
before dying.

100
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:30,890
I liked it too.

101
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:32,765
The guy is arriving in two days.

102
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:36,556
He said he would get married
right away if everything goes well

103
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:37,931
Ok brother.

104
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:42,306
We will get her married
and send her to America.

105
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:43,931
Are you happy now?

106
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:45,848
I'm very happy.

107
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:48,556
Quickly… Give it.

108
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,473
What? Masala smells great.

109
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,098
What are you preparing??
- Eggplant curry.

110
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,223
You have done enough.
Let us do it now.

111
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:11,515
If anything goes wrong,
uncle would yell at us.

112
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:15,015
Not possible. I will be cooking today
and you will be eating it

113
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:17,556
Let her do it. She would have to cook
from tomorrow anyways

114
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:21,390
Are you going to your mom’s house?
- No...

115
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,015
We are sending you
to your in-law’s house

116
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,056
Like that’s going to happen.

117
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:28,848
Your dad said a guy is coming to see you
from America in four days

118
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,223
What? Marriage with a guy
from America?

119
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:32,473
That’s not happening.

120
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:36,556
I will only marry a guy
who stays here with us.

121
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,765
Tell that to your dad not us.

122
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:41,848
I will. I am not scared of him.

123
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,765
Brother...
- Aunt... please... don't do it.

124
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,973
That’s right.

125
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:51,390
How is it, dad? Did I put
too much of anything?

126
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,140
Yes, dear.

127
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,223
What is it, dad?
I measured everything

128
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,348
You put too much of taste, dear.

129
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:02,306
Look mom, she already started cooking well
as we spoke about wedding.

130
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:08,181
Dad.

131
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:13,098
I just learnt to cook and
you are already sending me to America

132
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,390
You should get married someday, right?

133
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:20,098
But when you are in pain here,
how can I lead a happy life there?

134
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,931
It’s not even the neighboring town.
It’s America.

135
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:26,181
We don’t even know about
the guy’s nature

136
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,306
Oh, Is that your worry?

137
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:30,056
He is Krishna Prasad.

138
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:31,890
He is working at Microsoft.

139
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,973
Good salary. But as you would
have to marry him

140
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,765
let us know if you fault him anywhere.

141
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,181
We can cancel the alliance.

142
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,431
I will get to know him and tell you. Okay?

143
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,640
You will definitely say
that he is a good guy

144
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:50,056
Sister, to cancel the alliance
like uncle said,

145
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:51,723
You should find flaws in the guy

146
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,181
Guys from our town are only flawed
in many ways.

147
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:57,848
He is coming from America.
He must be greatly flawed.

148
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,390
He might be. But how will you find out?

149
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,848
Savitri uncle will handle it.

150
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:08,556
Bloody clothes…  I feel irritated.

151
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,973
I might die of suffocation
before the plane arrives.

152
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:14,765
I will go change and come

153
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:16,431
Don’t you dare!

154
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:20,223
You can’t change until the groom arrives.

155
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:24,140
When will he come? When will
I be out of these clothes?

156
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:46,140
Sorry, sir.

157
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:48,348
Swachch Bharat doesn’t mean apologizing
after committing the mistake.

158
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,723
You have to implement it.
That’s when our country will flourish

159
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,681
Ok, sure.

160
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,806
You're Mr. Raghupathi’s son Mahendra, right?

161
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,973
Yes. And you?

162
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,515
Krishna Prasad.

163
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:06,265
You're Prasad?

164
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,890
Didn’t I tell you
he looked like Prasad?

165
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:12,806
We expected you to land in a suit.
Your attire confused us a bit.

166
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,515
Shake hands with him everyone.
- Thanks.

167
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,223
Greetings everyone.

168
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:21,431
Why are you all in suits?
- We wanted to impress you.

169
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,181
Isn’t it making us all uncomfortable?

170
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:27,348
Mr. Prasad, give us two minutes.
We will change on our way

171
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,140
Let's go.

172
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,348
Brother… He is great.

173
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,056
He could sense our discomfort right away.

174
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,431
All right, get in.
- Ok, brother.

175
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,640
Halt at some hotel on the way.
We will get changed

176
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:43,556
Ok brother.

177
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,409
Go and follow that car

178
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,110
Have you finished the Ragupathi
Son-in-law and Son?

179
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,170
No Sir, Only his team was there
in the vehicle!!

180
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,750
Then, where are they?

181
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:33,645
Our driver isn’t picking up my call.
- He will not.

182
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,562
What do you mean?

183
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,812
Veerabhadram.

184
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,395
This rail journey is due to that.

185
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:41,520
Give me that suitcase.
I will hold it

186
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:44,478
It’s all right. I will carry it.
- Your hands might hurt.

187
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,728
Even my leg hurts.
Will you carry me in your arms?

188
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,103
How is that possible?

189
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:49,728
That is why you should stick
to your work.

190
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,978
What is it now?
You want to carry something heavy, right?

191
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:52,978
Uncle…
- What, son?

192
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:53,853
Give it to me. Here…

193
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,645
Why do you strain yourself?

194
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:58,228
Lift it. Happy now? Come…

195
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,187
Are they coming?
- Yes. They are

196
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:07,853
Hey, where's your seat?

197
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:15,353
Put the bag under our seats.

198
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:28,395
Isn’t he handsome?
- That’s not enough.

199
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,395
He should be more than that.
- What else?

200
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:32,562
He has the discipline
to mind his own business.

201
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,937
He has all the traditional values
of a family man.

202
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:36,770
He respects elders.

203
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:38,895
Looks like he can’t be faulted.

204
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:41,562
You can’t say that.
Savitri uncle will decide.

205
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,020
That is why uncle told us to come here.

206
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:47,353
Train is moving. Where is Savitri uncle?

207
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:53,395

Is it? Hello.

214
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:09,812
You left your husband for me, right?
- Damn! you..

215
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:11,312

The moment I arrive at is the right time.

219
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:23,228
Where is he?
- He is the one in the dhoti.

220
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,478
Oh... He looks quite innocent.

221
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:32,103
I will expose the wild angle in him.

222
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,228
Switch on your camera.

223
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:37,145

Are you just coming casually?
- No. I have some work.

He is speaking fluent Telugu
though he is from America.

You were born and brought up here
but you are speaking in English

241
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,437
When will our country develop
with these ideologies?

Nothing much…

265
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:49,687

- They are pop singers.

281
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:44,228
I was fed up with their music.
I wanted to listen to some Telugu melodies

282
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,645
But it’s the same here.
- What? Telugu melodies, huh?

283

00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,224
So, it's two.

519
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:52,557
My target missed.
What about yours?

520
00:37:53,432 --> 00:37:56,432
My target is right on him.
- Then finish him.

521
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:58,849
Tastes good. You want to try one more?
- Brother-in-law.

522
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:01,932
It’s lunch time. They would be waiting
for us at home. Let’s go

523
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:03,391
- Ok.
- Let's go.

524
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,057
I'm ready.

525
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:24,516
I missed him.

526
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:30,557
These clowns ruined our entire plan.
- God saved him this time.

527
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,099
I will send him directly to God
the next time.

528
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:37,724
How did the fair go?
- It went well.

529
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,724
Come. Let’s eat.
- Come on, son.

530
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:40,724
Come.

531
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:42,391
Father.

532
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:44,016
Yes?
- One minute.

533
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:45,099
What is it?

534
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,016
Find out if they saw any we faces. Go.

535
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,599
[Footsteps approaching]

536
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:36,349
He is coming. Do it.

537
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:41,891
Is this fair, uncle?

538
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:44,849
How long will you blackmail like this?
- I will do it

539
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:46,474
However long I please.

540
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,266
You will get married and settle in America.
It’s a single time settlement

541
00:39:50,391 --> 00:39:53,182
I can’t pay you the amount
you are demanding.

542
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,224
I gave you a lot of money already

543
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,557
I agree I made some mistakes
in my childhood

544
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,599
You did huge mistakes in your childhood.

545
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:01,349
You must have forgotten them.

546
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:05,599
Romance with Needles Sudhakar
in the coconut field in the tenth grade…

547
00:40:06,474 --> 00:40:09,682
He gifted me a mobile back then, uncle.

548
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:12,766
If he gifts you a mobile,
you should shake hands and thank him

549
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:15,432
But not kiss him and provoke him.

550
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,766
In the engineering college,

551
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:21,224
You worked out your chemistry
with Manthena Diwakar in the physics lab

552
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:24,266
I wanted to cover two subjects
in one class.

553
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:29,349
Oh... recently you were kissing Rahul
like they do it in english movies.

554
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,182
That day I was drunk, uncle.

555
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,266
You committed mistakes in a flow.
- And I started blackmailing slowly.

556
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:39,807
What have you paid me after all?
Just 3 million rupees.

557
00:40:39,932 --> 00:40:41,057
Isn’t that enough?

558
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,349
It's not enough.

559
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:47,557
Being such a flawed person,
if you marry him and flee to America,

560
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:48,432
Who will pay me?

561
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:50,516
So, let’s go for one time settlement.

562
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,057
5 million rupees.
- 5 million rupees?

563
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:55,974
I don’t have so much money.
- You don't have the money?

564
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,224
I will immediately tell him then.

565
00:40:58,307 --> 00:41:03,682
Any guy with a conscience
would never marry you.

566
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,432
Oh no... uncle, I'm begging you

567
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:10,099
Please don’t ruin this marriage.
Please uncle.

568
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:11,974
What the hell is this?

569
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,682
Have you heard everything?
- Yes.

570
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:18,682
I see.

571
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:20,432
First guy in the coconut field,

572
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:22,474
Second guy in the chemistry lab

573
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:24,432
And third guy in the pub…

574
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,599
Am I the fourth guy?

575
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:28,474
Very good. You're good at math.

576
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:32,224
Don’t shout and expose her image
and ruin my earnings

577
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:34,807
Pack your bags silently
and fly off to America.

578
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:35,891
Prasad.

579
00:41:36,016 --> 00:41:39,766
Don’t book a flight ticket
in a hurry and leave

580
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:40,849
One minute.

581
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,682
My house number in America is four.

582
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:47,099
My car number is four.
My date of birth is four.

583
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:51,141
It’s a coincidence that my number
in your life is also four.

584
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:56,099
The mistakes made at a tender age

585
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:57,891
How can you misunderstand her?

586
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,182
With those mistakes...

587
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,932
Let's us differentiate
between good and bad people.

588
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:04,516
That’s not my worry.

589
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:06,224
All these years he's been
blackmailing you,

590
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:09,349
Has been mentally torturing you
for money.

591
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:10,891
Your Savitri uncle.

592
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:12,891
He committed a very big crime.

593
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:16,224
If this was America, he would be
in prison for 600 years

594
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:19,391
But he can’t threaten you anymore.

595
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:22,599
I recorded everything in my mobile.
- What? recording?

596
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:26,599
I will play this to your dad, uncle
and brother in a home theatre

597
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:28,266
Home theatre?
- Why?

598
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:30,307
Shall I play it in Alankar theatre?
The entire village can watch it.

599
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:32,641
Bro, I am pleading you.

600
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:35,599
Please forgive me. I didn’t know
your lucky number was four.

601
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:37,516
Not possible. - They kill me
if you show them the video.

602
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:41,307
This should be a lesson to every uncle
teasing his nephew

603
00:42:41,432 --> 00:42:43,682
This family will rip my skin off.
- They should.

604
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:46,641
Have you looked at her innocent face?
- Her face?

605
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,391
She was begging you.

606
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,141
Did I ask you to cry? Did I?

607
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:51,766
She over acted, sir.

608
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:54,432
Prasad, you're a true gentleman.

609
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:58,599
But family members would feel bad
if they know about it.

610
00:42:58,932 --> 00:43:01,849
Let him go. He will face his fate.

611
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:02,807
Please.

612
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:03,932
All right.

613
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:06,766
For safety purpose
I am keeping the video with me

614
00:43:07,682 --> 00:43:08,682
What about you?
- I will shut everything.

615
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:10,099
- That's right.
- Thank you bro.

616
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:11,516
Thank god.

617
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:13,557
Pack your bags. You're definitely
going to America

618
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:15,974
- I don’t want him.
- He won’t leave you.

619
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:21,349
Hello.

620
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,557
This is commissioner speaking.
- Tell me.

621
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:26,641
While we were investigating
at the fair earlier, we found a bullet.

622
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:29,391
It was shot from a high precision rifle.

623
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,391
The accuracy range is 900 to 1200 meters.

624
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:36,099
It means, we can shoot our target
from a distance of one kilometer.

625
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:38,474
This is definitely a professional killer’s work.

626
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:39,474
Because...

627
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,224
There is no one in our State
who could handle such rifle.

628
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:49,391
If I guessed it right,
murderer is definitely a foreigner

629
00:43:49,932 --> 00:43:51,557
Are you giving me information?

630
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:54,057
Or warning me to be alert?

631
00:43:54,474 --> 00:44:00,057
Murderer is making sure
he doesn’t leave any clue behind

632
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:01,391
They won't get caught.

633
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:03,474
We would have to plan and catch them.

634
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,974
You have to show me further
development in this case

635
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:09,391
Otherwise, I would have to meet
your higher authorities

636
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:11,474
Ok sir.

637
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:16,224
Sir.

638
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:19,891
Whom do you have to meet?
- Sir.

639
00:44:19,974 --> 00:44:20,974
Which sir?

640
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:22,682
I don’t know his name.

641
00:44:22,766 --> 00:44:24,974
But I can recognize him.
He saved my life.

642
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:27,057
Tell me properly.
- Whom do you have to meet?

643
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,891
That guy talking on the phone…
It's him.

644
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:31,849
Sir.

645
00:44:32,432 --> 00:44:34,016
Hey! Hey!

646
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:34,932
Stop.

647
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:36,974
Some stranger is here.
catch him.

648
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:38,391
Don't leave him.
hold him.

649
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:39,766
Stop him right there.

650
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,724
Do you know him?
- Who is he?

651
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:59,307
I am Naresh, sir.
Research student from Chennai IIT.

652
00:44:59,391 --> 00:45:00,266
Why did you come here?

653
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:04,516
I was lying on the road dieing
and sir saved my life

654
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:07,641
Yes, brother. Son-in-law saved this guy.

655
00:45:08,891 --> 00:45:11,307
I'm forever in his debt.

656
00:45:11,516 --> 00:45:15,016
That is why I want to name
my thesis after him

657
00:45:15,224 --> 00:45:17,474
I just came to find out his name.
That’s all.

658
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,766
He would have been almost dead.

659
00:45:20,307 --> 00:45:21,807
Do you even know
the value of life?

660
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:24,557
Abdul Kalam's life is dedicated
to respect the country.

661
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:27,141
NTR's life was about self respect.

662
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:29,974
Mother Teresa's life
is the respect of motherhood.

663
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:33,766
Even the driver who takes us home safe
also has a life

664
00:45:33,974 --> 00:45:35,349
How could you end a life
so easily?

665
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:36,932
It's our mistake.

666
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:38,391
I'm so sorry.

667
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,974
He is a scientist.
Apologize to him everyone

668
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,349
[ Goons ] Sorry brother.

669
00:45:42,682 --> 00:45:43,724
Sorry brother.

670
00:45:43,932 --> 00:45:46,432
Drop our scientist broher in the car.
- Ok bro.

671
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:47,724
One minute, son.

672
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,807
You are naming your thesis
after my son-in-law, right?

673
00:45:56,891 --> 00:45:58,391
He is Krishna Prasad.

674
00:45:58,599 --> 00:45:59,516
Ok sir.

675
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:03,807
If you don’t mind, you are free
to work in our research lab

676
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:04,974
Ok sir.

677
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,266
Thanks, uncle.

678
00:46:17,516 --> 00:46:19,307
He is doing a bit much.

679
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:22,641
No. He is preceding everyone.

680
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:28,141
I will end this in the coconut fields
tomorrow

681
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:30,224
- What will you do?
- You will see.

682
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:36,266
We should empty the coconut
and pour some vodka in it.

683
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:37,724
- What are you doing, uncle?
- This is wine.

684
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:39,516
This Jin and then some Rum.

685
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:42,266
What’s happening now?

686
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:46,182
If you drink one of these,
the inner person comes out.

687
00:46:46,391 --> 00:46:50,391
If he drinks this cocktail.
He will dance.

688
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:54,474
From today, he will be scared to touch
even a glass of water

689
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:58,932
- What's this for?
-  It covers up the smell.

690
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,057
- You are great, uncle.

to carry this operation.

1033
01:14:45,055 --> 01:14:46,221
Major Sanjeev.

1034
01:14:47,888 --> 01:14:51,263
I will send Captain Amit and Satyaveer
along with him

1035
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:08,971
Tell me. Where is your base camp
at the border?

1036
01:15:09,513 --> 01:15:12,346
I want the entire information,
along with the route map

1037
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,096
To save lives,

1038
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,513
Indian Army isn’t so cheap
to sell its country

1039
01:15:44,305 --> 01:15:48,888
Every soldier that dies in the war
has the enemy’s bullets in their heart

1040
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:50,346
Do you know why?

1041
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,180
Because our soldiers are not cowards
like yours

1042
01:16:00,596 --> 01:16:03,013
Sanjeev, north east position clear.

1043
01:16:06,846 --> 01:16:07,971
Sanjeev on your right.

1044
01:16:09,638 --> 01:16:10,471
Thank you.

1045
01:16:10,513 --> 01:16:11,305
You're welcome.

1046
01:16:13,846 --> 01:16:16,555
Stop your speech or I will shoot you down.
Understand?

1047
01:16:16,596 --> 01:16:17,555
Kill me.

1048
01:16:17,763 --> 01:16:20,638
The faster you kill me,
the better for you.

1049
01:16:20,721 --> 01:16:23,346
Every second you delay it,

1050
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:26,180
Your death comes looking for you

1051
01:16:46,971 --> 01:16:47,846
Come on.

1052
01:16:48,305 --> 01:16:50,471
How? How?

1053
01:16:53,638 --> 01:16:55,638
I knew Indian Army was sharp.

1054
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,471
But I didn’t know it was this sharp.

1055
01:16:59,305 --> 01:17:01,430
Hey says, you guys aren't afraid of death.

1056
01:17:02,555 --> 01:17:04,305
Is it true?
True?

1057
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:05,721
Is it true?

1058
01:17:08,096 --> 01:17:09,596
It's true.

1059
01:17:32,138 --> 01:17:33,680
Amite execut.
- Ok.

1060
01:17:42,221 --> 01:17:45,055
[ Soldiers humming song ]

1061
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:53,763
Relax. Relax.
- Sir. Sir.

1062
01:17:54,888 --> 01:17:55,680
Thanks.

1063
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,305
Thanks for saving my life.

1064
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:58,596
It’s my duty, sir.

1065
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:00,138
Sit down.

1066
01:18:01,513 --> 01:18:02,555
Sir tea.

1067
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:04,388
Oh thank you.
- Welcome sir.

1068
01:18:06,263 --> 01:18:07,930
Sanjeev.
- Sir?

1069
01:18:08,263 --> 01:18:12,221
I wish to give 10 days off
to someone on your team.

1070
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:15,221
Give it to Sanjeev, sir. It’s been 3 years
since he went home

1071
01:18:15,846 --> 01:18:19,721
By the way, you loved a girl
for a really long time

1072
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:21,388
But hid it from her.

1073
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,013
Tell her at least now.

1074
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:24,471
How does sir know?

1075
01:18:25,471 --> 01:18:27,263
You must be wondering
how I know.

1076
01:18:27,763 --> 01:18:31,430
You told everyone about
your love except her.

1077
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,346
You are going on a leave this time.

1078
01:18:33,513 --> 01:18:37,388
You are expressing your love
and marrying her.

1079
01:18:38,055 --> 01:18:38,971
- Ok sir.
- Good.

1080
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:46,638
What’s that smoke?

1081
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:48,721
Car is burning. Call the fire engine.
- Ok sir.

1082
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,971
Car is burning. Get down.

1083
01:18:52,555 --> 01:18:54,846
Car isn’t burning.
We are smoking cigarettes inside

1084
01:18:54,971 --> 01:18:55,888
Cigarettes?

1085
01:18:56,013 --> 01:18:57,013
If we smoke at home,
parents sue us

1086
01:18:57,055 --> 01:18:57,846
When we come out,
people like you do

1087
01:18:57,888 --> 01:18:59,513
“What happened to this city?

1088
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:01,596
- There is smoke
- and dust everywhere.

1089
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,471
No one says a word”
- They are beating us up.

1090
01:19:03,555 --> 01:19:05,555
Doesn’t your dad question
about chain smoking?

1091
01:19:05,638 --> 01:19:06,846
They will ask.
- We won't give them.

1092
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:09,013
Do what you want.
- That’s what we do.

1093
01:19:09,138 --> 01:19:09,888
It's put off.

1094
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,846
Brother’s flight must have landed.
Take chewing gums

1095
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:16,763
Forget landing, Flight must
have returned also.

1096
01:19:17,388 --> 01:19:18,096
Brother.

1097
01:19:18,305 --> 01:19:20,430
How are you?
- I'm good brother.

1098
01:19:25,055 --> 01:19:26,096
What’s the cigarette smell?

1099
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:30,513
Dad took the car this morning
and went to the pension office.

1100
01:19:32,388 --> 01:19:33,680
He still didn't change.

1101
01:19:34,096 --> 01:19:34,846
Let's go.

1102
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:37,555
Give him.

1103
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,721
- You give him.
- No. you give him.

1104
01:19:38,763 --> 01:19:39,763
What’s the discussion?

1105
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:42,638
We got orders from Delhi.
- Orders from Delhi?

1106
01:19:43,013 --> 01:19:43,555
What does it read?

1107
01:19:43,596 --> 01:19:45,763
You were granted leave
to succeed your love

1108
01:19:45,888 --> 01:19:47,346
Not to waste your time brother.

1109
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:49,221
No. Listen to me...
- What's your problem?

1110
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:52,096
Even hundreds of enemies
don’t scare you.

1111
01:19:52,263 --> 01:19:54,430
Why are you scared of Gita?

1112
01:19:55,013 --> 01:19:56,680
War is easier than love.

1113
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:58,680
Brother, you have to propose her today

1114
01:19:58,888 --> 01:20:00,721
You have to get married on this trip.
- Shut up.

1115
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,596
What now?
You want me to propose, right?

1116
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:03,930
Ok, I'll do it.

1117
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,846
Bro, wear these clothes.

1118
01:20:06,138 --> 01:20:08,430
- Spray this.
- Hide this.

1119
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:10,013
Give this to her.

1120
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:17,346
Brother.

1121
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,263
Don’t return alone.
- Come as a couple, bro.

1122
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,180
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1123
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:25,513
I would like to meet Dr. Gita, Microbiologist…
- Who are you?

1124
01:20:25,555 --> 01:20:27,930
Tell her Akash is here to meet her urgently.
- Please wait.

1125
01:20:28,305 --> 01:20:29,013
Dust.

1126
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:34,471
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1127
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,346
I would like to meet Dr. Gita.
Tell her Sanjeev is here.

1128
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:38,930
don’t mind to wait.

1129
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:41,013
Please wait, sir. I will call you.
- Advocate?

1130
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:42,805
Sorry.
- Sorry.

1131
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:43,930
Sorry bro.

1132
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,471
I'm Akash.
- Sanjeev.

1133
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:46,763
Nice to meet you.

1134
01:20:47,263 --> 01:20:49,763
If you don’t mind,
choose amongst the fingers

1135
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,346
Why?
- Do it bro.

1136
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:52,930
Ok.
- Wow, yes.

1137
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:53,888
My love is successful.

1138
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,555
Love?
- Yes bro.

1139
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,221
Basically, I am from California.

1140
01:20:57,555 --> 01:20:58,971
Operation Manager at Microsoft.

1141
01:20:59,596 --> 01:21:01,680
Annual salary would be one million dollars.

1142
01:21:01,971 --> 01:21:03,930
Dollar is equal to 68 rupees now, bro.
- So great.

1143
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:06,680
Anyways, I came to India a week before.

1144
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:07,930
Six days back...

1145
01:21:08,305 --> 01:21:09,305
I saw a girl.

1146
01:21:09,596 --> 01:21:12,013
Five days back, I've decided
that she is my wife.

1147
01:21:12,221 --> 01:21:13,471
- Interesting.
- Since four days back

1148
01:21:13,555 --> 01:21:14,805
I am having continuous dreams

1149
01:21:15,388 --> 01:21:16,596
And three days back...

1150
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,388
My hard disk crashed.

1151
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,346
And two days back

1152
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:23,013
I took my parents
and proposed to her

1153
01:21:23,846 --> 01:21:25,096
When I called her one day back,

1154
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,346
I mean yesterday,
today she would take a decision.

1155
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:29,805
It will be okay, right?

1156
01:21:30,055 --> 01:21:30,596
Bro.

1157
01:21:30,805 --> 01:21:32,846
That girl must be crazy to reject you.

1158
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,513
Thank you, bro. You should definitely
attend my wedding. I insist…

1159
01:21:36,013 --> 01:21:36,846
I'll come for sure.

1160
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:38,596
Sir, madam is calling you.
- Ok.

1161
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,180
Sir, she is calling you too.
- Ok.

1162
01:21:40,638 --> 01:21:41,305
Come bro.

1163
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:46,305
Gita.

1164
01:21:48,805 --> 01:21:49,846
Gita.

1165
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:52,430
- Gita.
- Gita.

1166
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:16,263
Hi.

1167
01:22:16,388 --> 01:22:17,388
Hi Gita.
- How are you?

1168
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,971
- I'm good.
- I like your shirt.

1169
01:22:19,138 --> 01:22:21,013
It’s not a shirt. It’s a jacket.
- Thanks bro.

1170
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:22,180
Mom selected it.

1171
01:22:22,388 --> 01:22:24,805
- How is you mom?
- Waiting for your response.

1172
01:22:24,971 --> 01:22:26,055
Gita.

1173
01:22:27,138 --> 01:22:27,971
Sorry, Sanjeev…

1174
01:22:28,055 --> 01:22:30,846
I totally forgot you
in the joy of seeing Akash.

1175
01:22:31,596 --> 01:22:33,846
He is my best friend, Sanjeev.

1176
01:22:34,138 --> 01:22:35,096
Oh...

1177
01:22:35,638 --> 01:22:38,346
I don’t make any decision
without asking Sanjeev.

1178
01:22:39,013 --> 01:22:40,721
Thank god he came at the right time.

1179
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:42,555
Sanjeev, he is Mr. Akash.

1180
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:44,430
Though he knows that I don't have anyone.

1181
01:22:44,596 --> 01:22:47,138
He came along with his parents
and proposed for a marriage.

1182
01:22:47,263 --> 01:22:48,430
He is a gentleman, isn’t it?

1183
01:22:48,513 --> 01:22:49,138
Ya.

1184
01:22:49,846 --> 01:22:51,263
Very good… I am really happy.

1185
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:52,096
See you.

1186
01:22:52,263 --> 01:22:55,055
Wait, Sanjeev… I feel strong
if you are with me right now.

1187
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:59,805
The reason I asked
for two days time

1188
01:23:00,513 --> 01:23:03,263
Because I love a guy sincerely

1189
01:23:07,055 --> 01:23:08,096
No issues.

1190
01:23:08,638 --> 01:23:09,555
Quite common actually…

1191
01:23:09,888 --> 01:23:12,846
He didn’t love you back, right?
- That idiot didn’t even get it.

1192
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:14,930
- Who’s that idiot?
- Why should I tell you?

1193
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:17,555
Would you tell me
if you loved someone?

1194
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,138
I didn’t even tell the girl.
Why would I tell you?

1195
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,096
Bro, one minute.

1196
01:23:20,388 --> 01:23:22,263
Bro, why are you fighting?
It’s quite common

1197
01:23:22,346 --> 01:23:23,846
Bro, I'm talking on your behalf.

1198
01:23:24,013 --> 01:23:24,971
Ok. Ok.

1199
01:23:25,638 --> 01:23:27,346
Whom do you guys love?
at least give me a clue.

1200
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:29,096
My lovers height 6.2

1201
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:30,138
He is very shy.

1202
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:33,180
My lover has a big mouth,
she keeps talking.

1203
01:23:33,721 --> 01:23:34,971
Ok, ok, one minute.

1204
01:23:35,888 --> 01:23:37,513
The height you were talking about
it's not him right?

1205
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:39,055
No, not him.
- Ok, super.

1206
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:41,221
The girl you were talking about
is obviously not her

1207
01:23:41,305 --> 01:23:42,180
No chance.

1208
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,346
Super… Quite interesting…
Continue…

1209
01:23:44,763 --> 01:23:45,263
Continue.

1210
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:47,388
My lover likes Timex watch.

1211
01:23:49,846 --> 01:23:51,680
My lover really like white color.

1212
01:23:51,763 --> 01:23:53,013
Wait, wait,
one minute.

1213
01:23:53,221 --> 01:23:54,805
This isn’t the white dress
you' re talking about, right?

1214
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:58,721
The Timex watch you were talking about
is obviously not his.

1215
01:23:58,805 --> 01:23:59,638
No, no.

1216
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:00,971
Thank you.

1217
01:24:01,305 --> 01:24:02,971
I'm relaxed.
Continue… Continue…

1218
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:05,263
Tell me his name
if your love is true

1219
01:24:05,305 --> 01:24:06,430
That’s the spirit.
Come on… Tell me.

1220
01:24:06,513 --> 01:24:07,680
His name is Sanjeev…

1221
01:24:07,846 --> 01:24:08,388
Sanjeev?

1222
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:09,971
Girl’s name?
- Girl's name?

1223
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:11,638
Gita.

1224
01:24:13,763 --> 01:24:16,305
I understood when you came here
with a bouquet.

1225
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:19,013
It took you three years to say this.

1226
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,638
Will you give it at least now?

1227
01:24:30,513 --> 01:24:31,346
Hey bro.

1228
01:24:32,388 --> 01:24:35,013
Where are you going?
- I understood clearly, bro.

1229
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:36,846
I'm going to Hollywood.

1230
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:39,930
And settle with a porn star
though it gets costly

1231
01:24:40,221 --> 01:24:41,930
You carry on.

1232
01:24:43,138 --> 01:24:44,721
You've wasted three years already.

1233
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:46,638
I can’t even wait for another
three minutes.

1234
01:24:47,013 --> 01:24:50,055
Hold my hand and take me home
right now.

1235
01:24:55,888 --> 01:24:56,930
What must have happened?

1236
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:58,680
What did she say, bro?
yes or no?

1237
01:24:59,638 --> 01:25:01,096
Oh, she rejected.

1238
01:25:08,055 --> 01:25:09,096
Yes.

1239
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:17,763
Mother, bless me.

1240
01:25:17,805 --> 01:25:19,721
Who are you dear?
- My name is Gita.

1241
01:25:19,805 --> 01:25:22,596
Sanjeev and I have been in love
since three years.

1242
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:26,138
You adore Sai Baba.
You are crazy about your family.

1243
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:29,013
You drink coffee four times in a day.

1244
01:25:29,096 --> 01:25:31,971
You really love the show
‘Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu’.

1245
01:25:32,805 --> 01:25:36,096
You never get angry
but are extremely sensitive.

1246
01:25:36,388 --> 01:25:37,680
But one thing is true.

1247
01:25:37,763 --> 01:25:41,013
Accept me and I will look after you
like a mother.

1248
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:45,638
She is the ideal girl.

1249
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:47,805
You found the perfect daughter-in-law

1250
01:25:48,305 --> 01:25:49,346
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings.

1251
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:52,055
Sanju, I really like this girl.

1252
01:25:52,305 --> 01:25:54,138
Come in, dear.
- Come in.

1253
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:04,805
Surprise.

1254
01:26:07,805 --> 01:26:10,638
Gita bought me new glasses.
How are they?

1255
01:26:11,596 --> 01:26:12,805
They are good.

1256
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:15,888
You said you will look after me
like my daughter

1257
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:18,013
But she would take care of me
like her mom.

1258
01:26:22,013 --> 01:26:23,971
Examination results are in February.

1259
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:26,971
Jawaharlal Nehru Technological Institute
of Hyderabad

1260
01:26:27,096 --> 01:26:30,263
B. Tech Aeronautical Engineering…
Topper of the university…

1261
01:26:30,513 --> 01:26:31,388
Ajay.

1262
01:26:32,013 --> 01:26:32,971
Superb bro.

1263
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,971
Superb bro.
- Thanks brother.

1264
01:26:35,138 --> 01:26:36,305
I knew you will achieve it.

1265
01:26:36,471 --> 01:26:37,430
Bro... what about the bike?

1266
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,680
I will buy it right now. Come on.
- Does he really need a bike?

1267
01:26:39,846 --> 01:26:41,763
Dad, he studied better
than we expected.

1268
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:43,888
When else would he enjoy riding?
Come with me.

1269
01:26:44,935 --> 01:26:46,352
Please select your model.

1270
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:49,227
I want a pulsar in red color. 220 CC.

1271
01:26:49,393 --> 01:26:52,102
Four stroke… DTS oil cool engine…
With alloy wheels

1272
01:26:52,185 --> 01:26:53,810
Registration number 1510.

1273
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,060
Why 1510?

1274
01:26:55,227 --> 01:26:56,893
It’s Abdul Kalam’s birthday date.

1275
01:26:56,977 --> 01:26:57,852
Ok.

1276
01:26:57,935 --> 01:27:02,310
Sir, a guy just got a bike
with the same specifications delivered.

1277
01:27:02,435 --> 01:27:03,393
It’s over there. check it out.

1278
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,310
Surprise.

1279
01:27:07,602 --> 01:27:08,435
Why did you buy it?

1280
01:27:08,602 --> 01:27:10,435
Why shouldn’t I buy for Ajay?

1281
01:27:10,518 --> 01:27:11,935
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1282
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:13,185
Thank you.
- Drive safe.

1283
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:16,602
Thanks.

1284
01:27:16,768 --> 01:27:18,310
I don’t need thanks.

1285
01:27:18,768 --> 01:27:19,810
This is enough.

1286
01:27:38,977 --> 01:27:43,602
"The moment eyes meet…
The moment lips meet…"

1287
01:27:43,893 --> 01:27:48,143
"This moment with you is forever"

1288
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:53,393
"The moment eyes blink…
The moment sweet tears are shed"

1289
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:58,185
"This moment with you is forever"

1290
01:27:58,518 --> 01:28:02,602
"This moment is to be visited
again and again"

1291
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:07,143
"Every moment is to be
cherished with you"

1292
01:28:08,477 --> 01:28:13,227
"Do you know it, my heart?
The moment we take a step together"

1293
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:17,977
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every second passes like a century"

1294
01:28:18,185 --> 01:28:22,977
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every moment that I am with you"

1295
01:28:23,102 --> 01:28:27,560
"Do you know it, my heart?
The world is at my feet"

1296
01:28:52,268 --> 01:28:56,810
"Any minute spent with you"

1297
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,102
"Every moment is a sweet memory"

1298
01:29:02,227 --> 01:29:11,477
"Tears tend to be pleasant,
As your presence becomes my temple"

1299
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:16,518
"There is anxiety as
I read our names together"

1300
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:21,477
"Every second unites
to make it our time"

1301
01:29:21,852 --> 01:29:30,727
"To the body diverted by youth,
These moments are mesmerizing"

1302
01:29:31,685 --> 01:29:36,518
"Do you know it, my heart?
The moment we take a step together"

1303
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,143
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every second passes like a century"

1304
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:46,227
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every moment that I am with you"

1305
01:29:46,352 --> 01:29:51,102
"Do you know it, my heart?
The world is at my feet"

1306
01:30:20,435 --> 01:30:25,018
"Before this sweet moment turns sour"

1307
01:30:25,227 --> 01:30:30,227
"I will save you with all my life"

1308
01:30:30,393 --> 01:30:34,935
"Before this magical moment disappear"

1309
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:39,810
"Shall I hide you in my heart forever?"

1310
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:44,768
"Are these seconds or sweet poems?
Are these seconds or centuries of love?"

1311
01:30:44,852 --> 01:30:49,727
"I wait in this bewilderment for you"

1312
01:30:50,018 --> 01:30:54,227
"I can’t manage to catch my breath"

1313
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:59,310
"I can never get enough of this high"

1314
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:04,685
"Do you know it, my heart?
The moment we take a step together"

1315
01:31:04,727 --> 01:31:09,310
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every second passes like a century"

1316
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:14,393
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every moment that I am with you"

1317
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:19,268
"Do you know it, my heart?
The world is at my feet"

1318
01:31:40,018 --> 01:31:41,685
Hey Ajay… Come fast.

1319
01:31:42,018 --> 01:31:43,602
We have many invitations to distribute.

1320
01:31:44,018 --> 01:31:45,685
Why are you still coughing?

1321
01:31:45,893 --> 01:31:47,018
Didn’t you recover yet?

1322
01:31:48,143 --> 01:31:49,477
Let’s go to the hospital.

1323
01:31:50,852 --> 01:31:51,518
Ajay...

1324
01:31:51,643 --> 01:31:53,560
What happened?
Hey. Hey.

1325
01:31:54,018 --> 01:31:55,227
- What happened?
- Look at him.

1326
01:31:55,435 --> 01:31:57,018
Ajay, what happened dear?

1327
01:31:57,393 --> 01:31:58,685
Oh no. Blood.

1328
01:31:58,768 --> 01:31:59,560
Sanju.

1329
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:01,310
Sanju, come fast.
- What happened?

1330
01:32:01,435 --> 01:32:02,727
What happened?
- Look what’s wrong with him.

1331
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:04,560
What happened, Ajay?

1332
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:05,185
Ajay.

1333
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:07,352
Ajay.
- He is sacring me.

1334
01:32:07,477 --> 01:32:08,477
Ajay.

1335
01:32:19,643 --> 01:32:21,143
Why so many tests for cough, doctor?

1336
01:32:22,852 --> 01:32:24,602
He is not even getting
enough sleep recently.

1337
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,518
It must be body heat.

1338
01:32:26,602 --> 01:32:27,727
Sir… Reports.

1339
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,810
Look at this report.

1340
01:32:30,643 --> 01:32:32,643
Bronchogenic Carcinoma.

1341
01:32:33,143 --> 01:32:33,893
What does it mean?

1342
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:34,977
Lung cancer.

1343
01:32:37,227 --> 01:32:39,227
Don't we have a treatment doctor?

1344
01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:41,602
It’s in an advanced stage.

1345
01:32:42,393 --> 01:32:44,560
It’s already late.

1346
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:47,102
It has spread to the brain and liver.

1347
01:32:47,602 --> 01:32:50,685
As he was young,
symptoms didn’t appear until now.

1348
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:53,810
As far as I know,
we can’t help him in anyway

1349
01:32:54,143 --> 01:32:55,352
I'm so sorry.

1350
01:33:20,268 --> 01:33:21,643
Since when are you used to this?

1351
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:23,268
This is the reason behind it.

1352
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,560
Quit it. Quit it right away.

1353
01:33:28,518 --> 01:33:29,560
Hey Ajay...

1354
01:33:29,935 --> 01:33:32,227
Sorry bother...

1355
01:33:33,727 --> 01:33:35,393
Sorry I hit you in pain.

1356
01:33:35,685 --> 01:33:36,643
Sorry.

1357
01:33:37,768 --> 01:33:38,810
Please quit it.

1358
01:33:39,477 --> 01:33:41,143
I am unable to quit

1359
01:33:41,935 --> 01:33:44,560
I am telling you as a brother.
Quit it.

1360
01:33:44,977 --> 01:33:46,393
Everything will be back to normal.

1361
01:33:46,852 --> 01:33:49,810
I'll die in a month
How will I ever be normal?

1362
01:33:50,602 --> 01:33:52,060
I cheated everyone.

1363
01:33:52,352 --> 01:33:53,268
You.

1364
01:33:53,810 --> 01:33:54,727
Mom.

1365
01:33:55,227 --> 01:33:56,060
Dad.

1366
01:33:57,185 --> 01:33:58,477
Abdul Kalam.

1367
01:34:00,268 --> 01:34:04,060
I dreamt to serve the country
and earn good name.

1368
01:34:04,893 --> 01:34:06,268
You can do everything.

1369
01:34:11,435 --> 01:34:14,227
This shattered all my dreams, bro.

1370
01:34:19,185 --> 01:34:20,893
Please don’t say that.

1371
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:23,018
I'm here for you.

1372
01:34:24,393 --> 01:34:25,935
That's my strength brother.

1373
01:34:27,685 --> 01:34:29,768
You can take good care
of mom and dad.

1374
01:34:30,727 --> 01:34:32,935
I can’t show my face to anyone now.

1375
01:34:33,518 --> 01:34:34,477
Sorry brother.

1376
01:34:34,685 --> 01:34:35,893
Please forgive me.

1377
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,102
Ajay.

1378
01:34:41,893 --> 01:34:42,852
Ajay.

1379

1384

Ajay.

1385
01:34:56,185 --> 01:34:58,560
You had a lot of dreams.

1386
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:01,935
I didn’t expect to see you like this.

1387
01:35:03,935 --> 01:35:07,768
Gita, ask him to look at me once.

1388
01:35:26,102 --> 01:35:26,935
Sanjeev.

1389
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:27,977
Gita.

1390
01:35:28,852 --> 01:35:30,643
Have you seen Ajay’s
post mortem reports?

1391
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,602
We thought only the lungs
were damaged.

1392
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,393
Even the brain and liver were affected.

1393
01:35:36,685 --> 01:35:38,102
It’s called distance spread.

1394
01:35:39,102 --> 01:35:42,727
Only the people with this habit
for over 20 years get affected.

1395
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:45,227
But Ajay is 20 years old.

1396
01:35:45,518 --> 01:35:48,768
He must be into some other drugs.

1397
01:36:45,727 --> 01:36:47,768
Everyone in our gang is used
to this tiger brand.

1398
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:49,352
We are smoking since a year, bro.

1399
01:36:49,852 --> 01:36:53,268
We started smoking it to boost
our concentration during exams

1400
01:36:53,352 --> 01:36:55,060
Now we are addicted to it.

1401
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:57,393
We have to test you immediately.

1402
01:37:06,435 --> 01:37:07,393
Sanjeev.

1403
01:37:12,643 --> 01:37:15,518
Even these two will have to face
the consequences like Ajay

1404
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:22,727
Test these smokes too.

1405
01:37:22,935 --> 01:37:23,602
Ok.

1406
01:38:04,102 --> 01:38:05,727
Sanjeev, come with me.

1407
01:38:09,435 --> 01:38:10,477
Why have we come here?

1408
01:38:10,768 --> 01:38:12,810
There is a lot more
we need to know.

1409
01:38:13,435 --> 01:38:14,310
Hello Gita.

1410
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:17,268
They are from the Anti Tobacco organization
you wanted to meet

1411
01:38:17,935 --> 01:38:19,852
Sir, please go through this report.

1412
01:38:22,935 --> 01:38:23,685
Very good.

1413
01:38:24,143 --> 01:38:27,602
This report exposes
how dangerous Tiger brand is.

1414
01:38:28,018 --> 01:38:29,268
Come with me once.

1415
01:38:33,393 --> 01:38:35,977
They are all people subjected to cancer
due to contaminated cigarettes

1416
01:38:36,185 --> 01:38:37,893
And other forms of tobacco.

1417
01:38:38,477 --> 01:38:41,893
It’s all a dark business. These brands
don’t have Government approval

1418
01:38:42,435 --> 01:38:46,018
Many organizations like us
are fighting against this in India

1419
01:38:46,477 --> 01:38:49,518
It's increasing day by day
but not reducing.

1420
01:38:56,268 --> 01:38:58,518
Everyone fights to lead a great life

1421
01:38:58,643 --> 01:39:01,727
They are fighting to die peacefully.

1422
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:03,143
Uncle.

1423
01:39:05,893 --> 01:39:07,310
Passive smoking case, sir.

1424
01:39:08,268 --> 01:39:10,852
Do you smoke?

1425
01:39:13,852 --> 01:39:14,518
No dear.

1426
01:39:14,727 --> 01:39:17,893
Don’t smoke near kids, uncle.

1427
01:39:18,435 --> 01:39:21,352
It affects us.

1428
01:39:22,018 --> 01:39:26,393
Even your kids will get
cancer like me.

1429
01:39:27,268 --> 01:39:31,768
I pray to God every day, uncle.

1430
01:39:33,185 --> 01:39:34,185
What do you pray?

1431
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,310
I pray that no one gets cancer
like me.

1432
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,477
No one else will be affected.

1433
01:39:47,227 --> 01:39:50,185
Medical report suggests these
contaminated cigarettes lead to cancer.

1434
01:39:51,477 --> 01:39:54,393
This is the post mortem report
of my brother who died smoking it.

1435
01:39:55,435 --> 01:39:58,310
These two filed a complaint
saying they were affected by it

1436
01:39:59,518 --> 01:40:01,977
Please take an immediate action
on the Tiger brand.

1437
01:40:03,685 --> 01:40:05,185
All the reports are fine.

1438
01:40:05,352 --> 01:40:08,143
But who does the Tiger brand belong to?
Where is this product being manufactured?

1439
01:40:08,352 --> 01:40:10,435
We don’t even know if an Indian
or a foreigner owns it.

1440
01:40:10,685 --> 01:40:12,185
Whom do we take an action on?

1441
01:40:13,102 --> 01:40:14,143
On this box?

1442
01:40:16,018 --> 01:40:18,102
These habits are quite common
in people these days.

1443
01:40:19,018 --> 01:40:22,143
We need a committed system to stop it.

1444
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:25,435
We need a committed system to stop it.

1445
01:40:25,602 --> 01:40:27,727
I will forward it to the
Commissioner’s office.

1446
01:40:31,102 --> 01:40:33,185
Sanjeev, he is right.

1447
01:40:33,393 --> 01:40:36,060
We need a team to stop it.

1448
01:40:39,977 --> 01:40:42,435
We are that team.

1449
01:40:47,518 --> 01:40:49,477
You are on duty even on off days.

1450
01:40:49,602 --> 01:40:52,268

It's in the country too

I will ask everyone to report to you.

But remember one thing.
- Sir.

1458
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,935
You shouldn’t directly involve
in such civil matters.

1459

Be careful. - Yes sir.

- No one has his details.

who the owner is

1475

- All the go downs - At once.

No… The owner might escape
if we do so.

I will talk to you later
- Okay, sir.

1478

How do we catch him them?

1479
01:42:57,977 --> 01:43:00,185
When our enemy knows
he has another enemy,

1480
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,185
He will come searching for us.

1481

- What happened?

Someone created a Facebook page
on our Tiger brand

02:09:40,685 --> 02:09:44,102
"You have to spread
your kindness to all"

1901
02:09:44,352 --> 02:09:47,935
"The skies are frightened
by the thunder"

1902
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:51,602
"As your speed comes on attack,
current catches shock"

1903
02:09:52,019 --> 02:09:55,644
"As you spray some perfume
and put dhoti on"

1904
02:09:55,727 --> 02:09:58,560
"The entire place goes crazy
while you walk"

1905
02:09:59,102 --> 02:10:03,019
"Deceiving my mascara eyes
with your mischief"

1906
02:10:03,144 --> 02:10:05,894
"Your risk factor is amazing"

1907
02:10:06,477 --> 02:10:11,769
"It’s amazing when
you show your collar off"

1908
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:13,727
"Your style is amazing"

1909
02:10:13,935 --> 02:10:17,810
"It’s amazing to watch your courage"

1910
02:10:17,935 --> 02:10:21,310
"My heart’s been shaken"

1911
02:10:40,144 --> 02:10:43,935
You got lucky, Savitri. The container
ended up in your hands

1912
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:52,477
Get down… Get down I say

1913
02:10:53,644 --> 02:10:54,935
I'm getting down.

1914
02:10:54,977 --> 02:10:56,227
Brother-in-law…
- Savitri.

1915
02:10:56,269 --> 02:10:57,394
I am coming to you.

1916
02:10:57,435 --> 02:11:00,060
I got our money from him.
- Our money?

1917
02:11:00,269 --> 02:11:02,269
Isn’t my brother-in-law’s money my money?
What do you say?

1918
02:11:02,352 --> 02:11:05,560
Savitri, you are really superb.
- I'm always superb.

1919
02:11:05,602 --> 02:11:07,852
Just hand shake or do I get
a share too? - Share?

1920
02:11:08,852 --> 02:11:11,019
I brought every single penny of it carefully.

1921
02:11:11,144 --> 02:11:12,977
My brother-in-law promised
to make an action film with me.

1922
02:11:13,144 --> 02:11:14,769
What do you say, brother?
Won’t you give me my share?

1923
02:11:14,935 --> 02:11:17,144
Your share, right? I will give it.

1924
02:11:17,269 --> 02:11:19,435
Brother-in-law, Ask him to fall at my feet
and apologize first

1925
02:11:19,519 --> 02:11:20,602
Sorry? Me?

1926
02:11:20,644 --> 02:11:23,310
Fatso! He said some really bad things
on the phone to me

1927
02:11:24,185 --> 02:11:25,144
Apologize.

1928
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:27,352
Sorry.
- Ok.

1929
02:11:27,519 --> 02:11:29,227
Go and open the door.

1930
02:11:33,185 --> 02:11:34,310
Where’s the money?

1931
02:11:35,894 --> 02:11:37,435
Brother-in-law...

1932
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:39,769
Bro, you wait. Come here.

1933
02:11:39,852 --> 02:11:41,519
Why? My God!

1934
02:11:43,852 --> 02:11:45,144
Bro, this looks like a remote.

1935
02:11:45,185 --> 02:11:48,144
Don’t press it. The bomb in my stomach
will blast

1936
02:11:48,227 --> 02:11:49,519
Bomb?
- Hey... hey...

1937
02:11:49,602 --> 02:11:51,394
Why would I put a time bomb
in your mouth, idiot?

1938
02:11:51,519 --> 02:11:52,560
It’s a motion tablet.

1939
02:11:53,685 --> 02:11:56,102
Motion tablet? So, isn’t any bomb
in my stomach?

1940
02:11:56,185 --> 02:11:57,935
My money is also not here.
- Brother-in-law.

1941
02:11:58,352 --> 02:11:59,394
He did it all.

1942
02:11:59,685 --> 02:12:01,394
I was right by him and
he didn’t give me a single penny.

1943
02:12:01,519 --> 02:12:03,644
Looks like he distributed
the money already

1944
02:12:03,727 --> 02:12:06,019
Where are the 50 billion rupees?

1945
02:12:06,935 --> 02:12:08,019
Ticket... ticket...

1946
02:12:08,352 --> 02:12:10,477
Bro, 5K was deposited in my account.

1947
02:12:10,602 --> 02:12:13,060
I don’t know who did it.
- It must be a fake message.

1948
02:12:14,644 --> 02:12:17,185
Even I got 5K transferred
through PayPal

1949
02:12:17,477 --> 02:12:20,769
I got 5K from Western Union. Super!

1950
02:12:20,935 --> 02:12:23,060
Someone deposited 5K on Money gram.

1951
02:12:23,185 --> 02:12:25,810
It isn’t unusual of Kohli to hit a six.

1952
02:12:26,185 --> 02:12:30,227
But someone transferring money is new.

1953
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:34,144
Son, have a look at this message.
I don’t get it.

1954
02:12:34,435 --> 02:12:36,060
Someone deposited 5K in your account.

1955
02:12:48,144 --> 02:12:49,685
My house owner warned
to throw my stuff out.

1956
02:12:49,727 --> 02:12:51,102
I will throw this money on his face.

1957
02:12:51,310 --> 02:12:52,644
My dad doesn’t even give me
pocket money.

1958
02:12:52,685 --> 02:12:54,560
But some stranger deposited 5K for me.

1959
02:13:03,602 --> 02:13:07,102
It is yet unknown who deposited
the money and why.

1960
02:13:07,227 --> 02:13:09,185
To enquire about the money transfer,

1961
02:13:09,227 --> 02:13:12,019
Enforcement Department has handed over
the case to CBI

1962
02:13:15,102 --> 02:13:16,935
Sir, Enforcement has handed over
the case to you.

1963
02:13:17,019 --> 02:13:18,477
How are you going to deal it?

1964
02:13:18,519 --> 02:13:20,519
Will you catch the money
depositors or not?

1965
02:13:21,310 --> 02:13:22,477
We will catch them.

1966
02:13:22,602 --> 02:13:24,769
We will find out who deposited
the money and why

1967
02:13:24,894 --> 02:13:27,477
If it's illegal money or anything...

1968
02:13:27,852 --> 02:13:29,227
We'll find it out in two hours.

1969
02:13:29,685 --> 02:13:30,477
Two hours.

1970
02:13:30,852 --> 02:13:32,477
Have they gone crazy?

1971
02:13:32,602 --> 02:13:34,602
Instead of catching the ones
robbing money,

1972
02:13:34,727 --> 02:13:36,935
They are after people distributing money

1973
02:13:37,102 --> 02:13:39,269
They can't find them.

1974
02:13:39,310 --> 02:13:39,935
Hello.

1975
02:13:40,685 --> 02:13:41,435
Tell me, Suresh.

1976
02:13:42,102 --> 02:13:42,769
Hello sir.

1977
02:13:43,102 --> 02:13:44,144
Sir. Like you said,

1978
02:13:44,519 --> 02:13:47,727
They have a warehouse in a private compound
behind the chemical factory.

1979
02:13:47,852 --> 02:13:49,185
No one is allowed there.

1980
02:13:49,602 --> 02:13:51,977
If you go, you might find
the formula.

1981
02:13:52,102 --> 02:13:54,310
Find out what’s happening inside.
But be careful.

1982
02:13:54,477 --> 02:13:55,102
Ok?

1983
02:13:55,227 --> 02:13:55,769
Ok sir.

1984
02:13:56,060 --> 02:13:56,769
Attention.

1985
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:58,602
Attention everybody.
- Good morning sir.

1986
02:13:59,227 --> 02:14:01,269
We got a call from Home Security.

1987
02:14:01,685 --> 02:14:05,685
5 million people all over India
were distributed 50 billion.

1988
02:14:05,769 --> 02:14:07,769
It has all been operated from our State.

1989
02:14:07,977 --> 02:14:10,019
How could they deposit money
to so many people?

1990
02:14:10,102 --> 02:14:11,060
Sasidhar.
- Sir.

1991
02:14:11,185 --> 02:14:13,519
I immediately need all the details.
- Ok sir.

1992
02:14:13,727 --> 02:14:16,227
The way we gather data
for marketing purposes

1993
02:14:16,269 --> 02:14:17,685
They must have done it in that way

1994
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:21,727
How could they do it
without any ID proof?

1995
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:25,019
They must have done it through
someone’s account.

1996
02:14:25,144 --> 02:14:26,894
Come on… Check it.
- Yes sir.

1997
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:31,352
2000 IDs have been used totally, sir.
- 2000 people?

1998
02:14:31,602 --> 02:14:34,227
Catch everyone. Don’t spare anyone.

1999
02:14:34,477 --> 02:14:35,477
Show me your ID.

2000
02:14:36,935 --> 02:14:37,685
Is it original?

2001
02:14:37,894 --> 02:14:39,935
If you get any information,
tell me immediately.

2002
02:14:40,227 --> 02:14:41,477
Sir, we can’t catch
a single one of them

2003
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:43,352
Why is that?
- All of them are dead.

2004
02:14:43,644 --> 02:14:44,394
How?

2005
02:14:44,685 --> 02:14:45,935
Due to cancer.

2006
02:14:46,185 --> 02:14:47,519
Ok.

2007
02:14:47,894 --> 02:14:51,644
This transfer was made using
the dead people’s IDs

2008
02:14:52,394 --> 02:14:53,727
But how is that possible?

2009
02:14:54,602 --> 02:14:55,560
Move.

2010
02:14:56,019 --> 02:14:58,394
Sir, he gave the voter list copy
of everyone in the city

2011
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:01,435
Sir, I would have done it for 1000 bucks.
They paid me 500k

2012
02:15:01,519 --> 02:15:02,102
Who?

2013
02:15:02,227 --> 02:15:03,269
I don’t know him, sir.

2014
02:15:03,352 --> 02:15:05,727
He called and deposited 500K
in my account and I mailed him the list

2015
02:15:05,852 --> 02:15:07,352
Which number did he call from?

2016
02:15:07,894 --> 02:15:08,935
This number sir.

2017
02:15:11,727 --> 02:15:12,935
Satellite phone.

2018
02:15:13,102 --> 02:15:13,935
Sashi.
- Sir?

2019
02:15:14,019 --> 02:15:15,894
- Go through it.
- Ok sir.

2020
02:15:20,519 --> 02:15:22,852
It’s hard, sir. This satellite number
is in the army network

2021
02:15:23,727 --> 02:15:24,685
Army?

2022
02:15:25,269 --> 02:15:26,477
Sashi.
- Sir.

2023
02:15:26,894 --> 02:15:28,477
Talk to the defense secretary

2024
02:15:28,602 --> 02:15:30,644
Take the permission immediately.
- Ok sir.

2025
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:31,519
Thank you.

2026
02:15:31,602 --> 02:15:33,144
Sir, Permission granted.

2027
02:15:34,977 --> 02:15:37,352
Sir, it shows the Rajahmundry area.

2028
02:15:46,019 --> 02:15:48,269
Book flight tickets to Rajahmundry.
- Sir.

2029
02:15:48,352 --> 02:15:50,227
Alert the local team.

2030
02:15:50,477 --> 02:15:53,310
Keep that phone under
continuous monitoring.

2031
02:15:54,019 --> 02:15:56,894
I will catch him today. Move.

2032
02:16:01,769 --> 02:16:03,727
Sir, the location is shown at Devi Mall.

2033
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:07,977
Suresh, found anything?

2034
02:16:08,102 --> 02:16:11,310
Sir, I came to repair the server
in that private compound.

2035
02:16:11,394 --> 02:16:12,394
Your doubt was correct, sir.

2036
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:14,935
Computerized illegal cigarette production
is happening here.

2037
02:16:16,852 --> 02:16:18,019
Through a main server

2038
02:16:18,144 --> 02:16:21,894
Cigarette filling, packing and production
is automatically taking place

2039
02:16:23,227 --> 02:16:25,269
The whole system has to be crashed
to stop the production

2040
02:16:25,352 --> 02:16:26,060
Yes sir.

2041
02:16:26,185 --> 02:16:28,560
But the firewall protection
is really strong here.

2042
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:30,685
Overriding is not possible, sir.

2043
02:16:30,935 --> 02:16:33,060
Share me your location.
I am coming right away.

2044
02:16:33,185 --> 02:16:33,935
Ok sir.

2045
02:16:39,144 --> 02:16:41,727
It shows 100 meters.
- Hello, sir. Come on…

2046
02:16:43,102 --> 02:16:44,685
Sanju... cops are here.

2047
02:16:50,727 --> 02:16:52,477
Sir, even the satellite signal is cut.

2048
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:53,810
Shit. He is smart.

2049
02:16:54,144 --> 02:16:57,019
He is somewhere around.
Round up every corner.

2050
02:16:57,185 --> 02:16:58,435
No one should go out.

2051
02:16:58,477 --> 02:17:00,102
Come on. Move...
- Move.

2052
02:17:04,144 --> 02:17:04,685
What?

2053
02:17:05,185 --> 02:17:06,394
Cops are in the mall.

2054
02:17:06,644 --> 02:17:08,144
What to do now?

2055
02:17:11,602 --> 02:17:13,435
Sir, your phone is ringing.

2056
02:17:18,644 --> 02:17:19,310
Hello.

2057
02:17:20,227 --> 02:17:22,352
Welcome to Rajahmundry.
- Who is this?

2058
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:23,769
Who are you?

2059
02:17:24,185 --> 02:17:25,560
The common man you are looking for.

2060
02:17:25,685 --> 02:17:29,477
I know you are not a common man
but an army man.

2061
02:17:30,102 --> 02:17:32,977
To destroy Indian economy.

2062
02:17:33,644 --> 02:17:36,560
I also know you joined hands with
foreign countries and distributed the money

2063
02:17:36,810 --> 02:17:38,935
How much is your commission in that?

2064
02:17:39,019 --> 02:17:40,144
Tell me...

2065
02:17:40,227 --> 02:17:42,935
43.5k given by government on India.

2066
02:17:43,144 --> 02:17:45,769
Not to destroy the nation
but to protect it.

2067
02:17:46,602 --> 02:17:49,269
Why don’t you tell us
if it’s such a good act?

2068
02:17:49,560 --> 02:17:51,435
Sorry, sir. Military secret.

2069
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:53,185
You know it can’t be leaked.

2070
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:56,310
Whatever it is, I will catch you.

2071
02:17:56,435 --> 02:17:57,644
Whom will you catch, sir?

2072
02:17:57,769 --> 02:18:00,644
The one passing by in the red shirt?

2073
02:18:01,185 --> 02:18:02,060
Catch him.

2074
02:18:02,102 --> 02:18:03,144
What happened, sir?

2075
02:18:03,269 --> 02:18:05,644
Or the self executive walking
out of the shop?

2076
02:18:07,102 --> 02:18:09,935
Your brain speed and training isn’t sufficient
to catch me.

2077
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:12,644
I will only surrender in 4 hours.

2078
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:14,310
Stop. stop.

2079
02:18:14,519 --> 02:18:18,227
If you don’t surrender right away,
I would have to use my weapons.

2080
02:18:18,352 --> 02:18:19,352
Understand?

2081
02:18:19,852 --> 02:18:21,685
What, sir? Encounter?

2082
02:18:22,269 --> 02:18:25,060
Will you use the guns
we use back on us?

2083
02:18:25,435 --> 02:18:27,269
You need permission to shoot.

2084
02:18:27,685 --> 02:18:30,310
I don’t even need it.

2085
02:18:31,685 --> 02:18:34,685
I'm challenging you to get out of this mall.

2086
02:18:34,935 --> 02:18:38,685
I have left that place long back.
See you soon.

2087
02:18:43,769 --> 02:18:45,727
He is playing with us.

2088
02:18:46,310 --> 02:18:48,185
What the hell is going on here?
- Excuse me.

2089
02:19:16,644 --> 02:19:18,477
You said the formula would come running
if we take the money

2090
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:20,894
Looks like we will be caught
before we find the formula.

2091
02:19:27,977 --> 02:19:29,810
Now we know the location of formula.

2092
02:19:30,519 --> 02:19:31,977
Send the second message.

2093
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:37,769
'India in youth’s hands...'

2094
02:19:38,227 --> 02:19:40,769
'To know why I sent you the money,'

2095
02:19:41,019 --> 02:19:43,394
'Open this video link at 10  in the night.'

2096
02:19:43,685 --> 02:19:45,185
He sent money to all of us.

2097
02:19:45,227 --> 02:19:47,019
Get a big screen for the entire
hostel to watch

2098
02:19:47,185 --> 02:19:48,519
India in youth’s hands…

2099
02:19:48,644 --> 02:19:50,352
What’s this video going to be?

2100
02:19:50,477 --> 02:19:52,519
Everyone is discussing the same.

2101
02:19:52,602 --> 02:19:55,602
Is that video going to shake India?

2102
02:19:55,644 --> 02:19:57,977
What do you say, sir?
- Nothing, dear.

2103
02:19:58,185 --> 02:20:00,102
It’s a publicity stunt for money.

2104
02:20:00,435 --> 02:20:02,602
It must be some dirty video.
- No.

2105
02:20:02,769 --> 02:20:05,685
He is definitely trying to send a message
to the youth

2106
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:07,935
Recharge for Internet on this phone.

2107
02:20:07,977 --> 02:20:11,060
Why do you need internet on phone?
- I want to see the person who sent me money.

2108
02:20:11,102 --> 02:20:13,477
It’s not possible on your phone.
I will show in mine. - Ok.

2109
02:20:13,519 --> 02:20:15,685
Excuse me, sir.
Phone from Home Secratray.

2110
02:20:18,727 --> 02:20:19,352
Tell me sir.

2111
02:20:19,435 --> 02:20:21,310
He sent a video link in another message.

2112
02:20:21,394 --> 02:20:23,227
We have to stop that
at any cost.

2113
02:20:23,310 --> 02:20:24,310
It’s hard, sir.

2114
02:20:24,519 --> 02:20:27,519
We can’t remove it unless
the link is activated

2115
02:20:27,602 --> 02:20:30,227
What if his message translates
before we stop it?

2116
02:20:30,394 --> 02:20:31,602
We can’t do anything, sir.

2117
02:20:31,977 --> 02:20:33,310
It will reach the public.

2118
02:20:33,394 --> 02:20:35,894
So, you want me to watch
the video too?

2119
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:37,435
You have to, sir.

2120
02:20:45,394 --> 02:20:46,185
Sruthi.

2121
02:20:46,852 --> 02:20:48,185
Will you help me?

2122
02:20:48,477 --> 02:20:49,269
What is it?

2123
02:20:50,310 --> 02:20:54,727
I will transmit live video
through this at 10pm.

2124
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:56,894
You should upload the link.

2125
02:20:57,352 --> 02:21:00,310
No matter what happens inside,
the video shouldn’t stop.

2126
02:21:00,810 --> 02:21:02,394
It must reach the public.

2127
02:21:02,810 --> 02:21:04,185
Will you do that for me?

2128
02:21:04,477 --> 02:21:05,352
Promise me.

2129
02:21:10,644 --> 02:21:11,394
Thank you.

2130
02:21:11,935 --> 02:21:12,727
Sanjeev.

2131
02:21:12,977 --> 02:21:15,144
I was string when you
were beside me

2132
02:21:15,894 --> 02:21:17,935
I am scared that you are leaving.

2133
02:21:18,894 --> 02:21:21,185
Back then, I was strong
that you would come.

2134
02:21:21,394 --> 02:21:24,394
Now, I am scared that you are leaving.

2135
02:21:29,435 --> 02:21:32,060
I have many friends like them
in military too.

2136
02:21:32,394 --> 02:21:36,269
A bullet suddenly hits you in the war.
One of us dies right in front.

2137
02:21:36,435 --> 02:21:40,894
That second, I am happy that I am saved
but not that I will live forever.

2138
02:21:42,602 --> 02:21:45,644
I know the next bullet is for me.
I know I will die.

2139
02:21:45,935 --> 02:21:48,310
But the reason for dying
is important.

2140
02:21:50,977 --> 02:21:51,685
Bye.

2141
02:22:03,185 --> 02:22:04,227
Sruthi.

2142
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:06,227
Tell me, Sanjeev.
- Connect me to Suresh.

2143
02:22:06,269 --> 02:22:06,977
Ok.

2144
02:22:09,227 --> 02:22:10,644
Suresh.
- Tell me sir.

2145
02:22:10,810 --> 02:22:12,310
I am at the north phase compound.

2146
02:22:12,477 --> 02:22:13,394
One second sir.

2147
02:22:15,185 --> 02:22:17,269
I'm switching off the power for 3 minutes.
You can come in, sir

2148
02:22:17,352 --> 02:22:17,935
Ok.

2149
02:22:34,977 --> 02:22:36,352
Suresh, We are in.

2150
02:22:36,894 --> 02:22:39,352
I fixed all the cameras
like you said.

2151
02:22:39,435 --> 02:22:41,935
They will switch on right at 10pm.
- Ok good.

2152
02:22:54,394 --> 02:22:55,019
Hello.

2153
02:22:55,185 --> 02:22:56,352
Ya Amith.
- All set.

2154
02:22:56,477 --> 02:22:57,977
Ready to go.
- OK, Carry on.

2155
02:23:05,310 --> 02:23:06,102
Suresh.

2156
02:23:06,685 --> 02:23:07,352
Suresh.

2157
02:23:07,477 --> 02:23:08,352
Come on the line.

2158
02:23:08,644 --> 02:23:09,852
Suresh, where are you?

2159
02:23:10,102 --> 02:23:10,852
Suresh.

2160
02:23:12,394 --> 02:23:13,144
Suresh.

2161
02:23:16,852 --> 02:23:17,685
Suresh.

2162
02:23:18,019 --> 02:23:18,852
Suresh.

2163
02:23:19,060 --> 02:23:19,810
Suresh.

2164
02:23:19,935 --> 02:23:20,977
What happened, Sanjeev?

2165
02:23:21,144 --> 02:23:21,810
Suresh.

2166
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:24,935
Suresh.
- Suresh.

2167
02:23:28,852 --> 02:23:29,602
Satya.

2168
02:23:29,977 --> 02:23:30,727
Satya.

2169
02:23:31,477 --> 02:23:32,060
Satya.

2170
02:23:32,602 --> 02:23:33,269
Satya.

2171
02:23:34,935 --> 02:23:35,644
Hey.

2172
02:23:36,227 --> 02:23:38,394
Do you think only you can kill?

2173
02:23:38,769 --> 02:23:41,519
You messed with us
by killing our people.

2174
02:23:42,019 --> 02:23:44,060
Shouldn’t we repay you?

2175
02:23:56,519 --> 02:23:57,894
Jai Hind.

2176
02:24:52,144 --> 02:24:53,310
Amit.

2177
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:56,602
Amit.

2178
02:24:57,852 --> 02:24:58,810
Amit.

2179
02:25:02,894 --> 02:25:04,352
Jai Hind.

2180
02:25:05,060 --> 02:25:06,310
Amit.

2181
02:25:51,269 --> 02:25:53,852
How many people will you kill?
How many?

2182
02:25:56,769 --> 02:26:01,227
You show off as big shots but is this tainted
cigarettes business what you do?

2183
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:07,769
Court has banned it but you have released
a new brand with the same formula.

2184
02:26:08,435 --> 02:26:09,727
Tell me... where is the formula?

2185
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:17,144
Tell me where the formula is.
Tell me…

2186
02:26:17,394 --> 02:26:18,435
Tell me.

2187
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:19,852
Tell me where the formula is.

2188
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,352
Sanjeev.

2189
02:26:30,519 --> 02:26:31,477
Father.

2190
02:26:45,060 --> 02:26:46,602
Let's move. Move.

2191
02:26:50,144 --> 02:26:51,644
What are you staring at?

2192
02:26:56,310 --> 02:26:58,602
This is my original get up.

2193
02:26:58,769 --> 02:27:00,935
This is my original profession.

2194
02:27:01,227 --> 02:27:05,810
When everyone in your house is a rogue,
I can’t expect you to be good.

2195
02:27:07,477 --> 02:27:12,519
But your daughter thinks
you are really great.

2196
02:27:13,310 --> 02:27:14,810
What makes me a rogue?

2197
02:27:15,352 --> 02:27:17,102
I'm a successful businessman.

2198
02:27:17,602 --> 02:27:20,060
Have I pleaded people to smoke cigarette?

2199
02:27:21,144 --> 02:27:23,352
They are smoking and dying.

2200
02:27:24,102 --> 02:27:25,394
What do you want me to do?

2201
02:27:25,727 --> 02:27:28,352
Every business has a strategy.

2202
02:27:28,769 --> 02:27:33,727
Every product is publicized
to the extremes to attract audience.

2203
02:27:33,852 --> 02:27:35,019
I didn’t even do that.

2204
02:27:35,185 --> 02:27:37,019
These people follow the herd.

2205
02:27:37,727 --> 02:27:41,644
Their hope to enjoy life is more
than their hope to live.

2206
02:27:41,894 --> 02:27:45,685
They are spoiling their life
to get high for a minute.

2207
02:27:47,852 --> 02:27:50,435
I'm making cash from it.
Is it wrong?

2208
02:27:50,644 --> 02:27:52,602
There’s nothing wrong
in doing business.

2209
02:27:53,852 --> 02:27:55,644
But for your earnings,

2210
02:27:55,769 --> 02:28:02,269
you have mixed a formula in
your tainted cigarettes to make them addicts.

2211
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:03,935
That’s wrong.

2212
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:09,769
That’s resulting in cancer
and killing many innocents like my brother

2213
02:28:10,019 --> 02:28:11,477
Personal revenge, huh?

2214
02:28:11,810 --> 02:28:13,810
I thought you are serving the public.

2215
02:28:14,019 --> 02:28:15,560
You want the formula, right?

2216
02:28:15,935 --> 02:28:17,144
It isn’t someplace else.

2217
02:28:18,102 --> 02:28:19,977
It’s right here.

2218
02:28:21,477 --> 02:28:23,644
Even if the entire factory is on fire,

2219
02:28:24,060 --> 02:28:28,227
I'll make a cigar with the same combination
and introduce in the market again.

2220
02:28:28,644 --> 02:28:31,935
People would come running for it.

2221
02:28:32,227 --> 02:28:34,894
I would have killed you long back.

2222
02:28:35,685 --> 02:28:37,852
But if I kill you, there will be another.

2223
02:28:38,185 --> 02:28:39,685
If he dies and another.

2224
02:28:40,227 --> 02:28:42,227
I shouldn’t just kill you people

2225
02:28:43,019 --> 02:28:44,769
But people’s weakness too.

2226
02:28:46,769 --> 02:28:47,894
That's why...

2227
02:28:49,894 --> 02:28:51,227
I've waited this long

2228
02:28:51,435 --> 02:28:52,685
You saw it, right?

2229
02:28:53,019 --> 02:28:54,310
His real character.

2230
02:28:56,269 --> 02:28:57,894
Change at least now.

2231
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:02,810
We are dying at the border
for you people

2232
02:29:05,102 --> 02:29:06,852
Our sacrifice has a meaning.

2233
02:29:07,894 --> 02:29:09,519
Your death doesn’t have a meaning.

2234
02:29:09,935 --> 02:29:13,144
Many of you are useful for the country.

2235
02:29:13,602 --> 02:29:15,227
But you are just looking
for that high.

2236
02:29:15,852 --> 02:29:17,977
You guys are dying
for one minute kick

2237
02:29:20,310 --> 02:29:22,435
Please come out of it.

2238
02:29:22,685 --> 02:29:25,935
If you don’t want to change,
come to the border with me

2239
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,185
Let’s die together.

2240
02:29:27,644 --> 02:29:29,977
Your death will have a meaning then.

2241
02:29:31,185 --> 02:29:33,352
Who are you talking to?

2242
02:29:33,685 --> 02:29:36,144
You have told the people
everything yourself.

2243
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:38,144
You told the people.

2244
02:29:41,644 --> 02:29:43,769
But your mistake here is...

2245
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:46,394
Said the formula was in your head.

2246
02:29:48,394 --> 02:29:49,435
Mom

2247
02:29:49,852 --> 02:29:51,019
Ok?

2248
02:29:52,977 --> 02:29:55,019
Dad, ok?

2249
02:29:59,685 --> 02:30:00,352
Hey!

2250
02:30:01,435 --> 02:30:03,102
Are you ready?

2251
02:30:32,144 --> 02:30:33,852
Jai Hind

2252
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:36,769
Ok sir.

2253
02:31:37,310 --> 02:31:39,560
Sir, Police Commissioner’s call
from Vizag

2254
02:31:39,644 --> 02:31:41,269
Sanjeev’s dead body wasn’t found
at the spot

2255
02:31:41,477 --> 02:31:42,227
You will not find it.

2256
02:31:42,394 --> 02:31:44,894
Search team assures to find it
within 24 hours

2257
02:31:44,935 --> 02:31:49,185
Even 24 years wouldn’t be enough.

2258
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:52,352
We are all working for the paycheck.

2259
02:31:52,519 --> 02:31:54,977
But he is working for the country.

2260
02:31:55,102 --> 02:31:56,727
And, disconnect the phone.

2261
02:31:56,894 --> 02:31:59,060
Look for another case.
Ok sir.

2262
02:32:04,894 --> 02:32:05,602
Hello.

2263
02:32:06,310 --> 02:32:08,685
I didn’t expect a call from a dead man.

2264
02:32:09,435 --> 02:32:11,977
According to the records, you are dead.

2265
02:32:12,769 --> 02:32:16,394
But this nation needs your service.

2266
02:32:16,935 --> 02:32:20,060
A person like you should live.
Any time… Any day… Call me…

2267
02:32:21,144 --> 02:32:22,477
This Indian is there for you.

2268
02:32:22,685 --> 02:32:23,602
Thank you, sir.

2269
02:32:24,227 --> 02:32:25,852
There is a lot more I have to do.

2270
02:32:26,644 --> 02:32:28,602
Every step of mine is for my nation.
