It's a pressure cooker!

00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,647
One minute

109
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,780

Five minute if my eyes is out
of you... then you out!

114
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,614
And do not return ever again!

115

I'm trying that from a long time

119
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,480
Liar

120
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,314
Aliyah

121
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:12,447
Welcome to the great Indian circus
Aliyah!

122
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:17,314
You are fired!

123
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,380
Chicago police thinks the thief
is Asian!

124
00:46:54,234 --> 00:46:56,234
Mr, Dixit what have you got to say
about the thief!

125
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,347
In, few days two robberies

126
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,180
I don't think he is a true thief

127
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:17,314
No, thief leaves so much of evidence!

128
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,180
He likes to run

129
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:27,314
My advice to him
Escape from this city!

130
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,320
Do you think he will loot again!
If he has the courage

131
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:36,314
People are afraid

132
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,147
I don't think we must fear
this thief!

133
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,280
He is a clown

134
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,147
When I get him
He will entertain in jail

135
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,780
Do you think you can get him
Destiny is always in police hands!

136
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,147
This clown is in my hand

137
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:23,247

Mr. Dixit

138
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,080

139
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:44,247
Sahir Khan

140
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,080
Want to tell you something!

141
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,214
I am the thief!

142
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,080
<i>No one knows about it...
now you</i>

143
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,214
I did 0t understand!

144
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:13,047
The great Indian circus
Is the name of my show!

145
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:16,314
The thief you are I search for
I have a trick for him

146
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:19,047
Which I'll be showing at my show!

147
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,180
2005 circus fantastic

148
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:39,047
That is me
And behind is the thief!

149
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,180
We are only clowns at a circus

150
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:48,014
And he is a magician!

151
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,180
He had no enemies
And he won't speak to anyone!

152
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,013
After the show he is disappeared
In his room!

153
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,180
He is know as Charlie

154
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:17,014
I want to take my magic else were!

155
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:21,147
Robert... sir did not like the idea!

156
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,980
I heard him speak for the first time

157
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:32,147
What ever he said
I still remember the words

158
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,980
What?

159
00:50:41,134 --> 00:50:43,114
An saying must not hurt your enemy

160
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,947
How do you know Charlie
is behind the robbery?

161
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,334
Read in the newspaper
That he leaves his joker evidence!

162
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:02,947
How may circus clowns are there?

163
00:51:05,134 --> 00:51:07,114
<i>Why the bank?</i>

164
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,947
If I show you suspects will

165
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,080
He is always I clown uniform

166
00:51:20,967 --> 00:51:22,947

his face!

168
00:51:33,934 --> 00:51:35,914
We both are circus clowns

169
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,261
Difference is, I am on the stage
And he is in the open.

170
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:45,913
Charlie is a genius.

171
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:52,047
I can think like him

172
00:51:53,933 --> 00:51:55,913
Why do you want to help me

173
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:04,047
I want him to be caught

174
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,880
He is not a thief

175
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:23,013
This is the last hope
to get him

176
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,880
No robbery or thief will exist

177
00:52:35,034 --> 00:52:37,014
Sahir, what every one doing

00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,847

182
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:07,914
To become a clown its serious

183
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,767
Everything that I do
Must be with honour and pride!

184
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,880
My work is not a joke
It's a battle

185
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,680
Victory must be like the audience is wining

186
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:31,847
But I am always the winner!

187
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,500
He comes from one place and return
from another... How is it possible?

188
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:45,814
If I was Charlie the loot
will be happening today

189
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,680
Why?
What is it today?

190
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,813
1st April
Clown's day

191
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:56,747
Today is my first show
my mobile will be switched off

192
01:07:36,134 --> 01:07:38,114
Brother he disappear like a wind

193
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,947
How fast he escape
I'm a fan of him!

194
01:07:41,133 --> 01:07:43,113
Come
Were too

195
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:47,947
Were he can't run
The Great Indian Circus.

196
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:07,547
You are quite brave to act strong

197
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,380
What is this Jai?
Quite Charlie!

198
01:17:13,534 --> 01:17:15,514
Mysterious clown
Whom no one knows his identity

199
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,380
Your story was very good

200
01:17:22,534 --> 01:17:25,374
My job is to complete the mission
But I have to concentrate on the story

201
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,380
I must trust those who is in front
of me!

202
01:17:33,534 --> 01:17:35,514
You had a very good idea

203
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:38,347
Enter the bank and know all
the security codes

204
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:44,514
Only then I knew about the codes

205
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:49,347
Two police officers and the other thief

206
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,480
Me... remove your clothes

207
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:58,347
What?

208
01:18:02,501 --> 01:18:04,481
A 9mm of bullet
Leaves a clue behind

209
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:10,314
Jai you are mistaken

210
01:18:35,467 --> 01:18:37,447
Brother, there is no evidence

211
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,280
It's clean

212
01:18:46,467 --> 01:18:48,447
Officer body scaer

213
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,620
Jai how, is it possible for a bullet
to be clean on my body

214
01:19:11,434 --> 01:19:13,414
I'm a circus clown
tricks is always within me!

215
01:19:14,267 --> 01:19:16,247
I had shot you with my own hand

216
01:19:17,434 --> 01:19:19,414
I olny wanted to be friends with you

217
01:19:23,267 --> 01:19:25,247
Thief and a police are enemies

218
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,380
Brother, we need to go

219
01:19:40,267 --> 01:19:42,247
I feel pity for myself
That the bullet was not shot on your head

220
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,380
Next time I won't let that mistake happen

221
01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:55,214
How did you do this?

222
01:19:58,401 --> 01:20:00,381
Sorry we are not friends

223
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:06,214
If we were
I should have told you

224
01:22:00,267 --> 01:22:02,247
Is the pain to much

225
01:23:00,067 --> 01:23:02,047
<i>You wont find anything</i>

226
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,180
Take this and go
Let it go

227
01:23:28,034 --> 01:23:30,014
Do not try and act smart

228
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:44,147
We are gods grace

229
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:50,981
We must have faith

230
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:34,081
Papa has two

231
01:24:36,967 --> 01:24:38,947
One is intelligent
And the other is weak

232
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:44,081
I was the secret for papa

233
01:24:51,934 --> 01:24:53,914
That day papa had one more secret

234
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,080
No one knew about me

235
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:06,914
You said I am the secret

236
01:25:10,067 --> 01:25:12,047
No, one must come to know about me

237
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,880
Papa I was inside the boxes
I had no fear

238
01:25:33,034 --> 01:25:35,014
Who is going to stand on your back

239
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,880
Who is going to tell you
Your beard is white

240
01:25:43,034 --> 01:25:45,014
Everything I notice

241
01:25:48,867 --> 01:25:50,847
That is why, I hide you

242
01:25:51,034 --> 01:25:53,014
You are my secret

243
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,847
Only carry him
He is grown up... he is not a child

244
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,980
I am papa's angel
Angel don't walk on the ground

245
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:42,814
Say thank you

246
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:48,947
Samar, don't let go

247
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:53,814
Don't ever leave Sahil's hand

248
01:26:53,967 --> 01:26:55,947
Not ever

249
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,780
<i>No one can fight the bank</i>

250
01:27:15,934 --> 01:27:17,914
Bank is like a rock

251
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,780
<i>That day we knew we drop the bank</i>

252
01:27:31,934 --> 01:27:33,914
Its the bank or we survive

253
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,680
Papa always said, "I'm his angel"

254
01:28:51,834 --> 01:28:53,814
I have magic in my hand

255
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:00,681
This is my blood

256
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:16,647
The passage is very narrow

257
01:30:13,767 --> 01:30:15,747
Its a secret

258
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:38,714
Sahir don't even know my secret

259
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,580
My secret is...

260
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,714
Aliyah

261
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:56,547
There is no good man for her
In this entire world

262
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:01,714
She is the best

263
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:06,547
Her name is very cute

264
01:32:05,534 --> 01:32:06,512
[ Skipped item nr. 257 ]

265
01:32:14,634 --> 01:32:16,614
When she is not close to me
I feel happy

266
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:22,481
Her name is cute

267
01:32:23,634 --> 01:32:25,614
I feel good to think for her

268
01:32:31,467 --> 01:32:33,447
Goodnight, Aliyah

269
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,580
Where are we going?

270
01:33:17,434 --> 01:33:19,414
Going back home.

271
01:33:22,567 --> 01:33:24,848
Remain quite and come with me
on the train to the airport.

272
01:34:51,334 --> 01:34:53,314
Cancel our trip?

273
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:58,481
Lets begin with our operation

274
01:35:08,334 --> 01:35:10,654
We are not in our home town
But we are international police

275
01:35:18,467 --> 01:35:20,467
We came with respect
And we shall go creating chaos

276
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,280
Brother we stayed behind

277
01:35:28,467 --> 01:35:30,447
Do you remember his circus trick

278
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,280
The way he loots
We need to understand

279
01:35:46,434 --> 01:35:48,414
You tell me, What can I do?

280
01:35:55,267 --> 01:35:57,247
Our answers are hidden behind

281
01:35:59,434 --> 01:36:01,414
Sahir is hiding something

282
01:36:04,267 --> 01:36:06,247
Playing the game is fun for me

283
01:42:14,034 --> 01:42:16,014
Why did you wear my costume?

284
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:18,881
I did not have time
What is the difference?

285
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:40,847
Your costume stinks

286
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,980
Don't try and act smart

287
01:43:07,834 --> 01:43:09,814
Why can't I be smart?

288
01:43:25,967 --> 01:43:27,947
Tomorrow is sunday

289
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,780
Why are you so stubborn

290
01:43:45,967 --> 01:43:47,947
Hello, you must send the boxes

291
01:43:50,801 --> 01:43:52,781
Now days you forget a lot

292
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:02,914
Twins!
One brother Goli and the other Boli

293
01:44:09,767 --> 01:44:11,747
One brother is weaker

294
01:44:15,934 --> 01:44:17,914
I'll take care off him
You concentrate on Sahir

295
01:44:23,767 --> 01:44:25,747
The case is much easier
like a waterfall

296
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:28,881
Now we know their secret

297
01:44:35,767 --> 01:44:37,747
Have you not seen
They are twins

298
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,880
Being twins is not a crime

299
01:44:48,734 --> 01:44:50,714
How will we get them

300
01:44:53,901 --> 01:44:55,981
Sahir's strenght is his brother
And his weakness too.

301
01:45:01,734 --> 01:45:03,714
Tell me directly,
What should I do?

302
01:45:43,834 --> 01:45:45,814
Sunday, 14th may
Sahir always tell me a hip hop

303
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:54,647
A day I want to be Samar

304
01:46:01,834 --> 01:46:03,814
Cause I go alone
He is afraid for me

305
01:46:07,667 --> 01:46:09,647
I have no problem
I can take care of myself

306
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,780
I have a lot of fun

307
01:46:18,667 --> 01:46:20,647
I live in a box
Only Sunday I feel the fresh air

308
01:46:23,801 --> 01:46:25,781
My nose is funny... when its cold

309
01:46:27,634 --> 01:46:29,614
Writing my name is fun

310
01:46:33,801 --> 01:46:35,781
Only my name!

311
01:46:39,634 --> 01:46:41,614
For two minutes I'll let out my secret

312
01:47:25,734 --> 01:47:27,714
Thief thief
Hey you stop!

313
01:48:21,534 --> 01:48:23,514
Stealing is very bad!

314
01:48:30,667 --> 01:48:32,647
I am not a thief

315
01:48:36,501 --> 01:48:38,481
Did not eat for 5 days

316
01:48:42,667 --> 01:48:44,647
Happy burger
Who eats burger to be happy

317
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,480
Do you know who is the biggest thief

318
01:49:09,634 --> 01:49:11,614
Everyone is a thief within

319
01:49:15,467 --> 01:49:17,447
What do you like

320
01:49:22,634 --> 01:49:24,614
Fun

321
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,380
Where are you going?

322
01:50:28,567 --> 01:50:30,547
I only come on Sundays

323
01:50:36,401 --> 01:50:38,381
Can we meet the next Sunday?

324
01:50:42,534 --> 01:50:44,514
My circus

325
01:50:50,367 --> 01:50:52,347
I did not make any friend

326
01:51:11,501 --> 01:51:13,481
Papa I always think I can
not be a friend

327
01:51:23,334 --> 01:51:25,314
If, I tell Sahir he won't like the idea

328
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,480
Were do he have the time

329
01:51:36,334 --> 01:51:38,314
I have two secrets
Aliyah and a friend

330
01:51:56,467 --> 01:51:58,447
Victoria this is call brats

331
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:12,281
Do you know Karim Bhai?

332
01:52:15,434 --> 01:52:17,414
You need to research

333
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:26,280
Ali you are here to find the thief

334
01:52:50,401 --> 01:52:52,381
Think about work
Not Kamasutra

335
01:53:17,234 --> 01:53:19,214
Mr. Iqbal Khan
How are you?

336
01:54:20,334 --> 01:54:22,314
Until I have this $25 on me

337
01:54:25,167 --> 01:54:27,147
<i>No, bank can't shut us down</i>

338
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:34,280
Papa this is the last bank

339
01:54:39,167 --> 01:54:41,147
This bank will be finish very soon

340
01:55:31,234 --> 01:55:33,214
Yes I found a job

341
01:55:35,101 --> 01:55:37,081
I will buy you a burger

342
01:55:49,234 --> 01:55:51,214
I did not see Aliyah
"The Wonder Girl"

343
01:55:57,067 --> 01:55:59,047
Aliyah is not my girlfriend

344
01:56:01,234 --> 01:56:03,214
Why?

345
01:56:12,067 --> 01:56:14,308
The way you both react,
Its like girlfriend ad boyfriend.

346
01:56:18,201 --> 01:56:20,181
Why don't you kiss her
Hey, She is not that of type girl.

347
01:57:03,001 --> 01:57:04,981
I love her.

348
01:57:10,134 --> 01:57:12,114
I told you.

349
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,980
But she is not my girlfriend.

350
01:57:19,134 --> 01:57:21,114
She don't even know, I like her

351
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,980
What coincidence
This can't be

352
01:57:33,134 --> 01:57:35,114
When she is near you
Its like you are lover

353
01:57:47,967 --> 01:57:49,947
When she looks at you
Its like she is with Sahir

354
01:58:01,101 --> 01:58:03,081
When Aliyah looks at Sahir

355
01:58:51,901 --> 01:58:53,881
Todays performance
I will act

356
01:58:56,034 --> 01:58:58,014
You take my place
And I will take your place!

357
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,880
What!
Are you crazy?

358
01:59:17,034 --> 01:59:19,014
No, I want to perform

359
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,780
You are crazy boss

360
02:00:52,934 --> 02:00:54,914
Should I do the thinking

361
02:00:55,767 --> 02:00:57,747
You had overreacted today

362
02:01:00,934 --> 02:01:02,914
Something happened today?

363
02:01:05,767 --> 02:01:07,747
A lot happened in a big way.

364
02:01:08,901 --> 02:01:10,881
Something electric... between us

365
02:01:15,767 --> 02:01:17,747

We are this much from our plan

379
02:03:31,634 --> 02:03:33,614
<i>We have to succeed
And the bank needs to close</i>

380
02:03:34,767 --> 02:03:36,747

Nice trick to win a girl

02:11:47,134 --> 02:11:49,114
If you were not around nothing
should happen to me

418
02:11:54,267 --> 02:11:56,247
Do you consider me as your pal

419
02:11:59,101 --> 02:12:01,081
I will tell you a secret

420
02:12:29,234 --> 02:12:31,214
Remember we are friends

421
02:12:38,067 --> 02:12:40,047
Don't be afraid
This was a lie

422
02:12:40,234 --> 02:12:42,214
Friendship was true

423
02:12:45,067 --> 02:12:47,047
Friends don't speak a lie

424
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:51,180
You lied to me

425
02:12:54,067 --> 02:12:56,047
The bank of Chicargo
They have been punished

426
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:02,180
The bank is not shut down
And papa is not alive

427
02:13:08,034 --> 02:13:10,014
This should come to a end

428
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:17,180
I know you and Sahir are brothers

429
02:13:22,034 --> 02:13:24,014
The Great Indian Circus
You are the secret!

430
02:13:39,167 --> 02:13:41,147
Samar you need to help me

431
02:13:44,001 --> 02:13:45,981
Come with me and give a statement
to the police

432
02:13:49,134 --> 02:13:51,114
I will try and plead with the case

433
02:14:05,967 --> 02:14:07,947
You are the one can save Sahir

434
02:14:14,134 --> 02:14:16,114
Save Aliyah's love

435
02:15:01,934 --> 02:15:03,914
Sahir the wizard

436
02:15:08,067 --> 02:15:10,047
<i>I am a clown
We cheat death</i>

437
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:14,880
I like your trick

438
02:15:20,068 --> 02:15:22,048
Observe and cheat

439
02:15:25,901 --> 02:15:27,881
When the three meet its magic

440
02:17:31,934 --> 02:17:33,914
Whatever you done to Samar
It was not right at all

441
02:17:36,767 --> 02:17:38,747
You played with his emotions

442
02:17:56,901 --> 02:17:58,881
I should have stayed to see you dead

443
02:18:00,734 --> 02:18:02,714
Its my last bank loot

444
02:19:00,834 --> 02:19:02,814
Our last and dangerous loot

445
02:19:11,667 --> 02:19:13,647
This is going to be a storm

446
02:19:25,801 --> 02:19:27,781
We are going to shut down the bank

447
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:51,080
The first time I caught a thief
during the night

448
02:28:57,233 --> 02:28:59,213
If I was not a police
Surely should write a poem

449
02:29:56,034 --> 02:29:58,014
Brother, let them go
We can't get them

450
02:30:04,167 --> 02:30:06,928
At night its always victory for a thief
And when the sunlight its mine

451
02:30:08,033 --> 02:30:10,013
I have a plan

452
02:30:53,134 --> 02:30:55,114
Samar

453
02:32:52,867 --> 02:32:54,847
Jai, I'm very tired of runing

454
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,980
And there is no place to run

455
02:32:59,834 --> 02:33:01,874
I am arrested... but the court
Can't prove me guilty

456
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,980
This is all the evidence

457
02:33:15,834 --> 02:33:17,814
This is all my crime
Let Samar go

458
02:33:19,967 --> 02:33:21,947
Both of you must be punish

459
02:33:24,834 --> 02:33:26,814
Not Samar.
I was the Mastermind

460
02:33:26,967 --> 02:33:28,947
All the planing was mine

461
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:35,780
Samar is innocent

462
02:33:35,967 --> 02:33:37,947
Let him go

463
02:33:55,801 --> 02:33:57,781
Its a deal
You promise

464
02:34:35,901 --> 02:34:37,881

02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:49,880
You are not weak
You are Samar

467
02:35:00,733 --> 02:35:02,713

Papa said I can't let go your hand

471
02:35:56,667 --> 02:35:58,647
We are gods grace

472
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:27,780
Our destiny is decide by god

473
02:38:05,534 --> 02:38:07,514
The last day of Chicargo bank
remains open

474
02:38:25,667 --> 02:38:27,647
<i>Last day for western bank</i>

475
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:36,480
There are some rules to be broken

476
02:38:45,667 --> 02:38:47,647
Victory only meet for one

477
02:38:56,501 --> 02:38:58,481
