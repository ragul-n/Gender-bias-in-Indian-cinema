1
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,724
We have heard people being
greedy about women, gold and land.

2
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:23,290
There's a new greediness that has started

3
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:26,748
and that's to be popular.

4
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,364
Every man wants to be in news.

5
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:39,297
In this bad era,
it is the bad that triumphs.

6
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:41,935
He promotes only bad things.

7
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:46,268
It is very difficult to promote good.

8
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:50,462
From 1994 till 2000

9
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:54,018
I had killed eight
criminals in encounters.

10
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:59,595
In that list, Baby Krishna

11
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,610
and the present gangster Uncle

12
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,902
both got away.

13
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:08,696
They are living a fearless life.

14
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,792
They should fear the police.

15
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:18,185
They should fear of
being killed in encounter.

16
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,406
By diving the area

17
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,465
they are doing hooliganism fearlessly.

18
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:28,788
Nobody is fighting
to attain don's position.

19
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:32,280
They should be finished.

20
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,912
We must develop fear in them

21
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:40,479
but rowdies have done that.

22
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:49,725
Check if he is breathing.

23
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:51,865
If he is alive, then kill him.
- Okay.

24
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,886
He is dead.

25
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,203
Chitte, give me the lighter.

26
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:02,400
If our case doesn't become
news then it's futile.

27
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:07,697
Dolly. How many more bottles
do you want to drink to become Don Dolly?

28
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:10,485
I can't become a gangster
till Uncle is alive.

29
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:31,152
Remind him that we have killed so many
people who have not answered his call.

30
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:37,106
The media and my party wish
that I become the chief minister

31
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:40,565
but the opposition party doesn't
want me to become one, hence I am worried.

32
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,656
You become the chief minister,
I have no objection

33
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:46,250
but don't forget your people.

34
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:51,470
Let me tell you one more thing. The blood
stain on your white shirt may have gone

35
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:54,972
but the wound on your body is still there.

36
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:57,167
I am not stopping you from coming

37
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:00,625
don't come and wait,
let's meet somewhere else.

38
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:05,942
The minister who insulted you
will be at your feet in four days.

39
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,541
He will call you to seek your help.

40
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:32,705
Your job is done, take a look.

41
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:40,033
I have no patience to wait
until he takes off his clothes.

42
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,805
Wow! Wonderful!

43
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,696
You are with three men.

44
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:51,112
That's right.
It's because he is a minister.

45
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:58,667
They are womanisers.
One of them said that he would marry me.

46
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:01,142
Just stop it.

47
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:05,735
"There's no news"

48
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,664
"about my beloved."

49
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:11,466
Stop it.

50
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:14,404
Let go.

51
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,533
What's the plan?

52
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:21,258
Let's call the minister and his son

53
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:23,127
and forward the video to them.

54
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,505
The minister will get scared

55
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:30,369
and call the underworld don Uncle.

56
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:33,082
I know who has trapped you.

57
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:36,278
I also know by doing what
they will hand over the video.

58
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:37,503
I am not worried about that.

59
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,989
Because of their doings

60
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,860
if the media gets the video,
they will telecast it.

61
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,237
Sir, are you trying to seek suggestions?

62
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,937
It is futile.
When will you give me the money?

63
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:56,148
Please give me time
till tomorrow afternoon.

64
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,862
I am with you, don't worry.

65
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:06,147
We can't hire you
as soon as you're interviewed.

66
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,757
What were you doing for all this while?

67
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:10,686
Sir, we were doing diploma.
- Did you complete it?

68
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,577
No sir, I discontinued studies.

69
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:14,502
It is hooliganism to discontinue?

70
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,728
Who inspired you to become a goon?

71
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,630
You, sir.

72
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:22,283
Only take him as
an inspiration and nothing else.

73
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:24,153
You will be ruined.

74
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:31,255
Have you told him about us?

75
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,064
Yes, boss.
- We're dangerous people.

76
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:37,448
There's no guru here,
you have to learn things by yourself.

77
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,285
Okay, sir.
- We have a guru.

78
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,490
He is a coward. He is aimless.

79
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,079
All he did is grew beard. It's been
nine years since he committed murder.

80
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:50,267
If he continues to be like that,
somebody would kill him easily.

81
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,595
He had killed Tui long ago.

82
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:59,377
He is throwing his weight
by telling people about it.

83
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,782
Where is the video?

84
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:39,315
Because the minister insulted me
you filmed his son's video, right?

85
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,677
Why did you demand for ransom?

86
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,054
He will give ransom because he is rich.
- Don't I mean anything?

87
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,075
I have promised the minister.

88
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,775
I won't give the video.

89
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:58,975
Look Subbi, I supported you.
- You're wrong.

90
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,326
It was our own effort,
nobody supported us.

91
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:08,151
We do the job

92
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,804
and you take the credit.

93
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:15,879
You become infamous because of us.

94
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,755
I have promised the minister.

95
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,403
I won't give the video.

96
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,864
Boss, these little boys backstabbed us.

97
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,188
You just walked away.

98
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:42,672
Politics! Police! Hooliganism!

99
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:45,116
Who do I choose?

100
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:48,941
Summon our men. Shiva is with us.

101
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,031
Tagaru!

102
00:09:56,734 --> 00:10:01,036
If I come casually, I am a guest, but if
I come looking for you, you're finished.

103
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,139
Chitte!

104
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,526
Chitte!

105
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,973
I will kill Uncle!

106
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,767
Leave me!

107
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:22,357
I will kill Uncle before
performing Chitte's last rites.

108
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:23,869
I will kill him!

109
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:32,209
Chitte! Jack! Santosh!

110
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,381
They all got killed.

111
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,760
I will talk to boss.

112
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,289
I will kill him!

113
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:43,590
If it is tails, he will be alive,
if it is heads, I will be alive.

114
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,476
I will kill him.

115
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:54,443
Subbi, both of us know that
boss didn't get Chitte killed.

116
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:57,123
Arrange for a meeting, I will bring him.

117
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:25,334
Someone is playing game.

118
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,069
Who killed Uncle?

119
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:30,716
People think I killed him.

120
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,722
Even you think I killed him.

121
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,435
I want to know who killed him.

122
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:49,556
Look, I have summoned
them from Shivamogga.

123
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:21,626
Subbi, I don't wish to live in Bangalore,
I will make money and go to Dubai.

124
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,423
Good you already peed.

125
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,380
Otherwise,
you would've peed as soon as you saw me.

126
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:26,463
Who the hell are you?
You have tied me up.

127
00:17:28,517 --> 00:17:30,754
Don't do that, I won't scream.

128
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,479
Please!

129
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:47,505
Ma'am, do you have oil?

130
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:50,770
Take it. Apply this on your head

131
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,541
you will be all right.

132
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:55,816
No, I want liquor.

133
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:06,571
Hello! I want to know who you are.

134
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,500
Give me my phone. Do you know Tamil?

135
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:11,888
Do you know Konkani, Tulu?

136
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,666
I am talking to you in different
languages but you aren't responding.

137
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:17,239
I am going to kill you, I am telling you.

138
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:20,206
You are scared that
I would call the police or my friends

139
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:21,616
if you gave the phone, isn't it?

140
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,799
Otherwise, give me the phone.

141
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:27,517
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

142
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:32,793
Oh no.

143
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,890
The battery is dead.

144
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:38,759
Oh cool. Power bank.
Dude, you're awesome.

145
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:40,855
Will you get me whatever I ask, baby?

146
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,352
Are you trying to woo me?

147
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:46,833
You kidnapped me,
you're trying to be good now.

148
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:48,831
What are your intentions?

149
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:52,171
Baby.
- My name is Shiva.

150
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:54,160
My name is Punarvasu.

151
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:56,095
You can call me Vasu.

152
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,975
Hail Lord Shiva.

153
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:01,500
Shiva, I like this place very much,
let's stay here.

154
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,213
Meanwhile, I need cigarettes and liquor.

155
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:07,931
You made it. Yes!

156
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:12,373
Love you. Have fun.

157
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,773
You don't drink,
you don't smoke, you don't touch girls

158
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,216
you're trying to be a good man.

159
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:22,967
It's futile. See, be normal like me.

160
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,808
Wow! What a great way to start my morning.

161
00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:02,320
Love you, baby.
You well aware of my needs. Thank you.

162
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:10,307
You think it is easy to break that bottle?
- I gulp down the entire liquor bottle.

163
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:14,004
Won't I be able to break
that empty bottle? - Come on.

164
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:16,306
Come on!

165
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:19,963
Yes! Awesome!

166
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:25,136
I don't usually lose, even if I lose,
I will be the man of the match.

167
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:27,654
Super!

168
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:30,195
You're too good.

169
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,993
Hey you! I will punch you!

170
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,127
You're silent all the time, like a sage.

171
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:13,613
That's why your ex-girlfriend
must've ditched you.

172
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:17,970
Fall in love with me,
I will take you to another world.

173
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,056
Okay, baby? Bye!

174
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:41,013
Vasu, I am sorry.

175
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,233
I am getting married.

176
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:46,319
You must be with me, okay?

177
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:04,616
Do you know to dance? Come, let's dance.

178
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:04,409
What the hell did I do last night?

179
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:21,865
Ma'am!

180
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,242
I am sorry, ma'am.

181
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:30,490
Sorry. I burnt your hut.

182
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,943
I can rebuild the hut

183
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:36,379
but if your life gets ruined,
you can't do anything.

184
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:39,644
You're a young girl.
Give up drinking and smoking.

185
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,745
I have given money
to the boys to build hut.

186
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:46,679
Please forgive us, ma'am.

187
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:49,533
Take it.

188
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:54,915
Please forgive her.

189
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:07,149
You don't know the value of
pinch of vermillion.

190
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:10,867
Wear the seatbelt first.
- Let that be.

191
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:14,877
I have a doubt.
I didn't see you in Manipal.

192
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:19,492
If you have planned to kidnap me
since you're in love with me

193
00:29:19,686 --> 00:29:22,702
let me tell you something,
I am very expensive, you know?

194
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:24,961
I am like a free bird.

195
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,695
I am like a flying bird.

196
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:31,143
You need to check on
the wings before you fly.

197
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:33,910
You need to know the
depth before you fetch water.

198
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,001
You need to know the girl's
opinion before falling in love with her.

199
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:39,347
Don't be hasty.

200
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:43,217
You need to be patient.
- All right. - So be it.

201
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:15,222
Shall we go to the room, baby?
To family room.

202
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:19,026
Get me lentils curry and rolled bread.

203
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:21,836
Okay.
- Ask what my husband wants to eat.

204
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:25,944
People try to know if I am married.

205
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,981
Marry me at the earliest.

206
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:11,902
Help! Shiva, I am here!
Hello! Please help!

207
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:36,463
Don!

208
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:45,355
Give me my purse!
- Come on. Let's go.

209
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:50,142
"Talk to me, my beloved."

210
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,822
She is beautiful, feel her.

211
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:55,027
She is beautiful
and will bring good fortune.

212
00:34:55,107 --> 00:34:57,967
Marry her.
- She is beautiful.

213
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:00,809
Feel her.
You will be your lucky charm.

214
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:02,787
Give me money!

215
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,079
My name is Shrinivas.

216
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,950
She is my wife Padmawati.
- Tell me.

217
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:50,322
I am a real estate agent, sir.

218
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:54,126
I want my son to become an engineer.
He used to study well.

219
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,434
He went for a cricket
match on February 24th night.

220
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:04,066
We got a call from Victoria Hospital
saying there's a postmortem.

221
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:05,854
We were petrified, sir.

222
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:08,308
When children leave the house

223
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:12,310
parents ask them to take
care of themselves.

224
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,923
Why should we caution
them though there's police. See.

225
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,923
Take a look at this photograph, sir.

226
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,154
His photograph was in the newspapers.

227
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,894
The media connected him to gangsters.

228
00:39:26,175 --> 00:39:29,309
It was the police who told us
that our son is a rowdy.

229
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:33,169
Sir, my son is not a rowdy.
The guilty should be punished.

230
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:36,811
Don't spare him, sir.
We will take your leave.

231
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:42,043
I am married for...
- Come to the point.

232
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:45,004
My daughter committed suicide.

233
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:50,138
Why? - She had been to her
friend's birthday few days ago

234
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:53,931
she was sad for 15 days.

235
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:58,643
She recorded a video, posted
it on Facebook and committed suicide.

236
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:02,167
My daughter was a strong girl.

237
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:08,361
Did you follow up on Tejaswini's case?
- Her family didn't register case, sir.

238
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,603
When we checked her call
records taking self interest

239
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:13,667
we developed suspicion on Cockroach.

240
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:19,439
What place is this?
- It's Ruby Resort.

241
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,915
The place where Tejaswini
had been for her friend's birthday.

242
00:40:21,995 --> 00:40:25,103
Her last posts were birthday photographs.

243
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:29,945
After 15 days,
she uploaded this video and died.

244
00:40:30,025 --> 00:40:33,361
'I can't explain you guys more about it.'

245
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:39,025
'But miss you so much. I can't live...'

246
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:51,023
Who is Jamun Ravi?
- Jamun Ravi is Cockroach's disciple.

247
00:40:51,423 --> 00:40:54,304
Sir, Cockroach used to harm people
for small sum of money,

248
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:56,762
he is now no 1 in honey trapping.

249
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,340
He is Dolly's real brother.

250
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:02,004
Who is Dolly?

251
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:07,138
Dolly alias Nimbe,
people also call him Mental.

252
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:11,332
He is Uncle's disciple.
He is now an infamous goon.

253
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:14,780
Uncle is only known as a gangster,
but the real gangster is him.

254
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:26,431
The greediness for fame is more than
the greediness for women, gold and land.

255
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:29,717
In this bad era,
it is the bad that triumphs.

256
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:34,570
He promotes only bad things.
It is very difficult to promote good.

257
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:42,438
Look at this. Our society
is also rotten like this fruit.

258
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:46,998
From 1994 till 2000 I had
killed eight criminals in encounters.

259
00:41:47,078 --> 00:41:52,337
In that list, Baby Krishna
and the present Don Uncle got away.

260
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:55,947
Don Uncle. His real name is Narayan Swami.
He is a mastermind.

261
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:59,806
He made plotting, contract killing
and hooliganism as business.

262
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:00,853
He is very intelligent.

263
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:03,644
It's very dangerous when
an intelligent person becomes a criminal.

264
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:05,664
Hooliganism now runs not with muscle power

265
00:42:05,744 --> 00:42:07,686
but intelligence
and he is an example to that.

266
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:11,166
Boss, I want to take a picture with you.
- He declared himself as a gangster.

267
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:15,522
Things changed in Uncle's
life after Dolly came.

268
00:42:15,748 --> 00:42:20,320
Dolly's mother used to sell
lemons outside the goddess's temple.

269
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,979
Did you pledge your gold bangles?

270
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:26,027
Last night,
my younger son took the cutting player

271
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:28,751
and took away my earrings and bangles.

272
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:30,804
Didn't you know when he was doing that?

273
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,593
I did know, but I got scared

274
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:36,229
that he would kill me

275
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:39,084
if I opened my eyes and saw, Ratna.

276
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:43,548
She has two sons. Dolly is her elder
son and Cockroach is her younger son.

277
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:46,238
The elder brother loves
his younger brother very much.

278
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,913
He bought him a bike
and gave him money to make merry.

279
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,443
Dolly is a womaniser.

280
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:55,122
He used to cheat on girls.

281
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:57,943
He shot a video of a girl named Kausalya

282
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:00,083
and harassed her a lot.

283
00:43:00,288 --> 00:43:03,087
She committed suicide.

284
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:06,329
Where is your son Dolly?
- I don't know.

285
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:09,356
Tell me the truth else we will take
you to the police station. - It's true.

286
00:43:09,436 --> 00:43:11,896
I am telling the truth, I don't know.

287
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:13,648
What do I do?

288
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:17,485
After knowing that it is
because of her son that girl died

289
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,970
she hit him with slipper and cursed him.

290
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:24,109
When Dolly was drinking in the bar,
frustrated

291
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:25,698
Satish came there.

292
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,054
Your order, sir.
- Bring a bottle of brandy.

293
00:43:28,134 --> 00:43:29,427
Okay, sir.
- No, my head is aching.

294
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,140
Bring chopped lemon.
- There is no lemon.

295
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:36,312
He has lemons.
- If you have two lemons, give us.

296
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,781
Do you have lemon?
He must've kept it in his pocket.

297
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:43,488
It was I who gave money
to your mother to sell lemons.

298
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,914
Hit me!

299
00:43:48,298 --> 00:43:50,989
Oh, my God! Let go!

300
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:59,841
Dolly severed Satish's head.

301
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:04,521
Dolly took the head to the police station.

302
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:09,547
After this murder, Dolly's name
was in the list of notorious goons.

303
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,929
Dolly met Chitte in the jail.

304
00:44:13,286 --> 00:44:16,885
Chitte alias Chitranjan. He is a poet.

305
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:21,944
His couplets turned him into a criminal.

306
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:25,791
Chitte wrote a love letter for his friend.

307
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,851
The girl that his friend was in love with

308
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:32,796
is the younger sister
of a local goon Satish.

309
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,902
When Satish enquired

310
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:38,307
he learnt that... - Not me,
the couplet was written by Chitte.

311
00:44:38,847 --> 00:44:41,777
Satish insulted Chitte's parents.

312
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:47,516
After learning about it,
Chitte attacked Satish brutally.

313
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:51,872
Satish's men hospitalised him.

314
00:44:52,098 --> 00:44:54,109
Satish survived in the hospital.

315
00:44:54,498 --> 00:44:57,859
Chitte was booked under
the section 307 and was jailed.

316
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:01,674
Because Dolly killed Satish

317
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:03,933
Chitte befriended Dolly.

318
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:06,798
If I have to tell you
about Dolly and Chitte

319
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,867
Dolly was a womaniser

320
00:45:10,904 --> 00:45:16,622
but Chitte was deeply in love with a girl.

321
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:24,339
Dolly was already out of control

322
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:28,004
after Chitte joined him,
both became more notorious.

323
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:33,343
When they killed Uncle's enemy Sarakki,
they joined him.

324
00:45:33,423 --> 00:45:36,813
Uncle taught them a new
lesson about hooliganism.

325
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:40,747
He handed over the market to them.

326
00:45:48,616 --> 00:45:51,653
Hey! He's already dead.

327
00:45:51,977 --> 00:45:53,199
Let go.

328
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,536
Sir, this video was made on Shivarathri
when they were playing cricket.

329
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:15,908
Sir, in the footage we have got,

330
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:18,551
somebody has thrown a stone
at the CCTV when the murder took place.

331
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:22,768
Sir, no one recorded a video
while the murder took place.

332
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:32,118
Chitte.

333
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:38,699
You can exhale the smoke, if not,
it will come out from your other end.

334
00:48:42,168 --> 00:48:45,768
If you have to hit the target,
you've to do it smoothly.

335
00:48:47,918 --> 00:48:52,122
Cockroach, you stay in the filth.

336
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:54,890
Sir...

337
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,641
People say life is short.

338
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:00,965
Your life is long.

339
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:05,900
Dolly, if I come just like that,
I am a guest

340
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,078
and if I come looking for you,
you'll be dead.

341
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,553
Sir, why are you saying so?
Please have a seat.

342
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:13,363
Subbe, get Biryani for sir.

343
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,482
Tell the vendor that his men are with him.
He will give it for free.

344
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,805
Food, clothing, and house.

345
00:49:18,097 --> 00:49:19,880
You get everything free, don't you?

346
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:23,187
Sir, no one gives money for free,
one has to work hard for it.

347
00:49:24,442 --> 00:49:27,219
You have to shed your blood.
- You have to shed your blood?

348
00:49:28,506 --> 00:49:31,456
Why were you looking for my phone number?
- Sir, they've made an encounter list.

349
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:35,715
Like you book a station,
I thought I can book you too.

350
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:39,196
How much will you give me?
- Sir, let's weigh you.

351
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,357
We'll weigh you with the
equal amount of money on a scale.

352
00:49:41,953 --> 00:49:43,952
With Rs. 2000 new notes.

353
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:49,010
This world is black and white
and you want to weigh me with pink notes.

354
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,756
Department has given me a list,
I too have a small list.

355
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:56,005
You can kill all of them.

356
00:49:56,669 --> 00:49:58,036
Sir, if we kill,
it will be considered as murder,

357
00:49:58,116 --> 00:49:59,041
but if you do, it will be encounter.

358
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:02,315
What are you thinking?

359
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:05,883
Who told you that I am
working for the department?

360
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:07,817
I work for Ankush.

361
00:50:08,768 --> 00:50:13,470
I was thinking... I have been
trained as how to nab a criminal.

362
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:17,859
I become the criminal,
I will kill you first.

363
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:21,047
I didn't like your deal.

364
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:25,414
Why, sir?
- I will sweep your business.

365
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:28,343
I am the brand ambassador
of Swacch Bharat.

366
00:50:29,716 --> 00:50:32,861
Clean city, Jamun Ravi,
Cottenpet Manja,

367
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:35,995
Kata, Jiya, Omelet, Tarkari Khalil,

368
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,843
I'll hit all the wickets.

369
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:40,924
I will set a frame for you too.

370
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:44,242
It's doubtful that I may
not attend your funeral tomorrow.

371
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,771
So, I will put this garland
around your neck in advance.

372
00:50:47,851 --> 00:50:51,105
If you're unlucky,
even if you're sitting on a camel,

373
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:54,844
the dog will bite you. Be careful!

374
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,827
Sir, the police has arrested Niranjan.

375
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,064
Did you make breakfast?
- Yes, sir.

376
00:52:17,453 --> 00:52:19,831
If you tell the truth,
sir will spare you. - Okay.

377
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:23,106
Sir, that boy was in love
with Padmanabhan's daughter.

378
00:52:24,446 --> 00:52:26,046
Our boss learned about it.

379
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:28,596
You know who her father is, don't you?

380
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:32,951
Yes, sir. - Play cricket,
study well, and live your life peacefully.

381
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:35,113
Don't meet that girl again.

382
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,064
Sir, that boy was quiet for two days,

383
00:52:38,144 --> 00:52:40,366
he is going around with that girl again.

384
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:44,420
Sir, that girl's father informed our boss.
- Padmanabhan had called.

385
00:52:44,722 --> 00:52:47,197
That boy won't give up so easily.
Calm him down.

386
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:51,142
Sir, we had gone to warn
that guy on Shivarathri night.

387
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,225
Sir, he murdered him for a silly matter.

388
00:53:01,305 --> 00:53:05,062
Boss, ACP Shiva is coming
to meet you tomorrow morning.

389
00:53:06,553 --> 00:53:08,649
Ask Dolly and Chitte to come tomorrow.

390
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:13,546
Do you belong to the Landlord family?
- Sir, I reached here by working hard.

391
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:15,589
Working hard?

392
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:18,539
If you have a land, you sell it,
people who are rich have a lot of money.

393
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:20,971
Why are you doing real estate business?

394
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:23,295
One should be balanced in life.

395
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:25,716
Good. - One moment,
I will tell him to call you later.

396
00:53:27,153 --> 00:53:29,801
Hey, you threaten people

397
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:32,623
by saying, 'sir is busy',
'sir is on the other line',

398
00:53:32,703 --> 00:53:35,174
'I'll tell sir to call you up'
and show your power.

399
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:37,422
If everyone stands on their feet,

400
00:53:37,703 --> 00:53:39,962
but you rely on phone calls.

401
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:44,577
Do you know why he has hired you?

402
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:47,776
Are you playing with
their lives to save your life?

403
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,835
You're a player. You're the bow

404
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,748
and they are the arrows.
- I have seen the

405
00:53:55,061 --> 00:53:57,125
devotion, old stories, and power.

406
00:53:57,205 --> 00:54:01,405
Many people got involved in it,
earned money, and even died.

407
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:06,562
Hello, our department is like a bean.

408
00:54:06,736 --> 00:54:09,513
Sometimes you can find
worms in the beans.

409
00:54:09,816 --> 00:54:11,859
If you're feeding two worms,

410
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:14,323
don't consider that you're
feeding the entire department.

411
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:17,717
If Brahma has written
your destiny in a pen

412
00:54:17,912 --> 00:54:20,387
I will write it in a guy.
- Sir, forget it.

413
00:54:20,873 --> 00:54:24,710
Even we are men. - Growing the beard
and moustache doesn't make you a man.

414
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:29,564
If you believe in that,
Bear would be the bravest man.

415
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,244
If you want to become a man,
you should have blood.

416
00:54:35,065 --> 00:54:38,027
That should be pure... Shankar!
- Sir.

417
00:54:38,448 --> 00:54:40,318
Get me water from the car.
- Okay, sir.

418
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:44,383
Our lives are like small functions.

419
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:48,155
You should attend the function

420
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:50,911
eat and then leave like others do.

421
00:54:51,182 --> 00:54:53,851
I go only when I am invited.

422
00:54:54,926 --> 00:54:57,461
Once if I go, I return after blessing them.
- Sir.

423
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,605
Sir, have food peacefully.

424
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:07,177
Peacefully?
You all are peaceful as a group, right?

425
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:09,945
I've come here to ruin that peace.

426
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:12,355
I will make sure that your dead bodies
are not found to perform the last rites.

427
00:55:13,328 --> 00:55:15,155
They shouldn't get your
ashes to immerse in water.

428
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:19,197
Just check if I have a mole on my tongue?

429
00:55:21,758 --> 00:55:22,969
I have it somewhere else.

430
00:55:34,662 --> 00:55:36,780
Hey, how are you?
- Sir, greetings.

431
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,807
How is your boss? - He's good.
- Where is he? - Sir, I'll call him.

432
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:41,936
Baby, happy birthday!

433
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,270
Thanks, sir. How are you?
- I am superb.

434
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,080
Get your bald friend
Sahiti along to our house.

435
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,910
Sahiti is here,
he's drinking tender coconut by

436
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,020
mixing rock sugar
as he was feeling hot.

437
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,462
Is it?
- Okay, Baby, I will meet you.

438
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:55,013
I have so much to talk to you.
- Okay, bye.

439
00:55:56,008 --> 00:55:57,975
Why did you get a beer in the afternoon?

440
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,191
Sir, this is not beer, but Champaign.

441
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:04,374
I know, it has only fizz in it.
It slowly makes you go high.

442
00:56:04,547 --> 00:56:07,667
Which was that whiskey,
something called JC... single malt.

443
00:56:07,747 --> 00:56:08,849
Sir, it is single malt.

444
00:56:08,928 --> 00:56:10,589
Yes.
- I will get it for you.

445
00:56:17,776 --> 00:56:20,197
Everyone is here.
- Hi, Baby. - Hey!

446
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,278
Sir, please leave me.

447
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:27,677
'Happy birthday, Baby boss.'

448
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:29,720
To hell with you guys!

449
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,389
Why do you people like you
get born and celebrate birthdays?

450
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,173
Who is the boss?

451
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,837
One needs to be destined
and need to have status.

452
00:56:38,324 --> 00:56:39,869
No one should be called
as boss just like that.

453
00:56:40,128 --> 00:56:42,009
Was it Cockroach who went on the bike?
- Yes, sir.

454
00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:43,890
Why did he go out?
- Sir, he went to buy whiskey.

455
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,316
But you had Champaign here.

456
00:56:45,396 --> 00:56:47,802
Sir asked him to get single malt.

457
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:51,976
Poor guy, we could've killed
him after he drank two pegs.

458
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,967
There are people who are very rich,

459
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:01,464
they are called the
people with golden heart.

460
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:02,987
Venkatesh, click a picture.
- Sir.

461
00:57:04,306 --> 00:57:05,733
Thank you.

462
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,894
Where do these people get the guns from?

463
00:57:08,781 --> 00:57:10,467
Does it work?

464
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:15,223
It works.

465
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,509
Sorry.

466
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:24,647
Hey, sing happy birthday song.

467
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:27,782
"Happy birthday to you."
- Come on, you all sing.

468
00:57:28,214 --> 00:57:30,580
"Happy birthday to you."

469
00:57:31,337 --> 00:57:32,926
Today is sir's birthday.'

470
00:57:33,005 --> 00:57:35,379
We'll cut the cake and enjoy the party...

471
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:39,681
"Happy birthday to you." - Cockroach,
you too sing the happy birthday song.

472
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:42,436
"Happy birthday to you."

473
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:46,262
"Happy birthday to you."

474
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:48,186
"Happy birthday.."
- Cockroach,

475
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:49,916
shall we party?

476
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,181
Single malt, it is a good drink.

477
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:55,780
What is your name?
- Rita.

478
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,477
Hey, come on, take out your clothes.
- Sir..

479
00:57:58,557 --> 00:58:01,546
Sir... - Come on, remove your pants.
- Sir... - Come on, take it out.

480
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:20,581
Come on, look here.
Cockroach, smile.

481
00:58:26,061 --> 00:58:28,904
You don't worry, he won't reach you.

482
00:58:31,768 --> 00:58:33,843
What do you think of yourself?

483
00:58:34,254 --> 00:58:35,767
Sir...
- Speak up.

484
00:58:36,772 --> 00:58:38,545
Hey, get up.
- Sir.

485
00:58:41,516 --> 00:58:44,661
'I can't explain you guys
more about these things.'

486
00:58:46,012 --> 00:58:47,299
'But I miss you so much.'

487
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,633
The girl in the video is Tejaswini.
- 'I miss you.'

488
00:58:49,713 --> 00:58:51,633
You know her, don't you?
- Sir, forgive me.

489
00:58:51,713 --> 00:58:53,264
Sir, I won't make a mistake again.

490
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:55,232
Sir, please sir, leave me.

491
00:58:55,729 --> 00:58:56,993
Sir...

492
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:00,668
The pot of your sins has got filled.

493
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:03,911
You kidnapped a Seth's daughter in 2014,

494
00:59:04,689 --> 00:59:08,072
was it your first case? People tied you
to a pole and thrashed you,

495
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,617
was it the same.
- I made a small kid sit in the auto

496
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:15,215
and gave her chocolate.
That's it, sir.

497
00:59:15,713 --> 00:59:17,248
You gave her chocolate.

498
00:59:18,374 --> 00:59:20,005
No animal

499
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:22,795
kills another animal from the same herd

500
00:59:23,368 --> 00:59:24,632
and live.

501
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,664
But a human being,

502
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:29,841
even if he doesn't have nails,

503
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,716
it uses it hands,

504
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:35,635
uses its brains and kill.

505
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:39,082
You and cockroach got arrested in a case,

506
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:41,383
where the dead body was found in the well,

507
00:59:41,686 --> 00:59:44,270
it was a girl, right?
What was that girl's name?

508
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,583
Spandana.

509
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:51,252
It's a cute name, right?
Do you have mother, sister,

510
00:59:51,332 --> 00:59:53,133
brother, father..
- Sir, I have a brother and a mother.

511
00:59:53,213 --> 00:59:55,683
Is your brother married?
- Sir, he has a child.

512
00:59:55,763 --> 00:59:57,622
What child?
- A girl child, sir.

513
00:59:57,742 --> 00:59:59,942
How old is she?
- 11 years old.

514
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:05,974
Sir... what does that kid address you as?

515
01:00:11,497 --> 01:00:12,653
Uncle, sir.

516
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:19,571
Your friend owned a mobile shop.

517
01:00:20,004 --> 01:00:22,208
What was that guy's name?
- Prashanth, sir.

518
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:27,384
Did cockroach come there?
- Yes, sir.

519
01:00:28,422 --> 01:00:32,551
How do you entice girls?
- In Cockroach's resort,

520
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:35,426
techies come during the weekends.

521
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:41,328
Sir, we place cameras in their washrooms,
bedrooms, and then take their number.

522
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,970
I can't come to the
places where you call me.

523
01:00:47,003 --> 01:00:49,607
Venkatesh, do you know how
to make a boat with this paper? - Sir.

524
01:00:50,905 --> 01:00:52,385
No, sir.
- Okay.

525
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,389
Sir... Sir... I know.

526
01:01:08,673 --> 01:01:09,732
Take this.

527
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:12,877
Wow, you made it so soon.

528
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,546
Venkatesh, did you see?

529
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,691
How did you kill Spandana?

530
01:01:27,674 --> 01:01:34,019
Cockroach had brought new stuff that day.

531
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:36,279
We smoked that...

532
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:41,076
Sir, we slept.

533
01:01:41,605 --> 01:01:46,523
When we woke up, we found
the girl lying in the pool of blood.

534
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:09,284
Saroja...

535
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,710
Saroja!
- Sir.

536
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:15,953
Take her.
- Hey, get up!

537
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:36,964
Cockroach is not here.
Why have you brought me here?

538
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:44,433
Where is my brother?

539
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,567
He's inside. Leave me.

540
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:52,441
Dolly, sir is calling you.

541
01:02:56,279 --> 01:02:58,841
Greetings, sir.
- It is okay if you love food,

542
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,537
but it will be difficult
if you love every other girl.

543
01:03:03,261 --> 01:03:06,147
You're not living like a coward.

544
01:03:06,227 --> 01:03:08,720
You're earning honestly
and getting your sister married.

545
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,361
It's okay if you drink some.

546
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:16,263
I have called you here,
made you sit, and offered tea to you.

547
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:20,197
One can't force respect from others.

548
01:03:20,932 --> 01:03:24,596
You have to gain it. You go. I will come
to your sister's wedding. - Okay, sir.

549
01:03:25,255 --> 01:03:26,844
Dolly,

550
01:03:27,276 --> 01:03:30,800
you've brought a lawyer and a goon along.

551
01:03:31,718 --> 01:03:33,761
Sir, I heard you arrested
my brother Cockroach.

552
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:35,492
Who told you?

553
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,739
Go and file a missing complaint.

554
01:03:37,819 --> 01:03:40,139
Sir...

555
01:03:40,895 --> 01:03:43,435
Shankar, tell me. I will meet you
in the club in the evening.

556
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:47,769
You can find a thing if it is lost.

557
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,633
Even humanity can be regained.

558
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:54,113
But we can't find mosquitoes,
leeches, or cockroaches.

559
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,789
Subbi, go and find them in a gutter.

560
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:00,587
Sir, he is very arrogant.

561
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:02,932
He asked me to look
for my brother in a gutter.

562
01:04:05,298 --> 01:04:07,330
Sir, I didn't do anything.
He's a criminal.

563
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,102
He came to attack me.

564
01:04:09,384 --> 01:04:11,307
I fired two bullets for self-defense.

565
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:13,783
I shot on his leg.
- Department will enquire you.

566
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:16,041
First, release Dolly's brother.

567
01:04:20,842 --> 01:04:22,505
You have a tattoo on your skin.

568
01:04:22,585 --> 01:04:23,898
You've tattooed sanskrit
verses on your body.

569
01:04:23,978 --> 01:04:25,652
Are you very devotional?
- No, sir.

570
01:04:25,732 --> 01:04:27,841
You're a cockroach
wearing an undergarment.

571
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:29,813
Come on, run.
Britishers gave us the freedom,

572
01:04:29,893 --> 01:04:33,731
I am giving you freedom, go.
- Sir, you have a gun in your hand.

573
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:35,326
Hey!
- Sit here quietly.

574
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:38,325
I'll to mad if I am holding the gun.

575
01:04:38,405 --> 01:04:39,973
Before I go mad, run away!

576
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:40,910
Sir, please don't.

577
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,067
You'll ask me to run and shoot me
from behind. I won't go. - Oh.

578
01:04:44,472 --> 01:04:48,295
Why do you think so?
I have a gun in my hand and guts too.

579
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:50,146
We both are heartless.

580
01:04:50,363 --> 01:04:52,605
Come on, run. Murthy.
- Sir.

581
01:04:52,685 --> 01:04:58,239
Tell him to run. Untie him. Come on run.
- Sir, leave me.

582
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,049
I'm telling you to run.

583
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:04,008
Come on, run!

584
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,724
Come on, get up. Give it to me.

585
01:05:10,872 --> 01:05:13,734
You play with dignity of the girls
and murder people.

586
01:05:13,814 --> 01:05:14,532
You don't deserve to wear underwear.

587
01:05:14,612 --> 01:05:17,842
Shankar, pull his underwear.
- Sir, please don't.

588
01:05:17,922 --> 01:05:20,815
Come on, run!

589
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:23,476
Hey, what are you doing?

590
01:05:23,556 --> 01:05:26,786
Don't you have common sense
what to record and what not to?

591
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:29,731
You eat so much food.
Don't you have brains?

592
01:05:29,811 --> 01:05:31,608
Sorry, sir.
- Delete that.

593
01:05:53,685 --> 01:05:55,833
Why have they put him here?

594
01:05:58,009 --> 01:05:59,941
Hey, Cockroach.

595
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:04,143
Get up. - I want to show him
what pain and fear of death is.

596
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:08,724
They used to extort money
from vendors on the footpath.

597
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:11,587
They have become encounter specialists.

598
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:15,803
There are many such brave men these days.

599
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:19,870
Dolly, he has gone so thin.

600
01:06:20,262 --> 01:06:23,194
He's a rogue who's
stepping on a snake hole.

601
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:25,247
He's pouring acid on us.

602
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:29,881
It's not enough to step on a snake hole,
but you should leave your hand inside.

603
01:06:36,353 --> 01:06:38,379
Why should I hit him with the slipper?

604
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:40,069
Look, there's a nail on the slipper.

605
01:06:40,149 --> 01:06:42,054
I picked up to take it out,
he ran away seeing it.

606
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:45,459
Sir, somebody has pissed here.

607
01:06:54,241 --> 01:06:57,578
Hello?
- I entered a no entry zone

608
01:06:57,658 --> 01:06:59,334
and peed on your seat.

609
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:03,981
What could I do?
I had a beer so I had to pee.

610
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,237
Do this,

611
01:07:07,317 --> 01:07:10,344
tell your staff to put up a board saying,

612
01:07:10,424 --> 01:07:14,289
'people who pee here
will be fined Rs. 500'.

613
01:07:19,017 --> 01:07:21,557
You'll get another call.

614
01:07:21,841 --> 01:07:23,760
It is a very important call.

615
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,622
Hello?
- Cockroach.

616
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:39,525
You catch the criminals by following them.

617
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:42,850
Are you a super cop!

618
01:07:43,336 --> 01:07:47,052
I will not spare any girl. You can't save
the girls who tied you rakhi.

619
01:07:47,132 --> 01:07:49,564
I will kill you.

620
01:07:49,644 --> 01:07:54,522
You and your entire department
can't even touch me.

621
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:57,751
You broke my teeth and humiliated me.

622
01:07:57,831 --> 01:08:00,360
You're a coward who sits
in a car and roams around.

623
01:08:01,062 --> 01:08:02,737
Are you Tagaru!

624
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,733
Is any man here?

625
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:24,354
Cockroach!

626
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:26,611
Just calling is not enough.

627
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:29,786
You should have guts to confront too.

628
01:08:31,353 --> 01:08:35,717
Are you a big shot?
I didn't come here on an invitation.

629
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:39,027
I broke your teeth,
still you're talking too much.

630
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:42,526
I will give an offer to a loafer like you.

631
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:45,498
Come on, shoot me.
I won't move an inch from here.

632
01:08:45,944 --> 01:08:47,633
Come on, shoot me.

633
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:56,550
Do you take this gun to be a toy?

634
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,833
You should take training for everything.

635
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:00,482
Hey, come out everyone!

636
01:09:02,062 --> 01:09:04,007
You asked me to come here alone?

637
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,115
You have the entire team with you now.

638
01:09:16,099 --> 01:09:17,801
Hey, please don't.

639
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:28,353
Cockroach isn't answering the phone.

640
01:09:36,147 --> 01:09:40,254
Dolly, your brother wants to talk to you.

641
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:41,740
Look, don't!

642
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:45,293
Dolly, I...
- Don't cry. Don't fear, I am here.

643
01:09:45,373 --> 01:09:49,576
He's crying. - If you even
touch my brother, I won't spare you.

644
01:09:49,656 --> 01:09:51,885
I won't touch him,

645
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:53,805
but I am firing a
small bullet in his head.

646
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:56,642
Look, mess with the department,
but don't mess with my brother.

647
01:09:56,722 --> 01:09:59,601
Sir!

648
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,856
Hello.
- Your brother is dead, pal.

649
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:09,369
What happened?

650
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:11,908
I think he killed Cockroach.
- No chance.

651
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:14,138
He would've fooled you.

652
01:10:14,354 --> 01:10:16,988
'When I am dead, I hope it may be said'

653
01:10:17,068 --> 01:10:20,893
'his sins were scarlet,
but his books were read.'

654
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:23,433
I will leave the one who
tells me who wrote this phrase.

655
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:26,432
If not, I will kill everyone.

656
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:29,877
Come on, tell me.
- Kakini, sir.

657
01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:32,553
It is not Kakini, it is Kaikini.

658
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:34,971
Sir, the one who wrote
the song 'Hale Patre Hale Kabna'?

659
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:36,727
If I ever find the one who wrote it

660
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:38,687
and the one who made it,
I will shoot them both.

661
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,225
Were you sleeping?

662
01:10:49,374 --> 01:10:51,535
How many children do you have?
- Sir, I don't have any children.

663
01:10:51,778 --> 01:10:53,873
Go home and sleep
instead of sleeping here.

664
01:10:55,777 --> 01:10:57,358
It will be useful.

665
01:10:58,264 --> 01:11:00,560
Police station is like
a lamp to the village.

666
01:11:01,398 --> 01:11:03,587
Even when you know you're dying,

667
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:07,532
two ants play under the lamp.

668
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:15,030
It can be man or a woman. Every worm
has to drink water after eating salt.

669
01:11:16,854 --> 01:11:20,003
Why are you drinking water?
- Sir, I have cough. I am unwell.

670
01:11:25,245 --> 01:11:26,892
You are Dolly's best friend.

671
01:11:29,082 --> 01:11:32,582
He's A1 and you're A2 in any case.

672
01:11:32,662 --> 01:11:35,770
Right? Where is he?

673
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:38,673
What?
- I don't know, sir.

674
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,944
Base voice? Hey, hit on his base!

675
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:45,875
Everyone sit down.

676
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:48,564
Even you sit down. Come on!

677
01:11:51,739 --> 01:11:53,778
Are you a hero?

678
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,291
You write poems, don't you?

679
01:11:56,371 --> 01:11:58,426
Poems made you a criminal.

680
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,695
This is the first time that
a poet has become a gangster.

681
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,371
What will you do until he calls?

682
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:07,492
Tell me a poem singing. Come on.

683
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:11,288
"Who wrote this story?"

684
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:15,597
"It was made..."
Sing this in the base voice. Come on.

685
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,636
Come on, sing!

686
01:12:18,988 --> 01:12:22,879
"Who wrote this story?"
- In your base voice.

687
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:25,393
Sing loudly, everyone should hear it.

688
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:31,013
"Who wrote this story?"

689
01:12:32,796 --> 01:12:35,242
Right timing. Take this.

690
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:39,133
Turn the speaker on.

691
01:12:39,348 --> 01:12:42,280
'Chitte, I heard that dog
is looking for you. Be careful.'

692
01:12:42,577 --> 01:12:45,252
'Even if he arrests you, don't worry.'

693
01:12:45,332 --> 01:12:47,441
'I will handle everyone.'

694
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,305
'He can show his manliness
only in his police station.'

695
01:12:50,535 --> 01:12:52,589
'He can't even touch my hair.'

696
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:12,406
Hello, come here. Play a good song.

697
01:13:12,486 --> 01:13:17,189
Come on, do pushups. Come on, do it.
Do I have to tell it especially for you?

698
01:14:22,329 --> 01:14:23,586
He thrashed us in the public

699
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:25,964
and humiliated us.

700
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,963
You had a chance,
you should've killed him.

701
01:14:28,043 --> 01:14:30,112
That would be the last attack.

702
01:14:30,192 --> 01:14:32,827
It's like standing in the graveyard
and drinking poison.

703
01:14:33,692 --> 01:14:37,029
In my service,
I've never seen any rowdy flourish

704
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,354
after messing with the police.

705
01:14:41,475 --> 01:14:43,448
Is he a human?

706
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,784
He is also a common man.

707
01:14:45,864 --> 01:14:47,339
Was he born wearing a uniform?

708
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:50,432
We can kill him, right?

709
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:58,673
Deepa.. Deepa saw it.

710
01:14:59,633 --> 01:15:01,349
She saw it.

711
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:07,860
He has to die.

712
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:13,805
Chitte and Dolly's men
were ready to kill Shivu.

713
01:15:15,156 --> 01:15:17,385
It's not easy to mess with a policeman.

714
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:20,735
I think it will be better if you call.

715
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:28,639
Subbi, I told sir many times,
but he is not telling anything.

716
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:32,017
That cricket match case is
coming on his head.

717
01:15:32,246 --> 01:15:35,420
Mostly, even he thinks
that Shivu should be killed.

718
01:15:35,745 --> 01:15:40,055
Subbi, please, take me along with you.

719
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:44,027
Don't leave me and go, I beg of you.

720
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:46,649
I have never seen it even once.
- Dilip...

721
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:55,189
Sir, if you say yes, we'll kill him.
- Okay, but don't leave any proof behind.

722
01:16:02,254 --> 01:16:05,523
Sir, like you say
he was in PC Saroja's house.

723
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,834
You peed in the police station,

724
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:11,171
I could know who your
informer in the station is.

725
01:16:12,953 --> 01:16:14,697
There are two designs when you're born.

726
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:17,628
One is normal delivery and one
is cesarean. But it is the same case here.

727
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,155
There are variety of designs.

728
01:16:19,235 --> 01:16:21,870
Some people die with happiness.

729
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,789
Even a pyre is like this, right?

730
01:16:24,019 --> 01:16:26,545
Iron rods instead of the tracks
and stones instead of flowers.

731
01:16:31,206 --> 01:16:33,679
Dolly, if you travel
by train it is called journey,

732
01:16:33,909 --> 01:16:36,719
if the train goes over you,
it will be your last journey.

733
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,961
Happy journey.
- Sir, sir..

734
01:16:40,151 --> 01:16:42,029
Sir, sir!

735
01:17:00,551 --> 01:17:03,469
We have to kill uncle
like the climax in the picture.

736
01:17:03,726 --> 01:17:07,049
Uncle left silently
without speaking a word.

737
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:10,468
If he would have done such work,

738
01:17:11,413 --> 01:17:13,292
the police would've raided this place.

739
01:17:13,372 --> 01:17:15,885
Uncle is not so cheap. He's a player.

740
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,750
I will not give him the video.

741
01:17:18,993 --> 01:17:21,965
He plans a lot.
We have to be careful from him.

742
01:17:24,653 --> 01:17:26,059
Baby,

743
01:17:26,343 --> 01:17:29,450
biriyani is very nice.

744
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:33,030
I am missing my mom.
- What if it was not good?

745
01:17:34,504 --> 01:17:36,896
I would've remembered the chef's mom.

746
01:17:41,989 --> 01:17:44,300
Look at him,
he is missing his girlfriend.

747
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:47,204
Chitte!

748
01:17:48,298 --> 01:17:55,459
"I have been waiting for long."

749
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:58,918
"I didn't get any news."

750
01:17:58,998 --> 01:18:01,769
Honey, I will earn good money
and give it to you.

751
01:18:03,107 --> 01:18:05,673
I have some work, I will be back.

752
01:18:05,944 --> 01:18:07,754
Chitte, propose to her today.

753
01:18:12,792 --> 01:18:14,765
Lakshmi, excuse me.

754
01:18:16,927 --> 01:18:18,697
Where are you?
- At home.

755
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,723
Hello.

756
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:26,506
Hello.

757
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:44,473
Chitte!

758
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,904
Dolly has come, get up, Chitte!

759
01:19:01,522 --> 01:19:02,725
What is it?

760
01:19:03,184 --> 01:19:05,386
Nothing.
- What is it?

761
01:19:05,831 --> 01:19:07,223
Couplet.

762
01:19:08,507 --> 01:19:10,560
Read it.
- You're the light

763
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,735
he is... You idiot.

764
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,518
Chitte!

765
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:24,840
Deepa.

766
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:27,179
Come.

767
01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:31,732
Both of you wouldn't
have proposed to each other.

768
01:19:32,298 --> 01:19:34,973
Take a good look at Chitte!

769
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:40,364
Chitte! Chitte!

770
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:49,633
I will kill Uncle.

771
01:19:49,712 --> 01:19:51,848
Leave me. I will kill Uncle.

772
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:57,726
Gang war between Uncle
and Dolly kills many.

773
01:19:57,942 --> 01:20:04,652
Criminal named Uncle shot dead in his
house after he killed Cottonpet Chitte.

774
01:20:04,772 --> 01:20:08,169
Police suspect Dolly behind the murder.

775
01:20:44,242 --> 01:20:46,106
He has a video, take a look.

776
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,642
Nobody is trustworthy.

777
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,344
Summon our men.

778
01:21:07,925 --> 01:21:10,072
I will give you all a task.

779
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:15,572
Hey Shiva!

780
01:22:15,652 --> 01:22:18,274
Shall I kidnap her in an ambulance?

781
01:22:20,841 --> 01:22:22,787
Hi, sister. There's good news for you.

782
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:26,164
You're getting married. I am also in love.

783
01:22:26,678 --> 01:22:28,259
His name is Shiva.

784
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:31,393
Uncle, it's sister. Say hi to her.

785
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,013
Hi.
- Say hi please.

786
01:22:35,337 --> 01:22:36,864
She is my sister.

787
01:22:37,445 --> 01:22:40,849
Hi. - Say it with a smile.
Why are you sullen?

788
01:22:42,592 --> 01:22:45,538
Wish her with smile, she will be glad.

789
01:22:54,686 --> 01:22:57,887
I love rain.
I am quiet because you are there

790
01:22:57,967 --> 01:23:01,197
otherwise, rain, whiskey

791
01:23:01,455 --> 01:23:04,494
chicken curry and millet ball,
wonderful combination.

792
01:23:04,574 --> 01:23:06,156
I will eat chicken curry and millet ball.

793
01:23:06,386 --> 01:23:10,427
I don't drink.
You drink, I will get you one. - No.

794
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,547
No, Shiva.

795
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:16,655
Uncle, sister Panchami's phone is ringing.

796
01:23:34,569 --> 01:23:36,433
Don't hang up the phone, give it to me.

797
01:23:41,174 --> 01:23:42,755
How did you get this?

798
01:23:44,012 --> 01:23:47,173
Uncle, what did you tell me?

799
01:23:48,012 --> 01:23:50,213
You said you didn't sister past one month.

800
01:23:52,619 --> 01:23:54,564
How did he get sister Panchami's phone?

801
01:23:55,591 --> 01:23:57,644
I want to know the truth, uncle.

802
01:23:59,887 --> 01:24:01,184
Punarvasu...

803
01:25:31,987 --> 01:25:33,689
Vasu, go back!

804
01:26:31,788 --> 01:26:34,098
Do you know Dicchy Ashwat?
- No, I don't.

805
01:26:34,178 --> 01:26:37,651
He is 120 kilos,
his head alone is 20 kilos.

806
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,894
He injured his mother with his head

807
01:26:40,974 --> 01:26:42,622
and she slipped into coma.

808
01:26:42,702 --> 01:26:44,433
Is your sir greater than him?

809
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:48,027
He has now reformed.
Do you want to experience it?

810
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:50,526
Mr. Gangadhar.
- Sir.

811
01:26:50,959 --> 01:26:53,635
What's his name? Dicchy Ashwat.

812
01:26:54,067 --> 01:26:55,985
Go and bring him.
- Sir, I was kidding.

813
01:26:56,065 --> 01:26:58,350
Does the government pay me salary
to mock you?

814
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:03,187
I heard about your action.
You step on the foot and...

815
01:27:07,051 --> 01:27:10,563
Superb! You're angry now. Beat me.

816
01:27:29,736 --> 01:27:30,964
Excuse me.

817
01:27:32,045 --> 01:27:33,870
Passport verification.

818
01:28:13,846 --> 01:28:17,534
Is there any criminal case against?
- Sir, I am a doctor, a dentist.

819
01:28:17,723 --> 01:28:20,885
Won't doctors have criminal
cases against them? - Sir.

820
01:28:20,965 --> 01:28:23,613
Look at yourself.

821
01:28:24,087 --> 01:28:26,141
You look like the vendor
selling rat poison in the market.

822
01:28:26,492 --> 01:28:28,613
Cut your hair and behave yourself.
- Okay, sir.

823
01:28:28,882 --> 01:28:31,085
If I see you like this again,
I will bald your head.

824
01:28:31,165 --> 01:28:32,868
Okay, sir.
- Gangadhar. - Sir.

825
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:35,476
Get him biriyani.

826
01:28:37,016 --> 01:28:39,097
Ramesh, get him biriyani.

827
01:28:39,177 --> 01:28:40,529
I don't want to eat meat.

828
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:42,379
Get me just rice.

829
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:44,015
What happened?

830
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:48,676
He broke my teeth.
- She's a dentist, consult her.

831
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:52,987
We will receive a list, we will then
visit your home for enquiry. - Okay, sir.

832
01:28:54,338 --> 01:28:56,692
I know a person named Shiva, he is ACP.

833
01:28:56,772 --> 01:28:58,729
If you give me your consent,
I will get you both married.

834
01:28:58,809 --> 01:29:00,527
Marriage? So early?

835
01:29:00,607 --> 01:29:04,188
I have sent you Shiva's photograph
and his number to you.

836
01:29:04,268 --> 01:29:06,877
I need your permission to send him
your photograph and number.

837
01:29:06,957 --> 01:29:10,173
Are you serious?
Do you need my permission for that?

838
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:17,170
Oh God.

839
01:29:28,236 --> 01:29:29,594
Sir, I don't know anything.

840
01:29:29,674 --> 01:29:33,059
Even before I ask you,
you say you don't know?

841
01:29:33,855 --> 01:29:37,868
How do I turn this on?
- Tell me, I will do it.

842
01:29:37,948 --> 01:29:40,746
Your treatment is different
from the torture that we give.

843
01:29:41,759 --> 01:29:43,812
Sir...
- Here you go. Tell me.

844
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:48,204
Tell me. Tell me.

845
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:53,285
Sir... - Tell me.
- Baby Krishna.

846
01:29:54,825 --> 01:29:58,257
Take him away. Come on.
- Sir.

847
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,499
Get us equipment like this,
it will be very useful.

848
01:30:04,662 --> 01:30:07,755
I have sent you a photograph,
please take a look. - What's the matter?

849
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:10,214
To get you married if you like her.

850
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:14,227
I don't want to get married.
- Shiva, one has to get married.

851
01:30:14,307 --> 01:30:17,146
Do one thing.
Come for lunch when you are free

852
01:30:17,335 --> 01:30:19,644
let's discuss about it.
- Okay, sir.

853
01:30:34,196 --> 01:30:37,452
How dare you ask me money?
I will thrash if you...

854
01:30:38,884 --> 01:30:42,829
Hey! You spend all your money on liquor

855
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,585
if your family asked money for food,
you beat them.

856
01:30:45,855 --> 01:30:48,841
Use your hand for the right purpose

857
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:52,354
don't raise your hand on women.
You yourself know nothing about life

858
01:30:52,638 --> 01:30:55,069
and you have children.

859
01:30:55,934 --> 01:30:57,947
Have you at least bought
apple for your family?

860
01:30:58,447 --> 01:31:01,298
Do you at least know
the price of 1 kilo apple?

861
01:31:01,852 --> 01:31:04,459
You pay tips to the
bartender at the liquor bar.

862
01:31:05,108 --> 01:31:07,931
Beware. Give me the baby. Take it.

863
01:31:08,688 --> 01:31:10,499
Console your child.
Give me your phone.

864
01:31:13,363 --> 01:31:16,051
If he troubles you again,
give me a missed call.

865
01:31:16,348 --> 01:31:18,321
I will thrash him. Take them.

866
01:31:22,495 --> 01:31:24,616
Do you know ACP Ramchander?

867
01:31:26,007 --> 01:31:28,359
Actually, he sent me your photograph.

868
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:32,060
I think he must've spoken to you about me.

869
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:35,290
I wanted to meet you...

870
01:31:58,506 --> 01:32:00,965
Sir, I have also served cucumber salad

871
01:32:01,722 --> 01:32:03,181
I have also served spinach fry.

872
01:32:03,884 --> 01:32:05,830
I have served curry,
check if there's sufficient salt.

873
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:08,153
Shall I serve ghee?
I will serve some.

874
01:32:08,233 --> 01:32:10,652
Since Lord Ganesh intervened between
Lord Shiva and Parvati, he lost his head.

875
01:32:10,935 --> 01:32:11,854
I don't know what constable Gangadhar

876
01:32:11,934 --> 01:32:13,948
will lose if he intervened
between Shiva and Panchami.

877
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,745
Sir, what did I do?
- What did you do?

878
01:32:16,935 --> 01:32:19,785
I am planning to get married,
but you are being a hurdle.

879
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,027
Are you getting married, sir?
- Yes.

880
01:32:22,608 --> 01:32:24,149
Go ahead.

881
01:32:26,837 --> 01:32:29,269
Please go. - Your future will be good too.
- Go away.

882
01:32:35,956 --> 01:32:37,307
Hello.
- Hi.

883
01:32:39,037 --> 01:32:40,509
Am I talking to Panchami?

884
01:32:41,117 --> 01:32:42,860
Yes. Tell me.

885
01:32:43,049 --> 01:32:45,116
I am Shiva.
- Tell me.

886
01:32:46,062 --> 01:32:47,589
Did you have food?

887
01:32:48,885 --> 01:32:52,385
Sorry, I couldn't talk
to you properly that day.

888
01:32:52,465 --> 01:32:55,343
I was busy with a case...
- It's okay.

889
01:32:55,641 --> 01:32:57,302
Are you free tomorrow?

890
01:32:57,613 --> 01:32:59,288
Let's meet.

891
01:33:02,395 --> 01:33:04,625
So?
- What do you mean?

892
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:09,367
Next... Let it be.
Let's talk when we meet.

893
01:33:23,053 --> 01:33:25,661
You're so punctual.
- I am habitual to it.

894
01:33:25,877 --> 01:33:27,985
First, offer prayers to God.

895
01:33:32,861 --> 01:33:34,712
Greetings, sir.
- Okay, go.

896
01:33:34,792 --> 01:33:38,738
I didn't do anything.
- Hey, get going.

897
01:33:38,818 --> 01:33:41,197
I said go.

898
01:33:43,898 --> 01:33:45,317
Come.

899
01:33:46,979 --> 01:33:49,492
Your God is very busy.

900
01:33:49,884 --> 01:33:52,235
God can't solve everyone's problem.

901
01:33:58,085 --> 01:34:00,340
Look there. I found my God.

902
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,732
I am happy, you carry on.

903
01:34:04,029 --> 01:34:06,853
Are you performing veneration?
- Yes. - Give me the offering too.

904
01:34:10,014 --> 01:34:11,920
Can I take the oblation?
- Yes. - Thank you.

905
01:34:14,892 --> 01:34:17,715
Take the oblation.
- Give it. - Share it among yourselves.

906
01:34:19,485 --> 01:34:21,174
Take it.
- Thanks.

907
01:34:22,349 --> 01:34:24,214
Do you believe that God exist?

908
01:34:25,484 --> 01:34:29,970
Yes. I feel God exists
when I see children and nature.

909
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:32,779
About 40-50 children

910
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:35,589
innocent children

911
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:38,955
die in various kinds accidents.

912
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,792
Who does it? Is it God?

913
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:44,656
I doubt it.
- It's police who suspect.

914
01:34:45,386 --> 01:34:47,399
Let's go.
- Where? - Come, I will tell you.

915
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:50,507
Bye.
- Bye.

916
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:54,762
Tell me.
- Is your friend Shiva married?

917
01:34:54,842 --> 01:34:57,032
Why do you have this doubt?

918
01:34:57,315 --> 01:34:59,194
I am sure he has children too.

919
01:34:59,463 --> 01:35:02,368
He is buying toys.
- He is not so courageous to get married.

920
01:35:02,773 --> 01:35:07,069
He must doing duty
being with you. Do this.

921
01:35:07,149 --> 01:35:10,339
You start investigating too.

922
01:35:13,312 --> 01:35:14,960
Wow! Lovely colour.

923
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,946
Did you like it?
- Yes. - Take them all.

924
01:35:17,365 --> 01:35:20,513
Let this be my gift. Come.

925
01:35:26,188 --> 01:35:27,808
Wonderful couple.

926
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:39,591
We had been for a function.

927
01:35:39,956 --> 01:35:43,279
Are they your family friends?
- No, he is Shankar.

928
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:46,053
He used to harass a girl
after kidnapping her.

929
01:35:46,133 --> 01:35:47,494
I killed him in an encounter.

930
01:35:47,832 --> 01:35:50,980
A girl had come with his
mother to receive his body.

931
01:35:51,426 --> 01:35:55,560
The girl was pregnant.
Shankar had promised to marry her.

932
01:35:55,925 --> 01:36:00,843
She delivered baby girl after two months,
the birthday girl in the party.

933
01:36:01,181 --> 01:36:04,680
Why don't you policemen
look at people in normal way?

934
01:36:05,288 --> 01:36:13,894
Look, the case will be clear only
if we doubt the victim and the accused.

935
01:36:14,461 --> 01:36:17,217
You know what happened?
There was a case.

936
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:22,193
A woman... - My husband
has not come home past three days.

937
01:36:22,273 --> 01:36:24,611
I can't live without him.

938
01:36:24,691 --> 01:36:26,178
Please find him, sir.

939
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:29,553
Did you call your husband?
- Yes, sir. It says it is switched off.

940
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:31,511
Give me the mobile.

941
01:36:31,591 --> 01:36:34,875
I checked which number
she had dialed from her mobile.

942
01:36:35,483 --> 01:36:37,794
She has called seven to
eight times to the same number.

943
01:36:38,348 --> 01:36:39,793
I dialed the number.

944
01:36:40,144 --> 01:36:41,198
It got disconnected.

945
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,616
What does your husband do?

946
01:36:43,696 --> 01:36:44,940
Sir, he's a carpenter.

947
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:46,873
I got a call from the
same number again immediately.

948
01:36:46,953 --> 01:36:48,291
I received the call.

949
01:36:48,371 --> 01:36:49,271
'I heard a voice which said,
'Tell me, Chinni'.'

950
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:51,390
Your Chinni is in the police station.

951
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:54,303
Idiot, I will send her to you.

952
01:36:54,492 --> 01:36:57,329
Hey! Tell me.

953
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,464
You and your boyfriend,
where have you hidden your husband?

954
01:37:00,854 --> 01:37:04,057
Hey! Listen.
- Sir. - Call this guy here.

955
01:37:04,246 --> 01:37:05,799
First trace this number.

956
01:37:05,879 --> 01:37:09,501
Ms. Saroja..
- Yes, sir.

957
01:37:11,488 --> 01:37:13,663
Take her.
- Get up.

958
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:17,824
I just made a phone call.
The truth came out.

959
01:37:18,864 --> 01:37:21,769
Like a local sari loses
its colour when put in water,

960
01:37:21,849 --> 01:37:24,511
her face faded like that. She got caught.

961
01:37:25,998 --> 01:37:27,848
I have to doubt on them.

962
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:31,226
One second.

963
01:37:31,456 --> 01:37:32,887
Pour some ghee.

964
01:37:34,968 --> 01:37:36,562
That's chutney.
- Yes, I know.

965
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:39,953
Why are you eating with chutney,
there's curry. - It is a good combination.

966
01:37:44,169 --> 01:37:45,290
Here.

967
01:37:46,127 --> 01:37:47,114
Have it.

968
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:52,599
Do you know what a morsel is?
- No.

969
01:37:53,288 --> 01:37:57,044
My grandma would call me
and give me a morsel in my hand.

970
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:03,406
Tagaru Shiva, come here.

971
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:08,675
She always used to show the
mountains to me and tell me one thing.

972
01:38:08,755 --> 01:38:12,080
'Look there, a Godly man lives there.'

973
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,728
'You go there and study hard.'

974
01:38:14,808 --> 01:38:18,889
'Somebody killed my grandma
for the gold chain around her neck.'

975
01:38:18,969 --> 01:38:22,767
'I had seen thieves
run away from the police.'

976
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:26,117
'Police arrested my grandma's murderers.'

977
01:38:26,968 --> 01:38:30,359
'I decided to become a police man.'

978
01:38:30,927 --> 01:38:32,183
I joined the Siddaganga Matha.

979
01:38:32,643 --> 01:38:36,993
'I became a policeman. I still go there,'

980
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,669
'when I want to take Swami's blessings.
I visit the Matha.'

981
01:38:40,236 --> 01:38:42,195
I meet everyone.

982
01:38:43,925 --> 01:38:46,127
People tell hundred
lies to get someone married.

983
01:38:46,546 --> 01:38:48,937
When asked to see the
star in the sky during the day,

984
01:38:49,235 --> 01:38:54,463
we say we saw it.
Listen, lies don't work in marriages.

985
01:38:54,543 --> 01:38:56,948
Is it?
- Yes. - Yes.

986
01:38:57,246 --> 01:38:59,840
We put turmeric during marriages,
do you know why?

987
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:02,204
I don't know.

988
01:39:02,284 --> 01:39:05,663
They apply turmeric to the
wounds that you'll get after marriage.

989
01:39:06,325 --> 01:39:09,338
Why are you laughing?
Turmeric is an antiseptic, right?

990
01:39:10,271 --> 01:39:12,677
My friend told me,

991
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:16,824
policemen run their houses like a duty.
- What?

992
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,620
Someone has said it right.

993
01:39:18,971 --> 01:39:20,355
If you do duty, you'll get the salary,

994
01:39:20,435 --> 01:39:22,201
if you run a family,
your wife will snatch the money from you.

995
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:25,173
Your name is Shiva.
Do you know Lord Shiva's character?

996
01:39:25,498 --> 01:39:29,402
What is it? - Even if He has a wife,
he has Ganges on his head.

997
01:39:29,482 --> 01:39:32,888
Lord Shiva is different.

998
01:39:33,077 --> 01:39:34,712
This is Tagaru Shiva.

999
01:39:38,143 --> 01:39:40,534
Mr. Gangadhar,
here's the money for the tea. - Sir.

1000
01:39:40,939 --> 01:39:43,412
You can keep this.
- Okay, sir. - Go.

1001
01:39:44,843 --> 01:39:47,465
I am very honest.
I don't drink anything for free.

1002
01:39:47,545 --> 01:39:50,504
They think policemen take everything
for free. We have to pay money to them.

1003
01:39:53,881 --> 01:39:56,652
Your honest tea is not sweet.
- Truth is bitter.

1004
01:39:57,571 --> 01:39:59,800
Honesty has no value.
- Which is sweet?

1005
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,435
Our heart.

1006
01:40:02,109 --> 01:40:04,258
You're not Tagaru Shiva,
you're Tagaru Poet.

1007
01:42:37,629 --> 01:42:38,765
When can I get the report?

1008
01:42:38,845 --> 01:42:40,372
I have given it to your daughter.
- Daughter?

1009
01:42:41,075 --> 01:42:42,574
Okay.

1010
01:43:41,323 --> 01:43:43,615
Sir, some has peed here.

1011
01:43:44,979 --> 01:43:47,721
Hello. - I had to pee
urgently because I drank beer.

1012
01:43:48,289 --> 01:43:52,963
You will now get another call,
it's a very important call.

1013
01:43:56,152 --> 01:43:59,151
Hello. - When I came,
the main door was open.

1014
01:43:59,341 --> 01:44:02,340
See, cigarettes, beer bottles in my room.

1015
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:05,853
Someone has misused my room.
And look at this.

1016
01:44:06,245 --> 01:44:08,758
Who is Dolly?
- He may be a thief.

1017
01:44:08,838 --> 01:44:11,095
No, nothing is missing from the house.

1018
01:44:11,175 --> 01:44:13,757
Did you have a fight with
anyone in the hospital? - No.

1019
01:44:15,621 --> 01:44:20,431
Hello.
- I am Jirale alias Cockroach.

1020
01:44:20,511 --> 01:44:24,268
Tell me.
- You nab criminals by going after them.

1021
01:44:24,511 --> 01:44:28,767
You... - Don't be afraid.
Call the servant and get the room cleaned.

1022
01:44:29,092 --> 01:44:31,592
Hello. There's a call on the other.

1023
01:44:31,672 --> 01:44:33,807
Trace the location.

1024
01:44:34,347 --> 01:44:36,806
Did you get a call?
I had been to your girlfriend's house.

1025
01:44:36,886 --> 01:44:39,252
I used her bedroom without permission

1026
01:44:39,617 --> 01:44:41,994
I had taken a girl along.

1027
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:49,588
Your girlfriend is stunning,
I saw her in the morning.

1028
01:44:50,695 --> 01:44:52,222
You're very lucky.

1029
01:44:52,302 --> 01:44:54,856
I had not seen a girl like her.

1030
01:44:56,749 --> 01:45:01,572
If I go to your girlfriend's
house the next time, I will go alone.

1031
01:45:03,557 --> 01:45:05,233
He hung the phone getting angry.

1032
01:45:05,313 --> 01:45:07,260
He should suffer.

1033
01:45:07,515 --> 01:45:09,610
I will teach Tagaru Shiva a lesson.

1034
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:12,446
Karanth, do you know the meaning of cruel?

1035
01:45:12,676 --> 01:45:14,081
No, I don't.

1036
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:17,905
Cruel means Dolly.

1037
01:45:22,499 --> 01:45:26,200
If anything happens to my brother...
- I won't do anything.

1038
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:28,079
I will shoot him on his forehead.

1039
01:45:28,417 --> 01:45:31,605
Sir...
- Your brother is dead.

1040
01:45:33,037 --> 01:45:34,684
What happened?

1041
01:46:05,948 --> 01:46:07,840
Boys say that he killed
my brother right in front of them.

1042
01:46:11,272 --> 01:46:13,069
The police report says that

1043
01:46:14,676 --> 01:46:16,541
he was released at the inn.

1044
01:46:18,242 --> 01:46:19,769
He should die, Chitte.

1045
01:46:22,094 --> 01:46:23,471
Shiva should die.

1046
01:46:24,405 --> 01:46:26,864
You ask the department to enquire me?

1047
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:30,404
How dare you? It was I who
killed your brother in an encounter.

1048
01:46:30,674 --> 01:46:34,146
I disposed his body in the junkyard.
The corporation took the body

1049
01:46:34,349 --> 01:46:35,658
to Victoria Hospital
since it was unclaimed.

1050
01:46:35,738 --> 01:46:36,997
Get it released if you have the guts.

1051
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:42,767
Sorry, you won't be alive to see his body.

1052
01:46:43,389 --> 01:46:45,023
Sir!

1053
01:47:03,343 --> 01:47:05,573
Hello. Untie him.

1054
01:47:07,842 --> 01:47:09,909
I am ending this with your brother death.

1055
01:47:10,301 --> 01:47:14,611
You, Chitte and your men,
all of you better mend your ways

1056
01:47:15,246 --> 01:47:17,772
otherwise, I won't spare you.

1057
01:48:11,948 --> 01:48:14,610
Hello. What happened to your phone?

1058
01:48:15,123 --> 01:48:17,960
I am unable to reach you,
you have switched it off. - Sorry.

1059
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:21,068
It got switched off because
I didn't charge it. Please come.

1060
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:24,500
Why are you dull? What happened?

1061
01:48:26,203 --> 01:48:28,823
My sister and I had a fight.

1062
01:48:29,067 --> 01:48:31,417
Why?
- It was my sister's birthday yesterday.

1063
01:48:32,525 --> 01:48:34,349
I called to wish her.

1064
01:48:36,916 --> 01:48:38,767
Hello.
- Hi, Suma.

1065
01:48:40,617 --> 01:48:43,104
Hello. Sister, can you hear me?

1066
01:48:43,414 --> 01:48:46,588
Hello.
- Sister Panchami...

1067
01:48:46,668 --> 01:48:49,223
Vasu, why are you snatching the phone?
- Give it to me.

1068
01:48:52,736 --> 01:48:55,938
Hi.
- Hey! Did you call to enquire?

1069
01:48:56,018 --> 01:48:59,423
Vasu, I called Suma to surprise you.

1070
01:48:59,503 --> 01:49:03,206
Surprise? You doubt me, don't you.
You don't trust me. - Vasu, stop it.

1071
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:05,341
"Happy birthday to me."

1072
01:49:05,421 --> 01:49:07,435
What's wrong with you?
- I don't need anyone's sympathy, okay?

1073
01:49:07,515 --> 01:49:11,555
Do you want to give me a surprise call?

1074
01:49:12,758 --> 01:49:15,082
Don't dry. Calm down.

1075
01:49:16,757 --> 01:49:19,487
I don't need anybody. I will die.

1076
01:49:19,729 --> 01:49:21,986
Don't talk like that.

1077
01:49:22,202 --> 01:49:25,444
From whom should I live? I lost my parents

1078
01:49:26,106 --> 01:49:28,727
all I have is my sister

1079
01:49:29,052 --> 01:49:33,145
but she does drugs.
I will commit suicide.

1080
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:36,456
If you talk like this again,
I will slap you.

1081
01:49:36,726 --> 01:49:39,495
Everyone has problems.

1082
01:49:40,662 --> 01:49:42,737
Face it with courage. I am sorry.

1083
01:49:44,332 --> 01:49:47,223
Did you eat food? Did you eat anything?

1084
01:49:49,628 --> 01:49:52,316
If something happens to you, I...

1085
01:49:52,843 --> 01:49:55,004
No, please don't do that.

1086
01:49:55,476 --> 01:49:58,003
Look, I have work in the police station

1087
01:49:58,328 --> 01:50:00,678
I will finish it and come,
let's go to dinner.

1088
01:50:01,408 --> 01:50:03,421
Yours is not a problem at all.

1089
01:50:03,638 --> 01:50:06,502
It can be solved.
I will come with you to Manipal.

1090
01:50:06,854 --> 01:50:08,353
Let's convince her and bring her back.

1091
01:50:08,609 --> 01:50:09,961
I will talk to her.

1092
01:50:13,771 --> 01:50:15,446
You don't call at this hour.

1093
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:18,053
What's the matter?
- I feel shy

1094
01:50:19,026 --> 01:50:21,243
but I will still tell you.
Listen to me.

1095
01:50:21,323 --> 01:50:23,525
Please don't interrupt when I am talking.

1096
01:50:23,605 --> 01:50:26,133
I won't repeat.
- Okay, tell me.

1097
01:50:27,808 --> 01:50:31,780
I...

1098
01:50:32,524 --> 01:50:35,280
Your colleague ACP Shiva

1099
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,753
I have decided to marry him.

1100
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:41,549
Good news. I found a reason
to have a couple of drinks more.

1101
01:50:44,196 --> 01:50:45,521
Thanks, uncle.

1102
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:38,898
Jack, check if he is alive.
If he is alive, kill him.

1103
01:52:44,086 --> 01:52:45,897
He is dead.

1104
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:24,481
Shiva and I have no elders

1105
01:53:24,684 --> 01:53:28,021
so, you must get us both married.

1106
01:53:37,046 --> 01:53:38,938
It is be confidential.

1107
01:53:39,018 --> 01:53:41,383
If people find out that
a policeman was shot at

1108
01:53:41,463 --> 01:53:43,356
it will bring a bad
name to the department.

1109
01:53:53,462 --> 01:53:55,204
Where is Panchami?

1110
01:54:08,552 --> 01:54:10,106
Did they kill her?

1111
01:54:10,741 --> 01:54:13,497
Look, I burnt my hand
while performing veneration.

1112
01:54:13,577 --> 01:54:17,590
Allow God to rest.
- It's a minor burn but hurts so much.

1113
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:20,665
When I think about people
who light them up

1114
01:54:20,745 --> 01:54:23,712
with petrol and kerosene
I get very scared.

1115
01:54:23,792 --> 01:54:25,764
I am scared of fire.

1116
01:54:28,617 --> 01:54:32,980
Panchami is scared of fire.

1117
01:54:39,154 --> 01:54:40,546
Hello, Tagaru Shiva.

1118
01:54:40,626 --> 01:54:43,599
I waited that you would
profess your love to me

1119
01:54:44,005 --> 01:54:45,735
no chance.

1120
01:54:46,032 --> 01:54:48,247
The way you expressed
your love for me is different.

1121
01:54:48,327 --> 01:54:53,016
If you talk about dying again,
I will kill you.

1122
01:54:54,016 --> 01:54:55,746
You don't want anything
to happen to me, right?

1123
01:54:55,825 --> 01:54:59,691
Tagaru is very arrogant,
but his heart is like a child.

1124
01:54:59,935 --> 01:55:02,988
Shall I tell you my favourite song?

1125
01:55:03,514 --> 01:55:08,757
"What if the colours of the life change?"

1126
01:55:10,377 --> 01:55:15,106
Okay, see the video and call me.
Okay, bye.

1127
01:56:50,083 --> 01:56:51,920
Injustice has happened to Panchami.

1128
01:56:54,406 --> 01:56:57,878
If they think they can
live messing with the police,

1129
01:56:59,432 --> 01:57:01,404
they are wrong.

1130
01:57:02,282 --> 01:57:04,497
If we go according to the law,

1131
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,402
it will be too late.

1132
01:57:07,821 --> 01:57:10,023
Shiva, don't stay quiet.

1133
01:57:11,794 --> 01:57:14,982
Shiva Kumar, what brings you here?
- Sir, you're not as calm as you look.

1134
01:57:15,062 --> 01:57:16,927
No, I am calm.

1135
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:20,832
I'm a police man and
I know you are not calm.

1136
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:28,573
Your political filth
has fallen on my uniform,

1137
01:57:29,533 --> 01:57:31,302
I am feeling dirty.

1138
01:57:32,681 --> 01:57:34,755
Elders have told that

1139
01:57:34,835 --> 01:57:37,248
you shouldn't even leave your slippers
in the place where you're not respected.

1140
01:57:38,558 --> 01:57:42,842
Sir, it is better to salute lovingly
rather than forcing yourself to do it.

1141
01:57:43,233 --> 01:57:45,800
I shall leave now.
- Shiva Kumar, please have a seat.

1142
01:57:46,098 --> 01:57:50,043
You can do anything you want.
Your signal will be clear.

1143
01:57:50,354 --> 01:57:53,015
You won't have any
political pressure on you.

1144
01:57:56,177 --> 01:57:57,919
You do your work.

1145
01:58:12,538 --> 01:58:18,185
Sir, Dolly is not here.
There's no one linked to Dolly here.

1146
01:58:19,766 --> 01:58:22,658
Hello, is Panchami there?
- No, she is not here.

1147
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:25,792
What's the matter?
- Sir, we're in Goa.

1148
01:58:25,872 --> 01:58:28,157
The police has arrested her sister.

1149
01:58:28,236 --> 01:58:31,534
Will you please tell this to her sister?
- Okay, I'll do it.

1150
01:58:33,804 --> 01:58:35,912
Call the Goa DCP, D'Souza.

1151
02:02:04,189 --> 02:02:07,580
Are you with the men who would
form a group when they hear gun sound?

1152
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:12,188
Have a look properly,
I am holding a sword in my hand.

1153
02:02:12,268 --> 02:02:14,051
Hey, this is a gun.

1154
02:02:16,295 --> 02:02:21,604
That's all. It will take me
just 2 seconds to shoot and kill you.

1155
02:02:21,982 --> 02:02:26,306
But I don't wish to give the credit
of your death to this gun or bullet.

1156
02:02:27,319 --> 02:02:31,980
I want to kill you myself.

1157
02:02:32,304 --> 02:02:35,020
I want to make you
understand what death is.

1158
02:05:45,708 --> 02:05:49,112
Dad! - What is it? - I told you that
I have a cricket match tonight.

1159
02:05:49,315 --> 02:05:51,395
Look, he's going in the bike at this hour.

1160
02:05:51,475 --> 02:05:53,774
Where are you going?
- Mom, I have a match tonight.

1161
02:05:53,854 --> 02:05:57,056
Come and have dinner.
- Mom, you have. I am getting late.

1162
02:05:57,136 --> 02:06:00,217
Be careful.
- Dad, it's my friend's birthday,

1163
02:06:00,297 --> 02:06:03,190
we're going out for dinner.
I will come late by 10:30.

1164
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:06,148
Be careful. Come soon.
- Okay, Dad.

1165
02:06:15,158 --> 02:06:17,414
I am wearing sister's sari. Is it okay?

1166
02:06:21,063 --> 02:06:24,373
You don't compliment me.
You look good in the uniform.

1167
02:06:24,631 --> 02:06:26,319
Shall I take a selfie?

1168
02:06:28,427 --> 02:06:31,210
Come, let's go to the temple. Come on.

1169
02:06:31,724 --> 02:06:33,764
Okay, I'll go myself. Bye.

1170
02:06:34,805 --> 02:06:37,480
Listen, be careful.

1171
02:06:39,371 --> 02:06:42,384
Sir, should we tell someone
to 'be careful' when you're around?

1172
02:06:43,317 --> 02:06:45,667
Is our society so bad?

1173
02:06:46,329 --> 02:06:49,099
We tell others to be careful
even when they go to the temple.

1174
02:07:12,607 --> 02:07:14,553
Are you here?
- Yes.

1175
02:07:16,390 --> 02:07:18,268
Keep the gun down.

1176
02:07:18,944 --> 02:07:20,659
Have you brought the money?

1177
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:25,645
You have asked for home delivery of death.
