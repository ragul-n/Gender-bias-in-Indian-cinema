"No one will bother to come down...'

177
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,440
"...if you guys don't play at Navlatri".

178
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,776
That song you guys
played on Gaupati festival.

179
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,369
Absolutely wonderful.

180
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,907
People are just dying
to shower money on you.

181
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,706
And now you demand double the fee.

182
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,605
I meaumyou guys charge double
if the client comes himself.

183
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,436
This isn't right.

184
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,411
Life gives you two choices.

185
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,409
'Either take whatever you get...'

186
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:39,343
'...ol...snatch what you like.'

187
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,608
Now, you decide.

188
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,944
I Want double.

189
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,541
It's flue.

190
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,210
See you.

191
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,445
How are you?

192
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,477
Please talk to him.

193
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,370
He's asking fol double the fees.

194
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,639
Why double?

195
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,474
We're just getting in demand.

196
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,769
That's exactly Why
We can demand double.

197
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,868
Say What?

198
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,669
You won't understand just yet.

199
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,210
I will when you're
old enough to understand.

200
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,406
Unbelievable, Tataat. Amazing.

201
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:16,313
What did you understand?
- I didn't...

202
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,541
But if Tania! is saying it,
it must he right.

203
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,340
Right...

204
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,713
I've been trying to explain you for
thlee days, do I look crazy to you'?

205
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,770
Can't you listen. . .01
you don't want to listen?

206
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,211
You go...you must be getting late.

207
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,313
Don't forget to call
after you reach, please.

208
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,511
Don't Worry, mom.
It's only fol a few days...

209
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,442
...and everything's been taken care of.

210
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,904
But he careful,

211
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:53,146
Mulnbai is a really nice place,
and so are its people.

212
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,611
But not everyone's too nice.

213
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,107
Gotya.
- Yeah.

214
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,339
How did I play?

215
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,270
Simply amazing.

216
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:23,207
But if you could play
a little better, then...

217
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,674
Then What?

218
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,313
You think Tania! plays hetlel than me.

219
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,409
That's not What I meant, but...

220
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,074
He took the Gaupati gig as Well.

221
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,710
It's just his good luck.

222
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,612
But soon 0111 time will change.

223
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,313
The biggest 'Navratri'
gig is 0111s after all.

224
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,136
Where will they go'?

225
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,612
Pakya...
- Yeah.

226
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,476
We lost the 'Navlatri' gig as Well.

227
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,569
They hooked Tania! and
his hand fol double the late.

228
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:53,643
What?

229
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,509
Boss...Double!

230
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,669
Tataat! Tataat! Tataat!

231
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,376
Bloody Iascals been
s**** me all the time.

232
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,103
I feel like strangling
the life out of him.

233
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:10,045
This time...I'm going to play
like no one's seen ol heard hefole.

234
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,410
Just let the festivals begin.

235
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,610
Mom, I've leached Mumhai.

236
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,044
It's so colorful.

237
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,735
Hey...

238
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,404
How many times have I told you...

239
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,070
".110! to pickup money with your mouth.

240
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,078
Shame, don't come.'

241
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,643
This is exactly why
people think we're beggars.

242
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,610
Does anyone tell the dllllllll. player
to pickup n1oney from the mouth'?

243
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,703
Does anyone tell a
Harmonium playel to do it?

244
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:16,313
This is Why I am ashamed to
tell anyone that I play the Banjo.

245
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,476
Sit. . .you_t order'?

246
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,477
Wasn't one enough?

247
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,072
Give it to him.
- Thank you.

248
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,941
Remember why you asked double charge?

249
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,305
So listen...

250
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,611
Half fol playing the banjo...

251
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,644
...and the other half
for the humiliation.

252
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,308
We're not going to get
any respect in this lifetime.

253
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,180
So Why don't We charge
double and make some extra money.

254
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,576
What say...

255
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,002
You're right, Talaat.

256
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,447
I didn't understand,
but since Talaafs saying"

257
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,638
...it must he right...

258
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:12,207
Hey wise-guy... trying to show-off
because you are paid double.

259
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,269
Life gives you two choices.

260
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,010
EiLhel you punch him in the them...

261
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,882
...ol you earn double of what
he does and punch him in the guts.

262
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,978
Come on.

263
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,638
"Round. . .Iou_nd. . . The world's round. "

264
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,405
"Carefree. . JSBIGIEGG. . .

00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:25,379
"We have all the fun We Want."

269
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,903
"We get drunk and dance around."

270
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,915
"We get drunk and dance around."

271
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,875
"We dupe the World..."

272
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:40,540
...and show them where it stands."

273
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,043
"We get drunk and dance around."

274
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,912
"We get drunk and dance around."

275
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:22,010
"We're a bit crooked...
and a bit different."

276
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:25,879
"We wander around on deserted
streets leaving out homes."

277
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:33,210
"We're a bit crooked...
and a bit different."

278
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:36,407
"We wander around on deserted
streets leaving out homes."

279
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:40,813
"Whoever tries to act smart..."

280
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:42,540
"We smack him..."

281
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,245
"We smack him...good."

282
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,208
"But whenever people clap...fol us."

283
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:52,340
"We give a big smile."

284
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,109
"We get drunk and dance around."

285
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:59,842
"We get drunk and dance around."

286
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,875
"We dupe the World..."

287
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:07,813
"wand show him Whele it stands."

288
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,076
"We get drunk and dance around."

289
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:14,910
"We get drunk and dance around."

290
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,871
5000 rupees...fron1 airport to here.

291
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,304
It happens.

292
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,006
This usually happens
with foreigners here.

293
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,247
Happened with me, too.

294
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,507
By the way,
the thing you were looking for.

295
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,145
The posters.
- Thank you very much.

296
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,846
Superb!

297
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,072
Well... at least there was
one good thing about you: trip.

298
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,806
Thank you very much.

299
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:04,771
Now can We discuss the plan?
- Ah, plan.

300
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:10,043
So basically, this Banjo
is a very unorganized sector.

301
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,304
There's no concept as
a professional 'Banjo' player.

302
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,806
Slulns. . . hutnlents. . . you will
find these people over there.

303
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:20,847
Basically,
amidst 40% of Mumhafs public.

304
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,941
Like finding coal in the dark.

305
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,368
Are you prep are d'?

306
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,771
Tm!

307
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:26,909
Slums in the city...

308
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,914
mate just like disease in 0111 body.

309
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,745
And even if that's not true...

310
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,741
...then you must show it that way.

311
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,369
Ex agg crate!

312
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,177
What happened?

313
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,243
What?

314
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,308
No need to get so emotional.

315
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,604
Afiel all we're running
a Research Agency.

316
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,172
We need to do these things.

317
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,334
You know"

318
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,910
Switch that off.

319
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,602
Lights, please.

320
00:23:58,833 --> 00:23:59,709
Lord...

321
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,273
So... the Bulani Builders...

322
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,208
Who's going to say 'no' to them'?

323
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,940
They need a report
against these slums...

324
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:10,168
...so We'll give them one.

325
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,010
Yeah

326
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,234
Excuse me.

327
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,235
I am Chris.

328
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,601
Chris.

329
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,035
That's just wonderful.

330
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:27,612
So... you all can leave.

331
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,041
Leave...go..go..go...

332
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,103
Quickly

333
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,110
Yeah...

334
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,778
Come on...

335
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,578
Chris.

336
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,741
I am Mama's fiiend.
- Meela who?

337
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,312

338
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,178
I was supposed to meet you today.

339
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:56,541

340
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,080
How's Meela?

341
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,240

Oh...you were supposed to meet n1e at 10.

343

Yeah, actually What happen is that...

344
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,878
I don't know What Meela said to you...

345
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:14,909
...but you won't get any free help here.

346
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,169
You will have to give
something in return.

347
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,671
No.. no... it's not What you think.

348
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,771
You're like my daughteL.

349
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,538
"But you're not my daughter.

350
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,510
M6618. said...you want
to find the Banjo guys.

351
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,941
Fine... you can do you: job...

Just close your eyes and
do the job you've been given.

01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,907
But they can get one chance.

1068
01:17:36,467 --> 01:17:39,937
They can...but only to her.

1069
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,881
Look sunshine, its business.

1070
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:48,714
You've credentials,
which works for n16.

1071
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,940
You've a presence, Wolks fol me.

1072
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:58,279
And you are... beautiful.

1073
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:02,640
And that definitely Wolks fol me.

1074
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:08,677
But this 'Banjo' doesn't work for n16.

1075
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,811
Come solo...then we'll
give these guys a chance.

1076
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,937
Sorry MI. Nair, but we're a band.

1077
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:24,780
And We perform as a hand.
- Then What can I say?

1078
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,676
Hey What...I']I tell you What?

1079
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,702
I'll let you all know, yeah.

1080
01:18:30,901 --> 01:18:34,474
But quite honesflymyoul
chances are late.

1081
01:18:34,534 --> 01:18:37,811
How much'?
- 5 percent.

1082
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,638
I came from New York
to India on O percent.

1083
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:49,342
So 5 percent...is not that bad.
Thank you.

1084
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,210
Nice.

1085
01:19:19,767 --> 01:19:22,270
I guess your smile's missing.

1086
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:27,541
There are other things
in life other than rnusic.

1087
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:29,576
But this is the only thing I have.

1088
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:32,577
In fact, it should he fol you too.

1089
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:38,313
Itnagine...fi_tst time we won't
be playing someone else's music.

1090
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:39,775
It will he 0111 song.

1091
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,973
You need this stage.

1092
01:19:44,567 --> 01:19:47,741
Life... gives you two choices, madam.

1093
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,479
Either you keep abusing life...

1094
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:56,411
...ol embrace the life that you have.

1095
01:19:57,634 --> 01:19:58,738
Meaning?

1096
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:00,939
Mean-iJ18--'

1097
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,879
You know...I don't have a father.

1098
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:10,210
So I got myself a
father... who needed a son.

1099
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:12,344
When I couldn't have a home...

1100
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,438
...I made the sky my roof,
and the footpath my bed.

1101
01:20:24,334 --> 01:20:27,611
Tell me something...
do you have a gillfiiend.

1102
01:20:28,334 --> 01:20:29,506
Gillfriend?

1103
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:32,444
Who will say yes to me?

1104
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,438
Why'? You're so nice.

1105
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,501
Who's going to say no?

1106
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:37,505
What kind of a gill
are you looking fol?

1107
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:38,409
Tell me.

1108
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,470
We'll find you a girlfriend.

1109
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,408
Tell me...what's your type?

1110
01:20:44,634 --> 01:20:47,672
Anyone. . innocent and nave...

1111
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:50,904
Like you.

1112
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:53,936
Like me? - Yeah...

1113
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,274
A gill like n1e will never
make a good girlfriend.

1114
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:01,677
My dlealns are more important
than my relationships,

1115
01:21:05,134 --> 01:21:06,477
I don't know much, madam...

1116
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,473
But I do know...when
two lives become one...

1117
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,612
"Alley even have the same dleam.

1118
01:21:15,734 --> 01:21:17,714
If I ever have a situation
like this with my gillfiriend...

1119
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:20,378
...I']1 never interfere with her drearns.

1120
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,339
In fact, I'll tell her...

1121
01:21:23,334 --> 01:21:27,305
"If you Want to fly...I']I
he your airplane."

1122
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,543
"If you Want to
sWim...I']I he your ship."

1123
01:21:32,467 --> 01:21:35,380
If she wants to faJ1...I
will never stop her.

1124
01:21:35,767 --> 01:21:36,802
In fact...

1125
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:38,811
You know that thingulike an umbrella.

1126
01:21:39,367 --> 01:21:40,345
Parachute.

1127
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,378
Yes...

1128
01:21:41,767 --> 01:21:43,678
I'll be her parachute.

1129
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,806
If she's sleepy, I'll be her pillow...

1130
01:21:47,367 --> 01:21:49,779
If not. . .I']1 be her lullaby.

1131
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,674
Maybe I said too much.

1132
01:21:56,067 --> 01:21:57,512
But I am not exaggemting.

1133
01:21:59,567 --> 01:22:04,448
I'll tell her... "Just
follow you: dlealns".

1134
01:22:06,434 --> 01:22:11,406
And whenever she looks back...she
will find n1e standing there.

1135
01:22:45,534 --> 01:22:47,172

1136
01:22:47,234 --> 01:22:48,269

1138
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:55,538
God has answered our prayers.

1139
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,637

1140
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,644

Tatya, send the boys with the stuff.

1144
01:23:17,234 --> 01:23:19,009
We've l0 days to decide.

1145
01:23:19,334 --> 01:23:24,408
What can We say to him? - I

Just one song.

1594
01:53:30,967 --> 01:53:33,345
You're wasting you: time, madam.

1595
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,507
You're talking about wasting time.

And now y0u'Ie asking
me to forget that.

1600
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,307
Leave this right here.

1601
01:53:57,767 --> 01:54:01,806
Honestly speaking...
you should've never come here.

1602
01:54:04,201 --> 01:54:09,378
I was Wonderingmhow can
such good things happen with us?

01:54:10,634 --> 01:54:13,615
How can 0111 dleams

1604
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,270
I was scared.

1605
01:54:16,467 --> 01:54:18,743
But. . .everything's fine now.

1606
01:54:19,634 --> 01:54:22,513
Thismthis is 0111 life.

1607

Seemoul had luck has
rubbed-off on you too.

1608
01:54:37,501 --> 01:54:39,708
Life doesn't always
give two choices, madam.

1609
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,277

01:55:01,534 --> 01:55:03,741
But one day you will realize...

1614
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,610

You see this...

1617
01:55:19,234 --> 01:55:22,181
A gleat musician once gave me this.

1618
01:55:22,234 --> 01:55:25,477
Because he saw a
true artist inside me.

1619
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,574
And today I am going
to give it to you.

1623
01:56:14,134 --> 01:56:17,343

<i>" "hound me in u chain."</i>

1625

"There's darkness before my eyes."

1628
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:34,107
"Why is the dawn upset with me?"

1629
01:56:34,401 --> 01:56:40,113
"Was that colorful
rainbow just an illusion?"

1630
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:46,413
"Lord...what kind of blessing
in disguise is this?"

1631
01:56:47,034 --> 01:56:53,246
"Lord...what kind of blessing

<i>He's my boy.</i>

1638
01:57:29,967 --> 01:57:32,470
When he bent down to touch my feet...

1640

'...ale now buried under tombs."

1644

"Why my dlealns have
shattered to pieces?"

1645
01:58:26,167 --> 01:58:29,307
"Pain has sought refuge in my heart?"

1646
01:58:29,367 --> 01:58:32,280
"But your image hasn't faded away."

1647
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:38,350
"How do I keep my promise
with a broken heart?"

1648
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:45,215
"Lord...what kind of blessing

Forgive me.

1659
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,143
I made a big mistake.

1660
02:00:53,334 --> 02:00:55,245
How can I forget everything?

1661
02:00:57,201 --> 02:01:00,011

1663
02:01:06,067 --> 02:01:08,741
And the things I said
to you in a fit of rage.

1664
02:01:09,101 --> 02:01:12,082
And I hit you too.

1665
02:01:13,867 --> 02:01:18,043
'I shall not give horn...and
direct do accident with you.'

1666
02:01:20,834 --> 02:01:22,370
And all these problems.

1667
02:01:23,301 --> 02:01:24,780
Chris...

1668
02:01:25,334 --> 02:01:26,836

You can apologies if you like.

1672

But enough with your English.

1673
02:01:45,467 --> 02:01:48,971
I am so happy...so happy...

1674
02:01:49,034 --> 02:01:52,846
Like someone kept 8 buckets
full of water outside my house.

02:02:01,767 --> 02:02:03,110
Come on.

1679
02:02:04,867 --> 02:02:06,710
You must speak up...

1680
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:08,670
Who those guys were'?

1681
02:02:09,134 --> 02:02:10,272
Where can we find them'?

1682
02:02:10,334 --> 02:02:11,438
Sneak up and"

1683
02:02:18,067 --> 02:02:19,341
Sit, can I speak fol a minute?

1684
02:02:25,434 --> 02:02:29,712
Sorry. I exchanged those boxes.

1685
02:02:31,367 --> 02:02:34,075
I wished you
I Wanted to exceed you.

1686
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:38,039
I got one chance to do it
and pounced on it without thinking.

1687
02:02:38,734 --> 02:02:41,874
But honestly. . .I didn't
want such bad things for you.

1688
02:02:44,967 --> 02:02:47,140
Whenever I used to
see you play the Banjo...

1689
02:02:47,801 --> 02:02:49,872
...it would make me jealous,
it would he painful fol me.

1690
02:02:50,767 --> 02:02:55,273
But...now when you don't play
the Banjo...it pains even more.

1691
02:02:56,667 --> 02:02:58,010
Then I understood.

1692
02:02:58,934 --> 02:03:01,608
My victory isn't in
taking your Banjo away.

1693
02:03:02,368 --> 02:03:04,814
It's in defeating you
like a true Banjo player.

1694
02:03:07,801 --> 02:03:09,906
So I returned you: Banjo.

1695
02:03:11,034 --> 02:03:12,604
Go on, play.

1696
02:03:13,234 --> 02:03:15,805
If you stop play,
who is going to be my competitor'?

1697
02:03:17,134 --> 02:03:18,807

1698

And I sWealml will defeat you.

1701
02:03:31,134 --> 02:03:32,169
See you.

1702
02:03:32,334 --> 02:03:34,041
If that's true, then...

1703
02:03:38,167 --> 02:03:39,612
Take this with you.

1704
02:03:40,301 --> 02:03:42,144
Someone gave this to me once.

1705
02:03:42,901 --> 02:03:46,041
She said then-is a
true Banjo playel in me.

1706
02:03:47,967 --> 02:03:50,675
For the filst time I
saw a Banjo player in you.

1707
02:03:53,101 --> 02:03:54,239
This is fol that.

1708
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,570
Forgive me.

1709
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,009
Forgive me.

1710
02:04:23,567 --> 02:04:25,103
Chris was right.

1711
02:04:25,734 --> 02:04:28,146
We earned more money with her.

1712
02:04:28,867 --> 02:04:31,040
And we never played for money.

1713
02:04:32,801 --> 02:04:34,678
She Wanted to make one mole song.

1714
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:38,139
And she thought We could
make a song on 0111 own.

1715
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:41,912
And We will make that song.

1716
02:04:42,667 --> 02:04:45,807
