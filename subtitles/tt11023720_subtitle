1
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,499
Move!

2
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:23,972
Move!

3
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:27,638
It's a murder, sir.

4
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,666
Yes, sir.
No idea.

5
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,049
Okay, sir.

6
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:36,682
He is Simhadri Naidu.

7
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,958
There is a monster in every era.

8
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,951
He's the demon Bakasur for Kurnool.

9
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,387
He makes Kurnool quake
in fear with just a look.

10
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:47,062
He tortures people with
the support of politicians.

11
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,317
That's how he turned
into a financial power.

12
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:52,417
Simhadri Naidu's goal
is to loot billions of rupees..

13
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,478
..and become an invincible
political power.

14
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,814
Anybody that stands
against him tastes death.

15
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:07,942
Good morning, sir.

16
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:12,894
There was a murder at Kondareddy Fort.

17
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:13,860
Yes, sir.

18
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:17,280
File a case that Varalaxmi
committed the murder.

19
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,522
But she didn't commit that murder.

20
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,499
She has a good name with people.

21
00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:25,497
We need solid evidence
to file a case against her.

22
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:27,283
Then create solid evidence.

23
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:30,310
Got it, sir.

24
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,078
Long live Varalaxmi!

25
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,004
Long live Varalaxmi!

26
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,703
Long live Varalaxmi!

27
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,730
Long live Varalaxmi!

28
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,534
Long live Varalaxmi!

29
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,508
She is Varalaxmi Devi.

30
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,965
A successful industrialist
in Kurnool district.

31
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:47,336
Varalaxmi knows no failures
in business, only successes.

32
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,524
Every time people are
faced with a problem..

33
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,682
..they look to Varalaxmi
for a solution.

34
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,375
Everyone receives help
from her in one way or the other.

35
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,547
Everyone joins their
hands in respect before her.

36
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:57,924
Simhadri Naidu is
afraid that Varalaxmi's..

37
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:01,611
..growing popularity will
be a political obstacle for him.

38
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,444
That's why he framed
her in this murder case.

39
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,218
Varalaxmi!

40
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:18,591
I did nothing wrong.
Justice is on my side.

41
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:21,131
No harm will come to me
as long as I have your support.

42
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,820
Let the police do their duty.

43
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,675
- This is unfair, dear.
- I'll be fine, Mom.

44
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,654
Police! Down, down!

45
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:33,196
Police! Down, down!

46
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,287
Move! Give way!

47
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,789
This is injustice!

48
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:43,852
Move!

49
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:50,082
I'll do that right away.

50
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:51,357
- Bhavani!
- Yes, ma'am.

51
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:53,750
Arrange for me to meet
the lawyer right now.

52
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:54,564
Okay, ma'am.

53
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:05,405
Hello, madam!

54
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:07,776
Hello!

55
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:09,989
Don't worry. I heard what happened.

56
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,863
Every person in this district,
including me..

57
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:15,507
..knows how good Varalaxmi madam is.

58
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,436
It is my responsibility
to prove her innocence.

59
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,775
The man who died, Bhupal..

60
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:23,174
..joined as my daughter's
PA three months ago.

61
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,697
Someone murdered him last night.

62
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:30,899
I'm sure someone is trying
to falsely frame my daughter.

63
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,703
Please save her.

64
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:34,461
Don't worry.

65
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,804
There is no other lawyer in Kurnool..

66
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:40,330
..that can get Varalaxmi
out of this mess.

67
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:53,305
Tenali Ramakrishna. BA. BL.

68
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:56,222
Upto 50% off on every case.

69
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,625
100% cash-back if the case is lost.

70
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,617
Please give me cases.

71
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:04,486
Give me one case,
I will fight the second one for free.

72
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,514
- Tenali!
- Yes?

73
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,721
Even South India Shopping
Mall doesn't have..

74
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:13,121
..so many offers.
I know you are smarter than me.

75
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:16,167
Even I get a few cases,
why don't you get any?

76
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:19,827
Our innocent public doesn't know the..

77
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:21,863
..difference between
valuable and worthless things.

78
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:23,691
So, it will take some
time for them to understand it.

79
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:24,777
My time will come.

80
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,569
Why are you so confident?
Did you get a case?

81
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:29,956
- Yeah.
- Which one?

82
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:32,848
The case of water pots.

83
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,802
You are talking as if it's
the case of buried treasures.

84
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:46,824
A mighty mango tree grows
from a humble mango seed.

85
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:49,423
But some seeds remain seeds forever.

86
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,482
I have a strong feeling
that you are going to get hurt.

87
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:53,556
Be careful.

88
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,647
Okay.

89
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,622
Here comes my client.

90
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,621
Oh no!

91
00:07:58,815 --> 00:07:59,631
Why did he stop there?

92
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,513
Oh no, he saw me.

93
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:04,630
He's leaving. Sir! Sir! Sir!

94
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,331
Why are you running away..

95
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:07,929
..like Vijay Mallya
runs from bank authorities?

96
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,254
We should file the case today.

97
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:10,728
I hired another lawyer.

98
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,411
Why did you do that?

99
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:16,211
I changed my decision
while taking bath this morning.

100
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:18,528
It's not underwear to change
every time you take bath.

101
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:21,350
And you don't look like
a man who wears underwear.

102
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,115
Who is this man?
He looks blacker than the black coat.

103
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:25,994
- Is he a peon here?
- How dare you!

104
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:27,956
Calm down. Let me handle it.

105
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:31,866
Sir, don't underestimate
me because I'm young.

106
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,119
Nobody can beat me in an argument.

107
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:34,458
When I talk about law points..

108
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,749
..the opponent will pee in his pants.

109
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,390
Once I step inside the court hall,
the judge..

110
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:42,013
..has no option but to
give the verdict in my favor.

111
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:42,855
I don't want you.

112
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,230
Don't worry about the fee.
My friend has many offers.

113
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:46,865
If you give him one case..

114
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,062
..he'll fight the second
case free of charge.

115
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,315
If you use Paytm to pay him..

116
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,361
..I have 50% cash-back offer.

117
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,174
And if he loses the case..

118
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,633
..I've 100% cash-back offer.

119
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,627
Maybe that's why you
don't have any cases.

120
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:59,602
- You'll definitely win.
- Thank you.

121
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:02,082
Since you refused to give
this case to Tenali Ramakrishna..

122
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,530
..you'll definitely win.

123
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:05,848
You should never give a
car to someone who can't drive..

124
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,772
..and a case to someone
who can't prove a point.

125
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:09,877
Meet this lawyer.
He is Gutti Gurunadham.

126
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:10,429
- Hello.
- Hello.

127
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,845
He's the perfect lawyer for your case.

128
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,610
I trust you,
so I'll entrust my case to him..

129
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:15,641
..instead of giving it to Tenali.

130
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,171
You'll have to pay 4,000
as a fee to fight your case.

131
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:19,717
Of course.

132
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,840
Please come to my office in the evening.

133
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,091
Okay. See you later.

134
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:23,033
- Raju!
- Yes?

135
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:25,509
Don't tell anyone that I made
you take your case back from Tenali.

136
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,816
Why will I tell anyone?

137
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,943
Good.

138
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,610
My commission is 2,000 rupees.

139
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,885
He paid me 4,000 and you want 2,000 as commission?

140
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:32,543
Yes.

141
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,718
I think brokers are
earning more than lawyers.

142
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,525
Don't call me a broker.
It sounds cheap.

143
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,782
Just call me bro.

144
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:39,855
Whatever. Here, take 500 rupees.

145
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:42,055
Just 500?
Even beggars will not accept it.

146
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:43,652
It's more than you deserve.

147
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:45,710
What a useless life!

148
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:48,729
I've a bad headache.
Order a cup of strong tea.

149
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:49,705
Okay?

150
00:09:50,294 --> 00:09:52,755
When will I get cases?
When will I win them?

151
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,448
When will I be a successful lawyer?

152
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,170
"A delicate flower
petal has slit my throat"

153
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:21,164
"A sweet drop of milk has drowned me"

154
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:24,741
"This euphoric feeling is new to me"

155
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,436
"This magic is strange to me"

156
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,432
Hello! Excuse me!

157
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:31,553
Wow!

158
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:34,631
"A delicate flower
petal has slit my throat"

159
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:38,931
"A sweet drop of milk has drowned me"

160
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:42,450
Just a few seconds.
I'll see you and go away.

161
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:43,790
What?

162
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,858
I'm sure God added
some medicine to your face.

163
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,979
When I look at you
my whole body de-stresses..

164
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,920
..as if all the pending cases
in the court were given verdicts.

165
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,492
Hello, mister!
What do you think of us?

166
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:57,438
She looks like a juicy hybrid tomato.

167
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,462
What about me?

168
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,190
You look like a gluttonous customer..

169
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,108
..waiting to receive
a food parcel from Zomato.

170
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,959
Hello! You know nothing about me.

171
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:09,032
I've a goal, a life ambition.

172
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,828
I want to win one case after another,
one after another..

173
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,836
..and become a Lady Ram Jethmalani.

174
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,804
- Right?
- Right.

175
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:21,539
You too. Stop flirting with
girls and try to be a good lawyer.

176
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:22,945
Okay? Bye, mister!

177
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:26,804
Don't call me mister.
I'm Tenali Ramakrishna. BA. BL.

178
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,255
I don't flirt with all girls.
Just you.

179
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:37,803
Savitri! I heard that your
son doesn't have a single case.

180
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,606
Why are you always talking
bad about my brother?

181
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,036
I just asked because that's
what everyone is saying.

182
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:47,085
Does your son really
need a lawyer's job?

183
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,760
What do you mean by that?

184
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:51,874
We know how hard my father
worked to make him a lawyer.

185
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:53,740
You'll see. My brother will
be very successful very soon.

186
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,595
Mom, wait.

187
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,783
You don't have to carry it.

188
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:05,624
Come on.

189
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:06,966
What about your scooter?

190
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,245
Who will take it?

191
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:09,560
I'll be right back. Love you.

192
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,372
Did you get any case?

193
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:12,637
No, Mom.

194
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:16,816
I suspect that some idiot
is conspiring against me.

195
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,142
Every case I find just
slips through my fingers.

196
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,054
Coming, going. Coming, going.

197
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:23,588
The idiot who's conspiring against you..

198
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:26,038
..should fall into a manhole
while walking on the road.

199
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,368
- That's my curse. He should die.
- Don't worry, Mom.

200
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,192
A man is going to
give me a case tomorrow.

201
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,881
Nobody else knows about it.

202
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,107
Let me see which idiot
takes it away from me.

203
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,060
I'm hungry. Let's go home.

204
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,551
It's a waste of time
to give your case to him.

205
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:39,093
Giving your case to Tenali..

206
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,491
..is like losing a match
even before you toss the coin.

207
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,412
Now tell me. Will you give your case..

208
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:45,317
..to Tenali Ramakrishna
or Piduguralla Subbarao?

209
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:47,422
After you've advised
me like Lord Krishna..

210
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:48,785
..why will I give my case to Tenali?

211
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,438
- I'll give it to Piduguralla sir.
- I'm leaving.

212
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:51,312
Sir! Sir!

213
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:52,965
You'll definitely win the case.

214
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:55,005
When did he come here?

215
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,590
Did he hear me?

216
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,050
- He's back.
- So what?

217
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,401
Dad! Dad!

218
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,117
He can hear you. Go on.

219
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,577
I've heard about people who ruin..

220
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,008
..friendships and marriages.

221
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:15,202
But I've never heard about a father..

222
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:16,496
..who conspires against
his son to take away his cases.

223
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,055
Are you my real father?

224
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,310
So, he's the one who's
been chasing people away?

225
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:21,150
Yes.

226
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:23,943
So, the one who I
cursed the other day..

227
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,097
Your husband, Your Honor.

228
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:28,088
Oh my God! Please cancel the request.

229
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:30,326
Don't act as if you
have the best of cases.

230
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,749
Someone lost the bell on his bicycle.

231
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,589
Someone lost the fuel in his scooter.

232
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,216
A hero's fans tore the
posters of another hero.

233
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,230
What kind of cases are they?
Why do they need lawyers?

234
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,117
- How should a lawyer be?
- He should be like a lawyer.

235
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,357
Shut your mouth.
He should be a powerful person.

236
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,672
When Tenali Ramakrishna
takes up a case..

237
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,992
..the opposite person
should accept his defeat.

238
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:48,681
That's how a lawyer should be.

239
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,675
Right. How should a father be?

240
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,302
He should leave his
son lots of wealth.

241
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:53,792
What did you give me?
This black coat..

242
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:54,807
..and that rickety scooter.

243
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:56,536
What? I'm a rickety scooter?

244
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,302
Sorry, darling. It was a
slip of the tongue. Don't be upset.

245
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:00,625
Yes.

246
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,222
Since I named you Tenali Ramakrishna..

247
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,788
..at least try to become a good lawyer.

248
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,120
Is that so?

249
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:09,498
I can be a lawyer with lots
of cases and lots of money too.

250
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:11,615
Tell him that. He's always
just talking about earning respect.

251
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,815
And tell him to cut down
on his alcohol. He'll fall sick.

252
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,374
We are done. Will you have a peg?

253
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,715
No! I'm not a rebellious
son who drinks before his father.

254
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:21,492
I'll drink in my room. Give it to me.

255
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,988
So the villain in your
story is your own father?

256
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,633
Yes. He says that the
cases we get are petty cases.

257
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,763
He wants me to take up
big cases and become famous.

258
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,924
Whenever I think about my father..

259
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:37,831
..my blood pressure raises,
raises, raises..

260
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:43,936
Down, down, down.

261
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:45,822
There's some magic in that girl.

262
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:49,496
Whenever I see her, I calm down instantly.

263
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:50,657
Let's go.

264
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,324
Hi!

265
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,980
What? Are you stressed out again?

266
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:59,711
Yes. If you give me a smile,
I'll see it and go away.

267
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,241
No need of that.
Press this, your stress will be gone.

268
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:06,400
No way. This ball treatment
won't work on him.

269
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,719
Look, Mr. Lawyer!
I told you my goal, my life ambition.

270
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,958
I want to win one case after another,
one after another..

271
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:16,614
But what if you don't
get a chance to win a case?

272
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,764
Shut up. Let her talk.

273
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:20,440
Continue.

274
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:24,429
I have deep knowledge
about all the sections.

275
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:25,823
Very good. Very good.

276
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,150
Seenu, you've many doubts
about sections, right?

277
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,179
Ask madam about them.

278
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:31,917
Okay. Please tell me about Section 302.

279
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:34,613
That's an important section.

280
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:41,398
Tell me about Section 506.

281
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,330
That's another section.

282
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:48,303
Section 5..

283
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,058
Why?

284
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:54,686
This is an easy one.
Tell him about Section 420.

285
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,653
That's another section.

286
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,268
She's very dense.
Just like the government gives..

287
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:07,016
..free houses to poor ones..

288
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,171
..someone gave her a
free lawyer's certificate.

289
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:10,492
It's okay. I'll adjust.

290
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:11,432
Any objection?

291
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:13,791
Objection overruled.
I don't have any objection.

292
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,945
With your intelligence,
you can easily become a judge.

293
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:18,748
A judge?

294
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,628
You've lost your judgment.

295
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:22,748
Get lost.

296
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,670
Ignore him.

297
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,378
Move!

298
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:28,177
You will win one case after another,
one after another..

299
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,370
..and become a successful lawyer.

300
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:32,024
Thank you. Thank you.

301
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,027
Bye.

302
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,682
Wow!

303
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:44,793
Please do something
about Janakiram's case..

304
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:45,860
Hello, sir.

305
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,140
Giri! How are you doing?

306
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,276
What is the status of our case?

307
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,616
Our case? It's still in court.

308
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,116
Even if the sun turns into the moon,
or the moon turns into the sun,

309
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,668
that Sampangi Seenu shouldn't win.

310
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,666
I don't care how much money
it costs me, I've to win it.

311
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,864
Keep up regular payments
for every hearing..

312
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,273
..I'll make sure
that he bites the dust.

313
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:06,694
Mr. Seenu, once a man hires a lawyer..

314
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:09,273
..he has to sell all his property.
He has to sell it too.

315
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:10,055
- Don't worry.
- See you later.

316
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,963
- Sir!
- We'll win!

317
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,140
What's up, Ashok?
What did your client say?

318
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,486
My client repeats the same
thing that your client says.

319
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:24,294
The lawyer is continuously
asking for his fee.

320
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:26,388
I better pay him.
It is about my honor, after all.

321
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:30,361
This case started when
K.C.R demanded for Telangana.

322
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,418
He became our CM twice till now..

323
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,080
..but we are still managing
to keep that case in court.

324
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,711
- I wonder where he is.
- Let's keep it going the same way.

325
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:40,010
I bought a site in Amaravati
with the fee he pays me.

326
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,376
There's another one as well,
we both can share it.

327
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,573
"Betrayal.."

328
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,956
- Generally..
- "Deception.."

329
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,360
Giri!

330
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,586
I as discussing our case.

331
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,269
- Did you bring my fee?
- I did.

332
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:00,136
Where is it?

333
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:04,917
Blood.

334
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:06,388
I broke your head,
of course you'll bleed.

335
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:07,846
Did you expect Rakul
Preet Singh instead?

336
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:13,419
Stop! I'll break your skull!
Stop!

337
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:15,563
Wait.

338
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:16,581
Tenali!

339
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:19,197
Why did you come to court
with tomato sauce on your head?

340
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:20,743
- Tomato sauce?
- Yes.

341
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:23,544
Don't be so cruel.
This is my blood.

342
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:28,685
Stop him. Stop him.
Or, he'll kill me. He'll kill me.

343
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:29,997
- I'll break his skull.
- Stop, please.

344
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:31,995
- The vultures should feed on his brain.
- Stop him.

345
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,515
Did he hit you? Stop it!

346
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,172
Stop him.

347
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,827
Friend, tell me what your problem is.

348
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,233
Sir, he is Sampangi Seenu.

349
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,853
He said he knows
Boyapati Seenu and..

350
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:42,111
..took 20 million
from me for his dates.

351
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:43,626
Boyapati Seenu?

352
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:45,262
Start camera.

353
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:47,094
That's him, right?

354
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:48,179
Action!

355
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:49,576
What happened next?

356
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,249
Forget Boyapati Seenu,
he doesn't even know Chitra Seenu.

357
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,466
When I asked him for money,
he gave me a cheque.

358
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,021
Do you know whose sign was on it?

359
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:56,130
Nara Lokesh's sign.

360
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,991
I hired this lawyer
to deal with this case.

361
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,214
This lawyer and that
lawyer joined hands..

362
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,869
..and have been looting
me for the past five years.

363
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,403
That's why I broke his head.

364
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:06,240
Sampangi Seenu.

365
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:06,970
Yes.

366
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:07,729
Hold this.

367
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,725
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

368
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:10,559
Let's go.

369
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:13,468
- Sampangi.
- Yes, sir?

370
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,182
- What did you do with his money?
- I bought two acres of land.

371
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,945
Wow! You are an intelligent boy.

372
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:20,088
What's the value of that land now?

373
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:20,981
40 million.

374
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:23,998
Then do one thing.
Give him one acre land.

375
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:25,446
I'll ask him to withdraw the case.

376
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,650
You'll have 20 million
profit without spending a paisa.

377
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:28,805
I won't give him a single rupee.

378
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,594
Listen! My client is
very frustrated right now.

379
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:33,683
What if he kills you?

380
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:34,951
Do you think he'll do that?

381
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,616
Maybe I'll advise him to
kill you and defend his case.

382
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,394
That way I'll have a case on my hands.

383
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:41,916
Really?

384
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,971
Yes. Good boy. Come with me.

385
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:46,850
I'll skin him alive.

386
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,563
Hold this.

387
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,427
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

388
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:51,674
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

389
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:54,026
Listen, I had a talk with him.

390
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,435
He's ready to give
you your 20 million back.

391
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,357
Withdraw the case.

392
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,562
No way! I will make him pay interest..

393
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:01,632
..simple interest,
compound interest for my 20 million.

394
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,754
- What if he files an IP?
- What will I do?

395
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:05,304
You'll be left with nothing.

396
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:08,876
I've a brilliant idea
to avoid all these problems.

397
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,564
What's that?

398
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,920
Compromise. Make a deal with him.

399
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,255
A man who compromises
is greater than a king.

400
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,608
So I'm a king?

401
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,844
You are greater than a king.

402
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,115
- Wow.
- Come on.

403
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,660
- This sounds good.
- Now you hold this.

404
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:25,535
Are you ready? Action!

405
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,457
- Okay, I'll let it go.
- That's it.

406
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,996
If you fight in the court,
only one of you will win.

407
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:35,590
But if you compromise,
you both will win.

408
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,755
I realize that now. My family
and I will be grateful to you.

409
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,114
Whenever you need my help,
I'll be here for you.

410
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:43,209
Thank you.

411
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:46,370
Me too. I'll be ready to serve you.

412
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:48,069
Thank you. You can go now.

413
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:49,621
Can you get me the
dates of hero Vinayak?

414
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:52,218
Seenu, I realized
something great today.

415
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,139
What's that?

416
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,226
Let's take over all the
pending cases in the court.

417
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,692
Let's help everyone
to come to a compromise.

418
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,350
Compromise.

419
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,123
This is Tenali's style.

420
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:22,924
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

421
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,785
"Just do as I say"

422
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,963
"Then your life will be
a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali"

423
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:40,870
"You can take a step
up when you have to"

424
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:43,772
"You should take a
step down when you need to"

425
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:47,742
"Try compromise and your
life will be a celebration"

426
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,409
"You'll be a king, brother"

427
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,024
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

428
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,245
"Just do as I say"

429
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:59,892
"Then your life will be
a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali"

430
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:05,933
(Shlokas)

431
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:12,130
(Shlokas)

432
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:18,138
(Shlokas)

433
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:24,425
(Shlokas)

434
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:40,077
"Wars compromise, scuffles compromise"

435
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:43,156
"Love failures compromise,
370 compromise"

436
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,117
"Compromise, compromise..
Just compromise"

437
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,633
"If they had given
away five villages.."

438
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:51,984
"..there wouldn't have
been Kurukshetra war in history"

439
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:53,302
"If Ravan had compromised.."

440
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:58,412
"..Lanka would've been
saved and continued to exist"

441
00:22:58,436 --> 00:23:01,420
"Even in the biggest
fights of friendship.."

442
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:04,261
"..property disputes
between siblings.."

443
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:06,627
"..compromise is the
kingly route to take"

444
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,865
"Do it right and your
life will be bright"

445
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,247
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

446
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:14,427
"Just do as I say"

447
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:20,596
"Then your life will be
a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali"

448
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,878
"Ramakrishna"

449
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:23,423
"Ramakrishna"

450
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,064
"Ramakrishna Tenali"

451
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:32,059
"Compromise,
compromise, come to a compromise"

452
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:44,856
Look! Money is growing
on trees in our garden!

453
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,342
What? Did I throw money
on the trees when I'm drunk?

454
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,059
Wait, I'll shake them.
Gather all the money.

455
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:51,300
Excuse me!

456
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:52,891
The trees didn't grow that money..

457
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,161
..your son earned it.

458
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,942
I told you that my darling
son will earn millions one day.

459
00:23:58,265 --> 00:24:01,116
I would've been happy
if he earned some respect too.

460
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,906
What do you mean?

461
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,803
You can earn only money
by making compromises.

462
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:06,612
But if you fight a good case,
you'll earn respect too.

463
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:08,766
What does he want?

464
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:10,315
You mean respect
is greater than money?

465
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:12,023
Yes. It is greater than money.

466
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:15,630
Since I'm a broker, everyone
calls your mother a broker's wife.

467
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,493
Everyone in this colony views
my kids as a broker's children.

468
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:23,048
I thought you'll earn respect
by becoming a good lawyer..

469
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:25,721
..and that will help our
whole family to be respected.

470
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,861
That's why I want my
son to be a successful lawyer.

471
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,114
What's wrong in that? Tell me.

472
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:43,540
(Prayer Song)

473
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:44,868
- Dear!
- Hmm?

474
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,388
What did you ask God?

475
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:49,847
I demanded him to
make me a famous judge.

476
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:53,343
You shouldn't demand God,
you should request him.

477
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:54,562
Remember that when you pray next time.

478
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:57,670
Why don't you hire her
as your assistant lawyer?

479
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:00,965
As soon as she wins a
case with her own capability..

480
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:02,586
..I'll give my practice to her.

481
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:04,120
Okay.

482
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,828
Wait here, I'll bring the car.

483
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:10,915
Why is the break not working?

484
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:15,124
Move! Move out of the way!
The break is not working!

485
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,807
Move! Move out of the way!

486
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:20,635
Madam, please move! Sir! Sir, move!

487
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:22,716
Stop the scooter!

488
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,208
- I can't even if I want to.
- Why?

489
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,502
The break failed!

490
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,304
Why is your father leaving
on a scooter without us?

491
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:30,824
He's not leaving on a scooter.
He's hit by a scooter.

492
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:32,768
Oh no! Looks like he's
been hit at the wrong place!

493
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:34,897
Why are you talking
so much to the neighbor?

494
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,313
My sari! Leave it!

495
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:37,598
My wife! My wife!

496
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:39,282
- Somebody save me!
- Save my wife!

497
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:40,864
- I'll help you!
- I'll help her!

498
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,138
My sari! Oh God! My sari!

499
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:44,656
- Don't worry, I'm here for you.
- Thank you. Stop the scooter.

500
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,153
- Don't worry, I'll help you.
- Help me! Help me!

501
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,208
- My sari!
- Help! Help!

502
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,590
Stop him! Stop him!

503
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:51,807
Stop!

504
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:55,388
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- My wife!

505
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:58,253
Get your hands off my wife!
Let her go!

506
00:25:58,277 --> 00:26:01,518
Excuse me!
Sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, sister.

507
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:03,916
I used your sari because
of unavoidable circumstances.

508
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,745
I'm just like your brother.

509
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,613
A brother buys saris for his sister.

510
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:09,260
He doesn't pull the one she's wearing.

511
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:11,448
You are not a brother. I don't agree.

512
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:13,149
Shut up! If he's not a brother,
is he a lover?

513
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,522
Let's go home.

514
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,686
I'll spare you because
of your age. Mind it.

515
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,003
How dare you talk to me like that?

516
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:26,594
Are you okay?
You got hit in the center. Is it safe?

517
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:30,565
Shut up! Don't announce
it to the whole world..

518
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,624
..that I got hit in the center.

519
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:33,086
Dad! Are you okay?

520
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:34,422
Hi!

521
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:35,846
Stupid fellow.

522
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,766
- Let's go home, Dad.
- Careful.

523
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:46,335
Rukmini! I'm very sorry.
If you want, I'll write..

524
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:48,923
..the word sorry ten million
times for hurting your father.

525
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,522
You don't have to write
sorry ten million times.

526
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,387
You'll hit someone else
with a scooter with failed breaks.

527
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,896
- Rukmini!
- What?

528
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:57,030
I, Tenali Ramakrishna
BA BL take an oath on..

529
00:26:57,054 --> 00:26:59,435
..Bhagavad Gita that
I won't hit your father..

530
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:02,344
..or anybody's father with
my scooter with failed breaks.

531
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:03,120
Please.

532
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:05,412
Whatever. I don't believe you.

533
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:06,920
Rukmini!

534
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:12,023
Hey! If I cross your path,
you will be at risk.

535
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:16,754
If you cross my path,
you will be at risk. I'll crush you.

536
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,981
Hello, madam!

537
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:24,335
You said the court
hearing is tomorrow.

538
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,839
Will my daughter get a bail?

539
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,770
My word is like a
Supreme Court verdict.

540
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:32,680
Varalaxmi will definitely
get a bail tomorrow.

541
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,530
Long live Varalaxmi!

542
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,266
Long live Varalaxmi!

543
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,076
Long live Varalaxmi!

544
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,114
Seenu, why is the
court so chaotic today?

545
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,115
It is Varalaxmi madam's
first hearing today.

546
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,215
That's why there
are so many people here.

547
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,833
Long live Varalaxmi!

548
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:48,631
Long live Varalaxmi!

549
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:50,483
Long live Varalaxmi!

550
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:52,210
Long live Varalaxmi!

551
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:54,041
Long live Varalaxmi!

552
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:06,611
Long live Varalaxmi!

553
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:08,391
Long live Varalaxmi!

554
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:10,085
Long live Varalaxmi!

555
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:11,805
Long live Varalaxmi!

556
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,432
Long live Varalaxmi!

557
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:15,016
Long live Varalaxmi!

558
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:23,344
Proceed.

559
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,724
Yes, Your Honor.

560
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,461
She's not just a respectable woman.

561
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,894
She's a very influential
and dangerous woman too.

562
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:32,326
She's a murderess, Your Honor.

563
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:33,962
I object, Your Honor.

564
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:36,808
I'd request my friend
here to kindly withdraw..

565
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,155
..the term murderess.

566
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:41,681
And Your Honor, my client is
a respectable and responsible citizen.

567
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:43,670
Lots of families depend on her.

568
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,650
Whenever the court needs,
I'll make sure she'll be here.

569
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:47,377
So, I once again request, Your Honor..

570
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:49,498
..to kindly grant her bail,
that's all.

571
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,190
Varalaxmi has been granted bail with..

572
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,760
..200,000 rupees as security.

573
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:10,769
If we can manage to
get one case like this..

574
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:12,249
You'll definitely lose.

575
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,401
They say a black cat crossing
your path is a bad omen.

576
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:17,553
I don't know why
 I keep you around me.

577
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:20,798
Wait and see. I will get a
case that will turn my life around.

578
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:26,582
People like us send
servants to buy vegetables.

579
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:29,773
They don't come to the
market as if it's a picnic spot.

580
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:32,724
Why did the break fail again?

581
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:35,113
What's the price of this musk melon?

582
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:36,965
Sir, move out of the way!

583
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:37,948
Madam! Madam!

584
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:38,880
Oh no!

585
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:40,630
Please move!

586
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,434
He's racing towards us like a bull!

587
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,708
Move, please!

588
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:45,595
If he hits me,
my 'lungi' will come off!

589
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,996
The break failed!
Move, sir! Move! Move!

590
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,007
Oh no!

591
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:49,946
Mom!

592
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:52,857
- Mom!
- Did she die?

593
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:54,471
- Dad!
- Oh, we should save her.

594
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:55,692
Help! Help!

595
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:57,183
Stop the cart!

596
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:58,489
Please help me!

597
00:29:58,513 --> 00:29:59,850
I'm coming.

598
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:02,627
Help! Hurry up!

599
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:05,146
Stop it.

600
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:10,516
Oh God! Your weight added
to the weight of the fruits.

601
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:13,362
- I almost died.
- What's the price of this musk melon?

602
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,480
How do I look?

603
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:18,995
Like a fruit seller.

604
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:21,530
Stupid.

605
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,475
Shut up.

606
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,333
I'm a criminal lawyer. Go away.

607
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:25,792
You look like a crazy man.

608
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,877
Mom! Mom!

609
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:28,630
Leave that basket.

610
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:30,105
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

611
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:31,262
I didn't know that
the brake failed again.

612
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,025
I didn't do it on purpose.

613
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:35,213
Tenali! You hit my Dad
and Mom with your scooter.

614
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:37,097
I'm the only one in
my family that's left.

615
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:39,299
Ram into me!
Come on! Do it if you are a real man!

616
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,496
- No, please.
- Come on! Do it! Ram into me!

617
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:42,698
- Oh God!
- I'm sorry.

618
00:30:42,722 --> 00:30:44,156
Don't you have any sense?

619
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,079
Will you ram into a girl
if she asks you to do it?

620
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,671
Sir, I thought she'll
be upset if I don't do it..

621
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:48,795
..after she asked me so many times.

622
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,049
- You!
- Dad, leave him to me.

623
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:54,222
I'll deal with you.
I'll make you pay for this.

624
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:57,689
Under sections 702,
506 and 103, I'll file..

625
00:30:57,713 --> 00:31:00,407
..one case after another,
one case after another..

626
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:05,124
..and put you behind bars.
That's Rukmini for you.

627
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:06,254
Let's go, Dad.

628
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:07,178
Let's go, dear.

629
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:07,951
Come on.

630
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:11,316
Sir, she quoted all wrong sections.
Teach her.

631
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:13,842
Get lost!
We know all the correct sections!

632
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,267
Hey!

633
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:24,473
"Her soft eyes are pricking
my heart like thorns"

634
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:34,829
"She's a soft beauty
with a fiery temper"

635
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:46,428
(Shlokas)

636
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:52,998
(Shlokas)

637
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:06,661
"Are you a sharp
sickle or a hot chili?"

638
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:10,143
"Are you a sharp
sickle or a hot chili?"

639
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,201
"Have mercy on me"

640
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:16,698
"Are you a formidable fort or a delicious sweet?"

641
00:32:16,722 --> 00:32:19,767
"Will you keep tempting me?"

642
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:22,950
"You look inviting
like a juicy tomato"

643
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,275
"But you explode like
a bomb when I touch you"

644
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:29,424
"My heart is threatening me.."

645
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,567
"..that it will stop
beating if I don't love you"

646
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:35,478
"Are you the prettiest
girl in this district?"

647
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:38,740
"Will you make me chase you?"

648
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:45,895
"Are you very stingy?
Won't you give me a small kiss?"

649
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,851
"You follow us in the name of love"

650
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:05,028
"You torture us when we say no"

651
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:08,306
"When we give in and fall in love,
you freak out"

652
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:11,610
"After that you slowly slide away"

653
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:27,747
"You disturb all night in my dreams"

654
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:30,363
"But you ignore me in the morning"

655
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:33,854
"There are diamonds
hidden in this land"

656
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,709
"You are my diamond, let me find you"

657
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:40,012
"You are like golden
wheat ready for harvest"

658
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:43,354
"Let me harvest you
with my sharp eyes"

659
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:46,900
"I'll marry you, become my wife"

660
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:52,995
"I want only you, or I'll die"

661
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:59,257
"I want only you, or I'll die"

662
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:02,557
"Sharp sickle.. Sharp sickle.."

663
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:08,726
(Shlokas)

664
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:14,710
(Shlokas)

665
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,278
Here, drink it while it's hot.

666
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,684
What's this? I asked for coffee.

667
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,411
Why can't you drink tea?

668
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,299
Okay, I'll drink it.

669
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:31,165
If I ask for biscuits,
you might give me dog food.

670
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:33,605
Sure. I'll give you whatever you want.

671
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:36,258
Tomorrow I'll go out
and buy some dog food.

672
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,016
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

673
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,190
- Hi, dear.
- Hi, dear.

674
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:40,360
Hi, darling.

675
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:44,205
God added some magic in your face.

676
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:48,067
Whenever I see you,
all my anger and frustration is gone.

677
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:50,863
I'm sure God added
some medicine to your face.

678
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,787
When I look at you
my whole body de-stresses.

679
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:57,249
Even the headache caused by my wife.

680
00:34:57,273 --> 00:34:58,632
You mean I'm a headache?

681
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:00,602
Not just headache,
neck pain, chest pain, leg pain..

682
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:02,488
..joint pains,
all the pains are caused by a wife.

683
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:03,375
Did I leave anything out?

684
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:06,556
I wish you experienced
birth pains too.

685
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:08,637
Then you would've
understood a wife's agony.

686
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:09,874
I can win an argument in the court..

687
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:11,399
..but can't argue with a wife.

688
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,737
Even if lose my senses and argue,
I know I won't win it.

689
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,614
Relax, Mom!
Relax, Dad! I'll go for a jog.

690
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:18,397
- Okay, carry on.
- Bye.

691
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:19,251
Bye.

692
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:26,544
Swetha! Tenali is right.
My eyes have magical powers.

693
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:29,243
Right. How can you believe
that stupid man's words?

694
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:31,573
No. My Dad said the same thing.

695
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:33,174
Oh God!

696
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:38,763
Why did she call now?

697
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:41,067
- Listen..
- What is it?

698
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:43,049
You've to come home
and cook food tonight.

699
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:48,066
You watch TV all day,
go for kitty parties and shopping.

700
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,113
Did you ever make a cup of tea for me?

701
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:52,772
Did you give me a massage
after a tiring day?

702
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:55,170
On our wedding day,
when I touched your feet..

703
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,314
..you said that I sprained your ankle.

704
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,739
Whenever I touch anything,
you say I sprained it.

705
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:01,213
Don't provoke me.

706
00:36:01,237 --> 00:36:02,865
If you don't cook tonight..

707
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,194
..I won't let you come into the bedroom.

708
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:09,973
If I want, I can sleep in
three different bedrooms in a day.

709
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:12,212
If you talk like that
I'll go to my mother's house.

710
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:16,623
Are you threatening me?
Go ahead. Go. I'm waiting.

711
00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:18,328
Uncle!

712
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:19,887
What? What do you want?

713
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,863
Are you under stress?

714
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:24,880
No. I'm in a city bus.
Come, let's go together.

715
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:27,904
Don't be upset.
I'll help you to forget your stress.

716
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:28,874
How?

717
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:31,541
Just look into my
eyes for a few seconds.

718
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,771
Your stress will disappear.

719
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:42,922
How do you feel now
after looking into my eyes?

720
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,959
I feel like pulling your eyes out.

721
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:48,422
We men experience
stress because of women.

722
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:49,824
If you stay here any longer..

723
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:52,282
..you'll be subjected
to my anger caused by my wife.

724
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:53,452
Go away.

725
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,952
I'll do Venky Aasan.

726
00:36:58,163 --> 00:36:59,256
Tenali!

727
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:01,034
There's a simple civil case.

728
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,039
I'm sure you can bring about a compromise..

729
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,432
..because the crucial
point in this case is..

730
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:11,183
Rukmini! Do you want coffee or tea?

731
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,781
How do you know that I'm here?

732
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:16,092
If you gamble, you'll lose money.

733
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:17,558
If you drink alcohol,
you'll lose your kidneys.

734
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:20,561
When you are around me,
I lose all my stress.

735
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:22,068
You are an idiot! You are..

736
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:24,791
No abuses.

737
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,207
You told me your stress goes
away when you look into my eyes.

738
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:30,328
One uncle was in
stress and I showed him.

739
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:31,676
What did you show him?

740
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,313
I showed him my eyes. My eyes.

741
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:35,424
I see.

742
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:37,098
But he said he'll pull out my eyes.

743
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:40,605
You can't relieve
everyone from stress.

744
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:43,542
When I look at you,
all my stress goes away.

745
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:45,986
Who knows? Maybe after a few days..

746
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,905
..your stress will disappear
when you look at me.

747
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:54,763
That would be amazing.
Will you try it?

748
00:37:55,044 --> 00:37:56,544
Please. Just once.

749
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:58,252
Let's go.

750
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:05,528
Tell me. What's the problem?

751
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:07,116
She became the second
wife of my husband.

752
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:09,696
He said he's unmarried and dated me.

753
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:11,582
But, the dating resulted in voting.

754
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:13,874
That's not voting, it's cross-voting.

755
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:15,769
Let me talk.

756
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,461
Mr. Prasad, what do you want to do?

757
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:18,431
I'm okay with both of them.

758
00:38:18,455 --> 00:38:21,964
Is it? We are talking about wives,
not children.

759
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:22,792
The court won't agree to it.

760
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:24,449
Then how do we solve this problem?

761
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:27,256
Spend three days with
her and three days with her.

762
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,453
What about Sunday?

763
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:29,675
Spend it with us.

764
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,556
Be in peace.

765
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,610
I won't let her live in peace.

766
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:35,310
I don't care if my life is ruined,
I won't let him be with her.

767
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,897
I don't care if my life is ruined,
I won't let you be happy.

768
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:39,252
- I won't agree to it.
- I will never agree.

769
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,268
Calm down!

770
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,459
- Ramakoti!
- Yes, sir?

771
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:42,296
What's happening there?

772
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,599
He is Tenali Ramakrishna.

773
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:46,572
He helps the pending
cases come to a compromise.

774
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:48,704
His father Durga Rao
gives false witness in cases.

775
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:51,610
A man who can't win learns
to live with compromises.

776
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,540
Waste fellow. Worst fellow.

777
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,386
Let's not go that way. Come on.

778
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:58,652
Look, Mr. Prasad. You can't live with
another woman after you get married.

779
00:38:58,676 --> 00:38:59,821
They will put you behind bars.

780
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:01,164
I thought it will
be fun to have two wives.

781
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,971
I never thought that all the
fun will be sucked out of my life.

782
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:05,421
Do one thing.

783
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:06,957
Promise that you'll give 10 million rupees..

784
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,060
..to the one that withdraws the case.

785
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,690
What? Is there a settlement
for living in as well?

786
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,421
Living in and settlements
are in fashion nowadays.

787
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:13,529
Living in and settlement.

788
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:14,707
Living in and settlement.

789
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,544
It's an ugly,
dirty, consecutive process.

790
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:17,912
Right. Okay, then.

791
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:18,715
Let's go.

792
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,362
Listen, whoever agrees
for a compromise..

793
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:25,749
..will get 10 million rupees.

794
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,332
Okay, I'm willing to
do it for 10 million rupees.

795
00:39:27,356 --> 00:39:28,916
Even I'm willing to
do it for 10 million rupees.

796
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,236
Wow! You are willing to
leave your husband for 10 million.

797
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,063
Anyone of you has children?

798
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:35,410
I have a daughter.

799
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,224
Whether you like it or not,
your daughter needs a father.

800
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:45,122
So, you should be with your husband.

801
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,612
Since you've faced injustice,
take the 10 million rupees..

802
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,005
..and withdraw the case.

803
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:53,018
If possible, don't get
into any live-in relationships..

804
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:53,895
..and live peacefully.

805
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:57,086
Let's go.

806
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,860
Okay.

807
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:07,325
Why did you bring me here?

808
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:11,412
I'm going to bring about
a compromise in a case..

809
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,589
..like Tenali Ramakrishna.

810
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:15,337
Really?
Are you as clever as Tenali?

811
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:18,776
If you think Tenali is clever..

812
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,486
..what should I call the
brilliant brains that I have?

813
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:23,108
Wait here, I'll be right back.

814
00:40:23,132 --> 00:40:24,813
Wait, I'll come with you.

815
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:25,845
No need.

816
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:29,021
I already called him,
he asked me to come alone.

817
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:38,561
Yes, you are right.

818
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:43,142
Hi!

819
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:47,236
Wow, sir!
You are drinking during the day.

820
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,651
Anything special?

821
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:51,021
Your coming here is special.
So, what's the matter?

822
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:54,451
You married a woman to be your
second wife and then abandoned her.

823
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:56,254
She filed a case against you.

824
00:40:56,278 --> 00:40:59,038
It is wrong to deceive a girl.

825
00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:03,321
So I came here to
suggest a compromise.

826
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:04,254
And what do you suggest?

827
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:08,201
You have 20 acres of
land at Kurnool's outskirts.

828
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:11,055
Give that to her.
Give her 50 million for her expenses.

829
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,592
I'll make sure that she
agrees to this compromise.

830
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:13,356
- Guys!
- Yes, boss?

831
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,856
- Leave us alone for some time.
- Okay, boss.

832
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,737
Let them be here. I don't mind.

833
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:19,020
I don't want to rape
you in front of everyone.

834
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:23,100
Sir! There will be a big
issue if you harm me in any way.

835
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:24,867
But you'll help us
to reach a compromise.

836
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:29,709
Come on!

837
00:42:16,154 --> 00:42:19,057
Oh God! Why is the liquor so strong?

838
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:21,052
You'll damage your
kidneys if you drink this.

839
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:22,487
Go add some water to it.

840
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,198
Do you know how long
I've been searching for you?

841
00:42:29,222 --> 00:42:33,465
Anyway, give me a smile,
all my stress will disappear.

842
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,236
It's alright, give me a smile.

843
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:38,270
Give me a smile.

844
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:41,608
Why isn't she smiling?

845
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:44,136
Give me a smile.

846
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:51,750
Sorry, man.

847
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:54,264
My stress increases
when she doesn't smile.

848
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:55,287
Give me one smile.

849
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,291
Please, just one smile. A small one.

850
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:10,562
Oh no, I think I hit you too hard.

851
00:43:10,586 --> 00:43:13,803
Okay, don't smile for me.
At least smile for them.

852
00:43:25,514 --> 00:43:28,064
Sister, I beg of you.
Please, I beg of you.

853
00:43:28,144 --> 00:43:31,138
He is killing us.
Please give him a smile.

854
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,563
Madam, please smile.
Or, he will kill all of us.

855
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,453
Do you want me to smile?

856
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:47,118
My wife fell in love
with me because of my smile.

857
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:58,026
Madam smiled.
She smiled. Thanks, madam.

858
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,833
We are leaving.
She smiled. Bye, sir. Bye.

859
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:04,555
I should hit you.

860
00:44:04,724 --> 00:44:05,715
Have you lost your mind?

861
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:07,237
Why told you to come here?

862
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:09,593
You are not clever,
you are good, that's it.

863
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:11,906
What will I do if
something happens to you?

864
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,130
What will my parents do?

865
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,812
You can try to bring about
a compromise in civil cases..

866
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:18,792
..not in criminal cases.

867
00:44:18,816 --> 00:44:20,016
He's not just someone
who married a second time.

868
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,552
He's accused of murder and rape too.

869
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,018
What compromise can you..

870
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:27,110
Criminals must be punished.
Got it?

871
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:28,812
Come on.

872
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:30,544
Let's go.

873
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:54,586
Tenali!

874
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:55,601
Hi!

875
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:04,336
Usually whenever I see you,
all my stress disappears.

876
00:45:05,823 --> 00:45:10,579
But for some strange reason,
my stress is increasing now.

877
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,224
Why?

878
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:13,972
I don't know.

879
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:21,900
Can I tell you something?

880
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:22,894
Sure.

881
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:30,592
I love you.

882
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:52,662
Sir, did you see this video?

883
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:54,913
A girl kissed her lover
in front of her father.

884
00:45:55,058 --> 00:45:58,558
Take a look.
See the way she kissed him. See it.

885
00:46:02,982 --> 00:46:04,583
It's a nice video.
Why are you hitting me?

886
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,935
Give me 5,000 rupees.
I'm in need of money.

887
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:16,892
What? I gave you 2,000
rupees just a few days ago.

888
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,146
Bring me some cases,
then I'll pay you.

889
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:18,975
Sir!

890
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,596
Chakravarthi sir is calling me.

891
00:46:20,676 --> 00:46:21,746
- Okay, go on.
- I'm coming.

892
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,412
Hello, sir!

893
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:25,353
Your name..

894
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:26,419
I'm Durga Rao.

895
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:29,023
My son's name is Tenali Ramakrishna.

896
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:30,174
He's a lawyer in this court.

897
00:46:30,198 --> 00:46:32,682
I wish he becomes
a great lawyer like you.

898
00:46:33,075 --> 00:46:35,462
A sparrow and an
eagle fly in the sky..

899
00:46:35,486 --> 00:46:36,956
..but they can never be the same.

900
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:38,842
Just because your son is a lawyer..

901
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:40,660
..he's not equal to me. No.

902
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:44,116
You used to come in
as a false witness, right?

903
00:46:44,574 --> 00:46:45,349
Yes, sir.

904
00:46:45,494 --> 00:46:48,137
Now you help small lawyers
to get small cases..

905
00:46:48,184 --> 00:46:49,481
..and take commission from them.

906
00:46:49,592 --> 00:46:52,625
That means you still
work as a broker, right?

907
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:56,100
Wait, I've another doubt.
Is it just you in the family..

908
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:58,072
..or do your wife and
children work as brokers too?

909
00:46:58,096 --> 00:46:58,570
Hey!

910
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:04,576
Did my words anger you?

911
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:14,509
What is my fault? Why did you hit me?

912
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:16,093
How angry should I be when your son..

913
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:19,313
..is trying to trap my daughter,
you bloody..

914
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:22,641
Your whole family sleeps
in one room under one fan..

915
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:25,864
..to save on electricity
bill by not using two fans.

916
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:28,774
My family installs
AC even in the dog's room.

917
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,803
A broker's son will become a broker.

918
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,118
That's why he's continuing
your broker legacy..

919
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:36,992
..by helping people
to come to a compromise.

920
00:47:38,918 --> 00:47:41,438
Tell your son to stay
away from my daughter.

921
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:45,217
That way he'll live longer.
I don't want to kill your son.

922
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:49,620
But if he wants to die,
I don't mind doing it.

923
00:48:06,876 --> 00:48:07,828
Dad!

924
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:09,740
Dad!

925
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:13,124
You are always talking
about respect, right?

926
00:48:13,148 --> 00:48:14,902
I brought you well respected alcohol.

927
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,593
To my Dad, with love.

928
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:22,407
What? Are you worried
that it's too expensive?

929
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:24,489
All the rich people drink it.
Tell him.

930
00:48:30,197 --> 00:48:31,793
Why does everyone look so disturbed?

931
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:36,817
I thought you'll help me gain respect.

932
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,843
But I've lost it.

933
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:50,278
How angry should I be, you bloody..

934
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:55,349
Your whole family sleeps
in one room under one fan..

935
00:48:57,919 --> 00:48:59,146
Tenali, wait.

936
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:03,654
A broker's son will become a broker.

937
00:49:06,742 --> 00:49:08,075
It's a beautiful orchard.

938
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,004
Someone gifted it to my Dad.

939
00:49:10,028 --> 00:49:11,241
Oh, wow.

940
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:14,190
Hi, Tenali.

941
00:49:14,214 --> 00:49:15,749
Rukmini! Where is your father?

942
00:49:15,773 --> 00:49:18,052
He's in a mango orchard
near Bangalore Highway.

943
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:19,254
I'm coming there right now.

944
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:21,699
Tenali is coming. You can go home.

945
00:49:21,723 --> 00:49:23,445
There's nobody else here. Take care.

946
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:25,028
I don't want anyone else to be here. Just go.

947
00:49:25,052 --> 00:49:26,763
Okay, okay.

948
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:29,329
Tenali!

949
00:49:29,353 --> 00:49:30,346
Where's your father?

950
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,196
He's not here.

951
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,592
Then why did you call me here?

952
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,453
To show you this orchard.

953
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:35,587
Who wants to see this stupid orchard?

954
00:49:35,611 --> 00:49:36,555
Where is your father?

955
00:49:39,263 --> 00:49:40,220
Dad!

956
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:16,089
The whole world sees
me as Varalaxmi's lawyer.

957
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:20,059
But only this mango orchard
knows that I'm your lawyer.

958
00:50:22,074 --> 00:50:24,998
As soon as you got to know
that a journalist is murdered..

959
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,938
..you came up with a brilliant plan.

960
00:50:27,962 --> 00:50:30,342
Frame Varalaxmi in the murder case.

961
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:34,096
I will be her lawyer and
make sure that she gets locked up.

962
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,981
You made me file a case
and gave me your lawyer.

963
00:50:39,155 --> 00:50:41,914
Then you created two
false witnesses to say..

964
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,464
..that Varalaxmi committed the murder.

965
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:48,661
Poor Varalaxmi.
She thinks she's going to win..

966
00:50:48,685 --> 00:50:49,725
..when she has defeat
right beside her.

967
00:50:49,749 --> 00:50:50,475
You are right.

968
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:53,153
Our criminal lawyer won't let her win.

969
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:57,224
I'll make sure that
Varalaxmi gets locked up.

970
00:50:57,248 --> 00:50:59,719
The whole of Kurnool
will be under your control.

971
00:50:59,743 --> 00:51:04,821
That's why I gifted
you this 70 acre orchard.

972
00:51:05,632 --> 00:51:07,359
If we want to win this case..

973
00:51:07,383 --> 00:51:10,304
..you and your wife are
crucial as the eye witnesses.

974
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:13,225
The judge should believe your lies.

975
00:51:13,249 --> 00:51:14,360
That's very important.

976
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,005
Ashok Kumar will
present a strong case..

977
00:51:17,029 --> 00:51:19,058
..to make sure that Varalaxmi
gets a prison sentence.

978
00:51:19,082 --> 00:51:20,685
Though I know everything
I'll act innocent and..

979
00:51:20,709 --> 00:51:21,754
..stand there shell-shocked.

980
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:24,479
Before Varalaxmi realizes
what's happening in court..

981
00:51:24,503 --> 00:51:26,072
..she'll be given a sentence.

982
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:27,376
Case over.
File close.

983
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,368
Why are all the criminals
of Kurnool gathered here?

984
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:36,423
Rukmini! Come here.

985
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:39,392
I've lost respect for you, Dad.

986
00:51:41,008 --> 00:51:44,506
You framed an innocent
lady for a mango orchard?

987
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,647
And you think you
can talk about my family?

988
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:51,085
Yes, my Dad is a broker,
but he's not corrupt like you.

989
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:54,364
Yes, our whole family
sleeps under one fan..

990
00:51:54,773 --> 00:51:57,105
..but we can't do despicable
deeds to buy ACs like you.

991
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:58,654
We won't be able to sleep in peace.

992
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:02,839
You said something else too. Yes.

993
00:52:02,863 --> 00:52:04,371
A broker's son will become a broker.

994
00:52:04,395 --> 00:52:06,958
That's why your son is
living by creating compromises.

995
00:52:06,982 --> 00:52:10,021
Sir! I don't want
your pathetic capability.

996
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:10,817
Tenali!

997
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:12,640
You have to hear it. Hear it.

998
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:16,198
It's okay if criminals like
you are free to roam outside.

999
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,529
But a good-hearted
woman like Varalaxmi Devi..

1000
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,627
..shouldn't be locked up,
Tenali won't let that happen.

1001
00:52:22,402 --> 00:52:25,131
His maturity levels are very low.

1002
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:28,088
Sir, I think you'll have
another murder case on hands.

1003
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:28,796
Whose murder?

1004
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,936
Maybe Naidu sir will
kill Tenali Ramakrishna BA BL.

1005
00:52:34,105 --> 00:52:36,819
Go kill him.

1006
00:52:37,643 --> 00:52:39,748
Why are you going alone
as if walking into an interview?

1007
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,080
All of you, go!

1008
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,497
Hit him!

1009
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:20,188
Surround him and hit him.

1010
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,507
You eat lots of 'Biryani' every day..

1011
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:53,577
..and drink a full bottle every night.
Go kill him.

1012
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:14,160
Oh God!

1013
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,925
Rukmini, come on!

1014
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:32,462
Rukmini, I'll break your
legs if you go with him.

1015
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:33,503
Mr. Lawyer!

1016
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,106
Your daughter is mine
and your case is mine.

1017
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:39,231
You've only seen me trying
to make compromises till now..

1018
00:54:39,255 --> 00:54:42,070
..but there won't be
any compromise with this case.

1019
00:54:42,343 --> 00:54:43,516
Rukku..

1020
00:54:44,426 --> 00:54:45,386
..hop on.

1021
00:55:00,975 --> 00:55:01,697
Good morning, ma'am!

1022
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:02,754
Please come.

1023
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:03,655
Have a seat.

1024
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,784
Thank you.

1025
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:09,143
Ma'am, just before I start,
I've a small doubt.

1026
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,775
Did a lawyer named Tenali
Ramakrishna meet you?

1027
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:13,696
No. Who is he?

1028
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,063
Just like a tissue paper.
Not important.

1029
00:55:16,087 --> 00:55:18,004
So, coming to your case, ma'am..

1030
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:19,894
We are going to win, right?

1031
00:55:19,918 --> 00:55:21,547
No, we are going to lose.

1032
00:55:21,757 --> 00:55:22,917
What?

1033
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:26,345
We'll lose on purpose.

1034
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:27,773
Why should we lose?

1035
00:55:27,902 --> 00:55:30,918
You can use this case to your advantage.

1036
00:55:32,173 --> 00:55:32,819
How?

1037
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:35,927
I'll lose the case in the court,
the police will arrest you.

1038
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:38,351
You'll tell the media that
they framed you in a false case..

1039
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:42,656
..because you are a threat
to their political ambitions..

1040
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,655
..and that they are jealous
of your increasing popularity.

1041
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,367
We'll get some channels
and newspapers on our side..

1042
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:50,785
..and spread this news.

1043
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,798
People's sympathy for you will
increase like the prices of gold.

1044
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,252
I'll get a bail for you in six months.

1045
00:55:56,276 --> 00:55:57,935
As soon as you come out of prison..

1046
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:01,612
..you'll contest for MP's post.
You'll win with majority.

1047
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:06,133
You think I'll have a political
career after going to prison?

1048
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:11,101
If you go to jail,
your political career will be strong..

1049
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:13,820
..like a wall built with
Nagarjuna Cement. Trust me.

1050
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:18,350
Okay. I trust you.

1051
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:23,447
Tell me.

1052
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,881
Varalaxmi will confess
in the court that..

1053
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:27,754
..she murdered that
man and will go to prison.

1054
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:31,367
Tenali shouldn't come to
the court at any cost.

1055
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,170
 Be careful.

1056
00:56:32,194 --> 00:56:33,323
He won't come.

1057
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:35,957
I won't let him come.

1058
00:56:39,346 --> 00:56:42,720
Wait a minute.
Allow us to cross the road.

1059
00:57:02,278 --> 00:57:03,683
Seenu, where is Tenali?

1060
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:05,434
He said he'll be here by 9 o' clock.

1061
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,664
Once the cross-examination is done..

1062
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:11,985
..they'll arrest Varalaxmi.

1063
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:29,053
Time is up.
Why hasn't the judge come yet?

1064
00:57:29,077 --> 00:57:31,118
He goes to the temple every
day before coming to court.

1065
00:57:35,104 --> 00:57:37,257
What's the matter?
Why do you look worried?

1066
00:57:37,926 --> 00:57:40,766
Nothing, ma'am. I just want
the cross-examination to be over.

1067
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,393
Actually, he's never late. Why today..

1068
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:52,899
Bring the car.
I'm getting late for court.

1069
00:57:52,923 --> 00:57:53,797
Okay, sir.

1070
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:56,308
Call him.

1071
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:58,261
Come on, hurry up.

1072
00:58:04,436 --> 00:58:05,510
I'm not able to reach him.

1073
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:08,378
What do we do now?

1074
00:58:14,017 --> 00:58:16,154
Naidu sir! The judge's car is here.

1075
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:19,532
We'll win the case and
Varalaxmi will go to prison.

1076
00:58:19,556 --> 00:58:20,667
Be happy. Don't worry.

1077
00:58:24,482 --> 00:58:27,524
Hey, Ayomayam! What are you muttering?

1078
00:58:27,548 --> 00:58:28,225
Where is the judge?

1079
00:58:28,249 --> 00:58:30,825
Judge sir never saw me like a driver.

1080
00:58:31,058 --> 00:58:34,062
- He treated me like his cousin.
- Where is he?

1081
00:58:34,995 --> 00:58:36,782
Somebody kidnapped him.

1082
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,610
He was so good to me.

1083
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:45,973
I'm not able to reach him.

1084
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,033
What do we do now?

1085
00:58:49,057 --> 00:58:50,507
Tenali already told
me what we should do..

1086
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:51,967
..if he doesn't come to the court.

1087
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:54,308
If I don't reach the
court by 9 am tomorrow..

1088
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,227
If you don't?

1089
00:58:58,306 --> 00:58:59,719
Kidnap the judge.

1090
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:00,678
- Kidnap?
- Quiet.

1091
00:59:00,702 --> 00:59:02,779
Sorry. Kidnap?

1092
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:03,802
Kidnap.

1093
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,823
Who will kidnap the judge?

1094
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:19,971
Bring the car.
I'm getting late for court.

1095
00:59:19,995 --> 00:59:20,722
Okay, sir.

1096
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:25,810
Who are you guys?

1097
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:27,342
- Who are you?
- Fans!

1098
00:59:27,366 --> 00:59:28,537
Why are you attacking me if you are my fans?

1099
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:29,413
Diehard fans.

1100
00:59:29,437 --> 00:59:31,168
Only Prabhas has diehard fans.

1101
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,085
You have them too.

1102
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:35,061
- I have them too?
- Come on, get in. Get in.

1103
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:36,385
Come on, get in.

1104
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:45,008
Why did you kidnap me?

1105
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:46,776
To see happiness in
my brother in law's eyes.

1106
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,859
If you want to see happiness
in your brother in law's eyes..

1107
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:50,278
..you should take
good care of his sister.

1108
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:51,116
Why did you kidnap me?

1109
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,490
Who is your brother in law?

1110
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:55,006
What? You don't know
who my brother in law is?

1111
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,461
Is your brother in law
famous like Allu Aravind?

1112
00:59:56,485 --> 00:59:58,024
Why should I know him, you idiot?

1113
00:59:58,048 --> 00:59:58,772
Silent!

1114
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:02,128
Wait, I have to take this call.

1115
01:00:03,254 --> 01:00:04,841
Giri, what happened?

1116
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:05,928
Successfully kidnapped him.

1117
01:00:06,322 --> 01:00:10,546
He is a judge. Be respectful to him.

1118
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,019
Nobody can beat me
in being respectful.

1119
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:14,659
Leave it to me. Okay.

1120
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,922
Tenali!

1121
01:00:40,463 --> 01:00:41,504
Noise pollution.

1122
01:00:41,528 --> 01:00:44,721
You have to listen to me.
No other option.

1123
01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:46,485
Who is he?

1124
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,931
Madam, I'm Tenali Ramakrishna, BA BL.

1125
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,435
He must've asked you
if I came to meet you.

1126
01:00:51,459 --> 01:00:54,593
Did a lawyer named Tenali
Ramakrishna meet you?

1127
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,790
Tissue paper..

1128
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:56,825
Huh?

1129
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:57,569
Hmm.

1130
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,864
Yes, ma'am. I'm that tissue paper.
You don't know me..

1131
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:02,372
..but I know a lot about you.

1132
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:04,486
I don't have any
personal grudge with him.

1133
01:01:04,572 --> 01:01:07,056
I've a problem with the
fact that they are trapping you.

1134
01:01:07,777 --> 01:01:09,039
How are they trapping me?

1135
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,342
Didn't you tell her?

1136
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,319
- Tenali!
- Wait!

1137
01:01:11,886 --> 01:01:12,591
Tell me.

1138
01:01:12,922 --> 01:01:13,925
You are superb.

1139
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,136
That man who's anxiously
waiting to see who will win..

1140
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,938
..one million in the show
Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

1141
01:01:21,689 --> 01:01:24,235
That man who looks
ready to beat up his wife..

1142
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:27,265
..because she didn't give
him snacks with his liquor.

1143
01:01:28,095 --> 01:01:31,759
And this man who looks like
an innocent boy in white clothes.

1144
01:01:31,783 --> 01:01:34,528
These three men are trying
to frame you in a murder case.

1145
01:01:34,552 --> 01:01:37,265
They bribed him with
70 acre mango orchard for it.

1146
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:39,082
Here is the proof for it.

1147
01:01:44,462 --> 01:01:47,075
Ma'am, he's lying.
Everything he said is a lie.

1148
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:49,642
If I'm right, he must've
asked you to lose this case.

1149
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:52,341
He must've told you that
he'll get you a bail in six months.

1150
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,735
They are framing you
in this case so that..

1151
01:01:54,759 --> 01:01:56,715
..Simhadri Naidu won't
have any competition in Kurnool.

1152
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,966
She feeds so many
people with her hands.

1153
01:02:00,273 --> 01:02:01,486
It's okay if we don't
join our hands before her..

1154
01:02:01,705 --> 01:02:02,954
..but we shouldn't put
hand-cuffs on her hands.

1155
01:02:03,157 --> 01:02:05,230
It's okay if we don't
help her as lawyers..

1156
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:07,174
..but we shouldn't put her in jail.

1157
01:02:07,878 --> 01:02:10,530
I told you what I had to.
Now it's up to you.

1158
01:02:12,824 --> 01:02:13,970
Mr. Chakravarthi!

1159
01:02:14,643 --> 01:02:17,295
Send me an NOC that
you are leaving this case.

1160
01:02:17,386 --> 01:02:18,466
Ma'am, this fellow is..

1161
01:02:27,761 --> 01:02:32,621
I'll see how you will win
this case with Tenali's help.

1162
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:33,564
Really?

1163
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,691
How did he escape from that container?

1164
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:56,151
It seems he hid his phone in his shoe.

1165
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:58,345
He placed an order for
20 'Biryanis' on Swiggy.

1166
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:00,647
Swiggy delivery boys came
and stopped our container..

1167
01:03:00,671 --> 01:03:01,551
..and saved Tenali.

1168
01:03:10,478 --> 01:03:11,629
What do we do now?

1169
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:17,694
Order Mutton 'Biryani'
from Swiggy and stuff yourselves.

1170
01:03:17,718 --> 01:03:18,471
Get lost!

1171
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,153
You idiot!

1172
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:28,200
Every kidnapper has some demands.

1173
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:29,911
Tell me what your demand is.

1174
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:31,179
My brother in law will decide that.

1175
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,637
Who is your brother in law?
Your brother in law..

1176
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:36,270
Okay, you can do that. I'll tell you.

1177
01:03:36,788 --> 01:03:37,984
Yes, tell me.

1178
01:03:38,008 --> 01:03:41,039
They gave a new date for the hearing.
Leave the judge.

1179
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:42,666
You found the tailor?

1180
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:50,545
Then who did I kidnap?

1181
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:52,267
Okay, bye.

1182
01:03:52,615 --> 01:03:53,801
What's wrong?

1183
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:56,806
I'll explain.

1184
01:03:56,994 --> 01:03:58,954
Sir, are you not a tailor?

1185
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:03,838
I'm not a tailor.
I'm a judge who gives verdicts.

1186
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:07,053
Sorry, sir. We kidnapped
a judge instead of a tailor.

1187
01:04:07,568 --> 01:04:10,253
A tailor took 700,000 rupees
from us to stitch clothes..

1188
01:04:10,277 --> 01:04:12,487
..for my niece's wedding
and then deceived us.

1189
01:04:12,703 --> 01:04:14,302
We kidnapped you thinking
that you are him.

1190
01:04:14,326 --> 01:04:17,097
Shoot! Our kidnapping
has gone to waste.

1191
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,992
I wouldn't have been upset
if you had kidnapped me..

1192
01:04:20,016 --> 01:04:21,560
..thinking that I was a judge.

1193
01:04:21,584 --> 01:04:23,909
But you guys kidnapped
me thinking that I'm a tailor.

1194
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:25,626
That is more hurtful.

1195
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:28,700
We are releasing you.
You may go.

1196
01:04:28,724 --> 01:04:30,372
- Umbrella please.
- Here you go.

1197
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:34,894
Sir! Judge, I'm sorry!

1198
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:39,485
Listen! Do me a favor.

1199
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:40,359
What's that?

1200
01:04:40,383 --> 01:04:43,163
Don't tell anyone
that you kidnapped me.

1201
01:04:43,187 --> 01:04:43,933
I'll try.

1202
01:04:43,957 --> 01:04:46,698
I'll manage the
situation at the court.

1203
01:04:54,674 --> 01:04:56,130
Let's go.

1204
01:04:58,315 --> 01:05:02,321
"You sleep in my heart, my darling"

1205
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:05,756
"You lure me in my dreams"

1206
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:11,921
"You are an enchantress
who is acting innocent"

1207
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:13,193
Tell me.

1208
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,130
Varalaxmi Devi's case
has a new hearing, right?

1209
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,009
Yes.

1210
01:05:17,365 --> 01:05:19,524
So you'll be fighting her case, right?

1211
01:05:19,604 --> 01:05:20,548
Yes.

1212
01:05:20,572 --> 01:05:23,184
So there are no obstacles
for our wedding, right?

1213
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:24,896
Yes.

1214
01:05:25,114 --> 01:05:27,467
After our wedding,
I'll have all the power over you.

1215
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:29,700
I'm the queen.

1216
01:05:40,594 --> 01:05:41,794
What about me?

1217
01:05:44,265 --> 01:05:45,319
A slave.

1218
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:18,160
"Music"

1219
01:06:31,953 --> 01:06:35,429
"She's like candy floss..
She's as innocent as a dove"

1220
01:06:35,453 --> 01:06:38,857
"She created havoc in my
life and made me fall in love"

1221
01:06:41,937 --> 01:06:45,763
"You are a bandit..
Your heart is mine"

1222
01:06:45,787 --> 01:06:48,912
"You have no other option
but to give it to me"

1223
01:06:48,936 --> 01:06:52,340
"I swear on your dazzling beauty"

1224
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:55,912
"I'll slave for you all my life"

1225
01:06:55,936 --> 01:06:59,362
"Your willingness only
adds fuel to my fire"

1226
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:02,872
"I'll use violence to
make you fall in love with me"

1227
01:07:02,896 --> 01:07:06,319
"Okay, my queen!
I'll guard your beauty.."

1228
01:07:06,343 --> 01:07:09,644
"..so that nobody steals it"

1229
01:07:09,668 --> 01:07:13,190
"Okay.. That's why I fell for you"

1230
01:07:13,214 --> 01:07:16,558
"Okay.. You're a lucky fellow"

1231
01:07:43,503 --> 01:07:47,249
"Coffee from Starbucks,
lunch from Subway"

1232
01:07:47,361 --> 01:07:50,735
"And I'll bring 'Biryani'
from Taj for dinner"

1233
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:57,884
"A kiss instead of coffee,
a hug instead of lunch"

1234
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:01,185
"I don't want dinner
if I have romance"

1235
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:04,743
"My queen's word is my rule"

1236
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:08,210
"I don't have the courage
to cross her line"

1237
01:08:08,234 --> 01:08:11,682
"My beauty is my treasure"

1238
01:08:11,706 --> 01:08:15,190
"Plunder me and make me yours"

1239
01:08:15,214 --> 01:08:18,897
"Okay, my queen, I'll do as you say"

1240
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:22,272
"Let me rule the kingdom of love"

1241
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:25,567
"Okay.. I'll give it to you"

1242
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:28,821
"Okay.. I'll make you the king"

1243
01:08:52,187 --> 01:08:55,081
We thought you'll stand with
Varalaxmi and put her in jail..

1244
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:57,630
..like Kattappa betrayed
and killed Bahubali.

1245
01:08:57,654 --> 01:08:59,637
But that Tenali came
at the last minute..

1246
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:03,219
..and ruined our plan
as easily as bursting a bubble.

1247
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:03,947
Right.

1248
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:08,838
You are like the mighty
sea and he's like a little stream.

1249
01:09:08,862 --> 01:09:11,116
But we shouldn't
underestimate that Tenali.

1250
01:09:11,927 --> 01:09:14,203
We should make sure our
false witnesses are strong.

1251
01:09:14,429 --> 01:09:17,090
Sure, sir.
I'll bring them to your home tomorrow.

1252
01:09:19,177 --> 01:09:19,797
Good evening, sir.

1253
01:09:19,877 --> 01:09:21,183
Good evening. Good evening.

1254
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,738
She's my wife.

1255
01:09:22,945 --> 01:09:24,545
- Is she the lady witness?
- Yes, sir.

1256
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:25,555
Have a seat.

1257
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:28,735
Your witness at the
court should be strong.

1258
01:09:28,867 --> 01:09:29,999
You shouldn't get confused
no matter how much..

1259
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:31,054
..the opposing lawyer
tries to confuse you.

1260
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,966
Confidently give the same answer.

1261
01:09:33,412 --> 01:09:35,320
Only then Varalaxmi
will get punished and..

1262
01:09:35,453 --> 01:09:37,508
..we all can easily
get out of this mess.

1263
01:09:38,268 --> 01:09:39,946
You know what you should
say in the court, right?

1264
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:43,095
My husband and I will
come to the court tomorrow.

1265
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:46,990
We'll say everything as you said.

1266
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,458
Why is she singing?

1267
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:52,066
She likes to talk as if she's singing.

1268
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:52,728
Really?

1269
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:55,763
The song is a problem,
but the testimony is solid.

1270
01:09:56,047 --> 01:09:56,641
Huh.

1271
01:09:56,721 --> 01:10:00,289
The judge will believe what we say.

1272
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:03,195
Then he'll punish her
according to the constitution.

1273
01:10:03,281 --> 01:10:03,981
Yes.

1274
01:10:08,848 --> 01:10:12,111
According to the law,
not according to the constitution.

1275
01:10:12,324 --> 01:10:13,112
Oh okay.

1276
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:17,013
Kiran! I've heard many husky voices.

1277
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:19,502
But I've never heard
such a risky voice.

1278
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:20,355
Sir..

1279
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,064
What is your name?

1280
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:24,898
My father and mother
named me Kamala Paul.

1281
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:28,964
My husband lovingly
calls me Bujji Paul.

1282
01:10:29,743 --> 01:10:32,494
We use Vijaya Milk
to make coffee at home.

1283
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:35,372
- Kiran!
- Sir!

1284
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:37,215
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

1285
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:39,867
There should be no mistakes
in the court tomorrow.

1286
01:10:40,143 --> 01:10:41,762
- Yes, sir.
- The judge shouldn't get confused.

1287
01:10:41,842 --> 01:10:43,683
- Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.

1288
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:45,590
See you later, sir.

1289
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:46,909
- Bye, sir.
- Kiran!

1290
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:47,729
Let's go.

1291
01:10:47,753 --> 01:10:49,093
- Don't worry, sir. I'll handle it.
- Okay.

1292
01:10:49,117 --> 01:10:50,124
Let's go.

1293
01:10:54,888 --> 01:10:58,597
Tenali! God's twists are so funny.

1294
01:10:59,023 --> 01:11:02,930
Chakravarthi made me
cry in this very court.

1295
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:08,232
He's not an ordinary lawyer.
He's very clever.

1296
01:11:08,755 --> 01:11:10,886
Only when we fight with
a lion we come to know..

1297
01:11:11,044 --> 01:11:12,683
..whether we are a lion or a lamb.

1298
01:11:15,508 --> 01:11:17,258
I want to see my son win.

1299
01:11:46,099 --> 01:11:47,386
Mr. Chakravarthi!

1300
01:11:47,649 --> 01:11:48,612
Proceed.

1301
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:50,216
Thank you, Your Honor.

1302
01:11:51,042 --> 01:11:53,483
Ms. Varalaxmi!
Where were you on August 8th..

1303
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:55,688
..on the day of the murder?

1304
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,276
In my home.

1305
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,569
What were you doing?

1306
01:11:58,649 --> 01:11:59,521
I was sleeping.

1307
01:11:59,601 --> 01:12:01,167
Do you have any
evidence to prove that..

1308
01:12:01,247 --> 01:12:03,215
..you were sleeping
in your own home that day?

1309
01:12:03,825 --> 01:12:05,425
Objection, Your Honor.

1310
01:12:08,647 --> 01:12:11,561
Tenali, the judge is sitting
that side. Turn towards him.

1311
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,621
Sorry, Your Honor. Objection.

1312
01:12:18,823 --> 01:12:19,996
What's your objection?

1313
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,298
Asking a woman where she
slept on a particular night..

1314
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:24,854
..is like insulting her, Your Honor.

1315
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:26,300
Since this is a murder case..

1316
01:12:26,324 --> 01:12:27,898
..men and women will be treated alike.

1317
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:29,281
Objection overruled.

1318
01:12:29,468 --> 01:12:30,561
Thank you, Your Honor.

1319
01:12:31,053 --> 01:12:33,514
So coming back to you, is there any evidence..

1320
01:12:33,594 --> 01:12:36,647
..to prove that you were
sleeping in your own home?

1321
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,015
There is no evidence.

1322
01:12:38,968 --> 01:12:40,485
Point to be noted, Your Honor.

1323
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:44,625
Okay, Ms. Varalaxmi.
People like you generally have..

1324
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:47,946
..security cameras
installed in your homes.

1325
01:12:47,978 --> 01:12:50,038
Can you present some
camera footage to the court..

1326
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:52,586
..to prove that you
were at home that day?

1327
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:55,726
Our CCTV cameras stopped
working a couple of days ago.

1328
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:57,346
So I couldn't get any footage.

1329
01:12:57,584 --> 01:12:58,326
Really?

1330
01:12:58,406 --> 01:12:59,660
Point to be noted again, Your Honor.

1331
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,668
Objection again, Your Honor.

1332
01:13:00,748 --> 01:13:02,351
What's your objection?

1333
01:13:02,518 --> 01:13:04,854
Just because the CCTV
cameras at her home..

1334
01:13:04,934 --> 01:13:07,079
..are not working,
it doesn't mean she killed someone.

1335
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:08,553
- Mr. Chakravarthi!
- Your Honor.

1336
01:13:08,632 --> 01:13:09,930
Is there an eye witness
to testify that..

1337
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,170
..Varalaxmi committed the murder?

1338
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,266
Yes, Your Honor.

1339
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:15,825
Can I request Two Town
CI Kiran to please come..

1340
01:13:15,905 --> 01:13:17,057
..to the witness box?

1341
01:13:17,137 --> 01:13:18,266
Okay, proceed.

1342
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:23,670
So, CI Kiran, what happened
on the night of the murder?

1343
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:24,589
There was a murder.

1344
01:13:25,246 --> 01:13:25,937
Is that a punch dialogue?

1345
01:13:26,061 --> 01:13:28,137
No, seriously. There was a murder.

1346
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,475
Shut up and tell what really happened.

1347
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:32,690
I mean, please tell
us what happened after that.

1348
01:13:32,714 --> 01:13:36,695
There was a murder at
4:20 am at Kondareddy Fort.

1349
01:13:37,018 --> 01:13:39,356
I reached the crime scene at 5:30 am.

1350
01:13:39,635 --> 01:13:40,910
There were no eye witnesses
because it happened..

1351
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:41,916
..so early in the morning.

1352
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:45,084
At 7:00 am, a couple called
me and said they saw it.

1353
01:13:45,108 --> 01:13:47,880
Based on the complaint they filed,
I went and..

1354
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:49,418
..arrested Ms. Varalaxmi at 8:00 am.

1355
01:13:50,273 --> 01:13:50,924
Thank you.

1356
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:52,695
- Sir.
- That's all, Your Honor.

1357
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:57,503
Your Honor,
I want to question the Two Town CI.

1358
01:13:57,527 --> 01:13:58,426
Go ahead.

1359
01:13:58,450 --> 01:13:59,570
Thank you, Your Honor.

1360
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,263
- Inspector!
- Yes, sir.

1361
01:14:02,546 --> 01:14:04,964
What happened on
the night of the murder?

1362
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:06,261
There was a murder, sir.

1363
01:14:13,752 --> 01:14:16,229
Okay. What happened after the murder?

1364
01:14:16,253 --> 01:14:17,802
The constable called
me and I went there.

1365
01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:18,924
Did you go to the station
or the crime scene?

1366
01:14:18,948 --> 01:14:19,717
The crime scene.

1367
01:14:19,741 --> 01:14:21,299
- What time did you go there?
- At 7:00 am.

1368
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,983
Did the witnesses come
to the station or call you?

1369
01:14:23,007 --> 01:14:24,129
No, they called me.

1370
01:14:24,153 --> 01:14:25,961
The murder happened at 4:20 am.

1371
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:27,454
Why did they call you at 7:00 am?

1372
01:14:27,478 --> 01:14:29,041
Maybe the witnesses were scared, sir.

1373
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:30,680
So they weren't scared
after two and a half hours?

1374
01:14:30,704 --> 01:14:31,696
Maybe they thought about it.

1375
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,349
Okay. The witnesses called you.

1376
01:14:33,373 --> 01:14:34,745
But how did they get your number?

1377
01:14:34,769 --> 01:14:36,085
I.. Actually..

1378
01:14:36,109 --> 01:14:38,110
Please note this point, Your Honor.

1379
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:39,803
You can leave, sir.

1380
01:14:40,246 --> 01:14:41,344
You can leave.

1381
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:45,292
Your Honor,
please allow me to cross-examine..

1382
01:14:45,372 --> 01:14:47,834
..the witnesses presented
by the public prosecutor.

1383
01:14:47,914 --> 01:14:49,073
Okay, proceed.

1384
01:14:49,097 --> 01:14:50,053
Hello, sir.

1385
01:14:50,131 --> 01:14:51,176
Hello.

1386
01:14:51,879 --> 01:14:52,862
Mr. Ananth!

1387
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,123
Did you see Ms. Varalaxmi commit the murder?

1388
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:58,533
We saw it with our four
eyes at 4:20 in the morning.

1389
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:00,285
What were you doing
there at that hour?

1390
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:02,326
That day we were
travelling to Vijayawada..

1391
01:15:02,406 --> 01:15:05,156
..from Kurnool via
Srisailam Ghat Road.

1392
01:15:11,442 --> 01:15:13,731
You are here to testify,
why are you singing songs?

1393
01:15:14,257 --> 01:15:16,998
My wife says everything
in the form of a song, sir.

1394
01:15:17,022 --> 01:15:18,165
Okay, carry on.

1395
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:21,272
We stayed in Swarna
Palace Hotel in Vijayawada.

1396
01:15:21,296 --> 01:15:24,441
We visited Goddess Kanaka
Durga Temple in the morning.

1397
01:15:24,465 --> 01:15:24,941
Good.

1398
01:15:25,043 --> 01:15:27,727
The priest there rotated
the holy fire before us.

1399
01:15:27,751 --> 01:15:30,421
After that we both
ate God's offerings.

1400
01:15:30,445 --> 01:15:32,654
We did circumambulations
in the temple.

1401
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:38,316
Darn! Because of you I lost
interest in giving a verdict.

1402
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:41,139
It would've been bearable
if you had a good voice.

1403
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:44,018
It sounds like someone put
stones in a can and is shaking it.

1404
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:45,196
Just ignore his words, dear.

1405
01:15:46,985 --> 01:15:47,973
Go ahead.

1406
01:15:48,266 --> 01:15:50,604
That's how we visited the temple.

1407
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:52,934
We booked return tickets to Kurnool.

1408
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:56,572
We reached Kurnool through Guntur,
via Srisailam.

1409
01:15:56,596 --> 01:16:00,625
Yes, you came and you saw.
I'm a short tempered man.

1410
01:16:00,649 --> 01:16:01,992
Don't test my patience.

1411
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,811
I'll tell you. Please don't get angry.

1412
01:16:05,877 --> 01:16:07,865
Calm down and listen to me.

1413
01:16:07,889 --> 01:16:08,833
Very good.

1414
01:16:11,619 --> 01:16:12,356
Sing.

1415
01:16:12,436 --> 01:16:15,937
And when we started walking
towards Kondareddy Fort..

1416
01:16:15,961 --> 01:16:19,037
..it started raining heavily
with lightning and thunder.

1417
01:16:19,061 --> 01:16:21,513
Then Varalaxmi came there.

1418
01:16:21,537 --> 01:16:25,981
She slit a man's throat
right in front of our eyes.

1419
01:16:26,293 --> 01:16:29,791
That poor man died on the spot.

1420
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:38,166
We were quivering
in fear when we saw it.

1421
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:42,064
Stop it. You are
destroying people's lives.

1422
01:16:42,088 --> 01:16:44,580
One of our lawyers
puked his guts out and..

1423
01:16:44,604 --> 01:16:46,119
..passed motion at the same time.

1424
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,979
Take him to the hospital.

1425
01:16:50,977 --> 01:16:52,204
I'm letting this slide
because according to..

1426
01:16:52,228 --> 01:16:54,383
..Indian Constitution,
we all have freedom of speech.

1427
01:16:54,407 --> 01:16:56,010
Otherwise I would've
filed a case against you.

1428
01:16:56,034 --> 01:16:57,530
Go ahead.

1429
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:01,691
You stop talking.
You are an eye witness too, right?

1430
01:17:01,715 --> 01:17:02,605
You are her husband, right?

1431
01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:04,856
You were there at the crime scene,
right? You tell me.

1432
01:17:04,999 --> 01:17:07,893
After that we left from there,
went home, took bath..

1433
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:10,140
..and had breakfast.
Then we felt sad that..

1434
01:17:10,164 --> 01:17:12,209
..the man who was
murdered was a reporter.

1435
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,872
So, we called the CI.

1436
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,615
Okay, everything is alright.

1437
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:18,316
But how did you know
that he was a reporter?

1438
01:17:18,379 --> 01:17:19,519
We guessed it, sir.

1439
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,645
Please note this point, Your Honor.
They guessed it.

1440
01:17:22,669 --> 01:17:24,731
Sorry, sir.
I just said it in my anxiety.

1441
01:17:24,755 --> 01:17:26,104
We didn't know that he was a reporter.

1442
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:27,960
Please note this point as well,
Your Honor.

1443
01:17:27,984 --> 01:17:29,094
He said it because of anxiety.

1444
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:32,818
- I mean..
- Forget that.

1445
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:34,636
What time did you reach Kurnool?

1446
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,896
We reached at 4:00 am.

1447
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,921
What time did you see the murder?

1448
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:39,300
We both saw it at 4:20 am with our eyes.

1449
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:40,445
You saw it at 4:20, right?

1450
01:17:40,472 --> 01:17:42,367
Sir, they are lying.

1451
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,968
You didn't witness any murder.

1452
01:17:47,284 --> 01:17:50,400
The bus from Vijayawada
to Kurnool AP20 5362..

1453
01:17:50,424 --> 01:17:52,514
..reached Kurnool at 4:45 am.

1454
01:17:52,538 --> 01:17:54,704
If you travelled in a bus
that reached Kurnool at 4:45 am..

1455
01:17:54,728 --> 01:17:57,752
..how did you see a murder
that happened at 4:20 am?

1456
01:18:02,554 --> 01:18:04,774
Kurnool RTC Bus Depot reports,
Your Honor.

1457
01:18:04,798 --> 01:18:05,982
I object, Your Honor.

1458
01:18:06,904 --> 01:18:08,432
He is misleading my witnesses..

1459
01:18:08,512 --> 01:18:10,504
..to help Varalaxmi
get away with the murder.

1460
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:13,039
If you give me 1,000 rupees..

1461
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:15,476
..I can create a 100 bills
and reports like this one.

1462
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,665
You can create them, sir.

1463
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:19,186
But you can't create
CCTV camera footage..

1464
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:23,699
..recorded at the RTC Bus Depot.

1465
01:18:23,723 --> 01:18:24,697
Darn!

1466
01:18:26,588 --> 01:18:27,634
The evidence, Your Honor.

1467
01:18:36,582 --> 01:18:38,358
They didn't go to Vijayawada that day.

1468
01:18:38,398 --> 01:18:41,243
The proof is their apartment's
CCTV camera footage.

1469
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:48,787
According to Section 192,
it is a crime to create false proofs.

1470
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:51,020
I request you to strictly
punish the CI who created..

1471
01:18:51,044 --> 01:18:51,788
..these false evidences.

1472
01:18:51,812 --> 01:18:55,093
My client Ms. Varalaxmi
is a person filled with humanity.

1473
01:18:55,117 --> 01:18:57,193
I request you to pronounce
her innocent and release her.

1474
01:18:57,648 --> 01:18:59,547
After hearing both sides,
the court orders an investigation..

1475
01:18:59,722 --> 01:19:02,676
..on CI Kiran Kumar who
has created false evidences..

1476
01:19:02,852 --> 01:19:05,630
..and the couple who
came in as false witnesses.

1477
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:09,826
The court suspends criminal
lawyer Chakravarthi from..

1478
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:13,732
..bar counsel for misleading
the court with false evidence..

1479
01:19:13,756 --> 01:19:16,645
..and annuls all the cases on
Ms. Varalaxmi..

1480
01:19:17,112 --> 01:19:18,401
..who helps everyone in the community.

1481
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:21,404
The court pronounces
her innocent and releases her.

1482
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:22,108
Darn!

1483
01:19:27,268 --> 01:19:29,250
Finally your son
defeated Chakravarthi.

1484
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:32,030
Right. Don't underestimate
Durga Rao's son.

1485
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:43,511
A broker's son will become a broker.

1486
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:49,413
Yes!

1487
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,486
- Thanks, Tenali.
- Thank you, madam.

1488
01:19:51,606 --> 01:19:52,532
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1489
01:19:52,612 --> 01:19:53,477
- Thank you.
- Congrats. - Well done.

1490
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:56,947
Tenali!

1491
01:19:58,363 --> 01:19:59,554
Congratulations!

1492
01:20:18,818 --> 01:20:19,698
Hey!

1493
01:20:24,092 --> 01:20:25,517
Catch him! Catch him!

1494
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:26,461
Catch him!

1495
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,048
Oh my God!

1496
01:20:32,217 --> 01:20:33,351
Put pressure on it.

1497
01:20:35,053 --> 01:20:35,888
Bhavani!

1498
01:20:36,475 --> 01:20:37,294
Madam!

1499
01:20:37,898 --> 01:20:39,470
Yes, madam! Are you okay?

1500
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:41,050
I'm okay. Who is he?

1501
01:20:44,259 --> 01:20:47,591
Find out if I've harmed him
in anyway knowingly or unknowingly.

1502
01:20:50,932 --> 01:20:52,885
Tenali went after him.
He won't let him get away.

1503
01:21:01,727 --> 01:21:03,291
Hey! Do you want to die?

1504
01:21:03,536 --> 01:21:04,324
Stupid people.

1505
01:21:12,799 --> 01:21:15,131
I'm a young guy and
even I'm panting for breath.

1506
01:21:15,156 --> 01:21:19,213
Do you need murder attempts
and chases at this age?

1507
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:22,751
It is a crime to kill a person.

1508
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,253
It is a great sin
to kill a good person.

1509
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:27,370
Who said she's a good lady?
Who said that?

1510
01:21:27,579 --> 01:21:29,665
Everyone thinks she's
a fish in the water.

1511
01:21:30,214 --> 01:21:32,959
But actually she's a
crocodile disguised as a fish.

1512
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:38,544
That's why she killed my son.

1513
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:48,527
Varalaxmi madam didn't
kill journalist Bhupal.

1514
01:21:48,776 --> 01:21:50,514
I just proved it in
the court and won the case.

1515
01:21:50,594 --> 01:21:52,789
If you don't believe me,
at least believe the court.

1516
01:21:53,056 --> 01:21:54,411
You want me to believe the court?

1517
01:21:54,635 --> 01:21:57,212
The evidence that the
court needs are not facts.

1518
01:21:57,554 --> 01:21:59,843
There is a fact that
you and they don't know.

1519
01:22:00,343 --> 01:22:02,017
She's the murderess.

1520
01:22:02,758 --> 01:22:03,914
She's the murderess.

1521
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,141
Very bad.
You tricked me.

1522
01:22:24,294 --> 01:22:25,695
Don't you have any humanity in you?

1523
01:22:25,827 --> 01:22:29,936
You joined as my employee,
ate my food, drank my water..

1524
01:22:29,982 --> 01:22:32,148
..and gathered proofs about
my third party properties..

1525
01:22:32,173 --> 01:22:35,563
..black money,
illegal businesses and hidden gold..

1526
01:22:35,588 --> 01:22:39,386
..to pass it to the media
and upload it on social media.

1527
01:22:43,614 --> 01:22:44,949
- Bhupal!
- Yes, madam?

1528
01:22:45,155 --> 01:22:46,229
Give me your phone.

1529
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:47,511
- Bhupal!
- Oh God!

1530
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:49,636
He's getting away! Rascal!

1531
01:22:55,539 --> 01:22:57,897
Do you think I'm yesteryear actress
Savitri to shoot a film about me?

1532
01:22:57,922 --> 01:22:59,431
You are like a pest
that ruins the crop.

1533
01:22:59,619 --> 01:23:01,661
You are deceiving poor
ones in the name of helping them.

1534
01:23:02,306 --> 01:23:04,850
You promised to build
houses for the poor people..

1535
01:23:05,576 --> 01:23:07,641
..took millions of rupees
from the banks as loans and..

1536
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:09,166
..kept that money for yourself.

1537
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:11,788
You destroyed many villages
in the name of a solar plant.

1538
01:23:12,078 --> 01:23:13,986
You stole billions and
billions of government money..

1539
01:23:14,011 --> 01:23:15,021
..in the name of contracts.

1540
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:19,369
Mines, sand, real estate,
you ate up everything except air.

1541
01:23:19,492 --> 01:23:21,326
And you did all this
with fake owned businesses.

1542
01:23:21,486 --> 01:23:22,638
The innocent public
doesn't know all this.

1543
01:23:22,663 --> 01:23:25,725
They put you on a
pedestal and worship you.

1544
01:23:25,907 --> 01:23:30,485
It's useless to read Gita
to a person who's in coma.

1545
01:23:33,434 --> 01:23:34,803
I should've known that
it is useless to talk to you.

1546
01:23:34,828 --> 01:23:35,615
It is a big mistake to kill me.

1547
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,681
Your political career will end today.

1548
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:03,905
She killed him.

1549
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:10,469
Nobody will understand the pain
of losing my young son in death.

1550
01:24:11,168 --> 01:24:12,532
You won't get it.

1551
01:24:13,975 --> 01:24:14,975
Nobody will.

1552
01:24:15,938 --> 01:24:17,254
Nobody will.

1553
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:29,449
Hey!

1554
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,493
Hey!

1555
01:24:42,683 --> 01:24:43,563
Stop!

1556
01:24:48,681 --> 01:24:49,381
Hey!

1557
01:25:17,173 --> 01:25:18,269
Let him go!

1558
01:25:26,783 --> 01:25:27,516
Madam!

1559
01:25:28,798 --> 01:25:31,964
Madam! Please let him go!
Please let him go!

1560
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:32,775
Madam!

1561
01:25:32,871 --> 01:25:33,950
Please madam!

1562
01:25:36,249 --> 01:25:37,716
No, madam! Please madam!

1563
01:25:37,796 --> 01:25:41,078
The Sumati Satakam says
that a mighty serpent..

1564
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:42,351
..dies at the hands of tiny ants.

1565
01:25:42,376 --> 01:25:48,168
But I'm not a serpent to
die in the hands of ants like you.

1566
01:25:48,749 --> 01:25:49,925
I'm a lioness.

1567
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,126
You and your son are
like a strand of hair.

1568
01:25:54,513 --> 01:25:58,199
And you tried to kill
me with a tiny knife?

1569
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,719
You think only you have tiny knives?
I don't have them?

1570
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:04,371
No! No!

1571
01:26:04,396 --> 01:26:05,556
Hey!

1572
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:08,719
Quiet!

1573
01:26:10,056 --> 01:26:13,477
I'm not good, Mr. Lawyer.
I'm very bad.

1574
01:26:15,815 --> 01:26:16,773
Hey!

1575
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:52,595
I love money and power, Mr. Lawyer.

1576
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:54,499
And if anybody
stands in my way...

1577
01:26:55,181 --> 01:26:56,281
I kill them.

1578
01:26:57,437 --> 01:27:00,156
I'll spare your life hoping
that you won't stand in my way.

1579
01:27:01,336 --> 01:27:02,393
Got it?

1580
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,043
- Listen!
- Yes?

1581
01:27:23,173 --> 01:27:26,677
It is raining.
Make some chili fritters for me.

1582
01:27:26,702 --> 01:27:27,532
Okay.

1583
01:27:27,557 --> 01:27:31,438
It will be awesome to enjoy
a drink with the chili fritters.

1584
01:27:31,463 --> 01:27:32,490
Nothing doing.

1585
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:36,722
Tenali is back.

1586
01:27:45,912 --> 01:27:47,520
Why did you sit there?

1587
01:27:48,217 --> 01:27:49,236
What happened to him?

1588
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,440
Tenali, what's wrong?
 What happened?

1589
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:53,486
- Tenali.
- Son!

1590
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:55,544
- Why are you sitting here?
- Tell us.

1591
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:57,049
Why are you sitting in the rain?
Let's go inside.

1592
01:27:57,074 --> 01:27:57,857
Let's go, son.

1593
01:27:58,619 --> 01:27:59,832
What's the matter?

1594
01:28:02,295 --> 01:28:03,496
She killed him, Mom.

1595
01:28:04,764 --> 01:28:06,994
She killed him before my eyes.

1596
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:08,866
Who are you talking about?

1597
01:28:09,069 --> 01:28:10,893
Varalaxmi Devi is not a good woman.

1598
01:28:12,808 --> 01:28:15,359
I defended a murderer
who should be in prison.

1599
01:28:15,674 --> 01:28:17,968
I didn't know that
she is the murderer.

1600
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:24,770
She killed a man cruelly
in front of my eyes.

1601
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:30,814
If I hadn't taken up her case,
that man would've been alive.

1602
01:28:31,153 --> 01:28:33,136
You brought her out thinking
that she's a good woman.

1603
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:34,992
That's not your fault.

1604
01:28:35,405 --> 01:28:38,359
You believed a lie and
helped Varalaxmi to win.

1605
01:28:38,525 --> 01:28:41,412
It won't be difficult
for you to prove the truth.

1606
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,904
She's not invincible.

1607
01:28:44,044 --> 01:28:45,896
I'm sure she made a mistake
while committing murders.

1608
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,467
If you can find it,
you can put her behind the barts.

1609
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:51,027
If you can find one evidence..

1610
01:28:51,854 --> 01:28:53,786
..you can reopen
the case in High Court.

1611
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:19,394
Give me a cup of tea.

1612
01:29:21,507 --> 01:29:22,429
Thanks.

1613
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,047
What's your name, kid?

1614
01:29:30,127 --> 01:29:31,110
Ramu.

1615
01:29:31,356 --> 01:29:33,147
- Do you come here every day?
- Yes.

1616
01:29:33,364 --> 01:29:34,192
What time?

1617
01:29:34,272 --> 01:29:36,185
I come here at 4:00 every morning.

1618
01:29:39,255 --> 01:29:43,912
Ramu, someone was
killed her on August 8th.

1619
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:45,772
Were you here that day as well?

1620
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:48,179
It was raining that day.
So I didn't come.

1621
01:29:49,756 --> 01:29:53,255
But even if there
is rain or hailstorm..

1622
01:29:53,335 --> 01:29:55,301
..even if the Kurnool
town is flooded..

1623
01:29:55,326 --> 01:29:59,064
..there's a family that
walks around the fort..

1624
01:29:59,089 --> 01:30:00,249
..at 4:00 every morning.

1625
01:30:02,081 --> 01:30:03,214
Do you know their names?

1626
01:30:03,383 --> 01:30:06,256
His name is Kovelakuntla Kishore.

1627
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,177
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1628
01:30:14,257 --> 01:30:16,575
Do you know where
Kovelakuntla Kishore lives?

1629
01:30:16,655 --> 01:30:19,322
Kovelakuntla Kishore?
That's the house.

1630
01:30:27,967 --> 01:30:29,489
Why are you pacing like that?

1631
01:30:29,569 --> 01:30:31,182
I'm scared, Grandma.

1632
01:30:33,627 --> 01:30:35,149
Every time I open my
eyes or close my eyes..

1633
01:30:35,174 --> 01:30:36,685
..I remember Varalaxmi
Devi killing that man.

1634
01:30:37,926 --> 01:30:39,818
Why did you give
birth to this idiot?

1635
01:30:39,956 --> 01:30:42,109
If anybody sees us,
they will think we killed that man.

1636
01:30:42,189 --> 01:30:42,999
Idiot!

1637
01:30:43,232 --> 01:30:45,592
- You know him.
- Here, eat this carrot.

1638
01:30:46,334 --> 01:30:47,201
Will this reduce my anxiety?

1639
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:48,069
No, it won't.

1640
01:30:51,401 --> 01:30:52,446
Hello, Grandma!

1641
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,936
I think he's Varalaxmi's man.

1642
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,055
Shut up!

1643
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:59,361
Are you a Gram Volunteer?
Did you bring all the goods?

1644
01:31:01,394 --> 01:31:02,945
No, I'm not a Gram Volunteer.

1645
01:31:03,047 --> 01:31:04,194
Are you a papery boy?

1646
01:31:07,008 --> 01:31:09,479
Grandma!
I'm Tenali Ramakrishna, BA BL.

1647
01:31:09,713 --> 01:31:10,714
I'm a lawyer.

1648
01:31:11,304 --> 01:31:14,027
I told you. Lawyer means police.
Police means lawyer.

1649
01:31:14,107 --> 01:31:15,196
Shut up.

1650
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:18,560
- What do we have to do with lawyers?
- What do we have to do with them?

1651
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,126
- We don't have any cases on us.
- We don't.

1652
01:31:20,206 --> 01:31:21,612
Oh no, there is no case on you.

1653
01:31:21,637 --> 01:31:22,932
But you are in a case.

1654
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:23,971
- Case?
- Case?

1655
01:31:24,338 --> 01:31:24,869
What is he saying?

1656
01:31:24,894 --> 01:31:26,355
Why will we be in a case?
Mind your tongue.

1657
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,641
Sir, please hear me out.

1658
01:31:27,653 --> 01:31:29,075
Does your whole family go for a walk..

1659
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,390
..at 4:00 am every
morning at Kondareddy Fort?

1660
01:31:31,415 --> 01:31:32,667
Yes, we go as a family.

1661
01:31:32,692 --> 01:31:33,453
For brisk walking.

1662
01:31:33,478 --> 01:31:35,076
Did you go for walking
on 8th August..

1663
01:31:35,101 --> 01:31:37,019
..even though it
was raining heavily?

1664
01:31:37,121 --> 01:31:38,219
Yes, we did. So what?

1665
01:31:38,321 --> 01:31:39,609
Did you witness a murder there?

1666
01:31:40,896 --> 01:31:42,322
Why would we witness a murder?

1667
01:31:43,602 --> 01:31:44,704
You witnessed it.

1668
01:31:44,943 --> 01:31:46,767
Did you see us seeing it?

1669
01:31:47,236 --> 01:31:49,337
- No.
- So we didn't see it.

1670
01:31:53,244 --> 01:31:55,278
You are telling a
lie with so much courage.

1671
01:31:55,797 --> 01:31:57,167
Why are you afraid
to tell the truth?

1672
01:31:57,775 --> 01:32:00,321
No way. We are not
afraid of anything.

1673
01:32:01,532 --> 01:32:03,110
I think you came
to the wrong address.

1674
01:32:03,302 --> 01:32:04,874
I came to the right address.

1675
01:32:05,444 --> 01:32:06,656
You know that too.

1676
01:32:07,228 --> 01:32:10,798
Grandma, the man who
died is your grandson's age.

1677
01:32:11,195 --> 01:32:14,393
Would you do the same thing
if this happened to your grandson?

1678
01:32:16,919 --> 01:32:18,870
That young man died for a truth.

1679
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:21,426
If you can come and
testify in the court..

1680
01:32:21,638 --> 01:32:23,293
..at least his death
will have a meaning.

1681
01:32:24,034 --> 01:32:27,891
Our lives are more important
than lies and truths, son.

1682
01:32:30,942 --> 01:32:31,819
You are right.

1683
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:33,896
Why should we bother
about law and justice?

1684
01:32:34,188 --> 01:32:36,341
Our lives are important to us.

1685
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:45,522
There are human beings
in this house, but no humanity.

1686
01:32:46,839 --> 01:32:47,821
Wait a minute.

1687
01:32:49,706 --> 01:32:51,132
We'll testify.

1688
01:32:52,106 --> 01:32:53,182
Wait, Grandma.

1689
01:32:53,207 --> 01:32:56,858
We've no idea about
humans or humanity.

1690
01:32:56,883 --> 01:32:59,349
But I feel there's
sincerity in your fight.

1691
01:32:59,956 --> 01:33:03,556
We are ready to support you.
We'll testify.

1692
01:33:04,733 --> 01:33:05,805
Thank you, brother.

1693
01:33:07,142 --> 01:33:08,049
Thank you.

1694
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:17,056
Tenali Ramakrishna has
reopened the case in High Court.

1695
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,217
You are the only
one who can stop her.

1696
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:25,799
I can stop Polavaram
Project but not her.

1697
01:33:27,498 --> 01:33:29,145
Ma'am, please calm down.

1698
01:33:29,225 --> 01:33:31,036
Do you think what I did is wrong?
Is it wrong?

1699
01:33:31,646 --> 01:33:32,726
It's not wrong.

1700
01:33:35,061 --> 01:33:36,283
It's better to sit here quietly.

1701
01:33:36,363 --> 01:33:38,223
You think it is right
to murder someone? Is it right?

1702
01:33:39,129 --> 01:33:40,047
It's wrong.

1703
01:33:40,127 --> 01:33:42,229
Correct. Murdering someone is wrong.

1704
01:33:42,354 --> 01:33:44,203
But is it wrong for me to do it?

1705
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:46,127
Mom! How much wealth do we have?

1706
01:33:46,151 --> 01:33:48,983
Around 50 billion, baby.

1707
01:33:49,335 --> 01:33:52,883
I own 50 billion, is it
wrong for me to kill one person?

1708
01:33:52,907 --> 01:33:54,794
It's not as simple as
painting with colors, madam.

1709
01:33:54,818 --> 01:33:57,067
You killed a man and
painted with his blood.

1710
01:33:58,198 --> 01:33:59,431
Sorry, madam.

1711
01:34:00,405 --> 01:34:01,451
One murder.

1712
01:34:01,722 --> 01:34:03,076
Only one murder.

1713
01:34:03,386 --> 01:34:05,024
So many people died in the tsunami.

1714
01:34:05,048 --> 01:34:07,224
Hundreds of people
died in the Titli storm.

1715
01:34:07,248 --> 01:34:08,534
Did they file a case on them?

1716
01:34:08,558 --> 01:34:10,558
This crazy lady doesn't
know the difference between..

1717
01:34:10,582 --> 01:34:12,393
..natural disasters and
people committing murders.

1718
01:34:12,517 --> 01:34:17,273
Why do you worry so much?
Just kill that Tenali too.

1719
01:34:17,297 --> 01:34:20,047
He's not sleeping so that
you can kill him easily. He's alert.

1720
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,062
Kill him it seems..

1721
01:34:22,377 --> 01:34:26,677
Either Tenali should be
afraid of us or those witnesses..

1722
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:29,040
..only then we can win.

1723
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,010
Get it done.

1724
01:34:31,034 --> 01:34:32,769
Leave that to us, ma'am.

1725
01:34:33,605 --> 01:34:36,170
We will find a way to scare them.

1726
01:34:37,475 --> 01:34:38,505
Come here.

1727
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:40,211
Is there nobody at home?

1728
01:34:40,235 --> 01:34:41,404
They vacated the house, sir.

1729
01:34:41,428 --> 01:34:43,161
- Don't you know where they went?
- No, sir.

1730
01:34:43,185 --> 01:34:44,684
They were here a few days ago.

1731
01:34:44,708 --> 01:34:46,222
I think he has moved the
witnesses to a safer place.

1732
01:34:46,246 --> 01:34:47,177
- You think so?
- Yes.

1733
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:48,157
Okay, let's go.

1734
01:34:49,991 --> 01:34:52,200
Run! Faster!

1735
01:34:52,224 --> 01:34:53,165
Oh God!

1736
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:54,823
Stop! I said stop!

1737
01:34:54,847 --> 01:34:56,125
As if we'll stop.

1738
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:58,256
How dare you file
a case on our madam?

1739
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,250
Run!

1740
01:35:00,876 --> 01:35:03,201
- Run! Hurry up!
- Dad, come here.

1741
01:35:03,225 --> 01:35:05,251
- Come here.
- What took you so long?

1742
01:35:05,462 --> 01:35:06,975
What's in the bag?
Did you bring bombs?

1743
01:35:06,999 --> 01:35:07,602
No bombs.

1744
01:35:07,626 --> 01:35:08,210
Then?

1745
01:35:08,234 --> 01:35:09,276
- Burqas.
- Burqas?

1746
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,949
- Okay, everyone put them on.
- Give me one.

1747
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:13,074
This is a brilliant idea.

1748
01:35:15,698 --> 01:35:16,570
Hurry up!

1749
01:35:20,027 --> 01:35:21,289
Madam! Madam!

1750
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:23,788
Five people came running this way.
Did you see them?

1751
01:35:23,812 --> 01:35:26,784
Our five people and your
five people are different.

1753
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,432
Madam!

1754
01:35:29,763 --> 01:35:31,058
Just a minute.

(Hindu Devotional Song)

1756
01:35:36,475 --> 01:35:39,090
We six Muslim woman
are walking on the road.

1757
01:35:39,114 --> 01:35:41,122
I'll talk to you later.

1758
01:35:41,146 --> 01:35:42,580
- Are you a Muslim?
- Yeah.

1759
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:44,321
Why do you have a Lord Venkatesha's
song as your phone ringtone?

1760
01:35:44,345 --> 01:35:46,278
- She will explain.
- What kind of question is that?

1761
01:35:46,302 --> 01:35:48,814
Our Bibi Nancharamma got married to..

1762
01:35:48,838 --> 01:35:50,741
..your Lord Venkatesha.
So we all are united.

1763
01:35:50,765 --> 01:35:51,493
That's right.

1764
01:35:51,517 --> 01:35:54,123
We are getting late to
go to the mosque. Let's go.

1765
01:35:54,147 --> 01:35:56,139
Okay, go.
Hey, wait a minute.

1766
01:35:56,163 --> 01:35:58,288
Ladies don't go to the mosque.

1767
01:35:58,783 --> 01:36:00,758
If we can't go to the mosque,
we'll go to the temple.

1768
01:36:00,782 --> 01:36:02,450
Why do you think so much, cute boy?

1769
01:36:02,665 --> 01:36:03,233
Let's go.

1770
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:04,725
Allah will grant your wishes.

1771
01:36:04,749 --> 01:36:05,837
Okay, please go.

1772
01:36:07,663 --> 01:36:08,876
What happened? Did you catch them?

1773
01:36:08,956 --> 01:36:10,207
No, they got away.

1774
01:36:10,763 --> 01:36:12,067
What do we do now?

1775
01:36:12,091 --> 01:36:15,185
I've another plan.

1776
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:19,918
I'm already frustrated
that I have no cases on hand.

1777
01:36:19,998 --> 01:36:22,464
Don't disturb me. Listen to me.

1778
01:36:22,488 --> 01:36:24,973
I've no cases on hand.
So, don't irritate me.

Hey..

1784
01:36:49,315 --> 01:36:51,823
I'm sorry.
I bumped into you on purpose.

1785
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:53,144
Did I cause you any pain?

1786
01:36:53,168 --> 01:36:56,484
It's a bit painful,
but it's a sweet pain.

1787
01:36:56,508 --> 01:36:57,376
Oh.

1788
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,105
So, why did you bump into me?

1789
01:36:59,129 --> 01:37:02,106
When I'm sad,
I bump into a man's body..

1790
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:03,808
..then my whole body relaxes.

1791
01:37:03,832 --> 01:37:07,269
Very nice habit. What's your name?

1792
01:37:07,293 --> 01:37:08,612
Chammak Chandrika.

1793
01:37:08,636 --> 01:37:10,297
- Nice name.
- Thank you.

1794
01:37:10,321 --> 01:37:14,410
A woman like you should
be in a temple, not at the court.

1795
01:37:14,434 --> 01:37:16,623
Since I'm spending
my time at the temple..

1796
01:37:16,647 --> 01:37:18,496
..my husband is spending
his time with the neighbor.

1797
01:37:19,431 --> 01:37:21,246
That's why I had
to come to the court.

1798
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:23,052
So, you are married?

1799
01:37:23,449 --> 01:37:26,813
A betel leaf has to turn
into a 'Paan' at some point..

1800
01:37:27,561 --> 01:37:29,623
..and a girl has
to get married one day.

1801
01:37:29,647 --> 01:37:30,834
- Lust.
- What?

1802
01:37:30,858 --> 01:37:32,194
I mean yes.

1803
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:36,442
I want to hug you and cry. May I?

1804
01:37:36,466 --> 01:37:41,798
This is the court.
But you need comfort, right?

1805
01:37:42,165 --> 01:37:43,383
Come here.

1806
01:37:45,532 --> 01:37:46,764
I'm sorry.

1807
01:37:46,788 --> 01:37:50,005
I know why your husband
is going after other woman.

1808
01:37:50,249 --> 01:37:54,212
My husband and I
are living together..

1809
01:37:54,236 --> 01:37:55,878
..but we are not
happy in our marriage.

1810
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:57,010
Why?

1811
01:37:57,213 --> 01:38:00,481
Please come to my house
and change my husband.

1812
01:38:00,505 --> 01:38:02,977
Please save my marriage.

1813
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:05,972
Let's go to your house.

1814
01:38:07,952 --> 01:38:09,917
Please come. This is my home.

1815
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:12,132
Call your husband.

1816
01:38:12,156 --> 01:38:13,466
Hubby!

1817
01:38:16,984 --> 01:38:20,506
- Hello!
- Hello!

1818
01:38:20,530 --> 01:38:22,271
Hello.. Who are these guys?

1819
01:38:22,295 --> 01:38:25,265
That one is my first husband
and this one is my last.

1820
01:38:25,289 --> 01:38:26,662
What about the guys in the middle?

1821
01:38:26,686 --> 01:38:30,104
All these are..
I feel shy to say it.

1822
01:38:30,128 --> 01:38:32,386
Shut up!
Don't kill me with your coyness.

1823
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:33,455
Who are all the guys in the middle?

1824
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:35,472
- They all.. In between.. In between..
- Shut up!

1825
01:38:35,544 --> 01:38:37,447
They all are my in between husbands.

1826
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:38,139
So many?

1827
01:38:38,163 --> 01:38:40,024
I have a big..

1828
01:38:40,912 --> 01:38:42,222
- What?
- Heart.

1829
01:38:42,246 --> 01:38:43,627
That's why I gave
my heart to all of them.

1830
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,413
Your heart is not a bank
loan to give it to everyone.

1831
01:38:45,437 --> 01:38:46,579
Did you see how many are there?

1832
01:38:46,603 --> 01:38:48,883
They can make an IPL 
m.
They just need a coach.

1833
01:38:48,907 --> 01:38:50,788
Why can't you be the coach?

1834
01:38:50,812 --> 01:38:51,649
Shut up!

1835
01:38:51,856 --> 01:38:53,818
It's not wrong for you
to live with so many men..

1836
01:38:53,842 --> 01:38:55,527
..but your husband can't be with another woman?

1837
01:38:55,551 --> 01:38:57,968
And you want me to
defend your case? I won't.

1838
01:38:57,992 --> 01:38:59,227
You rascal!

1839
01:38:59,251 --> 01:39:01,478
Rascal? How dare you!

1840
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:04,506
Have you gone mad because
of so many husbands?

1841
01:39:04,586 --> 01:39:05,825
Why did you hit me?

1842
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:07,589
Why did you hit me?

1843
01:39:08,059 --> 01:39:09,955
Where did you hide the witnesses?

1844
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:11,035
In my shoes.

1845
01:39:11,059 --> 01:39:12,046
Is that a joke?

1846
01:39:13,074 --> 01:39:14,192
Oh no...!

1847
01:39:14,216 --> 01:39:16,594
Oh God! Oh no!

1848
01:39:23,718 --> 01:39:26,303
Tell me!
Where did you hide the witnesses?

1849
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:29,820
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1850
01:39:32,962 --> 01:39:34,041
Let me go!

1851
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:38,580
Where are the witnesses?

1852
01:39:38,744 --> 01:39:39,655
Tell me or you'll die!

1853
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:41,092
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

1854
01:39:41,116 --> 01:39:43,532
I've a friend named Giri.
I sent them to his house.

1855
01:39:49,106 --> 01:39:51,105
Who are you? Why are you so ugly?

1856
01:39:51,262 --> 01:39:53,458
My name is Chammak Chandrika.

1857
01:39:53,482 --> 01:39:54,236
Chammak?

1858
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:55,125
Chandrika.

1859
01:39:55,149 --> 01:39:55,925
I see.

1860
01:39:58,847 --> 01:40:02,796
- I freshly moved into the next house.
- Freshly?

1861
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,255
Can I come into your house?

1862
01:40:04,279 --> 01:40:06,609
Put your left leg
first and step inside.

1863
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:08,642
Tell me, Chammak.
What can I do for you?

1864
01:40:10,293 --> 01:40:11,527
Why is she crying?

1865
01:40:11,551 --> 01:40:13,660
I want marriage.

1866
01:40:13,684 --> 01:40:15,854
- Marriage?
- I want marriage.

1867
01:40:15,878 --> 01:40:17,972
Usually people ask the
neighbors for milk or yogurt.

1868
01:40:17,996 --> 01:40:19,763
What do you mean you want marriage?

1869
01:40:20,209 --> 01:40:21,827
- I want marriage.
- Marriage?

1870
01:40:21,851 --> 01:40:23,752
I want someone to
put off the fire in me.

1871
01:40:23,776 --> 01:40:26,372
Put off the fire?
Do you want me to do that?

1872
01:40:26,396 --> 01:40:29,944
You can't put off the fire in me.

1873
01:40:29,968 --> 01:40:31,821
You want all the Avengers
to come and help you out?

1874
01:40:31,845 --> 01:40:35,611
No need. I just want Kishore
who is hiding in your house.

1875
01:40:37,367 --> 01:40:38,301
Kishore?

1876
01:40:38,325 --> 01:40:38,980
Kishore?

1877
01:40:39,004 --> 01:40:44,812
Yes, he fell in love with me.
He said he'll marry me.

1878
01:40:44,836 --> 01:40:47,927
Then he deceived me.

1879
01:40:48,506 --> 01:40:49,425
I deceived her?

1880
01:40:50,234 --> 01:40:51,978
Did he make you pregnant?

1881
01:40:52,002 --> 01:40:53,131
I can't become pregnant.

1882
01:40:53,155 --> 01:40:54,094
Why not?

1883
01:40:54,118 --> 01:40:55,336
Oh that, okay.

1884
01:40:56,856 --> 01:40:58,667
Bro, your friend is here.

1885
01:40:59,694 --> 01:41:00,860
Who are you?

1886
01:41:04,048 --> 01:41:05,120
Kishore!

1887
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,101
- Kishore!
- What a loving couple!

1888
01:41:07,413 --> 01:41:08,348
I'm okay..

1889
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:11,160
You are uglier than
the ugly faces that..

1890
01:41:11,184 --> 01:41:13,132
..Google shows up when
you type ugly face. Who are you?

1891
01:41:13,156 --> 01:41:16,081
Wait a minute.
Turn that side. Turn this side.

1892
01:41:16,105 --> 01:41:17,005
Should I turn back as well?

1893
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,562
- No, I'm already feeling giddy.
- Oh no!

1894
01:41:18,586 --> 01:41:19,804
Don't touch me.

1895
01:41:19,879 --> 01:41:21,066
You don't have any beauty.

1896
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:22,471
You don't even look like a woman.

1897
01:41:22,495 --> 01:41:23,809
How can I deceive you?

1898
01:41:24,014 --> 01:41:27,685
Your whole family deceived me.

1899
01:41:28,612 --> 01:41:30,957
Your mother,
your father, your grandmother..

1900
01:41:30,981 --> 01:41:33,156
..promised me that they
will get me married to you..

1901
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:34,408
..but they deceived me.

1902
01:41:34,432 --> 01:41:35,834
- Come on, let's go down.
- Wait there.

1903
01:41:35,858 --> 01:41:37,481
Come here.
Did you promise her that..

1904
01:41:37,505 --> 01:41:39,293
..you'll get me married to her?
You didn't find anyone else?

1905
01:41:39,317 --> 01:41:41,679
When did we say we'll
get you married to him?

1906
01:41:41,703 --> 01:41:44,852
You don't know me.
Don't mess with me.

1907
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,440
Show me your face.

1908
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:49,544
Turn around.

1909
01:41:49,568 --> 01:41:51,024
I had the same reaction.

1910
01:41:51,048 --> 01:41:53,307
Wretched woman!
When did I promise you that..

1911
01:41:53,331 --> 01:41:56,063
..I'll get you married
to my grandson? He's a good boy.

1912
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:59,325
Do you have any
other family members?

1913
01:41:59,349 --> 01:42:01,319
Shut up! This is our family.

1914
01:42:01,343 --> 01:42:03,827
A small family is a happy family.

1915
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:05,985
What a stupid family!

1916
01:42:06,009 --> 01:42:07,506
How did you change your voice?

1917
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:12,522
Oh God! The bad guys!

1918
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,588
Don't worry, I have a plan.

1919
01:42:14,612 --> 01:42:15,469
Complan?

1920
01:42:15,493 --> 01:42:17,740
No, Boost.
We'll use it there. Let's go.

1921
01:42:20,286 --> 01:42:21,321
I thought we were running away.

1922
01:42:21,345 --> 01:42:22,837
Why did you bring us
all to Varalaxmi's house?

1923
01:42:22,861 --> 01:42:25,405
This is your lawyer
Tenali Ramakrishna's style.

1924
01:42:25,429 --> 01:42:27,545
We shouldn't run away,
we'll come to a compromise.

1925
01:42:27,569 --> 01:42:29,437
Maybe Tenali forgot about it.

1926
01:42:29,566 --> 01:42:31,910
I'll go and convince Varalaxmi
for a compromise. Wait here.

1927
01:42:31,934 --> 01:42:33,235
"A beautiful white sari"

1928
01:42:33,844 --> 01:42:35,217
"Your hair adorned with jasmines"

1929
01:42:35,859 --> 01:42:36,911
Hi, auntie!

1930
01:42:38,953 --> 01:42:41,023
I came here to make
a deal with you, auntie.

1931
01:42:41,705 --> 01:42:43,138
Should I explain it, auntie?

1932
01:42:45,712 --> 01:42:47,089
Why are you looking
at me like that, auntie?

1933
01:42:49,852 --> 01:42:51,747
Why are they hitting me
while I'm talking to you, auntie?

1934
01:42:51,771 --> 01:42:53,950
Why are these crazy
guys hitting me, auntie?

1935
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:55,936
Stop it! Stop it!

1936
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,465
Ask them to stop, auntie.

1937
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:59,926
Did I say something wrong, auntie?

1938
01:43:03,707 --> 01:43:05,727
Compromise is taking too much time, Dad.

1939
01:43:05,751 --> 01:43:06,795
Too much time.

1940
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:08,282
At least you stop them, big auntie.

1941
01:43:08,306 --> 01:43:10,500
How dare you call me big auntie?

1942
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:15,714
Stop it. Do you think
my head is a coconut?

1943
01:43:15,738 --> 01:43:16,522
What if it breaks?

1944
01:43:16,546 --> 01:43:19,689
You look like a street
vendor that sells sweets.

1945
01:43:19,713 --> 01:43:22,517
How dare you call
my daughter auntie?

1946
01:43:23,145 --> 01:43:25,686
Oh. Are you hitting
me for calling her auntie?

1947
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:27,366
Should I call her big sister?

1948
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:28,874
Should I call her baby?

1949
01:43:29,577 --> 01:43:31,109
What should I call her then?

1950
01:43:31,133 --> 01:43:32,754
Madam, please say something.

1951
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:37,523
That's right. Call her madam.

1952
01:43:37,547 --> 01:43:38,494
Auntie!

1953
01:43:38,518 --> 01:43:40,005
Oh God! Not again!

1954
01:43:40,911 --> 01:43:41,925
What's the matter?

1955
01:43:41,964 --> 01:43:44,791
Okay, I'll tell you.
Did you kill Bhupal..

1956
01:43:44,815 --> 01:43:47,364
..the journalist who works
for the magazine The Truth?

1957
01:43:47,497 --> 01:43:48,466
Is it true or not?

1958
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:49,925
I killed him. So what?

1959
01:43:49,949 --> 01:43:53,580
Since you killed him,
confess it in the court tomorrow.

1960
01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:54,715
You'll be punished for it and..

1961
01:43:54,739 --> 01:43:56,266
..Mr. Raghuram's
soul will rest in peace.

1962
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:58,264
If you come to a compromise,
the case will be closed.

1963
01:43:59,158 --> 01:44:01,101
No, you will be closed.

1964
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:03,131
Journalist Bhupal
created a report about..

1965
01:44:03,155 --> 01:44:07,313
..my fake owned businesses
and my criminal records.

1966
01:44:07,477 --> 01:44:11,096
That's why I killed him.
I killed his father too.

1967
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:15,557
I'll crush everyone that comes
in the way of my political career.

1968
01:44:15,581 --> 01:44:16,295
Okay.

1969
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:19,041
I'll tell you who should
come to a compromise.

1970
01:44:19,065 --> 01:44:20,601
Send those witnesses to me.

1971
01:44:35,938 --> 01:44:37,095
Yes, I'm fine.

1972
01:44:42,199 --> 01:44:43,499
Hey.. What happened, bro?

1973
01:44:43,695 --> 01:44:47,185
Nothing. We've reached a compromise.
All okay.

1974
01:44:47,209 --> 01:44:50,073
Superb, bro.
So, she agreed to go to prison?

1975
01:44:50,097 --> 01:44:54,634
Yes. But she wants to talk
to you before she goes to jail.

1976
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:55,938
- Go upstairs.
- Okay, makes sense. Come.

1977
01:44:56,058 --> 01:44:59,253
Wait, bro. She likes being
called auntie. She loves it.

1978
01:44:59,277 --> 01:45:00,602
- Yes.
- That info is enough for me.

1979
01:45:00,626 --> 01:45:03,964
I'll call her auntie so
many times that she'll be floored.

1980
01:45:03,988 --> 01:45:05,065
Yes, go ahead.

1981
01:45:06,018 --> 01:45:07,779
Call her auntie.
Say hello to big auntie too.

1982
01:45:07,803 --> 01:45:08,575
Thank you.

1983
01:45:08,942 --> 01:45:11,156
- Come on.
- Here we are.

1984
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,613
The house is very cool
like cooling glasses.

1985
01:45:13,637 --> 01:45:16,725
How many people did you
kill to build such a big house?

1986
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:20,779
She means that you must've
worked so hard to build it.

1987
01:45:23,485 --> 01:45:24,863
- Hello, auntie.
- Hello, auntie.

1988
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:28,997
Stop it! We've already
come to a compromise. Silly men.

1989
01:45:30,332 --> 01:45:31,965
So, I heard you confessed about..

1990
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:34,140
..killing the journalist
Bhupal, auntie.

1991
01:45:34,525 --> 01:45:35,981
We are very happy, auntie.

1992
01:45:37,444 --> 01:45:41,020
Hey, stop it! Stop it!
Ask them to stop it, auntie!

1993
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:43,203
Have you both gone blind?

1994
01:45:44,182 --> 01:45:46,761
He's my father.
Don't hit him like that.

1995
01:45:49,159 --> 01:45:50,125
Stop them, auntie!

1996
01:45:51,948 --> 01:45:53,655
You look like the overseer
of Uncle's Association.

1997
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:55,357
How dare you call our ma'am auntie?

1998
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:58,304
Oh, I got it. Sorry, madam.

1999
01:45:58,328 --> 01:46:00,952
A stupid man gave
me wrong information.

2000
01:46:01,059 --> 01:46:04,092
I shouldn't call you auntie.
I know that now.

2001
01:46:04,116 --> 01:46:06,299
I should call you madam.
Is that right, madam?

2002
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:07,816
Sorry, madam.

2003
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,066
Did you see my daughter
murdering that man?

2004
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:11,171
Yes, we did.

2005
01:46:12,383 --> 01:46:13,463
Don't hit us.

2006
01:46:14,072 --> 01:46:16,120
Will you testify in the court?

2007
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,216
Yes, we will.

2008
01:46:19,227 --> 01:46:21,657
We'll say whatever
you want us to say.

2009
01:46:22,502 --> 01:46:25,879
Now you are on the right track.
Very good.

2010
01:46:28,355 --> 01:46:30,265
What is so amusing in this situation?

2011
01:46:30,289 --> 01:46:32,056
I thought they won't hit ladies.

2012
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,643
But your mother is getting hit too.

2013
01:46:33,667 --> 01:46:35,571
Your mother got hit too. Shut up.

2014
01:46:35,595 --> 01:46:37,175
The circumstances
are not favorable to us.

2015
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,905
What should we do when the
circumstances are not favorable?

2016
01:46:39,929 --> 01:46:42,209
We shouldn't go to
catch fish in the sea.

2017
01:46:44,061 --> 01:46:46,877
Why did I give birth
to such a stupid man?

2018
01:46:48,488 --> 01:46:49,628
How dare you slap your own father?

2019
01:46:49,678 --> 01:46:51,582
You'll die if they beat you up.

2020
01:46:52,063 --> 01:46:55,127
I understood everything.
You didn't murder anyone.

2021
01:46:55,151 --> 01:46:57,841
Tenali Ramakrishna beat us up and..

2022
01:46:57,865 --> 01:46:59,598
..forced us to testify against you.

2023
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:03,470
If you say that, you'll live.
If you say the truth, you'll die.

2024
01:47:03,494 --> 01:47:03,990
Okay.

2025
01:47:04,014 --> 01:47:06,082
Be ready to come to
the court tomorrow morning.

2026
01:47:06,106 --> 01:47:06,738
Okay.

2027
01:47:07,952 --> 01:47:09,818
Rukmini, shall we have breakfast?

2028
01:47:10,303 --> 01:47:11,196
Rukmini!

2029
01:47:12,145 --> 01:47:14,369
You've been avoiding
me for a month now.

2030
01:47:14,865 --> 01:47:17,150
This is unacceptable.
It's not fair at all.

2031
01:47:18,734 --> 01:47:22,214
I'm really surprised that
you are talking about being fair.

2032
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:23,583
Shut up, Rukmini, will you?

2033
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:27,406
Are you so blinded by
that Tenali's charm that..

2034
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:29,910
..you are insulting the
father who taught you to speak?

2035
01:47:30,446 --> 01:47:32,483
Within a few days, mark my words..

2036
01:47:33,027 --> 01:47:36,216
..Tenali will sell his black
coat and open a roadside tea stall.

2037
01:47:36,757 --> 01:47:38,922
Then you'll realize my value.

2038
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:42,785
Value is not about money
or mango orchards, Dad.

2039
01:47:43,335 --> 01:47:46,484
Value is about honesty and goodness.

2040
01:47:52,117 --> 01:47:54,348
Rukmini, your father may
be a bad man for outsiders..

2041
01:47:54,372 --> 01:47:56,017
..but he's been
a good father to you.

2042
01:47:56,041 --> 01:47:57,317
How can we send you
as a daughter in law..

2043
01:47:57,341 --> 01:47:59,316
..into a family that gives
false testimonies in the court?

2044
01:47:59,636 --> 01:48:03,285
How can we get you married
to that incapable lawyer?

2045
01:48:03,485 --> 01:48:06,328
Who is an incapable lawyer?
Tenali is smarter than Dad.

2046
01:48:06,876 --> 01:48:09,352
I know how intelligent he is.

2047
01:48:10,373 --> 01:48:13,399
There are no eye witnesses
to Varalaxmi's crime.

2048
01:48:14,107 --> 01:48:16,339
Kishore was Bhupal's best friend.

2049
01:48:17,613 --> 01:48:20,508
So, when Tenali found out about it,
he met Kishore.

2050
01:48:20,673 --> 01:48:24,676
He asked his help to make
Varalaxmi pay for her crime.

2051
01:48:26,613 --> 01:48:29,016
He tricked Varalaxmi's
men into believing that..

2052
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,161
..there are eye
witnesses to her crime.

2053
01:48:41,228 --> 01:48:44,041
He made her find
them and take them home.

2054
01:48:49,262 --> 01:48:51,515
And they went there
with spy cameras.

2055
01:48:51,539 --> 01:48:53,863
Did you kill him or not?
Is it true or not?

2056
01:48:53,887 --> 01:48:55,296
This house is very cool.

2057
01:49:00,593 --> 01:49:03,625
They recorded
Varalaxmi's confession.

2058
01:49:03,705 --> 01:49:05,060
I killed him. So what?

2059
01:49:06,871 --> 01:49:08,055
Now that video footage..

2060
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:10,148
..will be presented as
evidence in the High Court.

2061
01:49:11,384 --> 01:49:14,329
When an intelligent man goes rogue,
he becomes like Dad.

2062
01:49:14,693 --> 01:49:16,951
But when a good man puts
his intelligence to good use..

2063
01:49:17,249 --> 01:49:18,480
..he becomes like Tenali.

2064
01:49:29,928 --> 01:49:30,561
Hello!

2065
01:49:30,585 --> 01:49:32,011
Ma'am, I'm Chakravarthi here.

2066
01:49:34,553 --> 01:49:35,208
What is it?

2067
01:49:35,232 --> 01:49:37,986
I did a mistake.
I'm sorry for that.

2068
01:49:38,251 --> 01:49:39,848
I'll tell you a secret.

2069
01:49:40,298 --> 01:49:42,136
You'll be in trouble
if you don't believe it.

2070
01:49:42,937 --> 01:49:45,012
The people with you
are not eye witnesses.

2071
01:50:03,057 --> 01:50:05,243
If the judge sees the
footage that they have..

2072
01:50:05,596 --> 01:50:07,535
..you might be arrested
in the court itself.

2073
01:50:09,368 --> 01:50:11,577
Those people shouldn't
reach the court at any cost.

2074
01:50:11,787 --> 01:50:12,628
Okay.

2075
01:50:22,582 --> 01:50:24,384
Why did you stop here, madam?

2076
01:50:26,019 --> 01:50:27,237
- Let's have some tea.
- Okay.

2077
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:29,169
- I want green tea.
- I'll have lemon tea.

2078
01:50:29,193 --> 01:50:30,359
I want black tea.

2079
01:50:30,383 --> 01:50:32,019
They don't have so
many varieties here.

2080
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:33,956
They have normal tea.
Go and sit down.

2081
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:35,679
Then why did we stop here?

2082
01:50:35,703 --> 01:50:38,599
This whole place should
be in our control for two hours.

2083
01:50:38,623 --> 01:50:39,832
Send everybody away.

2084
01:50:42,062 --> 01:50:44,797
Hey, get up! Come on, go out!

2085
01:50:46,837 --> 01:50:47,791
What's wrong, dear?

2086
01:50:47,953 --> 01:50:49,403
Why do you look so worried?

2087
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,605
They are not eye witnesses.

2088
01:50:51,685 --> 01:50:54,666
They recorded everything
we said with secret cameras.

2089
01:50:54,987 --> 01:50:58,750
She made everyone leave just
because she wanted to have tea?

2090
01:50:58,782 --> 01:51:01,273
Money can buy you anything you want.

2091
01:51:01,297 --> 01:51:02,256
That's right.

2092
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:03,287
What do we do now?

2093
01:51:04,002 --> 01:51:07,257
It's not wrong to take the
donkey's help in our time of need.

2094
01:51:07,281 --> 01:51:08,782
Who is that donkey?

2095
01:51:09,928 --> 01:51:11,249
Tell me, Varalaxmi.

2096
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:14,621
Two cats were fighting
for one piece of break.

2097
01:51:14,645 --> 01:51:17,434
But a monkey came in
and ate the whole piece.

2098
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:19,229
Similarly,
you and I are busy fighting..

2099
01:51:19,431 --> 01:51:22,320
..and Tenali is using
it to his advantage.

2100
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:24,720
What do we do now?

2101
01:51:25,234 --> 01:51:26,045
Let's kill everyone.

2102
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,967
They are working so hard,
what are they doing?

2103
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:47,530
They are making electricity.

2104
01:51:48,099 --> 01:51:50,579
That's not a dish that
you can make in your kitchen.

2105
01:51:51,337 --> 01:51:52,980
Did you ever get an electric shock?

2106
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:54,522
I get a shock when
I pay the bill every time.

2107
01:51:54,629 --> 01:51:56,745
Oh God, it's a painful
feeling, madam.

2108
01:51:57,037 --> 01:51:58,179
Now you can taste it.
It's very tasty.

2109
01:51:59,153 --> 01:52:00,304
What is this?

2110
01:52:00,834 --> 01:52:03,690
Why are you tying us up?
We won't run away.

2111
01:52:03,714 --> 01:52:04,699
We are on your side.

2112
01:52:04,723 --> 01:52:05,693
Switch it on.

2113
01:52:15,429 --> 01:52:17,416
What is this?

2114
01:52:17,574 --> 01:52:18,449
Free electricity.

2115
01:52:18,473 --> 01:52:21,787
Farmers need free electricity,
not us, you stupid man.

2116
01:52:21,811 --> 01:52:24,641
Do we look like farmers to you,
you idiot?

2117
01:52:24,665 --> 01:52:26,339
How dare you abuse me?

2118
01:52:29,986 --> 01:52:31,347
Stop it, madam. Please stop it.

2119
01:52:31,371 --> 01:52:34,037
They all have hair.
Smoke is coming out of my head.

2120
01:52:34,061 --> 01:52:34,981
Please stop it.

2121
01:52:35,005 --> 01:52:39,996
We are on your side.
Why are you torturing us?

2122
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:42,016
Bravo!

2123
01:52:43,203 --> 01:52:44,903
Brilliant actors!

2124
01:52:44,927 --> 01:52:47,587
You didn't see me killing
the man but you said you saw it.

2125
01:52:48,207 --> 01:52:50,650
You came to my house
and made me confess..

2126
01:52:50,674 --> 01:52:53,718
..to the murder and recorded
it with secret cameras.

2127
01:52:54,843 --> 01:52:58,758
Don't underestimate us.
We have Tenali's backing.

2128
01:52:58,782 --> 01:53:00,646
Yeah. He's on the way.

2129
01:53:05,105 --> 01:53:05,875
Get him!

2130
01:54:12,396 --> 01:54:14,100
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

2131
01:54:18,482 --> 01:54:20,367
"Just do as I say"

2132
01:54:49,496 --> 01:54:50,947
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

2133
01:54:52,006 --> 01:54:53,567
"Just do as I say"

2134
01:54:55,449 --> 01:54:57,120
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

2135
01:55:01,743 --> 01:55:03,703
- What's that?
- Petrol.

2136
01:55:03,727 --> 01:55:04,948
For what?

2137
01:55:04,972 --> 01:55:06,380
I think to burn us.

2138
01:55:06,404 --> 01:55:07,895
- Don't give them any ideas.
- What is this?

2139
01:55:07,919 --> 01:55:09,695
Even God of Death doesn't
torture people so much in hell.

2140
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:10,338
There's a limit.

2141
01:55:10,362 --> 01:55:13,010
I'm not as good as God of Death.

2142
01:55:13,431 --> 01:55:15,812
Will you respectfully
give me the cameras or die?

2143
01:55:16,332 --> 01:55:18,539
We'll give you respect if you want,
but not the cameras.

2144
01:55:18,755 --> 01:55:20,886
I know you've no hair,
don't you have brains too?

2145
01:55:20,910 --> 01:55:22,065
How dare you hit your
father a second time?

2146
01:55:22,089 --> 01:55:23,668
She's going to kill us.
Which one is better?

2147
01:55:24,107 --> 01:55:24,989
This is better.

2148
01:55:25,013 --> 01:55:27,230
Then it's better to give
her the cameras.

2149
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:28,528
- Take it.
- Put it in this.

2150
01:55:28,552 --> 01:55:29,780
Take this bag as well.

2151
01:55:29,804 --> 01:55:31,272
Put it inside.
You too.

2152
01:55:31,296 --> 01:55:31,945
Yes.

2153
01:55:32,243 --> 01:55:35,495
If you let us go,
we'll book an Ola Cab to go home.

2154
01:55:35,525 --> 01:55:36,681
Who is letting you go?

2155
01:55:42,564 --> 01:55:45,343
Tenali Ramakrishna!
Where are you?

2156
01:55:52,391 --> 01:55:54,411
Oh no! He took the evidence bag!

2157
01:55:55,775 --> 01:55:57,220
The evidence is gone!

2158
01:56:01,766 --> 01:56:03,304
"Ramakrishna Tenali"

2159
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:06,769
Ram into him, madam! Hit him!

2160
01:56:07,955 --> 01:56:08,543
Do it!

2161
01:56:09,309 --> 01:56:10,779
"Just do as I say"

2162
01:56:10,803 --> 01:56:12,276
Ram into him! Come on!

2163
01:56:15,103 --> 01:56:16,546
"Ramakrishna Tenali"

2164
01:56:17,848 --> 01:56:19,349
"Just do as I say"

2165
01:56:20,961 --> 01:56:22,782
Madam! Stop! Stop! Stop!

2166
01:56:23,717 --> 01:56:25,206
Just do as I say"

2167
01:56:25,802 --> 01:56:27,861
Why are they dressed
as Bahubali's soldiers..

2168
01:56:27,885 --> 01:56:30,976
..in similar helmets,
clothes and on similar scooters?

2169
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:40,307
(Shlokas)

2170
01:56:40,331 --> 01:56:46,208
(Shlokas)

2171
01:56:59,006 --> 01:57:02,936
This rascal is trying to trick us.

2172
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,988
No matter how many tricks he plays..

2173
01:57:05,012 --> 01:57:07,913
..finally he has to come
to the court. I'll finish him there.

2174
01:57:27,902 --> 01:57:30,869
Madam, did we come to the
High Court or to the Ayyappa Hill?

2175
01:57:30,893 --> 01:57:33,577
Everyone is in black
gowns and black helmets.

2176
01:57:33,701 --> 01:57:35,738
I think this is Tenali's plan.

2177
01:57:35,762 --> 01:57:38,959
Tenali Ramakrishna!
Remove your helmet!

2178
01:57:39,182 --> 01:57:41,183
I'm not Ramakrishna.
I'm Balakrishna.

2179
01:57:41,207 --> 01:57:42,952
Balakrishna? Okay, go.

2180
01:57:43,032 --> 01:57:44,860
- Ramakrishna!
- Mohankrishna!

2181
01:57:44,884 --> 01:57:45,800
Harikrishna.

2182
01:57:46,271 --> 01:57:47,143
Jaikrishna.

2183
01:57:47,294 --> 01:57:48,383
My name is Saikrishna.

2184
01:57:48,562 --> 01:57:53,198
All Krishnas are here
except for Superstar Krishna.

2185
01:57:53,222 --> 01:57:55,657
Tenali Ramakrishna! Where are you?

2186
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:58,078
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

2187
01:57:59,327 --> 01:58:01,067
"Just do as I say"

2188
01:58:02,049 --> 01:58:03,735
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

2189
01:58:04,084 --> 01:58:05,058
Thank you, boss.

2190
01:58:21,446 --> 01:58:25,149
Tenali, you rascal!
Where is our evidence bag?

2191
01:58:25,278 --> 01:58:27,095
Oh no! I thought I'll
lose it if I have it with me..

2192
01:58:27,175 --> 01:58:28,673
..so I gave it to the judge, auntie.

2193
01:58:33,182 --> 01:58:34,804
I killed him. So what?

2194
01:58:36,627 --> 01:58:37,994
I killed his father too.

2195
01:58:38,205 --> 01:58:40,393
After examining the evidence
that was submitted..

2196
01:58:40,417 --> 01:58:43,162
..Varalaxmi is considered
a criminal by the court.

2197
01:58:43,221 --> 01:58:46,054
The court orders the
ED to seize her fake owned..

2198
01:58:46,546 --> 01:58:48,968
..properties and
investigate her assets.

2199
01:58:49,102 --> 01:58:51,516
The court orders the
police department to take..

2200
01:58:51,826 --> 01:58:53,632
..Varalaxmi into custody right away.

2201
01:58:54,149 --> 01:58:55,092
You!

2202
01:58:55,116 --> 01:58:56,931
You killed a man before my eyes.

2203
01:58:57,754 --> 01:58:58,945
No!

2204
01:59:01,165 --> 01:59:03,227
How did you think that
I'll let you get away with it?

2205
01:59:05,904 --> 01:59:08,153
- Madam, take her away.
- Come on!

2206
01:59:09,951 --> 01:59:11,898
Varalaxmi, Ashtalaxmi,
Dhanalaxmi, Dhanyalaxmi..

2207
01:59:11,922 --> 01:59:14,378
..Santanalaxmi and
even Bhagyalaxmi..

2208
01:59:14,744 --> 01:59:17,644
If you are good to people,
they will worship you.

2209
01:59:17,668 --> 01:59:20,020
But if you do scams,
conspiracies and murders..

2210
01:59:20,044 --> 01:59:22,118
..they will pull you
down and put you behind bars.

2211
01:59:22,142 --> 01:59:24,307
You managed to hoard
50 billion rupees.

2212
01:59:24,501 --> 01:59:26,729
How did you forget this tiny logic?

2213
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:28,823
Madam, what is this?

2214
01:59:28,847 --> 01:59:33,862
Don't think this is over.
I'll kill you even if I'm in prison.

2215
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:34,797
Wow.

2216
01:59:36,344 --> 01:59:37,274
All the best.

2217
01:59:41,274 --> 01:59:42,063
Yes!

2218
01:59:45,211 --> 01:59:46,700
"Ramakrishna Tenali.."

2219
01:59:47,814 --> 01:59:49,408
"Just do as I say"

2220
01:59:50,745 --> 01:59:55,300
"Then your life will be
a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali"

2221
01:59:55,535 --> 01:59:56,908
How dare you!

2222
01:59:57,914 --> 02:00:01,158
- Rascal? How dare you!
- I got it.

2223
02:00:01,878 --> 02:00:02,559
How..

2224
02:00:03,585 --> 02:00:04,886
We are Rajyalaxmi's men.

2225
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:06,452
I'm Nageshwar Rao's man.

2226
02:00:09,008 --> 02:00:11,172
We booked return
tickets for Kurnool.

2227
02:00:11,196 --> 02:00:13,170
You are killing us with your songs.

2228
02:00:13,194 --> 02:00:15,506
- One more. I have one last line.
- Another line? I'm so sorry.

If I start arguing.. My argument..

2230
02:00:18,857 --> 02:00:21,362
She's criminal lawyer.. One more.

02:00:21,386 --> 02:00:22,261
I thought so.

2232
02:00:22,491 --> 02:00:23,479
Got it. Okay.

2233
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:25,298
I'll kill you.
