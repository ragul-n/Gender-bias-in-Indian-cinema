00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,188
Hello. - Hello. Is this Vijay?
- Yes, Vijay here.

2
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,416
Go to the airport immediately.
Mr.Commissioner has called you.

3
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,594
Right now?
- Yes.

4
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,064
I can't say who that person is.

5
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,606
But I can say that a bomb is going
to explode on that plane.

6
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,743
Because I've placed that bomb there.

7
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:44,082
If you want to save the plane
the lives of all passengers..

8
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,708
..arrange 1 crore rupees in an hour.

9
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,084
I will call again after
half an hour..

10
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,385
..to inform you where and how
I will collect the money.

11
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,725
We called the plane back
after hearing this.

12
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,026
After all passengers and
crew alighted safely..

13
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,499
..we parked the plane far
away in a secluded place.

14
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,030
Because if this warning is true..

15
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,231
..the gallons of petrol in the
flight can prove dangerous.

16
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,443
That man called again after
everyone got out of the plane.

17
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,671
Hear that.

18
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,510
Congratulations. The plane is
back and everyone is saved.

19
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,049
But you will have to give
me 1 crore rupees..

20
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,522
..to save the plane worth 17 crores.

21
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,720
Look, we frequently
receive such calls.

22
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,232
Perhaps you don't know that it's
a crime to play such jokes.

23
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,062
Fine, if you consider it a joke..

24
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:42,264
..watch out for an explosion
worth crores.

25
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,076
Can I hear the last portion again,
sir? - Sure. - Sir!

26
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,617
Enough.

27
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,084
Fine, if you consider it a joke..

28
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:02,091
..watch out for an explosion
worth crores.

29
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,222
Let's watch together.

30
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,564
If my guess is right, you won't
loose the 17 crore rupees.

31
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,536
Wait! Where are you going?

32
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,436
Looks like this man
is somewhere around.

33
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,440
Let's see if I've guessed it right.

34
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,170
Kamat!

35
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,513
What's your problem? How long
are we to stand here?

36
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,152
If this flight is not taking off,
arrange another flight for us.

37
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,721
At least return us our bags.
- Where is our luggage?

38
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,257
Just a minute! Please, calm down.

39
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,490
Doctor, she's regained
consciousness.

40
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,598
You won't enjoy the explosion
from so far.

41
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:27,510
Let's watch this expensive
explosion closely.

42
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,240
C'mon.

43
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:41,794
Yes, inspector Ahmed?

44
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,253
Sir, who is this crazy man..

45
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,795
..going towards plane
breaking the cordon?

46
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,234
That crazy man is inspector
Vijay Verma. Over and out.

47
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,802
No, I don't want to
go to the hospital.

48
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,068
My child is left in the plane.
Do something, inspector.

49
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,265
She's in the plane.

50
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,141
Sir, she fainted when she
heard of emergency landing.

51
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,210
And when she woke up..

52
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,108
..she remembered her
child is left behind.

53
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,511
She recalled that her daughter
was in the bathroom.

54
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,235
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?

55
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,242
What are you doing?
Have you gone crazy?

56
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,751
Hey man! Where are you going?
Subtitles Encoded By Desi Doctor @ Team Bindass

57
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,126
What is my fault? What do
you want? What do you want?

58
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,357
Now tell me where the bomb is
and when it's going to explode.

59
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,368
Bomb? What bomb? I..
I don't understand.

60
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,433
You will understand when the bomb
will explode over your head.

61
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,735
I don't care about myself,
but you will surely die.

62
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,245
Now tell me, where is the bomb?

63
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,189
Inspector, get me out of here.

64
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:35,366
Take me away! Untie me! Let
me go! Let me go, bastard!

65
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,099
This plane is going to
explode in 2 minutes.

66
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,439
Let me go! This plane is
going to be in pieces.

67
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,376
Let me go! Let me go, bastard!

68
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,678
Where is the bomb?
- Over seat no. 19, in a toy.

69
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,053
Go! Faster, faster!

70
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,759
Hey baby! Give me that teddy.
- No, it's mine.

71
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,285
Give.. ok, ok.

72
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,823
C'mon, girl. Give me that teddy.
- No.

73
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,104
It's a very dirty toy. Shucks!
I have some good chocolates.

74
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,366
Here, take these chocolates.

75
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,406
Give me the toy and I'll
give you the chocolates.

76
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,774
C'mon. Come, child.
Give me the teddy.

77
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,091
Inspector Verma, swear
on this Gita..

78
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,561
..that you will speak the truth
and nothing but the truth.

79
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,101
I swear on this book that..

80
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,501
..I will speak the truth and
nothing but the truth.

81
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,836
Now tell us, do you
drink alcohol or not?

82
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,281
Perhaps you've misunderstood,
lawyer.

83
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,513
He's the criminal, not me.
- Order! Order!

84
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,623
It's you who have misunderstood,
Mr. Verma.

85
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:10,353
A person cannot be termed criminal
till his crime is proved.

86
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,059
No crime is yet proved..

87
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,257
..against my client, Mr.
Anthony Brigenza.

88
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,471
And I am sure there will be none.

89
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,201
Now answer me in simple yes or no.

90
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,767
Do you drink alcohol or not?

91
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,581
Yes, I do.

92
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,078
How much had you drunk..

93
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,746
..when you arrested my client,
Mr. Anthony Brigenza?

94
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,156
Around half a bottle.
- That means you were intoxicated.

95
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,091
And you arrested the first man..

96
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,288
..you could get your hands on
under the effect of alcohol.

97
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,489
I wasn't intoxicated.

98
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,100
My Lord, if you permit..

99
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,398
..I'd like to say something
to the lawyer.

100
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,168
You are permitted.
- Thank you.

101
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:05,045
Mr. Lawyer, the reason behind
increasing crime rate these days..

102
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:10,052
..are surely these criminals,
but people like you are..

103
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:15,057
..more responsible
for freeing them..

104
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:19,561
..with the help of loopholes
in the law.

105
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,502
You are an equal partner in
the increasing crime rate.

106
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,797
Yes, an equal partner.

107
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:35,077
It is you who have helped them
overcome the fear of law.

108
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,477
It is you who have encouraged
them to break law.

109
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,086
People like you. And remember
this, Mr. Lawyer.

110
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,087
You are committing a crime
against the society..

111
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,725
..by saving such criminals.

112
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:53,695
A big crime.
- Order! Order!

113
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,097
Inspector Verma, as I said before..

114
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,726
..a person is called criminal
only after his crime is proved.

115
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,030
And you have no proof that..

116
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,302
..this man was present at the scene
of the crime at that time.

117
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,037
But I have around 25 witnesses
who can prove..

118
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:12,048
..that this man could not have
been there on that day.

119
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,722
My Lord, I didn't need
to argue on this case.

120
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,588
But I wanted to teach
Mr. Verma a lesson.

121
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,060
I want to tell the court
and the department that..

122
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,496
..inspector Verma is a shame
to the police department.

123
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,561
He is fonder of misusing law
than drinking alcohol!

124
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,572
My poor client is saved due
to half bottle of alcohol.

125
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,074
But we can't be sure how
many innocent people..

126
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,509
..would have fallen prey
to his drinking habit.

127
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,337
My Lord, inspector Verma..

128
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,813
..has killed at least 6 people
in the last 3 years.

129
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,082
My Lord, they were not
ordinary people..

130
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,382
..but professional criminals;
they were barbaric, wild dogs.

131
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,616
I haven't killed them;
I have punished them.

132
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,420
Without any witness
or evidence or case?

133
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,662
Wow! What justice!

134
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,265
That's all, Mr. Verma. Thank you.

135
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,038
My Lord, I won't take much of
court's time and will say that..

136
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,044
..the day and the moment this
accident took place..

137
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,047
..Mr. Anthony was
lying unconscious..

138
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,377
..in Bombay Hospital.

139
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,576
He had been operated
on for appendicitis.

140
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,652
Here are his hospital reports.

141
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,485
But these reports might be forged.

142
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,060
So I request the respected
Dr. Kanubhai Shah..

143
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,758
..to come here and testify
the reports.

144
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,335
I will speak the truth and
nothing but the truth.

145
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:49,072
Dr. Shah, was Mr. Anthony
in a condition..

146
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:53,275
..to leave the hospital on
and around 24th November?

147
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,419
Anthony Brigenza..

148
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,178
..was unconscious on 24th November.

149
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,383
He was under my observation.
- Thank you, doctor.

150
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,724
Mr. Anthony Brigenza is free to go.

151
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,027
And the police department
is ordered..

152
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,064
..to make investigations
on inspector Verma.

153
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,440
Congratulations, Mr. Brigenza.
- Thank you.

154
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,574
Come.
- This way.

155
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,787
You should be ashamed.

156
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,223
The police department is
embarrassed because of you.

157
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,694
The law and police were
mocked at in the court.

158
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,159
You have drowned your dignity
and shame in alcohol.

159
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,802
At least think about my and
the department's prestige.

160
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,763
Sir, I assure you he was the
culprit. - What nonsense!

161
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,073
Many people and a respected
doctor has testified..

162
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,440
..that he was in the
hospital on that day.

163
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,138
Yet, you are not ready to believe.

164
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,014
Are you trying to say
that the same person..

165
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,019
..was present at 2 different
places at the same time?

166
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,747
Do you think it's possible?

167
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,218
Cheers!

168
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:16,624
The poor inspector must
have gone nuts wondering!

169
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,203
He must be thinking how
it could be possible.

170
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,112
If Tony wishes, anything
is possible.

171
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:39,179
But, brother, my appendix was fine.

172
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,519
Why did you get it operated?

173
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:47,488
Jojo! Appendix is a totally
useless part of the body.

174
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,203
It won't harm you if you
take it out. Understand?

175
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,235
You won't understand.

176
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,739
One needs a brain to understand.

177
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,009
My mummy used to say..

178
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:10,019
..Tony, if you use your brain
in the right direction..

179
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,250
..you will become a very
rich man one day.

180
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,519
Very rich.

181
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:27,365
But my brain wants to walk
on the 'No Entry' path.

182
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,299
It works the other way round.

183
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,245
See; how many bullets are these?

184
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:50,552
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
- Good.

185
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,061
Now listen. One of these bullets..

186
00:18:55,234 --> 00:19:03,608
..is meant for the brain
of inspector Vijay.

187
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:12,179
This bullet will enter his brain..
and will remain there.

188
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,208
Who are you? What's your name?
What are you doing here?

189
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,037
My name is Vijay Verma.
I am a police inspector..

190
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,739
..and I've come here to
get my car repaired.

191
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:53,215
Good that you told me. Or I would
have killed a policeman.

192
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,059
And my parents would
have locked me..

193
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,253
..in the bathroom for that mistake.

194
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,669
Tell me, what is your name?
- My name is Bobby.

195
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,136
My papa's name is Shekhar.

196
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,538
And my mummy's name
is Seema Shekhar.

197
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,248
You are Seema and Shekhar's son?

198
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,479
Let me see you closely. Very good!

199
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,623
I didn't know you had
grown up so much.

200
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:31,519
Do you know my mummy and papa?
- Yes, very well.

201
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,823
Then why don't you come
to our place? - Me?

202
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,494
Well, I had gone out of
town for a few days.

203
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,799
Tell me, when is your
papa coming back?

204
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,503
Papa has gone out to try a car.
He must be back soon.

205
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:52,617
Mummy is at home; shall I call her?
- No.. no.

206
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,784
I'll be off now. I'll
come some other day.

207
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,619
Papa is back! Papa is
back! Papa is back!

208
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,352
Yes, my child, I am back.

209
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,493
Alright, alright, my son. Bravo!

210
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,397
Here, a chocolate for you.

211
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,266
Vijay?!

212
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,815
Aren't you embarrassed?
Where had you vanished?

213
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,793
I was transferred from here.
- Were you, or did you ask for it?

214
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:44,302
Did Seema or I make any
mistake and hurt you?

215
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,336
No, it's not what you think.

216
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,331
I thought I should leave you
alone after you got married.

217
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,603
I don't like interfering..

218
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,642
Come home. Seema will be
very happy to see you.

219
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,840
No, I'll be off now. I'll
come some other day.

220
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,252
This Rampyari.. - Rampyari? -
My car. - What's wrong with it?

221
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,255
It jerked, so I thought
I'd take it to a garage.

222
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,053
But it's fine as soon as
it came here. - Good.

223
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,559
Come with me.
- No.. - C'mon.

224
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,524
Seema! Look who's here, Seema.

225
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,533
Vijay?! After all these years?
Aren't you ashamed?

226
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,599
Looks like husband and wife..

227
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:25,800
..have rehearsed the
same sentence for me.

228
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,474
Fine; you say the sentence
you've rehearsed for us.

229
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,378
I was transferred;
so I was not here.

230
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,386
Uncle, can I see your gun?
- Yes, sure.

231
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,253
But the gun is loaded, so
I will empty it first.

232
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,223
Here.

233
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,596
Papa, I want a gun like
this one on my birthday.

234
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,237
It's not a toy for the children.
It needs a license.

235
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:57,637
Bobby, return the gun to uncle.
- Thank you, uncle. - Thank you.

236
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,242
C'mon, you are to complete
your homework.

237
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,280
What will you have, Vijay?
- Cold water.

238
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,378
What did you say? Water?
- Yes, with a little whisky.

239
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,745
Seema, get water.

240
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,656
We've met after a long time.
Let's celebrate.

241
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,391
You guys just need
an excuse to drink.

242
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,654
I remember Vijay never
used to drink.

243
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,129
He drank alcohol for the first
time on our wedding.

244
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,237
And he got so used to it that
he still continues to drink.

245
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:32,803
What can I do? Some habits die hard.

246
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:40,182
But you left us very easily.
- I didn't leave you..

247
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:46,086
I mean I didn't leave you guys.
I just went away for a while.

248
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,749
But now I will visit you
frequently. I take your leave.

249
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,626
On one condition. You will have
dinner with us tonight.

250
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,561
Not tonight, pal. Some
other day may be.

251
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,396
I've promised to dine with
someone else tonight.

252
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:04,174
And who is this person?
- It's not what you think.

253
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,042
I've promised to meet my younger
brother this evening.

254
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,620
Taxi!

255
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,729
Hey madam! Are you blind or what?

256
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:34,131
Yes, I'm blinded by your love.
- Neetu!

257
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,466
I didn't recognize you
for a few seconds.

258
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,735
How are you? - I'm fine. What
about you? - First class.

259
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,075
C'mon, we'll chat in the car..
- Just a minute. My bag.

260
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,082
You know, Neetu, the course
I want to study..

261
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,721
..is not available in Illahabad.

262
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,790
It's a one year course where I will
have to study and teach as well.

263
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,091
Really? The best thing is that..

264
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,696
..I've got a room at
the college hostel.

265
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,628
So won't you be staying
with your brother, Vijay?

266
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,031
Brother, my intention..

267
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,331
..for coming to this city
is that I can be with you.

268
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,203
But my college is
very far from here.

269
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,105
I will waste a lot
of time traveling.

270
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,180
I am to study and teach as well
at this college, brother.

271
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,580
You're old enough to
teach others now, eh?

272
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,717
Time flies away!

273
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,732
You were around 4 or 5 years
old when our parents died.

274
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,463
I used to drop you at school on
my bicycle and take you back.

275
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,401
And now you talk of teaching
at the college!

276
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,344
You don't know how happy I
feel when you are happy.

277
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:03,091
Do you know how sad I feel to
see you so lonely, brother?

278
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:11,692
Why don't you get married, brother?
- Get married?

279
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,746
To get married, two people are
needed who love each other.

280
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,049
I got that chance once
in my life, but..

281
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,779
I found myself alone even then.

282
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,655
Anyways, forget it.

283
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,731
Hi.
- Hi. Come in, Neetu.

284
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:57,476
Brother, she.. she is.. well.. she..

285
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,413
Will you speak ahead or not?

286
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,746
Brother, she is..
- I will tell him.

287
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,687
My name is Neetu, brother.

288
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:08,292
Ajay and I were in the same
college; we are old friends.

289
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,018
Yes, brother, her name is Neetu.

290
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,663
We studied at the same college
and she's my old pal.

291
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,702
Shall we go?
- Yes.

292
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,672
Brother, why don't you come
with us? - No, you can go.

293
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,102
I'll join you some other day.

294
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:29,106
Listen!
- Yes? - Take care of yourself.

295
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,779
Tell me if you need anything.

296
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,793
People say this world
is a funfair.

297
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,310
People say this world
is a funfair.

298
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,012
Then what's the reason..

299
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:14,091
Then what's the reason that
you are alone, alone, alone?

300
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,525
People say this world
is a funfair.

301
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,434
People say this world
is a funfair.

302
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:33,638
Then what's the reason that
you are alone, alone, alone?

303
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:41,218
People say this world
is a funfair.

304
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:31,235
Who is that lucky girl who
will get a ring from you?

305
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:43,641
Who is that lucky girl who
will get a ring from you?

306
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:49,749
You look like a naughty lover.

307
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:57,217
You look like a naughty lover.

308
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:04,460
Then what's the reason that
you are alone, alone, alone?

309
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,633
People say this world
is a funfair.

310
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:03,516
God has sent everyone
with a partner.

311
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:08,462
Perhaps someone has
broken your heart.

312
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,268
God has sent everyone
with a partner.

313
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:21,174
Perhaps someone has
broken your heart.

314
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:25,783
Tell me what your story is.

315
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,222
Tell me what your story is.

316
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,360
Alone, alone.

317
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:47,598
People say this world
is a funfair.

318
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:54,842
Then what's the reason that
you are alone, alone, alone?

319
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:02,182
People say this world
is a funfair.

320
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:07,248
People say this world
is a funfair.

321
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,599
Waiter! One more beer.
- Yes, sir.

322
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,644
Goodnight, Peter.

323
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,810
Where are you going so soon,
pretty girl? - Let me go.

324
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,082
It is against the dignity
of men like me..

325
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,691
..that a beautiful girl
has to go alone.

326
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,621
By the way, I am called Ranjit.

327
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,093
Mr. Ranjit, I am paid
by this hotel..

328
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,099
..only to entertain
people by singing..

329
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,763
..not to sit with them
and accompany them.

330
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,573
As it is, I don't like
the company of animals.

331
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,618
So what if you don't
like my company?

332
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:15,054
I like your company.
- Let go of me or..

333
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:19,686
Or what? Will you scream?

334
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,062
Or will you hit me with
your delicate hands?

335
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,462
Let go of the girl's hand, man.

336
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,208
Who are you? Her broker?

337
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,337
Hey, let go of her hand.

338
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,086
You might have heard that..

339
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,382
..one blackens his hands
when dealing in coal.

340
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,752
But you might have not heard that
one breaks his hands, too.

341
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,698
Rascal! Interfering in my matter.

342
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,429
C'mon.
- Let the girl go, man.

343
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,780
Shall we go now?

344
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,618
Waiter!
- Yes, sir? - Come here.

345
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,786
How much does this bottle cost?
- 15 rupees, sir.

346
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,223
Debit it to my account.

347
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:41,704
One large whisky.
- Sorry, sir. The bar is closed.

348
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,305
I haven't felt the high and
the bar is already closed!

349
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:51,547
So soon? Where will I go?
The bar is closed!

350
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:57,085
The bar is closed, but
my house is open..

351
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,661
..if you'd like to come.

352
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,703
Come in.

353
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,338
Please, come. - It's quite late.
Your family will be disturbed.

354
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,604
What will they think seeing me
in this state? So I think..

355
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:23,186
No one will be disturbed. I live
alone here. Please, come in.

356
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,062
Aren't you scared to invite..

357
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:42,798
..a stranger in your house
so late in the night?

358
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,500
A stranger is one
whom we don't know.

359
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,569
But I've known you quite
well in little while.

360
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:57,082
As for being scared, a man
who can save a woman..

361
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,485
..can't even think of degrading her.

362
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,556
Please, sit down.
I'll get you drink.

363
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:17,674
Sit down.

364
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,312
Where's your glass?
- I don't drink alcohol.

365
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,555
Then.. this..

366
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,262
My daddy could not
finish this bottle.

367
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,063
After my mother died..

368
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:47,694
..he did not have anything
to live on except alcohol.

369
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,769
Anyways, never mind that.

370
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,537
You must be hungry. I'll
get something to eat.

371
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,272
No. I am not hungry.
- Please, have something.

372
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,514
I don't understand.

373
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:12,087
We look exactly alike.

374
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,694
Then why are our brains
so different? - Brother!

375
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,461
You won't understand. Just
do what I tell you.

376
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,666
Here's your ticket to Sharjah
and the passport.

377
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,709
Go and enjoy the cricket
match there.

378
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:35,147
While I will rob the owner
of the Mehta Stores here.

379
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,547
Ok, brother.

380
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,376
C'mon. Let's go.

381
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,594
Look who he is.

382
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:14,082
Ok, everybody. Out! Get out quickly!

383
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,516
Run!
- Run!

384
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,429
Kalia! I'd been looking
for you for many days.

385
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,035
You thought you'd get away..

386
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,730
..with the murder of a policeman?

387
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,538
C'mon, tell your partner
to come out. Come out!

388
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,778
I will come out, but
free Kalia first.

389
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,308
How can I let go of him?

390
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:53,518
If you won't leave him,
I will shoot her.

391
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,384
I will count till 3.

392
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,187
1

393
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,537
2

394
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,573
And..
- Wait! Stop.

395
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,209
There.

396
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,778
Kalia, take the revolver.

397
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,227
Good. Now hold her.

398
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,391
Listen; I'll go and get the car.

399
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,459
If he tries to act smart,
shoot the woman.

400
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:59,518
Idiot! Fool! He's left
you to face your death.

401
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:09,160
Just think. He has the car.
He has the money.

402
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,269
Is he stupid enough to wait for you?

403
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,406
Now stand there, and
wait for your death.

404
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,490
See? What did I say?

405
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,816
He's left you.

406
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,720
My Lord, it's Mr. Vijay Verma
who's brought him here again.

407
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,059
Perhaps you recall that..

408
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,497
..he was released on the basis
of strong evidences last time.

409
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,502
Or he would be suffering
in a jail now.

410
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,298
I won't take much of
the court's time.

411
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,067
Because I've already said..

412
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,473
..what I want to say about
inspector Vijay.

413
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,075
Well, inspector Verma..

414
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,411
..tell us about the incident
of 22nd December.

415
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:40,815
I chased this man after
the mishap of the store.

416
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,090
I caught him after much struggle.
He was wearing a mask.

417
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,628
When I took off the
mask, it was him.

418
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:53,629
Are you sure it was this man?
- Yes, I am sure.

419
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,103
My Lord, Mr. Anthony Brigenza..

420
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,108
..was out of India on
the 22nd December.

421
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,380
Here's his passport..

422
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,778
..which has the immigration stamp
for both entry and exit.

423
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,209
Here's his return ticket.

424
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,718
Besides that, I also have
another evidence.

425
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,320
I'd like to present
it if you permit.

426
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:19,796
Permission granted.

427
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,765
A cricket match was on in
Sharjah on 22nd December.

428
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,403
And here's the live recording
of that match.

429
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,516
That's all, My Lord.

430
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,052
Taking these evidences
into consideration..

431
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,598
..the court releases Mr.
Anthony Brigenza.

432
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,065
And instructs the
police department..

433
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,605
..to file a legal case against
inspector Vijay Verma.

434
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,201
How can that be?

435
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,807
How can my sight cheat me?

436
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,628
Are my eyes alright?

437
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,164
We'll find out right now.

438
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,562
How many fingers are these?
- 1.

439
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,105
And these?
- 3.

440
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,174
Your eyes are fine.
- Then I must be going nuts.

441
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,047
It is said that when a
person is getting mad..

442
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,513
..it shows in his eyes first.

443
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,780
Listen! Look into my eyes
and tell me if it is true.

444
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,061
You might not be mad..

445
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,358
..but if you keep looking at
me that way, I will go mad.

446
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,138
That gives me an idea; let's
do something crazy.

447
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:45,764
I'm bored sitting here.
We'll go out for a movie.

448
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:49,506
Then we'll dine out. It
will give you a change.

449
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,140
Where? I don't..
- C'mon.. for my sake.

450
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:11,768
Bravo!

451
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,694
She's brave. - Keep quiet! You're
disturbing every one.

452
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,073
Are we at a funeral? We've
come to watch a movie.

453
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:30,217
Don't worry, Sita. God has
sent me to save you.

454
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,186
You.. who are you?

455
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,791
Don't be surprised to see me, Sita.

456
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,663
I am not a stranger.
I am your reflection.

457
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,331
Your twin sister, Gita.

458
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,269
It can happen only in movies.

459
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:48,461
I've never seen such
a thing in real life.

460
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,308
Why? Can't there be identical twins?

461
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,137
There can be, but I've
never come across any.

462
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,695
No, perhaps I've come across
two, but separately.

463
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:15,755
Now I'll see them together.

464
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,561
This story has explained
me that mysterious story.

465
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,034
What are you doing?
- Sit down!

466
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,674
Thank you miss Sita and Gita.

467
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,677
Who is it, Jojo?

468
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,171
Hold it!

469
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,415
If you try to run away, I'll shoot.

470
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,179
Let's go.

471
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,061
Sir, one person cannot
be at two places..

472
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,135
..but these two can be at two
different places at the same time.

473
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,003
You will have to take all
allegations on yourself..

474
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,613
..to save your younger brother.

475
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,682
You will have to confess
all your crimes.

476
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:14,088
You will have to say that he
didn't know about your job.

477
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,024
You were only taking
advantage of him..

478
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,355
..for being your look-alike.

479
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,428
I will not spare you,
inspector Vijay Verma.

480
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,308
'But you left us very easily.
- I didn't leave you..'

481
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:40,482
'I mean I didn't leave you guys.
I just went away for a while.'

482
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:27,687
There is smoke if there is fire.

483
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,629
There is smoke if there is fire.

484
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:37,501
People find out if
someone is in love.

485
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:42,111
People find out if
someone is in love.

486
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:47,273
If someone is in love,
he cannot hide it.

487
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:52,115
There is smoke if there is fire.

488
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,726
There is smoke if there is fire.

489
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:01,453
People find out if
someone is in love.

490
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:06,261
People find out if
someone is in love.

491
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:11,430
If someone is in love,
he cannot hide it.

492
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:16,341
There is smoke if there is fire.

493
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:21,143
There is smoke if there is fire.

494
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:11,195
When he comes before me..

495
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:16,396
When he comes before me..

496
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:23,073
My heart misses a beat.

497
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:27,683
My heart misses a beat.

498
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,483
My eyes lower down.

499
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:39,656
I don't bow down to someone
for no reason.

500
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:44,392
I don't bow down to someone
for no reason.

501
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:48,834
People find out if
someone is in love.

502
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:53,536
People find out if
someone is in love.

503
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:58,580
If someone is in love,
he cannot hide it.

504
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:03,451
There is smoke if there is fire.

505
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,250
There is smoke if there is fire.

506
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:36,239
How do I praise love? It's
a desire of my heart.

507
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:45,515
How do I praise love? It's
a desire of my heart.

508
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,220
No, it's a storm.

509
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:57,290
No one can stop this storm.

510
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:01,733
No one can stop this storm.

511
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:06,340
People find out if
someone is in love.

512
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:10,775
People find out if
someone is in love.

513
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:16,184
If someone is in love,
he cannot hide it.

514
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:20,653
There is smoke if there is fire.

515
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:25,523
There is smoke if there is fire.

516
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,699
You must drink today. One drink
is not going to harm you.

517
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:39,240
No, pal. Once you get addicted to
it, you cannot get rid of it.

518
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,804
You know I am an extremist. I
do everything at the extremes.

519
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,682
Whether it's love or hatred,
friendship or enmity.

520
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,821
I take everything
to the final stage.

521
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,485
Who do you love? I haven't seen
your girlfriend till date.

522
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,722
What shows is not true love.
It's just a show.

523
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,062
Wow! You must drink on that note.
- No, pal.

524
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,328
Tell me, why have
you called me here?

525
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,460
We were going to meet..

526
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,163
..at Seema's birthday party
this evening anyways.

527
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:14,333
What's the emergency?
- There is, pal.

528
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,109
I haven't told you something, Vijay.

529
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,448
I love Seema very much
and want to marry her.

530
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,350
And you must tell her
that on my behalf.

531
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,485
I have no one of my
own who can tell her.

532
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:33,361
If she agrees, I will feel
like being in heaven.

533
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:41,061
And if she disagrees, you can
take it that you had a friend..

534
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:48,200
..who loved you, and whose
name was Shekhar.

535
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,180
Vijay! Vijay! What's the matter?

536
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,578
What thoughts are you lost in?

537
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:59,279
Have I said something wrong?
- No.. it's ok.

538
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:07,488
I was just surprised.. that.. you
never told me about it before.

539
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:12,566
And why didn't I see it?

540
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:17,095
You said just now, what shows
is not true love. It's a show.

541
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,235
My dear friend! My brother!
Please, tell her today.

542
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,446
Me? I will talk to her today itself.

543
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,749
Well.. I'll have a
drink on that note.

544
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,120
There can be no better
opportunity to start.

545
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,759
Fantastic! Fantastic!

546
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,388
Cheers!
- Cheers!

547
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,258
Seema!

548
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,769
Your birthday cake is here.
- Wow!

549
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,067
Child, I don't know why..

550
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,801
..but I am worried about
your marriage today.

551
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,208
What's there to worry about?

552
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,078
I will be married when God wishes.

553
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,554
Unless, you want to
get rid of me sooner.

554
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:11,025
Yes, I want to bid
you farewell soon..

555
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:16,655
..because I found this
photograph in your book

556
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:22,034
I wanted to ask you about
him that very day..

557
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,332
..but I thought this would
be a better day.

558
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,034
You love Vijay very much, don't you?

559
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,583
Yes, mother.

560
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,050
But I don't know if Vijay loves me..

561
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:45,252
..that's why I didn't
tell you about it.

562
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,198
My heart says that
he loves you, too.

563
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,260
At least talk to him.
- How can I..

564
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,270
If you can't, I will ask him.

565
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,500
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

566
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:08,607
Happy birthday, dear Seema.
Happy birthday to you.

567
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,151
I have a good voice,
don't I, auntie?

568
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,757
If I rehearsed, I could
be a good singer.

569
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:21,754
When did you start drinking?
- Today, just a while back.

570
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:25,028
Because I am very happy today..

571
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,362
..and want to tell you some thing.

572
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,665
Will you sit here? And
you sit there, Seema.

573
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:39,210
Listen carefully, auntie, as
the matter is quite serious.

574
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:45,380
I am going to give you good news,
which will make you dance.

575
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,717
Tell me quickly what
the good news is.

576
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:50,693
Shall I tell you?

577
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,253
Shall I tell you?

578
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,065
Shall I really tell you?
- Yes. - Ok.

579
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:03,296
I've come to talk to you
about Seema's marriage.

580
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,172
God bless you. We were
just talking about it.

581
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:12,178
Then this is the right
moment to talk.

582
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:19,415
Auntie, my friend, Shekhar,
was right.

583
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,157
He said, go, you can't get
a better chance than today.

584
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,487
Don't refuse what I say, auntie.

585
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:31,090
Promise? - I promise. - Don't
refuse, auntie. You've given a word.

586
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:39,036
You see, auntie, I've
come to propose..

587
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,540
..Shekhar's marriage to Seema.

588
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,186
What's the matter?
Why are you silent?

589
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,453
Shekhar is a good guy.

590
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:58,790
We've known each other
since we were kids.

591
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:02,594
Let me tell you that you won't find
a guy like Shekhar these days.

592
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:11,135
Besides, he loves Seema very much.
What more can you ask for?

593
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:17,272
When you came, child,
you looked so happy.

594
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:23,384
I thought you were going to
talk about your marriage.

595
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,245
My marriage?

596
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:32,427
I've never thought
about my marriage.

597
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:39,333
Marriage is a big hassle.
I am better off alone.

598
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,105
You see, Seema, some people
keep themselves happy.

599
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,208
I am one of them.

600
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,513
Some people keep others happy.
Shekhar is one of them.

601
01:00:55,284 --> 01:01:01,519
Vijay, Shekhar is a very good
friend. But marriage..

602
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:10,527
I need some time to think over.
- Alright. Alright.

603
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,368
I forgot to give you the flowers.

604
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:23,073
You can think. But don't
refuse after that..

605
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:27,205
..because it will break
Shekhar's heart.

606
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,191
Sorry.
- It's ok.

607
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:42,594
Looks like it's a day of breakings.

608
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,292
Everything is breaking.

609
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:02,182
Hello.
- Hello, Vijay. - Yes; who is this?

610
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:09,280
I.. I am Seema.
- I couldn't recognize your voice.

611
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,051
If you keep aloof from us..

612
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:15,630
..you might not recognize me,
too, after some time.

613
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,232
No, no, that can never happen.

614
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:22,667
I was just thinking of you..
I mean all of you.

615
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:23,806
Tell me.

616
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,070
We're having a party for Bobby's
birthday this evening.

617
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:34,581
You must come.
- This evening.. well..

618
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,776
I don't want to hear excuses.

619
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,078
If you won't come today..

620
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,246
..we will think you don't
want to meet us at all.

621
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:47,694
No, I can never do that. - If so,
I will see you in the evening.

622
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,361
Ok? Bye.

623
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,274
People! People!

624
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,378
People! People!

625
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:53,625
People! People, life
is a game of railway.

626
01:03:54,697 --> 01:04:01,159
Someone is left behind.
While someone joins in.

627
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:05,032
People! People!

628
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:10,236
People, life is a game of railway.

629
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:17,644
Someone is left behind.
While someone joins in.

630
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,747
People! People!

631
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,786
People! People!

632
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:47,543
God is the driver ahead.

633
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,551
And the guard behind is our fate.

634
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,813
God is the driver ahead.

635
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:00,222
And the guard behind is our fate.

636
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:08,761
He blows a whistle. He
waves a green flag.

637
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,037
Sometimes it runs on the track.

638
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,475
While sometimes it derails.

639
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:22,610
People, life is a game of railway.

640
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:30,159
Someone is left behind.
While someone joins in.

641
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,594
People! People!

642
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:26,571
I missed my station.
I got down half way.

643
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:35,380
I missed my station.
I got down half way.

644
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:44,222
My destination changed.
The train went on ahead.

645
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:53,135
I was caught without a ticket.
I landed in jail.

646
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:58,144
People, life is a game of railway.

647
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:05,315
Someone is left behind.
While someone joins in.

648
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,589
People! People!

649
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,023
People! People!

650
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,297
People! People!

651
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:25,036
'As Jojo Brigenza was not
convicted, the court frees him.'

652
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,039
'After understanding the
complication of this case..'

653
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,701
'..the court declares
Anthony a criminal.'

654
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,179
'And sentences him to 20
years of imprisonment.'

655
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:45,055
Inspector Vijay, you might
be feeling happy..

656
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:50,130
..that you've got me
jailed for 20 years.

657
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,368
But do you think I will
stay there for 20 years?

658
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,710
Your jail is like a matchbox for me.

659
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,737
I will break out easily
and run away.

660
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,512
No jail can stop me.

661
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,678
Pandu! Stop the van.

662
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:34,140
It can't stop you. I know
that no jail can stop you.

663
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,436
That's why I've come with you.

664
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,545
I won't send you to jail this time,
but directly to heaven.

665
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,139
Let me see how you come
back from there.

666
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:24,316
Scoundrel! Run for your life!

667
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,127
Forget the jail; I give you a
chance to run away from here.

668
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:32,529
Run!
- Look, inspector, this is illegal.

669
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,034
Dirty pig! You break law every day..

670
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,696
..and are teaching me what is law!

671
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,267
I know how to deal with your law.

672
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,641
I tell you this is not right.
You can't do this.

673
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:51,110
You don't know what I can do.
C'mon now! Run, you bastard!

674
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:55,121
I said run! - For God's sake,
let go of me, inspector.

675
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,590
I can't repeat the mistake
of leaving you alive.

676
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:03,796
Your criminal file will
be closed from today.

677
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,630
C'mon, run. Run, you bastard! Run!

678
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:12,137
C'mon, run. Run!
- Stop it, Vijay.

679
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,281
I won't let you do anything illegal.

680
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,213
To punish a criminal is not
something illegal; it's lawful.

681
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:27,446
Don't be foolish. The court
has already punished him.

682
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,090
I know the court has punished him..

683
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:32,159
..but this man won't go
through the punishment.

684
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:34,092
This wicked man will run away..

685
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,561
..and will harass innocent people.

686
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,627
I want to save all those
people from him.

687
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:43,704
Let me kill him now. - No, Vijay,
don't. - Let me kill him.

688
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,302
Stop it.

689
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,598
Sir, you will remember this day.

690
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,799
It will be a sad day of your life.

691
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,075
You will be responsible..

692
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:26,680
..for every crime and
murder he commits.

693
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:38,683
Listen, Jojo. Do what I say, ok?

694
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,763
No need to act smart.

695
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:50,700
Think like I do and not your way.
Or our plan will fail.

696
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,408
Got it? Do you remember
what I told you?

697
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:03,777
No, I've forgotten a little.
Tell me once again, brother.

698
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:08,580
Jojo, do you have a brain
or a rock in your head?

699
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,759
Come closer and listen carefully.

700
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,653
Give it to me.

701
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,258
C'mon, brother.

702
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,659
Vijay, I know.

703
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,274
I understand how bad you feel
about Tony running away.

704
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:36,777
But do you think it
doesn't bother me?

705
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,611
Don't I feel sad that
so many people died?

706
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,277
But I am a police officer, Vijay.

707
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:52,082
And all I know is that
our duty as policemen..

708
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:56,789
..is to hand over the culprit
to the law, not to punish them.

709
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,233
Who are we to decide on
someone's life or death?

710
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:07,708
You are right, sir.
Absolutely right.

711
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:11,770
Who are we to decide on
someone's life or death?

712
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:17,311
Only criminals like Tony have
a right to decide that.

713
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:23,691
Pardon me, sir, but the cause
of increasing crime is this.

714
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,661
The law which has bound us
has set the criminals free.

715
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,389
This is not a battle between equals.

716
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,331
The crime will always benefit.

717
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:38,069
If you want to stop this crime..

718
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,472
..tell the law to set me
and my companions free.

719
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,804
Till we are free of restrictions,
crime will not end.

720
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:53,080
I request you again, sir.
It is better that the law..

721
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:55,655
..remains in our hands rather
than the criminals.

722
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,250
Please, sir.

723
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,292
No, I can't permit you.

724
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,091
What happened today
can happen again.

725
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:12,035
Yet, I will say that our duty
is only to arrest criminals.

726
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:18,336
Only court can punish
them. I am sorry.

727
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,189
Did you call me, sir?

728
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:43,065
Mr. Tiwari, did you check
Jojo and Tony's house..

729
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:44,205
..after they were arrested?
- Yes.

730
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:48,639
What did you find?
- Different things.

731
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:52,542
Like a TV, a video, some
weapons, and a diary.

732
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:53,681
I have a list of all the things.

733
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:56,673
What was written in the diary?

734
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:58,749
Some addresses and
telephone numbers.

735
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,654
Go and get that diary.
- Yes, sir.

736
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,049
You're blowing the horn
in this deserted place.

737
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,349
You think I don't know
why you're blowing it?

738
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,784
My car horn is not working;
I am repairing it.

739
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:59,530
And is it against law to
blow horn in this place?

740
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:02,094
Teaching me law?

741
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,232
What are you doing?

742
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,078
What..

743
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,010
Law says that we should help..

744
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:19,711
..if someone's car has
broken down on the way.

745
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,620
Your horn was not working;
I repaired it.

746
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,504
What's the matter, sir?

747
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,674
Your tyre is totally destroyed.

748
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,786
One can't even make rubber
shoes out of it.

749
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,713
Looks like you dragged
it even after bursting.

750
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,518
Look, man, I am in a hurry.
I have to reach the airport.

751
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,320
Change the tyre fast.
C'mon, hurry up.

752
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:01,723
Ok, boss.

753
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:38,355
Bombay is a strange place, sir.
Everyone is in a hurry.

754
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:42,162
Some run this way and some
that way. For nothing.

755
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,205
Where are you going, man?
- Yours is a special car, sir.

756
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:50,174
I need a special screwdriver
for it. I'll be right back.

757
01:20:55,851 --> 01:21:00,481
Will you have tea?
- No tea.

758
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:05,450
What's the matter?

759
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:12,464
Look, Seema! See this.
- What about it?

760
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,397
Look over there.

761
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:23,173
They are the same people.
- Vijay had arrested them.

762
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:25,575
One of them was imprisoned,
but he ran away.

763
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,079
But what do you want to do now?

764
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,081
I want to call Vijay here.

765
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,318
Shekhar!

766
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:44,529
Playing smart with me, you rascal!

767
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,563
Don't you know who I am?

768
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:52,298
C'mon, change the tyre, or I'll
change the way you look.

769
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:58,740
Listen! My brother enjoys murdering.

770
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:05,045
Remember; one smart move and..

771
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:10,089
..your wife will be dead.

772
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,125
C'mon.

773
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:21,063
Hey man, how long will you take?

774
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,665
C'mon, Jojo. Let's go.

775
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:32,168
Brother, what are we to
do about this lady?

776
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:36,684
She will go with us and
will remain with us.

777
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,151
Or this man will play
some trick again.

778
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,161
Shekhar!

779
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:01,299
Seema!

780
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,746
Seema, run and call Vijay.

781
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,734
Hello. Police?
- Wrong number.

782
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:51,191
Hello. Police? - Yes. - Please,
call inspector Vijay quickly.

783
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,827
He's not here at the moment.
- Then send someone else.

784
01:23:56,231 --> 01:24:00,565
Jojo! Lift the car quickly.
- Ok, brother.

785
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,039
Bloody bastard!

786
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:09,574
I won't spare him. I will kill him.

787
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,284
Move, brother!

788
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:27,191
No! Shekhar!

789
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,337
No!

790
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:03,561
Shekhar! Shekhar!

791
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:06,032
Shekhar!

792
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,588
Where are you going up there?
Where are you going?

793
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,088
Jojo!

794
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:23,065
You killed my brother?!

795
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,566
I won't spare you.

796
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:38,746
I will kill you today.
I will kill you.

797
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:42,617
I will finish you.

798
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:48,090
Finish! Finish!

799
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,546
Bastard!

800
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:32,740
Vijay, why don't you
rest for a while?

801
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:35,241
You haven't gone home for a week.

802
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,742
If you keep working this
way, you will be ill.

803
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,476
Please, go home. I will take over.

804
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:45,050
Think again, Mr. Tony. You won't
get such a chance again.

805
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:51,681
I can't even get out of here.
How will we rob the bank?

806
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:55,590
If you can't do that, Ranjit
and I will do it.

807
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:58,357
Yes! And then you will go
directly to the jail!

808
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:02,091
It's been only a few days
since you got out of jail.

809
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,737
Do you want to go in again?

810
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:05,668
But my record is clear.

811
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:09,099
That inspector only suspects
me to be with you.

812
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,073
But he doesn't have any evidence.

813
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:15,705
But how will you do it alone?
- Brother!

814
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:18,647
Can I say something?
- What is it, Jojo?

815
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,448
I will go with him.
- Shut up!

816
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:25,456
I've told you a thousand times
not to go out of here.

817
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:28,592
Ok, brother.

818
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:39,067
I've come to tell you
something important.

819
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:48,744
Seema's mummy called me today.
She said Bobby is very ill.

820
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:53,481
He's been quiet and withdrawn
for many days now.

821
01:29:57,358 --> 01:30:02,455
Vijay, I can understand
if you don't meet me.

822
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,389
But you must go there.

823
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:18,201
He sits quiet for hours
and aims with the pistol.

824
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,740
I might try to overcome my grief..

825
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:26,212
..but I can't seeing him this way.

826
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:29,388
I don't know what I should do.

827
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,821
How do I console him
and convince him?

828
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,094
Don't worry. I will take
him out with me today..

829
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:40,166
..and will drop him
back in the evening.

830
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:43,098
He will feel better if
he goes out of here.

831
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:30,406
Rampyari! Rampyari!

832
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:34,754
Rampyari! Rampyari!

833
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:38,722
Rampyari! Rampyari!

834
01:31:38,893 --> 01:31:42,727
Rampyari! Rampyari!

835
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:48,460
Come, come, come. Come,
my Rampyari.

836
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:56,736
Come on, my Rampyari. God has
made us for each other.

837
01:31:56,911 --> 01:32:04,340
Come on, my Rampyari. God has
made us for each other.

838
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:08,387
I am unmarried. You
are unmarried, too.

839
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:16,190
Come on, my Rampyari. God has
made us for each other.

840
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:20,130
I am unmarried. You
are unmarried, too.

841
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:22,166
Come, come, come.

842
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:39,863
My heart is a little crazy.
My heart is a little crazy.

843
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:43,840
Your engine is equally old.

844
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:51,213
We are in the same state.

845
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:52,909
Come, come, come.

846
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:43,866
Come on, my Rampyari. God has
made us for each other.

847
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,699
Come, come, come.

848
01:35:45,873 --> 01:35:49,365
One night some thieves stole you.

849
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:03,341
Rampyari! Rampyari!

850
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:07,653
Rampyari! Rampyari!

851
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:11,280
Rampyari! Rampyari!

852
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,155
Rampyari! Rampyari!

853
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:19,128
One night some thieves stole you.

854
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,895
But they brought you
back next morning.

855
01:37:23,103 --> 01:37:26,869
One night some thieves stole you.

856
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:30,841
But they brought you
back next morning.

857
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:36,881
We can't handle it. We can't
handle it. It's a menace.

858
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:38,712
Come, come, come.

859
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:05,741
Come on, my Rampyari. God has
made us for each other.

860
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:09,371
I am unmarried. You
are unmarried, too.

861
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:18,857
Come on, my Rampyari. God has
made us for each other.

862
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:20,653
Come, come, come.

863
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:24,195
Rampyari! Rampyari!

864
01:38:24,365 --> 01:38:27,960
Rampyari! Rampyari!

865
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:31,764
Rampyari! Rampyari!

866
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:35,397
Rampyari! Rampyari!

867
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:39,239
Rampyari! Rampyari!

868
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:43,144
Rampyari! Rampyari!

869
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:49,112
Take this.
- Ok.

870
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:54,920
Here, hold it.

871
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:59,026
Here's an ice cream for you.
- Thank you.

872
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,633
Eat it quickly. Then
I'll drop you home.

873
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:06,197
Uncle, I enjoyed very much today.

874
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:08,364
When will you come to
take me out again?

875
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:12,007
Whenever I'll be free, we
will go out and have fun.

876
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:16,239
Will you tell me next time how
you catch robbers? - Yes.

877
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:18,351
I will tell you how..

878
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:36,131
Why next time? I will tell you
right now how I catch robbers.

879
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:39,067
Stay here; I'll be right back.

880
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:46,669
C'mon. Run!

881
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:42,334
On this side is a lot of money.
And on that side is the gun.

882
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:47,368
What are you thinking?

883
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:52,035
Take the revolver and play the
game of life and death with me.

884
01:40:55,115 --> 01:40:56,742
As soon as you take the gun..

885
01:40:56,917 --> 01:41:00,080
..and there's any bullet left
in my gun, you'll be dead.

886
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:02,722
And if I've fired all bullets,
I'll be dead.

887
01:41:08,862 --> 01:41:10,159
What are you thinking?

888
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:14,193
If that van comes up, you
won't get another chance.

889
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:23,165
Move. C'mon.

890
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:44,421
Get up; c'mon!

891
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:49,067
Move!

892
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:58,342
Inspector, I want to know if I
would have won this gamble or not.

893
01:42:26,106 --> 01:42:29,701
Whatever task we take up..

894
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:37,716
..inspector Vijay finds it
out like a sniffing dog.

895
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:45,818
I must finish that inspector today.

896
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:49,091
C'mon, Jojo. Let's go.

897
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,736
O my God! I didn't realize
it was so late.

898
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:59,964
It's the magic of your company.

899
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:03,200
No, brother, it's the
magic of your company.

900
01:43:03,377 --> 01:43:06,676
Seeing you so happy together..

901
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:09,680
..I feel like getting married, too.

902
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:14,412
Well, what's the matter? Is there
anyone you recall seeing us?

903
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:19,088
You can say there is and
there is not. - Really?

904
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:22,160
Is that why you kept looking
at your watch?

905
01:43:22,796 --> 01:43:25,788
No, it's not that. I'll be off now.

906
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:26,933
Bye.

907
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:37,239
Sapna! Your parcel.
- Thank you, brother.

908
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:43,912
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

909
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:52,926
Hi! When did you come?

910
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:06,339
Only 3 hours back. - I'm sorry; I
didn't know you were going to come.

911
01:44:06,506 --> 01:44:07,871
I wasn't expecting you.

912
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:13,945
Yes, I have learned that you
weren't expecting me today.

913
01:44:15,382 --> 01:44:17,976
That is why you booked your
night with someone else.

914
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:23,948
What do you mean?

915
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:29,752
You should be ashamed
to say such a thing.

916
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:35,301
Me, and not you?

917
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,864
Who was that man?

918
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:48,075
Now I get what is bothering
you and troubling you.

919
01:44:48,382 --> 01:44:53,945
You want to hear? I'll tell
you who that man was.

920
01:44:59,092 --> 01:45:05,053
That man was my boyfriend and
I was having fun with him.

921
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:12,328
Now you might want to know
how he entertained me.

922
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:16,674
He called me this
evening and asked..

923
01:45:16,843 --> 01:45:20,404
..Sapna darling, what
are you doing tonight?

924
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:23,716
I said, nothing. He said, great.

925
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:27,943
I will pick you up this
evening and we'll go out.

926
01:45:28,121 --> 01:45:30,146
It's been quite long since we met.

927
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:35,221
Then he took me to a five
star hotel room..

928
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:41,892
..and took me in his arms;
and then pulled me..

929
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:57,077
I am glad that you thought that
you have a right over me.

930
01:45:58,218 --> 01:46:00,743
But you've never given
me that right.

931
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:07,919
Goodbye.

932
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:42,124
Ready, Jojo?
- Yes, brother.

933
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:13,692
Vijay! Vijay!

934
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:17,662
Vijay! Vijay!

935
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:18,991
Vijay!

936
01:47:36,917 --> 01:47:41,877
No need to worry. The surgery
has been successful.

937
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:48,990
If you had been late.. anyways,
he's a lucky man.

938
01:47:53,867 --> 01:47:56,700
Thank you, doctor. I'll go now.

939
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:00,101
Excuse me!

940
01:48:04,377 --> 01:48:11,749
What is he to you? I mean,
how are you related to him?

941
01:48:14,054 --> 01:48:22,393
He is no relation. He's just a
stranger who needed my help.

942
01:48:27,934 --> 01:48:30,664
Welcome.
- How are you now, brother?

943
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:33,670
Brother is fine; he's joining
the duty from tomorrow.

944
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:38,739
Sir, he is my younger brother,
Ajay. She's Neetu. - Hello.

945
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:42,006
God bless you. You guys chat;
I will wait for you tomorrow.

946
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,171
Bye.

947
01:48:45,785 --> 01:48:48,379
Come; sit down. Why
are you standing?

948
01:48:48,788 --> 01:48:51,723
There's tea over there if
you want to have some.

949
01:48:51,892 --> 01:48:56,261
We'll be off in a while, bro.
We want to go somewhere else.

950
01:48:56,863 --> 01:49:02,961
Where? - A place where..
- Is it a secret place?

951
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:09,673
No, brother, it's not that.
- Then what is it?

952
01:49:09,843 --> 01:49:12,334
Well, brother..
- I will tell you, brother.

953
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:17,649
You were in a critical condition,
and Ajay..

954
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:22,652
..who never goes to a temple and
says that God is within us..

955
01:49:22,822 --> 01:49:28,124
..went to a temple that
day and prayed..

956
01:49:28,295 --> 01:49:32,925
No, brother, it's not true. She's..
- Keep quiet. Let her speak.

957
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:38,662
He went to a temple
that day and prayed..

958
01:49:38,838 --> 01:49:42,831
..God, save my brother.

959
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:47,409
Take my life if you want to,
but please, save my brother.

960
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:50,409
And you recovered little by little.

961
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:53,178
He is taking me there today.

962
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:58,357
She's exaggerating, bro. I
went there, but I did not..

963
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,755
Good morning, Mr. Vijay.
- Good morning, doctor.

964
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:04,294
Hello. - Hello. - So, how are
you feeling now? - Fine.

965
01:50:05,131 --> 01:50:12,230
We take your leave, brother.
- Goodbye.

966
01:50:15,475 --> 01:50:22,745
You are fine now. You can
go home today or tomorrow.

967
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:24,144
Thank you, doctor.

968
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:28,054
But I want to tell you something
before you leave.

969
01:50:30,156 --> 01:50:31,714
A girl brought you here..

970
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:35,452
..when you were unconscious
and serious.

971
01:50:37,097 --> 01:50:42,194
If she hadn't brought you here,
or if she had been late..

972
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:47,033
..there was no hope to
save you, Mr. Vijay.

973
01:50:49,943 --> 01:50:57,475
I thought she might be your
own.. I mean a relation.

974
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,917
But when I asked how she
was related to you..

975
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:05,417
..she said, she was
not your relative.

976
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:10,725
He is only a stranger
who needed my help.

977
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:19,204
And she left. We don't get to
see such people these days.

978
01:51:19,973 --> 01:51:24,933
'I am glad that you thought that
you have a right over me.'

979
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:28,775
'But you've never given
me that right.'

980
01:51:43,897 --> 01:51:45,194
Can I come in?

981
01:52:17,964 --> 01:52:21,832
I have come to tell
you something today.

982
01:52:26,806 --> 01:52:35,214
I had tried to say this
to someone before..

983
01:52:36,883 --> 01:52:40,979
..but fate did not give me a chance.

984
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:51,955
And my feelings remained untold.

985
01:52:55,401 --> 01:53:00,668
And.. since that day.. I felt that..

986
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:06,745
..some stranger had haunted me.

987
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:15,687
A person whose anger, hatred..

988
01:53:15,855 --> 01:53:23,159
..and bitterness burst
out, but not love.

989
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:34,697
It's a strange story why and..

990
01:53:34,874 --> 01:53:39,868
..how all that happened.

991
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,971
And it has made me
a peculiar person.

992
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:51,719
A person who needs alcohol..

993
01:53:51,891 --> 01:53:58,353
..to express his feelings.

994
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:12,673
Sapna, perhaps I won't
be able to say again..

995
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:21,151
..what I want to tell you today.

996
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:26,991
But please, remember it.

997
01:54:33,867 --> 01:54:35,698
I love you, Sapna.

998
01:54:39,305 --> 01:54:40,704
I love you.

999
01:54:42,208 --> 01:54:47,737
And if you agree, I
want to marry you.

1000
01:55:03,363 --> 01:55:08,858
Then listen. Whether you
say it again or not..

1001
01:55:10,270 --> 01:55:12,864
..I will continue to
say it all my life.

1002
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:18,310
I love you. I love you.

1003
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:12,094
Vijay, I've brought Ranjit out
of the lockup only for 6 hours.

1004
01:56:12,832 --> 01:56:14,265
Ask quickly whatever
you want to ask him.

1005
01:56:14,767 --> 01:56:15,893
I have to take him back quickly.

1006
01:56:26,179 --> 01:56:29,273
I will deal with this
smart man later.

1007
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:34,909
First I want to inquire
that dirty pig.

1008
01:56:38,057 --> 01:56:42,050
Ahmed, you are not allowed to
drink it, but you can hold it.

1009
01:56:42,228 --> 01:56:43,195
Hold it, man.

1010
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:57,375
Look, I am running out of time,
so answer me quickly.

1011
01:56:58,144 --> 01:57:00,635
Where did you bury the dead body..

1012
01:57:00,813 --> 01:57:03,873
..of that poor woman
after raping her?

1013
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:08,186
Which woman? What dead body?
I know nothing.

1014
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:10,185
I am a straightforward man.

1015
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:14,224
Either you are mistaken
or you're too drunk.

1016
01:57:15,161 --> 01:57:20,098
Yes, yes, I've drunk too
much. You know why?

1017
01:57:22,235 --> 01:57:24,897
You don't? I'll tell you.

1018
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:33,172
If you won't tell me, I will
throw you down from here.

1019
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:39,008
When your body will bang on
the ground from this height..

1020
01:57:39,786 --> 01:57:42,778
..it will burst like a tomato.

1021
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:51,726
Vijay! - And when I will be
presented in the court..

1022
01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:58,895
..my lawyer will say, Mr. Vijay
didn't kill him intentionally.

1023
01:57:59,806 --> 01:58:03,765
Perhaps he shoved him a little
under the effect of alcohol.

1024
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:08,804
It's not a murder, but an accident.

1025
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:14,384
And I will also go scot-free
as you all do.

1026
01:58:22,895 --> 01:58:26,888
Now tell me, where have
you buried the woman?

1027
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:32,328
Where have you buried the dead body?

1028
01:58:36,976 --> 01:58:38,375
I ask you the last time;
answer me truly.

1029
01:58:39,412 --> 01:58:43,678
Or you are only 1 foot and one..

1030
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:48,878
..push away from your death.

1031
01:58:49,055 --> 01:58:54,994
Hey pal! Don't be scared;
he's only threatening you.

1032
01:58:55,161 --> 01:58:57,721
As they say, one who is scared dies.

1033
01:58:57,964 --> 01:59:02,628
Our bodies are strong as iron, and
this man's hand is of glass.

1034
01:59:03,002 --> 01:59:04,731
Don't be taken in by him.

1035
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,643
Will you say or not?

1036
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:30,719
Vijay! What have you done?
Are you out of your mind?

1037
01:59:30,897 --> 01:59:32,956
Are you hallucinated? This
is a cold-blooded murder.

1038
01:59:33,132 --> 01:59:37,330
I must arrest.. - Ahmed! I
am totally agitated today.

1039
01:59:38,104 --> 01:59:40,334
I just need an excuse to murder.

1040
01:59:40,907 --> 01:59:45,367
Don't try and stop me or I'll
kill you, too. Now move! Move!

1041
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:50,780
Vijay! Don't be silly. This is
illegal. - What is illegal?

1042
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:54,181
Haven't you ever killed a poisonous
scorpion or snake?

1043
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:58,722
Tell me. - Yes, I have. But
he's a human, not an animal.

1044
01:59:58,891 --> 02:00:01,291
Yes! Simply because
they are humans..

1045
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:03,690
..they have brains
and they can think.

1046
02:00:03,863 --> 02:00:09,699
They play tricks with law. They
shouldn't be left alive. C'mon.

1047
02:00:10,136 --> 02:00:17,975
Vijay! Stop! - Glass hand, eh? -
Wait! What do you want to know?

1048
02:00:19,245 --> 02:00:21,236
Where are Jojo and Tony?

1049
02:00:22,448 --> 02:00:26,316
Rakesh Mills, Colaba Post Office.

1050
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:29,354
Got that, inspector Ahmed?

1051
02:00:41,467 --> 02:00:44,436
Hey, send Patil up.

1052
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:55,210
Well done, inspector Patil.

1053
02:00:55,982 --> 02:00:58,815
You should work in movies
and not the police force.

1054
02:00:58,985 --> 02:01:01,249
Take the bastard away.
- C'mon.

1055
02:01:04,924 --> 02:01:05,856
Well done, inspector.

1056
02:01:06,792 --> 02:01:09,727
Listen! Give me the bottle.

1057
02:01:09,962 --> 02:01:12,021
I asked you to hold it,
not take it home.

1058
02:04:57,957 --> 02:05:00,824
Hello.
- Hello, Tony. Goli speaking.

1059
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:03,824
There's bad news for you.
- What happened?

1060
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:07,991
Inspector Vijay ran over your
brother, Jojo, with his car.

1061
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:11,159
What? I don't like such jokes.

1062
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:15,397
I'm not kidding. If you don't believe
me, read this evening's paper.

1063
02:05:34,927 --> 02:05:38,124
Inspector Vijay Verma!

1064
02:05:40,165 --> 02:05:42,133
Bastard!

1065
02:05:44,503 --> 02:05:45,936
Tony! Tony, what's wrong with you?

1066
02:05:56,982 --> 02:06:05,356
You.. you killed my brother.
You killed Jojo!

1067
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:15,098
I won't spare you.
I will finish you.

1068
02:06:15,968 --> 02:06:17,299
And your brother, too.

1069
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:35,309
Hello. - Good morning, Mr.
Forgetful. - Good morning.

1070
02:06:35,788 --> 02:06:38,689
I haven't forgotten. I was
just going to call you.

1071
02:06:38,924 --> 02:06:41,859
Really? Tell me, have you
talked to your brother?

1072
02:06:42,027 --> 02:06:47,021
My brother? - So you forgot!
- No, no, it's not that.

1073
02:06:47,866 --> 02:06:50,994
Then what is it?
- Well, I will talk to brother.

1074
02:06:51,203 --> 02:06:59,201
I will, but you see, I am mustering
courage to talk to him.

1075
02:06:59,378 --> 02:07:03,644
If you won't tell him
about our marriage..

1076
02:07:03,816 --> 02:07:09,152
..I will complain directly to
Mr. Commissioner. Got it?

1077
02:07:09,321 --> 02:07:11,221
Yes, earlier people accidentally..

1078
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:13,381
..used to come in the way of pistol.

1079
02:07:13,959 --> 02:07:17,053
Now people come in the
way of your car.

1080
02:07:17,229 --> 02:07:19,697
Sir, anyone can meet an accident.
- Yes.

1081
02:07:20,032 --> 02:07:22,159
But you always collide with people..

1082
02:07:22,334 --> 02:07:24,802
..who have criminal records,
who are professionals.

1083
02:07:25,804 --> 02:07:27,829
Can I know the reason behind
this coincidence?

1084
02:07:29,041 --> 02:07:33,000
Policemen meet such people
every day, sir.

1085
02:07:33,245 --> 02:07:35,805
They keep facing such people
and colliding into them.

1086
02:07:38,117 --> 02:07:40,415
Ok, hand your report
to the department.

1087
02:07:40,886 --> 02:07:46,188
And drive carefully and on the
road next time. - Yes, sir.

1088
02:07:48,861 --> 02:07:56,961
Listen! I want to ask this for
myself, not the department.

1089
02:07:59,004 --> 02:08:06,877
Do I look or seem like a person..

1090
02:08:07,746 --> 02:08:09,737
..who would believe your story?

1091
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:12,277
Yes, sir.

1092
02:08:16,055 --> 02:08:19,183
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1093
02:08:28,901 --> 02:08:33,929
Brother, the matter is..

1094
02:08:39,378 --> 02:08:47,945
Brother, actually the
thing is.. well.. I..

1095
02:08:53,826 --> 02:08:57,990
You've cleared your throat 20
times in the last 15 minutes.

1096
02:08:58,831 --> 02:09:03,131
You've stammered 25 times
and coughed 30 times.

1097
02:09:03,302 --> 02:09:07,864
You've drunk all the water, but
haven't come to the point yet.

1098
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:10,333
You tell me what the matter is.

1099
02:09:11,076 --> 02:09:13,135
Why don't you say it? What
Is there to be scared of?

1100
02:09:13,312 --> 02:09:16,179
You are not the first man on this
earth who's going to do it.

1101
02:09:16,348 --> 02:09:19,943
What? What is he going to do?

1102
02:09:20,786 --> 02:09:27,658
Well, brother.. you see..
- Don't get started again!

1103
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:30,321
Why don't you tell him?
Why are you scared?

1104
02:09:30,796 --> 02:09:35,028
Ok, if you say, I will tell him.

1105
02:09:38,137 --> 02:09:40,901
Brother.. why don't you get married?

1106
02:09:49,014 --> 02:09:53,678
It's quite late in the night; it's
difficult to get a girl at this time.

1107
02:09:53,919 --> 02:09:56,683
If I wake a girl at this hour
and ask her to marry me..

1108
02:09:56,855 --> 02:09:58,186
..what will she think of me?

1109
02:09:58,357 --> 02:10:00,120
Idiot! Why don't you come out
with what you want to say?

1110
02:10:00,292 --> 02:10:02,988
I'll tell you, brother.

1111
02:10:03,796 --> 02:10:08,733
We love each other and
want to get married.

1112
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:12,700
So we've come to take your
permission and blessings.

1113
02:10:15,107 --> 02:10:16,335
Stand up!

1114
02:10:18,877 --> 02:10:22,176
Silly! Why did you take so long
to give me this good news?

1115
02:10:23,949 --> 02:10:25,712
You know you're the first one..

1116
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:29,217
..to get married after our
father in our family.

1117
02:10:29,488 --> 02:10:31,888
Here, take this. Cheers!

1118
02:10:43,936 --> 02:10:51,172
I came drunk secretly.

1119
02:10:52,511 --> 02:10:59,940
Then I ate a Paan. And
also applied perfume.

1120
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:08,723
Then I braced myself
and came walking.

1121
02:11:09,328 --> 02:11:14,732
But I stumbled and got caught.

1122
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:18,996
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1123
02:11:21,373 --> 02:11:25,366
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1124
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:29,776
A hen told a cock and a parrot
told another parrot.

1125
02:11:30,015 --> 02:11:34,008
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1126
02:11:35,954 --> 02:11:40,721
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1127
02:11:57,843 --> 02:12:02,212
My joy increases and
I feel more high.

1128
02:12:04,483 --> 02:12:08,283
My heart dances when
you come closer.

1129
02:12:08,453 --> 02:12:12,412
When I see you, I think.

1130
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:16,755
When I see you, I think.

1131
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:20,956
You're so beautiful; are
you a girl or some magic?

1132
02:12:21,133 --> 02:12:25,035
This fair complexion
and dark eyes.

1133
02:12:27,172 --> 02:12:31,268
This fair complexion
and dark eyes.

1134
02:12:31,443 --> 02:12:35,709
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1135
02:13:01,473 --> 02:13:05,876
I am still a bachelor.
I can't go on like this.

1136
02:13:06,044 --> 02:13:10,174
I am still a bachelor.
I can't go on like this.

1137
02:13:10,349 --> 02:13:14,718
The marriage pavilion is ready.
Drums are playing.

1138
02:13:14,886 --> 02:13:18,947
If you wish, marry me right now.

1139
02:13:19,124 --> 02:13:23,288
If you wish, marry me right now.

1140
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:27,694
I am better off alone.
Marriage is a hassle.

1141
02:13:27,866 --> 02:13:31,927
It's an ongoing trouble.
It's serving the wife.

1142
02:13:32,104 --> 02:13:36,165
It's serving the wife.
It's serving the wife.

1143
02:13:37,342 --> 02:13:40,175
And then come the children.

1144
02:13:42,014 --> 02:13:44,983
Even the strong hearted cry.

1145
02:13:46,818 --> 02:13:51,755
I don't want to be a parrot
and live in a cage.

1146
02:13:51,923 --> 02:14:00,092
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1147
02:14:25,857 --> 02:14:29,953
One can't lock a heart or love.

1148
02:14:30,128 --> 02:14:33,859
The bride and the groom
glow like flowers.

1149
02:14:34,032 --> 02:14:37,934
She's the queen and he a king.
Happiness is all around.

1150
02:14:38,103 --> 02:14:42,039
She's the queen and he a king.
Happiness is all around.

1151
02:14:42,207 --> 02:14:46,200
The wedding is on. And there's
still half night to go.

1152
02:14:46,378 --> 02:14:50,371
I will sing and dance all night.

1153
02:14:52,517 --> 02:14:56,453
I will sing and dance all night.

1154
02:14:56,621 --> 02:15:00,648
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1155
02:15:00,826 --> 02:15:04,728
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1156
02:15:04,896 --> 02:15:08,730
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1157
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:13,928
Don't preach me today.
My heart is overjoyed.

1158
02:15:34,326 --> 02:15:37,352
What's this? You're
going on a honeymoon.

1159
02:15:37,529 --> 02:15:39,087
Why are you crying on
this happy occasion?

1160
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:40,231
What's wrong?

1161
02:15:41,766 --> 02:15:47,227
Brother, I recalled something
old after hugging you.

1162
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:52,071
Perhaps it's not the right time,
yet, I'd like to say it.

1163
02:15:53,879 --> 02:15:55,710
It happened a few years back.

1164
02:15:57,415 --> 02:16:01,351
One night you came home drunk,
probably for the first time.

1165
02:16:02,888 --> 02:16:06,915
I saw you stumbling
with intoxication.

1166
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:10,694
I was scared and kept lying
with my eyes closed.

1167
02:16:12,764 --> 02:16:13,924
You came in the room.

1168
02:16:16,134 --> 02:16:20,662
You bent down on me.

1169
02:16:23,875 --> 02:16:28,369
And stroked my head with love.

1170
02:16:31,983 --> 02:16:36,386
And then you sat down beside me.

1171
02:16:40,058 --> 02:16:44,927
You started blabbering. You said..

1172
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:54,368
I've returned home today
only because of you.

1173
02:16:54,539 --> 02:16:56,871
For you.

1174
02:17:03,815 --> 02:17:04,941
I am robbed.

1175
02:17:07,352 --> 02:17:14,656
My life has become aimless
and meaningless.

1176
02:17:18,897 --> 02:17:20,023
Meaningless.

1177
02:17:24,102 --> 02:17:33,238
I wished to end this
useless life, but..

1178
02:17:38,817 --> 02:17:47,247
..then I thought of you..
and I stopped.

1179
02:17:50,428 --> 02:17:54,922
I understood that you had felt
very bad about something.

1180
02:17:56,067 --> 02:18:00,163
I kept my eyes shut and
suffered in my heart.

1181
02:18:01,072 --> 02:18:07,102
I wished to open my
eyes and hug you..

1182
02:18:08,013 --> 02:18:11,847
..but.. I kept laid scared.

1183
02:18:14,152 --> 02:18:20,955
Don't know why I recalled that
night after hugging you today.

1184
02:18:23,395 --> 02:18:26,956
Look, it's a joyous day today;
let's recall the good things.

1185
02:18:27,198 --> 02:18:30,793
Why talk of the sorrow? C'mon,
wipe your tears.

1186
02:18:31,102 --> 02:18:32,967
Go happily for your honeymoon.

1187
02:18:33,204 --> 02:18:37,698
Go happily and return happily.
C'mon, get in the car.

1188
02:18:37,876 --> 02:18:39,741
Bless us, brother.
- What are you doing?

1189
02:18:39,978 --> 02:18:45,245
Hey! I forgot in this chaos that
I am to give you something.

1190
02:18:45,483 --> 02:18:49,180
I don't want anything
except your blessings.

1191
02:18:49,354 --> 02:18:52,187
You have that; yet, I should gift
you something as I am elder.

1192
02:18:52,424 --> 02:18:56,827
If you must, give me a promise.

1193
02:18:56,995 --> 02:18:59,156
Yes, just tell me. You will
get anything you ask today.

1194
02:18:59,331 --> 02:19:04,860
Then promise me that you will
live with us now and not alone.

1195
02:19:05,804 --> 02:19:11,936
But.. - You just promised that
you will give her anything.

1196
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:13,634
It's been just a day
to your wedding..

1197
02:19:13,812 --> 02:19:14,904
..and you've already started
defending your wife!

1198
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:18,243
Ok, I'll do what you say.
Get in the car now. C'mon.

1199
02:19:23,788 --> 02:19:28,384
Goodbye, brother.
- Go happily and take care.

1200
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:30,118
You take care, too, brother.

1201
02:19:55,487 --> 02:19:57,421
How far is Khandala?

1202
02:19:57,856 --> 02:20:01,087
Never mind that; I am
not far from you.

1203
02:20:02,093 --> 02:20:08,862
You mean? - I mean I am not only
your driver, but husband, too.

1204
02:20:09,067 --> 02:20:12,127
Then why this distance?

1205
02:20:13,805 --> 02:20:16,706
Let us reach Khandala, there
will be no distance then.

1206
02:20:17,142 --> 02:20:24,207
And we will become one.

1207
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:33,285
But Khandala is still very far; how
shall I pass such a long time?

1208
02:21:08,326 --> 02:21:11,420
License.
- But what have we done, inspector?

1209
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:17,097
Neetu!
- No!

1210
02:21:48,967 --> 02:21:53,267
'Then promise that you will live
with us now and not alone.'

1211
02:22:26,804 --> 02:22:32,242
'I wished to open my
eyes and hug you..'

1212
02:22:34,946 --> 02:22:37,346
'..but.. I kept laid scared.'

1213
02:22:39,817 --> 02:22:44,151
'Come and hug me now.'

1214
02:22:45,957 --> 02:22:52,089
'I am not drunk today. Look,
I am standing before you.'

1215
02:22:55,099 --> 02:23:00,935
'I am not drunk today. Open
your eyes and hug me.'

1216
02:23:01,105 --> 02:23:05,906
'Ajay, open your eyes.
Get up, Ajay! Get up!'

1217
02:23:07,211 --> 02:23:13,172
'Why don't you get up? Why
not? C'mon, get up.'

1218
02:23:14,185 --> 02:23:16,745
Why don't you get up? C'mon, get up.

1219
02:23:17,855 --> 02:23:26,194
I am not drunk today. C'mon,
get up. Come and hug me.

1220
02:23:26,864 --> 02:23:31,392
Hug me..come..

1221
02:24:51,249 --> 02:24:53,376
Where is Tony? - I swear I
don't know. I really don't.

1222
02:24:53,551 --> 02:24:54,745
Where is Tony?
- I don't know.

1223
02:25:03,828 --> 02:25:04,954
O my God!

1224
02:26:25,777 --> 02:26:26,903
C'mon, c'mon.

1225
02:26:32,049 --> 02:26:37,783
Hello. - Hello. Hello. Sapna,
Vijay here. - Hello.

1226
02:26:37,955 --> 02:26:40,355
Look, don't go out of the house
and don't let anyone in.

1227
02:26:40,792 --> 02:26:43,056
I can't hear you; just hold on.

1228
02:26:43,828 --> 02:26:47,127
I said don't go out of the house
and don't let anyone in.

1229
02:26:47,298 --> 02:26:49,266
Hold on; I can't hear you.

1230
02:26:57,542 --> 02:26:58,736
Who is it?

1231
02:27:00,044 --> 02:27:00,942
You?!

1232
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:17,227
What.. what do you want?
- Your life.

1233
02:27:17,762 --> 02:27:21,095
But don't worry; I won't
kill you so soon.

1234
02:27:21,399 --> 02:27:26,928
First I will enjoy myself,
little by little. Slowly.

1235
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:32,838
I will cut you into pieces; I will
kill you; I will finish you.

1236
02:27:38,850 --> 02:27:40,215
No!

1237
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:44,117
Let go of it!
- Vijay!

1238
02:27:44,288 --> 02:27:52,024
No! No! - Sapna! Hello, Sapna.
- Let go of me!

1239
02:27:59,070 --> 02:28:00,867
Let go of me!

1240
02:28:07,745 --> 02:28:08,803
Bloody bitch!

1241
02:28:17,922 --> 02:28:20,356
No! No!

1242
02:28:20,825 --> 02:28:22,315
No!

1243
02:28:24,829 --> 02:28:25,921
No!

1244
02:31:07,858 --> 02:31:13,319
Let go! Help! - What is going
on here? - Please, help me!

1245
02:31:13,531 --> 02:31:16,329
Or that man will kill me.
- Who? - Please, please.

1246
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:20,903
Sir! He is Tony Briganza.
- Yes, I am Tony Briganza.

1247
02:31:21,072 --> 02:31:22,869
Come and lock me inside.

1248
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,770
But remember; I have surrendered
on my own.

1249
02:31:25,943 --> 02:31:30,403
If anything happens to me,
you will be responsible.

1250
02:31:30,581 --> 02:31:32,947
Where is that bastard?
I will kill him.

1251
02:31:33,551 --> 02:31:36,816
Vijay! What are you doing?
- Move! - Are you out of your mind?

1252
02:31:37,021 --> 02:31:41,754
Yes, I've gone mad. Look, Ahmed,
I am out of my mind.

1253
02:31:41,926 --> 02:31:45,828
I don't know what I might do if
you try to stop me. - Stop it!

1254
02:31:46,864 --> 02:31:49,765
Give me your gun! Give me the gun!
- Let go of me!

1255
02:31:49,934 --> 02:31:52,198
I will kill that bastard.
- Vijay!

1256
02:31:52,369 --> 02:31:54,360
He is under our protection
at present.

1257
02:31:54,538 --> 02:31:56,335
And I can't let you
do anything illegal.

1258
02:31:56,574 --> 02:32:00,738
You know it's illegal.
- Yes, I know well it's illegal.

1259
02:32:01,045 --> 02:32:02,672
Don't try and teach
me the bloody law.

1260
02:32:02,847 --> 02:32:05,975
Where was your law when he
killed innocent people?

1261
02:32:06,183 --> 02:32:07,673
Where was your law when he killed..

1262
02:32:07,852 --> 02:32:10,150
..my friend Shekhar and his wife?

1263
02:32:10,788 --> 02:32:13,689
Where was your law when he killed..

1264
02:32:13,858 --> 02:32:15,723
..my innocent brother and his wife?

1265
02:32:15,926 --> 02:32:18,258
I don't care a damn
for your bloody law.

1266
02:32:18,429 --> 02:32:23,025
Just leave me! - Stop it! Don't
be silly, Vijay! Stop it!

1267
02:32:36,947 --> 02:32:40,713
What's this?
- It's a badge, sir.

1268
02:32:41,886 --> 02:32:45,720
A badge, which I wore
and vowed to protect..

1269
02:32:45,890 --> 02:32:49,917
..all decent and lawful
people of the city.

1270
02:32:51,262 --> 02:32:55,824
I was told that the badge had
much power and authority..

1271
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,731
..with which I will be able
to protect the laymen..

1272
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:02,668
..from criminals and hooligans.

1273
02:33:03,807 --> 02:33:06,799
But after 10 years of service,
I am assured that..

1274
02:33:07,845 --> 02:33:11,144
..the badge has no such
power or authority.

1275
02:33:12,917 --> 02:33:16,683
It is just a piece of tin,
which protects..

1276
02:33:16,854 --> 02:33:20,950
..only the murderers and
professional criminals.

1277
02:33:23,194 --> 02:33:28,131
I break that oath and make
another vow today..

1278
02:33:28,299 --> 02:33:35,705
..which I will never break nor
can anyone force me to break.

1279
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:39,707
I swear on my brother and his wife..

1280
02:33:39,877 --> 02:33:44,177
..my friend and his wife and
the other innocent souls..

1281
02:33:45,015 --> 02:33:49,714
..that your entire police force
and all the power of the world..

1282
02:33:49,887 --> 02:33:54,950
..will not be able to take Tony
to the court tomorrow.

1283
02:34:08,005 --> 02:34:09,700
Send inspector Ahmed quickly.

1284
02:34:15,479 --> 02:34:18,676
Sir! - Vijay just resigned
and said that..

1285
02:34:18,849 --> 02:34:25,846
..we can't take Tony to
the court alive tomorrow.

1286
02:34:27,157 --> 02:34:30,820
Hearing him, I felt
he meant business.

1287
02:34:31,795 --> 02:34:34,696
We should be cautious
in this matter.

1288
02:34:35,065 --> 02:34:36,032
Do this; call at the..

1289
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:39,033
..Central Reserve Police Force
headquarters. - Yes, sir.

1290
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:58,888
I can understand him
taking the weapons.

1291
02:34:59,957 --> 02:35:04,223
But even Vijay knew that
it was fake currency.

1292
02:35:04,828 --> 02:35:06,090
So why did he take it?

1293
02:35:14,905 --> 02:35:16,668
This is half the amount.

1294
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:19,238
I'll give you the other half
after the job is done.

1295
02:35:19,843 --> 02:35:25,110
But.. why do you want to do it?

1296
02:35:25,349 --> 02:35:27,408
What matters to you? The
money or the intention?

1297
02:35:28,385 --> 02:35:31,843
Yet, I'd like to know why all this.

1298
02:35:54,311 --> 02:35:55,278
This is why.

1299
02:35:58,882 --> 02:36:06,914
Do you have a plan?
- Yes, I do. Foolproof.

1300
02:36:27,444 --> 02:36:30,242
Inspector Shinde?
- Yes. - I am inspector Bhagvat.

1301
02:36:30,414 --> 02:36:32,382
We've come from the
CRP headquarters.

1302
02:36:32,783 --> 02:36:37,413
Yes, I'd been waiting for you.
sakharam! - Yes, sir?

1303
02:36:37,588 --> 02:36:38,919
Get Tony out.

1304
02:36:41,825 --> 02:36:43,759
Sign here.

1305
02:36:48,198 --> 02:36:51,929
Be careful; Tony Brigenza is
a very dangerous criminal.

1306
02:36:52,803 --> 02:36:55,738
C'mon. Move!

1307
02:36:59,843 --> 02:37:01,003
Get in.

1308
02:37:41,518 --> 02:37:45,784
Inspector Shinde?
- Yes. - I am inspector Bhagvat.

1309
02:37:45,956 --> 02:37:48,925
I've come from the CRP headquarters
to take Tony.

1310
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:52,693
Then.. who were they?

1311
02:37:53,831 --> 02:37:57,130
I knew something was wrong
somewhere, Mr. Tony.

1312
02:37:58,068 --> 02:38:02,164
But I found his plan of getting
you out of the jail perfect.

1313
02:38:03,807 --> 02:38:09,074
I thought I'd get you out once,
and then I'd deal with him.

1314
02:38:10,814 --> 02:38:13,180
I am not that foolish, sir.

1315
02:38:13,350 --> 02:38:16,842
I changed the plan so smartly
that he'll regret all his life.

1316
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:21,013
He must be waiting on the
Ahmedabad highway for us.

1317
02:38:21,859 --> 02:38:26,922
But we'll reach Thane Creek.
The boat is ready for you.

1318
02:39:07,237 --> 02:39:08,261
Mr. Tony!

1319
02:39:17,014 --> 02:39:20,643
Is this your perfect plan?
Bloody fool!

1320
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:05,760
Finish the rascal!

1321
02:40:15,539 --> 02:40:16,938
Stop it!

1322
02:43:59,429 --> 02:44:00,987
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

1323
02:44:04,167 --> 02:44:07,659
Please don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!

1324
02:44:07,838 --> 02:44:10,102
I beg of you.
Please, don't kill me.

1325
02:44:10,273 --> 02:44:12,673
Let me go. Please, forgive me.

1326
02:44:15,779 --> 02:44:19,715
Here, take this. There's a lot
of money in it. Take it all.

1327
02:44:19,883 --> 02:44:22,078
But please, let go of me.

1328
02:45:41,464 --> 02:45:43,227
Help! Help!

1329
02:45:49,072 --> 02:45:51,199
Help! Help!

1330
02:45:51,841 --> 02:45:57,780
Stop, Mr. Verma!
- Help! Help!

1331
02:45:58,815 --> 02:46:03,980
Don't misuse the law out of anger,
or you will pay for it.

1332
02:46:06,823 --> 02:46:07,881
Please, Mr. Verma.

1333
02:46:08,058 --> 02:46:11,289
You are under the oath of the law
You protected all these years.

1334
02:46:11,761 --> 02:46:15,663
You are under the oath of your
friend, Shekhar. Please, stop.

1335
02:46:16,032 --> 02:46:21,299
You are under the oath of your
brother. Stop for God's sake.

1336
02:47:48,958 --> 02:47:53,327
What's the matter? Where
is Tony? Ahmed!

1337
02:47:56,800 --> 02:48:02,864
Sir.. I don't know. I
reached here just now.

1338
02:48:10,780 --> 02:48:14,716

1346
02:48:42,479 --> 02:48:46,939

a person who'd believe you?
