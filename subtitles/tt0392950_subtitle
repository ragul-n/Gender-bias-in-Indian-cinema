1
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,643
It's extremely kind of you.
- Very magnanimous

2
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,648
If the priest could give
us the go ahead now

3
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,787
"With Allah's wishes,
the alliance is sealed"

4
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:46,993
The fifteenth of this month
is auspicious for the wedding

5
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:52,336
"Priest, when you have given us
your approval, why the delay?"

6
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,663
"What say, Sadaqat Miyan?
- You're right"

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,999
He's ready too
- Grandpa...

8
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,168
grandma has sent for you

9
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,671
Please excuse me.
I'll be back soon

10
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,515
Isn't it nice...?
First class

11
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,428
"Before you fix a date, decide on
the amount of the mehr (compensation)"

12
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,522
"Wife, that can be decided
even during the wedding"

13
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,360
You're worried for no reason.
- Things like this...

14
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:29,038
can lead to complications.
- All right. I'll see

15
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,045
So what have you been
telling my brother?

16
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:42,648
"Nawab saheb, what is the matter?
- My wife says..."

17
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,851
it would be good if we decided on
the amount of the mehr right now

18
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,993
"Certainly, why not?
Whatever the priest says"

19
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:57,064
"Very well. You can decide on 101,000
as the mehr"

20
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,394
I agree.
- Very well then

21
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,066
"Congratulations, sir"

22
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,073
Congratulations

23
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,674
Please come

24
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,413
"Welcome, Liyaqat"

25
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,079
"May you be happy, son"

26
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,085
Someone sweeten his tongue!

27
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,757
"Congratulations, son"

28
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,100
"Congratulations, Naseem"

29
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,106
"Thank you, thank you"

30
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,109
"Congratulations, sister-in-law"

31
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,108
"Kamla, the wedding date of
my daughter has been decided"

32
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:48,112
"Why don't you think about yourself?
- I have, sister-in-law"

33
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,719
"I swear, a dashing prince
will come along..."

34
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,791
and take me away as his bride!

35
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:04,463
Praise be to Lord Rama...

36
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,963
"Laxmi, the telephone"

37
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,159
Can't you see I'm busy?

38
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,962
Anjali dear... will you see
whose call it is?

39
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,839
"But, mother!
I have only two hands!"

40
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,177
"Aditya, pick up the phone.
- But I'm getting ready"

41
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,615
Neelima! See whose call it is!

42
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,175
"I can't see anything, sister-in-law!"

43
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,520
Where are you going?
Stay here!

44
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,853
God! I'm the one who's got
to do everything in this house!

45
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,993
Hello. Who...?

46
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,459
"Grandpa, call for you"

47
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,398
The Pandit and the Nawab
are such thick friends...

48
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,871
they once went into the farm
to steal sugar-cane...

49
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,206
they were caught when the
Pandit's plait came into sight

50
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,613
The Pandit fled and the Nawab
was beaten up with sticks

51
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:37,655
Nawab! It's ages since
I heard your voice...

52
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,021
you didn't even send word
or call in all these days

53
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,234
"Forgive the misdeamonour,
my friend"

54
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,468
But I'm going to tell you something
today that will...

55
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,228
"One minute, one minute"

56
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,564
"You have fixed Naseem's wedding,
isn't it?"

57
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,573
Hey! How did you get to know?

58
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,572
"Your voice revealed
it all, my friend"

59
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:59,648
And who else would know?
She's my daughter too

60
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,417
"Give the telephone to her.
- Sure, but listen to me"

61
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,253
This marriage is a hurried affair.
The wedding's taking place in a week

62
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,590
But all of you are going
to be here tomorrow. That's it

63
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,262
Tomorrow?
- Why?

64
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,260
Are you going to make excuses
even for your daughter's wedding?

65
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,930
"Here, talk to her"

66
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,500
"Salutations, Uncle"

67
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,439
"Congratulations, my child!
Heartiest congratulations"

68
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,011
Tell your father that we're all
coming to Lucknow immediately

69
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,806
"And one moment, dear.
Talk to my wife"

70
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,285
"Naseem, my child!
So you've grown up so much?"

71
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,880
"Many congratulations, dear"

72
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,281
"Thank you, aunt.
How are you?"

73
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,287
I'm going to be angry
if you don't attend my wedding

74
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,654
No anger at all

75
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,965
Just you wait and see how I'm going
to dress you up as a bride

76
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,299
Hello. Anjali here

77
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,471
Now tell me something. Which moron
has fallen for you...?

78
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,772
"Even if he's a moron, he's far more
handsome than brother Aditya"

79
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,115
Give that to me!

80
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,323
Nice to know that another
man's going to hang in marriage!

81
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,554
What happened to you...?
Where are you going?

82
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,667
"Where am I going? I'm right here.
- No, not you"

83
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,663
Could you give the phone to aunt?
Mom wants to have a word with her

84
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,672
One minute

85
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,936
Why're you laughing?

86
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,342
You can't be thrown out at any cost!
- Why? What have I done now?

87
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,141
What do you wear with a shirt?
- Trousers

88
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,149
Where are yours?

89
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,150
"What's happening there?
- Nothing, just a bit of fun"

90
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,759
"Do come soon. With God's grace,
the wedding will take place in style"

91
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,358
Do bring Arjun along too.
It's years since I saw him

92
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,170
Of course. I will certainly
bring Arjun along this time

93
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,633
God bless you

94
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,036
So you're taking Arjun along too?
- Absolutely

95
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,371
It would be nice to see Arjun
around at home too

96
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,050
May I ask where the your pampered son
was and is right now?

97
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,785
He wasn't at home even last night.
- Well...

98
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,752
"Of course, he came home.
I fed him the food..."

99
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,392
"he ate so much!
I mean, he ate so little..."

100
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,824
It's a favour that you don't forget
your own meal every night

101
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,271
"Does anyone else have anything to say?
- Father, I..."

102
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,203
"No, not a word from you.
The two of you..."

103
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,070
are the typical brother-in-law
and sister-in-law from the movies

104
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,671
Let me tell you something

105
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,078
All this pampering from you
is going to spoil him even more

106
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,413
He loafs around all day

107
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,437
Hey fatso!

108
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,450
"Fatso, open the door!
Has Hitler gone to bed?"

109
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,609
I won't. Grandpa has asked me not to

110
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,885
"Open up, please!"

111
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,456
All right. But promise
not to call me fatso again

112
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,783
And you won't pull my shorts
in everyone's presence

113
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,120
"All right, I promise.
Now open the door"

114
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,458
Not like that. Make a request.
I'll consider it

115
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,833
"Monty dear... will you be kind enough
to open the door, please?"

116
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,163
That's the way!

117
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,072
"All right, son.
You have the upper hand today"

118
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,140
Fatso!
- Grandpa!

119
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,749
"Hi, Uncle"

120
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,828
"What's happening here?
This is no time for studies, is it?"

121
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,230
"I'm going to bed, okay?"

122
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,175
So you're back?
At last you thought of us!

123
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,507
"It's the cursed memory problem,
sister-in-law"

124
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,842
I was delayed finding the house

125
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,512
"Really? Arjun, you're
such a smooth talker"

126
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,515
I'm fed up shielding you
from your father

127
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,861
Why else have I brought you home
as my sister-in-law?

128
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,197
"So that you cover up for me and I...
- Enough, enough"

129
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,872
Why're you still awake?
Isn't brother Akash at home?

130
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,076
"No, he's out on official work"

131
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,539
Official work...?
On a Sunday?

132
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,140
"That too, in the middle of the night?
- So?"

133
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,884
Sister-in-law...
there sure is something fishy!

134
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,550
You mean Akash's upto something...?

135
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,962
He's so shy even with me!
What would he do outside the house?

136
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,558
I see. So that's what you think
about my brother?

137
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,368
All right. Let him come.
I'll tell him everything

138
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,236
"There's no point talking
to him, Neelima"

139
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,238
We must find a female monkey for him

140
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,573
Aren't the two of you enough?
- What? You call us monkeys?

141
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,974
What else?
- Wait there!

142
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,588
I remember...

143
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,322
how I shed tears quietly

144
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,687
Uncle!

145
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,926
Uncle...

146
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,598
"stop it, please"

147
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,047
"Know what? If you sing like that,
we'll only have to shed tears"

148
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,614
"Feelings, emotions...
the strong point of music"

149
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,955
"Once you hit the notes,
you strike at the hearts!"

150
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,951
"Tears flow from the eyes,
love blossoms!"

151
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,956
Looks like you haven't struck at
anyone's heart with your notes

152
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,630
"There were thousands of them,
damn it!"

153
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,868
But I'm the one who
had a weak heart

154
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,338
Liquor...?
- Liquor? What liquor?

155
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,637
Who drinks here?
- What's this?

156
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,984
That's a medicine to give hope
and melody to my music

157
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,651
Give that bottle to me!
- Uncle...

158
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,981
I can only give you the medicines.
Not the liquor

159
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,320
Hasn't the doctor forbidden you?
- What is it with the doctor?

160
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,463
He has a certificate
to deny people

161
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,657
"In any case, I'm very upset"

162
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,935
No liquor for ten days
from tomorrow

163
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,264
No liquor? What for?

164
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,906
We've got to go to Lucknow to attend
Usman's daughter's wedding

165
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,341
You mean I'm going to be all alone
for ten days from tomorrow?

166
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:17,350
"Stop dreaming, laddie!
You're going to Lucknow with us"

167
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,488
"No, Uncle. I'm not going.
This is my time for fun"

168
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,357
"Have all the fun you want to, my son"

169
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,691
But come back home on time
every night

170
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,202
I could spend my life
without any medicines

171
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,503
"But it's difficult to spend even a day
without seeing you, my son"

172
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,701
Uncle!

173
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,444
Go on now. Go

174
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,389
"Sister-in-law, you're thinking
about Arjun, aren't you?"

175
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,059
Yes.
- Just don't worry about him

176
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,388
I've had a word with Suman.
She'll carry food for him every day

177
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,394
I even gave Arjun 2000 rupees.
- What?

178
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,070
"Why? Is that less?
- Neelima, I gave him 3000 rupees too!"

179
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,073
What 3000 rupees are you
talking about?

180
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:15,404
"Aditya, I didn't even know that
Neelima gave him 2000 rupees"

181
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,409
And I gave Arjun 3000 rupees too!
- So he fooled you again?

182
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,744
"Where has he fooled me?
He's my brother-in-law, after all"

183
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:27,558
I'm talking about myself!
He took 4000 rupees from me!

184
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,989
Kids...

185
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,564
this is for the small kids
and this is for the grown up ones

186
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,429
"It would have been fun to have
Arjun with us, isn't it?"

187
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,172
But he's going to have fun even here.
I gave him 5000 rupees

188
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,632
What?

189
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:49,779
The train from Mumbai to Lucknow is
leaving from platform number 2

190
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,516
Arjun's here!

191
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,779
Get in!

192
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,218
I knew you'd come

193
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,127
It isn't easy to stay all alone
without anyone

194
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,127
You're getting it all wrong

195
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,792
You perhaps think I'm going
to the wedding with you

196
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,128
"Not at all, sorry!
You're getting it all wrong"

197
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,808
"Actually, Teddy has gone
to Lucknow with his friends"

198
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,475
And I'm going to him.
Now that I've met you folks...

199
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,477
I think I'll travel with you.
- I didn't have your ticket cancelled

200
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,548
"It's just another way of getting
his hands on some money, father"

201
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,355
"Hey! I can return
everyone's money, okay?"

202
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,514
All right. Go ahead

203
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,817
Enough. Now skip the drama

204
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,826
I knew he wouldn't ever
come on time. He's so late!

205
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,330
Have patience.
The train could be late too

206
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,175
Exactly! They're making us
wait so much!

207
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,343
We're the ones who are expecting
the guests. Why are you worried?

208
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,445
"I swear, sister-in-law! Let's decide
this once and for all"

209
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,514
Am I just your neighbour
or part of your family?

210
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,256
Never mind! I know who
you're waiting for

211
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:19,193
Here's my friend!
My dear friend!

212
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,864
"Hello, Uncle"

213
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,615
"Enough, enough"

214
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,549
"The princely states are no more,
but you haven't changed, my friend"

215
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,888
The fragrance of Lucknow!
As they used to say...

216
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,228
"The fragrance of this city,
its soft, delicate nights..."

217
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,436
"I went all over the world.
But I didn't find another Lucknow"

218
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,239
"How are you, Parveen?
- God is kind. Everything is okay"

219
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,307
But you said Arjun would
surely come with you this time

220
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,715
Where is he?
- He has come indeed

221
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,317
"But he has gone to his friends,
directly from the station"

222
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,512
He'll join us later

223
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,584
"Come to me, dear"

224
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,917
"How's Anjali? You didn't
forget her behind, did you?"

225
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,923
"This is amazing, Uncle.
How can I forget Anjali?"

226
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,926
Here she is

227
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,800
What's happening here?

228
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,601
Raj! My brother!
- Brother Usman!

229
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,934
"How have you been?
- It's the heart, you see"

230
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,512
"Blow hot, blow cold"

231
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,745
Come on inside

232
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:44,953
"I swear! So many years have passed by,
while I waited for you to blow hot"

233
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,520
You made me wait so much.
- Kamal...

234
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,224
I've told you so often to
call me Simran. Not Kamal

235
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,771
Where is my dear Naseem?

236
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,967
"Come to me, my child.
How are you?"

237
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,979
"Greetings.
- Greetings, dear"

238
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,306
Now see what gaiety your uncle
brings to your wedding

239
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,782
That's something!

240
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,747
"How are you, my child?
- I'm okay"

241
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,414
Didn't I tell you there wouldn't be
any anger? We're all here

242
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,790
"Could you step aside, Naseem"

243
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,457
Could you tell us how he is?

244
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,993
Who?
- Don't pretend!

245
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,798
Tell us about your groom.
- I'll tell you how he is

246
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,673
He's slightly fat.
- Slightly short

247
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,809
"No, he's quite tall.
- Like a lamp-post?"

248
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,675
Does he have red lips?
- Must be chewing betel-leaf!

249
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,679
"Enough. Don't tease her anymore.
- Look at them, aunty!"

250
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,186
I know. He's the most lovable one

251
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,768
"Teddy, you're a strange guy.
You came to Lucknow from Mumbai..."

252
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,564
and all our plans...
- We'll have fun here!

253
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,712
The name is Teddy
and I make merry

254
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,776
Find in Lucknow a lady.
Life will become steady

255
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,711
"Are there any good-looking girls
here in Lucknow, Teddy?"

256
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,849
I haven't seen a single
beautiful girl since I've arrived

257
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,815
"You ought to possess
the eye, my friend!"

258
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,857
"Yes. You ought to
possess the eye, sir"

259
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,462
"And in just five rupees, you'll
get to see the whole of Lucknow"

260
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,057
And what if we don't?
- You still keep your eye...

261
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,863
and I get to keep the five rupees.
Take a look

262
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,060
"Okay, okay"

263
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,874
Give that to me

264
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:52,178
"That's lmam Bagh. It was build
in 1784, by Akak-Ud-Daulah"

265
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,575
There's something special about
its strong structure

266
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,415
And that's the famous maze palace

267
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,893
It has more than a hundred doors.
Isn't it beautiful?

268
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,430
Once you're lost in it...

269
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,092
it's impossible to get out

270
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,698
"So you've seen Lucknow, haven't you?
Let me have the five rupees"

271
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,110
Here I go!

272
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,583
Pay him the money!

273
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,111
Here you are

274
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,119
Can I help you?

275
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,122
This gentleman has been trying
to cross the lane for a long time

276
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,291
It appears that you are
not from this city

277
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,453
"No, I'm not.
I've come from Mumbai"

278
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,723
Know what? Give me those bags

279
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,626
"After you've helped him across,
you can collect your bags"

280
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,743
"If you really want to help, why don't
you help him cross the road?"

281
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,706
You're a strange girl!
I want to help you...

282
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,939
and you're asking me
funny questions

283
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,146
I was told that the people of Lucknow
are very cultured

284
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,285
Don't you start
bad-mouthing Lucknow!

285
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,152
You haven't landed from the skies
either. You're only from Mumbai

286
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,255
I don't need your help

287
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,158
Don't hurt the ego
of someone from Mumbai!

288
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,455
What are you going to do?
What...?

289
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,333
But...
- Keep fighting

290
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,164
I'll be on my way

291
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,772
"By the way, thanks
for holding my hand!"

292
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,770
So you can see...?

293
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,573
The Lucknowi gentleman!

294
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,977
Not his mistake either

295
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,985
Who wouldn't want you to
hold his hand?

296
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,522
Can't help it.
This is how I've always been

297
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,534
"Pandit, this hookah
isn't meant for you"

298
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,546
"It's ages since you left Lucknow.
- You're right, my friend"

299
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,210
One doesn't find these things
in Mumbai

300
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,888
"With just a cigarette, we are
transported to the heavens"

301
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,882
"Absolutely right, brother!"

302
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,220
"I mean, that's what I've heard.
I don't smoke..."

303
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,042
"What do you think, my child?
I won't be able to recognise you?"

304
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,848
It's Khushboo

305
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,254
I'm very angry with you.
- Why?

306
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,582
It's so long since I arrived
and I get to see you only now

307
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,485
That's a grave injustice with me!

308
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,686
I had gone to get
a welcome gift for you

309
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,597
And you say you're angry with me?

310
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,928
"Where are the others?
- They're waiting for you, dear"

311
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,670
I'll go and see them.
Bye

312
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,144
Aunt...
- Where have you been?

313
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,947
You've arrived and that takes
care of all the problems

314
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,279
"Oh yes, there won't be any problems"

315
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,081
I've told Akash to get me the whole
lot of Shahnaz Husain's products

316
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:26,897
"Yes, I've got everything for you.
Here's your face-pack... take it"

317
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,532
The moisturiser. Everything

318
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,099
"Brother, what are you doing here
among the womenfolk?"

319
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,569
I've also been wondering
what I'm doing here

320
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,309
"Well, Naseem is getting married now"

321
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,647
It's time you got married too

322
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:49,648
Allah! My marriage's not happening.
Only because of Neelima

323
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,046
"Else, you were the one
I wanted to marry"

324
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,656
Shut up!
You talk any nonsense!

325
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,124
Hey! Where's your ear-ring?

326
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,992
Must've fallen somewhere.
- She can't take care of anything!

327
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,324
Go and find it

328
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,135
Why're you scolding her?

329
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,338
"Not to worry, Khushboo.
I'll get you new ear-rings"

330
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,672
I'm so hungry!
- So what would you like to eat?

331
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:17,345
Anything you have cooked.
- Really? Let's go then

332
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,751
What...?

333
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,954
I've got some kebabs for you

334
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,856
I've been told not to eat.
I can't

335
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,361
Liar! I know how you love kebabs.
Here you are

336
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,169
But I love only kebabs...

337
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:49,038
"What did you say?
Have one, please"

338
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,041
All right

339
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,381
What's happening here?

340
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,050
"So you're enjoying
the kebabs, I see"

341
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:04,186
Good for you. But there could be
an increase in the cholesterol

342
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,732
"But when someone feeds you with
so much of love, Raj Uncle..."

343
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,068
Thanks for coming to my rescue!
She was really stuffing me!

344
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,409
The pot calling the kettle black?

345
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,909
"Uncle, I can help you
if you wish"

346
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,806
"Now don't start that, please!"

347
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,418
"Tell me something, Uncle"

348
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,086
Who helps you in Mumbai
when you do things on the sly?

349
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,086
"I have my tiger, my prince!
Arjun!"

350
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,018
But where is he?
- He's a tiger...

351
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,220
and you don't see
a tiger just like that!

352
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,900
He's the king of his world!
Arjun!

353
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,445
Hi... recognise me?
- You? Even here?

354
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,615
"Can't help it. Once I make up
my mind, I go for it"

355
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,450
That's how I've always been.
- What did you say?

356
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:10,850
Nothing

357
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,195
Excuse me... I can
really help you here

358
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,459
Don't you know?
This is modern art

359
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,794
So what? I'm no antique either

360
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,900
"Listen to me, Miss Modern Art!
I know a bit about art too"

361
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,809
"Whether the art is modern or traditional,
you must learn to appreciate it"

362
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,145
Look at this one. It appears to be
just a spray of colours...

363
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,647
but there are so many stories
hidden in it

364
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,819
You do say interesting things

365
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,289
Can't help it.
That's how I've always been

366
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,485
What...?
- Nothing much

367
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:58,073
Don't these paintings suggest
they're part of a love-story?

368
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,243
The love-story of a painter?
And a girl as lovely as the roses

369
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,180
Her mesmerising eyes...

370
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,849
her enchanting smile...

371
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,920
and then...

372
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,924
the curls in her long hair...

373
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,317
And...?
- And what else

374
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,062
They must've fallen in love

375
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,123
Are you really buying something
or are you just killing time?

376
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,935
I've got what I wanted anyway

377
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,936
You're taking so much of time!
You intend to buy the whole gallery?

378
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,210
And who is he?
- He...?

379
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,537
He's the new tourist guide in Lucknow.
- I see

380
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,046
Shall we...?

381
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,075
Tourist guide!

382
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:02,571
She has stolen my heart...

383
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,377
my heart

384
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,983
I swear...

385
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,146
in just a meeting...

386
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:24,924
she has given me all the ecstasy

387
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:39,669
She has stolen my heart...

388
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,003
my heart

389
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,279
I swear...

390
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,743
in just a meeting...

391
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,683
she has given me all the ecstasy

392
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,732
The first ever time...

393
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,729
her eyes expressed the love

394
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,079
Her eyes expressed her love

395
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:03,082
"I can't ever forget
her confession"

396
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,746
that shower of love...

397
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,081
my sweetheart's desires...

398
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:12,088
God Almighty...

399
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:23,102
She has stolen my heart...

400
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,776
my heart

401
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,813
Awake...

402
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,813
"awake, on a sleepy night..."

403
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:22,231
"on a sleepy night, awake..."

404
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,328
"dreaming beautiful dreams,
wide awake..."

405
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,629
those heart-beats...

406
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,238
"the tossing and turning,
that ache..."

407
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:36,206
God Almighty...

408
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,858
He has stolen my heart...

409
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,192
my heart

410
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,194
I swear...

411
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,864
in just a meeting...

412
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,540
he has given me all the ecstasy

413
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,144
I swear...

414
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,614
in just a meeting...

415
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,613
she has given me all the ecstasy

416
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,692
If I could only find a Queen...
- Of hearts?

417
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,392
"Of hearts, of course.
- Here it is"

418
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,567
"Give the telephone to Arjun, please.
This is his mother speaking"

419
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,502
"Of course, auntie"

420
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,145
"So what's happening, mother?
- What do you mean by what's happening?"

421
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,308
"I mean, hasn't the marriage
been solemnised yet?"

422
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,650
There are 4 days to go for the wedding.
And you're coming here tomorrow

423
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,187
"You get that?
- I'll be bored stiff, mother!"

424
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,189
"I don't want to listen to anything!
- Give me the telephone, auntie"

425
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,262
"I told you, I'm not interested
in the marriage!"

426
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,127
You're not getting married yourself

427
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,326
Do you have any idea how
angry father is with you?

428
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,597
Who's this?
- This is Khushboo speaking

429
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,602
"Khushboo...? Hi!
Oh yes, I'll certainly come"

430
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,605
"For a little while, okay?
- Do come here at least"

431
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,710
I'll come for a little while!

432
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,213
"Let him come here, aunt.
Leave the rest to me"

433
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,352
Listen...

434
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,291
Speak!
- Listen...

435
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,949
Speak!

436
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,120
Guess what I saw yesterday.
- What?

437
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,628
I saw a dream.
Of someone my own

438
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,368
"Guess what else I saw.
- A dream, of course!"

439
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:45,634
I saw the clouds clearing

440
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,576
"And from behind the clouds,
I could clearly see the face..."

441
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,779
of the one calling out to me

442
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,985
"Did you see "Dilwale Dulhaniya..."

443
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,660
Guess whose face it was.
- Shah Rukh's

444
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,930
Nut! It was your face.

445
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,397
Mine...? What is it with my face?

446
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,399
Magic... the magic of your looks

447
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,801
It's on my eyelids

448
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,671
One little blow from my mouth
and all your dreams will come true

449
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,013
So go ahead...
shut your eyes!

450
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:31,411
Lord! If only we could unite
and our dreams be fulfilled!

451
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,017
Where has he gone...?

452
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,019
Flown the coop!

453
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,367
Flown!

454
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,446
My son!

455
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,041
I'm delighted to see you!
Sit down

456
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,717
"Salutations, aunt.
- Bless you, son. Sit down"

457
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,521
"So you've found the time
to come here, Prince?"

458
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,325
"Forget it.
He's here after all, isn't he?"

459
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,595
He was scared he'd have a lot
of work to do at the wedding

460
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,728
"Listen, you're going
to stay here now, okay?"

461
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,731
Go to your room.
- Where? To the right or left?

462
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,735
"Right or left, anywhere you want to.
Feel at home, my boy!"

463
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,408
"Go and freshen up, son.
Dinner is about to be served"

464
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,716
You...?

465
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,612
You dare!

466
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,527
How did you get here?
- From the door

467
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,456
Have you gone mad?
- Ever since I've seen you

468
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,291
"Go away! If father sees you,
he'll kill you"

469
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,935
First tell me what you're doing
in Uncle Usman's house

470
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,799
Allah! You've taken my father
for your uncle!

471
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,735
Father...? Are you Chutki?

472
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,740
Haven't you freshened up yet?
And your room's over there

473
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,708
"Sister-in-law, do you know him?"

474
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,479
Khushboo! Haven't you
recognised Arjun?

475
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,754
"Arjun, hurry up and get ready.
Everyone's waiting for you downstairs"

476
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,838
Look how lovely this is

477
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,228
Had someone told me earlier...

478
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,234
I'd have brought some jewellery
from my friend's shop

479
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,974
We'd have got a fat discount
of at least 20 or 25 per cent

480
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,907
"Tell me something, young man"

481
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,911
What shop in Lucknow that will give
a discount to you and not to me?

482
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,910
"Uncle Usman, my friend Teddy
knows a friend who has a shop"

483
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,914
"Oh no, he's talking rubbish.
- Oh yes, plain rubbish"

484
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,249
Uncle!

485
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,262
"I think we must give Arjun a chance.
- Oh yes, we must"

486
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,600
"What...?
- No, we mustn't"

487
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,600
We have so much to buy. So what's
the harm if we save some money?

488
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,702
"Shall we go, Arjun?
- Why not?"

489
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,274
We'll be back soon

490
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,273
Thanks

491
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,723
"Sister-in-law, come on"

492
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,284
Where's the need to
call sister-in-law?

493
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,962
We must always take the opinion
of our elders in such matters

494
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,091
"I say, Arjun, I had no idea
of your hidden talent"

495
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,837
This is wonderful!
- So you're wiser now

496
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,797
Shall we...?

497
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,915
Driver...

498
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,120
"shall we go?
- Let's go, Arjun"

499
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,672
Hello... how are you?
- Very well. Sit down

500
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,808
We have a wedding in the family.
Show us something nice

501
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,941
"There's no dearth of money.
Am I right, Khushboo?"

502
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,008
What would you like to buy?
- Arjun...

503
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,013
talk to him about the discount first.
- Of course we'll have it!

504
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,153
Treat it like your own shop

505
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,719
Uncle...?

506
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,022
"Show us some necklaces
and arm-bands, please"

507
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,160
Uncle Salim...?
- Salim?

508
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,162
But I'm Yusuf Khan.
- Greetings

509
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:24,031
"Had my brother a son,
he'd surely have called me uncle"

510
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,366
Wonderful!
- Thank you

511
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:31,845
"Had my brother a son,
he'd surely have called me uncle"

512
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,377
But I haven't even a brother.
So where comes this nephew from?

513
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,052
Wonderful! Splendid!
- Thank you

514
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,051
Go and get on with your work

515
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:46,059
"Well? You're not looking
for a discount, are you?"

516
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,158
How did you get to know?

517
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:53,199
I've met so many nephews like you.
You're not getting any discount

518
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,068
"Don't ruin the show, Uncle!
It has to do with a girl"

519
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,206
Love and romance...?
- Yes

520
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,502
So you want a discount?
- Yes

521
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,405
You'll have to listen to my poetry.
- Poetry?

522
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:10,015
"If someone is in love,
why must it bother me?"

523
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,822
But who's going to pay
for the holes in my pocket?

524
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,418
"Uncle, I'll pay for the discount"

525
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,425
"But give me a discount
in their presence, please"

526
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,154
Sure?
- Promise

527
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,224
All right

528
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,428
"Nice jewellery, isn't it?
- Yes, quite good"

529
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,103
"Arjun, I hope you've talked to him
about the discount"

530
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,104
"What is all this worth?
- No tension, sister-in-law"

531
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,243
"Everything is all right.
- Will this bracelet be nice, Arjun?"

532
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,781
Anything looks good on you

533
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,786
Here's the bill.
Please make the payment over there

534
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,461
"Here's the bill, Uncle"

535
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,823
"With the discount, it comes
to 40,000 rupees, mister"

536
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,693
I'll settle the bill.
You can go ahead

537
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,467
Here you are.
Thank you very much

538
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,536
Where do you think you're going?

539
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,816
"I'm a man of my word.
Thanks, Uncle"

540
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,298
Extend your hand

541
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,494
Why?
- Extend it

542
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,102
What's this?
- The amount of the discount

543
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:43,842
"By the way, that shop belongs
to a friend of my father"

544
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,947
But this money...
- Don't try to act too smart

545
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,674
Keep the money

546
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,116
As for your attempts to
try and impress me...

547
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,514
I'm already impressed.
- What are you impressed with?

548
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,257
Your madness!

549
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,519
Will you cure the madness then?

550
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,022
Let me think... the fee's
going to be pretty expensive

551
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,265
I agree

552
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,936
Never mind. There's no need
to get very romantic

553
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,332
I must leave now.
- One moment!

554
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:15,002
Why do you always refer to yourself
in royal style and me as a commoner?

555
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,344
"I'm a Nawab's daughter, after all"

556
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,558
Uncle... a betel-leaf
of Lucknow for you

557
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:35,126
"Talk softly! If my brother overhears
you, I'll have to face the music!"

558
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,290
Give that to me
And get going.

559
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,557
Very well

560
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,136
"I swear, you are the one
who goes into hiding"

561
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,377
"Or else, I hate making you pine"

562
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:58,146
It's okay. We in Lucknow know what
those chewing a betel-leaf want to say

563
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,183
People chat for hours with
betel-leaf in their mouths

564
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,389
Go ahead and talk

565
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,923
Forget about that and tell me...
why do you keep running away from me?

566
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,604
But I don't run away!
Isn't that what you were saying?

567
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,734
Didn't I get it?

568
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,603
"There's so much
to do at the wedding..."

569
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,003
"that's what you said, right?"

570
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,206
I got it right!
But let me tell you something

571
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,213
"I can't wait anymore. Besides,
what will my folks say?"

572
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,014
What...? Next year?

573
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,426
"I swear, in a year's time, I get no
less than half a dozen proposals"

574
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,628
But I know...
you will never break my heart

575
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:48,296
"How will he break your heart anyway?
It's no cup of clay, is it?"

576
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:53,632
"It isn't made of glass, is it?
- I won't make any mistake this time"

577
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,439
I'll talk to father right now.
In any case...

578
00:46:56,713 --> 00:47:00,444
won't it be better to have
two weddings instead of one?

579
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,653
"Why aren't you applying
any henna, Khushboo"

580
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,656
I don't want any henna.
As if I'm dying to get married!

581
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,660
But I do want to get married.
So let me have some henna applied

582
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,176
Go!

583
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,684
You womenfolk are applying henna
and no one even tells me?

584
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:40,020
Shouldn't you be taking the
opinion of the expert in the family?

585
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,224
"Don't tell me, Arjun!
You know how to apply henna?"

586
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:47,260
But of course! I haven't done
a course in designing for nothing

587
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,028
"Actually, sis-in-law, everything
keeps changing with the times"

588
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:56,696
Designs keep changing too.
- Really? You're such an expert?

589
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,032
Oh yes. Every hand has
an identity of its own

590
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:04,244
"Some are lean, some are fat,
some are straight, some twisted"

591
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,240
Some that bind
and some that break

592
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,381
"One design on every palm
isn't done, am I right?"

593
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,716
Look at this palm

594
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,887
The texture of the skin

595
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,054
Look at this mound

596
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,463
"The delicate, long fingers.
Wow!"

597
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,834
Are you going to keep blabbering
or even apply the henna?

598
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:35,343
I'll apply the henna in
such fantastic style...

599
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:40,206
any girl would agree to marry me!
- I swear!

600
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,413
Make sure the bridegroom
takes the bride away!

601
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,190
Where are you going? Apply the
henna on my palm first!

602
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,416
You will have to prove that
you can apply the henna now

603
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,762
Please! I've got to go.
Please!

604
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,929
You apply it then. Go on

605
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,105
"Here you are, Khushboo.
And I've been looking for you"

606
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,433
Why?
- Why...?

607
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,438
Well... just like that

608
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:13,510
Nut! Tell me that you were missing me

609
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,385
"Yes, I remember.
Everyone's attending a dinner"

610
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,154
So I wondered whether you and I
could go to the zoo

611
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,457
Allah! Couldn't he
suggest a romantic dinner!

612
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,853
Did you say something?
- No

613
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,122
Let's go then.
- Let's go

614
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,062
Here's your juice

615
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,602
"Not a very interesting
place, is it?"

616
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,477
Don't try to pretend! And there's
no need to look helter-skelter!

617
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,477
Pretend...? I'm the poor sucker!

618
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,818
You're always surrounded
by people at home

619
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,152
How was I to know it was
so difficult to take you out?

620
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,118
So why did you bring me out?
- To show you the Lucknow zoo

621
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,292
"When you talk such nonsense,
you look very cute"

622
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,319
Know what?

623
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,161
I've begun to like all this now

624
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:08,337
"The atmosphere, the folks here
and the rituals of marriage"

625
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,001
"All this fun and revelry...
- What do you mean "now"?"

626
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,166
How did you feel earlier?

627
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,108
I was only wandering around till now

628
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,342
I always thought I was
in search of someone

629
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,450
That there was a dream
I was chasing

630
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,485
And now I think...

631
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,355
"that dream, that face..."

632
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,426
I can see it all very clearly

633
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,868
Allah! So very romantic!
Say something more then

634
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,233
"All right, but I don't know whether
you will be able to understand it"

635
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,276
What? What were you saying?

636
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,319
"No, some other time.
- Now! Tell me"

637
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,381
Hi Khushboo!
What are you doing here?

638
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,626
So you've got here too!
- Oh yes

639
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,633
You always make an entry at the
wrong time and the wrong place

640
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,237
Don't even think of taking up
acting as a career

641
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,533
Was it an interesting scene...?
- What else

642
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,638
"Arjun's quite handsome, I must say"

643
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:32,250
"Yes, he is. Ever since I have met him,
I'm experiencing a strange kind of joy"

644
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,215
You've fallen in love!
- Maybe

645
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,588
So what are you waiting for?
Tell him

646
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,922
We're the proud citizens of Lucknow.
He'll have to say it first

647
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,461
"Watch out. Don't miss the bus,
waiting for each other to say it"

648
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,543
The name of this game is
the winner keeps it all...

649
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,942
and the loser is the monkey

650
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,118
"Whichever name appears in this chit,
will come here..."

651
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:12,622
pick up the handkerchief in the ring
and head for his or her team

652
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,288
The condition is... you must
not let the opponent touch you

653
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,298
"If you are touched, you lose"

654
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,969
These chits contain the names
of everyone present

655
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,476
Their names will be called out
one at a time by Rhea and Monty

656
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,643
And these chits contain
the penalty for the loser...

657
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,875
which will be announced
by Aunt Laxmi

658
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,156
I'm not going to lose!

659
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,809
Watch out... I'm not losing!

660
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,350
Your punishment is...

661
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:28,295
you will say something poetic
in praise of your wife

662
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,272
I'm trapped

663
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,208
"Say it, brother"

664
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,043
"Here's my opportunity, I guess"

665
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,725
"Wife, do I have the permission?"

666
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:58,057
"In your name, I have
trapped the butterfly"

667
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,061
"Every hue of the world,
I have clenched in my fist"

668
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,441
Wow! Wonderful!

669
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,074
Thank you

670
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,434
"You're going to lose, watch out!
- My foot! You're going to lose"

671
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,336
Watch out! Careful!

672
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,777
"Careful, Arjun...
Our team has pinned its hopes on you"

673
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,552
The winner will herself announce
the loser's punishment

674
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,124
Punish him severely!

675
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:14,809
The punishment is: Suppose the one
you love the most were present here...

676
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,543
what would you say to her?

677
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:24,742
All right

678
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:28,816
In a gathering
of the stars...

679
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:34,687
"there's this fairy,
this nymph"

680
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,158
She means the life to me

681
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,638
She's dearer than life to me

682
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,717
"What is it...?
- Listen, Khushboo"

683
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,988
Your mother was saying we've
got to meet the chef

684
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,521
Let me take you there.
- Brother Riaz has left already

685
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,854
Flowers! We've got to
visit the florist too

686
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,189
There's so much of decoration
to be done. Shall we go?

687
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,867
"If you must take me out, Arjun,
find a better excuse"

688
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,873
So you think I'm making excuses?
- What else?

689
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,609
Honesty isn't appreciated anymore!
I want to help out...

690
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:28,611
and you say I'm making excuses?
- What if I want to go out with you?

691
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,812
All right. But only
for half an hour

692
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,215
You're telling me!

693
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,550
I'll go and get ready

694
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,223
I'll wait downstairs.
Come soon

695
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,964
What's cooking?

696
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:52,633
So fatso... you'll say
want to go with us?

697
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,902
You will also say that you
want to have an ice-cream?

698
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,241
Won't you let us go on our own?

699
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,817
All right. Get ready quickly

700
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,247
"Hold on! Uncle's acting
smart with us, Rhea"

701
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,254
"When we go to dress,
he'll simply disappear"

702
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,918
"Fatso! I've got to dress up too.
You want an ice-cream, right?"

703
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,061
So hurry up! C'mon!

704
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,067
"Uncle, no cheating!"

705
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,602
"Trust your uncle, I say.
- All right"

706
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,536
Let's scram!

707
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,347
"It's your turn now.
- I've never bowled before, Arjun"

708
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,620
"What's the big deal?
Come, I'll teach you"

709
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,288
Hold it... here

710
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,629
Aim

711
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,165
No problem

712
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,043
Here you are

713
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,088
"She learnt that in no time.
Well, Rakesh?"

714
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,324
You got a point there.
- What are you doing here?

715
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,667
Selling peanuts

716
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,069
And this is Vivek.
Khushboo is Uncle Usman's daughter

717
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:40,241
"So you are Teddy?
- I am, but he's the one who's crooked"

718
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,017
Where have you been all these days?
- Shut up

719
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,789
Let him be. Arjun mustn't
have liked our treat

720
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,147
Treat? When did you give me a treat?

721
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,791
What he means is hospitality.
- I see

722
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,562
"Actually, I never had
that dish either"

723
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,158
Did you find that girl?

724
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,759
"Tell us, come on"

725
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,966
Which girl?
- He's raving

726
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,834
"There sure was a girl. When he first
saw her, his world had crashed..."

727
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:14,013
"time had stopped still, and much more.
- Love at first sight"

728
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,181
"Give me a break!
Come on, we're getting late"

729
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,377
Not at all. I'm not in a hurry

730
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,519
What else did he say about that girl?
- Well... nothing

731
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:23,620
Now come on

732
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,053
Won't you invite your friends
for the wedding?

733
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,091
You...? You are getting married?

734
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,832
Khushboo's sister is getting married

735
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,424
Do come

736
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,203
Bloody awesome

737
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,915
Now how am I to handle the kids?

738
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,088
"Where have you been, guys?
I looked for you everywhere"

739
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,766
"Good you didn't come. We don't even
get ice-cream here. Right, Khushboo?"

740
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,205
Try that googly on someone else

741
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:17,104
"Aunt Khushboo,
never fall for his words"

742
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,438
"One moment he makes promises,
the next moment he's gone"

743
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,748
"Here, eat it"

744
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,313
"Fatso, if you hog on ice-cream,
you will grow like an elephant"

745
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:26,781
Hi grandpa!

746
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,261
Great.
- Some more? Take a little more

747
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,258
"Honestly, I'm eating delicious food
after years"

748
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:46,071
"Thank you, brother. From what you say,
Laxmi doesn't seem to cook too well"

749
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,468
"Parveen, variety is
the spice of life"

750
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,481
"But we don't have any variety here,
and you sure make food spicy"

751
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,482
"Uncle, it's only a maxim.
- You are right"

752
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:01,155
So you know it's a maxim?

753
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,949
"What else? Do you take me
for a fool, papa?"

754
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,693
"So, you know?
- Absolutely"

755
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,590
"Then rant some. I mean, say some"

756
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:16,097
A bad workman blames his tools.
- Amazing

757
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,907
"Easy, there's one more.
- One more, folks"

758
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,500
"lllgotten, illspent"

759
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,174
That's really illspent.
You asked for it

760
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:29,508
It goes like this...
Money is the root cause of all evil

761
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:33,186
"It's on the same lines, though"

762
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:37,823
Bad times. My mistake.
- It happens

763
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,325
Enough

764
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,023
Did I see it coming?
- What happened?

765
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,937
The singer has a sore throat.
He won't be able to sing tomorrow

766
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,169
I'll lose face

767
01:01:55,578 --> 01:02:00,072
"What's the problem, uncle Usman?
Fie on me if I can't be of any help"

768
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,245
I'll sing.
- You will?

769
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:06,046
"Why not? I'm no less.
Right, sister-in-law?"

770
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,024
Absolutely.
But if I say something...

771
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,555
my father-in-law will say that I am
in cahoots with my brother-in-law

772
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,556
But one thing is for sure;
Arjun sings really well

773
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,891
In the bathroom

774
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:24,167
"Okay, for the sake of my friend's
honour, I'll agree with you, Anjali"

775
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,235
God willing. So be it!
- So be it

776
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,590
Staying away from her...

777
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,659
my heart realised...

778
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,925
Iove is life

779
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,762
Life is love

780
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,336
Only the beloved...

781
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,006
can cure the ailing heart

782
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,673
love is life

783
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,283
Life is love

784
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,882
Only the beloved...

785
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,689
can cure the ailing heart

786
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:32,834
"The doors of Heaven
lead to Love, everyone knows"

787
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,364
Only the beloved...

788
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,969
can cure the ailing heart

789
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:21,983
"May not this season of love
ever change, my love"

790
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,916
"May not this heart
fall in Time's vicious trap"

791
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,887
Those lovely downcast eyes...

792
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,421
ignorant of all miseries

793
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,128
"Even if the world changes
for the worse..."

794
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,557
"let the heartbeats
blossom forever"

795
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:47,402
"Looking at the moon
is like having a glimpse of you"

796
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:52,771
"Only the beloved can cure
an ailing heart"

797
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:34,119
"At your behest,
I shall even forsake Godliness"

798
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:39,227
"For, I have vowed
never to forsake this friendship"

799
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,195
"May our friendship
live forever"

800
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,522
"May our hearts always be
filled with love"

801
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:49,828
"As long as I breathe, may this lamp
of friendship remain lit"

802
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,278
Friendship is victory...

803
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,637
everything else is a loss

804
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:04,852
"Only a beloved can cure
an ailing heart"

805
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,657
"Love is the sweet fragrance
of honour"

806
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,886
"Love is the magic
of the beloved"

807
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,290
Love is Allah's invaluable gift

808
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,567
Love is a living reality

809
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,564
"The days of Love
are unmatched"

810
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,872
"The nights of Love
are unique"

811
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,300
Love rules over everyone

812
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,542
Love is incomparable

813
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,871
"Love instills...
- Loyalty"

814
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:37,549
"One who worships Love...
- He is God"

815
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,684
Love is the heartbeat

816
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,048
"Love is the music
of the breaths"

817
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,325
"Love is the promise
of the beloved"

818
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,651
"Love is a season
of desires"

819
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,896
"Love is the collyrium
in the eyes"

820
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,065
"Love is the pink
on the lips"

821
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,564
"Fall in love, and you will know...
- That the world's a waste without it"

822
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,701
Love knows no customs

823
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,100
Love knows no promises

824
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,502
Love understands only love

825
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,836
Love acknowledges only love

826
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,707
"Love is the promise
of faithfulness"

827
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,910
Love is expression

828
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:20,922
"Only the beloved
can cure an ailing heart"

829
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,082
"Tonight, when he held my hand..."

830
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,757
I almost choked

831
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,757
Is it love?

832
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:57,655
Why am I asking myself?

833
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:02,636
Maybe because
he hasn't told me yet...

834
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,963
that he loves me

835
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:07,401
What are you writing?

836
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,470
But what is it?

837
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,973
Some feelings

838
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:16,983
Memories of someone

839
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,613
"Arjun, don't you think..."

840
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:26,326
"one must capture every sweet moment,
every sweet memory?"

841
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,489
I want to capture them for good

842
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,663
You're crazy.
- I've always been like that

843
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:35,993
What?

844
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:38,395
Just kidding

845
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:01,553
"Welcome, welcome"
