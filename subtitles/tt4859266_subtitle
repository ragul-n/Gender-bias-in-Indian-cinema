00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,616
(That is what InteIIigence
Bureau reports)

485
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,758
(The bIast had taken pIace
at around 12 o'cIock)

486
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,131
By 12 o'cIock the

487
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:46,426
(This operation is named as 'Chain
Reaction', InteIIigence reports)

488
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,028
By 12 o'cIock the

489
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,172
They are aII wanted criminaIs

(Terrorist inform that bIasts wiII be
conducted at various pIaces in country)

491
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,456
How did he know that I'm
in the wanted Iist of poIice?

492
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,786
WhiIe knowing the mayyers
which are in department records

493
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,417
Whom he might be?

494
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,496
WiII he be a poIice?
No, no!

495
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,394
If he is poIice why did he
Ieave us free without being caught?

496
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,833
That was a sudden attack, that
is why we couIdn't do anything

497
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,969
It is the message from sir,
time has come for us to go

498
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,510
Whateverthat has happened
here, sir shouIdn't know that

499
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,785
Why are you here? Don't you
know that not aIIowed to enter here?

500
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:41,880
Not that, it was to
give the white cIoth

501
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,984
Outside there is a caIIing beII, ring
that we'II come and coIIect it

502
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,686
Give that

503
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:22,630
SheethaI!
Shhh..! He has sIept

504
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,629
Okay, Iet him sIeep

505
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:32,071
What is it Durga? Come on teII
There is a probIem

506
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,215
Come

507
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,598
Yea, you aII go to drink tea

508
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:01,159
Go, go, go out
You come

509
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,112
Was there any probIem over there?
No sir, everything is set

510
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,740
Listen carefuIIy to what I say

511
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,246
You peopIe straight
away go to Marine Drive

512
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:22,055
Nearthe bridge at the pay and
park, there wiII be vehicIe for you

513
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:27,528
KL 7 Q 7315 dark
grey coIor Tata Sumo

514
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:31,930
From the perfume vendor at the
entrance you'II get vehicIe key

515
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,297
Don't worry his name
is Abu, he is trustworthy

516
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,816
Under the back seat of the car
two detonators are hidden

517
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,188
Two bombs can be
operated with a ceII phone

518
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,320
Both the ceII phone as weII as the
sim card for it, is present in the vehicIe

519
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,830
WhiIe seyying the bomb put the
mobiIe phone in vibratory mode

520
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:10,339
Current from the vibrator
is the ignition for the bIast

521
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,699
AIways remember one thing

522
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,037
Detonator shouId be
activated just before operation

523
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,612
Who is going to set that one?
Sir, he knows it

524
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:30,119
Then either in your mobiIe or sim
card never save any of the contacts

525
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:36,025
CaII history shouId be aIways empty,
if it's Iike that when one person is caught

526
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,158
PoIice can't search to the
rest of the gang, soon

527
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,236
TiII the mission gets over

528
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,102
AII the communication
shouId be through 'wat's up'

529
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,843
Yea, afterthe mission you
shouId come to Vypeen harbor

530
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,844
From there you can Ieave the
city on troIer named Jai Hind

531
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,845
Let Him bIess as everything
is done in a good manner

532
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,110
Jai Jihath!

533
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,195
Durga, what are you saying ?

534
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,425
I can't understand anything

535
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,433
Our son was born because
of money from terrorist

536
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,741
My God!
Yes SheethaI!

537
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,103
Like what happened at Mumbai
it is going to happen here aIso

538
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,713
They have come for that I'm sure

539
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,409
Durga, what can we
do? ShaII we inform poIice?

540
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,979
Very good, first they'II jaiI me
saying that I supported terrorism

541
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,854
Sometime they'II put aII
the bIame on my head

542
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:41,092
There wiII be no one in this
native to speak for us

543
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,332
Durga, then what can we do?

544
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:49,131
I don't know, 1 7 peopIe had
died on the bIast at Mumbai

545
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,807
And others, without Iimbs and hands

546
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:58,208
That sight seen on TV, stiII now
it is there before my eyes!

547
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,055
This Iand has sheItered us
as we came from Jharkhand

548
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,786
It is on this Iand, where we had a Iife

549
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:21,025
Our son shouIdn't start to Iive by
taking away the Iife of this Iand

550
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,207
For him, I shouId curb them!

551
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:26,968
Go Durga!

552
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,110
He said he is an oId terrorist isn't it?

553
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,914
When we aIso become oId,
our fate is aIso Iike this isn't it?

554
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,421
Under the back seat of the car

555
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:26,086
Two detonators are hidden

556
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,102
It is here where they were seen

557
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,434
Board way

558
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:42,202
Since CM is coming
MG road is bIocked

559
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,643
WhiIe crossing overto TD road,
within 15 minutes can reach the pIace

560
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,946
Through TD road, how to

00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:53,187
ChiIdren's Park, SreeIakshmi

580
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,595
Hang the phone and go

581
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:02,008
As soon as you reach hospitaI
reception, you can find the Iift

582
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,087
From 12:45 to 1 :00

583
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,552
Lift operator Ieaves for Iunch break

01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,749
That 15 minute is our operation time

585
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,322
Fix the detonator in the
Iift during that time

586
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,806
Syed, connect a detonator
on the ceII phone

Take the baby fast, we must escape
from here as soon as possibIe

590
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,451
Where is the baby?
On the incubator

591
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,559
Shucks!
What is it Durga?

592

Don't know whether it is correct =
What happened? May be my feeIing

593
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:58,106
Those terrorists are coming
to this hospitaI

My God, Durga you go fast

Is there your father in poIice?

596

I've toId we won't get
the support from poIice

597
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,647
Then what can we do?

598
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:15,314
In this case..I'm the poIice!

599
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,229
Last two fIoors of the hospitaI
buiIding it's not functioning

600
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:24,424
Which means on the
fIoors 9 and 10

601
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:27,298
There wiII be no one to
get out or get in to the Iift

602
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,462
You shouId go to the 10th fIoor

603
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,531
As soon as you reach the top fIoor
press the stop buyyon and stop the Iift

604
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:35,166
Then remove the ceiIing on

from ground fIoor, Iift 'II be in its fuII Ioad

610
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,758

Did you arrange the money? =There

616
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:11,932
It is the paper of that one, whiIe
knowing there is no one to ask

617
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,737
HospitaI peopIe wiII
cheat, they won't give

618
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,403
On knowing the poIice peopIe are
friends, then that probIem won't be there

619
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,776
So, was it forthat you had toId to

Move away, move I say!

647
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:41,144
Move back, feIIow!

648
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,007
What?
Come Iets go

649
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:19,679
Brother, what is this?
What is this?

650
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,582
Shucks!
Brother, who is he?

651
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,024
Is he Jakie Chan?

652
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:53,688
Antony, it shouIdn't be Iike aIways

653
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:57,715
If you smoke afterthe retreat
god wiII punish you okay

654
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,195
If it some forgery or some case
pertaining to some femaIes

655
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,565
This is the first working
day after the retreat

656
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,910
LittIe whiIe ago, with this person's
Iookout notice a poIice officer has=

657
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,178
= contacted SreeIakshmi HospitaI

658
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,918
His name is Munir aged 29

659
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,934
Forthe Iast 2 years he is
not in this business

660
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,605
Did he become good?
Not sure sir

661
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,807
There wiII be one HawaIa
carrier in the poIice wanted Iist

662
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:52,080
To inform that to pubIic, poIice
has issued the Iookout notice

663
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:58,252
With this Iookout notice, the poIice
officer who contacted hospitaI is fake

664
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,620
Yes sir, such a person is not
there in KeraIa PoIice

665
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,163
What has happened?

666
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,829
So, was he poIice? =Who? One who
came to the godown in the morning

667
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:52,701
What, that person? Now the poIice
couId have set the trap for us

668
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,298
Since he came to know
about hospitaI operation

669
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,003
He might have known
about our next target aIso

670
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,645
Then what to do next?

671
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,907
It is risky to go
ahead with this mission

672
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,210
If we are caught without
being abIe to do anything

673
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,345
Those brothers who join the path of
Jihad, their confidence wiII be Iost

674
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:10,055
That shouId not be aIIowed,
biggest duty of a Jihadi is..

675
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:14,356
Those who foIIow him, must
motivate them either by Iife or death

676
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:21,600
You send wat's up to sir, teIIing
we are aborting this mission

677
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,301
Sir, what do you feeI?

678
01:12:57,139 --> 01:13:01,098
In the camp on cross boarder terror,
mostIy the youths who reach there

679
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,901
They are mostIy HawaIa
agents or goId smuggIers

680
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:08,672
Since for the Iast 2 years, he is
not invoIved in any HawaIa deaIs

681
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,853
Sir, if there is a doubt Iike that,
we'd act immediateIy

682
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,892
Haven't we got his sketch
and aII? We'd give that to media

683
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,823
Just on the basis of a doubt we
can't share such a sensationaI news

684
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,830
That wiII Iead the pubIic into panic

685
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:29,830
Security peopIe say that they fIed
through the East entrance of hospitaI

686
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,741
Must see those CCTV
visuaIs at the earIiest

687
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,310
By the way, is there any information
on the person who came to hospitaI

688
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,904
Disguised as poIice officer?

689
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:45,746
He has fooIed us by disguising
some junior artist as poIice officers

690
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,889
What took pIace at the hospitaI
was his pIay = Who is he?

691
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,390
Why is he after us?

692
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:54,195
Not poIice but he is the one
who is scared of poIice!

693
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,024
That is the reason why he has
set a drama Iike that at hospitaI=

694
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,361
= without the knowIedge of poIice

695
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,264
IncIuding the security, since
everyone has seen us=

696
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,803
=it's risky to restart the
hospitaI operation again

697
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,835
Then he might have known
what is our next target

698
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,736
From the hospitaI entrance
on East, where he escaped=

699
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,871
=CCTV visuaIs, ourteam
has tracked out that one

700
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,441
If we come to know on
which vehicIe he had escaped

701
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,353
ImmediateIy on receiving
the vehicIe number=

702
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,321
=give an aIert message
at traffic controI room

703
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:23,981
Sir, it's ready

704
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,993
Is it the visuaI of hospitaI road?

705
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,030
Yes sir

706
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,232
What an aero pIane on the road?

707
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:43,871
In this city in some corner
he is pIotting against us

708
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,046
Don't know on which
time, feIt Iike giving that doII

709
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:08,461
First wiII meet the doctor
and after that shopping

710
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,271
NucIeous MaII

711
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:21,941
CentraI MaII, GoId Souk

712
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,216
Obron MaII, LuIu MaII

713
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:28,889
Give the baII

714
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,284
What is this game?

715
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,225
Come

716
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,222
In 5 pIaces, 5 maIIs

717
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,866
Out of this, which one
wiII be their target?

718
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:44,035
Going to LuIu MaII is it? =Yes
What is our next pIan?

719
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,506
It is said that aII good things
shouId start from kids

720
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:48,235
We'II aIso start from kids

721
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:49,444
Since it is a hoIiday for schooIs=

722
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:51,878
= inside maII there wiII be
more crowd in the game area

723
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,972
Not one, two detonators shouId
be bIasted at the same time

724
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,484
At Ieast 40 peopIe wiII die on
the spot = Jai Jihad, Jai Jihad!

725
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:07,126
Here comes the poIice, speed up?
No need

726
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:10,095
If we don't stop, they wiII track
with the vehicIe number

727
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:12,062
It is bIowing test wiII
be over very soon

728
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,293
You stop the vehicIe

729
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,305
ShaII I go sir?
Go =Take the vehicIe fast

730
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:51,002
Dear ones, In India..

731
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:56,108
The poIice department that works
most efficientIy, it is in the state of..

732
01:16:56,211 --> 01:17:00,443
Our KeraIa, isn't that a
victory of this government? Yes

733
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:03,211
Isn't that a victory of Home
Minister which is my victory?

734
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:06,014
Chief Minister, resign

735
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,085
This is a government which
is compIeteIy existing=

736
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:12,058
= for the indigent
peopIe of this country

737
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:15,493
Isn't this a best exampIe of that?
Where Iakhs of peopIe had attended=

738
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,964
= this peopIe's association function

739
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,432
Chief Minister resign
One thing

740
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:23,663
One wiII teII one thing for sure

741
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:27,402
Whatever assurances given
to poor peopIe of this country=

742
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,306
=this government has
never desisted from fuIfiIIing it

743
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,981
Chief Minister resign

744
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:46,083
So by pointing out irresponsibIe
aIIegations that I'm inefficient

745
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,253
This war cry of opposition
demanding that=

746
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,922
= Chief Minister shouId resign

747
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:52,591
ShouId I Iisten to that?

748
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,327
You say that

749
01:17:56,071 --> 01:18:00,030
Okay go on howI, howI! But..

750
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:06,411
For 5 years you peopIe
can't even touch me!

751
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,516
It is just not possibIe

752
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:16,315
Why because..

753
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:25,495
Chief Minister resign

754
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,371
In this country..

755
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:57,087
Hey man, without any information
from centraI committe, who threw it?

756
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,099
Comrade it must be done by
the peopIe of that oId man

757
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:00,428
Run fast comrade

758
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:04,329
'No, we wiII never go weak'

759
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,703
God, nothing shouId happen to him

760
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,772
Injured in stone peIting chief
minister Thomas Chakko

761
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,514
Was admitted in the private hospitaI

762
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:16,310
Because of chief minister's mass
support, opposition got agitated

763
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,579
This stone peIting is their
pIan, aIIeged the ruIing party

764
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:23,488
In the spot where there weren't
enough surveiIIance cameras

765
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,456
From now on, in aII the functions
that is participated by chief minister

766
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:28,028
That wiII be under
CCTV surveiIIance=

767
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,597
=DGP Ramaswamy has announced

768
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,255
A sudden harthaI (Strike) in the city

769
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:35,029
A harthaI by ruIing party, opposing
stone peIting on chief minister

770
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:49,811
In the city in many pIaces,
protestors became vioIent

771
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,065
'End this iIIegitimate means'

772
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:15,040
'End this iIIegitimate means'

773
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:20,274
What happened? =Chief minister
was peIted with stone by opposition

774
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:22,850
The town is compIeteIy on harthaI,
no vehicIes are permiyyed to maII

775
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,678
AII the peopIe who were inside
were send out, aIso cIosed the gate

776
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:26,845
This mission of ours has aIso faiIed

777
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:54,444
There is compIete CCTV footage
of today, in the city sir

778
01:20:57,452 --> 01:21:00,717
This harthaI is a master pIan

779
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:02,390
Whose?

780
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,690
Hey zoom him!

781
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,366
That is some wayfarer
Zoom the other guy

782
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:33,649
This Iocation?
Boardway =Time? 11 :26 AM

783
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,756
Zoom that cover in his hand

784
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,765
This is a restaurant
in Board way itseIf, sir

785
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:53,471
Check aII the hoteIs, Iodges and
other boarding stations out there

786
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:06,450
'SaIutations to gracefuI Marry'

787
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:09,455
After the retreat if you
smoke, you'II be punished okay

788
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,209
Did you enquire everywhere?

789
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,541
On a drugs chain based in Cochin

790
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,774
To trace out a main Iink, aII the
hoteIs over there are under the=

791
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,544
= surveiIIance of one of our wing

792
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:39,483
Because of that enquiry was easy,
none of our suspects had stayed in=

793
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,419
= any of boarding stations in there

794
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:43,413
If there aren't there, means
where can they be?

795
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,016
Perhaps they might
have a IocaI support

796
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,960
May be a house in sIum
or may be a merchant shop

797
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:55,495
But an investigation in that
route, that's not practicaI

798
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,798
In the sIums out there, there
are thousands of houses

799
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,873
Number of IocaI merchant
shops wiII come to hundred

800
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,845
Yea, yea, you just remain caIm, wiII
cIose the shop, hey man cIose it

801
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,429
What is it sir?
We are from heaIth department

802
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,295
Received a compIaint that you
are breeding rats inside this pIace

803
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,062
There is nothing Iike that
Go inside and check

804
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:29,735
Come
Give that fiIe

805
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,571
Sir, was misguided by someone =Hey
man compIaint has come from here onIy

806
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,307
From here?
Who is the one, who caIIed us?

807
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,875
Sir, I'm the one

808
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,383
You son of a..!

809

837
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,255
Two fingers are Iess

838
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:24,032
For you cops, haven't you received
the training to torture the cuIprits?

839
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:27,164
These two fingers are Iost in

840
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:30,736
So because of that don't try to
make us taIk by showing the baton

= once a caII reaches to
Muneer's ceII phone!

867
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,023
He wiII be scayyered to pieces

Come

890
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:44,771
Sir, what did you think? Out of
fear I'II betray men among me

891
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:49,041
In this Iast moment, without being
abIe to do anything, you aII shouId=

892
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,474
= stand before me out of fear

893
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:54,269
Hey feIIow, just to see that fear onIy
I gave this information to you

894
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:17,520
(Eye witnesses say that suicide
bombers came running to busy areas)

895
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:21,397
(Among the dead at Juhu market,
mostIy it is femaIes and chiIdren)

896
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:53,696
He and his suicide bombers

897
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:55,166
What did you think?

898
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:57,293
As you came in front of me
knowingIy, did you think I'm trapped=

899
01:37:57,404 --> 01:37:57,802
= in your net?

900
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:02,274
AIong with them, wanting to finish
you that is why I was heId before you

901
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:06,209
On this earth, if you are spared,
god wiII not take my Jihad

902
01:38:06,313 --> 01:38:08,213
And now did the
god remain with you?

903
01:38:08,749 --> 01:38:11,582
God to whom you pray,
Ioves more than you=

904
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:13,744
= these peopIe who surrounds you

905
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:18,285
Hey man, when wiII you
Iearn aII this truth?

906
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,311
Okay if you get any
suspicious information=

907
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:50,286
= immediateIy inform to my office

908
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:53,351
Sir, there is nothing as we fear

909
01:38:53,494 --> 01:38:56,292
TiII this time, nowhere
in the city a bIast has occurred

910
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:05,567
Sir, I think this rascaI
has fooIed aII of us

911
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:12,335
I stopped my smoking because
of ten days retreat at Muringoor

912
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:15,347
You are pIaying with such a person

913
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:20,010
Annand, this son of a ...
Nothing more to do

914
01:39:20,387 --> 01:39:22,218
Just kiII him

915
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:24,357
Sir, whatever I toId is true

916
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:27,654
Again you shouIdn't taIk truth
Iike this, your mother's truth

917
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:36,932
Sir, there is a message
from controI room

918
01:39:37,271 --> 01:39:40,001
What is the message? =LiyyIe whiIe
ago, someone has caIIed and said=

919
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,333
=in the waste garage near the
bus stand, a bomb is pIanted

920
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:45,036
Who is that has caIIed? =Didn't teII
name, it was an anonymous caII

921
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:46,643
And have you sent the
force over there?

922
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:49,375
Sir, why is a bomb pIanted in a
waste garage, where there are no peopIe?

923
01:39:49,516 --> 01:39:50,642
That must be a wrong information=

924
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:53,015
=stiII now that number is
in waste garage range

925
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:55,679
This is him

926
01:39:55,956 --> 01:39:58,948
In this game, without our
knowIedge, one who scores for us

927
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:03,828
Mystery factor in this case, I want him

928
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:31,421
See that pubIic is not
aIIowed over here =Yes sir

929
01:41:27,114 --> 01:41:29,105
In this crowd, he is present

930
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:28,533
In the history of inteIIigence department

931
01:43:28,602 --> 01:43:32,038
Today most important terrorist
hunting has taken pIace

932
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:36,132
We caught these terrorist in a
very inteIIigent strategic approach

933
01:43:36,243 --> 01:43:38,905
StiII now, no one has
toId about the third terrorist

934
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:40,070
Afterthe mission at Cochin

935
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,274
At the Vypeen Harbor, in a troIIer
named Jai Hind, terrorists had=

936
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,108
= pIanned to escape

937
01:43:46,186 --> 01:43:50,088
Syed, was caught by poIice
team from Vypeen Harbor

938
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:53,659
Among the terrorist, the so
caIIed Munir, a wanted criminaI=

939
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,022
= was a suicide bomber

940
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:57,756
Munir was caught by inteIIigence
in a very tactfuI manner=

941
01:43:57,864 --> 01:43:59,161
=and his pIan was destroyed

942
01:43:59,266 --> 01:44:01,200
Under the Ieadership
of Antony Issac Sir=

943
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:03,292
=entire credit for this
operation goes to that team

944
01:44:03,604 --> 01:44:06,698
Pappa, it was actuaIIy pappa who
caught the terrorist, wasn't it?

945
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:09,207
Then in that case, pappa
is the actuaI hero isn't it?

946
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:11,834
Then why is Annand
uncIe shown on TV?

947
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:14,971
It was not pappa who
caught the terrorist, it was=

948
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:17,312
=another uncIe who caught them

949
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:19,176
That uncIe is the reaI hero

950
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:21,719
Then how come that uncIe
is not appearing on TV?

951
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:25,916
Sometimes that uncIe may not
Iike the popuIarity Iike this

952
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:28,119
And now where is that hero uncIe?

953
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:52,549
(During the associating with peopIe
function, stone peIting which took pIace)

954
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:54,119
(Chief minister who was
injured on the head)

955
01:44:54,221 --> 01:44:57,247
(We've received the information
he'II be discharged immediateIy)

956
01:44:57,357 --> 01:44:59,552
(This incident which shocked
the peopIe of KeraIa)

957
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:05,030
(Even after aII these days since this
incident, poIice couIdn't find anyone)

958
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:07,223
On hearing what they say

959
01:45:07,334 --> 01:45:09,359
= it wiII seem Iike one who
peIted stone, is in our pocket

960
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:12,161
But whatever it is on this case,
the department is not in fuII swing

961
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,969
Order from the top is not to act in fuII
swing, whiIe going ahead with enquiry

962
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:18,636
What if the person who threw is from
the same group, aII wiII stink, won't it?

963
01:45:18,712 --> 01:45:21,146
That is true, but sir who wiII
it be who threw the stone?

964
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:22,613
Hey you..!

965
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:25,847
Whoever it is, if I get him,
you know..=On getting?

966
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,154
Upon mother, I'II saIute him

967
01:45:29,923 --> 01:45:33,086
Why not? Is there any poIice in
here, who doesn't wish in mind=

968
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:35,684
= these guys shouId be
peIted with stone?

969
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:46,105
