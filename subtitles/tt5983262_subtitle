1
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,917
Failed in committing suicide also.

2
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,333
Use some energy man.

3
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,292
Hey Laxmi.

4
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:18,667
What do you think?

5
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,500
Heard the area is on high alert today.

6
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,417
Might have to call it a night?

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,583
This is Putul.

8
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,125
New entry.

9
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,000
Teach her the ropes of the business.

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,750
She's your new tenant.

11
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,708
Charge her for the bed every month.

12
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,500
A.T...

13
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,375
Start your rickshaw.

14
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,500
<i>Mustard oil,</i>

15
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,375
<i>lipstick</i>

16
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,833
<i>and painted nails.</i>

17
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,542
<i>What a combination!</i>

18
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,625
Jasmine and mustard oil.

19
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,750
I use a mixture of both oils every day.

20
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,417
You should also try it.

21
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,250
Trust me,
your scanty parts will also fill up.

22
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,542
Come with me.

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,958
Let's go home. No business tonight.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,333
This is temporary.

25
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,792
Start looking for a different house.

26
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,375
I prefer to live alone.

27
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,292
But I love company.

28
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,583
Nonetheless, I'll find a different place.

29
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,167
Thank you.

30
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,875
How much money do you have on you?

31
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,917
Two thousand five hundred rupees.

32
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,375
Two thousand five hundred rupees?
That's all?

33
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,792
Thanks a ton Mhatre sir!

34
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,208
No, I'm not in the mood.

35
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,500
Hey!

36
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,292
No smoking in the house!

37
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,708
God!

38
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,750
What the hell?

39
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:05,958
Asshole...

40
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,500
Get away you dumbfuck.

41
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,250
It's quite hot today.

42
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,667
-I have completed my time.
-Come!

43
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,750
That mad woman had exiled me for 12 years

44
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,458
near Bakulapuri, Ahmedabad.

45
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,125
It's a crime to save anybody's life here.

46
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,667
In that case, Papa, send me away.

47
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,667
Are we clear?

48
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,125
Are you done? Shall we go?

49
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:13,917
Let's go.

50
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,417
Hello Monu.

51
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,000
How are you?

52
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,875
I'm going for my first day of work here.

53
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,333
Overhyped Mumbai and its overhyped food.

54
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,667
They add potato cutlet to bread
and call it Vada Pav.

55
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,792
I'm still fond of the cutlets
from Pachus shop from Kolkata.

56
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,042
Believe me, there is nothing special here.

57
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,750
Half of the time

58
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,292
-we're stuck in a jam here.
-Listen.

59
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,500
Listen, I'll call you later.

60
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,958
At work now.

61
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:02,167
Goodnight.

62
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,417
Are you done? Give me your phone.

63
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,833
He is A.T... A.T.

64
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,917
He'll collect our money from the customers

65
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,083
and if there's a problem,
he'll follow the customer's car also.

66
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,417
This is his number.

67
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,042
And if the customer doesn't drop us back,
he can pick us up also.

68
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,750
Meaning pimp cum watchman.

69
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,792
Double role.

70
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,000
-What did you just say?
-Nothing, let it go, you keep driving.

71
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,583
-What did you say?
-You...

72
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,000
have a very handsome face.

73
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,083
Did you ever try acting in Bollywood?

74
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,125
I give addiction sometimes,
at Chabra's Casting place.

75
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,625
Addiction?

76
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,458
You don't know addiction?

77
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:52,167
We have to try out the scene
in front of the camera

78
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,458
to bag the role in a film.

79
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,958
Everyone has to do it,
even big stars like Amitabh Bachchan.

80
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:00,417
-For the hero's role?
-No, no, not the hero.

81
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,625
Okay, understood.

82
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,333
Hero's friend, brother.

83
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,292
Yes, boyfriend's role as well.

84
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,167
We are always at the top!

85
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:16,375
So your parents had lots of kids?

86
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,708
No, I'm a single child, one man army.

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,625
So why were they so lazy in naming you?

88
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,042
Just A.T?

89
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,542
Take your feet off!

90
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,708
-Just take them off!
-I'll tell her, don't worry.

91
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,375
-Get out of my rickshaw!
-Take your feet off.

92
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,250
You drive please.

93
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,625
Don't act too smart.

94
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,958
Done with your drama?

95
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:46,833
Now...

96
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,042
Listen.

97
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,875
Darkness is our ally.

98
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,125
So all the dark by-lanes are our spots.

99
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,958
It keeps the customers on bikes happy.

100
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,833
So the police
won't bother us in these by-lanes?

101
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:04,917
What?

102
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:10,458
So the police
won't bother us in these by-lanes?

103
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,958
We have an arrangement with them?

104
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,583
Yes, we have an arrangement.

105
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,125
But they raid us sometimes.

106
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:20,250
Otherwise, they'll have nothing to show
in their quarterly report.

107
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,333
So they'll take a cut from us
and also arrest us?

108
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,250
What bullshit is this!

109
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,167
Where have you come from?

110
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:32,333
This is a man's world.
Keep that in your mind.

111
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,833
Get down now, we have arrived.

112
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,625
A.T...

113
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,375
The room charges are 200 rupees per hour.

114
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,750
You know how to moan right?

115
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:53,833
He'll cum faster if you moan.
This is our trick.

116
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,125
Touching you with clothes on is free.

117
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,917
From inside the top, it's 200 rupees and
to remove the top it's 200 rupees more.

118
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,750
Okay boss.

119
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,917
Meet me alone sometime...

120
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,917
Bloody dog! Asshole!

121
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,750
Stop now!

122
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,833
-Let's leave!
-She's quite spicy Laxmi, I love it!

123
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,125
-Come on, let's go.
-Wow, amazing!

124
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,250
Move...

125
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,750
have you lost it?

126
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,250
Huh?

127
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,375
Welcome, Queen Laxmi Bai.
All hail Laxmi Bai!

128
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:33,042
Tell me, what would you like to have?
Tea, coffee?

129
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,833
-Coffee is fine.
-Coffee it is then.

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,875
I just remembered,

131
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,792
I have something very important
to share with you.

132
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,083
-What?
-Your friend Manda

133
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:48,083
recently bought a phone
worth 30,000 rupees.

134
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,042
She's earning more than you
despite being of your age.

135
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,333
Mangatram,

136
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,083
stop this habit of spreading rumours.
Stop writing stories.

137
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,667
Do your work, make coffee for me.

138
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,417
-Yes, I was just casually saying.
-Yes,

139
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,333
-I know your idea of casually.
-Listen,

140
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,375
that hotel manager
will always take his share?

141
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,375
Yes.

142
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,750
Then how can he misbehave?

143
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,083
Who do you think you are?

144
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,833
What world do you live in?

145
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,125
Men run this world.

146
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,417
They'll touch us, screw us, fuck us.

147
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,500
Men are the building

148
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,250
and we, women are its foundation.

149
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,250
All right! Understood,
don't lose your temper.

150
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,625
-Thank You!
-Welcome!

151
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,208
-Horrible coffee you've made.
-Should I make another one?

152
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,542
Yes try making a nice one this time.

153
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,917
And make it fast.

154
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:50,917
How are you?

155
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,542
I'm Tsamchoe.

156
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,250
Are you the new girl?

157
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,708
I'm Putul.

158
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,667
Want to see our version of heaven?

159
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:07,625
Yes.

160
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:20,375
She says she has only 2500 rupees

161
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,708
and look at her expenses.

162
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,500
Bitch!

163
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,583
Oh my god! This is crazy!

164
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,750
What is this?

165
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,708
All kinds of cigarettes
are available here.

166
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:44,958
-This is a super strong cigar.
-Woah!

167
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,375
This is the one they smoke in films!

168
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,000
This shop already existed,
I didn't create it.

169
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,167
Thank you!

170
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,583
Sir, this is...

171
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,875
Bengali bombshell.

172
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,208
Sir, she's with us.

173
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:38,833
Meet soon.

174
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,583
Let's go.

175
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,292
This asshole...

176
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,917
changed his name from Yadav to More
to become a cop under the reserved quota.

177
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,500
Now...

178
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,208
you have a problem with the police also?

179
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,875
No teacher. Sorry teacher.

180
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,250
Now watch and learn
how to get a customer's attention.

181
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,875
How to do customer fishing. See.

182
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:32,208
When a car starts approaching us,

183
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,875
just look away...

184
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,750
Where?

185
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,417
And act disinterested.

186
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,167
Just as you saw the police
doing with me right now.

187
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,500
Just keep looking away.

188
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,417
Play with your phone, twirl your hair,

189
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,917
make them feel
that you are not interested.

190
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,250
Once you realize
that the customer is hooked,

191
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,792
you stay here and let me talk.

192
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,000
As I talk,

193
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,000
you slowly walk over to the car

194
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
so the customer can see your body better.

195
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,625
While they do that,
you should look into the back of the car

196
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,500
to see if there are any more men
in hiding.

197
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,792
Check properly

198
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,167
because if more men appear
once you're inside the car then,

199
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,875
you're screwed.

200
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,625
Our safety is our responsibility.

201
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,583
Understood

202
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:31,958
but I thought that

203
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,458
A.T. is responsible for our safety.
This is how it is right?

204
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,042
Can you even understand what I'm saying?

205
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,042
Sorry...

206
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,292
Is she new?

207
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,042
Never seen her around here.

208
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,792
How much for a short bit of time?

209
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,708
Yes, her first day.

210
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,417
Seven hundred for her.
Three hundred for the room.

211
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,500
No bargain.

212
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm brand new.

213
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,542
Sealed pack.

214
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,167
Let's go?

215
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,125
Bitch!

216
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,125
Sealed pack!

217
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,542
See you soon darling.

218
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm busy on Monday.

219
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,875
Let's keep in touch. Bye bye.

220
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,792
Everyone says women love to talk.

221
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,292
They've clearly not given men a chance.

222
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,667
-Non stop talking.
-Alright, alright,

223
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,625
no need to show off.

224
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,875
-Run!
-Raid!

225
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,000
Come on, run fast!

226
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,333
Come on, hurry up, everyone in the car.

227
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,250
-Come on, sir!
-Hurry!

228
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,167
Come on get into the car.

229
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,667
You need a special invitation?

230
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,417
Keep moving.

231
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:16,625
-Keep moving!
-Keep moving!

232
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:20,750
Sir, no space in this one now.

233
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,667
What the hell!

234
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,375
-Get her in the other car.
-Okay, sir.

235
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,750
Come here.

236
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,042
Why are you standing here?

237
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,583
Hey!

238
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,958
You!

239
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:50,458
Hi!

240
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,708
I'm Shaari...

241
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,375
Sharanya!

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,958
Come with me.

243
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,750
Need to talk about something personal.

244
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,583
Say what you want to
in front of everyone, you pimp!

245
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,958
Who did you call a pimp?

246
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:27,958
Come with me.

247
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,458
-Come with me.
-Leave me.

248
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:31,375
Come on.

249
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,375
Hey!

250
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,000
Hey! Shut up and sit.

251
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,667
Leave me, you asshole.

252
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,542
-You went for a routine round?
-Should I help you with that?

253
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,500
Just answer my question,

254
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,917
you raided the street?

255
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,208
It was due, sir.

256
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:57,875
It has been a while since the last raid.

257
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,208
Come with me.

258
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,750
You need to make a report.
Let the girls go for now.

259
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,417
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

260
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,417
See you around.

261
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,167
Come on.

262
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,667
-Let's leave now. Get up and move.
-Let's go.

263
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,083
Let's go.

264
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,125
It's been hardly a day

265
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,500
and she's already trying
to change the system. Idiot.

266
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,875
You son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?

267
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,292
Take it to the curb.

268
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,125
Just stop the car!

269
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,750
Didn't you hear me, you pimp!
Stop the car now!

270
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,667
Son of a swine!

271
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,500
Don't move!

272
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,208
Son of a swine!

273
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,792
The water is blue today.

274
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,458
The water is blue today.

275
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:22,792
What?

276
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,208
Take out the phone.

277
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,708
Blue.

278
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,083
Who is it?

279
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,292
-Are you chasing a new girl?
-Why do you care?

280
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,875
How does it concern you?

281
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,083
-What? Sisterfucker.
-Putul...

282
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,333
-Please leave him...
-Putul, what are you doing?

283
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,792
Putul Let go off him!

284
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:45,917
What the hell are you doing?

285
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,833
-Show us your phone!
-What are you doing!

286
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,042
-Tell her please.
-Putul, let go of him.

287
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,708
-Just do as I say.
-Are you mad?

288
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,667
-Taking it out.
-Bastard.

289
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,042
-Fine!
-Take your phone out!

290
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,958
I'm taking out my phone.

291
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,083
Take your phone out
and show it to everyone.

292
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,000
What is there to show?

293
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,750
Show everyone
how many times I've called you!

294
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,125
Someone please tell her
not to scar my face!!

295
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,792
-Just leave him for now. Please!
-I called him again and again and again.

296
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,583
And he heard the phone ringing

297
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,833
but he didn't pick up my call.
Just look at his phone. Look!

298
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:12,042
-Okay but leave...
-I had to run for my life!

299
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,417
My life could have been in danger.

300
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,458
-Oh god, his face will get fucked.
-You dumbfuck.

301
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll get hurt permanently!

302
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,333
-Please!
-You asshole,

303
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,542
you live on our money,
and you fuck around with us only.

304
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,917
If this happens again,
I'll stick this knife so far up your ass

305
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,417
that you'll walk around
like a plucked chicken

306
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,375
for the rest of your life.

307
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,958
You leave him.
Let's solve it by talking about it.

308
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,500
This is no way to deal with things.
Come on, step back.

309
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,542
You leave now. Just move,
I'll deal with her, you move.

310
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,208
-But I'll teach you a lesson.
-Yes you leave, I'll handle her.

311
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,667
Yes, I'll leave. Yeah!

312
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,750
Have you lost your mind?

313
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,458
He should have received her call!
What he did was wrong!

314
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,375
-Come on, let's leave.
-No point waiting here.

315
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,000
-Come on, let's leave.
-She thinks she's the smartest.

316
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,125
When Mhatre will come down
to teach her a lesson,

317
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,708
then she'll understand.

318
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,833
Ya'll leave.

319
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:06,125
Just take different rickshaws
and head home.

320
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,875
It's the end of business for tonight.

321
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,667
-Leave me!
-Shut up!

322
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,375
Leave me, you asshole!

323
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,833
Sir, this is my house.

324
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,083
-You dog!
-Please don't bring all this into my home.

325
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,125
You dog!

326
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,625
This bastard...

327
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,208
dared to threaten my man.

328
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:39,083
One doesn't go against their own people
in their own homes

329
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,292
Because then there's no difference
between family and strangers.

330
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:43,292
Move your hand!

331
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:44,875
Let me go!

332
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,417
You'll threaten me?

333
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,833
Want to try it again?

334
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:58,042
Let's leave. Leave!

335
00:24:58,958 --> 00:24:59,792
Okay?

336
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:00,958
Thank you, sir.

337
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,708
You can deal with this
the way you want tomorrow, outside.

338
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,083
We're going to let her get away with this?

339
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:10,750
Let's go now.

340
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,250
Leave.

341
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:22,625
You whore!

342
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,125
Don't give me that look
or else I'll break your head.

343
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:31,375
If you create any more nuisance,
I'll directly involve Shinde sir.

344
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:36,125
Laxmi knows what it means to involve him.
Right Laxmi?

345
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,833
You've experienced it,

346
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,958
haven't you?

347
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,250
Tell this whore also.

348
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,292
Thank you!

349
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,667
-Hello!
-How much?

350
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,375
Is he a foreigner?

351
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,250
Where are you from?

352
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,917
Australia.

353
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:11,792
Name?

354
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,167
Peter Hibberd.

355
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,417
What are you doing in Mumbai?

356
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,583
Advertising.

357
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,083
Why India?

358
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,292
My father was Indian.

359
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,792
-Grandfather?
-Yes, grandfather.

360
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,500
Now give me a kiss.

361
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,750
Real kiss, come on.

362
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,500
You dumbfuck!

363
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,042
Shut up!

364
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,292
No!

365
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,667
Run you idiot! You dog.

366
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,208
Run you dumbfuck! Run!

367
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,375
Come on, run!

368
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,750
Run you idiot! Run! Dumbfuck, run.

369
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:10,625
Run you idiot!

370
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,375
Run, run you dumbfuck, run.

371
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,375
Dumbfuck! Asshole.

372
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,250
What's wrong?

373
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,875
-Run!
-Didn't take your medicine?

374
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,000
Run, you idiot!

375
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,208
Let's go, skinny man!

376
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:40,750
Dumbfuck!

377
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,667
Hey! Should I light a cigarette for you?

378
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,167
Run, you idiot! Run! Dumbfuck!

379
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:53,000
-Run.
-Oh Donald Trump!

380
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,667
-Let me help you, come in the auto.
-Why don't you run now?

381
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,000
-What the hell did she do?
-Let me save you.

382
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,833
Check your groin to see if all is well.

383
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,125
Yes, run away.

384
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,833
Yes, run away.

385
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,667
If you try to force yourself on women,
this is what the consequence will be.

386
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,792
This is it.

387
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,583
Now she's finished.

388
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:18,375
-Come with me.
-Be careful.

389
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:19,917
You want me to be careful?

390
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:34,708
Now this Diwali gun's firecracker
is going to get permanently extinguished.

391
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,292
Get us into more of a mess now!

392
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,000
Idiot!

393
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:42,208
Quickly give me a hand job

394
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,625
or I can do lot more than that.

395
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:45,958
You don't know me yet.

396
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,333
I'm not going to do anything for you,
you asshole.

397
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:51,458
Dumbfuck.

398
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,917
<i>You motherfucking whore!</i>

399
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,583
You'll keep abusing me?

400
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,500
Listen, I'm telling you for the last time.

401
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,458
Just do the hand job.
It'll be fun, trust me. Just try it.

402
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:08,167
Do whatever the hell you want
to do yourself, you pimp!

403
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:16,167
You can't look at my face.
You want to be a dog from behind.

404
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,208
-Dog? A dog?
-Be a dog.

405
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,667
Be a Dog.

406
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:28,292
So you finally reveal your true identity!
A dog.

407
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,792
Dumbfuck...

408
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,250
You all go home now.

409
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,917
We'll send her later.

410
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,375
Move, come on move.

411
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:01,000
Come on, leave, move. Leave!

412
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:37,583
Fucking animal. Dumbfuck.

413
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:41,458
There's no respect for me in Mumbai.

414
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,167
Hey!

415
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,042
I may die a dog's death.

416
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,375
But I won't live a dog's life.

417
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:32,917
Brother, you can question any girl
in the town about my manhood,

418
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,208
the reports won't disappoint you...

419
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,750
Any idea what's gotten into him?

420
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,542
Sister,

421
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,625
-Sharanya told me this.
-What?

422
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,792
Forget about A.T.

423
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,500
All the customers
have started behaving themselves,

424
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,667
everyone's talking nicely.

425
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,125
-No one's fooling around.
-Really?

426
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,583
Nobody is talking
about what happened to Putul,

427
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,833
but instead what she did to that man.

428
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:29,917
Sister, you know everyone
calls her Tikli now.

429
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,833
What?

430
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,417
Oh come on, don't you remember?

431
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,542
You yourself gave her that name
the other day.

432
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:52,292
Let's go to work.

433
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,333
How are you Tikli?

434
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,125
Tikli?

435
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,708
Yes, your new name.

436
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,708
All the girls decided to call you that.

437
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:13,708
Sister...

438
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,583
Can I ask you something?

439
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:21,583
Go ahead, ask.

440
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:27,292
Why do we allow men
to take advantage of us?

441
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:34,375
We earn
and they make a cut out of our money.

442
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,292
Oh my god, the same topic again.

443
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,833
Will you stop repeating
yourself like a record?

444
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:39,750
This is a man's world.

445
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,833
Please understand! Idiot.

446
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:44,000
This is where you're wrong.

447
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,875
This is not a man's world.

448
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,958
This is our work, not theirs.

449
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:53,625
This is our business. Not theirs.

450
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,333
Our body

451
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:01,917
and the dirty feeling with
which we return home every night,

452
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,792
is also ours.

453
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:08,500
The pain, the discomfort, it's all ours.

454
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:12,792
So then how is it their world?

455
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,958
Why can't we make our own system, Laxmi?

456
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,292
We'll reap what we sow. Simple.

457
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,125
I thought you'd become sensible by now

458
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:28,833
but I was wrong.

459
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,625
Just stay away from me from now on.
That's it.

460
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,625
Shit!

461
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,375
Bloody dog, just pick up!

462
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,375
Open the door.

463
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,708
-Sir...
-Get out of the car.

464
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,500
Sit inside.

465
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,917
Be comfortable.

466
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,667
-Come on...
-Come on...

467
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,875
No!

468
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,042
-Hold her.
-No, sir.

469
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,333
-Hold her.
-No! No sir, no, sir.

470
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,833
No! No, sir. Not again.

471
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,167
I'll kill you.

472
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,458
Back off or I'll kill you, you asshole.

473
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,375
I'll kill you. Back off or I'll kill you.

474
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,208
You fucking dog.

475
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,917
-Follow her man!
-Fuck that! Let's find the key first.

476
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,083
Leave her, find the key first!

477
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,000
Cheetah's speed,

478
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,375
a hawk's vision,

479
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,917
and Bajirao's sword,

480
00:38:58,708 --> 00:38:59,875
no not the sword.

481
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:04,667
One should never doubt on these.
It could outwit anyone.

482
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,000
Hello Mhatre sir.

483
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,375
You'll live for a 100 years.
I was going to call you.

484
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,250
What a brilliant job you've done sir.
Absolutely brilliant.

485
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:20,125
And the police
has also done our work very well.

486
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,292
In a good way,
they've taught Putul her lesson very well.

487
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,917
They've taught Putul
her lesson very well...

488
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,458
That whore
has finally understood her place.

489
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,750
Remember how you did the same with Laxmi?

490
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,458
Yes?

491
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:35,458
Where are you?

492
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:37,958
Okay, I'll be there.

493
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,500
Okay dear.

494
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,208
Good afternoon.

495
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,708
Oh my god!

496
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:42,042
What happened?

497
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,000
Is everything all right?

498
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,875
What did you say earlier?

499
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,417
Our own system?

500
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,125
Tell me, how do you think
we'll make our own system?

501
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,417
To be honest,

502
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,708
-I haven't thought it through yet.
-Then start thinking.

503
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:06,583
It's time to seriously think about it.

504
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,917
So you accept that I was right earlier?

505
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,792
I don't know about being right,

506
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:18,833
but you're definitely not wrong.

507
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:25,000
See Tikli, right now this is your fight.

508
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:31,000
But I've understood that in this fight,
I'm on your side

509
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,125
and not theirs.

510
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:35,958
Come on, great.

511
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,292
Great.

512
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,125
At least
we have the right beginning to this.

513
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,167
Hey Monu, tell me.

514
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,458
Nothing, I'm just at home...

515
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,333
drinking.

516
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:12,125
Can I call you tomorrow? Okay, bye.

517
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,375
What's with so much red?

518
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,917
It's the colour of revolution.

519
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,167
So tell us, Laxmi.

520
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:03,000
Why this sudden secret meeting
in the dead of the night?

521
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,292
Wow.

522
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,500
Now I understand.

523
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:18,500
This is Tikli's rally.

524
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,750
Come on, everyone speak up,
who'll vote for Tikli?

525
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,958
I think everyone should vote for her.

526
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,042
Today I've come to talk
about something very serious.

527
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:36,125
There you go!
The speech has finally begun.

528
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,167
Assholes.

529
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,500
You're an asshole. Yes, you as well.

530
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:51,750
We are all big brainless assholes.

531
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:56,583
Everyday, Mhatre and his men,
the policemen are openly fucking us over.

532
00:43:57,917 --> 00:44:01,500
Every man in the system
has his hands inside our skirts.

533
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,500
Means every man in this system
has their hands up our skirts

534
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,250
and we are not doing anything about it.

535
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,708
Except sitting quietly.

536
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,583
We're all assholes.

537
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,042
What is our basic need?

538
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,583
Safety and protection.

539
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:18,833
Just think.

540
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:22,417
The fears are ours,
so is the way we deal with them.

541
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,958
That dirty feeling we have every night.

542
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:29,917
All ours?

543
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,375
The money is fucking ours.

544
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:37,250
But are we getting safety?

545
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,042
And how many times
have we actually been protected?

546
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:43,625
These assholes take money from us

547
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,250
and then misbehave with us.

548
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:47,167
But all of us are quiet.

549
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:51,042
Why haven't we made our own system yet,

550
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,958
where we get to keep the money we earn?

551
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,667
She's completely gone mad.

552
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,417
Absolutely lost it.

553
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,125
If Mhatre sir comes to know about this,

554
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:05,792
he'll skin us all.

555
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:09,917
Come on, let's get back to work.

556
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:19,167
You'll go against your own masters?

557
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,042
She's not finished.
Let her finish saying what she wants to

558
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,750
and then you do whatever you want to.

559
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:32,375
Simple.

560
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:48,042
Okay, I'm a new entrant, correct?

561
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,958
But Laxmi here is an old timer, right?

562
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,833
And she also thinks I'm right.

563
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,500
Our own system!

564
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,292
Unless we try, we'll never know.

565
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:07,292
We'll make our own system
and actually be safe.

566
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:08,875
Plus we'll earn more money.

567
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,083
Just think about
how many of you support your families,

568
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:13,958
back home, with that money. Just think.

569
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:20,750
Laxmi, Mhatre sir is our provider.

570
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:25,208
He's done so much for you and yet,
you'll go against him?

571
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,125
This is the real problem.

572
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:34,000
Mhatre, since the beginning has been
against us.

573
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,958
We just took time to realize that.

574
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:41,667
It's difficult,

575
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,917
but I've finally understood.

576
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,583
We earn, we eat!

577
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:53,250
Simple.

578
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:57,458
You will die

579
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:00,708
and get us all killed.

580
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,500
Simple.

581
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,542
She's gone completely mad!

582
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:09,708
Let's leave!

583
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,375
Come on, let's go!

584
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:36,292
What's the plan?

585
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:42,083
First of all, we'll need to find someone
in the police department

586
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,583
who would add our weekly money
cut to the larger pool?

587
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:49,458
The police can't know we're doing this.

588
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,208
We need to get this done fast!

589
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:59,792
I'm sure Manda would've already
informed Mhatre, that bitch!

590
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,875
And here Manda hits a sixer, that bitch!

591
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,083
You bitch!

592
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:21,333
You're a new entrant here and you think
you can log heads with Mhatre?

593
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,333
You bitch!

594
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,625
Hey... Hey.

595
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:26,750
Please sir.

596
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,333
Laxmi!

597
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,042
Laxmi.

598
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,042
I had heard of it

599
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,417
and today I witnessed it.

600
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,000
What's going on, Laxmi?

601
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:56,250
-I do so much for you all...
-That's the problem.

602
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,125
That you do nothing for us Mhatre sir.

603
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,542
You had ordered the police guy
to rape her in the police station.

604
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,250
Isn't that right?

605
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:11,583
I heard it from your idiot's mouth.

606
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:13,917
-What a liar!
-Hey.

607
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,583
-Hey.
-Asshole.

608
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,042
We'll solve this.

609
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:20,583
Let's go now. Just leave, man!

610
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,833
-Let's leave.
-Go!

611
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,042
Go away!

612
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,292
Go, asshole!

613
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,375
Let's go!

614
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,083
Let's go!

615
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,333
How are you whistling so calmly?

616
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,625
Today they twisted our arms,
tomorrow they'll dare to pee on our heads.

617
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,458
I say we call our boys now
and finish these girls.

618
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,375
Hey.

619
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,125
Mr. Angry Young Man.

620
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:21,042
Don't take more stress now.

621
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:27,042
They are also trying to show pride
by not giving the weekly cut.

622
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,125
The police will handle them
in their style.

623
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:37,167
If we do something and things get worse,

624
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:40,667
Shinde sir will blame us.

625
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,292
We'll just sit in the stadium,

626
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:49,125
have popcorn and enjoy the game.

627
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,833
Enjoy the situation.

628
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:56,333
<i>Dilip Deshpande.</i>

629
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,042
<i>A constable for the last 20 years.</i>

630
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:03,000
<i>Money doesn't affect him.</i>

631
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:05,625
<i>But...</i>

632
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:16,250
Still DSP?

633
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:25,250
One Antiquity Blue. Ninety milliliters.

634
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,708
We've come here to become your friends.

635
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,125
Friends?

636
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,542
What's going on here?

637
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,542
Sir, we just want you
to drink Antiquity every day.

638
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,917
Sir, you just take the weekly cut from us

639
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,708
and add that money with Mhatre's money
in the police station.

640
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,708
We take responsibility
of getting you your Antiquity every day.

641
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,375
How much ever you want.

642
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,750
All the time.

643
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,417
Antiquity Blue.

644
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,500
A whisky with a soul, sir. Soul.

645
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:35,000
What a great night we had today.

646
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,000
Just like the film <i>Rang De Basanti.</i>

647
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,833
You remember
how <i>Rang de Basanti</i> ends right?

648
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,083
Your sense of humor...

649
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,458
is quite nice.

650
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,333
Come, today two friends...

651
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:57,333
will drink rum together.

652
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,333
We are not friends, Tikli.

653
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,042
We live together.

654
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:10,000
We work together.

655
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:14,167
That's it. I'm not a friendly type
like you, understood?

656
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,917
And in this revolution,

657
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:20,167
I'm standing right behind you
because you're right.

658
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,708
But this is your revolution,

659
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,083
not mine.

660
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:32,292
A bomb without a switch!

661
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,500
Keeps lecturing me on small things.

662
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,833
Dear roommate madam.

663
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:41,750
I have a small request.

664
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,458
Please don't say this
in front of the other girls.

665
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:49,625
We all need to look united.

666
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,083
Okay.

667
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,792
I've paid half the rent.

668
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,042
Okay sisters, listen up.

669
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:20,667
Until yesterday, all the men knew
that Mhatre is protecting us.

670
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,750
Now all of them know we're alone.

671
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:28,625
So from tonight,
no girl will go alone with the customer.

672
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,292
Another girl will always accompany her.

673
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,750
But why will the customer agree?

674
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,125
How will this work? She's watching us.

675
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:08,500
How will this work? She's watching us.

676
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,458
This is how.

677
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,292
You can watch her and touch me.

678
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:48,375
Hi sexy. Shall we go?

679
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,750
-Let's go.
-Hey handsome.

680
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,167
Seeing you after so long.

681
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:08,875
You look dashing.

682
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:12,250
How do I look?

683
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:55,500
Hey!

684
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:57,917
Have you lost it?

685
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,125
You know you have to charge extra
to remove the top.

686
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,583
Oh Laxmi,

687
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,458
we need to make regular customers
really fast now.

688
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:09,917
So we need to do things
which others won't do.

689
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:14,292
We should have the best reputation.
Simple!

690
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:16,667
Extra smart!

691
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:31,958
Come on, let's leave fast.

692
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:34,375
You can write later.

693
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:47,708
Take it!

694
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:50,417
There's a special rate for you.

695
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,167
-What?
-Special rate 600 rupees.

696
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,625
But it was 200 until yesterday?

697
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,625
Until yesterday,
you had someone looking over you .

698
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:11,875
Keep it.

699
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,792
Lovely Laxmi.

700
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,042
-Chocolate?
-Yes, of course take it.

701
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:19,917
Keep it.

702
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:22,167
Let's go.

703
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:29,833
That's it!

704
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,667
What's up?

705
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:36,917
Mind blowing news.

706
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42,833
Customers haven't reduced at all.
All are the same.

707
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:44,333
Absolutely correct!

708
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:47,375
But the hotel manager
is charging us 600 rupees now.

709
00:58:47,917 --> 00:58:49,417
Bloody idiot.

710
00:58:50,042 --> 00:58:52,500
We'll have to find a solution to this.

711
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:57,292
-He's one son of a bitch!
-Son of a bitch!

712
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:58,875
Bastard!

713
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,292
Yes we want.

714
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:12,375
You want to go for another round?

715
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,417
How will it happen again so soon?

716
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:17,500
Challenge?

717
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:21,792
Sure.

718
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,042
Come on, pay up 1000 rupees.

719
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:53,208
One thousand rupees?

720
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,750
Hero,

721
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,250
where else will you get
such an experience?

722
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,000
Double benefit, double charge.

723
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,042
There you go.

724
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,042
<i>This Mumbai city is also a woman like us.</i>

725
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,375
<i>Suppressed...</i>

726
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:36,083
<i>with the pressure of the entire world.</i>

727
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:39,417
<i>She sells herself and her kids</i>

728
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,292
<i>and everyone just
eats out of her earnings.</i>

729
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,333
<i>The people that she considers her own</i>

730
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:48,708
<i>are the ones who finally destroy her.</i>

731
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,917
<i>A million houses,</i>

732
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,958
<i>thousands in each house</i>

733
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:57,542
<i>and their big dreams,</i>

734
01:00:58,417 --> 01:00:59,917
<i>and the burden of that...</i>

735
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,125
<i>is on Mumbai.</i>

736
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:17,625
Hey.

737
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,208
Drink?

738
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,042
No.

739
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,208
Can I tell you something honestly?

740
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,667
My father also died this way.

741
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:42,708
Meaning my father actually passed away
because of this.

742
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,083
Heavy drinking.

743
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:46,958
Because of rum.

744
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,292
If you want, I can change the drink.

745
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,167
That's not necessary.

746
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,583
You drink.

747
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:57,208
I won't.

748
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,625
Tell me something.

749
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,458
Who is Monu?

750
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:11,958
Monu is my brother.

751
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:15,792
He misses me every day.

752
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:18,125
He's the closest to me...

753
01:02:19,042 --> 01:02:20,417
in the entire world.

754
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:23,042
He knows I live alone here

755
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:28,375
so he calls every day to check up on me.

756
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:32,958
Are you a single child?

757
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,083
One hundred percent.

758
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:38,625
Now listen,

759
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:43,458
we need to increase the members
in our gang quickly.

760
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,833
Think up a plan for that.

761
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:46,667
I have a plan.

762
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,292
What?

763
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:50,292
But this time,
you'll have to take the lead.

764
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:52,042
Why?

765
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:57,125
Because the girls need to feel
that you are contributing too.

766
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,417
Okay, tell me what the plan is.

767
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,375
Mangatram Pachauri.

768
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:10,208
Mangatram Pachauri?

769
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:12,917
You all remember what to do right?

770
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,167
Pach Pach sir...

771
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:24,917
Do you have Marlboro?

772
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:26,500
Marlboro?

773
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,750
Changed your brand?

774
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:30,167
No Gold Flake?

775
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,625
-How many?
-One packet.

776
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:36,417
Full packet?

777
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:38,250
Really?

778
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,917
Let's take a selfie?

779
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,042
And Horlicks for everyone, on me.

780
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,500
Everyone get away from the cycle.

781
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,708
And I don't have so much change.

782
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:05,917
Hey Uncle...

783
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Can't you all stand still
without making a mess?

784
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:12,042
Hold on, I am giving you your silly Boro.

785
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:15,000
Uncle, all our lives,
we've been indebted to you.

786
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,208
Deduct the amount
from my note and keep the rest.

787
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:21,583
Keep the rest? Really?

788
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,167
Full packet,

789
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:27,292
Horlicks is on the house.

790
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,458
Looks like someone's won the lottery?

791
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:32,333
This is all because of Queen Tikli.

792
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:35,583
Why isn't she on a spending spree then?

793
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:39,125
She's buying cigarette cartons in bulk.

794
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:44,125
That also from that big shot
outside the Basti.

795
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,417
<i>What an idea!</i>

796
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,417
<i>Pachauri Bulletin.</i>

797
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,833
Stop the car.

798
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,042
Can you both handle the two of us?

799
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:18,417
Sir, everybody offers two on two.

800
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:20,458
We offer you three for two.

801
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,583
Wow, a whore who writes dialogues.

802
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,667
Three thousand rupees for three girls.

803
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,917
I'll give you 4000.

804
01:05:35,042 --> 01:05:35,875
There you go.

805
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:54,542
We're three men,

806
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:56,375
not two.

807
01:05:57,292 --> 01:06:00,542
Don't you want to meet the third one?
Why?

808
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,792
What happened? Lost your voice?

809
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:13,792
Get out of the car.

810
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,000
Get out!

811
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,417
Move!

812
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:26,375
-This is on behalf of Mhatre sir.
-He sends his regards.

813
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:31,042
Sir...

814
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:32,667
Sir...

815
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:34,542
If you're going to kill us together,

816
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,458
then fuck us together as well.

817
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:55,625
-Catch them now!
-Run, just run!

818
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,917
-Catch them.
-Run.

819
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,875
-Just run.
-Follow them now!

820
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:01,875
Hey!

821
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:26,958
Sharanya?

822
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,542
I tried calling her.

823
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:36,250
Her phone's been dead since evening.

824
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,833
I'll call Tsamchoe.

825
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:46,375
She stays nearby, she can go check on her.

826
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,208
Tsamchoe's message.

827
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,250
She says...

828
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:55,917
Sharanya is okay.

829
01:07:56,792 --> 01:08:00,500
They were able to catch hold of her
but she escaped again.

830
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,667
She's a bit hurt.

831
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:06,958
Bloody assholes.

832
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:11,375
This security issue has become serious.

833
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,500
We'll have to find a solution to it soon.

834
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,042
Your revolution.

835
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,292
You think.

836
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,125
That's really the limit, Laxmi.

837
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:28,833
I swear, it's the limit.

838
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:42,083
What is Amboli?

839
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:46,125
Amboli is Andheri's cousin.

840
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:51,292
But Amboli's father
doesn't earn as much as Andheri's father.

841
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:53,375
So when both go to a restaurant,

842
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:57,333
Amboli can't order what Andheri can.

843
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:58,833
Understood?

844
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,125
How are you?

845
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:02,042
-Laxmi, I want to show you something.
-What?

846
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,083
What is it?

847
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:04,708
How are you?

848
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,125
Hold this.

849
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:08,792
Look at this.

850
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,417
Hey!

851
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:13,458
Psycho!

852
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:15,458
Are you mad? What is this?

853
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:16,875
Don't worry.

854
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:19,958
I punched one guy really hard.

855
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:23,208
And pushed the other one in a manhole.

856
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,167
-And then you took a photo of him?
-Yes.

857
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,417
That's how I got stuck.

858
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,875
I stopped to take a photo
and just then, the other guy hit me...

859
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:33,292
from behind.

860
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,125
I'm going to kill that Mhatre.

861
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:42,958
It's a good thing
she's not in the hospital.

862
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:45,042
Otherwise, Laxmi couldn't have visited.

863
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,458
Hey, shut up!

864
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,542
-There's nothing.
-Oh, didn't she tell you?

865
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,958
-It's nothing man.
-Laxmi faints the moment

866
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:53,333
she steps into a hospital.

867
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,208
-Really?
-It's not a big deal.

868
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,667
Shut up you guys!

869
01:09:58,833 --> 01:09:59,667
What?

870
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,833
Okay, we have some amazing news.

871
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,458
Tell them.

872
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:08,708
Three more girls want to join our gang.

873
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:09,625
Really?

874
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:11,750
That's good news.

875
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,292
Yes, good news,

876
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:18,125
but what are we going to do
about Mhatre's goons?

877
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:21,292
I want to break their bones!

878
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:25,875
Mhatre will himself save us from Mhatre.

879
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:28,333
-Ask me how.
-How?

880
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,458
A few years ago,
Mhatre's wife had an affair with someone.

881
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:37,125
So to spy on her, Mhatre had something
installed on his as well as her phone.

882
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:39,875
-What is it called?
-I know! It's an app.

883
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:43,583
We can connect two phones with each other.

884
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:55,500
<i>And we'll make our own security system.</i>

885
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:58,792
<i>We'll call them "The Pigeon Department".</i>

886
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,583
I gave you the idea.

887
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,583
It's your job to convince him.

888
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,167
-Atul brother.
-Yes.

889
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,792
-How are you?
-All good.

890
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:18,917
What kind of spectacles
are you wearing? No glass?

891
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,583
What kind of a strange hairdo is this?

892
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:24,250
-It's the latest style.
-This is my latest style.

893
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:31,417
Okay listen, about your scooter...

894
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:34,500
-Yes?
-Do you use it all day?

895
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,250
No, I just use it to travel
to and fro from home.

896
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:42,417
Yes but sometimes, the boys take it
to roam around with girlfriends.

897
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,333
That's it.

898
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,167
So can we rent your scooter?

899
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,917
See, you also go home
at the same time as us,

900
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,583
around 2:00 to 3:00 a.m.

901
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,750
And we can pay you for it.

902
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,292
But what will you do with it?

903
01:11:59,542 --> 01:12:01,042
You know Tsamchoe right?

904
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:03,708
Her sister got a job at the call centre.

905
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:06,250
So we need it to pick her up
and drop her off.

906
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,625
I've heard all about it.

907
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:12,375
You people have started a new business...

908
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:14,542
Am I right?

909
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:17,667
You all have money for the petrol?

910
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,708
Yes.

911
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:22,042
Take the scooter. I don't need any rent.

912
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:24,708
Just return it back safely at night.

913
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,708
Here!

914
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,000
Thank you Atul brother.

915
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:33,417
Thank you!

916
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,375
One of you knows how to ride right?

917
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:36,833
Tikli?

918
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,125
I can ride.

919
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:39,792
-That's good.
-Thank you.

920
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:42,250
Be careful Laxmi.

921
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:46,500
Come on, let's go.

922
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:49,292
You ride.

923
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:50,917
You don't know how to ride, do you?

924
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,375
It's your turn to be Aamir Khan now.

925
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,417
-<i>Dhoom 4.</i>
-I knew.

926
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,500
You don't know how to ride. You sit.

927
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:00,250
Sit now and don't be a nuisance.

928
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:04,417
<i>This friendship...</i>

929
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,250
<i>We will never break</i>

930
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,417
<i>-I will take my last breath...</i>
-Oh god,

931
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,000
-<i>But I'll never leave your side</i>
-don't move so much, little Elvis.

932
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:19,708
Are you done having fun?

933
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,708
-Will you listen to me now?
-Sure, tell me.

934
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:25,958
We need to admit Rekha and Khairunnisa

935
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:28,083
in our team at the earliest.

936
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:29,458
Understood?

937
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,458
"Tikli and Laxmi Bomb Gang,"

938
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,542
Pigeon Department.

939
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,958
Sit carefully.

940
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:48,167
Two thousand five hundred
for the two of us.

941
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,417
What's this?

942
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:12,875
What you're doing isn't right.

943
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:26,083
Hey, let's go...

944
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:28,208
-Come on...
-Hey! look at this.

945
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:43,375
Fucking whore... You want revolution?

946
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:45,875
-I'll teach you how to do revolution.
-Leave...

947
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,333
-Brother, I really need to pee...
-Fuck off, you fucker!

948
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,208
Let us go, why're you doing this to us!

949
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:59,958
Leave... Leave us.

950
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:02,000
-Why are you doing this to us?
-Shut up bitch!

951
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,000
Shut up!

952
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:07,667
-Leave... Just leave us.
-Don't talk much.

953
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,750
-Leave... Just leave us.
-Don't talk much bitch.

954
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:15,875
-Fucking bitch!
-Sisterfucker!

955
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:18,000
How the fuck did they know where we are?

956
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:22,333
You fucking asshole!
I'll teach you to be a dick!

957
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:33,958
Bitch!

958
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:35,625
Sisterfucker!

959
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:37,750
Haven't found your gun yet?

960
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:42,083
Where do you think you're going?

961
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,333
What were you saying?

962
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:50,125
Show me your manhood now you bastard!

963
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,750
Bastard.

964
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,750
This Pigeon Department idea
was pretty cool.

965
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,500
It was a raging success.

966
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:22,083
The parrot sings its own praises.

967
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:23,125
What?

968
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,167
You don't have
a single word of praise ever,

969
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,250
so I thought I'd do the honours myself.

970
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:42,000
I have to deal with it at night anyway,

971
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:43,125
may as well be a part of it now.

972
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:50,833
Is it very old?

973
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:52,917
How old is that?

974
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,458
Older than you for sure.

975
01:16:57,917 --> 01:16:59,375
It's an antique piece.

976
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,250
It was my grandmother's.

977
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,875
A family heirloom for three generations...

978
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,250
Last month, someone offered me
500,000 rupees for it...

979
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,292
I didn't sell it.

980
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:21,083
It's the only symbol left
of my family.

981
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,833
Someone would think we're friends...

982
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:39,833
Friends!

983
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,000
What world are you kids living in?

984
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:19,875
There's no security problem!

985
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:24,750
That Tikli takes care of the entire gang.

986
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:25,708
Really?

987
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:27,750
-How's that possible?
-How?

988
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:33,042
-Come. I'll tell you, come.
-What are you going to tell us?

989
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,792
Come along.

990
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:35,958
Come on girls.

991
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,792
-Come!
-Listen to what he says.

992
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:38,750
Come!

993
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,667
What did you buy this time?

994
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:52,833
What did you buy this time?

995
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:55,208
This time?

996
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,417
I didn't mean it like that.

997
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:04,250
-I've got something for you too.
-What?

998
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:09,875
Phone?

999
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:12,917
Tikli have you lost it?

1000
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,167
Why did you waste money on me?

1001
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:18,167
Don't worry, I'll set up your Facebook
and WhatsApp accounts now.

1002
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:22,583
I don't want this Facebook, WhatsApp.
Another headache.

1003
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:26,000
And this is...

1004
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:28,750
what I bought for myself.

1005
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:32,708
Tikli.

1006
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:36,125
-Tikli.
-Isn't it beautiful?

1007
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:39,042
Don't you think
you should save some money?

1008
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:40,667
Put on!

1009
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:42,875
What for?

1010
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:47,417
See, we've just started our business.

1011
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,333
And we have a long way ahead

1012
01:20:49,417 --> 01:20:51,292
and we'll need a lot
of money along the way.

1013
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:58,792
Laxmi, I've had very little money in life.

1014
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:01,583
And I like to enjoy my money.

1015
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,167
Look, you like to save your money.

1016
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:07,083
Have I ever asked, why are you so miserly?

1017
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:09,833
You save, I spend.

1018
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:13,292
-Different natures.
-It's not about our nature, Tikli.

1019
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,417
We all should save money right now!

1020
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:18,417
<i>You'll never get gold in your life.</i>

1021
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,750
Please try and understand.

1022
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,375
<i>You'll live a dog's life,</i>

1023
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,958
<i>you'll die a dog's death.</i>

1024
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,958
<i>What!</i>

1025
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,458
Look, Laxmi.

1026
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:36,667
My body, my hard work and my money.

1027
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,875
I'll do as I please.

1028
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:40,625
I'll shove it up my ass

1029
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:42,792
or burn it if I want to.

1030
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:22,250
-Hello, sir.
-Come sit.

1031
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,708
How was your holiday?

1032
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:28,333
Fantastic, absolutely brilliant!

1033
01:22:28,417 --> 01:22:29,458
Discovery.

1034
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:32,667
All okay here?

1035
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:35,292
How can things be okay here?

1036
01:22:37,208 --> 01:22:40,917
Sir, that gang is becoming bigger
by the day.

1037
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,500
What do you mean bigger?

1038
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,292
Till yesterday, there were 15 girls
in the Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang.

1039
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:50,917
What did you say?

1040
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:54,583
"Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang?"

1041
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,333
That's what they are called.

1042
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:57,542
But why are you calling them that?

1043
01:22:57,625 --> 01:22:58,875
So what am I supposed to call them?

1044
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:01,958
Okay, sorry.

1045
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:06,000
-Fifteen girls?
-And today one more.

1046
01:23:06,917 --> 01:23:07,833
Sixteen.

1047
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:10,750
Bitches! You should send our boys.

1048
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:12,208
I sent them sir.

1049
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:13,917
They got beaten up and ran away.

1050
01:23:14,542 --> 01:23:16,500
I wasn't beating them up
because they're women,

1051
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:19,042
but they are taking us men for a ride.

1052
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,042
They've become very smart.

1053
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:23,833
They use something
on their phones... Tracking...

1054
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:26,125
Prey!

1055
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,708
The app you used to use
to keep a check on your wife... The same.

1056
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,875
This is Laxmi's handiwork...
Bloody bitch...

1057
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:34,542
-What are the police doing?
-What will the police do sir?

1058
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:35,792
You tell me, what can they do?

1059
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:38,667
They are getting their money, cut on time

1060
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,083
and it's the same amount.

1061
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,750
This means she has struck a deal
with the police...

1062
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:45,917
and now she's making a fool out of us.

1063
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:47,625
Great...

1064
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,292
Well done!

1065
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:52,042
Teach them a lesson!

1066
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,083
Bu Bu...

1067
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,833
Bu Bu...

1068
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:43,958
Run! Police...

1069
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:55,250
<i>Get in quickly, come on...</i>

1070
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:57,333
Come on!

1071
01:24:57,417 --> 01:24:59,958
Where do you think you're going?

1072
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:01,167
-Leave me!
-Shut up!

1073
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,500
-Laxmi...
-Come on...

1074
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:03,417
Get in, get in!

1075
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,333
Bring her!

1076
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:06,833
Throw her on the floor.

1077
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:09,208
Please let her go!

1078
01:25:09,292 --> 01:25:11,125
Let her go!

1079
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:14,042
Now it's your turn...

1080
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:16,833
No! Please let her go!

1081
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:19,167
Revolutionaries!

1082
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:21,500
Now I'll show you what it's really
like on screen.

1083
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:22,417
Turn her around.

1084
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,083
Turn her around.

1085
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,792
Bloody bastard, you asshole!

1086
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:29,000
-Dog!
-Go ahead!

1087
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,167
Take this!

1088
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,042
Get up!

1089
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:34,958
Go ahead!

1090
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:38,708
Tikli..

1091
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:54,417
Tikli...

1092
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,833
-Let me go. Leave me...
-Stop her... stop her now!

1093
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:02,500
You stop.

1094
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:05,083
Sir!

1095
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:06,542
This is not right sir.

1096
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:09,792
We might be from the street,
but this isn't the way to treat us sir.

1097
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,708
-Leave her!
-Sir!

1098
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,833
Look sir...

1099
01:26:13,917 --> 01:26:16,458
Please come inside and see.

1100
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:19,667
Tear this bitch's clothes off...

1101
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,167
More! Come here now!

1102
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,417
Sir... he's really hurt the girl.
She's unconscious.

1103
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:31,667
My room.

1104
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:35,208
I said now!

1105
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,833
Take her to the hospital soon.

1106
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,125
Thank you sir. Thank you.

1107
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:57,792
Keep your hands away.
Don't you dare touch her.

1108
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,042
-Pick her up.
-Pick her up.

1109
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,250
Pick her up.

1110
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,042
Slowly.

1111
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,667
Come.

1112
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:06,000
Slowly, slowly.

1113
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,500
Be slow!

1114
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:20,083
Who are you?

1115
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:25,417
Her family.

1116
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:29,042
Okay. Look, she has a fractured rib.

1117
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:30,542
Her wind pipe is damaged.

1118
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,833
Due to excess pressure on the chest
and the throat, she's hurt badly.

1119
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:36,625
We'll have to keep her
on oxygen support...

1120
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:38,667
and under observation for a few days.

1121
01:27:39,417 --> 01:27:43,792
Also, try not to indulge in any fights
for the next few days.

1122
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,667
Laxmi Didi...

1123
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,292
Laxmi!

1124
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:52,750
Shaari... take her home.

1125
01:27:54,792 --> 01:27:56,250
She won't be of any help.

1126
01:27:57,083 --> 01:28:00,667
Take her home in a cab.

1127
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:53,708
Fuck you Mumbai.

1128
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:56,500
Go fuck yourself in the ass.

1129
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:12,458
But you're also like us.

1130
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:15,625
A woman.

1131
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:21,542
Who has been taken advantage of
by everybody.

1132
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:31,625
<i>Goddess Mumba Devi</i>

1133
01:29:31,917 --> 01:29:36,083
<i>Please forgive me</i>

1134
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:42,167
<i>For I have stood by and thus been part</i>

1135
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:48,833
<i>Of every terrible punishment you've borne</i>

1136
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:16,000
Even the short time hotel owners
have refused to let us in...

1137
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,083
We're ready to pay extra,

1138
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,625
but we can't stop working, right?

1139
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:25,708
They asked us
to leave these streets forever.

1140
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,250
They asked us to leave Mumbai, for good.

1141
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:33,292
They said if they see us again,

1142
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:34,708
they will kill us.

1143
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:41,417
We'll leave these streets.

1144
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:45,833
We won't be seen ever again.

1145
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:51,083
But Mumbai doesn't belong to anyone!

1146
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,208
This is our work.

1147
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:58,083
And this is what we will do.

1148
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:01,458
In the same place,
within the same streets.

1149
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:05,333
We'll work
and we won't even pay a single rupee.

1150
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:08,042
-What? What do you mean?
-How?

1151
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,333
-Just wait a sec.
-What is she saying?

1152
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:11,917
Listen girls.

1153
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:14,792
Behind the main roads,

1154
01:33:15,417 --> 01:33:18,583
at the gates of broken buildings,
there's one thing...

1155
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,625
that can be part of our new system.

1156
01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:26,833
-What is it?
-What is it?

1157
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:29,333
Watchmen.

1158
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:46,167
<i>If the hotel guys refuse to let us in,</i>

1159
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:49,917
<i>this is our new hotel.</i>

1160
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,000
<i>This is our second hotel.</i>

1161
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:04,208
<i>No manager, no drama, no bribe!</i>

1162
01:34:09,167 --> 01:34:10,583
<i>And police?</i>

1163
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:12,958
<i>I'm getting a switch made
for one of the road lights.</i>

1164
01:34:13,042 --> 01:34:14,250
<i>An electrician is helping us out.</i>

1165
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:17,875
<i>This light can be seen
from each corner of the park.</i>

1166
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:04,042
<i>And if a watchman demands for extra bribe?</i>

1167
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:35,458
The money is ours... and so is Mumbai,
he is also our own!

1168
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:37,500
Mumbai, "she" also is our own!

1169
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:42,708
Laxmi Didi...
today three new girls joined the group.

1170
01:35:42,792 --> 01:35:45,500
-Shall I show you their pictures?
-My dear selfie pro...

1171
01:35:46,292 --> 01:35:48,208
Have you clicked their picture?

1172
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:50,458
Don't you think
you should reveal your sexiest habits

1173
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:53,042
just a slightly bit slower to new people?

1174
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:54,958
Okay listen.

1175
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:58,083
Now there's one thing
that could turn our small gang

1176
01:35:58,167 --> 01:36:00,792
into a big company.

1177
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:02,833
See...

1178
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:05,125
Every girl will add 500 rupees

1179
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:07,708
-in this bag every day.
-But?

1180
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:10,833
-See, what do we want?
-What?

1181
01:36:11,667 --> 01:36:13,708
Safety, right?

1182
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:17,917
So we need to cut that fool Mhatre
and the likes of him out.

1183
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,917
We will approach
Corporator Shinde directly.

1184
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:24,042
Now it'll be just us

1185
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:26,167
and the Corporator.

1186
01:36:26,917 --> 01:36:30,208
Hotel guys out, police out, Mhatre out.

1187
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:31,917
Laxmi Bomb,

1188
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,167
-isn't that a bit too much?
-Listen to me.

1189
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:39,083
Now we have to think like the big bosses
of a big company.

1190
01:36:39,667 --> 01:36:42,500
For how long can we fool Mhatre
and the police officers?

1191
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:43,542
Think about it.

1192
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,542
They will realize it someday

1193
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:50,000
and when they do,
we will be in big trouble.

1194
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:50,917
No...

1195
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:54,292
we have to cut them out.
One hundred percent.

1196
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:57,708
If we pay money to someone else,

1197
01:36:57,792 --> 01:37:00,000
isn't that
exactly the same situation as before?

1198
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,542
No.

1199
01:37:04,917 --> 01:37:09,458
Everyone has to pay up money
to somebody or the other.

1200
01:37:10,042 --> 01:37:13,667
Like, toothpaste manufacturers...

1201
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:17,042
They have to pay money
to those who make tubes,

1202
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:22,250
pay to the advertisers and so on.

1203
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:24,375
But the remote control is with them.

1204
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:26,500
Did we have the remote control
with us until now? No.

1205
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:29,208
Laxmi Bomb, whatever you say,

1206
01:37:29,292 --> 01:37:31,375
we will all do exactly that.
Anything for you.

1207
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:32,542
-Sure?
-Sure.

1208
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:34,917
-Will everyone put money in this bag?
-Yes.

1209
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,917
-Yes.
-Very good.

1210
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:39,083
What's up Laxmi Bomb?

1211
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:41,417
So now whose revolution is this?

1212
01:37:42,417 --> 01:37:43,625
Tikli...

1213
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:52,000
How are you?

1214
01:37:58,792 --> 01:37:59,833
Yeah.

1215
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,042
This is our revolution!

1216
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:09,125
Whatever Laxmi says, we do!

1217
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:10,750
-Correct!
-Correct!

1218
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:12,583
She speaks correct.

1219
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:14,583
Come on...

1220
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:19,833
This is our revolution!

1221
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:47,875
There's no point
in coming to work these days.

1222
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:49,292
What?

1223
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:52,792
Business is slow.

1224
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:55,792
Seems like all our customers
have run away.

1225
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:58,958
But the other problem
has been solved, right?

1226
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:04,167
Tikli and Laxmi
must have run away from the city...

1227
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:05,833
They'd forgotten their place
in the order of things,

1228
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:06,750
and they were reminded.

1229
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:08,958
Now they've understood.

1230
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:17,000
Hey Mangatram...

1231
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:20,583
-Why are you laughing?
-Nothing sister, nothing.

1232
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:22,667
Want a tight slap?

1233
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:25,042
I'm laughing for no particular reason.

1234
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:26,708
Are you going to tell me,
or should I take my knife out?

1235
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:30,417
Today I saw Heera Moti...

1236
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:33,833
She had on brand new
Ray Ban sunglasses... a new mobile.

1237
01:39:33,917 --> 01:39:36,458
Can you imagine how much they're making?

1238
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:37,917
You're talking nonsense.

1239
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Okay, supposing, just supposing,
just for a minute.

1240
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,625
They are all working,

1241
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:47,250
but none of them are paying any bribe.

1242
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:50,083
Neither to Mhatre, nor to the police.
Just imagine.

1243
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,500
All they have to do is not work here,
but elsewhere.

1244
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:57,167
So just do the math,
how much money would they be saving,

1245
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,292
and how much would they be earning?

1246
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:06,208
I'm just asking you to imagine...
You're getting upset for nothing.

1247
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:08,750
You're talking nonsense. Idiot.

1248
01:40:08,833 --> 01:40:09,958
Oh leave it.

1249
01:40:10,042 --> 01:40:12,542
-You get upset over such little things.
-Get lost, you dog.

1250
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:13,792
Leave it.

1251
01:40:56,458 --> 01:40:57,333
AURA THE HUB

1252
01:41:51,208 --> 01:41:52,833
Money is power.

1253
01:41:54,542 --> 01:41:56,458
Now we have power.

1254
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:01,125
This has always been men's ploy.

1255
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:03,958
At home, or outside.

1256
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:18,250
One month.

1257
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:19,917
Twenty girls.

1258
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:21,792
Three hundred thousand rupees.

1259
01:42:22,167 --> 01:42:24,917
Hurray to Tikli and Laxmi Bomb!

1260
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:31,292
Hurray to all of us!

1261
01:42:41,417 --> 01:42:42,250
Now?

1262
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:44,917
Now?

1263
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:49,875
Corporator Shinde.

1264
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:32,542
What is this?

1265
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:34,500
Installment.

1266
01:43:42,667 --> 01:43:44,042
Yes, Kripalani. Tell me.

1267
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:45,708
Yes.

1268
01:43:46,708 --> 01:43:47,875
Yes.

1269
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:50,583
Two girls from Malad
are not doing too well.

1270
01:43:50,917 --> 01:43:52,583
We need to replace them.

1271
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:54,542
The girl from Nepal,

1272
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,750
yes ask her to get to work.

1273
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:58,792
Yes.

1274
01:43:58,875 --> 01:44:02,208
Listen, the one from Borivali is pregnant.

1275
01:44:02,292 --> 01:44:03,250
Get it aborted.

1276
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,542
Was it yours?

1277
01:44:06,375 --> 01:44:07,208
No.

1278
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:08,750
So get it cleaned up,

1279
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:10,958
and ask her to get to work.

1280
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:13,667
Auditions are on.

1281
01:44:15,417 --> 01:44:16,292
Yes.

1282
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:19,750
-Okay, fine.
-Sir...

1283
01:44:21,792 --> 01:44:24,375
Sir, sir we have a propo...

1284
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:26,917
That's it, done.

1285
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,417
Anarkali, you're selected.
Come by at night.

1286
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:34,208
And from tomorrow onward,
you work at the bar.

1287
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:36,792
Okay? And Bipasha...

1288
01:44:37,083 --> 01:44:38,375
don't you know how to shimmy?

1289
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:40,875
Get out now.

1290
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:42,083
Let them go.

1291
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:49,750
Sir, we wanted to present you
with a proposal sir.

1292
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,500
You're Laxmi right?

1293
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:55,708
Yes, sir.

1294
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:12,417
Sir, we girls wanted
to give you a proposal.

1295
01:45:14,917 --> 01:45:19,333
We girls want to run our own section.

1296
01:45:22,042 --> 01:45:24,833
We want to run it ourselves.

1297
01:45:32,542 --> 01:45:34,083
-We...
-Try me in that mouth?

1298
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,500
You all are getting me wrong.
I meant this.

1299
01:45:42,083 --> 01:45:43,708
No sir...

1300
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,667
Although mine is more dangerous than this.

1301
01:45:55,375 --> 01:45:57,750
Three months, 600,000 rupees.
If you can manage, then we have a deal.

1302
01:45:57,833 --> 01:45:59,042
Or you may leave.

1303
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:02,917
Okay sir.

1304
01:46:04,667 --> 01:46:06,000
Done.

1305
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:11,500
Now we'll come back
only when we have 600,000 rupees.

1306
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:16,583
But we won't give Mhatre
or the police a single rupee after this.

1307
01:46:16,667 --> 01:46:18,458
Mhatre will cry.

1308
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:22,542
Just like a little girl.
Not a single rupee to him.

1309
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:28,042
Sir, Mhatre gives you three,
we have committed to the double of that.

1310
01:46:30,292 --> 01:46:31,875
We know the numbers.

1311
01:46:32,542 --> 01:46:33,708
We are the ones earning.

1312
01:46:33,792 --> 01:46:35,417
You girls have a lot of gusto...

1313
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:38,625
Agreed.

1314
01:46:42,917 --> 01:46:44,250
Thank you, sir.

1315
01:46:44,875 --> 01:46:46,833
Wait... wait. Something sweet?

1316
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:48,917
You have some.

1317
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:50,042
Take it.

1318
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:51,292
Where are you going?

1319
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:53,125
Run, go get yourself fucked in a hurry.

1320
01:46:54,208 --> 01:46:55,625
Don't forget... Six hundred thousand.

1321
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:01,833
You know he wants to become an MLA.

1322
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:06,708
Move.

1323
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:10,833
He will need money every month.

1324
01:47:13,542 --> 01:47:16,917
Get off and walk properly. Listen to me.

1325
01:47:17,333 --> 01:47:19,750
You nut, listen to me.

1326
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:24,042
He will need money every month.

1327
01:47:24,125 --> 01:47:26,333
So we'll have to do something...

1328
01:47:26,417 --> 01:47:29,833
So all the customers only deal with us.
Are you listening?

1329
01:47:30,792 --> 01:47:35,125
Manda and Mhatre should be left
without any business.

1330
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:36,292
Understood?

1331
01:47:37,792 --> 01:47:40,042
Stop wasting time and think.

1332
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:44,167
Come on.

1333
01:48:29,542 --> 01:48:31,458
How come you thought of me
after so many days?

1334
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:35,000
I felt like it.

1335
01:48:35,458 --> 01:48:36,333
Here take this.

1336
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:39,000
What's this?

1337
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:42,958
-Loyalty program.
-What?

1338
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:45,667
If you buy this, you will save a lot.

1339
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:50,500
Save what?

1340
01:48:51,708 --> 01:48:53,333
How much do you pay for one session?

1341
01:48:53,833 --> 01:48:54,667
Eight hundred rupees right?

1342
01:48:56,292 --> 01:48:58,708
If you buy this,
you need to pay only 600 rupees.

1343
01:48:59,958 --> 01:49:00,958
Seriously?

1344
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:05,500
-Not bad.
-It's absolutely brilliant.

1345
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:12,292
So, how much for the entire box?

1346
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:14,708
Three thousand six hundred rupees.

1347
01:49:15,292 --> 01:49:18,750
And you can use this box
with the rest of the 20 girls too.

1348
01:49:22,167 --> 01:49:24,500
I guess I'll have
to use this scheme soon then.

1349
01:49:37,167 --> 01:49:38,292
No discount?

1350
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,417
Come on, enough drama.

1351
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,333
Come.

1352
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,042
You nut!

1353
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,125
What made you think of this idea?

1354
01:50:05,542 --> 01:50:06,417
What's this?

1355
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:13,542
<i>Terrific job Ustad!</i>

1356
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:17,333
Sir, <i>hail the Taj</i>.

1357
01:50:18,542 --> 01:50:20,375
Keep this. Psycho.

1358
01:50:55,417 --> 01:50:56,542
DHIRAJ REG CUSTOMER

1359
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,875
MONTY REG CUSTOMER

1360
01:51:36,542 --> 01:51:39,833
Customers are finishing
an entire packet at a time.

1361
01:51:41,542 --> 01:51:42,792
Now we have four...

1362
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:45,708
and we need to make another
200,000 in a week.

1363
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:49,250
Laxmi...

1364
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:51,333
-I'm a little worried.
-Why?

1365
01:51:51,792 --> 01:51:56,250
-Many new girls have joined us.
-Yeah, so?

1366
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:58,542
What if Mhatre finds out?
What if he gets suspicious

1367
01:51:58,625 --> 01:52:00,000
and goes snooping around?

1368
01:52:01,708 --> 01:52:04,417
He will find out eventually.
We'll have to do something about it.

1369
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:05,833
Woah!

1370
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:08,042
Great... Isn't it?

1371
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:09,417
Awesome!

1372
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:12,542
Just now there.

1373
01:52:15,167 --> 01:52:16,542
Beaten the watchman.

1374
01:52:16,625 --> 01:52:17,458
What?

1375
01:52:18,417 --> 01:52:20,417
It was only then that he told me

1376
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:22,875
about this bonk-a-bonk in the garden.

1377
01:52:23,917 --> 01:52:24,917
Superb!

1378
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:27,375
If you go against Mhatre...

1379
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:29,667
your game is over.

1380
01:52:30,458 --> 01:52:31,500
Come on!

1381
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,125
The end.

1382
01:52:34,917 --> 01:52:36,000
-Shaari...
-Mhatre...

1383
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:38,333
-Shaari...
-why did you hit watchman uncle?

1384
01:52:39,958 --> 01:52:41,625
Shaari... Shaari...

1385
01:52:41,708 --> 01:52:43,292
Shaari...

1386
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:44,583
Mhatre!

1387
01:52:46,833 --> 01:52:48,375
Shaari!

1388
01:52:51,458 --> 01:52:53,583
Shaari!

1389
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:56,833
Shaari!

1390
01:52:56,917 --> 01:52:58,250
Mhatre!

1391
01:53:13,125 --> 01:53:14,625
Shaari!

1392
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:17,333
What did you do Mhatre...

1393
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:19,833
Shaari!

1394
01:53:20,167 --> 01:53:21,875
Take a good look at the kind
of death she's dying.

1395
01:53:21,958 --> 01:53:23,167
Do you want to die like her?

1396
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:24,208
Do you?

1397
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,750
Then pack up and leave,
go back to your villages.

1398
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:28,667
Now.

1399
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,417
Sir... Sir!

1400
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:33,083
Don't you dare, Manda.

1401
01:53:33,167 --> 01:53:36,333
Anyone who messes with Mhatre
will die like this.

1402
01:53:36,417 --> 01:53:37,292
Bitch.

1403
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:39,292
Sir, please let us take her
to the hospital.

1404
01:53:39,375 --> 01:53:41,750
-She will die, please.
-Let her die.

1405
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:44,917
Her body belonged to Mhatre
while she was alive.

1406
01:53:45,542 --> 01:53:47,125
And her body belongs to Mhatre
when she's dead.

1407
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:51,125
Mhatre will decide what he wants
to do with it. But all of you...

1408
01:53:51,833 --> 01:53:53,208
Final notice.

1409
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:57,542
Today, you leave Mumbai, permanently.

1410
01:53:58,292 --> 01:54:01,667
Laxmi leader,
you better make your gang understand.

1411
01:54:02,417 --> 01:54:05,583
If I see any of them,
they will die exactly like this.

1412
01:54:06,458 --> 01:54:09,333
Go, leave with your gang now.

1413
01:54:09,417 --> 01:54:11,000
Leave.

1414
01:54:11,833 --> 01:54:13,500
Leave...

1415
01:54:22,292 --> 01:54:23,125
Sigh

1416
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:02,250
Make her lie down here.
Let her sleep here.

1417
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:52,833
<i>You'll never be able to buy gold.</i>

1418
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:56,417
<i>You'll live like a dog</i>

1419
01:56:56,958 --> 01:56:59,167
<i>and die like one.</i>

1420
01:57:00,167 --> 01:57:01,167
Diamonds!

1421
01:57:09,833 --> 01:57:10,917
Stand properly.

1422
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,167
Don't you understand?

1423
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:22,917
Sir, we've got the money.

1424
01:57:26,083 --> 01:57:27,875
Money.

1425
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:30,417
Shall I keep it here?

1426
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:34,542
Money...

1427
01:57:43,375 --> 01:57:44,458
Six hundred thousand rupees,
as promised.

1428
01:57:49,958 --> 01:57:51,292
You kept your word.

1429
01:57:53,083 --> 01:57:55,583
Now I will keep mine.

1430
01:57:58,250 --> 01:57:59,917
Enjoy your freedom.

1431
01:58:00,625 --> 01:58:02,292
That street is now yours.

1432
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:06,292
Thank you, sir.

1433
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:09,000
Welcome Laxmi.

1434
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:12,083
Sir!

1435
01:58:40,958 --> 01:58:45,167
Don't touch them.
They are my girls now.

1436
01:58:49,875 --> 01:58:52,458
Sir...

1437
01:59:47,875 --> 01:59:50,750
Sir... I have just one phone.

1438
02:00:01,208 --> 02:00:02,042
Sir.

1439
02:00:02,458 --> 02:00:03,292
<i>Tell me.</i>

1440
02:00:04,458 --> 02:00:07,583
These bitches have destroyed my life.

1441
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:12,500
I have been working for you
for the past 20 years.

1442
02:00:13,042 --> 02:00:16,042
She's giving me double the money,
son of a bitch.

1443
02:00:16,667 --> 02:00:20,458
<i>Double. Have you been able
to give this much till date? Double.</i>

1444
02:00:21,417 --> 02:00:23,417
They don't even
give the police their share.

1445
02:00:23,917 --> 02:00:25,125
<i>Bloody dog...</i>

1446
02:00:25,917 --> 02:00:27,208
That's because I am paying
the police myself.

1447
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:29,250
<i>They take less money from me.</i>

1448
02:00:29,833 --> 02:00:32,583
You should have done the same years ago.
So why didn't you?

1449
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:36,042
<i>You wanted to be a hero, right?</i>

1450
02:00:36,125 --> 02:00:37,250
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1451
02:00:37,708 --> 02:00:39,917
It is me who should be upset with you.

1452
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,333
And that doubles too.

1453
02:00:42,917 --> 02:00:43,750
<i>Keep the phone now.</i>

1454
02:00:50,333 --> 02:00:51,917
Bastard.

1455
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:55,167
Bloody!
Come on, start the auto-rickshaw.

1456
02:00:57,417 --> 02:00:58,625
Start the rickshaw.

1457
02:01:08,875 --> 02:01:10,167
I didn't miss the shot.

1458
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:14,500
-The relationship came in my way...
-What are you murmuring?

1459
02:01:15,292 --> 02:01:16,167
Nothing, sir.

1460
02:01:29,208 --> 02:01:30,167
Enjoy!

1461
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,292
Hey Manda, you will trip and fall!

1462
02:01:34,417 --> 02:01:35,250
Crazy woman...

1463
02:01:36,042 --> 02:01:37,000
Mad!

1464
02:01:43,583 --> 02:01:44,792
Can't believe it right?

1465
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:52,333
Neither can I.

1466
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,917
Come on Lokkhi Bomb...

1467
02:02:00,792 --> 02:02:03,917
Today, let yourself go! Let's party.

1468
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:07,917
Lokkhi Bomb...

1469
02:02:08,708 --> 02:02:10,208
If Shaari were here,

1470
02:02:11,208 --> 02:02:13,292
she would have celebrated this day
with all her might...

1471
02:02:13,875 --> 02:02:14,792
Don't stop.

1472
02:02:43,167 --> 02:02:44,042
Pass it along.

1473
02:02:47,792 --> 02:02:48,625
Long live Laxmi.

1474
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:57,042
Laxmi Bomb...

1475
02:02:57,708 --> 02:02:59,417
Come on... let the music begin..

1476
02:02:59,958 --> 02:03:01,125
What?

1477
02:03:01,542 --> 02:03:04,417
You have to sing any one
of your songs now...

1478
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:07,792
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...

1479
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:10,083
What nonsense!

1480
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,292
Please sing...

1481
02:03:12,375 --> 02:03:13,542
You sing so well...

1482
02:03:14,292 --> 02:03:17,667
Sing one for this little sister
of yours, please..

1483
02:03:20,542 --> 02:03:21,917
Okay... enough drama...

1484
02:03:22,542 --> 02:03:23,375
I'm singing!

1485
02:03:23,708 --> 02:03:24,667
Okay...

1486
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:28,583
One... two... three... Action.

1487
02:03:28,917 --> 02:03:30,792
<i>Mumba Devi</i>

1488
02:03:30,875 --> 02:03:34,167
<i>Please forgive me</i>

1489
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:38,500
<i>I've punished you gravely...</i>

1490
02:03:39,042 --> 02:03:43,000
<i>Dont like to do with anyone.</i>

1491
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:46,000
<i>Mumba Devi</i>

1492
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:49,875
<i>Please forgive me</i>

1493
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:53,917
<i>I've punished you gravely...</i>

1494
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:57,708
<i>Dont like to do with anyone.</i>

1495
02:03:59,125 --> 02:04:00,083
Enough... Done.

1496
02:04:03,333 --> 02:04:06,292
That was Laxmi Malwankar

1497
02:04:06,958 --> 02:04:08,333
Say hi...

1498
02:04:08,417 --> 02:04:09,667
What is this?

1499
02:04:10,625 --> 02:04:14,917
And I am Tikli AKA Putul.

1500
02:04:16,042 --> 02:04:20,167
And this is our gang.

1501
02:04:20,417 --> 02:04:23,792
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...

1502
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:30,542
We have started a revolution against men
on the streets of Mumbai.

1503
02:04:31,208 --> 02:04:34,292
And we built our own system
of sex workers.

1504
02:04:35,583 --> 02:04:38,625
And we have won!

1505
02:04:45,083 --> 02:04:46,458
Even you can do it.

1506
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:49,875
But you have to try...

1507
02:04:51,875 --> 02:04:55,792
If you don't try, nothing will change.

1508
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:01,500
Am I right Laxmi bomb?

1509
02:05:03,042 --> 02:05:05,417
Who are you talking to?

1510
02:05:05,917 --> 02:05:08,083
To whom you are saying this?

1511
02:05:10,208 --> 02:05:12,542
I am talking to all the women
in the world.

1512
02:05:16,292 --> 02:05:17,417
Laxmi Bomb,

1513
02:05:17,792 --> 02:05:19,708
you are very strong.

1514
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,417
But what's the one thing in the world

1515
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:27,583
you are most scared of?

1516
02:05:28,667 --> 02:05:29,500
Most scared.

1517
02:05:29,583 --> 02:05:31,250
Shall I tell you? Lizards!

1518
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:34,667
What rubbish! You're talking nonsense.

1519
02:05:35,625 --> 02:05:38,042
I'm asking you seriously.

1520
02:05:39,458 --> 02:05:41,042
That my songs...

1521
02:05:42,625 --> 02:05:45,625
will die in my notebook.
Nobody will listen to them.

1522
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:47,625
You?

1523
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:51,250
That...

1524
02:05:51,875 --> 02:05:55,708
I will not only die like a dog,
but also live like one.

1525
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:57,833
What do you mean?

1526
02:06:00,375 --> 02:06:02,500
I mean I want to live like a king.

1527
02:06:03,958 --> 02:06:05,167
You mean like a queen.

1528
02:06:08,083 --> 02:06:09,208
No, like a king!

1529
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:17,333
So...

1530
02:06:19,208 --> 02:06:20,875
What's the road ahead?

1531
02:06:23,458 --> 02:06:26,292
There's a new MLA in town.

1532
02:06:26,875 --> 02:06:28,500
Her name is Kiran Singh.

1533
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:32,625
I've heard she cares a lot
for women's issues.

1534
02:06:34,375 --> 02:06:36,375
We should go meet her.

1535
02:06:36,792 --> 02:06:39,000
To evict people like Shinde,

1536
02:06:39,083 --> 02:06:43,375
we need to legalize our work.

1537
02:06:45,958 --> 02:06:47,833
But how to contact her?

1538
02:06:49,208 --> 02:06:51,333
-That's simple.
-What?

1539
02:06:51,958 --> 02:06:54,417
-Give me your phone.
-I don't have her number.

1540
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:57,333
-Not her number.
-So then how will we contact her...

1541
02:06:57,417 --> 02:06:58,500
I'll tell you...

1542
02:06:58,583 --> 02:07:01,292
The other day, I'd downloaded
Facebook on your phone...

1543
02:07:01,375 --> 02:07:03,000
I didn't see it.

1544
02:07:03,083 --> 02:07:05,167
See...

1545
02:07:05,417 --> 02:07:10,708
Now... go to Facebook
and search for Kiran Singh.

1546
02:07:11,667 --> 02:07:12,542
Is she the one?

1547
02:07:13,542 --> 02:07:16,042
Yes she's the one.

1548
02:07:16,125 --> 02:07:17,708
Anything you want to tell her,

1549
02:07:17,792 --> 02:07:20,125
just write it on Facebook.

1550
02:07:20,208 --> 02:07:21,625
Facebook.

1551
02:07:23,708 --> 02:07:27,208
I am saving this on your phone.

1552
02:07:27,667 --> 02:07:30,542
I don't understand this Facebook!

1553
02:07:30,625 --> 02:07:32,875
Now you're a bit high.

1554
02:07:32,958 --> 02:07:35,750
Later when you see it,
you'll understand it.

1555
02:07:35,833 --> 02:07:36,667
Are you mad?

1556
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:38,625
-I don't want to get into this mess.
-Come on now.

1557
02:07:38,708 --> 02:07:41,333
-Let's leave.
-I'll tell you later.

1558
02:07:41,417 --> 02:07:42,250
Okay understood. Come on.

1559
02:07:42,333 --> 02:07:45,708
-Let's leave. Wake her up.
-Tikli and Laxmi Bomb Gang.

1560
02:07:45,792 --> 02:07:47,042
-Come on!
-Let's go.

1561
02:07:47,458 --> 02:07:48,333
Tsamchoe, get up,

1562
02:07:48,417 --> 02:07:50,208
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...

1563
02:07:50,292 --> 02:07:52,125
Take Shaari's phone.

1564
02:07:52,208 --> 02:07:55,458
Get up! Let's move!

1565
02:07:57,083 --> 02:08:01,375
-Get up.
-Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang..

1566
02:08:01,458 --> 02:08:04,042
Come on, get up.

1567
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:08,750
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...

1568
02:09:33,833 --> 02:09:34,750
What have you bought?

1569
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:41,583
Hey Tikli, show me.

1570
02:09:49,292 --> 02:09:50,250
What is this?

1571
02:09:51,792 --> 02:09:53,125
Are you insane?

1572
02:09:55,292 --> 02:09:58,833
You know we've just begun
our business right? We need the money.

1573
02:10:00,292 --> 02:10:03,042
Even you've bought yourself a guitar,
right sister?

1574
02:10:04,292 --> 02:10:05,792
My guitar costs 5000...

1575
02:10:05,875 --> 02:10:08,542
and your chain costs hundreds
of thousands. How is there any comparison?

1576
02:10:10,083 --> 02:10:11,958
I should have never shown this to you.

1577
02:10:12,792 --> 02:10:14,500
I knew this is how you would react.

1578
02:10:16,042 --> 02:10:18,875
I sold my gold to pay Shinde off.

1579
02:10:19,375 --> 02:10:22,125
So now if I buy some gold from
my own money, why is that a problem?

1580
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:24,625
Even I sold the harmonium
which was a family heirloom.

1581
02:10:24,708 --> 02:10:26,000
That's not the point.

1582
02:10:27,875 --> 02:10:29,042
Look Laxmi..

1583
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:31,833
-This is important to me.
-Why?

1584
02:10:31,917 --> 02:10:33,875
Buying this gold...

1585
02:10:33,958 --> 02:10:36,958
you won't understand. It is important.

1586
02:10:39,708 --> 02:10:40,542
Shinde.

1587
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:43,333
Yes, sir.

1588
02:10:46,458 --> 02:10:47,292
What?

1589
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:50,208
Sir...

1590
02:10:51,625 --> 02:10:53,208
how will we?

1591
02:10:54,917 --> 02:10:55,875
Please.

1592
02:11:00,083 --> 02:11:01,333
Okay, sir,

1593
02:11:01,708 --> 02:11:02,583
we will do it.

1594
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:05,208
What happened?

1595
02:11:06,417 --> 02:11:08,625
Seven hundred thousand rupees!

1596
02:11:09,375 --> 02:11:11,333
Shinde wants 700,000 rupees.

1597
02:11:11,417 --> 02:11:12,333
Why?

1598
02:11:12,708 --> 02:11:16,292
He says earlier he used to get money
from both Mhatre and us.

1599
02:11:16,583 --> 02:11:20,042
Now all the girls are with us,
so Mhatre isn't able to pay him anything.

1600
02:11:21,333 --> 02:11:24,667
We'll talk to him about finalizing this
at 700,000...

1601
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:26,458
but we'll have to pay up now.

1602
02:11:33,542 --> 02:11:34,833
How much did this necklace cost?

1603
02:11:36,292 --> 02:11:37,375
How much?

1604
02:11:38,542 --> 02:11:40,292
One hundred fifty thousand rupees.

1605
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:43,583
Tikli! Are you completely
out of your mind?

1606
02:11:45,292 --> 02:11:47,208
Yes, I took a small loan.

1607
02:11:47,292 --> 02:11:50,000
-Loan?
-It's from our money, I'll return it.

1608
02:11:50,583 --> 02:11:53,250
This is not our money.
Tikli... are you mad?

1609
02:11:53,333 --> 02:11:56,167
This money belongs to the girls.
We can't use it for ourselves.

1610
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:00,792
Now we have to give Shinde 700,000
and we have only five.

1611
02:12:01,542 --> 02:12:03,292
The month ends in five days.
How will we manage to make the money?

1612
02:12:03,375 --> 02:12:05,333
Why are you getting so angry?

1613
02:12:05,958 --> 02:12:06,917
We have five days.

1614
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,583
-We'll figure something out.
-What will you figure out?

1615
02:12:09,333 --> 02:12:10,667
I'll talk to Shinde.

1616
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:14,542
-I'll explain the situation to him.
-Tikli, you've fucked us all over, openly.

1617
02:12:15,208 --> 02:12:16,542
Laxmi... Laxmi...

1618
02:12:21,542 --> 02:12:22,667
-Laxmi listen to me..
-Leave me!

1619
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:25,500
-Let me make you understand.
-Leave me!

1620
02:12:25,583 --> 02:12:27,125
What will you make me understand?

1621
02:12:28,375 --> 02:12:31,125
-What do you want to say?
-Two minutes, let me talk.

1622
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:03,958
Laxmi...

1623
02:13:05,333 --> 02:13:06,917
please listen to me once.

1624
02:13:08,125 --> 02:13:09,417
I told you right...

1625
02:13:10,667 --> 02:13:11,917
this is important for me.

1626
02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:18,292
Shinde sir?

1627
02:13:34,458 --> 02:13:36,000
At least read the texts I've sent you.

1628
02:13:37,708 --> 02:13:39,333
I've sent you so many.

1629
02:13:39,792 --> 02:13:41,000
Laxmi, listen...

1630
02:13:44,083 --> 02:13:45,875
My favorite girls.

1631
02:13:48,417 --> 02:13:49,750
-Sir...
-Sir...

1632
02:13:49,833 --> 02:13:52,042
One of the girls
has gotten into an accident.

1633
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:55,792
They've taken her to the hospital.

1634
02:13:57,042 --> 02:13:57,875
So?

1635
02:13:58,667 --> 02:14:02,333
So this month the money is less.

1636
02:14:05,333 --> 02:14:06,250
Less than seven?

1637
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:09,542
Less than six.

1638
02:14:09,625 --> 02:14:11,250
But next month
the girls will make it up...

1639
02:14:11,333 --> 02:14:14,292
Do you think I'm running a charity
for your father here?

1640
02:14:14,833 --> 02:14:17,542
Mhatre has never given me a single rupee
less in 20 years. Do you know that?

1641
02:14:18,042 --> 02:14:20,375
Sir... I said there's been a problem.

1642
02:14:21,292 --> 02:14:23,833
-Why are you dragging my father into this?
-Bloody bitch..

1643
02:14:23,917 --> 02:14:26,875
Your father must have been a motherfucker
to give birth to a whore like you!

1644
02:14:26,958 --> 02:14:28,625
Hold her down!

1645
02:14:29,042 --> 02:14:31,042
What's the matter Laxmi?

1646
02:14:31,208 --> 02:14:33,667
Didn't the police explain this to you?

1647
02:14:34,083 --> 02:14:35,500
Do one thing...

1648
02:14:37,167 --> 02:14:40,875
let me fuck you in the ass
a couple of times.

1649
02:14:41,208 --> 02:14:43,333
And then you can pay me
the rest of the money next month.

1650
02:14:43,417 --> 02:14:46,625
Laxmi... Laxmi... come on...

1651
02:14:49,583 --> 02:14:51,125
-No!
-You are doing wrong

1652
02:14:51,208 --> 02:14:53,125
-Tikli... No!
-Shut your mouth.

1653
02:14:54,292 --> 02:14:55,833
-Please tell her something!
-Shut your mouth.

1654
02:14:55,917 --> 02:14:57,375
Ask him to shut his mouth.

1655
02:14:57,583 --> 02:14:59,375
Shut up, you shut up. Relax.
Leave me. Leave me.

1656
02:15:00,125 --> 02:15:01,833
-Relax.
-Leave him.

1657
02:15:04,583 --> 02:15:05,917
-Leave him.
-Tikli... No!

1658
02:15:07,333 --> 02:15:08,208
Make her understand..

1659
02:15:08,667 --> 02:15:09,708
Laxmi, say something to her..

1660
02:15:09,792 --> 02:15:12,833
-She's my sister.
-Tikli

1661
02:15:13,458 --> 02:15:14,458
My sister...

1662
02:15:15,542 --> 02:15:18,292
If you touch her,
I'll stab you in the ass...

1663
02:15:20,167 --> 02:15:22,958
You won't be able
to sit on your ass all your life.

1664
02:15:24,292 --> 02:15:27,417
Laxmi run!

1665
02:15:28,583 --> 02:15:29,667
Leave him!

1666
02:15:29,958 --> 02:15:30,792
Leave!

1667
02:15:30,958 --> 02:15:31,792
Brother.

1668
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:33,542
Run...

1669
02:15:33,792 --> 02:15:36,667
Kill them! Call Munna!

1670
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:37,958
Kill them!

1671
02:15:40,208 --> 02:15:42,042
Come on...

1672
02:15:45,042 --> 02:15:45,917
Laxmi...

1673
02:15:46,875 --> 02:15:48,583
-Please Listen...
-Give me your phone.

1674
02:15:51,708 --> 02:15:53,542
I'll call Tsamchoe.

1675
02:15:56,625 --> 02:15:57,542
Pick up!

1676
02:15:59,167 --> 02:16:00,417
She's not answering.

1677
02:16:10,708 --> 02:16:12,375
Why is no one answering their phones?

1678
02:16:13,625 --> 02:16:15,250
Let's go to Tsamchoe's house..

1679
02:16:35,917 --> 02:16:36,833
Tsamchoe!

1680
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:38,792
-Tsamchoe!
-Laxmi, run!

1681
02:16:39,625 --> 02:16:40,458
Let's go!

1682
02:16:41,417 --> 02:16:42,250
Run!

1683
02:17:32,917 --> 02:17:33,750
Sister...

1684
02:17:38,042 --> 02:17:38,958
Sister...

1685
02:17:46,042 --> 02:17:47,667
No one's picking up their phones...

1686
02:17:48,833 --> 02:17:51,292
Everyone is...

1687
02:17:52,542 --> 02:17:54,542
We had one chance to change everything.

1688
02:17:54,917 --> 02:17:56,042
One chance!

1689
02:17:56,583 --> 02:17:58,083
And you...

1690
02:17:59,083 --> 02:18:01,667
Shinde was controlling
all the chances we ever got.

1691
02:18:02,125 --> 02:18:05,208
We need to stay in the game to change it.

1692
02:18:05,875 --> 02:18:06,792
How will you understand this?

1693
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:10,417
Your Rampuri knife
thinks more than you do...

1694
02:18:14,708 --> 02:18:16,667
We had made a family.

1695
02:18:17,792 --> 02:18:19,583
Do you even know what a family means?

1696
02:18:30,625 --> 02:18:34,042
My entire family
was wiped out in front of my eyes.

1697
02:18:35,667 --> 02:18:37,667
I know what family means.

1698
02:18:40,958 --> 02:18:41,875
Please forgive me.

1699
02:18:42,542 --> 02:18:43,875
Just leave... Leave.

1700
02:18:45,958 --> 02:18:46,833
Sister..

1701
02:18:47,417 --> 02:18:49,583
-Sister, sorry.
-Go to hell!

1702
02:19:21,625 --> 02:19:22,458
Video...

1703
02:19:26,167 --> 02:19:27,250
Kiran Singh...

1704
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:33,875
-Wait... you bitch...
-Wait!

1705
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:44,208
She's dead, that bitch... Come on...

1706
02:20:12,667 --> 02:20:14,917
<i>Laxmi Didi please forgive me.</i>

1707
02:20:15,625 --> 02:20:17,792
<i>This gold is very important for me.</i>

1708
02:20:18,542 --> 02:20:22,708
<i>You think I'm just 10 days old
in this business.</i>

1709
02:20:23,583 --> 02:20:25,833
<i>But I've been in this
for over two lifetimes.</i>

1710
02:20:27,208 --> 02:20:28,750
<i>My mother was a sex worker</i>

1711
02:20:29,375 --> 02:20:31,875
<i>and I was born into this world.</i>

1712
02:20:33,667 --> 02:20:38,083
<i>My mother's pimp set her on fire one day.</i>

1713
02:20:39,083 --> 02:20:42,542
<i>Somehow I escaped from there...
and he screamed from behind...</i>

1714
02:20:43,375 --> 02:20:46,375
<i>"You will live like a dog
and die like a dog."</i>

1715
02:20:47,042 --> 02:20:48,917
<i>And then finally, look where I ended up...</i>

1716
02:20:49,625 --> 02:20:51,333
<i>in Mumbai's brothel.</i>

1717
02:20:55,125 --> 02:20:58,833
<i>My mother had only one dream...
she wanted to wear a gold necklace.</i>

1718
02:20:59,917 --> 02:21:01,542
<i>Even that wasn't fulfilled.</i>

1719
02:21:02,458 --> 02:21:04,125
<i>That's when I decided</i>

1720
02:21:04,208 --> 02:21:07,667
<i>that I may die like a dog
but I will never live like one.</i>

1721
02:21:08,083 --> 02:21:09,875
<i>If I have to live,
I will live like a king.</i>

1722
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:16,625
<i>And one last thing, sister...</i>

1723
02:21:17,792 --> 02:21:19,542
<i>Monu does not exist.</i>

1724
02:21:20,167 --> 02:21:22,333
<i>I just made him up...</i>

1725
02:21:23,167 --> 02:21:25,875
<i>To be able to feel
like I have some family.</i>

1726
02:21:26,625 --> 02:21:27,833
<i>Everyone in my family is dead.</i>

1727
02:21:28,667 --> 02:21:30,458
<i>Monu is just an alarm.</i>

1728
02:21:31,917 --> 02:21:32,833
<i>An alarm...</i>

1729
02:21:34,375 --> 02:21:36,208
<i>I have only one family member</i>

1730
02:21:37,167 --> 02:21:38,125
<i>and that's you.</i>

1731
02:21:39,792 --> 02:21:40,792
<i>Really.</i>

1732
02:21:42,208 --> 02:21:43,958
<i>Please forgive me sister.</i>

1733
02:22:39,375 --> 02:22:41,958
That was Laxmi Malwankar.

1734
02:22:42,583 --> 02:22:44,000
-Say hi.
-Hi.

1735
02:22:44,083 --> 02:22:45,292
What is this?

1736
02:22:46,292 --> 02:22:50,542
And I am Tikli... AKA Putul...

1737
02:23:05,333 --> 02:23:08,875
<i>Now go to Facebook
and search for Kiran Singh.</i>

1738
02:23:36,792 --> 02:23:38,708
Go tell Shinde.

1739
02:23:41,125 --> 02:23:42,000
Yes sir.

1740
02:23:42,375 --> 02:23:43,208
It's done.

1741
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:47,500
One second. Yes, the job is done .

1742
02:23:47,625 --> 02:23:49,708
I'll come. Yes I'll be there.

1743
02:23:52,958 --> 02:23:55,042
Hi, Raees. How are you?

1744
02:23:55,833 --> 02:23:57,250
Let's meet at the roadside restaurant.

1745
02:23:58,292 --> 02:23:59,625
Will you come? Absolutely.

1746
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:02,208
Yes we'll both be there. Okay hang up now.

1747
02:25:37,958 --> 02:25:39,958
She will be working with you from now on.

1748
02:25:41,667 --> 02:25:44,458
Teach her everything, properly.

1749
02:25:45,375 --> 02:25:46,500
Shweta,

1750
02:25:47,167 --> 02:25:48,667
Bengali bombshell.

1751
02:25:49,292 --> 02:25:51,333
Okay, all the best.

1752
02:25:51,583 --> 02:25:53,042
Come... get your rickshaw started.

1753
02:26:01,333 --> 02:26:02,917
Come on, get ready.

1754
02:26:03,250 --> 02:26:04,708
The cops might come today...

1755
02:26:05,708 --> 02:26:06,625
They will take us to the station.

1756
02:26:06,708 --> 02:26:08,417
It's that time of the month
when they raid the street.

1757
02:26:09,125 --> 02:26:12,792
Don't we bribe them regularly?
Mhatre sir told me about it...

1758
02:26:13,125 --> 02:26:14,792
So why would they take us
to the police station?

1759
02:26:16,417 --> 02:26:18,250
What are you, stupid?

1760
02:26:18,333 --> 02:26:20,875
We bribe them
and they'll still do whatever they fancy.

1761
02:26:21,417 --> 02:26:22,292
That's the way it's always been,
over the ages.

1762
02:26:23,125 --> 02:26:24,583
Just because it's always been,

1763
02:26:25,083 --> 02:26:27,708
doesn't mean that
that's the way it will always be.

1764
02:26:28,292 --> 02:26:29,208
What do you say, sister?

1765
02:26:30,333 --> 02:26:33,625
Did you see Tikli and Lokkhi Bomb's video?

1766
02:26:34,375 --> 02:26:36,042
It's gone viral on the internet.

1767
02:26:36,417 --> 02:26:38,042
And that MP Kiran Singh...

1768
02:26:38,583 --> 02:26:41,750
She has created a huge furor... really!
