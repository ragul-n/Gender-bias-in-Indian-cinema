AA DVD

00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:29,000
See you after college

4
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,193
Who knows who will win
this jackpot

5
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:47,605
Don't be silly

6
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,743
l'm speaking to you

7
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,658
Aren't you ashamed of
teasing girls like this?

8
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:21,154
What do you mean

9
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:22,029
Don't act

10
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,944
This flower is the proof
of your mischief

11
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,563
What do you want to say

12
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:33,976
ln future if you throw
flowers you'll get stones

13
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,427
l don't have the time or habit
to throw flowers at girls

14
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:42,926
There are many fools
in the college

15
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,004
Go try them

16
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:48,544
l'll complain to the principal
about you

17
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,250
My name is Bhatnagar
MSC Final

18
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,372
You can also tell him
l slapped you

19
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:57,118
Will you slap me?

20
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,784
Of course, you are
disturbing my studies

21
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:05,402
Go away or l'll hit you

22
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,601
So it's you

23
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,390
You let the most beautiful

24
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,514
and richest girl in
college go

25
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:22,384
So you were being naughty

26
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:24,925
l threw flower at her
worshipped her

27
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:28,130
You should have worshipped
openly

28
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,626
Why did you trap me ?

29
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:33,666
Because l don't stand
a chance with you

30
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:36,204
You are the college hero

31
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,369
You are top in studies
and sports

32
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:41,574
But there is one thing
missing

33
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,530
You don't trap anyone and
don't trap yourself

34
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:47,068
l don't like such jokes

35
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:49,400
College may be a play
ground for you

36
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,522
lt is the foundation of life
for me

37
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:55,478
You are angry unnecessarily

38
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,668
What's the idiot written
in this

39
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,204
l'm talking of that idiot
Kamal

40
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:18,413
Forget him

41
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,199
l can never forget him

42
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,154
What are you saying ?

43
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,942
You are very lucky

44
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:32,731
lt's no ordinary thing to
talk with Kamal

45
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,895
He doesn't even look at girls

46
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,643
One day he'll look at
my shoes

47
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,015
He may be a hero

48
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,430
But l'll teach him a lesson

49
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,594
l'm changing your name
right now

50
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,635
Mrs Sunita Bhatnagar

51
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,534
She is a Miss

52
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:08,362
l'll take time to be Mrs

53
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:23,347
The electricity is cut off
again

54
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:26,219
We'll complain to the
superintendent

55
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,133
The fatso is here

56
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:30,756
The light went off again

57
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:32,921
Why don't you do something ?

58
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:34,961
What should l do

59
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,917
l've complained several
times

60
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,748
We are afraid to stay
in darkness

61
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,830
We can neither write or
read

62
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,612
Light a candle in every
room

63
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:54,608
Tonight make do with a
candle

64
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,397
Tomorrow we'll speak to the
principal

65
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,850
Make do with a candle

66
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:14,921
lf today l say

67
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:18,250
This flower is proof of your
mischief ?

68
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:20,248
You have come till here

69
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,747
How dare you enter the
girls' hostel?

70
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,620
Misunderstood again

71
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,993
l'm not chasing you, you
are not worth it

72
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,614
l've come here with the
permission-

73
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:35,067
- of the principal

74
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:42,019
The man who threw flowers
at you is Suresh

75
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:48,845
Who is this Suresh ?

76
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:51,134
The romeo of our college

77
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:53,215
He always teases girls

78
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,505
That means l was mistaken

79
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:56,880
Of course

80
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,751
Did you find anything ?

81
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:01,082
l've found loose wires

82
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,289
That's why there are sparks

83
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,077
Did you find anything ?

84
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,531
We'll have to change your
line

85
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,571
l mean we'll have to
change the wiring -

86
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,777
- all through to the room

87
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:20,231
You go bring the wires

88
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:31,844
l'm finished, l'm ruined

89
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:34,174
What enmity did you
have with me ?

90
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,798
What happened ?

91
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,671
My Lallu is under your car

92
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:43,124
And your car is on top
of my Lallu

93
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,246
My dear Cock is killed

94
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:52,281
You are shouting for the
sake of a cock ?

95
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:54,821
You are calling it ordinary

96
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:58,484
40 of my hens have
become widows

97
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,727
What is it you want

98
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,225
Give him back his life

99
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,139
l cannot do that

100
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,178
You can take, you must
also give

101
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,675
Or l'll see you in court

102
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:18,463
There is no 302 in case
of animals

103
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,253
Take out 100 from it

104
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,542
Take it 202. Come on
give it

105
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:26,664
As if father has come

106
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,496
Be ashamed

107
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:32,282
You take the money

108
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,322
Why didn't you tell me before

109
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,655
That you're the captain
of the cricket team ?

110
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:46,228
Go and take the cock with you

111
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,763
But this time l've brought
the full amount

112
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,219
125 rupees and pack it

113
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,468
lt's 17 5 rupees this time

114
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,838
Tax increases in one night

115
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:02,878
You talk of 15 days

116
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:09,330
Keep it and pay me later

117
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:24,399
He's jealous

118
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,436
Don't waste time
someone will come

119
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:35,262
Yes. Your master. What
were you doing ?

120
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:37,968
l had seen a movie

121
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,338
You are always thinking
of films

122
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,420
Did you bring my clothes
from the laundry

123
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:45,834
Did you wash my pants
and check the pockets?

124
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:47,374
There was a handkerchief
l washes it as well

125
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:52,162
Here is one rupee

126
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,159
Keep this coin

127
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,115
l will see a movie

128
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,154
Rascal. Bring a hot cup of
tea

129
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:04,650
l'll just bring it

130
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:13,183
One man had come

131
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:37,990
Why did you send this ?

132
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,614
Because you needed it

133
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:43,694
How did you know ?

134
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:47,064
l was in the shop when
you were buying it

135
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:49,522
But you didn't see me

136
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,684
Why are you making
fun of me

137
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:57,804
By doing me this favour

138
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:58,346
l heard

139
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,967
You are the daughter
of a rich father

140
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:03,173
Do you have a habit
of buying -

141
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:04,589
- people's helplessness ?

142
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,169
You've misunderstood me

143
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,208
l treated you badly twice
before

144
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,456
l wanted to beg pardon
but didn't dare

145
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:19,866
l wanted to give you
something to please you

146
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,276
But didn't know l'll have
to hear so many taunts

147
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:31,396
l didn't mean to hurt you

148
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,425
No, you really mean it

149
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,591
lf you really don't want
to hurt me -

150
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,334
- then accept my gift

151
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,413
There are some things
a man -

152
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,744
- can never forget

153
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,742
This is one of them

154
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:03,447
lt will be an obligation
upon me

155
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:05,818
l had to take a ticket

156
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,568
For what movie ?

157
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:09,274
Not movie, but train

158
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,523
Father wrote that there is
trouble about the land

159
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,227
Which village is that ?

160
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,558
Chandanpur. You may
have heard of it

161
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,846
lt's a 3 hour journey
by train

162
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:21,886
And 2 hours 30 minutes
by bus

163
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:24,050
So it must be about 200
miles away

164
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:26,632
lt might be more than that

165
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,172
lf the train is late

166
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:29,504
The bus leaves

167
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,544
Then one has to wait 2 hours
30 minutes

168
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:34,332
What's the use of
wasting time

169
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,037
lf l take you in 3 hours -

170
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:40,119
- by car. And listen before
you refuse

171
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,406
l've seen every big city
in lndia

172
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:49,194
l would like to see a
village

173
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:54,521
lt's an excuse for another
favour

174
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:59,558
l'm very fond of touring
villages

175
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:17,373
Why doesn't it start ?

176
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,786
No. The tank is full

177
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:25,116
Something else must be
wrong

178
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,811
l found the defect

179
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,892
The stone pierced the tank

180
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:41,307
What will happen now ?

181
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,596
Close up the car and
we'll walk

182
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:45,635
Walk ? How Long ?

183
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:48,008
Six to eight miles

184
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,755
lt may be ten

185
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:53,212
lt's a question of the machine

186
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,418
You wait in the car. Close
the windows

187
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:57,749
l'll arrange for fuel and
a mechanic

188
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:12,235
Don't go leaving me

189
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:14,649
You are a coward

190
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:54,774
Take, wipe your head

191
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:57,106
Why is there a ''G''

192
00:16:57,107 --> 00:17:01,559
lt should have been an ''S''
l didn't notice

193
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,849
You have sharp eyes

194
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,223
O.K. l'll take the G for God

195
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:22,039
The rain is increasing

196
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,162
You weren't scared this
time

197
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:30,531
l wasn't alone this time

198
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:40,521
l was frightened that time

199
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,392
But l know ''App'' means
distance

200
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,920
Which is better

201
00:17:57,921 --> 00:18:01,209
Distance or closeness

202
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,663
What do you want ?

203
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,287
You cannot give me what
l want

204
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:15,861
Should l tell you the truth

205
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:20,108
A hot cup of tea

206
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,178
Drink it

207
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:40,670
Why don't you drink ?

208
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,579
Go ask the lawyer

209
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,700
The date of the law suit

210
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:46,312
May you live long

211
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:48,226
You were to come
yesterday

212
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:52,597
The car broke down on
the way

213
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:54,386
Who is she?

214
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:59,508
Sunita, my class mate

215
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:06,251
So she came along with me

216
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:12,036
You are shouting as if

217
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:14,076
Dhondu has gone to
Kathmandu

218
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:20,694
Where is he ?

219
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,817
l am as l was

220
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:25,981
But you've become two

221
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,437
She is our guest. Hurry up
and take the luggage

222
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:42,007
ls Sunita in your class ?

223
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:46,003
No. She's in her first year
Very junior to me

224
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,911
We study in the same
college

225
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:56,118
l thought it was something
else

226
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:59,197
That you liked her and
brought her to show me

227
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:00,904
There is nothing like that

228
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:03,818
But the girl is very nice

229
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:06,148
l want a daughter-in-law
like her

230
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:08,604
Then forget Sunita

231
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:10,769
She is the daughter of
a millionaire

232
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,642
ln marriage a family comes -

233
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,390
- before money

234
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:16,304
He may be a millionaire

235
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:18,511
But he only wants his
daughter

236
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,009
To have a good husband

237
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,423
Whose marriage are you
discussing ?

238
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:25,171
l was telling Kamal

239
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:28,417
The sooner one gets
married, the better

240
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:32,996
After your studies

241
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:35,953
Your father too will be
worried about this

242
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,894
What are you thinking of ?

243
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,184
l've come to the village
for the first time

244
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:59,511
l wish to stay here forever

245
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:01,967
You haven't seen
anything yet

246
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:04,091
Our village is a little heaven

247
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,795
ln the morning when the
sun rises

248
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:13,707
Behind the hill, across
the river

249
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,579
Where are you going -

250
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,661
- all alone ?

251
00:26:26,662 --> 00:26:28,617
She wants to go to Bombay

252
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:30,573
Stay for a few more days

253
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:32,446
She has to take her car
on the way

254
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,528
Then reach college in time

255
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,985
Or her studies will suffer

256
00:26:35,986 --> 00:26:37,650
But you must come again

257
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:40,814
ls there anything special

258
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:45,933
Between us, l don't know
why

259
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,789
The girl became so close
in one meeting -

260
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,445
- your letter is finished

261
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:18,484
But it won't reach there

262
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:21,106
A 5 paisa stamp is not
available

263
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,270
Have you got it ?

264
00:27:23,271 --> 00:27:28,224
l have to post this letter
by morning

265
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:31,096
Where will l get a stamp ?

266
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:33,427
Gita's writing table is like -

267
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:36,758
- a post office

268
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,922
She writes letters to
Dharmender all night

269
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:51,494
Mr. Kamal Bhatanagar

270
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:55,364
You must meet Guruvar
Sahib

271
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:00,276
You must ask about his health

272
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,840
Sunita's letter has come

273
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,420
But she has written this -

274
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:24,626
- to her own father -

275
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:26,915
- whose address is on the
envelope

276
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:28,955
The address is mine

277
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:31,536
lt means the letters have
been mixed up

278
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:36,197
The letter to you must
have gone to her father

279
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:37,946
lt's all useless

280
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:39,528
Nothing worth reading

281
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:44,940
Let me see it

282
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,020
Dear Daddy, Today l've
a special thing

283
00:28:56,012 --> 00:29:00,298
l met his father too
a very good man

284
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,631
l'm sure you both will like
Kamal

285
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:08,040
You said this was useless

286
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,497
A daughter-in-law like
the moon -

287
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:15,033
- will come to my house

288
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:17,533
What are you staring at ?

289
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,361
We'll white wash the
whole house

290
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:23,484
And put curtains on doors
and windows

291
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,773
Also repair and polish
the chairs

292
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:27,563
ls a minister coming to
this house

293
00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:32,933
Not a minister, but a
daughter-in-law

294
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,424
May l say something ?

295
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:43,797
You are making a castle
in the air

296
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,460
This letter didn't reach
her father

297
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:50,540
But the letter which has
gone to her father

298
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,705
That will bear fruit

299
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,525
Daddy, you sent a cable

300
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:10,438
''Come at once.'' So l came

301
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:13,850
Don't talk to him

302
00:30:13,851 --> 00:30:15,931
You have been brought here

303
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:18,095
So that when he sees a young
daughter -

304
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:20,594
- he might feel ashamed

305
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:23,050
lt's my misfortune after
25 years -

306
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:29,627
- of marriage l know your
father

307
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,623
What happened ?

308
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,704
At this age, your father
got a love letter

309
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:42,071
lt's good the letter came
to me

310
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:44,237
Or he would have fooled
me all his life

311
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:49,731
lt cannot be so

312
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:51,854
Then read it yourself

313
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,346
What is all this

314
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:21,658
So the boy's name is
Kamal

315
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:26,570
The name is nice

316
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:28,858
What do you think ?

317
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:31,523
l knew this matter will make
you laugh

318
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:33,354
What are you saying ?

319
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:36,891
We have only one daughter

320
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,848
We always wanted her to
be happy

321
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:44,634
And what she has written
in her love letter

322
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:47,006
l did not know that this letter
has come here

323
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:50,129
The letter l wrote to you

324
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,335
You must have written
that there

325
00:31:52,336 --> 00:31:54,708
ls a boy in college whom
you like very much

326
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:01,951
And you want to marry him

327
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:10,899
You told me you will
explain to her

328
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,645
What is there to explain ?

329
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:18,184
Our daughter is educated

330
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:20,516
She knows good and bad

331
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,929
lf l say something

332
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,343
What do you want to say

333
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:30,005
You chose this boy and
he must be good

334
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:32,338
l and your mother are
worried

335
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:37,665
You have never been
wanting anything

336
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,079
You have everything

337
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:47,447
One or two thousand is
your monthly expenditure

338
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,153
lf you married me to a
millionaire -

339
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,023
- who would be poor after
marriage

340
00:32:54,024 --> 00:32:56,064
The matter is closed

341
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:59,558
When l married l was
not a millionaire

342
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,847
One should have love

343
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,421
They are farmers
and l met them

344
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:22,620
Now we will meet him

345
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,377
When did you come ?

346
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:49,626
You were busy playing

347
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:53,330
So l sat quietly

348
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:58,243
Man must do something

349
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,656
But what brings you here

350
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:04,736
You arranged for a job
in your company

351
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,567
That is fixed

352
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:08,732
But accommodation is given
after one year -

353
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,354
- of service

354
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:12,520
But you are alone. Stay
with me

355
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:15,266
There is a small problem

356
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:17,431
l'm getting married

357
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,472
What ? Congratulations

358
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:22,842
Therefore l need a house

359
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:27,672
The house in front is empty

360
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,373
l want your company

361
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:38,285
l'll get a good friend and a
good neighbour

362
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:40,533
Come. l'll show you the
house

363
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,905
The key is with Kanhaiya
Lala

364
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:44,903
The foreman in our
company

365
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:50,398
l'll introduce you to him. He
also lives here

366
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,308
l'm your father

367
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:03,802
See what l do

368
00:40:22,492 --> 00:40:27,361
Who is it ?

369
00:40:35,312 --> 00:40:37,267
This is Kamal

370
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,975
Now he works in our
company

371
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:43,929
He'll live in the bungalow

372
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:46,592
The sun hasn't set yet

373
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,631
And you began drinking ?

374
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:50,296
What else can l do ?

375
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:53,460
lt's Sunday. l don't know
when the sun rises

376
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:56,581
That means you've been
drinking since morning

377
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:58,955
Morning or night

378
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:03,909
This is life

379
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:09,777
O.K. You enjoy yourself
Where is the key ?

380
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:12,274
She has gone out

381
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:14,189
l meant the key of the house

382
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,059
l thought you meant my key

383
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,194
You should have cabled

384
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:53,608
l would have come to the station

385
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:55,856
lt would have just been an
inconvenience

386
00:41:55,857 --> 00:41:58,769
This is Mohan

387
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,810
The house and the job
thanks to him

388
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:08,593
lf you need anything

389
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:11,382
Telephone for you

390
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:16,670
There must be an urgent
call

391
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,664
lt's said the lock of a
new house -

392
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:27,990
- should be opened by the
wife

393
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:29,697
What is the matter ?

394
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:31,986
Master has brought a
new wife

395
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:34,276
Another one trapped

396
00:42:34,277 --> 00:42:39,188
Aren't we also a handsome
couple ?

397
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,682
l've told you not to drink
so much

398
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:49,762
But you just won't listen

399
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:52,365
Your heart is beating
so fast

400
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:58,274
Mine or yours ?

401
00:43:58,275 --> 00:44:00,232
Both

402
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,900
What is the matter

403
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:43,396
Do you remember the time
you married

404
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:45,644
l'm cursing the day in
which

405
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:49,348
So many years have passed
since then

406
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:51,555
We couldn't become parents

407
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:53,303
Come on get up

408
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:55,552
l'll tell you just now. Get up

409
00:44:58,424 --> 00:45:01,836
l'm up. Now tell me

410
00:45:01,837 --> 00:45:05,041
When l was coming back
l saw

411
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:07,080
What did you see

412
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,455
The master who is newly
married

413
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:13,824
What were they doing ?

414
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:17,779
He and his wife

415
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:20,359
To his wife

416
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,232
l won't tell

417
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:24,565
He caught his wife like this

418
00:45:26,187 --> 00:45:29,684
Then what happened ?

419
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,348
l'll go ask him

420
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:32,723
Where are you going ?

421
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:35,219
ls this a thing to ask
about ?

422
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,174
Ask your heart

423
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:42,337
My heart is saying -

424
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:47,666
- a child will soon come
to this house

425
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:54,033
Won't you drink any
more today ?

426
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:56,157
l feel like drinking you

427
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:17,302
See, someone is outside

428
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:19,342
Who's this so early in
the morning

429
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:24,588
ls Kamal there ?

430
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:27,627
Go tell him l'm not well

431
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:31,330
l have a headache, say
something

432
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,870
How can l go like this ?

433
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:34,578
Go on

434
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:46,523
Has Kamal got up yet ?

435
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:48,605
Yes, but he's lying down

436
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:50,353
He's got up but still
lying down ?

437
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:51,809
He's got a headache

438
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:56,722
Does he have fever ? Let me see

439
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:00,925
Not feeling well

440
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:02,840
l have a severe headache

441
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:05,004
l'll have some medicine
and be alright

442
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:07,128
Why not see a doctor ?

443
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,082
You have to go to the office
on Monday

444
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,039
Yes, l have to

445
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,621
The Company doctor lives
here. l'll fetch him

446
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:16,660
l'm dying

447
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:19,781
lf the doctor comes then

448
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:22,446
You made the excuse
now you suffer

449
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:24,528
Doctor will give you
an injection

450
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:28,897
You will wait for him, l'll
bring tea

451
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:33,851
Will he give me a big
injection ?

452
00:47:49,877 --> 00:47:53,123
Where is the patient ?

453
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:54,498
He is here

454
00:48:05,112 --> 00:48:08,025
Sit down. l understand
your problem

455
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:22,052
Did you drink last night ?

456
00:48:22,053 --> 00:48:27,090
No. l don't drink

457
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:31,626
How is the pain ?

458
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:35,871
Blood pressure is low

459
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,495
Are you a doctor for dogs ?

460
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:39,743
Not at all

461
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:46,237
What is it, Doctor

462
00:48:46,238 --> 00:48:51,607
Everything normal

463
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,140
Bring it this side

464
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:12,584
What disease do l have ?

465
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:16,374
l'll tell you

466
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:19,786
lt's too bad to go to
extremes

467
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:21,285
When did get you married ?

468
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:24,614
Seven days ago

469
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:28,070
What do you want to say ?

470
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:30,068
For your health, eat 3 days -

471
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:33,647
- and fast 3 days

472
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:35,063
What do you mean ?

473
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:38,934
Living with your wife, you've
to be reasonable

474
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,350
How can this be ?

475
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,679
Very simple. There are 6
days in a week

476
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,092
Thursday, Friday and
Saturday

477
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:49,589
For your enjoyment

478
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,671
The rest you'll have to
fast

479
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:55,875
You forgot Sunday

480
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:57,249
That is a holiday

481
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,746
Complete rest

482
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,827
Remember my advice

483
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,057
How are you ?

484
00:50:22,058 --> 00:50:26,845
ldiot. He gave me a big
injection

485
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:32,923
Do you know what he said ?

486
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,492
Today is Saturday. My life is
made

487
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:46,367
What is this madness ?
Let me go

488
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:51,196
The doctor told me

489
00:50:57,522 --> 00:51:01,475
Has my wife left the key
with you ?

490
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:02,975
Are you going out ?

491
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,847
As it's a holiday, let's have
our meal out

492
00:51:05,848 --> 00:51:07,553
What will you do at home
the whole day ?

493
00:51:07,554 --> 00:51:09,759
Come with us

494
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,549
l would have come but l -

495
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:16,961
- have to go to a meeting in
my club

496
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,246
What happened ?

497
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,244
The programme was
for us only

498
00:51:26,245 --> 00:51:27,658
Why did you invite Mohan ?

499
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:30,073
We wouldn't have been
disturbed

500
00:51:30,074 --> 00:51:31,862
He didn't have the key
to his house

501
00:51:31,863 --> 00:51:33,485
So l called him

502
00:51:33,486 --> 00:51:35,401
But l don't like it

503
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:37,607
l won't do such a thing again

504
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:49,096
Please bring 2 ice creams

505
00:51:49,097 --> 00:51:50,718
And have one yourself

506
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:52,134
We'll sit here

507
00:51:52,135 --> 00:51:54,798
What will you do here ?

508
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:56,880
Don't you remember what the
doctor said ?

509
00:51:58,795 --> 00:52:01,457
Today is Sunday

510
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:06,579
Then the ice cream is
cancelled

511
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:41,404
Aren't you going to the office ?

512
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:43,319
lt's still early

513
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,484
Why are you bothering my
sleep ?

514
00:55:45,485 --> 00:55:47,898
l was dozing off, you played
the sitar

515
00:55:47,899 --> 00:55:52,268
l'll throw it out one day

516
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:56,264
l have only one sitar left

517
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,262
Let it remain mine

518
00:55:58,263 --> 00:55:59,802
lf the sitar is yours -

519
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:01,551
- why did you marry me ?

520
00:56:01,552 --> 00:56:04,173
You are angry in the
morning

521
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:09,335
You sleep, l'm going to the
office

522
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:16,619
l'm your wife just by name

523
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,699
Why don't you divorce me ?

524
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,404
For fear of being disgraced

525
00:56:23,405 --> 00:56:25,777
You have everything here

526
00:56:26,694 --> 00:56:30,188
Even as a wife you have
complete freedom

527
00:56:30,189 --> 00:56:32,145
lf you keep away from me

528
00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:35,350
l have a right to amuse
myself

529
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,682
For amusing yourself you
have -

530
00:56:37,683 --> 00:56:40,928
- disgraced yourself before
marriage

531
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,009
That's why your father did
not -

532
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:45,007
- find any boy except me

533
00:56:45,008 --> 00:56:47,130
What is this nonsense

534
00:56:47,131 --> 00:56:48,920
Your father would have been
ruined

535
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:51,002
lf my father had not helped

536
00:56:51,003 --> 00:56:53,083
lf he has only bargained

537
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:55,289
To save me father l had to
marry you

538
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,452
But you are like a
disease -

539
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:06,278
- with which a man can neither
live or die

540
00:57:12,814 --> 00:57:13,938
How is it

541
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:20,347
ln the morning when a wife -

542
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:22,136
- makes breakfast for her
husband

543
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:24,093
lt's a happy life, good wife

544
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:26,008
What else can one want ?

545
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,130
How is Mohan's wife ?

546
00:57:28,131 --> 00:57:31,669
Very bad temper

547
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:36,623
l just went to the garden

548
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:38,662
Absolutely lost in himself

549
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,660
She came and started
shouting at him

550
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:42,574
lt is one's fate

551
00:57:42,575 --> 00:57:45,280
Mohan is a nice man

552
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:47,569
Seeing him playing the sitar

553
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,567
l think he has an artistic
mind

554
00:57:49,568 --> 00:57:51,441
The wife of such a man

555
00:57:51,442 --> 00:57:54,104
Should be lovely and
cheerful

556
00:57:54,105 --> 00:57:55,853
ln the days of our
honeymoon

557
00:57:55,854 --> 00:57:58,600
Where did this Mohan
come in ?

558
00:57:58,601 --> 00:57:59,767
Bring tea

559
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:01,931
You'll get tea in the morning

560
00:58:01,932 --> 00:58:03,512
Milk with breakfast

561
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,011
Children drink milk

562
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:09,089
You are as naughty as
children

563
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,379
Why ? What did l do ?

564
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,544
You tease me a lot. Come
on, drink it

565
00:58:14,252 --> 00:58:15,666
l won't drink it

566
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,290
Will you drink it or not ?

567
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:20,745
l will, but not like this

568
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:23,035
Then how will you drink ?

569
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:27,114
The way a baby drinks
from a bottle

570
00:58:43,764 --> 00:58:44,805
Let me go

571
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:50,174
You can only think of
one thing

572
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:04,534
Some car has come

573
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:06,699
l have asked for it

574
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,613
lt will be with us the
whole day

575
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:10,528
We'll roam from morning
to evening

576
00:59:10,529 --> 00:59:13,608
Hurry and get dressed

577
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:18,480
l'll hit you

578
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:36,295
You are looking lovely

579
00:59:38,626 --> 00:59:39,583
Really

580
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,663
Do you know what l want ?

581
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:44,661
l want to hide you in
my eyes

582
00:59:44,662 --> 00:59:48,448
And close the lids

583
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:52,070
So no one else can see you

584
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:54,777
lf someone snatched you
away, then

585
00:59:56,441 --> 01:00:00,605
lt won't be so

586
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,381
Where did this cigarette
come from?

587
01:00:14,382 --> 01:00:18,418
You have left it

588
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:21,998
Some came and went quietly

589
01:00:21,999 --> 01:00:24,039
Keep this door and the
back door closed

590
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:34,985
What did you ask God for ?

591
01:00:34,986 --> 01:00:36,443
A daughter

592
01:00:37,651 --> 01:00:39,439
Why didn't you ask for
a son?

593
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,395
Sons are all rascals

594
01:00:41,396 --> 01:00:45,391
lt means you too

595
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,640
A son forgets his parents
when he grows up

596
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:53,009
But a daughter also
loves and remembers

597
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,868
May your prayers come true

598
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:11,824
Today is Shivatri

599
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:16,819
Take the offering

600
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:47,137
lt's time to go

601
01:07:47,138 --> 01:07:52,174
Slavery begins this day

602
01:07:53,505 --> 01:07:55,795
Have some sweets and go

603
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:05,867
What happened

604
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:07,782
l forgot something important

605
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:12,528
What is that

606
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:14,317
Shall l bring betal leaves ?

607
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:16,191
Didn't you understand ?

608
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,606
Go away

609
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:19,937
You've become very naughty

610
01:08:19,938 --> 01:08:24,932
You are very stubborn

611
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:05,557
ls Mohan's set ready

612
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:10,470
lt will take 10 minutes

613
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,090
Rascal, what are you doing
here ?

614
01:09:15,091 --> 01:09:16,546
l work in the sales
department

615
01:09:16,547 --> 01:09:17,962
Since 6 months

616
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:22,666
l joined it just now

617
01:09:24,372 --> 01:09:27,452
l'm very angry with you and
Sunita

618
01:09:27,453 --> 01:09:30,241
You both forgot your college
friend

619
01:09:30,242 --> 01:09:31,615
You got married but didn't
inform me

620
01:09:31,616 --> 01:09:33,696
We got married in a hurry

621
01:09:33,697 --> 01:09:35,486
And l didn't have your
address

622
01:09:35,487 --> 01:09:37,027
But now l know everything

623
01:09:37,028 --> 01:09:38,691
You cannot escape

624
01:09:38,692 --> 01:09:40,355
When are you giving a party ?

625
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:41,938
On this Sunday

626
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:43,561
O.K. Come on Sunday

627
01:09:43,562 --> 01:09:45,434
What do you mean

628
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:49,513
You must call the whole staff

629
01:09:49,514 --> 01:09:52,013
Are you all free on Sunday
evening ?

630
01:09:53,053 --> 01:09:55,134
Mr. Kamal is giving a
party

631
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,623
Tea and soft drinks won't do

632
01:10:04,624 --> 01:10:09,536
You must serve whisky

633
01:10:14,531 --> 01:10:16,820
Where will l get whisky
from ?

634
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:21,815
Don't worry. l'll bring it

635
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,599
lt's all pure orange

636
01:10:31,472 --> 01:10:34,802
lt's Black and White

637
01:10:34,803 --> 01:10:39,672
Give me some from the
White

638
01:10:39,965 --> 01:10:45,126
Don't mention the name of the
wine

639
01:10:51,036 --> 01:10:53,408
What do you want? White or
black ?

640
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:55,990
Neither. l'm just looking at
your moustache

641
01:11:01,275 --> 01:11:03,398
Do you like it very much ?

642
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:08,602
Yes. l like it very much

643
01:11:09,643 --> 01:11:14,261
Come here. Take it

644
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:16,386
Keep it safely

645
01:11:38,947 --> 01:11:42,068
What do you mean ?

646
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:44,066
You are afraid of
your wife

647
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,938
Please give him permission
to drink

648
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:51,725
Or the whole party will
be spoiled

649
01:11:51,726 --> 01:11:55,471
When they want you, you may -

650
01:11:55,472 --> 01:11:58,135
- forget them. What do
you say ?

651
01:11:58,136 --> 01:11:59,384
Drink

652
01:12:17,742 --> 01:12:20,030
No need for formalities

653
01:12:20,031 --> 01:12:21,986
lt's just a small gift

654
01:12:21,987 --> 01:12:24,026
One doesn't always get
the chance

655
01:12:24,027 --> 01:12:26,065
To present gifts

656
01:12:26,066 --> 01:12:27,980
You are right

657
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:30,187
Take your sitar and let
us listen -

658
01:12:30,936 --> 01:12:34,806
- to something beautiful

659
01:12:34,807 --> 01:12:37,179
But l only play the sitar

660
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,677
Who will sing ?

661
01:12:39,678 --> 01:12:42,257
l'll arrange for that

662
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:44,172
We only have to request
sister-in-law

663
01:12:44,173 --> 01:12:45,837
No. l cannot sing

664
01:12:45,838 --> 01:12:47,544
Don't refuse

665
01:12:47,545 --> 01:12:51,331
l'm telling the truth. l've
left singing

666
01:12:51,332 --> 01:12:55,327
When everyone asks
then sing

667
01:12:55,328 --> 01:12:57,367
Sing for me

668
01:12:57,368 --> 01:13:01,530
l'm telling you, l'm not in the
mood

669
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:06,567
For my sake

670
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,646
Music is the gift of God

671
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:12,977
lt is to give to others

672
01:13:12,978 --> 01:13:15,141
l will not request from you

673
01:13:15,142 --> 01:13:17,348
lf there is magic in the
tune of my sitar -

674
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:21,802
- you will definitely sing

675
01:17:24,392 --> 01:17:28,887
Stop it. People will laugh

676
01:17:28,888 --> 01:17:31,676
People are applauding
my Sunita

677
01:17:31,677 --> 01:17:33,424
Why shouldn't l ?

678
01:17:33,425 --> 01:17:38,836
What is this ?

679
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:41,501
Suresh, don't go. Let's have
a drink

680
01:18:15,592 --> 01:18:20,835
What was the need to
drink so much ?

681
01:18:21,544 --> 01:18:23,791
Shall l tell you ?

682
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:27,995
l was lonely in the party

683
01:18:27,996 --> 01:18:30,117
You were lost in the song

684
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:32,615
People were lost in listening

685
01:18:32,616 --> 01:18:35,363
Sitting far away l was
watching people

686
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:40,024
Who were watching you

687
01:18:40,025 --> 01:18:42,189
Don't ever touch whisky
again

688
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:02,627
How is your prevailing
mood ?

689
01:19:02,628 --> 01:19:04,000
Today you have come early

690
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:05,790
The time is over

691
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:10,785
Then your watch is wrong

692
01:19:13,283 --> 01:19:15,407
Who knows right and wrong

693
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:19,527
l'll be a bit late this evening

694
01:19:19,528 --> 01:19:21,066
Some students have called
me for tennis

695
01:19:21,067 --> 01:19:22,607
They'll say he has
become the

696
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:24,438
slave of his wife, if l
don't go -

697
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:26,479
- will you mind ?

698
01:19:27,478 --> 01:19:30,016
Friends have some claim
on you

699
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,179
You can go to the club daily

700
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:40,797
Alright. l will

701
01:19:48,415 --> 01:19:53,244
Have you forgotten

702
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:55,907
You kiss

703
01:19:58,113 --> 01:20:03,567
l'm getting late. l must go

704
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,531
Let's have another game

705
01:20:38,532 --> 01:20:40,861
What is it ? You look
worried

706
01:20:40,862 --> 01:20:42,984
lt's nothing

707
01:20:42,985 --> 01:20:47,897
You haven't played
well today

708
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,556
What is the matter ?

709
01:20:55,557 --> 01:20:58,052
Mohan didn't come to
play tennis

710
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,217
Till today he never
failed to come

711
01:21:00,218 --> 01:21:05,463
He left the office early

712
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:28,647
The girl said l forgot to
tell you something

713
01:21:28,648 --> 01:21:30,854
This is my husband

714
01:21:40,802 --> 01:21:42,841
Oh. He's come

715
01:21:42,842 --> 01:21:44,590
He just told me a joke

716
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:48,461
l nearly died laughing

717
01:21:48,462 --> 01:21:51,000
Tell it once more

718
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:53,622
A joke is not funny if
repeated

719
01:21:53,623 --> 01:21:55,787
Today you did not come
to play tennis

720
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:59,075
Everyone was waiting for
you

721
01:21:59,076 --> 01:22:00,906
l had to go to a party

722
01:22:00,907 --> 01:22:03,613
l came home early, my wife
was out

723
01:22:04,029 --> 01:22:06,110
The house was locked

724
01:22:06,111 --> 01:22:08,108
This house is also yours

725
01:22:08,109 --> 01:22:10,605
So l came here

726
01:22:10,606 --> 01:22:12,104
lt's good you were at home

727
01:22:12,105 --> 01:22:14,809
Or l would have been very
bored

728
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,433
l'll bring coffee

729
01:22:16,434 --> 01:22:18,639
You are spoiling my habits

730
01:22:19,555 --> 01:22:21,053
l just had two cups

731
01:22:21,054 --> 01:22:23,426
Then one more won't harm

732
01:22:23,427 --> 01:22:26,383
One coffee for Mohan and
one tea for me

733
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,787
ls it still early for
your party ?

734
01:22:36,788 --> 01:22:41,867
Shall l go and change ?

735
01:22:56,436 --> 01:22:58,806
Mohan has gone. His wife
has come

736
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,596
lt's so beautiful

737
01:23:00,597 --> 01:23:02,387
lt's surely my Sonu's choice

738
01:23:02,388 --> 01:23:04,427
No. lt's Mohan's choice

739
01:23:04,428 --> 01:23:08,089
He presented it to me

740
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:12,377
The choice of artists are
strange

741
01:23:12,378 --> 01:23:13,958
Do you like it ?

742
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:15,416
Do you like it ?

743
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:16,831
Very much

744
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:19,495
Other people have given
me presents

745
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:24,490
But l like this the best

746
01:23:27,197 --> 01:23:29,068
l've got milk on the stove

747
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:33,940
lt might boil over

748
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:12,152
You have come home
so early

749
01:24:15,065 --> 01:24:19,310
Didn't you go to play ?

750
01:24:19,311 --> 01:24:23,348
What were you doing ?

751
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:25,721
l was just cleaning the
house

752
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,729
Why is the door open

753
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:00,643
To throw out the dirt

754
01:25:00,644 --> 01:25:03,016
You should shut it before
night fall

755
01:25:03,017 --> 01:25:04,722
You seem worried

756
01:25:04,723 --> 01:25:07,097
What is the matter

757
01:25:07,845 --> 01:25:11,423
Why are you checking
every room

758
01:25:11,424 --> 01:25:13,464
Had someone come to
see me ?

759
01:25:16,254 --> 01:25:19,540
No. Yes. Mohan had
come

760
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:21,165
He had to go out

761
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:26,452
He wanted a bag so l
gave him yours

762
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:30,738
lt's good our things are
useful -

763
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:36,067
- to our neighbour

764
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:22,032
Who broke this glass ?

765
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:45,340
May l come in ?

766
01:30:45,341 --> 01:30:46,713
Where is Kamal

767
01:30:46,714 --> 01:30:49,045
l have to talk with him

768
01:30:49,045 --> 01:30:51,084
His friend's condition is very
serious

769
01:30:51,085 --> 01:30:53,540
He's gone to see him

770
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:58,160
He'll be back tomorrow

771
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:00,242
That's why in the office -

772
01:31:00,243 --> 01:31:03,073
- he seemed a little worried

773
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:09,441
Am l disturbing you ?

774
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:11,647
No. l was getting bored

775
01:31:11,648 --> 01:31:16,768
l was just reading

776
01:31:17,934 --> 01:31:21,304
What will you drink

777
01:31:21,305 --> 01:31:22,969
l'm in a hurry

778
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:25,133
There's a programme of
Ravishankar

779
01:31:25,134 --> 01:31:27,216
The committee sent 2
tickets

780
01:31:28,547 --> 01:31:31,628
As usual she's gone to the
movies

781
01:31:32,211 --> 01:31:34,958
She's busy in her world

782
01:31:37,538 --> 01:31:39,703
Come with me

783
01:31:40,535 --> 01:31:45,280
We'll be back by 10 o'clock

784
01:31:45,281 --> 01:31:50,275
Wait, l'll get dressed

785
01:32:43,806 --> 01:32:47,384
Who is behind the curtain ?

786
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:52,464
Who are you ?

787
01:32:57,209 --> 01:32:59,331
You were at your friend's

788
01:33:02,787 --> 01:33:07,741
How come you are here ?

789
01:33:08,489 --> 01:33:10,945
What is the meaning of
keeping an eye on -

790
01:33:12,527 --> 01:33:17,646
- me at midnight

791
01:33:17,647 --> 01:33:19,770
What do you have to do
with Mohan ?

792
01:33:29,301 --> 01:33:31,758
You have so much sympathy
in your heart

793
01:33:32,715 --> 01:33:35,337
l know you both meet in
my absence

794
01:33:39,084 --> 01:33:41,747
The world knows, Mohan's
wife -

795
01:33:41,748 --> 01:33:43,870
- does not love him

796
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:46,242
And you are making up
for that

797
01:33:46,243 --> 01:33:48,490
This evening you went
with him

798
01:33:48,491 --> 01:33:50,530
Where did you go ?

799
01:33:51,862 --> 01:33:54,110
Now l know the reason
for your frigidity

800
01:33:55,068 --> 01:33:57,149
l could never think that
you would doubt me

801
01:34:01,436 --> 01:34:03,517
l'm feeling ashamed of
myself

802
01:34:04,308 --> 01:34:06,597
What did l see in you ?

803
01:34:06,598 --> 01:34:08,638
Why did l love and marry
you ?

804
01:34:10,219 --> 01:34:15,213
You did not answer my
question

805
01:34:15,214 --> 01:34:17,545
What relationship do you
have with Mohan ?

806
01:34:19,376 --> 01:34:21,458
Do you want to know ?

807
01:34:23,206 --> 01:34:25,453
l won't tell you

808
01:34:25,454 --> 01:34:27,867
But from today l have no -

809
01:34:27,868 --> 01:34:30,449
- relationship with you

810
01:34:37,816 --> 01:34:40,605
lf you leave the house
like this -

811
01:34:40,606 --> 01:34:44,019
- my suspicion will prove
correct

812
01:34:45,392 --> 01:34:47,723
lt doesn't matter

813
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:50,679
l'm going away from your
life forever

814
01:35:10,908 --> 01:35:14,363
ln my absence there is
none to welcome you

815
01:35:25,935 --> 01:35:31,096
l came to meet you both

816
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:35,508
Knowing that l'm not at
home

817
01:35:35,509 --> 01:35:37,965
Sunita told me you went
out somewhere

818
01:35:40,504 --> 01:35:42,959
lt would be better if
l had gone

819
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,622
You two would have
freedom

820
01:35:46,623 --> 01:35:48,161
What do you mean ?

821
01:35:48,162 --> 01:35:50,619
l would never have got a
friend like you

822
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:53,408
You did so much for me

823
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:56,405
You got me a job and a
house

824
01:35:56,862 --> 01:35:59,901
lt's a friend's duty to help
a friend

825
01:36:01,608 --> 01:36:03,648
To play with his honour
To burn his house

826
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:06,894
What is this nonsense

827
01:36:22,045 --> 01:36:25,333
Today you slapped me

828
01:36:25,334 --> 01:36:27,248
l forgive you -

829
01:36:27,249 --> 01:36:32,244
- because l'm your friend

830
01:36:34,783 --> 01:36:36,905
Suspicion has made you
lose your senses

831
01:36:38,196 --> 01:36:40,818
But the day you come to
your senses

832
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:47,229
You'll regret this

833
01:36:58,759 --> 01:37:04,045
What happened, daughter ?

834
01:37:04,711 --> 01:37:08,123
Now l will never go there

835
01:37:08,124 --> 01:37:10,247
You've quarrelled with our
son-in-law

836
01:37:52,954 --> 01:37:57,117
You ? That means your
daughter reached home

837
01:37:58,116 --> 01:38:00,531
You should be ashamed of -

838
01:38:01,029 --> 01:38:03,069
- treating Sunita in this way

839
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:06,939
Not me but your daughter

840
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:12,101
who took advantage of
my love

841
01:38:12,102 --> 01:38:14,475
You are blaming her falsely

842
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:19,053
lf this is false, why did she leave
the house?

843
01:38:19,678 --> 01:38:22,756
Why didn't she answer
my question ?

844
01:38:22,757 --> 01:38:25,422
You misunderstood

845
01:38:25,423 --> 01:38:27,586
That's why l've come to
make you understand

846
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,748
l don't have any time

847
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:35,413
My father is ill. l have to
go to the village

848
01:38:43,071 --> 01:38:45,443
What would you have done -

849
01:38:45,444 --> 01:38:47,815
- if you were in my place

850
01:38:47,816 --> 01:38:49,813
l would face it

851
01:38:49,814 --> 01:38:51,852
l'd remove this
misunderstanding

852
01:38:51,853 --> 01:38:55,599
But l'd never leave my
house

853
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,806
You are innocent. Why are
you afraid ?

854
01:39:01,345 --> 01:39:03,425
Go back to Kamal

855
01:39:03,426 --> 01:39:05,923
Never. Sunita will never
go there

856
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:14,040
Nowadays men and women
are equal

857
01:39:15,081 --> 01:39:17,496
Whoever makes the mistake
should suffer

858
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:21,822
But in our society -

859
01:39:21,823 --> 01:39:23,863
- no one sees the mistake
of the man

860
01:39:24,364 --> 01:39:29,649
The wife is always blamed
and punished

861
01:39:35,851 --> 01:39:37,933
Sunita has lost Kamal's faith

862
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,887
She'll never be happy
with him

863
01:39:42,387 --> 01:39:45,218
Every couple quarrels

864
01:39:45,966 --> 01:39:48,297
But they make up
afterwards

865
01:39:48,298 --> 01:39:50,919
You are right to be angry
with Kamal

866
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:53,167
But don't let this go further

867
01:39:53,168 --> 01:39:55,457
lt's the question of our
daughter

868
01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:57,704
A father cannot see the -

869
01:39:58,121 --> 01:40:00,286
- destruction of his own
daughter

870
01:40:00,826 --> 01:40:02,907
Then go and see Kamal -

871
01:40:02,908 --> 01:40:04,988
- make him understand

872
01:40:04,989 --> 01:40:07,526
l have already met with
him

873
01:40:07,527 --> 01:40:09,650
He insulted me and went
to his village

874
01:40:10,691 --> 01:40:13,189
He doesn't care for Sunita

875
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:15,895
l've decided that if he does
not apologize -

876
01:40:17,436 --> 01:40:19,682
- she won't return to him

877
01:40:29,881 --> 01:40:34,793
Someone is here to see you

878
01:40:50,943 --> 01:40:52,523
Who are you ?

879
01:40:52,524 --> 01:40:54,564
Kamal's friend and
neighbour

880
01:40:55,479 --> 01:41:00,267
What is your name ?

881
01:41:01,308 --> 01:41:04,636
Sunita must have told me
about you

882
01:41:04,637 --> 01:41:06,718
Like her l am too -

883
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:09,631
- a victim of this
misunderstanding

884
01:41:09,632 --> 01:41:11,963
Why don't you try -

885
01:41:11,964 --> 01:41:14,419
- to explain to your friend ?

886
01:41:14,419 --> 01:41:16,541
l didn't get the chance

887
01:41:16,542 --> 01:41:18,581
When l met Kamal after
Sunita left

888
01:41:20,621 --> 01:41:24,118
He slapped me

889
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:28,321
Did Kamal slap you ?

890
01:41:28,322 --> 01:41:31,277
He is not in his senses

891
01:41:31,278 --> 01:41:33,483
He's a very good friend

892
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:37,436
So l didn't take offence

893
01:41:37,437 --> 01:41:39,560
Then why did you come
here ?

894
01:41:40,559 --> 01:41:43,390
To request Sunita to tie -

895
01:41:45,098 --> 01:41:47,927
- the Rakhie on my hand -

896
01:41:47,928 --> 01:41:51,257
- so Kamal can remove
his doubt forever

897
01:41:51,258 --> 01:41:53,587
The man who doubts -

898
01:41:53,588 --> 01:41:56,918
- his wife and his best
friend -

899
01:41:56,919 --> 01:41:59,374
- can also insult.

900
01:41:59,374 --> 01:42:01,538
Anyhow they should be
reconciled

901
01:42:03,745 --> 01:42:06,077
There is no hope for that

902
01:42:13,568 --> 01:42:17,480
Sunita cannot prove her
innocence

903
01:42:17,481 --> 01:42:20,561
Thinking carefully l've
come to the -

904
01:42:22,726 --> 01:42:26,430
- conclusion that
confrontation is necessary

905
01:42:37,794 --> 01:42:40,541
Tomorrow l'm sending
him a notice

906
01:42:44,039 --> 01:42:46,743
That is the only way

907
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,033
So he must be forced to
come here

908
01:42:49,034 --> 01:42:52,154
From this notice it's clear -

909
01:42:52,155 --> 01:42:55,358
- your wealthy father-in-law -

910
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:57,774
- wants a divorce for his
daughter

911
01:42:58,356 --> 01:43:00,480
Putting the blame on you

912
01:43:05,766 --> 01:43:07,722
What should l do ?

913
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:10,511
ln my opinion we should
fight -

914
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:17,463
- demand an answer to
your question -

915
01:43:19,502 --> 01:43:21,916
- right in the court

916
01:43:21,917 --> 01:43:23,957
Or there is only one way

917
01:43:24,497 --> 01:43:26,411
Apologize to your wife

918
01:43:26,412 --> 01:43:29,325
Never. l haven't done
anything -

919
01:43:31,323 --> 01:43:34,196
- l'm fed up with all of this

920
01:43:38,275 --> 01:43:40,814
l'll proceed with the matter

921
01:43:40,815 --> 01:43:43,770
What happened ? Why didn't
you have tea ?

922
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:47,850
Kamal's lawyer's notice
has come

923
01:43:48,306 --> 01:43:53,760
What is it ?

924
01:43:54,384 --> 01:43:56,757
l just threatened him

925
01:43:58,797 --> 01:44:01,794
The matter is going to the
court

926
01:44:06,914 --> 01:44:09,535
After receiving the
summons

927
01:44:09,536 --> 01:44:11,366
Sunita is absent -

928
01:44:11,367 --> 01:44:13,656
- and has not sent anyone

929
01:44:13,657 --> 01:44:16,028
lt's clear that there is
no answer -

930
01:44:16,029 --> 01:44:18,068
- to Kamal's summons

931
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:20,108
l can give such an answer

932
01:44:20,109 --> 01:44:22,106
That Kamal and his lawyer
will remember always

933
01:44:22,107 --> 01:44:23,938
Then do something

934
01:44:23,939 --> 01:44:25,644
What can l do ?

935
01:44:25,645 --> 01:44:30,806
lt's an insult to go to the
court

936
01:44:34,053 --> 01:44:36,467
l curse the day when
Sunita chose Kamal

937
01:44:48,996 --> 01:44:51,701
Sunita has not come to
court

938
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:54,406
lt proves that she has no
answer -

939
01:44:54,407 --> 01:44:56,488
- to the lawyer's evidence -

940
01:44:56,489 --> 01:44:58,778
- the court accepts the
statement -

941
01:44:58,779 --> 01:45:01,316
- of the lawyer -

942
01:45:01,317 --> 01:45:04,522
- and decides that a divorce
should take place

943
01:45:08,727 --> 01:45:14,055
lt's a lie, a lie

944
01:45:15,553 --> 01:45:17,550
For which sin is God -

945
01:45:17,551 --> 01:45:22,004
- punishing me so cruelly

946
01:45:22,005 --> 01:45:27,499
Now what is left for me
in this world

947
01:45:35,366 --> 01:45:37,530
God knows what would have
happened -

948
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,695
- if l had not come

949
01:45:39,696 --> 01:45:42,233
l would have got my
freedom

950
01:45:42,234 --> 01:45:44,440
Forget whatever happened

951
01:45:44,441 --> 01:45:47,687
How can l forget

952
01:45:47,688 --> 01:45:49,810
My love, my lost life

953
01:45:58,469 --> 01:46:03,713
How can l forget

954
01:46:19,322 --> 01:46:23,068
l have examined Sunita
very carefully

955
01:46:23,069 --> 01:46:25,441
Her condition is very
serious

956
01:46:25,442 --> 01:46:27,813
What do you mean ?

957
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:29,854
lf she cannot bear the
shock she received -

958
01:46:36,305 --> 01:46:39,427
- What do you mean ?

959
01:46:39,428 --> 01:46:41,800
lt's possible she'll become
insane

960
01:46:49,126 --> 01:46:52,164
We leave our daughter
in your hands

961
01:46:54,912 --> 01:46:57,618
You know we have only one
child

962
01:47:00,281 --> 01:47:04,276
Cure her in any way

963
01:47:04,277 --> 01:47:07,148
l'll do my very best

964
01:47:07,149 --> 01:47:09,938
l'll consult a specialist

965
01:47:09,939 --> 01:47:12,144
The rest is in Gods hands

966
01:47:16,807 --> 01:47:19,137
Save Sunita somehow

967
01:47:20,053 --> 01:47:25,173
Can l see her ?

968
01:47:29,961 --> 01:47:32,706
How are you daughter ?

969
01:47:32,707 --> 01:47:35,038
Won't you talk with your
mother ?

970
01:47:36,745 --> 01:47:39,117
Do you know, mother

971
01:47:40,492 --> 01:47:43,030
Love and death are alike

972
01:47:55,893 --> 01:47:58,515
Now you've begun smoking

973
01:48:06,216 --> 01:48:11,711
Why is your hand trembling ?

974
01:48:13,999 --> 01:48:18,203
There are always ups
and downs in life

975
01:48:18,204 --> 01:48:22,531
But man should continue
working

976
01:48:22,532 --> 01:48:25,155
This is your employment
report

977
01:48:26,196 --> 01:48:28,568
Last month you did nothing

978
01:48:29,109 --> 01:48:31,356
lf this continues

979
01:48:31,357 --> 01:48:33,688
l'll try in the future

980
01:48:34,104 --> 01:48:38,349
A complaint is of no use

981
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:41,013
l just called you for that

982
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:43,220
Be patient and work
carefully

983
01:49:27,634 --> 01:49:29,133
You

984
01:49:29,757 --> 01:49:32,753
l thought today l'm caught

985
01:49:32,754 --> 01:49:34,626
How did you come into
my house ?

986
01:49:34,627 --> 01:49:36,541
From Mohan's house

987
01:49:36,542 --> 01:49:38,664
l couldn't come from the
front door

988
01:49:38,665 --> 01:49:43,868
So l had to do so

989
01:49:49,779 --> 01:49:52,109
Why do you go quietly -

990
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:54,439
- in the darkness like a thief

991
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,937
What is the use of keeping
this from you

992
01:49:56,938 --> 01:50:02,349
l go to meet Mohan's wife

993
01:50:07,511 --> 01:50:10,632
He who lit a fire in my
house -

994
01:50:10,633 --> 01:50:12,673
- his house is not safe

995
01:50:13,463 --> 01:50:15,710
Think what you like

996
01:50:15,711 --> 01:50:18,249
But you yourself lit the fire

997
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:20,913
l know Sunita and Mohan

998
01:50:20,914 --> 01:50:24,244
Their relationship is like
brother and sister

999
01:50:26,117 --> 01:50:28,199
l'm telling you the truth

1000
01:50:52,299 --> 01:50:54,421
Think what you like

1001
01:50:54,422 --> 01:50:56,877
But you yourself lit the fire

1002
01:50:56,878 --> 01:50:59,708
l know Sunita and Mohan

1003
01:50:59,709 --> 01:51:03,246
Their relationship is like
brother and sister

1004
01:51:05,328 --> 01:51:07,659
l never thought you will
doubt me

1005
01:51:08,492 --> 01:51:13,695
l'm ashamed of myself

1006
01:51:14,943 --> 01:51:18,397
Today you slapped my face

1007
01:51:18,398 --> 01:51:21,353
l forgive you because
you are my friend

1008
01:51:25,849 --> 01:51:29,179
Suspicion has made you
lose your senses

1009
01:51:55,819 --> 01:51:58,899
What is the matter ?

1010
01:52:02,271 --> 01:52:06,849
Forgive me, Mohan

1011
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:11,344
l misjudged you

1012
01:52:11,345 --> 01:52:13,510
l insulted friendship

1013
01:52:18,088 --> 01:52:20,461
A mistake between friends -

1014
01:52:22,418 --> 01:52:26,287
- is like a gift

1015
01:52:26,288 --> 01:52:28,620
l know you are so
big-hearted

1016
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:34,279
That's why l came to you

1017
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,570
Today l discovered what
l lost

1018
01:52:39,609 --> 01:52:42,439
How did you remove the
misunderstanding

1019
01:52:46,102 --> 01:52:48,349
Due to Suresh

1020
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:50,889
There is no need to say
anything further

1021
01:52:55,926 --> 01:52:59,004
Everyone has his misery

1022
01:52:59,005 --> 01:53:01,420
Some get it without asking
like me

1023
01:53:02,670 --> 01:53:05,458
And some ask for it like
you

1024
01:53:38,217 --> 01:53:40,256
Why are you here ?

1025
01:53:48,248 --> 01:53:52,660
l'm here to repent

1026
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:54,824
To apologize for my mistake

1027
01:53:55,492 --> 01:53:57,114
To Sunita

1028
01:54:00,153 --> 01:54:03,525
l've been very unjust to her

1029
01:54:05,647 --> 01:54:11,017
You have come to late

1030
01:54:11,184 --> 01:54:13,097
Where is she

1031
01:54:13,098 --> 01:54:18,052
ln her house

1032
01:54:19,593 --> 01:54:22,795
- with her husband

1033
01:54:22,796 --> 01:54:24,919
And she is very happy

1034
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:30,913
But how can this be

1035
01:54:33,454 --> 01:54:36,823
You lost the right to ask
this -

1036
01:54:36,824 --> 01:54:40,405
- the day you divorced her

1037
01:54:49,479 --> 01:54:51,643
My daughter's heart was
broken

1038
01:54:54,806 --> 01:54:57,430
And she tried to commit
suicide

1039
01:55:03,298 --> 01:55:05,422
lt affected her mind

1040
01:55:09,459 --> 01:55:12,289
There was a possibility
of insanity

1041
01:55:13,829 --> 01:55:15,868
Specialists saved her

1042
01:55:17,284 --> 01:55:20,863
But she needed a
husband's love

1043
01:55:26,732 --> 01:55:28,772
lt was fortunate for her -

1044
01:55:29,272 --> 01:55:31,769
- to find a good man for
her -

1045
01:55:32,602 --> 01:55:36,224
- who knew everything
and accepted her

1046
01:55:41,094 --> 01:55:43,299
Do you know what she
said -

1047
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:46,089
- when she heard of the
second marriage ?

1048
01:55:46,546 --> 01:55:49,708
lt's better to die

1049
01:55:49,709 --> 01:55:52,458
Her mother also was
against it

1050
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:02,114
But it was the question
of a young daughter

1051
01:56:04,528 --> 01:56:07,608
l don't want her to suffer -

1052
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:12,480
- her whole life for your
mistake

1053
01:56:20,138 --> 01:56:22,967
Such a cruel punishment

1054
01:56:22,968 --> 01:56:26,588
For my mistake

1055
01:56:26,589 --> 01:56:29,295
lf instead of my daughter -

1056
01:56:29,296 --> 01:56:31,377
- it was your daughter or
sister -

1057
01:56:31,834 --> 01:56:33,873
- what would you do ?

1058
01:56:33,874 --> 01:56:39,327
The same which you do ?

1059
01:56:41,034 --> 01:56:43,324
Now you have no claim
to Sunita

1060
01:56:45,363 --> 01:56:47,985
You shouldn't even take
her name

1061
01:56:55,894 --> 01:56:58,142
But it will be in my heart

1062
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:02,928
But tell her of my desire
to -

1063
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:14,916
- beg her for forgiveness -

1064
01:57:15,874 --> 01:57:21,077
- will remain till my last
breath

1065
01:57:49,133 --> 01:57:51,421
Hurry up. They must be
coming

1066
01:57:52,337 --> 01:57:54,418
Where is Kanhaiyalal ?

1067
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,249
He's lighting the candles

1068
01:57:57,250 --> 01:57:59,039
1 2 3 4 5

1069
01:57:59,454 --> 01:58:01,995
Fifth is burning correctly

1070
01:58:02,827 --> 01:58:06,864
l'll put you on

1071
01:58:14,191 --> 01:58:16,520
Who are you ?

1072
01:58:16,521 --> 01:58:21,849
Should l tell you ?

1073
01:58:22,598 --> 01:58:24,930
How can this burn ? There
is no oil

1074
01:58:25,929 --> 01:58:31,174
There is wine in it

1075
01:58:33,587 --> 01:58:35,876
lt's not my fault

1076
01:58:35,877 --> 01:58:38,624
Both bottles are alike

1077
01:58:46,325 --> 01:58:48,404
Take him home

1078
01:58:48,405 --> 01:58:50,320
What is the matter ?

1079
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:52,360
He's not in his senses

1080
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:54,858
He's pouring wine instead
of oil in the lamps

1081
01:58:55,316 --> 01:59:00,768
Now nothing can be done

1082
01:59:02,642 --> 01:59:05,555
You've come ? Where is
sister-in-law ?

1083
01:59:09,302 --> 01:59:12,174
What happened ? Why are
you silent ?

1084
01:59:13,797 --> 01:59:17,460
She's gone far away

1085
01:59:18,667 --> 01:59:21,498
She's gone forever
leaving me

1086
02:06:27,946 --> 02:06:30,860
lf you should see this
advertisement -

1087
02:06:31,276 --> 02:06:33,774
- then come to me
immediately

1088
02:06:34,648 --> 02:06:37,520
Someone is thinking of
you, Mohan

1089
02:08:21,249 --> 02:08:25,494
What happened

1090
02:08:25,495 --> 02:08:28,367
Loafer...idiot

1091
02:08:33,571 --> 02:08:37,482
l'm not a thief

1092
02:08:37,483 --> 02:08:39,772
No ? l'll teach you a
lesson

1093
02:08:40,355 --> 02:08:43,102
You dared enter my house
to steal

1094
02:08:46,057 --> 02:08:49,096
l'll teach you a lesson

1095
02:08:50,803 --> 02:08:52,718
What happened ?

1096
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:54,799
What is the matter, Mr. Joshi ?

1097
02:08:55,298 --> 02:08:57,505
This thief entered my house

1098
02:08:57,963 --> 02:09:00,168
lt's good that my wife saw
him -

1099
02:09:00,627 --> 02:09:03,040
- or he would have stolen
everything

1100
02:09:03,457 --> 02:09:05,539
His face is like an angel

1101
02:09:06,121 --> 02:09:08,369
But his work is of a thief

1102
02:09:09,493 --> 02:09:11,824
Hold him, l'll call the police

1103
02:09:12,864 --> 02:09:18,234
What are you looking at ?

1104
02:09:47,871 --> 02:09:49,993
Where had you gone ?

1105
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:06,270
Do you know him, Mohan ?

1106
02:10:08,643 --> 02:10:10,722
He's my friend -

1107
02:10:10,723 --> 02:10:13,346
- whom l sought for a long
time

1108
02:10:18,591 --> 02:10:21,004
He used to work in our
factory -

1109
02:10:22,170 --> 02:10:24,459
- and lived in this house

1110
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,706
l made a mistake

1111
02:10:26,707 --> 02:10:30,120
l forget everything but
remembered now

1112
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:47,187
l had advertised in all
the newspapers -

1113
02:10:47,769 --> 02:10:49,850
- for you to come

1114
02:10:50,517 --> 02:10:52,971
You came at the right time

1115
02:10:52,972 --> 02:10:55,471
Tomorrow would have
been too late

1116
02:10:58,675 --> 02:11:00,756
Do you trust your fate ?

1117
02:11:05,876 --> 02:11:08,040
l don't trust myself

1118
02:11:12,827 --> 02:11:17,282
l'm of no use to anyone

1119
02:11:20,237 --> 02:11:23,443
Why did you call me ?

1120
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:27,355
To give you good news

1121
02:12:02,404 --> 02:12:05,566
Ekta is getting married
on 7th February

1122
02:12:18,262 --> 02:12:20,968
My husband insisted l write
to you

1123
02:12:21,426 --> 02:12:24,048
You will be surprised to
know

1124
02:12:26,753 --> 02:12:29,833
When l left Kamal's house
l was pregnant

1125
02:12:40,739 --> 02:12:43,819
- he would have doubted his
own child

1126
02:12:47,067 --> 02:12:50,231
No one knows this except
father and my husband

1127
02:12:50,729 --> 02:12:53,558
Today l have to tell you

1128
02:12:53,559 --> 02:12:56,433
Because Ekta wants her
father's blessing -

1129
02:12:56,848 --> 02:12:59,553
- on the occasion of her
marriage

1130
02:13:06,796 --> 02:13:10,294
So you must bring Kamal

1131
02:13:12,707 --> 02:13:15,289
Let him read this letter

1132
02:13:16,661 --> 02:13:19,867
l hope he'll give Ekta his
blessing

1133
02:13:21,033 --> 02:13:26,319
Yours, Sunita

1134
02:13:30,522 --> 02:13:33,020
Today is 7th February

1135
02:13:33,021 --> 02:13:36,850
That's why l said tomorrow
would be too late

1136
02:13:40,055 --> 02:13:42,137
lt would be better

1137
02:13:50,753 --> 02:13:53,624
There is little time, come
with me

1138
02:13:55,873 --> 02:13:58,745
No, l promised her father

1139
02:14:00,659 --> 02:14:03,573
l would never enter her life
again

1140
02:14:06,071 --> 02:14:08,402
You must come to bless
Ekta

1141
02:14:10,151 --> 02:14:12,771
Maybe my blessing -

1142
02:14:12,772 --> 02:14:17,725
- would be a curse on her

1143
02:14:17,726 --> 02:14:21,014
The man who gave an
unknown child his name

1144
02:14:26,591 --> 02:14:28,798
l won't show him my face

1145
02:14:29,463 --> 02:14:31,795
You have been punished
enough

1146
02:14:32,752 --> 02:14:35,251
You'll never get such a
chance -

1147
02:14:35,791 --> 02:14:38,081
- for repentance

1148
02:14:38,579 --> 02:14:43,949
Don't let it go

1149
02:15:00,516 --> 02:15:02,223
So you have come

1150
02:15:02,224 --> 02:15:04,595
Sunita and Harish asked so
many times

1151
02:15:05,012 --> 02:15:10,465
Sorry, l'm a little late

1152
02:15:12,214 --> 02:15:14,044
Come in, Excuse me

1153
02:15:14,045 --> 02:15:16,916
l couldn't reach in time

1154
02:15:16,917 --> 02:15:22,161
Meet Ekta's Uncle

1155
02:15:22,162 --> 02:15:25,033
Congratulations
Congratulations

1156
02:15:25,034 --> 02:15:27,157
Mohan, are you alone ?

1157
02:15:27,572 --> 02:15:29,737
l met Kamal. He is coming

1158
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:37,646
That is very good

1159
02:15:53,421 --> 02:15:55,211
Now you come

1160
02:15:55,212 --> 02:15:57,583
l've been waiting for you

1161
02:15:57,584 --> 02:15:59,956
At least be serious today -

1162
02:15:59,957 --> 02:16:02,204
- because you are a bride

1163
02:16:02,205 --> 02:16:04,244
And every bride must be shy

1164
02:16:04,702 --> 02:16:06,992
Those are all old customs

1165
02:16:07,949 --> 02:16:10,445
What present did you bring
for me ?

1166
02:16:10,446 --> 02:16:12,903
l've brought you such a
present -

1167
02:16:13,443 --> 02:16:16,648
- with which other presents
are incomparable

1168
02:16:17,606 --> 02:16:20,145
Have you brought the moon
and sun ?

1169
02:16:21,061 --> 02:16:23,225
They are nothing compared -

1170
02:16:24,058 --> 02:16:26,387
- to what l brought

1171
02:16:26,388 --> 02:16:31,342
What is it ?

1172
02:16:42,664 --> 02:16:44,787
You have no claim on
Sunita

1173
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:48,450
You shouldn't even take her
name

1174
02:16:49,158 --> 02:16:51,320
Why did you come here ?

1175
02:16:51,321 --> 02:16:53,361
To show in front of the
world -

1176
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:56,233
- that Ekta is your daughter

1177
02:16:56,234 --> 02:16:58,648
So the man who gave her
his name

1178
02:16:59,064 --> 02:17:00,979
Who fed her

1179
02:17:00,980 --> 02:17:03,434
Should be disgraced

1180
02:17:03,435 --> 02:17:05,725
Today is Ekta's marriage

1181
02:17:06,390 --> 02:17:09,179
Do you want to disgrace
her in front -

1182
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:11,843
- of everyone ?

1183
02:17:11,844 --> 02:17:14,049
You ruined Sunita's life

1184
02:17:14,590 --> 02:17:17,504
Now do you want to spoil
her daughter's life ?

1185
02:17:17,963 --> 02:17:23,248
Go away from here

1186
02:18:18,193 --> 02:18:20,067
Bless her

1187
02:19:32,744 --> 02:19:35,157
May you live long

1188
02:19:35,158 --> 02:19:40,444
Always be happy

1189
02:19:40,736 --> 02:19:43,275
Congratulations
Congratulations

1190
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:08,962
My child. ls she alive

1191
02:22:10,170 --> 02:22:13,750
Mummy, this man saved me

1192
02:22:44,968 --> 02:22:47,632
l thought him someone else

1193
02:22:49,755 --> 02:22:54,833
But he saved my life

1194
02:22:54,834 --> 02:22:58,080
Touch his feet and take his
blessing

1195
02:23:02,784 --> 02:23:05,156
He is your father

1196
02:23:13,815 --> 02:23:17,644
No. Don't touch my feet

1197
02:23:19,475 --> 02:23:22,389
l'm not worthy to be your
father

1198
02:23:23,097 --> 02:23:25,885
l have no relationship with
you

1199
02:23:36,999 --> 02:23:39,664
May you live long

1200
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,656
May you always be happy

1201
02:23:58,394 --> 02:24:02,765
Hugging you l forget my
miseries

1202
02:24:08,010 --> 02:24:10,758
My soul is at peace

1203
02:24:22,621 --> 02:24:25,493
Now l have just one desire

1204
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:07,783
You came to repent -

1205
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:10,864
- by blessing your daughter

1206
02:25:11,613 --> 02:25:14,943
ls this your repentance ?

1207
02:25:38,836 --> 02:25:42,415
What the eyes see -

1208
02:25:42,416 --> 02:25:45,912
- is only a mirage
