1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,833


3
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,083
It must emerge as a big factory.

4
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,000
He is our owner!

5
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,542
Not only for the shop.
-Get in.

6
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,917
Even for this film!
God!

7
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,792
Are you let free
for two months?

8
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,292
He is our hero at childhood!

9
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,542
He won't talk more.

10
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,667
Ride the bicycle carefully.

11
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,042
You look at your job.

12
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:58,458
He talks less, but wise.
-If I hear that,you overtake...

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,583
Our owner was cheated
not only for cycle...

14
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,542
...but also by
giving money to this film.

15
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,375
They aren't seen yet.

16
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:11,375
They might be afraid of me.
-He is the antagonist of this film.

17
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,583
His name is Villangam.

18
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,583
He made me to tell
his name,flabby.

19
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,417
They win every year.

20
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,667
Why should they be afraid of us?

21
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,667
Shall we go?
-Yes,we'll go.

22
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:20,667
When did you come?

23
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,417
No feud between them.

24
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,208
But,that's the biggest problem!

25
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,625
See now.

26
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,542
How is it?

27
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,333
Aunt,your son has met
with a road accident.

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,208
Oh no!

29
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,667
Nothing to panic.

30
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,458
Naughty boy.
He'll be like that.

31
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,833
Better consult our astrologer, once.

32
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,625
Within a month, bandage for
fractures is almost 16 times.

33
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,667
We must take care
of our child.

34
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,583
The horoscope is
not good enough.

35
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,917
You must take care of him
for 18 years as per horoscope.

36
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,208
He has death knot in
vehicle,water and air.

37
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,833
How about drinking
and washing?

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Death knot to you in mouth.

39
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,500
Hey, shut your trap.

40
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,625
You proceed, sir.

41
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,917
Until Raghu orientation ends,
don't think about driving a vehicle.

42
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,500
If so,it's dangerous to his life.

43
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,292
Oh no!
Any remedy for that?

44
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,375
Not to drive,is
the big remedy.

45
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,333
What a sharp wedge?

46
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,292
Because of the antagonist,
our hero couldn't learn...

47
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,042
...to drive any vehicle.

48
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:24,625
Now,the mischief
of the hero is...

49
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,250
Villangam's only ambition
is to build a white house...

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,875
... that must surprise the
American president.

51
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,000
Ouch...

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,167
Listen to his tales.

53
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,167
My great great grandfather
has sown sesame.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,958
My great grandfather
has sown horsegram.

55
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,875
My grandfather
has sown paddy.

56
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,000
My father has done
all the three.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,083
What's the use?

58
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:09,250
They strived.

59
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,958
I sold the land.

60
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,583
I got huge money.

61
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,292
I'm happy.

62
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:19,792
He narrates without shy,
how to live with ancestors property.

63
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,417
Tell me,astrologer.

64
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,083
Don't mistake me
as I repeatedly say.

65
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,125
If you skip any remedy,
I'm not responsible for that.

66
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:28,917
Take care.

67
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,458
Astrologer,you've told
to Villangam.

68
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,125
There won't be anything left.

69
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,583
Just wait,
Just a minute.

70
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,667
Hey, didn't you place
the lemon there?

71
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,833
Brother,we forgot.
-Turn the car.

72
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,292
Hey dude,see there,
a vehicle is coming.

73
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:48,667
Go away.

74
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:50,792
You go safe.

75
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:51,792
Don't get caught.

76
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,583
The astrologer told repeatedly.

77
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,917
It has become a problem now.

78
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,667
Instead of keeping the lemon,
you are making me to roam around.

79
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,417
Sorry.
-Lit the camphor.

80
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,250
Okay, brother.

81
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:05,958
Goddess!

82
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:11,917
Light it again.

83
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,458
It has become a huge mistake
because of the lemon.

84
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,667
What are you doing?
-Iâ€™m hindering the air.

85
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,958
Go aside.

86
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,625
Are you hindering the air!

87
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,667
Get lost... Be quite.

88
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,125
They make me to
say filthy words.

89
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,542
Oh no, it has gone off again.

90
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,375
He pushed the lemon in dark.

91
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,458
Brother, leave that.

92
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,667
I've nine lemons
to prepare juice.

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,625
Hey, are they same?

94
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,875
This is given by the priest.

95
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,083
Search out.

96
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,167
My business may lose a crore
because of a lemon.

97
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,417
Search out.

98
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,958
Oh goddess!

99
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,875
Oh goddess!
-Boss, lift your leg.

100
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,750
Hey,
-Yes, brother.

101
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,833
Why do you search here?
Go that side.

102
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,917
We are searching.
-Go away.

103
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,125
I must get that lemon.
-I got it, brother.

104
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,333
I got it.

105
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,667
Goddess!

106
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,833
Where did you find?
-They gave.

107
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,083
You mean, given?

108
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,792
Yes,I got
when I was searching.

109
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,750
Who gave?

110
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,583
I was in search of that.
They gave me.

111
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,917
Hey,is it you
or someone gave you?

112
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,583
When I was searching,
they gave.

113
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,667
Don't confuse.
-Where did you find it?

114
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey,go.
Did you take here?

115
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,292
Tell me the truth.

116
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,667
Did someone gave you?
Or you took on your own?

117
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,167
Brother,i'll tell you clearly.

118
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,167
When I was searching here,
-okay

119
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:26,917
Okay.

120
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,375
When I was searching here...

121
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,417
Boss,you gave that, isn't it?

122
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,167
Dude,he is pointing us.
Go away.

123
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,667
Who is he?
-Why does he run?

124
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,458
He runs well.
-Yes Boss.

125
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:36,958
Catch him.

126
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,833
Catch him, don't leave him.

127
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,250
Another person runs there.

128
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,833
Here comes another guy.
Don't miss him, catch him.

129
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,875
Boss,there goes another one.

130
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,917
Hey, they have
come altogether.

131
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,417
What they'll get,
where there is nothing.

132
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:50,833
But, something is there.

133
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,792
Catch him.
Another one runs that way.

134
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,208
It's my fault not having
done the ritual.

135
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,167
Boss, they've escaped,
totally...

136
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:58,917
What...?

137
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,625
Go aside.

138
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,833
When a bike is here,
And he didn't get it.

139
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,333
Don't you know,
who is that?

140
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,667
Take the cot.

141
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,292
I'll count till five.

142
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,333
Before that, he must fall
on my feet...

143
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,750
... and tell me the reason
for coming here.

144
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,167
One...

145
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,792
Brother!
-dude.

146
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,042
He doesn't know
how to ride the bike.

147
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,000
Two...

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,125
Go.
-Ask him to say.

149
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:32,917
Five...

150
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,542
Hey, three and four in between.

151
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,333
Boss,he left.
-Did he go?

152
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,125
Hey, take away.

153
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,667
Instead of going away.
he is preaching.

154
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:41,792
Hey...

155
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,917
Hey, where are you going
with the cot?

156
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,417
You'll scold me, if I don't keep at
the same place from where I took.

157
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,250
Oh, I should 've counted
by being awake.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,833
Why are you in angst?

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,125
Is riding a bike
such a heavy thing?

160
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,667
Little bit tough,dude.

161
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,625
At the beginning,it's tough,
but becomes easy later.

162
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,625
Now teach me to ride.
Stop.

163
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,000
Tell me.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,792
Dude, listen to my instructions
carefully and drive.

165
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:06,792
Get on.

166
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:07,375
You've to sit like this and...

167
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,417
Don't I know to ride sitting so?
-What?

168
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,125
Dude,will you keep
your leg that side?

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,667
That side.

170
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:21,667
See,it's the clutch...
brake...gear.

171
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,042
If you hold the clutch...

172
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,875
Hey,listen me.

173
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,875
If you hold this clutch
and put the gear and...

174
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,750
...start the accelerator,
the bike will go smooth.

175
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,667
No problem.

176
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:36,667
It'll will be like that
at the beginning.

177
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,333
Look here.

178
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,000
One minute...

179
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,250
Okay...?

180
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,333
Super...Super...

181
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,333
First,this is clutch...
brake... and gear.

182
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,958
Clutch,brake and gear.

183
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,292
Don't panic.
-Clutch,brake and gear.

184
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,917
It'll be smooth...

185
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,958
Clutch,brake and gear.
It'll be smooth...

186
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,958
Clutch,brake and gear.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,042
Hey...
I can't.

188
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,750
I can't teach you.

189
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,583
See now.
-You'll ride!

190
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,167
Go...go...

191
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,583
Satish,the bike moves.

192
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,667
Sathish...
I've driven the bike.

193
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,333
Deva has driven the bike!

194
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,792
Has he learnt to drive the bike?

195
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:31,250
The astrologer has told lie.
-Satish...

196
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,417
The astrology didn't go wrong.

197
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:35,917
Oh no, my bike.

198
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:36,583
Oh no.
-Dude.

199
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,167
Good, the bike didn't fall in water.

200
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,375
Why smoke emanates?

201
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,292
Oh no...

202
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,083
Dude, save me...
-It's my fault...

203
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,833
...having given my bike.
It has turned arid.

204
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,917
Hey, dude...

205
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,417
He doesn't know
swimming also.

206
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,583
Sathish...

207
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,667
I'm coming.

208
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,208
Brother, my vehicle has gone kapoot...

209
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,292
Get lost.

210
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:01,250
Sir...lift please.
Sir...

211
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,458
Sir...Sir...Sir...

212
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:06,208
Sir,lift please.
We must go in.

213
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,250
Please,sir.

214
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,208
You'll be blessed,sir.

215
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:10,792
Go,stout!

216
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,667
Sir,thank you.

217
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,667
My dear friend.

218
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,417
Get him to hospital,

219
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,417
if you can, settle the bills too.

220
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,375
Where I'm?

221
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,333
Hey,Sathish.

222
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,167
Stop the bike.

223
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,417
Hey,police...

224
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,250
He is kidnapping me, police.

225
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,667
I'll knock you down
with the bike.

226
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,208
Hey, don't you have sense?
Will you ride so fast?

227
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,500
Who bought you the bike?
Call your parents.

228
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,833
Do you know the
value of my life?

229
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,958
Who'll spend, if fractured?

230
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,833
I'm shouting,
but you're doing exercise.

231
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,167
Hi!

232
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,292
Even if you're a girl, Can you drive
a two wheeler?

233
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,542
Buy a lady bird cycle and ride.

234
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,375
Don't you've the responsibility
of getting married?

235
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,208
If anything unexpected happens!
If anything goes wrong!

236
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh no,
Go away.

237
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,833
You leave me halfway.

238
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,833
Less tension, more work.

239
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:56,875
Two hundred rupees.

240
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,917
Card won't work.

241
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,417
A problem with the machine.
-Cash...

242
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,583
Brother,I didn't get cash.

243
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,542
I told you the card don't work.
Give the cash and go.

244
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,083
Why? Don't you open
your mouth.

245
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,375
You should've told earlier.

246
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,833
Give the cash and go.
-Do you know,who am I?

247
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,875
I'm in tension.

248
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,625
Hey,do you think of
flying a plane?

249
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,625
How dare you
hit with bike?

250
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,958
Buffaloes, are you blind?

251
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,000
Look how she agitates?

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,708
Hey,I'll thump your nose.
-Hit me here.

253
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,417
No,go away.

254
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,167
Go aside.
A fight scene will go on here.

255
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,500
Are you so confident?
-I'll thrash you.

256
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,375
Hey...

257
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,125
I'll hit your moss and mocker.

258
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,292
Hey,who is that?

259
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:39,417
You're the reason behind all the issues
going on from morning onwards.

260
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,375
Where are you going?

261
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,542
Come on...

262
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:44,875
What's your problem,
why do you torture me from morning?

263
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:49,125
I turn furious on seeing you.
I'll thrash you.

264
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,125
I'm in angst on you.
Shut up.

265
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,708
I say not to talk.

266
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,500
You...

267
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,083
You be quiet.
Now,it's my problem.

268
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,167
Brother has come.

269
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,333
Something serious business
might happen.

270
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:10,083
Brother,not knowing
that's a love matter...

271
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,292
...Our guys stretched their hands.

272
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,958
The knife is very sharp.

273
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,000
Superb pair!
-Thanks, brother.

274
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,958
Hey,take the vehicle.

275
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,542
You said,right?
-I didn't.

276
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,000
You only told them
to say so,tell me.

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
He said on his own.

278
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,417
Go away.
-A Good pair!

279
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:41,917
"What did you do,lass?"

280
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:46,500
"Like a child,
you made me to stand"

281
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:51,375
"What did you do,lass?"

282
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:55,667
"Like a child,
you made me to stand"

283
00:13:55,667 --> 00:14:00,083
"I articulated my heart,how I fall
in love when I saw you"

284
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:04,792
"I'll show you ever,the same
kind of love as today"

285
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:09,583
"I lost myself at every moment,
when I'm near to you"

286
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:14,083
"What did you do,lass?"

287
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,917
"Like a child,
you made me to stand"

288
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:46,250
" I have seen a competitive
rivalry to my mother"

289
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,958
"I have seen a rehearsal to
nod as a novelty to your words"

290
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,375
" I have seen a competitive
rivalry to my mother"

291
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:59,708
"I have seen a rehearsal to
nod as a novelty to your words"

292
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,917
"In the heart,
where you resides...resides..."

293
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,500
"I go around...around... you..."

294
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:13,417
"This night must extend a little
and that sun must sleep a little"

295
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:17,583
"I must tell hundreds of lies which
you never seen and heard of"

296
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,792
"What did you do,lass?"

297
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:27,083
"Like a child,
you made me to stand"

298
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:31,542
"I articulated my heart,how I fall
in love when I saw you"

299
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:36,167
"I'll show you ever,the same
kind of love as today"

300
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:40,833
"I lost myself at every moment,
when I'm near to you"

301
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:45,667
"What did you do,lass?"

302
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:50,208
"Like a child,
you made me to stand"

303
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,792
"What did you do,lass?"

304
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:59,792
"Like a child,
you made me to stand"

305
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,208
Greetings,madam.

306
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,833
Good morning, madam.
-Good morning.

307
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,750
Be seated.

308
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,042
If you sign the contract,
before auspicious time ends...

309
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,125
...We can start our work.

310
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,208
It's the lowest quoted tender,
which we got.

311
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,083
For 5 crores,madam.

312
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,375
Not only that,
they're the best.

313
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,833
Is it?
-Yes,madam.

314
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,167
Oh.

315
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,000
Stepney, pen.
-Yes,madam.

316
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:55,792
Madam, you're signing in
a wrong project.

317
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,208
I know,Mr.Raghu.

318
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,875
Which is right and wrong!

319
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,583
Stepney, submit these
files at office.

320
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
Ask him to get the
settlement and leave.

321
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,333
I've done by mistake,madam.

322
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,417
I'm working under you
for ten years, madam.

323
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,125
What's the use of it?

324
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,250
Being here for ten years,

325
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,250
you can't be loyal,Mr.Raghu.

326
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,792
I hate lies.

327
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,667
You can go.
-Madam,I'm sorry.

328
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,042
Stepney,
-Madam,I'm sorry.

329
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,667
Sir, please tell her.
-Come.

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,042
Go away.

331
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,667
Though your's is a small company,

332
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,625
you'll be loyal...

333
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,083
...so,I finalize this deal to you.

334
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,667
Sure,we'll do our best,madam.

335
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,375
He is not seen in any
of the hospitals in Pollachi.

336
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:37,875
Mom!

337
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,875
Where did you go?

338
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,708
He is like a lunatic...

339
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,375
Is he blabbering?

340
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,583
Has he come?

341
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,708
What? I'm asking you,
but you're silent.

342
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,417
Where is he?

343
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,042
He got cold.

344
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:54,708
Kept warm water
ready for him.

345
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,875
Tell him to take bath.

346
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,833
We'll dine together. Okay?
-Okay,mom.

347
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,333
It's tough to manage this generation.

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,583
Hey,where did you go?

349
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,750
You left the bike.

350
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,083
Couldn't see you throughout
the night.

351
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,417
You are not
attending the call.

352
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,417
I'm asking you,
but you keep on going...

353
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,917
Hello...

354
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:23,917
Who?

355
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:31,042
Hey, where is the husk water?
Only warm water is here.

356
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
Can't get anything.

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,375
Got anything?
-No, brother.

358
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:49,625
As I was standing long
at this side...

359
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,625
...feel numbness in legs.

360
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,083
So turned back.

361
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,375
Are you making me mad?

362
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,417
Brother,
Show that.

363
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,292
Brother, you're the
revolutionary lube in this locale.

364
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:03,958
A Savant!

365
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,833
You're everything,hereafter.

366
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,167
Is anything given
in writting?

367
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,208
Look here, brother.

368
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,500
Look what's this?

369
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,750
Free Medical camp.

370
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,125
How we are related to this?

371
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,292
Why are you asking like a goof?

372
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:19,167
Getting oldsters who lost eyes,
ears and tooth to this camp.

373
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:24,500
...and give medicines to them
as if you arranged the medical camp.

374
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,250
Then,in every house and street,
only your banner will be seen.

375
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,750
How about my idea,brother?

376
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,042
How is that idea?

377
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:33,875
Hey,lion cub!

378
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,375
You said right, dude.

379
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,125
Are the grannies,ready?
-Stop.

380
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,792
Come soon, don't delay
by doing make up.

381
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,667
Come...

382
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,417
Hold the umbrella for him.

383
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:50,667
Doctor,I have assembled
all the grannies.

384
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,792
It'll be good if you give
them an injection.

385
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,833
Everything is right.

386
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,125
Where is that?
-What?

387
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,833
Oh, is it?

388
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,250
You do a good job.
I'll do the best.

389
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,667
Animals!

390
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,375
Animals?

391
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,250
Brother,he tells as animals.

392
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,917
Just for a coke, he'll fall flat.
Why to bother?

393
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,167
Is that...?
I'll clear all the gases.

394
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,750
Animals.
-Is it animals or Andhra meals?

395
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,875
He must be given injection, first.

396
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,417
Doctor,put the injection there.

397
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:24,167
It's the injection for buffalo.
Look at the banner there.

398
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,750
Doctor,why did you get
other's banner?

399
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,125
The banner and the
medical camp is mine.

400
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,667
Is it?
Then,what about this?

401
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,167
Aanamalai
-Govt.Hr.sec school,

402
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,042
Pollachi,
-Free Medical camp.

403
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:36,833
That's it.

404
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,250
Then why do you bother
about injection?

405
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,333
Get that.

406
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,167
Read this.

407
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,000
Free Veterinary Medical Camp.

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Will you proceed with
a teared notice?

409
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,667
Don't you inquire?

410
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,500
Where did you get it?

411
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,292
From the tea shop.

412
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,083
You'll get only
bit papers there.

413
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,583
It's misunderstood.

414
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,000
It's better, if you proceed
with good injections...

415
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,375
... for these grannies.

416
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,917
That'll be a dignity to me.

417
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,583
Where,in prison?

418
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:06,542
What do you say,doctor?

419
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,333
Yes,if the veterinary injections
are used for them,they'll die.

420
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,625
Will you do post mortem?

421
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,083
Nurse...
-Doctor,

422
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,083
Get the box.
-Okay, doctor.

423
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:39,000
A song from film "I"

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,417
Get up.

425
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,417
Sorry, brother.
It was late.

426
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,833
A mistake has happened.

427
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,583
"RJ Voice"

428
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,625
You must come for sure.

429
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,958
You must come for sure.

430
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,875
You must come for sure.

431
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,542
Younger brother!

432
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,333
Elder brother!
-She hugged me.

433
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:06,208
She kissed me after
rolling around with me.

434
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,667
No one is here.

435
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,417
There is someone
with a cow.

436
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,417
Hello...
-Hello...

437
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,875
Brother.

438
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:28,625
What?

439
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,667
She stares as if,
he never saw her.

440
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,750
Is she the ice cube
who freezed him?

441
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,583
Come sure with your buffalo.

442
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,417
Do you know to drive
a two wheeler?

443
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,292
Shut up.
Come.

444
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,292
Come.

445
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,625
Dude,she is going.

446
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,750
Dude,
-She told me where to come.

447
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,833
She decided to take me
her under control.

448
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,083
What do you think?

449
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,167
How can you talk so?
-By mouth.

450
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,000
Don't talk to her like this.

451
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,500
It's like a worthless person
going around a berth.

452
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,417
A friend is the one who blindly
believes the tales at any time.

453
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,167
You mustn't be jealous.

454
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,292
Dude,you must see
her now,that's all.

455
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,708
We have seen.

456
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,833
Why are you here
as a crowd?

457
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:20,958
What do you blow?

458
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:21,750
What happened to the cow?

459
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,125
Sir, it's is not conceived
for five years.

460
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,875
Heard that it'll conceive,if it comes here.
-That's why...

461
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:28,208
I can only give medicine.
I can't help it.

462
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,167
Why it's draped with
colorful attire?

463
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,708
It got shivering
yesterday night.

464
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,792
Check the pulse.

465
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,958
Can't check the pulse.
Can see only it's uddar.

466
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,125
That's what I mean.

467
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,792
Where is the pulse and uddar is?

468
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,417
Girls, turn aside.

469
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,792
I'm telling you,
turn that side.

470
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,125
God, it's a male!

471
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:52,250
Hey, a male.
-Yes, Male.

472
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,000
You got a bull.

473
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,083
Not to this, sir.
For it's wife.

474
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,667
Wife...?

475
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,417
If the wife doesn't bear a child,
won't the husband go for a check up?

476
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,208
That's logic.

477
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,708
You mean,logic.

478
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:07,875
Thulasi,if the wife doesn't conceive,
it's okay to check up husband.

479
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,875
Is it applicable
to the bull also?

480
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,833
Is it in our theory?

481
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:14,958
Doctor,don't ashame us.
get in.

482
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,417
No,I just asked.
-Get in.

483
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:20,667
Less tension, More work.
More work,Less tension.

484
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,417
Go away.

485
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,000
Aunty,

486
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,667
Who are you?

487
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,042
At odd hours?

488
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,000
Is this Deva's house?
-Yes.

489
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,208
Is he there?
I must meet him.

490
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:34,583
She wants to meet you.

491
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,042
Mom, don't you hear
the whistle sound?

492
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:41,417
Sit down.

493
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:43,875
Who are they?

494
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,958
Whom they want to meet?
-You crazy!

495
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:48,792
Get lost.

496
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:50,417
Always accompanying him.

497
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,250
Hello.

498
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,208
Hello.

499
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:57,417
I came to meet you.

500
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,583
Me?

501
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,250
You don't know who I'm .

502
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,167
Don't tease.

503
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,042
Am I?

504
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,333
Don't irate me.

505
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,417
Will you come with me?

506
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:11,375
I'm very busy.

507
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:12,917
I'm very busy.

508
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:15,500
He is doing too much.

509
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,000
Do you have sense?

510
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,583
If they know I was roaming
around with you in bike...

511
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:21,375
What to do for that?

512
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:24,667
I came at night
to seek your help.

513
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,500
I can't.
You try someone.

514
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,958
What's that both
discuss about?

515
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,750
See,you're arranging the poultry,
herd of cows,flock of goats...

516
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,625
... tomorrow, for the camp.

517
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,958
Do we look like sheperds?

518
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,542
What's happening here?

519
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,625
A herd of cows and
flock of goats!

520
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,417
What?
-Let's leave.

521
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:46,375
Come...
-Bye aunty.

522
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,917
Come...
He is caught.

523
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,000
Mom... water.

524
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,833
Herd of cows and flock of goats!

525
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,708
Dude,where you got
these many animals from?

526
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,625
It's because of my kindness.
It's my duty.

527
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,000
No boundaries for your duty.

528
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,125
Goosebumps!
Come...

529
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,625
Come...
Come soon.

530
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,250
Flock of goats and
herd of cows?

531
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,042
You wouldn't have seen
in your lifetime.

532
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:24,417
Everyone either get a cow or goat
and learn the skills...

533
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,875
...in this medical camp.

534
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,417
Go fast...

535
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,125
What are you looking at?

536
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,500
Sir,don't talk harsh to womanhood.
I can't bear.

537
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,125
You can't bear.

538
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,500
I too can't bear.

539
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,958
Have you given the medicines?
-yes,sir.

540
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,083
Within three months,your life
will turn bright.

541
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:47,917
Don't worry.

542
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,583
What are you doing?

543
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,125
Whom are you searching for?

544
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,958
Just I'm looking...
-I understood.

545
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,250
Hi...

546
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,125
Had food?

547
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,333
Cows...Goats...Poultry

548
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,417
Thulasi!

549
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,875
It's too hot.
Will you wear the coolers?

550
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,833
A flower for Thulasi...

551
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:13,583
Thulasi...

552
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,917
Is that a chorus?

553
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,417
Are you afraid?

554
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,708
What did you think
when I fell on you?

555
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,083
I was admiring at you.

556
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:27,833
Then, what about this?

557
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:28,625
What?

558
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:29,958
My brother is giving
something with pity.

559
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,292
Take it.
-Pity?

560
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,292
It's my heart.

561
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,333
What's there inside?

562
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,917
I've confined my feelings in this.
See now.

563
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:38,833
Open it.

564
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,708
Nurse,get me the gloves.

565
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:41,833
Just a minute,sir.

566
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,833
Just a minute,
Dear...darling...

567
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,000
I packed that throughout
the night.

568
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,250
Just see it once.

569
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:47,958
Aah,a gift.

570
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,167
I'll give this to my girlfriend.

571
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,583
Brother,the gift is missing.

572
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,750
You too...

573
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,292
Who'll take that?

574
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,833
Why are you dubious on us?

575
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,625
That cheap gift
must be here only.

576
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,208
Search it.

577
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,208
Is it a cheap one?

578
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,542
It's my life, search it.

579
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,333
Chocolate?

580
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,542
It's success.

581
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,042
Then,why you need a gift?

582
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,208
I'm jealous.

583
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,333
We'll enjoy happily.

584
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,250
What's that?
-A gift.

585
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,625
I don't want.

586
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,792
If you have a work,
I must help.

587
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,375
After that,I'm not of use?

588
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,167
Don't you have a heart?

589
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,167
No.

590
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,292
With a great difficulty...

591
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:39,750
Where to search?
-Brother,gift!

592
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,417
Okay...

593
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,417
Chocolate!

594
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,375
You'll like.

595
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:51,250
You hit me?

596
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,667
Good,no one here.

597
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,625
Less tension,more work.

598
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:00,708
Take it.

599
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,333
What's that?
-A gift.

600
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,333
Honeybee...

601
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,792
Not honey bee.
It's love.

602
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,333
Thank you very much.

603
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,292
Watchman...

604
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,375
It's not that
I'll get you next week.

605
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,167
No.
-Sir,listen to me.

606
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,042
Take that.

607
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,875
Why are you here?

608
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,083
What?
Go...

609
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,667
Thank you.
-Okay.

610
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,208
Shall I leave?

611
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,917
I'll leave.
-Go.

612
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:35,208
Brother, again the gift has
gone from our hand.

613
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,917
I must somehow take the gift.

614
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,083
I ought to gift
my angel of love.

615
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:41,667
Bullshit.

616
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:44,167
He is listening everything.

617
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,042
Where is that drunkard?

618
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,417
He is here.
-Yes,go...

619
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:53,458
Will she come,
asking for animals?

620
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,458
Will you get all
the cows and goats?

621
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,917
I have to be awake
throughout the night.

622
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,958
You made me
to take cow dung.

623
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,792
I'll ask for justice.

624
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:08,917
I'll take the bike and
see, what I'll do to her?

625
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,125
Hey,move aside.

626
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,750
I must go with the gift,
even if it turns dawn.

627
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:19,667
Just a minute.

628
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:26,083
We'll buy a small gift,
packed with colour paper...

629
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,917
...and when you give
that to sister-in-law,

630
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,167
Will she deny?

631
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:34,292
It's very shameful to do
high and low jumps.

632
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,750
We can't bear.

633
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,875
Do you know
what she said?

634
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,708
What she said?
-Give respect.

635
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:40,958
That's more important.

636
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:45,417
I must meet you with
the first gift you bought for me.

637
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:46,958
Though Mount Himalayas
comes in our way...

638
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,667
...we have to cross that.
Come let's go.

639
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:49,917
No one can change your fate.

640
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,792
Why it's dark?
-This side...

641
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,750
Whom do you say?
-This side, boss.

642
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,708
Oh,this way.

643
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:55,583
Dude,

644
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,583
I'll ask her.

645
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,542
You take care,
if any problem arises.

646
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,667
Dude,why did you push me?

647
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,292
Who are you?

648
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:09,000
Thulasi's friend?
Stand aside.

649
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,208
You follow me silently.
-Why did you stop?

650
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,125
If we search together,
it's waste of time.

651
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,208
We'll design a master plan
and search separately.

652
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,042
Yes, boss.

653
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,750
I'll get you into trap.

654
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,542
After a long time...

655
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,500
Tomorrow is "New moon day".

656
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,083
I'll open up you tomorrow,okay?

657
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,667
I'll come with the gift only.

658
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,083
That gift...

659
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,458
Oh, you've come here too.

660
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,583
You...

661
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:45,833
Greetings...

662
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:51,208
Oh no... I can manage the men,

663
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,792
but it's horrible with women.

664
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,250
Just wait,I'll come.

665
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,542
Won't you allow
a person to take drinks?

666
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,125
Drinks?
-You won't leave for....

667
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,125
Who're they?

668
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,458
They're your clan.
Why are you afraid?

669
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,708
Don't come out with makeup.
It's awful.

670
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:10,333
Why did you shout?
-I caught a thief,sir.

671
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,458
Villangam, you!

672
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,333
Sir...

673
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:17,417
Let it be.
Why did you do so?

674
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:19,208
Sir, let it be.

675
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,125
You must inquire him.

676
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,333
We jumped over
the wall, I agree.

677
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,333
But,why they must jump?

678
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,208
It's right!

679
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,625
Why did you come so?

680
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,167
We came out for a walk.

681
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
When he jumped over the wall,
we came behind him.

682
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,292
We must guard the young girls,
who has come here.

683
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,708
You guard them!

684
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:41,083
Dude,I understood why and
how did you come?

685
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,250
But,when you speak,
you can't get the dialogues.

686
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,333
What do you want to say?

687
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,000
Don't say anything.
I understood.

688
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,125
Now, everyone leave from here.
Go away...

689
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,292
Listen, remove the
make up and get in.

690
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,167
Go...

691
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,792
Sir, your hands are shivering.

692
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:54,875
My hands and legs are shivering.
Yes.

693
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,292
We'll come after finishing
everything,sir.

694
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,292
What can I do?
It's all because of him.

695
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:02,000
Be respectful to women.

696
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,792
Are you so respectful?

697
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:04,625
Get lost.

698
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,500
Sorry... sorry...

699
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:53,583
A Wright!

700
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:59,208
You disturbed me and left.

701
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,917
You...

702
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,917
I have no idea
of attending the camp.

703
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,458
For you,
I came to your locale.

704
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,500
Hey, didn't you sleep?

705
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,458
"If Miss gets missed,
she will be as Mrs."

706
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,792
"Kiss, when kissed
enters Guinness".

707
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,125
"The blabbering becomes English",

708
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:39,250
"This song,will trend
in social media".

709
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,917
"Come to the fore,you the petty thief...
The fragrance of jasmine comes abaft."

710
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:07,542
"With your amla like eyes,
you provoked me."

711
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:18,542
"With sharp wedged words,
you snuff me."

712
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:22,125
"The love,as soft as the petal of a flower,
You've latched me in your soul."

713
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:29,417
"You come as you're...come as you're...
Lift me up...raise me up..."

714
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:33,042
"I'm so crazy on you."

715
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:36,750
"I'm obeying you in all sorts."

716
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,208
"The feud is not with words,"

717
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:43,625
"The feud is to hug you,with love."

718
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:09,583
"I have grown up for you,
I'm so beautious,"

719
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,792
"If I come close,you go far..."

720
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:16,792
"Hey,you have risen up, I'm so disciplined..."

721
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:20,167
"You search for the rainbow
with closed eyes."

722
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:23,792
"You touch my heart and bang me."

723
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:27,208
"Bull fight,hereafter in bed..."

724
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:31,000
"Touching my hands and legs,"

725
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,500
"Wrestling, hereafter in bed..."

726
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,250
"You're the only one, dearest of dear."
"It's enough, if you give me now"

727
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,167
"Hey,take me on the whole,
I have given you myself."

728
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,875
"Come dear, you are my wife,
you're the ring of love,"

729
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:49,458
"If you are not with me,
I'll be in sedation my dear,"

730
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:53,083
"Come,my dear...
Come on,my dear..."

731
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:56,708
"My soul is filled with you."

732
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,917
"The eagled eye lass,
you're chipping my heart."

733
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:11,458
"The lass with a mole of
mustard size, you tear my soul."

734
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:15,208
"The lad with lovable words,
you seduced me to fall for you."

735
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:18,542
"You make me so cool,
you seduced me to fall for you."

736
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:22,167
"All my desires which are accumulated, "

737
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:25,583
"Shall I give all those
gathered as honey?"

738
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:29,167
"Shall I express all my needs?"

739
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:32,792
"Shall I sting you like a honeybee?"

740
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,333
"I have become a novelty,next to you."

741
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:40,333
"I'll breathe,inhaling the air from your soul."

742
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:44,000
"Come,my dear...
Come on,my dear..."

743
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,625
"I'm your everything, cool my soul..."

744
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:51,208
"Come,my dear...
Come on, my dear..."

745
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,625
"My soul is filled with you."

746
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:58,500
"Come to the fore,you the petty thief...
The fragrance of jasmine comes abaft."

747
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,167
"With your amla like eyes,
you provoked me."

748
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,792
"With sharp wedged words,you snuff me."

749
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:09,417
"The love,as soft as the petal of a flower,
You've latched me in your soul."

750
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:13,000
"I'm so crazy on you."

751
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,708
"I'm obeying you in all sorts."

752
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:20,333
"The feud is not with words,"

753
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,958
"The feud is to hug you,with love."

754
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:27,625
"Come dear,you are my wife,
you're the ring of love,"

755
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:31,250
"If you are not with me,
I'll be in sedation my dear,"

756
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:38,708
"You come as you're...come as you're...
Lift me up...raise me up..."

757
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,542
Boss...

758
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,333
Buffalo,I'm going
at a speed of 140km.

759
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,083
You might've shattered like a
pumpkin broken on new moon day.

760
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,625
You must be the
only person who drive...

761
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,917
...in 140km speed in a halted car.

762
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,583
If you go on like this,
it'll take 20 years to learn.

763
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,208
Boss,Thulasi.

764
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,875
Why she goes in a hurry?

765
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,583
There must be some stuff.

766
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,542
Come,let's overhear what happens.

767
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,250
Move aside.

768
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,292
Mom!
-Thulasi.

769
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,125
Mindless.
Wait.

770
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,333
Mom, how are you?

771
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,208
I'm fine.
How are you?

772
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,500
I'm superb,mom.

773
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,958
Okay,how was your trip?

774
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:29,542
Good. I enjoyed the most.

775
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:31,542
I missed you badly.

776
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,875
I too missed you badly.

777
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,875
I have a surprise for you.

778
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:41,292
Boss,it's interesting!

779
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:43,292
Is my family matter interesting to you?
-That is...

780
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,333
Shut your trap and listen.

781
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,583
You mean, surprise?

782
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,542
Anything special?
-yes.

783
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:48,875
Muruga...

784
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,875
You open this.

785
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,583
He is the only son of KV mills.

786
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:05,208
I wish to settle this marriage.

787
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,083
How tyranny it is!

788
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,625
She didn't even show me
the photo.

789
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:12,833
Wait.

790
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,292
No,mom.

791
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,125
I...

792
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:17,458
What Thulasi?

793
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,333
I...I love a person.

794
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:23,583
What? Love?

795
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:24,917
Ask her.

796
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:26,917
I thought of telling you.
-If you don't ask now,it'll heighten.

797
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:30,583
I don't like this love.
-yes,only a few are successful.

798
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,292
Be seated,boss.

799
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,292
You too have rights.
-Hey,you be quite.

800
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,833
Are you going to college
to fall in love?

801
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:37,000
Ask her to marry the groom
of her mother's choice...

802
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,333
... and be happy.
-yes.

803
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,792
No one need to talk.

804
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:42,083
Is he a trustworthy person?

805
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,333
Definitely, he is well and good.

806
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,208
Suitable for our family.

807
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,125
You'll like him very much.

808
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,125
Better,meet him once.

809
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:53,292
He won't be a liar, isn't it?
-yes,mom.

810
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:54,417
Please,mom.

811
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,292
Just meet him once
for my sake,mom.

812
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:57,167
Please,mom.

813
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:58,875
Have patience.

814
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,250
Your happiness is mine!

815
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,583
Thank you mom.

816
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,042
Ask him to come.

817
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,458
I must meet him.
-Sure,mom.

818
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,000
Okay, mom.

819
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:08,875
We'll go back to our job.

820
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,083
Boss,she accepts the
love marriage.

821
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,167
You are dumb.

822
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,792
Will you be the
head of the family...

823
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:14,875
...only in government records?

824
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,042
Yes,I'm there,
isn't it?

825
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:17,292
Why are you so?

826
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:18,417
Be quiet.

827
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,542
Look there.

828
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,833
One of my friend
owned a driving school.

829
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:25,417
When I went to meet him,
he left to see a bride.

830
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:30,625
The lass who came there
resembled actress,Devyani.

831
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,333
When I was thinking
to convey my love,

832
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,583
My good time, she came
forward to say the same.

833
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,667
Then our love was branched out
around trees and blossomed ...

834
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,417
...as a garden in Pollachi.

835
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,500
Her parents came to
know and it fumed.

836
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,792
Atlast,it end up
in marriage!

837
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,875
Then, hurriedly I became
a father.

838
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,667
Suddenly,her father
got chest pain.

839
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,125
When I called my wife
and informed her,

840
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,792
She told me to get him
to hospital by car.

841
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,500
I asked how do I know
to drive the car?

842
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,875
Meanwhile,her father got
cardiac arrest.

843
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:05,833
My wife knows only then,
that I don't know to drive the car.

844
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,208
She started to drive me
from then on...

845
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:35,875
Mom, you are good in massage,
nowadays.

846
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,333
I came without
informing my mom,

847
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,333
If she see us,that's the
end of our story.

848
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,208
What's happening here?

849
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,458
We are doing rehearsal,aunty.

850
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:56,583
Get up.

851
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,125
Mom.

852
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:59,167
You mean,rehearsal?
Aunty?

853
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:01,292
What's this?

854
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,917
She is going to be
Our daughter- in-law...

855
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,000
...that's what she says as aunt.

856
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,500
He talks so confusing.

857
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,167
My dear,my darling!

858
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,167
Nothing.

859
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,292
What's this?

860
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:22,625
Aunty,you must speak
to my mom ...

861
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:23,625
...and make our marriage happen.

862
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,167
Yes, mom.

863
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:26,167
Please, aunt...

864
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:30,833
You're saying something, I will do.
-Mom agreed!

865
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:31,750
She didn't say anything still.

866
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:34,667
Good mom!

867
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,000
Instead of driving
the car on the road,

868
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,792
They drove on the fields.
Plenty of cow dung.

869
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:43,042
Bereft about son-in-law,
I'm cleaning my car.

870
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,125
The entire cow dung
is on our car.

871
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,875
Boss,clean it soon.

872
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,750
It'll be a shame when son-in-law
family comes.

873
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,292
Watch, they may come.

874
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,333
Boss,
-What?

875
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,208
They've come.

876
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:56,667
It's like you voluntarily
invited them.

877
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,458
Can't you tell before.
I'm looking grimy.

878
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,708
Do you have a physique
of going under that?

879
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:05,542
Am I looking grandeur?
-Welcome...

880
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,875
We're waiting for you only.

881
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,542
Welcome.

882
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,708
Driver,
-He is calling you.

883
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:14,792
Go.

884
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,333
Driver.
-You go and sit inside.

885
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,958
Get in.
-Driver feels irk.

886
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,958
Take coffee and snacks.

887
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,375
We'll eat.

888
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,917
Do I irk?

889
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:27,542
Am I a driver?
When did I tell so?

890
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,250
Good pair of myself
and the car.

891
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,083
I'm striving because of you.

892
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:33,500
Be seated.

893
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,042
Haven't they seen
a big house ever!

894
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,125
Swirling around.

895
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,917
The house looks superb.
-Don't talk,mom.

896
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:43,833
Have you come to see
the house or the bride?

897
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,083
Both.

898
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:55,292
Aunty zoom in somewhere.
Is that?

899
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,500
It's good to explain.

900
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,292
I know what you
think about.

901
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:04,083
Why they're as a pair in all
except this one, isn't it?

902
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:08,875
When you entered the house,
the one who was...

903
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,167
... cleaning the car was
the husband of our Madam.

904
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,208
Why must he clean the car?

905
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,500
He did such a deed.

906
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,708
He got married hiding
the truth that...

907
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:18,958
... he doesn't know to
drive the car.

908
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:22,708
The rift which started
on that day, still continues.

909
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,792
Welcome...

910
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:25,750
Greetings!
-Greetings!

911
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,208
I was busy with work.

912
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,083
What are you talking about?

913
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,917
I was talking in praise
of you,boss.

914
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,167
You? About me?

915
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,375
I promise,boss.

916
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,333
Disguised as owner?

917
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:40,250
Madam has come.

918
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,458
Greetings.
-Greetings.

919
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:50,292
Hello.

920
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:52,167
It seems they haven't seen
the coffee and snacks earlier.

921
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,458
Look here, don't talk
about children...

922
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:56,333
...and other sentiments
to me.

923
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,375
Though he knows, I hate
people speaking lies, he did that.

924
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,083
If you talk about this,
you may lose the job.

925
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,292
Sorry, in-law.

926
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:08,125
I never like telling lies.

927
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:10,208
I will whip them
to the core.

928
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:14,708
I'm habitual of fulfilling
my daughter's wishes.

929
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:15,875
That's okay.

930
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:17,625
The car...

931
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,708
Don't worry.

932
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,042
Madam will buy the
luxurious car for your son.

933
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:24,417
Not that,
My son...

934
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:29,333
All the accessories and
parts will be perfect.

935
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:29,917
Stepney.

936
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,625
It's enough, if you know to drive
and have a license.

937
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,542
I'm not saying it for pride.

938
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,458
The whole expense of
the marriage is mine.

939
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,333
From pre wedding rituals
to first night...

940
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,208
... everything will be the best.

941
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,958
Stepney.
-It's enough, if you come.

942
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,667
But? That is...

943
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,833
I'm little bit late
from Pooja.

944
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:48,500
Then?

945
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,375
Has the bridegroom
family arrived?

946
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,750
Oh,is he the bridegroom?

947
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:56,292
A suitable bridegroom
for our family.

948
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,750
He is the reason for
admitting...

949
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,958
...my daughter on time in the hospital.

950
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:08,792
He drove the ambulance fine.

951
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,375
The fact is...

952
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:11,958
Our hero who accompanied
his friend has to...

953
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:15,708
...get down by the driver seat,
as other door was struck.

954
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,292
The priest saw that and
still is in belief...

955
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,542
...that our hero is the driver.

956
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,625
Will he drive an ambulance?

957
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,917
They'll let me in bidding.

958
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,500
It's like a going for a harvest
and getting an ox.

959
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,167
You meet her and tell
that you don't know...

960
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:38,625
...to drive the car.
Go...

961
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:39,208
Mom.

962
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:40,875
Go.

963
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,833
Mom,better you talk.

964
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,958
She made her husband
to clean the car.

965
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:48,542
What's the assurance
that she won't let him...

966
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:49,542
...to clean the doorpost
and do pattern casting.

967
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:50,375
Okay,mom.

968
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,458
He can learn car driving,
isn't it?

969
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:53,417
If something happens then?

970
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:55,417
Go...My son is
important to me.

971
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,042
If not her,
some other one.

972
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,542
Go...

973
00:47:59,250 --> 00:47:59,542
Mom

974
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:02,375
You too.
-Tell her something.

975
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,500
She is only calling.

976
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,333
Hey,the phone continously
rings from night.

977
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,375
Attend the call.
Get up.

978
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,208
He kills us.

979
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,208
Mom grinds by mixie,
she grinds by phone.

980
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:51,708
They won't let me.

981
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:54,167
What's this love?

982
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:58,625
Hey,is it a must
to attend your call?

983
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,333
You are calling
continuously.

984
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:03,292
See,what I will do?

985
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:04,958
Thulasi...

986
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:06,500
What do you think
of yourself?

987
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,042
Can't you attend the call?

988
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:10,292
I'm in an urgent work.

989
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,833
I didn't do on accord,
I will call you.

990
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,542
What other work you have?

991
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:18,375
I told you,I'm going
to Madurai in urgency.

992
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,542
Are you going to Madurai,
really?

993
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:22,625
Am I telling you lie?

994
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,875
Hey,keep quite.

995
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:26,208
Am I telling you lie?
I'm going to Madurai.

996
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,708
Dude,
-What?

997
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:28,750
Look there.

998
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,708
Yes.

999
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,792
Thulasi...

1000
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,292
How come you are here?

1001
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,417
Why did you tell lies?

1002
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:39,917
Why did you avoid me?

1003
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:41,417
Is it so easy
for you as...

1004
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:42,458
...my mother accepted
this marriage?

1005
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:45,000
Tell...
why did you lie?

1006
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,667
Thulasi...

1007
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,625
Tell me, why do you avoid me?
-I will tell you.

1008
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,542
Why do you avoid me?

1009
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,250
You tell her,at least.

1010
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,333
Thulasi...

1011
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:56,167
No, don't take weapons.
It's sharp and close to me.

1012
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,500
Patience...

1013
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,542
For the inflation in price,
can we cook rice?

1014
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,375
Why didn't you
attend my call?

1015
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,333
Leave my son!

1016
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:07,792
He doesn't know
to drive the car.

1017
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,417
You don't know?

1018
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,042
Oh,god!

1019
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:23,500
You spoilt everything.

1020
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,292
How can I tell my mother?

1021
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:26,333
Where did you
let me to say?

1022
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,333
You decided on your own,
that I can drive a car.

1023
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,292
What now? You don't know
to drive the car.

1024
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:37,125
But, somehow you must
learn to drive the car.

1025
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:37,792
Okay?

1026
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:40,375
Astrology?
-Aunty, you don't talk.

1027
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:42,917
Get lost.

1028
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,000
Dude,forget everything
and take drinks.

1029
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,167
Is the side dish
okay for you?

1030
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:53,250
Hey dude,

1031
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,417
Hey...

1032
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:58,875
Drinks,side dish...

1033
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:01,500
He is in sad mood.

1034
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:02,833
Sad mood?

1035
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:04,708
Are you thinking that
I'm taking drinks happily?

1036
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,250
No,taking drinks as
I'm struck between...

1037
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,250
...the car and the love.

1038
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,750
Dude, I heard. I was out
of station for few days...

1039
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,875
...many things has happened.

1040
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:12,833
What's your problem?

1041
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:14,250
You must learn
to drive the car...

1042
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,208
...and you mustn't feel
ashame in locale,that's all?

1043
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,000
He thinks a lot...

1044
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,333
We have come.
Vanangamudi, will take care.

1045
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,250
Brother,Vanangamudi.
-Greetings!

1046
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,167
For what you are here?
-I'm Deva.

1047
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:51,542
Regarding a business matter.

1048
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,625
Let it be,
an important matter.

1049
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:57,125
Come, let's drink and discuss.

1050
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:58,292
No brother.we don't have
tea and coffee.

1051
00:51:58,292 --> 00:51:59,333
Don't you have
tea and coffee?

1052
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,000
What do you say,
at this place?

1053
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,167
We are from the generation
of giving...

1054
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:04,708
...the family deity,a
roll of tobacco and liquor.

1055
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,375
Cheers!
-Cheers!

1056
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,917
Your side dish is different.
Taste is good, brother.

1057
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:20,542
It's not taste,it's the twist
happened in my life.

1058
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:21,792
What?

1059
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:23,500
I'll tell that tales later.

1060
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,958
Tell me for what
purpose you are here?

1061
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,458
He loves a girl.

1062
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:30,917
He might have a
flash back it seems.

1063
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,625
If you help the pair in love
by giving your car...

1064
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:40,708
...a statue may be erected in Marina
for you in future.

1065
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:43,458
A statue?

1066
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,958
A statue?

1067
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,125
Dude,already
he looks the same.

1068
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,000
We'll erect him a statue.

1069
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,208
What do you think about?

1070
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,250
Brother, just a
single condition.

1071
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,958
You must come on 16th
to meet me...

1072
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,333
...as the way you
have come now.

1073
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,000
If not?

1074
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:01,500
Don't be negative.

1075
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,125
You must come with the car.

1076
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:05,417
What's specific on 16th?

1077
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:06,542
Come on...

1078
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:11,917
Brother,it's the day of my life,
whirled like tsunami.

1079
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:15,542
On my marriage day,along
with my wife Padmini...

1080
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:18,833
...a Padmini car was given
to me as dowry.

1081
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,542
As I don't know
to drive the car...

1082
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:24,250
...I appointed a driver.

1083
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:33,375
Instead of driving the car,
he eloped with my wife.

1084
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:34,958
So many problems to you?

1085
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:39,125
So,I will keep this car
good throughout the year...

1086
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:41,875
... except on 16th of December,
where I'll bang the car,

1087
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:45,750
on the day they eloped.
-Who is that, brother?

1088
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:49,667
Ten years before, here a person
from China listened...

1089
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:54,167
...my story and took a film
and became a billionaire.

1090
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:55,292
A good twist.

1091
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:01,208
But,I never missed a year
to bang this car.

1092
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:04,333
That's why I've kept this condition.

1093
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,375
I won't spare you,if this car
doesn't come on 16th.

1094
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:11,083
I'll be hard.

1095
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,542
I don't know whether these
guys understood or not,I did.

1096
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:18,542
Whether 16th comes or not,
this car will definitely be here.

1097
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,542
Brother...

1098
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,000
How much agony in you?

1099
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:29,208
Sir...

1100
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:30,708
Don't disturb me when driving.
-What do you do?

1101
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:31,875
I'm driving.

1102
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:35,125
The car moves only when
you take the leg from clutch.

1103
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,417
Car moves...
-Is it?

1104
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:43,125
That's the brake.

1105
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:46,083
Will you drive the car
by looking down?

1106
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,500
Hey, do you want me
to drive or not?

1107
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,917
Should you get
marry or not?

1108
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:51,292
I should.

1109
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:52,167
Shut your trap.

1110
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:54,458
Why are you making him tensed?

1111
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,125
Two lives are in your hands.

1112
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,375
Do you hit me,
in the name of teaching?

1113
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:00,958
Look now...

1114
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,625
Why did you apply
the brake now?

1115
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,833
I just checked
whether brake works?

1116
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,458
I'll go mad.

1117
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:11,958
Are you hurt?
-Go.

1118
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:15,875
See now...

1119
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Get down.
Let's see,what happened.

1120
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:40,875
Dude.

1121
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:43,542
I thought of this ill omen
when starting.

1122
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:49,042
LIft her.
Aunty.

1123
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:50,792
Open your eyes.
Aunty.

1124
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,708
My aunty!

1125
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,542
You're dead!

1126
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,750
Hey dude,before the problem
turns worst...

1127
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,292
...call and tell her.

1128
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,625
Not now.

1129
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,625
Who have parked this car?

1130
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,167
Doctor is coming,
take away the car.

1131
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:22,417
Take that and keep aside.

1132
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,375
Everyone hints at me
in midst of many problems.

1133
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,167
Don't hesitate,
you tell her.

1134
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,375
Will it work out?
-yes. Call now.

1135
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,167
You say...

1136
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,625
My mother met
with an accident.

1137
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:39,583
She is admitted in emergency.
I'm very panic.

1138
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:40,958
I'm going there.
-Thulasi.

1139
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:42,042
You come soon.
-Thulasi.

1140
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,833
She is admitted in GH.

1141
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,667
You can caress him later.
We'll see mother.

1142
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,875
Why did you hang up
the call without speaking?

1143
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,458
She says everything,
which I must say.

1144
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:51,917
She calls me to hospital.

1145
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:54,875
Dude, car is safe.

1146
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:57,750
Let's escape now.
-You got us into trouble.

1147
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,792
As you said,
you'll teach me to drive.

1148
00:56:58,792 --> 00:56:59,750
All the problems
are because of you.

1149
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,375
Don't talk. It's because
of you only.

1150
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,208
Have you admitted
Rajeswari Madam?

1151
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:03,875
Come...

1152
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,250
Let's escape.

1153
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,167
Where do you go?
Come here.

1154
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:12,250
Good morning.

1155
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:14,583
Has the doctor been to that ward?
-Yes, doctor.

1156
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,708
Have you shifted the
patient in this ward?

1157
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,500
I'll check, doctor.

1158
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,083
Oh no, aunt!

1159
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,667
Why do you stand there?
Come...

1160
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,792
Madam, can you recall
what happened...

1161
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,208
... at the accident spot?

1162
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:37,042
It'll be easier to trace them.
-Get in.

1163
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:37,875
Please...
-That is...

1164
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,583
Sir,have you started?
-That is...

1165
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:43,417
Let us do our duty,sir.
-Doctor,it's also a duty.

1166
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:44,625
You tell me,madam.

1167
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,083
Think well and say.

1168
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,750
It'll be helpful
to trace them.

1169
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:49,667
That was...

1170
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,250
That's an old padmini car.

1171
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,000
She remembers intact.

1172
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,542
Who are these three persons?

1173
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:59,208
They only admitted her in hospital.
-Is it?

1174
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:04,750
Son-in-law, was it you?

1175
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,000
Yes...

1176
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,292
Thank you very much.
-Son-in-law?

1177
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:13,083
Yes,he is going to
marry my daughter.

1178
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,375
Hello sir...

1179
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:17,250
Fine,he did good job.

1180
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,542
Anyway,All the best.

1181
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,583
Thank you, sir.

1182
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,833
Madam,if I sack the person
who made this accident...

1183
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,167
...I'll rap his knuckles.

1184
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:32,042
I doubt these
three persons, sir.

1185
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,292
I'll take care of that.

1186
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:37,542
Madam, you take rest.
I'll see.

1187
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,625
You three were present
at the accident spot.

1188
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,458
No sir.

1189
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:51,542
He is the villan to Deva.

1190
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:56,833
Mom,what happened?

1191
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,958
Nothing to worry.

1192
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,750
Son-in-law only saved me.

1193
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:03,625
Deva,when did you
come here?

1194
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,167
He only admitted me
in the hospital.

1195
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,333
He didn't utter when I called.

1196
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,833
Madam,what happened?

1197
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:12,875
A big bandage in the leg.

1198
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:15,667
How it happened?

1199
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,167
I'll bang them.
Tell me,madam.

1200
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:19,250
How,tell me madam.
I can't bear.

1201
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,208
Go...

1202
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,042
You act as if studied
in an institute.

1203
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:23,917
Shut your trap.

1204
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:33,250
Hey, shut the phone off.

1205
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,792
Hey,who is playing
that song?

1206
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,708
That's the ring tone,sir.

1207
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:41,542
Switch it off,first.
-yes,sir.

1208
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:42,708
How did they come here?

1209
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:44,250
Son-in-law, how come
you be here?

1210
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,833
He only admitted mom
in hospital.

1211
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,917
If you've seen her
before ten minutes...

1212
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:50,417
...you might've took her to
hospital before the accident.

1213
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:51,583
Stepney...

1214
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:57,458
Son-in-law,Why did you go
to the accident spot?

1215
00:59:57,458 --> 01:00:00,375
When I was back from
my Karate class...

1216
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:01,458
...I saw an accident.

1217
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,958
When looked closely,
aunt was there.

1218
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,208
Immediately, I took her
to the hospital.

1219
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,083
Are you going to
Karate class?

1220
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:10,917
Yes, Son-in-law knows
all the martial arts.

1221
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,792
Tell everything which comes
to your mind.

1222
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:13,917
But, your physique
don't look like that.

1223
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:16,083
Uncle,You can't witness
my physique.

1224
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:18,208
Just inquire the one I hit.

1225
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,583
Will the one who banged know?

1226
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,750
Wait... Why do you feel irk?

1227
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,083
She got hurt.

1228
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:29,625
He can't bear the sufferings
of aunt.

1229
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,792
He is reacting more.
-Isn't it a hospital?

1230
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:33,417
This isn't a hospital?

1231
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:35,833
All go out.
-Go out.

1232
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,167
She tells you too,
come out.

1233
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:40,542
Come.
-Go...

1234
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:41,833
You too, come.

1235
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:43,792
Aren't you coming,boss?

1236
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:44,708
It's enough,go...

1237
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,875
Just a minute.

1238
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:53,083
Are you going to give her medicines?
-yes,sir.

1239
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,750
Whatever medicine,you better
give by injection.

1240
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,042
Not as pills.

1241
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:59,750
It's hard for her to
swallow the pills.

1242
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:01,917

01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:04,417
Thanks,Deva.
-For what?

1244
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,208
For admitting mom in hospital.
-Can I bear,if anything happens to her?

1245
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,542
He is doing romance,
amidst the ongoing problems.

1246
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:15,667
Oh no,Vanangamudi is calling.
-Is he?

1247
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:20,750
If i say about vanagamudi,
he won't listen.

1248
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,000
Come,we'll manage.

1249
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,792
I'll teach you all the
martial and sport activities.

1250
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:29,208
But,you mustn't use that
on me after marriage,okay?

1251
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:35,083
What a pair?

1252
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,250
He looks like a cheat.
You say as a good pair?

1253
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,167
Call Villangam.

1254
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:42,417
Hello...
Hi dude,

1255
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:45,083
It seems to be
an unknown number.

1256
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:48,208
Yes,the number is unknown,
but I'm known to you.

1257
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,625
You're well known...

1258
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:55,417
Nothing, hiccups hasn't stopped
still I'm away from my car.

1259
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:57,917
Everything will be fine,
If I see the car once.

1260
01:01:57,917 --> 01:01:59,083
She is my wife.

1261
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:02,417
Bro, she is not only your wife,
but to all.

1262
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:03,083
What!

1263
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,833
Don't mistake, has the
hiccups stopped?

1264
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:07,917
Yes,thank you.

1265
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,958
Dude, I sleep hugging my car.

1266
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,500
And in anger I'll bang that.

1267
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,083
I shared the feelings.

1268
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:18,667
I like your feelings,cool.

1269
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:19,833
Thanks dude.

1270
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,042
Hello,Don wants to
speak to you.

1271
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:24,958
Don? Who is that?
-On the speaker.

1272
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,833
Villangam,Have to stop.

1273
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,875
Stop everything.

1274
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:33,000
Can't stop.

1275
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,083
It flows like a broken pipe.

1276
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:40,792
The doctor who saw
this has become tired.

1277
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:42,750
Why doctor feels
tired for him?

1278
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,875
Really,he was in toilet,

1279
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:47,250
Yes,what do you talk about?

1280
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,500
What do you say about?

1281
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,750
I'm saying about myself.

1282
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,083
My life is in perils.
I'm saying about that.

1283
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:55,458
I didn't ask your sorrowful tales.
But worried about myself.

1284
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,583
I don't know how.

1285
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,458
A worthless guy plans
to be my son-in-law.

1286
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:00,583
It must be stopped.

1287
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,083
He belongs to your locale.

1288
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,250
What? My locale?
Who?

1289
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:06,208
Deva.

1290
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:09,417
Deva...

1291
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,000
Why do you react
like actor,Suriya?

1292
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,667
It's unbearable.
Don't shake the phone.

1293
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:16,667
Don, this enemity is from
the ages of "Thalapathi(Film)".

1294
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,458
It's not your operation,

1295
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:22,250
My one man operation.

1296
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,083
Finish it off.

1297
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,458
Deva...

1298
01:03:27,042 --> 01:03:29,833
It has started again.

1299
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:33,000
How to extract mosambi juice?

1300
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,625
First, you must
squeeze well.

1301
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:40,958
Dude, not that,you must
squeeze well after rolling.

1302
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,083
Only then, you'll get more juice.

1303
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:46,958
Oh no...In-law, how this stance for you?

1304
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,917
You was walking around
like a queen, pity on you!

1305
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:52,208
Who hit you so?

1306
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,042
Only your son.

1307
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:58,708
If my son is here at this
moment, he'll take care of you.

1308
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,500
Is it important?

1309
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:04,208
I known well about
my son-in-law.

1310
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:05,625
Known well?

1311
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:08,708
It's good.
The matter which we know,

1312
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:13,500
When you don't know that
and come to know later...

1313
01:04:13,542 --> 01:04:16,875
...and instead we would've
told you earlier,

1314
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:20,667
if you ask me so,I wouldn't
have known how to reply?

1315
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:22,083
What do you say?

1316
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:31,333
From the time of my accident,
son-in-law takes care of me.

1317
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:33,250
Mom!

1318
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:36,292
Mom!

1319
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,875
Take,that balm.

1320
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:59,292
Mom,you don't know
as I'm here.

1321
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:01,208
Aunt won't understand
what we converse.

1322
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,750
Doctor has advised her
to be in rest.

1323
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,292
It is bad to disturb her.

1324
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:06,333
Shall we go?

1325
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:07,792
Son-in-law....

1326
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:09,167
Aunty.

1327
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:10,625
Juice.

1328
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,458
I prepared on my own.

1329
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:15,208
He took care of me well.

1330
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:15,958
Yes...

1331
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,458
He took good care of me.

1332
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,667
She made me a scapegoat.

1333
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,667
My son,
-Mom.

1334
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:24,917
You can't give a glass
of water to mother.

1335
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,083
But you give juice
to mother-in-law?

1336
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:29,000
Don't talk unnecessarily and
stop the marriage on your own.

1337
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,792
Who told you
to come here?

1338
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,208
I only told .

1339
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:32,542
Brilliant!

1340
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:35,333
I've prepared juice for you.

1341
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:37,042
Bye...

1342
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:41,167
Sir,madam has come.

1343
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:44,208
Come fast.

1344
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:48,292
Come,mom.

1345
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:49,958
Be careful.

1346
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,375
Cool.

1347
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,750
It's okay.

1348
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,042
A Tiger has become a tamed cat!

1349
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:07,750
Such a huge pumpkin?

1350
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:09,792
I'm jealous.

1351
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,583
I asked for a small slice
of pumpkin in the gravy.

1352
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:14,708
She refused.
But now broken such a huge one.

1353
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:16,750
Did she say no to you?
-I'll ask her.

1354
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:17,625
Wait...

1355
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,500
She may keep poison
in food.

1356
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,083
To you?

1357
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,458
For you.
Why for me?

1358
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,000
I went in to spy.

1359
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:30,958
Did she listen when said not
to drive the car?

1360
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:33,167
She didn't change even
after fracturing her leg.

1361
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:37,083
She goes straight.Go...

1362
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:41,750
Two... Five... Seven...

1363
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,458
The time is auspicious.

1364
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,042
Some are up and
some turned down.

1365
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:47,750
What he says with that?

1366
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:52,292
Marriages are made in heaven.

1367
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:56,167
The combination is good.

1368
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:01,083
Kudos to lord Muruga!

1369
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,292
Hey,is that you?

1370
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,208
What,he goes like a pontiff?

1371
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:07,208
First,he must be expelled
from this house.

1372
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,417
Within minutes,he made magic.

1373
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:13,750
If the marriage happens
on next auspicious day.

1374
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,667
Everything will be fine.

1375
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:18,500
Will they fix the date
for first night also?

1376
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,875
I've to inform the
boss immediately.

1377
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:23,000
Son-in-law has come.

1378
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,792
What's this attire?

1379
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:33,917
It's his invocation to Lord Muruga
as you met with accident.

1380
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:35,042
Sorry dude.

1381
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:37,292
None of our family member
should face that stance.

1382
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:41,333
After fulfilling our prayers,

1383
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:43,667
We came by walk
from the Marudamalai temple, Aunty.

1384
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,167
Sir.
-Is it immunization injection?

1385
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,833
Now only she took.
Go..

1386
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:48,792
Not that,sir.

1387
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:50,750
You're sitting here cool,

1388
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:51,792
Something furious is going
on inside.

1389
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:53,292
The marriage has been fixed.
What do you say?

1390
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:54,292
What to say?

1391
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,083
Who is she?
-sir.

1392
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:58,542
A pumpkin has come here.

1393
01:07:58,542 --> 01:07:59,875
First,call him.
-sir.

1394
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:01,667
You be quiet.
-sir.

1395
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:03,542
Call him...

1396
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:04,625
My boss wants
to talk with you.

1397
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:05,208
Give me.

1398
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:06,792
Villangam,
-sir.

1399
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:08,750
That process is going on, Don.

1400
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:10,333
Are you in process?

1401
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:13,167
A delivery may happen
before the process ends.

1402
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:14,083
So soon...?

1403
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:17,083
Villangam,
don't betray your guru.

1404
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:19,458
I won't do that,don.

1405
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:22,208
I sent a black sheep
to your house.

1406
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,417
A black sheep...?

1407
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:24,708
Where?
-It's me, sir.

1408
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,667
It's not completely black...

1409
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,417
She looks chubby.

1410
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:29,000
Look Carefully.

1411
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:30,917
Sir,I'm that black sheep.

1412
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:33,167
Are you? But,you look fair.

1413
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,167
Your black sheep has arrived.

1414
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:36,375
Okay..

1415
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:40,208
Can't you say that earlier?
-You didn't let me to speak.

1416
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:42,417
Not late,get in soon.
-thank you,sir.

1417
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:43,792
Go...
I will take her in.

1418
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:45,333
I'm coming.

1419
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,000
No, don't hurry.

1420
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,833
Look at her physique
and yours.

1421
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:52,292
You'll break into pieces.

1422
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:53,917
Accept the offering.

1423
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:56,208
Muruga.

1424
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:57,458
Praise the lord.

1425
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:58,917
Oh no...

1426
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:00,750
That's the offering of God.

1427
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:03,500
That's offering to you,
but poison to her.

1428
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:06,708
Do you know how much
calories are present in that?

1429
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:09,667
If she eats that,
she won't walk.

1430
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,583
Her leg will be removed.
Understood?

1431
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:13,708
She has nailed it.

1432
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,292
She took good training in acting.

1433
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:21,542
Not that, doctor has given me
the complete list of her diet.

1434
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:26,250
I 'll strictly follow that, okay?
-Hope she watch soap operas a lot.

1435
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:27,917
Talks lengthy.

1436
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:30,708
Mam, don't mistake me.

1437
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,000
You might see me as a nurse.

1438
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:37,333
But, I take care of you
as my mother.

1439
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:39,917
Superb knots.

1440
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,375
Next,you must be
sent to hospital.

1441
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:47,167
But,let it be the last.

1442
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,792
Don't behave like this anymore.

1443
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:53,458
Hey...hey ...
-Wait,boss.

1444
01:09:58,542 --> 01:10:01,042
Son-in-law, don't mistake.

1445
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:05,917
You...

1446
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:10,917
Welcome.

1447
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,708
Don't they build
toilets for cows?

1448
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,000
It made the entrance dirty.

1449
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,833
In-law,will you apply
the cow dung throughout..

1450
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:18,333
...the house daily?

1451
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,583
No, not daily.

1452
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,708
It's a sign as
Mahalakshmi comes.

1453
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,042
Yes...

1454
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:26,292
Be seated.

1455
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:28,542
Didn't you get rid
of this gesture,yet?

1456
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,667
Will you give us two pillows?
We'll lie down.

1457
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,375
Don't you've sofas
in your house?

1458
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:35,958
Stepney, will you sit only
on the sofa?

1459
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,083
Not on the mat?

1460
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,583
I'll sit on floor also.

1461
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:43,250
Boss.

1462
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,333
Do something.

1463
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,542
See now.

1464
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:50,708
It's very sultry.
Don't you use AC?

1465
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:53,917
That's used by
worthless, lazy people.

1466
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,000
We enjoy the nature.

1467
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,250
You're right, In-law.

1468
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:01,083
We must be accustomed
to live in all conditions.

1469
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,417
Isn't it?

1470
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:10,917
Will it rain inside the house?
-What a pitter-patter of rain?

1471
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:13,792
They might enjoy
the rain,it seems.

1472
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:23,250
In-law,why do you suffer?
We would've come.

1473
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,667
Why do you say so?

1474
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:27,875
I'm the mother.

1475
01:11:27,875 --> 01:11:30,083
Shouldn't I see the house
where my daughter...

1476
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,250
...is going to live?

1477
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:38,333
Luxury lacks in this house
but not love and affection.

1478
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:41,083
That's why I accepted
her marriage.

1479
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,250
So happy,in-law.

1480
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:47,083
Then we're leaving.

1481
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,500
When will you come again?

1482
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,583
We have to visit
frequently after marriage.

1483
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:51,542
Yes.

1484
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:53,375
Is it a Taj Mahal to come again?
-Go...

1485
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,167
A box like house.
-Go...

1486
01:11:56,917 --> 01:12:00,083
Okay,I'm leaving.
-Okay,In-law.

1487
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:01,458
Be careful.

1488
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:08,375
I like your house and
you very much,That's all.

1489
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:13,542
Then, untill marriage
you can come and...

1490
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,917
...stay with us.
That's my wish.

1491
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:17,833
In-law...

1492
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:22,875
No need to say anything.
You're coming.

1493
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,500
Hey, egg head is calling.

1494
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,333
Manage somehow.

1495
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,333
Hello.
-Hello.

1496
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:30,958
Can you hear me?

1497
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:33,167
Nothing is heard, except hello.

1498
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:35,250
Who are you?

1499
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:38,417
Can't you get my voice?

1500
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:40,042
When i don't know
who you are...

1501
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:41,500
...how can I get your voice?

1502
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,250
I'm Vanangamudi.

1503
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,708
Bro,is that you?

1504
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,167
Sorry.

1505
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:48,542
Did you imagine like that?

1506
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:50,833
Tell me the matter soon.

1507
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,667
I can't spend the day
without my car.

1508
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:55,750
Better,go to the road.

1509
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,583
Variety of cars,will move on.
See that.

1510
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,500
Do you want me
to see in furious state?

1511
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,958
We can't see you in normal.
you want to be seen when furious too?

1512
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:06,208
You dragged me.

1513
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:10,708
I dragged all animals.
Hang up the phone.

1514
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:11,792
Shit...

1515
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,167
What are you
going to do,boss?

1516
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,625
Why do you come hurriedly
rolling like a potato?

1517
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,500
Where is he now?

1518
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:24,542
In few minutes,the engagement
will be over.

1519
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:26,125
Do you know what
happens,then?

1520
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:28,000
Marriage!
-Oh,good.

1521
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:32,750
Call him.

1522
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:36,708
Sir,

1523
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,958
You speak.

1524
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:46,583
Boss, where are you?
Sir is asking.

1525
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:48,250
I'm standing close to don.

1526
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,833
How punctual he is!
Villangam.

1527
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:53,167
Everything starts from here.

1528
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:56,125
Good,his brain
started to work.

1529
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,667
Merge of Saddam Hussein's
left brain and...

1530
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:00,542
....Bin Laden's right brain
is my boss.

1531
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:03,667
So,you'll be killed soon.
-Don't talk like evil omen.

1532
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:08,875
I think the whole brain is dead.
-My project name is "BCA".

1533
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:10,875
I'm 'B',standing at the entrance.

1534
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:13,833
Is 'C' awaiting at the street?
-Exactly.

1535
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:18,750
'A' will lift him.
-superb,boss.

1536
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,000
Is that the way to lift?

1537
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,333
They fizzled by taking
money and alcohol.

1538
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,125
'A&C'spoilt the plan.

1539
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:28,208
I'm B, surely somehow,

1540
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,500
Stop this engagement.

1541
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,750
Come.
-Tell us...

1542
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,750
B...

1543
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,792
Boss,are we going
to welcome?

1544
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:38,292
I'll try something
for not coming.

1545
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:39,333
Move aside.

1546
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:47,125
Instead of sitting idle,
you can say something.

1547
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,750
The arrangements are grandeur
but the bride is not seen.

1548
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,667
Bride not seen?

1549
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:51,625
Villangam has started his work.

1550
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:54,125
Ask the bride to come.
-She has to be there to come?

1551
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:55,667
Thulasi...

1552
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:57,542
She is coming.

1553
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,500
Is this the plan B?

1554
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:10,583
On this auspicious day,

1555
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:13,583
For generations of
karkala family...

1556
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:17,167
...Rajeswari's daughter,"Thulasi"

1557
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:21,417
..with Valarmathi Thulasiraman's son,

1558
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:23,458
"Deva", on mutual consent,

1559
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:27,833
is getting engaged for marriage,

1560
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,375
Moreover...
-Enough.

1561
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,583
Everyone here
accents to this marriage.

1562
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:33,208
I don't...I don't...

1563
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,375
I don't want to be prideful
by saying about...

1564
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:38,875
... the dowry I give
to my daughter.

1565
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:39,875
Priest.

1566
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:46,375
I'm not interested
in this marriage.

1567
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:51,417
Take this jewellery.

1568
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:57,750
This is our family's
traditional jewellery.

1569
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,333
I hand over
this to you.

1570
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:14,583
"The day of wedding has come
to strobilanthes,"

1571
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:17,833
"Has given the wedding garlands."

1572
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:22,375
"As to behave in maturity,
Your beau has come,"

1573
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:25,542
"What happened to your words?"

1574
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:29,375
"Lay the shelters and tie the patterns..."

1575
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:33,167
"Play the dolak,bang the drums."

1576
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:37,667
"The day of wedding has come
to strobilanthes,"

1577
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:40,875
"Has given the wedding garlands."

1578
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:45,375
"As to behave in maturity,
Your beau has come,"

1579
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:48,583
"What happened to your words?"

1580
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:52,417
"A turmeric beet with
red colored mehandi cheeks,"

1581
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:56,250
"Shower a lot, to live as a queen."

1582
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:03,792
"The groom has come
to lead a happy life."

1583
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:07,792
"With the aura of sandal and kumkum,
all my relationships are astonished."

1584
01:17:07,792 --> 01:17:11,625
"With the aura of sandal and kumkum,
all my relationships are astonished."

1585
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:15,250
"The holy drums will bang."

1586
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:19,292
"The new ring,touches the toe,
Encircles to live a happy life."

1587
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:22,875
"The holy drums will bang."

1588
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:26,958
"The new ring,touches the toe,
Encircles to live a happy life."

1589
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:01,875
"We have to be in
the calling distance,"

1590
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:06,750
"You must be as a dot
in my pattern casting."

1591
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:10,375
"All the matches in
horoscope are absolute."

1592
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:15,083
"You must bear the sweet pain."

1593
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:19,458
"I'll transform myself
as per your desires,"

1594
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:23,542
"Only after seeking your
permission,I'll breathe."

1595
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:27,833
"The wetness of kiss in cheeks,
breathing whispers into ears,"

1596
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:31,708
"That must ever be heard,
you must give on continuously."

1597
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:36,208
"The day of wedding has come
to strobilanthes,"

1598
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:39,417
"Has given the wedding garlands."

1599
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:43,875
"As to behave in maturity,
Your beau has come,"

1600
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:47,208
"What happened to your words?"

1601
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:18,042
"I must subdue your attitude with love,
you must lie seduced on my lust,"

1602
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:21,708
"We must die hard
in between the blankets,"

1603
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:25,750
"I must grow as a
seed from your sweat."

1604
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:29,500
"Though, you wear the ornament
in the form of gold won't it be painful?

1605
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:33,208
"Shall I give you a patter
of rain as ear drops?"

1606
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:37,208
"My dear, don't blab
apart as ponderous,"

1607
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:40,875
"Won't you be ponderous on the bed?"

1608
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:44,875
"The bed in jitters,
the air becomes warm,"

1609
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:48,542
"I must touch you always,"
"I must tease you in love."

1610
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:53,083
"The day of wedding has come
to strobilanthes,"

1611
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:56,250
"Has given the wedding garlands."

1612
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,750
"As to behave in maturity,
Your beau has come,"

1613
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,875
"What happened to your words?"

1614
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:07,750
"The holy drums will bang."

1615
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:11,583
"The new ring,touches the toe,
Encircles to live a happy life."

1616
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:15,417
"The holy drums will bang."

1617
01:20:15,417 --> 01:20:20,000
"The new ring,touches the toe,
Encircles to live a happy life."

1618
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,125
What happened?

1619
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:22,417
You won't listen,
if said not to dance?

1620
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,875
Check what happened to her?

1621
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:27,417
It's since a week that
your vehicle was stolen.

1622
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:28,542
Why didn't you
file a complaint?

1623
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,958
Sir,I went out of station.
Returned only today.

1624
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:31,958
Okay,tell me
where did you go?

1625
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:35,792
To Thambioor.
-You go wherever you wish.

1626
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:37,167
Tell me the name
of the place.

1627
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:39,500
Thambioor,that's the name of
the place I went.

1628
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,208
Are you jestering?
-I promise on you,sir.

1629
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:45,875
Okay,sign here and leave.

1630
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,792
Sir....
-What?

1631
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:49,000
I asked you, only to sign.

1632
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,083
Sir, whether in English,Tamil
or Finger print?

1633
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:55,167
Are you teasing?
-No, sir.

1634
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:57,583
What's your name?
-Vanangamudi.

1635
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:58,792
Who named you so?

1636
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:06,125
A reputed astrologer,pandit
Pathasani Bhakiyam.

1637
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:11,542
He only suggested the name
for Oscar winner, A.R.Rahman.

1638
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:12,583
Believe me,sir.

1639
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:13,792
Just a minute,sir.

1640
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:15,042
Hello.

1641
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,875
I'm not Vanangamudi.
Who are you?

1642
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:21,625
You just told lengthy tales
for your name.

1643
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:22,708
That's for fun,sir.

1644
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:25,333
Humour sir...

1645
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,875
I'm out of station.

1646
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:32,458
Near to Trichy, next to
Kumbakonam, in Thanjavur.

1647
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:35,000
Is your's a padmini car?
-yes,sir.

1648
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:39,708
I don't have a padmini car.

1649
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:40,833
Hello.
-yes.

1650
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:42,250
Just now you said
as padmini.

1651
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,875
That's not to you,sir.

1652
01:21:44,042 --> 01:21:46,833
Either you speak to me
or in phone.

1653
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:48,500
You are not right.

1654
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,125
Order for a tea and
get bundle of paper.

1655
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:54,375
Cigar?
Get lost.

1656
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:55,750
You're honest,sir.

1657
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,208
Yes,I've come for
an important job.

1658
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:07,583
I'll come.

1659
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:09,083
Okay.

1660
01:22:09,542 --> 01:22:11,375
Where is the complainant of the car?
- Sir,

1661
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:12,208
Just now he left,sir.

1662
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:13,417
Call him.

1663
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:19,125
Give me a match box.

1664
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:25,208
Sir,
-what happened?

1665
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,583
He left,sir.

1666
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:28,625
Shit.

1667
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,833
The arrangements
must be perfect.

1668
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:31,833
Stop.

1669
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:34,208
Turn now.

1670
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:38,208
Who?

1671
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,750
Not me,him?

1672
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:42,542
Who is he?
-I'm here to whitewash...

1673
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:45,833
Tell her, you're a cook.
-Yes,a cook for the marriage.

1674
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:49,833
Oh,a cook.

1675
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:54,917
The food must be good.
-okay.

1676
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:57,125
Everyone must be satisfied.
-Sure.

1677
01:22:57,125 --> 01:23:00,375
Especially the sweet,Jhangri.
-okay.

1678
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:02,917
We have to follow the astrology
and must give food for charity.

1679
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:05,583
We'll do.
Shut up and come...

1680
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,125
When you're here
to act as a cook...

1681
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:08,125
...She wants you to do Jhangri.

1682
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:10,292
Will you do
sweet savoury, torque?

1683
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:12,042
What,sweet savoury?
-Yes.

1684
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:13,667
Do you know to do
savoury,torque?

1685
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:15,292
Instead of salt, add sugar.

1686
01:23:15,292 --> 01:23:16,625
That is "Jhangri".
Come.

1687
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:17,750
I don't understand anything.

1688
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,292
Hey,why did you
tie up me?

1689
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:28,208
Where is my car?
-You mean,car?

1690
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,875
Go straight away
to the Pollachi market.

1691
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:32,958
It lies there as pieces.
Assemble that.

1692
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:36,458
I won't leave you.
I will complain to police.

1693
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:38,417
It's problem to you only,
if you go to police.

1694
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:39,583
Why?

1695
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,958
Because,police is in search
of you,as your car...

1696
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,583
...met with an accident.

1697
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,958
If you go now,
you'll be caught.

1698
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:47,667
Did my car
met with accident?

1699
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:49,792
Dude,he'll keep on talking.
Take that spray.

1700
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,792
Is it lily or jasmine?
-Mosquito repellent.

1701
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,208
He won't get up
for next six hours.

1702
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,458
After that?
He'll forget.

1703
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:02,708
Egg head.

1704
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,250
What's the work was
assigned to you?

1705
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,750
What are you doing?

1706
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,958
I'm checking for
the taste.

1707
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,583
Oh,then?

1708
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:18,292
I must cook rice.
-Then?

1709
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:19,583
Must prepare tamarind paste.

1710
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:22,250
Then?
-You want me to taste the sour.

1711
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,292
Don.

1712
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,042
You didn't understand me.

1713
01:24:25,042 --> 01:24:27,250
What?
-Didn't understand.

1714
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,917
If I do all these,then only
I'll be like a cook.

1715
01:24:29,917 --> 01:24:32,917
He transformed as a
full time cook...

1716
01:24:32,917 --> 01:24:35,083
...and will ask for
a order it seems.

1717
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:38,375
What now?
I'll give him a test tomorrow.

1718
01:24:39,417 --> 01:24:41,625
We're going to pass that test.

1719
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,583
You say as if we'll pass
in NEET exam.

1720
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:44,375
Proceed.

1721
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:46,833
Don,please taste this.

1722
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:50,083
I believed you as don
and given a serious job.

1723
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:50,958
Don!

1724
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:54,708
Now also,if I mix
the secret one...

1725
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:57,667
You only taste
that first and die.

1726
01:24:57,667 --> 01:25:01,458
Hey,I mixed poison in sweet.
-I know.

1727
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:03,917
Be careful.
In cooking too.

1728
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:06,042
You're not a cook.
-I'm a don!

1729
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:07,583
A don!

1730
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:09,792
Greetings, Madam.

1731
01:25:09,792 --> 01:25:14,125
It's the latest SUV car
with hatch back.

1732
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:16,750
To me,safety is more
important than new version.

1733
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,625
Because, It's a gift to
my son-in-law.

1734
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,667
This car is good
for your status,madam.

1735
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:22,958
That's why I referred you.

1736
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,875
Four colours in this model.

1737
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:27,333
Take that catalogue.
Show to madam.

1738
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:30,583
Will you ask?
Monkey,stand straight.

1739
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,500
Greetings,in-law.

1740
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:34,250
Sorry,I'm late.
-It's okay. Be seated.

1741
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,667
Is the car ready?

1742
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:38,750
Madam,if you finalize,
you can go for test drive...

1743
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,750
...and take delivery
of your car.

1744
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:43,458
In-law,are we going to
temple in new car?

1745
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:47,708
No,that car is my
gift to son-in-law.

1746
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,667
We can take delivery
of that car only after...

1747
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:52,583
... son-in-law do the test drive
and satisfies.

1748
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,250
Oh,no!
-What happened?

1749
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,375
Oh...
-Oh god!

1750
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:01,875
No,we can have this test,
drive, everything after marriage.

1751
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:02,958
Yes, correct.

1752
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,167
No...No...

1753
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,542
It must be given
at right time...

1754
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,292
...then only it's a respect
to son-in-law.

1755
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:10,667
What,am I right?
-God!

1756
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:12,917
God...God...

1757
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:15,042
Aunty,I'm bit late.
Shall we go?

1758
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:17,417
You've come at right time,
son-in-law.

1759
01:26:17,417 --> 01:26:18,417
Go away...
Go...

1760
01:26:23,542 --> 01:26:24,333
Go away...
Go...

1761
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:26,958
Go away...
Go...

1762
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,458
Don't know what will happen?
Go...

1763
01:26:30,458 --> 01:26:31,792
Nothing.

1764
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:35,333
I have booked
a car for you.

1765
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:38,708
She buys him a car
even before marriage.

1766
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:40,083
He knows to drive.

1767
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:43,208
I know what you mean.
Shut up.

1768
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:47,792
In-law,is the time auspicious now?
-Yes.

1769
01:26:47,792 --> 01:26:51,500
My son is going to drive a car at first,
That's why...

1770
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:52,958
You mean, at first?

1771
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,375
What, son-in-law?

1772
01:26:56,792 --> 01:27:00,542
Not that,mom says so,as
I'm going to drive a new car.

1773
01:27:00,542 --> 01:27:02,958
If son-in-law drives,
it'll be fiery.

1774
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,417
You're going to witness!

1775
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:05,875
That's it.

1776
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:08,625
Okay,you go and
get ready with the car.

1777
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,875
He'll do the test drive.

1778
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:13,583
Are you okay?

1779
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:15,167
Yes,aunty.
I'm ready.

1780
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:15,958
I'm ready.

1781
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:20,625
Thulasi,go along with him
when he drives the car.

1782
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:21,417
I'll go,mom.

1783
01:27:21,417 --> 01:27:23,042
Where are you going?
-Thulasi.

1784
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:25,125
Thulasi,stop.
Thulasi.

1785
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,083
What,in-law?

1786
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:32,208
Are you giving him
tips to drive the car?

1787
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:33,542
Yes...Yes...

1788
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:35,958
How dare,she didn't
even call me for temple.

1789
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:38,042
We'll go by share auto.

1790
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:39,750
It's hurting,boss.

1791
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:40,625
To me also.

1792
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:41,917
My shoulder,boss.

1793
01:27:42,042 --> 01:27:43,167
Who is that?

1794
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:47,875
What? Did your mom
sent you to overhear us?

1795
01:27:48,667 --> 01:27:49,458
Dad...

1796
01:27:50,417 --> 01:27:52,625
Dad...Dad...

1797
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:54,917
Boss,she calls
you only,as dad.

1798
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:56,958
Please,dad.

1799
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:01,125
Just now you know
that you've a dad.

1800
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:05,792
Please dad, somehow you
must help me in marriage.

1801
01:28:05,792 --> 01:28:07,375
That's why she calls
me as dad.

1802
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:10,250
I'll help for your marriage.
-Not that,dad.

1803
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:11,542
Then what, dear?

1804
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:13,083
That is...

1805
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:16,458
He don't know to
drive the car like you!

1806
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,625
Forgive me.
-What?

1807
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,167
What you say?
-You save him, please dad.

1808
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:21,417
Doesn't he know!

1809
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:21,958
Hey.

1810
01:28:22,917 --> 01:28:24,083
Oh god!

1811
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,750
Doesn't he know?
-Please,dad.

1812
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,667
Let the music play.

1813
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:30,792
Don't lie to dad,
doesn't he know about the car?

1814
01:28:30,792 --> 01:28:32,792
He don't know to drive.

1815
01:28:32,792 --> 01:28:34,958
Oh no.. Dad, don't be loud.

1816
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:35,917
Okay.

1817
01:28:35,917 --> 01:28:39,750
Boss,you are not serene.
-I know.

1818
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:42,625
Your foot is not on the ground.
-It won't, I'm wearing a footwear.

1819
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,417
Another slave to the house.

1820
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:47,333
Where to put the keys?

1821
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:51,417
Son-in-law,take the keys.

1822
01:28:51,417 --> 01:28:53,042
Groom is caught!

1823
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:54,958
Go for a drive.

1824
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:55,833
Stop.

1825
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:58,042
What car is it?
-It's the latest model,sir.

1826
01:28:58,042 --> 01:28:59,708
I know it's latest.

1827
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:01,583
What about that churn?

1828
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,625
You mean,churn?
-He says the gear.

1829
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:05,250
It's automatic gear,sir.

1830
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:08,208
I know it's automatic,
but do you know Audi car?

1831
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:11,125
Only the name is Audi car,
but it goes smooth.

1832
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:14,375
What do you know about car?
-Don't talk to me about car.

1833
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:16,500
The engine of the car
is like a heart to human.

1834
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:20,667
The diesel pipe is like
the nerves of human.

1835
01:29:20,667 --> 01:29:22,917
Then gear,brake and
clutch is like...

1836
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:24,625
...pancreas,lungs and kidney.

1837
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,208
The wheels are like legs.

1838
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,792
Don't talk about the car.
-Boss,you're so familiar about car.

1839
01:29:29,792 --> 01:29:33,125
Sir,you go for a test drive.
-Hey,is it filled with petrol?

1840
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:34,208
It's diesel vehicle,sir.

1841
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,625
Is it diesel vehicle?
-Yes,sir.

1842
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:36,917
Where will you fill the diesel?
-There...

1843
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:38,125
In that bunk?

1844
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:39,708
He sells contaminated fuel.

1845
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,875
My son-in-law will drive
only in pure diesel.

1846
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:42,458
Go away.

1847
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,208
I can't get even,
if I go to Dubai.

1848
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:46,167
Then go to Iraq or Iran.

1849
01:29:46,167 --> 01:29:47,625
Nothing urgent.
Be cool.

1850
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:49,333
What shoddy colour is this?

1851
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:50,667
Son-in-law,what's your
favourite colour?

1852
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:54,125
This colour only.
-In-law! Don't interfere.

1853
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:54,958
I'll talk to son-in-law.

1854
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:56,417
What's your favourite colour,
son-in-law?

1855
01:29:56,417 --> 01:29:58,167
Blue.
-Blue?

1856
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,875
Green.
-Green.

1857
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,292
Parrot green!
-Parrot green!

1858
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:05,958
Parrot green!
-Parrot green!

1859
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,958
Get a car
in parrot green.

1860
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:10,167
You mean, car
in parrot green?

1861
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:11,792
First,you go for
a test drive,sir.

1862
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:13,042
Get that.

1863
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:16,125
It's gone.
It's evil omen.

1864
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:18,167
Your car will be condemned
if drive now.

1865
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:19,583
Take away.

1866
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:21,250
Don!

1867
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,208
Son-in-law.
-Uncle,

1868
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:25,542
Son-in-law,she is fuming.
Come,let's go.

1869
01:30:25,542 --> 01:30:28,083
Uncle,she fumes.
We'll go,uncle.

1870
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:30,625
Stepney ,come here.

1871
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:35,208
This is how you sneeze?
-Madam.

1872
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:37,333
Stepney.

1873
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:42,583
I dreamt of something.
-Hereafter,it's my rule in this house.

1874
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:43,333
Who is that?

1875
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:46,083
Villangam.
-You spoiled everything.

1876
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:50,208
When I planned a best idea
and implementing that...

1877
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:52,792
...you shattered, don.

1878
01:30:52,792 --> 01:30:55,792
Why do you and that fair lady
ever talks about brain?

1879
01:30:55,792 --> 01:30:57,208
Do you both own
a butchery shop?

1880
01:30:57,208 --> 01:30:58,083
Do you know?

1881
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:00,375
As I wished, my son-in-law
don't know to drive a car.

1882
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:01,542
I know that.

1883
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:02,792
Then, why didn't you
convey me?

1884
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:04,250
I told you.
-When?

1885
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:07,083
That is...now.
-My daughter told earlier.

1886
01:31:07,083 --> 01:31:07,833
Leave it.
-I told...

1887
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:10,458
Better throw away the ladle
and leave the place.

1888
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:13,625
Don, without finishing the job....

1889
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:17,042
...where to go?
Whom do I know?

1890
01:31:17,042 --> 01:31:21,167
I want you to leave, but
don't know where to send?

1891
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:23,875
Do one thing,
You're good in cooking.

1892
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:25,833
Better continue as cook
till the marriage.

1893
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:28,375
Take it.
Get buttermilk to my room.

1894
01:31:28,375 --> 01:31:30,542
Don! I...
-Only one buttermilk.

1895
01:31:30,542 --> 01:31:32,417
You'll be given salary.

1896
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:36,917
He pays me for the job.

1897
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:38,833
Double charge.

1898
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:41,125
He has reversed
to be good.

1899
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:44,292
I must reverse to villain.

1900
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:49,167
What?

1901
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:53,208
Is it audible till there?

1902
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:55,250
I was thinking about
seasoning of buttermilk.

1903
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:59,458
Everyone becomes villian,
if given littlle space.

1904
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,250
Wait,I'll come.

1905
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:06,875
I'll offer 108 coconuts,
if the "Kaveri river management",

1906
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:09,958
Lord Muruga,let everyone live good.
-Hello,it's the temple of goddess.

1907
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,875
Goddess!
I'm confused.

1908
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,083
My devotion has gone
to an extreme.

1909
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,708
Close the gate.

1910
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:40,750
Madam,will you go back?

1911
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:43,667
Why? Are you going
to fight?

1912
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:46,500
He'll fight. I'll stand away
and give him tips.

1913
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,667
I didn't expect this.

1914
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:57,792
Son-in-law,the dhoti
will hinder,fold it.

1915
01:32:58,583 --> 01:33:00,792
Good!

1916
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:19,708
No...

1917
01:33:21,542 --> 01:33:23,667
I can't.
I can't bear.

1918
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:25,083
You are caught.

1919
01:33:35,917 --> 01:33:37,917
They're tearing.
Aunty.

1920
01:33:41,792 --> 01:33:44,750
Hey,Deva.
Hey.

1921
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,083
Super!

1922
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:51,417
Hey, turn back.
Someone is behind you.

1923
01:34:04,417 --> 01:34:05,958
Are you caught?

1924
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:11,750
Will you stroke the women?
-Don't you know that as wrong?

1925
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:15,750
No... it's not me!

1926
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,583
Leave me.

1927
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:39,750
Superb,uncle!
You made it!

1928
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,750
Who do you think of?

1929
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:49,000
That's it,boss!

1930
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,125
Son-in-law,I'm back.
-Welcome, uncle.

1931
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:55,875
Don't be loud.
she might fume again.

1932
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:59,875
You are the saviour
of the family!

1933
01:34:59,875 --> 01:35:02,583
Cut a tender coconut.
-Help your son-in-law.

1934
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:03,958
Son-in-law,
-Uncle.

1935
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:04,750
Throw that.

1936
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,833
Take this to bang,
if feeling tired, drink it.

1937
01:35:10,417 --> 01:35:12,333
You give him coconut!

1938
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:14,542
A wise man will make
tool of whatever...

1939
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:17,000
I understood.
-One...two

1940
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,208
Three...four...five

1941
01:35:21,208 --> 01:35:25,125
Wait,I'll come.
-Six...seven...eight.

1942
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:29,208
You called me for this,
isn't it?

1943
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:33,333
Instead of hitting with wood,
are you romancing me by hugging?

1944
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:35,250
You'll remain a fighter always.

1945
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:39,250
Son-in-law, any help?
-It's over.

1946
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,792
Do you think of women
as so worse?

1947
01:35:40,792 --> 01:35:42,667
Get lost without looking back.
-Go...

1948
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:43,542
Go...

1949
01:35:43,542 --> 01:35:45,750
Is it you?
Put the wood down....

1950
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,083
Are you hurt?
I thought you're one among them.

1951
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:48,833
Sorry,madam.

1952
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:50,708
We did mistake.
We'll never do again.

1953
01:35:50,708 --> 01:35:52,750
Son-in-law, that's why
when men are at home...

1954
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,625
What?
-No...

1955
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,417
Even men are there, it's good
if women come to temple.

1956
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,958
Hey,ask for pardon.

1957
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:00,042
Go away.

1958
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:17,458
You are the goddess
to my home.

1959
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:19,333
Will you bless me
with a boon?

1960
01:36:19,333 --> 01:36:21,708
A boon?
What's that?

1961
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:23,250
Just a kiss!

1962
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,667
You...

1963
01:36:24,667 --> 01:36:26,042
Not now.
Only after marriage.

1964
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:27,750
On that day in driving,
You said after engagement.

1965
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:28,833
Now you say as
after marriage.

1966
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:30,500
What do you
think of me?

1967
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,292
Who owns a car
in this colour?

1968
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:33,792
Worst taste.

1969
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:37,125
Deva,it's not our car.

1970
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,333
Wait,I'll get mom.
-Thulasi.

1971
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,917
I hit your mother by mistake.

1972
01:36:43,917 --> 01:36:45,583
You...

1973
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,542
I drove the car to impress you.

1974
01:36:47,542 --> 01:36:49,000
For that,will you hit my mom?

1975
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,917
It happened by mistake.
I won't even ask for a kiss.

1976
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:54,958
Don't be angst.
Hereafter,if you do anything...

1977
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:56,458
...then, it'll be a problem to us.

1978
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:57,792
Please...

1979
01:36:58,417 --> 01:37:00,000
Okay, come here.

1980
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:02,917
This matter mustn't be known
to anyone, till marriage.

1981
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:04,333
Okay.

1982
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:08,292
Still how long to act as a cook?
I can't.

1983
01:37:08,292 --> 01:37:13,250
Boss, without any plan to win,
a stuff has come on its own.

1984
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,667
What's that?

1985
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:18,333
Deva hit the car and
made the accident ...

1986
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:19,958
...for Rajeswari madam.

1987
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:24,167
Hey,it's true.
-is it?

1988
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:28,000
Oh,it goes that way.

1989
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:35,250
Taste it for salt.
-Sorry.

1990
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:38,000
I'm going to give him a test.
Come,let's go.

1991
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,500
I'll prove him,who am I?
-Will you prove?

1992
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,042
Astrologer,lack of a person for the
remedy of charity of food.

1993
01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:43,958
Is that okay?

1994
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:46,917
Will the remedy work only half?
-Boss, groceries has arrived.

1995
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:49,333
It's good. Take all
the things to store room.

1996
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:50,625
Take him for food.
-Okay.

1997
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:53,167
You're the king of charity.
-let it be,egg head.

1998
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:56,792
Astrologer,the remedy is fulfilled.
Come on.

1999
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:00,833
Come on.

2000
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:03,792
I'll give you another one.

2001
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,583
We shouldn't waste food.

2002
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:07,708
I won't leave, brother.

2003
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:13,917
Car...

2004
01:38:16,042 --> 01:38:21,667
My padmini!
Yes,my padmini!

2005
01:38:39,708 --> 01:38:43,208
Boss,what are you
going to do?

2006
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:50,708
Deva and Rajeswari mam
are at the same place.

2007
01:38:50,792 --> 01:38:56,333
Without our identification,
she must know about Deva.

2008
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:59,417
For that,we must
inform the police.

2009
01:38:59,417 --> 01:39:02,833
They'll arrest him.
How is my plan?

2010
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:06,542
Show,inform and arrest...
okay, boss.

2011
01:39:06,542 --> 01:39:08,125
Are you ready?
-What?Boss?

2012
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:09,750
Are you ready
to show the car?

2013
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,917
Come on,boss.

2014
01:39:10,917 --> 01:39:15,250
What's the name of that car?
-Old Padmini.

2015
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:19,167
Who is speaking?
-I'm not, boss.

2016
01:39:19,167 --> 01:39:23,125
Okay,Where is that car now?
-It's safe inside.

2017
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:27,458
Such a coarse voice!

2018
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:29,417
Are you afraid?

2019
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:31,792
You said about car,but
a black monkey has come.

2020
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:33,333
Who are you?

2021
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:35,875
Have you come to steal the car?
-Why must I steal my own car?

2022
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:37,667
Your car?
-Yes.

2023
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:39,292
I can't understand.

2024
01:39:39,292 --> 01:39:42,292
Send her inside.

2025
01:39:42,292 --> 01:39:45,417
We are not such persons.

2026
01:39:45,417 --> 01:39:47,250
Whisper me whatever.
-okay

2027
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,542
I'll hit you.

2028
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:53,708
Is it?
-Yes.

2029
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:57,333
You take away the car.
-Boss.

2030
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:59,542
I'll manage.
-Boss.

2031
01:39:59,542 --> 01:40:01,708
Nice one.
-Is that the car?

2032
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:04,750
It's inside.
Come this side. Come.

2033
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:10,417
Boss,you spoilt a good plan.

2034
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:12,042
That's because of a reason.

2035
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:14,458
What'll you do now?
-See now.

2036
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:22,083
Sir,the old padmini car,
orange in color...

2037
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:27,458
... which you're in search of,
is on highways at a speed of,150Kmph.

2038
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:31,333
Boss,look at there.
-Bye.

2039
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:33,625
Doesn't he know to drive?
Idiot.

2040
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:39,875
Sorry sir,he is roving the car.

2041
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,583
Will you catch him?

2042
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:46,250
Hello...
-Boss, superb.

2043
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,292
You dare to go along
with that egg head...

2044
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:49,958
...what damn taste you have?
Come,let's go.

2045
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:54,500
No one must know
that car is here.

2046
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,917
Especially for those in home.
-How many times will you repeat?

2047
01:40:57,917 --> 01:41:00,333
How long?

2048
01:41:00,333 --> 01:41:03,708
If it is not here now,
I'll lynch you.

2049
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:05,083
We are close to you.

2050
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:08,792
Hey,you said you'll
come soon at my first call.

2051
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:10,708
After that,I made
many calls.

2052
01:41:10,708 --> 01:41:14,958
Boss,if you continuosly
call,how to come?

2053
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:16,542
Okay, leave that.

2054
01:41:16,542 --> 01:41:22,583
Look here,I'll tell you an important matter,
instead of going that side....

2055
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:26,208
I'm...
What are you doing?

2056
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:27,833
What's this?

2057
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:30,542
You told to come soon.
So,we came.

2058
01:41:32,417 --> 01:41:35,458
Will you come with the
vessel filled with water?

2059
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:36,417
Pour now.

2060
01:41:36,417 --> 01:41:39,250
If water spills,
someone may skid.

2061
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,333
Did you pour on
the electric box?

2062
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:44,250
Even electric box
helps for love.

2063
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,167
Superb.

2064
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:49,125
You made it right.
The job is easier.

2065
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:51,833
Listen to my plan.

2066
01:41:51,833 --> 01:41:55,958
What that is...
-Oh no, power has gone.

2067
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:00,250
They say, lying on the lap,
will make us fall asleep. Can I try?

2068
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,708
Okay, boss.
-Go.

2069
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,917
Hey,are you going
to watch a movie?

2070
01:42:06,917 --> 01:42:09,333
You are going for theft.
Go separately.

2071
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:13,042
Boss, aren't you coming?
-I'll come.

2072
01:42:13,042 --> 01:42:17,250
They left the vessel here itself.
-Come soon,boss.

2073
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:21,000
I'm beautiful even in dark.
Must upload in FB.

2074
01:42:21,333 --> 01:42:24,042
200 dislikes immediately.
-Hey,step...

2075
01:42:24,042 --> 01:42:26,167
Hey,step...

2076
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:29,875
Hey,step...
-Boss,are you here?

2077
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,208
There is no power,
you're holding something.

2078
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:33,958
It's my cell phone,boss.
-I say about that only.

2079
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:36,083
It's sultry inside the room.

2080
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:38,208
You do one thing,
do I need to be a fanner till the dawn?

2081
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:41,292
Sounds good, come.
-Boss.

2082
01:42:41,292 --> 01:42:44,250
Call the EB and find out
when will the power resume.

2083
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:46,458
Already I did,
they're on the way.

2084
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:48,208
I must tell her, the power
will resume soon.

2085
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:50,208
She may get frightened.

2086
01:42:50,208 --> 01:42:53,833
Not at me,at the dark.

2087
01:42:57,542 --> 01:42:59,917
Go.

2088
01:43:05,333 --> 01:43:07,417
Boss is here.

2089
01:43:07,417 --> 01:43:08,958
He knows where
the jewellery is.

2090
01:43:08,958 --> 01:43:13,250
Then,why he asks us to take?
-Goof, everyone here knows our boss.

2091
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:15,333
That's why he sent us.
-You're right.

2092
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:22,042
Is that room?
-I think so, don't talk. Follow me.

2093
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:26,917
Excuse me,boss.

2094
01:43:30,625 --> 01:43:32,458
Enjoy.

2095
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:36,625
Either he plays music
or sprays perfume.

2096
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:38,458
What does he think?

2097
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,958
Oh no,we aren't.

2098
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,750
Madam's voice.

2099
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:50,792
Thief...!

2100
01:43:53,542 --> 01:43:55,167
Hey, who's that?
-Oh no...thief.

2101
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:58,208
Wait,we are coming.
-In-law...

2102
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,625
Why do you shout?

2103
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:03,833
When you're at home,both these
culprits entered my room,

2104
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:04,458
-Entered?

2105
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:06,000
Our traditional jewellery,
-Jewellery?

2106
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,917
They took that.
-Have they took?

2107
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:10,625
Don't hit,sir.

2108
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:12,292
We didn't steal on our own.
It's the order of our boss!

2109
01:44:12,292 --> 01:44:13,917
Your boss is also here?

2110
01:44:13,917 --> 01:44:15,333
Where is he?
-Don't hit us.

2111
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:17,333
Call him.

2112
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:18,958
How dare they call him?

2113
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:20,458
He'll attend.

2114
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:23,208
It's audible somewhere here.

2115
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:24,958
It's from here, boss.

2116
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:26,875
Here...
He is hiding here.

2117
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:28,792
From here only it comes.

2118
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:31,875
Boss,see there is someone.
Catch him.

2119
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,583
I told everything.

2120
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:35,875
Back stabbers.

2121
01:44:35,875 --> 01:44:38,542
Who are you?

2122
01:44:38,542 --> 01:44:40,292
Tell me.

2123
01:44:40,292 --> 01:44:41,792
You find out by my eyes.

2124
01:44:41,792 --> 01:44:44,417
Mom!
-Hey,who locked the door?

2125
01:44:44,417 --> 01:44:45,167
Don't know,mom.

2126
01:44:45,167 --> 01:44:48,292
Do you think of you as,
"Athe Kangal,Ravichandran"?

2127
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:50,917
Boss,Villangam!

2128
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:52,458
What noise is that?
-Don't know, come,let's see.

2129
01:44:52,458 --> 01:44:55,708
Salt in sambar...
-Salt?

2130
01:44:55,708 --> 01:44:57,792
Upma and potato...

2131
01:44:57,792 --> 01:44:59,625
Boss,he is blabbering.
He might've done something.

2132
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:01,042
I'm not blabbering.

2133
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:02,875
Don!
-Then, aren't you the don?

2134
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:05,083
Don!
-Get lost.

2135
01:45:05,083 --> 01:45:06,417
Don, do you know what he did?

2136
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:08,417
What job did I assigned for you,
but what you did?

2137
01:45:08,417 --> 01:45:12,833
My wife will treat you cheap
as you took the jewellery.

2138
01:45:13,583 --> 01:45:16,292
What are you
doing here,idiot?

2139
01:45:16,292 --> 01:45:17,333
What're you doing here?

2140
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:20,167
What's happening here?
Why so loud?

2141
01:45:20,167 --> 01:45:22,500
In-law,he took our
traditional jewellery.

2142
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,167
Jewellery?

2143
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:27,250
Stepney, call the police.

2144
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:29,833
Yes, call the police.

2145
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:32,542
I'll tell the police everything.

2146
01:45:32,542 --> 01:45:35,583
Do you know who he is?
-Uncle,it won't work.

2147
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,250
That's it.

2148
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:40,333
Why do you leave him?
Take him.

2149
01:45:40,333 --> 01:45:41,500
Yes sir.
-Go.

2150
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:45,750
We'll hand over him
to police.

2151
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:49,458
Our family dignity will be lost
if we go to police. Go to sleep.

2152
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:53,833
Stepney, who locked my room outside?
-That is...

2153
01:45:55,542 --> 01:45:57,958
Don't sing and stop dancing.

2154
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,500
What's happening in this house?
I don't know, mom.

2155
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,583
I can't understand.
It seems to be a torture.

2156
01:46:04,583 --> 01:46:06,375
Son-in-law, come here.
-Uncle.

2157
01:46:06,375 --> 01:46:07,708
It's a good timing, hitting him...

2158
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:09,708
...when he mentioned about police.

2159
01:46:18,875 --> 01:46:21,917
With trust,I left him to you.

2160
01:46:21,917 --> 01:46:25,625
But you betrayed me.

2161
01:46:31,917 --> 01:46:34,083
I don't know
whom to believe?

2162
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:36,333
Everyone betrayed.

2163
01:46:37,292 --> 01:46:38,375
I don't know.

2164
01:46:40,583 --> 01:46:44,208
Where to go, whom to....?

2165
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:45,833
Mango pickle!

2166
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:48,458
Hey.

2167
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:50,083
Hey,is that you?

2168
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:50,583
Yes.

2169
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:53,042
Didn't the police arrest you?
-No.

2170
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:57,333
Why do you take
booze,so raw?

2171
01:46:57,333 --> 01:47:00,750
A whole family has thrashed me.
You didn't ask for that.

2172
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:03,583
If a whole family thrash you,
what betrayal you did?

2173
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:04,625
That's deception.

2174
01:47:04,625 --> 01:47:06,875
Deception?
-I didn't.

2175
01:47:07,583 --> 01:47:09,833
They did that
even for you too.

2176
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:12,250
You left with
an old Padmini car,

2177
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,167
Do you know who
was having that,earlier?

2178
01:47:14,167 --> 01:47:17,333
How?
You say exactly as a magic.

2179
01:47:17,333 --> 01:47:20,875
Egg head,I know everything.
Where is that car,now?

2180
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:25,292
As I don't know to drive,
I was moving the car on the road,

2181
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:27,708
I left to attend nature's call.

2182
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:29,542
I heard a voice behind me.
-Sir,

2183
01:47:29,542 --> 01:47:31,625
What?

2184
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:35,542
Sir, I'm so hungry.
I'm starving for two days.

2185
01:47:35,542 --> 01:47:37,750
Give me money, please.
-I'll give,but wait.

2186
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:42,125
You don't look like starving,
but I'll give, wait.

2187
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,458
When I was counting
the money,she grabbed...

2188
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,917
...and ran away.

2189
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:50,125
When I ran behind her,
someone took away that car.

2190
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:52,542
Because of that both guys,
My life is in perils.

2191
01:47:52,542 --> 01:47:56,333
The day I lost my car,
my time turned out worse.

2192
01:47:56,333 --> 01:47:58,417
If I get caught of him...

2193
01:47:58,417 --> 01:48:00,917
What'll you do?
-I'll do whatever I wish.

2194
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:04,375
I decided what
you must do hereafter.

2195
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:06,042
Come,let's go.
-come.

2196
01:48:06,042 --> 01:48:08,167
Are we going to park?

2197
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:09,625
It's a different place.

2198
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:12,375
He must be a dolt.
-Yes.

2199
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:40,167
Welcome!

2200
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:42,375
Singam four!

2201
01:48:43,458 --> 01:48:46,042
Dear nurse,
I've a purse,

2202
01:48:46,042 --> 01:48:47,667
If you come close... I

2203
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:52,667
Hey...
-Sorry,I was watering the plants.

2204
01:48:54,375 --> 01:48:57,042
Oh no, who needs sambar?

2205
01:48:57,292 --> 01:48:59,500
Is there anything inside
or simply an empty box?

2206
01:49:00,292 --> 01:49:02,708
Don't you speak to men?

2207
01:49:03,042 --> 01:49:05,083
Son-in-law,why do you hit
like a bike without brake?

2208
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:06,542
Have you read the
breaking news?

2209
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:08,458
You're there for that.
What happened, Son-in-law?

2210
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:10,500
Aunt always insist me
to drive the car.

2211
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,750
In few minutes,
she might ask me to go around...

2212
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:13,917
... the car instead of the holy fire.
-Do something, uncle.

2213
01:49:13,917 --> 01:49:16,792
I know,she'll get marry
you to a car.

2214
01:49:16,792 --> 01:49:17,500
Uncle!

2215
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,708
Don't be afraid.
Being bold is male physiognomy.

2216
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:21,542
Whenever she looks at you,
you look at me.

2217
01:49:21,542 --> 01:49:22,875
If I look so?
-You can notice shivers.

2218
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:24,500
Is she?
Are you making fun?

2219
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:27,542
Son-in-law...

2220
01:49:27,542 --> 01:49:30,833
Son-in-law, we have ordered
24 food items in menu. Check out.

2221
01:49:30,833 --> 01:49:32,250
Uncle,lentil ball is missing.

2222
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:34,500
Lentil ball?
- Lentil ball?

2223
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,458
Why it's missing?
-Why it's missing?

2224
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:37,917
Stepney.

2225
01:49:38,167 --> 01:49:40,042
Did we order for
lentil balls in menu?

2226
01:49:40,042 --> 01:49:42,000
Shall I cancel that
and order for urid ball?

2227
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:43,417
Let it be.

2228
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:45,708
What's happening,here?
-Marriage,madam.

2229
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:48,750
Stepney,what they both
are talking about?

2230
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,167
That is...
Son-in-law came in scurry,

2231
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,333
When you came as scuttle,

2232
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:53,333
They both conversed in streak,
and left as sprint.

2233
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:54,292
Stepney.

2234
01:49:54,292 --> 01:49:56,333
Follow your sneezing style
as usual.

2235
01:49:58,458 --> 01:49:59,708
Thanks, madam.

2236
01:50:06,583 --> 01:50:07,708
We are...

2237
01:50:07,708 --> 01:50:08,333
Hey,

2238
01:50:09,292 --> 01:50:10,958
You got hit yesterday,
isn't it?

2239
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:12,125
If that's yesterday,will you
hit me today also?

2240
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:12,917
Hit me.Hit me.

2241
01:50:14,167 --> 01:50:15,042
Come...

2242
01:50:15,042 --> 01:50:16,333
Hey...

2243
01:50:17,333 --> 01:50:17,917
Hey...

2244
01:50:17,917 --> 01:50:20,083
Hit him...
-It's Vanangamudi.

2245
01:50:20,083 --> 01:50:22,583
Come...

2246
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:25,375
Come egghead.
"Vanangamudi... "

2247
01:50:25,375 --> 01:50:27,667
"He has come here."

2248
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:29,708
"Where'll you go to hide?"

2249
01:50:29,708 --> 01:50:32,500
Had food?
Feast is going on,go...

2250
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,375
Just now, I started
the concert.

2251
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,625
"Will the coalition of Villangam win?"

2252
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:38,917
-Vanangamudi.
"Will the marriage happen?"

2253
01:50:38,917 --> 01:50:40,375
What happened?
-Nothing.

2254
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:41,208
Mom.
"Will the coalition of Villangam win?"

2255
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:43,000
"Will the marriage happen?"

2256
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,208
Look here, I informed everything
to in-law.

2257
01:50:47,083 --> 01:50:48,500
What they'll do?

2258
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:51,292
Mom.

2259
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:54,083
I'm going to washroom.

2260
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:55,208
Deva.

2261
01:50:55,208 --> 01:50:58,000
Where are you going?
Stay back,if you're bold.

2262
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:03,583
Uncle,why did youget down?

2263
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:05,458
It's enough, son-in-law.
Caress my daughter, leave me.

2264
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:06,917
Uncle,see there.

2265
01:51:07,333 --> 01:51:09,042
Hey, he is Villangam.

2266
01:51:09,042 --> 01:51:10,750
He didn't change
even after thrashed.

2267
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:13,792
Uncle,see the person
next to him.

2268
01:51:14,708 --> 01:51:16,292
Who is he?

2269
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:18,375
He looks as if a half burnt
corpse from graveyard.

2270
01:51:18,375 --> 01:51:19,708
What's your problem with him?

2271
01:51:19,708 --> 01:51:22,042
Come close.

2272
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:27,708
Then who hit?
It's me,uncle.

2273
01:51:27,708 --> 01:51:28,958
Aah!

2274
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:32,208
He is the one
who hit my wife.

2275
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:33,875
So,you did everything.

2276
01:51:34,583 --> 01:51:37,542
Okay,go to the stage.

2277
01:51:37,542 --> 01:51:39,167
Go...
You go,I'll take care.

2278
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,083
He did everything and
got even offering of lord.

2279
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:45,000
He must be a
smart heister than us.

2280
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,750
Inquire about the whole problems
and get rid of those,boss.

2281
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,375
What are you going to get rid of?

2282
01:51:52,375 --> 01:51:55,000
That is...boss will tell.

2283
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,375
Stepney, ask her not
to astound now and then?

2284
01:51:58,375 --> 01:52:00,292
Can't think about
the next scene.

2285
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:03,333
Boss...

2286
01:52:03,333 --> 01:52:04,583
Stepney.
-Boss...

2287
01:52:07,292 --> 01:52:09,583
I will kill you,are you
going to sneeze?

2288
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:12,208
What is the scene?

2289
01:52:12,208 --> 01:52:12,875
I'll inquire and tell...

2290
01:52:13,292 --> 01:52:14,250
Director...

2291
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,667
Okay,sir.
-You may go.

2292
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:15,917
Come...

2293
01:52:15,917 --> 01:52:16,833
You go.

2294
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:20,500
Boss, what are you doing
with that guys?

2295
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,625
The situation is serious here.
But you're laughing.

2296
01:52:22,875 --> 01:52:24,125
What to do?

2297
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:26,458
Wake up the antagonist
in your mind.

2298
01:52:26,792 --> 01:52:29,667
Wake up him with an alarm.
-Boss,do something.

2299
01:52:29,667 --> 01:52:31,583
Puh! you accompany me
for long time...

2300
01:52:31,583 --> 01:52:34,375
...You could do something.
-I don't want to surpass the guru.

2301
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:37,542
Boss,just nod as yes,
I'll finish.

2302
01:52:37,708 --> 01:52:38,542
Thank you,boss.

2303
01:52:38,542 --> 01:52:40,750
I didn't tell you anything.

2304
01:52:41,667 --> 01:52:43,375
I'll show today,
who am I?

2305
01:52:43,375 --> 01:52:45,375
Excuse me, brother.
That side.

2306
01:52:48,042 --> 01:52:49,042
Don't you have a straw?

2307
01:52:49,958 --> 01:52:51,208
Give that.

2308
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:54,292
Why?

2309
01:52:54,292 --> 01:52:56,042
Will you drink
whatever he gives?

2310
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:58,917
We are the special guest
in marriage.

2311
01:52:58,917 --> 01:53:00,875
He is going to
roll down and fall.

2312
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:03,292
We are the chief guests
who came to halt this marriage.

2313
01:53:03,292 --> 01:53:05,625
He might've mixed something.
-What?

2314
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:07,667
See,is anyone having the glass?

2315
01:53:09,042 --> 01:53:10,458
No one is having.

2316
01:53:10,458 --> 01:53:11,875
I'll show you
the sample,now.

2317
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:15,333
Dude, you look very tired have this.

2318
01:53:16,167 --> 01:53:17,375
See.

2319
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:19,958
He has escaped.

2320
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:21,625
Shaven head.

2321
01:53:22,292 --> 01:53:22,750
Over...

2322
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,833
He has fallen down.

2323
01:53:25,167 --> 01:53:26,375
Do you ask how?

2324
01:53:26,542 --> 01:53:28,792
I used my seventh sense.

2325
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,542
What? Seventh Sierra?

2326
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:32,708
It's sense!

2327
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:34,708
You mean,sense!

2328
01:53:36,125 --> 01:53:37,542
Are you giving sedative pill?

2329
01:53:40,167 --> 01:53:42,125
This ring is to you.
-Be quiet,please.

2330
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:49,000
They may watch old movies it seems.
They're clear.

2331
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,375
Boss,plan A is a failure.

2332
01:53:51,375 --> 01:53:54,167
They shifted.

2333
01:53:54,167 --> 01:53:55,167
Oh,you've noticed.

2334
01:53:55,167 --> 01:53:58,083
I won't let off,my loyalty.
I'm ready with plan B.

2335
01:53:58,083 --> 01:54:00,000
The one who didn't fall
for booze will fall for beauty.

2336
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:02,750
You say that job so respectfully.
-Boss!

2337
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
What?

2338
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:20,292
I thought of finishing
the job safely.

2339
01:54:20,292 --> 01:54:21,917
It'll be a sharp wedge,
is that okay?

2340
01:54:21,917 --> 01:54:23,500
You're so jealousy.

2341
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:24,750
Who? Me?

2342
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:28,875
So far,has anyone accepted
your countenance?

2343
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:30,208
She looked at me amorous.

2344
01:54:30,208 --> 01:54:33,625
It's their plan.
Don't fall prey for that.

2345
01:54:33,625 --> 01:54:35,000
How do you find this?

2346
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,375
I said,my seventh sense...

2347
01:54:43,875 --> 01:54:46,458
Boss,all my plans are failed.
What about your's?

2348
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:48,333
Will you implement,even if I say?
-Get lost...

2349
01:54:48,333 --> 01:54:49,542
Uncle...

2350
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:51,333
Everything is ready.
You tie the nuptial knot.

2351
01:54:51,333 --> 01:54:52,375
I'll take care.
-What's the time now?

2352
01:54:52,375 --> 01:54:53,833
Wonder, what he'll plan!

2353
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:58,083
You get up and tell
when he ties the knot.

2354
01:54:58,500 --> 01:54:59,708
Sit down.

2355
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:04,917
Sit down.
Who is he?

2356
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:15,917
"Bang the holy drums".

2357
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:18,333
Stop it.

2358
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:19,333
Who is that?

2359
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:21,958
Boss,Villangam has started
his villainous job.

2360
01:55:24,333 --> 01:55:26,750
I will lynch you.
Will you tie the nuptial thread?

2361
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:27,750
See now.

2362
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:31,042
Brother,get up.
Tell the facts...

2363
01:55:32,042 --> 01:55:33,583
He is that.
Grab him.

2364
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:35,500
Sir...
-What to stop?

2365
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,583
A person sitting here,
a shaven head...

2366
01:55:37,583 --> 01:55:40,042
Stop the marriage.
Listen to me.

2367
01:55:40,042 --> 01:55:42,458
Go,they'll take you
to court.

2368
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:45,167
Inspector,also take the
person who stands out.

2369
01:55:45,167 --> 01:55:47,667
Priest, carry on.

2370
01:55:47,667 --> 01:55:48,625
Son-in-law...
-Aunt!

2371
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:50,958
Tie the nuptial thread.
-Yes.

2372
01:56:00,667 --> 01:56:02,292
We have won!

2373
01:56:07,958 --> 01:56:08,458
What?

2374
01:56:08,458 --> 01:56:10,375
Boss,how good you're in
implementing the plan!

2375
01:56:10,375 --> 01:56:11,500
You made the marriage
to happen.

2376
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:13,917
You plan from A to Z.
Mine is just a solitary plan!

2377
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:14,875
How,boss?

2378
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:17,333
He doesn't want
the booze or beauty.

2379
01:56:17,333 --> 01:56:18,542
He wants his car.

2380
01:56:18,542 --> 01:56:21,458
I bought a car,
changed the Colour...

2381
01:56:21,458 --> 01:56:23,292
...and slightly twisted
the story.

2382
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:26,208
But he doesn't know
the one he thrashed...

2383
01:56:26,208 --> 01:56:28,000
...is not his car!

2384
01:56:29,292 --> 01:56:32,167
Boss, you're the ISI trademark
antagonist.

2385
01:56:32,167 --> 01:56:34,458
When you do all these
for gratitude...

2386
01:56:34,458 --> 01:56:35,958
... how much I must do,
being a father?

2387
01:56:35,958 --> 01:56:38,750
She is my daughter.
-Boss...

2388
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:40,500
Enough,the film is going
to end.

2389
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:44,708
Mam,you've to give
the keys of the new car...

2390
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:46,375
...which your son-in-law
has to drive.

2391
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:50,083
In-law!
-Son-in-law,take the keys.

2392
01:56:50,083 --> 01:56:53,375
Drive the car.
-She gives a mini TV remote.

2393
01:56:53,375 --> 01:56:55,292
We managed everything,
but forgot this potato.

2394
01:56:55,292 --> 01:56:57,125
In-law,again from
the beginning!

2395
01:56:57,125 --> 01:56:58,250
We're finished.

2396
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:00,042
Go.
-Yes,aunt.

2397
01:57:00,042 --> 01:57:01,500
He's going as if
he has waged a war.

2398
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,833
How to drive
the car with this?

2399
01:57:03,833 --> 01:57:05,083
Where to keep the keys?
-Dad.

2400
01:57:05,083 --> 01:57:06,625
Where to keep the keys?
-Boss.

2401
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:08,167
Deva!

2402
01:57:08,167 --> 01:57:10,625
Son-in-law,better turn away
saying as seat is not comfort.

2403
01:57:10,625 --> 01:57:11,958
He has come.

2404
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:13,042
Don't know what he's going to do?

2405
01:57:14,167 --> 01:57:16,375
Aunt,what will we do
if buy a new car?

2406
01:57:17,375 --> 01:57:18,625
What?
-We'll go to temple.

2407
01:57:18,625 --> 01:57:19,875
Yes we'll go to temple
as a family.

2408
01:57:19,875 --> 01:57:23,125
We'll do Pooja.
-Yes.

2409
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:24,875
But,when the goddess is here,

2410
01:57:24,875 --> 01:57:26,792
Then,you must drive
the vehicle first,aunt.

2411
01:57:26,792 --> 01:57:28,542
He falls on her foot.

2412
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:31,042
Get up.
-He made it,superb!

2413
01:57:31,042 --> 01:57:33,375
You've to drive.
-You mean,me?

2414
01:57:33,375 --> 01:57:35,917
Yes,you can drive.

2415
01:57:35,917 --> 01:57:37,958
Should I drive?

2416
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:39,542
I thought he is
a heister son-in-law.

2417
01:57:39,542 --> 01:57:41,583
But,he is son-in-law with
good thoughts.

2418
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:49,333
Boss,shall I keep the lemon?
-Enough of talking, get in.

2419
01:57:49,333 --> 01:57:51,125
He too knows you're worthless.
Get in.

2420
01:57:51,125 --> 01:57:52,833
Bye.

2421
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,708
"Only a single car runs,
that's the chariot."

2422
01:58:13,708 --> 01:58:15,833
"Will sir drive it? Who is he?"

2423
01:58:20,917 --> 01:58:23,083
"A ball inside the bottle of soda".

2424
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:25,750
"Is there any car,
which goes amissed by him?"

2425
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:35,083
"Come here slowly,
he is the boundary of lies,"

2426
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,792
"Look here,who is he?
affray is his name,"

2427
01:58:44,792 --> 01:58:50,042
"Mother-in-law's looks
are different,she'll start fuming."

2428
01:59:19,375 --> 01:59:23,958
"It goes out of stations,
Even the car goes in speed."

2429
01:59:23,958 --> 01:59:26,375
"On whose words,
all these happen?"

2430
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:28,750
"This comedy didn't
halt even a bit."

2431
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:31,042
"A hide and seek game
is played with the car,"

2432
01:59:31,042 --> 01:59:33,667
"Even a jester goes on
with the car,"

2433
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:35,792
"A hide and seek game
is played with the car,"

2434
01:59:35,792 --> 01:59:38,500
"Even a jester goes on
with the car,"

2435
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:43,375
"He drives...He drives...
He drives the car well."

2436
01:59:43,375 --> 01:59:48,292
"He drives...He drives...
He drives the car by words."

2437
02:00:07,375 --> 02:00:10,250
"The car gives problems,"

2438
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:12,458
"Listen to this story well,"

02:00:12,458 --> 02:00:17,333
"Into this mind of love,
a mild sound is audible daily."

2440
02:00:17,333 --> 02:00:22,167
"A sickle hangs before me,
It's craving for the time..."

2441
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:26,958
"A sickle hangs before me,
It's craving for the time..."

2442
02:00:26,958 --> 02:00:31,875
"He drives...He drives...
He drives the car well."

2443
02:00:31,875 --> 02:00:36,708
"He drives...He drives...
He drives the car by words."
