1
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,542
<i>I've heard people say...</i>

2
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:48,125
<i>that darkness is very frightening.</i>

3
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,417
<i>But I find it comforting.</i>

4
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,667
<i>I wonder why people</i>
<i>are afraid of the dark.</i>

5
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,833
Have you seen Kumar John?

6
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:41,958
I've been looking for him.

7
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,125
I don't care.

8
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,083
All of you are going to die.

9
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,208
Do you have a matchbox?

10
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,458
-What for?
-To set fire.

11
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,333
John.

12
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,667
Kumar John.

13
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,667
John.

14
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,708
Birsa!

15
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,292
What are you doing?

16
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:14,167
Wonderful!

17
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,542
You are here already!

18
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,500
Come here.

19
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,583
Birsa.

20
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,375
Yes?

21
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,500
Did you see him again?

22
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,250
Yes, he was here last night.

23
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:36,625
What was that?

24
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,875
Come, let's go.

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,667
-No.
-Let's go.

26
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,500
Let's not go there.

27
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,417
Come on.

28
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,042
Relax.

29
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,542
It's scary, I don't want to go there.

30
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,292
Don't let him go, damn it!

31
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,083
-Move away.
-How dare you run away!

32
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,667
-Let me go!
-Move away.

33
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,000
Damn you!

34
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,125
-Let me go!
-Don't let him go!

35
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,208
I want to run away!

36
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,833
I want to run away...

37
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,583
-I want to run away!
-Take him away!

38
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,083
-Take him away--
-I need to run away...

39
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,708
-Come on!
-Let me go...

40
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,833
-I will escape...
-Take him inside!

41
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,375
Kumar John, don't go there.

42
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,458
Kumar John!

43
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,250
-How dare you!
-Let me go...

44
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,042
Sit down, all of you.

45
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,042
Morons!

46
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:26,792
Lock him up.

47
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,042
Bloody hell!
Why do you want to run away?

48
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,875
Don't you know that
you're here for a reason?

49
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,208
This mental hospital
houses over 2,000 patients!

50
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,792
And there are only 40 people
to look after you!

51
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,000
Try running away and
I'll kill you, you morons!

52
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,333
Damn you, fuckers!

53
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,917
Go ahead and tell this to
that shithead superintendent.

54
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,667
-Morons!
-That motherfucker never listens to us!

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,250
2,000 patients.

56
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:55,917
40 people to look after us.

57
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,292
Let him go.

58
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,792
Let's hurry. Get them ready.

59
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,708
The people from the NGO
will be here any minute.

60
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:04,833
Come on, Birsa.

61
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,458
Let's be quick.

62
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,458
Water? No! I am afraid of water.

63
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,792
She is my daughter.

64
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,000
My daughter!

65
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,208
Come here, you fools!
She's asking you to dance.

66
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,833
Mom, Kumar John has lost it.

67
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,417
A girl came to meet us today.

68
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,583
He thinks she's his daughter.

69
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,583
I felt like laughing, but I didn't.

70
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,417
Because you told me that
I shouldn't laugh at anyone.

71
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,958
Kumar John.

72
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Come here.

73
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,125
Look!

74
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,625
They are back.

75
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,125
-Doctor! Doctor, let me go!
-Come on...

76
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,167
Do you want to go home?
Sure! We'll take you there.

77
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,708
Be quick! Come on!

78
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,000
Come on!

79
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,292
That means, Rakkhosh will be back tonight.

80
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,833
"Stupid people everywhere.
Go around like they just don't care."

81
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:08,500
Do you know what that means, Birsa?

82
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,083
-Evil doctor and the mental nurse.
-Mental nurse.

83
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,917
-Worthless morons.
-Worthless morons.

84
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,958
Why are you spitting on me?

85
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,875
Whenever these two get together...

86
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,500
someone is bound to get killed.

87
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,125
How will we stop them?

88
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,250
Someone...

89
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,167
will be murdered.

90
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,333
But we don't know who it will be!

91
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,292
Who's going to be murdered? Tell me.

92
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,250
Tell me!

93
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,958
Sit down.

94
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,583
Answer me.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,875
Speak up.

96
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,625
Kumar John, this is a serious issue
and you don't seem to be bothered.

97
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,250
I guess you have lost your mojo.

98
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,333
Kumar John!

99
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,917
Answer me! What's taking you so long?

100
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,792
Why don't you tell me?

101
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,125
Who will be murdered tonight?

102
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:10,250
I am called Newton for a reason.

103
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,167
-They are crazy.
-Sure!

104
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:16,000
Newton used to sit beneath a tree.
But you sit on a bed.

105
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,292
You're not going to get ideas
just by sitting on the bed.

106
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Okay, I am sorry. It's my fault.

107
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,750
But remember this.

108
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,375
Never act smart in front of your mentor.

109
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,375
What?

110
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,792
And the diary is out again.
Does it have predictions?

111
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,708
Say something!

112
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,250
Earlier, it had records
of people joining in.

113
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,792
Now, it keeps a track...

114
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:48,708
of those who leave.

115
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,833
Are you going to predict something?

116
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,500
Not a word to anyone.

117
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,000
Trust me! I won't tell anyone.

118
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,500
Don't even tell it to your sister!

119
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,458
She never visits me.

120
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,375
No luck?

121
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,958
Who will be murdered tonight?

122
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,208
Who is it?

123
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:37,833
Hurry up.

124
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,083
To hell with Newton!

125
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,500
Today, it's his turn to disappear.

126
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,542
Oh my, God!

127
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,708
He is the one!

128
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,208
Will Rakkhosh go after him?

129
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,167
Yes.

130
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:01,958
Will he die tonight?

131
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,375
Listen to me.

132
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,542
I have to save him.

133
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,667
Birsa!

134
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,208
Is he the one?

135
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,458
No.

136
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,583
Where is he?

137
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,042
He's--

138
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,083
-That's not him.
-Birsa!

139
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,208
Three kinds of people are brought here.

140
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,667
One, those who are mental.

141
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,625
Two, those who are alone.

142
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:39,625
And the third kind?

143
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,208
Birsa!

144
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,667
Why are you in such a hurry?

145
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
And, you...

146
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,125
There are millions of
allegations against us.

147
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,625
We get punished for your misdeeds.

148
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,667
Come on!

149
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:58,500
-Hey!
-Hey...

150
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,500
What are you up to?

151
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,333
Hold on.

152
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,333
What are you doing?

153
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,375
You look like him.

154
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,958
You are the chosen one.

155
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,542
He is going to kill you.

156
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,625
Yes! You are going to die!

157
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,042
Am I going to die?

158
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,167
Get lost!

159
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,625
Kumar John, he's hitting me.

160
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,500
He's hitting me.

161
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,333
Bastard!

162
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,792
Why are you hitting me?
All of you are going to die!

163
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,333
Sister...

164
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,750
Hey, listen to me!

165
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,167
Listen to me.

166
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,167
Please help me!

167
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
These are minor injuries which will heal.

168
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,542
But what's killing him, is his loneliness.

169
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,458
<i>Let's hear the song from...</i>

170
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:05,042
I don't want to be here. No...

171
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,250
-Shut up and keep moving.
-No!

172
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,083
It's your turn now.

173
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,833
Come on...

174
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,167
I don't want to go there.

175
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,833
Sit over here, you worthless man!

176
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,583
<i>Karan...</i>

177
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:25,958
No!

178
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,792
What's the matter?

179
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,875
You're going to be next.

180
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:36,875
For sure!

181
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,542
Turn it off!

182
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,542
Your mother died because of you,
and now you are after your father.

183
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,208
-Come on. It's your turn.
-No...

184
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,625
-Come on!
-Get up!

185
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,917
Come on.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,167
-Come on!
-Please let me go! Please!

187
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,625
-Right here.
-Let me go!

188
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,292
-Tie him up.
-Let me go...

189
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,500
-Do it properly.
-Let me go.

190
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,667
<i>Do you know why Dad hates you?</i>

191
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,958
It's because you don't bathe.

192
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,125
Worthless fellow!

193
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,542
Doesn't he have a family?

194
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,875
Let me introduce you to my father.

195
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,542
Sister, can I come along?

196
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,583
Sure.

197
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:09,250
Dad, he is Dr. Partho.
He is here to check on Birsa.

198
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,708
I'm here to check on Birsa.

199
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,625
If you think he is normal...

200
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,042
do you think we are insane?

201
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,042
Sir, the people from the NGO
were here yesterday.

202
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,250
It was a usual briefing, right?

203
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,583
The NGO is called Morning Lights.

204
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:54,250
They verify all the records, sir.

205
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,542
This asylum is our society's dumping yard.

206
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:03,292
Has anyone ever complained
about lost garbage?

207
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,292
Sir, they are very curious.

208
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,833
Every madman is admitted here.

209
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,458
Relax!

210
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,958
The curiosity will last for a few days.
Then, they will forget about it.

211
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,083
Tapan, Som.

212
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,833
-Come on...
-Let's go...

213
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,083
Hey! Be careful!

214
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,542
He's a patient, not a piece of furniture.

215
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,250
You're not a piece of furniture.

216
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,750
I am not a piece of furniture.

217
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,542
How's your investigation going on?

218
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,917
Are you aware about that?

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,875
Of course!

220
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,958
You need my consent
to do anything out here.

221
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:11,708
Why don't you nab Rakkhosh?

222
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,292
He's going to kill everyone.

223
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,042
But why?

224
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:23,833
What would you both do,
if I were to stop him?

225
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,042
Both?

226
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,833
How did you know that...

227
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,500
Kumar John is on my team?

228
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,917
Rakkhosh is coming tonight.

229
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,000
We are going to nab him.

230
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,375
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

231
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,500
Kumar John.

232
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,958
Last night, I saw Rakkhosh
at the Jantar Mantar.

233
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,500
That's how he slays them, right?

234
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,250
Let's go and check it out.

235
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,917
We are not...

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,500
supposed to go there.

237
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,875
It's not meant for humans.

238
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:28,958
Come on.

239
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,125
Kumar John, let's check it out.

240
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:32,875
Go ahead.

241
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:34,542
I won't join you.

242
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,167
See you later.

243
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,250
Fine!

244
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:38,917
We are a team, right?

245
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,500
-Please go.
-Okay, bye.

246
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,667
I'll find Rakkhosh!

247
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,958
Where is Rakkhosh?

248
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,000
Why did you scare me?

249
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,333
John.

250
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't go in there.

251
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,000
It is believed that no one
leaves this place alive.

252
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,750
-Rakkhosh...
-Rakkhosh!

253
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,750
-John!
-I knew it! Rakkhosh was here!

254
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,375
-John, tell me.
-I was absolutely right.

255
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,083
He must have been very eager.
He didn't even spare the ribs.

256
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,083
What will we do now?

257
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,583
The monster ate it all.

258
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,417
Birsa!

259
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,833
Birsa...

260
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,125
-Birsa...
-John!

261
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,750
Get up!

262
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,042
Birsa!

263
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,000
Get up.

264
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,667
What is it?

265
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:52,875
Kumar John!

266
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,958
How will we get out of here?

267
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,083
You want to know how to get out of here?

268
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,167
Yes.

269
00:20:58,792 --> 00:20:59,625
Sit down!

270
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,625
What is it?

271
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,667
Show it to me.

272
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,500
Show it to me!

273
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,792
"I am hungry!"

274
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,750
"I smell...

275
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,208
humans."

276
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:28,375
What is this?

277
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,333
My plan.

278
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:31,292
It's simple.

279
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,375
Really?

280
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,750
Don't you think it's simple?

281
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,042
-Simple?
-Answer me!

282
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:48,500
How will we get out of here?

283
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,167
I have a plan!

284
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,417
Come with me.

285
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,083
Are you sure about this?

286
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,917
Yes, it's pretty simple.

287
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:12,417
I'll avenge us all!

288
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,292
Go away!

289
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,875
Come with me.

290
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,500
Come here.

291
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,750
No one's watching us.

292
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,250
Come on!

293
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,083
Come on, keep moving.

294
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,542
Go ahead!

295
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,875
No one is watching us.

296
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:54,625
Keep moving!

297
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,917
Kumar John, look!

298
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:02,458
Clothes...

299
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,208
Yes, they are for you.

300
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,083
It's simple, right?

301
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,667
<i>Life is easy, life is tough</i>

302
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:32,792
<i>Life is like wet mud</i>

303
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>Be happy, live free</i>

304
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,958
<i>Talk to your heart's content</i>

305
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,458
<i>Have a blast</i>

306
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:01,625
<i>Have loads of fun</i>
<i>Keep going...</i>

307
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:07,542
<i>Hold on to all the little things</i>
<i>Keep them safe</i>

308
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:11,250
<i>They are precious</i>
<i>Keep them safe</i>

309
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,875
<i>Let's play Kabaddi, my dear</i>

310
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,333
<i>Kabaddi</i>

311
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,375
<i>Life is easy, life is tough</i>

312
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,333
<i>That's right</i>

313
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:28,125
<i>Life is like wet mud</i>

314
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,083
<i>That's right</i>

315
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:34,042
<i>Be happy, live free</i>

316
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,250
Give me some mint.

317
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,250
Dad, it's you!

318
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,833
You're smoking!

319
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,500
How did you guys get out?

320
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:53,958
Fake daughter!

321
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,000
My daughter!

322
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,208
Fake daughter!

323
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,208
She's real.

324
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,458
At first, we were out.
Now, we've come inside.

325
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,917
But how?

326
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,167
Kumar John, she's not on our team.

327
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,500
He asked me to...

328
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:09,958
change my clothes.

329
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:11,750
And here we are.

330
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:12,708
Tell her...

331
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,458
And it was his idea.

332
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:20,917
No.

333
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,333
Both of you are getting treated there.

334
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,208
You are getting treated there!

335
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,417
You'll have to go back.

336
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,458
-No!
-No...

337
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,208
Won't you listen to me?

338
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,083
No... we're not going back.

339
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,542
-We won't go there.
-Alright.

340
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,250
I'll call them up.

341
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,083
They will drag you back to that place.

342
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,375
-No!
-No!

343
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,250
No, we won't go back.

344
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,833
We won't go back!

345
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,708
In there, people tend to...

346
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,042
disappear.

347
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:57,167
Yes, they disappear.

348
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,667
-Right?
-Yes.

349
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,542
You mean, they vanish?

350
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:05,750
It doesn't matter what words you use.

351
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,208
Alright, Dad.

352
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,875
Listen to me.

353
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,333
Hold on.

354
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,500
-Listen to me.
-Don't listen to her.

355
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,250
Let's do something.

356
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,958
We'll go to my office.

357
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,000
-Okay?
-No.

358
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,333
No...

359
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:32,750
No, Kumar John!

360
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,042
Let's go. We'll not have any water there.

361
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,042
I won't go there.

362
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:41,750
She's my real daughter.

363
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,708
She's the fake one.

364
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,333
I won't come along.

365
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,667
-I won't go there.
-Birsa!

366
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,542
She'll take you to your sister, you fool!

367
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:53,167
Sister?

368
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,042
Let's go. He'll come along.

369
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,542
Kumar John!

370
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,458
Kumar John!

371
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,875
Will she take me to my sister?

372
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:08,583
She'll definitely take you to her!

373
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,458
This place looks just like our hospital.

374
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Where's my sister?

375
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:25,500
She'll be here soon.

376
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:39,375
-She saw us.
-The nurse!

377
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,375
What is this?

378
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,125
Is this a joke to you?

379
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,417
Is this what you call security?

380
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,042
I'm going to call the authorities.

381
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:55,708
The patients are disappearing
because of your negligence.

382
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,417
I found them roaming outside.

383
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,750
They were out, Kalima!

384
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,375
It's my last warning.

385
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:06,792
If it happens again
I'll get all of you sacked.

386
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,750
No point snapping your fingers.

387
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,083
We don't have enough staff...

388
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,500
to manage 2,000 patients.

389
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,125
If you really care,

390
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:22,208
send some volunteers from your NGO
to help us out.

391
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:28,417
Besides, you're here most of the time.
It will keep you occupied.

392
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,917
-Bitch!
-What did you just say?

393
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,667
-Don't act smart!
-How dare you say that?

394
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,667
-Bitch! That's what you are!
-How dare you?

395
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,125
I found them outside
because of your negligence.

396
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:42,667
-Is this how you work? They are patients.
-Calm down!

397
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,958
-Quiet! Quiet! It's an NGO!
-I will not spare you!

398
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,708
Quiet! Calm down!

399
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,000
-Damn you!
-Let it be.

400
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,958
-Let it go.
-Don't you dare touch me!

401
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,667
Please leave.

402
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,542
Kumar John!

403
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,458
-Get them inside.
-No!

404
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,792
-She's a bitch...
-Shut up!

405
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,250
Bloody moron!

406
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:18,417
If you don't change your behavior,
you won't be allowed in here.

407
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:22,083
I won't be able to help you.
Please leave.

408
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:24,833
Okay, listen to me.

409
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:31,000
It's difficult to meet these two.
So, help me out.

410
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:36,292
I'll bring both of them to you.
But for now, let me take them in.

411
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:40,250
-Or else, Kalima will not spare me.
-Okay, get going.

412
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:46,333
-Dad.
-Hey!

413
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,583
Fake daughter.

414
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,708
Come on!

415
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,250
You asshole!

416
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,125
You think you can escape, motherfucker?

417
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,875
The next time you try running away...

418
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,917
Motherfucker!

419
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,042
Hey!

420
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,500
Let him go!

421
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:06,917
Look at this old man.

422
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:10,417
He still wants to fight at this age.

423
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,583
Fucker!

424
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:16,125
Don't you dare do this again!

425
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,167
Or else, you'll have to face my wrath!

426
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,542
John!

427
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,917
There was a dark room
back at my place as well.

428
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,583
I used to be alone there.

429
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,625
Now, I'm not scared anymore.

430
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,750
Because you are with me.

431
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,875
I hope you never leave me.

432
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:59,083
-Hey! Wake up!
-Wake up, you idiots!

433
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,750
How much did he offer you?

434
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,375
Forget about that. We have a lot to do.

435
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,958
We are quite busy.

436
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,625
Your time's up! Get inside!

437
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,708
John.

438
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,542
They tried to escape!

439
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:23,875
Kumar John.

440
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,500
Why are they laughing at us?

441
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,875
Will you try to escape again?

442
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,333
You think you're too smart, don't you?

443
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,333
Look at his face.

444
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,583
It is swollen up like that of a monkey's.

445
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,542
Hey, call those two idiots.

446
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,208
Kumar John, where are you going?

447
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,042
You like to escape, don't you?

448
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,125
I think he is going to fly out of here!

449
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,750
Fly out of here!

450
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,625
Come on.

451
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,458
Where are we going?

452
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:07,958
Come with me.

453
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,167
Forget about them, just follow me.

454
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,458
Come with me.

455
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,458
Get lost!

456
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:21,000
His Highness needs a special invitation?

457
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,042
Our ears are still ringing...

458
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:27,792
Then do something about it!
I have been calling you for a while.

459
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,542
Yes, Ma'am?

460
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,833
His daughter!

461
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:35,375
You've got fifteen minutes.

462
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,542
Get done with your work.

463
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,958
More time means more money.

464
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,292
Why are you here?

465
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,250
Let's sit down.

466
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,125
Please sit.

467
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:55,125
John, say something.

468
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,042
We were tortured!

469
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,833
Don't take it.

470
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,750
You are nothing like my sister.
She would never do anything wrong.

471
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,083
You are a liar.

472
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,833
Fake daughter!

473
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,042
What the hell!

474
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,583
He's ridiculous!

475
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,542
She is not your real daughter.

476
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,042
I've been under pressure with work.

477
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,333
I vented my frustration on both of you.

478
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,417
Why do you keep coming here?

479
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,375
Why are you after us?

480
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,792
What do you want from us?

481
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,792
-Dad.
-What is this?

482
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,625
Look at this.

483
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,792
John, take a look.

484
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,875
I work for a newspaper.

485
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,833
I am a journalist.

486
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,250
I write about all kinds of issues.

487
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,750
She writes...

488
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,292
You were saying something.

489
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:33,458
People disappear from here.

490
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:37,000
They don't disappear, they get killed.

491
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,958
Go to Jantar Mantar.

492
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,333
What's Jantar Mantar?

493
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,333
It's a platform, from where
people board their way to heaven.

494
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,958
Kumar John, why are you
telling her about our secret?

495
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:53,167
She's not on our team.

496
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,375
She's alone.

497
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,167
We need to help her.

498
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,958
So, what's Jantar Mantar?

499
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,417
Why do you come here?

500
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,917
Dad.

501
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,375
Please make him understand.

502
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,833
It's important that I come here,
I hope you understand.

503
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:36,375
Patients have been disappearing
over the past few months.

504
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,458
No one's taking an action.

505
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,417
Not even the police!

506
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,208
I need to do something.

507
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,458
Birsa.

508
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,583
This is our simple plan.

509
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:59,000
After all, she's my daughter.
She's bound to investigate.

510
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:02,250
Let her do it all alone.
Why is she after us?

511
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,542
Because I like to hang out with madmen.

512
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,000
She likes hanging out with madmen.

513
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,542
Madmen are found outside.

514
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:17,542
In here, we're all just patients.

515
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,208
That's right!

516
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:24,000
-We are patients...
-We are patients!

517
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,042
Are you mentally ill?

518
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,250
Yes.

519
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:29,792
I want it.

520
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,958
So, tell me.

521
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,625
Have you ever seen...

522
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:42,917
the patients who have disappeared?

523
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,417
Yes, at Jantar Mantar.

524
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:49,667
There...

525
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,792
-Rakkhosh!
-Over there.

526
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:57,208
-Rakkhosh!
-Rakkhosh...

527
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,458
The old warden house.

528
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:00,917
Hear me out.

529
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,333
The selected ones...

530
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,333
are taken to Jantar Mantar.

531
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,833
They are laid down on the platform.

532
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,042
Listen up.

533
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:13,042
It's Rakkhosh who decides their fate.

534
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,375
Listen up!

535
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:23,833
John!

536
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,125
Yes?

537
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,750
Hold this.

538
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,083
<i>Birsa.</i>

539
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:44,500
Sister.

540
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,417
<i>Birsa.</i>

541
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,875
Sister...

542
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,500
Birsa!

543
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,875
No...

544
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,292
Don't go with her.

545
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,500
Fake daughter!

546
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,833
She's not on our team.

547
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,000
Birsa!

548
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:41,958
Look at this, Birsa.

549
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,792
What are you looking at?

550
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:53,958
-Birsa.
-Sister!

551
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,417
-I had warned you not to go anywhere.
-Birsa!

552
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,292
What is this?

553
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,625
Janith... Janith Das.

554
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,167
<i>Birsa!</i>

555
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,208
Kumar John.

556
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:24,417
What is it?
Mahindar...

557
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,458
Nilesh...

558
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:44,292
She's talking to herself.

559
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,125
What is she telling herself?

560
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:52,792
Yes, she's talking to herself.
Your daughter has lost it.

561
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,208
Dad!

562
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:00,208
Your ward is usually closed at night.

563
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:02,500
Yes.

564
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:09,125
Your ward is 100 meters away
from Jantar Mantar.

565
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,167
Yes.

566
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,583
So, tell me.

567
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,250
How do the patients manage
to reach here, all alone?

568
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,958
Rakkhosh...

569
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,917
Rakkhosh!

570
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,875
Rakkhosh brings them here.

571
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,500
Don't be afraid.

572
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,500
He won't be coming today.

573
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,208
Why?

574
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,042
Do you have his timetable?

575
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,833
He's never alone.
He has two messengers.

576
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,417
Who are they?

577
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:50,625
-Evil doctor... and the mental nurse.
-Evil doctor... and the mental nurse!

578
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,083
How did you get hold of
these Ganjifa cards?

579
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,083
Give it to me.

580
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,833
How does this...

581
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,792
have a photo on it?

582
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,583
Did you fix it here?

583
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,292
He did not fix a photograph on this.

584
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,417
Then, who did it?

585
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,083
Think, John!

586
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:20,500
Who else touches these cards,
other than you?

587
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,292
The mental nurse's henchmen.

588
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,667
Yes!

589
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,417
Are you talking about Kalima's ward boys?

590
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,792
Yes!

591
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,542
So, you mean to say...

592
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,375
Every time a photo appears on your card,

593
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,542
someone disappears that night.

594
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,417
Yes.

595
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,042
I get it.

596
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,958
She's very smart.
The credit goes to her mother.

597
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:49,875
My daughter.

598
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,625
Birsa.

599
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,667
The night a patient is murdered...

600
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,958
you're put into isolation, right?

601
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,500
Where do they take you?

602
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,750
To the evil doctor's cabin.

603
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:12,125
There, they eat something half fried
with forks and spoons.

604
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:20,792
Am I right, Birsa?

605
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,708
They do...

606
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:36,833
-Swapnil.
-Her servant.

607
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:37,958
-Your son-in-law.
-Swapnil!

608
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:38,958
-Servant...
-Son-in-law.

609
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:39,917
Servant!

610
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,958
Swapnil, listen to me!

611
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,875
-Swapnil...
-He's your son-in-law.

612
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:46,625
Meet me outside the NGO within 15 minutes.
Get it?

613
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,125
-Her servant!
-Your son-in-law!

614
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,125
That's 3,000 rupees.

615
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,458
3,000 rupees?
Are you up to a bigger scam?

616
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,792
That's... your son-in-law.

617
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,125
-Dr. Idris' office.
-Your son-in-law!

618
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:04,708
Not a chance!

619
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,792
Swapnil, it's 3,000 rupees.

620
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:12,458
-Kumar John...
-Won't you take a risk for 3,000 rupees?

621
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:13,500
He is your son-in-law.

622
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,083
Won't you help me?

623
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,958
Well, you've chosen the right moment.

624
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:20,708
-Yes.
-It's lunch time.

625
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,333
Everyone... will be at the canteen.

626
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:30,500
-Your son-in-law.
-Wrap it up within fifteen minutes.

627
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:35,375
And... if you get caught,
I won't be able to help you.

628
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,333
Your son-in-law.

629
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:37,667
Servant!

630
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:43,167
Why is he here?

631
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:46,000
Come out!
I won't let him go anywhere.

632
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,875
-I will go...
-You won't go anywhere!

633
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,292
-I will go!
-Come out.

634
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,583
-You are a servant!
-Come out!

635
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:03,333
Why are we here?

636
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,625
Kumar John is not here.

637
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:17,958
This is where Rakkhosh lives.

638
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,000
This is where he leaves from.

639
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:26,750
Sister...

640
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,292
I am scared.

641
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:40,542
Birsa.

642
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:42,083
This is your file.

643
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:46,500
Why didn't John come along? Let's go.

644
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,458
I am scared!

645
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,708
-Birsa, let's go.
-Let's go!

646
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,958
Let's go.

647
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:05,250
-What happened, guys? Please be careful.
-Sorry...

648
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,125
Please be careful.

649
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,292
Don't worry.

650
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,125
Keep quiet.

651
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:15,458
Let's go.

652
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:21,167
I'm here. Don't you worry.

653
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,208
The mental nurse.

654
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:45,750
Sit down.

655
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,083
I didn't do anything wrong.

656
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,042
I haven't done anything wrong.

657
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,042
So, you've made new friends?

658
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,083
She's not a friend.

659
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,375
She's on our team.

660
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:04,458
Yes!

661
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,542
Is she the captain of your team?

662
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:09,542
No, I am the captain.

663
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:14,500
She's Kumar John's fake daughter.

664
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,583
-Really?
-Yes.

665
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,875
Why did she take you
to the doctor's cabin?

666
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,333
I don't know.

667
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:26,750
I told her that I won't come along.

668
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,625
But...

669
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:30,250
she forced me to--

670
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:43,625
You... want to meet your sister, right?

671
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,750
Sister!
Will you let me meet her?

672
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:51,667
Yes, I want to meet her.
I've been missing her.

673
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:54,083
Let's go meet...

674
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:55,958
your sister.

675
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:58,333
Tell me.

676
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,583
What were you doing
inside the doctor's cabin?

677
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:09,750
She's helping us catch Rakkhosh.

678
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,458
-Really?
-Yes.

679
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:13,458
How?

680
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:14,917
She's a journalist.

681
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:29,667
Tapan, Som.

682
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,625
No. No! Don't hit me.

683
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:36,292
How dare you talk to
reporters, you asshole?

684
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:40,417
Trying to act smart, you moron!
Do you want to meet the reporter now?

685
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,917
Don't leave me alone! Listen to me!

686
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,625
What have I done?

687
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:01,250
Mom!

688
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,708
Why did you leave me alone?

689
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,458
Please come back.
Come back.

690
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,500
Mom! I am scared!

691
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,667
Who's there... Who is it?

692
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:26,917
Mom.

693
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,458
Mom... Mom, I am...

694
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,583
Mom, come back.

695
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:39,208
-Hungry...
-Mom!

696
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,167
Mom!

697
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,875
I am hungry!

698
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:49,250
I smell humans!

699
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,083
<i>Birsa...</i>

700
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:54,083
Birsa!

701
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,583
Where are you, Birsa?

702
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,333
Sister, I am here.

703
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,125
Come here.

704
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:05,000
<i>What are you doing with mother's picture?</i>

705
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,958
Don't you keep saying that
a plant grows from a plant's seed?

706
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,917
So if I plant mom's picture,
she will come back to life.

707
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,792
You're missing Mom.

708
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:30,417
But I am here with you.

709
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:35,125
I'll take care for you
just the way she did.

710
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:41,458
I don't even know...
what she was like.

711
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,083
A mother is someone...

712
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,125
who always supports you.

713
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,625
-Just like you do!
-Yes.

714
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,000
You will always be with me, right?

715
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:57,250
I'll always be with you, I promise.

716
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:58,958
You sure about that?

717
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:00,958
Yes, absolutely!

718
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:05,792
You haven't been out for a while.
Let me take you to a special place today.

719
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:08,125
-Just clean up and get ready.
-No.

720
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:12,583
We will go out,
but I won't freshen up.

721
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:16,917
You won't take a bath?
Well, never mind. Come along.

722
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:37,583
<i>My heart</i>
<i>Half of it belongs to you</i>

723
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:41,083
<i>The other half belongs to me</i>

724
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,375
<i>The stars belong to you</i>

725
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:50,583
<i>And you belong to me, my dear sister</i>

726
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:56,917
<i>You are colorless</i>
<i>But you are here</i>

727
00:50:57,042 --> 00:51:01,000
<i>To make my life colorful</i>

728
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:06,333
<i>When you are around</i>

729
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,125
<i>Your brother is happy</i>

730
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,333
<i>You and I</i>

731
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:19,042
<i>Have a bond of love</i>

732
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,958
<i>Don't go away from me</i>

733
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:28,333
<i>Sister</i>

734
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:34,208
<i>You and I</i>

735
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,417
<i>Have a bond of love</i>

736
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,667
<i>Don't go away from me</i>

737
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:48,000
<i>My beloved sister</i>

738
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,667
Where did you take him?

739
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:03,542
He hadn't been out for a while,
so I thought of taking him out.

740
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:04,708
Right, Birsa?

741
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,833
Yes.

742
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:08,625
Why would you take him out?

743
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,250
He's a bloody burden!

744
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,125
This house belongs to my mother.
My sister feeds me!

745
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,333
Then how could I be a burden to you?

746
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,333
Make him understand!

747
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:30,750
I am your father!

748
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,583
How dare you say that?

749
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:35,958
Bloody retard!

750
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,875
Dad, you shouldn't have said that.

751
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,458
You can't be rude to him.

752
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,875
Go to your room! Go in!

753
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,958
I don't want to talk to anyone.

754
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:53,583
Sister, only you can come to me.

755
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:58,000
Mom, ever since you died,
everything has changed.

756
00:52:58,458 --> 00:52:59,875
Brother has occupied my room.

757
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,375
I have to live in this garage.

758
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,917
Why does Dad keep scolding me?

759
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,917
Am I not his son?

760
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:11,750
If he doesn't like me,
I won't like him either.

761
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,333
I miss you very much, Mom.

762
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:21,333
The mornings are manageable,
but the nights are scary.

763
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:28,250
That's why, I got this doll,
which looks like you.

764
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,333
Isn't it beautiful?

765
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:36,250
Now, I won't be scared at night.

766
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:37,792
Right, Mom?

767
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:39,542
Mom.

768
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,042
Please stay with me.

769
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,875
Stay with me.

770
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:48,833
Please say something.

771
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:50,500
Mom...

772
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:54,250
-I miss you--
-Birsa...

773
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:00,375
Mom!

774
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:04,917
Mom, I feel very lonely.
Come back to me.

775
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,917
Please come back...
Mom!

776
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:10,708
Come back to me.

777
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:14,208
-I am hungry...
-Mom!

778
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,750
-I smell humans!
-Mom...

779
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:22,917
-I am hungry...
-She is hungry...

780
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,625
-I smell humans...
-She smells humans...

781
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,542
-I am hungry...
-She is hungry...

782
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:30,667
Birsa!

783
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,625
Birsa! Stop it, Birsa!

784
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,333
-What are you doing?
-She is hungry.

785
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:36,167
-What's wrong with you?
-She smells humans.

786
00:54:36,292 --> 00:54:39,250
-She is hungry, she smells humans.
-Birsa...

787
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:41,083
-Birsa, calm down.
-She is hungry.

788
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:42,875
-Please calm down.
-She smells humans.

789
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:46,667
Birsa! Calm down, my dear.

790
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:08,125
Why did you turn on the video recording?

791
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,542
I don't like talking
in front of the camera.

792
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:12,125
Sister, please make them understand.

793
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,958
In such cases,
patients hear certain voices.

794
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:29,167
They feel that someone is watching them.
Maybe even out to kill them.

795
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,583
It would be better
if you get him admitted.

796
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,250
My brother is ill, he is not a retard.

797
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,208
No one's calling him a retard.

798
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:54,875
Mental illness is common,
just like physical illness.

799
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,542
Birsa, let's go.

800
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,375
Let's go, sister.

801
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,542
Please don't tie me up.
It really hurts.

802
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,458
I promise, I won't go anywhere.

803
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:25,125
-I won't...
-Birsa, I don't want to do this. But...

804
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:26,917
Dad will be here any moment.

805
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,458
And if he sees you without the
shackles, he'll get mad at us.

806
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,167
You need to be here.

807
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,083
Dad!
You took him out again, didn't you?

808
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:37,333
-Dad!
-Sister!

809
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:40,125
-Dad!
-Sister, please leave.

810
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:43,375
Or else, Dad will beat you up as well.
Please leave!

811
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:50,167
Sister, you should go...
Leave me alone.

812
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:52,333
-Birsa!
-Sister, please!

813
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:54,417
Sister!

814
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:57,792
-I need to talk to you.
-But I don't want to.

815
00:56:58,542 --> 00:56:59,458
Listen to me.

816
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,667
Dad will be here and he might scold you.

817
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:07,292
-Please don't be rude to him.
-I won't! Now, please leave!

818
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,833
Trust me!

819
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:11,292
Get going.

820
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:13,167
You must leave!

821
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:15,000
Go away!

822
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,333
Go!

823
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,417
I don't want anyone around me.

824
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:21,542
Go away!

825
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:22,833
Go!

826
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:26,417
I asked you not to take him out.

827
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,333
Dad, I just took him to the doctor.

828
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,917
Why? I told you not to!

829
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,875
But...

830
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:35,708
I need to take care of him.

831
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:39,708
This is my house and you will do as I say!

832
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,417
Hereafter, you won't even go near him!

833
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:47,958
I'll tell Mom that you're a bad father!

834
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,333
You're a bad person!

835
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,333
You keep beating me up!

836
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:54,750
-I will tell her everything!
-What...

837
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,208
-What did you say?
-Dad!

838
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,000
Dad!

839
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,167
-Stop it! Let him go!
-Beat him up!

840
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,375
Dad!

841
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:04,125
Let me go!

842
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:05,917
Dad, please don't harm him!

843
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,125
Damn you!

844
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,542
-Come out!
-Dad!

845
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:12,042
Dad, he needs treatment.

846
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,750
Devesh, don't let Shoma meet him again.

847
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:15,708
You asshole!

848
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,875
Food...

849
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:40,125
Give me some food.

850
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:46,542
I am hungry.

851
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:48,958
Food...

852
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,333
-Want some?
-Yes...

853
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,042
Yes...

854
00:58:58,208 --> 00:58:59,542
It's for me.

855
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:04,958
Food...

856
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,000
It's delicious.

857
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,000
-Food...
-It's just for me.

858
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:20,542
Give me some.

859
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:24,667
-Want it?
-Yes.

860
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,458
Wait, I'll give you some.

861
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:28,458
-Yes...
-Here.

862
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,542
-Have some.
-Give it to me...

863
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,083
-Give it to me. Yes...
-Have some...

864
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,958
Mom...

865
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:51,375
Listen...

866
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:56,792
Mom...

867
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:09,708
The elephant flies...

868
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,833
-The hen flies...
-The hen flies.

869
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:20,833
-Does a hen fly?
-No.

870
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,750
Does it fly?

871
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:26,333
Does it fly?

872
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,167
The hen...

873
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,625
Does it fly?

874
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,000
Come on.
Let's play again.

875
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,417
Come on.

876
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,208
The bird flies.

877
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:41,208
-The bird flies.
-Great.

878
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:43,958
The elephant flies.

879
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:47,250
The hen flies...

880
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:53,292
Does a hen fly?

881
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,792
Does a hen fly?

882
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:00,458
-Does it fly?
-No...

883
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,042
-Does the hen fly?
-No...

884
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:06,333
Does it...

885
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:19,958
Food...

886
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:58,583
Kumar John...

887
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:01,792
Kumar John!

888
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:04,458
Look!

889
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,708
The evil doctor accompanied
by the mental nurse.

890
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,333
Did you see that?

891
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:11,542
Kumar John.

892
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:19,250
Kumar John, tell me,
who's going to disappear next?

893
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:26,833
Kumar John.

894
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:28,708
Tell me.

895
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,958
Who's going to get killed tonight?

896
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:32,542
Tell me.

897
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:37,167
I can't understand your signs.
Just say it!

898
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,583
Tell me.

899
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:48,833
Where's your diary?

900
01:02:50,542 --> 01:02:51,833
Take it out.

901
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:53,250
Yes!

902
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,417
Yes.

903
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:57,833
Tell me who's going to disappear tonight.

904
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,792
Who is it? Tell me!

905
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Let's find out who the next target is!

906
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,167
Who is it, Kumar John?

907
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:51,917
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
Catch a tiger by the toe.

908
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,708
Tell me!

909
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,625
John, who is it?

910
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,375
Show it to me.

911
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,250
Why did you tear it?

912
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:07,000
How will we know who the next victim is?

913
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:12,125
At least tell me why you tore it.

914
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,000
No one's going to disappear today.

915
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,000
Birsa, no one's going to disappear!

916
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:20,750
No one will disappear!

917
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:23,375
Are you sure?

918
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:26,750
John!

919
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:31,333
John, listen to me.

920
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:48,167
<i>She is listening</i>

921
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:53,458
<i>To the noises</i>

922
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:57,667
<i>Someone sneaks</i>

923
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:01,292
<i>In here</i>

924
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:09,250
<i>There is some kind of conspiracy</i>

925
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:15,667
<i>No one in the world...</i>

926
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:17,333
What are you drawing, Kumar John?

927
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,667
Why aren't you answering me?

928
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:25,333
Who is the next victim?

929
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:28,333
Tell me.

930
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:31,250
John, tell me.

931
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:34,958
<i>When I turned around</i>
<i>There was no one behind me</i>

932
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:39,958
<i>Even the darkness was under its own gloom</i>

933
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,292
Sometimes, there's ought
to be a change in plans.

934
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:52,208
Don't worry.

935
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:54,417
Everything will be okay.

936
01:05:55,917 --> 01:06:00,375
<i>The doors are shutting</i>

937
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:05,000
<i>The light is shining bright</i>

938
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:10,125
<i>No one is here with me</i>

939
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:14,875
<i>The ghost is with me</i>

940
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:16,833
<i>He comes to me</i>

941
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:19,333
<i>Down his memory lane</i>

942
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:24,083
<i>He takes me along</i>

943
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:26,125
<i>In his loneliness</i>

944
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:30,458
<i>His memories are buried</i>
<i>Somewhere deep down</i>

945
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:32,958
<i>His loneliness...</i>

946
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:36,250
Tell me, Kumar John...
I need to know who the next victim is.

947
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:38,792
Who's going to die today?

948
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,208
That's the next victim.

949
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,500
This is wrong!

950
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:27,125
The prediction is wrong!
Tear it up, Kumar John!

951
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,750
Look at them...
They are here to take me away from you.

952
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:40,458
Her ancestors might have
committed a grave sin.

953
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,583
That is why she was born to them.

954
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:49,875
Mental nurse and the worthless morons!

955
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:06,583
You fucker!

956
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,833
Did you hear what I said?

957
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:15,292
You...

958
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:17,333
You're Santa, right?

959
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:23,125
Agree with me...
Come on, nod your head!

960
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:31,833
Today, let me teach you a lesson.

961
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:38,292
Forget those who are already dead.

962
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:43,458
Next year's Christmas...
will be different.

963
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:53,250
God will forgive...

964
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,750
a person like you.

965
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,167
For he knows...

966
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:06,333
that you don't realize your shortcomings.

967
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,375
That's because I can see everything.

968
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:12,833
I'm Santa.

969
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:22,667
No...

970
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:25,958
No...

971
01:09:28,292 --> 01:09:30,000
-John...
-Tapan, Som.

972
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,167
John...

973
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:36,042
-Come on.
-No! No...

974
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,500
John!

975
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:38,917
Come with me.

976
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,625
-No... John!
-Let's go.

977
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:44,333
John!

978
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:09,042
John!

979
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:10,875
They've locked me up!

980
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,792
John!

981
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,167
Rakkhosh?

982
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:38,708
Rakkhosh...

983
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:44,292
Rakkhosh!

984
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,375
Rakkhosh!

985
01:11:01,542 --> 01:11:05,167
Rakkhosh...

986
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:08,500
Rakkhosh!

987
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,125
No!

988
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:24,417
No... Rakkhosh!

989
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:26,208
No!

990
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:28,125
No!

991
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,917
Stop...

992
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:45,958
Don't kill me.

993
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,417
Don't kill me.

994
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:57,500
Don't kill me!

995
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,917
Rakkhosh!

996
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:03,250
I'm lonely again.

997
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,125
Kumar John has left me alone, Mom.

998
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:10,875
No one stays with me.

999
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:14,292
Everyone leaves me, eventually.

1000
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,292
You're the only one I have.

1001
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,083
Take me with you.

1002
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,208
I don't like it in here.

1003
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,708
Mom!

1004
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,333
Mom!

1005
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:40,000
Take me with you, Mom.
Mom!

1006
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:43,792
Mom.

1007
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:45,542
I need to sleep.

1008
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,750
I am scared, Mom.

1009
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,583
I am scared of the dark.

1010
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:56,917
Mom!

1011
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:02,208
Don't worry, Birsa.
Nobody can hurt you now.

1012
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:05,917
Rakkhosh will kill everyone.

1013
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,208
Sister!

1014
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:28,500
Sister, I spoke to mother last night.

1015
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,833
She told me that no one can
torture me now.

1016
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:38,958
Mom said that I am not alone.

1017
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:45,292
If someone tries to trouble me,
Rakkhosh will kill that person.

1018
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:47,458
Trust me!

1019
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,583
Birsa.

1020
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,375
Mom is dead.

1021
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:56,833
She's in heaven.

1022
01:14:58,125 --> 01:15:01,583
And Rakkhosh is a myth.
It's not real.

1023
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:07,542
Dad is not going to beat you up.
You are a good boy, right?

1024
01:15:08,292 --> 01:15:11,917
Devesh is not going to bother you anymore.

1025
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:15,167
Mom will never lie to me.

1026
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:17,083
She was here last night.

1027
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,125
She was sitting right there.

1028
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:25,458
She said, "Rakkhosh will surely come."

1029
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,167
He will kill everyone.

1030
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:30,875
I have to go to work.

1031
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:33,250
Be good to everyone.

1032
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:37,583
I'll be back in the evening.
Dad will be here as well.

1033
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:40,875
Stay right here.

1034
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:44,250
-Okay.
-Yes.

1035
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:45,875
I'll be back soon.

1036
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:50,042
Goodbye.

1037
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:59,125
Kumar John!

1038
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:00,917
Where are you?

1039
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:09,292
Birsa...

1040
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,250
Birsa!

1041
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:12,583
Birsa!

1042
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,625
Birsa...

1043
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:17,458
Why are you here?

1044
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:24,125
Do you know that
Kumar John has disappeared.

1045
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,458
I tried to save him.

1046
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,292
I know.

1047
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:39,917
But how did it happen?

1048
01:16:41,542 --> 01:16:43,583
Yesterday, his name came up
on the card.

1049
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:51,625
But it was Kumar John
who picked the cards, right?

1050
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:53,750
Yes.

1051
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:57,083
But he made a mistake.

1052
01:16:58,333 --> 01:16:59,958
There were two cards.

1053
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:02,250
He tore the first one.

1054
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:05,958
And the second one had his name on it.

1055
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:09,583
Look at it.

1056
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:24,458
Rakkhosh was here.

1057
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,542
He took my friend away.

1058
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:32,500
John!

1059
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:41,292
John...

1060
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,500
If they have killed Kumar John...

1061
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,375
I mean, my father...

1062
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:10,458
According to the official report,
John's death was an accident.

1063
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:13,417
He slipped and fell off the stairs.

1064
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:15,500
As per the records.

1065
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,208
I just announced it in a press release.

1066
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:21,167
But you know the truth.

1067
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,625
Ma'am, you are not getting it.

1068
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:28,333
John was killed because
he was mentally ill.

1069
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,667
After all, you are a crime reporter.

1070
01:18:32,042 --> 01:18:35,167
You are one of the suspects.

1071
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:39,417
I am your well-wisher.

1072
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,667
Coming here is a big risk.

1073
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:47,333
But it is important to know...

1074
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:49,792
who the killer is.

1075
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:53,042
You need to leave.

1076
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,958
I'll call you later.

1077
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:00,625
I will let you know where we
are going to meet. Be quick.

1078
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,917
Ma'am, please...

1079
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,667
Fake daughter!

1080
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:30,750
Kumar John has gone away.

1081
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,000
-His daughter has gone away.
-Don't worry.

1082
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:37,375
She'll be back.

1083
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:43,875
If anyone asks you, tell them
I took you out for a walk.

1084
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,250
-Okay.
-Let's go now.

1085
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:47,667
Come on.

1086
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:56,375
Why did you bring him along?

1087
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,417
You won't get your story without him.

1088
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:01,875
-What do you mean?
-Well...

1089
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:07,833
I'm just an ordinary civil servant,
who works under Dr. Idris.

1090
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:11,167
I don't like risking my life.

1091
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,208
Do you get it?

1092
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,083
Are the patients your guinea pigs?

1093
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:25,583
Swapnil, don't you feel bad
about all this?

1094
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:31,583
Please take a seat.

1095
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:37,292
Demanding 20,000 rupees from you
would have been unfair.

1096
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:42,083
Besides, you are doing
this for your story.

1097
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:44,958
I am happy with 10,000 rupees.

1098
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:48,375
It doesn't get better than this.

1099
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:50,458
Right?

1100
01:20:55,792 --> 01:20:56,875
That's a deal.

1101
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:58,958
Great!

1102
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,292
-Blurt it out.
-Sure.

1103
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:06,042
Dr. Idris takes special interest in Birsa.

1104
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,333
He meets around 300 patients every day.

1105
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:12,458
He gives them all one minute each.

1106
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:16,250
But he spends a lot of time with Birsa.

1107
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,167
What does that prove?

1108
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,333
Some doctors spend more time
with certain patients.

1109
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:24,833
Do you know anything
about Schizophrenia?

1110
01:21:24,917 --> 01:21:25,750
-Yes.
-What is it?

1111
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,708
It's a mental disorder.

1112
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:36,500
So far, no one has managed to find
the cause of schizophrenia.

1113
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,208
No one knows what the root cause is.

1114
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,625
Swapnil, be clear.
What are you getting at?

1115
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:49,833
I don't know much about
Dr. Idri's research.

1116
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:52,042
I don't have access
to his personal cabin.

1117
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:54,708
But I'm sure about one thing.

1118
01:21:55,458 --> 01:22:00,000
Dr. Idris is finding
the root cause of Schizophrenia.

1119
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:06,375
And Birsa... is his research subject.

1120
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,458
Let me go.

1121
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:16,083
Dr. Idris is working on a book.

1122
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:22,250
He had stopped working on it
some time ago.

1123
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:26,625
But last year, all of a sudden,
he took it up again.

1124
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:28,833
That's all I know.

1125
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:34,208
Birsa was brought here
exactly a year ago.

1126
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:40,000
Kumar John's diary states that...

1127
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:43,000
the patients are disappearing
over the past eight months.

1128
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,292
Absolutely correct.

1129
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,333
-Swapnil.
-Yes?

1130
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:57,167
I need access... to Dr. Idris' research.
Get it for me.

1131
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,125
Are you out of your mind?

1132
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:01,917
I can't take such a big risk.

1133
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,708
I can't do this.

1134
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:08,125
I am not a detective.
I'm just a civil servant.

1135
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:10,167
I can't pay you then.

1136
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,542
Ma'am, I can't take the risk.

1137
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:17,250
But... Birsa surely can.

1138
01:23:19,125 --> 01:23:19,958
How?

1139
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:25,542
I've got his sister's phone number
and address.

1140
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,042
-Sister?
-That is why I demanded...

1141
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,750
10,000 rupees for the information.

1142
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:33,333
Swapnil.

1143
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:36,333
You are going to become
a good detective one day.

1144
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,167
Give me the address and the phone number.

1145
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,917
Ma'am!

1146
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:45,542
Let me give you the copy of his file.

1147
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,917
I can do this for you.

1148
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,000
I'll take your leave.

1149
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:54,500
I hope you can...

1150
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:56,875
handle him.

1151
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,083
-Come on, Birsa.
-Yes.

1152
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:14,333
You keep talking about your sister.

1153
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,750
Where does she stay?

1154
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:19,583
She doesn't live here.

1155
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,750
She lives quite far from here.

1156
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:25,333
If she comes here...

1157
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:31,250
they'll torture her to death.

1158
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:37,917
Never mind.

1159
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,000
When you leave from here...

1160
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:43,250
I'll make sure that you meet your sister.

1161
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,792
And nobody will bother you after that.

1162
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,500
You'll take me to my sister!

1163
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,792
Yes! I want to meet her!

1164
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:56,958
I want to meet her.

1165
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:59,167
Birsa! Birsa...

1166
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:02,167
Birsa! Come here.
What are you doing?

1167
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,708
Get him! Get him!

1168
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:05,792
Where are you going?

1169
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,625
-Get him!
-Fake daughter...

1170
01:25:09,917 --> 01:25:12,375
She's going to take me to my sister.
Let me go!

1171
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:15,667
-To hell with your sister!
-Let me go.

1172
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:17,583
Let me go...

1173
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:18,583
Sister...

1174
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,208
Sister!

1175
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:02,917
Fake daughter?

1176
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:07,500
Are you the next victim?

1177
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:10,125
I did warn you.

1178
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,667
But I will protect you.

1179
01:26:14,917 --> 01:26:16,083
I'll protect you.

1180
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:25,917
So, you said something
about saving Ridhima.

1181
01:26:28,042 --> 01:26:31,417
Yes, Rakkhosh was going to kill her.

1182
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,792
But, how did you get there?

1183
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:52,667
I followed Rakkhosh.

1184
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:01,125
How did you get out of the ward?

1185
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:06,375
Rakkhosh is unstoppable.
So am I.

1186
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:19,208
Tell me exactly what happened.

1187
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:31,958
He escaped as soon as
she got into the water.

1188
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,333
And then, I saved her.

1189
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:42,083
Birsa!

1190
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:50,500
You have no idea how
important this information is.

1191
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,458
Oh, God!

1192
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:06,750
Yes?

1193
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:07,792
<i>Swapnil.</i>

1194
01:28:10,667 --> 01:28:11,542
<i>What is it?</i>

1195
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,875
-You asked me for Birsa's case history.
<i>-Yes.</i>

1196
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:18,042
I got the file for you.
But why do I have to meet Dr. Partho?

1197
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,167
<i>Why can't you meet him?</i>

1198
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:23,458
I can't take such a huge risk.

1199
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:28,000
<i>-Swapnil...</i>
-Why don't you talk to him?

1200
01:28:30,042 --> 01:28:34,917
<i>I tried my best but they aren't</i>
<i>telling me the truth.</i>

1201
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:38,208
<i>Besides, I can't face Birsa.</i>

1202
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:39,458
Why?

1203
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:44,542
<i>Give the file to my colleague.</i>

1204
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:48,083
<i>He'll let you know when he'll be there.</i>

1205
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:52,000
<i>Try to get some information</i>
<i>from Dr. Partho.</i>

1206
01:28:52,792 --> 01:28:54,083
<i>-Swapnil...</i>
-Yes?

1207
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,458
<i>-Did you hear me?</i>
-Yes!

1208
01:28:56,542 --> 01:28:59,250
<i>Get some information from Dr. Partho.</i>

1209
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,375
Ma'am, if I could take such risks...

1210
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,833
I would have been a stuntman instead.

1211
01:29:06,917 --> 01:29:08,500
<i>Swapnil, stop this nonsense.</i>

1212
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,417
I'm just an ordinary civil servant.

1213
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,375
Everything I have earned comes from
my meager salaries and hefty bribes.

1214
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,583
<i>Okay, listen up.</i>

1215
01:29:15,042 --> 01:29:17,917
-I don't like all this.
<i>-Okay, listen to me.</i>

1216
01:29:19,167 --> 01:29:22,000
<i>What if I pay you...</i>

1217
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,083
<i>10,000 rupees?</i>

1218
01:29:25,542 --> 01:29:27,500
<i>That's all I can afford.</i>

1219
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,708
<i>-Did you hear me?</i>
-10,000 rupees!

1220
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:34,917
<i>That's good, right?</i>

1221
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:40,125
I can take some risks
for such a good amount.

1222
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:44,833
I'll do it!

1223
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:50,833
My sister will come here.

1224
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:53,208
She'll take me home.

1225
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:59,042
-I'll go home.
-Hey! You aren't going anywhere.

1226
01:30:00,292 --> 01:30:02,417
Why not?
My sister will take me away from here.

1227
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:06,167
Stop dreaming, you moron.

1228
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:09,792
Your sister is married now.

1229
01:30:10,042 --> 01:30:11,333
Do you know who her husband is?

1230
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:14,917
Wait.

1231
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:20,208
My sister can never leave me alone.

1232
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,958
Dr. Partho!

1233
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:25,292
No!

1234
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:27,792
She can never do this to me.

1235
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:32,042
He got you here.

1236
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:35,917
Why would he take you back?
Have you lost it?

1237
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,958
-Come with me... I'll show you something.
-No...

1238
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:41,000
No!

1239
01:30:44,583 --> 01:30:46,000
-Please take me...
-Keep quiet.

1240
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:48,000
Yes, tell me.

1241
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,125
Yes...

1242
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:52,333
Yes, I'll be there!

1243
01:30:52,417 --> 01:30:54,417
Dr. Partho is here, let's go.

1244
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,958
-I don't want to meet him.
-Come on, let's go.

1245
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,667
I don't want to meet him.

1246
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:07,875
Dr. Partho.

1247
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:09,250
How are you?

1248
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:12,333
-Where is Shoma?
-Where's my sister?

1249
01:31:12,417 --> 01:31:13,292
What were you saying?

1250
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:15,000
Where is Shoma?

1251
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:17,333
We got a call from you.

1252
01:31:19,667 --> 01:31:20,625
Yes.

1253
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:23,417
I needed to talk to you
regarding Birsa.

1254
01:31:24,042 --> 01:31:24,958
What is it?

1255
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:27,708
You were treating him
before you brought him here.

1256
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:28,667
Yes.

1257
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:32,292
Why was he brought here?

1258
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,667
He's visiting patients.

1259
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,917
Sir, I was the one who called you here.

1260
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:44,792
I only follow the instructions.

1261
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,167
I don't know much about the case.

1262
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:48,708
Why don't you enlighten me?

1263
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:53,250
Dr. Idris is aware about his case history.

1264
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:54,333
When will he be here?

1265
01:31:55,167 --> 01:31:56,458
I don't know.

1266
01:31:56,542 --> 01:31:57,417
Where's Kalima?

1267
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,500
She is busy.

1268
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:03,042
I thought you would be
interested in his progress.

1269
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:04,208
Where's my sister?

1270
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:05,292
Birsa, wait.

1271
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:06,542
Where's my sister?

1272
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:10,708
How do you know that?

1273
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:12,125
Listen, I'm getting late.

1274
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:16,333
Sir, I'll lose my job.

1275
01:32:16,542 --> 01:32:20,542
He has been begging to meet
his sister.

1276
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:22,292
She isn't even willing to meet him.

1277
01:32:22,667 --> 01:32:23,708
Will she take him back?

1278
01:32:23,792 --> 01:32:24,792
You are lying!

1279
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:27,708
Sir... listen to me.

1280
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:29,417
I won't spare him.

1281
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:31,625
Damn it!

1282
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:42,625
Ridhima, answer the call!

1283
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:47,083
Ridhima, answer the call...

1284
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:48,917
I might lose the money.

1285
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:55,417
Ma'am, listen to me.
I can't help you any further.

1286
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:58,917
You'll get the photocopies
of the document.

1287
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:01,625
Yes, I'll send you the packet.

1288
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:03,500
I'll send it to your office.

1289
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,833
All right?

1290
01:33:13,667 --> 01:33:14,583
Mental nurse!

1291
01:33:14,667 --> 01:33:16,750
This... idiot...

1292
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:20,167
was talking about Rakkhosh once again.

1293
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:22,958
I was getting him to you, Kalima.

1294
01:33:24,167 --> 01:33:25,042
He's lying.

1295
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,542
Make sure he gets the shock treatment.

1296
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:28,667
He's lying.

1297
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:35,000
-Trust me...
-Shut up!

1298
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,042
-I...
-Come on, keep moving.

1299
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:40,083
Open the door.

1300
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,083
Come on.

1301
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,917
What's the matter?

1302
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:48,167
Where's his friend?

1303
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,500
Come on, go ahead.

1304
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,625
-Why is he here?
-Who allowed him in here?

1305
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,625
-Come on!
-Where's his friend?

1306
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,292
-I don't want to go in.
-Why is he here?

1307
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:59,917
-Why is he here?
-What is he doing?

1308
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,875
Sit down!

1309
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:11,917
There are three kinds of jobs.

1310
01:34:12,417 --> 01:34:15,208
Why is he acting like Kumar John?

1311
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:20,458
The first kind of job...
is the one that is done by you.

1312
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:25,583
The second kind of job is the one
that is done by no one.

1313
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,000
The third?

1314
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:31,083
The third...

1315
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:35,292
The third kind of job is the one
that is done by an unknown person.

1316
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,875
I am hungry.

1317
01:34:47,208 --> 01:34:49,625
I smell humans.

1318
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:55,833
Son-in-law?

1319
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:02,208
No one will disappear.

1320
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:04,792
I won't let it happen.

1321
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,708
I'll stop Rakkhosh.

1322
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:13,333
I'll stop Rakkhosh.

1323
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:19,542
<i>We have to find a replacement for Swapnil.</i>

1324
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,167
<i>I had to give him an early retirement.</i>

1325
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,042
-Why?
-It was necessary.

1326
01:35:27,792 --> 01:35:30,792
Birsa... aren't you happy with us?

1327
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:33,208
We take good care of you.

1328
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:35,667
She scares me.

1329
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:39,958
Just a few more trials to go.

1330
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:43,167
Then, we'll send you home.

1331
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:44,208
Back to my sister?

1332
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:46,167
Of course.

1333
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:51,042
But before that...
you need to complete the trials.

1334
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:52,625
Yes, I'll do it.

1335
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:55,417
Tapan, Som.

1336
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,667
-Come on.
-Get up.

1337
01:35:58,583 --> 01:35:59,542
Don't pull me.

1338
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:05,667
Sister!

1339
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:07,542
There you are!

1340
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:08,958
Sister...

1341
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:11,458
Sister!

1342
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:13,833
Sister!

1343
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,000
A few days ago, Dr. Ghosh was here.

1344
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:18,917
-I know.
-Sister!

1345
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,042
-Look at me.
-I need to know something.

1346
01:36:21,667 --> 01:36:24,708
-How did Birsa get Partho's photograph?
-Sister!

1347
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,833
Listen to me.

1348
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:29,208
Sister, listen to me.

1349
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:36,458
-Sister, talk to me.
-Wait a second, Birsa.

1350
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:40,208
You are using Birsa as a guinea pig.

1351
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:43,875
What do you mean?

1352
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:45,250
I am calling you stupid.

1353
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:47,292
-Why?
-Sister, won't you talk to me?

1354
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:48,875
I am here to expose your scam.

1355
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:52,875
Sister, take me along.

1356
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:56,583
How can you be so sure that this
isn't a part of his treatment?

1357
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:03,208
But the admin supervisor Swapnil
suspected the same thing.

1358
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:06,167
-Your brother is not a retard.
-So you know it better?

1359
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:10,167
-He is definitely not as crazy as you are.
-How dare you...

1360
01:37:16,792 --> 01:37:19,583
I know my brother better
than anyone here.

1361
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:23,000
I have loved him unconditionally.

1362
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,542
I've sacrificed a lot for him.

1363
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:31,083
But I still feel...

1364
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,167
that Birsa should be...

1365
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:36,208
kept here for his own betterment.

1366
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,333
After Partho left from here...

1367
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:45,542
he didn't come back home.

1368
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:51,042
The cops found his dead body
on the highway.

1369
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:56,583
My sister is crying!

1370
01:37:58,208 --> 01:37:59,208
Please don't cry.

1371
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:01,792
Sister...

1372
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:06,375
Sister...

1373
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:08,458
Sister!

1374
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:14,250
Why... Why did you do this to me?

1375
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:17,875
I've always protected you!

1376
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,875
-Why did you do this to me?
-Sister, I did nothing...

1377
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:24,292
-Don't hit me.
-Why did you do this?

1378
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:27,542
Sister...

1379
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:33,625
-Sister, I did nothing. Please don't...
-Why did you do this to me?

1380
01:38:38,042 --> 01:38:39,542
Sister! Sister!

1381
01:38:54,792 --> 01:38:57,083
Let me go!
What are you up to?

1382
01:38:57,833 --> 01:38:59,583
You don't need to do this.

1383
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:02,000
Tapan, Som.

1384
01:39:04,042 --> 01:39:05,667
-What do you mean by that?
-Come on.

1385
01:39:05,792 --> 01:39:09,125
-What do you mean by that?
-Come on! Keep moving...

1386
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,292
Let me go!

1387
01:39:19,292 --> 01:39:20,708
I'll tell everyone about this.

1388
01:39:22,792 --> 01:39:24,792
Come on!
Get away, everyone.

1389
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:26,875
Get away, everyone!

1390
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:31,500
-Get him!
-Don't spare him!

1391
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,833
-Out there to kill all of us?
-I'll kill all of you...

1392
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:38,083
I will teach you a lesson!

1393
01:39:38,292 --> 01:39:40,958
-Come on!
-How dare you go about killing everyone?

1394
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:42,667
Come on!

1395
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,333
-Come on!
-Get away, everyone!

1396
01:39:46,458 --> 01:39:47,875
Come on...

1397
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,333
Birsa!

1398
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:14,167
Ridhima gave this to you.

1399
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:52,917
Birsa, you are not a failed experiment.

1400
01:40:56,042 --> 01:40:59,583
You... are not alone, Birsa!

1401
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:08,333
You are not a failed experiment.

1402
01:41:08,417 --> 01:41:09,750
-Birsa!
-Come on, everyone.

1403
01:41:10,792 --> 01:41:15,958
-You are not alone, Birsa.
-Get going... Move...

1404
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:22,125
-You are not a failed experiment, Birsa...
-Get them all... Move...

1405
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:27,333
-Come on! Move it!
-Just shut up...

1406
01:41:27,417 --> 01:41:29,750
Come on, keep moving...

1407
01:41:31,667 --> 01:41:33,667
<i>I am hungry!</i>

1408
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:37,250
<i>I smell humans.</i>

1409
01:41:37,708 --> 01:41:39,708
<i>I am hungry!</i>

1410
01:41:40,667 --> 01:41:43,667
<i>I smell humans.</i>

1411
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:45,917
<i>I am hungry!</i>

1412
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:49,583
<i>I smell humans.</i>

1413
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:52,375
<i>I am hungry!</i>

1414
01:41:52,458 --> 01:41:56,667
<i>-I smell humans.</i>
<i>-I smell humans...</i>

1415
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:57,875
<i>I am hungry!</i>

1416
01:41:57,958 --> 01:42:02,500
Don't worry, Birsa.
No one will trouble you anymore.

1417
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:06,958
Rakkhosh will kill everyone.

1418
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:01,625
-Why are you doing this to him?
-He is a pest!

1419
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:03,375
Stay away from him!

1420
01:43:07,917 --> 01:43:09,375
He's a retard.

1421
01:43:12,125 --> 01:43:14,667
He needs treatment. Don't hate him.

1422
01:43:15,292 --> 01:43:17,042
He deserves hatred.

1423
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:20,542
I wish he had died as soon as he was born.

1424
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:28,417
Alright! I'll get him treated because
you are not ready to help him.

1425
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,208
You won't do anything--

1426
01:43:30,292 --> 01:43:31,125
Enough!

1427
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,708
Reporters like you...

1428
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:37,708
are very difficult to deal with.

1429
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:42,667
Your silly investigation

1430
01:43:42,792 --> 01:43:45,542
can hinder the process of
a scientific breakthrough.

1431
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:50,750
You're just bothered about
your story, right?

1432
01:43:54,792 --> 01:43:56,875
After all, you've worked very hard.

1433
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:59,792
You deserve to know the truth.

1434
01:44:14,667 --> 01:44:15,958
How dare you disobey me!

1435
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:19,375
How dare you disobey me!

1436
01:44:20,792 --> 01:44:23,375
Both of you are grounded!

1437
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:24,792
Devesh, lock her in the room.

1438
01:44:24,917 --> 01:44:28,333
-Don't you dare touch me!
-Lock her up!

1439
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,917
Birsa is not just my test subject,
he's my entire research.

1440
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:35,583
If I can prove that...

1441
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:43,750
Just imagine how useful that
kind of information would be!

1442
01:44:57,667 --> 01:44:59,208
What happened?

1443
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:00,167
Something is wrong.

1444
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,750
-What happened?
-Something's not right.

1445
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:02,833
Please come with me.

1446
01:45:03,292 --> 01:45:04,167
Let's go.

1447
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,250
Only I can cure you.
You need me!

1448
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Let me go!

1449
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:45,208
Let me go...

1450
01:47:58,917 --> 01:48:01,292
Devesh!

1451
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:03,625
Devesh!

1452
01:48:23,542 --> 01:48:27,250
Listen to me.
You can control anyone's mind.

1453
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:29,917
You think you're the
only one who can do this?

1454
01:49:52,583 --> 01:49:56,042
Are you going to kill your own father?

1455
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:00,917
<i>As a child, Birsa was naïve.</i>

1456
01:52:02,667 --> 01:52:05,750
<i>As he grew up, he was not able</i>
<i>to fit into the norms of society.</i>

1457
01:52:05,958 --> 01:52:09,125
<i>That's because there is a problem</i>
<i>in the way we are conditioned.</i>

1458
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:12,542
<i>What does a sick person need?</i>

1459
01:52:13,667 --> 01:52:14,917
<i>His medicines...</i>

1460
01:52:15,917 --> 01:52:19,042
<i>some care and lots of love.</i>

1461
01:52:20,625 --> 01:52:22,208
<i>But, what did we do with Birsa?</i>

1462
01:52:24,458 --> 01:52:27,292
<i>We dumped him in that dark room.</i>

1463
01:52:28,667 --> 01:52:31,458
<i>We only wanted to keep him</i>
<i>out of our sight.</i>

1464
01:52:33,667 --> 01:52:35,875
<i>Unfortunately, one night...</i>

1465
01:52:38,167 --> 01:52:39,458
<i>he went missing.</i>

1466
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,125
<i>The next day...</i>

1467
01:52:45,417 --> 01:52:47,458
<i>when he returned...</i>

1468
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:51,917
<i>he was no longer the same.</i>

1469
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,792
<i>I've heard people say...</i>

1470
01:53:00,333 --> 01:53:02,458
<i>that darkness is very frightening.</i>

1471
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:06,625
<i>But I find it comforting.</i>

1472
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:11,417
<i>I wonder why people</i>
<i>are afraid of the dark.</i>

1473
01:53:13,375 --> 01:53:15,417
<i>Maybe they're afraid of...</i>

1474
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:18,292
<i>their loneliness.</i>

1475
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:20,875
<i>But I am...</i>

1476
01:53:23,208 --> 01:53:25,083
<i>I am not afraid anymore.</i>

1477
01:53:27,125 --> 01:53:28,708
<i>Because I am not alone.</i>
