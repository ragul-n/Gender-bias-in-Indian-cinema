1
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:17,157
His name is Pappu,

2
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,587
height 5.10,

3
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:20,819
age 25 years,

4
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:24,724
but weight multiplied by 5,
that's 125 kgs,

5
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:26,299
his waist...

6
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:35,366
Oh no! Forget it!
Is it necessary to know it?

7
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:39,942
He wanted to do MBA,
do business and earn crores,

8
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:42,511
but with great difficulty
finished B.Com,

9
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:45,448
is now working in a big company
as small accountant,

10
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:49,522
but has great hope that he'll
become a rich man some day,

11
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:52,193
generally people have
one minus in life,

12
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,794
but Pappu's entire life
is a big minus,

13
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:59,400
whatever he wishes,
comes up to tongue and then slips,

14
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:02,498
he thinks he's very intelligent,

15
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,572
everyone know this except himself.

16
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:08,709
To tell him about,
words of Telugu fall short,

17
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,936
take a look at him yourself.

18
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:21,613
No need, I'm here, I'll serve.

19
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,858
This is our hero's character.

20
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,754
He likes sweets and loves laddu.

21
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:35,232
Actually he attends such
functions for sweets only.

22
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:45,509
- Another one please.
- No sir.

23
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,771
- Specially made sir.
- No sir.

24
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:49,576
Made with copious ghee and
generous cashew nuts.

25
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:50,979
Have it.

26
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,152
- One more.
- No sir.

27
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:55,317
Have it sir.

28
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,482
Just a minute.

29
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,267
What man? Where are you?
I knew you'd do something.

30
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,165
Come... come... I'm coming.

31
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:14,775
Come I say...
he has put me in fix.

32
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:18,309
Did you see? This is our hero!

33
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,914
He gets everything till mouth,
but can't eat it.

34
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:22,773
Most unlucky man!

35
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:29,390
Not just in the matter of food,
look at this...

36
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:33,460
He wants to watch any new film
on the first day morning show.

37
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:39,294
If he misses people will interpret
the story in their own style.

38
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,334
Moreover reviews and pirated CD's,

39
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:48,306
he thinks watching a film without
knowing anything about it is thrilling.

40
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,207
In fact that's true,
but I don't want to reveal it,

41
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:53,642
watch it yourself.

42
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,346
One ticket please.

43
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:07,424
I got it... I got it... I got it...

44
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:11,929
- Please sir one ticket please...
- I got it... I got it...

45
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:20,731
But our Pappu is very safe
in one thing.

46
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:23,878
Watch how safe driver he is.

47
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,715
He follows traffic rules
and regulations.

48
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,627
Why are dancing senseless on road?
Like a monkey.

49
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,366
Be careful!

50
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,737
Did you see it?

51
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:00,244
Even if he's in heaven,
ill luck will follow him,

52
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,781
how careful he may be,
accidents come searching him,

53
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,882
such an unlucky man he is!
Don't know how will he survive?

54
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:09,247
A life time will not be enough
to tell about him.

55
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,586
So forgetting about his past,
let's come to his present,

56
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,319
come, let's watch his future.

57
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,239
I'll meet him later,
I'll pick the note first.

58
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:22,381
My pants are torn!

59
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:27,923
Nobody has seen me, right?

60
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,932
The note is mine, thanks.

61
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,939
Note is gone but
my hands are dirtied.

62
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:53,777
Mother, I told you I'll get it while
coming back from office.

63
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:54,786
I'll surely get it...

64
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:57,955
Are you blind?

65
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,360
Stop...

66
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:28,280
Stop it!
What's this nonsense here?

67
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,118
Uncle, this is not nonsense,

68
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:35,763
this is not foolishness but
actually a form of art.

69
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,326
Mad boy! Is there any art
that I don't know?

70
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,868
Are these jumping and
swinging like monkey an art?

71
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:45,570
Your days were different
from our days,

72
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,867
talents too differ from
your gen to my gen.

73
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,302
Rascal! I'll kill you!

74
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:55,609
He'll not listen... stop I say!

75
00:08:55,817 --> 00:09:02,817
Brother-in-law please don't...
Dancing with kids without studying.

76
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:07,351
Poor Chanti always gets beaten up
by his brother-in-law.

77
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:10,896
I'll instill courage and
make him avenge for this.

78
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,576
Why this dear?
You're not coming with, right?

79
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,696
What happened?

80
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,825
He's always like this.

81
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,929
He goes normal but always
returns abnormal.

82
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,629
You carry on...
what's it, Pappu?

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,830
Why did you call me?

84
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,669
Your brother-in-law beats
you every day, right?

85
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,700
Yes Pappu.

86
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:26,533
- Don't you feel like avenging him?
- I do, Pappu.

87
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,768
- Can't you take revenge then?
- I'm taking it every day.

88
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:32,811
Are you taking revenge
on your brother-in-law? How?

89
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:36,451
I clean the toilets every day.

90
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:41,589
How will you take revenge on your
brother-in-law by cleaning toilets?

91
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,781
That is... that is...

92
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,323
No problem, carry on.

93
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:49,324
I clean the toilet with
my brother-in-law's toothbrush.

94
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:52,624
Oh! You're not a kid!

95
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:56,600
Is the punishment so nasty
to beat kids?

96
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,330
I'll never beat kids in my life.

97
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:09,545
Stop it! What actually had happened?

98
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,616
Today morning what had
happened was...

99
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:44,410
- I'm not fine, I'm angry.
- Why? On me?

100
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:47,417
- No, on my colleagues.
- Why? What happened?

101
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:49,214
Forget it.

102
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:52,655
I wanted to meet your boss
today and impress him.

103
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,829
But I depressed a girl.

104
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:58,423
It's routine to you.
Please see I get a job there.

105
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:03,434
If you're interested,
I'll do anything to get you a job.

106
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:06,334
Do anything...
Don't say anything,

107
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,567
come to my office with
your certificates by 10 am,

108
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,872
- I'll you my boss' weakness.
- Okay.

109
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,613
I'll send the mail by 6.30 pm.

110
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,249
Emad' Rajesh!

111
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,187
Silencer is coming!

112
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,485
Silencer is coming!

113
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:16,944
Hey Rajesh!

114
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,904
What happened?

115
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,750
- Office turned silent suddenly.
- What's the problem?

116
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:26,252
Sound problem?
Tell me clearly.

117
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:29,321
My boss has a weakness.

118
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:32,254
He hates anyone talking loudly
or making noise.

119
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,893
What's this stupid weakness?

120
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:35,853
What's this stupid weakness?

121
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,228
- He's like that.
- Strange weakness.

122
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,230
I told you about this only on phone.

123
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:45,168
Boss will ask you more
about sound than office.

124
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:47,466
Thank you very much for this hint.

125
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:49,667
I'll munch him like mint.

126
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:52,438
Munch him but without
making any sound.

127
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,744
I know your qualifications,

128
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:36,788
I'll now ask few questions
about your character.

129
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:37,820
Please go ahead sir.

130
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:41,589
What will you do if your
hand gets a burn?

131
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:45,425
I'll apply ointment without shouting.

132
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:52,295
Which animal you love the most?

133
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,635
- I like ants very much sir.
- Why?

134
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:58,904
It bites but never cries.

135
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:10,452
Do you like writer or music director?

136
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,287
- I like writer, sir.
- Why?

137
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,522
He'll write silently without talking.

138
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:24,330
I like you very much.

139
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,875
I like your attitude.
Totally I like your character.

140
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,774
You can join tomorrow.

141
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:39,715
I'll give you the
appointment letter now.

142
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,741
What is this?

143
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,813
Sign this cheque, sir.

144
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:44,778
Rs.40 lakhs? Why?

145
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:47,614
You asked me to book Audi car
for Radha's birthday gift.

146
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:49,949
I forgot that.

147
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,785
Tomorrow is my daughter's
birthday, right? Yes sir.

148
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:57,626
I'll ask them to deliver it today.
Wait, don't tell them now.

149
00:16:57,832 --> 00:16:59,629
I'll talk to Swamiji first.

150
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:10,544
Greetings Swamiji!

151
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,236
Greetings Lingaraju! What's the matter?

152
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:17,248
Nothing sir, we got the tender
with your blessings.

153
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:22,185
- I called you to inform about it.
- Good, it's all God's grace.

154
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,518
Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday,
I'm giving her a car as gift.

155
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:28,161
Which number will be best for her?

156
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,730
Whatever the numbers be,
ensure that the total comes to 9.

157
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,127
Everything will be fine.

158
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,768
Okay Swamiji,
I'll follow your instructions.

159
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,404
Bye Swamiji.

160
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:45,706
I've messaged them about this.

161
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,779
That's why I like you.

162
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:52,446
Send someone to home
with the car tomorrow.

163
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,781
My daughter will be surprised
to see the car.

164
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,721
Ruined me... you've ruined me totally.

165
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,589
You ruined not just one or two
but 100 crores.

166
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:03,457
Swamiji warned us,
yet you didn't care.

167
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,599
I made a mistake, brother.
Please forgive me.

168
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,267
Please save me.

169
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,369
I'll follow your orders
hereafter in my life.

170
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:12,563
Please save me, brother.

171
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,308
You've put me in a fix.

172
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:23,175
Let me talk to Swamiji first.
Sit next to me.

173
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:32,256
Greetings Swamiji!

174
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:53,612
Sorry Singaraju!
I can't help you out from this.

175
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,610
Face it on your own.

176
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,566
How fast you've grown up!

177
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,237
You were like a little baby
till few days ago.

178
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:21,238
Do you think words will
make me happy?

179
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,540
I was busy, I couldn't get it myself

180
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,443
I'll surely get it next time.

181
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,917
I'm your daughter,
I'm not innocent to believe you.

182
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,755
- Tell me what's the gift, daddy.
- I'll not tell you.

183
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:44,598
I'll not tell you.
I'll show you.

184
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:47,767
Show me? Where is it?
Come on show me!

185
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:51,932
I'll tell you where it is,
go and see it yourself.

186
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:08,281
Dad! Is it any large size
Teddy bear this time?

187
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:09,786
Teddy bear?

188
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:13,453
Not him!

189
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,464
Look there, the Audi car you love.

190
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,522
My heart is enchanted...

191
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:51,324
Thinks about you only...

192
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:55,229
An angel on the road...

193
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:58,928
Seeing her is magic...

194
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:06,307
When I see her,
I start believing God...

195
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:13,414
A statue yet to open the eyes...

196
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:17,284
Millions of shy flowers blooming...

197
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,619
A sin that has come
to wipe out men...

198
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,955
What happened to me today?

199
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:26,300
What is this new commotion
in my heart?

200
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:31,302
Shining garland of clouds.
Who is the girl?

201
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,235
My boss' daughter.

202
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,973
- Is she beautiful?
- Very!

203
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:43,405
How do you I was thinking
about a girl, mother?

204
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:47,679
- Am I thinking so much?
- Not much but little strangely.

205
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,653
Radha hugged me, mother.

206
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:53,326
- Who is this Radha?
- My boss' daughter.

207
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:56,929
Boss' daughter?
Why did she hug you?

208
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,428
May be she loves you.

209
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,296
I'm not that lucky, mom.

210
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:07,133
You say may be,
shouldn't a girl like Radha love me?

211
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:11,802
No son, a good boy like you
will get a good girl.

212
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,374
Thanks mom.

213
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,794
From today she'll work with you.

214
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,625
That's why I like you.

215
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,970
From today you're working with them.

216
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:50,517
Got scared of boss' daughter,
but you're cool.

217
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:52,185
I'm very happy.

218
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:53,979
Aren't you?

219
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:58,382
Take me as one of you,
can be friendly with me,

220
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,258
Pappu, come here.

221
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:09,598
Forgot to introduce you
to an important person,

222
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:11,271
his name is Pappu,

223
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:15,306
every small mistake he makes
turns into a big disaster.

224
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,444
I'll show you my slipper then.

225
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,268
I was just joking.

226
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,778
He's our office accountant.

227
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,416
You came to my home yesterday, right?

228
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,884
You remember very well, madam.

229
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,586
How can I forget you, Teddy bear?

230
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,520
You brought the most
beautiful gift on my birthday.

231
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:37,358
Call me Radha, I hate madam.

232
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:42,434
- Why are you here, Radha?
- Radha will work with us from today.

233
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:52,676
Why did you give plastic flowers
while others gave real flowers?

234
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,974
Brother, what you gave doesn't count
but when you gave counts.

235
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:01,152
Stop it!

236
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,289
What do you think of Pappu?

237
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:05,425
What do you know about Pappu?

238
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:08,356
Pappu is fire!

239
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:10,755
Is it?

240
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:12,660
What else you know about him?

241
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:16,428
Do you know about his courageous act?
What did he do?

242
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:19,697
He kicked on the lion's head.

243
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,904
Do you think that's all?
There's much more.

244
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,339
He pulled it's tail from behind.

245
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,214
What else did he do?

246
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:33,854
He caught an elephant
and broke it's tusks.

247
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,553
Is it?
What happened then?

248
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:37,056
What will happen?

249
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:41,418
Toy shop owner came
and threw out Pappu.

250
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:46,464
Do I look like a fool?

251
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,658
One more word on me
and I'll break your teeth.

252
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,462
Like breaking the elephant's tusks?

253
00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:00,747
Sadhana's quotation is lesser
than Gemini Telecommunications.

254
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:06,786
- Why are you so excited?
- I love butterflies!

255
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:10,419
I always wanted to catch
but never could.

256
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:14,917
Hear the voice of heart,
hear the voice of heart.

257
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:20,400
I'll catch a butterfly
and impress Radha.

258
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,398
I'll show her my prowess.

259
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:56,563
I caught it for you with
great difficulty.

260
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:59,426
Difficulty was yours but
boss lost heavily.

261
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:00,896
What happened, sir?

262
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:03,897
Asking me what had happened?
Look around you!

263
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,370
See!

264
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:39,563
Where's my gift then?

265
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:42,902
Will you offer sweets
if we give the gift?

266
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:45,302
Kids! What can they give?

267
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:48,607
They will give the gift which nobody
else can give in this world, mother.

268
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:50,807
What's that big gift?

269
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,152
You want to see?

270
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:54,821
Give me the gift,
mother wants to see.

271
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,524
Enough kids, your gift is indeed great.

272
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:01,718
Come, I'll give you sweets.
He'll take bath and come.

273
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:05,296
Come on kids. Fast...

274
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:20,881
Many birthdays are getting over, when
will I get a girl who understands me?

275
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:23,409
- You will get, son.
- What is this mother?

276
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:25,380
Lord Hanuman's locket.

277
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:30,381
Hereafter it is good time for you.
Trust God!

278
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:38,253
Can never forget mother and
this Ambica Durbar incense sticks.

279
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,626
Keep quiet son.

280
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:41,325
Bye mom.

281
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,074
What's the matter?
You look very smart today.

282
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:59,612
Ain't I? Today is my birthday.

283
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,358
Pappu, you look very handsome today.

284
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:14,767
Isn't he like Mahesh Babu
from this side?

285
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,044
Whatever you may say,
Pappu is the greatest.

286
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:36,752
- Why?
- Asking me why?

287
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:41,394
Pappu is equal to all their
weight put together.

288
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:56,265
Take the file, Radha.
Done already? Yes.

289
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,411
All mistakes.

290
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:06,745
- Who did this?
- Pappu did it.

291
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:11,186
- Why did you give it to that fatso?
- You all are... useless people.

292
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,622
Don't you know which work
must be allotted to whom?

293
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:18,322
He destroyed the entire office
to catch a butterfly.

294
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:22,525
Don't you know you mustn't let
him do such an important work?

295
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:38,182
No need to scold so much
for such a small mistake.

296
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,182
Moreover today is his birthday.

297
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,651
Poor man would be feeling very bad.

298
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:59,602
Are you coming here, or
shall I come to you getting wet?

299
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,441
What?

300
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:08,339
I shouldn't have shouted on you.

301
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,408
No problem.

302
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:14,217
It seems today is your birthday.

303
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,618
You gave chocolates
to others in office,

304
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:20,157
where's my chocolate?

305
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:23,194
- Will you give a gift for my chocolate?
- Definitely.

306
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:27,629
But you must come with me.
I was just joking.

307
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:43,310
Slowly you've come to me
like a peeve...

308
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:58,659
Slowly you've come to me
like a drop of rain...

309
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:10,270
Slowly... slowly...
a friendship is flowering...

310
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:53,842
Have we come closer?

311
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:57,679
Have I found a friend?

312
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:01,486
Is it a boon today?

313
00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:07,759
Don't know if it's confusion
in this happiness?

314
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,236
Did I realize it in your company?

315
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,604
Have I become yours?

316
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:25,212
Has it reached you today?

317
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:36,523
Has spring entered my life?

318
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:43,635
Is it calling me?

319
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:47,568
Can't stop myself anymore?

320
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:54,775
Are you the sweet honeybees?

321
00:33:55,716 --> 00:34:02,716
Are you my happy fate?

322
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,691
Are you the cool moonbeam?

323
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:10,921
Shall I have it for myself?

324
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:36,948
What?
Why have you come all together?

325
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:39,292
You promised something for
Lord Ganesha's festival.

326
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:40,460
What did I promise?

327
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,461
You said let's celebrate
Goddess' festival too for Dussera.

328
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,431
- You want donation?
- Yes, donate.

329
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:54,732
- Happy?
- Very happy, Pappu.

330
00:34:55,309 --> 00:35:00,246
Remember one thing, ensure to upstage
the neighbouring colony in celebrations.

331
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:03,883
Collect money from everyone,
if anyone refuses, tell me.

332
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,718
I'll rip their skin to collect.

333
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:09,286
- All have given except one man.
- Who?

334
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,754
- Who else?
- My sadist brother-in-law!

335
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,524
Your brother-in-law is foolish rogue.

336
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,923
Good and social activity
are unknown words to him.

337
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:20,266
Come, I'll collect from him.

338
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:44,519
It seems you refused
to donate for festival.

339
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,285
- Won't you give if they ask?
- You know about me, right?

340
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:50,292
I'm a rogue, I don't know what
I'll do if I get angry.

341
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:51,623
Give money.

342
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:13,909
Never cross swords with me,
I'll make you throw up with a look.

343
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:17,121
- You don't know about me.
- Why are you still here?

344
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:18,916
You want donation?

345
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:20,317
That's it!

346
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:27,589
He's not this or that,
Pappu is the hero...

347
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:38,175
Dussera celebrations are going on,
our company is sponsoring it,

348
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:39,902
so, let's all enjoy it.

349
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,679
Boss told me to intimate you this.

350
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:44,442
Okay? Tomorrow sharp at 7 pm.

351
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:51,384
Welcome to this program
sponsored by Tata lndicom.

352
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:27,385
Oh look at this innocent simpleton...

353
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:35,331
Look at this walking mountain...

354
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:51,178
He's like Tirupathi Laddu...
he eats like a gargantuan...

355
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:54,286
Takes a step every hour...

356
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:06,392
He's rotund and huge...

357
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,228
He's Pappu...
he's fat like hippo...

358
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:46,333
When we hear about him,
he appears like Lord Ganesha...

359
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:53,940
We must offer the warding of evil
and immerse him in water...

360
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:58,379
How many tales about him?

361
00:38:58,585 --> 00:39:02,214
If we go on abuse him,
abuses fall short...

362
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:06,085
Did Brahma got ample to time
to throw him down?

363
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:10,559
It rolled on to earth...

364
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:51,598
if anyone sees you early morning,
will think Saturn is looking at him...

365
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:59,339
if Tsunami hits, he thinks
something funny is pushing him...

366
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,848
Should've to see a boy like him?

367
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:07,516
If we see you now,
our next birth will get ruined...

368
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:11,316
You're the teddy bear...

369
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:15,427
Man with curly hair...

370
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:20,952
He spoiled my dress.

371
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:37,806
Who are you? Leave her.

372
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:42,644
Leave her...

373
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:45,842
Leaver her...

374
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:47,877
Go man!

375
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:56,821
That's why I like you.

376
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:58,389
Sir, this too.

377
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,605
What happened, Seenu?
Why are you hurt?

378
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:12,403
After last night's party, some people
attacked me & kidnapped Radha madam.

379
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:15,374
What?
Hasn't Radha come home last night?

380
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:19,613
Why didn't you tell me about this?
I mean...

381
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:21,286
Why are you hesitating?

382
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:25,551
Who is speaking?

383
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,225
What?

384
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:32,764
I'm just a collection boy to take money
from you and deliver your girl.

385
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:35,230
Where is my daughter?
Tell me.

386
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:40,563
I've already answered your
three questions.

387
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:42,799
Still didn't get me?

388
00:42:43,276 --> 00:42:45,801
I'll tell you again... listen.

389
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:49,977
Rs.100 crores...3 days... if not...

390
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:55,386
Dear... don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

391
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:59,691
I don't think you need
any more information.

392
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:04,762
I'll call you after three days,
keep the money ready.

393
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,396
What happened sir?

394
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:14,270
Why are you tensed?

395
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,776
My daughter has been kidnapped.

396
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,677
Asking ransom of Rs.100 crores.

397
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:22,141
Brother, you don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

398
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,147
- I'll call police immediately.
- No sir, please don't do it, sir.

399
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,321
- Why not?
- Think for a minute sir.

400
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:29,920
Ours is a large limited company,

401
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,017
entire property is on
your daughter's name,

402
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:36,160
if you call police now,
media will paint the town red with it.

403
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,161
There's a chance of our share
value falling down drastically.

404
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,631
What shall we do now?
Who will solve this problem?

405
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:45,805
- There's one man. Detective Ram.
- Detective Ram?

406
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:46,938
Very intelligent.

407
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:50,708
He has solved many political
scams and murders cleverly.

408
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,309
Call him immediately.

409
00:44:32,652 --> 00:44:33,949
Waiting for you only.

410
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:38,886
Tell me.
What's the matter?

411
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:40,048
I'll tell you sir.

412
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:46,961
This area's MC Thulasi has applied for
loan mortgaging his property documents.

413
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:50,895
After legal verification
and property valuation,

414
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,468
I sanctioned Rs.3 crores loan,
cheque is also ready,

415
00:44:54,674 --> 00:44:56,904
- I must give it to him today.
- What's the problem now?

416
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:01,839
Today morning I got a call saying
documents submitted by him are fake.

417
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:03,842
I'm confused.

418
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:08,253
I followed rules and sanctioned
the loan after formalities.

419
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:12,152
I don't have any right to reject
the loan citing any reason.

420
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:15,759
I personally called him to collect
the disbursement cheque.

421
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:17,459
I don't know what to do now.

422
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,488
Greetings sir.

423
00:45:18,698 --> 00:45:23,135
I've brought Pulla Reddy sweets
for sanctioning my loan.

424
00:45:23,336 --> 00:45:26,396
Take it sir.

425
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:29,941
Show me the land documents.

426
00:45:35,782 --> 00:45:37,613
Not these, show me the originals.

427
00:45:37,817 --> 00:45:40,547
Original or photocopy both
have the same matter.

428
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:43,382
I think he doesn't have matter.

429
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:47,389
Who is he?

430
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,431
Can I use your system?

431
00:46:09,749 --> 00:46:11,910
What man? So arrogant?

432
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:14,711
You need two hours to
read the document,

433
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:17,617
how can you decide
it's fake in two minutes?

434
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:20,292
- Who bought this property?
- My grandfather.

435
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:21,687
He then gifted it to me.

436
00:46:21,895 --> 00:46:23,459
In which year he bought the property?

437
00:46:23,462 --> 00:46:25,260
- December 1892.
- So what?

438
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:29,128
- Who signed the document?
- Who else? The seller.

439
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:30,563
What did he use to sign?

440
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,604
Can't you see it? He used a pen.

441
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:36,435
Which pen?

442
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,709
What's this torture early morning?

443
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:42,541
- Which pen did he use?
- Ball pen.

444
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:45,775
Ball pen was found in 1910.

445
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:48,783
Who gave him ball pen in 1892?

446
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,955
Your grandfather?

447
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:25,383
Is it Ram?
Who is this?

448
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,253
I'm Chidambaram.

449
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:30,360
My boss is in little trouble, sir.
You must come to the office immediately.

450
00:47:30,563 --> 00:47:33,589
I've a small job, I'll finish it
and come in 5 minutes.

451
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:05,885
Brother!

452
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:14,559
Bank money means people's money.

453
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:16,393
Okay brother.

454
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,564
Where did it happen?

455
00:49:18,938 --> 00:49:21,372
After a party.

456
00:49:25,578 --> 00:49:28,172
Please save my daughter.

457
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:30,746
You don't worry, I'll take care.

458
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:39,415
I don't know sir.

459
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:42,753
I work in day shifts only,
another comes in the night shift.

460
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:44,930
Please meet him to know details.

461
00:49:51,504 --> 00:49:53,267
Can you please tell his name?

462
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,365
- His phone number?
- No phone sir.

463
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,271
Where is he put up? His address?

464
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:02,437
I don't know that also, sir.
He'll be here after 6 pm.

465
00:50:06,919 --> 00:50:10,787
- Tell me Ram, any progress?
- Nothing till now.

466
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:12,949
I'll tell you something by evening.

467
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,894
Now only Swamiji can save me.

468
00:50:26,472 --> 00:50:28,736
Greetings Swamiji.
Please sit down.

469
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:39,211
I suspect my enemies have
used voodoo.

470
00:50:39,419 --> 00:50:42,183
There are only Gods,
there are no ghosts.

471
00:50:42,388 --> 00:50:45,983
Only prayers are answered,
not for voodoo or black magic.

472
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:52,388
This happens only when the
planets are not favourable,

473
00:50:52,598 --> 00:50:54,657
nobody can do anything to you.

474
00:50:56,436 --> 00:50:59,303
Offer consecration in Kalahasthi
temple and work sincerely.

475
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:00,597
As you say Swamiji.

476
00:51:06,746 --> 00:51:09,715
Greetings Swamiji.
Please sit down.

477
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:14,347
Save me.
You must save me Swamiji.

478
00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:16,283
What happened, Lingaraju?

479
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,423
My daughter Radha has been kidnapped.

480
00:51:18,624 --> 00:51:21,384
They have threatened to kill if I don't
pay Rs.100 crores as ransom.

481
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:24,886
I got it investigated but
didn't find any clue.

482
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:27,159
You must save my daughter, Swamiji.

483
00:51:27,366 --> 00:51:30,858
Don't worry, give me your
daughter's horoscope.

484
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:45,346
No use. Very difficult

485
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:47,178
What are you saying, Swamiji?

486
00:51:47,386 --> 00:51:51,220
- Saturn is ruling her now.
- Then Swami?

487
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:55,292
Though you put all you might and money,
I can't guaranty you'll find her.

488
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:59,989
There's no hope you'll get back her
alive even after paying Rs.100 crores.

489
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,534
To tell you clearly,

490
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:06,796
your daughter's life has more difficult
times ahead than good times.

491
00:52:07,173 --> 00:52:11,803
You can't say like this Swami,
I can't live without my daughter.

492
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:15,614
- Swamiji, please find a way out.
- There's a way.

493
00:52:15,815 --> 00:52:17,815
But I don't know if it's
possible for you or not.

494
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:19,609
Tell me how much ever
difficult it may be.

495
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,346
I'll make it possible.

496
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:23,715
In fact you may laugh at my idea.

497
00:52:23,923 --> 00:52:29,361
But if you follow my order, I'm sure
you'll get back your daughter.

498
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:32,497
20 years ago I came to this city
with just Rs.100 only,

499
00:52:32,698 --> 00:52:35,929
I met you,
I'm following you since then.

500
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:38,463
Today I've made billions.

501
00:52:38,671 --> 00:52:41,697
Would I dare laugh at you?
Impossible.

502
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:45,173
I'll do anything for my daughter.
I'll go to any extent.

503
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,608
- Please tell me, Swamiji.
- Okay, listen.

504
00:52:47,813 --> 00:52:50,646
Saturn is presently ruling
your daughter's life,

505
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:56,483
if you involve anyone worse horoscope
than hers in the investigation,

506
00:52:56,689 --> 00:52:58,179
there's a chance of finding her.

507
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:00,484
Find some person like that.

508
00:53:01,727 --> 00:53:03,351
Where can I find such a person, Swamiji?

509
00:53:03,462 --> 00:53:05,692
There's one here.
I-s there?

510
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:07,695
About whom are you talking?

511
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,936
- Pappu?
- Our Pappu sir.

512
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:14,268
What do you know actually?
Why are you talking bad about him?

513
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,538
The man when he steps,
earth will shatter,

514
00:53:17,743 --> 00:53:20,940
the man whose touch can make
diamonds turn into stones,

515
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:23,874
the man when he hits someone
gets his own mind blocked,

516
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,411
he's Pappu sir.

517
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:29,486
You're giving a great build up,
what do you know about him?

518
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:31,748
What am I to tell about him sir?

519
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:37,726
Every day, every hour, every minute,
he faces difficulties from himself.

520
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:42,333
I don't know about his horoscope
but I know about his ill fate.

521
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:46,437
He's the lone man to be born
on earth without any luck.

522
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:49,367
What?

523
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,307
What are you doing?

524
00:53:53,512 --> 00:53:55,279
I'm taking the broken
chair to repair, sir.

525
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,248
- Chair broken?
- Yes sir. Take it.

526
00:53:57,516 --> 00:53:58,540
Wait... one minute.

527
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:01,150
- Give me the chair.
- Why do you want a broken chair, sir?

528
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:02,583
Give it I say. I've work.

529
00:54:03,356 --> 00:54:06,757
- Get Pappu saying boss is calling him.
- Okay sir.

530
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:07,891
What are you doing now?

531
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:10,491
You didn't believe
what I told you, right sir?

532
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,764
I'll prove how unlucky Pappu is.

533
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,601
Boss is waiting for you.

534
00:54:23,776 --> 00:54:24,902
Why sir? Got any work?

535
00:54:25,278 --> 00:54:27,470
Nothing, he wants to talk
something important with you.

536
00:54:27,546 --> 00:54:28,406
With me? Tell me sir.

537
00:54:28,614 --> 00:54:30,174
Please take your seat, he'll explain.

538
00:54:30,182 --> 00:54:32,348
- How about you?
- You sit down.

539
00:54:36,622 --> 00:54:37,884
May I sit there?

540
00:54:59,945 --> 00:55:01,105
No problem sir.

541
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:03,305
- You didn't get hurt, did you?
- No problem sir.

542
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:08,681
Can you please give your
date of birth and time?

543
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:09,912
Okay sir.

544
00:55:10,556 --> 00:55:12,114
But you said boss wanted
to talk to me.

545
00:55:12,325 --> 00:55:14,759
He'll talk to you later.
You take rest now.

546
00:55:18,698 --> 00:55:20,723
Did you see sir? How unlucky he is!

547
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:25,393
Though there are so many chairs here,
he selected the broken one to fall.

548
00:55:25,604 --> 00:55:27,868
That is his ill fate, unlucky,
lackluster horoscope.

549
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,935
Will you believe me now sir?

550
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:35,413
I'm convinced but I'll meet Swamiji.

551
00:55:55,668 --> 00:55:57,966
What are you looking at Swamiji?

552
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:01,404
Generally there's bad period of
14 years split into two 7 years,

553
00:56:01,607 --> 00:56:06,101
who is this man? I've never seen
such a strange horoscope.

554
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:09,110
Can I engage him in
the investigation, Swamiji?

555
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:13,115
You can get it investigated by anyone,
just involve this man in it.

556
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:19,121
To tell you clearly, whatever this
man does ends up as failure,

557
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:21,919
your daughter is minus
because of Saturn.

558
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:24,420
Whatever this man does will be minus,

559
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,757
minus and minus will make it plus,

560
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,758
and your daughter will
come back home safely.

561
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:30,401
Okay Swami, I'll get it
done immediately.

562
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:32,234
But remember one thing clearly,

563
00:56:32,605 --> 00:56:35,267
Till your daughter comes back
if he gets scared

564
00:56:35,474 --> 00:56:37,237
or if he runs away like a coward,

565
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:39,741
your daughter will face
a grave danger, be careful.

566
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:41,435
Okay Swamiji.

567
00:56:49,588 --> 00:56:51,954
Why did you call me urgently?
Did you get any phone call?

568
00:56:52,324 --> 00:56:54,724
Boss wants to tell you
something very important.

569
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:57,794
Nothing sir, you carry on
with your investigation,

570
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,464
but I've a request.

571
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,223
What is it?

572
00:57:01,434 --> 00:57:03,402
There's an employee in
my office known as Pappu,

573
00:57:03,602 --> 00:57:06,400
please involve him in
your investigation.

574
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,766
I think you don't trust me.

575
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:11,204
If you don't, please tell me openly.
You're mistaking him.

576
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:12,544
A small obligation, that's all.

577
00:57:12,545 --> 00:57:15,243
I'm not going to any function
to take anyone as obligation.

578
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:18,212
I'm going on investigation.
Please don't say no.

579
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:24,185
Swamiji said if he's involved in this,
I'll surely find my daughter.

580
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:27,958
You're the chairman of such a big

581
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:29,590
company, do you also
believe such things?

582
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:35,233
I believe him that's why a poor man
like me has become Chairman.

583
00:57:37,703 --> 00:57:39,500
Please don't say no.

584
00:57:40,272 --> 00:57:41,364
Okay sir.

585
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:46,837
Pappu, come to boss' cabin immediately.

586
00:57:47,446 --> 00:57:48,435
One more thing sir,

587
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:51,445
if you tell Pappu the real reason,
he may feel hurt,

588
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,618
sir will tell him something different.

589
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:01,222
Please sit down.

590
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:04,852
What are you checking?

591
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,662
Chair will not break, you can sit.

592
00:58:10,503 --> 00:58:13,097
Look, I must tell you an
important matter.

593
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:14,397
Tell me sir.

594
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,737
Radha has been kidnapped.

595
00:58:17,142 --> 00:58:19,235
Oh God! When sir?

596
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:20,871
Last night.

597
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,545
Last night?
She was with us in the party.

598
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:26,115
It happened after the party.

599
00:58:28,787 --> 00:58:30,516
He's dealing the case.

600
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:33,851
He wanted an intelligent
assistant to help him.

601
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:38,424
We searched our staff and
zeroed in on you.

602
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:47,430
- Me sir?
- Please agree.

603
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,954
If you agree, I'll
pay you Rs.2 crores.

604
00:58:48,955 --> 00:58:50,268
Rs.2 crores?

605
00:58:50,476 --> 00:58:52,671
You don't worry sir.

606
00:58:52,878 --> 00:58:56,507
I'll use my talent to get your daughter
released from the kidnappers.

607
00:58:58,617 --> 00:58:59,777
Shall we go Ram?

608
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:15,327
These are not my words but boss'.

609
00:59:38,557 --> 00:59:41,924
Let's see how his horoscope will...

610
01:00:02,046 --> 01:00:04,913
Why are you giving me tension?

611
01:00:06,651 --> 01:00:09,176
Am I not here?
Why are you tensed?

612
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:17,191
Stop it... enough!

613
01:00:18,262 --> 01:00:22,255
You're going on driving straight,
where are you going?

614
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:23,925
Bolari Dhani.

615
01:00:27,104 --> 01:00:30,767
Do you think the kidnappers
will be still there only?

616
01:00:32,977 --> 01:00:34,774
To find any clue.

617
01:00:35,246 --> 01:00:38,147
Don't get angry,
I was just testing your talent.

618
01:00:38,516 --> 01:00:42,213
Good, though not as smart as I'm,
you do have some talent.

619
01:00:42,587 --> 01:00:44,811
I'll ensure you improve before
this investigation ends.

620
01:00:53,164 --> 01:00:55,564
It's burning!
Stop it... leave it.

621
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:58,060
I told you to stop.

622
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:00,565
Didn't get any burn, right?

623
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:16,515
Stop the car...

624
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:17,745
Why?

625
01:01:19,857 --> 01:01:21,884
Just now you loaded it,
downloading it so quickly.

626
01:01:21,892 --> 01:01:23,819
I'm like that only,
I can't hold on anything.

627
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:26,519
If I load, I must unload.

628
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:29,693
Stop I say! You're killing me.

629
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:41,000
Who is that?
Who is he? Stop!

630
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:44,045
Aren't you educated?
Don't urinate here.

631
01:01:44,248 --> 01:01:45,215
Who's urinating here?

632
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,642
No air, so came out,
now got air, I kept inside.

633
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:49,786
- Go away.
- What?

634
01:01:49,987 --> 01:01:51,113
Go away.

635
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:52,220
Says breathless.

636
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,457
Not even two feet tall but talks big.

637
01:01:55,726 --> 01:01:59,059
- Got fresh air.
- Yes, go on.

638
01:02:03,467 --> 01:02:07,699
Go to this mall.
Stop here.

639
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:11,241
Stop Ram.

640
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,468
What? Here?

641
01:02:14,812 --> 01:02:16,306
People come here to buy clothes only.

642
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:18,773
That's why I've been drafted
to work with you.

643
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:22,043
You think ordinarily and
I think extraordinarily.

644
01:02:22,253 --> 01:02:24,619
Not just textile showrooms,
there are toilets too here.

645
01:02:24,822 --> 01:02:27,086
I'll go to toilet, sit here.

646
01:02:29,493 --> 01:02:36,493
You know we give a gift to lucky
customer who buys for Rs.50000.

647
01:02:37,134 --> 01:02:39,898
Awaiting to know today's lucky winner.

648
01:03:25,249 --> 01:03:26,944
You?
You go.

649
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:28,914
Looks like you got the gift.

650
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:32,953
I bought clothes to entire family
for my son's birthday

651
01:03:33,157 --> 01:03:35,250
Luckily I got a gift too.

652
01:04:03,603 --> 01:04:06,868
Why are you so angry?
You want me to jump in happiness?

653
01:04:07,607 --> 01:04:09,135
Will you take an hour
to go to toilet?

654
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:12,605
I didn't spend time in toilet,
I met Seenu in the shop.

655
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,710
- Who is he?
- Radha's car driver.

656
01:04:17,116 --> 01:04:18,048
What is he doing there?

657
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:22,984
He bought Rs.50000 worth clothes
to family for his son's birthday,

658
01:04:23,356 --> 01:04:25,290
it seems the shop owner
gave him a gift too.

659
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:29,253
He was sharing the happiness with me,
how could I come midway?

660
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:32,393
Why are you feeling so much
for few minutes delay?

661
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:39,063
Why are you reversing the car?

662
01:04:45,812 --> 01:04:48,906
Don't you still believe me?
Where is he?

663
01:04:49,115 --> 01:04:51,345
If he's here, I'll prove it.

664
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:58,583
What's this sir?
Haven't you gone yet?

665
01:04:58,591 --> 01:05:00,985
Look, you didn't believe me, did you?

666
01:05:15,274 --> 01:05:17,640
What's this sir?
Who are these people?

667
01:05:17,844 --> 01:05:19,072
Why did you bring me here?

668
01:05:19,278 --> 01:05:21,712
- What have you done with the girl?
- Which girl?

669
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:28,314
Why? Are you threatening
because I'm quiet?

670
01:05:28,688 --> 01:05:31,213
I'll tell truth only
even if you beat me or not.

671
01:05:35,428 --> 01:05:41,025
What's this fate?
They beat me for trying to save madam.

672
01:05:41,434 --> 01:05:44,028
Now you're beating me
for telling the truth.

673
01:05:46,172 --> 01:05:48,105
Where did you get so much
money to buy clothes?

674
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:51,174
That's my money, I didn't earn
it by any illegal means.

675
01:05:51,377 --> 01:05:54,778
My hard earned money.
Who are you to ask me that?

676
01:05:55,848 --> 01:05:59,841
Though you thrash me,
this is the truth... truth...

677
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:09,584
- Will you give him a shock?
- Yes.

678
01:06:09,796 --> 01:06:13,027
He'll die in shock.
He has small kids.

679
01:06:13,232 --> 01:06:14,199
Are you mad?

680
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,163
Would he tell truth without
giving him shock?

681
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:19,031
No Ram, please give me
two minutes time.

682
01:06:19,238 --> 01:06:21,297
I'll talk to him.

683
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,377
Okay...2 minutes.

684
01:06:35,421 --> 01:06:37,582
- You know what's this?
- What's it?

685
01:06:38,658 --> 01:06:39,215
You mean?

686
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:42,826
If I use it, you'll get the
jolt of your life.

687
01:06:43,396 --> 01:06:48,129
You said you don't know about this,
I'll explain you about it.

688
01:06:48,334 --> 01:06:50,234
These are electrodes.

689
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:54,236
You must keep this to right
and left fingers.

690
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,738
- Please press that green button.
- Why?

691
01:06:56,943 --> 01:06:58,911
Press it, I'll tell you.

692
01:07:01,214 --> 01:07:03,842
I'm finished!

693
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:11,049
If you don't tell the truth,
you'll get the same treatment.

694
01:07:11,057 --> 01:07:12,024
Think over it.

695
01:07:12,225 --> 01:07:14,785
I'll tell the truth.

696
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:18,354
Speak!

697
01:07:19,165 --> 01:07:21,633
Brother! What happened?

698
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:28,834
I called her dad, threatened to kill her
in 3 days if he doesn't pay ransom.

699
01:07:29,408 --> 01:07:31,035
Old man got scared.

700
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,576
- He'll definitely give.
- That's okay, where are you now?

701
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,977
I'll intimate you the place
as soon as we reach Chennai.

702
01:07:37,183 --> 01:07:38,207
Okay brother.

703
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:42,254
- What about my share?
- Bloody! Let the job get over.

704
01:07:42,622 --> 01:07:43,953
I'll give your share.

705
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:47,985
- Don't leave him till my orders.
- Okay.

706
01:07:48,394 --> 01:07:50,225
Bloody idiot!

707
01:08:00,273 --> 01:08:03,834
Brother! Why did you tell
like that to Seenu?

708
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:04,771
What?

709
01:08:04,977 --> 01:08:07,104
We are going to Vizag,
why did you say Chennai?

710
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:11,716
Mad man, we needed him
only till kidnapping her.

711
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:13,283
Now we don't need him anymore.

712
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:17,714
If my chance he gets caught,
our plan will be a disaster.

713
01:08:17,924 --> 01:08:19,557
That's why I didn't tell him the truth.

714
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:23,593
You're no ordinary man,
you're a great man, brother.

715
01:08:25,097 --> 01:08:28,999
- What do you think of him?
- He's very smart and clever man.

716
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:38,010
Any progress?

717
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:41,010
Really?
Is driver Seenu also involved in it?

718
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:44,105
Then, are you leaving to
Chennai immediately, sir?

719
01:08:44,116 --> 01:08:46,717
Please save my daughter, sir.

720
01:08:49,155 --> 01:08:50,884
What happened sir?
Where are Ram and Pappu?

721
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:54,025
Kidnappers are going to Chennai with
Radha, driver Seenu has helped them.

722
01:08:54,227 --> 01:08:56,957
- Detective Ram is following them.
- Don't know what will happen?

723
01:08:57,163 --> 01:08:59,961
Don't worry sir,
everything will be fine, sir.

724
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:15,180
Give me chips packet.

725
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:23,186
Pappu has gone out, who are you?

726
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:28,860
- Suraj? Okay, I'll inform him.
- Okay.

727
01:09:33,099 --> 01:09:38,867
When the girl gives a half smile...

728
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:42,700
Boys have got bedridden
with love fever...

729
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:45,166
- Is it over?
- What?

730
01:09:45,378 --> 01:09:46,936
Some Suraj called you, talk to him.

731
01:09:47,146 --> 01:09:51,640
Suraj called me? Don't get tensed,
am I not with you?

732
01:10:00,693 --> 01:10:03,890
Pick up the phone Suraj.

733
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:08,055
One who picks is Suraj.

734
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:12,236
How are you?

735
01:10:12,705 --> 01:10:15,606
- It's me Pappu.
- What are you doing?

736
01:10:15,808 --> 01:10:18,299
Nothing... did you call me now?

737
01:10:18,678 --> 01:10:21,272
That's why I've called you back.

738
01:10:21,647 --> 01:10:25,674
No... no...
I was going out and you called me.

739
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:27,750
I was not in the car.

740
01:10:29,989 --> 01:10:32,355
How did the bride seeing ceremony go?

741
01:10:32,725 --> 01:10:35,387
How is the bride?
Is she okay?

742
01:10:35,761 --> 01:10:37,228
What's her age?

743
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:39,159
Young girl or old girl?

744
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:43,165
Old girl? What's this old girl?

745
01:10:43,803 --> 01:10:45,270
You're playing truant.

746
01:10:46,005 --> 01:10:46,937
Playing truant?

747
01:10:47,139 --> 01:10:48,663
A bet too?

748
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,941
What bet?

749
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:52,007
What?

750
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:55,009
Are you leaving India?

751
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:57,614
- But...
- Stop it!

752
01:10:58,851 --> 01:10:59,909
One minute Suraj.

753
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:00,915
What happened?

754
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,678
Can't anymore hear your lousy Hindi?

755
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:04,378
Is it mouth or sewage drain?

756
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:08,858
Okay Suraj, I'll call you back later.

757
01:11:09,962 --> 01:11:12,760
Back means...
will you sit back and talk?

758
01:11:12,965 --> 01:11:15,593
They say call you back
in English, right?

759
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:17,962
I had literally translated it.

760
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,638
From behind means call you back.

761
01:11:21,374 --> 01:11:22,636
Good.

762
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:24,398
What's the last word you said?

763
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:28,770
I used it to get a feeling of
good knowledge of Hindi.

764
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:31,274
I picked it up from the
Mahabharata TV serial years back,

765
01:11:31,283 --> 01:11:34,150
but... father...
your obedient son...

766
01:11:34,353 --> 01:11:36,947
Oh Mahabharata Hindi!

767
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:39,214
You said some word like this.

768
01:11:39,225 --> 01:11:40,692
I cut short a Telugu word.

769
01:11:40,893 --> 01:11:43,623
Generally some Telugu words
cut the last letter to become Hindi.

770
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:46,696
'Rathri' (night) Telugu
becomes Hindi 'Raat'

771
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:48,127
'Pagalu'(day) becomes 'Pagal'

772
01:11:48,334 --> 01:11:51,064
'Prema' (love) becomes 'Prem'.
Like that.

773
01:11:51,337 --> 01:11:54,101
- I can't take it anymore, stop it.
- No...

774
01:11:54,306 --> 01:11:56,900
if you don't stop it, I'll kill you.
Shut and go to sleep.

775
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:58,303
Don't disturb me.

776
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:51,425
In the magic of the magical deer...

777
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:55,367
I've fallen in love...

778
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:02,737
There's some intoxication in her love...

779
01:13:02,942 --> 01:13:09,942
I revolved around you like earth...

780
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:17,215
You've created a magic in my heart...

781
01:13:17,423 --> 01:13:24,423
Love... love... love...
if I come it's over...

782
01:13:25,097 --> 01:13:32,097
Love... love... love...
some beauty has taken over...

783
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:06,896
Don't stop me every time like this...

784
01:14:07,106 --> 01:14:10,906
Don't caress me like this every time...

785
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:18,110
Never seen or heard
about a beauty like you...

786
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:25,784
it struck my heart and hurt it...

787
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:29,917
I'm falling down going mad on you...

788
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:32,859
Don't push me into your lap...

789
01:14:33,065 --> 01:14:40,065
I can't take it...
look at my frail body...

790
01:15:29,922 --> 01:15:36,922
The moment I met you is
the most inauspicious time...

791
01:15:37,296 --> 01:15:44,296
Lullabies sung to put to sleep
must whistle and wink...

792
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:52,070
Hey, if this crosses the limit,
it'll not be fun anymore...

793
01:15:52,878 --> 01:15:59,878
You've come close to me
taking chances...

794
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:22,734
Why did you stop here?
I'm hungry, let's eat... come.

795
01:16:22,941 --> 01:16:24,636
I'm not hungry.

796
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:28,039
Okay, you sleep,
I'll have dinner and come.

797
01:16:35,688 --> 01:16:38,657
If you leave me alone,
what will I do sitting alone?

798
01:16:38,857 --> 01:16:41,883
I'll join with you,
I'll eat again when I'm hungry.

799
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:50,027
I had worked hard in dream,
I'll freshen up.

800
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:58,972
I've met so many people but
never anything stranger than him.

801
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:02,346
Don't know what's his horoscope,
they've put him on me.

802
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:12,888
What if I put him to test and decide
if he's lucky or unlucky man?

803
01:17:34,947 --> 01:17:38,883
- Get curry without salt.
- Salt less?

804
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,960
Fresh?
Ordered food?

805
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:56,099
You don't worry, be cool.
I'll decide how to save Radha.

806
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:07,176
Okay, enough.

807
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:15,210
Bloody, no salt.

808
01:18:15,587 --> 01:18:17,214
Forgot to add salt, bloody idiot.

809
01:18:17,589 --> 01:18:19,022
Salt is here, add it.

810
01:18:23,162 --> 01:18:25,995
There are 2 salt bottles on this table,
can you please give one?

811
01:18:50,622 --> 01:18:54,649
Follow my plan,
I'll take care of everything.

812
01:18:58,797 --> 01:18:59,957
Enough of the smirking.

813
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:11,335
Look again.

814
01:19:16,815 --> 01:19:17,839
Bill please.

815
01:19:44,843 --> 01:19:47,141
Enough of laughing, start the vehicle.

816
01:19:48,146 --> 01:19:49,975
Don't go overboard
because I'm keeping quiet.

817
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:51,310
Behave properly.

818
01:19:53,318 --> 01:19:56,116
Why are you getting angry?
I said just for fun.

819
01:19:56,321 --> 01:19:57,583
Start the vehicle.

820
01:19:59,324 --> 01:20:02,384
You drive, I'll catch up some rest.
Go.

821
01:20:03,228 --> 01:20:05,719
Watch out my driving, it'll rock you.

822
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:31,916
- Sir, food is getting cold.
- I said I don't want.

823
01:20:32,124 --> 01:20:33,682
Don't irritate me, go.

824
01:20:41,099 --> 01:20:42,259
Why are you so sad, brother?

825
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:44,799
You know Radha is in Chennai.

826
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:47,631
Ram is no ordinary guy,
he'll bring her back.

827
01:20:47,906 --> 01:20:49,703
At least have some milk, brother.

828
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:04,887
You said about some plan and
would take care of everything.

829
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:05,886
What's that?

830
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:08,855
I'll not tell you,
I'll show it practically.

831
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,233
Which side we must go now?

832
01:21:17,135 --> 01:21:19,660
You're clever, right?
Inquire and know it.

833
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:22,396
Can't I know if you don't tell me?

834
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:27,141
- Hello!
- What sir?

835
01:21:27,879 --> 01:21:29,073
- Sir...
- What sir?

836
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:30,714
Where does this road go?

837
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:32,506
It never goes, always stays here only.

838
01:21:32,784 --> 01:21:34,149
Like gum.

839
01:21:35,954 --> 01:21:37,979
Though a villager,
you've good comic sense.

840
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:41,682
When villagers speak truth,
city folks think it's comedy.

841
01:21:41,893 --> 01:21:42,917
Like savoury Karapoosa.

842
01:21:43,128 --> 01:21:46,620
Forget all that, which road
we've to take to Chennai?

843
01:21:46,832 --> 01:21:50,268
I don't know about road till Chennai,
but know well for some distance.

844
01:21:50,469 --> 01:21:51,299
Like sweet laddu.

845
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:54,696
Guide me till then,
I'll inquire from there.

846
01:21:54,906 --> 01:21:58,100
Go straight for 20 kms,
like sweet Poothareku.

847
01:21:58,101 --> 01:21:58,899
Then?

848
01:21:59,111 --> 01:22:01,579
A small circle is there
like savoury Chegodi.

849
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,374
There's a sweet shop,
don't buy anything,

850
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,218
not good stuff, all old things.

851
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:11,055
Why would I buy sweets?

852
01:22:11,256 --> 01:22:13,289
Just tell me how should
I proceed to the junction?

853
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:14,882
Right side you hit a dirt track,

854
01:22:15,093 --> 01:22:18,290
10 kms further, you'll hit Pitapuram.

855
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:20,063
- Pitapuram?
- Yes.

856
01:22:20,298 --> 01:22:23,062
There's a sweet shop
near the bus stand,

857
01:22:23,268 --> 01:22:26,795
you can buy sweets there,
very good stuff.

858
01:22:28,974 --> 01:22:30,573
Why are you talking about sweets only?

859
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:32,473
Tell me how should I proceed
from Pitapuram?

860
01:22:32,677 --> 01:22:34,905
I told you I know up to
some distance only.

861
01:22:35,113 --> 01:22:36,910
I know till that sweet shop only.

862
01:22:37,115 --> 01:22:40,175
Where are you from?
P-itapuram. What do you do?

863
01:22:40,385 --> 01:22:42,910
I told you about a sweet shop
near the bus stand, right?

864
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:43,985
That's mine.

865
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:47,090
You talk very sweetly,
like Kakinada Kaja.

866
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:49,419
Bloody! I asked you to guide
me to Chennai,

867
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:51,762
why are you guiding me to
sweet shop in Pitapuram?

868
01:22:51,863 --> 01:22:54,330
I'll fold you up like folded Kaja,
you mad man!

869
01:22:54,633 --> 01:22:56,032
Do you also own a sweet shop?

870
01:22:57,135 --> 01:23:01,299
Bloody!
Leave him, go now.

871
01:23:09,081 --> 01:23:14,815
All destinations are asleep...

872
01:23:20,859 --> 01:23:23,327
- Brother.
- What?

873
01:23:23,695 --> 01:23:27,062
- Vehicle broke down.
- Bloody!

874
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:49,248
Where's the girl?

875
01:23:49,855 --> 01:23:50,913
How would I know, brother?

876
01:23:51,123 --> 01:23:52,420
Bloody!

877
01:23:59,297 --> 01:24:00,628
Come on boys!

878
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:10,369
Stop!

879
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:26,218
How dare you try to escape?

880
01:24:27,259 --> 01:24:28,851
- Will you try to escape?
- No.

881
01:24:29,394 --> 01:24:30,053
Tell me.

882
01:24:30,262 --> 01:24:33,231
- Will you escape?
- No, I will not.

883
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:37,832
Can't you tell the route?

884
01:24:40,138 --> 01:24:41,901
How would I know he'll play with you?

885
01:24:42,107 --> 01:24:44,555
Nobody played with me,
it was just for fun.

886
01:24:44,556 --> 01:24:45,167
Why?

887
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:47,402
Because I'm too smart guy.

888
01:24:51,983 --> 01:24:56,181
You've been laughing at since
I poured salt into my plate.

889
01:24:56,388 --> 01:24:58,686
I'll ask you a question
answer if you're smart.

890
01:24:59,024 --> 01:24:59,854
What's it?

891
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:03,084
- Gandhi organized a protest, right?
- What protest?

892
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:04,853
Salt protest.

893
01:25:05,297 --> 01:25:07,561
What salt?
Powder or stones?

894
01:25:07,766 --> 01:25:10,667
Do you ask such questions
with brain or without it?

895
01:25:10,869 --> 01:25:14,805
That's it, you'll answer if you know
else say I'm brain less.

896
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:20,371
Just because lim taking it easy,
don't torture me with silly questions.

897
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:23,206
Stop eating my brain
and drive carefully.

898
01:25:23,748 --> 01:25:25,010
I'll sleep for sometime.

899
01:26:35,987 --> 01:26:38,217
Stop the car... stop the car.

900
01:26:42,727 --> 01:26:43,887
Go see.

901
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:06,349
What happened?
Why are we here?

902
01:27:06,718 --> 01:27:08,443
Don't you know what did
you do last night?

903
01:27:08,619 --> 01:27:11,177
- What did I do?
- Didn't do anything, so we're here.

904
01:27:11,389 --> 01:27:13,186
What had happened?

905
01:27:19,064 --> 01:27:20,929
I asked you to drive
for two hours only, right?

906
01:27:21,132 --> 01:27:22,690
You dozed off.

907
01:27:23,668 --> 01:27:24,862
So we are in hospital.

908
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:31,697
If I hadn't opened eyes in time,
we would be dead by now.

909
01:27:33,812 --> 01:27:35,973
Can't do one thing properly,

910
01:27:36,181 --> 01:27:39,048
you said about some plan and
execute it, is this your plan?

911
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,344
Why are you shouting for
a small mistake?

912
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:45,383
Small mistake?
Is it a small mistake?

913
01:27:45,757 --> 01:27:47,725
We could be dead.

914
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,124
I must curse your boss not you
for this extra baggage.

915
01:27:51,329 --> 01:27:53,263
Talk respectfully,
what's this extra baggage?

916
01:27:53,631 --> 01:27:56,156
You needed a clever assistant,
so he sent me with you.

917
01:27:56,368 --> 01:27:58,268
Stop it, I can't take it anymore.

918
01:27:58,636 --> 01:28:01,264
I can't tolerate your
boasting anymore. Enough!

919
01:28:03,108 --> 01:28:04,040
Shut up!

920
01:28:04,242 --> 01:28:08,178
Some Swamiji told your boss an unlucky
man with me will help finding Radha.

921
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,848
That's why he sent you with me.
That's all.

922
01:28:16,187 --> 01:28:19,054
No, I'm intelligent.
You're lying with me.

923
01:28:19,257 --> 01:28:20,724
Can't you understand it?

924
01:28:20,925 --> 01:28:22,356
How dare you hold me by my collar?

925
01:28:22,627 --> 01:28:23,594
Stop it!

926
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:27,324
Our will and wish,
who are you to stop us?

927
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:29,191
I saved you guys.

928
01:28:30,835 --> 01:28:32,200
By the way, who is this girl?

929
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:36,065
She's our Radha.

930
01:28:36,274 --> 01:28:38,139
How did this photo come to you?

931
01:28:38,343 --> 01:28:40,903
She got kidnapped and
we are searching for her.

932
01:28:41,112 --> 01:28:42,579
You hit the tree and we are here.

933
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,709
Why did you drive
if you can't drive carefully?

934
01:28:44,715 --> 01:28:45,944
I saw this girl.

935
01:28:46,651 --> 01:28:47,777
When?
Where?

936
01:28:47,986 --> 01:28:51,251
Last night we stopped at
Chandni Dhaba for dinner.

937
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:52,817
There...

938
01:29:00,265 --> 01:29:01,323
Biryani?

939
01:29:08,573 --> 01:29:09,665
Your fate.

940
01:29:11,009 --> 01:29:12,670
I want to go to ladies room.

941
01:29:13,378 --> 01:29:15,846
Playing drama again.

942
01:29:16,214 --> 01:29:21,846
Go with her.
If she tries to escape, kill her.

943
01:29:22,587 --> 01:29:23,178
Okay.

944
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:30,020
Excuse me, gents toilet is that side.

945
01:29:30,228 --> 01:29:31,593
Go that side.

946
01:29:31,796 --> 01:29:34,094
Just get going after thing is done.

947
01:29:57,755 --> 01:30:01,384
- She pointed towards the toilet.
- I didn't get it.

948
01:30:01,759 --> 01:30:04,057
- Which Dhaba?
- Chandni Dhaba.

949
01:30:04,262 --> 01:30:07,720
20 kms before the place
you met with accident.

950
01:30:28,153 --> 01:30:31,919
- Why? We are friends now, right?
- Don't feel sorry.

951
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:36,093
I shouldn't have talked
to you like that.

952
01:30:37,328 --> 01:30:42,630
Generally I don't hurt anyone,
I was little harsh on you.

953
01:30:43,801 --> 01:30:47,430
- Why are you feeling so bad?
- This is not new to me.

954
01:30:47,805 --> 01:30:50,797
I got teased by many
since my childhood,

955
01:30:51,009 --> 01:30:52,874
now got used to it, Ram.

956
01:30:53,378 --> 01:30:55,744
- Don't you get angry on them?
- I do get.

957
01:30:55,947 --> 01:30:58,745
But I'll go myself and befriend them.

958
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:01,316
Befriend them again? Why?

959
01:31:01,686 --> 01:31:05,713
Look Ram, there are over
a billion people in our country,

960
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:09,690
but I hardly have a 100 friends,

961
01:31:09,894 --> 01:31:13,887
is it necessary to fight, argue
and feel jealousy with them?

962
01:31:14,098 --> 01:31:17,795
My only wish is to be a good
friend to them all the life.

963
01:31:18,002 --> 01:31:23,838
Anything bad happens to me only
but others do get benefited.

964
01:31:25,143 --> 01:31:29,079
You're not my friend,
you're my best friend.

965
01:32:01,412 --> 01:32:03,172
Welcome sir.
What would you like to have sir?

966
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:04,008
Where's the toilet?

967
01:32:10,088 --> 01:32:13,888
Welcome sir, chicken, mutton, egg,
vegetarian, everything is ready.

968
01:32:14,092 --> 01:32:15,388
What would you like to have sir?

969
01:32:15,393 --> 01:32:16,924
Where's the ladies toilet?

970
01:32:32,977 --> 01:32:35,138
Your brain too is working.

971
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:48,420
What's this they are entering
the ladies toilet?

972
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:51,256
No problem.

973
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:24,225
What are you thinking?

974
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:29,726
Radha wrote on the wall
to inform her father. Call him.

975
01:33:30,868 --> 01:33:32,062
Shall I call him?

976
01:33:33,705 --> 01:33:36,230
- We must reach Vizag before them.
- How?

977
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,076
Vijayawada airport is near by.

978
01:33:47,285 --> 01:33:48,252
What?

979
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:13,873
It won't take much time
to meet Radha.

980
01:34:14,379 --> 01:34:15,971
We'll meet Radha in a short while,

981
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:17,947
and you can take
Rs.2 crores from your boss.

982
01:34:17,949 --> 01:34:19,248
I'm not coming here for money.

983
01:34:19,617 --> 01:34:21,881
- Why are you here then?
- I'll not tell you.

984
01:34:22,086 --> 01:34:23,713
Okay, come out.

985
01:34:23,988 --> 01:34:25,717
But you mustn't tell this to anyone.

986
01:34:25,923 --> 01:34:27,893
Don't you trust your friend?

987
01:34:27,894 --> 01:34:29,723
- I do.
- Then, tell me.

988
01:34:31,929 --> 01:34:34,591
- You've this art too.
- Since when you are both in love?

989
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:37,734
- We are not in love, I love her.
- One side love?

990
01:34:37,935 --> 01:34:39,465
Then express it to her
in this journey.

991
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:41,962
- I'll not tell her.
- Why?

992
01:34:42,774 --> 01:34:46,073
Everyone say I'm the
most unlucky person.

993
01:34:46,277 --> 01:34:49,246
Nothing I touch ever reaches me.

994
01:34:49,981 --> 01:34:53,417
If I miss Radha too, I can't bear it.

995
01:34:53,785 --> 01:34:56,618
It won't happen like that,
you don't worry. Okay?

996
01:35:06,164 --> 01:35:08,189
Tell me.

997
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,290
Have you reached Chennai?

998
01:35:10,868 --> 01:35:12,028
No, we are in Vizag.

999
01:35:12,236 --> 01:35:14,864
What? You said driver told you
they were going to Chennai.

1000
01:35:15,072 --> 01:35:16,937
We got the wrong information.

1001
01:35:17,842 --> 01:35:21,039
We came to know they are in Vizag,
proceeding towards check post.

1002
01:35:21,245 --> 01:35:22,974
Let's discuss later.

1003
01:35:50,041 --> 01:35:52,555
Hello brother, is your man
ready with money?

1004
01:35:52,556 --> 01:35:55,069
What?

1005
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:57,577
Does he know we are in Vizag?

1006
01:35:57,882 --> 01:35:59,850
Are they waiting for us at check post?

1007
01:36:00,051 --> 01:36:01,985
They know the car number too.

1008
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,849
Stop the car.

1009
01:36:08,392 --> 01:36:09,689
Check post.

1010
01:36:12,363 --> 01:36:14,194
We are stuck here.

1011
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:17,993
We can't go up and
if we go back, we'll get caught.

1012
01:36:27,078 --> 01:36:27,976
What?

1013
01:36:46,264 --> 01:36:48,994
You go away with her,

1014
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,395
if anyone follows you,
don't get caught,

1015
01:36:51,769 --> 01:36:56,172
if anyone catches, say your boss is
not well and taking him to hospital.

1016
01:36:56,374 --> 01:36:57,898
Okay brother.

1017
01:37:23,568 --> 01:37:25,301
- Wait here, I'll come back for you.
- Why?

1018
01:37:25,303 --> 01:37:26,561
We'll face problem if you come.

1019
01:37:26,737 --> 01:37:28,902
You found Radha because of me,
I'll also come with you.

1020
01:37:28,906 --> 01:37:32,042
- No need, stay here, I'll come back.
- No, I'll also come.

1021
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:34,737
Nothing will happen to me,
I'll also come.

1022
01:37:37,415 --> 01:37:39,212
Stop... I'll also come.

1023
01:37:44,956 --> 01:37:47,754
Why are you leaving me behind?

1024
01:37:47,959 --> 01:37:52,055
They must kidnap you and release
Radha, you'll remember me then.

1025
01:37:52,263 --> 01:37:54,823
He thinks he's a big hero.

1026
01:38:00,638 --> 01:38:03,038
Hey mad man! Big like a bull,
can't you hear the horn?

1027
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,174
Bloody, I've become cheap
to everyone,

1028
01:38:05,376 --> 01:38:07,844
come and run over me.

1029
01:38:12,116 --> 01:38:15,574
Radha! Why are you here?

1030
01:38:15,786 --> 01:38:20,780
- Do you know her?
- She's my boss' daughter Radha.

1031
01:38:21,392 --> 01:38:24,555
This girl was kidnapped
by people in silver jeep,

1032
01:38:24,762 --> 01:38:28,926
my man went after them to catch her.

1033
01:38:29,133 --> 01:38:30,794
He got the stick.

1034
01:38:37,942 --> 01:38:39,705
By the way, who are you guys?

1035
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:43,005
Get down... I'll see your end...

1036
01:39:14,111 --> 01:39:15,203
How are you?

1037
01:39:15,579 --> 01:39:18,207
I'm fine but what are you doing here?

1038
01:39:18,582 --> 01:39:21,676
- I came here to save you.
- You?

1039
01:39:21,952 --> 01:39:23,817
Who sent you here?

1040
01:39:24,021 --> 01:39:28,924
Your father sent me to save you
saying I'm very intelligent.

1041
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,031
Didn't my dad find anyone
else other than you?

1042
01:39:42,673 --> 01:39:46,040
Not only me, I've an assistant too.

1043
01:39:46,243 --> 01:39:49,144
Assistant?
Do you've a assistant too?

1044
01:39:49,346 --> 01:39:53,112
Yes, his name is Ram.
Good man but little crazy.

1045
01:39:53,317 --> 01:39:58,050
Despite my warnings, he used his
intelligence and followed wrong car.

1046
01:39:58,255 --> 01:40:00,223
He might be searching
for you elsewhere.

1047
01:40:00,424 --> 01:40:03,723
I'll inform him on phone
or else he'll be jealousy.

1048
01:40:08,365 --> 01:40:09,798
Can't get the line?

1049
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,901
Brother, he's talking on phone.

1050
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,239
So proud?

1051
01:40:18,242 --> 01:40:22,235
I wanted to kill you there but
police were just behind us,

1052
01:40:23,714 --> 01:40:24,908
get out.

1053
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,411
Be with her for two days silently,

1054
01:40:27,785 --> 01:40:31,744
if you try to act smart with me,
I'll send back your dead body.

1055
01:40:34,191 --> 01:40:38,093
We are sparing because brother said so,

1056
01:40:38,395 --> 01:40:41,762
else you would die, fatso!

1057
01:40:41,966 --> 01:40:43,661
Come on boys.

1058
01:40:47,905 --> 01:40:52,672
Radha, they beat me.

1059
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:23,239
Pappu, get up.

1060
01:41:25,042 --> 01:41:28,011
They are asleep, let's escape.

1061
01:41:28,212 --> 01:41:31,113
No, if they see me,
they'll beat me again. I'll not come.

1062
01:41:31,315 --> 01:41:33,909
Nothing will happen,
all night they were drinking,

1063
01:41:34,118 --> 01:41:35,779
they are down and out.

1064
01:41:35,986 --> 01:41:39,251
- I'll take care if anything happens.
- Really?

1065
01:41:40,724 --> 01:41:43,921
Come on get up.
Come.

1066
01:42:00,945 --> 01:42:02,151
- Brother...
- What happened?

1067
01:42:02,152 --> 01:42:03,072
They are running away.

1068
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,713
Catch them!

1069
01:42:41,385 --> 01:42:43,012
Hey look there!

1070
01:42:52,696 --> 01:42:53,754
Search there!

1071
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:01,029
Run... run...

1072
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:05,596
- What happened, Pappu?
- I can't run anymore.

1073
01:44:11,075 --> 01:44:12,201
Search there.

1074
01:44:13,911 --> 01:44:14,477
Look there.

1075
01:44:14,745 --> 01:44:19,808
- Find them, they'll be here only.
- Not here. Search there.

1076
01:44:25,289 --> 01:44:27,655
You can stop here,
how can you stop that?

1077
01:44:41,105 --> 01:44:43,903
We thought only one but
another one has come, brother.

1078
01:44:44,108 --> 01:44:45,837
What shall we do with him, brother?

1079
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:49,409
No need to do anything,
boss is coming here.

1080
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:52,078
He'll take care of everything.

1081
01:44:52,349 --> 01:44:58,151
You stay here, we'll go to receive boss.
Guard them.

1082
01:44:58,355 --> 01:45:01,347
If they try to escape again, kill them.

1083
01:45:01,725 --> 01:45:05,024
- Understood?
- Yes, you go, I'll take care. Okay.

1084
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:12,396
Why are you staring at me
only leaving them?

1085
01:45:12,669 --> 01:45:15,763
Nothing, you look very strange.

1086
01:45:15,973 --> 01:45:18,134
I'm not strange, I'm like everyone.

1087
01:45:18,342 --> 01:45:22,642
No, you've something too much in you.

1088
01:45:22,846 --> 01:45:26,612
- That's why I'm watching you.
- Yes, I do have too much.

1089
01:45:26,817 --> 01:45:29,786
- What's that?
- Intelligence.

1090
01:45:29,987 --> 01:45:31,648
- Do you know this?
- What's it?

1091
01:45:31,855 --> 01:45:33,517
There are about 1000 staff in my office,

1092
01:45:33,523 --> 01:45:35,078
I'm the most intelligent among them.

1093
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:35,683
- Is it?
- True.

1094
01:45:36,093 --> 01:45:38,027
That's why my boss sent me here.

1095
01:45:38,195 --> 01:45:41,096
Brother left me here trusting me.

1096
01:45:41,298 --> 01:45:44,756
One more thing, I'm more
intelligent than you.

1097
01:45:44,968 --> 01:45:47,095
- No, I've more.
- I have more.

1098
01:45:47,304 --> 01:45:49,738
- Me!
- Me!

1099
01:45:50,074 --> 01:45:50,938
I said I have.

1100
01:45:51,141 --> 01:45:52,403
Why are you getting so angry?

1101
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:55,870
No fight please, let's do one thing.
Tell me what's it?

1102
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,014
I'll ask you a question.
Go ahead.

1103
01:45:58,215 --> 01:46:00,615
If you answer correctly,
you're intelligent.

1104
01:46:00,818 --> 01:46:03,013
If you don't I'm more
intelligent than you.

1105
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:04,585
Come on shoot.

1106
01:46:04,788 --> 01:46:06,619
- One elephant...
- Elephant?

1107
01:46:06,824 --> 01:46:08,348
- Elephant!
- Elephant!

1108
01:46:08,725 --> 01:46:12,991
How will you put an elephant
in a fridge in three steps?

1109
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:18,892
I don't get you, you answer it.

1110
01:46:19,103 --> 01:46:21,731
Very simple, open the fridge door,

1111
01:46:21,939 --> 01:46:24,999
keep the elephant inside,
then close the door.

1112
01:46:26,844 --> 01:46:28,106
You lost!

1113
01:46:28,312 --> 01:46:30,780
Shut up you bloody!
Playing cheating game.

1114
01:46:30,981 --> 01:46:32,209
Ask another question.

1115
01:46:32,716 --> 01:46:33,705
Okay, I'll ask.

1116
01:46:33,917 --> 01:46:38,616
How will you keep a giraffe
in a fridge in 4 steps?

1117
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:43,718
I know... I know...
Then tell me.

1118
01:46:44,394 --> 01:46:45,986
Open the door.

1119
01:46:46,797 --> 01:46:48,025
Bend it's head.

1120
01:46:48,298 --> 01:46:49,731
Keep it inside.

1121
01:46:49,933 --> 01:46:51,628
Close the door. That's all.

1122
01:46:52,169 --> 01:46:55,605
- You lost again.
- Lost? What's the answer?

1123
01:46:55,806 --> 01:46:59,037
Open the fridge door,
remove the elephant from it,

1124
01:46:59,243 --> 01:47:02,872
keep the giraffe inside,
close the door, that's it.

1125
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:06,846
You're asking tricky questions,
I'll not accept.

1126
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:09,917
- Ask some logical question.
- Okay, this is last.

1127
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:13,283
If you ask about fridge,
I'll kick you.

1128
01:47:13,657 --> 01:47:16,956
King of forest Lion calls a
meeting with all animals.

1129
01:47:17,161 --> 01:47:19,755
All come but one animal never comes.

1130
01:47:19,963 --> 01:47:21,050
What's that?

1131
01:47:21,051 --> 01:47:22,227
- Monkey.
- No.

1132
01:47:22,599 --> 01:47:23,423
- Rat.
- No.

1133
01:47:23,424 --> 01:47:24,658
- Cat.
- No.

1134
01:47:24,868 --> 01:47:25,517
- Dog.
- No.

1135
01:47:25,518 --> 01:47:27,302
You tell the answer.

1136
01:47:27,671 --> 01:47:30,333
- Giraffe!
- Giraffe? Why?

1137
01:47:30,707 --> 01:47:34,040
We've kept it in the fridge, right?

1138
01:47:34,411 --> 01:47:35,708
That's why!

1139
01:47:39,917 --> 01:47:40,941
Fast... fast...

1140
01:47:48,825 --> 01:47:50,725
Radha, he's my assistant Ram.

1141
01:47:52,863 --> 01:47:56,663
You're really intelligent.

1142
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:30,260
Chiming anklets...

1143
01:48:33,804 --> 01:48:38,764
Hovering dark clouds go away...

1144
01:48:38,976 --> 01:48:44,209
Chill breeze is blowing...

1145
01:48:59,663 --> 01:49:01,858
Sky, earth, water, fire,
you and me as witness...

1146
01:49:02,065 --> 01:49:04,590
Mountains, valleys, trees,
plants are our companions...

1147
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:09,738
Let life go on with
friends like this...

1148
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:12,472
Difficulties, loss, laugh, happiness,
let's share it equally...

1149
01:49:12,643 --> 01:49:15,043
Let victories rule our hearts...

1150
01:49:15,245 --> 01:49:20,342
Let's walk together...

1151
01:49:51,948 --> 01:49:56,885
Will rainbows of smiles accompany us?

1152
01:49:57,087 --> 01:50:02,684
Our friendship is memorable...

1153
01:50:02,893 --> 01:50:07,796
In the misty dusk, with dew drops...

1154
01:50:07,998 --> 01:50:10,592
I don't have any wishes...

1155
01:50:10,801 --> 01:50:15,738
In the shadow of the first victory...

1156
01:50:15,939 --> 01:50:21,343
Though proceed into future...

1157
01:50:41,998 --> 01:50:47,061
There's nothing to say...

1158
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:52,765
We are flying in the chill clouds...

1159
01:50:54,945 --> 01:50:57,243
Though heart is filled with love...

1160
01:50:57,614 --> 01:50:59,878
I'm not able to express it to you...

1161
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:05,077
How can I unite with you?

1162
01:51:05,288 --> 01:51:07,756
Distance is separating us...

1163
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:10,222
Nature and truth is laughing at me...

1164
01:51:10,427 --> 01:51:16,229
Flying with happiness,
fun and frolic...

1165
01:52:05,949 --> 01:52:09,214
Pappu, run away!

1166
01:52:10,187 --> 01:52:11,211
Run away!

1167
01:52:15,292 --> 01:52:16,384
Run away!

1168
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:18,728
Don't worry about me, run away.

1169
01:52:19,629 --> 01:52:21,756
Uncle!
Kill them.

1170
01:52:22,699 --> 01:52:24,223
Run away! Run...

1171
01:52:51,127 --> 01:52:52,754
Come on...

1172
01:52:58,068 --> 01:53:00,195
Get on...

1173
01:53:06,176 --> 01:53:07,040
Kill him!

1174
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,963
Come on...

1175
01:53:57,761 --> 01:54:00,355
Ram... come... run...

1176
01:54:36,199 --> 01:54:40,158
What's this?
What happened to you?

1177
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:41,997
I'm scared, Ram.

1178
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:45,073
I never felt so sad.

1179
01:54:45,442 --> 01:54:48,036
Don't feel sad, what will happen.

1180
01:54:48,144 --> 01:54:51,238
- I'll die, that's all, right?
- Don't cry.

1181
01:54:51,982 --> 01:54:53,973
Nothing will happen to you.

1182
01:54:54,751 --> 01:55:00,189
Please you must live...
You must live for me.

1183
01:55:02,225 --> 01:55:03,988
To torture me all the life?

1184
01:55:04,861 --> 01:55:10,197
I'll not do... promise...
I'll never do again.

1185
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:13,095
I'll do as you say.

1186
01:55:15,138 --> 01:55:18,699
Why do you love me so much?

1187
01:55:19,943 --> 01:55:22,036
I don't know why.

1188
01:55:22,612 --> 01:55:28,016
I always lose whatever
gets into my hand.

1189
01:55:28,785 --> 01:55:34,621
Though so many had said
I'm unlucky fellow,

1190
01:55:34,824 --> 01:55:37,725
I never cared about it,
never felt sad about it,

1191
01:55:38,662 --> 01:55:42,723
but I thought God has at last
given me a good friend,

1192
01:55:42,999 --> 01:55:47,834
if I lose you also,
I can't bear it anymore.

1193
01:55:48,338 --> 01:55:51,739
Ram, I'll consider myself unlucky.

1194
01:55:51,941 --> 01:55:54,239
I'm lucky to get a friend like you.

1195
01:55:56,312 --> 01:55:57,677
What's this Ram?

1196
01:55:59,149 --> 01:56:00,980
Nothing will happen to you, Ram.

1197
01:56:01,851 --> 01:56:02,977
Don't feel sad.

1198
01:56:07,357 --> 01:56:10,690
Who ever marries you, she's so lucky.

1199
01:56:15,098 --> 01:56:17,999
Luck is not chance, we must win it.

1200
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:45,849
Kill them!

1201
01:57:46,422 --> 01:57:47,218
Where are they?

1202
01:57:47,423 --> 01:57:49,891
Where have they vanished?

1203
01:59:16,112 --> 01:59:21,778
Pappu, run... they are here.

1204
01:59:24,153 --> 01:59:25,745
They are here!

1205
01:59:25,955 --> 01:59:32,955
Please leave me and go.
Please go away, Pappu.

1206
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:36,698
Run away!

1207
01:59:42,305 --> 01:59:45,968
One and only best friend
I got in my life.

1208
01:59:47,243 --> 01:59:49,211
They took away Ram from me.

1209
01:59:49,412 --> 01:59:51,710
I'll save you even sacrificing my life.

1210
02:00:11,634 --> 02:00:14,398
No, please don't harm him.

1211
02:00:24,714 --> 02:00:26,409
Hail Lord Anjaneya!

1212
02:02:59,936 --> 02:03:03,872
Bloody rogue!
Come... come...

1213
02:03:09,178 --> 02:03:12,705
You saved me risking your life.

1214
02:03:15,184 --> 02:03:18,017
Thank you very much, Pappu.

1215
02:03:20,022 --> 02:03:22,388
Can I ask you something?

1216
02:03:23,326 --> 02:03:24,725
What's it?

1217
02:03:25,328 --> 02:03:30,732
Why did you take so much risk
to save me from the goons?

1218
02:03:30,933 --> 02:03:33,367
- For Rs.2 crores.
- Rs.2 crores?

1219
02:03:33,736 --> 02:03:35,795
Your father promised
to pay if I save you.

1220
02:03:36,005 --> 02:03:37,734
What will you do with the money?

1221
02:03:38,975 --> 02:03:43,878
I'll request your father to handover
the money to Ram's family.

1222
02:04:08,004 --> 02:04:09,301
You've done it, Pappu.

1223
02:04:09,672 --> 02:04:11,731
Boss will give you a very big gift.

1224
02:04:15,678 --> 02:04:19,239
Thank you very much
for accepting my invitation,

1225
02:04:19,615 --> 02:04:25,850
my brother Singaraju kidnapped my
daughter & tried to kill her for money,

1226
02:04:26,055 --> 02:04:29,218
but Ram who isn't connected
with my family,

1227
02:04:29,425 --> 02:04:32,986
he sacrificed his life
to save my daughter,

1228
02:04:33,196 --> 02:04:35,391
we are indebted to him all our lives,

1229
02:04:35,965 --> 02:04:38,661
praying Ram's soul rests in peace,

1230
02:04:39,135 --> 02:04:40,727
for my happiness,

1231
02:04:40,970 --> 02:04:43,234
I'm giving Rs.2 crores to his family.

1232
02:04:45,875 --> 02:04:51,745
Without refusing this, I request
Ram's father to collect the cheque.

1233
02:04:56,919 --> 02:05:01,982
On this occasion I'm giving
my daughter Radha a surprize gift.

1234
02:05:02,091 --> 02:05:09,091
I used to be in great confusion
in selecting my future husband,

1235
02:05:10,933 --> 02:05:17,133
the moment Pappu said he'll save
my life sacrificing his life,

1236
02:05:17,373 --> 02:05:20,968
I've decided to marry him
that moment itself, daddy.

1237
02:05:21,177 --> 02:05:23,042
If you also accept.

1238
02:05:28,918 --> 02:05:33,719
I've decided to give my daughter
in marriage to Pappu.

1239
02:05:48,904 --> 02:05:50,895
That's why I like you very much.

1240
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:16,163
Why did you bring me here first?

1241
02:06:16,365 --> 02:06:18,765
Dinner will be over before
we meet guests and come.

1242
02:06:18,968 --> 02:06:20,629
Not a sweet will remain.

1243
02:06:20,836 --> 02:06:23,202
Let's eat first and then meet guests.

1244
02:06:24,407 --> 02:06:25,874
I'll serve.

1245
02:06:29,111 --> 02:06:31,705
I love marriage feasts so much, Radha.

1246
02:06:38,688 --> 02:06:40,750
What happened, Pappu?
Why are you beating yourself?

1247
02:06:40,756 --> 02:06:45,753
You won't understand, Radha?
He'll serve everyone except me.

1248
02:06:45,961 --> 02:06:47,189
Why?

1249
02:06:47,396 --> 02:06:48,727
It's like that only.

1250
02:06:56,706 --> 02:06:58,765
- Uncle!
- Coming.

1251
02:07:01,811 --> 02:07:04,177
Why are you looking so
handsome today, uncle?

1252
02:07:05,281 --> 02:07:07,181
Do you know who good your shirt is?

1253
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:11,682
Okay.

1254
02:07:11,887 --> 02:07:13,286
- Another one please.
- Okay.

1255
02:07:13,656 --> 02:07:14,714
- One more.
- Okay.

1256
02:07:14,924 --> 02:07:16,721
If you eat, I'll serve you everything.

1257
02:07:16,926 --> 02:07:19,101
- Uncle.
- One for me.

1258
02:07:19,102 --> 02:07:20,589
Okay uncle.

1259
02:07:33,743 --> 02:07:35,938
- Isn't it tasty?
- Very tasty!

1260
02:07:36,312 --> 02:07:38,576
Enough or you want more?

1261
02:07:38,781 --> 02:07:43,115
Pappu came to know through Radha
we must win the luck by intellect.

1262
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:45,048
Indeed he has become really intelligent.
