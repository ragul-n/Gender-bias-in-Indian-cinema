Interrogation takes place in the next room, sir

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,480
I told you not to beat the ladies, Outside conditions were not good

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Is ladies beating the ladies?

She is not married yet, then how would she have children.

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
How do you know that she's not married yet?

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,000
What, if we are the police and do not know about that bhargavi.?
We can see with our own eyes whether she was married or not.

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,440
You deal with this case Yedukondalu.
- Ok sir

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
What’s the case ? Is it murder?

31
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,200
Did he really committed the murder?
Because he is looking like a soft person .

32
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,080
You have to say that thing yourself sir.

33
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,880

Oh! You’re here, am I right bhargavi?

37
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,400
How would I know about your life sir?

38
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,840

Tiffin.!

45
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,800
You can tell me your story without sitting like that for time pass.

46
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,240
Now !

47
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,520
Every person who committed a crime would have his own version.

48
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
if you didn’t commit any crime
Tell me your own version

49
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,600
Why because, you shouldn’t lie Infront of Doctor and police.

50
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,600
If you tell lies to a Doctor, it will leads to a big disease

51
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,720
And to police, it will increase your punishment.

52
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,560
if you’re really Genuine. We will settle this

53
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,200
Anyway, a criminal doesn’t have any type of version

54
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,440
And you can’t any tell story if I ask you suddenly.

55
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,680
We are all living In a modern world

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,200
It is enough to portrait a lie to truth and truth
to lie in a single night.

57
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,200
If a clever man commit any mistake in a night he can roam freely

58
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
Where as a fool will be sit here Infront of you.

What happened so suddenly?

370
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,040

371
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,080

I’m telling you to wait

372
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,720

00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,560
Don’t talk to me.
- Are you mad or what? You’re behaving strange at sometimes.

374
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,880
I want to make you happy as much as
I can but you’re spoiling it every time.

375
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,400
Jaanu, why are you leaving, when I’m talking to you?
- My name is not jaanu, call me avanthika.

376
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,640
Avanthika, nice name, nice meeting you. Nice name.

377
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,440
I did a mistake , I really did a mistake

378
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,440
, I married you because you’ll take care of me like my mom
but you’re creating problem in every situation.

379
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,200
I thought you loved and married me.
- Didn’t I love you, I’m mad about you.

380
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:46,440
Love means , not kissing and roaming when we’re together.

381
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,280
In my aspect love means showing up on those
who are angry and irritated also.

382
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,840
I’ll share everything with you, whether
It is love or hate because I love you.

383
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,040
I have a lots of love on you

384
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,480
And doubt also. Didn’t you say that you love

385
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,720
But then bear these conflicts suspicions.

386
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,200
Hey! Look at this figure , she looks very costly

387
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,040

What leave? It has started just now, you shut up and get lost.

393
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,160
There are some seperate houses for this,

00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,000

Some one is beating our guys..

399
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,160

400
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,120
You saved her now but I’ll kill her when you’re not around here.

401
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,040
Hey! Let’s go , let’s go..go..

402
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Do you even get angry?

403
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,480
I have planned you so many surprises today
but everything went flopped.

404
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,280
You can show them in other way also..

405
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,400
How?..
- You can show it by cooking..

406
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Cooking?.. I know how to eat but not cook

407
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,080
I’ll order the food if you want. It will come to our house.

408
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,600
I really don’t like the hotel food,
If you have love me then you prepare the food...

409
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,160
Why is she asking me to prepare food...

410
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,440
lets do it.

411
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,440
It’s awesome jaanu...

412
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:52,360
I thought I was the only one in his life but there
were so many pages he hide it from me.

413
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,280
Suddenly the ground under my feet seemed to shatter.

414
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,120
Why are you watching me secretly , do you have any doubts?
- That is your character madam not mine.

415
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,760
Ok but the food is ready and if you come then we can eat together.
- I’ll come , you go..

416
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,320

00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,080
Look madam, i am enjoying my food, by mistake my leg may have hit you.

418
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,560

Hmm, you are clever..

420
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,760
Hey jaanu, I’m hungry.
She is again upset on me..

421
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,280
Bend your legs and lie back down that side.

422
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,760
No matter how hard you try, there is no use.

423
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,360
Jaanu...

424
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,920
Lie back on the other side.
- Do you think only men always had those feelings, what about women?

425
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,080
Remove your hand.

I’m getting bored after you went to the office,
that’s why please Karthik, I want to learn dance.

430
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,200
That God did not give us the controlling power he gave you.

431
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,240
Let me find and tell you if there is any good institute in our city...
- I’ll learn only in Natyalaya’s.

432
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,800
Ok..

433
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,800
Hello sir, what are you doing here? After long time.

434
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,560
Hey! Rohit, how are you?
- I’m fine

435
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,200
This is jaanu, my wife.
- Oh! Are you married sir?

436
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,200
Sorry jaanu, I could not come to your
wedding actually he did not call me.

437
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,760
It happened suddenly with out planning

438
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,840
Anyway, how did you marry him?
He was Cupid before the marriage but I don’t how is he now?

439
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,880
A Cupid always be a Cupid.

440
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,720
Ok, Where is madam?
- She is in prayer inside.

441
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,360
What happened to your hand?
- Nothing, you guys go and sit inside.

442
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
What is he doing here?

443
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,920
Madam

444
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,400
They came to join our institute.
- Hello madam, are you fine?

445
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Hello Karthik.
- My wife avanthika.

446
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,080
No, jaanu,

447
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,120
My husband likes to call me Janu.

448
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,120
Oh !

449
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,120
She wants to learn Dance here,
that’s why I brought her.

450
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,560
I wonder why she wants to learn dance here,
there are still many institutes right?

451
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,560
Because you will teach her nice and
she doesn’t even know the basics.

452
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,920
She will learn everything if she has interest.

453
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,880
And you will feel very free here,

454
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,240
From which day you'll come ?
Today is a good day and I’ll join now.

463
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,080
Karthik is behaving very strange ,

464
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,440
He was not like before the marriage.

465
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,880
Oh! He locked the phone.

466
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,440

So, he didn’t even had a time to care for me

00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,360

00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,240
If I call, you will hang up or you’ll give your
phone to someone to tell that you went outside.

496
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,280
It’s three crores man

497
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,240
That’s my life dream to buy that villa and I also
told jaanu that I will give that villa to her as a gift.

498
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,720
Please try to understand.
- I have put that money on betting.

499
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,160
What do you mean by putting my money in betting

00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,320
Whose money you will place on bets.

501
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,680
Karthik.

502
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,560
That is my lifetime savings man

503
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,560
That Money should be in my account by this evening

504
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
If I came to Bangalore, you would be dead.

505
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:08,800
Karthik..

506
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,040

Hey!

516
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,680
Listen to me...
- Karthik, shall we go?

517
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,880
Jaanu, I have some urgent work now so, you go I will join you.
- It’s ok, I’ll wait here.

518
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,920
Jaanu, please you go , I’ll join you..

519
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,680
What happened Karthik? Why are you sweating?
- Nothing

520
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,920
Why are you so tensed?

521
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,480
I know, this is all because of avilash, he is always like that.

522
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,320
Hey! Don’t you understood, just leave, I’ll come.

523
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,480
Ok I’ll go.

524
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,400
He did not want to come to the hospital with me even though
I said I was pregnant. He gave his time to some other girl.

525
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,520
He always take care of money, Villa and girls that’s it.

526
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,360
I don’t understand my life.

527
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,480
Jaanu

528
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,760

529
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,800

00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,600
Why are you crying?

[No Audio]

532
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,680
It would be nice if I had asked Karthik before about that girl.

533
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,840
I thought he was my life

534
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,760
But now I’m afraid that my life will be lost in his hands.

535
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,120
Anyway I’ll settle it today.

536
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,480
Jaanu, please pack my luggage, I’ll go to Bangalore.
- Why?

537
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,920
Avinash should give us three crores but
he is looking to cheat us by giving 50 lakhs.

538
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,280
So, I urgently need to go to Bangalore and settle with him, ok.

539
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,040
Karthik.

540
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,800
Why are you like that, Jaanu?
- Did you forget to say anything to me Karthik?

541
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,200
Why are you talking like that?
- Do I have to know anything?

542
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,840
Noo
- What are you hiding from me Karthik?

543
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,680
Nothing jaanu.
- Tell me , didn’t you not hiding anything from me?

544
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Then what is this?

545
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,800
Jaanu
- Karthik , please..

546
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,360
Jaanu please..

547
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,040
Jaanu , please try to understand me..

548
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,840
Not everything you see is true jaanu

549
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,520
I have the answer to every question you have.

550
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:05,640
I’ll explain everything to you clearly, you’re not in a situation to understand my explanation.
- How can I trust you Karthik?

551
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:14,640
Janu I’m saying it now and I always say that when
you come into my life I cannot give that space to anyone except you.

552
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,840
How can I trust you Karthik? And how can I give birth to someone?

553
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,920
What are you talking?..

554
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,080
Hey..

555
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,120

556
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,280
Karthik.

557
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,680
I’ll also come to Bangalore with you.
- Look jaanu, it is a big risk.

558
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,360
I am going to Bangalore to solve a problem and if you come
too then it will become complicated. Try to understand me .

559
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,840
If you don’t take me to Bangalore with you ,
I will have an abortion.

560
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,520
Growing up as an orphan from a young age

561
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,480
I could not bear to hear that.
I didn’t know what to do

562
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000

I asked your version right?

567
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,320
No sir, I told you everything.

00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,000
Did you tell me this three crore insurance

570
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,800
Matter about Joe?

571
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,040
Did you think that he came directly and he wouldn’t do anything?

572
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,000
Hey !

573
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,920

I will do the interrogation after completing the 90% investigation.

He doesn’t give so easily and there is no proofs in records

01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,040
If you tell only truths I’ll leave you

617

670
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,040
I spoke with Joe , she doesn’t know anything about this video

671
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,080
And also she said there are conflicts in their family about this matter

672
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,160
Then why did she do this thing? We should blame karthik

673
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,360
Mistake is joe's not Karthik’s

674
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:41,640
She came so close to him but then he sent back by telling her about
family relationship and his love towards janu

675
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:50,440
Hello !

676
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,160
No

677
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,840

01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,440
Who made the last call to Avinash in Bangalore?

687

Before three hours avinash to die
- Right Call the caller immediately - Okay sir

689
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:22,080
How many times have you been told not to call whenever you can?

690
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:27,240
Do you think I am your servant To talk rubbish
Just because you are raising kids you are talking rubbish

691
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,240
Did you give birth to them without me or raise them without me

692
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,280
Cut the call you nonsense stupid rascal

693
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,240
Did the man born who control women

694
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,240
Dorababu where are you on the 30th?
- I know sir who gave complaint to you, is it my wife?

695
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,480
How many times have I told it that there
was a lot of work in the office that day.

696
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,600
Even then she gave complaint to you. Please sir at least you explain to her

My wife do not even know that? I went to Bangalore.
How did you know sir

698
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,360
There was a girl I met ,I would occasionally go and
come without my wife knowledge

699
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,400
Why did you call this number in Bangalore?

700
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,360
This number? In Bangalore, the figure is Sonali 4500 only

701
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,280
I would go there occasionally
- I didn’t ask about your booking number

01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,320
The number which is marked below
- Oh. Is this number !

703
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,040
A girl came up to me and told me that
her phone was switched off and asked my phone

704
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,560
Giving girls anything they want is my weakness
So I gave my phone then she called someone and gave it to me again

705
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,240
How did she look like?
- Her face is covered with Duppatta.

706
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,600
But her personality is slim and beautiful can afford 10000

707
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,320
You are Maintaining MRP rates very well !
- Don’t tell this matter with my wife

714
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,880
He is having many relationships.
Someone got close on purpose at that time

715
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,840
They wanted Karthik to be caught and
run away with Entire cash

A lady’s voice is heard every time from this number
Can we track the number from the number that we have received a video

731
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:48,440
The number from which we received a video and the number from
which we are getting calls were the same and IMEI number is the same .

732
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,200

733
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,200
Janu’s phone?

734
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,320
Did Janu do it? If Janu did it she might be alive for now sir

735
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,240
If she is alive, where has she been?

736
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,360

737
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,880

01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,880
How do you know Karthik ?

760
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,680
What is the relationship between you and Karthik?

761
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,160
Why Karthik wanted to meet you?

762
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,800

764
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:07,280
2 years back I gave a performance for a dance school promotion

765
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,600
Karthik came to shoot the programme coverage

766
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,680
I have seen him there for the first time

767
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,320
Chaithra

768
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,480

01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:54,640

773
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,880
Madam is coming

774
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,920
Hi Rohit
- Hey Hi

775
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,120
You said you want to tell something
- Nothing !

776
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,680
I saw the advertisement given in the newspaper

777
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,840
I see
- What so sudden for this dance school? You dint even tell a word for me

778
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,640
I’m going with the flow
- Then what about your job?

779
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:33,480
That job, I’m working so hard for the promotion
but they are employing by seeing their caste

780
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:41,120
And now they are transferring me for giving job to someone
of their caste, that’s the reason I resgined the job

781
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,160
I can’t bare this job and these feelings

782
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,080
Ok good decision

783
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,520
What about publicity I mean who shoots the photos and all

784
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,240
I don’t need all of it . I don’t have that much money

785
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,800
I have a friend named Karthik, I’ll introduce him to you

786
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,760
How much will he take
- Just a lakh

787
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:04,720
One Lakh ?

788
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,000
You know my range right,

789
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,000
That’s not my range
- Did I ask you?

790
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,520
You give how much you can and the remaining I will give

791
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:18,240
It may be uncomfortable for you
- We are friends right , give me after you were settled ok?

792
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,640
Hey !
- Yes

793
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,200
You told about a fantastic location but there is
nothing but unwanted plants

794
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,480
Look at that place nobody can know

795
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,200
Anything even if we do anything

796
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:48,080
I asked place for the photo shoot not for
the silly drama you play

797
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,760
Ok bring a pack of cigar
- I’ll not bring sir

798
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,440
Go and bring a cigarette packet
- I’ll not bring it sir

799
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,320
Ok I’ll go and bring them

800
01:19:58,083 --> 01:20:00,280
Nothing like that !
Are you watching movies

801
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,680
In every movie they are showing someone like me and were advertising
smoking is injurious to health so how can you tell me to bring it?

802
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,920
Ok you just go and click pictures in that area
- Ok sir

803
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,040
Hey !
- Yeah

804
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,040
Remove the cap

805
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,840
Now a days they are clicking even like this,
I did'nt even know about it

806
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,880
What’s the matter sir, do you want to tell anything?

807
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:36,120
My friend Chaitra started a dance school and
you should shoot pictures for advertising

808
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:44,040
Nice it’s a business deal! So how much is it for 5 lakhs or 10 lakhs?
- Hey dude for 10,000 please

809
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,920
What 10,000 ?
Take Sathi, he will shoot with his phone

810
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,280
Hey please dude I promise that girl so you should do it

811
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,720
Whom did you ask and promised her?
- Hey just listen what I’m saying, she looks so beautiful

812
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,040
She is my friend from so long she will be useful for our
magazine cover page so I did this and I leave this to you

813
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:07,080
Are you trying to convince me !
- If you reject ill take this to Babhji

814
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,880
They give us more money and I leave this to you
- Ok then I’ll make it. How much?

815
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:12,840

Just now you told 10,000 right?
- That’s for you man

817
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:23,600
If that girl don’t look good I’ll walk out from the shoot

818
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,240
No chance, I’ll send you all the details of her

01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,840

01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:15,360
Its our wedding today you know it

861
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,680
I don’t know how to explain you that

862
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,640
I’m not comfortable with marriage

863
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:26,280
What comfort?
- Chaithra I don’t like marriage and we are happy now so what’s the need for marriage?

864
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,520
Am I speaking to Karthik ?

865
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,480
Are you ok ?

866
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,840

867
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,120
Jaanu you came here?

868
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:55,760
Are you understanding about what you are doing?
Our wedding within one hour and you seem like you don’t bother anything

869
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,160
If my parents listen to your words
they don’t spare you !

870
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,360
why did you say like that ?
- I don’t have interest on marriage.

871
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,640
You should think about that before loving me.

872
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,320
Love?

873
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,680
Love? Jaanu !

874
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:22,480
We are in sweet relationship. We are meeting daily and going
to tour monthly once, we are happy right?

875
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,000
Then why marriage?

876
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,880
Frankly I don’t have interest in marriage

877
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:36,480
We had fun all these days
- Fun? What do you mean by fun Karthik. Don’t you understand

878
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,880
I love you and that is the reason I am with you.

879
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,680
Karthik I truly love you

880
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,840
Karthik, Karthik you?

881
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,400
Let’s talk straight

882
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:12,480
Why did you love me, you know Rohit since long.
Why didn’t you love him.

883
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:18,080
Rohit is my friend. We don’t have those type of feelings.

884
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:25,880
Hey stop talking nonsense. Do you want me to tell why
because I have money, reputation. He doesn’t have any.

885
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:34,720
Karthik Why are you saying something something,
past is past . Time for the Muhurtham. Let’s go

886
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:38,800
Nothing happened !
I will not marry you.

887
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,120
Why don’t you marry me ,tell me one reason Karthik.

888
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:48,760
Hey what? What? Why did you had sex with me before marriage.
What should I think about character.

889
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,200
How can I believe that no one touched you before me

890
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,840
Shut up don’t talk rubbish

891
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:03,320
I don’t know how much I love myself but
I love you more than anything.

892
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:08,840
I don’t have money, property anything
I'm the only one I have !

893
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,640
That is the reason I gave myself as a gift to you.

894
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,240
Okay, okay

895
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,840
Did any girl do sex before marriage?

896
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:21,320
It’s not sex it’s just the way that we express love.

897
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:27,360
Yeah.. To how many people you expressed this kind of love.

898
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,640
Mind your words Karthik.

899
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:34,240
Okay madam. We will not going to marry.

900
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,160
Karthik

901
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,480
Please think once. Our family

902
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:48,600
Our kid please think
- Hey that’s what, to whom the kid will be born.

903
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,840
Stop Karthik ! It's my mistake

904
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,880
I don’t expect anything more from you

905
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:05,320
I think a kid will be born with love.
But you think because of sex

906
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,840
Yes
- That’s your character.

907
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,800
You will never understand my love.

908
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,000
Hey who loved you? Get lost

909
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,600
Hey it’s okay if you don’t understand my love
but you insulted my love.

910
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,840
I will never see your face again.
Good bye Mr. Karthik.

911
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,240
Hey get lost

912
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,040
Now I will go but someone will come into your life

913
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,160
When they came to know about you,
see what happens to your life.

914
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:47,840
That’s it sir, that is the last I saw him

915
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,920
And again he came with Jaanu for dance.
I was very happy for that

916
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:00,200
I thought he changed and that is the reason
he introduced his wife but no sir

917
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,720
He came by her force

918
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,440
She came with a doubt !

919
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:14,280
She has doubt on both of us
Karthik don’t have responsibility.

920
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,120
Even he knows that she is pregnant but he didn’t bother .

921
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,440
I went to his office one day to tell that is not right.

922
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,280
Hey how can you talk like this

923
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,760
Avinash I will wait till 6 in the evening.

924
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:30,680
Hi !

925
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,080
Hey

926
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:33,800
Okay

927
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:41,040
Okay I will wait in the office bring my money at any cost.

928
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,200
Why is Jaanu coming?

929
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,800
Don't tell your stories at any cost !

930
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,640
I didn’t expect that would happen Because of that thing

931
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:05,840
Then who do think killed?
- I don’t know sir I don’t understand anything.

932
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:11,200
Okay take rest. We will meet again.
- Okay sir.

933
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:20,720
Why are you crying?
- It’s pity sir. All difficulties are for only girls.

934
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,720
They will only bring difficulties and they
will only suffer and in between men are crushing.

935
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:30,880
That means you think Karthik is good. ?
- I don’t say he is good Bhargavi , he doesn’t preference to money

936
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,560
He will do anything for girls.

937
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,240
Means?

938
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:42,160
Hey yedukondalu I want one tea !
she wants know everything clearly.

939
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:47,560
Chaitra !

940
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,416
How are you chaitra? How did it happen?

941
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,240
How? It’s because of you, if you marry me that time.
Will this happen?

942
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,120
I didn’t do it by myself.

943
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:08,120
Schedule all my appointments for tomorrow.
- Hey when is the marriage?

944
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,360
Hey marriage is in 3 hours.
- I don’t have invitation?

945
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,480
Everything is so sudden, this is all planned by chaitra. You know?
- Did you both love each other so much?

946
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,250
What? Why are you asking like that ?

947
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:25,958
Then? I introduced the girl I love and I thought
she would be settled but you made her settle with you.

948
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,440
Did you love her?
- Without loving her, why will I introduce her to you

949
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,400
why do I want her to be famous?
- You loved her but she didn’t?

950
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:45,440
True. Chaitra didn’t love me, I loved her, I will go mad without her

951
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:52,360
I am loving her from long back But she Disappeared
and I thought I will never see her

952
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,920
But when I saw her in paper Ads I felt very happy.

953
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:04,458
She seemed to need support and I gave support her.
I also sold my house because she was in financial trouble.

954
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:08,080
I’ll leave anything for her. I like her that much

955
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:15,520
It is true but we loved each other,
what kind of a friend ship is this?

956
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,708
You don’t talk about friendship.
You set up a girl who fell in love with your friend

957
01:36:19,895 --> 01:36:22,833
I saw her as my life and I could not live without that life.

958
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:28,000
Who are you threatening, get lost!
- Yes I’ll leave

959
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:35,920
I’ll get lost till now I left everything for Chaitra
and all there is left is my life !

960
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:43,200
Hey Rohit are you mad !
- Don’t touch ! My Chaitra is waiting for you just go

961
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:52,640
I never seen him like this, he is even ready to die .

962
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,560
I think he deserves you more than me

963
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:02,200
Every lover wants his loved ones to be happy right?

964
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,240
When did he love me?

965
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,640
He became close as if he was consoling
and then he married me

966
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:23,280
I went into the room with lot of hopes and he brought
someone else into the room and he kept me for sale

967
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,040
He wanted me to sleep with someone else

968
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,680
He don’t want me he just want my body,
he tried to own money with my body

969
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,000
Is it?

970
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,640
Then why did he tried to die and cut his arm
- If he really wants to die will he cut his arm or his neck?

971
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,760
Then what about his love?

972
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,720
His love is fake Karthik !

973
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,440
You trusted his fake act but you didn’t understand my true love

974
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,360
He destroyed both of our lives

975
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,240
What can we do now?

976
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,520
We cannot do anything ,we cannot get out of this case

977
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:11,200
I can’t run the dance school and you cannot run
your studio and our life itself is spoiled

978
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:13,880
Or else

979
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:19,800
Can we run far away from here? Can we start a new life?

980
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,720
What are you talking?

981
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,040
Yes it’s hard to do

982
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,640
I need some time

They were caught for us right?
Why are you feeling so tensed

996
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,760
We have the evidence but what about Jaanu?

997
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,200
Where ??

998
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:24,240
Sir ,Janu might be staying somewhere ,she may not have
phone that might be the reason she is not calling anybody - Not like that

999
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:32,720
May be she may not have outgoing calls because
Janu should stay in contact right !

1000
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,760
So there is only incoming and there is no outgoing

1001
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,160
Kareem
- Sir

1002
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:49,166
Find only incoming call list for this area and tell me
- Nobody provides such information sir

1003
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:54,680
Sir I have my friends who gives such information and I’ll let you know
- Quick

1004
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:56,480
Sir !

1005
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,640
This is the only number which gets incoming calls
and not even one outgoing call is sent - Is it?

1006
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,280
Hello !

1007
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,400

01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,240

1027

I love you forever Janu, don’t you know it?

1028
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,440
That day after you went Bangalore

1029
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:11,600
Janu what happened?
- Come and sit

1030
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,560
What happened?

1031
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,240
Nothing

1032
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,360
Did Karthik scold you anything?
- Nothing like that sister

1033
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,520
Then why are you so sad

1034
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:28,680
Nothing ,you just sit
I’ll go and bring some coffee - Ha

1035
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,920
What’s this?
- Money

1036
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,680
If you want to take it just take away but kill her before you leave.

1037
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,120
So, you want me to kill her and go to jail
then you will enjoy with this Karthik right?

1038
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,280
Don’t talk rubbish, I’ll kill you.

1039
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:02,280
Rohit..

1040
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,560
Hey Rohit, Rohit what are you doing?
- Hey !!

1041
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:19,040

1042
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:22,080

1043
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,760
Rohit !

1044
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,240
Rohit !

1045
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:41,240
Why did you hit him?

1046
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,640
I hit him because I don’t know what to do sister.
- So, will you kill him ?

1047
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:48,440
I’m sorry sister, I didn’t do it intentionally.

1048
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,240
Sister please, sister please save me

1049
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,400
I don’t feel for him because he was an idoit.

1050
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,240
But we will be book in this case right?

1051
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:02,840
Let’s call Karthik, sister.

1052
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:09,200
No, no.. if you call Karthik, he will leave you for this reason.'
But it’s your wish , you can tell him If you want .

1053
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:14,320
No sister, I’ll do what you say.
- Please save me, please sister..

1054
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,040
Don’t worry jaanu, I’m with you.

1055
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:22,400
Do what I say, Don’t call anyone and
stay in the place that I would tell you.

1056
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,840
If anyone finds this then they will arrest me too..

1057
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,760
Ok Sister, I’ll listen to you, save me anyway.

1058
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:35,240
You too come with me..
- Sister bag..

1059
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,280
Hey , hey.. Don’t touch it, let’s go , let’s go

1060
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:45,640
Jaanu, that is not your mistake, just listen to me.
- No Karthik, I did a mistake, I killed Rohit.

1061
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,480
Jaanu

1062
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:50,080
watch this.

1063
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,240
Do you understand what you’re doing?

1064
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:03,840
I know, you just go ..

1065
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:09,720
Why did you trapped jaanu because of Karthik.

1066
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:16,280
She is innocent, she got stuck in the lions cage
by thinking she would lose her love.

1067
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,440
She should think about it before she enters in to the lions cage.

1068
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,720
Once she entered in to it then She should become a meal for lion .
You just shut up your mouth and sit silently.

1069
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:30,760
I’ll sit here after telling everything to the Karthik.
- Oh !

1070
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:40,200
I was thinking that you have been working for me from many years but...

1071
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,320
What's your Over - Action

1072
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:03,600
Do you understand?

1073
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,640
Where did you go Karthik?

1074
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,280
To meet Rohit.

1075
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:26,280
Did he meet you? - Why are you asking like that?
- Tell me Karthik, what is the matter?

1076
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,160
You should speak about it chaithra..
- Ask jaanu, I don’t know about it

1077
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,600
Tell me sister.

1078
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:40,560
What should I tell you? Don’t you know about it already.

1079
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:44,720
If the police know about you then you’re finished.

1080
01:50:46,233 --> 01:50:47,125
It’s ok, tell us

1081
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,920
These are the flight tickets you have booked to go to the Bangalore.
Why did you go there?

1082
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,880
This is the CC TV footage of the hospital
where you’ve stolen those blood samples.

1083
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,480
Why did you do it?

1084
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:10,000
According to a primary information that came to us ,
we got to know that the suspect is a lady.

1085
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:15,480
I thought that jaanu was suspect because
of the CC TV footage and mobile calls.

1086
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:23,520
But when I spoke to you at the hospital....
- But then we hide there because it will be a problem if she sees us.

1087
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,375
Then I understood .

1088
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:30,680
In Hospital I held your hand to find out whether
you’re lying or telling me the truth.

1089
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,400
I knew, you were under tension so, we immediately focused
on you and we have put the CCTV cameras too.

1090
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,708
I’m just waiting for the jaanu..

1091
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,360
Now, I want to know !

1092
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:52,833
Why you did it and how you did it.

1093
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:54,760
Hello..

1094
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:08,880
Silence.. When I was talking to Karthik
who were all of you in the middle...

1095
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:14,080
If I heard Anyone’s except Karthik voice ,
they will be dead you rascals..

1096
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:19,360
Karthik, let’s go , let’s go. Come

1097
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:25,120
Karthik shall we run away to somewhere?
Our life is waiting for us.

1098
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:29,800
How can you talk like that ?
How will you kill from one side and love from the other side.

1099
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,600
What happened to the Rohit?

1100
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,000
You told me that you would die right ?

1101
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:49,000
Tell me how my anger will be gone if you die !

1102
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,080
But if I kill you...

1103
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,200
These are the Jaanu’s blood and urine samples.

1104
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:24,600
Oh ! My sister , so sad..

1105
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,880
Sister, sister, sister !

1106
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,520
Burn in hell Janu. !

1107
01:53:54,480 --> 01:54:00,360
Now my Karthik belongs only to me, sorry jaanu !

1108
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,680
Did you kill my Rohit?

1109
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:11,040
You did a mistake Chaitra.
You are really life to him !

1110
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:17,560
He searched for you, he felt like that he won the world
if he finds a little information about you.

1111
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,920
He never asked anyone For anything in his life.!

1112
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:28,080
He literally begged for you ! he also convinced
me for your dance show photoshoot

1113
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:36,208
He spent all the money for you , that he took from me.
Hey! I’ll leave anything for him not just the money.

1114
01:54:36,352 --> 01:54:37,708
Including my love also.

1115
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,840
You finished his life because of your love.

1116
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:47,840
When I’m talking about our love story,
why are you saying about someone’s love story Karthik?

1117
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:52,360
I’ll kill anyone If they ever come in between us.

1118
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:56,760
Even it is jaanu , Rohit and that God also...

1119
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,840
Would it be love , If you kill them .
- What do you expect me to do Karthik?

1120
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:04,800
I really loved you..
- Hey

1121
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:08,200
I had many dreams with you

1122
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:12,200
I have created a new life with you

1123
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,520
But if someone comes and asked you to
leave your girlfriend then will you leave?

1124
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,083
I did not leave you because he said like that.

1125
01:55:23,239 --> 01:55:26,791
He said that my Chaitra won’t be happy with you
that’s why l left you..

1126
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:31,800
My friend who knew about me from a young age told me
that you were not comfortable with me

1127
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:33,240
That’s why I left you.

1128
01:55:33,903 --> 01:55:35,375
You left me

1129
01:55:36,458 --> 01:55:40,040
But our mother and father also left me with you.

1130
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:45,200
He told me what happened after he married me.

1131
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:51,040
Will you marry her on the same day
that you want to marry me.

1132
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:57,400
And she was roaming Infront of me and calling me as sister.

1133
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,120
Does anyone get angry or not?

1134
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,520
One day , I came to your house !

1135
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,040
And I read the Jaanu’s dairy.

1136
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,480
I got to know that she knew about your past life

1137
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:16,560
She had a doubt on you, so I used it.
I put you in police case

1138
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:22,640
I've got all the money , name and ego away from you

1139
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,080
I took your friends away from you !

1140
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:30,160
Eventually I thought you would come to me
at the end and you have arrived also.

1141
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:33,080
But everything was ruined by them

1142
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:34,880
Why are you laughing?

1143
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:39,200
Hey! Hey don’t shoot.
- Laugh now, laugh..- Please

1144
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:44,280
Who came to you, Did you think
I fell for your magic words?

1145
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,520
Did you ask me to leave right?
That’s when I had a suspicion about you.

1146
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:51,080
Shailu sent The whole video of what you did
and sent to jaanu.

1147
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,360
That’s why I brought you here.

1148
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:55,480
I do not want all this Karthik.

1149
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,200
All I need is you

1150
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,200
For your love I have killed so many people

1151
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:07,708
Please come and live with me.
- Do you even understand what you are doing?

1152
01:57:08,014 --> 01:57:09,166
You committed murders.

1153
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:13,833
Why are you saying like that Karthik? For her?

1154
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:21,480
Do you think she loved you?
Tell your wife to die for you, will you die?

1155
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:27,166
Look how much she loved you..She is afraid of life

1156
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:33,750
I’m ready to die, come with me, let’s go

1157
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:41,360
Will you give your life for me? You took so many lives.
Love means to give life but not to take lives.

1158
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:44,416
You always say that you will give life right?

1159
01:57:45,419 --> 01:57:46,958
Don’t play drama like that !

1160
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,840

- If you give all the kisses to your baby then what about me?

1166
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:34,880
If I die now, do you believe that I loved you?

1167
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:38,280

1168
