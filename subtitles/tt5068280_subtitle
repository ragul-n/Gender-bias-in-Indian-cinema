'- this story takes place before
the closure of bars in Kerala'

'Don't call me a drunkard because
more than the Iiquorl drank'

8
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:04,042
Greetings, I'm not a character
in this movie, okay

9
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:09,911
Before the movie begins and in
between there is a story narration, no?

10
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,088
In big movies it is Srinivasan sir and
Renjith sir who does this story narration

11
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,886
For example, when the movie
'Meeshamadhavan' starts

12
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,096
Haven't you heard that
dialogue said by Renjith sir?

13
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,065
On hearing that, it is a kind of thrill

14
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,337
I'm the one who is doing
the narration of this movie

15
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,641
But on asking who are you?
What is your merit for that?

16
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:41,745
What is the merit for a
drunkard at this toddy shop?

17
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,590
Even by begging or by postponing
the payment, will daily drink

18
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,057
But not only that

19
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,920
To tell the story of 'Pam bu'
(snake) and 'Paavada' (skirt)

20
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,599
The best merit is for

21
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,815
What a form is this?

22
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,752
Lucky that didn't buy
the wall mounting TV

23
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,487
Otherwise would have
turned over the entire wall!

24
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,764
What is this? In the previous
life was he a bat?

25
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,837
Pillaicha, very thirsty
Yeah you'll be thirsty

26
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,868
Yesterday you were drinking
like filling diesel in a tanker lorry

27
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,135
Should have thought on that

28
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,137
Morning you will have
the thirst and giddiness

29
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:22,151
Doing some stupid things and"!

30
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,089
Pillai, hey man Pillaicha!

31
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,527
Calling Pillai, Pillai now he
will start calling my mother

32
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,427
Hey man Pillaicha
Yeah I'm coming

33
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,524
Hell with it! To kill people

34
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,101
What is it? That is so urgent

35
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,067
Just lift this by holding the hand

36
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,104
If the parents had whacked you
at right time, now you won't do all this

37
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,777
By the way let me ask,
as I don't know -

38
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,885
- does the things in this
house have legs and hands?

39
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,246
Morning TV was 'upside down'

40
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,787
Now the fridge is lying
in 'Anandhashayanam' -

41
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,016
- as if like 'Patmanabaswamy?

42
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,921
And the shoes, one is in 'Pala'
and the other one is in 'Palli...!'

43
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,259
Shucks! Just move
back, move back

44
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,270
My mother!
Bring it, straight

45
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,936
Only this much, very correct

46
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,907
For this one, only"
How did you manage to do this?

47
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,773
At night, I tried to open it

48
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,576
For what?
To make a 'bulls eye'

49
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,810
Shucks! This thing so called egg,
should scold his father who invented it

50
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,157
Look, that eatery fellow is waiting
there - Which eatery guy?

51
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,259
My..My aunt's husband!

52
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,686
You should have consciousness
as little as bed bug!

53
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,499
Yesterday what had
happened in particular

54
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,040
Babu sir, just fire
off that 'Hamlet' speech

55
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,954
Man, who is that guy? - That one,
that is our 'Paavada' (skirt)

56
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,684
He is a peculiar character

57
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,131
What is it sir?
Babu sir, is getting intoxicated

58
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,568
Just have a watch on him

59
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:28,542
You dirty filthy lawyer
what are you laughing at?

60
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,042
I laughed since it was good

61
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,047
Man, what a nuisance is this?

62
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,979
The ear is getting deafening
Just turn on that TV

63
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,284
I didn't say"
Sit, sit

64
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,091
Pillaicha, let him say what is to
be or not to be - Man, that bill, bill

65
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,600
Fellow, turn off the TV

66
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,898
Is this TV your hereditary property?

67
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,702
To turn it on and off when you say?

68
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,175
My sir, this is not' foot step dance',
several programs will be staged

69
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,852
Just call Suresh sir

70
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,322
Lawyer!
Pillaicha, keep quite

71
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,195
Move off man
Buddy here comes the police come fast

72
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,294
Run and come man, come fast

73
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,205
Like that don't blame Babu alone

74
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,938
Those nuisance people
had come and provoked, isn't it?

75
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,874
Look lawyer on drinking if a problem
is created, police can't stand watching

76
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:39,709
All though it is told to lawyer, can
understand where that needle is poking

77
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,360
Sir, first of all learn to live decently

78
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,198
Should live decently
An adviser!

79
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,095
Pillaicha, I don't like to say like
this to a teacher who taught me

80
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,865
But this kind of character
will lead to a big trouble

81
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,044
Sir, won't he listen?
Don't you know?

82
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,148
Sir, bill

83
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,390
Look, today no
need it is late at night

84
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:26,294
The bad words that should be told
at the right time, if not it will get bitter

85
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,837
That was a correct hit

86
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,168
Please don't make this son to
pelt stones to a glass window

87
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,209
Look, Pillaicha, opened it

88
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,677
By disdaining the sleep in my life

89
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,413
Aren't you sleeping nicely?

90
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,884
When I was late might
have thought I won't come

91
00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:00,120
It wasn't intentional, urgently
wanted to create a fight

92
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,130
Now I'm going, really
hungry that is why

93
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,998
Don't be happy I
will come tomorrow also

94
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,204
I'll come till I die

95
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,369
If you die, I'll come to your
grave yard and scold you

96
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,343
And if I'm the one who is
dying, I'll come in your dreams

97
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:18,838
Like a ghost

98
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,252
Enough,enough
Right now I'm going

99
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,217
You have told, haven't you?
Come on get in

100
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,350
Look, son you are already drunk,
I'll drive, move to other side

101
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,862
This is my car, what is kept
on this seat is my 'buttocks

102
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,330
I know how to reach
home, with 'both' of this

103

Come on get in man!
Shucks!

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,785
I'll come now

111
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,599
On hearing this 'Paavada' (Skirt) you
must be thinking what a bad name it is

112
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,563
There are drunkards here
with much more bad names

113
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,441
That is very much inside this Kerala

00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,347
Then what?
Can I extinguish the bulb?

170
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,315
No, that's not possible
Both are perfect match!

171
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,187
Hey lady, put a sign here

172
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:10,352
Sister, told you are a nurse, no?
Could you marry someone with a job?

173
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,130
Sir, that was a mistake,
because of that Vijayan

174
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,236
Who is this Vijayan?

175
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,389
Fellows, move back!
Back off from the way!

176
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,264
Hey fellow, give the
ticket, give the ticket, I say!

177
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,699
Fellow, give the ticket!

178
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,774
First, it is 150
Two numbers

179
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,500
Do you have Rs. 3,00?
Come on take the money

180
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,503
Give the money here
Okay, I'll give

181
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,975
First it is 150, 150

182
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,647
Brother, how much is it? - 150
Can you give for 100? - Go man!

183
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,977
150 - For 200 can you give 2?
That is not possible

184
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,311
150, 150
Do you have association membership?

185
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,956
My goodness, I'm not
a fan, came to sell it in 'black'

186
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,351
That is what is said, if you
want to see the ticket in 'black'

187
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,789
You should have the
membership in association

188
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,964
Can't take the membership and all, if
you want can give a first class ticket

189
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,459
Before giving that, you
will get one first class 'whack'!

190
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,965
Don't show off man, don't show off

191
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,770
Will fall, don't push
Go man!

192
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:28,836
Hey don't push will fall!

193
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:29,562
What fellow?

194
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,393
Hey fellow!
Sir, will go

195
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,034
Okay sir

196
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,840
Sugatha!
Sir

197
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,410
Sugatha!
Hey man, SP sir had called

198
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,611
What is it sir? - For the brother in
law's program there are no people

199
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,653
On saying how can I create the
people? Am I 'Brahma?' (Creator)

200
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,383
Sir, you don't get tensed, for the
time being there are 4 men inside

201
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,822
Okay if is 4, you call them

202
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,621
Today I'll show them!

203
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,431
Hey man, go and
get inside the vehicle

204
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,601
For what sir?

205
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,862
To have the feast on
your '28th day function'

206
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:34,803
Come on go and
get inside the vehicle

207
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,301
Come, lets have the feast!

208
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,540
Get in fast, fellows
Sir where to? - Shut up fellow!

209
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,474
All of you get down

210
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,686
'Blood donation Cam p'

211
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,586
This club's secretary
is SP's brother in law

212
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,059
On hearing the blood donation
all had fled from this district

213
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,025
If the program becomes a failure,
bad name for SP and brother in law

214
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,000
That bad name should be covered
by giving our blood, isn't it?

215
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,100
Can't poke a needle on my body
I'll just"!

216
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,637
Walk man!
My dear sir, it is out of fear

217
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,469
On seeing the ' syringe'
my knees will start to shake

218
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,078
On breaking that knees, your
problem will be solved, won't it?

219
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,474
Come on man write
'Pam bu Joy' (snake Joy)

220
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,911
Not 'pass' it is 'Pam bu'

221
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,558
Look, 'Pam bu' they
are the doves of peace

222
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,456
They will inject without hurting

223
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,130
Not doves sir, they are 'witches'

224
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,437
Even on 'Kottayam
Pushpanath's ghost novels'

225
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,097
It is more decent than this, sir!

226
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,110
Fellow, while taking this injection,
it will hurt as if like an ant's bite

227
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,911
Long back when I was
bitten by a 'mad dog'

228
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,775
Had taken 16 injections
around my 'Umbilicus'

229
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,918
I just stood coolly

230
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,778
May be the dog which
had bitten you!

231
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,417

break your nerves today

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,652

234
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,825
Where are the wings?
What is it?

235
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,151
The wings?

236
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,464
Wings?
Please come

237
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:43,829
Which is the group?

238
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,469
Nothing like that will go for all
processions for all the 'groups'

239
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,429
I asked the blood group

240
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,631
ls there group for that one also?

241
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,433
Doesn't matter, we'll
check it over here

242
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,837
Should take the sample

243
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,777
What is this? Why are you lying
in a turned over manner?

244
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,183
Show the hand

245
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,083
I thought it will be from the back

246
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,023
Are you injecting on the hand?

247
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,094
Are you that much scared?

248
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,892
Is it for this you are scared like this?

249
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,763
Usually while going to a hospital-

250
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,838
-they inject like inserting an
iron rod on rocks

251
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,473
Like this for the first time
This is for taking the sample

252
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,167
To take the blood,
must inject once again

253
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,906
Since the sample was
taken from the show room

254
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,877
The original will be
taken from the godown

255
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,710
Is that also taken from hand?
Yeah!

256
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,486
Okay if it hand, okay with hand

257
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,188
The blood group is very rare

258
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,894
It is good to give blood
as a donation -

259
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,189
-within an interval of
one or two months

260
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,089
It will be also a help for the patients

261
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,666
Taking the blood, okay

262
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,946
Is it correct?

263
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,683
By the way, doesn't this
angel have a name?

264
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,819
Sinimol

265
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,758
What a bad name?
Why didn't you like it?

266
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,128
I'll take the burden of that

267
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,767
Even otherwise, why do these
angels have a name, man?

268
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,800
Should see the way,
she walks and comes

269
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,105
It is like peacock flying and coming
'Mai...!'

270
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,542
...Le, Ie! ...Mayil (peacock)
Did you ask?

271
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:15,178
When the love is started, on seeing
a 'crow ' will look like Kareena Kapoor

272
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,342
This is not like that, man
Then, how is it?

273
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,680
Should see how she walks,
like a swan very beauti'ful'

274
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,989
This is not 'full'
This is only a 'pint'

275
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,322
Shucks!
Stupid fellow!

276
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,889
Joycha, this love is like putting
a beer bottle inside the 'lungi'

277
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,366
- without wearing an
underwear, it is such a situation

278
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:37,571
It is risk - Anyway I have
decided to take the risk

279
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,671
By the way she has told Joychan's
blood is 'international blood' -

280
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,903
- it is very rare to get
isn't it, what she told?

281
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,807
Idiot don't call 'her' it is Sinimol

282
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,175
You should see her as a sister

283
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,748
I was telling, regarding
the matter of seeing

284
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,920
As there is good demand, will get
a good price on selling the blood

285
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,249
On that pretext you
can go and see her

286
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,813
How is it?

287
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,994
All though you are a 'chicken'
you are really a 'movement?

288
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,364

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,407
It is like the face of a 'Tamil guy'

336
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,455
In Tamil Nadu for 'face'
it is called 'moonchi' (Got dumped)

337
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,290
Hey girl, where are you hiding?

338
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,292
Come decently, then the
number of beating will be less

339
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,461
What is this? Is it a love letter?

340
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,267
'I'm going, won't come
back, do not search me'

341
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,976
'Drink and be the way you like,
enjoy and be peaceful - Sinimol'

342
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,848
Varghese!

343
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,919
What is it? - Hey man, Varghese
what is a movement at cemetery?

344
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,592
You also come with
me, will go and check

345
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,158
When it is mid night, certain things

346
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,989
Fellow, who is that one?

347
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,960
Did anyone come to steal the
offering box? - Who is that?

348
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,866
Father, it is me

349
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,475
My Jesus, Mother what
is he doing on top of a tree?

350
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,170
Get down fellow, from the tree top
No, I'm going to hang!

351
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,212
Fellow, don't hang yourself
on the tree, I say you get down

352
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,181
I'll hang - Fellow, it is me who is
saying get down from the tree

353
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,015
When I hang..My God!

354
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,212
Jesus!

355
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,989
San!
My sod,

356
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,956
Son, are you hurt?

357
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:05,327
What more to happen, when falling
down hitting the buttocks, it's nice, no?

358
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,569
I have told you, not to
hang on that, isn't it?

359
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,696
That was a rotten
branch, didn't you see that?

360
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,540
Then father, why can't
you say that before?

361
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,402
Yeah fellow, I will hang a board on
branches, that is suitable for hanging

362
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,946
Boy, what was that
big pain to hang?

363
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,347
Father, my wife is there, no?
Sinimol

364
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,521
She had left me and gone

365
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,388
I hanged out of that sorrow, father

366
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,320
Hey man, just lift this fellow

367
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,224
My dear father
Yeah, coming

368
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,256
Shucks!

369
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,263
Hello
Hello, father this is me, Sini

370
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,002
Yeah, where are you calling from,
now? - Father, I'm calling from Wayanad

371
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,011
Over here there is an old age
home named 'Karunya' (kindness)

372
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,545
It is managed by a monastery
Yeah, I know, I know

373
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,047
There is a need for a
nurse over here -

374
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,311
- mother at the hospital has
been saying for a longtime

375
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,555
Father, I had come here

376
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,419
Again if I stay there it won't be good
Daughter!

377
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,026
What is the problem
between you and Joy?

378
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,156
There is a limit to bear, isn't it?

379
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,134
Father you may ask directly
Daughter you may come from there

380
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,500
If you are not there,
he will never become good

381
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,470
To make him good we all tried so
far but it didn't work out, isn't it?

382
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,676
Now let him be good, by himself

383
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,442
I just called to inform
that I have reached here

384
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,242
If there is any urgency,
may call on this number

385
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,646
Yeah, one minute

386
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:33,519
Come on tell

387
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,751
Hey fellow, fellow, get up

388
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,464
Who told you to wear this one?

389
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,766
Father, didn't get anything else

390
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,425
Fellow, remove it

391
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,599
My goodness!
Otherwise no need

392
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,434
Hey boy, remove the gown I say!

393
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,110
Look father on seeing something
don't get scared and catch fever

394
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,779
Look, I'm the one who
is saying, remove the gown

395
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,774
There is nothing worn under this one
Shucks!

396
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:01,775
Dirty fellow!

397
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,183
If I'm a dirty fellow for
not wearing anything inside

398
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,379
What will you call her
for disdaining me?

399
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:10,091
If the husbands character is
bad, wives will leave and go

400
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,316
For all this what did you do at home?

401
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:16,124
That is like, any husband will have
some 'misunderstanding', no?

402
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,800
What is it?
'Mis understand-mending'!

403
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,464
Mis understanding

404
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:33,304
I have no hope whether
Joy will become good

405
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,412
Other than you, to
whom will I say my sorrow?

406
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,779
I know, now you also don't want me

407
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,850
You don't have the
time to console me

408
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,526
Buddy as far as from what
is heard, it is bit problematic

409
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,063
Man, I didn't hear
anyone else's sound

410
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:54,132
Then did she talk to a cat?

411
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,633
If it is cat, then it is okay

412
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,362
When there is no one around will
enter inside the kitchen, that's all

413
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,804
But there is a creature that climbs
on the bed, when there is no one

414
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,267
The 'paramoul'

415
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,673
'Marjaran!' (The cat)

416
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,815
I'll chop
You don't be like 'Talathil Dineshan'

417
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,843
Then what should I do?
Should I keep quite?

418
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,677
Not that, if someone comes to steal
and eat must catch him 'red handed'

419
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,621
If caught, then it is his last

420
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,897
After all I get a holiday
only on Sundays

421
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,600
At least at that time why can't you
sit at home, without drinking?

422
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:33,241
Girl, it is not to drink liquor and all
there is a dog lying in the well

423
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,705
Should call 'Velakoothi' (Lamp
extinguisher) and pick that up

424
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,209
Won't you be there for lunch?

425
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,213
No girl, I will come only
after cleaning that well

426
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,544
You close the door okay

427
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:07,426
'Jaran' (The paramour)
'Marjaran' (The cat)

428
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,752
'Jaran' (The paramour)
'Marjaran' (The cat)

429
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,281
Get lost, you dog!

430
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,221
Look, only you are there for me

431
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,495
Joy has left, not to clean
the well and the pond

432
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:36,432
Has gone to toddy shop, while
sitting with you like this I get bit of relief

433
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,434
And then when you sleep
with me what is that you get?

434
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,769
Is it roasted banana?

435
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,573
I'll end the disease
of both ones, today

436
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,225
No that, first of all I should
know who he is

437
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,328
I know you won't disdain me fully

438
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,638
All though he drinks liquor,
Joy is really fond of me

439
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,505
Just stop that drinking liquor
habit, the rest I'll manage

440
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:22,910
And don't think I have lighted
all this candles as a bribe, okay

441
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,879
Shucks!

442
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,223
What kind of a fellow am I?

443
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,390
Fellow, what are you
peeping at, on climbing a ladder'?

444
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,458
That is because there
is a snake inside this

445
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,297
What, another snake,
in a snake's house?

446
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,022
Snake is your father
What?

447
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,891
No it is a bird, flew off

448
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:47,935
Shucks!

449
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,057
How come so early?
Didn't you lift the dog?

450
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,029
That came out by itself

451
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,659
Did the dog climb by itself?

452
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,560
No, someone had lifted it

453
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,861
Today, you have returned
as a good boy

454
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,836
I'm hungry take the food

455
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,267
Since you told you won't come
to eat, I didn't prepare anything

456
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,443
This is yesterday's fish
curry, what happened?

457
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,877
Came straight home
without visiting toddy shop?

458
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,716
To tell the truth, today I thought
of drinking a bit out of sorrow

459
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,717
What is the sorrow that
you have to drink and all?

460
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,921
Girl, I misunderstood you

461
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,356
On hearing the conversations
of yours with God

462
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:48,664
I thought there is
someone coming here

463
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,829
Who else is there to come here?

464
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:55,544
Not that the other person
What, the other person?

465
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,406
'Jaran'
(Paramour)

466
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,343
Who?
Not like that

467
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,479
When saying 'Jaran' (Paramour)

468
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,918
I'm also a husband, no?

469
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,103
Not with the fish pot, should
have chopped you with knife

470
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,409
So that is it she is a divine one
on beating me with a pot and left

471
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,670
In my ear and eyes it was filled with
fish curry, then I became 'Shasi'

472
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,611
Father you call her and ask
what a decency is that?

473
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,445
I can't, you hear what she has to tell

474
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:41,816
Yeah, father must be
scared of her, I don't fear anyone

475
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,923
I'm her husband

476
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,426
Father, males should
have guts, guts

477
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,756
Yeah, I'm a female I lack
little bit of boldness

478
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,365
You call yourself

479
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,598
Varghese chettan, cover the ears,
when she picks up the phone

480
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,965
I'm going to say the bad words
which may deaf her ears

481
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,401
Is it so?

482
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,509
Hello, is it 'Karunia Old age Home?'

483
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,143
ls there a nurse named
Sinimol who is newly joined?

484
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,708
Her husband is calling

485
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,710
Are you this person named Joy?
Without a spine?

486
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,584
Without attending the affairs
of the family and drinks liquor -

487
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,655
- are you a husband?

488
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,483
To create bad name for males!

489
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,827
Every where there is people like this
who are useless for money and soil

490
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,829
Fellow, by putting a moustache under
the nose, you won't become a male

491
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,094
Since this girl doesn't have good
brothers to break your bones -

492
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,166
- that is why you show off like this

493
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,408
Again if at all you
call this girl and disturb!

494
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,171
It is not fish curry, I'll pour
melted iron in your mouth!

495
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,039
Fellow, I say cut the phone!

496
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,718
Hey fellow, Joy did you get her?

497
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:53,555
I didn't get her but I got nicely!

498
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,728
You remove this gown and dress
like a human being and come

499
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,692
I need to talk with you certain things

500
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,666
I don't have an
opinion that drinking is a big sin

501
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:07,071
But in stead of we drinking liquor,
liquor drinking us that isn't a big thing

502
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,904
My dear father, the 'Karal (liver)
Valkey's' son who died of a liver issues

503
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,137
In stead of drinking liquor, do
you think he'll drink milk water?

504
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,950
Why not liver you
also damage the intestine?

505
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,109
You put a nipple on top of the
bottle and you suck it 24 hours

506
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,251
It is not because I
think to stop drinking liquor

507
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,524
Every day morning I have
this severe guilt feeling

508
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,250
I'll think I won't
touch this liquor again

509
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,154
But we.. -After the sun set
the hand will start to shake

510
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,494
That is like that, by adding colour,
this liquor which is inside the bottle

511
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,690
Actually do you know what it is?

512
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:37,463
That is the urine of 'Satan' - Shucks!
That will keep on calling

513
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,733
Hey fellow, for drinking liquor,
there is no happy ending

514
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,239
The money in the hand will
be lost, the mind will be lost

515
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,069
The health and peace
of mind will be lost

516
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,840
Sometimes may even die

517
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,711
Now if nothing of this
has happened -

518
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,249
- perhaps the liquor may get finished

519
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,251
Father, to stop drinking
what should be done?

520
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,612
Tell me that

521
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,853
Are you asking this seriously?

522
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,621
Yes father
Then, can you go to place that I tell?

523
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,228
Will go
Is it a word?

524
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,262
Father that is a word, why because

525
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,730
When people with knowledge
say we can learn something, no?

526
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,202
Yeah
Father, can I ask a doubt?

527
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:18,709
To know this much of this..
Come on ask

528
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,107
Father you are hard
core drinker, no?

529
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,284
Shucks!

530
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,856
My son,just go slow
Shut up man

531
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,588
Hello, where are you buddy?
That is him, no?

532
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,835
That fellow who created
a quarrel at the bar

533
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,526
Let him go as he likes

534
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,832
Yeah, let him go but can
meet him and go, isn't it?

535
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,100
Son!

536
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:02,589
Go man Paavada (Skirt)
Pillaicha, he ran!

537
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,024
I'll come now

538
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,633
I'll show now

539
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,169
Not to any where
Only to there

540
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,681
He and his new car

541
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,820
Hey fellow, my car! - Son that
car is different, that is not his

542
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,185
Hey fellow, stop there

543
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,825
Stop there
Pillaicha, get in - Go, go

544
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:45,130
My god, my car, not even after one
hour since received from show room

545
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,598
My god, my car
Hey fellow I'll show you

546
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,864
On seeing how you lie down,
no one will say you smashed -

547
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,374
- MLA's brother in law's car

548
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,906
Sir, what have you done?

549
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,214
Son!

550
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,114
This belongs to my brother in law

551
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,779
Certified like that by MLAI didn't
see such a board in front of that car

552
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,950
Pillaicha, on hearing this I get itching
That is because of no bathing

553
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,628
Look shut up
Sorry

554
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,221
Since Acha Poti has told
revealed from that case

555
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,627
Lucky that the politician's
didn't kill me

556
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,130
Every now and then sir
creates a quarrel -

557
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,067
- and I have to make a
compromise, I'm fed up

558
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,974
Sir, whom do you want to
defeat you drink like this?

559
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:32,043
No alcoholic will
drink to defeat anyone

560
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,941
Just to show, oneself
that he hasn't failed himself

561
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,784
An empty bottle

562
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,762
If milk is filled in it, it is milk bottle

563
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,895
If poison is filled, it is poison bottle

564
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,736
If not if it is broken and
stabbed on someone's stomach

565
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,462
It is a bottle to kill

566
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,431
The path of life will depend
on the experience we gain in life

567
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,736
Isn't it Pillaicha?

568
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,008
Everyone who drinks
has got this disease

569
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,342
When telling a matter, in return will
say rotten excuses and try to win

570
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,318
Sir, one thing I'll surely say

571
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,790
Again you can't go
ahead with this drinking habits

572
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,083
Suresh, that isn't
decided by you alone

573
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,091
Correct, correct!

574
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:23,698
Look, the filthy friends like you
doesn't allow sir to become good

575
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,826
Indeed a right name,
'Gunashekaran' move back, man

576
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,406
Yeah this is 'Kattiparamban'

577
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:45,476
Man, tell correctly
only then can sketch

578
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,178
We will snatch the person

579
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,019
Near the beverages,
okay, okay yeah

580
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,063
Hey boys, must go to beverages

581
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,791
There is a task

582
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:07,059
<i>MW W“</i>

583
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,984
Isn't this Kuttappayi chettan? - Yes
We are from a far off place

584
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:27,887
So what? - Came on knowing you
are very expert in preparing biriyani

585
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,859
There is a function to prepare
biriyani for 100 to 150 people

586
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,264
Biriyani, to prepare that
there is no mood today

587
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,863
Go and come tomorrow
Look here

588
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,368
There is stuff and all

589
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,240
It is not done for the first time
The new person is very violent

590
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,812
Yeah, I'm coming
Okay

591
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,016
Leave me fellow!
Leave me you dog!

592
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:02,230
My god, leave me fellows!

593
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,597
Leave me you dog!

594
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,271
Leave me
Hey fellow, close the mouth

595
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,798
Turn him to other side

596
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,144
Decently lie there idle

597
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,906
Leave fellows
Don't inject

598
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,551
Don't inject

599
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,483
Don't inject

600
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,323
Father, this is a sort of...!

601
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:40,586
"Myna arise from the sea
Myna..."

602
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,377
Circle, where is this class?
It is in a seminary

603
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,108
It is the students who
learn to become clergy

604
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,115
The rector father is a friend of mine

605
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,618
When he told he wants a person
to take class on Shakespeare

606
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,491
I never had a second thought

607
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,594
I recommended Babu sir's name
But why did you drag me?

608
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,160
That is because son Babu is
desperate on living with bar and home

609
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,961
When he takes the class,
he will regain the lost spirit

610
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,035
Then it is a cooperation
with all of us, isn't it sir?

611
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,936
Circle, I want to piss a glass of urine

612
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,377
Can piss when you go inside

613
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,142
My bladder will break now

614
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,286
Just stop, stop my god
Go and piss fast and come

615
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,580
Where are you going?

616
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,319
Hey Babu, last week there
was a feature on this institution

617
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:41,325
I've read that, this is a jail man,
where they keep drunkards

618
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,156
Run and escape if you
want your life back

619
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,066
De-addiction centre
Sir, take the car

620
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,165
Take the car
Stop the vehicle

621
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,665
Stop the vehicle

622
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,297
Is there your father
at de-addiction centre?

623
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,145
Catch, catch!
Don't run

624
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,573
Leave
Come, I say

625
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,917
Take him inside, put him
inside the treatment room

626
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,211
You cheater, leave me
Take him fast

627
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,079
Take him inside
Pillaicha!

628
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:13,445
<i>MW W“</i>

629
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,103
Father, this is a sort of..

630
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:36,513
'Hey sky, give a musical cloud"

631
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,088
'Hey Sky"

632
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:45,484
Minimum only after 15 days only
person will be send out of the compound

633
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,995
It doesn't mean that he is
full time locked up in the room

634
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:53,497
Meditation, yoga, the sessions
to share the experiences

635
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,600
The classes conducted by doctors

636
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,472
There are lot of things
like that over here

637
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:02,199
After waking up from sedation
will get used to this atmosphere

638
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,708
Then we'll come
after 15 days to take him

639
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,742
That is when people
come to take him

640
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,485
Some patients will feel like there
is some serious mental illness

641
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:19,254
Why should we create a guilt
feeling to people who are normal?

642
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,692
Then in that case,
let the car be here

643
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,457
The key

644
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,165
Okay then

645
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,459
Greetings sir!
Who are you?

646
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,727
Joy, Pam bu Joy! (Snake Joy)

647
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,306
No sir, no way they
have locked from outside

648
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,149
Open the door

649
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,847
Is there anyone?
Open the door

650
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,419
My goodness Tiger,
who is banging on the door?

651
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,685
I have nothing to loose, I'll just inject
you and make you unconscious

652
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,594
Just go and sleep did you hear?

653
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:42,874
Sir, better not to act smart, a cook is
locked up here for creating trouble

654
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,638
Once you end up
here, you are just finished

655
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:48,742
<i>M'! gem!</i>

656
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,280
Did it hurt?
Get lost man - Yeah gone!

657
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,644
When the 'tiger'
comes he'll inject you

658
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,528
Yeah next person

659
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,469
What is your name?
What? - What is your name?

660
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,905
Professor Babu Joseph

661
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:58,911
Slowly will get cured, when I came
I've told I'm Lal Bahadur Shasthri!

662
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,622
What's up Joy?
Whom are you injecting today?

663
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:06,452
No one today

664
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:10,491
Hey man, hey man
please set me free

665
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,566
Just say this, the plantain tree
without shoot, then I'll open

666
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,500
It is 'Pappad'
'Pappad', go man, I'll open it!

667
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,300
Hey man,just open it

668
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,739
Hey man, didn't I say 'Pappad'?
Keep quite man

669
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,779
Don't create a bad
name for drunkards, okay

670
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,474
Sir, it is 'Urine' treatment, earlier one
Prime Minister used to do like this

671
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,386
I'm also in need
of some 'Urine' treatment

672
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,484
That is how can I sir?

673
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,523
Hey fellow, Christ
turned water to wine -

674
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,526
- how can you
turn 'urine' to 'alcohol'?

675
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:20,230
That is a superb technique,
since it is sir, I'll show you, okay

676
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:45,520
Just fasten this like this, as and
when required the 'thing' is ready

677
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,029
Actually what is your profession?

678
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,771
Sir, there is no job in particular -

679
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,066
- knows driving, wielding,
plum ping, cooking

680
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,707
Taps the rubber, cleans the pond,
milks cow, sells black ticket

681
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,313
But because of this
drinking, can't stay in one field

682
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,347
Sir, I'm not the
'Jacky' that is my tutor

683
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:17,554
Who is that?
Sagar Eliyas Jacky

684
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,523
I'm becoming shy
Hey man Jacky

685
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,334
My dear 'Pam bu' Joy (Snake Joy)
That is me

686
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,334
What is going on there? You will
make me to take the syringe

687
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,908
No need of injection

688
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,411
Fellow, what is today's food?

689
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:46,447
Shall I say it?
Good toddy and Rabbit meat

690
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,483
Hey fellow, just open this
and free me

691
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,721
if you can render a speech in
English, I'll open it - Go man!

692
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,090
No doubt why he is looked up,
my god! - Get lost man, get lost

693
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,791
You won't come up in life, fellow

694
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,834
Son, Joyjust pour one more

695
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:12,740
So far no one has
called me son Joy!

696
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,673
Babu sir, I feel like crying

697
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,713
Me too

698
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,982
What is that for'?
Its not that..

699
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:26,086
When everyone calls me sir

700
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:32,092
I feel like within their mind, they are
changing 'one word' and calling!

701
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:38,169
But when you call me
Babu sir, there is a different feel

702
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,807
Come on drink sir!

703
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,514
Son! - Tell sir
Why don't we escape from here?

704
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,015
And then?
We'll go home

705
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:03,763
While going, there should be
someone to wait, that is called a home

706
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,592
So in that sense
I don't have a home

707
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:13,198
Are you..Coming along with me?

708
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:20,498
<i>MW W“</i>

709
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,090
Hey fellow, where are
you hiding all this?

710
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,494
At the central jail in Kannur, people
keep fridge and computer inside the ass!

711
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,221
Sir, then a mobile
phone is simple, no?

712
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,762
'Addiction centre of Sanjeevani'!

713
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:48,241
Hey watch man, watch man!
Yeah, what is it?

714
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:52,442
Coming from cable's office
came to repair the setter box

715
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,706
Open it fast

716
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:01,755
Are you getting cold? My god help!
Hey fellow stop there!

717
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,721
Someone help me
Stop there

718
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,861
My goodness, this guy is coming
to kill me - Stop there I say

719
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,862
Someone kill him by beating, my
goodness climbing on the post

720
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,829
Hey fellow! Come down
You get lost man!

721
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,696
Fellow, telling you to get down

722
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:18,203
You get lost, you dog! I'm
mad, I'll catch on this cable

723
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,506
Hey fellow, get down
You get lost

724
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,868
My God! Father come running

725
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,511
'Velakoothi Rajan' has
started his job (Lamp extinguisher)

726
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,579
Father, come running

727
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,550
Father!
What is it man?

728
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,517
One mad man has climbed on the post,
he is about to catch the electric wire!

729
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,815
Come running - Climbed on the
post and catching the wire

730
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,923
On that day the kick you gave
on the chair, do it on this lock

731
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,926
Come on sir do it
Hey fellow, who are you? Get down

732
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:45,099
I'm Injamin Hakk, I'm mad
man, I'll hold on this wire

733
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,067
Hey fellow, get down

734
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,610
Hey fellow get down decently
I lack decency

735
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,114
You go and file a case

736
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,086
Sir, got the vehicle's key

737
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,284
What happened?
Sir, you may go

738
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,255
I'll come
Where are you going?

739
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,129
Now if there is any
problem don't wait for me

740
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,562
Sir, you escape okay

741
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,337
Is it this one?

742
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,337
No need to render a
speech in English okay -

743
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,844
- I've open the back door you
escape through that way

744
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,790
Hey fellow, get down
what is that you want?

745
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:45,788
Father can you sing a lullaby for me?

746
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,360
Luflaby?
Father I sing lullaby very well

747
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,959
I'll whack you go and get a ladder

748
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,158
Come down I say!
Father he is escaping with a car

749
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:58,271
Catch the car, lock the gate man
Bye, bye!

750
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,232
You stupid father, did you see
my kids escaping with the car?

751
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,600
Hey fools, lock the
gate go and catch

752
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,942
Babu sir!
I've come!

753
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,807
Son, Joy just pop in!

754
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,676
Okay take the car fast

755
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,918
Stop there, stop I say!

756
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:17,684
If you follow us,
will whack you inside out!

757
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,856
Hi five!

758
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,860
Babu sir, why don't we go
for a 'urine treatment'?

759
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,764
Come on son Joy,
you may just pour it

760
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,041
Over here give one
omelette and two Dosha

761
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,208
Come on take it fast

762
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:44,651
Brother, which is this
Babu sir's house?

763
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:49,312
Which Babu sir'?
That is.. This Babu Joseph

764
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,791
For few years back he
was a tutor in a college

765
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,958
Has got some 'drinking habits'
So, its 'Pavaada's' house, isn't it?

766
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,192
No man, its your grandfather's
My goodness, sir were you inside?

767
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,232
Just go straight the
vehicle knows the route!

768
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,139
Sir over here when asking the route -

769
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,831
- all are saying the topic
of 'pavaada' (skirt) and blouse

770
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:11,035
Do you know what the problem is?
By evening all gets drunk out here

771
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,338
No one has got a clear mind

772
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,004
Just go straight the
vehicle knows the way

773
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,181
Straight isn't it?
Yeah!

774

<i>MW W“</i>

775
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:34,101
Hey fellow, fellow, who are you?

776
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,429
I'm 'Pambu' (snake)
Understood on seeing it

777
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,136
From where did you get this vehicle?

778
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,898
This vehicle is..
From where did you get this vehicle?

779
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:44,101
Hey you, you cheat!

780
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,448
The 'vaal'(sword) isn't my
weapon of agitation

781
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,779
The 'vaal' (the puke)

782
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,124
Where did he go?

783
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,770
So, haven't you left so far?
Nope

784
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:15,771
Just go out from here now -As long
as Babu sir says, I'm not going anywhere

785
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,467
It is not enough that
you decide it yourself

786
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:22,112
What is this? - In our native
its called 'chicken curry'

787
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,215
I don't know what is called, out here

788
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,976
I'm asking from where it has come?

789
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,087
In the morning I saw it standing in
the compound, threw a stone

790
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,722
Plucked off all the feathers nicely

791
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,289
After that it was taken to fire-heath

792
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,154
My God!
What has happened to God?

793
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:38,195
Son Babu, he is making a dish
out of that Lalechan's chicken

794
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:39,799
Isn't it? That is fine

795
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,332
Anyway it won't shit
again on the floor

796
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,061
By the way are you planning to
lodge him here permanently?

797
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:47,731
Yeah! - Then we both can't
remain here together

798
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,035
Even othenlvise I was planning
to dismiss you - What?

799
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:54,340
More brutal than that Brutus, you
and that Suresh took me for a ride!

800
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,741
You won't know the value
of eyes, when there is eyes

801
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:00,353
I will go as I like, I said I'll go as I like

802
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,483
Hey fellow, take some curry

803
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,453
One minute there is one
more thing to be done

804
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,045
Just rocked!

805
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:30,078
What is all this? Should cook beef

806
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,216
Is there any other meat
to challenge the beef?

807
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,319
Sir, should invent a new one

808
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,318
Do you know why?
I'm mad on beef

809
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,290
But Pillaichan won't buy it
saying cholesterol is high for me

810
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,396
Now as the Pillaichan has left,
you don't have to worry on that

811
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,958
Yeah, Pillaichan has left,
just move back let me serve it

812
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,963
If I know to make the
dish, I know how to serve it

813
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,297
You go and mind your business
Don't touch my body and play

814
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,064
I'll come after a drink
Good, when you drink

815
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,504
Outside the person who
chops is waiting - Who?

816
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,138
The person who chops

817
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:02,006
What is this man? - Babu sir!
Only this much sheets?

818
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,173
What else to say? - There is no use
of chopping this way and that way

819
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,446
The thing is less, by
chopping my health is wasted

820
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,016
Sim Ply!

821
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,927
By tapping 400 trees, it is not
enough getting 8 sheets, brother

822
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,458
What can I do? As the
quality of tree is bad

823
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,494
Whatever be the poor quality of tree,
this much sheet is not enough

824
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,625
Then is it because of my tapping?

825
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,931
So far no one has blamed on my
rubber tapping, born to a decent father

826
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,100
If you say like that, no
one will blame you, no?

827
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,932
Because on saying, the one
who has told will become -

828
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,267
- a fellow who is born to
an in decent father!

829
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,375
My goodness, if you
don't trust me, I'll go

830
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:33,513
My goodness, over here on saying
anything, people just leave the job, no?

831
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,849
Brother, you come here
What is it? - Come here

832
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:45,286
Brother this is not tapped
May be that one is left out

833
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,988
This one is also not tapped

834
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,522
In this raw none is tapped

835
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:55,600
For the time being I
can tap only this much

836
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,629
You may let me do the job,
only if you have a golden soul

837
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:58,995

839
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,171
Also should need the pension

840
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:08,046
Sir, when he is asking should give
it that is the decent way of doing it

841
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,650
Yes, yes
So, we shall pay, this is PF

Yeah, that is sure, that's enough

Due to public
agitation it was cancelled

You don't make an
issue, just move back

01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,390
This is a place where
we regularly buy the liquor

All of a sudden when this is shifted
from here, what kind of a rule is that?

01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:36,568
At that time a young man he took
the charge of the strike himself

910
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,268
He diverted the
route of the agitation

give liquor to drunkards

only then you can take this lorry

named Joy, blocked the way

getting a hero of the strike

916
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,283

embarked upon sit - in agitation

01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,221
The route of the
agitation is changed

have you got to say?

have you got to say?

01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:02,469
Stop this - We pay the price what is
said making this shop run in profit

boozing of these people

And at last before the determination
of Joy and other people

927
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,815
The authorities had to bend
down, that sight is seen here

Taking into consideration the pulse
of public, this outlet at 'Poovarani'

celebration of agitation hero Joy

him on the shoulders

lucky, come on have it

942
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,724
Need to pour water
or something like that, no?

01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,452
No need of that, its culture
will be lost just drink in a gulp

Come on don't con!

01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,900
How is it?

948
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:52,335
As if a train has
gone through the throat

01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,343
Hey fellow, how do you
manage to drink all this?

950
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:58,883
Now did you understand, by bearing
what all difficulties we drink this stuff?

951
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:03,581
Right from the days when son
Babu's father was alive, I was here

952
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:07,086
My father was also a
manger of this place

953
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:13,866
Get lost you..This bull
had killed my father

954
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:19,636
My goodness, so your father
was a great hunter, wasn't he?

955
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,900
One day as he was having
his rice-gruel under this

956
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,672
This thing came off from the
nail and fell on father's head

957
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:27,472
My god!
On the spot he died

958
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:35,379
Earlier when he comes here, it is full
of singing songs and merry making

959
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:38,883
What singing songs and merry
making, this is Christ, no?

960
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:42,118
This is not Christ or 'verb'
he is a friend of son Babu

961
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:43,724

962
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,627

It is son Babu's

963
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:50,496
This is also for the first time, no?
Where is the match box?

964
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:56,671
Here
Son Babu will forget this and go

965
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:03,447
So, sometimes I take that
and smoke once in a while

966
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,176
There it goes
Hey, match box, this guy is..

967
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:07,885
Didn't I give you the match box?

968
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,486
Where to go and search this one?

969

1003
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:03,034
Can't blame also, as that movie
was issued with 'A' certificate

1004
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:06,804
During that time when it was
planned, there was no 'sleazy scene'

1005
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,378
Even the name of the
movie was not 'Paavada (skirt)

1006
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:18,384
The hardships of life
with its jaws open -

1007
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:22,893
At last she walks into railway tunnel

1008
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:26,959
In the roar of approaching train's
sound we'll freeze that scene

1009
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:29,260
The words which
appear on top of that visual

1010
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,328
Even the wayfarers which
come inside a train's coupe

1011
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,574
During the journey they become
a part of established interest

1012
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:40,502
Those who desist that stink of
established interest, they are hated

1013
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:46,849
More enticing than a train journey
the rule of men in power is disgusting

1014
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:52,585
It is beyond the limits of the
feelings indulged by men in power

1015
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:55,590
Man, this is what my film is

1016
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:00,599
There is no use of
clapping the hands -

1017
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,593
- it will get soiled in this stinking bag

1018
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,605
There is no one with
courage to produce this one

1019
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:13,879
Hey fellow, I don't know what a
movie is, how it is made and all

1020
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,275
That is not my area

1021
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,517
But my spine is very strong

1022
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:24,288
What is there? Hey fellow
I'll produce this movie

1023
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,292
Really?
Why not?

1024
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,464
Even though agreed to
produce that movie on drinks

1025
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:37,135
Babu stood for that movie
with cent percent sincerity

1026
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,602
To encourage him,
there were few friends also

1027
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,237
Greetings sir

1028
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,381
For our heroine

1029
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,173
I'll call, go, go

1030
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:54,152
What is this man? - Not that sir,
for them the rate is also less

1031
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:56,151
Certain adjustments
can be also done

1032
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:57,585
What?
Not that we..

1033
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,322
While saying it is a female oriented
subject it doesn't mean it is a blue film

1034
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:04,361
What is required here is a production
controller, not a pimp

1035
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,590
We'll find some other
person, I'll wait outside

1036
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,068
Advocate, shall we go?
Yeah lets leave

1037
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:10,702
Buddy, there is a news

1038
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,937
It happened all of a sudden
What is it man?

1039
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,539
Today is my wedding fixation

1040
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:19,611
Who is that mis fortunate?

1041
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,680
She is a teacher
Teacher?

1042
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,111
Man, is there a love
story in this script?

1043
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,312
Buddy, what love story
which you do not know

1044
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,320
But now a small doubt have
started to love - That is okay

1045
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:35,325
That will go

1046
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,552
Hey man don't
twist your black tongue

1047
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,932
Sir, has got some
stills of drama heroines

1048
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,094
How is this one?

1049
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,570
This is good, a good girl

1050
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,169
She isn't a girl, she is
a mother of a child

1051
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:50,740
The name is Cisily

1052
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,204
For me it is the same
whether it is drama or movie

1053
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:58,441
When she goes I have to sit at
home cleaning this boy's urine and shit

1054
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:01,051
Then regarding the money
it should be correct

1055
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,017
All that is fixed by Eldo isn't it?

1056
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:07,182
Sir, I have told that - Have you told?
Everything should be as per what is told

1057
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:09,589
Since the producer is
Babu sir, don't doubt on that

1058
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:13,231
Then shall we? Babu?
Didn't drink even a black tea

1059
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,228
Nothing is required, hello

1060
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,068
Who is this smart boy?
Joy

1061
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,570
Is it son Joy?

1062
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:25,233
At that time when the drinking liquor
and creative field was going on

1063
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,209
One thing had happened

1064
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:30,645
What is destined to come, will
come it comes calling a can

1065
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,749
Who is this in between this?

1066
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,589
Who is that idiot,
coming to the frame? - Sir

1067
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,357
He is the father of our
producer, Joseph chettan

1068
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,194
Not producefs even if it
is Jesus Christ's father -

1069
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,065
- on coming to frame, I'll scold

1070
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,274
Some stupids, morning itself
Sir, don't create a scene, god's sake

1071
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:58,171
I'm the one who has to decide
which scene to be added or deleted

1072
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,082
When Chandra Mohan became
the Hitler of the movie - Hey Pillai!

1073
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,309
Joseph chettan became
the Mussolini of the house

1074
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:08,716
Between father and son
declared a second world war

1075
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:13,354
Come on call him man, in front of
sluts I have not come, to hear the abuse

1076
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:16,791
Without permission did anyone tell
father to enter inside the frame?

1077
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:19,324
No man, in the house
on which I pay the tax

1078
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:22,468
To see the nonsense what is done
by you people, I'll get notice before hand

1079
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,601
While coming to see the shooting -

1080
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,796
- we have to follow
some minimum decency

1081
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:30,803
This planter Joseph is not willing and
does not have time to learn decency

1082
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,303
So far you have
gambled with my sweat-

1083
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,310
- that was wiped off
from my forehead, as money

1084
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:40,316
Now on that is not required, make
movie or song with your own money

1085
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:44,253
Hey man when a junior artist was
ruining the scene by taking 5 to 6 takes

1086
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:45,516
At that time your father had come

1087
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:48,853
I told something and all
in that mood off

1088
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,493
If you want I'll fall on your
fathers feet and say sorry

1089
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:53,563
Do something
For what?

1090
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:57,135
At this old age he shouldn't be so
tough - What to do for the fund?

1091
01:24:57,325 --> 01:25:02,570
For the fund..At Madras there are
some 'Marvadies' who fund movies

1092
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:04,834
But should pay good interest

1093
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,407
All that is not workable
Why isn't it workable?

1094
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:10,740
We've decided and started
it, we are not going back

1095
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:14,546
By borrowing and by taking loan on
high interest shooting went ahead

1096
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,881
At that time the
next tragedy happened

1097
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:24,822
Sir, sir what happened?

1098
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:30,726
My God, blood

1099
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:34,206
Chandra Mohan sir
What happened sir?

1100
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:36,102
Sir, what happened?

1101
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:39,143
Fellow, bring that vehicle
take him to hospital

1102
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:41,609
<i>Sir'.
My gar.“!</i>

1103
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,308
Without reaching the place
where it was decided

1104
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,145
Chandra Mohan went for
a ride with death

1105
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:52,742
<i>MW W“</i>

1106
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:06,803
Whoever it is in Cinema, this
death and baptism is not an issue

1107
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,903
Not even director
even if the super star dies

1108
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,572
The cinema will continue its
way as it is planned

1109
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:16,739
Whoevefs mother dies there
will be people to make movies

1110
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,911
Don't include me in that category

1111
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:20,912
No sir, I didn't mean like that

1112
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,291
Please, leave me alone all of you

1113
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,790
The money lenders will not have
such feelings and emotions

1114
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:31,957
If the movie is not released on
date what is told, it may not end here

1115
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,197
Now what is the solution?

1116
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,631
There is a way, our
cinema in the present condition

1117
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:41,273
There is some chance
of getting an award

1118
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,874
But it won't run at a theatre for a
single day, there is no chance for it

1119
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:46,711
Sir, which distributor will come
forward to take up a movie -?

1120
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,779
- That is named 'railway track!'

1121
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:50,574
First of all we should
change this title -

1122
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:54,811
-then to sell, must add
some 'sleazy stuff'

1123
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,955
Our assistant director
Prasad is there, no?

1124
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:59,280
He is a smart guy, I'll
make him do all this things

1125
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,222
Later on things were done
according to likes of Eldo

1126
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,294
Without the knowledge
of we people or -

1127
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:08,331
- with the permission of your mother,
he had inserted lot of scenes in it

1128
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,294
Like that, 'the railway track'
had become 'Paavada' (skirt)

1129
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,899
Cisily had become a
heroine of a 'A' movie!

1130
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,270
I only know the things
which is heard about mother

1131
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:30,211
Has father thrown her out? Or has
she fled because of the torture of father?

1132
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:33,457
I do not know anything

1133
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:38,286
But still, sir, I'll not blame my father

1134
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:42,425
Because of shame he had
to flee from the native place

1135
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,900
What else can he do?

1136
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:50,306
Out of pain, he might have
whacked and hitted her

1137
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:54,604
Whether she had
fled or forced to flee

1138
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:58,815
I have lost my mother
who gave birth to me!

1139
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:06,015
What father received is
mental grief till his death

1140
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:17,326
His case was
not something different

1141
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:25,805
'Paavada (skirt) 'A'
3 plays, 4 bathing scenes!'

1142
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:29,414
Hey 'Paavada (ski rt)!'
Not 'Paavada' man, its underwear!

1143
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,881
Like that professor Babu Joseph
became 'Paavada(skirt)' Babu!

1144
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:37,618
With that even the marriage was
cancelled as the date was fixed

1145
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:42,794
When he gets high with liquor, this
son Babu goes and scolds her family

1146
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:50,964
Hey you shame less fickleness,
you are named as women

1147
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:54,800
For the only son to enjoy majority of
the estates possessed by hard work -

1148
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:56,908
- were taken away by money lenders

1149
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,408
Seeing that only
Planter Joseph chettan died!

1150
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:04,340
It is said that when there is mental
pain, the liquor become our friend

1151
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:08,075
After that son Babu was
always under mental sorrow

1152
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,616
The only relief was when
taking class at the college

1153
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:22,125
Sir, when saying this 'A'
is it the 'A' of 'A' (adult) movie?

1154
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:27,769
No fellow, it is the 'A' of your
mother's 28th day of birth!

1155
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:33,041
The PTI committee has
received a serious report on you

1156
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:37,680
It is bit indecent when saying
this 'mothefs 28th day of birth'

1157
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:42,577
Actually what I intended was
'your mother's 16th day of birth!'

1158
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:46,390
Your mother's 16th day of
birth function, he and his memo

1159
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:49,756
Like that he had lost
his job also, which was there

1160
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:52,089
When looking at the
account book of that movie -

1161
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:55,525
Its severe loss to both of you!
That is the balance for you people

1162
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,849
Sir!

1163
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:17,018
On that movie box, when I suddenly
saw the picture of my mother!

1164
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:22,858
Sir, please pardon me!

1165
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:31,936
Joy!

1166
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:38,106
All though it is done
without knowing

1167
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,670
To correct a mistake on which
I also became a part, perhaps"!

take English class <i>in</i> any seminary?

1173

Sir, there is a small problem

01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:18,915
What is it?

01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,056

You may go, I'll come

01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:25,278
Who is this my goodness?
Is it Babu sir?

1187
01:32:29,243 --> 01:32:33,692
Sir, were you waiting for a long time?
By evening should play 2 sets

1188
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:36,325
Has got little bit of
sugar and cholesterol

1189
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:38,823
It is under control but
we have to be careful - Eldo!

1190
01:32:39,153 --> 01:32:40,962
I had come, on knowing a news

1191
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:45,630
So, you had known that, no?
I was about to call sir

1192
01:32:45,993 --> 01:32:48,098
For what?
To discuss about our movie

1193
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:52,675
I wish to give 25%
of profit share to sir

1194
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,211
By the way there is
no reason to give like that

1195
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:57,542
I know sir won't ask me

1196
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,807
But still, sir I have a decency, no?

1197
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,113
With that movie you have
created a bad name for me -

1198
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,189
-which won't go in a life time!

1199
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,952
I won't allow you to make
money again by selling that movie

1200
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:10,822
This is the problem with this sir

1201
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:13,927
My sir what bad name
is there in movie field -

1202
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:15,293
- which can't be
removed by money?

1203
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:18,832
Look, I've conducted
a detailed marketing study

1204
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:20,835
'Shankarankutty wants a bride'

1205
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:23,271
'My tuition
teacher, the vehicle at 5:30'

1206
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:25,201
Earlier there were lot
of movies like this

1207
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:28,245
After that the 'Adyapapam'
(The first sin) got released, no?

1208
01:33:28,402 --> 01:33:30,211
During that time and after that

1209
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:33,215
I think it is by 2000 - 2002

1210
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,984
'Kinnarathubika? (Coquetting
dragon flies) 'Kathara'

1211
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:37,815
'Driving school', like
that many more came

1212
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:41,687
My God! My sir, how Sachin and
Sehwag scores run in cricket

1213
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:43,693
- Producers had made money

1214
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:47,694
As far as I know, this is the
right time for an adult content movie

1215
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:51,836
Along with the earlier inserted bits
and by adding new more items

1216
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:54,870
Shall we not
launch 'Paavada' (skirt)?

1217
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,707
Shall I go?

1218
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:07,677
Hey you fellow! - Come on, go sir you
think on it and do whatever you want

1219
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,648
Take the vehicle, man

1220
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:11,054
Okay sir

1221
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,349
Should file a case will
get the stay from district court

1222
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:16,922
I'll bring the best person to contest

1223
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:19,888
Then what is the use
of sir being a lawyer?

1224
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,829
Can't simply say I'm a lawyer
once in while should go to court!

1225
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:26,128
Like opening the cap of
a bottle its not easy to win a case

1226
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:30,366
If the old LLM rank
holder can't obtain a stay

1227
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:31,833
I'll bear it

1228
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,843
Will get the stay and all easily

1229
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:34,945
Then what is the problem?

1230
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:38,173
If a person can't attend his
own profession, he is not fit for it

1231
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,717
If a person is not updated,
he'll become out dated

1232
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:45,456
As a producer -

1233
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:50,990
- my client Babu Joseph has got
all the rights on movie 'Paavada'

1234
01:34:51,218 --> 01:34:54,131
Without his knowledge or permission

1235
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:57,700
The release of the above
mentioned movie, should be stayed

1236
01:34:57,925 --> 01:35:00,405
I humbly request
to the respected court

1237
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:06,812
Mr. Babu Joseph, I have got
only one thing to ask to you

1238
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:11,206
What is seen in this
stamp paper is it your signature?

1239
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:18,356
Isn't it?
I've not seen such an agreement

1240
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,852
That's not the
answer for my question

1241
01:35:20,981 --> 01:35:24,724
What I've asked is
whether it is your sign or not?

1242
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,956
Yes
Thank you

1243
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:33,104
Including the remake
of the movie 'Paavada'

1244
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:38,801
From now on all the right is given
to my client Eldo Kunanthanam

1245
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:40,411
By giving the surety

1246
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:45,047
This is the agreement is signed by
Babu Joseph, who is the plaintiff

1247
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,274
Shucks!

1248
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:50,821
One who has signed
on this stamp paper

1249
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:55,790
Babu Joseph has accepted
it is him, before the court

1250
01:35:56,217 --> 01:36:00,165
I expect there is no need of
further clarification on this case

1251
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:07,231
Shucks!

1252
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,243
Say something, what is it to do next?

1253
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:15,413
First of all if you have
signed on such a document-

1254
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:17,379
-you should have told me

1255
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:19,380
But for that I have
not signed on such a one

1256
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:21,814
Then how did that sign come?
Did it come by flying from top?

1257
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:23,547
Hey fellow Joy, truly I do not know

1258
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:27,348
Then is it some kind of fake sign?

1259
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:29,390
If the matter of such
an agreement is known

1260
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,893
Look lawyer, lwouldn't
have appeared for this case

1261
01:36:32,386 --> 01:36:37,386
<i>MW W“</i>

1262
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:46,936
I have not signed
in kind of agreement

1263
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:49,013
Someone please believe me

1264
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:53,048
We'll believe but the
court won't believe

1265
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:57,114
Sir, is there any other way?

1266
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:01,350
Don't expect again that the movie's
release can be blocked by getting stay

1267
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:05,088
Then some cinema association
should ban or make an issue

1268
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:09,394
But right now Eldo is a
big wig of cinema association

1269
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,897
So, no need to
have that expectation

1270
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:18,406
If some media people
make a controversy out of it

1271
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:20,341
We could have given an appeal

1272
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:22,812
For that is the media
people sitting on our lap?

1273
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:25,949
Sir, there is a media
person whom I know

1274
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:28,016
While telling this media people -

1275
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:30,213
- do you think he is the supplier
of the 'Mutholi' toddy shop

1276
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:31,982
I know what it is
on saying media and all

1277
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:35,490
On that day I was shown on TV
isn't it? The strike at beverages

1278
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:37,625
There is a boy who shot that thing

1279
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:39,496
What is the relation
between you and him?

1280
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,900
It is a relationship based on
pooling out money and brought a pint

1281
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:45,161
I've got his number on my mobile

1282
01:37:45,459 --> 01:37:47,939
Okay come on call him
Yeah call him

1283
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:55,237
As far as what is heard so far, there
is a good scope for a good story

1284
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:58,450
Can you arrange the details of the
crew members during that time?

1285
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,580
I know the names of
the main people

1286
01:38:01,909 --> 01:38:03,286
Don't know how they
are and where they are

1287
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:06,320
Not only the main crew
members, their assistants also

1288
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:09,289
Unit boys, can we at least get the
names of maximum people who -

1289
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:12,396
- associated with that
movie during that time?

1290
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,456
Sir, in the beginning of the movie -

1291
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,534
- lot of people's names will
be written and shown, no?

1292
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,498
That is correct shall we not
check the titles of the movie?

1293
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:23,642
For that it is not CD, it
is print which is kept at home

1294
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:26,672
Where can we put that and watch?
There is a way for that

1295
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:31,379
Ayappa!
Yeah, what is it? - Shall we start?

1296
01:38:31,538 --> 01:38:32,608
I'm ready

1297
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,913
Look that is the first one

1298
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:39,522
Sir, really tempting to
run the reel like this

1299
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:00,329
Ammfl
(Mother)

1300
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:12,216
Pillaicha enough
Ayappa, stop it

1301
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:20,422
On seeing the rest of the movie,
Joy will pluck out the heart of Eldo

1302
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:29,658
Sir, my mother had a
good grace, hadn't she?

1303
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:38,634
I know it won't happen
but still shall I ask a question?

1304
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,540
I know very well what
you are going to ask

1305
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:49,047
Not to release this
movie, I'll go to any extend

1306
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:52,586
If it is to go till Supreme
Court, okay to do that

1307
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:55,091
Even by selling everything
what I have

1308
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:57,189
Son, I'll do that

1309
01:40:58,519 --> 01:41:00,521
Boy, along with you
we are also there

1310
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:05,160
Till now I have seen this as a
story which has got a news value

1311
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,196
But now it is not the only'
problem of Joychan or Babu sir

1312
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:11,066
This is a moral issue

1313
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:15,310
Whether to win or
fail, I'm also there with you

1314
01:41:18,672 --> 01:41:20,583
Unit chief- Eldo sir is
a big person, now

1315
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:22,812
By making them hatred
can't survive over here sir

1316
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,121
Shall I go?

1317
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,449
Mess chief- It has been 10 to
15 years since stopped the -

1318
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:27,682
- mess job in cinema

1319
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:29,690
I just remember a
name 'Paavada' (skirt)

1320
01:41:29,883 --> 01:41:30,793
I keep forgetting the things

1321
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:33,722
Camera man - I was the camera
man of the movie,'railway track'

1322
01:41:33,887 --> 01:41:37,460
After the death of Chandra Mohan I
have not associated with that movie

1323
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:39,228
Later, it was shot by that Thangaraj

1324
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:40,832
He is dead

1325
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:43,400
Costumer - Even at that
time this Eldo was a cheat

1326
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,167
Do you know how much-

1327
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:47,072
- money is due for me stitching
costume for that movie?

1328
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:48,678
Junior Artist- Because of
acting in that movie -

1329
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:50,678
- do you know how
shameful it was for me?

1330
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:53,351
There is one associate director,
one mister Prasad, isn't it?

1331
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:55,847
Where is he now?
P.R.O - Yeah, the pimp Prasad

1332
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:59,282
He has left the movie, on an abuse
case he was jailed for some time

1333
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:01,083
Assistant Director - I was the
clap assistant in that movie

1334
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:04,353
Now by God's grace going
smoothly with one or two serials

1335
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:06,461
I'm not interested
for any kind of controversy

1336
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:12,268
On these comments
which you have taken -

1337
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:14,700
-there is no gun powder
to create a controversy

1338
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:19,700
If at all an opposite claim comes, it is
by giving money or on personal grudge

1339
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:21,378
These comments which
you have recorded -

1340
01:42:21,535 --> 01:42:22,639
- has got only the strength to perish

1341
01:42:22,903 --> 01:42:24,883
It is based on cinema and
cinema based programs -

1342
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:28,379
- over here every
channel survives on that

1343
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:31,249
If we attack a person
like Eldo in a baseless manner

1344
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:33,185
We'll have to face the
consequences of that

1345
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:34,450
But nothing of this is the problem -

1346
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:38,391
- if at all such a cheating has taken
place in a movie named 'Paavada' (skirt)

1347
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:42,723
The main victim, the prime victim
is the heroine named Cisily

1348
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:46,161
Where is she? She should
speak authentically on this?

1349
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:57,912
Sir, we do not know whether
Cisily is alive or not at present

1350
01:42:58,372 --> 01:43:00,249
Then how can this
program be convincing?

1351
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:03,281
I'm the son of that
lady, who is cheated

1352
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:05,584
Sir, won't it be possible
when I say that?

1353
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:07,951
In the place of salt,
a pickle won't be effective

1354
01:43:08,315 --> 01:43:11,660
I can understand the
sentiments of Joy

1355
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:13,763
Like that, that fire work also fails

1356
01:43:15,822 --> 01:43:17,927
But there is a loop hole on
this which you all have failed

1357
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:20,971
If the 'sleazy scenes' in
the movie 'Paavada' (skirt) -

1358
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:22,966
- is shot without the
knowledge of Cisily

1359
01:43:23,363 --> 01:43:25,502
Then there should be an actress
who had acted on it knowingly

1360
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:29,474
It need not be an actress,
a dupe with body without face

1361
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:34,275
The owner of that
body, whoever it may be

1362
01:43:34,675 --> 01:43:38,179
On coming here and if ready
to reveal what has happened

1363
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:42,289
Then the topic of next 'talk time' will
be back stage of 'Paavada' (skirt)

1364
01:43:43,817 --> 01:43:47,287
Sir, but for that whom is it to search?

1365
01:43:52,626 --> 01:43:54,799
For the girls who comes
to do dupe on 'A' movie

1366
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:56,702
There won't be makeup
on the face like this

1367
01:43:56,897 --> 01:44:00,401
Like painting on the wall, will
put a four coat putty on the face

1368
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:04,413
In between this who is going to
check on their whereabouts?

1369
01:44:05,272 --> 01:44:07,377
Brother do you know where
Manoharan Thevalli is now?

1370
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,281
Who was the still photographer
of that movie

1371
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:12,720
'Thevalli Studio' when the digital
photography came no one needs us

1372
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:16,554
The new guys just know to wear the
pants low showing the underwear

1373
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:20,664
Just take the camera and click,
the rest the computer will do it

1374
01:44:20,754 --> 01:44:23,496
All though there is no use, I have
not spoiled the old negatives

1375
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:24,830
That is at the house

1376
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:39,977
I've done still for hundred films,
now what is left behind is all this

1377
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:44,515
Yeah, got it, this is the person
whom you are looking for

1378
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:47,488
Now I remember very well, the
name is Sajini something like that

1379
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:50,855
My Sajini in which corner
of the world are you present?

1380
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:55,824
You may have it
Okay thanks - Okay then

1381
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:00,033
No, no not at all busy

1382
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:04,306
Okay you may tell, I'll come there

1383
01:45:13,607 --> 01:45:15,917
Sir, the presumption is
some where in Bison Valley

1384
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:17,044
We are on the way

1385
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:20,085
Immediately if we get the
person, we'll plan the show

1386
01:45:24,384 --> 01:45:27,058
As far as I know, there is no one in
the name Sajini, in the near by area

1387
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:29,094
Then who are staying here
who has come from outside

1388
01:45:29,556 --> 01:45:33,333
A widow and two daughters, they
are staying at the Southern hills

1389
01:45:34,494 --> 01:45:36,064
Brother, indeed a great help

1390
01:45:36,396 --> 01:45:37,602
Okay then

1391
01:45:37,864 --> 01:45:38,638
What you want there?

1392
01:45:38,765 --> 01:45:40,335
Good that you didn't
show the photo -

1393
01:45:40,467 --> 01:45:41,411
- might have asked
hundred questions

1394
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:42,636
-they are people from village, no?

1395
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:54,482
As far as what is
heard this is the house

1396
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:57,753
Lot of people have gathered there
Will go and enquire

1397
01:45:57,984 --> 01:46:00,487
What will you ask? Will you ask
whether it is the house of dupe, Sajini -

1398
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:01,859
- who has acted in 'A' movie?

1399
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,093
Sir, the photo is with us, no?
On seeing won't we know?

1400
01:46:04,424 --> 01:46:05,425
Correct, correct

1401
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:17,774
What is the celebration for'?
So, didn't you know anything?

1402
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:19,450
This girl has got the
admission for the medicine

1403
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:21,141
For the first time in this locality

1404
01:46:22,008 --> 01:46:24,989
Celinammo - Yeah
Panchayat president and others are coming

1405
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:26,816
Yeah, coming
Celinamma!

1406
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:28,822
May be on that name over here

1407
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:37,386
<i>MW W“</i>

1408
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:57,378
Just move back

1409
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:02,850
Celinamma, this is a
small gift from the panchayat

1410
01:47:03,116 --> 01:47:05,027
President, you may
give it to my daughter

1411
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:07,425
There is yet another gift and
family meet for the daughter

1412
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:10,693
This is a gift for the hardships which
Celinamma beard to bring up 2 kids

1413
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:15,439
Daughter here

1414
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:18,075
If you could sit inside
shall serve black tea

1415
01:47:24,037 --> 01:47:26,017
Couldn't recognise
We just"!

1416
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:30,654
Sister, we came looking for a person

1417
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:33,715
It was a different house

1418
01:47:38,518 --> 01:47:40,020
What is this?
Come, come

1419
01:47:41,555 --> 01:47:45,799
Come on walk
God has given her to us on our palm

1420
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:48,868
You have spoiled the
last chance for us to win

1421
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:55,941
While we win, sir one mother
and 2 father less kids fail in life

1422
01:47:56,770 --> 01:48:00,513
What is built on a tear
drop won't last long

1423
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:06,847
If we win like that, my
goodness that is not required

1424
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:11,023
People who accept failure
intentionally, they are great people

1425
01:48:12,018 --> 01:48:15,227
Son, before you we all are too small!

1426
01:48:15,922 --> 01:48:18,528
Shall I call Paul sir and
tell that show can't be done?

1427
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:24,665
It is Babu, calling to know what
has happened, what to say?

1428
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:27,869
That is... -Any how it has to be
informed, sir you may call and say it

1429
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:32,143
Hello -You don't come to Pala,
you come to studio at Ernakulam

1430
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:33,750
I'll be there
Okay

1431
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:36,920
Saying we should straight
away come to studio

1432
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:45,592
Please come

1433
01:48:46,653 --> 01:48:48,690
Babu, without
Sajini how is it possible?

1434
01:48:48,889 --> 01:48:51,733
When one way is
closed, opens 9 other ways

1435
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:53,561
You come my son, Joy

1436
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,030
You just come

1437
01:48:58,798 --> 01:48:59,902
Sir, you may sit here

1438
01:49:06,273 --> 01:49:08,275
Rajeev
Sir - I'm ready

1439
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:14,751
Greetings and welcome to
your favourite show, 'talk time'

1440
01:49:15,015 --> 01:49:17,962
The history of human
beings and sex

1441
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:20,529
That is started right
from the days of 'Adam'

1442
01:49:20,754 --> 01:49:24,998
From 'Valsiayanan' to 'Freud, Yung,
Collin Wilson and Destin Morris'

1443
01:49:25,158 --> 01:49:29,038
Has studied the basic character
of human beings closely, but

1444
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:33,769
About Malayalee's pretentious
morality and on lust starving

1445
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,810
Again there should
be serious studies

1446
01:49:36,937 --> 01:49:40,851
To vent out the lustful feelings in this
cyber era there are hundred ways

1447
01:49:40,974 --> 01:49:43,250
There is an old generation
that is remaining here

1448
01:49:43,376 --> 01:49:45,014
To watch the movies
with 'A' certificate

1449
01:49:45,278 --> 01:49:48,623
An old generation who peeps, hides
and by covering the face with cloth

1450
01:49:48,715 --> 01:49:50,820
They have come to
theatre to watch the movie

1451
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:53,031
The movie 'Paavada'
which is known to them -

1452
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:55,291
- is now reloaded to
a new generation era

1453
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:56,329
Along with it some controversies

1454
01:49:56,623 --> 01:49:58,728
Behind the movie 'Paavada'
there are certain facts of cheating

1455
01:49:58,892 --> 01:49:59,370
That is not known to any one

1456
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:02,731
This episode of talk time
narrates on the fabric of 'cheating'

1457
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:05,603
Before welcoming today's
guest, there is a small break

1458
01:50:10,337 --> 01:50:11,975
You may call the guest
Okay sir

1459
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:22,444
<i>MW W“</i>

1460
01:51:11,464 --> 01:51:12,738
Mother!

1461
01:51:28,314 --> 01:51:31,420
On that day, don't you remember
that I went on a journey?

1462
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:36,225
When Joy is in need of
an urgency, I'll be there

1463
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:52,413
Neither Sini knew that Cisily is your
mother nor Cisily knew Sini is your wife

1464
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:59,116
While chatting in a casual way,
Sini told about our matters to Cisily

1465
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:01,392
Like that when they continued
talking one after the other -

1466
01:52:01,815 --> 01:52:03,795
- both had a doubt

1467
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,862
While we were returning from
'Thevalli Manoharan's' home

1468
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:11,364
It was Sini who had called me

1469
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:13,134
To tell all this to me
Okay then

1470
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:15,134
Okay then thanks
Okay

1471
01:52:29,943 --> 01:52:32,947
Welcome back to 'talk time'
for the majority of the viewers -

1472
01:52:33,146 --> 01:52:35,148
- our todays guest will be a stranger

1473
01:52:35,348 --> 01:52:36,884
Madam, Cisily Varghese

1474
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:40,222
Earlier which was released, now
again getting ready to be reloaded

1475
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:43,059
One and only introduction will be
enough, she is the heroine of 'Paavada'

1476
01:52:43,223 --> 01:52:45,931
To know the relevance of
welcoming a person who isn't famous

1477
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:47,298
On this show

1478
01:52:47,494 --> 01:52:49,064
Cisily sister greetings

1479
01:52:50,864 --> 01:52:53,276
Now do you think to act
in an adult movie 'Paavada'

1480
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:56,141
Was it a haste decision
of young age?

1481
01:52:56,536 --> 01:53:00,951
I've acted in a movie which was
called' Theevandi Patha' (railway track)

1482
01:53:02,342 --> 01:53:05,323
It was not a movie like
what sir has mentioned

1483
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:09,153
The Cisily who was a drama actress
how did she become a movie actress?

1484
01:53:09,349 --> 01:53:10,987
The actress who has acted in
'Theevandi Patha' (railway track)

1485
01:53:11,184 --> 01:53:13,027
How did she become the
heroine of 'Paavada?

1486
01:53:13,219 --> 01:53:15,995
As several producers disdained this
movie, saying its an award movie

1487
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:17,259
How did it become an 'adult movie?'

1488
01:53:17,457 --> 01:53:19,494
For the answers to
several questions like this

1489
01:53:19,893 --> 01:53:22,305
We can lend our ears to
the words of Cisily Varghese

1490
01:53:22,462 --> 01:53:25,773
Please tell, how did 'Theevandi
Patha' become 'Paavada?

1491
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:46,888
In the magical world of cinema

1492
01:53:47,053 --> 01:53:49,294
Among the thousand stories of
behind stage which happens

1493
01:53:49,422 --> 01:53:52,266
This is only one among them,
among the several victims

1494
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:53,835
Cisily Varghese is one of the victim

1495
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:57,600
Again to create an 'adult wave'
'Paavada' is going to be a pilot vechile

1496
01:53:57,997 --> 01:54:00,910
Sister, for the last time,
what have you got to say?

1497
01:54:01,201 --> 01:54:06,082
Because of acting on
a movie, I lost my family

1498
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:11,286
I don't have the
respect of a street slut

1499
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:19,453
Where ever I go,
people drive me off

1500
01:54:21,254 --> 01:54:25,600
When people watch
the movie inside the theatre

1501
01:54:26,259 --> 01:54:29,570
To live was in search of a job

1502
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:33,543
I was begging for it

1503
01:54:37,303 --> 01:54:40,580
If such a situation has happened
for a person in your family

1504
01:54:41,674 --> 01:54:44,655
Will anyone watch that and enjoy it?

1505
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:52,127
Since what god has given
has got no right to destroy it

1506
01:54:52,652 --> 01:54:55,462
That is why I didn't commit suicide

1507
01:54:58,625 --> 01:55:02,095
I don't know to say big, big things

1508
01:55:03,463 --> 01:55:11,507
But I know everyone has got a
mother who has delivered with pain

1509
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:18,049
I'm also a mother like that!

1510
01:55:22,348 --> 01:55:25,522
To everyone I have only a request

1511
01:55:28,488 --> 01:55:31,435
Please don't re-release that movie!

1512
01:55:33,526 --> 01:55:36,166
I've got a matured son

1513
01:55:39,365 --> 01:55:45,111
Stripping own mother's cloths, that
shouldn't be shown to any son!

1514
01:55:46,372 --> 01:55:48,181
Never show it!

1515
01:55:49,509 --> 01:55:53,514
That is not me
That is not me

1516
01:56:05,725 --> 01:56:06,931
Mother!

1517
01:56:15,134 --> 01:56:18,547
It is the request of a mother

1518
01:56:20,606 --> 01:56:23,018
Don't show that to my son

1519
01:56:24,377 --> 01:56:25,515
Don't show it

1520
01:56:38,257 --> 01:56:39,235
Mother!

1521
01:57:00,446 --> 01:57:03,620
San!
My Son!

1522
01:57:24,137 --> 01:57:27,118
What we have heard is the
cry of a mother who is Cisily but

1523
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:29,718
As we have got memory
that of a lizard

1524
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:33,024
Tomorrow will we become big
wigs on the walls with adult content?

1525
01:57:33,212 --> 01:57:36,284
On the wall of urine shed will write
the mobile number of female colleague

1526
01:57:36,482 --> 01:57:39,622
Will mark on the nude
photo of the class mate

1527
01:57:39,786 --> 01:57:42,790
On our mobile and on our
memory card it is the flowers of sex

1528
01:57:43,156 --> 01:57:45,295
Again it will blossom,
all though it is like this

1529
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:47,768
On few humanity is not lost

1530
01:57:48,094 --> 01:57:50,574
On few people the words told
by this lady will remain as a grief

1531
01:57:50,696 --> 01:57:52,539
In the court of
human consciousness -

1532
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:55,372
- expecting will write a verdict
favouring Cisily Varghese

1533
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:58,048
This weeks 'talk time'
comes to an end, good bye

1534
01:58:01,274 --> 01:58:05,245
Paul Zakaria has given a storm, now
we can move boldly to High Court

1535
01:58:05,711 --> 01:58:08,282
With the one statement of
Cisily, the play is going to change

1536
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:11,456
That is all okay but who will argue?

1537
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:16,200
No need of anyone, I have
given my coat for dry cleaning

1538
01:58:24,697 --> 01:58:26,802
Hello
Had seen the program on TV

1539
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:32,741
Great as that program was a hit,
our cinema will receive a good mileage

1540
01:58:33,206 --> 01:58:36,380
I saved the Iakhs which was
kept behind for the promotion

1541
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:40,089
Then by the way I've arranged a
new lawyer at the High Court, okay

1542
01:58:40,379 --> 01:58:43,588
He is bit expensive but never mind
Advocate Anantha Rama Iyer

1543
01:58:43,816 --> 01:58:47,423
Hey you filth!
One Eldo Kunanthanam

1544
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:50,200
You go and
arrange Fali Nariman

1545
01:58:50,389 --> 01:58:52,369
Or bring Phalkiwala who is dead

1546
01:58:52,525 --> 01:58:56,701
He and his 'Konantha Raman'
Cut the phone you rascal

1547
01:58:58,731 --> 01:59:04,738
By the way lawyer, I just
scolded him for a show off

1548
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:07,214
Won't we win at least this case?

1549
01:59:08,407 --> 01:59:11,445
Sir, this time we'll win

1550
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,916
We must win at any cost

1551
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:23,559
Your owner

1552
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:27,635
Once upon a time in the Malayalam
movies released outside cities

1553
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:31,138
Like this the tendency to add
adult scenes were widely spread

1554
01:59:31,797 --> 01:59:37,839
Similar cases had reached the court
in Hindi, Tamil movies recently

1555
01:59:38,204 --> 01:59:41,708
What has happened is a violation of
human rights in Cisily Varghese's case

1556
01:59:41,874 --> 01:59:44,548
That is explicitly seen
in the first sight itself

1557
01:59:44,744 --> 01:59:47,850
The ill fate of 'Panchali' who
was publicly stripped off

1558
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:50,324
If that is hunting on
a lady in this generation

1559
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:52,757
Our society should be
ashamed and lower its head

1560
01:59:52,952 --> 01:59:55,831
There fore to curb the release
of third rate film 'Paavada' (Skirt)

1561
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:59,466
To ban the release humbly
requests the court to issue a verdict

1562
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:01,434
At the earliest

1563
02:00:27,954 --> 02:00:31,766
My Lord, the speeches of
renowned late SukumarAzhikode

1564
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:34,369
Many have described
it as a roar of ocean

1565
02:00:34,527 --> 02:00:37,736
But the verbal argument
of Mr. Gunashekaran was"

1566
02:00:39,665 --> 02:00:42,373
A diarrhoea of meaning less words

1567
02:00:42,868 --> 02:00:45,405
I know he'll be tired
because of it yet

1568
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:47,643
I've to ask and find
certain things from him

1569
02:00:48,841 --> 02:00:50,479
Requesting to grand
me the permission

1570
02:00:51,477 --> 02:00:54,458
Why is that? Did you get scared?
I don't fear anyone

1571
02:00:54,647 --> 02:00:57,025
Even the court?
I fear that

1572
02:00:57,416 --> 02:00:59,726
Towards the court it is not fear
which is required, respect is required

1573
02:00:59,952 --> 02:01:01,397
Those who fear the
law, will fear the truth also

1574
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,830
Your owner he is mis
interpreting the words

1575
02:01:04,023 --> 02:01:05,661
I have no fear to tell the truth

1576
02:01:12,531 --> 02:01:16,035
What is the name? - Gunashekaran
How? - Gunashekaran

1577
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:17,939
Have we met before?

1578
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:21,045
Yeah - How?
For few years I was sir's junior

1579
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:23,718
And after some time?
Told not to stay along with you

1580
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:26,048
For what reason?
Couldn't appear for a case

1581
02:01:26,846 --> 02:01:27,654
My Lord

1582
02:01:28,014 --> 02:01:30,392
As a very junior advocate
K. Gunshekaran Nair -

1583
02:01:30,483 --> 02:01:31,689
- had to appear for
an important case

1584
02:01:31,851 --> 02:01:34,058
On knowing he was drunk
and ended up in a brawl

1585
02:01:34,453 --> 02:01:37,366
His senior advocate Anantha
Rama Iyerterminated his service

1586
02:01:37,556 --> 02:01:39,058
Which is this me,
can you deny that?

1587
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:43,338
Your owner, he is asking personal
questions which is irrelevant to this case

1588
02:01:43,496 --> 02:01:45,703
On that day's brawl, on cross
examining the other accused

1589
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:48,845
The respected court will
understand it is not personal alone

1590
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,639
His name is Babu Joseph

1591
02:01:58,377 --> 02:02:00,948
So, you are a professor aren't you?
I was

1592
02:02:01,347 --> 02:02:03,657
You were, that is a past tense

1593
02:02:03,849 --> 02:02:05,726
That means right now
you are not a professor

1594
02:02:05,985 --> 02:02:08,056
Did you retire or
were you dismissed?

1595
02:02:08,587 --> 02:02:10,498
Can say both has taken place
Reason?

1596
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:14,733
Couldn't adjust with the
ideology of the management

1597
02:02:16,095 --> 02:02:19,042
Coming to class drunk,
verbally abusing the students

1598
02:02:19,432 --> 02:02:20,911
To drench the PTI
committee in foul words

1599
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,706
if the ideology is like that, it is quite
natural that problems will arise

1600
02:02:23,869 --> 02:02:25,815
I have not gone to
class by drinking liquor

1601
02:02:25,938 --> 02:02:29,044
Has not gone to class by drinking
liquor, what about now at the court?

1602
02:02:30,643 --> 02:02:32,418
Come on tell are you drunk now?

1603
02:02:33,112 --> 02:02:36,787
My Lord, if that blowing machine
is kept one and a half mile away

1604
02:02:36,949 --> 02:02:38,451
Because of this
smell, its filament will get faulty

1605
02:02:38,784 --> 02:02:40,491
Then how can you deny that, no?

1606
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:44,593
My Lord the accused in
this case Ms. Cisily Varghese

1607
02:02:44,757 --> 02:02:47,033
Requesting the permission
to cross examine her

1608
02:03:15,054 --> 02:03:19,161
Cisily mam, what had happened to
you? Now sitting with a waist band?

1609
02:03:23,763 --> 02:03:25,970
You aren't that much old to fall down

1610
02:03:26,165 --> 02:03:28,076
Then how did you manage
to get this one?

1611
02:03:31,804 --> 02:03:34,648
Suddenly felt the head was spinning

1612
02:03:35,207 --> 02:03:38,450
On regaining the consciousness
I was at the hospital

1613
02:03:39,812 --> 02:03:41,917
I don't remember anything else
Doesn't remember?

1614
02:03:42,681 --> 02:03:44,592
Won't rem em ber that is the problem

1615
02:03:46,185 --> 02:03:48,529
By the way did you
fall in recent years?

1616
02:03:48,721 --> 02:03:50,428
Before that what was the sickness?

1617
02:03:50,623 --> 02:03:53,832
There was only a
slight trouble with Arthritis

1618
02:03:54,026 --> 02:03:56,939
This numbness,
joint pain, losing the strength

1619
02:03:57,096 --> 02:04:01,511
Glass and spoon fall from the hand,
only a slight problem like that, no?

1620
02:04:02,134 --> 02:04:02,669
Yeah

1621
02:04:02,868 --> 02:04:06,008
Then why did you consult a neuro
specialist one and a half year back?

1622
02:04:06,472 --> 02:04:08,509
What?
Come on tell

1623
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:12,851
I didn't..Anyone..

1624
02:04:13,546 --> 02:04:17,995
Yeah when there was a medical
camp near'Sharanalayam'

1625
02:04:18,851 --> 02:04:20,762
Had consulted a doctor

1626
02:04:22,021 --> 02:04:25,662
I don't know the name - Its not you
don't know the name, you don't remember

1627
02:04:25,825 --> 02:04:27,862
You should say you
don't remember it

1628
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:31,038
Consulted doctor was
Dr. Madhusudanan

1629
02:04:31,163 --> 02:04:34,110
He isn't a physician forArthritis to
cure it by applying medicated oil

1630
02:04:34,467 --> 02:04:37,846
Dr. Madhusudanan who is
a neuro specialist, at that time -

1631
02:04:38,003 --> 02:04:40,142
- had prescribed many medicines
for memory loss to Cisily

1632
02:04:40,739 --> 02:04:43,242
For the memory loss
disease named 'Dementia'

1633
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:51,557
It has got various variations,
a well known disease

1634
02:04:51,884 --> 02:04:54,228
What Cisily Varghese has
told is signs of Arthritis

1635
02:04:54,587 --> 02:04:56,726
Many among them is the
classical symptoms of Dementia

1636
02:04:56,922 --> 02:04:59,061
In a place where it was not
slippery, she had fallen down

1637
02:04:59,258 --> 02:05:00,669
It was not because of anything else

1638
02:05:03,195 --> 02:05:05,937
In any condition of Dementia,
a sick person's statement -

1639
02:05:06,098 --> 02:05:07,941
- will not be valid
before a court of law

1640
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:10,478
I'm reminding the respected court

1641
02:05:13,939 --> 02:05:15,646
This is like making a goat into dog

1642
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,218
Mister, who is playing
the gimmick here?

1643
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:19,285
Three decades back
had acted in an adult movie

1644
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:20,817
Without saying anything
took the money and left

1645
02:05:21,046 --> 02:05:22,081
Those people didn't have the
complaint and shame at that time

1646
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:23,555
How did it occur right now?

1647
02:05:23,782 --> 02:05:26,820
A person who doesn't have memory
to swallow that people who are -

1648
02:05:27,052 --> 02:05:28,531
- sitting here aren't idiots

1649
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:36,139
Haven't you told that you
don't remember the name of-

1650
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:37,569
- doctor whom you met?

1651
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:39,038
Do you remember the
name of the hospital?

1652
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:40,602
No

1653
02:05:46,038 --> 02:05:51,038
<i>MW W“</i>

1654
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:27,915
My Lord, people who have no
integrity in personal life

1655
02:06:28,047 --> 02:06:32,154
To make easy money, certain
people have fabricated this third rate trick

1656
02:06:32,384 --> 02:06:35,558
When shame arises all of a
sudden which was not there before

1657
02:06:35,788 --> 02:06:37,665
What reminds me is
that of an old proverb

1658
02:06:38,057 --> 02:06:40,003
The speech of a
prostitute on virginity

1659
02:06:40,292 --> 02:06:44,138
My Lord, against my client, the
opposition couldn't prove anything

1660
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:46,276
That is legally strong

1661
02:06:46,632 --> 02:06:48,942
Because of that kindly
remove the un wanted hurdles

1662
02:06:49,168 --> 02:06:50,806
For my client Eldo Kunanthanam

1663
02:06:51,036 --> 02:06:54,074
Kindly protect his legal rights to
release his movie, 'Paavada'

1664
02:06:54,206 --> 02:06:57,983
That is all what I have to
address to the respected court

1665
02:07:00,646 --> 02:07:02,353
Man, how is that guy?
Isn't he a tiger?

1666
02:07:17,763 --> 02:07:22,371
To give the verdict the case
is postponed to next 16th

1667
02:07:27,172 --> 02:07:29,049
I felt like laughing while sitting there

1668
02:07:29,975 --> 02:07:31,852
Sir, the kind of questions you ask

1669
02:07:33,979 --> 02:07:37,950
Shucks! You are still the same
old use less Gunashekaran!

1670
02:07:38,117 --> 02:07:39,289
What a pity

1671
02:07:41,754 --> 02:07:46,635
Yeah, hello we'll win the case coolly

1672
02:07:46,792 --> 02:07:54,176
Then the main parts of the heroine
should be clearly seen on the poster

1673
02:07:54,366 --> 02:07:57,745
On seeing that poster even the
blind should come to the theatre!

1674
02:07:57,936 --> 02:08:03,045
Then add those kind of 'sexy' sound
effects in the background music

1675
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:05,017
Fellow, people should
come to theatre running

1676
02:08:05,210 --> 02:08:06,883
Only then we can make money

1677
02:08:21,727 --> 02:08:23,832
Now on every board
and walls that is seen -

1678
02:08:24,797 --> 02:08:27,368
- now on there will be
picture of my mother, sir!

1679
02:08:28,834 --> 02:08:32,111
Better than to see
that, it is better to die, isn't it?

1680
02:08:34,006 --> 02:08:35,747
I'm the one who should die

1681
02:08:36,775 --> 02:08:39,722
The reason for everything
is my bloody drinking habits!

1682
02:08:40,879 --> 02:08:43,120
The court which should
stand for the truth -

1683
02:08:43,515 --> 02:08:45,461
- right now doesn't
believe my words!

1684
02:08:45,918 --> 02:08:48,398
A drinker doesn't obtain justice,
law, doesn't have integrity -

1685
02:08:48,754 --> 02:08:50,165
- even doesn't get the
dignity of a stinking dog!

1686
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:51,392
Keep the voice down

1687
02:08:52,758 --> 02:08:55,136
I'm fed up of this filthy life!

1688
02:08:56,028 --> 02:08:59,407
Sir, what is inside the
heart of these judges?

1689
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:01,405
Is it granite or something?

1690
02:09:02,167 --> 02:09:05,740
Why is no one seeing us when
we cry out plucking our heart?

1691
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:10,987
Why is that, there is
no value at all for our cry?

1692
02:09:13,812 --> 02:09:17,521
Not only for the tears of a drunkard
neither his life has got any value!

1693
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:20,797
No one gives any value on
what he says and what he does

1694
02:09:24,056 --> 02:09:25,501
Hey Joy!

1695
02:09:27,326 --> 02:09:32,105
Okay leave it son, son go
and wash your face and come

1696
02:09:32,264 --> 02:09:33,902
Come on son, go

1697
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:41,840
Joy, I came to know
about the case and all

1698
02:09:42,207 --> 02:09:43,311
Leave it man -

1699
02:09:43,542 --> 02:09:46,455
-the problem happened when
Babu sir signed on that paper

1700
02:09:46,578 --> 02:09:49,320
At least now tell to
sir to stop this drinking habit

1701
02:10:16,875 --> 02:10:20,220
Before declaring the verdict is there
anything that the plaintiff has to say?

1702
02:10:23,415 --> 02:10:26,555
Your owner, on this case the most
relevant point, is the agreement-

1703
02:10:26,919 --> 02:10:30,389
- which Prof. Babu Joseph has signed
and given to Eldo Kunnanthanam

1704
02:10:30,956 --> 02:10:32,367
Kindly requesting to -

1705
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:35,199
- give the permission to Babu
Joseph to speak on it

1706
02:10:39,598 --> 02:10:43,011
My Lord, a person who converts
a bar to a home, a home to bar

1707
02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:47,947
I'm sure that court will give only such
importance to the words of an alcoholic!

1708
02:10:53,412 --> 02:10:58,589
Long back Brutus has described
Ceaser with a word 'ambitious'

1709
02:10:59,151 --> 02:11:02,564
Respected Iyer sir is describing
me with a word 'alcoholic'

1710
02:11:03,889 --> 02:11:05,596
Which is hundred and
one percent correct

1711
02:11:09,494 --> 02:11:11,997
To make his statement more strong

1712
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:16,044
I kindly request to examine
some more witness statements

1713
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:44,003
To express the alcoholic endeavours
of a person who has lost his mind

1714
02:11:44,162 --> 02:11:47,041
The respected court shouldn't
spend more time on such activities

1715
02:11:47,266 --> 02:11:52,011
Your owner, the movie' 'Paavada'
if it is released again

1716
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:57,381
It is not because of the personal bad
name, which is my prime concern

1717
02:11:59,278 --> 02:12:03,226
It is the amount of dis respect inflicted
on the respect of a lady Cisily Varghese

1718
02:12:03,548 --> 02:12:05,926
That is the smouldering
problem before me

1719
02:12:06,285 --> 02:12:10,324
It is the same problem for anyone,
who has got a good consciousness

1720
02:12:12,024 --> 02:12:14,664
Cisily Varghese is also a mother

1721
02:12:16,261 --> 02:12:18,036
The respect of own mother -

1722
02:12:18,263 --> 02:12:21,244
- who gave birth, her respect
is dragged on the streets

1723
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,607
A son's..That persons..To see that!

1724
02:12:24,202 --> 02:12:31,313
Kindly lent ears to his words, I
request respected court to show mercy

1725
02:12:32,177 --> 02:12:37,177
<i>MBRHDRG“</i>

1726
02:12:50,996 --> 02:12:53,533
My Lord, don't think I'm intervening

1727
02:12:54,266 --> 02:12:56,712
The court is not a place
to stage a drama by those -

1728
02:12:57,069 --> 02:12:58,207
- people who has lost their minds

1729
02:12:58,337 --> 02:13:00,248
That is my stand I
remain firm on that

1730
02:13:00,372 --> 02:13:05,253
Sir, you should be firm on it, what
you said Babu sir is out of mind

1731
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:07,321
Being out of mind,
is not an appreciation

1732
02:13:07,779 --> 02:13:09,349
Young boy if a Banyan tree
is sprouted at the back -

1733
02:13:09,548 --> 02:13:12,722
- seeing it as a shelter,
it is a sign of shame

1734
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:15,962
Babu sir has chopped
off that tree of shame

1735
02:13:16,154 --> 02:13:17,633
Sir, he has stopped drinking liquor

1736
02:13:18,023 --> 02:13:20,060
The point of debate is
not whether 'Paavada Babu' -

1737
02:13:20,192 --> 02:13:21,728
has stopped drinking or
not, or has he come a saint!

1738
02:13:22,094 --> 02:13:23,300
Young man, come to the matter

1739
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:26,341
'Paavada Babu' has he become
a saint, or when he dies will the -

1740
02:13:26,498 --> 02:13:29,411
- corpse decay or after
dying will the soul reach heaven?

1741
02:13:29,534 --> 02:13:31,741
I know none of this is
the point of argument over here

1742
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:36,676
But he has got a history
which is like 'pickled in arrack'

1743
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:38,713
Sir, that is a real matter

1744
02:13:39,211 --> 02:13:42,385
It is only out of the strength of an
agreement which Babu sir has signed

1745
02:13:42,547 --> 02:13:44,584
Eldo sir has come out
with a 'Paavada' (Skirt)

1746
02:13:44,783 --> 02:13:46,524
Which was on the
attic for the reloading

1747
02:13:46,685 --> 02:13:48,187
Sir, has told since my mother
has got memory loss disease

1748
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:50,732
Do not give any value
to what she says

1749
02:13:52,024 --> 02:13:53,435
If that is the case

1750
02:13:53,625 --> 02:13:55,366
A drunkard who has
completely lost his mind

1751
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:57,665
On a signature, which he has
put when he was out of mind

1752
02:13:57,796 --> 02:13:59,275
Sir, what value should be granted?

1753
02:14:00,465 --> 02:14:04,242
In big big hotels, there is a
tissue paper kept at the toilet

1754
02:14:04,403 --> 02:14:06,349
That agreement has
got only that value!

1755
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:10,583
Can't simply say that the signed
person was out of his mind -

1756
02:14:10,776 --> 02:14:12,653
- and agreement has got no value

1757
02:14:12,844 --> 02:14:14,517
What is required is evidence

1758
02:14:14,646 --> 02:14:17,786
Right from eatery owner Kunjumon
to bar manager, what they have told

1759
02:14:18,116 --> 02:14:19,789
Sir, other than evidence
what else is it sir'?

1760
02:14:20,152 --> 02:14:22,689
Is it some kind of decoration which
is arrayed during festival at Pala church?

1761
02:14:22,854 --> 02:14:24,162
Now, if none of these aren't enough

1762
02:14:24,356 --> 02:14:25,835
There is a certificate of treatment
which father Kattuparambil -

1763
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:28,069
- has administered on Babu sir

1764
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:29,637
With the lawyer sir

1765
02:14:30,562 --> 02:14:33,441
Where is it? Show it
No, won't give in the hand

1766
02:14:33,632 --> 02:14:35,805
There is a history earlier, when
lawyer at Maloor swallowed the bullet

1767
02:14:36,101 --> 02:14:37,205
That case was won

1768
02:14:37,402 --> 02:14:39,712
The evidence will be handed over
to people who has got clear mind

1769
02:14:42,774 --> 02:14:45,778
This is a third rate trick
to twist the facts

1770
02:14:46,211 --> 02:14:48,623
Sir, the truth can't be easily
twisted and made to break

1771
02:14:49,481 --> 02:14:52,587
I came to know that
at the 'Thatumpuram' bar

1772
02:14:53,218 --> 02:14:57,223
If you could grand me the time to tell
that, everyone will understand it

1773
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:14,851
The problem happened since
Babu sir signed on that paper

1774
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:19,548
My God!

1775
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:25,191
Right now water got inside
through the nose and mouth -

1776
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:28,695
- come on tell or else I'll
pump water through the nine holes!

1777
02:15:28,887 --> 02:15:30,867
I'll tell
I'll tell

1778
02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:33,462
Look this is 25,000
Sir

1779
02:15:33,592 --> 02:15:36,869
When you come with the sign on
the document, shall give balance 75,000

1780
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:40,540
As the account at the bar is
settled at the end of the month

1781
02:15:40,799 --> 02:15:44,303
The bill is signed by Babu
sir every day, that is the routine

1782
02:15:46,905 --> 02:15:48,714
Sir, bill!

1783
02:15:49,341 --> 02:15:50,342
Sign on it!

1784
02:15:53,912 --> 02:15:56,392
Then one day when he
was drunk to the core

1785
02:15:56,548 --> 02:15:59,859
I've collected the sign on the stamp
paper that was given by them

1786
02:16:01,753 --> 02:16:02,754
Sign!

1787
02:16:05,757 --> 02:16:09,728
I knew it is cheating but
on hearing one Iakh rupees

1788
02:16:10,362 --> 02:16:13,275
Sir, it has happened
That's not your problem Suniappa!

1789
02:16:13,465 --> 02:16:16,309
You were born five years earlier,
before you had a father!

1790
02:16:16,468 --> 02:16:18,470
In the real sense it
is called as a bastard

1791
02:16:18,603 --> 02:16:20,913
Just finish off this pig!
No, no need, leave

1792
02:16:22,741 --> 02:16:25,415
After all he has poured
alcohol for a long time, isn't it?

1793
02:16:25,911 --> 02:16:28,619
Before you get whacks from
him, get up and get lost you fellow!

1794
02:16:28,813 --> 02:16:30,656
Sir, it happened like that, pardon me

1795
02:16:30,815 --> 02:16:32,624
Where ever you
want, I'll openly say it

1796
02:16:32,951 --> 02:16:36,421
Pardon me sir, I'll openly
say it where ever you want

1797
02:16:36,688 --> 02:16:39,191
Pardon me sir, pardon me

1798
02:16:39,391 --> 02:16:41,837
What is said, is it true?
Yes, it is true sir

1799
02:16:55,006 --> 02:16:58,215
I'm not that much
intelligent or educated

1800
02:16:58,677 --> 02:17:01,749
But since there are lot of
people who has got all that

1801
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:04,517
There are lot of people
who get ruined because of it

1802
02:17:04,783 --> 02:17:09,198
Babu sir and my mother are
belonging to that category

1803
02:17:10,388 --> 02:17:15,804
When my father 'Kallu Varkey' died
my mother couldn't attend the funeral

1804
02:17:17,729 --> 02:17:20,676
Behind the grave, my mother was
peeping out from the bushes

1805
02:17:20,832 --> 02:17:23,210
So that, she isn't noticed by anyone

1806
02:17:23,702 --> 02:17:25,704
That was the last time
since I saw her

1807
02:17:26,738 --> 02:17:29,651
I was sure that my mother
won't come searching for me

1808
02:17:30,475 --> 02:17:33,945
Thinking, that foul name
shouldn't affect my life

1809
02:17:34,412 --> 02:17:36,653
Sir, kept away from me intentionally

1810
02:17:38,817 --> 02:17:44,699
After long time, sir now
only I got back my mother

1811
02:17:46,825 --> 02:17:50,602
Now, again don't push
off my mother to shame!

1812
02:17:51,596 --> 02:17:55,669
After pushing her down and
again coming to stampede on her!

1813
02:17:56,534 --> 02:17:59,811
For the help less ones, Lord is
the only one who is there to help

1814
02:18:00,405 --> 02:18:04,820
But the Lord won't come down, no?

1815
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:11,861
Because of that, I find
court in that position!

1816
02:18:13,885 --> 02:18:18,698
Sir, I won't allow anyone
to degrade my mother in shame

1817
02:18:20,725 --> 02:18:28,610
Kindly don't disdain us,
sir please don't disdain us!

1818
02:18:42,447 --> 02:18:45,519
The permission to
relaunch the movie 'Paavada'

1819
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:49,323
Eldo Kunnanthanam has
not gained it in proper way

1820
02:18:49,554 --> 02:18:51,795
That truth is understood by the court

1821
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:56,905
All the rights on the mentioned
movie will be secured to Babu Joseph

1822
02:18:57,062 --> 02:18:59,565
Without his knowledge or permission

1823
02:18:59,764 --> 02:19:04,440
Any effort to relaunch this movie
that will be against the law

1824
02:19:04,602 --> 02:19:06,912
Here by this court
declares the verdict

1825
02:19:23,054 --> 02:19:24,897
Eldo sir!
Sir!

1826
02:19:26,057 --> 02:19:29,470
Regarding the case, sir
you don't feel hatred towards us

1827
02:19:29,661 --> 02:19:33,404
I had to say yet another
matter personally to sir

1828
02:19:33,631 --> 02:19:37,443
Just one minute, sir had come
to movie field before I was born

1829
02:19:37,635 --> 02:19:41,139
I watch movies other than that
I do not know how it is made

1830
02:19:41,573 --> 02:19:45,419
Yet with the little know how I have
written a script and kept it ready

1831
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:48,887
For the sample, just hear one
scene and tell the opinion, sir

1832
02:19:49,013 --> 02:19:50,993
Hey boy, how is that, today?
Sir, don't say can't..

1833
02:19:51,149 --> 02:19:52,628
It is my request

1834
02:19:52,817 --> 02:19:57,095
On this scene what we are going to
show is, flying balls through the eyes!

1835
02:19:57,422 --> 02:20:00,596
That will be all most like this

1836
02:20:08,199 --> 02:20:09,803
If I don't do this much

1837
02:20:10,001 --> 02:20:12,140
I'll become as if
I'm not born to a mother!

1838
02:20:14,205 --> 02:20:16,116
Boy, did you break the egg shop?

1839
02:20:16,508 --> 02:20:18,852
What is there if it is broken, its
the name for Eldo's next movie

1840
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:20,648
What is it?
'Bulls Eye'

1841
02:20:31,623 --> 02:20:34,001
I had to say a decision

1842
02:20:34,692 --> 02:20:37,639
Mother has told, you
had stopped drinking

1843
02:20:38,963 --> 02:20:43,139
It is not what mother or mother in law
has told, I'm going to say my decision

1844
02:20:45,136 --> 02:20:47,082
All though even after you
walked off out of obstinacy -

1845
02:20:47,505 --> 02:20:49,542
-you have done lot of help to me

1846
02:20:50,008 --> 02:20:52,887
Since you left like
that, I got back my mother

1847
02:20:55,046 --> 02:21:00,018
But you are the one, who left after
breaking fish pot on my head

1848
02:21:02,454 --> 02:21:08,200
For that If I don't beat back, what
is the use of me being a male?

1849
02:21:10,595 --> 02:21:14,873
Have you not gone home yet?
The story isn't finished telling

1850
02:21:15,099 --> 02:21:16,942
Then tell that fast

1851
02:21:17,101 --> 02:21:20,742
Then what?
That was a severe whack!

1852
02:21:20,939 --> 02:21:25,251
With one whack, was
hospitalised, so you can imagine

1853
02:21:26,211 --> 02:21:30,216
Doing some nonsense
and now you are walking tensed

1854
02:21:34,152 --> 02:21:36,996
No need to take
tension, Sini is pregnant

1855
02:21:52,103 --> 02:21:55,573
If you play with males,
it will be like this!

1856
02:21:57,809 --> 02:22:00,255
Babu sir come and get
inside the vehicle - Where to?

1857
02:22:00,545 --> 02:22:02,752
To Germany while saying to
get in should get inside vehicle

1858
02:22:02,847 --> 02:22:03,791
Hey man!

1859
02:22:14,692 --> 02:22:19,107
Hey sister who isn't seen so far, the
owner of this throw is not Babu sir

1860
02:22:19,631 --> 02:22:22,043
I do not know to scold in English

1861
02:22:22,300 --> 02:22:25,645
But for all these years if someone
is coming to your door step

1862
02:22:25,803 --> 02:22:28,113
How much he'll be loving you?

1863
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:31,311
Even the court has
heard what Babu sir has told

1864
02:22:31,709 --> 02:22:34,246
And now sister is
still on grudge, that is foul

1865
02:22:34,546 --> 02:22:37,789
That poor person is sitting inside the
car, without drinking a drop of liquor

1866
02:22:38,016 --> 02:22:40,997
If you have a little bit of good soul,
sister you come to that window

1867
02:22:41,185 --> 02:22:43,165
I'm calling you for
the sake of Babu sir

1868
02:22:49,894 --> 02:22:52,534
Won't come
I know wouldn't come

1869
02:22:53,031 --> 02:22:56,137
After plucking the heart out,
it is only a flower to you people

1870
02:22:56,334 --> 02:22:58,644
I'm the one to blame
for calling you sister

1871
02:22:59,103 --> 02:23:00,275
Sir, we'll go

1872
02:23:04,809 --> 02:23:07,585
By the way who are you?
What, an un seen beloved?

1873
02:23:08,146 --> 02:23:10,683
You sit in that glass mansion
with that grudge of yours

1874
02:23:11,249 --> 02:23:14,696
To pelt the stone and to call you,
sir's dog will come again, the dog!

1875
02:23:15,119 --> 02:23:18,225
You'll rust yourself sitting alone in
this house, with tooth inside the nose

1876
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:20,592
At that time, you'll know
the value of Babu sir

1877
02:23:47,619 --> 02:23:48,859
Stop, STOP!

1878
02:23:50,788 --> 02:23:51,926
Go in reverse

1879
02:24:36,267 --> 02:24:38,873
All these years since I came
here and after calling you

1880
02:24:39,203 --> 02:24:41,114
Why didn't you come?

1881
02:24:41,973 --> 02:24:44,010
All these years you have
only scolded, haven't you?

1882
02:24:44,776 --> 02:24:48,223
Did you say wants to see
or to come along with you?

1883
02:24:50,948 --> 02:24:55,021
Now, not remaining to ask or say

1884
02:24:57,121 --> 02:24:59,397
I'm just taking you

1885
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:20,047
Sir, don't scatter all that love
which was hidden all these years

1886
02:25:20,244 --> 02:25:22,121
Just remember there is
a mirror at the front

1887
02:25:22,313 --> 02:25:24,452
Come on Joy, take the vehicle

1888
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:27,228
Okay we'll go
Okay rig ht

1889
02:25:31,786 --> 02:28:45,420
