00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,298
Welcome to Zee News.

2
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:10,459
A look at the top story of the day.

3
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:14,306
The Mumbai police are on
the horns of a dilemma...

4
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:20,313
because of an unusual bank robbery.
An internet hacker has succeeded...

5
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,818
in siphoning off 5.5 billion
rupees from two bank accounts

6
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,320
According to our sources,
both companies belong...

7
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:31,323
to the underworld don
of Mumbai, Babu Anna...

8
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,326
who uses the companies as a front
for his illegal activities

9
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:37,329
What remains to be seen
is whether the police..

10
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:41,333
..get the internet
mastermind first..

11
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:45,337
..or the don who finds himself
swindled out of his savings

12
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,385
Damn it!

13
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:40,892
What happened to Anna?

14
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:53,395
A match... a match!

15
00:04:56,743 --> 00:05:00,907
Light it up! Set me
on fire! Light it up!

16
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,415
No, Anna...
- Finish me!

17
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:09,421
l'm a dog! A mad dog! A cur!

18
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:14,750
Babu Anna's money gets robbed!
Babu Anna's !

19
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:19,763
All right if he's robbed it. But
where's he going to spend it?

20
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,768
On his family, Anna.
- Family...?

21
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:26,431
No way! Who could he
have in his family?

22
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:29,441
His father, his mother...
- Carve his father out

23
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,947
Burn his mother alive! And hack
his brother to tiny pieces!

24
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,607
As for his sister...

25
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:41,950
set Yeda Yadav after her! Look
at how l hit out at him!

26
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:47,958
When l hit him, forget
touching my money...

27
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:50,462
that swine won't even
be able to sniff at it!

28
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,964
l want that dog here!

29
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:57,970
Girish! Your responsibility.
l want that dog here!

30
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:00,472
You get that?
- Right on, Anna

31
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:09,482
Yes sir. Six computer experts have
been busy tracing him all night, sir

32
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:13,645
Can't say for sure... yes, l'll
report first to you, sir

33
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:18,480
Chavan, what's happening on
the internet robbery case?

34
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:21,149
lt's taking a bit of time,
sir. The systems...

35
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,660
Don't give me excuses.

36
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:25,493
The pressure's mounting
every minute

37
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,830
Find out who he is and
where he is holed up!

38
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,551
'My eyes...'

39
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,882
'seek her...'

40
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,052
'everywhere l look'

41
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:37,559
'One day, she will
come right upto me'

42
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:44,907
'Her charms have made
a romantic out of me'

43
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:52,744
'She's the one who appears in my
dreams and makes them rosier'

44
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,582
'She hasn't a clue,
she's ignorant...'

45
00:07:56,656 --> 00:08:00,752
'how bowled over
l am by her charms'

46
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:56,638
'Never before have
l experienced this'

47
00:08:56,716 --> 00:09:03,645
'l have no idea how it all happened'

48
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:12,153
'My obsession is nothing but the
effect of your love, sweetheart'

49
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:09,051
'She must've never have
seen someone as crazy'

50
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:16,722
'lt's this fancyfree nature of mine
that shall win her over some day'

51
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:24,731
'l've never seen such a romance, nor
have l seen someone as crazy'

52
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:28,740
'ln your heart is now my dwelling'

53
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,403
'Somewhere, some day...'

54
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:40,749
'l will find my heart-throb'

55
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,782
How much?
- 3 rupees

56
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,782
Keep the change.

57
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:49,485
Let me go.
- Let you go?

58
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,147
After you give me your licence

59
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,158
That girl ahead will go away.
- Girl?

60
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,160
Had heard about the
wife and the other one.

61
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:56,991
But first time l am hearing about
the ahead one and the behind one.

62
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:00,496
You have a bike. So why
do you need a babe?

63
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,000
You youngsters are real flirts

64
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,163
She is the one. l am telling you,
it is absolutely amazing.

65
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,334
And that cop sprang there!

66
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,842
The girl l could only dream
of was actually there!

67
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,505
Right there in front
of me! l mean...

68
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,515
l mean.. - What the heck.
- You know Sonia..

69
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,848
l'm sure she'd have recognised
me too, if she had seen me

70
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,187
She'd have felt just as l felt! l'm
telling you, l can't believe it!

71
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:27,851
That l have found her.
She is the one!

72
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,521
l want to meet her, talk to her...
- Stupid!

73
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,860
You haven't told me about the
car deal. What happened..

74
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,866
..about the BMW and Mercedes?

75
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,526
Oh yes, that was finalised
last night.

76
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,866
That too in 2.5 million.. cash!

77
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,532
Forget all that! You're
not listening, Sonia!

78
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,040
l have found her.

79
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,873
She's in this very city! l
saw her in flesh and blood!

80
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:49,210
l want to meet her. Talk to her.

81
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:51,546
But these cops are
really too much.

82
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,879
Hey, just listen to me.

83
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:57,889
My wait has actually come to an end.
How l wish l could meet her once

84
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:01,887
Guess what, Jai? Dad asked
me to marry that guy..

85
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,555
..again and l turned him down

86
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,895
Only because l happen
to be waiting...

87
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,903
for this stupid boy
to propose to me!

88
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:13,905
You did right. Excellent!

89
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:17,909
You.. - Hey.. ok, relax.

90
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,907
Shut up and listen
carefully, you stupid.

91
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:27,920
There's no one else in your
life. There's only me

92
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:36,928
Sonia is my best friend.

93
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:40,255
But my heart's bowled over by her

94
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,947
l love you, Jai!

95
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,486
Hang on!

96
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,494
Jai... what happened?

97
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:31,036
Hello, brother.
- Hello, son. How're you doing?

98
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,702
Very well. Tell me, sir..

99
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,040
Which Gurudwara is this
procession coming from?

100
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:37,048
The Singh Sabha Gurudwara.
- Sat Sri Akal

101
00:15:55,134 --> 00:16:00,401
Lord, my pledge of 40 days'
fast comes to an end today

102
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:04,409
Heed my prayer, Lord.
Please grant me my wish

103
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:25,424
Please wear them.
- But...

104
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:28,592
Go on. l'm doing service.
- Service?

105
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:32,101
Yes. l'm doing service
with a wish...

106
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,436
that l find the one l love

107
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:36,770
How sweet!

108
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:39,106
You will surely find her

109
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:42,113
Because the wish you seek with
a true heart, is always granted

110
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:44,443
Wear your footwear

111
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,474
Are you Neha?
- Yes

112
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,155
Neha madam...?

113
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:33,164
Who's been sending this...?
- l don't know

114
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,175
Oh God!

115
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:54,179
Now look...

116
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:05,196
You? ls it from the Gurudwara?

117
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:11,202
Oh no! Not from the Gurudwara!
- So then...?

118
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,532
Believe me, l've never done
a thing like this ever before

119
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,538
But l'm not afraid to do it

120
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,545
They fear, who have
malicious intentions

121
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,210
l love you, Neha.

122
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:31,888
That's exactly how l reacted when
l saw you in person 3 days ago

123
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:33,549
And l fell in love with you

124
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:36,220
And then l saw you in a
salwar-kameez for the first time...

125
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,231
See..? l still can't control myself

126
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,733
Look, you aren't...?
- l know, l know

127
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:46,738
lt isn't easy for a girl to
make a decision so quickly

128
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,741
You need time, isn't it?
No problem, l'll wait

129
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,741
But just two hours, okay? Because
l can't wait any longer

130
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,249
See you two hours later then

131
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:00,251
China Love!

132
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,584
You will come and put
your arms around me...

133
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,248
and say that you love me.

134
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:13,259
Ok, bye! You are so beautiful! Bye.

135
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:28,274
Have a really good time tonight.
Keep this party going at China Love.

136
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:37,947
She is coming.
- Who?

137
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:39,285
Neha

138
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,624
Today, l professed my love to her.
- Then?

139
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,298
l gave her time to think.
All of two hours

140
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:50,301
Two hours! Wow!

141
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,304
l know it's too short a notice,
but l can't help it

142
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:55,966
l can't live more than two
hours without her. Sonia...

143
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,633
l'm sure she'll come

144
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:02,637
She will give me a hug and
say that she loves me

145
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,644
Whatever!

146
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,358
'l...'

147
00:20:58,037 --> 00:20:59,698
'you...'

148
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,367
'love...'

149
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:04,375
'and the rising desires'

150
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:06,367
'And love starts now!'

151
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,040
'Come to me, my love'

152
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:12,378
'That's right.'

153
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:20,055
'l, you, romance, love...'

154
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,892
'and the rising desires!
Come to me, my love'

155
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,397
'Sweetheart...'

156
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:28,730
'what have you done?'

157
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:33,905
'l've given my heart to you'

158
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:47,742
'With those gazes and sweet words
you've stolen my heart away'

159
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,416
'Come my love, let's shake a leg.'

160
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:55,486
'l am...'

161
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,488
'lost...'

162
00:22:57,556 --> 00:22:59,490
'in your love'

163
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,825
'So lost...'

164
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,493
'that l care...'

165
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,829
'for none else'

166
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:13,998
'When my anklets chime, he
pines... it's inebriating'

167
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:18,510
'Come my love, let's shake a leg.'

168
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:05,556
'My heart...'

169
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:08,218
'throbs...'

170
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,557
'as desires...'

171
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:12,563
'well up'

172
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:16,897
'l'd die for you...'

173
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,062
'my love'

174
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,572
'You are the girl of my
dreams, you invade..

175
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,574
..my heart... love is a delight'

176
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:28,579
'Come my love, let's shake a leg.'

177
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,915
'l...'

178
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:37,922
'you...'

179
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,924
'love...'

180
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,857
'and the rising...
- desires'

181
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,589
'Love..'

182
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,597
'..starts now.'

183
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:48,593
'Come to me, my love'

184
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,601
'Sweetheart...'

185
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,597
'what have you done?'

186
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:57,938
'l've given my heart to you'

187
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,606
'With those gazes and sweet words
you've stolen my heart away'

188
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:30,972
You thought she'd come,
give you a hug...

189
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:34,638
and tell you that she loves you

190
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,643
Only a stupid girl would
do that with you

191
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,150
That's me

192
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,150
Now, c'mon. Let's go.

193
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,982
C'mon, Jai.

194
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,709
You...?
- You didn't come...?

195
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:44,215
l kept waiting for you since nine,
but you didn't turn up

196
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,711
Are you insane?

197
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:49,720
l've been insane ever since
l saw you, never before

198
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,722
Neha, l've decided...

199
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:56,056
l really love you, Neha.
- O God! Please.

200
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:03,228
O my God! Then..

201
00:27:03,302 --> 00:27:04,735
Then?

202
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:08,068
What else? He kept on raving, and
l slammed the door in his face

203
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,732
What a crazy guy!

204
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:13,734
Whatever you say, he seems
to be very interesting

205
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,742
Do such lovers exist in real life?

206
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,745
l've never...

207
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,253
ls it him? He is so cute!

208
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,425
You may think l'm crazy,
and l really am

209
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:39,764
l know, l've been quite a pest

210
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,773
And, last night l even
came to your house...

211
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,775
l shouldn't have done that.
l am sorry for that.

212
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:48,779
But l can't help it. When it comes
to you, l've no control over myself

213
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:52,276
Excuse me, bill please.

214
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:58,288
Look probably.. - Thank you.

215
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:00,785
Probably...

216
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,293
l'm bad at displaying it,
but my love for you is true

217
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,796
And l can do anything to prove it

218
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:07,787
Now you will say that..

219
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,128
you can down the moon and the
stars for me...

220
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,135
Will jump off the highest cliff...

221
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:14,138
Will even give up your life for me.

222
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:19,804
lf that would convince
you, l'll do it

223
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,807
Very good.

224
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:24,815
What are you waiting for?

225
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:29,820
All right! l was madly
in love with you...

226
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,822
now l'm going to die for you

227
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:37,322
Ok, best of luck.

228
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:45,560
Greetings! Welcome to our viewers.

229
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,896
Here are the headlines.

230
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:57,072
Neha Mehra? - Yes.

231
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:59,406
Who do you think you are?
- Excuse me.

232
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:01,576
Your good looks...

233
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:04,911
don't give you the right to
play with someone's life

234
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:08,077
l've never seen Jai like this

235
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:11,919
His parents passed away when
he was nine. Do you know?

236
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,589
Yet, he worked his way up on his
own, From the age of nine years.

237
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:20,925
And now...

238
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,935
he's paying a heavy price
for not understanding you

239
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:30,932
Meaning? - Jai took an overdose
of sedatives...

240
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,943
and tried to kill himself - What?

241
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:37,948
lf something happens to
him.. lts your fault.

242
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,961
Govind kaka, did you
get the medicines?

243
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:59,970
Excuse me, you can relax now.

244
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:02,302
We've removed even the last
traces of the pills

245
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:03,966
He is out of danger.

246
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,977
Can l see him?
- Not now

247
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:09,479
l don't think he'll come
around before morning

248
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:11,982
Ok, thank you so much, doctor.

249
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,354
You are really crazy

250
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:59,359
l don't believe, for my sake,
someone would...

251
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:04,034
l feel as if l've
got a new identity

252
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,031
Someone loves me so much

253
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:13,544
lf l turn him down, no one will be
more insane than me in this world.

254
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,376
l love you, Jai.

255
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,051
l have never said that before

256
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:26,551
But l felt no fear in saying
it for the first time today

257
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:30,390
They fear, who have
malicious intentions

258
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,397
Such decisions aren't
taken in haste, l know

259
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:41,065
l'm not in a hurry

260
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,573
l will wait.

261
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:50,080

'come to me'

'express it'

298
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,435
Jai, l need to tell you something

299
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:46,936
Go on

300
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:52,766
You know Sonia, it's amazing.

301
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:54,778
Ever since l met Neha, l've
cared least for time

302
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:57,781
At times l feel it flies,
at times l feel it stops

303
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:02,782
See, l have to meet her in an hour,
but the clock just won't tick away

304
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:06,454
What's going to happen of you?
- Nothing

305
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:09,459
l'll work hard for a few
years, earn enough...

306
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:12,792
and then l'll marry her and
have seven or eight kids

307
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,458
Seven or eight? ls that all?
- Yes, don't l need to work?

308
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,797
But l'll send them over
to you for stories

309
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:20,802
Okay, so l'll be their nanny?
- Right

310
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:21,964
Forget it, Jai.

311
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,804
lt's going to prove you costly.
- Why?

312
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,801
Because l'm going to London, Jai

313
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:30,474
l've decided to marry

314
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:36,476
Why London? You could
get suitors here too

315
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,488
l'll talk to your parents...
- No Jai

316
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:45,825
l relate every place, every
thing in this city with you

317
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:49,823
l may stay away from you, but l
can't tear myself apart from you

318
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,501
l must go now... else l'll
miss my flight, too

319
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,503
You are...

320
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:01,840
leaving right now?

321
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,509
And you tell me now?
- Had l told you earlier...

322
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,517
l might've given in
to your reasoning

323
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:15,520
l know, you think l'm selfish

324
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,524
But today... please
let me be selfish

325
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:25,029
Let me escort you to the airport.
- No

326
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,531
l'll go alone

327
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,539
You are not going alone that far.
- No, Jai

328
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,866
Please don't make it
more difficult for me

329
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,051
l will miss you.

330
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,548
l love you.

331
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:52,557
Bye. - Stupid.

332
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:24,923
Neha...?

333
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:45,613
What are you doing?
Neha, what are you..

334
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,622
Have you gone mad, Neha?
What's happening here?

335
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:01,631
What's the matter?
- l...

336
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:06,961
What is it?

337
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:23,977
How would you know that you're in
love with a criminal's daughter?

338
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:28,988
A criminal?
- Yes

339
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:38,663
Daddy's no more. But he left
making life difficult for me.

340
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:41,671
What does that mean?

341
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:48,678
Daddy had borrowed money
from the underworld...

342
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:50,680
and now, they're following me

343
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:56,680
Till now, they only kept
threatening me. But now...

344
00:42:56,754 --> 00:43:01,691
they say that if l don't return
their money within 3 days, they will...

345
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:08,698
they will kidnap me.
- Who do they think they are?

346
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:12,696
They're like the wolves,
Jai. l don't..

347
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,706
..want to fall in their
hands. So l...

348
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:22,712
Didn't you consider for
a moment what would..

349
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,715
..happen of me if you were harmed?

350
00:43:28,052 --> 00:43:32,386
Don't worry. Just tell me
where l will find them

351
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:37,052
They're very dangerous, Jai. l did
all l could to repay them, but...

352
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:42,065
Don't worry, l can really help. l
have the money. 2.5 million in cash

353
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:49,734
lt isn't so little.
l owe them 60 million.

354
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,745
Neha, everything is going to be fine.

355
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,754
l'll deal with everything.
You don't worry

356
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:17,761
lt's five years old,
but thank God...

357
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:23,774
you've maintained it rather well.
You also have a 24-hour water supply

358
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,776
Got to sell immediately, right?
So, thank God...

359
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:30,109
it'll fetch at least 8 million.
ls that okay?

360
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:32,782
Don't worry.

361
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:37,781
Nice, nice... looks solid

362
00:44:39,123 --> 00:44:43,787
Facing the West. Also
has a nice sea-view?

363
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:47,456
Can we get a glimpse of
the sea from here? - No

364
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,795
No? From the terrace?

365
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:52,796
No harm in saying you can

366
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:57,301
Since it's the ground floor,
security is good enough

367
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:04,137
This is a weak lock, l say. But
that's okay. l'll handle it

368
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:08,311
Actually, l have a buyer.
And cash won't be a problem

369
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:11,815
l'm sure it'll get sold at 5 million

370
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:13,823
You want me to negotiate?

371
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,492
60 million? You can't be serious!

372
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:22,832
You say 60 millions as if you
were borrowing my car for 6 days

373
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:29,839
60 million. Only
one way of raising that..

374
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:31,841
..type of money in
such a short time

375
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:33,843
Go and rob a bank!

376
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:38,848
Stop joking.
- Sorry, sorry.... but 60 million?!

377
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:42,511
Are you mad? You will rob a bank...?

378
00:45:42,586 --> 00:45:45,851
What else can we do? We
have no other choice

379
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:53,853
Your house and mine and our belongings
won't fetch more than 20 million.

380
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,862
l know what l'll do. l'll go to
the bank tomorrow morning and...

381
00:45:59,203 --> 00:46:02,866
Really...? By the way, which
bank do you propose to rob?

382
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:08,372
Standard Chartered Bank, Bandra.
Now listen to me, Neha

383
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:12,876
l know what l'm doing is wrong.
But we have no other choice

384
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:15,879
To raise 60 million in just
two days... think about it

385
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:21,891
We've tried everything, we...
- Rather l die than do this, Jai

386
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:27,387
Listen to me, Neha

387
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:30,900
Neha, just stop.

388
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:38,908
Promise me, you won't even joke
about such a thing again

389
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:45,413
lf something happens to you... -
Okay. The bank robbery's off. Okay?

390
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:32,956
Five guards during the day. Must
at least be 3 during the night

391
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,464
Looks pretty difficult

392
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:42,967
Mr. Vikram, it's great pleasure
to be of service to you.

393
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,979
What urgency makes you withdraw
70 million in one go?

394
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:52,982
No problem. The bank is
yours. So are we...

395
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,316
and most important, the
money's yours too!

396
00:47:57,655 --> 00:48:02,649
Thank you for using our services.

397
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:05,991
This is the first time we're handling
such a big wire-transfer for you

398
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:08,998
l hope you will give us
the opportunity to..

399
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:12,502
..do many more wire-transfers
for you

400
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,004
Thank you very much.

401
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:37,024
Seems l won't be required to
break the promise made to Neha.

402
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:40,029
Now not the bank but
he is going to get robbed.

403
00:51:42,279 --> 00:51:45,715
You look well-bred. Why
did you come here?

404
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:50,219
To steal

405
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:52,221
l see

406
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:57,220
l went to rob the bank and saw
you withdrawing the money

407
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:00,223
Thought l'd rob it from you

408
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,233
Robbing the bank was much
easier, wasn't it?

409
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:14,237
Please, come in.

410
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:28,257
What if you had got killed?

411
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:32,255
That's okay

412
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:37,266
l don't care for my life

413
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,262
l'd at least have got 60 million.

414
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:44,267
Why do you need the money?

415
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:46,275
l don't consider it
necessary to tell you

416
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:48,277
That's my problem.

417
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:57,287
All right, you can tell
the cops when they arrive

418
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,302
Have some juice. - No thanks.

419
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:22,311
Have it. lt's said
to be good for health

420
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:27,310
Sit down

421
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:43,332
lt was six months ago that l
saw Neha for the first time..

422
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:03,352
lnteresting.. very very interesting.

423
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:11,354
Let's say l give it to you.
l give you 60 million

424
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:20,369
But what can l give you in return?

425
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,371
Your life

426
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:25,374
Something you don't care for, right?

427
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:30,379
Which means...?

428
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:36,379
Now look, Jai. There's
no going back after..

429
00:54:36,453 --> 00:54:39,388
..l tell you what l
am about to tell you.

430
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:42,391
So think it over and...
- l'm prepared to do anything

431
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:46,395
But l need the money. ln 24 hours

432
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,729
Are you sure? - Yeah.

433
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:55,397
So listen. Maybe you've heard
of the internet robbery case?

434
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:58,902
Yes, in which someone
stole 5.5 billion..

435
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:00,910
..from Babu Anna's account, right?

436
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:07,410
For 60 million, you must claim
to be the computer hacker...

437
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:12,421
and turn yourself over to
the police. - But what..

438
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:14,423
..will you gain out of it?

439
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:16,419
Gain?

440
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:25,424
l'll be rid of the fear of getting
caught or dying at Babu Anna's hands

441
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:29,937
Because l am the computer
hacker, Jai

442
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:37,444
l've committed a crime in
my lust for wealth...

443
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:41,450
but l've lost my sleep
and peace of mind

444
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:50,954
You were willing to lose your
life for 60 million, Jai

445
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,464
Now you've only got
to serve a sentence

446
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:07,476
What are you thinking about, Jai?

447
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:14,984
Okay, not 60 million. l'll
give you 70 million...

448
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,983
to spend the rest of your life,
after your imprisonment

449
00:56:20,057 --> 00:56:21,490
l agree

450
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,493
Good boy.

451
00:56:24,561 --> 00:56:27,826
But l need just 60
million and not 70.

452
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:31,500
All right. suit yourself

453
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:35,834
When are you going to surrender?
- When are you going to pay me?

454
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:39,999
Surrender. And you
will have the money

455
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:42,511
Give me the money.
And l'll surrender

456
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,011
Ok, fair enough.

457
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:55,024
l think l can trust you
Where will you go anyway?

458
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:01,860
Let's go inside. lt takes a hell of
a lot of time to count 60 million.

459
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:10,539
Throw this money in their face

460
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,545
So much of money...? How?

461
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:20,549
l've mortgaged my life to someone

462
00:57:24,621 --> 00:57:27,556
You think your boyfriend
is worth nothing!

463
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:29,558
Been dealing in imported
cars for 3 years now..

464
00:57:29,626 --> 00:57:31,560
..l command respect too, no?

465
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:35,558
All in one night...?

466
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,064
One moment. You haven't really
robbed the bank...?

467
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:43,572
Swear it on you!
l didn't rob the bank

468
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:46,899
You've sworn on me.
- Sworn on you

469
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:48,569
l didn't rob the bank. Okay?

470
00:57:48,645 --> 00:57:51,079
How we will we repay
such a huge debt?

471
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:58,916
This is nothing. l'd give my
life for you, if l had to

472
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:04,593
For as long as l live, it's
my duty to look after you

473
00:58:06,663 --> 00:58:10,258
Why must you talk about dying?
Our lives have only just begun

474
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,601
What's that?

475
00:58:21,945 --> 00:58:26,109
Keep it with you forever.
And whatever happens...

476
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:30,613
remember, l'm always with you

477
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:43,626
l love you, Jai.

478
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:47,795
l'm very scared, Jai

479
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:53,966
l feel as if you're hiding
something from me

480
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:59,648
Silly girl. Have l
ever lied to you?

481
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:15,658
At exactly 5:30, you will enter
the Net World cybercafe

482
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:21,670
As usual, most computers will
be occupied at that hour...

483
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:26,339
and the seat at the entrance
will be vacant

484
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:28,001
That's the seat you must take

485
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:32,675
You will at once go to the
website of Universal Bank

486
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:35,183
Without losing time,
you will get to work

487
00:59:38,755 --> 00:59:41,690
By that time you will be in
the eyes of a few special people.

488
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,696
From my computer, l will keep
track as to where you're going

489
00:59:57,774 --> 01:00:02,711
To go to the Current Account page
from the bank's home-page...

490
01:00:03,046 --> 01:00:06,880
you'll have to type in the password.
The password is magic:3259

491
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:13,053
That's it. What happens next,
you very well know, Jai

492
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:15,717
All the best.

493
01:00:19,796 --> 01:00:21,730
l love you, Neha.

494
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:34,067
ACP Suresh Chauhan. Let's go

495
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:54,422
Anna...?
- Yes, Jayant?

496
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:57,762
Switch on the news, Anna. The
internet guy's been caught

497
01:00:59,102 --> 01:01:00,933
The godamn... - The cops caught
him only this evening

498
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:03,768
No one would imagine he's a crook.
Such a young pisser

499
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:08,771
Switch it on...
- l am, l am

500
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:13,775
This arrest proves that it's no
difficult task for the Mumbai police...

501
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,785
to track down a hi-tech criminal

502
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:21,790
This youth who staked a claim to
a huge booty of 5.5 billion...

503
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:24,122
will be presented
in court tomorrow..

504
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:26,788
..surprisingly such crimes
are on the rise

505
01:01:26,863 --> 01:01:27,795
Get lost!

506
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:43,812
Get out of my way!
- Anna!

507
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,816
Cricket! They've made a stadium
out of my compound!

508
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:53,817
Give that to me. l'll
play cricket now

509
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:59,829
These guys will now give up our
profession and turn cricketers!

510
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:04,162
Whom did l ask to handle the case
of the computer hacking thief?

511
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:05,826
Me, Anna

512
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:08,837
You, you...!

513
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:11,840
all play, no work!

514
01:02:13,176 --> 01:02:14,837
Die!

515
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:22,174
Cricket he plays!

516
01:02:22,252 --> 01:02:30,853
The cops found him before you. And
you've been playing cricket!

517
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:37,861
Now listen! That cur won't be
presented in court tomorrow

518
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:40,198
He's coming here! You get that?

519
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,204
Yes, Anna. l do

520
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:48,867
Go ahead and bowl. Go on

521
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:54,877
Toss it up again

522
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:10,893
C'mon! Move it!

523
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:13,896
Move it!

524
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:17,900
He has arrived.

525
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,236
Move.

526
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:20,901
Go back side.

527
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:26,915
Move a side.

528
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:03,952
Come on, come with me.

529
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:16,623
Come.. drag him along.

530
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:18,963
Push this wretch inside.

531
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,980
Let me go!

532
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,995
Where do you think you're
going? Come on! - Let go of me.

533
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:03,671
Don't shoot! Don't!

534
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:49,057
C'mon, everyone get in. We
need to go back to the station.

535
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:13,081
Neha.. Neha.. l .. that..!

536
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:15,083
What are you doing here, Jai?

537
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:21,089
The cops. They're after me!
Anna's guys tried to kill me!

538
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:08,401
Well? Why are you surprised?

539
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:13,308
Didn't you take me by surprise too?
By forcing yourself on me?

540
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:16,138
Believe me, Neha.

541
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:19,939
l've never done such a thing,
Neha. l can even die for you!

542
01:07:21,651 --> 01:07:23,881
l love you, Neha. l really love you.

543
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:28,146
l was so surprised when
l got to know..

544
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:30,818
..that you had swallowed
sleeping pills for Neha!

545
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:56,179
You weren't put to sleep...

546
01:07:56,853 --> 01:07:59,515
but our luck surely woke up

547
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:05,191
Here you are. lt'll open up
your brains and your heart

548
01:08:07,196 --> 01:08:08,185
No?

549
01:08:09,198 --> 01:08:10,187
Cheers!

550
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:20,202
We were hopelessly trapped

551
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:25,405
And suddenly, l met you outside the
Gurudwara after my fast was complete.

552
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:28,547
You wanted to die for Neha anyway

553
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:32,385
So we thought we'd turn
your death into..

554
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:34,218
..an opportunity of
life for ourselves

555
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:38,020
Don't take it badly, okay?

556
01:08:38,828 --> 01:08:40,227
l hope you'll understand
that l've done..

557
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:42,230
..all this only for
the sake of my love

558
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,234
After all, you're a lover too

559
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:54,737
And God always helps lovers.
So He saved you for our sake

560
01:08:56,412 --> 01:09:00,405
You have no idea what you have
done for a couple in love, Jai

561
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:06,581
Police!

562
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:10,253
Open the door!

563
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:15,595
Would l put to you trouble, if it was
so easy to escape from the police?

564
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:24,862
No. To be honest, you haven't been
wise in running away from the police

565
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:28,608
Jai, l am sorry.

566
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,272
You've done so much for us

567
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:37,778
So that door remains shut, as
long as we finish our drinks

568
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:41,453
So go on. Save your life

569
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:44,289
Police!

570
01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:47,463
Open the door! Open it!

571
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:11,319
Yes, officer? - We're looking for a
man called Jai. Has someone come here?

572
01:10:13,723 --> 01:10:15,315
l haven't seen anyone, no

573
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,391
Sorry to disturb you.

574
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:21,326
Poor boy

575
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:55,362
Gone blind? - Stop there...

576
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:58,862
What's going on? - l haven't
done anything. Listen to me...

577
01:10:59,769 --> 01:11:01,964
Why are you pulling out the gun?
l haven't done anything, l say!

578
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:04,370
Let go of the gun! Let go, l say!

579
01:11:13,783 --> 01:11:15,546
Get him! He shot me
and is trying to escape.

580
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:17,375
Catch hold of him.

581
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:24,449
l love you, Jai.

582
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:29,256
l can't believe someone
can love me so much

583
01:12:32,628 --> 01:12:34,459
l owe them 60 million

584
01:12:36,866 --> 01:12:40,267
Promise me, that you
will not rob the bank

585
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:45,973
Why talk about dying? Our
lives have just begun

586
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:49,469
Sorry, Jai.

587
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:49,261
'The one l loved, l have found'

588
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:56,602
'l've found peace, but
l've lost my heart'

589
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:04,209
'Your charms...'

590
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:11,620
'have bowled me over, my love'

591
01:15:12,788 --> 01:15:18,954
'l have found the one l loved'

592
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:26,127
'l have found my peace,
but l've lost my heart'

593
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:33,799
'Your charms...'

594
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:40,983
'have bowled me over, my love'

595
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:44,036
'The kohl in your eyes drives me
crazy. Your beauty drives me mad'

596
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:53,051
'lt's your gaze that guides
me through the ways of love'

597
01:16:55,324 --> 01:17:02,730
'Let me sway, let me kiss
you, here's our chance'

598
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:11,537
'l'm sure you don't know...'

599
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:18,744
'this is the kick you
get out of my love'

600
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:14,963
'Hold me to your lips, my love.
Quench the thirst of your heart'

601
01:18:16,972 --> 01:18:24,310
'ln roses, we live. There's
not a thorn in sight'

602
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,812
'My desire for you
awakens an ache..'

603
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:32,979
'you're the one who
lights up my breath'

604
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:41,996
'The hues of love...'

605
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:49,330
'shakes up the world'

606
01:19:06,922 --> 01:19:10,858
Two months later.

607
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:50,890
You got the 60 million?

608
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:59,063
Hello! - Congratulations
on a new life, Neha

609
01:20:00,309 --> 01:20:03,904
Vikram...
- What happened?

610
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:05,910
lt's Jai!

611
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:10,912
There's no one, Neha

612
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:15,246
Believe me Vikram,
it was a call from Jai!

613
01:20:16,525 --> 01:20:21,258
Jai's dead. Dead. lt's two
months since he died

614
01:20:23,665 --> 01:20:27,260
Hey... relax, honey. Go to sleep

615
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,981
Vikram, could you give
me the towel please?

616
01:21:25,327 --> 01:21:26,316
Thanks.

617
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:46,805
Keep with it you forever. Remember,
l'm always with you

618
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:36,057
Vikram, open the door

619
01:23:01,156 --> 01:23:02,623
Happy anniversary, my love.

620
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:05,091
You almost killed me!
- Why?

621
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,091
C'mon, let's go, celebrate!

622
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:14,098
lt's exactly four
years since we met

623
01:23:16,438 --> 01:23:20,272
l didn't even realise how time flew
by, while l've been in love with you

624
01:23:22,544 --> 01:23:26,310
The dress l kept upstairs,
did you change it?

625
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:29,441
Me...? No, l didn't

626
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:34,281
The ring? The towel? Did you...?
- What are you talking about, Neha?

627
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:38,619
l was out.
- He's gotten into the house!

628
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:41,185
Sweetheart, not a soul
knows we're here

629
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:44,296
lt was his call last night.
And the ring..

630
01:23:44,366 --> 01:23:46,129
..and the dress was
given to me by Jai!

631
01:23:46,668 --> 01:23:48,659
l am telling you,
Jai is still alive.

632
01:23:48,804 --> 01:23:50,669
He's not dead. He's not dead!

633
01:23:55,644 --> 01:23:58,135
Relax! Relax!

634
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,307
Nothing can happen to you,
so long as l'm alive

635
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,179
Love you!

636
01:24:33,348 --> 01:24:35,578
l've lost again.
- Again...?

637
01:24:37,352 --> 01:24:39,183
So you want more money?

638
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:41,351
How much?
- So much

639
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,192
Good luck. - Thank you.

640
01:25:06,615 --> 01:25:08,276
l need 60 million rupees

641
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:14,378
l desperately need 60 million.
Neha's in deep trouble, sir!

642
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:18,555
The underworld will kidnap her if
she doesn't have 60 million, sir

643
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:22,024
You're a large-hearted man, sir...
- Now listen to me, you sonofa...

644
01:25:22,297 --> 01:25:25,232
No, l don't want to listen to
anything. Just save my Neha, sir

645
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:28,730
l need 60 million, sir. When shall
l come to collect the money?

646
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:34,037
That's the problem.
l know you won't show up

647
01:25:35,577 --> 01:25:37,738
Once. Just once, show
yourself to me...

648
01:25:39,414 --> 01:25:41,245
and l'll solve all your problems

649
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:57,922
Honey...

650
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:01,857
we've reached home

651
01:26:14,213 --> 01:26:15,874
l lost a big amount

652
01:26:16,381 --> 01:26:17,871
You are angry, no?

653
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:19,941
No, it's all right.

654
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:22,412
l love you. - l love you, too.

655
01:27:03,262 --> 01:27:06,322
Where are you going?
- l'll just switch on the light

656
01:27:35,227 --> 01:27:37,957
Well? Scared, are you?

657
01:27:38,297 --> 01:27:43,758
They fear, who have malicious
intent. You forgot so soon?

658
01:27:46,138 --> 01:27:47,969
l have loved you like crazy.

659
01:27:49,308 --> 01:27:50,969
Now l am going to
hate you like crazy.

660
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:10,660
You take so long to
open the door? - Hey, dude.

661
01:28:17,169 --> 01:28:20,502
Clothes, and the works! There's
nothing more to shop for

662
01:28:22,507 --> 01:28:24,998
l tell you something.

663
01:28:25,177 --> 01:28:29,011
lf you stay here any longer,
l'm gonna die of jealousy

664
01:28:29,081 --> 01:28:30,343
Shut up.

665
01:28:30,415 --> 01:28:31,609
Have you eaten?

666
01:28:32,084 --> 01:28:33,176
Yeah, thanks.

667
01:28:33,452 --> 01:28:36,512
Get ready soon, we're going
to the Rain Forest Cafe

668
01:28:37,556 --> 01:28:40,753
Count me out.
- Your friend is strange

669
01:28:40,826 --> 01:28:42,760
He's always refusing

670
01:28:43,195 --> 01:28:46,528
No wonder he turned down
a lovely lady like you

671
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,360
What lovely? l'm plain stupid.

672
01:28:50,035 --> 01:28:51,627
Had l not seen Vikram
and Neha at the mall...

673
01:28:51,703 --> 01:28:53,694
l wouldn't have informed
Govind kaka

674
01:28:53,772 --> 01:28:57,037
And you wouldn't have taken the
trouble and come here all the way

675
01:28:57,209 --> 01:28:59,541
At least you'd have forgotten
that fraud of a girl

676
01:28:59,778 --> 01:29:01,211
lt is unbelievable.

677
01:29:01,313 --> 01:29:04,214
You escaped the lndian police,
wasted your lifetime's savings...

678
01:29:04,283 --> 01:29:07,218
got seriously injured, hid inside
the cargo space of a ship...

679
01:29:07,286 --> 01:29:09,220
and journeyed for two whole months

680
01:29:09,388 --> 01:29:12,050
You even defeated death
to fight with life, buddy

681
01:29:12,658 --> 01:29:16,059
Man, this is a true
love story. - Love story?

682
01:29:20,465 --> 01:29:22,330
Every love story has two names.

683
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,265
But mine has only one

684
01:29:29,341 --> 01:29:31,070
Mine.

685
01:29:32,678 --> 01:29:35,408
And l have pledged that name
to ruin and destroy her.

686
01:29:37,616 --> 01:29:39,083
This is no love story.

687
01:29:40,686 --> 01:29:42,085
This is a hate story.

688
01:29:46,258 --> 01:29:47,418
Thank God that you are enjoying.

689
01:30:00,305 --> 01:30:02,102
May l come with you?

690
01:32:05,397 --> 01:32:07,490
Hello! - So, freak? - You..!?

691
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:11,232
Well? Does it hurt?

692
01:32:12,237 --> 01:32:15,968
Had l wished, you'd have
found Neha's corpse

693
01:32:16,041 --> 01:32:18,236
What do you want? Come
to the bloody point.

694
01:32:18,643 --> 01:32:20,975
My life.
- What if l refuse?

695
01:32:21,046 --> 01:32:22,240
What if Neha dies?

696
01:32:22,581 --> 01:32:25,914
Do as l tell you. lt's
in your interest

697
01:32:30,422 --> 01:32:33,414
All right, Jai. Finally
you've defeated me

698
01:32:34,593 --> 01:32:37,426
What am l to do?
- That what you did to me before

699
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:41,797
Confess to your crime
at the police station

700
01:32:43,435 --> 01:32:46,427
Tell them that you are
the hacker, not l

701
01:32:46,538 --> 01:32:49,336
How long can you use me as a shield
to save yourself from the cops?

702
01:32:49,608 --> 01:32:54,477
The longer you talk, the sooner
l can trace you, swine

703
01:32:55,547 --> 01:32:57,276
Go on

704
01:32:57,616 --> 01:33:01,074
You started the game, l'll finish it

705
01:33:01,553 --> 01:33:07,458
And yes... l'm not paying
you for this. Get it?

706
01:33:10,695 --> 01:33:12,629
Yes, l get it

707
01:33:13,798 --> 01:33:16,631
l got you. - Good.

708
01:33:22,374 --> 01:33:24,308
Got you!

709
01:33:24,809 --> 01:33:26,504
We've made a terrible
mistake, Vikram

710
01:33:27,913 --> 01:33:29,642
We chose the wrong guy for this job

711
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:36,314
He won't spare us. He's going to
chase us till we breathe our last

712
01:33:37,722 --> 01:33:42,318
He won't let us live,
Vikram. He won't

713
01:33:43,495 --> 01:33:47,659
He won't let us live
only if he lives

714
01:33:51,136 --> 01:33:57,006
Jai, this time l get you...
you're dead

715
01:34:17,896 --> 01:34:19,761
Phoning me, eh?

716
01:34:32,577 --> 01:34:34,374
You will whistle, eh?

717
01:34:46,992 --> 01:34:48,983
You'll enter our house, huh?

718
01:35:22,594 --> 01:35:24,585
Last time, you landed in a hospital

719
01:35:26,698 --> 01:35:30,759
Tonight, you are going
to the crematorium.

720
01:35:56,628 --> 01:35:57,720
Found Jai?

721
01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:00,564
Yes

722
01:36:00,632 --> 01:36:02,862
Where's he?
- ln the car

723
01:37:22,714 --> 01:37:25,877
Babu Anna, 'your' computer hacker
is in Cape Town, alive

724
01:37:26,818 --> 01:37:29,878
ls it? - l have sent him
to Elizabeth Hospital

725
01:37:30,155 --> 01:37:31,554
He's all yours now

726
01:38:22,774 --> 01:38:24,605
Congratulations on starting
afresh, Neha

727
01:38:29,781 --> 01:38:32,773
lt's my duty to take care of
you as long as l breathe

728
01:38:32,951 --> 01:38:37,615
l was madly in love with you.
Now l'm going to die for you

729
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:41,622
Have you found the 60 million?

730
01:39:01,813 --> 01:39:02,802
Honey...

731
01:39:07,051 --> 01:39:08,643
have soup

732
01:39:25,737 --> 01:39:27,671
Drink? - No.

733
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:40,681
Are you ok?

734
01:39:41,019 --> 01:39:42,680
Sure?

735
01:39:47,859 --> 01:39:49,690
l'll get a sweater

736
01:41:01,432 --> 01:41:02,763
No! NO!!!

737
01:41:46,978 --> 01:41:49,139
Help!

738
01:41:54,485 --> 01:41:56,009
Somebody help me!!!

739
01:42:05,897 --> 01:42:08,491
Jai, you are making a grave mistake

740
01:42:10,101 --> 01:42:12,626
Have you gone mad?
- Yes, l have.

741
01:42:13,371 --> 01:42:15,999
l went mad the moment you
stepped into my life

742
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:21,240
You looked at me, l went wild

743
01:42:22,447 --> 01:42:24,642
You spurned me, l
went mad with disappointment.

744
01:42:26,584 --> 01:42:29,178
You accepted me,
l went mad with joy

745
01:42:31,389 --> 01:42:33,254
And now l'm completely deranged

746
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:36,025
l can do anything with
you right now

747
01:42:38,396 --> 01:42:40,364
But l won't do that, because
l'm not like you

748
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:47,028
You wanted my life, didn't you?

749
01:42:48,406 --> 01:42:53,275
You should've asked me just once.
l'd have given it up with a smile

750
01:42:58,282 --> 01:43:00,876
Help! Help! - Shut up!

751
01:43:02,053 --> 01:43:03,884
Look at me!

752
01:43:04,288 --> 01:43:06,882
You've ruined my life!

753
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:12,893
No! l'm not going to cry for you!

754
01:43:13,297 --> 01:43:17,233
Treacherous woman! Forget love.
l will not even cuss you

755
01:43:18,069 --> 01:43:20,401
No expletive can ever define you

756
01:43:23,307 --> 01:43:24,899
C'mon.. come.

757
01:43:31,315 --> 01:43:32,907
Let me go

758
01:43:36,087 --> 01:43:38,920
Open the door, please

759
01:43:59,343 --> 01:44:00,674
You have a table for Jai Malhotra?

760
01:44:00,745 --> 01:44:02,007
Yeah, over there.

761
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:13,957
Sit

762
01:44:21,465 --> 01:44:23,296
No fuming, please

763
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:26,696
Anger is bad for health

764
01:44:28,372 --> 01:44:31,773
Especially for Neha's health

765
01:44:32,977 --> 01:44:36,310
Swine!
- Did l ask your name?

766
01:44:40,151 --> 01:44:41,982
Drink it up

767
01:44:42,153 --> 01:44:44,713
lt'll cool down your heart and mind

768
01:44:45,389 --> 01:44:46,981
Shut up!

769
01:44:51,329 --> 01:44:52,990
Where is she?

770
01:44:54,165 --> 01:44:55,996
Still alive

771
01:44:56,667 --> 01:45:00,501
But after two hours... can't say

772
01:45:01,539 --> 01:45:03,006
Should something happen to her...

773
01:45:05,409 --> 01:45:08,674
What do you want?
- Your arrest

774
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:11,011
Confess to your crime

775
01:45:11,682 --> 01:45:13,013
l agree

776
01:45:14,452 --> 01:45:16,010
Good boy.

777
01:45:17,355 --> 01:45:19,619
When will you surrender?
- When will you release Neha?

778
01:45:20,191 --> 01:45:22,216
Surrender, and l'll let Neha go

779
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,295
Let Neha go, and l'll surrender

780
01:45:28,432 --> 01:45:33,699
l want to meet her one last
time, before l surrender

781
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:38,433
Ok.

782
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:09,064
She's inside

783
01:46:25,423 --> 01:46:29,757
My mind is ruined waiting
in these ruins

784
01:46:30,695 --> 01:46:32,094
Welcome

785
01:46:32,363 --> 01:46:37,096
l'll settle this for good.
The final time.

786
01:46:38,269 --> 01:46:40,100
Babu Anna? Here!?
- Come on

787
01:46:43,441 --> 01:46:45,102
Hey, wait.

788
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:48,102
Ok.

789
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:51,109
Hot stuff! Really

790
01:46:52,283 --> 01:46:57,448
You make me feel like
l'm watching a movie

791
01:47:05,296 --> 01:47:09,630
Let alone steal, one would
even kill for her

792
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:13,466
What kind of a man do you need?

793
01:47:13,671 --> 01:47:15,935
Tell me. What do you see in a man?

794
01:47:16,307 --> 01:47:18,138
l'd tell you only if you were a man

795
01:47:18,309 --> 01:47:20,140
What daring! What guts!

796
01:47:21,579 --> 01:47:23,137
Just like these guys? Right?

797
01:47:25,883 --> 01:47:28,875
lf she falls she'll go wasted, no?

798
01:47:34,558 --> 01:47:41,657
As soon as l traced the hospital,
l put my men on guard

799
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,161
But he vanished.

800
01:47:45,436 --> 01:47:49,167
l came here all the way from lndia,
still no trace of him

801
01:47:49,974 --> 01:47:53,842
But somehow my white dogs here..

802
01:47:54,512 --> 01:47:57,970
sniffed this slink out

803
01:48:00,351 --> 01:48:02,182
You look different on TV.

804
01:48:03,354 --> 01:48:06,187
Fiddling with the computer
you tried to fiddle with me

805
01:48:06,724 --> 01:48:10,683
Tell me, how will you
return my money?

806
01:48:11,362 --> 01:48:13,353
On-line transfer? Or cash?

807
01:48:13,464 --> 01:48:14,692
l don't have the money

808
01:48:14,765 --> 01:48:15,857
Then?

809
01:48:15,933 --> 01:48:18,527
He has the money. He's the hacker.
- He's raving

810
01:48:18,602 --> 01:48:21,935
No, it's the truth. He stole
the money and set me up

811
01:48:22,473 --> 01:48:24,202
He is lying. - l am not
lying, l am telling the truth.

812
01:48:24,275 --> 01:48:26,209
Stop raving.
- l'm not raving

813
01:48:27,611 --> 01:48:31,411
Mustn't fight in a foreign country

814
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,484
Brings our country to disrepute

815
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:37,715
You didn't steal the money?
- No

816
01:48:39,557 --> 01:48:41,491
Then you are of no use to me

817
01:48:42,893 --> 01:48:46,829
Listen to me... if you kill me, you
will never get your money back

818
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:50,230
Because he'll thrust the
blame on me. - Right

819
01:48:51,402 --> 01:48:53,427
So l'll blow him up

820
01:48:53,571 --> 01:48:57,234
No, not him. With him
goes your money too

821
01:48:59,977 --> 01:49:04,038
Then there's only one
way out. The fish!

822
01:49:04,415 --> 01:49:05,575
No wait.

823
01:49:05,783 --> 01:49:09,241
lf you kill her, he'll
seal his lips forever

824
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,045
Then am l to blow myself up?

825
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:16,248
To hell with the money!

826
01:49:17,862 --> 01:49:18,794
No!

827
01:49:18,863 --> 01:49:21,263
Babu Anna! He's right

828
01:49:24,435 --> 01:49:26,266
l'm the hacker

829
01:49:26,804 --> 01:49:29,272
You are on track now

830
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,271
Come with me

831
01:49:33,077 --> 01:49:37,013
See... everything is
set. Get cracking

832
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:53,353
Goodness! lt goes over my head

833
01:49:53,831 --> 01:49:58,632
During my time, it was simple.
Loot at gunpoint

834
01:49:58,836 --> 01:50:00,701
Very easy

835
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:22,323
Processing will take around 5-7
minutes. ln the meantime...

836
01:50:25,729 --> 01:50:27,321
l'd like to fix him

837
01:51:25,556 --> 01:51:31,392
Scoundrels! You conned me

838
01:51:31,795 --> 01:51:34,389
You swallowed my money! l'll
make you puke it all now

839
01:51:37,001 --> 01:51:38,400
Bloody dogs!

840
01:51:38,736 --> 01:51:40,397
l'm not sparing you!

841
01:51:41,572 --> 01:51:45,406
l'll carve you! l'll finish you off

842
01:52:06,096 --> 01:52:09,429
Thanks - What thanks?
l saved you only..

843
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:12,230
..because your life means
freedom to me. Come now.

844
01:52:13,237 --> 01:52:14,431
You'll die

845
01:52:14,972 --> 01:52:16,439
Let's see

846
01:52:47,638 --> 01:52:52,632
Stay down there, you will live

847
01:53:36,053 --> 01:53:38,021
Stay right there! lf you
get up this time...

848
01:53:38,322 --> 01:53:40,688
l'll dispatch you

849
01:54:04,615 --> 01:54:06,549
l want my life back!

850
01:54:08,952 --> 01:54:10,544
Give me my life back.

851
01:54:12,222 --> 01:54:14,213
Neha and you ruined my life

852
01:54:16,894 --> 01:54:18,555
l will kill you.

853
01:54:19,163 --> 01:54:20,562
You will send me to jail, eh?

854
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,731
The two of you made
a mockery of my love

855
01:54:33,911 --> 01:54:39,577
Kill him, Vikram. Finish him off!

856
01:55:15,152 --> 01:55:16,619
You are finished.

857
01:55:18,422 --> 01:55:21,789
You have two or at the
most five minutes on you.

858
01:55:26,630 --> 01:55:29,224
Don't be mean, Vikram. Poor thing.

859
01:55:30,133 --> 01:55:32,624
You forgot? Last time
too we thought the same

860
01:55:33,804 --> 01:55:37,137
Why did you return? Who needs you?

861
01:55:39,643 --> 01:55:42,237
True. How long will this go on?

862
01:55:43,313 --> 01:55:46,441
l keep the strike, while
you keep losing

863
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:51,185
You are such a loser, Jai.

864
01:55:51,255 --> 01:55:53,314
Actually, he's not
at fault, Vikram

865
01:55:54,925 --> 01:55:58,918
He loves me so dearly that
it's hard to just quit

866
01:56:01,832 --> 01:56:03,823
Besides, he did all
this for my sake

867
01:56:04,167 --> 01:56:05,657
So sweet of him, no?

868
01:56:06,203 --> 01:56:07,670
But you know what?

869
01:56:08,205 --> 01:56:10,173
l feel nothing for you

870
01:56:11,742 --> 01:56:13,676
No love...

871
01:56:13,844 --> 01:56:15,675
neither empathy...

872
01:56:16,179 --> 01:56:17,669
nor mercy

873
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:21,684
l am sorry, Jai.

874
01:56:34,298 --> 01:56:37,426
Feel nothing? Do you
even have a heart?

875
01:56:43,106 --> 01:56:45,700
You keep the strike,
while l keep losing

876
01:56:47,244 --> 01:56:52,238
Let's try that one last time. Let's
see who strikes and who dies

877
01:57:09,399 --> 01:57:10,730
No! Neha! No!

878
01:57:14,071 --> 01:57:15,732
My love...

879
01:57:25,916 --> 01:57:29,352
The slut deserved it

880
01:57:30,354 --> 01:57:33,414
Yesterday she left me,
today she deserted you

881
01:57:35,158 --> 01:57:36,750
But l must say...

882
01:57:38,028 --> 01:57:39,757
she left after settling our scores

883
01:57:41,031 --> 01:57:45,024
Yesterday, l had love. No money

884
01:57:47,037 --> 01:57:50,302
Today, you have money. No love

885
01:57:56,313 --> 01:57:58,281
5.5 billion is your stake...

886
01:58:00,117 --> 01:58:02,779
but every day you will remember me

887
01:58:09,226 --> 01:58:10,784
Enjoy!

888
01:58:37,988 --> 01:58:40,980
At a time when the world buckles
under treachery, corruption...

889
01:58:41,058 --> 01:58:42,821
communal disharmony and greed..

890
01:58:42,893 --> 01:58:44,224
..philanthropy and humanity
still survives somewhere

891
01:58:44,428 --> 01:58:47,420
Which has been proved
by a mysterious angel

892
01:58:47,497 --> 01:58:49,988
This mysterious person has
donated nearly 5 billion...

893
01:58:50,067 --> 01:58:53,559
to the Missionaries
of Charity in Mumbai

894
01:58:54,104 --> 01:58:58,006
ln an exclusive interview, the
Chief Minister told Zee News that...

895
01:58:58,075 --> 01:59:02,512
the country needs such compassionate
and benevolent citizens...

896
01:59:02,846 --> 01:59:06,009
who, unhesitatingly perform their
duties towards the society...

897
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:09,575
by staying low profile and
have no political motives

898
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:13,251
Though nobody knows who the
magnanimous person is...

899
01:59:13,323 --> 01:59:17,453
one thing is certain. He will
receive the blessings of millions
