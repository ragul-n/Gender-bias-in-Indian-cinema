1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,159
Stop begging and do some work.

2
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,000
I've a job for you.
Will you do it?

3
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay, connect with me later.

4
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,359
"Even after walking a long distance.."

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,719
"..I couldn't meet you."

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,840
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

7
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,040
"Even after walking a long distance.."

8
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,599
"..I couldn't meet you."

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:40,120
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

10
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,159
Babu, don't run. You'll fall down.

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,959
"The relentless tears
haven't melted your heart."

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:12,159
"I've pondered upon it several
times but didn't get an answer."

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:22,120
"The relentless tears
haven't melted your heart."

14
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:31,800
"I've pondered upon it several
times but didn't get an answer."

15
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,199
"Even after walking a long distance.."

16
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,520
"..I couldn't meet you."

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:52,759
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

18
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,560
You don't care for us. Right?

19
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,439
You're busy with your writing all day.

20
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,280
Stay engrossed in literature.

21
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,960
There'll be a time when you'll be lonely.

22
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,039
You won't get anybody
beside you even if you wish to.

23
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,520
Babu, let's leave the house and go.
- No, mom.

24
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,479
I won't go with you. I'll stay with dad.
- You too?

25
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:27,840
"Yet I dream that you're always with me."

26
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:37,719
"You were with me and you'll
always be there in my feelings."

27
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,879
"Yet I dream that you're always with me."

28
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:57,800
"You were with me and you'll
always be there in my feelings."

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,039
"Somewhere amidst dreams
and reality in my heart."

30
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,120
"Even after walking a long distance.."

31
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,639
"..I couldn't meet you."

32
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,560
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

33
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,759
"Even after walking a long distance.."

34
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,959
"..I couldn't meet you."

35
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:46,519
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

36
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't want to write
on topics given to me anymore.

37
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,839
What's the use of these writings?

38
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,319
But, you've garnered the appreciation
of the readers, intellectuals..

39
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,439
..and critics by writing
on the topics given to you.

40
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,759
What's wrong with you today?

41
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,319
I've realized something
new at the fag end of my life.

42
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
The wealth, rewards, recognition, fame..

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,399
..do I really deserve what I got?

44
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,480
What's the value of all these things?

45
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,480
What's the value of
these things in my life?

46
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,519
You're being spiritual.

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,560
What will the future generation
learn from my writing?

48
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,360
What kind of knowledge and will they get?

49
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,639
If you think so then write
something for the future generation..

50
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,959
..so that people don't forget
you even after your demise.

51
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,959
No..no..I don't want to convey
any kind of lecture or message.

52
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:17,519
I want to serve mankind
in the last phase of my life.

53
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I don't have any desire.

54
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,639
I've got everything I wanted.

55
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,600
It's time to give back.

56
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,759
Well-said! This is how a
man of your stature should think.

57
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,519
Hey!

58
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,959
I hope you didn't get hurt.

59
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,000
Dad, I want a good story
from you for the festival edition.

60
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,759
Have I ever written anything
substandard for your publication?

61
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,560
Okay, let me see what I can write.
But, I can't assure you anything.

62
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,839
Why?
- I've different plans this time.

63
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,959
Can't you share your plan with me?

64
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,920
No.. nothing like that but
I would like to keep it to myself..

65
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,439
..for the time being.

66
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,560
I don't want to discuss it right now.

67
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,639
Anything serious?

68
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,519
Maybe yes or maybe no.
- Okay, fine.

69
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,439
I'll be waiting for your story.

70
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,120
There isn't much time left for the puja.

71
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,319
My story is always published in the end.

72
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,720
The same will happen this time

73
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,120
Okay, bye. I'm sure that whatever
you'll do will be very good.

74
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,600
"If you were flour,
I would have bread for breakfast."

75
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:21,279
"If you were tamarind,
I would have you with rice."

76
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,720
"If you were a pious lady,
I would've married you."

77
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
Stooge, go and call auntie.

78
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,639
Haru, don't call me stooge.

79
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,799
Why? What will you do?

80
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,159
The outcome isn't going to be good.

81
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,559
Let me hear what you'll do, stooge.

82
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,960
Hey! Do you want to
see what I'll do? Wait.

83
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
Get lost. Go and call auntie.

84
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,840
Haru.. you rascal.. I will..

85
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,720
Scoundrel! The outcome
of this isn't going to be good.

86
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,480
What's going on?

87
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,480
What's happening, Haru?

88
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,879
Leave him. You're going to break his hand.

89
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,279
Madhu, go from here.

90
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,519
If I tell auntie you'll be in trouble. Go.

91
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,799
Let me warn you that I'll
teach you a lesson one day.

92
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,320
It's a warning. Scoundrel!

93
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,120
Haru, wait here. I'll call auntie.

94
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,799
Hurry up. I've lot of work.

95
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,799
Look who has come to pay us a visit today.

96
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,200
Stop pretending. I've lot of work.

97
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,039
Why are you always so serious?

98
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,399
Can't you smile?

99
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,440
When I see you I forget to smile.
- Oh!

100
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,759
So, you don't like me
anymore as I've aged. Right?

101
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,279
You frequently visited us few years ago.

102
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,399
Listen.. you were young at that time.

103
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,279
You're old now.

104
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,120
Look what he's saying.

105
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,840
He is proud just because
he earns well through illegal means.

106
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,519
Get lost. Call auntie.

107
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,759
Haru, auntie is calling you.

108
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,360
Okay, let's go.

109
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:15,840
I want to write a story on
the prostitutes of red light area.

110
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,919
I want to write about
their real life experiences.

111
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,639
Real incidents.
- That's a good idea. Carry on.

112
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,240
But, there's a problem
if I write on this topic. - What?

113
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:39,240
I must know the reality
of their life before I start.

114
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:48,120
It won't be right to pen a story
based on few ideas that we've about them.

115
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,000
I didn't get you.

116
00:10:51,240 --> 00:11:00,960
If you want to write a
story based on true incidents..

117
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,720
..then you must know and
research the truth thoroughly.

118
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,759
Only then the readers will
be able to enjoy the write up..

119
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,039
..or else it'll become meaningless

120
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I didn't get you.
What do you exactly mean?

121
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,360
Do you want to know what I want?
- Yes.

122
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,080
I want to visit the red light area.

123
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,559
Have you lost your mind?

124
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,639
At this age you should go
on a pilgrimage but instead of it..

125
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,480
Oh no! Shame! Shame!

126
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,639
You've written many stories and novels.

127
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,240
But, I never heard you talk
about anything strange like this before.

128
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,519
Man is prone to changes.

129
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,039
He changes with changing time.

130
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,159
That's how he experiences the new age.

131
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,639
If I want to write a story
based on true incidents then..

132
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,120
..I must've a thorough knowledge of it.

133
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,320
I must know about their environment,

134
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:11,759
the people who live
there and their customs.

135
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,279
How can I write without
any knowledge of these things?

136
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,639
I've to go to their place
to get an idea of their reality.

137
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,759
Will you stop me?

138
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:31,279
Why? Will it ruin your social prestige?
- Yes, you're right.

139
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,120
I can't accept this.

140
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,519
Look at him.

141
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,720
I want to know everything.

142
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,720
I don't care if I've to fight for it.

143
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,039
Haru, if this continues
the business will run at loss.

144
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,559
Do something.

145
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,879
Give me money and I'll arrange everything.

146
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,759
You sent many girls to me before.

147
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,440
Did I ever hold back your payment?
- No.

148
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,879
But auntie, times aren't good.

149
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,039
Verbal promises won't help.

150
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,519
Give money and get what you want. Got it?
- Yes.

151
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
How much do I need to pay?

152
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,960
Give 1 as advance.

153
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,639
Pay the remaining amount
after the delivery.

154
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,799
What? What are you saying?

155
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,480
1 means 1 lakhs?

156
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,159
Auntie, you're still
living in the old times.

157
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,720
People easily understand what we mean.

158
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,480
The whole process involves a lot of money.

159
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,320
How will your work
get done if you don't pay?

160
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,279
I quoted a minimal amount for you.
- I know..

161
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,120
..but 1 lakh as advance is a huge sum.

162
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,440
Please give some discount.
- No, auntie. I can't.

163
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,399
I usually quote 2 lakhs.

164
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,080
The rate of the police and
informers have also increased.

165
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,000
We're helpless.

166
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,960
Okay, but the girl should be beautiful.

167
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,440
Don't worry about it.

168
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,399
Have I ever supplied anything
of inferior quality to you?

169
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,240
Give me the money. I'm in hurry.

170
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,240
Take it. 50,000 rupees. Count it.

171
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,399
Your words are enough. I trust you. Bye.

172
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,399
Madhu. Hey Madhu.

173
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,519
Who's there in your family?
- Mom and dad.

174
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,120
Only your mom and dad?
- Yes.

175
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,840
You didn't marry?

176
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,000
Are you crazy?

177
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,480
It's difficult for me to sustain myself.

178
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,960
You're a school teacher. Right?
- Yes.

179
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,159
But, I'm not a permanent
teacher and the salary is nominal.

180
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,279
It's hard to survive on it.

181
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,000
Yet you're a teacher. I work as a cook.
- So what?

182
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,799
You do a respectable job.

183
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,240
You're not begging.

184
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,759
Yes, but the money I earn
helps me to sustain a family of two.

185
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,200
Your father is a priest.

186
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,519
So what? He doesn't have much work.

187
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
Oh! That's why you couldn't
continue your education.

188
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,240
I wanted to go for higher
education after college.

189
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,039
But fate.. I couldn't fulfill
my wish as I couldn't afford it.

190
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,960
I wanted to do Masters degree.

191
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,240
Why are you so formal with me?

192
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,519
Why don't you address me informally?

193
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,480
What are you saying?

194
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,080
Kusum, listen to me.

195
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,159
C'mon listen to me.

196
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,720
Sir..

197
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,559
Akshay!

198
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,519
What brings you here in the afternoon?

199
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,240
I want some money.
- Money?

200
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,440
Come and sit here.

201
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,759
Take a seat.

202
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,279
You won't get money so easily.

203
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,759
There are some terms
and conditions to get money.

204
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,639
How many terms and conditions
will you impose, sir?

205
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,240
I'm already burdened
with terms and conditions.

206
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,639
You don't have any other option.

207
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,639
How can you disregard your fate?

208
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,320
How much do you want?

209
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,320
Well.. 500 will be enough.

210
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,799
500? That's a lot.

211
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,799
How will you return the money?
- I'll gradually return it.

212
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,079
You already owe me a lot.

213
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,720
Do something. Pawn your house with me.

214
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,240
Where will I stay if I pawn my house?

215
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,359
How can I say?

216
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,480
You won't get money
unless you pawn your house.

217
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,440
Okay, as you wish.

218
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,279
I don't know what else
I'll have to do for some food.

219
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,119
What are you saying, Akshay?

220
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,279
You're a Brahmin.

221
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,640
This kind of words doesn't suit you.

222
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
Okay, do something.

223
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,559
Come with the documents of
your house tomorrow and take the money.

224
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,880
Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

225
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,599
Where's the money?

226
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,200
He didn't pay.

227
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,960
Why did I send you there?

228
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,079
You're good for nothing.

229
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,640
You hog all day but fail to do any work.

230
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,599
What could I do?

231
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,440
Jaga's wife came to hit me
with the scimitar when I asked to pay.

232
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,599
Jaga's wife attacked
you and you ran away scared.

233
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,039
Idiot, you can't do any task properly.

234
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,960
What do I don't do for you?

235
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,799
Scoundrel! Rascal!

236
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,240
Jaga's wife managed to scare
you and now you're venting out at me.

237
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,400
Let me finish.
- What do you want to say?

238
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
What else do you've to say?

239
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,000
Listen to me. It's the first
time that I saw Jaga's wife.

240
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,200
She's very beautiful.

241
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,480
What are you saying? Beautiful..

242
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,079
Right.

243
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,079
Why didn't you say it before?

244
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,039
Then I must think something
about Jaga's wife.

245
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,279
"Even after walking a long distance.."

246
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:59,200
"..I couldn't meet you."

247
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:08,559
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

248
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,119
"Even after walking a long distance.."

249
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,759
"..I couldn't meet you."

250
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:28,839
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

251
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,359
What do you think about this, grandson?

252
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,839
Do I've to share my opinion on this?

253
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,200
Yes, the entire matter
has been put up for voting.

254
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,799
Then I must give my vote.

255
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:50,920
Right.

256
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,240
My vote goes for you.

257
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,640
What are you saying?

258
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,440
This is going to lead to a civil war.

259
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,640
Why?

260
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,279
Your mom and dad won't spare me.

261
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,319
What you're doing is absolutely correct.

262
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
Let mom and dad say anything..

263
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,400
..I'm always with you.

264
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,079
You're not doing anything wrong.

265
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm always with you.

266
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,680
Fantastic!

267
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,799
This is what I expected from you.

268
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,920
But, I don't know why your
dad is not ready to understand.

269
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,440
Dad will understand
if you try to convince him.

270
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,839
No..no, he won't.

271
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,759
If he would then he wouldn't
have turned it into a battle of ego.

272
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,359
What kind of ego?

273
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,720
If a writer like you writes
on this topic it's going to attract..

274
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,240
..the attention of the people.

275
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,440
The book is going to sell very well.

276
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,200
You'll get a huge sum as royalty.

277
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,319
The money will help in
the education of their children.

278
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,400
It's a great thought.
You're great, grandpa.

279
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,759
I could've never thought of this idea.

280
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:08,480
Your support has increased my strength.

281
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,279
You're my support.

282
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,240
You're my strength.

283
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,119
Don't keep quiet, Parul.
Go and tell auntie.

284
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,839
Auntie will be angry.

285
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,480
Strange! Will you keep quiet?

286
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,880
Don't you know how that man is?

287
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,720
He's a rascal.

288
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,119
Can he do anything just
because he gives money?

289
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,720
Aren't we humans?

290
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,960
You may say anything but
I can't tell auntie anything.

291
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,319
What's this, Parul?

292
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,240
The man tortures you so badly.

293
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,920
Will you quietly accept his tortures?

294
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,359
I wouldn't have accepted
it if I was in her place.

295
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,160
I would've broken his bones.

296
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,720
Does he think he owns us just
because he's paying for our services?

297
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,440
Yes, he owns us.

298
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,160
What do we have?

299
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,880
Do we've any self-respect or reputation?

300
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,319
You can't keep quiet, Parul
or his tortures will keep increasing.

301
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Yes, right.

302
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,759
Jaba is right.

303
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,240
Let's go and talk to auntie today.

304
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,559
No..no.. I can't do it.

305
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,119
The business is not so good.
Auntie is already furious.

306
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,559
If I approach her with complaints.
She'll finish me.

307
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,119
Oh no!

308
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Listen.. if your clients keep
decreasing then I'll throw all of you out.

309
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,319
I repeatedly tell you to behave nicely
with the clients but none of you do it.

310
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,279
You've nothing to say now.

311
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,400
It's so difficult to run the business.

312
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,039
And on top of that
I've to bear your tantrums.

313
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,799
What happened? Why are you quiet?

314
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,279
Answer me.

315
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,720
What will she say?
- Why? Is she dumb?

316
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,880
Listen to her. Parul has something to say.

317
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,240
Who are you?

318
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,559
Have you taken her responsibility?

319
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,880
Auntie, you don't
know how evil the man is.

320
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
He misbehaves with Parul.

321
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,000
Pious lady!
Should he behave nicely with her?

322
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,640
Why are you abusing me?

323
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,359
Do you know what he does?

324
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,880
He burns her with cigarette stubs.

325
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,599
He speaks in abusive language
and misbehaves with her. Got it?

326
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,920
Yes, it's the fact auntie.

327
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,799
Show her. Parul, show it to auntie.

328
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,079
Oh God!

329
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,680
Let him come today.
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

330
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,240
Auntie, this is why I was saying that..

331
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,799
..she didn't misbehave without a reason.

332
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,839
Why didn't you tell me before?

333
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,920
I was scared.

334
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,079
Why were you scared?

335
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,559
Am I a wild animal
that I'm going to kill you?

336
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,920
No.

337
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,200
Let him come today.

338
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,079
Call me when he comes.

339
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,440
Let me see what he does.

340
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,240
Auntie, come out quickly.

341
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,920
We've a problem.

342
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
What happened?

343
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,319
Padma auntie is bleeding from the mouth.
- What?

344
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,480
Come on, let's go.

345
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,599
Dad, I'm going to the temple.
- Okay, go.

346
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,039
I'll come back and cook for you.

347
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,480
There isn't enough rice grains at home.
- Oh! There's no rice grains.

348
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,960
Okay. Let me see what I can arrange. Go.
- Okay.

349
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,200
Go.
- Okay.

350
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,759
Bunch of bananas.

351
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,079
Kusum, is your father at home?

352
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,559
Yes, he's inside, go.
- Okay.

353
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,480
Who's the girl?

354
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,039
Akshay Chakroborty's daughter.

355
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,039
Is she Akshay's daughter?
- Yes, sir.

356
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,599
Why didn't I notice her before?
- How can I say, sir?

357
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
Who else will tell me?

358
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,799
You hog all day and do nothing. Rascal!

359
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,119
Sir, don't insult me all the time.

360
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,319
How dare you argue with me?

361
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
You're talking in English with me?

362
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,200
Why didn't I notice her before?

363
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,039
Akshay's daughter.

364
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,119
I must think about her now.

365
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,279
Come on.

366
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,839
Akshay da..

367
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,920
Masood, come. Be seated. Where..

368
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,240
Here it is.

369
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,599
Here you go. Sit down.

370
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,359
I'm missing my native place a lot, Masood.

371
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,119
What's the use of thinking about it?
Will you get back anything?

372
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,039
I know and understand everything
but I can't accept it.

373
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,759
Be strong.

374
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,160
Don't think about it or you'll feel hurt.

375
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,119
Yes, it's very painful Masood.

376
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,039
Just imagine our life in our native place.

377
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,440
A well settled life.

378
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,200
Pond full of fish.

379
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,160
Fields filled with crops.

380
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,079
Fish cooked by wife.

381
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,039
Everything is a past now.

382
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,640
Forget it. Let me tell you why I've come.

383
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,799
The state legislature
election is approaching.

384
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,279
Our party has managed to
bring about a wind of change.

385
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,440
Wind of change. Right?

386
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,319
The ruling party has mislead
the people for 34 years.

387
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,359
People have woken up.

388
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,279
They want a new government.

389
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,759
They want to start fresh.

390
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,880
How does it matter to me?

391
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,799
I'll stay where I was.

392
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,680
You're wrong.

393
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,400
If this change comes about
you'll get a new lease of life.

394
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,119
Wrong. Yes, it's my mistake.

395
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,759
You'll be busy with
election and power and..

396
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:08,920
..poor people will live with false hopes.

397
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,640
You'll get a new life, Akshay da.

398
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,599
We want your support, Akshay da.

399
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,440
You want us to fight in an empty stomach?

400
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,119
Well-said.

401
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,759
Auntie is over there. Go and meet her.

402
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Who is it?

403
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,039
Oh! What brings you here at this age?

404
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,400
You're in the last phase of your life.

405
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,000
You should be busy praying..

406
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
..what brings you here?

407
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,440
Well-said.

408
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,240
Don't you've a family?

409
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,200
If I say I've everybody.

410
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,759
That's what I mean.

411
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,759
Please make it clear.

412
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,640
What do you want?

413
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,640
What's your purpose of visit?

414
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,119
I'm a writer.

415
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,000
I write stories and novels. Got it?

416
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,799
Oh! Then..

417
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,119
I want to experience your life
first hand and write a story on it.

418
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,319
What are you saying? Story? A book on us?

419
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,079
Yes. Whatever you think.

420
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,279
Please make it clear.

421
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,359
Tell me what you exactly want.

422
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,759
I want to write a new kind
of story based on your life.

423
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,440
A new type of novel.

424
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,680
Do I need to make it clearer?
- I got it but..

425
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,759
What?

426
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,759
Why do you want to write a story on us?

427
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:53,240
I want to witness your
life and write story based on it.

428
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,279
Will people buy your book and read it?
- Of course.

429
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,799
What are you saying? Good.

430
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,599
But, you won't get
anything free of cost here.

431
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
You must spend money.

432
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,039
You don't have to worry about it.

433
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,319
Dad..

434
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,720
Why are you shivering?

435
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,480
You've high temperature.

436
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,279
Shall I call the doctor?
- No.. no.. the doctor wont' come.

437
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,839
The doctor won't come unless you pay him.

438
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,799
Then.. shall I go to sir for help?

439
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,640
No..no.. don't go anywhere. Stay here.

440
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,400
I'll cover myself with
this blanket and go to sleep.

441
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,039
There's exam at school today.

442
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,640
The children will be waiting for me.

443
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,839
Who will cook for them if I don't go?

444
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,759
You're right.

445
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:52,000
We manage all expenses with your salary.

446
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,960
You cook and I..

447
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,880
Forget it.

448
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,960
I'll come back soon.

449
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,599
Have you eaten anything?
- I've had puffed rice.

450
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,559
Take care. Got it?
- Yes.

451
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,000
Disloyal. Disloyal, got it?
All of them are disloyal.

452
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,319
I do so much for them yet
they criticize me behind my back.

453
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Auntie..

454
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,960
Give me some money.

455
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,359
Why? Why do you need money?

456
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,319
Padma auntie isn't keeping well.

457
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,960
I'll consult a doctor.

458
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,400
I don't think she'll survive.

459
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,240
Padma? What relation do you have with her?

460
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,200
What's our relation?

461
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,640
I don't know.

462
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,160
But she resembles my mother.

463
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,720
Okay. Okay. I'll give you money.

464
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
You don't have to fake tears.

465
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,599
I must do something for them.

466
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,599
I can't imagine that people
can live a life like this.

467
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:29,000
"Yet I dream that you're always with me."

468
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:39,039
"You were with me and you'll
always be there in my feelings."

469
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:49,599
"Yet I dream that you're always with me."

470
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,640
"You were with me and you'll
always be there in my feelings."

471
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:06,119
"Somewhere amidst dreams
and reality in my heart."

472
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,679
What's up? Where are you going?

473
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,840
Are you going to the temple?

474
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,239
Be careful. You might meet wicked
people on the way, they can harm you.

475
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,440
You don't have to worry.

476
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,960
Yes, I have to as you're
going to be mine in future.

477
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,400
Please let me go.

478
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,639
I haven't kept you captive.

479
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,440
You're a free bird.

480
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Spread your wings and
fly wherever you wish to.

481
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,039
Rogue!

482
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,599
Did you call me, sir?
- Sir down.

483
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,039
Would you like to have something?
- No.

484
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,360
Why are you hesitating?

485
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,400
Naru, Akshay has come,
get some food for him.

486
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,880
Sir, please tell me why you called me.

487
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,159
I've thought a lot about you.

488
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,440
You owe me a lot of money.

489
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,039
It isn't possible for
you to pay back the loan.

490
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,719
I'll give you an idea which
will help you pay back the loan..

491
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,119
..without any problem.

492
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,599
Well.. what do you suggest?

493
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,239
Your daughter has grown up.

494
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,280
You've to get her married.

495
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,199
But, you can't afford her marriage.

496
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,960
The young men are also not trustworthy.

497
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,159
I suggest you do something.

498
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,719
What do you suggest, sir?

499
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,840
My wife died many years ago.

500
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,800
I don't have anybody to care for me.

501
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:57,239
So, after much thought I felt that
if you get your daughter married to me..

502
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,440
..it'll be good for both you and me.

503
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,320
What are you saying, sir?

504
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:14,719
Your want to marry my daughter?
- Yes.

505
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,719
I didn't..

506
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:24,440
Why? What's the problem?

507
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,320
I'll waive off your loans.

508
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,079
I'll also give you a good amount of money.

509
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,360
Think about it.

510
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,840
You're not going to lose anything.

511
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,159
Accept my proposal.

512
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,440
It'll be good for you.

513
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,000
No, sir. This is not acceptable.

514
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,920
I can't ruin my daughter's life.

515
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,119
Why are you saying that?

516
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,920
You're engulfed in
problems from all sides.

517
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,800
It's better that you get
your daughter married to me.

518
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,039
What are you saying, sir?

519
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,400
Are you taking advantage
of my helplessness?

520
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,440
What brings you to our place at this age?

521
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,920
Will you understand if I tell you?
- Why not?

522
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,599
I'll understand if you explain it.

523
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,239
Will you understand if I say that
I've come here for sake of literature?

524
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,920
No.. it's difficult to understand
what educated people like you mean.

525
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,079
I'm an illiterate woman.
I don't understand such complicated words.

526
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,880
It's okay if you don't wish to tell me

527
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,840
Yes, let's not discuss it now.

528
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,920
I'll share everything at the right time.

529
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,400
Tell me something..

530
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,400
..how many girls work for you?

531
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,119
What's their age?

532
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,599
How did they come here?

533
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,400
Hold on. You're in great rush.

534
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,440
Ask your questions one by one.

535
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,800
I don't remember everything.

536
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,559
There are many girls here.

537
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,079
Jaba, Julie, Parul.

538
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,920
They've come from different places.

539
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,440
There are different reasons
why they landed here.

540
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,239
Some of them came because they were needy.

541
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,760
Some landed here due to circumstances.

542
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,039
Some of them have willingly come here.

543
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,079
Do you want to hear the details?

544
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,320
Then listen to me, I'll tell you.

545
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
I'll start with Jaba.

546
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,360
Jaba came here with her husband.

547
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,119
Her husband sold her to me.

548
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,679
Dad.. dad.. you're here?

549
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,119
I was looking for you.
Let's go home.

550
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,239
Home? The home isn't
going to be ours for long.

551
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,639
What nonsense! I don't understand you.

552
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,159
Come on.

553
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,920
What's wrong with you?

554
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,119
Nothing.

555
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,960
Do you think you can hide from me?

556
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,679
It's clear that something is wrong.

557
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,880
No, my child. Don't worry about me.

558
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,719
I was thinking about you.
What will you do after I die?

559
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,800
Tell me.

560
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,320
What did your son say?

561
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,639
I want to know.
- You want to know?

562
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,599
I'll tell you.

563
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,719
You can't continue this.

564
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,400
I didn't get you.

565
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,559
It's not so complicated, it's very clear.

566
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,360
I don't like to talk in riddles.

567
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,760
How long will you live like this?

568
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,320
Am I bound to answer you?

569
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,119
Yes, you have to.

570
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,679
You live with us under the same roof.

571
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,119
So, you've to explain
each and every action of yours.

572
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
Okay, I'll tell you.

573
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,760
If you don't like my lifestyle
then you and daughter-in-law..

574
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,639
..can leave this house and go.

575
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:22,679
But, my grandson will stay
with me after he returns from America.

576
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,840
What nonsense!

577
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,960
Babai will go with us wherever we go.

578
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,239
Babai will lose his mind
if he stays with a man like you.

579
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,559
Whatever.. what do you want to say?

580
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,039
Is this your final decision?
- I don't know.

581
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,280
I don't want to say
anything in this regard.

582
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,559
I just want to say one thing.

583
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:56,960
What appears to be bad
may not actually be bad.

584
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,599
Try to understand this.

585
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,639
I've nothing more to say.

586
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
I don't understand you.

587
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:08,639
Dad, do whatever you
think is good for you.

588
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,480
We'll leave this house
as soon as possible.

589
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,280
Are you angry?

590
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,239
It won't make any difference to you.

591
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,159
You'll do what you feel like.

592
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,760
I don't know how to explain it to you.

593
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,280
What next? What happened next?

594
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,039
What else?

595
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,280
They decided to leave the house and go.

596
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,320
They haven't left yet,
I don't think they'll go.

597
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,639
Lata, tell me something.

598
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,800
Could he insult me if he knew the truth?

599
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:54,280
It's your mistake.

600
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,039
Why didn't you explain
everything to him clearly?

601
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,280
Sometimes I think that
I should've told him.

602
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:16,840
I think I should've told him everything.

603
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,079
I'll leave now.

604
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,719
Take care.
- Care?

605
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,440
Days get over and make way for night.

606
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,719
Somebody calls me from
amidst the darkness and says..

607
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,400
Come back.

608
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,880
Why are you staying there?

609
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,679
What's holding you back?

610
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,800
What's there for you?

611
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,360
It calls me repeatedly.

612
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,960
But, I won't die if I wish to.

613
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,400
What is this that you said just now?
Is it a poem?

614
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,199
No.

615
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,480
You won't understand it.
It's the story of life.

616
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,400
I'll leave now.

617
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,079
Madan, see sir off.

618
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,159
Dad, what did you tell him?

619
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:38,000
I was very clear about what I meant,
nothing complex about it.

620
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,840
What you did was wrong.

621
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,800
He's hurt.

622
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,639
Okay, I'll talk to him.

623
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,480
Shall I say something, dad?

624
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:51,679
Can't you stop going to the brothel?

625
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,599
No, that's not possible

626
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,400
His colleagues at the nursing
home were gossiping about this.

627
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,360
It's insulting to him.

628
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,159
But, you're not ready
to understand his problem.

629
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:06,760
But, why can't he explain
to them that I'm a socially aware..

630
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:13,320
..and socially responsible writer.

631
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,559
I've some duties and
responsibilities towards the society.

632
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,239
Can you disregard it, daughter-in-law?
- I know but..

633
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,480
There's no doubt in this.

634
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:30,800
Why don't understand that
I may have some personal thoughts.

635
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,239
Why are you paying
heed to what others say?

636
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,079
C'mon tell me.
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

637
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,280
Okay, I'll talk to him.

638
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,119
Yes, explain it to him.

639
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,639
What he's thinking isn't right.

640
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:57,440
After getting the insights into the
lives of girls like Lata, Jaba, Parul..

641
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:03,440
..I can't think of anything else.

642
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,679
I've to do a lot for them.

643
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,960
What do you think?

644
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,760
You don't consider others as humans.

645
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,159
Listen, times have changed.

646
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,559
Change yourself or you'll land in trouble.

647
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,760
You're talking a lot.

648
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:29,800
Do you know what I can do?

649
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,079
Why won't I?

650
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,239
You're exploiting the poor.

651
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,840
Allah will..

652
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,320
Are you threatening me?

653
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,360
If you think so then I'm threatening you.

654
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,760
You usurp the land
and houses of poor people.

655
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,079
You lend money to them on
interest and exploit their women.

656
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,760
This can't carry on for long.

657
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,280
Let me warn you.

658
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,400
Masood has become too smart.

659
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:07,400
I can't let him continue like this.

660
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
Naru inform Sajal.

661
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
Masood shouldn't live long.

662
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:23,760
He should be punished for threatening me.

663
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,199
Let's see what he can do.

664
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,400
Come with me.

665
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,119
What's the problem, Jaba?

666
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:34,880
You'll get a new life.

667
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,559
You won't understand my problem.

668
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,360
Nobody will understand anything.

669
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,199
She thinks only she knows everything.

670
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,440
Auntie, stop it.
I don't like this discussion.

671
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:43,719
Why don't you like it?

672
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,000
I spoke with the boy.

673
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,840
He seemed to be a nice boy.

674
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,440
He visits the brothel.

675
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,000
If he's a nice person then
why would he come to a brothel.

676
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:56,039
C'mon tell me, answer me.

677
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:04,880
You've a point but I feel
that he won't deceive you.

678
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,199
Tapan will keep you happy.

679
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,880
You may say anything
but I won't go anywhere.

680
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,119
I'll die here.

681
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,880
What are you saying?

682
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,039
So, you won't change your decision?

683
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,360
No. No. No. That's it.

684
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:35,840
Has she lost her mind?

685
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,599
Who misses an opportunity like this?

686
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,760
Tapan is a nice guy.

687
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,480
He would've kept Jaba happy.

688
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,320
Yes.. but, it's no use talking to her.

689
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,719
She won't change her mind.

690
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,440
But, Tapan wants to marry Jaba.

691
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,480
Will he wait so long?

692
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,480
The fruits of patience are always sweet.

693
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:03,920
Let's wait and see if the outcome is good.

694
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,960
The girl went to bed
without eating anything.

695
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,840
I can't even feed my only child.

696
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,360
Sometimes I feel like committing suicide.

697
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:50,440
But, I'm scared what
she'll do after I die.

698
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,159
What's the use of staying alive?

699
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:05,280
What could you give your
daughter in your lifetime?

700
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,880
Happiness, peace of mind, wealth..

701
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,320
..you could give her nothing.
- I know.

702
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:16,400
Stop it, don't remind me.

703
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,199
I know that I'm useless poor father.

704
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:32,119
Yet sometimes I feel that if I'm alive
I can save her from the ferocious men.

705
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:33,480
No, you can't.

706
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,599
You can never do it.

707
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,559
That's because you're greedy.

708
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:45,559
I know what you'll do with
your daughter for your benefit.

709
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,000
Stop it. Please don't remind
me of all this. It makes me weak.

710
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,239
It breaks my heart.

711
00:49:54,599 --> 00:50:00,880
I hope no father in this world is like me.

712
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,480
Don't pretend.

713
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,840
Stop pretending and do your job.

714
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:09,760
Don't expose your weakness.

715
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,599
Either do or die.

716
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,400
You've to take a decision. Got it?

717
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:44,480
My grandson is coming from
America to take me with him.

718
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,840
What? Will you go to America?

719
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,039
That's far away.
- Yes, it's far away.

720
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,199
How will you go there?
- How else? By airplane.

721
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,159
That's awesome.

722
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,000
Won't you feel sad to leave us?

723
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,440
Yes, I'll but that'll
be a temporary feeling.

724
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,440
Everything will be fine after some time.

725
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,800
Are you feeling bad that I
didn't say something to please you?

726
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,760
No..no.. we're fallen women..
we're always ignored.

727
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,480
Who thinks about us?

728
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,239
You've become emotional.

729
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:44,880
No..I won't go.
I won't leave you all and go.

730
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,599
What will you have tea or cold drink?
- Get tea for me.

731
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,079
Madhu, get a cup of tea.

732
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:01,119
I don't think we'll meet again.
- Why?

733
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,960
My father is getting me married.
- What? With whom?

734
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,119
Kanai Samanta.

735
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,880
What? Have your father lost his mind?

736
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,880
How could you agree to this proposal?

737
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,239
What else could I do?
I had no other option.

738
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,960
This is not done.

739
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:22,079
I'll speak with your dad.

740
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,679
It isn't going to help.

741
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,840
That's not done.

742
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:37,800
I'll speak with Kanai Samanta and
tell him that he can't do this because..

743
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,320
..I love you.

744
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,320
What are you saying, Kusum?

745
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:44,159
Yes, Masood uncle.

746
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,360
I don't think I can
retain my job in school.

747
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,000
I don't know how we'll
manage the expenses.

748
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,039
Let me see what I can do.
I've to do something.

749
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,840
What will you do if
you lose the job suddenly?

750
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:58,440
What can you do?

751
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,599
You already have your problems.

752
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,159
So what?

753
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,000
Won't I support people who're needy?

754
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:08,320
Don't worry, my child. I'll do something.

755
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,559
Uncle, don't tell my father
that I shared this problem with you.

756
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:13,440
He'll feel hurt.

757
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,559
Who did this?
- Kanai Samanta.

758
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,719
Kanai?
- Yes.

759
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:21,760
What will he gain?

760
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:25,239
He wants to marry me.
- What?

761
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,079
Yes, uncle.

762
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,559
That's why he's using
his influence against me.

763
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,599
I don't know what's in my fate.

764
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,599
People are becoming evil.

765
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:42,119
Sir..

766
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,920
I accept your proposal.

767
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,480
That's very good.

768
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:04,599
But, I've a condition.
- What is it?

769
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:11,280
You've to marry my daughter.

770
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:14,079
Why should I have any problem with it?
That's good.

771
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,079
Make arrangements,
I'll pay for the expenses.

772
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,079
No need for a grand wedding.

773
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:26,320
I'll get you married
in front of the deity.

774
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,920
Okay, no problem.

775
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:34,599
How much money will you give me?

776
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:35,960
How much do you want?

777
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,039
What?

778
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,360
What?

779
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:58,119
5000? 50000? 500000?

780
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,360
Tell me. Please say something.

781
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,119
Speak up.

782
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,679
Horrific news!

783
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,079
A father sold of his
daughter due to poverty.

784
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,719
This is unimaginable.

785
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:41,639
What did you think?

786
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,360
How can I leave my father?

787
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,840
Look ahead, your past is dark.

788
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,760
We'll settle down and live happily.

789
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:56,760
What has your father done for you?

790
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,960
Which wish of yours has he fulfilled?

791
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:01,360
Why are you feeling so sad to leave him?

792
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:06,039
Kusum, your dad wants to sell you.

793
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,039
He wants to satiate his hunger
with the money he earns after selling you.

794
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:11,719
And you're feeling so sad for him.

795
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,039
Kusum, I'll marry you
and settle down with you.

796
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:21,480
How can I leave my father alone?

797
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,519
Okay, do what you think is good for you.

798
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,039
I'll never give you any advice.

799
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:33,320
I'll never come to say anything.

800
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,840
Are you a human or an animal?

801
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,639
I don't get you.

802
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,320
I made it very clear
and yet you can't understand.

803
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,440
How can you call me an animal?

804
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,159
Don't you feel ashamed to sexually
exploit a girl who's your daughter's age?

805
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,119
So, this is what you mean. Now I get it.

806
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:10,480
You're Akshay's
daughter's..well whatever..

807
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,800
Can you afford to marry
Kusum and keep her happy?

808
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,800
That's my problem.

809
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,679
You don't have to think about it.

810
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,119
Yes, I've to think about it.

811
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:21,920
Akshay wants his daughter to be happy.

812
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:24,719
It won't be possible if she marries you.

813
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,159
Do you think Kusum will
be happy if she marries..

814
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,079
..an old man like you?

815
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:31,519
Yes, of course she'll be happy.

816
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:33,800
What can you give her?

817
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,960
I'll give her everything.

818
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:38,480
Money, ornaments, clothes, children.
Everything.

819
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,480
Shame on you.
How can you think of all this?

820
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,760
Don't ignore the facts.

821
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,159
Get out of Kusum's life,
I'll give you a good amount of money.

822
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,639
Your father is not well.

823
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,320
Get him treated.

824
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:55,000
Your residence is in a dilapidated state.

825
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,519
Get it repaired.

826
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,880
I'll make you a permanent
teacher in the school.

827
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,119
You don't have to worry about your future.

828
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:03,440
You'll get a good salary.

829
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
What will you get if you love Kusum?

830
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,440
Think about my proposal. Think about it.

831
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:10,480
But..

832
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,840
You shouldn't have any doubts.
Just imagine what you'll get.

833
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,599
Your life will be settled.

834
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,079
Don't lose this opportunity.

835
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,159
Think about it and tell me. Bye.

836
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,639
If Mr. Samanta keeps his word then..

837
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:38,199
..but I love Kusum..
I can't take a decision.

838
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,440
What shall I do?

839
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,480
I'm confused.

840
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:09,559
"The relentless tears
haven't melted your heart."

841
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:19,840
"I've pondered upon it several
times but didn't get an answer."

842
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:29,239
"The relentless tears
haven't melted your heart."

843
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:39,199
"I've pondered upon it several
times but didn't get an answer."

844
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,679
"Even after walking a long distance.."

845
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:50,199
"..I couldn't meet you."

846
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:59,719
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

847
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,239
I don't have the right to live.

848
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,320
I don't have the right to live.

849
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:14,400
No, I don't have the right to live.

850
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:25,320
Come. Come in.

851
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:29,559
Come.

852
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,159
Come in. Come.

853
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,199
Don't worry.
This place belongs to me. Come.

854
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,119
Come and give the full amount tomorrow.

855
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:42,320
I hope I don't have to call again.
Hang up now.

856
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:45,639
What's up, Lata?
Come in.

857
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:48,719
How are you?

858
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,119
Mr. Samanta.

859
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,519
What brings you here after so long?

860
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,119
Where were you all this while?

861
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,239
You've forgotten us.
- No. How can I forget you?

862
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,079
Who is she?

863
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,840
A new bird.

864
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,199
See if you like her.

865
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,920
How can I dislike your choice?

866
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,440
What shall I do with her?

867
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,679
Will you keep her here?

868
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,960
Or do you've any other plans for her?

869
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:23,000
No.. she'll stay here for the time being.

870
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:25,599
She's very beautiful.

871
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:28,480
What's her name?
- Kusum.

872
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,880
That's a beautiful name.

873
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:34,039
Why are you so uncomfortable?

874
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,920
Are you feeling sad?

875
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:44,519
Don't worry,
everything will be fine after some time.

876
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:46,440
She's missing her father.

877
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,400
From where did you get her, Mr. Samanta?

878
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,559
I had to toil hard to get her.
- Okay.

879
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,400
Madhu! Hey Madhu. Take her inside.

880
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:06,400
Madhu is not here.

881
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,239
You sent him to the market.

882
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,480
What do you have to say?

883
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,039
Take her with you.

884
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:14,599
Where?
- To the attic.

885
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,840
Take her.

886
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,800
Girl, come with me.
- No.

887
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:20,159
Come on.
- No.

888
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,360
Everybody behaves like
this in the beginning.

889
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,880
You'll feel comfortable after some time.

890
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,800
Come on.
- No.

891
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,480
Why are you sacred? Come with me.

892
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:29,760
No, leave me.

893
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,079
Come on. Don't throw tantrums,
come with me.

894
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:33,360
Come with me. I say, come.
- Leave me.

895
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,599
She's new here, she's scared.

896
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,039
She'll be fine after some time.

897
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:38,639
Leave me.

898
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,559
Come on, girl. You've to come.
- Leave me.

899
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:43,679
Are you new here?

900
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,880
What's your name?

901
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:46,719
You're beautiful.

902
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,559
Where are you from?

903
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:50,800
Who's there in your family?

904
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,199
Didn't you get any other place to go?

905
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,679
Why did you come here?

906
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,320
Didn't you find a bottle of
poison or kerosene to commit suicide?

907
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,519
Jaba di, auntie won't spare you
if she hears all this. Let me warn you.

908
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,400
I know the kind of life I'm living.

909
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:08,679
I'm almost dead.

910
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,719
How can she kill me?

911
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:14,480
Auntie is not earning
well with our services.

912
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,840
So, she has brought new girls.

913
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,199
What about Fuli?

914
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,920
Fuli's days are over.

915
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,719
She may have to leave
this place very soon.

916
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,079
It means that one day we will also be..

917
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,440
Stop it! I don't want
to think about the future.

918
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:34,639
Go and mind your business.

919
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:36,320
Come with me.

920
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,480
C'mon, you've to go. Come with me.

921
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,199
Let's go.

922
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:55,840
This heart of yours.

923
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:02,199
May it be mine.

924
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:04,840
This heart of mine.

925
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:09,400
May it be yours.

926
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,360
See...

927
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:33,119
Auntie, Kusum is not opening her door.

928
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:34,400
Why? What happened?

929
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,559
Mayna has been calling
her for a long time.

930
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,679
I don't know why Kusum
is not opening the door.

931
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,880
I think she is sleeping.

932
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:45,599
No, I saw her sitting on
the floor through the window.

933
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:47,519
She won't open the door unless you go.

934
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,960
What a problem!

935
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:52,159
Let's go.
- Let's go.

936
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,079
I've to face all the problems.

937
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:58,159
I'll have to go and
see what's wrong with her.

938
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,639
Let's go.

939
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:06,360
Sir, if a man like Kanai
Samanta wins the election..

940
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:09,440
..then you can't live peacefully.

941
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,760
I can understand everything, Masood.

942
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,320
But, do we've the strength
to fight against that man?

943
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,320
We've to organize ourselves.

944
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:19,559
We've to be one.

945
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,199
We can't defeat him unless we unite.

946
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,679
What's wrong?

947
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:35,840
What happened?

948
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,880
What has happened?
Won't you speak with me?

949
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,840
How will I understand your
problem if you don't speak with me?

950
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,920
What happened? Tell me.

951
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,519
I'm losing my temper.

952
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,039
You can't blame me if I hit you.
- I don't want to stay here.

953
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:56,960
What do you mean?

954
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,239
What do you mean by you won't stay here?

955
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,000
I don't like to stay here.

956
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,360
You've to adjust here even
if you don't like the place.

957
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:06,880
I'll go away from here.

958
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,480
Forget it. C'mon forget it.

959
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:16,559
100000 rupees. I gave 100000 rupees to Mr.
Samanta for you.

960
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:17,920
Got it?

961
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,639
You can't go from here.

962
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,519
You've to stay here.

963
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:27,599
I'm missing my father a lot.

964
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,199
I also missed my family in the beginning.

965
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,639
But, I gradually got used to this place.

966
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:37,639
The same will happen with you.

967
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,559
You'll also get accustomed to this place.

968
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,760
You won't face any problem.

969
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,599
You'll think only of yourself.

970
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:48,519
Sister.. I don't want to stay here.

971
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,400
Is there no way to get out of here?

972
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,960
You can't do that, you've to adjust here.

973
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:02,679
Don't you understand that
this world is a tough place?

974
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,199
It's very tough.

975
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,679
But, I can't live like this.

976
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:13,199
I can't accept it..
I can't accept it, sister.

977
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:19,519
I can understand your feelings.

978
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,519
But, the girl who
comes here can't go back.

979
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,400
She has to spend her entire life here.

980
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,599
You've to do the same.

981
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,840
So, I suggest that
you adjust to this place.

982
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,679
The name of the new
story will be 'Kusumlata'

983
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,800
It's a good name.

984
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,639
The lives of two girls
have merged and become one.

985
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:52,719
Why did I enter their world?

986
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,679
For what? For whom?

987
01:07:56,679 --> 01:07:59,400
Dad, you're a renowned writer.

988
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:04,079
I can't accept the fact
that you'll visit the brothel..

989
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:06,360
..for your new story.

990
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,360
This is impractical.

991
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:12,480
What do you want?

992
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:20,119
Mom was tired of your
behavior and left you.

993
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:22,039
You're selfish.

994
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,079
You've always thought about yourself.

995
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,680
You were never interested
in any family matter.

996
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,399
I never accepted you.

997
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,079
Mom was helpless and she left you.

998
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,039
I can't stay here..

999
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,600
You said these words so easily.

1000
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,840
I wish I could explain
everything to you then maybe..

1001
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,119
Sashwata, I loved your mother. She..

1002
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,920
No.. your words have hurt me.

1003
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,199
Am I really selfish?

1004
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,399
I don't know.

1005
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:20,520
Well.. how will Lata and Kusum's life end?

1006
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:26,960
How will the spend the
last days of their life?

1007
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,960
Sir, I'm useless to you.

1008
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,319
Then why do you come here?

1009
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,600
Your son insults you a lot.

1010
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,960
I maybe a prostitute.

1011
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,239
But, I feel bad.

1012
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,600
My emotions are not yet dead.

1013
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:55,800
Keep quiet. You've spoken a lot.

1014
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,359
I don't come here for you.

1015
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:06,479
I come here in search
of the woman I've lost forever.

1016
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,600
I would've asked you something
only if you didn't mind.

1017
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,399
Who are you talking about?
Who has got lost?

1018
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:16,640
Whom are you searching?

1019
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,840
Please tell me.

1020
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:21,880
Do you know everything?

1021
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:25,000
Then why do you interfere?

1022
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:01,640
My father risked his life and came here.

1023
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,399
They killed my mother
and played with her blood.

1024
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,840
The riots were fierce.

1025
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:17,079
I was very small and I don't
remember everything clearly.

1026
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,720
I heard the details later from my dad.

1027
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,159
What happened after
you came to this country?

1028
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,760
Another struggle began.

1029
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:30,439
We were refugees in the beginning but..

1030
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:35,239
..after some time my dad got
a job as a priest with Dulal uncle's help.

1031
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:38,039
But, he earned very small amount.

1032
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:41,720
Ours was a small family of two people..

1033
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:43,439
..we somehow managed the expenses.

1034
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,119
I completed my education
with much difficulty, sister.

1035
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:50,920
Why didn't you find a job for yourself?

1036
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,800
I couldn't get a job.

1037
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:59,920
I had lot of dreams
but reality is very tough.

1038
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:04,800
Didn't you have a man who loved you?

1039
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:10,560
Yes, I had. He gave me
hopes and encouraged me to dream.

1040
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,920
What next?

1041
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,399
Everything was a farce.

1042
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,640
He backed out when he
had to take my responsibility.

1043
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,840
Love has no value in
the life of women like us.

1044
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,880
Money. Money, greed for money.

1045
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,079
He didn't have any self-esteem.

1046
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,199
He was greedy.

1047
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,600
He surrendered to his greed.

1048
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:48,760
How did you get trapped by Mr. Samanta?

1049
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:50,840
He's the main culprit.

1050
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,000
He has destroyed my life.

1051
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:58,239
I know. He's a rascal.

1052
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,600
My father got us married
in the presence of the deity.

1053
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:10,800
He promised to keep me
happy but he brought me here.

1054
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,880
This meeting has been
called in connection..

1055
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,399
..to the upcoming State
legislature election.

1056
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:21,359
You're living a poverty ridden life,
but not anymore.

1057
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:26,119
That's because our party
has brought about a wind of change.

1058
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:30,960
The wind of change has inspired
the people to demand a new government.

1059
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,840
People want to start their life afresh.

1060
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,359
They want enough food to eat.

1061
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:40,119
Friends, so I want to say that..

1062
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:48,640
..vote for our candidates
and help them win.

1063
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,520
Help our party gain a strong foothold.

1064
01:13:57,159 --> 01:13:58,279
Lata..

1065
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:01,439
What has happened to you?

1066
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:05,000
Why are you standing quietly?
- No.

1067
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,960
You can't hide your feelings from me.

1068
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,000
I'm not feeling good.

1069
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
Why? What happened?

1070
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,560
Your business is doing well.

1071
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:24,760
You've got new girls.

1072
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,159
Your clients have increased.

1073
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,000
It's not about it.
It's a different problem.

1074
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:32,279
What's the matter?

1075
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:34,760
You've always been straightforward.

1076
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,239
Why are you talking in riddles now?

1077
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,520
The new girl who has come here.. Kusum..

1078
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,239
What did she do?
- She didn't do anything.

1079
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,319
I heard her story.
- Oh!

1080
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:52,319
And it reminded you of your life.

1081
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:56,000
Share your story with me.

1082
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,640
Do you want to hear it?
- hmm..

1083
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:00,199
What will you hear?

1084
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,520
I was born in a poor family.

1085
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:10,279
Father, mother and small siblings.

1086
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,600
It was difficult to earn
enough food for the family.

1087
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:19,479
My father came home drunk
at night and thrashed my mother.

1088
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:24,479
My small siblings would
cry loudly because of hunger.

1089
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,600
I was very young at that time.

1090
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,279
Around 15-17 years old.

1091
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,600
A man came and said that there
was a good job for me in Kolkata.

1092
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,800
I trusted him.

1093
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:43,199
He brought me here.

1094
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:45,960
And since then I've been living here.

1095
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,239
I don't know for how long I've been here.

1096
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,159
You never went back?

1097
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,640
I couldn't go back home.

1098
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,680
My father would come
and take money from me.

1099
01:15:58,119 --> 01:16:03,039
In the first year I went with
my brother to visit the puja pandal.

1100
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:05,439
But the villagers rushed towards me.

1101
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,800
They shouted and said..

1102
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,199
Prostitute,
you've made the place of worship impure.

1103
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,159
Get out. Get out of the village.

1104
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:18,560
I missed my siblings a lot.

1105
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:20,279
What can you do about it?

1106
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,600
This is the final thing in your life.

1107
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,119
You've nothing else.

1108
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,279
You've to accept the truth.

1109
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,439
That's right.

1110
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:36,840
Sometimes I want to meet my mother..

1111
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,479
..she loved me a lot.

1112
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,960
I don't even know if she's alive.

1113
01:16:49,159 --> 01:16:52,439
Sir, what you did for
some money is not at all right.

1114
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,199
Is money the only thing in life?

1115
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,720
Don't trust and love have any value?

1116
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,520
You're right, Masood.

1117
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,800
I made a mistake. I sinned.

1118
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:11,000
No..no.. I'm a teacher.

1119
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,920
As a teacher how could I..
But..

1120
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,479
You shouldn't have any more doubts.

1121
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,520
Kanai Samanta sold Kusum
in a red light area in the city.

1122
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:23,560
You've to rescue her.

1123
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,119
He has sold her?

1124
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:26,680
What are you saying?

1125
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,560
Has Kanai Samanta sold her in the city?

1126
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,039
I've all the information.

1127
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:33,600
I'll go to the city today to meet her.

1128
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,560
I'll also go with you.
- No.

1129
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,239
If Kusum agrees to come back
then only I'll take you with me.

1130
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:42,119
Where will you search her in the city?

1131
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,800
I'm into politics, brother.

1132
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,119
I've all the information.

1133
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,119
I'll find her by any means.

1134
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,239
Will she come back?

1135
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,239
Will I be able to stand before her?

1136
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,319
I can't think of a solution.

1137
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,000
Why can't you?

1138
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:01,159
You've learnt from your mistake.

1139
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,680
How many people do that?

1140
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,119
This is humanity.

1141
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,119
When will you come back?
- Tomorrow.

1142
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:09,760
I'll wait for you with lot of hope.

1143
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:12,439
I'll wait with lot of hope.

1144
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,720
You've to come back with good news.

1145
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:21,319
I want to repent for my sin.
I want to repent.

1146
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:09,760
Are you feeling bad because
you didn't expect these words from me?

1147
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:15,439
No, I won't go.

1148
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:20,079
I'll never leave you and go.

1149
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,520
Here!

1150
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:42,800
Who gave it?
- Sir.

1151
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,359
I understand that but which sir.

1152
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,479
The old man who comes to meet auntie.

1153
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:50,359
Oh!

1154
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,640
Why did you give it to me?

1155
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:53,800
Doesn't auntie know about it?

1156
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,720
Yes, he gave it in front of auntie.

1157
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,560
Oh!

1158
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,359
Auntie is calling you.
- Oh no!

1159
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:02,960
She'll start again.

1160
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,520
I told her that I won't leave
this place and go. I won't go..

1161
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,760
You'll be get respite. You'll get respite.

1162
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:11,800
What'll you get in this life?
Do you call this life?

1163
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,359
Can you help me with this address?

1164
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:13,840
Sir, please see this address.

1165
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,319
So, you want to go to Sonagachi?

1166
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:18,079
Take left and go straight.
- Thank you.

1167
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,720
Thank you.
- Okay.

1168
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,520
Please help me with this address?

1169
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,880
524B. That's my address.

1170
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:14,760
Whom do you wish to meet?
- Lata auntie.

1171
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,479
She's our auntie.
Come with me. Come.

1172
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,119
Lata auntie.. Lata auntie.. Lata auntie.

1173
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,640
See what you can do.

1174
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:31,960
Auntie..

1175
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:34,880
Hang up now. Somebody has come.
- Auntie..

1176
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,560
This gentleman wants to meet you.

1177
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,880
Hello.
- Hello.

1178
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:40,880
Please be seated.

1179
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,960
Go and finish your work.

1180
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,720
Auntie, will you give me some money?

1181
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,880
Why? Is Padma auntie sick?

1182
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:55,960
You want to take her to the doctor. Right?

1183
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,359
You're too much. Take this.

1184
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,760
Take her to Dr.
Dutta. He's a very good doctor.

1185
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,199
She'll get well soon.

1186
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,439
You'll be very happy.

1187
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,119
I assure you that you'll be happy.

1188
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:16,439
Okay. You don't have to pretend.
- You'll be very happy.

1189
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,000
Go. C'mon go.
- You'll be very happy.

1190
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,800
Whom do you want?
- Kusum.

1191
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,199
What are you saying?

1192
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:28,279
Kusum? She hasn't started to work yet.

1193
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,159
I've come here with a different purpose.

1194
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,720
Oh God! That's funny.

1195
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:36,000
People come to Sonagachi
for only one thing.

1196
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:39,880
If you listen to me carefully
then it'll be good for me.

1197
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,279
Okay, tell me.

1198
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:44,159
Kusum loved a boy.
- I know.

1199
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,840
The boy ditched her and went away.

1200
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,720
He's a coward.

1201
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,720
The men are disloyal.

1202
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,000
They fake love, they encourage girls..

1203
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:00,880
..to dream and then they ditch them.

1204
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,880
It's the same story everywhere.

1205
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,520
The story here is different.

1206
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,640
What?

1207
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:10,680
Does the teacher wants to take Kusum back?

1208
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:13,239
Will he take her from this muck?

1209
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:15,199
You're absolutely right, auntie.

1210
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:17,840
He wants to settle down with her.

1211
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,039
What are you saying?

1212
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,800
This sounds like a movie script.

1213
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,680
Movies are a reflection of our life.

1214
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,079
I'll send Kusum back.

1215
01:24:26,359 --> 01:24:28,800
But, I've a condition.
- Condition?

1216
01:24:29,159 --> 01:24:29,960
Yes.

1217
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:33,199
He has to marry Kusum and
then he can take her from here.

1218
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:35,840
Okay, I agree.

1219
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,920
We'll get Kusum married here
and then we'll take her with us.

1220
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,000
Where are you going?

1221
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:43,800
To meet Padma auntie.
- She has expired.

1222
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,000
What?
- Yes.

1223
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:47,520
Don't you know? She has expired.

1224
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,960
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1225
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:50,800
Go, go there quickly.

1226
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:55,560
Padma auntie. Padma auntie.

1227
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,640
I heard it right.
Got it? I heard it right.

1228
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,760
What's the matter?

1229
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,079
Why are you roaming near Kusum's room?

1230
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:06,359
Auntie, can I say something?

1231
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:07,680
What do you want to say?

1232
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,239
Are you getting Kusum married?

1233
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,680
Yes. How does it matter to you?

1234
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,960
Our business is not doing well.

1235
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:18,079
What will we do if Kusum goes away?

1236
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,840
I know everything.

1237
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:28,119
I understand everything but,
I'm also a human.

1238
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:33,640
If a girl can get out of
this hell and get a new life..

1239
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,840
..if she can settle down then
do you think I won't let her go..

1240
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,520
..should I stop her?

1241
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:41,079
What do you say? Tell me.

1242
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:43,359
Auntie.
- Auntie.

1243
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:07,359
Lata..

1244
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,880
Lata, where are you?

1245
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:32,840
Hello.

1246
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,479
Yes.

1247
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,600
What?

1248
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:39,359
What are you saying? When?

1249
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,439
Okay.

1250
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,960
Hold on.

1251
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:51,640
Tapasi. Tapasi. Come here.

1252
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,000
Not now.
- Come here quickly.

1253
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,319
Yes. Yes. I'll look into it.
- Coming.

1254
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:58,039
Okay. Okay.

1255
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,199
What happened?
Why were you shouting?

1256
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,000
Dad has expired.

1257
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:15,600
Where?
- In the brothel.

1258
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,840
I won't bring dad back in this house.

1259
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,079
What are you saying, Lata?

1260
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:42,600
The teacher wants to marry
Kusum and take her from here?

1261
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,880
Yes, right.

1262
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,840
I'm very happy, you know.

1263
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,520
The girl will settle down in life.

1264
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,319
All her dreams will come true.

1265
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,840
"Even after walking a long distance.."

1266
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:05,359
"..I couldn't meet you."

1267
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:15,000
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

1268
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,520
"Even after walking a long distance.."

1269
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,720
"..I couldn't meet you."

1270
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:33,920
"I get drenched in the
rain and search for you."

1271
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,760
Sometimes I worry a lot about my future.

1272
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,359
What will be my old age like?

1273
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,159
Who'll take care of me?

1274
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,760
Why? Why are you worried?

1275
01:28:47,079 --> 01:28:49,039
I'm with you.
- You?

1276
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,840
What will you do?

1277
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,960
I'll do something.

1278
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,479
Padma died due to starvation.

1279
01:28:59,239 --> 01:29:01,439
She was losing weight.

1280
01:29:03,159 --> 01:29:08,079
Nobody except Madhu was
with her during her last days.

1281
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:16,560
"The relentless tears
haven't melted your heart."

1282
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:25,640
"I've pondered upon it several
times but didn't get an answer."

1283
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,600
You don't have to wait long.

1284
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:31,000
You don't have to bear this pain for long.

1285
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:32,840
He has come.

1286
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,880
The teacher has come to take you back.

1287
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:44,439
Look, he has come. The hero of our story.

1288
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:51,560
But, I've made it clear that..

1289
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,279
..if he wants to take
my daughter from here..

1290
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:57,359
..then he has to marry her and
then take her or I won't let her go.

1291
01:29:58,039 --> 01:29:59,800
I'm right. Isn't it?

1292
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,920
Look, he has come. The teacher has come.

1293
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:08,720
Come and sit.

1294
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:14,119
Both of you talk while
I go and check other things.

1295
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,000
Kusum, I..

1296
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,840
I knew you would come.

1297
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,039
My heart knew it.

1298
01:30:27,159 --> 01:30:28,279
Kusum..

1299
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:34,199
I made a mistake.

1300
01:30:35,079 --> 01:30:36,760
Forget the past.

1301
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:38,039
Now you've come.

1302
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:46,359
Samanta.. Samanta, misled me.
He tempted me with money.

1303
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:54,000
Do you know I was waiting
for you that night?

1304
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:03,039
I was feeling very sleepy..

1305
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:09,479
..yet I was awake as
I expected you to come.

1306
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:14,560
But, you didn't come.

1307
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,319
The dawn broke.

1308
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:25,479
My life was engulfed in
darkness but you didn't come.

1309
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:29,119
I couldn't sleep at all that night.

1310
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:32,600
My conscience was pricking me.

1311
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:39,520
Forget it. Let's not discuss all this.

1312
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:43,680
How is my father?

1313
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:53,520
What?

1314
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,920
What are you saying?

1315
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,720
After getting you married
to Samanta he committed suicide.

1316
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,159
Samanta knew everything but
he purposely didn't give you the news.

1317
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:19,920
Don't cry, Kusum.

1318
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,079
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1319
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,560
Don't cry.

1320
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:30,159
Don't cry.

1321
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:34,920
This kind of thing
never happened here before.

1322
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:44,279
Kusum's wedding must look like
a wedding in a respectable family. Got it?

1323
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,960
Auntie, can we do that?

1324
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:48,039
Why not?

1325
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:49,199
We can definitely do it.

1326
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,439
Yes, we'll do it.

1327
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,880
Don't worry about the expenses.

1328
01:32:55,159 --> 01:32:57,279
I've money.

1329
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,119
The old man has left a lot
of money for us before he died.

1330
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,039
That's a lot of money.

1331
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:21,960
Are you giving it to me?
- Yes. I'll leave now.

1332
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:41,000
He told me that there should
be no shortcoming in Kusum's marriage.

1333
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:46,119
Take care that Kusum's
marriage is perfect.

1334
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,560
We'll organize a grand wedding for her.

1335
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,279
What's the matter?

1336
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,479
You haven't finished any work.

1337
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,439
Don't worry, everything will get done.

1338
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,319
Where are the garlands?

1339
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:02,760
Decorate the room with flowers.

1340
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,199
The room looks so dull.

1341
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:09,039
Priest, do you need sweets here.

1342
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:10,800
No, I don't need any sweets here.

1343
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,680
Keep it inside.
- Okay.

1344
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,800
Let me check what the others are doing.

1345
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:19,680
He's behaving as if we're sitting idle.

1346
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,640
We're busy working since morning.

1347
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,079
Give me your hand.

1348
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:47,600
Stay happy.

1349
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:49,680
Keep her happy.

1350
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,880
Visit us. Don't forget us.

1351
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:53,960
Stay well, sister.
- It's okay.

1352
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,039
Visit us.

1353
01:35:56,119 --> 01:35:57,560
Let's take a selfie.

1354
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,319
Look there.
