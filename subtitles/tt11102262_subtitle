1
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,450
I am coming for you.

2
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,120
The moment we come face to face...

3
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,330
will be the last thing
you remember.

4
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,330
I am coming for you.

5
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hello...

6
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,790
Hello, who's this?

7
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,200
- The moment we come face to face...
- Hello. Who is this?

8
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,540
Will be the last thing
you remember.

9
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
What nonsense?

10
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,500
In Chennai, the director of the famous
SR Hospitals, Mr. Salim Rahman,

11
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,450
has been missing
since the day before yesterday.

12
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,330
His father, Ali Rahman, has lodged
a complaint with the police.

13
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,700
Welcome, Father. Have a seat.

14
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What happened, Father?

15
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,080
You looked fine when you went in.

16
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,500
But after coming out, you look
like something is bothering you.

17
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,830
Well...

18
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,700
Vetri...

19
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,250
I can't even smoke peacefully.

20
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,910
Hello. What do you want?

21
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,040
Sir, we've found a car
in Padappai forest...

22
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,330
With loads of money in it?

23
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,120
No, sir, there's a corpse in it.

24
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,250
I knew it!

25
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,500
This is such a huge city,
and out of all the places

26
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,950
such crimes take place in
my jurisdiction to make my life hell!

27
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,267
Listen!

28
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,910
I am already at the mortuary
regarding another case.

29
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,830
For now, complete all the basic
formalities there.

30
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,950
I'll reach there by then.

31
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,540
This job sucks!

32
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,000
- Good morning, sir.
- Greetings.

33
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,910
- Sir!
- Greetings.

34
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,620
Is he asleep, or is that a corpse?

35
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,830
Done? Are you doing research
using the corpse?

36
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,750
Sir, our job is even more difficult.

37
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Got it.

38
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,540
Are you drunk?

39
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,250
Once dead, the stench
is all that is left.

40
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,516
And we need something like
booze to beat that stench.

41
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,780
- Sir, don't tell madam about it.
- Don't worry. I won't.

42
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,330
Drinking to work with dedication...

43
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,290
can only be found
in this profession.

44
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
Ew!

45
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,120
I wonder how they even work here.

46
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Hello...

47
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,790
Yes, sir?

48
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,370
Where is Bhadra ma'am?

49
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,370
- Madam's over there.
- Where?

50
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,830
Damn!

51
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,700
So many corpses!

52
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,910
Moving to the next corpse?

53
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,700
Where is she? What is she up to?

54
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,450
Ma'am...

55
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Good morning.

56
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,910
Michael...

57
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,330
join me. Would you like a bite?

58
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,950
You talk as if I bumped
into you at a restaurant.

59
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
Even if I go 10 days without food,

60
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,410
I won't eat here.

61
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,660
Once you realise
your destiny is to work here,

62
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
on the 11th day,
you will start eating here.

63
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,620
11 days? I can't even stand here
for 10 minutes!

64
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,540
Listen, this case will get over
in some time.

65
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,750
Okay, ma'am.

66
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,290
- Ma'am...
- Hey!

67
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Why is there no water?

68
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,580
Summer is here, ma'am.
Water problems have started.

69
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Here, ma'am.

70
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,950
People alive are struggling
to get some water.

71
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,370
Then how will the dead ones get?

72
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Am I right, Michael?

73
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,330
Spot on, ma'am.

74
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,620
- I'm here to discuss a case with...
- Hey!

75
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Not there!

76
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,950
Two inches below!

77
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,830
- Another case? Already?
- Yes, ma'am.

78
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,510
We already have
eight autopsies pending.

79
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,850
And we didn't get any requisitions.

80
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,500
I know, ma'am.

81
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,660
If you can come in person
and deal with it,

82
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,250
then it'll make
our investigation easy.

83
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,410
Am I right?

84
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
To the crime scene?

85
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,540
So that's why you were
running behind me?

86
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,330
Fine, where?

87
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,040
Padappai, inside a forest.

88
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,160
It's all the same stench.

89
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,790
I am unable to run back and forth.

90
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,910
Please help.

91
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,620
Fine.

92
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,080
Let me complete this case.

93
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,096
Thank you, ma'am.

94
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
So, Michael,

95
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,200
what was this girl's case?

96
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,040
It's a missing case, ma'am.

97
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,410
She left a note and eloped
with her boyfriend.

98
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,660
Two days after the complaint was lodged,
her body was found in the well.

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Please investigate
this case thoroughly.

100
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,910
This is section 376-D.

101
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
What do you mean?

102
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,830
Gang rape and murder?

103
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Yes.

104
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,790
Vaginal contusions,

105
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
abnormal hymen tear.

106
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,410
Excuse me, ma'am?

107
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,870
This girl's reproductive organ
is heavily damaged.

108
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,450
In the name of love, many guys
let their friends also have fun.

109
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,290
Arrest and third degree
isn't enough, but...

110
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Sorry, ma'am.

111
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,580
I've collected the semen traces.

112
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,540
You can do a DNA test and match to
find out how many of them and who.

113
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,370
Then decide how you'll punish them.

114
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,870
Madam, shall we pack this body?

115
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,660
How old are you?

116
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,870
25, madam.

117
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,000
She is five years younger
than you.

118
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,450
Just like you, she must
have had many dreams.

119
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,580
After completing the formalities,

120
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,620
while handing her body
over to her parents,

121
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,000
she must look better than you.

122
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,330
- Got it?
- Okay, madam.

123
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,450
Fine, pack the body.

124
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,870
Okay, Michael. Let's start.

125
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,330
- Let's go, ma'am.
- Yes.

126
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,516
So, that's what it means
to "stink like a corpse."

127
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,307
Michael...

128
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,370
- let me get my phone. You carry on.
- Okay, ma'am.

129
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,500
- Ma'am, your phone.
- Okay. Thanks.

130
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,540
Ameer, who saw it first
and informed the police?

131
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,000
Sir, a few women who were here
to collect logs saw it first.

132
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,790
- Any information on the car?
- No, it's completely burnt.

133
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,450
We have sent the engine details
to the forensic guys.

134
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Okay.

135
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,580
Is this the only way to reach here?

136
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,410
Yes, madam.
It's surrounded by the forest.

137
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,080
- Where is the car?
- This way.

138
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,370
Please come, ma'am.

139
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,500
What the hell?

140
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,750
Go search over there.

141
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,950
Over there...

142
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,250
- Michael...
- Ma'am?

143
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,910
This is definitely section 302.

144
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,330
He was murdered somewhere else.

145
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,410
Then his corpse was
brought here and burnt.

146
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,620
How do you say that, ma'am?

147
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
The victim hasn't tried to escape.

148
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,750
Look. The seat belt is
still intact on the buckle.

149
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
Not just that.

150
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,410
In three to four parts of his body,

151
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,160
the bones seem to be broken.

152
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,950
Ma'am...

153
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,410
can we identify the victim
through a DNA test?

154
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,290
There's no flesh left.

155
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,580
Even bone marrow test
looks impossible.

156
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,000
Based on the current
temperature of the car...

157
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,790
around...

158
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,370
five to six hours ago, the car
and the victim were set ablaze.

159
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,040
They have used petrol.

160
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,500
Can you give us anything else
based on these details?

161
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,290
Based on the bone structure,
the victim is a man.

162
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,540
Victim's height would be
around 5 feet 8 inches.

163
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,750
Around 33-35 years old.

164
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,410
That's all.

165
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,120
Madam...

166
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,370
We found a petrol can. They have
used petrol to burn the victim.

167
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,040
Anything else?

168
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,660
We have fingerprints.

169
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,620
I'll give you further details later.

170
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,910
- Shift the body to GH at once.
- Okay, ma'am.

171
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,136
We'll take care of
the formalities tomorrow.

172
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Okay, ma'am.

173
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,346
The corpse found yesterday
is yet to be identified.

174
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,370
In this situation, ACP Vishal...

175
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,500
Hey! Cut it out! Look, come on!

176
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,450
Sir, is it an accident or a murder?

177
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,676
Sir, who do you think did this?

178
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,846
- Sir, is it Salim Rahman's body?
- Look here!

179
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,330
Don't imagine things and
cook up half-baked stories.

180
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,080
Nothing is confirmed as yet.

181
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,410
Is the police department
hiding anything in this case?

182
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,886
- Sir, just one more question!
- Excuse me, sir! Please!

183
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,950
When will you take action?

184
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,660
Sir!

185
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,740
- Are the formalities done?
- It's in progress, sir.

186
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,250
Welcome, Vishal.

187
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,830
- Hi, Bhadra.
- Hi.

188
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,500
Is the final report ready?

189
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,290
We just finished the autopsy.

190
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,370
So, what's the autopsy outcome?

191
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,250
I had told Michael earlier.

192
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,160
- Yes, sir.
- Section 302 confirmed.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,790
He was brutally tortured
before he was murdered.

194
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,910
Bones fractured in eight places.

195
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,620
His spine is dislocated.

196
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,700
For the spine to dislocate, he must have
been hit using a heavy iron rod.

197
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,200
Damage beyond identification.

198
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,080
You said even DNA test is impossible.
What is next, Bhadra?

199
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,330
We have an option.

200
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,830
Based on the measurements
of this body,

201
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,040
we can try
the Super Imposition method.

202
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
And, Vishal...

203
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,040
all his right-hand fingers
have been chopped off.

204
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,290
That's unusual.

205
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,120
Ma'am, they are a perfect match.

206
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,250
Vishal, it's indeed Salim Rahman.

207
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,637
Conclude it.

208
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,500
Stop telling me about meat
when I am at the mortuary. Hang up.

209
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,790
- Sir, just a minute.
- What?

210
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Look at this.

211
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,370
Sir, what do we do?
It's blown out of proportion.

212
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,120
Our formalities are done.

213
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,000
We can hand over
the body immediately.

214
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
- But...
- Sir!

215
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,500
Please check out the news.

216
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,540
- What happened, Michael?
- Ma'am, kindly turn on the TV.

217
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,500
- Where's the remote?
- Play the news channel.

218
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,540
Vetri, who was sentenced to life
imprisonment in Central Jail

219
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,500
had told one of the prison staff,
Raj end ran,

220
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,870
that he will be murdering
Dr. Salim Rahman.

221
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,580
And he said it exactly on the day
Dr. Salim Rahman went missing.

222
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,330
We have received the audio
and visual evidence.

223
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,750
In the TikTok video by Raj end ran
performed in Vetri's cell,

224
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,250
the image of Salim Rahman
can be seen on the wall.

225
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,500
What's going on, Michael?

226
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,450
Who is leaking such news
to the press?

227
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,080
Sir, I tried my best
to keep it confidential.

228
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,807
I'm not sure how it got leaked.

229
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:36,330
I think this case is going
to be a headache for you.

230
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,500
Sir, that's Ali Rahman.

231
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,290
Salim Rahman's father.

232
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,410
Ma'am...

233
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Salim.

234
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Salim.

235
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,620
This is unfair!

236
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,926
Vetri, who is in prison, has claimed
to have murdered Salim Rahman.

237
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,160
Your comments, sir?

238
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,660
This is a very sensitive case.

239
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,750
Please don't disturb us,
and let us do our duty.

240
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,330
Sir, good afternoon.

241
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,870
Who posted that TikTok video?

242
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,080
Where is he?
Raja, come here!

243
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,660
Sir! Sorry, sir.

244
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,260
Don't you know that cell phones
aren't allowed inside the prison?

245
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,970
- Don't you have sense?
- I swear, no, sir.

246
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,080
Sorry, sir. I mean...

247
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,160
Did he have any visitors?
Any relatives?

248
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,040
I don't think
he has any relatives, sir.

249
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,790
So, nobody came to visit him?

250
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,200
A church priest visits him
quite often.

251
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,160
He doesn't come to just visit him.

252
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,080
He comes here to pray
for all the prisoners here.

253
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,160
During that time, he visits Vetri.

254
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,620
The last time when he visited...

255
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,870
Everybody confesses their crimes
or sins to me after committing them.

256
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,950
But he wanted forgiveness
for the sins he is going to commit.

257
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,330
He kept telling me that
he wanted to murder someone.

258
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,700
But today I could see it
in his eyes.

259
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Where is he right now?

260
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What happened?

261
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,040
The new inmates attacked him.

262
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,290
Isn't this Dr. Salim Rahman?

263
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,540
Why have you sketched
his portrait here?

264
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,870
That's your job.

265
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Go and find out.

266
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,290
Stop looking at the floor
and answer him!

267
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,370
Michael!

268
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,580
Paramasivam sir...

269
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,620
Hand over the priest's details
and Vetri's case files to Michael.

270
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Okay, sir.

271
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Come on, sir.

272
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,580
What's the link between that convict
and this case?

273
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,306
Sir, I met that convict in prison.

274
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,250
He's indeed behaving abnormally.

275
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,976
I have filed a petition
to get his custody.

276
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,750
Just tell me who murdered my son.

277
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,290
Rest...

278
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,080
I know how to handle.

279
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,910
You keep singing praises
of some lady. Who was that?

280
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,120
Dr. Bhadra Thangavel.

281
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,790
- Ah! Yes. That girl.
- A police surgeon.

282
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,870
Many cases had a breakthrough
after she got involved.

283
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,580
She'd be very useful for our case.

284
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,370
Okay, Vishal, I'll inform her.

285
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,580
You please go and meet her.

286
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,910
Yes, sir. Sir!

287
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,290
Vishal, hold on.

288
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,790
Bhadra is always hyped and eager to
solve every case that she's assigned.

289
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,750
Not just the case,

290
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,800
but she'll give her best to expose
everything related to the case.

291
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,630
After all, she has a doctorate
in Criminology.

292
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,620
She will try to show off
her capability. So, beware!

293
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
Definitely, sir. I will.

294
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Diya...

295
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,830
your principal seems to have
only praises about you?

296
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
That's Diya for you!

297
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,290
Chatterbox!

298
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Fine...

299
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,120
Your teacher told me that
you wanted to become a cop.

300
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,137
Is that true?

301
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:24,000
Yes, Mommy. I am going to
shoot down all the robbers.

302
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Wow!

303
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,870
You know what?

304
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,450
When I was a kid, even I wished
to become a cop.

305
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,700
Really?

306
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,870
I read a lot of books
that had cops and robbers.

307
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,410
But your Grandpa Velu

308
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,370
was hell-bent on
making me a doctor.

309
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,950
Then what happened?

310
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,250
But...

311
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,660
I was clever!

312
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,660
I knew that I can be a doctor
in the police department.

313
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,330
And I joined there.

314
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,540
A win-win for both Grandpa
and Mommy!

315
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,450
So, Mom, you are a cop?

316
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Yes!

317
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,910
Salute!

318
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,830
Thank you, ma'am.

319
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,910
My brave girl.

320
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
Bhadra...

321
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,830
Hi!

322
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,750
Come with me.

323
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,200
Who is that uncle, Mom?

324
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,410
Hi.

325
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,040
- Your daughter?
- Yes.

326
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,290
Diya.

327
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,660
- Hi, Diya.
- Hi, uncle.

328
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,120
My husband works in Dubai.

329
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,330
- Okay.
- Yeah.

330
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,290
ADGP spoke to me.

331
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,410
Okay.

332
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,700
Why did you drag me
into this case, Vishal?

333
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,000
I was happy teaching my students
and examining corpses.

334
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,790
Higher officials' orders, Bhadra.

335
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,580
I believe we can solve
this case quickly with your help.

336
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,410
Sure.

337
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,870
Hopefully.

338
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,370
Welcome to the team.

339
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
Thank you.

340
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,830
Stop repeating yourself!

341
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,410
Well, the truth must be yelled out
again and again here.

342
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,330
Do you recognise him?

343
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,620
He is asking you! Answer him!

344
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,830
Speak!

345
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,620
What is the issue between you two?

346
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,120
Issue? There are no more issues.

347
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,080
Didn't I murder him already?

348
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,370
Sir...

349
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,750
careful! He might just die.

350
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,290
Leave him to me. I'll handle him.

351
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,340
I very well know that
you didn't murder him.

352
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,000
Who's helping you from the outside?
Answer me!

353
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
God.

354
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,830
Who is Angel?

355
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,330
I don't know! I don't know!

356
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,500
I don't know! I don't know!

357
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,950
I don't know!

358
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,040
He is just repeating
the same thing, idiot!

359
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,950
Who is Angel?

360
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,290
Look at this graph.

361
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,250
When you questioned him
about Salim Rahman,

362
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,790
it made him angry

363
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,910
and he behaved
in an impulsive manner.

364
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,726
But the moment
you took Angel's name,

365
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,290
he reacted dead opposite to that.
He went quiet.

366
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,500
We need to know about Angel.

367
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,120
A new twist in the Salim Rahman
murder case.

368
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,410
Vetri is now being escorted
to this church.

369
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,910
They are here. Come on!

370
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,410
- Ameer!
- Sir?

371
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,410
Who is leaking information
to the press?

372
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,750
Good morning, Father.

373
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,886
- Good morning.
- I am ACP Vishal.

374
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,540
- I had contacted you.
- Tell me.

375
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,830
- Ameer...
- Sir?

376
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,160
- Take Vetri to the cemetery.
- Okay, sir.

377
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,040
Can you tell us about Vetri, Father?

378
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,750
If you want to know
everything about Vetri,

379
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,450
first, you must know about Angel.

380
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,790
25 years ago...

381
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,040
that little angel...

382
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,870
came in to our lives.

383
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,830
It was me who named her Angel.

384
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,080
Angel.

385
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,160
She grew up in this church,
among us.

386
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,290
We were always filled with...

387
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,910
her happiness and sorrows.

388
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,790
What are you praying to Jesus
in secret?

389
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,790
Every student in my school has
their dad's name as their surname.

390
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,620
But I don't have a surname.

391
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Who said that?

392
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,790
Who said you don't have a dad?

393
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,290
Look there. He's a father
to the whole world.

394
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,580
From today, you'll be
known as Angel Jesus.

395
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,370
- Sounds good?
- Okay.

396
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,750
Well, on that note. Give me a candy.

397
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,040
This is only for my dad.

398
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,830
Come on, Dad. You don't answer
any of your daughter's prayers.

399
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,450
My friend Mary is getting married.

400
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,450
She will then move to Chennai.

401
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,790
I must rot here,
riding this crappy bicycle.

402
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,120
I don't have huge demands.

403
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,806
Help me find my dream boy.

404
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,580
All I want is to ride
with him on a bike.

405
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And hug him tight as we go
on a ride around these hills.

406
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
That's all I ask.

407
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,700
Well, there's no rush.

408
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,910
Do it when you feel
the time is right.

409
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,200
I won't judge or misunderstand you.

410
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,660
So embarrassing.

411
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,370
Yes, sir? What do you want?

412
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
So...

413
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,160
that's your dad?

414
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,540
Of course!

415
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,000
So, you're bribing your dad?

416
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,250
Yes, what's your problem?

417
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,750
- What are you doing here, Vetri?
- Father...

418
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,830
- Done with your work?
- Yes, Father.

419
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,910
Father, will our prayers be answered
if we pray in the church?

420
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,120
Of course!

421
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,620
Why do you ask?

422
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,200
Nothing. Just curious.

423
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,677
See you, Father.

424
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,580
- Why do you look upset?
- Nothing, Father.

425
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,790

Come, Vetri. Tell me.

432
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,290
Father, well...

433
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,700
I like a girl.

434
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,660
I think she also likes me.

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
But...

00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,750
I don't know

00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,500
Why confess to her?

438
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,080
Meet her parents
and ask for her hand in marriage.

439
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,620
You think so, father?

440
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,080

I don't know why your mother
abandoned you.

Do you accept his proposal?

00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
What, Dad?

452
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,540
What is it, Dad?

453
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,540
Okay, I'll tell them.

Father...

455
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,370
my dad gave his approval.

456
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,770

472
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,040
I am not earning
enough here, Father.

473
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,620
Apart from that,
we are going to have a child soon.

474
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,080
So long I have lived a lonely life.

475
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,910
But, every second
of the rest of my life,

476
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,080
I want my Angel by my side.

477
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
That...

478
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,200
That was the last time I saw him.

479
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Father...

480
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,040
which hospital
was Angel admitted in?

481
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,120
JC Hospital.

482
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
- Ameer.
- Sir?

483
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,980
- Take Vetri to the jeep.
- Okay, sir.

484
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,250
Move!

485
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,636
I said move!

486
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
Vetri...

487
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,950
- I want to pray.
- No way. Move!

488
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,410
I said I want to pray!

489
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,870
Ameer...

490
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,410
he just wants to pray.

491
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,870
Let him.

492
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,410
Ameer.

493
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,450
You may have forgiven
those who crucified you.

494
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,830
But me?
My life didn't have a meaning.

495
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,580
But with her love...

496
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,250
she gave a beautiful meaning
to my life.

497
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,580
They denied me
such a beautiful life!

498
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,370
And those who ruined my life...

499
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,540
must die!

500
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,830
Vetri!

501
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,410
So far what I've done...

502
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,250
and what I am going to do...

503
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,040
I have explained everything...

504
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,870
to him.

505
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
What?

506
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,870
Cover this whole thing.

507
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,977
Shoot it properly.

508
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,580
- Make way! Move!
- Quick! Shoot it!

509
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,500
Sir, check this out.

510
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,910
I have set the target...

511
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,620
and now it's time to hunt.

512
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,870
I am coming...

513
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,370
for you.

514
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,910
The moment we come face to face...

515
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:43,040
will be the last thing
you remember.

516
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,120
IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF CAIN

517
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,370
CAIN

518
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,290
AND ABEL

519
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,160
Sir, what does
"In the footsteps of Cain" mean?

520
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,370
It means...

521
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,700
Our world's first murderer...

522
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,870
Cain.

523
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,250
In his greed for wealth,
he murdered his own brother.

524
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,426
"Henceforth, every murder
committed in this world"

525
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,080
"will be in the footsteps of Cain."

526
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,330
That's how God cursed Cain.

527
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,290
It's a story from the Bible.

528
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,500
But...

529
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,500
what's the link between that story
and this case we're dealing with?

530
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
I don't get it.

531
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,790
Sir, it's done.

532
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,120
Medical check-up is all cleared.

533
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,750
Keep it in my cabin.

534
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,290
Let's go.

535
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,910
Bhadra, be careful.
Don't hassle us.

536
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,516
- Was it a murder attempt or accident?
- I cannot confirm anything now.

537
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,120
Michael, escort Vetri carefully.

538
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,120
- Did Vetri say anything else?
- Move! Make way!

539
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Michael!

540
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,580
Please listen to us!

541
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,636
Sir, what's your next move?

542
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,220
- Please behave yourselves.
- I can't confirm anything as of now.

543
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,387
Sir, give us something.

544
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:13,330
The inquiry is ongoing,
so we can't confirm anything.

545
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,120
Were they your men?

546
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,950
I don't think so.

547
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,410
Don't think you can confuse us
and escape.

548
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,540
I ain't confusing you.

549
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,330
Didn't I already tell you...

550
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,950
who I am going to kill next?

551
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,500
Stop it if you can.

552
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,500
What do you mean, Michael?

553
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,580
Yes, ma'am. Four years ago,
when Angel died,

554
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,750
Salim was working at JC Hospital.

555
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:06,120
Also, the file has
Angel's autopsy report.

556
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,660
What is it, Bhadra?

557
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,790
Look who signed it.

558
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
Salim Rahman.

559
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,250
So?

560
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,620
Michael, how did Angel die?

561
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,410
In an accident.

562
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
Cause of death?

563
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,410
A blow to the back of the head.

564
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,410
A woman...

565
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,500
A pregnant woman...

566
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,950
got a blow to her head

567
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,120
and was admitted
to the hospital for treatment.

568
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,000
Who would examine her first?

569
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,660
A surgeon...

570
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,120
or a heart surgeon?

571
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,120
There is something fishy in
Angel's death that we are unaware of.

572
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,870
But...

573
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,660
we cannot come to a conclusion
based on this autopsy report.

574
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,790
Bhadra...

575
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,330
can we...

576
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,200
perform an autopsy again?

577
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,910
Yes, we can!

578
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,450
Sorry, ma'am.

579
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,260
Sir, if we dig out her corpse
after so long,

580
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,870
do you think
anything will be left?

581
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,040
Maybe a few bones.

582
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,580
Those may be useful
only to occult practitioners.

583
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,290
- Michael!
- Sorry, sir.

584
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,370
It's possible, Michael.

585
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,540
Many cases have been solved
using the bones that were found.

586
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
But how, ma'am?

587
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,700
In 1920...

588
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,870
a pathologist named Sidney Smith.

589
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,450
Using three bones found in a well,

590
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,660
she found out that
it belonged to a handicapped girl

591
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,950
and reported to the police that
the cause of death was a gunshot.

592
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,660
During the police investigation,

593
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,620
they found that it was
the girl's father who murdered her.

594
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,790
So, every small evidence we get

595
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,080
might be of great help to us.

596
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:06,870
Sorry, ma'am.

597
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,620
All I need is a few of Angel's bones

598
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,330
and I can come up
with her complete history.

599
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,620
Any of Vetri or Angel's relatives

600
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,250
must file a case in court
to re-examine her corpse.

601
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,500
Only then we can perform
an autopsy again.

602
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,910
But they don't have any relatives.

603
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,580
They do.

604
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,580
According to CRPC section 176,

605
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,700
the court allows to re-examine
Angel Jesus' body.

606
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,160
Are you blind?

607
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,540
What are you staring at?

608
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,200
Who is that?

609
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,450
Didn't they find a better place?

610
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Father, wait here.

611
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,790
You are causing a traffic jam!
Take it somewhere else. Look at him!

612
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,910
Watch out, you might fall
and break your jaws!

613
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,790
BLOOD DONATION CAMP

614
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,910
So what?

615
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,200
Move, I say!

616
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,000
Move! I said leave!

617
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,700
Too much! Leave!

618
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,620
Make way! Move!

619
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Father?

620
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,870
Father?

621
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,830
- Michael.
- Ma'am?

622
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,040
How is Father's condition?

623
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,000
His condition is a little serious.

624
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,200
Any leads on who did it?

625
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,290
We have given an order
to track using CCTV footage.

626
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:03,910
Sorry, sir.

627
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,580
With Father in this condition, I don't
think we can carry out the autopsy.

628
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,370
The order will be cancelled.

629
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,950
Things are out of our hands, Bhadra.

630
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,330
It's all because of me, ma'am.
Very sorry, ma'am.

631
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,250
God!

632
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,040
We can do it, Vishal.

633
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,540
Once the sun rises

634
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,120
and the first ray touches the land,

635
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,790
as a forensic surgeon,
I can carry out the autopsy.

636
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,330
I have the right to do that.

637
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,290
That's really good!

638
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,620
Tomorrow morning,

639
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,040
before the judge wakes up
and goes to court,

640
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,250
we shall finish that autopsy.

641
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,000
We cannot take more risks
with regards to Father.

642
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,040
- Michael...
- Sir?

643
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
- Listen...
- Vishal...

644
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,410
before that, we have to
take care of something.

645
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,250
There you go, Vishal.

646
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,410
Didn't I tell you they would come?

647
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,410
Make sure Angel's body is safe.

648
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:48,426
Hello, ma'am.

649
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:49,516
- Am I late?
- That's okay, ma'am.

650
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,950

Angel's body, which was buried
four years ago, has not decomposed.

662
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,450
There is some mystery in this case.

663
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,250
Why has the body not decomposed
after so many years?

664
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,660
Some supernatural phenomenon?

665
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,500
The media are hyping up
the whole thing.

666
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,860
This is not any kind of
supernatural phenomenon, Ameer.

667
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,910
Some bodies are buried after
being sealed in a concrete coffin.

668
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,450
So, when sunlight and air
cannot penetrate through,

669
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,080
a wax-like texture forms
all over their skin.

670
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,676
Like soap.

671
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,500
That will save their body
from getting decomposed.

672
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,160
It's called adipocere.

673
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:26,870
It's very common.

674
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,910
Vishal, this must remain between us.

675
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,330
Keep it confidential.

676
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,540
What's the matter, Bhadra?

677
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,540
The autopsy that I performed now...

678
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,500
is the first autopsy
on Angel's body.

679
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What?

680
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,620
The most important thing is that...

681
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,450
from Angel's body,

682
00:53:58,790 --> 00:53:59,830
her heart is missing.

683
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Oh, God!

684
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,410
The earlier autopsy report we have

685
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,910
doesn't mention anything like that.

686
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,540
Even the report that
we got from JC Hospital

687
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,830
doesn't mention that.

688
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,370
Vishal...

689
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,700
there is some serious crime
hiding behind all this.

690
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,636
Something extrajudicial.

691
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,660
Madam!

692
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,910
- Shall we bury the body back?
- No, Ameer.

693
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,700
The autopsy is not complete.
We aren't done examining it.

694
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,290
Make arrangements
to shift this body to the GH.

695
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,580
Okay, madam.

696
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,620
Clear the crowd.

697
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,750
I said clear off!

698
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,330
Move! Make way!

699
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,040
These keynotes are worthless!

700
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,410
None of the details is
complete in this report.

701
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,000
Madam, I just joined here.
These are old files.

702
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,410
I need to talk to your dean.
Where is he?

703
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,950
I shall give you the address
if you want.

704
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,870
I am...

705
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,450
I am not confusing you.

706
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,790
Coming for you.

707
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,000
Who I am going to murder next.

708
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,700
The moment we come face to face...

709
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,370
So far what I've done...

710
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,910
and what I am going to do...

711
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,500
I have explained everything...

712
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,660
I have set the target...

713
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,160
I have explained everything to him.

714
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,040
Now it's time to hunt.

715
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,410
...will be the last thing
you remember.

716
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,410
Will be the last thing...

717
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
Vishal.

718
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,410
Yes, Bhadra?

719
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,500
Guess who Vetri is
going to murder next?

720
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,330
Who?

721
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,330
Didn't he talk about footsteps?

722
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,870
"In the footsteps of Cain."

723
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,120
Whom did Cain murder?

724
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,290
His younger brother.

725
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,160
His name is...

726
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,290
Abel.

727
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,450
Welcome, Vishal.

728
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,950
How do you know my name, sir?

729
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:01,250
Well, aren't you the current
trending sensational news?

730
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,000
Dr. Bhadra...

731
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,330
The most brilliant pathologist in
the Tamil Nadu police department.

732
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,080
Thank you, sir.

733
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:15,620
- Can we sit down?
- Yes! Yes! Please sit down.

734
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,040
Sir, looks like you read a lot.

735
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,700
Yes, I love reading.

736
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,700
"Thick As Thieves."

737
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,660
By the time we finish this book,

738
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,910
our minds too will start
working like a thief.

739
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,330
Isn't it, sir?

740
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,410
Buy a pack of cigarettes for me.

741
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,080
Okay, sir.

742
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm sorry. Some poison?

743
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,040
No, sir. Thank you.

744
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,330
Coffee, tea, anything?

745
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:09,910
No, sir.

746
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,000
So, do you stay alone?

747
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,580
In fact, my family is in Australia.

748
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,410
I stay here when I visit India.

749
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,910
My business is here.
That's the reason.

750
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:22,830
Excuse me.

751
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,750
Sir, let me come to the point.

752
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,830
Four years ago,
a woman died in your hospital.

753
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,120
When we conducted an autopsy
on her corpse again,

754
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,950
we found that your hospital
has committed a crime.

755
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,750
We came here to collect
details regarding that.

756
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:49,910
Enough.

757
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,870
I know
where this discussion is heading.

758
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,250
How well do you know
Dr. Salim Rahman?

759
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,910
He is one of
the famous heart surgeons.

760
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,620
We don't have to do organ trading

761
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,830
to earn our livelihood.

762
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,200
We never accused you
of organ trading.

763
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,830
Then how did you guess?

764
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Well...

765
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,580
Well... that...

766
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,000
Didn't you inquire about it
in the hospital?

767
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
But, Vishal...

768
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,660
we never inquired about
organ trading in the hospital.

769
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,660
You'll have to come to our office
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

770
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:31,500
To ensure your safety,

771
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,220
we are arranging security
for you tonight.

772
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,870
- Michael...
- Sir?

773
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,770
Call the control room

774
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,920
and arrange four officers
for the doctor's protection.

775
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,580
Let this be confidential.

776
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,660
Is this a house arrest?

777
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,910
Let it be a secret between us.

778
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,200
Control room.

779
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,330
Please send in four officers
from E-8 station.

780
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,700
Sir...

781
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,450
I forgot my phone.

782
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,870
You're over thinking.

783
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,700
Relax.

784
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,200
Vishal...

785
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,450
didn't he tell us that
he's alone in the house?

786
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,750
- Yes.
- Nope.

787
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,580
I feel someone else...

788
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,620
Michael!

789
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,620
Michael, how did they get in?

790
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,660
Michael, come on!

791
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,450
Kumar, the murderer is escaping!
Catch him!

792
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:03,830
Hey, Kumar!

793
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,040
Constables, clear the media.

794
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,290
- Ameer, be careful with these people.
- Okay, sir.

795
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,950
We can say anything
only after the autopsy.

796
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,000
Is there any police involvement
in this case, ma'am?

797
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,330
Ma'am, please answer us
before you go.

798
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,260
Why is the media getting wrong
information? Please take care of it.

799
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,910
Hold. Please have patience.

800
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,766
There's too much pressure, Bhadra.
Please finish the autopsy quickly.

801
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,580
No, Vishal.
I won't carry out this autopsy.

802
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,200
Since I was also at the spot,
there might be a backlash.

803
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,660
So, I'll get my associate to do it.

804
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,300
- But, Bhadra, only if you do...
- Don't worry. I'll supervise it.

805
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,660
Vetri was spot on about this murder.

806
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,700
Which means he definitely has
an ally on the outside.

807
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,540
No thanks, Bhadra.
I have some work at my office.

808
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,540
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, fine.

809
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:08,910
Sir!

810
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,200
- ADGP is waiting, sir.
- What? When did he arrive?

811
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,250
Just now, sir.

812
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,460
Did you get anything useful
from the other guy?

813
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,740
He isn't a common criminal
who will fall for our threats.

814
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,790
We must interrogate him
the way we know best.

815
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,620
Just give me permission...

816
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:24,160
and inch by inch of third-degree
treatment will make him speak.

817
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,830
- Fine, try your luck.
- Thank you, sir.

818
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,370
Sir!

819
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:36,870
What's going on, Vishal?

820
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,500
There is no progress!

821
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,016
I've to come up with new excuses
to convince the Home Minister.

822
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,266
Let me know if you want me to
transfer this case to someone else.

823
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,410
Sir, no!

824
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,540
We are very close.

825
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,910
Salim Rahman, Abel...

826
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,620
We have got the same fingerprints
at both crime scenes.

827
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,700
We thought Father Lourdusamy
was helping Vetri.

828
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,750
But someone tried to murder him.

829
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,830
That's the culprit we are after.

830
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,830
The fellow you caught
at the cemetery...

831
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,910
- Yes, sir?
- Did you get anything from him?

832
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,620
Sir, we are interrogating him.

833
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,200
Definitely by this evening
we will get something.

834
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,660
Sir, we must take Vetri
into custody once again.

835
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,540
With your permission.

836
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,000
This guy is definitely not human!

837
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,080
Sir...

838
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,160
What happened, Michael?

839
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,080
My hands have gone numb
beating him up.

840
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,840
No matter how much we torture him,
he's pointing to Royapuram Mani.

841
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,870
Who is that Mani?

842
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:37,540
Arrest him at once!

843
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,160
That's a dangerous locality, sir.

844
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,676
It's not easy to walk in there
as a policeman and arrest him.

845
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,160
We'll be ripped apart.

846
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,330
Look at this doofus!
Pees only in this spot.

847
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,250
Okay, we are ready.

848
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,870
Dinesh, don't get caught.

849
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,620
Okay, see you tomorrow then.

850
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,330
Okay, see you.

851
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:24,330
See you.

852
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:33,700
Any update on the stuff?

853
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:37,080
Well, Shekar keeps buying
the stuff from us,

854
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,057
but he refuses to pay.

855
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:39,700
Don't worry. I'll deal with him.

856
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:42,250
Sir, ready.

857
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:55,370
Ready.

858
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,040
Who's bursting crackers in here?

859
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,910
How dare you?

860
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,250
Waste disposal! Waste disposal!

861
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,910
Waste disposal!

862
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:26,410
You already took Vetri in your custody
and carried out an investigation.

863
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,750
Then why do you need
five more days of custody?

864
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,410
Salim Rahman and Abel.

865
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:34,370
The fingerprints found at
both crime scenes are the same.

866
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,410
Apart from these two autopsies,

867
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:41,290
when we re-examined Vetri's wife
Angel's body, we found that

868
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:44,910
JC Hospital is involved
in a serious crime.

869
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,370
The correct evidence

870
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,870
is in this file.

871
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:54,660
What do you mean, Bhadra?

872
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:55,790
A medical crime?

873
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,250
Yes, ma'am.

874
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,450
The court approves
to hand over Vetri's custody

875
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,540
to the police for two days
and investigate.

876
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,330
Thank you, ma'am.

877
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,200
My Lord, with your permission,

878
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,040
can I ask Vetri something?

879
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,450
Yes. Proceed.

880
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,040
Does your journey stop here...

881
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,950
or will it continue?

882
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,370
The secret that the people
or the media don't know...

883
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,870
you presented it before the judge.

884
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:43,910
Angel.

885
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,830
The person
who received Angel's heart...

886
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:51,370
is the one who I going for next.

887
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,410
Look here, Mani!

888
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
The sooner you tell the truth,
the better for you.

889
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,660
No one's coming
to bail you out from here.

890
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,100
- Sir! Sir, it hurts!
- This interrogation is off the record.

891
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,700
Speak!

892
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,830
Sir, I'll tell you!
I'll tell you everything!

893
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:44,700
Whoa! So many tests.

894
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,330
I am exhausted.

895
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:49,370
Looks like we'll need
separate income for childbirth.

896
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,790
We could have gone
to some small hospital.

897
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,870
You're my angel...

898
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,080
and so is our child.

899
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,790
Our births weren't memorable birth.

900
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
But our baby angel

901
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,700
must take birth in a rich place.

902
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,250
All our fears will vanish
after her birth,

903
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,620
and there will be happiness
in your eyes.

904
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,590
Well, all the money
spent for that is worth it!

905
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,790
What happened?

906
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,500
She is kicking me.

907
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,281
I think she's telling me
not to make daddy spend too much.

908
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:22,636
- She's not kicking you...
- ♪ You are the one Who bore my loneliness ♪

909
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,250
but patting you to stay calm.

910
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:32,370
♪ You are the one
Who bore my loneliness ♪

911
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:38,830
♪ I was a dry plant in the desert ♪

912
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:43,950
♪ But you turned me
Into a colourful flower ♪

913
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,950
♪ Like a peacock getting exited
At the sight of rain ♪

914
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,540
♪ I get excited
At the sight of you ♪

915
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,080
♪ Come, let's fall deep in love ♪

916
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:02,540
♪ Like a peacock getting exited
At the sight of rain ♪

917
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,040
♪ I get excited
At the sight of you ♪

918
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,870
♪ Come, let's fall deep in love ♪

919
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,330
Get up! Get up!

920
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,660
Ravi, come on! Run! Run!

921
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,750
Angel's heart was transplanted.

922
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,830
We found out only now.

923
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,790
It is a fact not even
in the hospital records.

924
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,540
But how did you know, Vetri?

925
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:19,830
Did Father tell you?

926
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:26,450
Who would help this orphan, Father?

927
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:28,950
God is the saviour of hurt souls.

928
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,580
That God has now arrived
to help you.

929
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,870
Your prayers
are going to be answered.

930
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,616
All you have to do
is follow my instructions

931
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,370
while you're in prison.

932
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:45,160
Sir, I met that convict in prison.

933
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:48,040
He kept telling me that
he wanted to murder someone.

934
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,700
Speak!

935
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:51,580
Isn't this Dr. Salim Rahman?

936
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,886
Why have you sketched
his portrait here?

937
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:55,580
But today I could see it
in his eyes.

938
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,750
That's your job. Go and find out.

939
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:03,000
I very well know you didn't kill him.
Who's helping you from the outside?

940
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:06,370
He was brutally tortured
before he was murdered.

941
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,120
God!

942
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,450
He was murdered somewhere else.

943
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,620
Then his corpse was
brought here and burnt.

944
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,160
I have set the target.

945
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,830
I've already told you.

946
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,580
He's indeed behaving abnormally.

947
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,080
Who I am going to murder next.

948
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,290
Rest everything will fall in place.

949
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,160
Now it's time to hunt.

950
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,950
When we were conducting the autopsy
on Angel's body,

951
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,200
even Father was in the ICU.

952
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,410
So, apart from Father,

953
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,790
someone else is helping him.

954
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,540
And that person is the killer.

955
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,620
He's someone among us

956
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,000
who is working for Vetri.

957
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,040
Dad, I have prepared the food.

958
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,450
So, eat well
and then go play with the corpses.

959
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,660
Why do you have to be so rude?

960
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,660
Dad...

961
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,540
after Mom passed away,
you are all we got.

962
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,830
You shouldn't starve
and spoil your health.

963
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:55,290
It hurts us to see you like this.

964
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,000
Ain't I earning now?

965
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,160
Why can't you retire and
take care of your health?

966
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,330
She's asking,
"Aren't you getting late for work?"

967
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,290
I can understand what she's telling.

968
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:09,620
Okay, take care of him. See you.

969
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,330
Bye.

970
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,290
Oh! Sorry! Sorry!

971
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:19,950
See you, Dad.

972
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,910
Priya, how many times do I call you?

973
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:43,056
Why don't you pick up my calls?

974
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,990
Oh, no! My mobile was on silent.
I didn't notice.

975
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,500
I got repeated calls
from my son's school.

976
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,330
Looks like he is very sick.

977
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,410
Oh, my God!

978
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,580
- Can you do me a favour?
- Tell me.

979
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,000
I have duty in
the operation theatre this evening.

980
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,500
Can you fill in for me, please?

981
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,250
Is it?
Who is the duty doctor?

982
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,080
Dear, what happened?

983
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:06,450
Look at me.

984
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,830
Why are you crying?

985
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,450
Priya, look at me.

986
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,307
Dad...

987
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:15,790
do the lives of poor people mean
nothing in the world of the rich?

988
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:18,290
What do you mean?

989
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,950
I filled in for that nurse
and went to the surgery room.

990
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,370
Since Dr. Salim was going
to perform the surgery,

991
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,750
I didn't know the patient's details.

992
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:33,200
But once I went in...

993
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,120
I understood that...

994
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,370
something wrong was
about to happen there.

995
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,830
Angel was in a condition
where she could've been saved.

996
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,040
But instead of saving her...

997
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,370
the doctor proceeded
with the surgery.

998
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:50,450
She was pregnant, Dad.

999
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,620
They took out the child,

1000
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:55,330
but the child was dead.

1001
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,870
Such premature dead babies

1002
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,870
are handed to us.

1003
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:47,500
What the hell?

1004
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,580
What are we going to do, Dad?

1005
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:14,370
I am not saying this just for Angel.

1006
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:17,700
If such an injustice
has happened to a girl,

1007
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:21,160
then it definitely must be brought
to the attention of the authorities.

1008
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,450
What?

1009
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,580
One more death.

1010
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:55,120
If we can make Ali
spit out the truth,

1011
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,250
then all this will come to an end.

1012
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,790
But that's impossible.

1013
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,580
It's not just Ali.

1014
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,080
There are three others
who know about this.

1015
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,540
Vetri...

1016
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,450
the killer...

1017
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,160
and the one
who is going to die next.

1018
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:17,160
July 26th, 2017.

1019
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,000
That's the day
Angel met with an accident.

1020
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,450
And death on the same day.

1021
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,750
The heart has a speciality.

1022
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:27,160
For transplanting, it must be removed
when the donor is alive

1023
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:30,330
and transplanted to the recipient
within four hours.

1024
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,620
So, the recipient had
their transplantation surgery

1025
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:34,750
on the same day.

1026
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:35,910
July 26th.

1027
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:39,870
In that case,

1028
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:44,016
that surgery must have taken place
in JC Hospital or somewhere nearby.

1029
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,040
Yes.

1030
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,370
But we don't have access
to those records.

1031
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:50,000
So, let's alert the public.

1032
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:53,370
Those who had done heart
transplantation on that date

1033
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,870
is the next target of the killer.

1034
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:00,330
Not many transplant surgeries
can take place in one day.

1035
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,370
Yes.

1036
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
So, what next?

1037
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,450
A new twist to the Angel murder case.
On 26th July 2017,

1038
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,950
those who underwent heart transplants
in Chennai

1039
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,000
are asked to come forward
and meet the police.

1040
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,910
Sir, why am I being transferred?

1041
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,910
For excelling in your duty!

1042
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,700
This case has been transferred
to CB CID. You may leave.

1043
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:38,830
Leave, son.

1044
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,660
Son...

1045
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,200
shall I tell you something?

1046
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,250
I am the one behind all this.

1047
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:49,830
What was that girl's name?
Ah! Angel!

1048
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:52,790
Her heart fetched us ₹2 crore.

1049
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,660
Today its value will be even more.

1050
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,080
My son's murderer

1051
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,870
should have met his maker
back then.

1052
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,410
So, you were behind all that?

1053
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:20,330
The only evidence
you have got is Mani.

1054
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:24,450
I know what his statement will be
when he appears in court.

1055
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:27,450
The one who got Angel's heart
is of course the next target.

1056
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,370
We can nab the killer based on this.

1057
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,750
I'll tell you
who received Angel's heart.

1058
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,120
Sounds good?

1059
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,750
Correct, sir. Money can do wonders.

1060
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:44,660
Do you think Vetri's next target
is the recipient?

1061
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,250
But I feel...

1062
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,910
that his next target...

1063
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,080
is you.

1064
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,790
Complete all the formalities
from our end

1065
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:07,370
and release Angel's body.

1066
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:09,660
Okay, ma'am.

1067
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:11,950
Told you, Vishal.

1068
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:14,290
They just won't let us work.

1069
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,540
That's our system for you.

1070
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,410
It feels incomplete
to leave the case halfway.

1071
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,910
Another murder
will definitely take place.

1072
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:34,410
No, Bhadra...

1073
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:37,370
Whoever is the recipient
of Angel's heart...

1074
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,330
Vetri will not murder them.

1075
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,290
You know...

1076
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:45,540
Vetri's motive

1077
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:48,040
is to bring the truth out
in the open.

1078
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,120
And for that

1079
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:54,200
Vetri or the killer

1080
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,500
has manipulated us.

1081
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,250
But...

1082
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,790
all these murders
have a justification.

1083
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,160
Everyone who died deserved it.

1084
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,450
Who do you think
is going to die next?

1085
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:54,370
I am coming for you.

1086
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,950
The moment we come face to face...

1087
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:02,200
will be the last thing
you remember.

1088
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,120
So it was you?

1089
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:20,700
You murdered my son?

1090
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:27,250
Spare me and I shall pay you
loads of money.

1091
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,160
Please let me go.

1092
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,250
The punishment for every sin
and its execution

1093
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:41,540
is in the hands of God.

1094
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,330
The corpses that we receive are

1095
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:10,790
unnatural death and MLC,
medico-legal cases.

1096
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,040
Hope you guys know.

1097
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,500
Each of them will be
in different conditions.

1098
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,500
For example...

1099
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:20,620
we have received this body that
was under water for three days.

1100
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,830
The skin of such corpses...

1101
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:33,160
will skin out as a whole.

1102
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,370
Suppose...

1103
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,410
if a criminal gets their hands
on this,

1104
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:40,540
they can misuse these fingerprints.

1105
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,120
Apart from that,

1106
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,790
if this is preserved
in formalin solution,

1107
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,160
it will stay intact for
however long we want.

1108
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:52,580
So, we must handle
such cases very carefully.

1109
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:53,700
Okay?

1110
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,580
I shall give you old autopsy files.

1111
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,910
Study them and ask me
if you have any doubts.

1112
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,500
Mr. Kaali, please get
those old autopsy files.

1113
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:05,620
H5.

1114
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,750
Burns.

1115
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,450
BD.

1116
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:13,950
Give me that.

1117
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:29,750
This girl...

1118
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,580
Were you the one
who attended this case?

1119
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,450
You guys may leave.
Hand it over to them.

1120
01:28:58,910 --> 01:28:59,910
Kaali...

1121
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,370
I know this girl.

1122
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:04,540
I've started, Vetri.

1123
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,620
I'm about to board the bus.

1124
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,910
Okay? Shall I disconnect the call?

1125
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:12,620
I'll reach...

1126
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:18,540
Are you nuts?

1127
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,040
Come on, girl!

1128
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:22,886
Can't you find
a safe place to talk?

1129
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:24,580
- Sorry. Sorry.
- To hell with your sorry.

1130
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,200
Fine. Move to a safer place.

1131
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:27,660
Careful.

1132
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:36,580
Excuse me.

1133
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,160
Wow! You too are travelling
on this bus!

1134
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,040
Would you like a chocolate?

1135
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,080
It's okay. Have a bite.

1136
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:56,500
I don't eat chocolates.

1137
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:04,700
"Sita."

1138
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:11,660
So, where are you from?

1139
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,410
Chennai.

1140
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,080
I'll get down before you.

1141
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,250
At Poonamallee.

1142
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,040
Well, I am Angel.

1143
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,660
I didn't ask.

1144
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,700
Well, I volunteered. And you are?

1145
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:38,750
Bhadra.

1146
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:40,450
Bhadra!

1147
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,040
Fine.

1148
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:43,820
Let's get to know each other.

1149
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:47,200
I am Angel, and I am from Valparai.

1150
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:18,370
You rushed out so fast.
Are you that hungry?

1151
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:21,750
- One coffee, please.
- Okay.

1152
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:22,830
Do you want one?

1153
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,620
I'm done.

1154
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:27,120
Are you always so hyped up...

1155
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:29,950
and talkative?

1156
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:33,910
Well...

1157
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,950
guess what?

1158
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,080
This life took me on a long journey.

1159
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:43,370
A journey without any happiness.

1160
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,870
For 22 years, I was all by myself.

1161
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:47,870
I shared my emotions with myself.

1162
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,450
I lived all by myself.

1163
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,370
Then, Vetri came into my life.

1164
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,080
And now...

1165
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,040
we are expecting our daughter soon.

1166
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,910
I am so happy!

1167
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:05,950
Vetri has given me all the happiness
in this world, which I was missing.

1168
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,290
Do you want to hear
your child's movements?

1169
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:14,660
How?

1170
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:16,290
Do you want or not?

1171
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:18,040
Yes! I would love to!

1172
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:35,410
Do you hear that?

1173
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,250
I do!

1174
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,540
What's your baby telling you?

1175
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:59,500
So, you're a doctor?

1176
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,596
Yes.

1177
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:01,597
Couldn't you guess?

1178
01:33:01,621 --> 01:33:02,830
I swear I couldn't.

1179
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:07,370
So be it.

1180
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,410
Tomorrow is Vetri's birthday.
I don't know what to gift him.

1181
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,410
What did Vetri gift you
on your birthday?

1182
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,500
Nice.

1183
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:26,660
Why is this frame empty?

1184
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:28,980
Well, there is a reason behind it.

1185
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:30,290
What's that?

1186
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:34,000
I'll wear it only after I insert
my daughter's photo on that side.

1187
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:53,620
- Where is Vetri?
- He'll come. Give me the bag.

1188
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:55,410
- Are you sure?
- It's okay, I'll take care.

1189
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,580
- Fine. Take care.
- Come here.

1190
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:04,330
Bye.

1191
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,700
Call me.

1192
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,370
Do you have anything to tell me?

1193
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,080
The moment I realised
the baby was alive,

1194
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,290
I didn't know what to do.

1195
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,370
Had I taken her back
to the hospital,

1196
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,040
she would've definitely died.

1197
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,080
With whatever medical knowledge
I have,

1198
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,950
I saved her life.

1199
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:33,870
The child will be safe here, Father.

1200
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,040
I am not saying this just for Angel.

1201
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,040
If such an injustice
has happened to a girl,

1202
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:47,420
then it definitely must be brought
to the attention of the authorities.

1203
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,870
It's not as easy
as you think, Father.

1204
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:56,000
We cannot prove anything
without evidence.

1205
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,080
But you can...

1206
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:01,000
get us the evidence, Priya.

1207
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:02,870
Me?

1208
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,700
But how, madam?

1209
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:08,330
JC Hospital server will definitely
have Angel's treatment details.

1210
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,700
All you need to do
is get that for me.

1211
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,080
I'll take care of the rest.

1212
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,580
Madam, that's a huge risk!

1213
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:17,200
Those details can be found only in
Salim Rahman's personal computer.

1214
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:19,200
We must take this risk, Priya.

1215
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,540
Look at her plight.
Imagine if it was you?

1216
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,750
That innocent kid deserves justice.

1217
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:28,120
Those criminals
must answer to the law.

1218
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,500
- It's in your hands.
- Madam...

1219
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:34,580
What if things go awry?
Then my daughter's future...

1220
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,160
Madam...

1221
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,500
I will get you that evidence.

1222
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:27,660
She had an accident in the lab
and acid spilt all over her.

1223
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,080
80% of her body is damaged, madam.

1224
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,410
The chances of surviving
are very low.

1225
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,750
It was just an accident,
so we haven't informed the police...

1226
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:37,910
Please give us a minute.

1227
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,410
Okay, madam. Come on.

1228
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,660
What is it, Priya?

1229
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,120
Yes, tell me.

1230
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,580
This wasn't an accident?

1231
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:09,750
Relax.

1232
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:11,250
It's okay. It's okay.

1233
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:14,450
You'll be fine.
I'll ensure that, Priya.

1234
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,160
- Welcome, madam.
- Hi, Priya. How are you?

1235
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:33,830
I'm good. How are you?

1236
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:34,870
I'm doing great.

1237
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,620
So, you read these books.

1238
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,620
Right from childhood, I love books.

1239
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:39,830
Very good.

1240
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,660
Finished reading this book?

1241
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,290
I've just started reading it.

1242
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,500
Have you read about this author?

1243
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,250
No.

1244
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,120
Jean-Dominique,
the author of this book.

1245
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:52,200
He was completely paralysed.

1246
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:53,580
That's shocking, madam!

1247
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:55,370
Then how did he write this book?

1248
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,620
He was completely paralysed
after getting a stroke.

1249
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:02,660
He could move only one of his eyes.

1250
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:05,156
Actually, the person who gave him
his speech therapy

1251
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:06,910
helped him write this book.

1252
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,080
How?

1253
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:11,660
She'd write down the letters
on a board

1254
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:13,250
and point to them one by one.

1255
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,830
So, when she'd point to
the letter Jean wanted,

1256
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:17,000
he would blink his eye.

1257
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,500
Wait!

1258
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:42,950
Priya...

1259
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:18,700
Dad, I have prepared the food.

1260
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:21,040
So, eat well
and then go play with the corpses.

1261
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:37,790
It was you.

1262
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:40,080
You made her do this.

1263
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,330
You made her do this.

1264
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:47,660
You...

1265
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,410
That girl...

1266
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,450
That poor girl...

1267
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,500
I killed her!

1268
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:23,330
I killed her!

1269
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:37,500
Everybody said that
I committed suicide!

1270
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:39,790
But you proved that it was murder.

1271
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:43,040
Where is the guy who murdered me?
In prison, or is he still free?

1272
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:47,700
I didn't die due to stomach pain.

1273
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:49,500
Eight men raped and murdered me.

1274
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:51,250
You found that out.

1275
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:54,450
Did they get punished?

1276
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:59,250
Everybody said that
I died in an accident.

1277
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:02,750
But you found out that
I was beaten to death.

1278
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,580
Did law and order punish my killer?

1279
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,790
Or did God punish my killer?

1280
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,660
Answer me!

1281
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,580
Answer us!

1282
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,250
Answer us...

1283
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:18,910
Ma'am?

1284
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:21,950
Ma'am!

1285
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:25,330
Ma'am?

1286
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,580
We don't have the right
to punish sinners.

1287
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:50,080
Only God has the right
to punish them.

1288
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,330
In order to punish sinners,
we can be God's weapons

1289
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,290
and that's not a sin, Father.

1290
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,450
But who gets to do that among us...

1291
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:00,750
must be chosen by God.

1292
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,950
In Angel's case...

1293
01:48:03,790 --> 01:48:04,870
God has chosen...

1294
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,660
us!

1295
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:13,790
You must do me a favour.

1296
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:17,870
You must pass the information
I give you to Vetri.

1297
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:21,290
Who would help this orphan, Father?

1298
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,290
But the fact that
we are behind all this

1299
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,950
must be kept a secret from Vetri.

1300
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,830
God is the saviour for hurt souls.

1301
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:29,080
That God has now arrived
to help you.

1302
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:33,750
Father, will our prayers be answered
if we pray in church?

1303
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:34,910
Of course!

1304
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,700
Your prayers
are going to be answered.

1305
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:40,500
All you have to do
is follow my instructions

1306
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:41,790
while you're in prison.

1307
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,540
I very well know
that you didn't kill him.

1308
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,700
Who's helping you from the outside?

1309
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:47,870
God!

1310
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,000
Rest everything
will just fall in place.

1311
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:54,790
He was brutally tortured
before murdering.

1312
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:02,790
What do you want? I can
give you anything! Please!

1313
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:03,950
I don't want anything.

1314
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,370
But you see him?

1315
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:07,250
You owe him an explanation.

1316
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:13,750
You can't bring me to justice with
the data you took from my computer.

1317
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:16,000
Why indulge in such
unnecessary social service?

1318
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,950
Her heart fetched us ₹2 crore.

1319
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,450
She had a rare blood group,
AB negative.

1320
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:23,250
You are useless to me.

1321
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,790
Guys, let her go.

1322
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:26,700
You may leave, dear.

1323
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:41,160
For 35 years, he was strong
every time during any autopsy.

1324
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:45,410
I have performed many autopsies.

1325
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:48,620
And now? You have made me
perform it on my daughter!

1326
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:54,120
These last four years, every time
a girl's body is sent for autopsy,

1327
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,160
he breaks down
remembering his daughter.

1328
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:59,500
He is still waiting for justice.

1329
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,250
He deserves a judgement!

1330
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:10,120
Bones fractured in eight places.

1331
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:13,120
In this whole world...

1332
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:15,806
the first ever autopsy to be
performed on a living human...

1333
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:16,910
will be you!

1334
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:18,700
He was murdered somewhere else.

1335
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:21,410
Use petrol and set him ablaze
in the car, in some forest.

1336
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:24,660
Then his corpse was
brought here and burnt.

1337
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:27,200
I forgot my phone.

1338
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:47,847
Vishal...

1339
01:50:47,871 --> 01:50:49,711
didn't he tell us that
he's alone in the house?

1340
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,750
I feel someone else...

1341
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:04,290
The skin of such corpses

1342
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:06,120
will skin out as a whole.

1343
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,790
If a criminal
gets their hands on this,

1344
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:10,450
they can misuse these fingerprints.

1345
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,500
Throw the petrol can nearby...

1346
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:15,790
with fingerprints.

1347
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:18,886
They have used petrol
to set the victim ablaze.

1348
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:20,040
We have fingerprints.

1349
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:23,910
The police will go
only after this fingerprint.

1350
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:26,700
Salim Rahman, Abel...

1351
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:31,410
We have got the same fingerprints
at both crime scenes.

1352
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,700
As far as the fingerprints
are concerned,

1353
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:35,830
only we know who it belongs to.

1354
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:38,370
I am not saying this just for Angel.

1355
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:41,120
If such an injustice
has happened to a girl,

1356
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,476
then it definitely must be brought
to the attention of the authorities.

1357
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,540
Vetri's motive

1358
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:47,000
is to bring the truth out
in the open.

1359
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:49,540
And for that...

1360
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:52,950
Vetri or the killer
has manipulated us.

1361
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:34,000
This life took me on a long journey.

1362
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,040
A journey without any happiness.

1363
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,120
For 22 years, I was all by myself.

1364
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:41,620
I shared my emotions with myself.

1365
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:42,950
I lived all by myself.

1366
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:45,830
Then, Vetri came into my life.

1367
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,250
So long I have lived a lonely life.

1368
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:50,250
But every second
of the rest of my life,

1369
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,410
I want my Angel by my side.

1370
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,426
♪ Like peacock getting exited
At the sight of rain ♪

1371
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:57,200
♪ I get excited

1372
01:52:57,910 --> 01:53:02,250
♪ Come, let's fall deep in love ♪

1373
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,950
♪ Like peacock getting exited

1374
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,910

01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:15,660

1376
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:42,200
Sir!

1377
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,870
I'd like to talk to Vetri privately.

1378
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,500
Vetri...

1379
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:10,250
everyone you wanted to punish...

1380
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,160
has been punished
by someone else through God.

1381
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:20,120
Just a few more days, right?

1382
01:54:22,290 --> 01:54:24,000
Just leave behind
all this vengeance...

1383
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,580
and come out of prison.

1384
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,200
God...

1385
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:31,450
took away everything from me.

1386
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:41,540
Here, this Munch chocolate
is for you.

1387
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:45,790
No, you have it.

1388
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:49,160
She has a gift for you.

1389
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,580
Why is this frame empty?

1390
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:20,750
Well, there is a reason behind it.

1391
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,040
What's that?

1392
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,910
I'll wear it only after I insert
my daughter's photo on that side.

1393
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:34,040
What's happening?
Haven't you started yet?

1394
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,330
Is this all the respect
you show to the cadaver?

1395
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:38,950
Cadaver?

1396
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Who's that, ma'am?

1397
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,080
Let me explain.

1398
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:46,060
The corpse that is useful
to medical students

1399
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:48,660
in the study of human anatomy.

1400
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,700
Some orphan corpses
sent from the mortuary

1401
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:56,750
or donated corpses
for medical services

1402
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:58,000
are called cadavers.

1403
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:00,620
Sometimes...

1404
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,160
some people are useless
while they are alive

1405
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:05,540
but are useful after dying, right?

1406
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:07,120
That's what it is.

1407
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:10,200
So, that's the story
of all cadavers.

1408
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:13,450
Don't make them wait
and disrespect them.

1409
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:16,160
Go on. Proceed to
your first anatomy class.

1410
01:57:16,910 --> 01:57:17,830
Yes, ma'am.

1411
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:19,386
Breaking news on
the Salim Rahman murder case.

1412
01:57:19,410 --> 01:57:23,620
Salim Rahman's father
is now missing since two days.

1413
01:57:23,790 --> 01:57:28,096
As per reports, the fingerprints
found belong to a Bihar resident.

1414
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:29,766
It is suspected that the murderer
may have kidnapped Ali Rahman

1415
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:30,790
and taken him to Bihar.

1416
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:34,160
The police are on their way
to Bihar now to nab the killer.
