1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,667
<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

2
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,567
We're in therapy so
we can work through it.

3
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:05,649
We're in therapy

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,232
<i>because I can't accept
what happened to Dmitri,</i>

5
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,159
<i>and what's still
happening to his sister.</i>

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,673
ADMIRAL PARKER: Images show
the I-8 district of Islamabad,

7
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:14,603
where Jibral Disah is
said to be sheltered,

8
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:16,858
to be a highly exposed residential area.

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,068
DALTON: <i>We'll give Murphy
Station a diplomatic cover.</i>

10
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:23,148
Conrad wants you guys working
from inside the embassy,

11
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,278
and that's what's gonna
let me sleep at night.

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,438
(crowd shouting)

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,938
WOMAN (over P.A.): The embassy
is under an evacuation order.

14
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,608
JSOC is ready to initiate
render safe, Mr. President.

15
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,278
I'd like to wait until all of
our citizens are out of danger.

16
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,148
ELIZABETH: I appreciate
that, Mr. President.

17
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,148
But securing over 100 nuclear
warheads in a fallen regime,

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,488
with ties to multiple jihadist
groups, has to take precedence.

19
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,938
I didn't travel halfway around
the world to get on a chopper

20
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,522
the moment we have Disah in our sights.

21
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:51,398
Have you looked outside?

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,778
This city is falling apart.

23
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:55,238
Which is the perfect cover
we need to get this done.

24
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,502
JOSE: <i>This is finishing the job</i>

25
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:57,608
<i>we came here to do...</i>

26
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:59,318
<i>to kill Jibral Disah.</i>

27
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:01,209
(phone beeping)

28
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:12,788
Elizabeth...

29
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:13,998
CENTCOM just received

30
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:15,422
a coded e-mail from Murphy Station.

31
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:16,948
They got a hit on

32
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:19,498
Jibral Disah's location and
decided to stay in Islamabad.

33
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:21,658
(sighs deeply)

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,769
Please, tell me they
have a Marine detail.

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,828
Things are fluid.

36
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,038
We're trying to reach them.

37
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,099
(door opens, closes)

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,158
Yeah... me, too.

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,038
Two hours ago, I was
at a pancake social

40
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,208
in Dixville Notch,
charming party insiders,

41
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,828
when the guy at the syrup bar

42
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,158
tells me Pakistan is imploding.

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,658
Thanks for making it back so quickly.

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,038
Mr. President...

45
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,708
Mr. Jackson, welcome back.

46
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,809
You're all needed
in the Situation Room.

47
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,078
Another slow day at the office.

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,307
Prime Minister Khoosat was unfit
to lead the people of Pakistan,

49
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,248
and the people rightly took
to the streets to demonstrate...

50
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:59,448
DALTON: What's going on?

51
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,158
Abedi just declared himself

52
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,389
the new Prime Minister of Pakistan.

53
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,248
Does he have the military behind him?

54
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,124
Unclear.

55
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:08,998
Though it's totally

56
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,538
clear that he's in league
with Hizb Al-Shahid.

57
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,868
DALTON: Let the Chief of the Army Staff

58
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,328
and his principal officers know that

59
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:16,368
the United States does
not recognize Abedi,

60
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,248
and they would be wise to do the same.

61
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:21,592
Where are we on wrapping up
their nuclear weapons, Admiral?

62
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:24,248
Special Operation Forces
out of Afghanistan and Qatar

63
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:25,288
are en route.

64
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,748
Before they breach Pakistani

65
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:28,578
airspace, CYBERCOM'll
be paving the road.

66
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,908
We already killed most of
the power grid and all comms.

67
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:33,564
Still working on jamming their
surface-to-air missile capabilities.

68
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:34,248
But just in case,

69
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:35,809
we're bringing in every available drone

70
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,273
to clean up any bumps along the way.

71
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:38,723
Then what?

72
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:42,038
Pakistan's 110 nuclear weapons

73
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,578
are stored in 12 bunkers,
scattered all over the country.

74
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,482
We'll be handling the
seven in the northern half

75
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,908
that account for 68 bombs.

76
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:52,158
The Russians will be taking
the five bunkers in the south.

77
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,078
However, far as we can tell,

78
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,368
the Russians haven't
launched any units yet.

79
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:58,908
I can reach out to
Minister Avdonin about that.

80
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,248
How long do we expect all this to take?

81
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,618
Assuming our Intel on
bunker locations is good,

82
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:06,408
six hours till taillights
over the border.

83
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,912
COLONEL: Mr. President, I have
Murphy Station on the line, sir.

84
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:10,618
DALTON: Put them on speaker, Colonel.

85
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,498
Give us your status, Murphy.

86
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:15,038
En route to Islamabad's I-8 district.

87
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,368
If our Intel is right,

88
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,618
we should be staking out
Jibral Disah's location

89
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:19,998
in about 30 minutes.

90
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,498
Hey, it's Elizabeth.

91
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:23,288
McCord.

92
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:24,658
Hey.

93
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,498
You should know

94
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,078
we've initiated an operation to...

95
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,118
(honking horn)

96
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,788
...secure all of Pakistan's nuclear

97
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:34,708
weapons, so... most of
their power grid's down.

98
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,012
We'll be coming in pretty heavy,

99
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:37,658
with Russian Special Forces joining in.

100
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,368
FELLOWS: Copy that.

101
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:40,448
Get it done and get out.

102
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:41,288
(crowd shouting)

103
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,748
Murphy Station, could you, uh,

104
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:44,349
could you give us a second?

105
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:48,158
Mr. President, there are riots

106
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,302
raging throughout Islamabad.

107
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:50,328
I, uh...

108
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,788
I'm questioning the wisdom of leaving

109
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:55,038
three high value assets
to take out this terrorist,

110
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,328
in a rapidly deteriorating situation,

111
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,328
while we have bigger fish to fry.

112
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,408
You want to abort the Disah mission.

113
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,788
As much as I would love to light that

114
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,948
son of a bitch up,

115
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,809
render safe has to be our priority.

116
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,099
Elizabeth?

117
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:16,679
I think we should back
Murphy Station's play, sir.

118
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,078
Walk and chew gum at the
same time, it is then.

119
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,368
Let's get it done. All of it.

120
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:24,658
Yes, sir.

121
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,219
Maybe she's sick of you.

122
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,759
(Jose laughs)

123
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,259
Ma'am.

124
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,708
It's Allison. She says
it's an emergency.

125
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,828
Ali, baby, what's going on?
Are you okay?

126
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,812
You didn't sign the New
York trip permission slip.

127
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:47,408
So you're not bleeding out
on the street somewhere?

128
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,078
I left it on the coffee
maker last night.

129
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,368
Well, I ended up staying
at work all night.

130
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:54,828
Oh, yeah, that'll fly with Dean Ward.

131
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,972
Quaker education is all
about personal responsibility.

132
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,408
You know Richard Nixon was a Quaker.

133
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,809
Just saying.

134
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,328
If it's not signed by 3:00,
I'll be stuck in study hall

135
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,072
while all of my friends
are seeing <i>Hamilton.</i>

136
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,038
Oh, <i>Hamilton, </i>well...

137
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,908
I'll have Blake take care of it.

138
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,328
But listen, no more saying
that it's an emergency

139
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,639
unless there are paramedics
or SWAT teams involved.

140
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,889
I love you, baby.

141
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:20,748
What am I taking care of?

142
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:23,259
Appeasing a fascist Quaker.

143
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:26,408
Minister Avdonin,

144
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,828
thanks for coming,

145
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,332
but a phone call would have sufficed.

146
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,538
I wanted to tell you in person

147
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,809
that Russia has decided to
back Abedi as prime minister.

148
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,874
You can't be serious.

149
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,038
Madam Secretary...

150
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,368
Of course you're serious. But... Abedi?

151
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,658
Who basically murdered the
legitimate prime minister

152
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,658
and is in bed with the
worst terrorists on Earth?

153
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,708
That guy?

154
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:50,038
Pakistan has a long
history of cooperating

155
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,681
- with jihadist groups.
- But none of them

156
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:55,078
ever set off a dirty bomb
inside the United States.

157
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,828
We will never get behind anybody
associated with Hizb Al-Shahid.

158
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:02,788
That's...

159
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,639
Oh, my God.

160
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,498
You're backing out of render safe.

161
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:11,158
We agreed to it before Abedi took power.

162
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,498
Abedi hasn't taken power,

163
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:15,578
and it is absurd to think that

164
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,618
he could hold that country together.

165
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:20,448
Our intelligence agencies
have already seen fissures

166
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,578
in the Pakistani military.

167
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:24,038
Are those the same
intelligence agencies

168
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,099
that were so sure Russia
hacked Air Force One?

169
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:33,618
Konstantin, our joint render
safe plan has been in place

170
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:37,139
for years, and it's happening now.

171
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,658
You can't just back out of it

172
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,448
like it's an annoying dinner party.

173
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,078
(phone blipping, buzzing)

174
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,288
I should let you go.

175
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,259
There's nothing more to discuss.

176
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,139
(sighs)

177
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:54,708
Hello.

178
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:55,708
You okay?

179
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,748
I'm...

180
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,038
(sighs)

181
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,948
I'm okay, I'm... I'm...

182
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:03,038
Yeah. I'm...

183
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,078
We got this.

184
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,208
Seriously, don't worry.

185
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,828
I believe you.

186
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:11,658
Look, I-I don't want to hang up,
Henry, but I-I just found out

187
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,042
the Russians are bailing on us,
and I've got to brief POTUS.

188
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:14,889
Wait, don't hang up.

189
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,828
Go.

190
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,929
Just hold on.

191
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:24,448
Look, I know I wasn't
marrying a couch potato and...

192
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,828
I don't know how to say this.

193
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,038
I...

194
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,509
I love you, so don't die on me, okay?

195
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:36,788
Copy that.

196
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,368
And I love you.

197
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,618
Now I gotta go, too.

198
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,969
(sighs)

199
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,599
Yeah, the two-story one
with the blue trim.

200
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,049
SUVs out front.

201
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,908
They could be out of there
pretty quick, if they had to.

202
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:04,078
Son of a bitch is in there.

203
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,078
I can feel the dark side

204
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,408
of the Force.

205
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,748
Well, we wait until we see him.

206
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,158
I'll call for a drone.

207
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,549
Or a droid.

208
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:19,038
President Salnikov won't budge.

209
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,158
We're on our own.

210
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,038
So what does that look like, Admiral?

211
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,998
Five more sites,
hundreds of miles apart.

212
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,618
It'll extend the mission
to closer to ten hours.

213
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:29,868
Can't we move faster
by destroying the bombs?

214
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,572
PARKER: Yes, sir,
transporting the warheads

215
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:33,038
is the most time-consuming part.

216
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,578
We can switch to disarming them,

217
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,578
removing the nuclear material, and then

218
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,828
hitting the bunkers with drones.

219
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:42,509
It'll save two hours, more or less.

220
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,078
It's noisy...

221
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,448
and messy.

222
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:47,708
Certainly be more casualties.

223
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:48,788
And it'll look

224
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,448
a hell of a lot more like an invasion.

225
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:54,498
PARKER: All of the above, and
it'll stretch our drone capacity,

226
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:56,049
but it'll get the job done.

227
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,408
Do it, Admiral.

228
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,809
Sir.

229
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,498
Where are we with Murphy Station?

230
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,038
We should've grabbed some food.

231
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,310
While the embassy was being
overrun? That's a good idea.

232
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:21,415
JOSE: How long would it have taken to
stop and get some take-out or something?

233
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,155
Guys, guys, front door open.

234
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,618
Any of them Disah?

00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,828
Yep, I'm confirming.

239
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:34,828
It's him.

240
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,012
Murphy Station to Reaper One.

241
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,908
Requesting strike at 4-3-S-C-T-2-8.

242
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:39,998

00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,408
to the one I requested to be
standing by an hour ago?! Over.

247
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:48,748
Pulling double duty.

248
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:50,788
Just under three minutes. Incoming.

249
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:51,618
The phone's not with them.

250
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:52,661
- What?
- It's not moving.

251
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:53,658
It's still in the house.

252
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,162
No time, Reaper One, losing our eyes.

253
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,828
We need a strike right now,
damn it. Over.

254
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,412
Copy. Two and a half minutes. Incoming.

I'm gonna kill this guy.

256
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,238
- We gotta follow them or we'll lose them.
- No.

257
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,659
- Three minutes, they'll be gone.
- FELLOWS: But at least...

258
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,828
They'll make us in three seconds.

259
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,349
FELLOWS: Then we'll keep our distance.

260
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,093
Whatever happened
to finishing the damn job?

00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:09,788
Stay the hell back.

they killed Jibral Disah,

on Earth, and JSOC

313
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:22,027

Where's the gun?

336
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:21,987
I got it, I got it.

337
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:23,211
- (speaking Urdu)
- Keep quiet.

338
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:24,407
- Anyone hit?
- Be quiet. No.

339
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:26,008
No thanks to Hamlet McCord here.

340
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:28,577
Sit down.

341
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:29,867
Stay right there.

342
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:31,251
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.

343
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:32,197
Why the hell not?

344
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:33,388
He could've killed us!

345
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:34,577
Just tell him!

346
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,407
Tell him we're here to help.

No, ma'am. Sorry.

356
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:02,261

00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:11,527
Okay.

362
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:12,827
See?

363
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,902
Walking and chewing gum.

364
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:15,623
We got this.

365
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:16,571
Well, I'm glad you feel that way,

366
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:18,036
because the Chinese foreign minister

367
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,103
has requested a meeting.

368
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,282
He and every other
Security Council member.

369
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:23,702
They want to yell at us
for breaking Pakistan.

370
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:24,992
Yes, but, uh,

371
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,902
Minister Chen has been
particularly insistent.

372
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:29,032
Well, China shares a
border with Pakistan.

373
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,362
I get it, but not today.

374
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:32,532
I have got to shut my
eyes for a few minutes,

375
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:36,572
or I might accidentally
impose sanctions on Canada.

376
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,282
(sighs)

377
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,652
He's in my office, isn't he?

378
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:42,112
I really have to work on
saying no to powerful people.

379
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,282
I'm a powerful people pleaser.

380
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,883
We all have things we
have to work on, Blake.

381
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:51,152
Minister Chen!

382
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:52,572
What a surprise.

383
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,133
Madam Secretary.

384
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:57,052
My government is gravely concerned

385
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:59,092
about your incursion in Pakistan.

386
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:03,052
Yes, I heard your president's blanket

387
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,052
condemnation: "A scourge!

388
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:07,512
A diabolical scourge on the region."

389
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:09,342
I'm guessing that something

390
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,922
got lost in translation,

391
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,552
but you're here to clarify,

392
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:14,632
aren't you?

393
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:15,842
We do, indeed,

394
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:18,512
condemn your hostile and destabilizing

395
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:21,012
actions in the harshest possible terms.

396
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:26,233
However, unofficially, I am
here to ask how China can help.

397
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:33,462
Well, it... would have to
involve a time machine.

398
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:35,962
You know we've been

399
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:39,342
trying to bring China into
our Pakistan render safe plan

400
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:40,842
for years now.

401
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:44,222
You have an expression:
"Better late than never."

402
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,012
I prefer, "Timing is everything."

403
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:50,273
May I ask how the operation is going?

404
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:58,342
We have secured the weapons
at 11 of their 12 bunkers.

405
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:01,962
We're facing less resistance
as we go, probably because

406
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:03,842
Abedi's grip on the
military is fracturing.

407
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,302
This is our intelligence
assessment, as well.

408
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:08,172
Great superpower minds...

409
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:09,262
If all goes

410
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:11,302
according to plan, we should be done

411
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,962
within the hour.

412
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:14,802
Well, if it doesn't,
we'll be taking you up

413
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:15,802
on your offer to help,

414
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,422
which is very much appreciated.

415
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:21,462
Thank you, Elizabeth.

416
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,443
You bet.

417
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,382
(quietly, sighing):
Oh... my God. Oh, my God.

418
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:32,613
Ma'am, you're needed
in the Situation Room.

419
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,323
Sorry, still no word on Henry.

420
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:42,552
Thanks, Blake.

421
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,653
Mm-hmm.

422
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,882
(indistinct conversations)

423
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:53,172
JSOC team's landing at Petaro.

424
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:56,012
Home of the last of
the Pakistani nukes.

425
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,436
I have an update on Murphy Station.

426
00:16:57,437 --> 00:17:00,342
They're holed up in the
back room of a grocery store

427
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:03,302
in the northeast quadrant
of the I-8 district.

428
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:04,863
Our exfil unit is 20 minutes out.

429
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,632
JSOC LEADER: Night Owl, someone got

430
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,592
here before us.

431
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:15,012
We have multiple Pakistani army
dead, security barriers smashed,

432
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,092
and it looks like the cold
room has been breached.

433
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:19,092
Copy.

434
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:20,132
How about the heavy bags?

435
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,193
Entering cold room.

436
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,512
They're gone.

437
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,592
The heavy bags are not here, sir.

438
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,336
How many were supposed
to be there, Admiral?

439
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,592
Six tactical nuclear warheads.

440
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,012
So, they're small...

441
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,592
and easily transportable.

442
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:40,013
And very well may have fallen
into the hands of terrorists.

443
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:54,023
Hizb Al-Shahid is now

444
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:56,773
a caliphate armed with nuclear weapons.

445
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,193
This is God's will.

446
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,403
It is God's will to bring
the infidels to their knees

447
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:02,153
and exterminate them.

448
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:04,653
These nuclear bombs will
rain fire on your cities

449
00:18:04,654 --> 00:18:06,523
and bring death to millions.

450
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:08,903
There is no refuge for the unbelievers.

451
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,215
Those who do not turn
to the one, true God,

452
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,634
will perish in flames.

453
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:13,974
God is mer...

454
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:14,974
Damn thing'll probably

455
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,514
get more views than the kid

456
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:18,844
biting his brother's finger.

457
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:21,304
It was Hizb Al-Shahid's plan all along.

458
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:24,054
Cozy up to the world's
most unstable nuclear power,

459
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:25,884
foment chaos, then
steal their warheads.

460
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,327
China offered their help earlier,

461
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:31,157
so I've just reached
out to Minister Chen

462
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:32,657
to seal their border.

463
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:35,157
I'm also reaching out to Afghanistan,

464
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,077
India, and even Iran

465
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:38,997
to do the same. CENTCOM is scrambling

466
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,747
to quarantine the Pakistani coast.

467
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:43,447
Our entire military and
IC is focused on closing

468
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,247
the circle on them, fast.

469
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:50,287
And I'm having my staff
coordinate with ISN.

470
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:53,617
See if they can game out HS's

471
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:55,117
plans for the bombs.

472
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,497
God help us if any of them

473
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:58,928
make it out of Pakistan.

474
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:04,497
My official statement is that

475
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:06,445
I don't yet have an
official statement, Evan.

476
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,655
Yeah, you bet that's a tautology,

477
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:10,945
like you being up your own ass.

478
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:13,216
(low, indistinct conversation)

479
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:17,792
How's the official statement coming?

480
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:20,372
Is it insensitive to say it
feels harder than render safe?

481
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:21,621
Make sure it sounds like it is

482
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:22,741
not a hostile takeover.

483
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,541
Even though it kind of
is a hostile takeover?

484
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:27,041
(sighs) A top-secret one with
the whole world watching.

485
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,241
Oh, so, your classic non-denial denial.

486
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,602
- More denial-denial.
- Wait, isn't

487
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:31,906
denial-denial an acknowledgment?

488
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:33,741
Without actually acknowledging.

489
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:36,041
So, not lying, but not
really truthing either.

490
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,241
And definitely nothing
about loose nukes.

491
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:40,121
Even though there's a video.

492
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,911
Okay, so, one deluxe denial-denial,

493
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,707
hold the nukes, side of truth.

494
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,029
Like that.

495
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,749
So, if I'm Hizb Al-Shahid,

496
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,499
where am I hiding those warheads?

497
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,129
(chuckling): It's a big country, Jay.

498
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,959
Yes, but this is Petaro,

499
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,579
where the warheads were
taken about two hours ago,

500
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,523
so they can't be more than
a couple hundred miles

501
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:00,669
from there, meaning they are

502
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,789
somewhere... in here.

503
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,129
(chuckles)

504
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,959
That's over 100,000 square miles.

505
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,539
Okay.

506
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,959
Uh, so, Karachi is a city
of about 24 million.

507
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,459
A lot of other villages,
some desert, coast.

508
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,539
Where in here would you want to
hide six tactical nuclear bombs?

509
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,499
I have absolutely no idea,

510
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,129
but I do know if these
terrorists have a bomb,

511
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,499
they'll want to use it.

512
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,669
Really, Walter? You think?

513
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,079
I mean, I get that we're looking

514
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,459
for a needle in a haystack,

515
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,839
but I have this crazy suspicion
that pessimism, sarcasm

516
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,339
and utter defeatism aren't gonna help

517
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,043
stop the greatest
threat to our way of life

518
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:37,169
we've ever encountered, so,

519
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,339
if that's all you got, you should go...

520
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,579
but I'm a father now, and if
these bombs make it here

521
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,579
and, God forbid, they,
"rain fire on our cities

522
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,999
and bring death to millions,"
I at least want to know that

523
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,709
I did everything we could
to stop it, even when

524
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,289
it was hard and seemed hopeless.

525
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,209
That's very moving, Jay.

526
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,579
But I repeat:

527
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,209
If Hizb Al-Shahid
terrorists have a bomb,

528
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,539
they'll want to use it,

529
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,209
and that is an idea we
can actually work with.

530
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,459
We can?

531
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,789
Do you know how to
detonate a nuclear weapon?

532
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,169
Now, there's...

533
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,999
no red button, no plunger.

534
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,879
They're not manufactured
by the ACME Corporation.

535
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,169
Without authorization codes

536
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,499
from the Pakistani Prime
Minister, you'll need

537
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,579
to rewire the firing
set without activating

538
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,039
the bomb's penalty system.

539
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,289
You'll need to remove
the airburst fuse without

540
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,709
exposing yourself to a lethal
dose of alpha radiation.

541
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,209
Do you know how many people in
Pakistan can actually do that?

542
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,249
No.

543
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,419
Fourteen.

544
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,789
There are only 14 nuclear scientists

545
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,459
with the expertise to turn a
nuclear warhead into anything

546
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,789
remotely useful to a non-state actor.

547
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,999
So, if we can figure out if
one of these scientists is

548
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,039
in cahoots with Hizb Al-Shahid,

549
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,919
then we might be able to
track him to the bombs.

550
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,709
Huh.

551
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,289
I don't want my children to be vaporized

552
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,770
any more than you want yours to, Jay.

553
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,289
Our air force is prepared
to send aerial surveillance

554
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,379
along the Afghan border.

555
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,499
ELIZABETH: We'll take it.

556
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,419
But it's the quarantine
of Pakistan's coast

557
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,459
where we could really
use some quick backup.

558
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,419
Our ships can only go so fast.

559
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,249
I'll bring this to Li immediately.

560
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,350
(two knocks on door)

561
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,499
Russell Jackson would like a word.

562
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,749
Thanks, Ming.

563
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,669
I gotta go.

564
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,169
Any idea what it's about?

565
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,919
Uh, no, but I just heard
from Dean Ward's office,

566
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,200
and there's been a slight hiccup

567
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:43,424
with Alison's permission slip.

568
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:44,629
How slight?

569
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,879
Well, apparently, a student
recently managed to Photoshop

570
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,289
his dad's signature
on a truancy notice,

571
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,039
prompting Dean Ward
to change official policy,

572
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,919
now requiring original
parent signatures

573
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,959
on all student forms.

574
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,129
I signed the form, Blake.

575
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,249
I'm not hearing the hiccup.

576
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,993
Turns out I was not aware
of the new policy,

577
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:01,129
and I e-mailed it in.

578
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,844
- Ah... - And now it's too late
to messenger the form over

579
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,289
by the deadline at the
end of the school day,

580
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,673
and I-I really... I am so sorry...

581
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:08,579
All right. It's okay. It's okay.

582
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,499
You just have to call Dean Ward.

583
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,999
Tell her I am personally asking

584
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,379
for an exception to this rule.

585
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,669
I mean, I would do it, but, you know,

586
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,499
things are so crazy around here,

587
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,209
and given our history...

588
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,419
I don't trust myself
to be polite, so...

589
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,350
you have to do it.

590
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,810
I will make the call, ma'am.

591
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,339
I don't like the look of this.

592
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,209
Murphy Station's exfil team got
bogged down in small arms fire

593
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,039
as they rolled into Islamabad.

594
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,339
Pakistani military?

595
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,839
(sighs) Warring factions
in their ranks, apparently,

596
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,539
or rioters, or God knows what else.

597
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,480
So now what?

598
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,039
Well, there's a, uh, cricket field

599
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,129
two miles north of
Murphy's current location.

600
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,709
We should be able to
put a chopper down.

601
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,039
And the three of them are just
supposed to hoof it there?

602
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,958
Parker thinks, if they
keep a low profile,

603
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,822
they should be able to
get through the streets.

604
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:08,977
With Jose bleeding out?

605
00:24:08,978 --> 00:24:11,890
Oh, my God. (sighs)

606
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,669
We never should have let them stay.

607
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,669
Elizabeth...

608
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,919
No, no, you were right.

609
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,379
No. I wasn't.

610
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,499
Look, imagine how much
worse this would all be

611
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,249
if Jibral Disah was still alive.

612
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,039
Say what you want
about the evil bastard,

613
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,669
he was a brilliant tactician.

614
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,459
I like our odds of
finding those warheads

615
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,940
a hell of a lot better with
him out of the picture.

616
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,419
(groans)

617
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,039
Okay, Jose.

618
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,640
(distant gunfire popping)

619
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,680
JOSE: Thanks.

620
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,180
(distant gunfire continuing)

621
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,140
Good?

622
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,419
We gotta try to move.

623
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,919
You think you can stand up, pal?

624
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,339
Screw this.

625
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,339
Let's go.

626
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,680
Okay.

627
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,629
FELLOWS: Okay.

628
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,079
(Jose groaning)

629
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,703
- HENRY: No, there's no way.
- FELLOWS: Yeah, just lean backwards.

630
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:14,459
There you go.

631
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,499
Well, we don't have a plan B.

632
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,839
You guys go.

633
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,749
Out of the question.
We're staying together.

634
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,039
Marines crap.

635
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,980
Jane, cancel the exfil.

636
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,020
Ah, the phone's dead.

637
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,129
Hey, Henry...

638
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,020
Come on.

639
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,339
Look, I think his lung's collapsing.

640
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,600
We need to blow it back up.

641
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,919
How do... how...

642
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,129
Needle thoracostomy.

643
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,339
It's basically a-a needle
with a valve on the end.

644
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,512
You jam it into the lung,

645
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,217
and it gives you relief
for a little while.

646
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,289
You know how to do that?

647
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,959
Well... field ops get
basic medical training.

648
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,129
I could try.

649
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,789
Uh, we need a chest compression needle.

650
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,060
Any hospital should have one.

651
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,499
Okay, I'll go.

652
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,603
Wh... you really think you
can make it to a hospital?

653
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:07,839
I don't know. It was your idea.

654
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,709
Yeah, well, I'm just thinking out loud.

655
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,750
Look, even if you made it,

656
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:14,134
an American showing up at a
hospital when half the country's

657
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:16,402
out there chanting "Death to America,"

658
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:18,263
they'd string you up
to the nearest lamppost.

659
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:22,942
Look, maybe I could
Jerry-rig a needle and valve

660
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:25,203
with a pen or something.

661
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:29,442
Maybe he could go.

662
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:31,232
The guy we tied up to
a chair at gunpoint?

663
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:32,852
Look, I gave him something to drink,

664
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:34,236
he didn't spit it back in my face.

665
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:36,232
He's seen Jose suffering,
maybe he has compassion.

666
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:37,562
He'll know where a hospital is,

667
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,546
and he's not going to get
strung up on a lamppost.

668
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:42,062
From where I stand,
it checks off a lot of boxes.

669
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:44,732
We'll need the guy with the
failing lung to translate.

670
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,743
Let's not waste any time.

671
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:23,984
I just heard from the DNI himself,

672
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:26,943
about the last Pakistani
scientist... Sadozai.

673
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:30,403
He's in Tehran... visiting family.

674
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,073
WALTER: That's comforting.

675
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:33,733
So much for your theory.

676
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,523
No, it's not a theory, Jay.

677
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,193
It may not be one of these men,

678
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:40,363
but Hizb Al-Shahid has a competent hand

679
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:42,693
tending to those warheads.

680
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,642
Okay, so what other countries
with nuclear programs

681
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:47,851
could they possibly have
recruited someone from?

682
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:50,721
Uh, certainly not India.

683
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:52,061
(typing rapidly) Russia?

684
00:27:52,062 --> 00:27:53,162
Mm-mm.

685
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,391
Moldova?

686
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:56,521
Hizb Al-Shahid

687
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:58,981
bribed that Moldovan nuclear inspector

688
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:00,662
to help steal uranium
for their dirty bomb.

689
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:02,326
At the time,
you said that looking for him

690
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,061
would be a dead end,
that we should focus

691
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:05,542
on the end buyer, and you were right.

692
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:06,807
Did you ever catch up with him?

693
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:08,787
No. Last I heard,
we gave his name to Interpol.

694
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,037
Here we go.

695
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:12,957
Iancu Balan.

696
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,657
Former chief nuclear inspector

697
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:17,907
at the Rajlyan Power Plant in Tiraspol.

698
00:28:17,908 --> 00:28:21,287
He's already working
with Hizb Al-Shahid.

699
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:25,157
Would he have the expertise
you're talking about?

700
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:26,157
Yeah.

701
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:28,657
I think he would.

702
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:32,178
And I think I know how to find him.

703
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:35,327
Iancu Balan?

704
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:36,997
WALTER: He grew up in Moscow

705
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:39,577
and was trained at the
Kurchatov Institute.

706
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:41,407
We assume your government
sent him to Moldova.

707
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:43,997
Of course, you weren't
counting on him going rogue.

708
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,577
We know you keep close tabs
on your nuclear scientists.

709
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:48,247
We want everything
you've got on this one.

710
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:51,617
We might be willing
to share intelligence,

711
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:53,867
if the price is right.

712
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:57,697
Really? Um... actually,
can you guys, uh,

713
00:28:57,698 --> 00:29:00,758
give Minister Avdonin
and me the room... please?

714
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,287
Do you remember the last time we spoke?

715
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:12,787
You were telling me how
Abedi was going to ascend

716
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:14,157
to the throne of Pakistan,

717
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:16,457
and everything was going to be great?

718
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,117
Yeah. We certainly overestimated

719
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:19,787
Abedi's viability.

720
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:21,211
Well, that's one way of putting it.

721
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:22,287
Here's another:

722
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:25,367
Your rainbow and unicorn
assessment of Abedi aside,

723
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,287
you pulled out of render safe,

724
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:30,287
and now Hizb Al-Shahid
has six nuclear weapons

725
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:34,117
putting a significant
portion of humanity at risk.

726
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:36,997
You want something from us,
Madam Secretary,

727
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:39,657
I'd simply like something in return.

728
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,907
Releasing Peter Buckley to us,

729
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:42,868
for instance.

730
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:43,928
Peter Buckley.

731
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:47,367
One of the most notorious spies

732
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,247
to ever sell U.S. secrets
to your government?

733
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,157
Sure.

734
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:55,037
We'll gladly ship him to Russia.

735
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:56,537
In a box.

736
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:58,848
But never while he's still breathing.

737
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:03,138
I expect the dossier on
Balan within the hour.

738
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,537
Okay. Let's get started.

739
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:29,697
What did you find, Oliver?

740
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:31,401
Iancu Balan was last
seen three months ago,

741
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:34,287
leaving Rajlyan Power
Plant in Tiraspol.

742
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:35,831
We all know about the uranium he stole

743
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:37,457
and gave to Hizb Al-Shahid.

744
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,037
But Russian GRU shared that he visited

745
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,827
his brother in Moscow
eleven months ago.

746
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:44,327
During that visit,
he was invited to meet

747
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:46,311
with Russian officials at
his old stomping ground,

748
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,697
the Kurchatov Institute.

749
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:49,161
Russian agents took that opportunity

750
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:51,617
to upload a privileged access
rootkit onto his laptop.

751
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:53,197
And you can access it?

752
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:54,367
I've turned it on remotely,

753
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:56,190
and fired up its wireless router.

754
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:58,310
If the power's down in Pakistan,

755
00:30:58,311 --> 00:30:59,719
how are you going to find it?

756
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,059
He who shutteth down the grid
can selectively turn it back on.

757
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,524
With your permission, Mr. President.

758
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:07,092
Do whatever you need to.

759
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,627
Ah, boom.

760
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,849
Or, should I say, ping...

761
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,530
uh, off a cell tower in Gadani.

762
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,296
That's here, near the coast.

763
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:27,386
They're trying to get
the bombs out by boat.

764
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,676
Well, or maybe our naval quarantine

765
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:31,926
with the Chinese is
making them reconsider.

766
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:33,546
Can you give us parameters, Oliver?

767
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:34,716
Yes, sir.

768
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:36,926
I can narrow it down
to 12 square miles.

769
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,096
I'll send the area directly to CENTCOM.

770
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,836
Let's move every available
asset into that region.

771
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:42,926
Yes, sir.

772
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,777
Pray to God that we're not too late.

773
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,510
FELLOWS: It's been too long.

774
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:05,180
We have to start planning
for if he doesn't come back.

775
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:08,010
If he doesn't come back, I'll go.

776
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,281
Henry.

777
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,010
Hey.

778
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:13,510
We're getting you help.

779
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,100
Yeah, sure.

780
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:18,680
You and I both know that
shopkeeper's probably

781
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:20,281
home shtooping his wife.

782
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:23,140
Listen.

783
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,930
I'm a lapsed Catholic.

784
00:32:24,931 --> 00:32:26,930
I know it's hard to believe.

785
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:28,411
I'm sure the Almighty has seen worse.

786
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:29,651
I haven't been to church since

787
00:32:29,652 --> 00:32:31,970
9/11.

788
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:35,310
Got busy...

789
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:36,720
and maybe a little pissed off.

790
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:37,720
God can take it.

791
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:40,821
I still want to hedge my bet.

792
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:45,411
Give me my last rites, buddy.

793
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:49,076
You're not dying.

794
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:49,970
I know.

795
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,411
I'm a model of good health.

796
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,850
But just in case.

797
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:58,470
Only a priest can give the
sacrament of last rites.

798
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:02,060
Oh, come on, altar boy.

799
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:05,161
Can you just perform
some prayer for the sick?

800
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,970
Can you do that, please?

801
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:13,991
It'll be enough for me to be at peace.

802
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,270
Lord and Father, Almighty

803
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,294
and Eternal God, by your
blessings give us strength

804
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:47,180
and support in our frailty.

805
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:49,640
Turn with kindness
toward this your servant.

806
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,470
Free him from all illness and...

807
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:54,430
um...

808
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:57,411
free him from all illness and...

809
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,220
(chuckles)

810
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:02,571
Oh, hell...

811
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,970
Are you sorry for your sins?

812
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:09,140
Yeah.

813
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,371
(crashing and thudding in distance)

814
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,510
(speaking Urdu)

815
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:18,326
What is he saying?

816
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:19,140
Jose, ask who he is.

817
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,241
He says you need doctor.

818
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:24,451
You a doctor?

819
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:27,871
Yeah. Come on.

820
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,050
_

821
00:34:31,422 --> 00:34:33,198
_

822
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:34,840
_

823
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:39,664
_

824
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,247
_

825
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:56,186
_

826
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,180
(men shouting in Arabic)

827
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,680
(gunfire)

828
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:08,890
SOLDIER: <i>Target neutralized.</i>

829
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:11,611
<i>Moving to secure warheads.</i>

830
00:35:24,271 --> 00:35:25,640
Hey, hey.

831
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:27,060
What? Oh.

832
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,560
We got the nukes. All six of them.

833
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,560
What about...?

834
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,720
The SEAL team will reach

835
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,704
Murphy Station's rendezvous
point in five minutes.

836
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:35,725
Okay, okay.

837
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
COMMANDER: Spartan Six
landing at rendezvous point.

838
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:41,640
PARKER: Copy, Spartan.

839
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,270
Any sign of Murphy Station?

840
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:44,890
Over.

841
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:47,951
Negative, Night Owl.

842
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,623
- Shots fired!
- (gunfire over video)

843
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:51,661
(soldiers shouting)

844
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:52,951
Damn it.

845
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:59,470
We're good.

846
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:01,220
Gunfire nearby, not directed at us.

847
00:36:01,221 --> 00:36:02,430
Copy.

848
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,331
They'll wait ten minutes,
then pull up stakes.

849
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:08,754
COMMANDER: There's
movement about 60 yards away.

850
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:09,430
Approaching.

851
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:10,470
PARKER: Can you confirm

852
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:11,600
it's Murphy Station?

853
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,701
Over.

854
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,720
Affirmative, Night Owl.

855
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:20,930
We have eyes on
Murphy Station. Full set.

856
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,871
Making contact, preparing for extract.

857
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,201
Got them.

858
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:40,970
Congratulations, Murphy
Station, on a job well done.

859
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:42,430
Thank you, Mr. President.

860
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:45,100
I'm here with the Secretary of State

861
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:47,270
and the rest of the NSC.

862
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,054
We're all looking forward
to you coming home.

863
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:51,100
Thank you, sir.

864
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:53,970
I think I'm gonna take
some of my vacation days.

865
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:55,770
I look forward

866
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,821
to being a couch potato for a while.

867
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:00,951
DALTON: Well deserved, Henry.

868
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,060
I should address the nation.

869
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:05,140
Well, it never gets old.

870
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,770
I'll set it up.

871
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:09,810
Uh, tell Henry I'll buy him
a drink when he gets back.

872
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,470
Well, I think you can buy me one, too.

873
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:13,770
Blake.

874
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:14,521
ELIZABETH: Hey.

875
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:15,270
Sir.

876
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,510
Listen, will you, uh,

877
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:18,720
find out if Minister
Avdonin is still in town?

878
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:19,556
Okay?

879
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:20,491
Of course.

880
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:23,350
What?

881
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,814
Ma'am, I did everything I could
to get Dean Ward on the phone,

882
00:37:25,815 --> 00:37:27,430
and when I say everything, I mean...

883
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:29,054
Short of sending a
special envoy, got it.

884
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:32,640
Yes, uh, finally, her assistant,
Marigold, got back to me.

885
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,680
She said it was a settled issue.

886
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:37,890
She said that?

887
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:39,470
"Settled issue"?

888
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:40,560
Those exact words.

889
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,064
They're playing on a loop in my head.

890
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,260
Put a pin in Minister Avdonin

891
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,310
and find me Dean Ward.

892
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,310
Get her on the phone?

893
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:48,350
No, find out where she is.

894
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:49,951
Right now?

895
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,930
ELIZABETH: Dean Ward,
what a coincidence.

896
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,310
Madam Secretary.

897
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:57,810
I didn't know you went here.

898
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:59,220
I don't. That was a joke.

899
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:01,600
I was hoping to talk to you about

900
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:03,100
the 11th grade field trip.

901
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:04,421
I believe my assistant, Marigold,

902
00:38:04,422 --> 00:38:05,885
- spoke to your assistant.
- I heard.

903
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:07,271
- "Settled issue."
- That's right.

904
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:08,430
Here's the thing.

905
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,930
Alison really has her
heart set on this trip,

906
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:12,590
and, well, she shouldn't be left behind

907
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:13,880
just because I messed up.

908
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,683
- Madam Secretary...
- No, please, just let me

909
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,300
say my piece.

910
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:21,140
Now I don't know if you noticed,
but it's been pretty hectic

911
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:23,300
the last couple of days
in the world, and, well,

912
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,140
I haven't focused too much on my kids,

913
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:27,590
which I promised wouldn't
happen when I took this job,

914
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:28,734
but who am I kidding, right?

915
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:30,590
But not being present for them

916
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:32,930
is different than
completely letting them down,

917
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:35,590
so I-I-I'm throwing myself
at your mercy here.

918
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:38,720
When my assistant said
it was a settled issue,

919
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:39,741
Madam Secretary...

920
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:40,760
Really?

921
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:42,224
You're sticking with "settled issue"?

922
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:44,340
Fine, what's it gonna take
to get Alison on that bus?

923
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:45,764
You want dinner with the president?

924
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:47,510
I don't know, Air Force
One more your thing?

925
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:48,880
What are we talking about here?

926
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:50,800
'Cause I got to tell you, I have
dealt with brutal dictators

927
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,970
that were more flexible,
and, frankly, just a little

928
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:54,340
bit more likable than you.

929
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:55,380
Are you finished?

930
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:57,260
Depends on your answer.

931
00:38:57,261 --> 00:39:01,800
When I told my assistant Marigold

932
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:05,470
to tell your assistant
that it was a settled issue

933
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:09,010
it was because Alison had come
to my office and very politely

934
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:12,800
and respectfully requested
an extra day to turn in

935
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:15,470
her signed permission slip,
which I granted.

936
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:17,880
Really?

937
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,470
Making it a settled...

938
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:21,300
BOTH: ...issue.

939
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:24,260
Good evening, Secretary McCord.

940
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,430
Do you need a chaperone?

941
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:26,550
No, thank you.

942
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,430
If you need any help
getting in somewhere...

943
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:31,180
No, we're fine.

944
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,611
It was nice to see you.

945
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,510
DALTON: <i>Jibral Disah</i>

946
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:44,640
will no longer be able to
attack the United States.

947
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:47,180
The swift justice Hizb
Al-Shahid's leader met

948
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:49,880
sends a clear message to
what's left of his terrorist

949
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:52,970
organization and anyone else
who would seek to do us harm.

950
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:57,340
Wherever you're hiding,
we will find you.

951
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:58,680
Minister Avdonin.

952
00:39:58,681 --> 00:39:59,840
Thanks for coming out.

953
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:03,111
How could I say no to toasting success?

954
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:08,140
Listen, I know things
got heated in my office,

955
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:11,640
but it's the end result that matters.

956
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:14,800
GRU's Intel was vital to

957
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:17,300
finding the last of the bombs.

958
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:18,930
Can I get you anything,
Madam Secretary?

959
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:21,380
Single malt, neat. Thanks.

960
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,760
I have two boys and a little girl.

961
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:26,970
I'll sleep better because
of all of our efforts.

962
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:31,800
Boy, can I ever appreciate that.

963
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:32,656
Cheers.

964
00:40:32,657 --> 00:40:33,611
<i>Na Zdorovie.</i>

965
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:40,880
And I appreciate the
renewed good will between us,

966
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:43,531
especially given I'm about
to ask you for a favor.

967
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:50,590
There's a young, Russian
woman in prison, in Moscow,

968
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:53,140
on a hooliganism charge.

969
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,470
I'd like to see her released.

970
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:56,590
Talia Petrova.

971
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:00,010
What does the United States have
to gain by freeing this girl?

972
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:02,720
It's a matter of...

973
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:04,300
personal significance.

974
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:09,090
Maybe now you will consider
a trade for Peter Buckley.

975
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,090
(laughs)

976
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:12,930
Okay.

977
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:18,090
You're a good soldier
for your president...

978
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:20,260
but Talia Petrova is an innocent girl

979
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,380
and Peter Buckley is a high value spy.

980
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,531
Come on, Konstantin.

981
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:27,590
Then perhaps we can sweeten the deal

982
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:30,590
with the release of an American spy.

983
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:33,691
Are you interested in Talia's brother?

984
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:38,300
Dmitri Petrov?

985
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,550
Mm-hmm.

986
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:40,970
He's dead.

987
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:43,651
What if he isn't?

988
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:53,641
