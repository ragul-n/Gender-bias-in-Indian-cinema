VENKATAPURAM

2
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,649
The field will be lush green as
long as there are crops in them.

3
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,967
But the same field looks like
a barren land after the harvest.

4
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,260
It is the same with
the village as well.

5
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,288
The harvest here is the cyclone.

6
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:01,765
And the village which turned
into a barren land is Bheemli.

7
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:14,748
What, dude?

8
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,246
We have to do something.
This ain't giving any kick.

9
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:28,669
Hey!

10
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,250
Look over there.

11
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,906
The case is arriving.

12
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,262
Awsome figure, dude!

13
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:37,877
Come on!

14
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:40,924
Let's go, guys!

15
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,175
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

16
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,853
[overlap of voices]

17
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:02,115
Hey!
Bash them!

18
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,226
Just come...

19
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:04,562
Punch him... Punch him...

20
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:05,887
Come on, punch him.

21
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,588
There won't be any humanity at the
places where there are no humans.

22
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:12,218
Bheemli, which is being
ruled by the demons

23
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,443
will never become a habitat for humans.

24
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:18,904
This has become a haven
for atrocities and crimes.

25
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,405
This activity continues until the
light spreads by implaing darkness.

26
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:56,642
Oh man! He is here!

27
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:00,469
Hey Anand!

28
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:02,569
What happened to him that
he is going away like that?

29
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,170
Who do you want?

30
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:21,241
Mastan Bhai has sent us.

31
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:23,987
Okay, come in.

32
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:27,531
[metallic clatter]

33
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,057
Uhuh.

34
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,557
This one?

35
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,558
This one?

36
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:35,301
This one?
This one?

37
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,316
Uhuh.

38
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:39,081
What about this?

39
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,449
Yes.

40
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:45,217
What is the price?

41
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,291
2000 rupees.

42
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:51,105
Wait.

43
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:53,910
Remember one thing very well.

44
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:57,660
It is up to you whether you'd
chop animals or humans with this.

45
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:00,312
But if you are caught
by the police with this,

46
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:02,742
don't tell my name.

47
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:05,434
Leave.

48
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:04,011

VENKATAPURAM
POLICE STATION-VIZAG

54
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:39,552
-Sir, is this Venkatapuram police station?
-Yes, this is Venkatapuram police station.

55
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,955
Who is on the line?

56
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,510
Sir, my name is Murthy.

57
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:44,299
Another murder took
place at Bheemli beach.

58
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,080
Is it?

59
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:46,579
Yes, sir.

60
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,305
Alright, we are coming. Hang up.

61
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:53,000
Move aside... Move aside... Move aside...

62
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,148
[indistinct chatter]

63
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,423
George, what happened to him
that he is coming here running?

64
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,006
-Buddy...
-What happened?

65
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,962
-Don't you still know the matter?
-Which matter?

66
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:07,420
About the murder that
took place at Bheemli.

67
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,135
A murder that took place at Bheemli?

68
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,516
-Come, let's go and check.
-Let's go.

69
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,506
-Who might have committed this murder?
-How would I know?

70
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:21,025
Whoever did this,
they've done a nasty thing.

71
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:22,770
Well...

72
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:23,777
If they are holding a grudge on someone,

73
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:26,544
they should be either dumped in the ocean
or buried in the soil after killing them.

74
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:28,270
But who the hell is he,
that he had killed and dumped in a sack?

75
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,499
The police will nab him within one
hour after identifying the dead body.

76
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,757
The police are arriving.

77
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:40,835
Hey... If the SI sees us here, he might
think that we have committed this murder.

78
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:42,275
Hey, let's go.

79
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,566
[phone ringing]

80
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,207
Good morning, sir.

81
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:54,926
Very good morning, Durga Prasad.

82
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:55,796
Where are you?

83
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:59,555
Sir, I got a call regarding another
murder taking place at Bheemli beach.

84
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,527
So I went there.

85
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:04,390
Well... Last night, I've sent you a photo
of a girl and asked to search for her.

86
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:05,903
Sir, we couldn't find her.

87
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:07,986
We have searched the entire city, sir.

88
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:12,597
Okay. Finish your work quickly and
be on the task that I gave you.

89
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,809
That's very important.

90
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:15,362
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

91
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,843
Out of the way... Out of the way...

92
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:27,698
Open it.

93
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:28,598
-Okay, sir.
-Out of the way...

94
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:35,959
Sir, this seems like a woman's dead body.

95
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:39,378
Sir, seems like the girl we are
searching and this girl are the same.

96
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,160
Hey, out of the way... Move aside.

97
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,581
Listen... Out of the way...

98
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:50,581
[phone ringing]

99
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:52,867
Hello.

100
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:56,291
Sir, I am Venkatapuram's SI,
Durga Prasad speaking.

101
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:57,214
Yes, tell me.

102
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,638
The commissioner has filed
a complaint in your station

103
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,926
about your missing daughter last night.

104
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:03,110
Yes, sir.

105
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,935
Did you get any information
about your daughter?

106
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,842
Not yet, sir.

107
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:09,738
Since yesterday, we've been searching
her without having food or sleeping.

108
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,497
Listen to me carefully.

109
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,471
We found a woman's dead
body at Bheemli beach.

110
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:17,630
It is not in a state of identifying.

111
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:23,469
Looking at that dead body, I somehow
suspect that she is your daughter.

112
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,976
Is it? I'll come right away.

113
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:27,618
We are sending the
dead body to autopsy now.

114
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,959
-Which hospital?
-Rajive Gandhi general hospital.

115
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:30,782
Okay, sir.

116
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,173
-Sir... Sir... Sir...
-Hey, send everyone away.

117
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,741
We found this college bag a little
distance away from the murder spot, sir.

118
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:38,929
Look what's inside.

119
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,649
-Leave... All of you, leave.
-Ornaments,

120
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:41,819
-Just leave.
-Books...

121
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:43,977
Sir, there is an ID card as well.

122
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:50,634
Oh my God!

123
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,263
The girl who commissioner
asked us to search last night

124
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:58,102
and the girl in the identity
card is the same.

125
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:01,996
Keep this.

126
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:06,585
Okay, sir.

127
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,893
No matter who sees this dead body,
the body is in an unrecognizable state.

128
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:11,978
Another thing, sir.

129
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,819
The murderers who killed this
girl has left another clue.

130
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:15,659
What is it?

131
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:16,613
Nurse

132
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:19,773
This sickle.

133
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:22,614
While taking the dead body out
of the sack, we found this in it.

134
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,119
This might be of good
use to nab the murderer.

135
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,819
[sighs] Thank you, doctor.

136
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,041
We found a college bag at the murder spot.

137
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:33,810
In that bag, we found a student
identity card along with the books.

138
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,037
But the main point is that, the
who commissioner asked us to search

139
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:39,101
and the girl in the identity
card is the same.

140
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,044
Hey, give that.

141
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,463
This bag belongs to my daughter indeed.

142
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,088
The dead body is in the mortuary.

143
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,334
Take it without making any delay.

144
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:48,867
Sir,

145
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,040
we found in our enquiry that the
deceased girl has two friends.

146
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:52,865
Where are they?

147
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:54,328
They are in the college, sir.

148
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:55,891
-Okay, sir.
-Sorry, sir.

149
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,747
Dear Chaitra... [weeps]

150
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:00,064
Oh, dear!

151
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:10,815
Sir, she is my classmate.

152
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,742
She became very close to
us in a very short time, sir.

153
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:16,848
Hmm... Well,

154
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,405
when, where and how you have
met the girl for the last time?

155
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:25,262
We met her when we came to
collect the hall ticket at the college.

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,031
She came on some guy's bike,
instead of her moped on that day.

157
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,598
When we asked who he was,
she said he was her boyfriend.

158
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:36,746
Did she tell where he lives?

159
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:37,981
Yes, sir.

160
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:41,109
She said he lives in the
penthouse in her very apartment.

161
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:41,797
Hmm?

162
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,657
[in unison] Hmm.

163
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,611
Hmm.

164
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:49,864
His name is Anand, sir.

165
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,346
He's been living alone in this
penthouse for three years.

166
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,973
I thought he is a good guy as he's
been paying the rent promptly.

167
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:59,088
But I never expected even in my
dream that he'd commit murder.

168
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:02,169
I am still unable to believe
that he has committed a murder.

169
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,623
Do you know where he works?

170
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:09,385
Yes, sir.

171
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:10,074
Where?

172
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:13,300
He works as a pizza delivery
boy at Bhavani Nagar Crossroads.

173
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:19,188
He's been working here along
with us as pizza delivery boy, sir.

174
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:22,224
I don't know the problem. And he's been
not coming to work from two days as well.

175
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,034
When I last saw him at Ambedkar colony,

176
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:26,738
I stopped my bike and tried
to ask about his problem, sir.

177
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:29,549
But after hearing my voice,
he has gone away as if he didn't see me.

178
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,676
I didn't understand why
he has gone like that.

179
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:38,943
Look, if he ever comes
across you anywhere or

180
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:43,228
calls you,
inform me immediately.

181
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,107
Hmm.

182
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,439
Head constable,

183
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:52,755
search the entire auto-rickshaw
stand, bus-stand and railway station.

184
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:54,281
Do complete enquiry.

185
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:57,814
If you suspect anyone,
detain them first. Okay?

186
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,284
[people weeping]

187
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,231
The SI has arrived.

188
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:02,762
I did complete enquiry, sir.

189
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:04,713
The one who killed your
daughter is none other than

190
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:08,427
Anand, the pizza delivery boy who lives
in the penthouse of this very apartment.

191
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,336
I'll leave now, sir.

192
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:20,793
Sir, where shall I place this sickle?

193
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:21,931
Do something.

194
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,726
-Put it in the storeroom.
-Okay, sir.

195
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,224
Three cases have come in the morning, sir.

196
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:28,300
Hmm.

197
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:31,100
In two cases, both the parties
have compromised and left.

198
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,384
And the remaining one
is the third case, sir.

199
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:35,174
The guy pertaining to
that third case is here.

200
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:36,888
What is his name?

201
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,203
His name is Venkat Naidu, a lorry driver.

202
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:40,048
What's the case?

203
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:41,356
Nothing, sir.

204
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:44,096
We caught him while he was trying to
cross the border with the fodder load.

205
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,572
-Didn't he have a permit?
-He did had a permit, sir.

206
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:47,216
Then?

207
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,044
We caught him at the border while loading
cannabis along with the fodder, sir.

208
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:57,805
[sighs] That's fine about him.
What about the guy beside him?

209
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,666
Oh, this guy, sir?

210
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,183
He's been in the same position
since the time he has arrived.

211
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,327
No reaction.

212
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:06,927
Hey, didn't yesterday's
intoxication wear off?

213
00:16:07,262 --> 00:16:08,010
I am talking to you.

214
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:09,350
Speak up.

215
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,491
Why aren't you talking
anything while I am asking you?

216
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,829
[clatters and shatters]

217
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,213
Won't you speak up? Huh?

218
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,297
Speak up.

219
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,572
Hey...

220
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:25,681
If I don't know about who your
details, I'll shoot you right here.

[phone ringing]
[scoffs]

222
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,509
Hello, sir.

223
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:41,576
What's the progress of
the missing girl's case?

224
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:44,273
I have enquired about it, sir.

225
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,480
-Her boyfriend murdered her.-Is it?

226
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:47,678
Yes, sir.

227
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,983
Seems like a love affair case.

228
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,766
We searched for him but
we couldn't find him.

229
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:56,570
But I ensure you sir,
that he'd be crushed if I catch him.

230
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,775
Be on this case very seriously.

231
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,398
-Don't spare him at all.
-Okay, sir.

232
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,593
[sighs]

233
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,586
Is it better to talk to him?

234
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:19,879
Let me try.

235
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:25,255
No... No... He just had got bashed.

236
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,432
Hey, both of you eat
this Upma and be ready.

237
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,016
What should you mean by eating upma?

238
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:34,163
Would you serve us cheap
Upma even if we did a mistake?

239
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,442
I won't eat. Give it to him.

240
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:37,298
Shut up and eat what is given.

241
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,770
Else, I'll get you the other kind
of breakfast through our SI.

242
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:41,854
Don't do that, sir. Don't do that.

243
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,392
We have seen his aggressive
form a while ago. Give it to me.

244
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:44,578
Just eat.

245
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:46,276
Idiot!

246
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,797
Hello.

247
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,052
Thank God! Task finished!

248
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,880
Bro, have Upma. Aren't you hungry?

249
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:04,147
Well, why was the SI so angry at you?

250
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:06,874
Did you commit a murder?

251
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:11,300
Or did your girlfriend cheat and dump you?

252
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,334
Say something, bro.

253
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,908
We'll know what's inside
you only if you speak.

254
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:24,699
Is he a mute by any chance?

255
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:28,358
Are you dumb?
Are you really a mute person?

256
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:30,643
Got a cigarette?

257
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:32,850
Oh! That one!

260
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,127
Where do you live?

261
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:53,603
Why are the police having
so much grudge on you?

262
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:54,890
Consider me as your friend.

263

I'm telling you at the beginning itself.

00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:25,413
I'll stay here only if there is a
possibility to study on the terrace.

Else, I'll stay in the hostel
until I finish my exams.

Alright. Check the terrace
upon reaching our flat.

here, else find a hostel.

every morning to study,

-Yeah.

after seeing him like that.

forgetting whatever I was studying.

about what you are going to do.

Talk to the landlord and make
him vacate the flat.

Else, I would go back to the hostel.

Leave it to me.

won't you?

00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:27,073
Is it? Tell me when you go to the
library next time. I'll also join you.

354
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:27,937
[In unison] Okay.

355
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:28,630
Okay.

356
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:32,681
Rithika.

357
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:37,071
Urgh! She has been annoying
me ever since she came.

358
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:38,980
What is it?

359
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:40,138
Are you going to the restroom?

360
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,059
-Yeah.
-I'll also join you.

361
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:53,519
Let's go.

362
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:56,202
-We should be careful with her.
-Yeah.

363
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:58,081
Else both of us will be in trouble.

364
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:03,018
Rekha.

365
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:06,713
Rekha.

366
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,521
-Oh! I'm sorry...
-It's okay.

-Hey! Look at there.
-Hey!

371
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:07,936
-There's an awesome figure over there.
-Yeah.

372
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:09,407
-Let's go and see.
-Come.

373
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:10,792
Let's go, dude.

374
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:12,160
Hey baby!

375
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,311
Are you alone?

[sniggering]

Hey!

378
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:29,757
Come.

[indistinct voice]

380
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:34,778
Stop.

381
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:37,446
Hello, stop!
Please, stop.

382
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:40,451
-Please, stop...
-He won't...!

383
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:42,674
Nobody will stop.

384
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:03,059
Please, help me...

385
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:05,010
-Get on the bike.
-Thank you.

386

-Hey! She's going.
-[indistinct voice]

387
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:10,433
She left!

388
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:31,544
Actually...
thank you very much...

389
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,628
It's okay.

[music playing]

393
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,784
What is this like a kid,
dear?

394
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,075
Do you know how worried we were?

395
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:47,010
Sorry, dad.

396
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,913
I waited for a long time
at the college for you.

397
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:54,131
When I thought you'd be late and
started walking towards home...

398
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,410
I lost my way and
ended up going somewhere.

399
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,620
I sat at the bus stop in
fear as it was dark.

-[shouts]
-Are you alone?

401
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,584
Huh?

402
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:04,861
-[sniggering]
-Get on the bike.

403
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,529
Who is that guy, dear?
Do you know him?

404
00:29:07,603 --> 00:29:08,636
Yes, dad.

405
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:10,405
I'll introduce him to you now.

406
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:26,420
-Uncle.
-Hmm.

407
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,745
What is it, dear?

408
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:29,535
Why is the penthouse vacant?

409
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:30,742
Yes, dear.
Why?

410
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,941
A guy used to stay in it, right?

411
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,895
That guy vacated, dear.

412
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,793
Why, uncle?

413
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,393
As your studies are getting affected
as he's been staying here,

414
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:40,199
your dad came to me yesterday
in the evening...

415
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:42,493
Hey Landlord! You can
count your money later.

416
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:44,593
I've heard that a bachelor
is staying in the penthouse.

417
00:29:44,654 --> 00:29:45,549
Yes, sir.
What happened?

418
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:47,703
Make him vacate the house
before anything happens.

419
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:48,692
What happened, sir?

420
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,688
My daughter has been going to
terrace every morning to study,

421
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:53,012
but he's been sleeping there drunk.

422
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:55,059
My daughter is having her final exams now.

423
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,311
I'm not concerned of
what you are going to do.

424
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,032
I'll pay the penthouse's
rent if necessary.

425
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,852
If he doesn't vacate by the
time my daughter goes upstairs,

426
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,120
to study tomorrow in the morning,

427
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,498
we will have to vacate the house.

428
00:30:03,574 --> 00:30:04,574
-But sir...
-Mind it!

429
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:05,437
Don't say anything!

430
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:08,935
Since your dad asked so seriously I
couldn't deny it and on the same night...

431
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:11,407
I'm facing trouble with the tenants
staying downstairs because of you.

432
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,162
Here is the rent you gave me this month.

433
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,778
Take it back and kindly vacate the room.

434
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:17,128
Take it, dear.

435
00:30:19,203 --> 00:30:23,439
He didn't oppose me
and vacated immediately.

436
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,493
Shucks!
This is all because of me.

437
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:32,806
Uncle, do you know where he is now?

438
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:37,917
I heard that he is working in a pizza
shop at Bhavani Nagar chowrasta.

439
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:39,960
Bhavani nagar...

440
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,856
Pizza shop...

441
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,335
Okay, thank you, uncle.

442
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:50,880
I slept at my friend's place when
I vacated the room that night.

443
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:53,079
I woke up in the morning and left to work.

444
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,584
She saw me there and brought me home.

445
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:57,408
She introduced me to her parents.

446
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:01,379
Her father appreciated me for
saving her daughter on that night.

447
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:04,125
They asked me to stay in that penthouse.

448
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:06,568
Later her dad...

449
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:09,845
Thank you for saving my daughter on time.

450
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:10,828
It's okay, uncle.

451
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:14,397
If you don't mind,
could you please do me a favour?

452
00:31:15,054 --> 00:31:15,827
Tell me, uncle.

453
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:19,150
Since we are new to the city, we
aren't aware of the routes.

454
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:22,605
My heart has been pounding
thinking of last night.

455
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:24,863
In order to prevent such situations,

456
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,118
my daughter should become
aware of the routes.

457
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,504
Is that it, uncle?
Don't worry, uncle.

458
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:32,978
I'll show the entire
city to your daughter.

459
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:46,318
"Oh, it's magic... Oh, it's magic..."

460
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,732
"It's magic everywhere..."

is so bizarre. Did you notice?"

coming towards the wave?"

"Oh my goodness! What is this magic?"

"No matter how much I
think, I don't understand"

"No matter how much I
think, I don't understand"

472
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:18,442
"As the time is passing,
our bond is getting stronger"

473
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,975
"As the initiatives are growing,
mute smiles are becoming conversations"

474
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,489
"As we keep walking together,
tiredness is getting reduced by half"

475
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:32,026
"As our eye gestures are getting
converged, the eyes are getting bright"

476
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:36,240
"Our hands are holding each other's"

477
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:40,755
"despite it was not our habit"

00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,581
"The thoughts have become pearls"

think, I don't understand"

Why aren't you coming to work from the
past few days? What's the matter?

491
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:11,613
Who's that girl?

492
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,770
A girl?
Whom do you mean?

493

Don't bluff with me.

center, Tenneti park...

Do you think that I haven't seen you guys
roaming around the city on a bike?

00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:26,365
-Oh, do you mean that girl?
-Yeah.

497
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:27,504
Did you understand it now?

498
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,428
-Who is she?
-She is just a friend.

[bell ringing]

500
00:35:31,901 --> 00:35:33,174
Shall we go to the restroom?

[indistinct people chattering]

502
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:04,976
Hello Rithika and Rekha.

503
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:08,714
-Chaitra, is it you?
-What are you doing here?

504
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:11,869
Oh, this one?
We just came upstairs to smoke.

505
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:12,719
-That's all.
-Yeah.

506
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:14,553
Is this what you've been
doing upstairs every day,

507
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:15,693
on the pretext of going to the restroom?

508
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,674
Don't you feel that
you've been doing wrong?

509
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:20,006
It's wrong if we smoke
in a public place but...

510
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,856
who told you that it's a mistake
if we smoke in a private place?

511
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:25,852
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

512
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,919
Anyway, it's wrong to smoke
in the college being girls.

513
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:34,033
Guys smoking is acceptable but not girls?

514
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:35,326
Isn't it wrong?

515
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:35,998
Uh-huh!

516
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:39,609
Chaitra, what are you thinking?

517
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:43,858
Okay, we are going to the restroom.
Would you like to join us?

518
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,608
I won't come.

519
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:47,354
Okay, she doesn't want to come.

520
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:48,918
-Let's go.
-Okay.

[music mutes voice]

522
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:18,765
It's okay, try it.

523
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:37,098
I came here in the
morning to clean the tank.

524
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,937
It was scared to see these.

525
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:41,872
Clean this mess first.

526
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,920
Lock the door to prevent
students from getting in.

527
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:47,201
Damn!
They locked our only spot.

528
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,901
Where shall we go to if we
want to smoke immediately?

529
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:52,423
Tsk! Yeah, Rithika.
Where shall we go?

530
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,745
I knew a place which is on the
way to our home from college.

531
00:37:58,424 --> 00:37:59,998
According to me,
there'd be no one there.

532
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:02,645
We can go there and smoke.
What do you say?

533
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,753
Awesome! Wow!

534
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,737
What an awesome place it is!

535
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,334
Is it nice?

536
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:08,591
Won't there be anyone here?

537
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,804
-People used to be here in the past.
-Hello!

538
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,993
Don't shout.
Anyone would hear us.

539
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:18,640
[phone ringing]
Bro, give us two strong beers.

540
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:20,176
-Hello.
-Where are you?

541
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:21,990
Hey! We are at the wine shop.
What's the matter?

542
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:24,266
Three hot college going
girls came to our spot.

543
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:26,344
Hey! Keep an eye on them We
are starting immediately.

544
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:28,008
-Hey! Hold this.
-What is it?

545
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:28,715
What happened?

546
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,623
-Wow! This place is very nice.
-Is it?

547
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:33,512
Did you like it?

548
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,471
Shiva called me.

549
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,524
-Three girls came to our spot it seems.
-Is it? Then go fast.

550
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,203
Fast!

551
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,073
Hey!

552
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:06,037
Careful!

553
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:10,290
Hey Shiva!

554
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:13,104
-Where are they?
-Where are the girls?

555
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:14,030
There they are.

556
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,265
They were here.

557
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:26,566
Where are the girls?

558
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,140
Dude, they were right here.

559
00:39:29,422 --> 00:39:32,289
-But they aren't here.
-Even I don't understand where they went!

560
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,373
What the hell were you doing?

561
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,312
-That is...
-Shut up!

562
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:38,095
You ruined my mood!
Hey! Give me that beer.

563
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:40,395
Take it.

564
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,780
Mom, where are you going so early?

565
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,419
Uncle has called me to come
to the town immediately.

566
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:50,836
Why?

567
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,956
He has said that he found a
good wedding match for you.

568
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:54,765
Why do you want to get
me married so early?

569
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:56,533
The exams aren't comepleted yet.

570
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:59,145
Your exams will be completed
in another ten days.

571
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,339
Later we should anyway search for a good
alliance and get you married, right?

572
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:05,422
Good alliances don't come
when we search for it.

573
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:06,452
Which is why, we are in hurry.

574
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:09,313
When would you return?

575
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:11,815
We will return in two days.

576
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,928
All the rations that you
need are in the house.

577
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:17,663
Don't roam outside but sit
and study at home, okay?

578
00:40:18,388 --> 00:40:19,218
Okay, mom.

579
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,530
I'm bored of studying.

580
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:26,498
Tsk!

581
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,180
[dialing]

582
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:32,601
Hi, Rekha.
Where are you?

583
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:34,132
What's the matter?

584
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,111
I'm all alone at home.

585
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:37,794
I'm really getting very bored.

586
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:40,688
Shall we go out?

587
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,622
Did you see the weather outside?

588
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,378
It's cool.

589
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:50,481
Do you know how it would be if we go
out on the bike with the boyfriend?

590
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:51,952
How would it be?

591
00:40:52,094 --> 00:40:53,206
Go out and you'd know.

592
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:55,403
Hello...

593
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:03,087
With a boyfriend?

594
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:06,168
Anand?

595
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,672
-Hi
-Hi.

596
00:41:09,575 --> 00:41:12,382
[aeroplane whoosing]
Thank you.

597
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:14,794
Can I ask you something?

598
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,376
Yeah, sure.

599
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,607
You shouldn't reject it later, okay?

600
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,081
Okay.

601
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:25,445
How are you related to me?

602
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:28,893
Friend.

603
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:32,485
-What do you mean?
-I'm just a friend.

604
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,746
-Is it just that?
-Yeah.

605
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:42,911
But would you be as my
boyfriend for today?

606
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:49,576
What do you mean?

607
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,287
I mean...

608
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:59,044
the one who takes his
girlfriend out on the bike to handout.

609
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:02,695
And the one who spends time with
his girlfriend when he feels bored.

610
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,359
And anything like that...

611
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:06,630
Ah...

612
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,454
Anand, please...

613
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:10,920
I request you.

614
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,209
Don't tell me that it's not possible.

615
00:42:13,713 --> 00:42:17,735
Because I'm bored of studying
the repeated subject.

616
00:42:18,032 --> 00:42:21,608
I'm scared that I'd forget in the exam,
if I read too much.

617
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,731
Let's go out for some relaxation.

618
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:29,043
Please, Anand...
I request you.

619
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:30,772
Please...

620
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:33,228
Okay.

621
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:36,280
Great, thank you so much.

622
00:42:54,597 --> 00:42:58,841
"Who is that appearing in
front of me like a dream"

623
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:03,093
"and casting an unknown magic?"

624
00:43:03,193 --> 00:43:07,279
"You have become a reality and
been residing in my heart"

625
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:11,248
"I have walked with you
and you are my world"

626
00:43:11,348 --> 00:43:13,730
"I've never experienced
this happiness before"

627
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,693
"which is being with me every moment"

628
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,557
"Did it come across me unexpectedly?"

629
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:24,228
"Did she step inside my
heart, roamed around and"

630
00:43:24,428 --> 00:43:28,290
"pulled me out?"

631
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,976
"It's flying... It's flying..."

632
00:43:32,398 --> 00:43:36,748
"My heart rose like a wave
and has been flying high"

633
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:40,839
"It's sprinting... It's sprinting..."

634
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:45,045
"It has become her companion
and been sprinting together"

635
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:49,015
"It's flying... It's flying..."

636
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:53,544
"My heart rose like a wave
and has been flying high"

637

"It's sprinting... It's sprinting..."

638
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:02,823
"It has become her companion
and been sprinting together"

639
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:25,879
"Day has been melting like a second"

640
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:31,901
"I don't pay heed to time during
the moments I spend with you"

641
00:44:32,276 --> 00:44:35,183
"In the friendship that
you've been showering on me"

642
00:44:35,388 --> 00:44:40,241
"there's been no question of
burden in the comfort of this magic"

643
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:45,022
"My heart doesn't distinguish
whether it is a sprint or a walk,"

644
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:48,895
"day or night as it's been
drowning in this comfort"

645
00:44:49,162 --> 00:44:52,170
"Have the drizzle and sunlight became one"

646
00:44:52,378 --> 00:44:57,403
"and been showering
seven colours at me?"

the world that you are seeing"

and been sprinting together"

652
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,098
We'll make it, madam.

653
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:33,737
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.

654
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:35,675
[scoffs]

655
00:45:35,806 --> 00:45:36,711
-Hey!
-Yeah.

656
00:45:36,992 --> 00:45:40,754
Recently you said that it's just a
veg pizza but not a non-veg pizza.

657
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:46,098
Then why are you wandering with the
same girl on your bike yesterday?

658
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:47,521
Then what do you call it as?

659
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:48,465
What is it?

660
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:51,193
I am asking the same.

661
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:53,515
Even I am asking the same to you.

662
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:57,113
It's called falling in love without
each other's knowledge.

663
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,395
Is it? Now, who has fallen
in love and who didn't?

664
00:46:00,953 --> 00:46:02,747
I don't know whether you'd
fallen in love or not but...

665
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,903
...that girl has definitely
fallen in love with you.

666
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,938
Wait and watch,
you'll also fall in love with her.

667
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:01,527
Thank you.

668
00:47:03,747 --> 00:47:04,906
Hey!
Did you like the girl?

669
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,254
Is she beautiful?

670
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:07,057
Okay.

671
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:08,396
If you are okay with this match,

672
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:12,433
let's fix the wedding dates once
your daughter finishes her exams.

673
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:13,229
What do you say?

674
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:14,246
Okay.

675
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:16,296
If you say okay,
I'm also okay with this.

676
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,411
Then we shall leave now.

677
00:47:19,505 --> 00:47:20,659
Okay.

Anand, I'm Chaitra speaking.

682
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,421
How come you called me
suddenly that too over a phone?

683
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,951
I called you to discuss
some personal matter.

684
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:50,500
Okay, tell me, what is it?

685
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:52,209
-Not on the call...-Ah...

686
00:47:52,357 --> 00:47:54,637
I'm waiting for you at RK beach.

687
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:56,740
I'm coming right away, bye.

688
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:02,804
Personal matter?

689
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:08,423
"It's flying..."

690
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:13,409
Yes!

691
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:18,076
"It's flying..."

693
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,051
Anand.

694
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:31,757
Chaitra, what happened to you?

695
00:48:32,487 --> 00:48:33,568
Why are you crying?

696
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:39,630
My parents are planning to get me married.

697
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:41,377
Oh!

698
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,234
But I don't want to
get into this marriage.

699
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:48,259
Have you been in
love with someone?

700
00:48:48,923 --> 00:48:50,023
There's nothing as such.

701
00:48:50,893 --> 00:48:51,790
No?

702
00:48:52,802 --> 00:48:55,218
Then why do you say that you don't
want to get into this marriage?

703
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:57,332
Actually...

704
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:01,326
I made a mistake.

705
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:02,779
Mistake?

706
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:05,968
What is it, Chaitra?

707

710
00:49:21,621 --> 00:49:22,359
Hi, Rithika.

711
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:23,764
What are you doing at home?

712
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:24,659
I'm studying.

713
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:27,403
Studying? Won't you come to
college and get the hall ticket?

714
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,868
Oh, no!
I forgot.

715
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:35,019
Mom, I'm going to college
to get my hall ticket.

716
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:37,751
Tsk!
Huh!

717
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:39,574
Anand.

718
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,960
Okay, Anand.
Thank you so much. Bye.

719
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:46,268
-Bye.
-Hey!

720
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:47,218
Who is he?

721
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:48,568
He's my boyfriend.

722
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,021
Boyfriend?
You never mentioned him before?

723
00:49:51,183 --> 00:49:52,012
Where does he stay?

724
00:49:52,347 --> 00:49:53,965
He stays in the penthouse
in our apartment.

725
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:55,937
Hey!
Your boyfriend is handsome.

726
00:49:56,765 --> 00:49:57,923
-What's your name?
-I'm Rekha.

727
00:49:58,011 --> 00:49:58,629
I'm Rithika.

728
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:00,020
I'm Chaitra.

729
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:11,895
I think this is the last time
we are smoking together.

730
00:50:11,993 --> 00:50:13,151
Yeah, maybe.

731
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,456
Let's sit here.

732
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:18,195
So, I have a surprise for you both.

733
00:50:18,777 --> 00:50:19,565
A surprise?

734
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:20,503
What is it?

735
00:50:20,728 --> 00:50:22,055
Guess it.

736
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:23,526
I will guess it.

737
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:25,373
Your marriage alliance is fixed, right?

738
00:50:26,245 --> 00:50:26,915
No.

739
00:50:28,271 --> 00:50:29,730
You got placed in Infosys.

740
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:31,168
Not even that.

741
00:50:31,286 --> 00:50:34,802
What is that surprise if it's
not about the job or the wedding?

742
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,386
Wait, I'll show you.

743
00:50:38,986 --> 00:50:39,931
Ta-da!

744
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,045
Hey!

745
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:42,528
Passport.

746
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:45,907
So,
you are going to the US to pursue your PG?

747
00:50:46,248 --> 00:50:47,335
-Congrats.
-Wow!

748
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:48,784
-Congrats.
-Thank you so much.

749
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,760
But I'm sad about something.

750
00:50:52,372 --> 00:50:53,320
In which matter?

751
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,478
My family doesn't know that I got a visa.

752
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,985
How will you manage?

753
00:50:58,615 --> 00:51:02,172
They won't let me go
if they know about it.

754
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:03,475
-Oh!
-What if

755
00:51:03,552 --> 00:51:06,690
your family fixes your marriage
unaware of this visa matter?

756
00:51:07,212 --> 00:51:10,251
I'll show my visa and tell them
that I am not for marriage yet.

757
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,438
What would you if they
don't accept even after that?

758
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:15,678
What do you do if your wedding doesn't
get fixed with the guy who you love?

759
00:51:15,778 --> 00:51:20,004
I'll call him and say, "Will you take
me away or shall I sneak out on my own?"

760
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,141
Me too.

761
00:51:21,439 --> 00:51:25,165
I'll write a letter and board a flight
overnight, without informing them.

762
00:51:26,745 --> 00:51:27,388
So...

763
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:30,208
Rekha, look there

764
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:31,192
Look...

765
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:34,445
Girls... Catch them.

766
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:36,509
Nicely found them!

767
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,789
-Hey... Hey...
-Hey...

768
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:38,711
Get off...

770
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:42,823
Hey, stop.

771
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:46,149
[screams]
Let go of me.

772
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:47,680
[groans]

773
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:51,231
Stop...

774
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:55,430
Where will you run?

775
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:08,051
Damn!

776
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,718
Come, we are waiting for you.

777
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:26,280
Who are they, mom?

778
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,439
Get ready first.

[phone ringing]

782
00:52:43,136 --> 00:52:44,977
Hello Rithika,
nothing bad happened to you, right?

783
00:52:45,085 --> 00:52:46,991
Nothing happened, we are alright.

784
00:52:47,185 --> 00:52:50,441
Thank God! I felt very tensed about
what might have happened to you.

785
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:51,454
Where are you?

786
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:52,974
We are at RK beach.

787
00:52:53,122 --> 00:52:56,524
If you come here in 10 minutes, we'll
tell you an important matter and leave.

788
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:57,898
Okay. I'll be there.

789
00:53:03,465 --> 00:53:05,760
Rithika, are you sure
that nothing happened to you?

790
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:07,636
Chaitra, don't talk anything now.

791
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:09,016
Take this phone number first.

792
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:10,685
Whose phone is this?

793
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:11,667
First take it.

794
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:14,115
Why are you giving it to me?

795
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,464
Listen.

796
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:19,780
After you have run away from that place,
we too tried our best to escape.

797
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:21,939
Hey, stop!

798
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,137
-Hey, stop!
-[groans]

799
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:27,787
Because of that, they didn't spare us.

800
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:31,225
They have caught us.

801
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:40,865
Let go of me.

802
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:50,220
Despite pleading them after
giving everything we have...

803
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,007
Take it off... Come on.

804
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:58,738
But what they did to us...

805
00:54:04,388 --> 00:54:07,723
Hey, change quickly and bugger off!

806
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:24,052
They have shot the video of their act.

807
00:54:24,174 --> 00:54:26,211
If you don't go to them now,

808
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:31,317
they are threatening that they would
post that video on the internet.

809
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,068
-Hey...
-Hey...

810
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,173
-Stop...
-Stop...

811
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:39,130
It's just two of you, right?
What's with the third bag?

812
00:54:39,303 --> 00:54:41,108
-That belongs to my friend.
-Friend's bag?

813
00:54:41,813 --> 00:54:44,862
Tell that girl who ran away

814
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:47,934
to come to us and collect
her bag if she wants it.

815
00:54:48,573 --> 00:54:50,603
Else, I'll dump her in the ocean.

816
00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:52,254
Got it?

817
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,311
They wrote that number
and gave it to us telling that

818
00:54:54,476 --> 00:54:56,175
you have to call them before you go.

819
00:54:58,446 --> 00:55:00,762
Look Chaitra, this is
no time for you to weep.

820
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:02,636
If you want your bag,

821
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,224
call to that number and

822
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:08,450
get your bag from them without
letting anybody know about it.

823
00:55:08,565 --> 00:55:13,875
But don't you go to the police
station at any cost for that bag.

824
00:55:13,986 --> 00:55:15,120
If you go to the police station,

825
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,066
we'd get into a situation
where we have to commit suicide.

826
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:19,809
We called you to come here to inform this.

827
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:21,365
We'll leave now. Come, let's go.

828
00:55:41,315 --> 00:55:41,832
Hey...

829
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,041
Don't let go. Hold her, Shiva.

830
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:44,856
Shut up!

831
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,111
Keep driving... Keep driving...

832
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:48,867
I already know that she wouldn't
come despite giving the phone number.

833
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:49,938
Nicely found her!

834
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:53,057
Hey! I might have let go of her
friends, but I won't spare her.

835
00:55:53,231 --> 00:55:54,446
See, what I am going to do with her.

836
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:55,901
Keep driving... Keep driving...

837
00:55:56,294 --> 00:55:57,344

-Whoa!

840
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,219
I couldn't think of ways
to get my bag from them.

841
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:13,791
I remembered you suddenly
and called you, Anand...

842
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:16,219
Thinking that you'd help me.

843
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:21,353
Come with me.

844
00:56:22,053 --> 00:56:22,709

845
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:25,288
Where are you taking me?

[phone ringing]

847
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:41,822
Chaitra, their phone is
ringing. Talk to them.

848
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:42,984
What should I talk to them?

849
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:45,348
Tell them you are going to go
to them tomorrow to get your bag.

850
00:56:45,408 --> 00:56:46,753
No... No... I am scared.

851
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,124
What can I talk?

852
00:56:48,202 --> 00:56:49,495
I am with you. Just talk.

853
00:56:49,647 --> 00:56:51,707
Hello... Hello...

854
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,231
-Just talk...-Hello.

855
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:54,818
Give it to me.

856
00:56:56,237 --> 00:56:57,746
-Hello.
-Hello.

857
00:56:57,946 --> 00:56:58,638
Hello...

858
00:56:59,297 --> 00:57:01,469
I called regarding my bag.

859
00:57:02,484 --> 00:57:03,235
You?

860
00:57:03,856 --> 00:57:05,266
You have escaped from us, right?

861
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,831
Since you have called us,
it means that you are really scared.

862
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,422
-Huh?
-Yes, sir.

863
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:15,082
Hey... Put aside these
formal ways of talking.

864
00:57:15,277 --> 00:57:17,293
Tell the time when you'd come here.

865
00:57:17,422 --> 00:57:18,541
Will you come or not?

866
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,971
I'll be there tomorrow
exactly at this time.

867
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:22,820
The time is 5.30 pm now.

868
00:57:23,444 --> 00:57:26,393
You have to be here tomorrow
ten minutes before this same timing.

869
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:32,553
If you don't up, the attack on you that
took place today will happen every day.

870
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:33,613
Got it?

871
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:35,287
Hel... Hello.

872
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:38,814
What happened?

873
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:41,423
He asks me to there tomorrow by 5.30.

874
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:42,946
He was threatening that he won't spare me

875
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:44,289
no matter where I would
be if I don't show up.

876
00:57:45,473 --> 00:57:48,137
Your problem will be
solved by 6.30. Enough?

877
00:57:49,084 --> 00:57:50,407
But how are you going to do all that?

878
00:57:51,002 --> 00:57:52,448
Leave all that to me.

879
00:57:52,785 --> 00:57:56,189
I know very well what to do with them
in order to not meddle with you again.

880
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:57,024
Okay?

881
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:58,235
Let's go.

882

[alarm rings]

883
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,931
Hey...

884
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,031
What happened after that?

885
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,052
I'll narrate the rest of the story.
Come with me. My SI is calling you.

886
00:58:46,537 --> 00:58:48,950
Sir, please give me two minutes.
The story was interesting.

887
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:51,163
Hey, will you get up or
shall I hit you with a baton?

888
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,293
-Just get up... Hey...
-Sir... Sir...

889
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:53,816
Story, interest, my foot!

890

893
00:59:15,362 --> 00:59:17,992
-Sir, he is Venkat Naidu.
-I know.

894
00:59:18,451 --> 00:59:21,764
Sir supplies marujuana in a fodder lorry.

895
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:26,527
Rascal, even after getting caught
supplying marijuana in a fodder lorry,

896
00:59:26,978 --> 00:59:31,890
you dare to do name-calling when
the constable served you upma citing.

897
00:59:32,098 --> 00:59:36,201
Would you be served with a 5-star hotel
food instead of Upma for your work?

898
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:37,478
-You!
-Sir...

899
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:40,692
Bend... Just bend...

900
00:59:40,974 --> 00:59:42,235
-Just bend...
-Ow! Please don't hit me, sir.

901
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:45,262
-Upma... You call it cheap upma!
-Ow! Please don't hit me, sir. I'll die.

902
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:46,949
How dare you do name-calling!

903
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:49,393
-Cheap upma! Cheap upma!
-Please don't hit me, sir. Oh no!

904
00:59:49,483 --> 00:59:50,303
Bloody criminal!

905
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:53,089
-Hey
-Sir.

906
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:55,080
-Take this rascal to the court.
-Okay, sir.

907
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:56,933
-Get up.
-Ow!

908
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:58,740
Move... Just move.

909
01:00:03,507 --> 01:00:04,305
-Sir...
-Yes.

910
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:06,487
What shall we do with the
youngster who got caught at Bheemli?

911
01:00:06,923 --> 01:00:09,416
-Did he open up or not?
-He didn't utter a word till now, sir.

912
01:00:09,594 --> 01:00:11,745
Bend him and bash until he opens up.

913
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:14,689
Sir, he is going to die at the
station if we keep bashing him.

914
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,808
Sir, somehow put him in the
prison and shut his case.

915
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:20,745
Do something.

916
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:23,719
Open a criminal file in the chargesheet

917
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:27,604
and put him in the prison
stating attempt to murder.

918
01:00:27,784 --> 01:00:28,267
Okay, sir.

919
01:00:28,555 --> 01:00:29,921
[typewriter clacking]

920
01:00:30,402 --> 01:00:32,313
After analysing the precedents,

921
01:00:32,842 --> 01:00:37,143
the court sentences the accused with
ordinary imprisonment for 9 months,

922
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:41,893
under the attempt to murder act
for trying to kill the cops.

923
01:00:47,261 --> 01:00:48,637
That girl is not here now, sir.

924
01:00:49,706 --> 01:00:52,133
We have discharged her back 5 months ago

925
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,093
after knowing that she was
not having any mental problem.

926
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:57,737
She is currently working as a
teacher in a government school.

927
01:00:57,915 --> 01:00:59,593
The name of the school is...

928
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,063
Netaji government school.

929
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:02,197
Oh!

930
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:04,269
Thank you very much, madam.

933
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:28,030
"Who am I?"

934
01:01:29,859 --> 01:01:34,378
"What's..."

935
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:39,529
"between us?"

936
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:46,921
"Why is it..."

937
01:01:48,613 --> 01:01:52,140
"unlike the past days?"

938
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:57,376
"What happened..."

939
01:01:59,603 --> 01:02:02,948
"to the present?"

940
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:21,110
"My heart has been
drowned with clouds of rain"

941
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:25,976
"Before I understood what's
happening, it deeply impacted me"

942
01:02:26,073 --> 01:02:30,568
"All my past flew in
the air today, at once"

943
01:02:30,683 --> 01:02:35,465
"Something chided me when I
have been dwelling upon it"

944
01:02:36,354 --> 01:02:39,600
"Is my mere life..."

945
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:45,161
"able to bear this?"

946
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,012
"Doesn't she know..."

Teacher

948
01:02:49,964 --> 01:02:51,315
-"about this pain?"
-Yes.

949
01:02:51,555 --> 01:02:52,742
Someone came to visit you.

950
01:02:53,432 --> 01:02:54,256
Visit me?

951
01:02:54,526 --> 01:02:57,465

-Chaitra...
-Huh!

955
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:29,678
Look Chaitra,

956
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:34,999
we can't live thinking of an untoward
incident that happened in our lives.

957
01:03:36,006 --> 01:03:39,095
Please...
Please get rid of that memory first.

958
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,184
Please...

959
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:44,549
That's not a petty incident
to get rid of it, Anand.

960
01:03:46,716 --> 01:03:50,985
I know. But you can't dwell
upon it, as long you live, Chaitra.

961
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:53,778
It is better to die than
live like that, Chaitra.

962
01:03:55,635 --> 01:03:59,218
Let's go. You've got no one in your
life and it is the same with me as well.

963
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:00,368
Let's die together.

964
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:02,963
That's the only solution to our problem.

965
01:04:05,155 --> 01:04:05,903
Shall we die?

966
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,448
Say something, Chaitra. Please...

967
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:17,536
What shall I speak, Anand?

968
01:04:19,361 --> 01:04:20,505
What do I talk about?

969
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,578
Shall I talk about 6
months of my hospital life?

970
01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:29,768
Shall I talk about 9
months of my loner life?

971
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:35,012
Shall I talk about my
parents who died because of me?

972
01:04:37,065 --> 01:04:37,989
Tell me, Anand.

973
01:04:39,594 --> 01:04:40,407
Come on, tell me.

974
01:04:51,023 --> 01:04:55,511
Answers always keep looking at
those who ask questions, Chaitra.

or answerless question

You are my destination.

I'll become the solution
to your every problem.

979
01:05:08,897 --> 01:05:10,579
From now, your sorrow belongs to me,

980
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:11,893
your anger belongs to me.

981
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:14,436
Your vengeance too belongs to me.

What's the matter?

986
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,217
Sir, I have to file a complaint.

987
01:06:01,461 --> 01:06:02,339
Lost your bike?

988
01:06:02,763 --> 01:06:03,891
No, I lost my sickle.

989
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,033
What? You lost your sickle?

990
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:14,250
When and where did you lose it?

991
01:06:14,658 --> 01:06:16,689
Sir, I lost it 9 months ago.

992
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:21,362
You woke up now and came here for your
sickle that was lost 9 months ago...

993
01:06:21,462 --> 01:06:24,206
"Sir, I need to file a
complaint. I lost my sickle."

994
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,839
Hey, does police station
seem funny to you?

995
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,684
No, sir. I really lost my sickle.

996
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:35,508
Okay. Here are pen and paper.

997
01:06:36,043 --> 01:06:40,236
Write down when and where it was
lost and who you are suspecting?

998
01:06:40,428 --> 01:06:41,238
Write down everything.

Hey... You wrote so soon.

1002
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:55,500
What? The sickle is in this station?

1003
01:06:56,863 --> 01:06:59,110
The complaint is to be filed
against the police station?

1004
01:06:59,396 --> 01:07:01,661
Hey, which sickle were you talking about?

1005
01:07:03,496 --> 01:07:06,532
I was talking about the sickle that was
found nine months ago at Bheemli beach,

in the sack that contained
the dead body of a woman.

01:14:02,183 --> 01:14:06,671
A constable who was on duty was killed
very brutally in the attack.

1059
01:14:06,926 --> 01:14:07,939
Apart from that...

1060
01:14:07,968 --> 01:14:12,238
Venkatapuram SI Durga Prasad was attacked
on the same night in his own flat.

1061
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:17,344
SI Durga Prasad along with his driver and
head constable were killed in the attack.

1062
01:14:17,637 --> 01:14:21,498
The Commissioner of Police says
it's the same culprit behind both attacks.

1063
01:14:22,076 --> 01:14:23,774
A Red-alert has been announced
throughout the city.

1064
01:14:23,974 --> 01:14:29,898
A special team is in search of the culprit
to trace him out and discover his motive.

1065
01:14:47,212 --> 01:14:48,173
Sir!

1066
01:14:48,373 --> 01:14:49,589
We don't know who he is.

1067
01:14:49,904 --> 01:14:53,993
No one is able to crack why he has
targeted and killed only the cops.

1068
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:58,835
Deal with this case and the investigation
procedure is completely upto you.

1069
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:03,880
But I want this case file to be closed
as soon as possible however you do it.

1070
01:15:05,254 --> 01:15:06,391
No doubt, sir.

1071
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:08,741
You can leave this case to me now.

1072
01:15:09,817 --> 01:15:12,675
Whoever he is and wherever he is hiding...

1073
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:14,573
tracing him out is my duty.

1074
01:15:14,899 --> 01:15:15,947
All the best.

1075
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:17,005
Sir.

1076
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:18,817
Drive us to Venkatapuram
Police Station quickly.

1077
01:15:19,017 --> 01:15:22,531
[cop siren wailing]

1078
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:31,528
VENKATAPURAM POLICE STATION - VIZAG

1079
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:33,056
Venkatapuram Police Station.

1080
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:52,561
[shot fired]

1081
01:16:00,199 --> 01:16:03,475
He has walked right into a police station
and bashed and killed policemen.

1082
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:05,878
He is an audacious person.

1083
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:10,843
Looks like he hasn't tasted
the bashing of a cop.

1084
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:12,400
What do you say, sir?

1085
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:18,975
Same as you said, looks like he
hasn't tasted the bashing of a cop.

1086
01:16:20,962 --> 01:16:23,415
A constable has survived alive
in this case as per the record.

1087
01:16:23,615 --> 01:16:25,439
Check which hospital is he admitted to.

1088
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:28,103
It's the King George hospital, sir.

1089
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:29,997
Then drive us there.

1090
01:16:30,197 --> 01:16:31,324
OK, sir.

1091
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:39,036
[indistinct chatter]

1092
01:16:43,054 --> 01:16:44,128
Good morning, sir.

1093
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:46,463
[Ajay sighs heavily]

1094
01:16:49,669 --> 01:16:50,755
My name is Ajay Varma.

1095
01:16:51,512 --> 01:16:53,700
I'm investigating the Venkatapuram
Police Station case.

1096
01:16:54,282 --> 01:16:55,533
-Sir.
-What is your name?

1097
01:16:55,733 --> 01:16:56,796
-Deepak, sir.
-Are you married?

1098
01:16:56,996 --> 01:16:58,025
No sir.

1099
01:16:58,557 --> 01:17:01,367
Since when are you working as a constable
at Venkatapuram Police Station?

1100
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
It has been four years, sir.

1101
01:17:03,307 --> 01:17:04,601
Okay, besides all these...

1102
01:17:07,701 --> 01:17:08,846
How did all of this happen?

1103
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,372
Who is that man?

1104
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:13,488
Why did he target you in specific?

1105
01:17:14,703 --> 01:17:16,609
That's what I still don't understand, sir.

1106
01:17:17,185 --> 01:17:19,243
Rack your brains and tell me.

1107
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:23,287
Err... how much ever I try to remember,
I don't recognize him, sir.

1108
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:25,405
If I did,
I would have revealed his identity first.

1109
01:17:25,605 --> 01:17:29,575
28th, the Thursday, the day of murder.

1110
01:17:30,357 --> 01:17:34,648
Right from SI Durga Prasad starting
from his house till he reached back home,

1111
01:17:34,975 --> 01:17:37,907
give me every detail
without missing anything.

1112
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,972
I'll tell you, sir.

1113
01:17:40,413 --> 01:17:43,814
Like every other day,
we took the vehicle from the station,

1114
01:17:44,374 --> 01:17:47,056
and headed to SI sir's
house to pick him up.

1115
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:54,020
There were almost no cases
from morning till 1pm in the noon.

1116
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:56,263
Sir, your lunch is ready.

1117
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:59,709
Even from noon till 6pm

1118
01:18:00,056 --> 01:18:03,473
there were no significant cases
that needed SI's attention, sir.

1119
01:18:04,589 --> 01:18:07,251
Hey there... start the vehicle,
we have to go on area rounds.

1120
01:18:07,451 --> 01:18:10,104
A few minutes after the SI started
from the Police Station,

1121
01:18:10,525 --> 01:18:13,387
the Head Constable called SI
sir from the Police station.

1122
01:18:14,216 --> 01:18:16,163
But he hung up without speaking a word.

1123
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:18,034
The SI was enraged by that.

1124
01:18:18,438 --> 01:18:20,110
Hey! Why do you call me and fall silent?

1125
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,088
[groans]

1126
01:18:22,288 --> 01:18:23,092
Hello!

1127
01:18:23,718 --> 01:18:24,804
-Ah!
-Oh!

1128
01:18:25,922 --> 01:18:28,126
-Turn back and head to the station.
-OK, sir.

1129
01:18:28,605 --> 01:18:29,765
I'll teach them a lesson.

1130
01:18:29,865 --> 01:18:32,062
So while we were on our way
to the Police Station...

1131
01:18:32,262 --> 01:18:34,972
suddenly the Commissioner called SI sir.

1132
01:18:35,565 --> 01:18:39,267
and we had to go to the Minister's
house instead of the Police Station

1133
01:18:39,685 --> 01:18:42,089
We've been waiting since
half an hour like dogs.

1134
01:18:43,134 --> 01:18:45,440
Wonder what they think about the cops.

1135
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,028
[groaning in irritation]

1136
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,234
Makes me feel we are watchdogs.

1137
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,119
Hey... hey...

1138
01:18:58,198 --> 01:18:59,405
Yeah, sir...

1139
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:03,164
Did you see him? Isn't he the same guy?

1140
01:19:03,512 --> 01:19:04,410
Who is he, sir?

1141
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,568
Well, the same guy man!

1142
01:19:05,768 --> 01:19:09,764
Nine months ago, we arrested a guy
carrying a sickle to kill someone.

1143
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:11,646
-Do you recall that?
-Yes sir! I do.

1144
01:19:12,137 --> 01:19:13,475
-Is it him?
-It's definitely him!

1145
01:19:13,868 --> 01:19:16,294
He gaze had a message for me.

1146
01:19:16,505 --> 01:19:18,018
Err... what kind of a gaze, sir?

1147
01:19:18,339 --> 01:19:22,771
Well, it was angry, like warning me...

1148
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:28,955
His gaze felt like he meant doom to me.

1149
01:19:29,392 --> 01:19:30,898
[stammers] Why do you think he did that?

1150
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,885
Well sir, we bashed him badly that day.

1151
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:35,795
Looks like he didn't forget that yet.

1152
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:37,929
Huh?

1153
01:19:38,129 --> 01:19:39,123
Yeah.

1154
01:19:39,503 --> 01:19:40,644
[sighly deeply]

1155
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,637
[siren wailing]

1156
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:51,776
One should live the life of our SI, dude.

1157
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:53,876
A different girl everyday.

1158
01:19:54,076 --> 01:19:55,737
We don't know what happened upstairs, sir.

1159
01:19:56,184 --> 01:19:58,796
But we were shocked to see the girl
who accompanied our SI upstairs...

1160
01:19:58,984 --> 01:20:01,610
...running towards us in fear.

1161
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:02,945
[lady sobbing]

1162
01:20:04,264 --> 01:20:07,494
-What is it?
-Someone is killing your SI upstairs.

1163
01:20:07,694 --> 01:20:08,865
-Our SI?
-Save him.

1164
01:20:09,414 --> 01:20:10,454
-Let's go!
-Come!

1165
01:20:10,654 --> 01:20:13,967
After the girl told us that,
we ran in the SI's flat, sir.

1166
01:20:14,795 --> 01:20:17,803
But by the time we went there,
the SI was already dead, sir.

1167
01:20:18,528 --> 01:20:19,778
We were shocked at that sight.

1168
01:20:20,346 --> 01:20:22,861
Meanwhile,
someone shot at us from behind, sir.

1169
01:20:23,061 --> 01:20:23,871
[shots fired]

1170
01:20:24,071 --> 01:20:25,979
We collapsed right there.

1171
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:30,422
I woke up after two days and realized
I was still alive, sir.

1172
01:20:40,623 --> 01:20:41,727
-What is it sir?
-Huh?

1173
01:20:41,927 --> 01:20:42,985
Lost in some thought?

1174
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:48,379
Usually, people fear a policeman
or run away seeing one.

1175
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:52,665
But someone has dared enter a police
station and killed every cop there...

1176
01:20:53,751 --> 01:20:55,925
I don't understand what
atrocity he has faced.

1177
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:58,936
If we have to find out the reason,
he should tell us himself.

1178
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,237
How is it possible, sir?

1179
01:21:00,431 --> 01:21:01,438
We don't know his name.

1180
01:21:01,834 --> 01:21:04,444
Don't know his whereabouts.
Don't know how he looks either.

1181
01:21:04,897 --> 01:21:07,419
Atleast we don't even
have his fingerprints.

1182
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:09,023
He'll come himself.

1183
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:10,586
[laughs] How is it possible, sir?

1184
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:16,062
In the attack on Venkatapuram
Police Station on the 18th night,

1185
01:21:16,297 --> 01:21:18,636
a constable was fatally wounded...

1186
01:21:19,343 --> 01:21:22,605
and has been treated in King George
Hospital and is out of danger now.

1187
01:21:23,057 --> 01:21:25,356
ACP Ajay Varma who has been
investigating this case...

1188
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:29,624
said that with the help of the constable,
the culprits would be nabbed soon...

1189
01:21:29,824 --> 01:21:32,150
and would be taken into custody.

1190
01:21:57,749 --> 01:21:58,654
Huh!

1191
01:22:12,023 --> 01:22:13,392
[Nurse groans in shock]

1192
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,370
[groans]

1193
01:22:42,436 --> 01:22:44,762
[panting]

1194
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,081
[sickle clatters]

1195
01:22:57,281 --> 01:23:00,144
[panting heavily]

1196
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:20,454
I don't want to trouble you
with too many questions.

1197
01:23:22,143 --> 01:23:25,590
I'll ask you just one question
and you better answer that right.

1198
01:23:30,562 --> 01:23:32,445
Why did you kill the Venkatapuram cops?

1199
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:39,746
My name is Anand, sir.

1200
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:43,028
I used to work as a pizza delivery
boy in Bhavani Nagar.

1201
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:53,325
[no voice]

1202
01:23:53,525 --> 01:23:54,684
[alarm ringing]

1203
01:23:56,251 --> 01:24:02,199
I went to Bheemili with a sickle in hand
to get back her bag even by killing them.

1204
01:24:04,721 --> 01:24:06,934
What happened after you went
to Bheemili with that sickle?

1205
01:24:08,728 --> 01:24:09,953
I'm asking you...

1206
01:24:10,153 --> 01:24:12,566
What happened after you went
to Bheemili with that sickle?

1207
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,613
I went to Bheemili with the sickle
in hand to bring back her bag,

1208
01:24:24,813 --> 01:24:29,938
...her exam hall ticket and other
belongings even by killing those guys.

1209
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:35,503
I waited for them in a raging
fury to kill them any moment.

1210
01:24:36,198 --> 01:24:38,263
Suddenly, I heard them coming closer.

1211
01:24:40,003 --> 01:24:45,969
Assuming they are close,
I closed my eyes and made a strike.

1212
01:24:47,648 --> 01:24:49,141
[roars]

1213
01:24:50,903 --> 01:24:51,837
And then?

1214
01:24:52,037 --> 01:24:57,009
Assuming that I had beheaded atleast one
of them with my strike, I opened my eyes.

1215
01:24:58,387 --> 01:24:59,423
That's it.

1216
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,692
Suddenly fear gripped me.

1217
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:05,103
I was so scared that I wanted
to escape from there immediately.

1218
01:25:05,459 --> 01:25:07,031
But you went there to kill them.

1219
01:25:07,558 --> 01:25:08,488
Why were you scared then?

1220
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:10,370
It wasn't those guys who came then.

1221
01:25:13,654 --> 01:25:16,086
Not them? Who was it then?

1222
01:25:34,242 --> 01:25:35,576
[roars]

1223
01:25:36,522 --> 01:25:37,779
[SI groans in shock]

1224
01:25:45,268 --> 01:25:47,114
Nab him and drag him to the station!

1225
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:50,701
Drag him now!

1226
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:58,123

[groaning]

1229
01:26:08,606 --> 01:26:09,493
Hey you!

1230
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:13,867
If we weren't attentive for a moment,
we would have been dead for no reason!

1231
01:26:14,904 --> 01:26:16,738
What were you doing there
with the sickle in hand?

1232
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:17,870
Huh?

1233
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,611
What work do you have there?

1234
01:26:19,811 --> 01:26:21,310
Hey! I'm asking you!

1235
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,130
What were you doing in Bheemili
with the sickle in hand?

1236
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:27,060
Whom were you planing to kill? Tell me!

1237
01:26:27,491 --> 01:26:28,716
Tell me you!

1238
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:30,806
Tell me. Come on. Tell me!

1239
01:26:31,743 --> 01:26:33,027
Tell me what were you doing there?

1240
01:26:33,343 --> 01:26:35,275
-Sir... sir... leave him.
-Tell me!

1241
01:26:35,475 --> 01:26:36,758
He is dead drunk.

1242
01:26:36,914 --> 01:26:39,051
He can't speak a word
how much ever you hit him.

1243
01:26:39,251 --> 01:26:41,354
-Hey you...
-Leave him for now, sir.

1244
01:26:42,172 --> 01:26:42,900

[Anand groaning]

1246
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:52,792
Guys... hang him to the roof.

1247
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:54,043
You!

1248
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,424
Head constable...

1249
01:26:56,624 --> 01:27:00,217
Hang him this way till
his energy drains out.

1250
01:27:01,121 --> 01:27:02,585
-Hey, start the vehicle.
-OK, sir.

1251
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:08,173
The way this guy was at that place
with the sickle in hand...

1252
01:27:08,702 --> 01:27:11,887
I doubt he had plans to kill someone.

1253
01:27:12,087 --> 01:27:13,464
-I feel the same way too, sir.
-Eh?

1254
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:15,280
Come along.

1255
01:27:16,434 --> 01:27:17,363
Huh!

1256
01:27:18,725 --> 01:27:19,637
Who is she now?

1257
01:27:19,737 --> 01:27:21,552
She's retarded.
She ran away from the asylum.

1258
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:22,391
Hey!

1259
01:27:22,591 --> 01:27:23,484
Why did you get her here?

1260
01:27:23,684 --> 01:27:26,447
She was creating a mess for new clothing
at a cloth store at Jagadamba Centre...

1261
01:27:26,627 --> 01:27:27,937
I've got her on their complaint, sir.

1262
01:27:28,304 --> 01:27:30,268
Alright, call the rehab
and ask them to get her.

1263
01:27:30,468 --> 01:27:31,886
-OK, sir. As you say.
-Get going!

1264
01:27:32,529 --> 01:27:34,234

-OK, please get in.

1267
01:27:44,029 --> 01:27:45,967
Hey, where is the girl?

1268
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:48,700
You said she'd be here by 4:30.
But it's almost 5!

1269
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,872
Where is the girl?

1270
01:27:50,072 --> 01:27:52,287
How would I know man!
She called, so she'd come!

1271
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:53,732
-Hey...
-[both] Sir!

1272
01:27:53,932 --> 01:27:56,070
-Search the entire beach.
-OK, sir.

1273
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:58,375
Get anyone you find there.

1274

[cop] Hey! Who is there?
What work do you have here?

1280
01:28:34,793 --> 01:28:35,689
It's the cops!

1281
01:28:35,889 --> 01:28:37,263
-Stop there!
-Run!

1282
01:28:39,158 --> 01:28:40,845
Stop you idiot!

1283
01:28:41,771 --> 01:28:43,667

Please!

1287
01:28:50,415 --> 01:28:53,125
Sir, three guys got this girl here.

1288
01:28:53,225 --> 01:28:55,389
We tried to catch them but they ran
away leaving the girl behind.

1289
01:28:55,589 --> 01:28:57,194
What are you waiting for? Get her in.

1290
01:28:57,973 --> 01:29:00,284
Sir... you got it wrong.

1291
01:29:00,486 --> 01:29:02,049
I'm not that kind of girl, sir.

1292
01:29:02,249 --> 01:29:05,394
-Please sir, I'm not that kind of--
-I'll slap you now!

1293
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:09,945
You are caught in the act with three
guys and are trying to act innocent?

bag under any circumstances'

be forced to commit suicide.'

1296

Oh, it's the Commissioner.

1331
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:41,176
Good evening, sir.

1332
01:31:41,348 --> 01:31:42,222
Yeah, good evening.

1333
01:31:42,637 --> 01:31:44,462
Durga Prasad, listen to me carefully.

1334
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:45,834
This is my personal case.

1335
01:31:46,272 --> 01:31:47,143
Tell me, sir.

1336
01:31:47,343 --> 01:31:51,346
Venkat Naidu, my school mate shifted
to Vizag recently with his family.

1337
01:31:51,678 --> 01:31:53,458
His daughter started
from home in the morning...

1338
01:31:53,974 --> 01:31:55,248
but she hasn't returned.

1339
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:57,017
Her family is bothered.

1340
01:31:57,505 --> 01:32:00,840
I'm sending her picture,
phone number and address by fax.

1341
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:06,165
Go immediately and search
for the girl all over the city.

1342
01:32:06,633 --> 01:32:08,210
-OK?
-OK, sir.

1343
01:32:10,354 --> 01:32:13,673
[fax machine beeps] When the Commissioner
sent the piture of the girl by fax...

1344
01:32:14,827 --> 01:32:16,592
he was shocked to see the picture...

1345
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:23,754
and realized that the girl was not
a prostiture but was a student.

1346
01:32:25,162 --> 01:32:26,310
My mind is going blank!

1347
01:32:27,189 --> 01:32:28,134
You!

1348
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:30,109
What do we do now?

1349
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,420
I don't have a clue.

1350
01:32:32,935 --> 01:32:36,454
If they come to know that we molested
a girl in the station being cops...

1351
01:32:36,861 --> 01:32:40,587
we wouldn't just lose our jobs
but will also face a death sentence.

1352
01:32:41,844 --> 01:32:43,558
Yes sir. He is right.

1353
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:46,710
Please take care that she doesn't get
out from here under any circumstances.

1354
01:32:47,381 --> 01:32:49,305
That's OK, but what to do now?

1355
01:32:49,671 --> 01:32:50,905
Let's kill the girl, sir.

1356
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:54,077
Kill her?

1357
01:32:55,428 --> 01:32:57,132
-But how?
-I have a plan, sir.

1358
01:32:57,332 --> 01:32:58,375
-A plan?
-Yes, sir.

1359
01:32:58,575 --> 01:32:59,795
Come on tell me the plan now!

1360
01:33:00,013 --> 01:33:01,152
Well sir, my idea is...

1361
01:33:01,352 --> 01:33:04,599
We don't know whom he wanted to kill
in Bheemli with that sickle.

1362
01:33:04,813 --> 01:33:07,750
We shall kill the girl
with the same sickle here...

1363
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:12,262
pack her body in a sack and throw it in
Bheemili again without anyone noticing it.

1364
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:14,525
[stammers] and what next?

1365
01:33:15,151 --> 01:33:18,214
What else sir? There are many love
cases that end this way nowadays.

1366
01:33:18,528 --> 01:33:21,053
This case too would fall in that account,
sir. That's all.

1367
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:24,919
-Sir.
-Yes, sir. Take a decision please.

1368
01:33:26,705 --> 01:33:27,862
Make it fast, sir.

1369
01:33:28,471 --> 01:33:30,571
Okay, the plan looks good.

1370
01:33:31,136 --> 01:33:32,373
Let's do that.

1371
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:35,505
Go and get the sack, now!

1372
01:33:39,788 --> 01:33:41,419
Sir, the sack and sickle are ready.

1373
01:33:42,096 --> 01:33:43,005
Give that to me.

1374
01:33:47,157 --> 01:33:48,417
GO check on her once.

1375
01:33:48,924 --> 01:33:49,922
Okay, sir.

1376
01:33:52,959 --> 01:33:53,780
Huh!

1377
01:33:56,151 --> 01:33:57,276
Sir! Sir!

1378
01:33:57,655 --> 01:33:58,772
The girl is missing, sir!

1379
01:33:59,136 --> 01:34:00,936
She isn't in there?

1380
01:34:06,419 --> 01:34:08,094
There the hell did she disappear?

1381
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:09,699
Huh?

1382
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:11,294
[groaning]

1383
01:34:12,632 --> 01:34:14,144
Did she escape from here?

1384
01:34:15,422 --> 01:34:16,547
Listen!

1385
01:34:16,747 --> 01:34:20,687
Hunt her down
wherever she is and hack her!

1386
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:21,878
Get going!

1387
01:34:24,357 --> 01:34:26,980
Sir... we got a call
that our patient is here.

1388
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:28,999
-Where is she?
-She is in there, got get her!

1389
01:34:29,547 --> 01:34:30,527
Damn!

1390
01:34:39,052 --> 01:34:40,305
Come on start the engine!

1391
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:41,883
Make it fast. Go.

1392
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:43,099
Start now!

1393
01:34:43,299 --> 01:34:47,013
[siren wailing]

1394
01:34:53,446 --> 01:34:54,635
Where the hell did she go?

1395
01:34:55,179 --> 01:34:56,184
There is she, sir.

1396
01:35:15,138 --> 01:35:15,828
[girl screams]

1397
01:35:19,123 --> 01:35:21,380
Get her in, throw it inside.

1398
01:35:22,566 --> 01:35:23,535
Get going now.

1399
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:27,127
They didn't just book an attempt to murder
case on me who was innocent...

1400
01:35:27,698 --> 01:35:30,207
but also tried to kill
that girl with my sickle.

1401
01:35:30,486 --> 01:35:32,667
I met that girl after nine months.

1402
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:36,786
I couldn't bear to see her pain of losing
her family and the burden of what happened

1403
01:35:37,268 --> 01:35:40,672
and decided to kill the Venkatapuram
cops who were responsible for this.

1404
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:44,037
That's all. I went to Venkatapuram
Police Station that night.

1405
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:45,891
I saw the SI outside the Police Station.

1406
01:35:46,342 --> 01:35:50,810
I waited till he left the station
as he might recognize me.

1407
01:35:51,115 --> 01:35:55,643
Once he left, I walked into the station
and killed all the constables inside.

1408
01:35:55,943 --> 01:35:57,349
After I killed all of them...

1409
01:35:57,549 --> 01:36:01,656
I picked up my sickle from the store
room and went to the SI's house.

1410
01:36:02,349 --> 01:36:04,056
I waited till he arrived.

1411
01:36:04,644 --> 01:36:09,763
Once he arrived, I killed him
and both the constables right there.

1412
01:36:10,733 --> 01:36:13,516
But I never imagined that one
of them would be alive, sir.

1413
01:36:14,029 --> 01:36:17,068
This is the reason I killed
the Venkatapuram cops, sir.

1414
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,213
[Ajay] Investigation is done, sir.

1415
01:36:24,413 --> 01:36:25,348
Oh very good!

1416
01:36:25,548 --> 01:36:26,808
The killer is in my custody now.

1417
01:36:27,345 --> 01:36:29,078
-But I have a small request.
-Tell me.

1418
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:30,781
Don't leave such criminals easily, sir.

1419
01:36:32,143 --> 01:36:35,188
If we file an FIR, open a chargesheet
and send them to court...

1420
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:38,623
the court would sentence them to a maximum
six or seven years of imprisonment, sir.

1421
01:36:39,108 --> 01:36:40,839
And they would be back
to commit similar murders.

1422
01:36:42,056 --> 01:36:43,747
-Hence I've decided on something.
-What is it?

1423
01:36:44,326 --> 01:36:46,771
No court, no FIR, no chargesheet.

1424
01:36:47,162 --> 01:36:48,747
Only encounter is the best
medicine for this.

1425
01:36:50,586 --> 01:36:53,015
What about the case file if we do that?

1426
01:36:54,425 --> 01:36:56,683
There are thousands of similar
cases that fall pending like this.

1427
01:36:57,165 --> 01:36:58,993
This would be one among them. Simple.

1428
01:37:00,331 --> 01:37:01,180
[sighs]

1429
01:37:01,588 --> 01:37:02,830
OK. Go ahead.

1430
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:20,627
[heart pounding]

1431
01:37:23,323 --> 01:37:26,800
"Even when time abandons me..."

1432
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:30,725
"and the world doesn't care"

1433
01:37:30,967 --> 01:37:34,732
"My life looks at you..."

1434
01:37:34,993 --> 01:37:40,135
"and comes for you, come"

1435
01:37:40,945 --> 01:37:44,196
"Come along with me"

1436
01:37:45,058 --> 01:37:48,306
"My heart is your red carpet"

1437
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:52,381
"Reach me"

1438
01:37:52,902 --> 01:37:55,045
"Reach me"

1439
01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:58,052
"Even if the sky hides you"

1440
01:37:58,437 --> 01:38:02,226
"Even if you farther
than the Moon and Sun"

1441
01:38:02,426 --> 01:38:06,207
"I would reach you soon"

1442
01:38:06,407 --> 01:38:10,015
"and put a smile on your face"

1443
01:38:10,374 --> 01:38:14,637
"You are my partner in all my lives"

1444
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:19,171
"I'll make this truth
ring in all directions"

1445
01:38:44,313 --> 01:38:49,290
KING GEORGE HOSPITAL
VISAKHAPATNAM

1446
01:38:52,361 --> 01:38:53,301
[Ajay sighs]

1447
01:38:54,155 --> 01:38:57,971
The constable you want to kill
is still lying in this hospital.

1448
01:38:59,963 --> 01:39:01,743
I think he would be discharged in an hour.

1449
01:39:04,426 --> 01:39:05,714
Room number 103.

1450
01:39:06,787 --> 01:39:09,961
If you have any unfishined business,
take care of it.

1451
01:39:14,602 --> 01:39:15,583
Go.

1452
01:39:25,816 --> 01:39:29,098
Why sir? I thought you'd kill him.
But you left him!

1453
01:39:30,087 --> 01:39:32,012
For the first time,
I felt like giving someone a chance.

1454
01:39:32,212 --> 01:39:33,406
So I left him.

1455
01:39:33,606 --> 01:39:36,876
Then why did you tell the Commissioner
that you would kill him in an encounter?

1456
01:39:37,236 --> 01:39:38,690
I was not referring to him.

1457
01:39:39,603 --> 01:39:40,706
Who else then, sir?

1458
01:39:40,906 --> 01:39:42,038
Drive towards Bheemili.

1459
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:43,577
[Anand breathing sharply]

1460
01:39:47,434 --> 01:39:48,590
[indistinct chatter]

1461
01:39:59,252 --> 01:40:00,254
[screams]

1462
01:40:04,983 --> 01:40:05,664
[shot fired]

1463
01:40:06,329 --> 01:40:07,319
[man groans]

1464
01:40:11,693 --> 01:40:12,783
[man groans]

1465
01:40:12,867 --> 01:40:13,795
[shot fired]

1466
01:40:26,778 --> 01:40:29,862
[breathing sharply]
