1
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,801
Hey, so late in the night...

2
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,935
...if your sister was
standing like this...

3
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,135
...alone on the road, would you
have left her alone too?

4
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,071
Great! There is still humanity
left in Mumbai. Not bad!

5
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:58,737
Hey, what are you looking at?
I am not a sister or something.

6
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,034
Tell me, what will you give?

7
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,669
How many years more will you
ask me the same question?

8
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,168
I did not commit these murders.

9
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,669
Every killer says
the same thing.

10
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,670
But these are your fingerprints
here. These marks of yours...

11
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,835
...are here, here and here also.

12
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,669
If you ask me, I will again
say the same thing that...

13
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,669
...I have not committed
these murders.

14
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,670
These fingerprints are matching
with his. The hair samples are...

15
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,937
What is the reason? Since so
many years I am meeting him...

16
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,770
...but the same question haunts
me again and again that...

17
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,936
...despite all evidences
being against him...

18
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,268
...he blatantly refuses
to accept this.

19
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,102
Dr. Narayan's records
also prove this.

20
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:46,272
Since he died, it's now three
years that I'm on this case.

21
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,603
See, I'm your doctor,
not a police officer.

22
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,869
I have been sent
here to help you.

23
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,201
Why again and again you...

24
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,535
I'm with this case since so
many years but always...

25
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,535
...I found something amiss.

26
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,035
But this reports...

27
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:27,535
I'm sure there is more to this.

28
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:33,539
Yes I've done it, I've done it.
It's me. Kill me, kill me.

29
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,537
like this? In this box? These
are Dr. Narayanan's tapes.

30
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,967
Hello!
- Hello! - Dr. Rao?

31
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,569
I need a meeting just now. With
the prosecutor and the judge.

32
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:05,403
Via the defence lawyer I'd like
to make an emergency plea.

33
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,902
We are committing a big
mistake. We must mete justice.

34
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,401
We cannot give him such
a punishment, I mean...

35
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,733
...death by hanging.

36
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,903
What? What are you
telling, madam?

37
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,401
He's going to be hanged
tomorrow and today you...

38
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:22,736
Do as I tell you. I'm sure he's
guiltless. I have the evidence.

39
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,703
look madam, I am a lawyer,
not god. I'll try.

40
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,568
It was raining like
this that night too.

41
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,568
Please help me, please help.

42
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:16,404
Is there some hospital nearby?
My wife is bleeding profusely.

43
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:17,900
The blood isn't stopping at all.

44
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,400
This? How did this happen?

45
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:27,402
Have you taken the things
to eat and drink?

46
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:33,405
Yes. I have taken all. Why?
Do you want to eat something?

47
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,867
No, not now.

48
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:38,403
Son, do you want something?

49
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,401
What happened?

50
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:47,569
He remains quiet. Why?

51
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:52,571
You are now a stranger; that
is why. When you'll become...

52
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:57,738
...familiar, then he will open
up to you. He's a very shy boy.

53
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,401
It will take some time
to adjust, won't it?

54
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,334
What happened?

55
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,335
What the hell! Seems
like a puncture.

56
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,270
''I love everyone a little...''

57
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:39,270
''May he be fair or dark...''

58
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,270
''I love everyone a little...''

59
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,437
''May he be fair or dark...''

60
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,768
''I love everyone a little...''

61
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,268
''May he be fair or dark...''

62
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,269
''O my lover...''

63
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:03,368
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

64
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,368
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

65
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,368
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

66
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,535
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

67
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:18,203
''I love everyone a little...''

68
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:22,203
''May he be fair or dark...''

69
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,534
''I love everyone a little...''

70
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,702
''May he be fair or dark...''

71
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:30,202
''O my lover...''

72
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:33,202
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

73
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:35,201
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

74
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,201
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

75
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,368
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

76
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,868
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

77
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,302
''I am lightning, that shines.''

78
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:11,301
''I am the cloud that wanders.''

79
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:13,468
''I am a fool, intoxicated.''

80
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,135
''Is this love, or attack...''

81
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,134
''...it is difficult
to live or die.''

82
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,268
''The sights are a sword...''

83
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,468
''...the sighs are burning fire.''

84
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,468
''This thirst is in every cell...''

85
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,635
''...this penitence is special.''

86
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,136
''O my lover...''

87
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,135
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

88
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,135
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

89
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,302
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

90
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:11,068
''The mischief of my lover...''

91
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,235
''...is like the greatness
of god...''

92
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:17,070
''...which spreads from
the sky to the earth.''

93
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:24,068
''The heart is anxious in love...''

94
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,068
''It is ready to even die.''

95
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,068
''It feels that this world...''

96
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,202
''...is a fallacy, a deceit.''

97
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,201
''O come, come, innocent one...''

98
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,368
''...come and clasp these arms.''

99
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,068
''O my lover...''

100
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,068
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

101
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,068
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

102
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,401
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

103
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,071
''I love everyone a little...''

104
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:58,070
''May he be fair or dark...''

105
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,068
''I love everyone a little...''

106
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,001
''May he be fair or dark...''

107
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:06,003
''O my lover...''

108
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,502
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

109
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,334
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

110
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,002
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

111
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,001
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

112
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:30,001
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

113
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,001
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

114
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,168
''My heart's a bee,
my body's a bee.''

115
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,937
listen, how much more
time will it take?

116
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,935
Just about finished.
Two minutes more.

117
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,935
We'll leave as soon as
the tyre is attached.

118
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:28,270
This heavy rain, and this
trouble had also to come now.

119
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,869
Mitali... Mitali...

120
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:26,870
Mitali... Mitali... Mitali...

121
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:31,370
What is this you have done?
What is this you have done?

122
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,369
I will definitely not stay
in a three-star hotel.

123
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,367
But all are staying there only.

124
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,868
Are you my secretary
or their agent?

125
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,868
Why are you speaking
on their behalf?

126
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:49,369
Don't forget who pays you.

127
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,868
You go and tell them...

128
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,870
...that I cannot stay anywhere
under five-star. And if they...

129
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,869
...refuse, then I shall
pack up at 5 everyday.

130
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,802
I will travel in my car to and
fro everyday and they will...

131
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,968
...have to bear all the expenses.

132
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:06,135
You'll come from Panvel?

133
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,802
I think you'll get tired
driving so much.

134
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,804
I am driving you today, but
everyday I can't drive you.

135
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:18,968
Okay, I'll talk
to the producers.

136
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:23,804
Not just talk. Get it done. I
hate unprofessional behaviour.

137
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,801
Do you understand?

138
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:35,803
Hi Bunny! Good that you called.

139
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:39,135
Are you my costume designer
or some tailor?

140
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,303
listen, damn it, I am not
happy with my costumes.

141
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:44,134
I have to look sexy.

142
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,135
Oh shit! Where is my battery?

143
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,304
Avinash! Avinash!
Give me my battery.

144
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:55,802
I have kept it in the vanity
box. Remove it and give me.

145
00:19:55,833 --> 00:20:00,437
Hello, hello... No damn
it, not to you.

146
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:05,804
Yeah! I was talking to Avinash.
My battery is low.

147
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:11,136
Yeah, hello. Did you get it?

148
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,301
The battery is not here.

149
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,135
What? It's not there? How
can it not be there?

150
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,969
look properly. I had kept it
there only. look attentively.

151
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,803
Hello... I am really
fed up of this.

152
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:25,803
I am going to get an important
call. Avinash, make haste.

153
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:33,102
What is this you have done?
Can't you drive attentively?

154
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,133
Where are you going?

155
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,301
To help them.

156
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,968
I tell you to sit as you are.
They must not have seen you...

157
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,135
...in this rain. Why are
unnecessarily inviting trouble?

158
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,302
They can also make
a case on you.

159
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,300
I am sorry. I made a mistake.

160
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,968
What did you do? Do
you drive blindly?

161
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,802
It was raining so heavily
that I could not see.

162
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:58,134
We should do something for her.

163
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,070
What did you do? So much
blood is flowing.

164
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,734
What should I do?
- I'll do something.

165
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:09,071
What should I do? What should
I do? - Give me the phone!

166
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:12,736
No. I have just put a new
battery. I can't give it to you.

167
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,901
It is the matter of someone's
life and death.

168
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:15,233
So what should I do?
- Give me the phone.

169
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,403
Avinash, return my phone.
Avinash...

170
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,736
Oh shit, there's no network.

171
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,902
He has trapped me too with him.

172
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:33,904
O my God, what did you do,
Avinash!!! You wet the phone.

173
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:38,036
Heavy bleeding. let us take
her to the hospital.

174
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:44,739
How do I take her? My
car is punctured.

175
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,235
Come, let us go in my car.

176
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,735
Carefully.

177
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,234
Come on quickly. -
Hey, what are you doing?

178
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,001
She can't come in my car.

179
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:05,336
Oh son, why did you come out?
You should be sitting inside.

180
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,836
You are all drenched. You may
catch a cold. Come inside.

181
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,670
My seat is soiled. How dare
you do this, Avinash?

182
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:21,835
Avinash, I said stop
the car. Avinash...

183
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,000
Sit here.

184
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,667
What's the number of the
hospital? - What did you say?

185
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,000
What's the number
of the hospital?

186
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:33,671
Yes, yes... Hospital...
hospital...

187
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:37,670
Here it is. 7854t19. t19.

188
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,801
This is dead.
- India.

189
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,168
Yes - This is what happens
in Indian rain.

190
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,668
Phone and humans both dead.

191
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,002
How far is the hospital?

192
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,668
At least 10 km. But
I don't even know...

193
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:54,168
...if the routes are open. India.

194
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,667
Yes?

195
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,834
They are Indian roads. less
roads, more potholes.

196
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,001
They are filled with water.

197
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,767
O brother, they are
filled with water.

198
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,767
Give me your phone.

199
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,602
Why should I? You have got us
stranded in such a jungle...

200
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,601
...where I am not getting
any network at all.

201
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:17,603
And this battery was lying here
only. Could you not see?

202
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:19,901
That means I will have to go to
the hospital alone. Come out.

203
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,601
What do you mean telling me to
come out? Look, this is my car...

204
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,933
...and I will not step down.

205
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,603
Avinash, are you listening
or not? These people can...

206
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,602
...help themselves. Avinash,
I am warning you right now.

207
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,100
Avinash!

208
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,734
Avinash, I will not
stay in this hotel.

209
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,602
Quiet! Will you stay in this
hotel or should I throw you out...

210
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:53,601
...along with the luggage?

211
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,268
I will not leave you.
I will see you.

212
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:03,704
Mitali, this is not fair. Say
something, say something.

213
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,701
Say something, Mitali.

214
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,534
Is she alive?

215
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,702
What are you talking? Can't
you see she is bleeding

216
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:11,534
That is why I ask.

217
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,867
Do you have a towel?
- What?

218
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:15,034
Towel! Do you have a towel?

219
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,535
Towel, yes. I'll bring
it just now.

220
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,668
Towel they want. They'll
colour my white towel.

221
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,034
I need a room.

222
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,869
Hey, you are the one, aren't
you, the singer and dancer?

223
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,535
What?
- I mean the music video girl.

224
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,535
I like it a lot. Yours what...

225
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,869
...yes, that 'Pardesia'. I see
it everyday. India.  What?

226
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,536
If you live in India, then
you'll have to watch a lot of TV

227
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,536
like that women do watch
a lot, and we men too.

228
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,868
But you dance very well.
I regularly...

229
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:58,836
Is there a decent room here?
I need to change.

230
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:00,634
r
If I catch a cold
I'll be unable...

231
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,468
...to go to the shooting
tomorrow.

232
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,967
Do you have a room?

233
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:09,471
Yes, I have. Room number 10.
With heater. It's the best room.

234
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:10,634
How much?

235
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,470
leave it. Now what
price do I take from you?

236
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:16,468
I'll take it later.

237
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:19,469
What? - Okay, Rs. 500 for you.

238
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,468
I'll need some photo
identification...

239
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:24,469
...a ration card, passport,
driving license, anything.

240
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:27,469
Not for me, but for
the records register.

241
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,604
Oh God! These formalities.
Where did I keep it?

242
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,467
Is this okay for you?

243
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:43,467
A good photo.

244
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,468
I hope this room is the best.

245
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:48,469
Why will I joke with you?
Those Rs. 500.

246
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,468
Giving. Take this.

247
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:51,634
Thank you.

248
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,469
Take this madam. The keys
to room number 10.

249
00:25:55,533 --> 00:26:00,070
The room is outside on the
left. I mean the room is...

250
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:01,901
Can we got - Yes.

251
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:05,002
I'll take the master
key. Come on.

252
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:06,401
That's better.

253
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,568
I'll take an umbrella
and come on, come on.

254
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,401
She'll go by herself. You
give me a room so that...

255
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:12,401
...I may take my wife there.
I asked you a towel...

256
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:13,733
...and that too you did not give.

257
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,568
Why are you yelling?
I am coming just now.

258
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:17,735
Keep the patient.

259
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,401
Keep the patient!

260
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,401
lift!

261
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,734
lift! If your sister was
getting drenched like this...

262
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,902
...would you have left her toot

263
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,670
See, my car has conked. Can
you give me a lift please?

264
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,335
I am going to the hospital.
Someone is much injured.

265
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,670
Perfect. I'll bring my bag.
Don't go, don't go.

266
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,334
Quick, quick.

267
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,335
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

268
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,335
I'll sit in the car. No problem.

269
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,335
Hi, I am Sonia.

270
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,335
Avinash.

271
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,834
Great.

272
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,335
I am so sorry. Without asking
you, I lit a cigarette.

273
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,934
It's okay.

274
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,435
Okay Actually you don't
look the type.

275
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,934
Yes?

276
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,436
The type who'd object
to women smoking.

277
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,604
It's fine. Be my guest.

278
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,268
For everything?

279
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,768
I'm sorry.

280
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,268
Just joking.

281
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,268
look ahead.

282
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,600
Did you say anything?

283
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,767
What?

284
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,267
I said did you say anything?

285
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,434
No.

286
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,603
Then say something. Maybe you
don't watch Hindi films.

287
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:37,769
The hero and heroine begin
talking this way only.

288
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,268
I am not in the mood to joke.

289
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,601
Anyway, I can't see
the road ahead.

290
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,268
I'm sorry.

291
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:11,203
Oh shit! There's
water everywhere.

292
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:15,368
Now if I say that we cannot
go anywhere from here...

293
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:18,202
...and we will have to spend
the night here only...

294
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:21,202
...then you will paste a
dialogue like a Hindi film hero.

295
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:25,803
I'll have to try. I have to
reach the hospital somehow.

296
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:29,203
What? - It's the question
of someone's life or death.

297
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,368
Avinash, the car
cannot go ahead.

298
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:32,700
I have to.

299
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:36,202
Avinash Can't you see how
much water is filled ahead?

300
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:38,201
What are you doing?

301
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:22,535
What is happening? See you
did not listen to me...

302
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,202
...that is why it conked
off.

303
00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:26,700
I had told you.

304
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,201
Stop, stop.
- Don't stop.

305
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,202
Why? They may be
having a problem.

306
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:43,203
So what is it to you?
Don't stop.

307
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,700
I'll just come.

308
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,368
See, the whole road up ahead
is filled with water.

309
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:57,536
You won't be able to proceed.
My car is stuck too.

310
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,634
But we are going straight ahead.

311
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:07,137
Where will you go? It's
a dead end. Please.

312
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,601
look, please, you
cannot go ahead.

313
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:13,635
See ahead. The road is closed.

314
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:18,135
Okay, then we'll proceed by
another route. Come on...

315
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,468
...Varun, let us return.

316
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:26,471
Perfect! If you are returning,
then we too have to. Why?

317
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:37,371
Please. Otherwise, we'll
be trapped. Please.

318
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,301
Okay. You people sit down.

319
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,467
Thank you, thank you.

320
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,134
No way.

321
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,102
These people
- In room number 6.

322
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,567
And Miss Kashmira?

323
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:15,570
Miss Kashmira? Oh, Pardesia.
In room number 10.

324
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:23,235
Now I can go to the hospital
only after the rain stops.

325
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,067
Did the phone start/

326
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:35,737
Yes. India. In India it takes
time to repair something.

327
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,068
That means, it will take much
longer to repair this because...

328
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,068
...the chances of it becoming
all right are slim.

329
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,502
If it becomes all right,
then that's luck.

330
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,068
Give me too one room.

331
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,367
Give me one ID.

332
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,601
I'll see that woman. You
finish the formalities.

333
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:55,068
Take these keys
and go. Number 5.

334
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:57,400
Go. Bye.

335
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,001
I need a room too.

336
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,267
What is it?

337
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,400
I am giving you a last warning.

338
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,201
If I see you in this
hotel again...

339
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:13,001
...I'll immediately give
you up to the police.

340
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,434
You bloody swine!

341
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:16,601
It is better that you
go away from here.

342
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:21,470
I did not come here with my
will. I came upon being called.

343
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,001
leave my hand.

344
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,336
It costs to touch me.

345
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,333
Rascal!

346
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,333
I need a room too.

347
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,002
Get out, get out. I don't give
rooms to people like you.

348
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,334
What do you mean? What do you take me to be?

349
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,004
What should I understand? It's
written openly on your face.

350
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:53,002
This is not a sleazy hotel, you
understand? There is no room...

351
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,001
...for your types. Go, go.

352
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,002
Shut up! What is your standing?
If I want, I can buy...

353
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,201
...your hotel, did
you understand?

354
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:04,403
Then buy it, buy it. After that
the room will be yours. Go.

355
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:08,267
What the...

356
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,935
Hey, hey, up there
it will break.

357
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,268
If you don't give me a room,
where will I go so late?

358
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,601
Excuse me! We need a room.

359
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,934
There are no double bedrooms,
but there are...

360
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,469
...two single bedrooms. - You'll
definitely have some suite

361
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:24,435
Yes I have, but I had to give
it out. There was a wounded...

362
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:27,102
...woman; I had to give it
to her. - Okay, give it.

363
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,467
But I do not want to stay here.
Our better hotel will...

364
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:30,934
...go out of our hands.

365
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:34,202
But we cannot go there,
can you understand?

366
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:36,935
And let us stay in this hotel
tonight, it is better than...

367
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,936
...staying in the car. Anyway(s),
this place doesn't seem costly.

368
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,135
Is it not so?
- Yes. It is cheap. Rs. 400.

369
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,268
Just like you.

370
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,934
But I don't want to stay here.

371
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,335
You have gone crazy.
You give me the keys.

372
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:52,335
ID.
- You will never listen to you.

373
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,467
When I told you that we would...

374
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,935
...go to the honeymoon by train,
then you had the idea...

375
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:59,068
...to go by car. I told you not
to give them a lift but...

376
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:01,869
...you did so on purpose. Now I
am telling I don't want to stay...

377
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,469
...here, so you are deliberating
putting your foot down?

378
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,268
Mehek. Don't create a scene.
People are watching.

379
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:12,203
Don't say people. Tell frankly,
that she is watching.

380
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:15,035
Will you stop it?
- The keys...

381
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,935
Varun... Varun...

382
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,400
It happens.

383
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:25,868
India. The only country in
which a woman can set fire to...

384
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:29,002
...a man's happy household
without even lifting a finger.

385
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,267
Now go at least.

386
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,872
Hey! I am ready to take the Rs.
400 room in Rs. 500 only.

387
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,868
Then give.
- What?

388
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:42,468
ID. With the real name.

389
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:48,536
After that you'll give
me the room?- Given.

390
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:03,036
Even the sweater is soaked in
blood. The blood isn't stopping.

391
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:10,406
Oh God, help me, help
me. What do I do?

392
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,301
Can I see?

393
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,401
Yes, please see. The blood
isn't stopping at all.

394
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,869
It is a deep wound.
Much blood has flown.

395
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,801
We'll have to stop it.

396
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:25,133
Do something, please.

397
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,334
Do you have a needle and thread?

398
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,970
Needle and thread? But my
stuff is all in the car.

399
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,935
What do I do?
- I'll do something.

400
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:43,403
Mitali... Mitali... Everything
will be all right.

401
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:46,067
I'll come just now.
- See, he's bringing something.

402
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:47,200
Come fast.

403
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,802
Sameera, so late in the night
you have called an...

404
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,201
...emergency meeting. It better
be something concrete.

405
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,068
Otherwise, it's result
will be not good.

406
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:08,737
I know. This is Dr. Saakshi
Sagar, whom you have...

407
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:12,870
...already met in the court when
we had the first hearing.

408
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,736
Well, she has a valid point.
She feels that we need to...

409
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,237
...protect the law. Injustice
is a curse.

410
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,136
Injustice? Today? One night
before the hanging sentence?

411
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,735
Dr. Sagar, if your pleading is
not authentic, then I shall...

412
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,402
...cancel your licence.

413
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:36,735
My protest is absolutely
significant, Mr. Menon, it is...

414
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,902
...absolutely valid.

415
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:43,737
After so many murders, you can
be saved by the witness...

416
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:48,804
...of a doctor. Scary thought!
Anyway, begin.

417
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,935
let us begin after the
honourable judge comes.

418
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:54,134
I heard the criminal is
also being brought here.

419
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:57,335
Yes, the police are bringing
him here. He is needed here...

420
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,268
...to justify my reasoning.

421
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:08,834
Listen.
- Yeah, tell.

422
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:12,836
Her wound is too serious.
Too much blood is flowing.

423
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:14,067
Do you have some needle
and thread?

424
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,800
I'll have to see. I'll see.

425
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,202
Here it is. This.

426
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,001
Do you think a needle and
thread will do the job?

427
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:32,736
After all, it is skin
not cloth. Take it.

428
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,668
India.
- What?

429
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:36,668
This is India. Here with
a needle and thread...

430
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,668
...what to speak of skin, one
can stitch any torn substance.

431
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,067
I am senior inspector Jatin.

432
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,967
You here? Speak.

433
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,800
Is there any of the
motel staff here?

434
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,835
India.
- Yes?

435
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,669
This is India. So
the bell boy,...

436
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,135
. .waiter, staff, all
are one person.

437
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,202
This is me. A small packet
of wet tea powder. Tell me.

438
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:07,602
There is a dangerous murderer
in my car. We were shifting...

439
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:10,602
...him to a different prison,
but got stuck in the rain...

440
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,934
...and our squad van also
got stranded somewhere.

441
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,935
Tonight we will have to
stay in this motel only.

442
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:17,933
Okay.

443
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:25,900
I am bringing the keys.

444
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:33,602
Inspector, do you have a
wireless radio in your car?

445
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:36,602
A woman is seriously wounded.
We could not take her to the...

446
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,101
...hospital. If you have a
radio, then we can get some help

447
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,001
I have it, but it is not
functioning. Would we have...

448
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:45,268
...been going around without
a squad van otherwise?

449
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,768
Can you give me another
cloth or napkin?

450
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,602
Yes. Son, will you bring a
napkin from the bathroom?

451
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,101
Son...

452
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,100
I'll bring it.

453
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,601
Come, come, come, the room's
waiting, be quick.

454
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,102
Come on, come on, bring
the briefcase. Bring.

455
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,067
Come on.

456
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:36,933
Take this.

457
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:43,603
What happened? Is your son all-
right? He's not spoken...

458
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:46,769
...since he has come. It
seems he has got a shock.

459
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:51,769
He's not my son.

460
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:55,935
I have married Mitali
just a few months ago.

461
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,771
Ever since his father passed
away he's stayed like this only.

462
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:06,669
Silent. Doesn't say anything.

463
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:12,535
No, no, I will serve you.
Bring him. To keep him in...

464
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,936
...you'll need some strong
place, won't you? Bathroom.

465
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:18,535
You'll not get stronger
fittings anywhere.

466
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,537
It is a very strong pipe,
absolutely solid. Tie him there.

467
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:26,034
Come on.

468
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,535
It won't break, will it?
- Tie it.

469
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,867
It won't break.

470
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,534
I'll see you.

471
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,068
Now see the bathroom. See
me after coming out.

472
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:09,602
Slowly, slowly.
- My God!

473
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,470
Oh! If the colour of the thread
was that of skin then...

474
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:25,969
...no one would have known
of the stitches.

475
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,800
Meaning?

476
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,003
It's wonderful! Where did
you learn this, boss?

477
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:38,968
For three years I was in
a medical school, but...

478
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:40,801
...could not complete it.

479
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:48,000
Nice stitching.

480
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,467
Thanks!

481
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,001
Did your radio begin working?
- No.

482
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,468
If you say, can I try once?

483
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,670
No, this is not a public phone.
It's a police wireless.

484
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:59,634
Everyone cannot use it.

485
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,401
Did you feel anything?

486
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,001
What? What happened?

487
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:48,900
Nothing.

488
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:53,534
I am feeling something
else. And you?

489
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,401
Me too.

490
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:00,401
But at least give me
time to be fresh.

491
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,670
That's what I am doing. I'm
helping you in becoming fresh.

492
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:14,134
Who is it?

493
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:21,303
Why are you seeing sneakily?
Come out, I'll show you, rascal.

494
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,068
What were you doing, rascal?
What were you doing?

495
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:26,601
No... No...
- Tell me, what were you doing?

496
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:30,069
See, I was inspecting
everyone's rooms so...

497
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:33,236
...I thought I would check in on
yours too to see if it's okay.

498
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,068
Is checking done like this?

499
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,667
India.
- What?

500
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,602
In India, the checking is done
like this. There is no camera...

501
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,335
...in here so I can sit there
and check if you are okay or not.

502
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,068
Shall I tell what
happens to those...

503
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,367
...who check like this in India?

504
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:52,567
No sorry.

505
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,472
Varun, please. let him go. He's
just a bag of bones. He'll die.

506
00:48:58,533 --> 00:48:59,667
Leave him.

507
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:05,402
Varun! - Get out before
I kill you here.

508
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:07,000
Varun, leave him.

509
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:16,169
I'll see who kills whom.

510
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:27,333
Get lost!

511
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:37,536
This night... this weather...
the bank of the river...

512
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,001
...this mischievous breeze.

513
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:43,001
Hey!

514
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,503
Not hey. ID. ID's my name.

515
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,001
Will I get something to eat?

516
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,002
Will this dot lentils. Chicken
leg, liver, heart, egg scramble...

517
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:56,002
...if you want anything like
that, then there's a restaurant...

518
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:59,002
...5 km from here. There
you'll get it. Come on.

519
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:01,468
But it is written on your
board= Bed and Breakfast motel.

520
00:51:02,066 --> 00:51:05,068
Many things are written on your
board too. Did I ask them?

521
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:09,270
You should be capable to
buy things. Not ask them.

522
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,601
leave it. There'll
be a kitchen here?

523
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:16,936
Yes, there is. Kitchen and
dining room also but...

524
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,069
...receptionist, waiter, bell
boy, chef; I am all of those.

525
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:28,140
If there was something possible
by me, I would surely do them.

526
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:32,936
But all these jobs are not in
my capability and what is in...

527
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,570
...my capability is not in yours.

528
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:42,470
Ahead there's a storeroom.
There's a machine in there.

529
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,267
Oh!

530
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,101
There is too much to
drink in the machine.

531
00:51:47,433 --> 00:51:50,102
Put in money and take it.

532
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,934
Thank you.

533
00:51:59,466 --> 00:52:00,867
What has happened to India?

534
00:53:00,966 --> 00:53:03,968
Come out.

535
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:13,801
Can I help you?

536
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:18,801
Since when did the police
begin helping the public?

537
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:28,802
There is too much difference
between public and a woman.

538
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:45,468
Keep it. I am generous rarely.

539
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:59,205
Neither do I take from anyone
in free, nor do I give. Thanks!

540
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:13,806
Wow! I got the network. Oh
shit, it's gone again. Oh God!

541
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,201
It isn't here too.

542
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:21,735
I just had the network. Don't
know where it's gone.

543
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:23,134
Please come on, come on.

544
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:27,735
Oh shit, gone again.

545
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:32,736
Don't know which jungle
this is. This Avinash!

546
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,936
Oh, it's come. Come on, come on.

547
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:43,068
At least I'll call to arrange
for some clothes.

548
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,067
God knows what place this is!

549
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:53,072
Hello... Hello... Get them!

550
00:54:55,866 --> 00:54:57,067
Who is it?

551
00:55:05,066 --> 00:55:06,167
Oh my God!

552
00:55:15,133 --> 00:55:16,667
What happened?

553
00:55:17,066 --> 00:55:19,668
Did you hear that scream?

554
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:27,804
let me see. - No, you don't
go. Just be near me.

555
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:14,605
Kashmira... Kashmira... How did
this happen? Who was he?

556
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:45,603
What are you saying, doctor?
You have been a doctor...

557
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:48,602
...for this convict since five
years. And in the nick of time...

558
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:53,270
...these reports, these meetings
when you know the law.

559
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,602
When a convict is to be hanged,
then a week prior...

560
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:59,602
...his checkups, his blood
pressure reports...

561
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,802
...everything is checked
and after that we...

562
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:06,536
I haven't come here to argue,
Mr. Menon and for your record...

563
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,869
...Dr. Narayan was the doctor
of this convict before me.

564
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:13,535
Only after his death did I
become the psychiatrist...

565
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:16,535
...for the convict. I am a
responsible doctor and...

566
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,203
...it is my duty to put my
doubts in front of you.

567
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:23,535
I want to tell you that despite
being a murderer, he is...

568
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,868
...not a criminal.

569
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:29,536
We have already debated
about this and we have...

570
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,070
...convicted him after we have
gone through all these things.

571
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:35,934
I hope you understand
this, Dr. Sagar.

572
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:39,936
Yes, but you don't seem to
understand, Shekhar sir.

573
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:43,535
This person has only killed
those who were...

574
00:57:43,566 --> 00:57:45,834
...offenders in his eyes.

575
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:49,536
Yes. And I am sure the judge
who has convicted him also...

576
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,537
...knows that. We have also
reiterated that by taking the...

577
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,536
...law in their hands and by
making themselves gods...

578
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,203
...nobody gets a right
to punish others.

579
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:04,469
God, why are you doing this?
Whatever you want to prove...

580
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:07,469
...it better be good. Or for
calling us here in an emergency...

581
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:09,468
...meeting and wasting
our time,...

582
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:12,068
...I can create a legal
hassle for you.

583
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:15,469
I know what I am doing, Mr.
Menon. Relax. I only know...

584
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,768
...that if my theory is correct...

585
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:20,468
...and I am successful
in my debate...

586
00:58:20,533 --> 00:58:24,536
...then me, you, we all will
be in a legal hassle.

587
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:27,668
That is not the thing. It is a
murder that has taken place.

588
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:28,934
Should have been rather careful.

589
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,468
I don't understand anything.

590
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:33,002
We shall all be killed.
let's go from here.

591
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:35,802
He is a strange man. I had told
him first only to get a towel.

592
00:58:35,866 --> 00:58:37,934
What will happen of India?
Of the people who watch TV?

593
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,535
He keeps blabbering. - Did this
have to happen in my motel only?

594
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:42,935
Why don't you listen to me?
Now what will we do?

595
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,068
This in my motel, my motel.
Why in my motel?

596
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:47,001
let's go from here.

597
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:49,868
This in my motel, my motel.
Why in my motel? - Shut up!

598
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:55,801
Will someone tell
what is happening?

599
00:58:56,966 --> 00:59:00,469
As you all know, there has
been a murder here...

600
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,002
He will tell you something
about this.

601
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,835
The murder must have taken
place just now. Then...

602
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,601
...how did the police
come here so quickly?

603
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:12,867
How did he come earlier?

604
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:17,404
I was taking a murderer from
one prison to another. My God!

605
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,868
How is that possible? If
this does not work here...

606
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:30,401
...we can appeal in
the Supreme Court.

607
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,801
I don't think good morning
is appropriate for now.

608
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:44,733
Is the convict comet

609
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,735
Not yet. The police
is bringing him.

610
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,868
What new proof do you have?

611
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:51,402
Rather than the proof,
I have a theory.

612
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,403
What? Do I seem to be mad?
I was told that you have...

613
00:59:56,433 --> 01:00:00,403
...a new proof. But you have
called me at this hour...

614
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:04,870
...to prove a theory? What
nonsense is this?

615
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:07,935
Sir, the proof'll automatically
come in front of you...

616
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,736
...when the doctor will put her
arguments to the convict.

617
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,936
Is this the time for arguments?
You have gone mad.

618
01:00:14,933 --> 01:00:18,403
If we shall put the arguments
now, then what did we...

619
01:00:18,466 --> 01:00:21,402
...do in the court till now?
See, whatever is your theory...

620
01:00:21,466 --> 01:00:24,669
...tell me in 20 minutes, whether
the convict is here or not.

621
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,402
If I see some strength in that,
then I shall think further.

622
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,402
Will someone give me a
cup of coffee, please?

623
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,402
Honourable judge, if
the convict comes,...

624
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,734
...then it'll be easy for me.

625
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:42,737
I had given you 20 minutes,
of which you have wasted...

626
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,903
...two minutes, Dr. Sagar. Now you
have just 18 minutes left.

627
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,402
And your convict? Where
has he reached now?

628
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:15,337
The jungle is not coming to
an end. Can't see the road...

629
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:21,506
...till far. I do not understand
whether to go this way or that.

630
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:28,668
That convict has escaped.
- What?

631
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,334
And he is a dangerous killer.

632
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,668
Wasn't I telling it
will be him only?

633
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,468
You people please, be careful.

634
01:01:38,366 --> 01:01:40,868
SI sir, let us go out and look
for him. He'll not have gone far.

635
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:43,335
His feet are bound.
- Yes. I'll come with you too.

636
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,868
No, please. You remain here and
take care of these people.

637
01:01:48,733 --> 01:01:53,337
His feet are bound?
What does that mean?

638
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,337
His hands are free, aren't
They? This is highly...

639
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,337
...irresponsible behaviour.
I am going into my room.

640
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,437
Mitali is alone. Come,
son, Come.

641
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,268
I had told you, don't stay.
You never listen to me.

642
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,569
Where would we have gone?
All roads were blocked.

643
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:16,268
You are habituated to
be heedless to me and...

644
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,735
...I know why you are staying
here. For her!

645
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:24,267
Please! What madness is this?

646
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:27,602
What do you think? I don't
know what you do outside?

647
01:02:27,866 --> 01:02:30,268
That night, one of my friends
had seen you go to a club...

648
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,268
...with a girl.
- Shut up!

649
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:40,272
Hit me! Hit me! I know
everything. You don't love me.

650
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:45,870
You married me because...
I know everything.

651
01:02:46,866 --> 01:02:50,803
Had it been within you, you
wouldn't have looked at me.

652
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:55,269
I am going.
- Mehek!

653
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:03,368
What are you seeing?
Go after him.

654
01:03:03,466 --> 01:03:05,201
Mehek!

655
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,535
I don't want to be with him.
- I can't believe.

656
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,801
Mehek, listen to me.
Mehek, please.

657
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:12,200
Mehek, listen to me please.

658
01:03:12,266 --> 01:03:14,334
leave me alone.
- listen to me please.

659
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:16,201
All you men are alike.

660
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,500
Mehek, open the door.

661
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:29,735
You! - It will break. It is
made for people like you...

662
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,469
...the master key. Take it.

663
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,601
Mehek, Mehek, listen to me.

664
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:41,802
I don't want to listen to
anything you say.

665
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:43,601
You don't love me.

666
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,201
Mehek...

667
01:03:47,233 --> 01:03:50,402
Mehek... what madness is
this? Open the door.

668
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:51,634
I'll not open the door.

669
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:55,203
Mehek, the doctor has told you
should not take stress...

670
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,534
...in this condition. Mehek,
listen, I love you a lot, Mehek.

671
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,802
No, you don't love me.

672
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:02,134
Mehek, open the door. What
childishness is this?

673
01:04:02,466 --> 01:04:05,468
I'll not open the door.
Whatever you do!

674
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,469
look, this is why
I had married you.

675
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,736
Really? You'll not leave me
in any condition, will you?

676
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:16,135
Mehek, leave this needless
drama. Damn it.

677
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:19,302
You are going to be a mother
and still behaving like a kid!

678
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:22,668
Varun, shall I tell
you something?

679
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:28,303
Yes, tell Mehek. Speak
to me. I am listening.

680
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:32,136
Will you be offended?
- No. Tell me what?

681
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,468
I am not pregnant.

682
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:40,137
What? You lied to me?

683
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,538
I had to coax you into
marriage. That's why I lied.

684
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:48,468
Then those tests?

685
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:54,537
I am not pregnant. I was
scared of losing you.

686
01:04:55,266 --> 01:05:01,338
You lied to me. How
dare you? You bitch...

687
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,402
Open the damn door.

688
01:05:06,466 --> 01:05:08,568
I'd told you, you'll not even
bother about beating me.

689
01:05:09,466 --> 01:05:13,069
Oh, shut up. Open the door
right now. I'll break the door.

690
01:05:13,466 --> 01:05:18,237
How dare you? You lied
to met You lied to met

691
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,068
Open the door right now.

692
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:21,400
Stop it Varun, please, stop it.

693
01:05:21,566 --> 01:05:23,134
God swear, I am not
going to leave you.

694
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:26,069
Open the door.

695
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,567
Stop it.

696
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:45,068
Varun...

697
01:05:47,233 --> 01:05:49,068
Varun...

698
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:55,068
Varun...

699
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,503
Relax. What happened?

700
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,336
What happened?
- I saw a shadow in my room.

701
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,602
Where is your husband?
- He's inside.

702
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:27,401
He wants to kill me. He...

703
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:06,935
Somebody killed Varun.
- No.

704
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:38,468
Calm down, please.

705
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,434
No one can avoid the inevitable.

706
01:07:53,633 --> 01:07:55,601
Oh... where were you?

707
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,467
I was searching for you there...

708
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:03,733
Him too...

709
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:06,401
Where were you?

710
01:08:06,566 --> 01:08:07,867
Me... I was outside...

711
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:11,670
Okay... I saw you running
from behind...

712
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:15,403
Yes... I was running,
but not from behind.

713
01:08:15,566 --> 01:08:17,367
I was running behind somebody.

714
01:08:17,466 --> 01:08:20,869
He is lying. He has done it.
I saw the dagger in his hand.

715
01:08:20,933 --> 01:08:22,401
He was attacking, ask him.

716
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:25,735
Hey... smart ass... what lies...
I followed him.

717
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,401
But he escaped.
- Just a minute.

718
01:08:28,566 --> 01:08:29,733
Who was he?

719
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:32,669
Him... I don't know...

720
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:37,402
See, if this wasn't India
I'd have ran ahead of him'...

721
01:08:37,466 --> 01:08:40,402
...and held him like this, but...
didn't I tell you...

722
01:08:40,466 --> 01:08:43,402
...that there are more potholes
than roads here?

723
01:08:43,466 --> 01:08:44,567
To run here...

724
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,568
You people don't believe
me, isn't it?

725
01:09:01,866 --> 01:09:05,502
You... you stammer... don't you?
You can be the one too.

726
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,335
I have seen many Hindi movies.

727
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,668
The one who stammers is the
murderer in all those movies.

728
01:09:09,866 --> 01:09:13,803
And it can be you. So what if
you are in a police uniform?

729
01:09:13,866 --> 01:09:15,334
Don't you know how
many policemen...

730
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,801
...are being arrested today? Why?

731
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,734
Why met It can be anyone.

732
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,434
See, did you see what he is
speaking about, inspector?

733
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,335
I'd suggest you to tie
his hands and legs.

734
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,701
Hey... her...

735
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,468
The one who was locked
is still unlocked.

736
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:30,735
It is possible that
the murderer is here.

737
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,500
That is what I am telling too.

738
01:09:33,733 --> 01:09:35,734
He seems to be dangerous.

739
01:09:44,866 --> 01:09:47,335
These are the proofs
I got tonight.

740
01:09:47,533 --> 01:09:49,735
This is the reason I called
this meeting, your honor.

741
01:10:05,933 --> 01:10:09,336
But to prove this, it's necessary
for the accused to be here.

742
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,335
Sir, I had called the
jail, they said...

743
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:14,335
...that it is two hours
that they left there.

744
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,668
It is raining heavily, it's
possible they're stuck up.

745
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,503
We can decide this
after we meet him.

746
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:26,335
Your story is very interesting.
And if this is the truth...

747
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:29,836
...this is an example of
a irresponsible act.

748
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:33,636
All of us can be responsible
to be punished for this.

749
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:35,867
Please continue.

750
01:10:42,733 --> 01:10:44,601
We will leave.
- Take me from here.

751
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,868
We will leave as soon
as the rain stops.

752
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,334
Sit down now.

753
01:10:55,866 --> 01:10:57,334
Enough.

754
01:10:57,933 --> 01:10:59,868
I had told that I don't
want to stay here.

755
01:11:00,533 --> 01:11:02,268
I don't want to stay here.

756
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:05,568
Take me from here... take me...

757
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,267
We will leave as soon
as the rain stops.

758
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:12,270
Silent... silent... or
else I will kill you.

759
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,467
Take her from here.

760
01:11:14,866 --> 01:11:19,470
How will you kill met
All of you will die.

761
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:23,770
See what she is talking about.
We all will die.

762
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:25,267
Take her from here.

763
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:29,267
See, it is only about
a little while.

764
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:31,601
But why in my room?
- For humanity's sake.

765
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,335
So much has taken place. We
cannot leave her like this.

766
01:11:34,433 --> 01:11:37,569
Then for humanity's sake, tell
her to keep quiet. - Okay.

767
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:40,869
See, I will be right back,
take care till then.

768
01:11:41,433 --> 01:11:44,936
Please don't scold her. Mehek,
I'll be right back.

769
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:49,268
All of them will die. She
speaks whatever she feels like.

770
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:52,268
And she tied this
crazy girl with me.

771
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,268
What will I do alone here?

772
01:12:28,366 --> 01:12:30,201
Are you going somewhere?

773
01:12:30,733 --> 01:12:32,201
How are you concerned?

774
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:34,201
Two murders have been
committed outside.

775
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:37,401
And you... what do you
have in your hands?

776
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:39,534
What are you doing in my room?
- What is that in your hand?

777
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,268
Avinash... - What do you
have in your hands?

778
01:12:43,566 --> 01:12:44,667
What did you do?

779
01:12:45,366 --> 01:12:46,500
So much money?

780
01:12:47,733 --> 01:12:50,602
They are mine. I earned
them by selling my body.

781
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:53,201
Do you want to know
anything else?

782
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:58,201
The shadow of my body
is on every note.

783
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,635
Everyone suspects me because
I am a prostitute.

784
01:13:03,533 --> 01:13:06,135
The reception first, then the
policeman. And then you.

785
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:11,633
leave me.

786
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:15,135
I am sorry, I had
a misunderstanding.

787
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:18,102
I thought...
- This... - Relax.

788
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,469
Driver and gun. You are
an interesting driver.

789
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:48,434
Something is amiss.
You seem more...

790
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:50,701
...of a body guard than a driver.

791
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:54,534
Neither am I a driver
or a body guard.

792
01:13:55,533 --> 01:13:56,634
Then?

793
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,601
Does this have a roll?
- Yes.

794
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:09,667
Come with me.
- Where?

795
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:19,400
Why do you have this gun?

796
01:14:20,566 --> 01:14:22,367
Because I was Ms. Kashmira's
secretary.

797
01:14:27,466 --> 01:14:29,467
And being her secretary...

798
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:34,603
If I didn't protect her,
who else would?

799
01:14:37,566 --> 01:14:39,234
Did you wish to do
this all the time?

800
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:43,468
I mean... become a secretary?

801
01:14:45,233 --> 01:14:46,400
No.

802
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:48,601
I was studying medicine
like that.

803
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:51,234
And my father was in the police.

804
01:14:56,433 --> 01:14:58,568
He was killed in an encounter
all of a sudden one day.

805
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:02,268
And I had to look for this job.

806
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:05,001
As it is... in the medical
profession...

807
01:15:05,066 --> 01:15:08,002
I used to be involved
with people...

808
01:15:08,066 --> 01:15:10,601
...who were victims of rape,
riots and etcetera.

809
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:19,334
I was bored of so much violence.

810
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:23,001
And I left everything one day.

811
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,001
What do you wish to
do of so much money?

812
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,300
Grape gardens.

813
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,001
Grape gardens?

814
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,001
Grape gardens.

815
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:41,001
I want to buy them.

816
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:45,001
I used to own them.

817
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:49,003
Munni...
- They were burnt.

818
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,603
Everything was ruined.
- Save us...

819
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,333
Papa...

820
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:02,934
I was sixteen years old.

821
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,901
When I came from
Nasik to Mumbai.

822
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,934
I wanted to be something else...

823
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,935
And I became something else.

824
01:16:18,266 --> 01:16:19,934
All I knew was...

825
01:16:20,466 --> 01:16:21,934
I had to be rich.

826
01:16:23,266 --> 01:16:24,934
Very rich.

827
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,435
So that I could
start once again.

828
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:36,336
From where I had ended it all.

829
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:44,268
Wanted to lead a dignified life.

830
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:57,269
Now with that money...
everything is possible.

831
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,201
Everything.

832
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:15,868
What is all this?

833
01:17:16,033 --> 01:17:17,868
Hey... what are you doing?

834
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,468
What I think you
should have done.

835
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:51,768
One more is gone.

836
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:55,068
If he hasn't... he will go.

837
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,801
He will surely go.

838
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,735
You will go first of all.

839
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,003
She has made you sit here
for humanity's sake.

840
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:09,735
And you are blabbering
since so long.

841
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,735
So long... Silent... or else
I will chuck you out.

842
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:13,735
Silent... silent...

843
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,335
Hold him... beat him...

844
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:33,202
Will you keep her here now?
- We are helpless.

845
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:35,801
We will leave as soon as the
road opens in the morning.

846
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:39,737
No... no... I am very scared.
Staying with a killer here...

847
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,069
Hey, joker. He was a killer
when he came into this hotel.

848
01:19:43,133 --> 01:19:47,737
When he came in this hotel
those dead bodies weren't bod'ies

849
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:50,067
Then?

850
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:51,734
Has he accepted that he
committed the murders?

851
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:54,902
let him gain conscious.
I will ask him then.

852
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:57,701
He will regain conscious
in a while.

853
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,935
I had hit him this much
just to arrest him.

854
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:07,734
You people can go and rest.

855
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:09,734
I will take care of him.

856
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,736
How can one rest when
a dangerous...

857
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,202
...killer is below our roof.
- India.  Yes?

858
01:20:15,266 --> 01:20:16,734
This happens only in India.

859
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:19,135
Where you can find thieves and
police under the same roof.

860
01:20:20,133 --> 01:20:22,935
I will take care of Mitali.
Shall we move?

861
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,001
Jatin, are you sure that you
can take care of him alone?

862
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:27,935
Who said that I am alone?
He is with me, isn't it?

863
01:20:29,133 --> 01:20:31,101
Where are you going? Sit here.

864
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,101
No... I will go...
- Sit here!

865
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:42,735
Oh God... thank you...

866
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:45,735
Mitali, you have regained
conscious.

867
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:47,735
We will go away from here now.

868
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:53,069
I was feeling so lonely
without you.

869
01:20:54,899 --> 01:20:57,002
I didn't understand where
to go and what to do.

870
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:01,969
Nobody will survive.
All will die.

871
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:07,669
Nobody listens to me.
Everyone will die.

872
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:18,934
She regained conscious.
She regained conscious.

873
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,837
You have come, sir... she
regained conscious.

874
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,001
Thank you sir. All that
is because of you.

875
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:28,867
If you didn't stop her blood...

876
01:21:28,933 --> 01:21:30,200
I don't know what would
have happened to her.

877
01:21:30,266 --> 01:21:32,067
like that, we have
caught that killer.

878
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:34,868
He is the killer, it is
a misunderstanding.

879
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:38,635
We will go away from here
as soon as the rain stops.

880
01:21:38,733 --> 01:21:41,135
No. we will stay
in one room now.

881
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:44,202
let us see if the convict
is a killer or not? - Yes.

882
01:21:48,733 --> 01:21:50,201
It is just for a while more...

883
01:21:50,266 --> 01:21:51,667
...everything will be all right.
- Right, sir.

884
01:21:51,733 --> 01:21:53,668
It is a misunderstanding.

885
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:55,868
It is a misunderstanding.
It is a misunderstanding.

886
01:21:55,933 --> 01:21:57,200
Mehek, just relax.

887
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:00,601
Nobody will survive. He
has killed Varun too.

888
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,800
He will kill all of us.

889
01:22:01,866 --> 01:22:03,801
Mehek...
- I won't spare you.

890
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,269
You will die. You will die too.
All of us will die.

891
01:22:07,766 --> 01:22:09,601
Shut her up, my wife
has regained...

892
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:11,100
...conscious with
great difficulty.

893
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:14,068
And now she... suspicious...
suspicious...

894
01:22:14,133 --> 01:22:15,200
Sir... sir...

895
01:22:15,266 --> 01:22:18,769
You killed your husband
by suspecting him.

896
01:22:18,866 --> 01:22:21,134
And god knows where she
is thrusting us into now.

897
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,267
Come with me.

898
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,802
She is crazy, send her
to a mental asylum.

899
01:22:34,766 --> 01:22:35,933
Hey...

900
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,101
Hey...
- Yes?

901
01:22:37,866 --> 01:22:40,768
Will I get something to eat?
Will I get something to eat?

902
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,568
There are some grams
in the reception.

903
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:45,867
Should I bring them?

904
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:49,803
You fool... I am hungry.
Will I eat grams?

905
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,601
Okay, you sit here, I
will relieve myself.

906
01:22:57,766 --> 01:22:59,934
Yes, come on. let us relieve
ourselves. - Not you... me!

907
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:02,535
I will relieve myself.
You go after me.

908
01:23:03,033 --> 01:23:04,534
We cannot leave him here again.

909
01:23:04,733 --> 01:23:08,536
But me... see... if I sit
with him all alone...

910
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,537
...I will be relieved right
here. - You scared pussy.

911
01:23:13,533 --> 01:23:15,801
He is tied up, and yet
you are so scared?

912
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,702
You get scared so easily.
- I am shit scared, sir.

913
01:23:19,899 --> 01:23:21,534
Sit here, I will
come right away.

914
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:24,935
I will come...
- Sit there!

915
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:28,535
Is he a prisoner or met

916
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:39,867
Hey...

917
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:41,534
Me... I didn't hurt you...

918
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:43,867
He is right.

919
01:23:47,933 --> 01:23:49,701
You were speaking a
lot there, isn't it?

920
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:55,203
See now, scared now, isn't it?

921
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:57,867
Scared cat!

922
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:05,802
I am tied up. What
can I do to you?

923
01:24:10,633 --> 01:24:11,800
Yes...

924
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,967
Yes... that means...

925
01:24:15,066 --> 01:24:17,067
Your hands are tied
I know that.

926
01:24:18,866 --> 01:24:20,467
You are smart.

927
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:21,967
What do you mean?

928
01:24:22,066 --> 01:24:24,134
I know about you.

929
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,768
What?

930
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,000
What do you know?

931
01:24:28,066 --> 01:24:29,467
I know everything.

932
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:30,867
What?

933
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,967
You know it?

934
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,468
Get lost.

935
01:24:43,733 --> 01:24:45,801
Who will believe you? Get lost.

936
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:52,639
Think about it. If you agree...
both will be happy.

937
01:24:54,966 --> 01:25:01,572
What will you do
if I don't agree?

938
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,068
What will you do? You baldy

939
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,667
What happened?

940
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,667
He is here.

941
01:26:30,866 --> 01:26:32,334
And he is moving around too.

942
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,334
He left him alone once again.

943
01:26:53,733 --> 01:26:55,334
Where are you going?

944
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:57,335
I didn't do anything.
I swear to my mother.

945
01:26:57,399 --> 01:26:58,501
I didn't do anything.

946
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,335
Why were you running away? I
told you to stay with him.

947
01:27:10,633 --> 01:27:12,234
Well... this knife... I had...

948
01:27:19,766 --> 01:27:21,267
Come on!

949
01:27:22,433 --> 01:27:23,801
You killed him too, isn't
It? You killed him too?

950
01:27:23,866 --> 01:27:26,468
I didn't kill anyone...
I am telling you.

951
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,268
Then how did he die?
How did he die?

952
01:27:32,266 --> 01:27:33,533
These money... - From where
did you get this money?

953
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,767
I took this money from
that actress's house.

954
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,467
This is my money now.
This isn't yours.

955
01:27:36,533 --> 01:27:40,270
See... see... I had told you
about the dagger, isn't it?

956
01:27:40,733 --> 01:27:42,434
See... it is on his neck.

957
01:27:42,766 --> 01:27:44,234
He has done everything.

958
01:27:45,433 --> 01:27:49,670
Give me my money. You wretch...
I told everyone since so long...

959
01:27:49,733 --> 01:27:51,534
I didn't kill anyone...
I didn't kill anyone...

960
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,468
You don't listen to me, should
I kill someone now?

961
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:56,268
Wait... wait there...

962
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,269
Think about it. If my
dagger is there...

963
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:02,202
...that what am I doing with
this dagger of mine?

964
01:28:10,366 --> 01:28:12,201
Hey... Hey... Who is this?

965
01:28:12,366 --> 01:28:14,201
Your father?
- Tell me the truth.

966
01:28:15,266 --> 01:28:16,500
Why did you kill all of them?

967
01:28:16,699 --> 01:28:20,703
I didn't kill anyone.
I am not a killer.

968
01:28:21,466 --> 01:28:25,203
How and why he died,
I don't know.

969
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:28,535
I am a small time crook, I was
running away from Bombay to Goa.

970
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:30,801
The weather turned
bad in the night.

971
01:28:30,866 --> 01:28:33,535
I stayed in this hotel.
I was hungry.

972
01:28:33,699 --> 01:28:35,701
I reached this storeroom
looking for food.

973
01:28:36,466 --> 01:28:39,368
There wasn't anyone to ask
about this dead body.

974
01:28:39,533 --> 01:28:42,202
Therefore, I put his dead
body in the freezer.

975
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:44,534
And to spend the night,
I sat at the reception.

976
01:28:44,733 --> 01:28:46,734
All of you came here one by one.

977
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,201
You thought that I was
a receptionist and...

978
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,668
I don't know anything. Just
let me go from here.

979
01:28:53,366 --> 01:28:55,201
The story was good,
but it didn't gel.

980
01:28:55,366 --> 01:28:58,368
You will speak like a parrot
when the police kicks you.

981
01:28:59,366 --> 01:29:01,401
You...
- let me go... I am telling you.

982
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:03,134
I didn't do anything, let me go.

983
01:29:08,133 --> 01:29:12,670
Stop it, Jatin. Are
you mad? let him go.

984
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:14,467
Don't spare him, Jatin.

985
01:29:16,533 --> 01:29:18,601
He has committed the murder.
I know it.

986
01:29:20,533 --> 01:29:23,135
Don't spare him. Catch him.

987
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:30,135
Don't spare him. Catch him.

988
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:31,534
Where are you running?

989
01:29:34,466 --> 01:29:35,533
Where are you going?

990
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,135
He has come, sir. He is here.

991
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,135
Did you commit this murder?

992
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,467
Do you recognize this?

993
01:30:49,633 --> 01:30:51,134
This?

994
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,467
This?
- I don't know anything.

995
01:30:52,633 --> 01:30:56,303
Your fingerprints are here.
You committed this murder.

996
01:30:57,533 --> 01:31:01,136
I was there, I didn't
do anything.

997
01:31:04,133 --> 01:31:05,367
Is this your voice?

998
01:31:05,433 --> 01:31:08,569
What are you doing?
He can react!

999
01:31:09,466 --> 01:31:11,601
I know what I am doing. Let
me do what I am doing.

1000
01:31:17,066 --> 01:31:19,535
I am sorry, sir. I am really
sorry, your honor.

1001
01:31:20,566 --> 01:31:24,069
But I need more time with
him. If you permit me.

1002
01:31:25,466 --> 01:31:27,067
Please sir, it is
a serious problem.

1003
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:30,067
I need your complete
cooperation.

1004
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,567
What happened?

1005
01:31:56,233 --> 01:31:58,068
I am sorry.

1006
01:31:59,133 --> 01:32:01,001
Your husband...

1007
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:48,401
Wait, Jatin. Don't
touch anything now.

1008
01:32:49,166 --> 01:32:50,333
Didn't you catch him till now?

1009
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:52,268
All this is happening because
of that receptionist.

1010
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,268
Inspector, what are
you doing here?

1011
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:57,269
Go and handcuff him first,
what proof do you need now?

1012
01:32:58,266 --> 01:33:00,201
So much has happened with
us because of him.

1013
01:33:04,466 --> 01:33:08,937
See... this key. How did
this key come here?

1014
01:33:11,466 --> 01:33:12,934
Before this too...

1015
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,301
How is it possible?

1016
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,267
This means that...

1017
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:24,935
He kept the key here wittingly.

1018
01:33:28,433 --> 01:33:29,934
He will kill me.

1019
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:38,138
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1020
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:40,201
Sonia... Sonia... listen to me.

1021
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:41,934
Nothing will happen.
Come with me.

1022
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,201
listen to me... come here.

1023
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,401
Why is this happening
to all of us? Why?

1024
01:33:47,433 --> 01:33:48,934
Everything will be
fine. Sit here.

1025
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:02,869
Do you people know
that this motel...

1026
01:34:02,933 --> 01:34:06,936
...is connected to a cemetery?
It is said...

1027
01:34:08,133 --> 01:34:10,401
...that some spirit...
- You mean to say...

1028
01:34:11,266 --> 01:34:13,201
These murders have
been committed...

1029
01:34:13,266 --> 01:34:15,368
...by some spirit or some ghost?

1030
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:17,867
Please stop your nonsense...

1031
01:34:18,033 --> 01:34:19,868
The child has gone
away being afraid.

1032
01:34:20,266 --> 01:34:23,369
Have you seen the hindi movie Gumnaam?

1033
01:34:25,233 --> 01:34:27,168
There was a island there.

1034
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:30,201
Ten people had gathered there.

1035
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,867
They were unknown to each other.

1036
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:38,537
They we found out... they were
connected to each other.

1037
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:45,037
In some time... each
one of them died.

1038
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:51,070
Something like that is
happening with us too.

1039
01:34:53,266 --> 01:34:55,868
But everyone knew each
other in the movie.

1040
01:34:56,266 --> 01:34:58,167
We have met today
for the first time.

1041
01:34:58,366 --> 01:34:59,834
Did you know me?

1042
01:34:59,933 --> 01:35:02,969
Did you know met Then? Then?

1043
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,801
I have never met you.
I have never met you!

1044
01:35:04,966 --> 01:35:07,968
Why is this happening to
all of us? Who are we?

1045
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,135
This is the handiwork
of someone amongst us.

1046
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:14,803
When Varun died, I saw him
running from behind...

1047
01:35:14,966 --> 01:35:17,134
Hey... why do you...
- Yes, he had the dagger.

1048
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,136
He was driving the car.
You are the killer.

1049
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:22,802
Silent... silent...
my mother... you...

1050
01:35:22,966 --> 01:35:24,967
This child had come in between.

1051
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:29,070
I turned the truck to
save him. His father...

1052
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:32,069
You people... - Then who can
be the killer? Tell me!

1053
01:35:32,866 --> 01:35:35,201
You are speaking a lot, stay
in your limits, understood?

1054
01:35:35,266 --> 01:35:36,800
Hey, mind your language.

1055
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:41,303
I let you stay here.
That was my mistake.

1056
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,801
It seems that someone is
committing these murders.

1057
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:48,402
And he is making us feel...

1058
01:35:48,966 --> 01:35:51,401
That all of these are murders.

1059
01:36:42,133 --> 01:36:43,934
Someone is here.
- What?

1060
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,735
There is someone here.

1061
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,934
There is someone else here.

1062
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,136
We were in this room but...

1063
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,235
I am telling you.
All of us will die.

1064
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:56,068
All of us will die! She
will kill everyone of us.

1065
01:36:56,133 --> 01:36:57,267
She is a spirit.

1066
01:36:57,333 --> 01:37:00,069
She will kill everyone of us.
Nobody listens to me.

1067
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:03,136
We will go from here.
We will go from here.

1068
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,000
What is it?

1069
01:37:07,066 --> 01:37:08,667
Do you know anything about this?

1070
01:37:08,733 --> 01:37:09,967
I have come just yesterday.

1071
01:37:10,133 --> 01:37:11,634
What do I know about
the relation...

1072
01:37:11,733 --> 01:37:13,167
...between the cemetery
and the motel?

1073
01:37:13,233 --> 01:37:15,134
I don't believe in these
spirits and all.

1074
01:37:16,266 --> 01:37:18,835
listen, Sonia. listen to me.

1075
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,668
You take the child and Mehek
and go away from here.

1076
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:22,935
Right now.
- What madness is this?

1077
01:37:23,733 --> 01:37:25,668
Nobody will go from here.

1078
01:37:25,933 --> 01:37:29,002
I... I suspect everyone.

1079
01:37:31,066 --> 01:37:33,668
I am a policeman.

1080
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:35,000
Really?

1081
01:37:35,166 --> 01:37:37,835
You should have done too
much being a policeman.

1082
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:42,134
What do you mean?

1083
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:43,634
I mean that you should
have got the idea...

1084
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:45,634
...of photographing
the dead bodies...

1085
01:37:45,733 --> 01:37:47,034
...but it was me
who got the idea.

1086
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:50,135
A prisoner whom you were
responsible for...

1087
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:53,202
...is killed in your presence.
You couldn't do anything.

1088
01:37:53,266 --> 01:37:56,002
Five people were killed
in your presence today.

1089
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,601
Nobody will go from here.

1090
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,602
Sonia, you go away with
Mehek and the child.

1091
01:38:08,866 --> 01:38:10,767
Avinash, you...
- I will come...

1092
01:38:10,866 --> 01:38:12,601
You go with Mehek and the child.

1093
01:38:18,866 --> 01:38:22,102
Go inside... Go in the car.

1094
01:38:22,766 --> 01:38:24,601
You go ahead, I will
come with Avinash.

1095
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,602
I have to take my bags too. Go...

1096
01:38:36,766 --> 01:38:38,601
Avinash!

1097
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:44,033
Open me up.

1098
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,535
Shut up. If you
open your mouth...

1099
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,867
...I won't let you
cross beyond too.

1100
01:39:54,933 --> 01:39:57,201
No... Avinash...

1101
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:00,802
Avinash...

1102
01:40:00,866 --> 01:40:02,200
He is not here, what is it?

1103
01:40:03,933 --> 01:40:06,035
He is not a police man.
He is a killer.

1104
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:10,537
Who is the killer?
- That SP is the prisoner...

1105
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,535
This is too much... come on...

1106
01:40:12,699 --> 01:40:17,538
Hey... I am here.

1107
01:40:18,699 --> 01:40:19,867
He is the one.

1108
01:40:20,066 --> 01:40:23,702
Yes, I am the one. And now...
it is you two in line.

1109
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:26,535
One second... listen to me.

1110
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:34,535
India... India... India...

1111
01:40:34,866 --> 01:40:37,702
He troubled me all
through the night.

1112
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:41,701
It would have been better
if I killed him first.

1113
01:40:47,933 --> 01:40:49,868
Why?
- Save me!

1114
01:41:09,866 --> 01:41:12,068
He is a killer... where were you?

1115
01:41:16,866 --> 01:41:18,467
He has... you too...

1116
01:41:19,633 --> 01:41:21,668
He killed him in my presence.

1117
01:41:22,866 --> 01:41:25,468
He is dead. He will kill us too.

1118
01:41:27,633 --> 01:41:29,468
Nothing will happen.
- Do something, Avinash.

1119
01:41:29,866 --> 01:41:33,002
listen to me... you stay here.
Nothing will happen.

1120
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,401
Avinash...

1121
01:42:00,933 --> 01:42:03,669
Avinash... Come from
here... Avinash...

1122
01:42:22,666 --> 01:42:24,801
Avinash... Avinash...

1123
01:42:25,733 --> 01:42:28,735
Avinash...

1124
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,802
This tape has your voice. And
this has your finger prints.

1125
01:42:41,899 --> 01:42:43,568
I was there but I didn't
commit the murders.

1126
01:42:43,666 --> 01:42:44,767
Mr. Manas Dutta.

1127
01:42:45,566 --> 01:42:46,767
Come on... okay.

1128
01:42:46,866 --> 01:42:50,736
We will not talk about this. We
will talk about your mother.

1129
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:54,402
You loved your mother, isn't it?

1130
01:42:54,566 --> 01:42:55,800
Hey... how are you concerned
with that?

1131
01:42:55,933 --> 01:42:58,735
Tell us the truth, was your
mother a good and honest woman?

1132
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:05,602
Your father, step father.
How was he?

1133
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:07,734
Did he hit you?
- No.

1134
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:09,834
Then why do you hate him?

1135
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:13,336
I didn't hate him. I loved him.

1136
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,335
lies. listen to this.

1137
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:18,302
You agree that you
killed all of them?

1138
01:43:21,733 --> 01:43:22,867
Manas...

1139
01:43:23,733 --> 01:43:26,535
Manas...

1140
01:43:28,733 --> 01:43:29,867
Stop it.

1141
01:43:30,733 --> 01:43:33,602
Yeah... you agree that you
killed all of them, isn't it?

1142
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:34,733
Stop it.

1143
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,335
You killed them...

1144
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:38,734
What are you asking?

1145
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:42,535
I told you so many times,
I didn't commit any murder.

1146
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:48,835
Go away from here.
- Who is there?

1147
01:43:49,733 --> 01:43:52,302
I tell you, go away from here.
- Who are you speaking to?

1148
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:53,501
Manas...
- Stop it.

1149
01:43:53,566 --> 01:43:55,334
I tell you... stop it...

1150
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:57,667
Go away from here. listen...

1151
01:44:00,433 --> 01:44:02,268
There isn't anyone
here except us two.

1152
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:03,600
Take me out from here.

1153
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:05,267
Who are you speaking with?

1154
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:11,270
Yes... I killed her. My
mother was a bad woman.

1155
01:44:11,766 --> 01:44:14,268
She made me stand
outside the door.

1156
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:18,267
And she would meet her lovers.

1157
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:19,767
Then one day...

1158
01:44:20,766 --> 01:44:26,938
I... saw her hit my father.
She killed my father.

1159
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,768
And said that it was suicide.

1160
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,269
But why did you kill those
men in the highway motel?

1161
01:44:34,433 --> 01:44:36,268
And how did you kill them?

1162
01:44:36,433 --> 01:44:40,270
Tell me... Tell me. Manas,
how did you kill them?

1163
01:44:41,666 --> 01:44:44,268
She didn't help anyone
even when she could.

1164
01:44:44,433 --> 01:44:48,270
She was an egotistic woman.
She had no right to live.

1165
01:44:51,666 --> 01:44:55,269
She was a prostitute. Sold
her body for money.

1166
01:44:56,633 --> 01:44:58,634
You bitch... I will kill you...

1167
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:03,369
He threatened to kill his
wife, he was a bad man.

1168
01:45:05,533 --> 01:45:07,201
She was a prostitute too.

1169
01:45:08,733 --> 01:45:12,369
lying woman. She married
that man by lying to him.

1170
01:45:13,466 --> 01:45:15,201
He had raped a innocent girl.

1171
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,202
He was scaring me thinking
that I was a small boy.

1172
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,201
He showed me his strength.

1173
01:45:25,533 --> 01:45:27,201
And how did you
kill your mother?

1174
01:45:27,266 --> 01:45:29,201
Tell me... tell me, Manas.

1175
01:45:29,366 --> 01:45:31,868
My mother killed my father
for another man.

1176
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,201
That night, our tyre punctured
on the highway.

1177
01:45:35,366 --> 01:45:38,202
Father was changing the tyre,
My mother was standing there...

1178
01:45:38,266 --> 01:45:40,201
...there was a car coming.

1179
01:45:40,533 --> 01:45:42,735
While playing... I took her
to the middle of the road...

1180
01:45:43,366 --> 01:45:47,369
The car ran over her. But
my mother was saved.

1181
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,535
As soon as I got
another chance...

1182
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,369
...I killed my mother and took
revenge of my father's death.

1183
01:46:03,433 --> 01:46:05,501
Tell us, why did you
kill your father?

1184
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,134
He was a step father.
He was the reason...

1185
01:46:10,466 --> 01:46:14,303
He was not my father. He was
the reason of my father's death.

1186
01:46:14,466 --> 01:46:17,302
I came in front of the truck
wittingly that night.

1187
01:46:18,533 --> 01:46:22,303
Did you kill these people?
Him? Her?

1188
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:25,669
No. I don't kill good people.
I left Sonia, isn't it?

1189
01:46:26,633 --> 01:46:29,469
Some have died their own death.

1190
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:34,403
And some were killed by him,
he has killed them.

1191
01:46:34,533 --> 01:46:36,635
I didn't kill anyone.

1192
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,635
You said that you left Sonia.

1193
01:46:40,533 --> 01:46:42,134
You must be knowing
where she is.

1194
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,402
Tell me. Where is Sonia.

1195
01:46:44,533 --> 01:46:48,336
I don't know. Hey... you
go away from here.

1196
01:46:48,466 --> 01:46:50,534
No. why should I go?

1197
01:46:50,633 --> 01:46:52,735
Didn't I tell you to
go away from here?

1198
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:55,334
Whom are you speaking to?

1199
01:46:56,399 --> 01:46:58,602
I hate you, get lost.

1200
01:46:58,733 --> 01:47:01,268
Is it? You hate me now?

1201
01:47:01,533 --> 01:47:04,235
You are what you are
because of me today.

1202
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:09,638
Hey. I will kill you...
hey. Release me...

1203
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:12,034
Get him removed from the jail.

1204
01:47:12,233 --> 01:47:13,601
He has come once again...

1205
01:47:13,666 --> 01:47:15,534
See... he will not spare me.

1206
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,269
He will come again... I will
kill everyone once again.

1207
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,235
leave him, move back.

1208
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,601
This condition is known
as dual personality.

1209
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:38,068
If anyone is abused as a child...

1210
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:40,568
...if they are a victim
of child abuse...

1211
01:47:40,666 --> 01:47:43,635
...then sometimes, they
lose their mental...

1212
01:47:43,733 --> 01:47:46,035
...balance in the young
age. And then...

1213
01:47:46,133 --> 01:47:49,402
...they are pressurized
by life at a young age.

1214
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:51,400
In this case...

1215
01:47:51,466 --> 01:47:55,236
They live two or more
characters together.

1216
01:47:57,333 --> 01:47:58,400
In this case...

1217
01:47:58,466 --> 01:48:01,001
The other character
of the childhood...

1218
01:48:01,066 --> 01:48:03,001
...Manas is still alive in him.

1219
01:48:04,399 --> 01:48:06,535
Therefore... It is Manas who is
committing all these murders.

1220
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:10,002
He is evil. Manas is committing
this murders.

1221
01:48:10,166 --> 01:48:11,467
Not Manas Dutta.

1222
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:14,502
That child is making him
commit these murders.

1223
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:17,969
Therefore, we couldn't find
a proper motive till today.

1224
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:23,002
These people are not
worthy of death...

1225
01:48:23,066 --> 01:48:25,168
...but they are worthy
of medical treatment.

1226
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:27,601
Sir... I request you...

1227
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:31,169
Please think twice about
your decision.

1228
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:33,468
Doctor Sagar, it is interesting.

1229
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:36,401
If he is not mentally stable...

1230
01:48:36,466 --> 01:48:39,001
Why didn't you find
about his dual...

1231
01:48:39,066 --> 01:48:41,334
...personality, when you met
him for the first time?

1232
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:44,002
Sir... if you see the records...

1233
01:48:44,066 --> 01:48:48,003
His dual personality
was seen many times...

1234
01:48:48,066 --> 01:48:50,968
...with Dr. Narayanan. But as
he spent time in prison...

1235
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:54,002
...he started having
less and less fits.

1236
01:48:54,266 --> 01:48:56,468
And we didn't see much of
his dual personality.

1237
01:48:57,533 --> 01:48:59,334
And till the time
I got this case...

1238
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:01,268
...Manas has become
totally dormant.

1239
01:49:01,533 --> 01:49:06,104
Till today. When we woke
him up. Till then.

1240
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:08,468
Otherwise... he would
have never risen.

1241
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:13,269
I wished that this poor
man shouldn't be hanged.

1242
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:15,535
Therefore, I had to present
all this to you.

1243
01:49:17,466 --> 01:49:21,436
This man is sick, he
is not a criminal.

1244
01:49:22,233 --> 01:49:23,434
If this is the truth...

1245
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,902
Why didn't you present
these tapes...

1246
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,336
...and proofs when the case was
heard for the first time?

1247
01:49:30,333 --> 01:49:31,534
Sir, before me... Mr. Narayanan...

1248
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,268
...was the psychiatrist
of this killer.

1249
01:49:34,199 --> 01:49:36,101
He had submitted these tapes.

1250
01:49:36,266 --> 01:49:37,934
But after he died...
those tapes...

1251
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,135
...and those records were
not taken care of.

1252
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,936
This proof was in
the police records.

1253
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,935
Even then, nobody took
interest in them.

1254
01:49:46,266 --> 01:49:49,335
He may be ill, but
he is a killer.

1255
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:52,401
And when he committed
these murders...

1256
01:49:52,466 --> 01:49:54,234
...he wasn't a kid at that time.

1257
01:49:54,533 --> 01:49:55,934
Sir...

1258
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,401
What should be interesting is...

1259
01:49:57,433 --> 01:49:59,935
When he committed
these murders...

1260
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,936
...his mental age was of a
child, and it is till today.

1261
01:50:03,266 --> 01:50:04,934
And all of you have
seen it today.

1262
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:16,935
By the powers appointed to me
by the Maharashtra High Court...

1263
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,935
...I, the judge D S Singh,
on the date...

1264
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,402
...seventeenth of December,
2020. .

1265
01:50:21,466 --> 01:50:23,467
...on the basis of
the second appeal...

1266
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:25,935
...in the case Manas
Dutta VS the state...

1267
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,936
...have decided that
Manas, who was...

1268
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,901
...to be hanged under
the section 302...

1269
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,302
...is not guilty of
this punishment.

1270
01:50:33,433 --> 01:50:35,935
On the basis of the
proofs submitted...

1271
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,936
...I release Manas Dutta
till the day...

1272
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,936
...he doesn't become
mentally stable...

1273
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,935
...under the section 84.
I permit him...

1274
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,936
...to be admitted in the
Government psychiatric...

1275
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,469
...ward of the AIFF hospital
for treatment.

1276
01:50:49,533 --> 01:50:52,269
His hearing is postponed
till the day...

1277
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:55,335
...he doesn't regain
his mental balance.

1278
01:50:57,433 --> 01:50:58,934
Stop the car.

1279
01:51:15,033 --> 01:51:16,200
Doctor...

1280
01:51:17,266 --> 01:51:20,469
You cannot catch me so easily.
You don't know me.

1281
01:51:22,266 --> 01:51:24,201
You recognize me. But
it wasn't useful.

1282
01:51:24,266 --> 01:51:26,201
Because I don't want
to be cured at all.

1283
01:51:26,266 --> 01:51:35,375
See. You can be cured. You are
sick. listen... you will be cured.

1284
01:51:35,466 --> 01:51:40,470
Silent! Who is to be cured?
Who is sick?

1285
01:51:41,399 --> 01:51:46,338
This society is ill.
Cure it first...

1286
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:48,200
I am ill?

1287
01:52:21,966 --> 01:52:24,134
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

1288
01:52:24,966 --> 01:52:26,334
Is anyone here?

1289
01:52:26,966 --> 01:52:28,133
Who is this?

1290
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,468
See... I am Doctor Sakshi Sagar.

1291
01:52:30,866 --> 01:52:32,133
Yes, tell me.

1292
01:52:32,866 --> 01:52:34,867
There was an incident
with us on the highway.

1293
01:52:35,066 --> 01:52:39,303
The driver, policemen and
all prisoners are dead.

1294
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:42,968
Please send someone
here for help.

1295
01:52:43,866 --> 01:52:45,767
Dr. Sagar, the highway on
which you are presently...

1296
01:52:45,866 --> 01:52:47,100
...it will be half an
hour by the time...

1297
01:52:47,166 --> 01:52:48,800
...our rescue team
will reach there.

1298
01:52:49,966 --> 01:52:52,468
See... I am unwell...

1299
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:55,402
Send someone...

1300
01:52:55,966 --> 01:52:58,802
If I see someone
till that time...

1301
01:52:58,866 --> 01:53:01,068
...I will ask for help.

1302
01:53:02,133 --> 01:53:03,267
Okay.

1303
01:53:03,333 --> 01:53:06,069
But please don't touch
anything. - All right.

1304
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:02,667
See...

1305
01:54:02,733 --> 01:54:04,668
We were in an accident.

1306
01:54:04,833 --> 01:54:06,668
Please help me.

1307
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,669
Give me a lift till the city.

1308
01:54:10,833 --> 01:54:12,000
Come.

1309
01:54:17,833 --> 01:54:19,000
Thank you.

1310
01:54:19,833 --> 01:54:23,069
Will you have some? It is
wine?. From our garden.

1311
01:54:23,166 --> 01:54:24,934
No, thank you very much.

1312
01:54:27,033 --> 01:54:28,667
How did this accident
take place?

1313
01:54:29,933 --> 01:54:32,001
We were taking a criminal
to the hospital,

1314
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,335
Criminal? In an ambulance?

1315
01:54:37,266 --> 01:54:40,836
I am a doctor. This was a
case of split personality.

1316
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,000
I didn't understand.

1317
01:54:46,066 --> 01:54:47,667
This is an old story.

1318
01:54:48,833 --> 01:54:51,135
You must be remembering...

1319
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,835
Many people were killed in
a motel fifteen years ago.

1320
01:54:55,166 --> 01:54:57,968
At that time... the police didn't
get any proof of the killer.

1321
01:54:59,133 --> 01:55:02,269
And today, when the
case was unveiled...

1322
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,935
We found out...

1323
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,870
One eye witness of that
case is still alive.

1324
01:55:09,766 --> 01:55:11,000
Who is still silent
