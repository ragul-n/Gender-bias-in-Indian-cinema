The Habbit of working here from my birth,
It's hard for us to settle there.

14
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,670
Brother., Once you told me that if we work hard, 
it will be easy to settle in any place.

15
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He convinced his brother and moved his 
family to Hyderabad and opened a Small Garage.

He's not coming out from past one week.
His daughter died in road accident.

30
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:54,000
we didn,t know why god is ruthless sometimes,
it's not god, people..

31
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They Murdered her sir.!

32
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:28,021
They left her on road and saying that
it's an accident..!

33
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:33,451
Four members raped and killed his one and only daughter.

34
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,800
i also have that doubt., But they are influenced people.
they managed it without any proofs.

35
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Her parents are thinking about it and
they are not able to come out from home.

36
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:53,000
i'm also feeling sad,But i'm confident that
definetly one day they will get arrested., it means when.?

37
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,000
you tell him., it's not a 
vehicle repair to repair instantly.

38
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:05,357
Because they are village people
so they went to kill them.

39
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,682
Who are you.?

40
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:18,026
Do you know, how much a girl parents will 
panic if she didn't come from college.?

41
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:22,000
They feel scary..!

got to know that she won't come..?

44
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,878
Those 4 persons are dead.

If that was an accident, this is too,
If She was killed, these people too.

49
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Did u understood what you have done.? You came 
to live here. you are good people brother.!

50
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Daring should be added to Goodness.

51
00:08:43,071 --> 00:09:28,710
Daring means killing...?

52
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's like getting eyedrops and not able to eat 
anything by listening to people's difficulties.

53
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:58,000
People who have problems started moving to Janatha Garage.

54
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:02,542
They started solving the problems of all people.

55
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:16,000
Killing is the solution for Money.?That's 
Rowdyism. Is your's another type.?

56
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Janatha Garage is for People.

57
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:41,000
I have only one Sister.She came for the 
purpose of job and started liking yor brother.

58
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,900
We are not against their love. We 
enquired everything before comming here.

59
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,778
This is not matching for us.

60
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But i don't like to force her.

61
00:09:56,487 --> 00:10:01,000
It's better if he comes with us and search a job in Bombay.

62
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I won't come by leaving this house.

63
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
She likes me by seeing how i'm.

64
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:18,000
If you have any problem, you can take her with you.

65
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,884
I have decided to live here life long.
I won't say your words are wrong.

66
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This house will take care of your girl,Trust me.

67
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:41,392
Day by day they become like god for people.
and enemy's for some people.

68
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,120
Catch it, catch it.

If someone complaint us about you then only we'll interfear.
it's better for you to stop interfearing in other issues.

76
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:05,394
In Business unknowingly we'll interfear.But 
people don't know where to go. so they complain us.

There are 500 acers slums in this city.

118
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:06,950
They are very ugly and undevoloped.
I have devoloped a project for that.

119
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
if you vacate the 500 acers land. I will build a beautiful township for them in 250 acers land.

120
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:28,176
Houses, roads, parks etc.., I'll devolope remaining 
250 acers as commercial space, That's my share.

I'll arrange all party meeting soon., 
Ofcourse no one will oppose this.

125
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:18,177
Mom, You have to tell one thing to dad.

00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:29,778
You are not a kid to ask my help,
You can discuss it with your dad.

127
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:49,340
Veda Constructions group is expanding 
their business by starting new Venture.

128

It's dealing with crores. how can we..

130
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,000
They came for our help so many times.
They'll respect your words if you tell to them.

131
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,452
Wrong.! Helping people and asking them 
something in return is like Scandal.

132
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We have somuch influence, Business people, officers, polititions will come for our help. did we used anyone.?

133
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:33,000
Ok.. You didn't like to use them., ask for 
help this time for me like they did earlier.

134
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:46,000
Asking for help by saying that "my son passed 
in first class, very intelligent is help".

135
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Tell me what we'll call asking share by saying that "my son wants to enjoy luxery life with crores".

136
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000

Only 2 laks was sactioned for each family right.!

141
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:43,000
and you demanded people to give 75,000 to you.

142
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:49,000
When people asked about this "you threatend 
people and beaten brutly"

143
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:56,000
Those 15 family's complained me.They are 
very dispressed for loosing their people.

144
00:26:56,196 --> 00:27:01,000
It's not correct, Please give thier money to them.

145
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,524
Is this new style of threatening..?

146

10 lakhs.But it has to done within one hour..

152

153
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:36,000
Sorry for the delay.,came by making a small repair..

154
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:56,000
We all know the project proposed by Mukesh sir,
Please tell you openions about that.

155
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,431
Mukesh  sir is very familier to us. It's very useful to people and for his business.

156
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Without making any issue we have accept this unanimously. 
That's my feeling.

157
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,000
We have to start this immediately because 
it's very useful for people.

158
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:24,831
Our party also didn't have any problem 
if we get colony's in place of slums.

159
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,001
Mr.Satyam What will you say about the 
project proposed by  Mr.Mukhesh.

160
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:41,000
Who will oppose if it's helpful for poor 
people., But a small clarification.!

161
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,700
If we vacate the slums and handover the land to you, which is the first priority, Houses or Devoloping your 250 acer land.

162
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I need capital to finish this project. Financially it'll be easy for me if i devolope my 250 acers land.

163
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,000
Sorry sir, We don't accept it.

164
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:15,000
People live somewhere else by leaving their own places.

165
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
After Completing your your complexes 
you may face some problems.

166
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If you think that why we need to build these poor people houses between these complexes..?

167
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:34,000
Then they don't know what to do and where to go., 
atleast they don't have patience to move to courts.

168
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Please build Peoples houses with your kind heart first.

169
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,000
Impossible., It's impossible for me too.
Thanks for asking my openion.

170
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's Better to stop it here.

171
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Everyone doesn't have any problem, and you are going to stop this project by listening to mechanic words..

172
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If we start this project forcely, People will move to him for Justice. It's better to stop this before some issue happens.

173
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:22,000
The most intresting Hyderabad slums 
project clearence has been Rejected.

174
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:27,000

175

292
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:51,360
It has to stop automatically by doing some damage.

01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:28,747
But don't worry.You also have a sachin.

441
01:30:30,855 --> 01:30:33,043
Give him some support and allow him to do his work properly.

442
01:30:35,056 --> 01:30:38,000
He'll let you win like INDIA.

443
01:30:40,123 --> 01:30:43,089
i think you are going to retire in 1 or 2 yrs..

444
01:30:45,391 --> 01:30:48,016
That means you have earned somuch money for your childrens.

445
01:30:51,057 --> 01:30:54,024
You children don't show much intrest on money if they are good.

446
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,050
They sped your money within few days if they were bad.

447
01:31:00,825 --> 01:31:07,006
all you earned is waste., Telling stories to grand son and daughter is our next life.

448
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:14,156
We've to think about once upon there is a king like that.
watch him when you are in service only..!

449
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,019
You'll find stories like "Once there was 
an office., and a good vikas in that office".

450
01:31:22,962 --> 01:31:28,586
At last you may have one doubt, if people like 
them will come what we have to now.

You are young and educated too.
Don't you have the common sence to do this..?

469
01:39:23,074 --> 01:39:26,002
It's like very fancy and heroic for you when you are doing it.

470
01:39:27,809 --> 01:39:31,232
But you don't have right to do all this.!

471
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:41,099
Ok, do onething., Tell people that "Janatha Garage is wrong, we're here for you".

472
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,037
Turn all people from my side to your side.

473
01:39:45,044 --> 01:39:48,008
We're also happy if it happens..

474
01:39:49,444 --> 01:39:54,108
if those people standing in front of Janatha Garage and saying we're in problems.. Then we can't stop it sir..

483
01:41:43,152 --> 01:41:51,000
you promised him that you wont force him to touch the shadow of this house. But he looped back to you again.

484
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:57,076
He's doing the same thing what they are scared of..

485
01:41:57,487 --> 01:42:02,044
i'm promising on Janatha Garage which is half part of me.

486
01:42:03,523 --> 01:42:08,123
I don't even tried to see or talk to him from this many years.

487
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:19,184
We didn't know about him till now when you told me about him.

488
01:42:24,061 --> 01:42:31,028
No one will stop you if you want to take him with you.

01:42:43,062 --> 01:42:46,288
We booked return flight @ 5 O'clock for you too.

492
01:43:09,165 --> 01:43:13,959
This is your father's family,not yours..
Start as soon as possible ANAND.

493
01:43:14,612 --> 01:43:20,637
I'm happy when i don't have my mother and father because
i thought god gave me a good family like you.

494
01:43:21,047 --> 01:43:23,644
But God made me to loose another good family till now.

495
01:43:34,048 --> 01:43:37,144
How can i leave them.? Stop it ANAND. Just stop it.

496
01:43:38,683 --> 01:43:44,640
We fixed engagement for you and bujji.You have a beautiful future out there.Please start immediately by packing your luggage.

497
01:43:47,166 --> 01:43:51,655
She will be happy here after getting marriage.
she won't be alive if she was here.

498
01:43:56,067 --> 01:43:59,494
I lost my sister by sending her to live here.

499
01:44:02,933 --> 01:44:09,000
i don't want to send my daughter 
here please ANAND., come with us.

500
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:16,000
I want her uncle, ANd i want this house too.
It's impossible.

501
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:29,000
Don't tell me that you want both.God won't give 2 choices in one life. Janatha Garage or Bujji., Just one straight ans..

502
01:44:48,403 --> 01:44:53,000
i'm answerable to only your father in this world.

503
01:44:56,936 --> 01:45:03,835
It's not for my mom or dad. and not for this family.

504
01:45:10,038 --> 01:45:15,096
i won't do the things which makes him feel sad.

505
01:45:19,205 --> 01:45:24,069
Today they are asking me to decide you or This one..

506
01:45:28,039 --> 01:45:38,005
It's hard for me without you. But it's imposible for me to live without this.

507
01:45:43,074 --> 01:45:49,773
i'm asking you to forget me for happiness of Uncle..

508
01:45:50,075 --> 01:45:55,103
I want Happiness on his face. i'm ready to loose our love for his happiness.

509
01:46:04,509 --> 01:46:07,002
i'll leave my best here.

510
01:46:09,709 --> 01:46:18,175
I'm mad about what you will you do from our childhood.. everything.. At last this one too.

511
01:46:19,543 --> 01:46:25,169
But it'll give some pain too.

512
01:46:26,077 --> 01:46:34,500
But this is more painful.much more painfull.

513
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:47,045
I didn't think about my mother till now. I miss you.

514
01:46:49,046 --> 01:46:54,603
Are you mad..? what will you do here by loosing you love and happy life there.? what's here?

515

Your Dad saw you Last night how you came home.
They felt very sad.

519
01:49:33,617 --> 01:49:39,076
I think you're going out at nights.Our parents live here.
it's better if you come normally.

520
01:49:41,085 --> 01:49:43,019
Atleast, she has to be.

We're not Normal.? What do you mean. 
we aren't looking like people.?

524
01:50:10,888 --> 01:50:14,083
i'm saying "It's better if we're 
carefull in front of our parents."

525
01:50:15,322 --> 01:50:21,015
That means we are making noise by drinking..? i'm saying to stop coming to home by drunk. How dare you say that.! 

526
01:50:38,088 --> 01:50:44,086
If you think that your argument will by slaping people then
i can make more noise. 

527
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,026
"NO MORE PARTYS..!"

01:51:19,027 --> 01:51:23,125
He's leving from home., He's ready to 
leave from home from past few days.

529
01:51:29,061 --> 01:51:31,027

Grage also became Environmental friendly. Nice..

531
01:51:45,063 --> 01:51:53,000

But you too. It's necessary for us sir.

534
01:52:10,567 --> 01:52:16,033
Political pressure is heavy there. so they 
transfered me here. It's common for us right..!

535
01:52:19,901 --> 01:52:27,595
she went outside. i called her she's coming.we already informed right. what's more important than this to her.

536
01:52:48,002 --> 01:52:54,100
They informed me so sudden that you are coming.

537
01:52:55,269 --> 01:53:03,202
That's why i've decided to show my 
inner feeling than saying it.so i'm here with him.

538
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:08,261
This is ANAND. We've seen each other.

539
01:53:13,904 --> 01:53:20,131

541
01:53:28,071 --> 01:53:33,026
They discussed about marriage with her daughter-in-law when they are in mumbai. Is it..?

542
01:53:35,238 --> 01:53:40,033
How did you know..? we got into contact after her.

543
01:53:40,739 --> 01:53:47,967
This much fast., i don't accept it..I like him verymuch.
but i'm mad about you. true sir..

544
01:53:50,173 --> 01:53:56,038
You'll get another doubts after marriage if you marry her.

545
01:54:00,073 --> 01:54:04,000
They are looking good and likes each other.
it's better to arrange marriage for them.

546
01:54:04,074 --> 01:54:10,000
This is started just now right.! it's better to 
travel with him some more days..

547
01:54:10,142 --> 01:54:19,206
she already arranged someone. what's the discussion here.
I think sir will convince. Come..!

548
01:54:31,675 --> 01:54:38,801
i Want to talk with you. I left my Garage work and came here.
i'll come someother day.

549
01:54:42,009 --> 01:54:50,202
why you didn't tell this earlier. tried hard to manage.
If you want we can make this happen in our life.

550
01:54:57,576 --> 01:55:03,042
Recently i vacated two villages for 
2000cr mine project.he stopped that too.

551
01:55:09,043 --> 01:55:13,032
he's a kid. i'll handle him.

552
01:55:29,043 --> 01:55:34,208
Time moved very fastly.. 25 years.

553
01:55:35,811 --> 01:55:43,010
same place. Nothing changed.. 
People too.

554
01:55:46,012 --> 01:55:53,868
They can't understand because they are old people.

555
01:55:55,092 --> 01:56:01,718
But you're this generation man. You have 
dreams like me to live life king size.

556
01:56:02,925 --> 01:56:06,119
Ask any thing.. How much Big it is..

557
01:56:07,926 --> 01:56:09,722
i'll ask small thing only.

558
01:56:12,004 --> 01:56:14,049
Don't make worng things.

559
01:56:26,061 --> 01:56:37,087
i'm a Business man. I've somany goals. i'll move out of the way to achive them.Small people will suffer some times.

560
01:56:37,096 --> 01:56:45,596
i heard that you are Environmental science student.
i'll tell you in the way you can understand.

561
01:56:47,596 --> 01:56:57,222
Tiger will eat small animals to live in the Jungle.
That's Nature.

562
01:56:58,666 --> 01:57:04,224
We can't change it. i'm like Tiger. 
If i want to live small people will die.

563
01:57:08,339 --> 01:57:13,037
Yes, Tiger will kill small animals to live.

564
01:57:14,412 --> 01:57:21,673
But, In my story i'm the TIGER and small animals are...

565
01:57:24,946 --> 01:57:31,072
It's better to be carefull now.
Garage rules also changed.

566
01:57:32,013 --> 01:57:43,079
we moved to people if they were in problems,
But now we're moving intsantly to solve their problems.

567
01:57:47,684 --> 01:57:50,042
you have to be more carefull.

568
01:57:58,284 --> 01:58:04,910
My uncle met with an accident long ago.
But no one came to collect the car which was given to repair.

569
01:58:12,086 --> 01:58:17,317
I've doubt on every one that they did intentionally.
i've doubt on you too.

570
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,020
so it's better to hide from my eye sight.

571
01:58:36,129 --> 01:58:37,055
Ya, Tell me Mukesh Sir,

572
01:58:37,196 --> 01:58:46,062
i told you so many times to soly Janatha Garage issue. i'm giving more funds to your party.It's very problematic for me.

573
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:52,256
And another guy came recently. he's not leaving our people
and distrubing my Business.

574
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,792
I also heard that he is more dangerous than Satyam.

575
01:58:58,732 --> 01:59:05,164
Listen to me, Don't go that side.
if we lose business we can do something else.

576
01:59:06,277 --> 01:59:08,300
It's better to not to lose our life.

577
01:59:10,677 --> 01:59:19,973
Every one wants him. No one in this state and no political party against him.

578
01:59:20,077 --> 01:59:27,000
it's not good to see you like this because of this GARAGE.

579
01:59:29,845 --> 01:59:34,070
i'm feeling guilty to hear that this 
problem is because of my family.

580
01:59:40,679 --> 01:59:46,304
I want to do something for you,
Shall we remove JANATHA GARAGE..?

581
01:59:50,946 --> 01:59:54,707
It's impossible Raghava. i'm trying this from many years.

582
01:59:59,015 --> 02:00:04,072
Correct. It's not easy for you. But it's easy for Government.

583
02:00:04,582 --> 02:00:08,549
he's like a golden duck who gives crores to polititions.

584
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:13,545
what's the use with him when he is in CM chair.

585
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:18,978
Elections are getting closer.

586
02:00:19,018 --> 02:00:24,000
He is Ex-CM. if you made me CM, The very next minute of swearing in ceromony,

587
02:00:24,185 --> 02:00:30,708
within 1hr not only his Garage and also 
move scrap of his garage to Hussain Sagar.

588
02:00:31,919 --> 02:00:36,875
it's not a favour. you are important for each and every person.

589
02:00:46,553 --> 02:00:52,045
Government should be fallen by making some issues srinu.
it won't be missed how much cruel it is.

590
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,653
It's better to plan Blasts if you want to happen it fast.

591
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:02,544
So many people will die.

592
02:01:10,755 --> 02:01:12,482
Government won't get stable with that issue.

593
02:01:19,688 --> 02:01:27,949
Apply break once.. Bike repair. 
How are you.? Good.

594
02:01:31,589 --> 02:01:33,487
one minute give me that bike

595

02:02:07,759 --> 02:02:12,055

601
02:02:14,027 --> 02:02:19,550
At last bose is getting ready for marriage.
i can't believe this.

602
02:02:26,594 --> 02:02:31,117
Hi bro. Bose i heard that you're going to get married soon.

So many kids,mothers and people died, what they have done.

610
02:08:00,767 --> 02:08:10,033
is this not enough for you..? when this govt will wakeup.?
how many we have to lose our people.?

611
02:08:15,434 --> 02:08:21,030
We'll go to school eat fast.
BOSE, i'm here to take care of him.

612
02:08:21,935 --> 02:08:26,730
i'll send him school. you go and take care of your work.

613
02:08:42,101 --> 02:08:50,727
What is this..? i'm fine.
he is there for me.

614
02:08:56,436 --> 02:09:01,732
satpal.. vehicles are ready for delivery. come..

615
02:09:04,603 --> 02:09:12,729
those two footages... officers,Any clues..?
No sir..!

616
02:09:23,537 --> 02:09:27,098
Khan., Trace out them who they are. Yes sir.

617
02:09:41,171 --> 02:09:48,898
Here is Train.Give it to me.
was it good..?

618
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:02,064
come out once.

619
02:10:28,873 --> 02:10:36,829
We found it in Dundigal Railway station.we got report that it was suicide in our primary investigation.

620
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:52,030
No sir, It's wrong to conclude that it was terrorist act.

621
02:10:53,041 --> 02:10:58,041
It's completly different way of attack.
the wepons used in this attack was strange.They are local.

622
02:11:00,777 --> 02:11:02,506
i kept an eye on people new to this city.

623
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
This is the attack which was planned here.

624
02:11:09,113 --> 02:11:11,409
There is some conspiracy. I suspect there may be more serial blasts.

625
02:11:11,847 --> 02:11:15,012
An early strong investigation is needed.
we've to stop what are going to happen.

626
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
It's not good to take decissions in anger Mr.Chandrasekhar.

627
02:11:19,915 --> 02:11:26,075
Listen to me sir, stop it. Doubting like regular police is not good in this type of sensitive cases.

628
02:11:27,083 --> 02:11:32,181
Public will get paniced if we relese this news without proofs.
Sir please sir, Trust me sir.

629
02:11:33,817 --> 02:11:40,080
MR.Chandrasekhar it's not good to take personal openions in this type of situations. We may get problem's from Govt.

630
02:11:41,053 --> 02:11:44,019
Just leave that here.
This is an order.

631
02:11:48,786 --> 02:11:56,012
It's hard to belive that Bose was dead.
i didn't understood why he did like that.

632
02:12:03,454 --> 02:12:11,020
I'm fighting from 25 years to do 
this type of things. i'm wrong.

633
02:12:13,022 --> 02:12:17,017
Uncle and I've fixed a match for you,
I thought police uniform is enough to serve people.

634
02:12:19,490 --> 02:12:23,913
One kind heart for responding people's eye drops is enough.

635
02:12:28,124 --> 02:12:31,590
i'm afriad because something may happen to you.

636
02:12:32,125 --> 02:12:36,023
But, i didn't noticed that it was you Weapon and dream.

637
02:12:38,026 --> 02:12:46,590
So many people lost their lives in recent blasts.
i suspect a big crosperacy behind this.

638
02:12:47,993 --> 02:12:53,460
Threats and pressure on me to stop investigation.
they are ready to kill me if i won't stop it.

639
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I don't care what will happen. But blast may happen again.
i'm fearing about how many people die if it happens.

640
02:13:04,328 --> 02:13:13,684
So many people come's to Janatha Garage for help.
This police lost and came for help to JANATHA GARAGE.

641
02:13:15,896 --> 02:13:21,419
it's not wrong if JANATHA GARAGE lost and 
stand infront of you for help.

642
02:13:21,997 --> 02:13:27,491
But if you do so, Public and goodness is lost.

643
02:13:28,531 --> 02:13:35,061
They won't go any where. Till now 
we are support for your department.

644
02:13:36,465 --> 02:13:41,058
But if this courage was scared.,
No one will live who was the reason behaind it.

645
02:13:42,599 --> 02:13:46,027
We kept serveillance on people who are new to city.

646
02:13:48,132 --> 02:13:51,189
but they are the one who didn't traced yet.

647
02:13:51,833 --> 02:13:54,692
We didn't find where they are till now.

648
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:06,928
Little more zoom in..!

649
02:14:09,134 --> 02:14:11,430

02:15:24,803 --> 02:15:28,769
Luckyly the don't know about us.
But it's better to be carefull.

654
02:15:34,070 --> 02:15:37,063
Janatha Garage people killed people who came fro UP.

655

The didn't know about us.But i'm scared that they will 
come in anytime.

656
02:15:43,005 --> 02:15:45,402
It's better to move from here.

657
02:16:05,805 --> 02:16:09,101
See see,like this...

658
02:16:22,205 --> 02:16:26,032
Bose didn't committed suicide.

666
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,767

He's my one and only son. do you want me to lose him.

We don't need to tell him about losing to him.

He lost his parents, and Gaurdian (uncle) and loved girl.

690
02:22:22,857 --> 02:22:28,653
it's not correct to talk to him about losing.
