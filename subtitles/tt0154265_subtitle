1
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,713
MrD.P.

2
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,242
"Please, sir. Come"

3
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,988
There was a call from Delhi.
- Who was it?

4
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,599
He didn't disclose his name.
He asked me to tell you...

5
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,692
that Mr X had called.
_ All right

6
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,006
He's coming to Bombay tonight
and wants to see you

7
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,209
Book a room for him
at Hotel lnternational

8
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:35,279
"Book the room in my name
_ Those gentleman are in there, sir"

9
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,173
So they are here?

10
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,011
Send Zafarullah

11
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,587
Wait till we open!
We aren't selling pumpkins here

12
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,748
Wait till we open up

13
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,687
Make sure the accounts are okay.
Our department mustn't go wrong

14
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,364
Mr D.P. wants you.
- The creditors are there...?

15
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,730
I thought I was the only one
you owed money to

16
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:04,643
It's a small market.
You can't hide things forever

17
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,979
The two of you together
lent him 2.5 million

18
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:12,243
He owes 2.5 million to me alone
- 2.5 and 2.5 makes it 5 million

19
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,476
"1 million he owes me,
which makes it 6 million"

20
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,246
"How much does he owe you, Shivcharan?
_ Now that it's out in the open..."

21
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,983
why must I hide it?
He owes me 2 million!

22
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,988
2 million...?
That makes it 8 million in all!

23
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,426
"What do you intend to do,
Mr Durga Prasad?"

24
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,997
Why're you quiet?
Say something

25
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,766
"Call from ltaly, sir"

26
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,521
"You borrowed money from me under
the pretext of buying ships, D.P"'

27
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,365
"It's six months now,
and I haven't seen any ship"

28
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,726
I want to know how
my money is secure?

29
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,971
And how is our money secure?

30
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,309
There's only one security for
your money. My reputation

31
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,178
"D.P. Shipping is worth 800 million,
not just 8 million"

32
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,979
"lf you don't trust me,
take your money and get lost"

33
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,388
Settle their accounts.
_ I've already brought the cheque book

34
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,727
I had warned you. It was
against your grain...

35
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,403
to borrow from such petty people
_ Old fossil! Who's petty?

36
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,738
"You're taking offense!
This is no petty business, sir"

37
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,636
We're into shipping.
With 2.5 million...

38
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,513
all we can buy is a horn
for the ship

39
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,584
"Am I right, sir?"

40
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,760
"Call from Japan, sir"

41
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,291
Mehra...? Go on.
Have you received my quotation?

42
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,497
Place an order for a ship
in Japan itself

43
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,635
When will I get the first ship?
In 3 months?

44
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,469
I've deposited 30 million
with the Reserve Bank

45
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,971
You can withdraw the money there

46
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,978
Just don't worry about money.
The show must go on

47
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,254
"You guys are still here?
_ Follow me, please.."'

48
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,657
"let's settle your interest.
_ One moment, Khan saheb"

49
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,526
"D. P., you misunderstand us.
_ We didn't come for the money"

50
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,998
We came only for a reassurance

51
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,670
"Large businesses are carried out
on a large scale, Mr Thadani"

52
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,402
Things take time.
We have to possess the courage

53
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,283
"Could you excuse us, please?
_ Certainly"

54
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,715
We simply misunderstood things

55
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,474
Mail this

56
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,645
Right now
_ Very well

57
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,992
"How much money do we have
in the bank, Zafarullah?"

58
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,700
Nothing.

59
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:57,274
We have overdrawn half a million.
The bank manager has served a notice

60
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,942
And what if the creditors had
agreed to accept cheques?

61
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:07,443
"Barking dogs, sir.
They're scared of people who bite"

62
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,712
"The authoritative tone
you use, well.."'

63
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,958
How are the shares selling?
_ Selling...?

64
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:22,962
No dearth of suckers. They're making
a beeline for our shares

65
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,566
"Con as many people as you can,
in the quickest time possible"

66
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,965
We will disappaer after that

67
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,707
"Sir, do take care of this poor man"

68
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:38,415
Lest you disappear...
and I find myself in a twirl!

69
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,630
You play it
_ Go on. Not my cup of tea

70
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:57,431
"You have a nice voice, Dharam.
Join my band. You'll be famous"

71
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,269
"I'm hiding my real name, Braganza.
- From whom?"

72
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,036
>From her

73
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,175
So what happened at the office?

74
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,355
Are you a secret service officer?
_ Why?

75
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,950
You seem to be more interested
in my office than me

76
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,352
"Don't be angry, dear.
Finish your tea"

77
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,958
"You've got to visit a friend again?
_ Well, that's true"

78
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,369
Exactly at eight.
- Give or take five or ten minutes

79
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,635
_ Why do you get offended?
So go away. Who's stopping you?

80
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:52,590
"You will come, if you're my boyfriend.
Or else, I won't talk to you"

81
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,994
Is that all...? I'll call my friend
and tell him to go to hell

82
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:02,999
"I'm going to enjoy the seventh heaven
today... with my darling, Sapna"

83
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,998
And open your mouth

84
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,258
"Rajesh, will you stand in
for me for duty tonight?"

85
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,422
"I'm held up somewhere.
_ Aren't really held up, are you?"

86
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,587
No. I'm laying a trap for Durga Prasad

87
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,033
"Watch your step, sir.
Lest you fall in the trap"

88
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,263
No sweat

89
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,054
It's so terribly hot...
open the windows. Go on

90
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,788
It's really hot. Why don't you guys
take off your jackets...?

91
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,994
I'm soaked.
_ Take off your coat

92
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,322
It's so hot

93
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,304
You work in D.P"s office?
- Yes

94
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,610
I want to buy shares of the company.
Could you please help me?

95
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,044
Go to the third floor and
meet Mr Zafarullah Khan

96
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,716
Thanks

97
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,415
That's a beautiful color

98
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,218
Are you following me?
_ You have been drawing me

99
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,493
Don't you see? You have me
all tied up in knots

100
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,044
"l told you, we ought to have
bought the tickets earlier"

101
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,680
"l have an extra ticket,
if you wish"

102
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,982
"Smart guy. You bought that
extra ticket for me, didn't you?"

103
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,387
You're smart too. You unravel
the secrets of the heart

104
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,001
There's a Russian
ballet troupe in town.

105
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,662
It's said to be fantastic
I've bought tickets for you too

106
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,704
Tonight...? I've got to
meet a friend tonight

107
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,237
I want to say something
to you today

108
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,974
Go ahead today and say it today

109
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,648
Maybe later

110
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,468
"Your guests are waiting for you.
Where are you hiding, Sapna?"

111
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,340
When will you come out?
After I have left?

112
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:49,285
"When you leave...
I will miss you"""

113
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:58,258
"When you leave...
I will miss you"""

114
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,137
"To placate my heart,
show me a way"""

115
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,298
"Give me a picture of yours
before you leave"""

116
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:44,732
I have a dream

117
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:51,014
Like a rose among thorns

118
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:57,612
I have seen a masked face

119
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:02,392
"l dream, I have seen"

120
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,966
Tell me how my dream will end

121
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:15,972
"Give me a picture of yours
before you leave"""

122
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:51,337
Before I turn helpless...

123
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,611
and drift away from you

124
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:04,149
Before I am shattered...

125
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,292
before I turn helpless

126
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:15,962
"Tell me what destiny
holds for me"""

127
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:22,167
"Give me a picture of yours
before you leave"""

128
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,729
There are cheats

129
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:57,007
"Dark secrets they hold
in their hearts"""

130
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,609
"They have ways of
playing with you"""

131
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,281
They are cheats

132
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:16,117
"Give me a promise
before you leave.."""'

133
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,957
"give me a picture of yours
before you leave"""

134
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:27,968
"When you go away,
I will miss you"""

135
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,460
"You checked this pocket, Sapna.
Not the one behind"

136
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,931
"The story begins here, all right.
But it doesn't end"

137
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,542
It takes a twist

138
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,416
The police bring handcuffs.
Not engagement rings

139
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,617
I'll fetch handcuffs too.
_ So bring that first

140
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,356
Why keep up the pretense?

141
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,951
Handcuffs I bring aren't
meant for these hands

142
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,293
But you can certainly
lead me to him

143
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,135
Durga Prasad. D.P.

144
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,632
"He keeps no secrets from
his secretary, I'm told"

145
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,449
"lnspector, this is my house"

146
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,651
"lf you want information
about my office,.."'

147
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,114
please call on me there

148
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,583
Durga Prasad owns a shipping company
which does not possess a single ship

149
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,562
The poor have put together every
penny to buy shares worth millions

150
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,396
And he has swallowed
all their money

151
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,334
D.P. is involved in several
other illegal businesses

152
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,603
He's an influential man who enjoys
the protection of big guns...

153
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,007
it isn't easy to catch him.
An ordinary police inspector has...

154
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,411
been entrusted with the task of
getting evidence against D.P.

155
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,017
And you must've thought
I'm an ingrate...

156
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,586
and tried to exploit me

157
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,692
"lnspector Dharam Dev,
I have respect for my boss"

158
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,558
I have nothing against him.
Please leave my house

159
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,032
Inspector Dharam Dev
will leave your house

160
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,301
Forever.

161
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,477
But Dharam will never be
able to leave your life

162
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,580
Will you meet him tomorrow evening?
- No

163
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,376
He'll wait for you

164
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,489
"Take it for granted that you've
got a loan of 4 million, Durga"

165
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,163
I'll get you all
the licences too

166
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,333
But I won't settle for a 5 per cent
commission this time

167
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,001
Well...?
_ 10 per cent

168
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,006
That's too much.
Don't be unreasonable

169
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:30,580
"Business is bad nowadays, my friend.
And I've got to provide for my family"

170
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,493
I can't protest when
you talk about your family

171
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,426
Let's shake hands

172
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:46,562
Haven't you brought your wife?
- I want to have fun this time

173
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:51,539
But it's a shame that despite
having friends like you...

174
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,305
I'm so lonely on evenings like this.
_ Really? Wait till I make a call

175
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,708
No. I'm only kidding

176
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:02,649
"By the way, you had a
beautiful secretary, didn't you?"

177
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,650
I still do

178
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,988
"You aren't involved with her, are you?
- No"'

179
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,590
But I could set her up for you.
_ That's something

180
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:21,130
Give me a share for hundred rupees.
- When hundred can be two hundred...

181
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,707
five hundred could be a grand!

182
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,502
So give me three shares.
- Good. It'll make six

183
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,016
"Think about it. In a couple of years,
the value multiplies to double!"

184
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:37,483
This is fantastic! It's up for grabs.
Go for it!

185
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,718
"Salutations, lady.
How many shares do you want to buy?"

186
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,720
I've already bought them.
I've come to return them

187
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:53,197
God forbid! You want to sell the
shares when the prices are increasing!

188
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,470
My daughter has her exams and I don't
have money for her admission

189
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,444
I don't want any profit.
Please have my money refunded

190
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,974
"Shares can't be taken back, lady
_ Please do something.."'

191
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,378
I'm a poor widow.
Please have mercy on me

192
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,988
Widow...? So come here...

193
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,229
You're young and beautiful...
and a widow at that!

194
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:25,333
"On a personal level,
I will help you"

195
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,996
Let me have your address.
Which lane...?

196
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,206
"Marina Building, Nagpada"

197
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,673
Khan saheb...
_ Coming

198
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,007
Don't worry. I'll come over

199
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,011
Sapna! What are you doing here?

200
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:48,018
"l want some advise, Khan saheb.
- Sure. Go ahead"

201
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:54,021
I have some money. Since profits
are assured...

202
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,527
why mustn't I buy some
shares in our own company?

203
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:03,367
"Thank the Lord that you have
some money, my dear girl"

204
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,237
Put that money away
in a bank

205
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,108
The guys buying shares in this
company are going to be ruined

206
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,144
A hundred rupee share

207
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,483
They won't get a penny back

208
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,648
I must leave now.
Meet me later...

209
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,985
and I'll tell you where to
invest your money

210
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,332
The poor have put every penny together
to buy shares of this company

211
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,994
And that man has swallowed
all their money

212
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,235
"My promise, I must keep"

213
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:47,007
"l must keep my promise,
I must go.."""'

214
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:54,015
"My promise, I must keep"

215
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,623
Listen...
- Yes?

216
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,562
Come on inside. I've got something
important to discuss with you.

217
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:10,135
You talk to her everyday. Give me
an opportunity to serve you today

218
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,971
"Come...
_ Now listen, wives"

219
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,974
The two of you can sit down
and have a chat today

220
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,240
I'm in a hurry

221
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:25,986
He seems a changed man today.
_ He used a perfume today

222
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,483
For the second time in my life.
- When was the first?

223
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,526
When he married you

224
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,988
I think he has found another woman.

225
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,494
"Since you insist, I'll
keep the money as a loan"

226
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:47,167
"lf you take me for your own,
you mustn't return the money"

227
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,006
Well...?

228
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,750
"l mean, only the one who is slain,
knows what he's going through"

229
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,016
"You mean, you're a widower?"

230
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:11,636
I'm worse off. I have two wives...
but I still thirst for love

231
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,104
Khan saheb...
- Listen to me!

232
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:20,502
"Whenever I see a beautiful woman,
I lose control"

233
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,374
You haven't introduced me to
my child... where is she?

234
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,979
"Salma...
_ Yes, mother?"

235
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,316
Pay your respects to uncle

236
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,123
Salutations

237
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,464
Salutations...

238
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,538
What happened?

239
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,952
"This is my daughter, Salma.
She's studying to be a nurse"

240
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,115
Praised be the Lord!

241
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,950
The mother is cupid...
and the daughter's an arrow

242
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,290
What luck!

243
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,966
"ls there any more work, sir?
_ Yes, Sapna"

244
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:31,980
Here are some confidential files.
Don't let them remain outside

245
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,214
"Should they fall in wrong hands,
they could cause great trouble"

246
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,511
Put them away in the safe

247
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,995
"You trust me a lot, sir.
_ undoubtedly"

248
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:51,166
So why do you hide Mr X from me?
_ I don't. He prefers to remain hidden

249
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,667
Why?

250
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:57,737
"As you know, we have to do strange
things to make money nowadays"

251
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,270
I also have to tie up
with shady characters

252
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,344
Mr X is one of them.
His real name is Jagmohan

253
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,941
A very useful man in Delhi

254
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,687
Why don't you meet him?
- l...?

255
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,554
I was about to ask you to take
this important letter to him

256
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,499
I can't ask anyone else to carry it.
Deliver it to him on your way

257
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,137
D.P. sent you to me...?

258
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,403
Sit down.
I'll join you soon

259
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,643
Help yourself to a cold drink.
You'll find it in the fridge

260
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,976
I...
- Don't be formal

261
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,987
"Get me a Limca, if not one
for yourself"

262
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,670
Where could D.P. be?
- I don't know

263
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,329
He has left the office

264
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,605
"Sorry to bother you, could you
bring my drink here please?"

265
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,949
What a wrong place to
put the mirror in.

266
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,151
"Shut the door,
and you can't see anything"'

267
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,493
What a refreshing drink.
Try a sip...

268
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,963
No thank you. Here's the envelope.
I'm in a hurry

269
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,969
Hurry...? You're doing
an injustice to me

270
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:45,980
I've been awaiting you since yesterday
_ Did you know I was coming over?

271
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:51,382
"Hasn't D.P. told you,
I'm an old admirer of yours?"

272
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,448
D.P. asked me to give you
this envelope. That's all

273
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,720
Even a peon could have
fetched this envelope

274
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,731
Out of my way!
- What airs!

275
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:10,204
"Now look, miss. Your boss
lives at my mercy"

276
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,011
"To keep him in good spirits,
it's necessary to keep me happy"

277
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,742
Is this your idea
or is it D.P"s?

278
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,708
We agree on most of our ideas

279
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,015
Stop putting on these airs.
I'll ask D.P. to give you a promotion

280
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,456
"She's punishing me for hurting
her feelings, Braganza"

281
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:37,634
But I haven't really betrayed her.
She will come...

282
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,369
sooner or later.
And I will wait for her

283
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,203
The sweet fruit of waiting...
there she comes

284
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,993
You're still here?
_ Didn't I say I'd wait?

285
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,692
I wasn't supposed to come today.
_ But you did

286
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,000
What do you want to know
about Durga Prasad

287
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,601
Nothing.
_ Nothing?

288
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,334
"lf I have to pay with the
relationship I share with you,.."'

289
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:24,572
I don't want to know anything.
_ But I want to tell you everything

290
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,234
Here you are

291
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,439
That safe...?
How do you open it?

292
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,045
The combination is...

293
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,716
"Where to, mister? You aren't
allowed inside in the night"

294
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:14,328
Security! Where did that man go?
_ Which man? I saw nobody

295
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,990
He came in right now

296
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,721
He must be inside.
Get him!

297
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,509
This is the first time a woman
has attended to this house

298
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:50,359
What's that in your hands?
_ That which I wanted. Durga Prasad

299
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,153
These papers will be
a handcuff for him

300
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,025
I've done what you wanted of me.
I must leave now

301
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,429
"Leave, and the house will
be filthy again"

302
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,699
So hire a maid-servant.
- I'll hire two

303
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,368
Provided you take the responsibility
of handling them

304
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,638
I don't trust policemen.
_ I'll quit the services

305
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,714
I hate jokes.
_ Do you like diamonds?

306
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,221
"Wear it, if you like it"

307
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:29,262
I'll take it now and wear it
when I feel like it

308
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,517
"lnspector Dharam Dev, there has
been a theft in my office"

309
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,389
Go and lodge a police complaint.
_ lt'll take things too far

310
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,997
It isn't right to discuss such
things in police stations

311
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:48,401
"l know, everything is up for
sale in the world you live"

312
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:54,178
But I also know that lnspector
Dharam Dev is not one of them

313
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:58,181
"lnspector Dharam Dev,
my name is Durga Prasad"

314
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,091
They call me D.P.

315
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,292
You can either be a friend of D.P.
or an enemy

316
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,555
There're no relations midway

317
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:11,133
"The name is Dharam Dev,
you can call me D.D"'

318
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,396
But we can't ever be friends

319
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,964
Think it over.
Enmity could cost you dearly

320
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:23,211
Tough luck. I joined the police force
so I pay heavily

321
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,380
I'm glad you don't have
any wife and kids

322
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,379
Or I'd have sympathised with them

323
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,267
"Rajesh, guess what I have in my fist?"

324
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,575
I have proof that will send him
straight to prison

325
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,002
"I'm coming over, in case
you're going to be there"

326
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,613
I'll need your help
to prepare a case

327
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,706
"Come over, sir. I'm very much here"

328
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,650
"lnspector Dharam Dev, for being drunk
on duty and causing an accident.."'

329
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:48,220
you are sentenced to two years
of rigorous imprisonment

330
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,969
How did a two-year term
get over in just six months?

331
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,169
You have well-wishers
in the police force

332
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,298
Although they couldn't prove
your innocence...

333
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,237
they do know the truth

334
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,977
So you are an lnspector now?
- Yes...

335
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:48,646
I have followed in your footsteps.
_ Don't do that. It'll take you...

336
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:53,685
right inside the prison.
_ They're doing their best...

337
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,652
to take you back in the force.
- Soon?

338
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,995
As soon as they forget
that I'm a disgraced man?

339
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,989
People in the department
are very embarrassed

340
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,258
They need an excuse to summon
you back in the department

341
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,166
I must've lost my house?
- No.

342
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:17,541
The rent is being paid every month
_ So what other favours have you done?

343
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,006
"Don't call this a favour, please"

344
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:32,357
Will D.P. be in his office right now?
_ Your house has been locked up

345
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,021
Let's go to my house first.
Freshen up and I'll drop you later

346
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,765
"Drop me at D.P"s office.
_ Now look, you.."'

347
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,367
"Else, I'll go on my own.
_ Get in the jeep"

348
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,336
To D.P"s office

349
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,257
You'll need the money.
Treat it as a loan

350
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,204
No

351
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,014
Just one bullet. It can do no harm
without a pistol

352
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,687
Treat this is a loan too

353
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,796
Whom do you want to see?

354
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,442
"I'm back, D.P.
To ruin your sleep"

355
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:07,321
See this? It's a bullet

356
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,260
It has your name
written on it

357
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,994
"lt'll remain near my heart,
till I lodge it in yours"

358
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,349
Later

359
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,418
Mala...?

360
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,453
I've got to meet you

361
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,431
Afternoon. After he goes to sleep
_ My place?

362
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,297
"He's okay, he's having his breakfast"

363
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,976
"Yes, he's taking his medicines.
Very well, I'll tell him"

364
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,314
Who was it?
- The doctor

365
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,980
Hasn't Roshi woken up?
- Woken...?

366
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,255
"She'll ask for breakfast,
when we've had our lunch"

367
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,260
She came in at 4 this morning.
_ Why don't you reason with her?

368
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,991
"lf I do, I'll be called a stepmother"'

369
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,600
"Your darling daughter, after all.
Go ahead and pamper her"

370
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,016
Deal cards for me too

371
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,421
"Jingle, Roshi wants to gamble"

372
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,623
"Why not?
_ The club has boycotted you, Roshi"

373
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,694
Know how much you've lost?
60000

374
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,233
"Till you repay the debt,
you won't be allowed to gamble"

375
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,578
Your father's a rich man.
It's no big deal. Just pay up

376
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:34,396
"One day you will fall, Roshi.
And you will be tainted for life"

377
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,331
Which is why I ask you
to stop following me

378
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,227
I'm not your types

379
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,335
"You can be my types, Roshi.
Just give up these vices"

380
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,677
Give up these vices...?
So what will remain then?

381
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:55,751
"Roshi, you will have enough.
I'll make a new person out of you"

382
00:45:56,353 --> 00:46:00,483
I don't want to be a new person.
_ I'll come in uniform someday...

383
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:05,628
and handcuff all those
bastards who sell narcotics...

384
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,124
and spoil the younger generation

385
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,198
"Will you take me away too?
_ You, I'll take away right now"

386
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,232
Let me go!
- You'll crash somewhere in this state

387
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,968
So what will you lose?
_ You're going to lose

388
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,238
Get in. I'll drop you home

389
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,393
"Eat something.
_ There's a blot on my name, Sapna"

390
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:44,395
I can't wash it away until I have
tainted Durga Prasad with it

391
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,999
"l used to work for him earlier,
so I could earn a living"

392
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,707
But now I work for him
so I can destroy him

393
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,607
A foreigner named John is leaving
for Switzerland tomorrow

394
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:08,454
"He won't be searched, but his bag
will be stuffed with foreign currency"

395
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:13,360
It's D.P"s money. This is how he has
siphoned off all the money abroad

396
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,982
I want to meet that gentleman

397
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,991
Arrest him

398
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,767
Come on

399
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,008
What you did was wrong!

400
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,101
Wasn't John Benjamin a dubious guy?
_ All right

401
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,210
Wasn't he carrying foreign currency?
_ All right

402
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,940
Wasn't he into illegal things...
_ I agree...

403
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,677
He was carrying D.P"s money!
_ We don't have any evidence on that

404
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,180
You will keep looking for evidence
and he will flee the country

405
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,346
"l assure you, we will not
let him run away!"

406
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,152
"Till such time as you are reinstated,
leave all this to us"

407
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:22,958
"Or you will do something illegal.
_ You are bound by legalities, not me"

408
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,691
And D.P. is my enemy

409
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,376
John Benjamin was caught.
He was carrying foreign currency

410
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,704
Won't you bail him out?
- What rubbish!

411
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,140
"Stop following me, or I'll
have you arrested"

412
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:45,311
All that is old hat.
Wait and watch.

413
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,461
I'll have to personally leave for
Switzerland. In a day or two

414
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,391
"Why don't you understand, darling?
It could result in heavy losses"

415
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,502
I'll try and return
as soon as possible

416
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,335
Book a seat for me
on tonight's flight

417
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,969
"I'm sorry, Mr Durga Prasad.
You can't leave tonight"

418
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,570
"Why not?
_ You owe taxes in excess of 600,000"

419
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,103
"What's 600,000? I'll have it
paid tomorrow"

420
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,509
So you may leave tomorrow.
_ My office is here...

421
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,151
No point in arguing.
You can't leave today

422
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,217
Here's your ticket.
_ My passport

423
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,723
Your passport remains with us.
The moment you pay your taxes...

424
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,459
it'll be returned to you

425
00:49:56,626 --> 00:50:00,619
Why was my passport snatched away?
_ There are greater dangers ahead

426
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,263
Clean out the office. You can
expect a visit from the cops

427
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,268
And let's act as if we don't
know each other for a few days

428
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,674
"Did you send for me, sir?
_ Yes, Khansaheb.."'

429
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,443
"l want to be left alone
with him, Sapna"

430
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,486
Shut the door and come over

431
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,595
"Khan saheb, difficult days ahead"

432
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,759
Here are some important files.
Take good care of them

433
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,568
Go on leave

434
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:46,366
"You're ill, all right?
_ I'm ill, of course"'

435
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:51,037
I suffer from cholera.
>From Malaria

436
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,041
Missus! Attend to me immediately!

437
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,046
"ls that okay, sir?
_ Absolutely"

438
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,744
Don't worry

439
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,991
"Those papers are more precious
than my life, missus"

440
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,993
Take good care of them.
Here are the keys. Good bye

441
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,734
Where to...?
You said you were on leave.

442
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,732
Let's play hide_n_seek.

443
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,445
You're a grown up woman now.
And I'm stricken with Malaria

444
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,004
I'm going to the hospital

445
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,610
"Salma, what's the programme
for this evening?"

446
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,010
"Anything. _ In which case, let's.."'

447
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,019
Where can I find Salma?

448
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:44,023
"uncle, aren't you overdoing your
rounds to the hospital nowadays?"

449
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:49,531
I feel giddy nowadays.
I come for a cure

450
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,037
Who was that boy?
- Aslam?

451
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,301
He works with me.
_ Why does he?

452
00:51:55,512 --> 00:52:00,575
"l mean, I don't like to see you
mingling with strangers"

453
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,214
"You don't like it?
_ I mean, you won't understand it"

454
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:09,391
Youngsters nowadays treat women
like playthings

455
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:13,656
They play with them and dump them.
To understand women...

456
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:18,991
"one needs the experience.
Experience, that comes with age"

457
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,000
"Dear uncle!
_ uncle, my foot!"

458
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,174
"Forget uncle, just call me ""dear"
"- Dear?"

459
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,173
Something similar...

460
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:35,610
Get home early in the evening.
Your mother worries about you

461
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,681
She could contact T.B...

462
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,024
Strange old man. Who's he?
_ Strange man

463
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,295
He was angling for mother earlier.
And he's now trying to woo me

464
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,736
"Well...?
_ Nothing here, sir"

465
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,479
"lf I'm not needed around here,
may I go out for a while?"

466
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,308
Nobody leaves till the search
is in progress

467
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,993
You...?
- Wait and watch the fun

468
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:26,994
We found nothing in his office
to implicate D.P.

469
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,596
Which means he has hidden away
the evidence elswhere

470
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,612
It's okay if you can't kill him.

471
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,354
"But break his limbs, so he
can never walk around again"

472
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,019
Okay?
_ That's just what we'll do

473
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,363
Listen... I'm not through

474
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,535
He carries in his pocket
something he's arrogant about

475
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:08,309
Near his heart... a bullet
I want it

476
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,003
What's a bullet?
_ Don't you know?

477
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,973
"Have you ever seen a pistol?
_ Sure, I have"

478
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,380
The slug in a pistol is a bullet

479
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,151
I'll wait for news at Golden Bar
till midnight

480
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,426
One of you will deliver
that bullet to me

481
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,262
It'll tell me that the mission
has been accomplished

482
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,397
Where did you get that
imported cigarette from?

483
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:43,503
I bought it.
- But I smoke this lndian brand

484
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,012
This is what you smoked earlier.
- Now I smoke this

485
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,512
All right

486
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,644
One hates being a burden on others

487
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,658
"Times have changed, Dharam.
You will start earning soon.."'

488
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,588
"and I will enjoy it. I'm earning
today, so you must enjoy it"

489
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:38,394
You consider yourself a burden today.
I might be a burden tomorrow

490
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,131
A new line of thought...
I'll think it over

491
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,214
Look after yourself.
D.P"s seething with rage

492
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,674
That's because he can
see his imminent death

493
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,447
Hurry up

494
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:39,676
"For your entertainment, we
present a special item today"

495
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:28,146
"Look, what is this...?"

496
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:32,021
"it has your name
written on it"""

497
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:59,314
"Blissfully ignorant, you are.
Getting drunk too"""

498
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:03,514
"One day, this bullet
will pierce your heart"""

499
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:17,669
"Now watch the fun, my friend.."'

500
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:21,532
"Look, what is this?"

501
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:26,011
It's a cure for your heart

502
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,016
It bears your name

503
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:56,035
"This is the thing
you are scared of"""

504
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:00,413
"l look for you, and you
look for this"""

505
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,592
"Look, what is this...?"

506
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,003
You know what it is

507
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:27,340
It bears your name

508
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,367
"Remember this much,
O crazy one.."""'

509
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,543
you are a moth

510
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,644
"You will burn in the fires
you have yourself started"""

511
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,591
Watch the fun...

512
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,001
What is this...?

513
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,998
"ls it a reward?
Or is it a punishment?"""

514
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:35,007
It bears your name too

515
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,983
"Mala, I need money.
- How much?"

516
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,243
"600,000. A million, if possible"

517
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:25,125
"Which means, I'd have married a pauper
if I had decided to marry you"

518
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:30,557
The old man isn't dead either. You
said he's ailing from every disease

519
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,134
That he'd leave millions to you

520
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:37,400
What we want and what happens
are two different things

521
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,999
"Even if the old fossil dies,
what will we get?"

522
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,168
He'll leave all his money
to his daughter

523
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,337
To hell with his money

524
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:50,008
I've stashed away over 10 million
in Switzerland. It's all yours

525
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:55,246
My problem is that the guy I had
appointed to look after things...

526
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:59,019
is in police custody.
If I don't reach there immediately...

527
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,229
I might lose the money.

528
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,964
"Because of Dharam Dev,
everyone suspects me here"

529
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,626
"unless I pay my taxes,
they won't let me go"

530
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:13,635
"600,000 is all I need.
It's chicken-feed for the old man"

531
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,473
"That's okay, but he's
a tight-fisted man"

532
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:24,647
"lf he discovers his money has
disappeared, it'll kill him"

533
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,985
Can't you bring him around...?
Shame on this beauty of yours

534
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,520
So show me a way.
_ That's like my girl

535
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:41,663
"Come, let's make love and make
some plans which will.."'

536
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,996
eliminate Roshi from your way
and Dharam from mine

537
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:59,480
Roshi is not back yet
- Roshi indeed!

538
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:04,356
You'll die for her.
_ She's the only child I have

539
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:10,632
"How am I to blame,
if I don't have a child?"

540
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,959
Why don't you take
Roshi for your own child?

541
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,965
I will. I promise.
But you will have to help me

542
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:23,177
How?
_ The scolding she gets from me...

543
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:27,544
"she must get from you.
I'll pamper her, like you do"

544
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:31,483
She'll take to me gradually
and I'll reform her

545
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,980
All right. Let her return today

546
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,275
Is this any time to come home?

547
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,946
"Those who live by the clock,
forget what life is, daddy"

548
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,644
And when they realise
what life is...

549
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:11,350
they're heart_patients...
Iike you are

550
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:15,357
Such insolence!
_ And what is good manners?

551
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,956
To speak lies as if
it were the truth?

552
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:26,135
"You mustn't be so angry, daddy.
You mustn't be up at this hour"

553
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:33,142
"You mustn't spoil your sleep,
trying to reform a spoilt daughter"

554
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:42,981
You should have slapped me when
I smoked my first cigarette

555
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:53,258
I was only eleven. But you didn't
even have the time to look at me

556
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:59,333
You ought to have slapped me
when I had my first boyfriend

557
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:03,945
I was only 14. But you had
no time for me

558
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:09,274
You ought to have slapped me
when I first lost a gamble

559
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:13,353
"l was only 15, but you
didn't have time for me"

560
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:18,550
You ought to have slapped me
when I took the first narcotic pill

561
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:22,954
"The first time I smoked pot,
I was only 16"

562
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,960
But you had no time for me
even then

563
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:39,573
I'm 19 today. Thousands of joints
flow in my blood_stream

564
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,644
Boyfriends have come and gone

565
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,977
I've had any number
of narcotics

566
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:52,522
"I've lost 60,000 in gambling.
I still owe the money"

567
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,658
And you find the time
to slap me today

568
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,929
You have atleast paid
attention to me

569
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:12,211
"That's not true, Roshi!
I've never loved anything except you"

570
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:15,940
You have never loved anyone
or anything except money

571
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:19,550
I spent my childhood
craving for love

572
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,947
And you lusted for money
all your life

573
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:26,959
"And you think of me today,
because you see death ahead?"

574
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,420
Because you have no other heir?

575
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:33,366
But I hate your wealth as much
as I hate my own life!

576
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:38,565
"ln just a year after you're dead,
I'll squander away all this wealth!"

577
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,306
Because this money of yours
has ruined my life!

578
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:33,351
Do not say things...

579
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:39,027
that lie in the heart

580
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:49,034
In these things...

581
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:54,039
there is no substance

582
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:33,010
This is how I lead it

583
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:52,037
"Life is a poison
I am drinking"""

584
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:59,305
"ln slumber, I have
spent days and nights"""

585
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,984
After I am drunk...

586
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:06,986
I'm reminded...

587
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:13,394
"of all those things
I had forgotten"""

588
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:09,582
A spell is being cast...

589
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,561
Flames leap in my body...

590
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:32,337
they engulf my heart

591
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:34,403
Behind my eyes...

592
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:39,275
Iie hidden many a secret

593
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,017
After I'm drunk...

594
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:47,348
I'm reminded...

595
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:53,687
of things I had forgotten

596
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,123
Your daddy was very severe
on you today

597
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,532
But every word you said to him
was true

598
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:45,507
He's such a rich man. And his wife
and daughter crave for every penny

599
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,542
"Have one.
Come on, don't be shy"

600
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,954
How much money have you
lost in gambling?

601
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,694
60000
_ You want that money?

602
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:14,570
Where will you get it from?
_ Do you want it?

603
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:17,969
"You can have even more
_ Yes, I want it"

604
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:25,150
I need some money too.
And we can help each other

605
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,648
"How?
_ Give me a smile, I'll tell you"

606
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:35,997
Let's enact a drama to relieve
your dad's safe of some money

607
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:42,500
Zafarullah Khan has the evidence
the police are looking for

608
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,664
And why not?
_ What nonsense are you talking?

609
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:51,011
"Salma's like your daughter.
_ But she's your daughter, lady"

610
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:55,009
She's the one who excites me.
She's my heart-throb!

611
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,014
She'll rule the roost!
_ Oh yes...

612
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,278
"she'll rule the roost,
and I'll starve"

613
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,956
You must put up with it
for your daughter's happiness

614
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,618
"A day or two of difficulties,
I'd put up with"

615
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,085
But this is for a lifetime

616
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:13,958
"Had you proposed marriage with me,
I'd surely have thought about it"

617
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:19,971
God! A son-in-law is like a son!
It's a sin to even think like that

618
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,639
I'm looking for someone like Aslam...

619
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:25,242
"who will look after both,
daughter and mother"

620
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:30,241
That beggar? He'll starve.
And Salma will starve with him!

621
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,651
"lf you're such a big man,
I'll give my daughter to you"

622
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:39,658
"Pay me 50,000 rupees
_ 50,000...?"

623
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:44,398
"Yes. 50,000.
_ 50,000...?"

624
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:53,497
"50,000? Where am I going to
get so much of money from?"

625
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:59,613
Who's that...? Who calls me
when I'm overcome by worries?

626
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:05,215
Good folks share their worries.
_ Right now...

627
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:11,121
"I'm worried about 50,000.
Now tell me what you're worried about"

628
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,126
You have something I don't have.
_ I have something...

629
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:19,960
"which could be worth 50,000?
_ You have something.."'

630
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,193
that could be worth hundreds
of thousands of rupees

631
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,633
You have some files...
- Files?

632
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,067
Who the hell are you?
Who told you about me?

633
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:33,644
I don't have any files.
You're trying to buy me out!

634
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,381
Good bye

635
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:47,985
"Do you have 50,000?
_ Do you have the files?"

636
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,198
"l will tell you when you
show me 50,000 rupees"

637
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:53,993
Good bye

638
01:17:56,672 --> 01:18:00,608
"Between my hands and D.P"s throat,
there's 50,000 rupees"

639
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:07,472
"Had I some land or property,
I'd sell it to buy Zafarullah"

640
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,612
I feel scared when
you speak like this

641
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:14,412
I'm scared you might
do something reckless

642
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,360
Do I know you?
_ I know you

643
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,433
You were in the police force
and later in prison

644
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,965
You are now unemployed
and needy

645
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:37,635
You are brave and trustworthy.
You could be of use to me

646
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:43,382
I live over there. Could we
sit there and talk it over?

647
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:48,546
If you want to make a hundred thousand
rupees in a couple of days...

648
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:54,485
come over to the Picnic Cottages
in Juhu at 4:.00 p.m. tomorrow

649
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:11,535
"Roshi, this is Dharam Dev"

650
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,611
You won't actually have
to carry her away

651
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,110
She'll go with you
of her own volition

652
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:27,319
You will call her daddy and tell him
that his daughter's in your custody

653
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,421
You will ask for a million
rupees in ransom

654
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,658
I'll handle the rest.
The million rupees...

655
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,200
will be delivered any place
you ask for it

656
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:43,138
You will take Roshi to a travellers'
bungalow near Khandala tomorrow night

657
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,646
We will meet here on the night
of the day after...

658
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:54,520
"and split the money between us.
Roshi and I get 450,000 each"

659
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:59,390
"100,000 goes to you. Roshi will
return to her father, hale and hearty"

660
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,327
That's the way
we make the dough

661
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:09,402
Mom can't explain.
My daddy's a bloody miser

662
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,235
We have to enact dramas to
get a hundred bucks out of him

663
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:16,672
So we hit upon this plan to keep
us going for a year or two

664
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:20,570
Do you see the plan then?
_ It's a joke for the two of you.

665
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,740
But I could be imprisoned for it.

666
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:31,017
"He can't do it.
_ Quiet, little girl"

667
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,371
"Penning poetry, already?"

668
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,732
"Whatever we have done
was a practical joke"""

669
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:51,512
"Dharam Dev is not responsible.
I hatched the plot"""

670
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,038
Could you sign this please?

671
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:57,312
"I'm a very rich man's wife,
Dharam Dev"

672
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:00,986
If people get to know
I play such jokes on him...

673
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:05,592
"what respect can I command?
_ You're no less, mummy"

674
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,986
Give that to me. Why be afraid
when nothing's going to happen?

675
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,991
Tear it up later. Okay?

676
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:17,999
Here's a thousand rupees.
Arrange for a car

677
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,671
It isn't settled yet. I've got to
sort out a few more things

678
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:27,575
We must trust each other.
Suspicion will lead to more suspicion

679
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,288
Whose lipstick is that?
The mother's or the daughter's?

680
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,026
Which lipstick?

681
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:53,037
This one
_ That girl is a wild cat

682
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:59,207
And you intend to spend a night
with the wild cat in the forests?

683
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,983
"What if she devours you?
_ Not a bad deal at 100,000"

684
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:06,553
"50,000, I will pay Zafarullah"'

685
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,548
May I tell you a secret now?

686
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:19,331
Mr Ghanshyamdas's wife Mala is having an affair with D.P.

687
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:22,001
Really? How do you know?

688
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:27,998
I've dialled her number several times.
They talk lovingly for hours

689
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:33,208
"Secrets being unravelled indeed.
The money will go to D.P.,.."'

690
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,340
"he'll pay his taxes and vanish.
_ Don't get involved in this, Dharam"

691
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:40,485
"Someone else will, if I don't.
The money mustn't go to D.P"'

692
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:43,215
But it stinks. And they could
even be conspiring against you

693
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,382
I must get involved to know
what the conspiracy is

694
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:49,019
I need your car for two days.
_ You may have the car

695
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:52,025
But think again.
_ You're unduly worried

696
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,465
Roshi's going to the movies
with her friends

697
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,428
Very well

698
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,995
"Listen, come home after the show"

699
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,340
"Come here, dear"

700
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,520
Go

701
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:03,163
Give me my ticket.
I'll follow you in my car

702
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,100
I've got to run an errand for mummy.

703
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,398
"Come soon, or you'll
miss the beginning"

704
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,395
Where are you going?
_ To steal. Are you standing guard?

705
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:38,996
Yes. Do I take you away then?
- Sure.

706
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,165
Where will you take me?
To the police station?

707
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,004
I could have you live in my heart

708
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:49,608
"For that, you must come
of your own volition"

709
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:54,445
"Well, what do you say?
_ Forget me, Rajesh"

710
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,355
You will never see me again.
_ Why?

711
01:24:57,692 --> 01:25:00,354
I'm leaving this world.
- This world...?

712
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:05,429
"l mean, this world of
my daddy and mummy"

713
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,498
I'm going to America.
It's all been arranged

714
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,571
"With only a bag?
_ No, you idiot!"

715
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,567
"I'm going to my friend right now.
For America, I leave later"

716
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:17,968
"Let me drop you.
_ No, I'm going close by"

717
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,977
Get on with your beat

718
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:01,955
Don't you feel any guilt to
cheat your father like this?

719
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,959
It was Mom's idea.
_ But you're getting half the money

720
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:09,957
I want to go away to America.
And daddy won't send me away

721
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:13,623
Your daddy's an ailing man.
Suppose something happens to him?

722
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,960
Nothing's going to happen to him

723
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:20,470
He loses millions in business
and doesn't even bat an eyelid

724
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:25,177
His problems have begun since
he has fallen in love at his age

725
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:27,704
Mummy keeps him in a spin

726
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:53,997
"Put your husband on the line, lady"

727
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:57,008
Who are you?
Is this any time to call?

728
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:59,269
My husband is asleep.
_ Wake him up...

729
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:02,281
or he'll sleep forever.
_ What nonsense are you talking?

730
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,351
Who is it?
- Some insolent man!

731
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:10,957
Mr Ghanshyamdas?
- Yes?

732
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:16,357
"Keep this to yourself...
or else, you will lose your daughter"

733
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:21,233
Who's this?
_ I want a million rupees

734
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:25,367
I'll call tomorrow evening and
tell you where to deliver the money

735
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:32,308
Keep the money ready. Or you will
have heard the last of Roshi...

736
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:36,711
Daddy! Save me from these thugs!

737
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,542
"Roshi, where are you?"

738
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:42,990
"Leave me alone, you thugs!
Let me talk to my daddy!"

739
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,084
Silence!

740
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,320
"Leave her alone! Let go of
my child, you thugs, rascals!"

741
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:56,059
What happened?
Tell me something

742
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:08,342
Licence number?
- MRJ 9318.

743
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:27,462
"Yes, you have a booking.
Mr and Mrs Sandeep Kumar"

744
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:36,701
Your mother's a strange woman.

745
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,204
Why did she make a booking
for man and wife?

746
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:43,714
So nobody would suspect us.
If you don't use this bed now...

747
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,043
they're surely going to suspect us.

748
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,716
"All right, you can at least
sit on the bed and chat with me"'

749
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,052
How are we going to spend the night?

750
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,464
I have a headache.
- Headache?

751
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:00,724
I have a miraculous cure

752
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,240
Open your mouth.
- What is this?

753
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,439
Swallow it... it's an English pill.

754
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:18,416
Water...

755
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,351
You don't need any water.
It'll melt in your mouth

756
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:32,029
Why did you take it?
- I have a headache too

757
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:40,030
What pill was that?
_ Giddy?

758
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:44,707
It happens in the beginning.
And then the headache vanishes...

759
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,037
as if you didn't ever have it

760
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:55,716
Take a drag.
- No

761
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:03,463
I have my own cigarettes.
_ Try mine. Am I not a friend?

762
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,625
Take a nice drag

763
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,711
Slowly and stealthily...

764
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:03,319
"who else is in this room,
apart from you and me?"""

765
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:08,722
"Who called him...?
He came uninvited"""

766
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:13,056
"Catch him...
who's the thief?"""

767
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:15,831
Slowly and stealthily...

768
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:22,007
"who else is in this room,
apart from you and me?"""

769
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:26,673
"Who called him...?
He came uninvited"""

770
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:30,414
"Catch him...
who's the thief?"""

771
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:33,343
"Where is he...?
- Over here"""

772
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,712
"Here...?
- There...?"""

773
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:38,014
"up there?
- Down here?"""

774
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:40,022
"Where...?
- Here...?"""

775
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:42,185
There's no one here

776
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:32,402
This window's open

777
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,011
It was shut

778
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:41,349
I felt like some fresh air

779
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:56,368
"You ought to have told me...
I was willing"""

780
01:32:56,737 --> 01:33:01,731
"Modesty came up like a wall
between you and me"""

781
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:06,639
"Forget all this
and think.."""'

782
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:13,044
"you're quiet and I'm quiet.
So who's making all the noise?"""

783
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:16,313
"Who is it...?
_ It's only a curtain"""

784
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:04,733
"My heart is beating,
I'm in a playfull mood.."""'

785
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:09,702
I wish we were left alone tonight

786
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,317
"Between the two of us,
we'd have kicked up a storm"""

787
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:27,458
"Whatever else happened,
we'd surely have fallen in love"""

788
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:31,522
"What a nuisance!
He's so shameless,.."""'

789
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:37,995
"Who's this here who's
boring us...?"""

790
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,207
Who is it... who...?

791
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:42,001
"It's me, of course"

792
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,671
Slowly and stealthily...

793
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:50,006
"who else is in this room,
apart from you and me?"""

794
01:34:51,452 --> 01:34:55,445
"Who called him...?
He came uninvited"""

795
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:59,023
"Catch him...
who's the thief?"""

796
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,024
"Where is he...?
- Over here"""

797
01:35:02,296 --> 01:35:04,025
"Here...?
- There...?"""

798
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:06,297
"up there?
- Down here?"""

799
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,263
"Where...?
- Here...?"""

800
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:10,027
There's no one here

801
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,362
No one...

802
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:28,648
Strange night!

803
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,381
How about your headache?
- Headache?

804
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:37,656
Go and freshen up.
You've got to call Daddy

805
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,991
"Call your daddy, right?"

806
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:47,003
But I've got to call him
in the evening

807
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:52,269
This is Ghanshyamdas

808
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:54,141
What have you decided?

809
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:57,144
The money is ready.
Where is my daughter?

810
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:00,010
She's safe and sound.
Satisfy yourself

811
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:06,024
"I'm okay, daddy.
But come and take me at the earliest"

812
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,122
"Of course, dear. I'm coming over"'

813
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:10,257
And Roshi...

814
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,594
I'll never hit you again
Never

815
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:17,970
"Forgive me, my child"

816
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:29,375
"Do not be disheartened, sir.
Roshi will soon be with you"

817
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:32,509
I'm demanding money from you
because I'm helpless

818
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:34,620
"Someday, I will explain
the whole story to you"

819
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:38,125
"lf possible, I'll return
your money too"

820
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:42,318
Where have I to send the money?
_ You will bring it personally

821
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:46,524
All alone. You will drive
your car at 40 kms per hour...

822
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,999
throw the bag outside
and drive on

823
01:36:49,537 --> 01:36:51,528
"ln two hours, Roshi
will return to your house"

824
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:55,333
Where?
_ On the highway at Goregaon...

825
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:57,704
there's a road that leads to Mulund.
Drive along that road...

826
01:36:58,012 --> 01:37:01,413
till you come across
a torch flashing on the left

827
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:13,550
Mummy must be arriving.
I'll wait with her

828
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:15,592
I'll go and fetch the money

829
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,398
Have your taken your glasses?

830
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:32,243
Why do I need the reading glasses?
_ Carry it.

831
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,649
You might have to look at things
closely. I'll go and get it

832
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,508
No. I'll go and get it myself

833
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:54,747
"Speak up, Roshi...
say something!"

834
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:01,217
What happened to you?
Who was it?

835
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:23,505
"Need something, sir?"

836
01:41:25,012 --> 01:41:27,003
"Do you have a match?
_ Yes, sir"

837
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:39,666
Here you are

838
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:17,171
Got you

839
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:22,979
"Why're you scared? I'm here to catch
a police officer, not a thief"

840
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:25,975
Let's go to the police station

841
01:45:26,253 --> 01:45:28,244
Switch off that headlight first

842
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:36,162
What crime have I committed?
_ You've been missing since yesterday

843
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:38,788
The police department
has been looking for you

844
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,335
What for? What have I done?
- Must I record...

845
01:45:43,437 --> 01:45:47,430
all my statements right here? Won't
you save something for the station?

846
01:45:47,674 --> 01:45:49,505
The Commissioner's waiting for you.
Let's go

847
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:52,167
The Commissioner? At this hour?
- You know how it is

848
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:56,009
"When it's something important, the
Comissioner can't tell night from day"

849
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,714
What can be more important that the
officer who was jailed by mistake...

850
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:05,481
is being called to resume his
duties with due respect today

851
01:46:05,659 --> 01:46:08,560
"No...
_ This is a joyous occasion, sir"

852
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:12,722
The commissioner wants to himself
make you wear your belt again

853
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:25,571
Injustice was done to you.
But now I can surely say...

854
01:46:25,746 --> 01:46:27,737
that justice is being today

855
01:46:30,117 --> 01:46:32,984
We can't celebrate the occasion
with whisky in this office

856
01:46:33,653 --> 01:46:35,644
How about a sherbet?

857
01:46:42,996 --> 01:46:45,988
"Dharam, you are one of
our brave officers"

858
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,525
You can look after yourself
in every adversity

859
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:54,435
I hope you will be a better officer
than you were earlier

860
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:58,006
"l will do my best, sir.
- I have no doubts"

861
01:46:59,012 --> 01:47:03,244
There was another reason why I came
here at this hour of the night

862
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:08,680
Mr Ghanshyamdas is
an old friend of mine

863
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:12,023
Someone kidnapped
his daughter last night

864
01:47:14,027 --> 01:47:17,121
"Out of fright, the poor man
did not even inform the police"

865
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:20,656
He even gave the thug
a ransom of a million rupees

866
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:25,127
"But when his daughter still
did not return, he telephoned me"

867
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:29,976
"Dharam, I want you
to handle this case"

868
01:47:32,679 --> 01:47:35,671
"lf need be, you can
take Rajesh's help"

869
01:47:38,652 --> 01:47:41,985
Dharam is returning to duty after
many days. Make sure you're with him

870
01:47:43,523 --> 01:47:46,515
Poor Ghanshyamdas. He won't be
able to sleep tonight

871
01:47:46,993 --> 01:47:50,394
I told him I'd send someone over.
The two of you go and visit him

872
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:54,397
"Sir, the police are here"

873
01:47:58,438 --> 01:48:02,204
"Sir, I'm Rajesh.
This is lnspector Dharam Dev"

874
01:48:03,376 --> 01:48:06,368
He's incharge of this case.
- Please sit down

875
01:48:09,216 --> 01:48:11,207
May I have a glass of water?

876
01:48:13,019 --> 01:48:16,477
"Will you explain it to us
in detail, sir?"

877
01:48:20,026 --> 01:48:26,226
It happened the day before.
We were eating at that table...

878
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:28,696
and Roshi left with her friends...

879
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:36,131
Roshi... my child...

880
01:48:40,046 --> 01:48:44,449
I didn't look after her well.
Or I wouldn't have to see this day

881
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:50,713
You didn't come there?
- Where?

882
01:48:52,492 --> 01:48:56,394
To collect your share.
- Share? What share?

883
01:48:57,464 --> 01:49:01,457
Don't act innocent.
I have the letter with me

884
01:49:02,068 --> 01:49:08,064
Any letter that will prove
where Roshi is and with whom...

885
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:12,605
who was the one who kidnapped
her for a million rupees...

886
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:15,070
and where he is hiding her...

887
01:49:15,315 --> 01:49:19,012
"should you have a letter like that,
give it to me, lnspector"

888
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:23,486
That letter will prove his crime

889
01:49:32,198 --> 01:49:35,361
Can you take us to the place
where you dropped the bag?

890
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:37,430
Here

891
01:49:49,382 --> 01:49:51,612
Wait... foot_prints

892
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:11,299
Mustn't have been a very smart man

893
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:19,301
Look at this

894
01:50:21,014 --> 01:50:23,539
This is where he must have sat
waiting for the money

895
01:50:24,017 --> 01:50:26,008
Here you are...
- Let me see

896
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:29,015
Charminar?

897
01:50:35,195 --> 01:50:40,223
"Tyre_marks, sir. New ones.
Leading up that lane"

898
01:50:43,036 --> 01:50:45,027
Take photographs

899
01:50:55,448 --> 01:50:57,439
"It's an easy case, sir"

900
01:50:58,051 --> 01:51:00,315
Looks like he arrived
in a small imported car

901
01:51:01,187 --> 01:51:05,715
I think it was an MG. Not more
than 2 or 3 in the city

902
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:08,723
I don't think he knew
he was committing a crime

903
01:51:08,828 --> 01:51:11,820
Or he wouldn't have left
so many clues

904
01:51:17,404 --> 01:51:19,395
"The night of the day before,
I can understand"

905
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:22,998
Where were you last night?
_ Since when have you been waiting?

906
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:27,005
Why've you walked here?
Where's the car?

907
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:30,005
It stalled on the way

908
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:36,019
Don't lie. The car's in the garage.
I saw it in there

909
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,184
You've been spying on me?

910
01:51:41,661 --> 01:51:43,356
"You're not in trouble, are you?"

911
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:49,024
Your face says it all

912
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:55,039
I've got back my job. And I'm already
handling a complicated case

913
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:58,533
Won't you tell me about Mala
and the million rupees?

914
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:04,042
"Sapna, let's meet this evening.
I'm in a hurry right now"

915
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:08,046
All right. Give me the keys.
- Sure...

916
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:13,458
"Why don't you leave the car with me?
_ What is it in the car, Dharam?"

917
01:52:14,461 --> 01:52:16,053
"Sapna, come here"

918
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:19,990
Go home. And don't try to
meet me for a few days

919
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:23,001
"lf someone asks, tell him
that the car has been stolen"

920
01:52:23,136 --> 01:52:25,001
"You've landed yourself
in trouble, haven't you?"

921
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:28,169
I'm not going home
till you tell me!

922
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:33,004
"l don't want you to sink with me.
_ If you sink, so will l"

923
01:52:33,179 --> 01:52:35,409
Do you think I can
live without you?

924
01:52:35,548 --> 01:52:37,413
Listen to me...
- You listen to me!

925
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:39,008
Tell me what happened.
- Later

926
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:40,552
Now! Right now!

927
01:52:44,624 --> 01:52:47,422
"That kid, Roshi.."'

928
01:52:49,028 --> 01:52:50,427
someone has killed her

929
01:52:51,431 --> 01:52:54,025
Every clue points to me.

930
01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:58,029
Dharam! I warned you
_ Her body's in the boot

931
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:03,034
"lf I don't find the killer soon,
I won't be able to save myself"

932
01:53:03,209 --> 01:53:05,575
Why's the body in the boot?
Why's the car in the garage?

933
01:53:05,678 --> 01:53:07,543
It has stalled!
_ So repair it

934
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:11,044
"l will! Go home!
_ I'm not deserting you, Dharam!"

935
01:53:11,217 --> 01:53:13,447
You know what will happen to me
because of you?

936
01:53:13,586 --> 01:53:17,386
"Because of me, you'll have some help.
Come on... come!"

937
01:53:22,996 --> 01:53:24,395
Start the car

938
01:53:28,001 --> 01:53:28,990
Okay

939
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:48,184
Wait here. I'll leave
the car in the forest

940
01:55:19,979 --> 01:55:21,378
Sign here

941
01:55:22,148 --> 01:55:23,979
"Birbal...
_ Yes, sir"

942
01:55:24,217 --> 01:55:27,380
Relay the message on the wireless.
If anyone has spotted a white...

943
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:34,392
"imported car, licence No. MRJ 9318,
the police station be informed"

944
01:55:36,529 --> 01:55:39,123
We're looking for a car
like this one in another case

945
01:55:39,999 --> 01:55:41,330
We'll surely find it

946
01:55:43,403 --> 01:55:45,997
Why didn't you report
the theft yesterday?

947
01:55:47,006 --> 01:55:50,407
I first thought a friend is playing
a practical joke on me

948
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:55,003
"l looked for the car all day.
_ Anyway, we'll keep you informed"

949
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:19,370
Here you are

950
01:56:32,518 --> 01:56:35,385
Imported car? All right.
I get it

951
01:56:36,389 --> 01:56:38,380
I'm glad you're here.
The car we're looking for...

952
01:56:38,658 --> 01:56:41,991
passed by New Bombay's
toll station twice. Let's go

953
01:56:46,165 --> 01:56:48,998
Why're you wearing dark_glasses?
_ I didn't sleep all night

954
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:50,994
My eyes are burning

955
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,972
What happened?
- We've checked all hotels

956
01:57:30,109 --> 01:57:32,600
"Let's check this traveller's bungalow
_ No, he mustn't have been here"

957
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:34,378
What's the harm in looking

958
01:57:38,985 --> 01:57:40,384
"Come here.
_ Yes, sir"

959
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:44,980
You're the caretaker here?
- Yes.

960
01:57:45,124 --> 01:57:49,390
Recognise her?
_ She was here the other night

961
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:52,396
With her husband.
- Husband?

962
01:57:52,999 --> 01:57:56,400
They had a booking. The register
even has their signatures

963
01:57:56,536 --> 01:57:58,003
You can take a look

964
01:57:58,304 --> 01:58:02,001
Did it appear as if that man
had abducted her?

965
01:58:02,141 --> 01:58:03,540
"No, she was happy to be with him"

966
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:08,403
"Could you recognise the man,
if you saw him?"

967
01:58:08,548 --> 01:58:12,416
Why not? He looked
like you

968
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:16,411
"ln fact, he was more like him"

969
01:58:16,656 --> 01:58:19,022
Go and get the register.
- Follow me

970
01:58:19,425 --> 01:58:21,017
Go on

971
01:58:28,034 --> 01:58:31,026
"Any news?
_ The car has been found, sir"

972
01:58:31,437 --> 01:58:33,029
Where?
_ In the jungles

973
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:35,036
A police party is awaiting you

974
01:58:35,675 --> 01:58:38,439
"Shall we go, sir?
Or would you like a drink?"

975
01:58:39,045 --> 01:58:40,034
Let's go

976
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:54,458
"Kasim, has anybody messed with it?
_ No, sir"

977
01:58:54,594 --> 01:58:57,062
Ask them not to move around.
We'll find his foot_prints

978
01:59:22,555 --> 01:59:26,423
"Forget me, Rajesh.
You will never see me again"""

979
01:59:27,026 --> 01:59:29,017
"Why?
_ I'm going away"""

980
01:59:32,198 --> 01:59:35,031
Did you know her?
- Yes

981
01:59:35,434 --> 01:59:40,030
He took a million...
and killed the girl!

982
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:45,374
"The killer can't escape, Rajesh.
I won't let him get away"

983
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:49,047
You're right. The killer
can't escape

984
01:59:50,049 --> 01:59:53,450
"Because I won't let him get away
_ Sir, come here"

985
01:59:57,056 --> 01:59:58,045
"Look at this, sir"

986
02:00:06,065 --> 02:00:08,056
The murder took place
in Picnic Cottage

987
02:00:09,235 --> 02:00:13,467
She must've tried to
resist the killer

988
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:26,007
"Foot_prints, look"

989
02:00:30,423 --> 02:00:33,017
See...? Here they are

990
02:00:41,334 --> 02:00:43,029
And what is this...?

991
02:00:44,437 --> 02:00:45,426
Charminar

992
02:00:46,038 --> 02:00:47,437
A packet too

993
02:00:49,442 --> 02:00:51,034
This is Charminar too

994
02:00:52,311 --> 02:00:56,441
He must have gone in that direction.
Take a look...

995
02:00:57,049 --> 02:00:59,040
I'll go and enquire at
the Picnic Cottage

996
02:00:59,452 --> 02:01:04,048
"Sir, I want to go there too.
_ Let's divide our work, Rajesh"

997
02:01:04,123 --> 02:01:06,057
We'll wrap it up much faster

998
02:01:17,069 --> 02:01:19,003
Dharam Dev...?

999
02:01:20,006 --> 02:01:22,998
Cottage 8 was booked in the
name of one Mr Dharam Dev

1000
02:01:23,142 --> 02:01:26,009
Did he personally make the booking?
_ I don't know. I wasn't on duty then.

1001
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:30,014
Who paid for him?
_ Looks like it was paid in advance

1002
02:01:31,183 --> 02:01:33,413
A woman paid it?
- I don't know...

1003
02:01:33,519 --> 02:01:35,419
"l could find out, if you wish.
_ It's okay"

1004
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:39,014
I'll have to take this register to
the police station for a few days

1005
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:42,355
Okay. But what is the case about?
- You will soon know

1006
02:01:51,037 --> 02:01:54,438
That lnspector has taken the
register away. How can I help you?

1007
02:01:54,573 --> 02:01:56,438
I came for the register too.
But it's okay

1008
02:01:58,044 --> 02:02:00,444
Since when has this gentleman
joined the police force?

1009
02:02:01,047 --> 02:02:02,674
Do you know him?
- Of course

1010
02:02:03,049 --> 02:02:05,449
He was put up in Cottage No. 8
two days ago

1011
02:02:05,584 --> 02:02:08,052
This gentleman? No way...
You must be mistaken

1012
02:02:08,154 --> 02:02:11,453
"Not a chance, sir. I personally
lit a cigarette for him"

1013
02:02:11,691 --> 02:02:15,457
He came in a white car.
- A white MG?

1014
02:02:16,062 --> 02:02:17,393
An imported small car

1015
02:02:18,197 --> 02:02:20,995
You said in the report that you
don't have a garage to park the car

1016
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:23,397
You park it on the road.
_ Right

1017
02:02:24,003 --> 02:02:25,994
But you must be locking it?
- Sure

1018
02:02:26,105 --> 02:02:28,335
And you locked it that night?
- Of course

1019
02:02:28,407 --> 02:02:29,396
Do you have the keys?

1020
02:02:30,009 --> 02:02:30,998
Yes

1021
02:02:37,016 --> 02:02:39,007
This is where I keep it.

1022
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:41,517
Could you have forgotten
to lock the car that night?

1023
02:02:43,222 --> 02:02:48,023
No. I don't normally forget...
_ You could've forgotten that night

1024
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:52,426
Or perhaps left the keys
in the car itself?

1025
02:02:54,266 --> 02:02:57,429
"l don't normally forget, but...
_ Maybe you did, that one time?"

1026
02:02:58,037 --> 02:03:03,441
Could you have lent the car
to a friend... and forgotten?

1027
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:05,442
Are you kidding me?

1028
02:03:07,446 --> 02:03:12,042
Do you know someone
by the name Dharam?

1029
02:03:13,252 --> 02:03:16,380
"Dharam...? No, I don't"

1030
02:03:20,626 --> 02:03:24,995
You must know that I have a
chemicals manufacturing factory too

1031
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:35,000
Set fire to this chemical and
you can get the stink far away

1032
02:03:36,008 --> 02:03:39,409
I thought the rascal would
certainly burn the bag...

1033
02:03:39,545 --> 02:03:46,007
after taking out the money.
So I emptied an entire bottle in it

1034
02:03:54,427 --> 02:03:57,419
"lf D.P. gets his hands on the money,
he'll pay his taxes"

1035
02:03:58,030 --> 02:04:03,024
"lf you get to know about it,
call me on this number"

1036
02:04:06,038 --> 02:04:10,031
"Go the Reserve Bank immediately
and have 600,000 deposited there"

1037
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:14,441
Take the receipt to Mr Ghosh
at the passport office

1038
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:17,048
Show him the receipt
and bring my passport

1039
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:21,617
Call Mr Gupta.

1040
02:04:21,987 --> 02:04:23,978
Book a seat for me to Geneva on
the flight the day after tomorrow

1041
02:04:41,106 --> 02:04:43,199
I'm calling from
D.P. Shipping Corporation

1042
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:47,410
"Mr Gupta? Yes, this is Sapna here"

1043
02:04:48,013 --> 02:04:51,005
Mr D.P. wants to leave for Europe
the day after tomorrow

1044
02:04:51,116 --> 02:04:54,608
"Could you book a first_class
seat for him, please? To Geneva"

1045
02:04:55,087 --> 02:04:57,521
Has the money been paid?
- Yes

1046
02:04:57,723 --> 02:05:00,419
So he has got the passport?
- Almost

1047
02:05:02,428 --> 02:05:04,419
I'll have the ticket
collected tomorrow

1048
02:05:08,033 --> 02:05:09,432
"It's done, sir"

1049
02:05:56,015 --> 02:05:58,415
He has gone out.
- Out...?

1050
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:03,017
Maybe you haven't recognised me.
- No

1051
02:06:03,155 --> 02:06:05,419
Haven't you ever been to the office
with Mr Zafarullah?

1052
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:08,026
What would women like me
do in the office?

1053
02:06:08,093 --> 02:06:11,426
"No wonder you don't recognise Durga
Prasad, your husband's employer"

1054
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:16,195
"You, sir? My husband's boss?
- Yes"

1055
02:06:16,435 --> 02:06:18,960
Please come in.
_ I'm in a hurry

1056
02:06:19,104 --> 02:06:22,369
"Actually, I had given Zafarullah
some files for safe_keeping"

1057
02:06:22,608 --> 02:06:25,975
"Yes, and he gave me those files
to be put away safely"

1058
02:06:26,612 --> 02:06:29,376
I'm here to collect those files.
_ I'll get them immediately

1059
02:06:29,481 --> 02:06:32,609
But I won't let you leave without
having the sherbet I prepare

1060
02:06:32,985 --> 02:06:34,976
My husband will be angry

1061
02:06:46,999 --> 02:06:47,988
What happened?

1062
02:06:52,004 --> 02:06:54,996
I don't know if I will be able
to return from Europe anymore

1063
02:06:57,176 --> 02:07:01,010
I have some very important documents
lying in Zafarullah Khan house

1064
02:07:01,413 --> 02:07:03,347
I must have them collected

1065
02:07:05,618 --> 02:07:08,416
Mr D.P. came here personally?
_ Oh yes

1066
02:07:08,554 --> 02:07:12,422
"He sat down, had a glass of sherbet
and then went away with his files"

1067
02:07:13,025 --> 02:07:15,425
How did you recognise him?
Was he a tall man?

1068
02:07:16,028 --> 02:07:18,292
"Yes, he was.
_ Did he sport a beard?"

1069
02:07:18,364 --> 02:07:20,229
No.
- No?!

1070
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:36,379
Was it him...?

1071
02:07:38,183 --> 02:07:40,981
No. Who's this rotten man
with a beard?

1072
02:07:41,387 --> 02:07:46,381
This rotten man is the one
who's going to have me shaved!

1073
02:07:48,994 --> 02:07:50,985
Khansaheb...
_ My Lord!

1074
02:07:51,397 --> 02:07:54,992
Here's my shoe.
Be my guest

1075
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,395
I'm in a hurry.
I don't have the time for jokes

1076
02:07:57,536 --> 02:08:00,403
"So give me fifty blows!
_ Come to your senses, Zafarullah!"

1077
02:08:01,006 --> 02:08:04,999
I'm here to take my files away.
_ I get it. Fifty blows won't do

1078
02:08:05,344 --> 02:08:07,403
"Hit me as much as you will, sir!"

1079
02:08:08,013 --> 02:08:10,641
"500 blows, 1000, 2000...
here's my head!"

1080
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:14,417
"What happened?
_ Not my mistake, sir"

1081
02:08:14,553 --> 02:08:18,011
My second wife is a bit naive.
- What has she done?

1082
02:08:18,424 --> 02:08:21,018
"She gave the files away, sir.
_ Gave away...?"

1083
02:08:21,427 --> 02:08:23,418
To whom?
- I don't know!

1084
02:08:23,562 --> 02:08:26,429
"So who knows, idiot!
_ I'm suffocating, sir"

1085
02:08:27,032 --> 02:08:29,432
"Spare my life, please!
_ Spare you?"

1086
02:08:29,535 --> 02:08:33,437
I might rot in prison because of you!
_ Oh yes... no!

1087
02:08:33,572 --> 02:08:36,439
God will help you!
_ Help me?

1088
02:08:37,042 --> 02:08:40,034
Pray to God that He helps you!

1089
02:08:43,449 --> 02:08:46,043
At least let me check
where you are hurt

1090
02:08:46,452 --> 02:08:49,444
You can't... call Salma.
She'll check it out

1091
02:08:50,055 --> 02:08:52,046
She'll know where I'm hurt

1092
02:08:53,058 --> 02:08:56,050
What drama is this?
_ Go and lend him a soothing hand

1093
02:08:56,195 --> 02:08:58,060
He's stricken by you.
_ Shut up

1094
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:05,059
"Your passport has arrived, sir.
_ Lovely. So I can leave tonight"

1095
02:09:23,021 --> 02:09:26,013
Trouble time. D.P. has
got his passport

1096
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:29,352
And he's planning on fleeing
the country tonight itself

1097
02:09:29,762 --> 02:09:32,026
Don't worry.
D.P. can't go anywhere now

1098
02:09:32,197 --> 02:09:35,428
Go home and rest. I'm not going
to find any time today

1099
02:09:39,571 --> 02:09:41,198
I had kept that bag here

1100
02:09:48,046 --> 02:09:49,035
Where has it gone?

1101
02:09:49,248 --> 02:09:51,148
"lsn't this bag, is it?"

1102
02:09:52,151 --> 02:09:57,054
There were a few blood stains on it
which have been examined in the lab

1103
02:09:58,056 --> 02:09:59,580
It was Roshi's blood

1104
02:10:02,294 --> 02:10:06,594
It had the killer's finger_prints
whose pictures have been taken

1105
02:10:07,266 --> 02:10:11,066
I know those hands very well

1106
02:10:13,305 --> 02:10:17,071
This is the shoe whose prints
we found earlier

1107
02:10:19,278 --> 02:10:22,008
This is the cigarette packet
and cigarette butts...

1108
02:10:23,015 --> 02:10:25,006
I found in the criminal's house

1109
02:10:26,552 --> 02:10:30,420
Here are the keys of the car
in which the body was found

1110
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:36,359
And the car belongs to
the killer's girlfriend

1111
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:40,021
It wasn't stolen at all

1112
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:48,438
Handcuffs

1113
02:10:53,045 --> 02:10:58,039
>From you I learnt to
be a good officer

1114
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:04,047
"Now tell me, what can I do
except this?"

1115
02:11:04,323 --> 02:11:08,657
"You need something more to
arrest me, Rajesh. A warrant"

1116
02:11:09,127 --> 02:11:12,392
"With the killer in front of him,
a cop doesn't go fetching warrants"

1117
02:11:12,664 --> 02:11:15,462
You will have to.
And I'm in uniform

1118
02:11:16,068 --> 02:11:19,003
And I'm your senior.
_ You can report me...

1119
02:11:19,171 --> 02:11:22,004
"but I will not let
Roshi's killer escape, sir"

1120
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:24,005
I won't let Roshi's killer
escape either

1121
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:27,001
"For that, I need time today"'

1122
02:11:27,412 --> 02:11:30,006
If I still don't succeed in
clearing your misgivings...

1123
02:11:31,149 --> 02:11:36,416
I'll hand myself over to you.
This is a promise to a friend.

1124
02:11:36,655 --> 02:11:40,022
">From one officer to another
_ For two days, you've been fooling me"

1125
02:11:40,192 --> 02:11:43,025
I trusted you and you kept
making a fool out of me!

1126
02:11:43,428 --> 02:11:47,023
I'm not falling for your trap again.
Give me your hands

1127
02:11:47,432 --> 02:11:52,028
"My hands, I won't extend.
You will have to use force"

1128
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:22,389
Stay here

1129
02:12:48,293 --> 02:12:50,591
Your officer wants you upstairs

1130
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:03,029
Yes?

1131
02:13:04,209 --> 02:13:06,439
D.P. has sent for me.
Tell him that Dharam Dev is here

1132
02:13:07,045 --> 02:13:12,039
I'll check if he has left.
Please stay here

1133
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:22,983
Who is it?

1134
02:13:46,018 --> 02:13:47,417
Put Mr Gupta on the line

1135
02:13:50,022 --> 02:13:53,014
I have a ticket for the day after.
Can I fly tonight?

1136
02:13:53,225 --> 02:13:56,422
The day after...? Who's this?
- It's D.P. here

1137
02:13:56,728 --> 02:13:59,026
What ticket are you talking about?

1138
02:13:59,264 --> 02:14:03,428
Sapna spoke to you this morning.
_ Sapna did? Not at all

1139
02:14:03,535 --> 02:14:06,026
I've just arrived in the office.
- What nonsense!

1140
02:14:06,138 --> 02:14:08,038
She kept uttering your name
over the telephone

1141
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:13,444
"Sapna, do you know someone
by the name of Dharam?"""

1142
02:14:15,047 --> 02:14:17,038
"Listen, I must fly to
Geneva tonight"

1143
02:14:19,117 --> 02:14:19,981
Book a ticket for me
on any airline

1144
02:14:21,386 --> 02:14:24,321
There's a Swissair flight at 00:.30
- That will do

1145
02:14:24,389 --> 02:14:26,380
I'll collect the ticket
at the airport

1146
02:14:28,994 --> 02:14:30,985
"ln a tearing hurry, D.P.?"

1147
02:14:33,165 --> 02:14:35,998
How will I manage without you?
- You?

1148
02:14:36,101 --> 02:14:38,001
How dare you come here
without permission?

1149
02:14:38,136 --> 02:14:42,402
Don't you like my uniform?
I came to show it to you

1150
02:14:42,507 --> 02:14:46,409
You think you get into a respectable
man's house anytime you wish?

1151
02:14:46,545 --> 02:14:51,005
Get in and even search the place.
Provided he's a respectable man

1152
02:14:52,017 --> 02:14:53,416
"Like you, D.P"'

1153
02:14:53,585 --> 02:14:57,521
You need a Search Warrant.
Do you have one?

1154
02:14:57,722 --> 02:15:00,418
Such formalities between friends!
Come on...

1155
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:05,419
I didn't ask for warrants when you
shoved a live man before my jeep

1156
02:15:08,033 --> 02:15:09,432
I didn't ask for it...

1157
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:13,026
even when you made me swallow
a whole bottle of whisky

1158
02:15:16,441 --> 02:15:20,377
I didn't protest even when you
implicated me for Roshi's murder

1159
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:23,971
Such things happen
between friends

1160
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:27,381
But it's unfair of you to swallow
a million bucks all alone

1161
02:15:27,986 --> 02:15:31,979
Now tell me where you hid the bag?
_ What nonsense are you talking?

1162
02:15:32,991 --> 02:15:35,391
You seem to have escaped
from a loonybin

1163
02:15:35,527 --> 02:15:37,392
Didn't I say we shared
a one_sided friendship?

1164
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:41,998
"lf you refuse to help me, I'll
have to search for the bag on my own"

1165
02:16:00,418 --> 02:16:03,012
You couldn't even hide it properly.
_ Why should l?

1166
02:16:03,221 --> 02:16:05,416
There are so many bags here.
This is just another

1167
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:08,022
Ghanshyamdas was right
when he thought...

1168
02:16:08,126 --> 02:16:11,425
the killer would try to get rid of it
once he had got the money

1169
02:16:13,031 --> 02:16:15,363
He thought the killer
would try to burn the bag...

1170
02:16:15,534 --> 02:16:17,968
so it would be destroyed

1171
02:16:20,372 --> 02:16:22,966
"You're lucky you didn't try that,
or you'd have been caught, D.P"'

1172
02:16:23,308 --> 02:16:27,369
That old fossil is a smart man.
Know what he did?

1173
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:36,978
He put some acid in it
which would raise a stink

1174
02:16:37,989 --> 02:16:39,388
How about checking it out?

1175
02:16:46,998 --> 02:16:49,398
Enough. It'll destroy the evidence

1176
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:18,012
Keep a watch on lnspector
Dharam Dev and Sapna's house

1177
02:18:40,045 --> 02:18:42,036
Dharam... You're back?

1178
02:18:49,454 --> 02:18:52,048
So you're the snake in the grass!

1179
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:24,011
Rajesh!
- Yes?

1180
02:19:24,189 --> 02:19:25,417
Something's burning in there

1181
02:19:29,027 --> 02:19:32,656
What stink is that?
_ Something's burning in there

1182
02:19:35,667 --> 02:19:37,430
Something's burning in that house

1183
02:19:40,038 --> 02:19:42,438
We must check. The fire
could spread

1184
02:19:51,049 --> 02:19:52,710
There's someone lying there.

1185
02:19:53,251 --> 02:19:55,378
Carry her out... come on!

1186
02:20:05,597 --> 02:20:07,588
Fetch some water. Quick

1187
02:20:13,605 --> 02:20:15,470
Sapna! What happened to her?

1188
02:20:17,409 --> 02:20:20,401
"She was lying unconscious, while
this bag burnt in your house"

1189
02:20:20,545 --> 02:20:23,412
Your house was full of smoke.
_ Luckily we reached in time

1190
02:20:23,548 --> 02:20:26,016
Quick! Take her to a hospital

1191
02:20:37,328 --> 02:20:39,421
Such a stink in this little bag?
Strange

1192
02:20:40,031 --> 02:20:41,430
Watch it... it's very hot

1193
02:20:54,446 --> 02:20:56,038
Follow that cab

1194
02:21:04,255 --> 02:21:06,314
"Yes, Latif?
_ lnspector Dharam Dev.."'

1195
02:21:06,458 --> 02:21:08,688
has taken a girl to Bombay Hospital

1196
02:21:13,064 --> 02:21:16,056
What name did you say?
Sapna...? What's the surname?

1197
02:21:17,402 --> 02:21:19,666
Not Sapna. It's Roshi Ghanshyamdas

1198
02:21:22,674 --> 02:21:25,006
Room No 437

1199
02:21:34,018 --> 02:21:35,645
I want to talk to your husband

1200
02:21:38,022 --> 02:21:41,014
He can't take the call right now.
What is it?

1201
02:21:41,392 --> 02:21:43,690
I can talk only to him.
It's important

1202
02:21:46,431 --> 02:21:48,023
Call for you

1203
02:22:04,349 --> 02:22:07,443
Who's this?
_ We have found your daughter

1204
02:22:08,653 --> 02:22:11,645
She's in a critical condition.
She wants to talk to you

1205
02:22:13,057 --> 02:22:16,049
I see... but where is she?

1206
02:22:16,561 --> 02:22:21,396
Come to Bombay Hospital immediately.
Room No. 437

1207
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,558
Room's in the name of
Roshi Ghanshyamdas

1208
02:22:25,003 --> 02:22:26,630
437...?

1209
02:22:27,338 --> 02:22:31,001
"Mala, Roshi's alive!
Anybody there?"

1210
02:22:43,688 --> 02:22:44,518
"Go on, Mala"

1211
02:22:44,722 --> 02:22:49,022
There was a call from Bombay Hospital.
That's where Roshi is

1212
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:53,426
In Room No. 437
_ lmpossible

1213
02:22:53,731 --> 02:22:56,029
She wants to talk to her father
before she dies

1214
02:22:57,035 --> 02:23:00,664
"This is a trap, Mala.
_ When you saw her last.."'

1215
02:23:01,039 --> 02:23:05,032
had she really gone to sleep?
- Almost

1216
02:23:06,044 --> 02:23:10,378
Almost? Not fully?
_ She had shut her eyes

1217
02:23:11,049 --> 02:23:13,677
"And I had to leave, when
I heard a car approaching"

1218
02:23:16,054 --> 02:23:17,988
You've ruined everything

1219
02:23:18,256 --> 02:23:22,659
"Don't do something silly, Mala.
She can't wake up so easily"

1220
02:23:23,194 --> 02:23:25,321
Ghanshyamdas is rushing
to the hospital

1221
02:23:25,396 --> 02:23:30,993
"Get there before him, lest it
spoils things for you and for me"

1222
02:23:44,282 --> 02:23:51,415
I want to talk to the special nurse
in Room No. 437

1223
02:23:51,689 --> 02:23:55,181
"Sorry, sir. We can't call anyone
from the fourth floor"

1224
02:23:55,293 --> 02:23:56,282
Listen...

1225
02:23:56,427 --> 02:24:00,420
could you please tell me
who's in that room?

1226
02:24:16,447 --> 02:24:19,382
We've given her the oxygen.
There's no danger anymore

1227
02:24:19,651 --> 02:24:21,642
She can regain consciousness
any moment now

1228
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:27,981
What's your name?
- Vithal

1229
02:24:28,126 --> 02:24:30,993
"Any other vacant room around, Vithal?
- The one at the corner"

1230
02:24:31,162 --> 02:24:33,392
Help me shift her to that room

1231
02:24:33,998 --> 02:24:36,626
"It's against the rules, sir.
- Leave that to me. Come on"

1232
02:25:16,441 --> 02:25:18,375
Roshi Ghanshyamdas?
- Yes

1233
02:25:51,642 --> 02:25:53,075
"Come on inside, Rajesh"

1234
02:25:57,415 --> 02:25:59,007
You're bang on time

1235
02:25:59,417 --> 02:26:02,648
"Good, you've got these too.
The real killer will soon be here"

1236
02:26:03,154 --> 02:26:06,681
"Whether someone comes here or not,
you can't leave this place surely"

1237
02:26:07,091 --> 02:26:10,185
You have that bag in which
the money was supposed to be?

1238
02:26:11,028 --> 02:26:13,428
It had nothing but scrap.
_ Right.

1239
02:26:13,664 --> 02:26:15,188
This is the bag which
contained the money

1240
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:22,303
It's the same kind of bag.
How did it get burnt?

1241
02:26:22,373 --> 02:26:24,500
"We'll talk later, Rajesh.
We have very little time"

1242
02:26:27,278 --> 02:26:31,146
"Roshi's killer is already here.
Anytime now, he'll enter this room"

1243
02:26:34,585 --> 02:26:39,386
I've sent rumours to him that Roshi
Ghanshyamdas is lying in this room

1244
02:26:39,991 --> 02:26:43,392
That she'll reveal the name of the
assassin when she regains consciousness

1245
02:26:47,999 --> 02:26:50,399
The killer will never want her
to regain consciousness

1246
02:26:51,002 --> 02:26:54,995
"On the contrary, he will make
another attempt to kill her"

1247
02:26:58,242 --> 02:27:02,008
Ask your men to hide. He might
smell trouble and go away

1248
02:27:05,216 --> 02:27:06,205
Listen...

1249
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:18,411
Salma...

1250
02:28:25,029 --> 02:28:26,428
What are you doing here?

1251
02:28:27,665 --> 02:28:30,031
"You, sir? What are you doing here?"

1252
02:28:30,434 --> 02:28:34,427
A friend's daughter is
lying ill in Room 437

1253
02:28:34,572 --> 02:28:36,369
So let's go and find out
how she is

1254
02:28:37,275 --> 02:28:39,539
The girl's mother doesn't like me

1255
02:28:40,444 --> 02:28:44,437
Doesn't like you...?
She's a stupid woman!

1256
02:28:45,049 --> 02:28:48,041
Go to the room and find out
if she's all alone...

1257
02:28:48,119 --> 02:28:50,053
or if there's someone else too

1258
02:28:52,189 --> 02:28:54,453
"Like a storm,
I will go and come back"

1259
02:28:55,459 --> 02:28:59,054
Nobody must get to know
what you're doing there

1260
02:29:00,064 --> 02:29:02,055
"Nobody will get to know, sir"

1261
02:29:02,233 --> 02:29:04,463
"Like a thief, I'll go.
Like a cop, I'll return"

1262
02:29:04,702 --> 02:29:06,397
Please let me go

1263
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:02,042
"Halt there, or I'll open fire"

1264
02:31:05,189 --> 02:31:06,213
I'm down here

1265
02:31:25,643 --> 02:31:28,407
"Don't move, lnspector.
Your life is in my hands"

1266
02:31:30,414 --> 02:31:31,403
Freeze!

1267
02:31:32,683 --> 02:31:34,674
I have nothing against you.

1268
02:31:35,419 --> 02:31:38,411
But take a look at what I'm carrying

1269
02:31:45,029 --> 02:31:47,429
Each grenade can explode

1270
02:31:48,032 --> 02:31:50,023
Want to see?

1271
02:31:59,443 --> 02:32:03,038
See? So many innocent
lives in this hospital

1272
02:32:04,248 --> 02:32:07,445
"Let me go, if you care for them.
Let nobody stop me"

1273
02:32:09,053 --> 02:32:12,045
"Latif, let him go"

1274
02:32:13,057 --> 02:32:15,048
Don't anyone follow me.

1275
02:32:15,326 --> 02:32:17,988
One grenade is enough
to blow up this building

1276
02:32:18,195 --> 02:32:21,392
I'll kill everyone
if I have to die

1277
02:34:21,385 --> 02:34:22,374
Hold it

1278
02:34:23,187 --> 02:34:24,518
Back off!

1279
02:34:32,997 --> 02:34:34,988
"The joke's on you, D.P"'

1280
02:34:35,399 --> 02:34:36,991
Your grenades lie wasted.

1281
02:34:37,134 --> 02:34:40,399
And an empty revolver
does the trick for me

1282
02:34:42,172 --> 02:34:44,402
This one isn't empty

1283
02:34:45,009 --> 02:34:47,000
"Will you move back,
or must I open fire?"

1284
02:34:57,688 --> 02:35:00,020
See what this is?

1285
02:35:02,026 --> 02:35:04,017
It's a bullet

1286
02:35:04,428 --> 02:35:06,191
It bears your name

1287
02:35:11,568 --> 02:35:15,664
It was lying near by heart...
Ionging to be lodged in yours

1288
02:35:20,377 --> 02:35:22,368
"l regret, I'm in uniform"

1289
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:25,380
It's against the law to fire
at an unarmed man

1290
02:35:25,983 --> 02:35:27,507
The law will deal with you

1291
02:35:27,985 --> 02:35:32,979
I hope you will surrender quietly and
not compel me to use this bullet

1292
02:36:04,021 --> 02:36:06,012
You ought to have
brought the handcuffs

1293
02:36:11,028 --> 02:36:13,019
"Please don't embarrass me
anymore, sir"

1294
02:36:14,031 --> 02:36:16,022
You're my senior officer

1295
02:36:22,973 --> 02:36:25,965
"Sapna, why did you come up here?
_ Are you okay?"

1296
02:36:26,143 --> 02:36:29,203
I'm okay and so is everything else
is also okay
