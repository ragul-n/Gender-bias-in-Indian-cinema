00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,544
While saying horoscope, we should say only good

40
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,931
We should hide bad and show the solution.

00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:53,237

Honey! - Father!

126
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:13,004

134
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,669
Mom!

135
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:44,418
Mom!

136
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:47,791
Sister! My sister!

137
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,568
Brother!

138
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:50,837
Sister!

139
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,092
Mom!

140
00:15:56,882 --> 00:16:10,614
Om Namashivaya! Om Namashivaya!

141
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,089
No one can stop this Andhakasura.

142
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:43,289
No! I will not leave anyone who try to stop me

143
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:47,093
You are feeling happy by killing a small mice.

144
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:47,846
What?

145
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:51,033
Powerful person is there to stop you.

146
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,636
Who is that? Lord Shiva

147
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,943
Shiva?

148
00:16:55,143 --> 00:17:00,067
The 5 manifestations you are trying to control

149
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:04,441
The king of that 5 manifestations, Lord Shiva.

150
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:11,956
The lady whom you want to marry and sacrifice

151
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:16,845
That lady born with blessings of Goddess Parvathi Devi

152
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:22,447
So, that Shiva will stop you.

153
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:26,494
He will not allow you to marry that lady.

154
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:30,626
Oh! I too should sacrifice my life to that God family?

155
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,817
My waiting from thousands of years should be wasted?

156
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,634
Is there any solution?

157
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:39,343
We have a solution. Lord Shiva gifts anything we pray for.

158
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,326
You should use your faith not your strength.

159
00:17:45,155 --> 00:18:13,305
Om Namashivaya! Om Namashivaya!

160
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:51,369
Think this as doings of Lord Shiva and pray him

161
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,089
I kept my faith in you till now.

162
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,398
I will never chant your name and never pray you.

163
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,951
Om Namashivaya!

164
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,902
20 years later

165
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,988
Swamy! Shall we start? Where is Maheshwari?

166
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:53,973
She is house surgeon. She went to attend an emergency case.

167
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:59,710
Every year we start the parade with her, can we wait for her?

168
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,709
We should wait for God, but God should not wait for us

169
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:05,796
You can start.

170
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:22,912
Hara Hara Mahadeva! Shamboshankara!

171
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,508
Go and see that if anything got stricken under the wheel

172
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:30,141
Nothing brother.

173
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,748
Uncle! Sister is coming.

174
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,767
Om jai jai namaha! Om sruthyai namaha!

175
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:54,541
Om mathyai namaha! Om Om Om Om!

176
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:59,586
Om gathyai namaha! Om shakthyai namaha!

177
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:05,315
Om rakthyai namaha! Om Om Om!

178
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:10,622

00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:33,093
We attended the meeting of priest about you Malli

352
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,333
Hey stop it man! You drunkard and you stupid words

353
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:39,753
Malli, you go and take rest. We will go from here.

354
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:43,750
Hey! Where will you go? I will show you Dirty Picture.

355
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,965
It is routine that, you say the stories while I will sleep

356
00:37:49,373 --> 00:37:50,148
First you start the story.

357
00:37:50,624 --> 00:37:52,503
Long, long ago there was a king. - Ok.

358
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:57,031
He has 7 sons and one day they went for hunt

359
00:37:57,468 --> 00:37:58,784
They brought 7 fishes. - Ok.

360
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,017
Kept in sunlight to dry them. - Ok.

361
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:03,127
6 fishes got dried, but 1 fish has not

362
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,357
From my childhood I am hearing it. Will it dry?

363
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:09,610
I too do not know. - What is the job you are doing?

364
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:12,368
Do not you know Malli? I am priest in temple.

365
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:16,149
As a priest in temple, why are you saying non-veg stories?

366
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,527
Oh God! Stop!

367
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,270
Hero used to break the stones to earn money

368
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:29,222
One girl will love him. She got stones in her kidney

369
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:33,275
To treat that stones, hero will spend what he earn.

370
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:35,008
Finally he married her

371
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:38,650
During their first night, she sang a song.

372
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:43,682
Are you Rama, who made stone into a woman?

373
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:47,444
Are you Lord Shiva, who kept Ganga on his head?

374
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:49,526
Oh God! Shiva - From which movie is this song?

375
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:52,772
Thrishulam. - Why are you telling Shiva in front of me?

376
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:58,918
As the curtain is raised, it is a forest into which even crows cannot enter

377
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,869
Forest is as small as even ants cannot enter

378
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:05,093
In that forest, one Prince is going on horse

379
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:05,731
Hey! - Oh God!

380
00:39:05,931 --> 00:39:11,527
Even ants and crows cannot enter, how can a prince ride a horse?

381
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,587
We no need of logic for these stories Malli.

382
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,006
Oh God!

383
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,500
You will beat if, we say the story or not

384
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:21,353
If you beat me now, I will go and have my quarter

385
00:39:21,553 --> 00:39:23,493
Without listening my story, where will you go?

386
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:40,037
Saying Lali, Lali, air should sing a lullaby

387
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:52,069
Listening this lullaby, all the world should swing

388
00:39:56,289 --> 00:40:03,828
Moon reaches earth to play with you

389
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:12,239
Jasmine stares at you that, it cannot laugh like you

390
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:19,780
Saying Lali Lali, air should sing a lullaby

391
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:36,220
I feel like Abhishekam, when I pour water on your head

392
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:44,250
It looks like offering to God when I feed you.

393
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:51,832
It is like Puja to Lord Shiva, when I tie anklets to you

394
00:40:52,600 --> 00:41:00,076
Our home turned as Kailasam when you blush

395
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:08,085
Saying Lali Lali, air should sing a lullaby

396
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:13,384
Goddess Lakshmi has born in our home

397
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:48,313
Then now only my sister is with me

398
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:50,376
Now you say. Whose mistake is it?

399
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:51,761
Climax is little doubtful.

400
00:41:51,866 --> 00:41:52,844
Is it? - No?

401
00:41:53,188 --> 00:41:54,475
You? - Fate Sir. Fate.

402
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:58,058
No, Lord Shiva is responsible for all this. - Yes.

403
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:01,488
Hey! I like you. - Will you leave me?

404
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,817
I will not leave because you are the Priest at Lord Shiva temple

405
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:08,923
Oh God! Stop!

406
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:15,072
If you arrange meeting again, I will wash you out

407
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:17,534
Maha Shivarathri

408
00:42:18,556 --> 00:42:20,248
Kashi

409
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:43,640
Om Namashivaya! Om Namashivaya!

410
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:46,804
Shrishailam

411
00:42:49,895 --> 00:43:01,916
Om Namashivaya! Om Namashivaya!

412
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:12,879
Parameshwara! Where is Lord Shiva?

413
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,571
If we call Shiva once, You will give Moksha

414
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:20,401
If we utter you twice, you will be at spiritual debt

415
00:43:20,988 --> 00:43:23,697
Is this a spiritual debt or cruel?

416
00:43:24,844 --> 00:43:31,631
If my death gives your presence, I will sacrifice my head for you.

417
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:40,174
Hara Hara Mahadeva Shambhoshankara!

418
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:46,417
Hara Hara Mahadeva

419
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:22,126
Jaya Jaya Shankara Shiva Shiva Shankara

420
00:44:22,464 --> 00:44:25,437
Sada Shiva! Are you gracious on me?

421
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,930
I am lucky to see your presence here for me

422
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:34,670
Asura! Andhakasura!

423
00:44:35,595 --> 00:44:37,695
Your self-sacrifice made me to present here

424
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,288
What is the reason behind your meditation?

425
00:44:41,649 --> 00:44:44,542
Hey Neelakantha! You never give up your words

426
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,944
I am asking for my wish with a trust that you will accept it

427
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:51,277
Will you do it? What is you wish?

428
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:55,234
The lady born in Pancha Graha kutami with blessings of Goddess Parvathi

429
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,889
I want to marry her.

430
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,468
Promise me that you will not stop me

431
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:05,977
Thadhasthu (OK)

432
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:10,989
Thank you!

433
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:18,469
This should be stopped

434
00:45:22,904 --> 00:45:24,928
Mazare Maayi Mazare

435
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:31,580
I got it. I got what I want.

436
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:37,231
If I sacrifice that lady after the marriage, I can control 5 manifestations.

437
00:45:38,932 --> 00:45:44,346
Where is my beautiful parrot?

438
00:45:46,418 --> 00:45:52,651
Before going to see the parrot, there are many that you need to see

439
00:45:55,443 --> 00:46:00,405
Observe this pictures with concentration

440
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:08,425
Upcoming month will have Semi and full solar eclipse

441
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:14,865
Two solar eclipse occurring in a month is rare

442
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:24,883
The immediate rays after Semi solar eclipse will show you the lady

443
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:32,014
The full solar eclipse on end of that month is the day you are waiting for.

444
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:37,908
On that day you should form a 5 faced star in the sky

445
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:44,953
You should insist 5 manifestations Air, Water, Fire, Land, Sky in it.

446
00:46:45,704 --> 00:46:49,297
Doing so, you should not think that they are under you control

447
00:46:49,628 --> 00:46:56,218
The glorious mangalasuthra will come from sacrificial fire

448
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,996
Tie mangalasuthra on that lady

449
00:46:59,196 --> 00:47:05,684
After you marry her, you should sacrifice her head to the 5 faced star

450
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:12,763
This should be done in between start and end of full solar eclipse

451
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:13,564
Ok.

452
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:18,350
During this if anything goes wrong

453
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,985
What?

454
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:22,361
No, no one will stop me.

455
00:47:27,155 --> 00:47:30,661
When I am not there, You made a tent in front of my home

456
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:33,726
You made Bhajans and enjoyed on Shivarathri

457
00:47:34,355 --> 00:47:37,956
Oh my mother! How dare you are?

458
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:39,596
Not only that Malli.

459
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:44,613
They arranged an item song, response is super

460
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:46,978
Shut your mouth! You drunkard! - Hey!

461
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,322
So that we could get some grace

462
00:47:49,522 --> 00:47:53,748
You thought of grace. You are not afraid of me?

463
00:47:53,948 --> 00:47:55,479
If we have that much manners - Hey, stop man!

464
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:55,860
Hey!

465
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:59,580
Stop the nonsense and sing that item song

466
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,277
Come on sing. - Yes, sing.

467
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:02,777
Ok, I will get ready.

468
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:07,757
Where is Shivayya? Where is Shivayya?

469
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:10,671
He is settled in Kailasam

470
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:15,156
With beautiful flowers With pure milk

471
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:18,008
He gets abhishekam

472
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:20,052
Oh! What a talented singer.

473
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:22,308
Thank you Malli. - Keep it up man.

474
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:24,392
I tuned it myself to be new

475
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:26,974
I too want to give you a new kind of gift

476
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:28,188
Really? - Really!

477
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:31,168
Hey!

478
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:36,548
If I beat, it will be 50, but beating yourself will be 25

479
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,541
I myself do it Malli. - Ok.

480
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:41,116
One

481
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:43,740
Two

482
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,622
Why did she came here?

483
00:48:46,678 --> 00:48:48,442
Hai Sir! Congrats! Why madam?

484
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:49,210
Actually

485
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:53,074
Oh God! - What sir, he is beating himself?

486
00:48:53,274 --> 00:48:57,539
He is like Jesus to our colony. He hurt himself for mistakes of others

487
00:48:59,734 --> 00:49:01,024
Who is these people?

488
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,546
They came from Shanthi prashanthi social service organisation

489
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:05,998
Greetings sir! - Greetings!

490
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:10,039
Every year they Honour any 5 social workers

491
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:10,735
Ok

492
00:49:10,935 --> 00:49:12,349
They already selected 4 people

493
00:49:13,138 --> 00:49:15,608
As fifth person, I suggested your name

494
00:49:15,808 --> 00:49:16,495
Me? - Yes.

495
00:49:16,695 --> 00:49:19,564
If you want to honour, you can do it to my uncle

496
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:21,420
He is your uncle? - Yes.

497
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,842
Uncle! Stop it. It is enough.

498
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:27,322
As I am orphan, he took me to his home.

499
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:30,372
Tell her. - Yes. Yes.

500
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:33,422
He said me to stay in his home without rent

501
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:34,043
What do you say Uncle?

502
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:37,292
It is the talent. - Correct. Correct.

503
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:40,473
How you are feeling as a good person is getting award?

504
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:44,396
I am very happy madam. It is uncontrollable.

505
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:47,805
Importance of bell in temple is like Malli in this colony

506
00:49:48,347 --> 00:49:50,615
All will ring it, He will ring all of us.

507
00:49:50,815 --> 00:49:53,266
What? - Means, he takes care of us madam.

508
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,519
How do you feel sir?

509
00:49:56,264 --> 00:49:56,739
Ok, tell sir.

510
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:04,926
Why are you crying? Tell me sir.

511
00:50:05,573 --> 00:50:12,941
If it is one, we can say. But how can I say that many sweet memories

512
00:50:14,105 --> 00:50:16,981
Nirmala! Nirmala!

513
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:19,316
As a colony President, how are you feeling?

514
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,423
I want to die madam. - Hey!

515
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:23,040
It is with happiness.

516
00:50:24,537 --> 00:50:30,360
We have good attachment. He want to hear stories from us at night.

517
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,021
He will say many stories, but repeatedly and you can also come this night

518
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:36,973
We will feel so happy

519
00:50:37,992 --> 00:50:38,941
Hello! - Ok. Ok.

520
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:40,920
Is it?

521
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:42,401
What happened sir?

522
00:50:52,168 --> 00:50:55,044
Mahi, it is regular pain, but it is severe now

523
00:50:55,244 --> 00:50:57,569
She cannot handle the pain. So we gave an injection.

524
00:50:58,981 --> 00:51:00,565
Shailu! It will be ok.

525
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,532
I will die brother.

526
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:10,801
Do not say like that sister.

527
00:51:10,906 --> 00:51:14,913
As long as I am on bed like this, you will have no peace brother

528
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,515
So, I will die brother.

529
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:22,044
There will be some injections that can kill without pain

530
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:26,181
By giving that injection, kill me brother

531
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,090
Do not say like that sister, it is wrong

532
00:51:38,216 --> 00:51:39,987
Still how many days you will play with me?

533
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:45,373
You killed my mother, father and made me an orphan

534
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:48,053
You made my sister as handicapped

535
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:50,406
Now you are trying to snatch out her also?

536
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:52,937
What the crime I did?

537
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:56,782
At my childhood, holding you is the crime I did?

538
00:51:57,876 --> 00:52:03,129
Naming me as Mallikarjuna is the crime that did my parents?

539
00:52:03,936 --> 00:52:08,308
All will say that you can go every place in different looks.

540
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:13,940
Do not play hide and seek, come in front of me if you have dare.

541
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,796
I will see who will win. Come.

542
00:52:29,278 --> 00:52:31,885
I am not able to walk, why did you bring these anklets brother?

543
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,643
There will be some injections that can kill without pain

544
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:44,675
By giving that injection, kill me brother

545
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:27,328
As a pleasure to the globes

546
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:32,726
As a miracle to the directions

547
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,929
The person with glow moved to earth

548
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,486
As God shows mercy to all

549
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:43,667
Jaya Jaya Shankara! Shiva Shiva Shankara!

550
00:53:44,123 --> 00:53:46,459
The dancing feet of Nataraja

551
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:49,301
The feet touched by all the Gods.

552
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:54,683
The good can come from heaven to earth.

553
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:59,831
Jaya Jaya Shankara! Shiva Shiva Shankara!

554
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:07,891
God comes like a human

555
00:54:39,552 --> 00:54:41,291
Hey! Who brought me here?

556
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,309
It is me.

557
00:54:43,509 --> 00:54:45,975
Do you have sense? Why do you brought me here?

558
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:49,074
To make you alive, as you are in unconscious stage

559
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:51,996
He took care of you like your mother

560
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:53,528
But you are questioning him that, who are you?

561
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:55,687
He is the God who saved you

562
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,391
Sorry brother. I fired on you because of him

563
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:06,658
What is your name? - Sambaiah!

564
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:10,520
That is my name

565
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:13,878
From where you came? - kailasagiri

566
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:15,738
Family? - Yes.

567
00:55:16,516 --> 00:55:18,198
Two wives and two sons

568
00:55:18,563 --> 00:55:19,242
Where are they?

569
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:24,227
I got it. Family problems?

570
00:55:24,728 --> 00:55:27,750
Then come with me. - If you call, I will come.

571
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,782
1 minute. When you are unconscious, Maheshwari called you.

572
00:55:33,904 --> 00:55:36,783
She told that your sister is ok and she is healthy now

573
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:38,542
The very good news you told me Sambhaiah.

574
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:41,630
You cured not only the wounds on my body, but also sorrow in heart

575
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:47,778
Hey! A good news to you people

576
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,341
Do you got sugar? No, I did not.

577
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:55,311
Do you know what Malli did? He abused Lord Shiva like anything

578
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:56,798
Do you know what happened due to that?

579
00:55:57,135 --> 00:55:59,540
When he is going on road, he died in an accident

580
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,550
Hey! Malli is no more.

581
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,309
Oh God!

582
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:14,009
Hey! Malli

583
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:26,870
Shivam Shivam Ambrosia of life

584
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:30,276
Shivam Shivam Goodness

585
00:56:30,476 --> 00:56:33,799
Shivam Shivam greatness

586
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:36,370
Shivam Shivam Shivam

587
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,841
Shivam Shivam Relative as God

588
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:44,000
Shivam Shivam present here

589
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:48,542
Shivam Shivam the result of before life grace

590
00:56:48,898 --> 00:56:50,664
Come! Come on!

591
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:52,976
What are you celebrating like a festival?

592
00:56:53,725 --> 00:56:54,887
We are happy that you are coming

593
00:56:55,087 --> 00:56:57,623
Hey! Just now you said that you are happy because of his death

594
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,552
Do not mind his words as he is drunkard

595
00:57:02,196 --> 00:57:04,570
Who is he Malli? He is looking different.

596
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:07,702
He is the one who saved me. My friend, Sambhaiah.

597
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,407
He will be with me from today

598
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:13,717
He will be with you? - You should give the same respect as me

599
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:15,876
Ok? Sambhaiah come!

600
00:57:17,983 --> 00:57:22,811
Oh God! What is this? Already I have problem, again you created this another one

601
00:57:23,124 --> 00:57:24,462
What kind of things you are doing Shiva, Shiva?

602
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:27,807
Did you call me? - What is the need to call you?

603
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:30,870
What is the relation between us? I am talking to my Lord Shiva.

604
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:34,245
As Lord Shiva is killing him, but who are you to save him?

605
00:57:34,697 --> 00:57:36,256
Do you know who the owner of that house is? It is me.

606
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:39,047
I know how to send him out of the house.

607
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:46,068
He is rented in your house. Life is rented in your body.

608
00:57:46,903 --> 00:57:53,377
One day he from your house and life from your body should leave

609
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:58,486
I am not able to understand his single word

610
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:00,640
Hey President, have you understood anything?

611
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,763
He said that camels must be in desert

612
00:58:03,086 --> 00:58:05,124
When did he say camel? - He said it.

613
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:09,218
He said not the camel, it is our body

614
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:10,975
I am better than you. Stupid!

615
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,451
Brother! - What?

616
00:58:13,845 --> 00:58:18,632
You can take care of me and someone should be there to take care of you brother

617
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:19,599
Who will come sister?

618
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:22,578
Brother! If you marry, sister-in-law will come

619
00:58:22,778 --> 00:58:23,058
Marriage?

620
00:58:23,394 --> 00:58:26,741
Yes! I want sister-in-law like Doctor Maheshwari brother

621
00:58:34,905 --> 00:58:37,863
Not only we, but she should accept. Come on eat.

622
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:42,844
God! I am praising you since 15 years

623
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:47,099
You are not bother about me and even not thinking about me

624
00:58:47,299 --> 00:58:49,376
But I never changed the party God

625
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,642
Man himself has no way and is carrying a drum

626
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:56,402
Till we are not able to handle Malli and now another man had entered God

627
00:58:56,602 --> 00:58:57,986
What are all these problems God?

628
00:58:58,186 --> 00:58:58,869
Rudraksha!

629
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,803
What man, why you came inside?

630
00:59:03,003 --> 00:59:04,083
As you are feeling yourself in sorrow

631
00:59:04,283 --> 00:59:06,890
If I feel it, you will solve my problems or what?

632
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:10,736
I will talk with my Lord Shiva. Who are you? Go out.

633
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:14,567
Go. Get out

634
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:17,257
That is good.

635
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:25,281
I will not give you this holy water

636
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:28,655
Even Lord Shiva says, I will not give you the holy water

637
00:59:28,855 --> 00:59:29,917
What is the reason Rudraksha?

638
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:34,523
Reason, you came to temple but you are not saying greetings to God

639
00:59:35,778 --> 00:59:37,311
Did you ever greet yourself?

640
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:40,675
At least have you put 10 rupees in plate?

641
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:43,645
Why should I keep the money from this pocket into that pocket?

642
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:45,374
Money will be money, if it is in this pocket.

643
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:49,589
Hey! Come here. Do you know what he is talking?

644
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:52,745
He says, Gods must be crazy. He did not talking in English.

645
00:59:52,945 --> 00:59:55,189
You are not able to understand Telugu, And so that I said it in English

646
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:56,689
Hey! Move away. Hey! You hold it.

647
00:59:57,035 --> 01:00:00,655
Hey! What are you thinking about me?

648
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:04,271
Do not be emotional. - Wait man, I know how I am suffering.

649
01:00:04,471 --> 01:00:06,418
Early morning he will beat me and I should bare it

650
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:08,450
This man will preach me and I should bare it also.

651
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:16,183
You should vacate my house otherwise I will open my third eye.

652
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:21,064
Mr. Sambaiah, he will do it. So please go from here.

653
01:00:21,379 --> 01:00:25,166
Tell him to go away. - He is going from here.

654
01:00:25,564 --> 01:00:28,362
Mr. Shastri, I did not see ever your eyes like this

655
01:00:28,562 --> 01:00:30,407
Not now, you will see my another shade tomorrow

656
01:00:30,607 --> 01:00:33,035
Tomorrow no one should sprinkle water at your door

657
01:00:33,169 --> 01:00:35,036
I will do it with blood of Malli

658
01:00:40,865 --> 01:00:44,814
Hey Malli! Come out. Good or bad, we decide it today.

659
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,225
Lord Shiva! Why do you brought these people?

660
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:50,213
What is our profession and what are you doing?

661
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,055
Shut your mouth! I will beat you.

662
01:00:53,537 --> 01:00:55,148
Like you. - Hey! Come out man.

663
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:57,669
Will you come or otherwise should I come?

664
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:03,448
Why early morning you brought this comedy gang

665
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:06,161
Are they looking like comedians? They are the professional killers.

666
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:08,923
If I send them, they drink your blood like water

667
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,812
Why, they will not take tea or coffee?

668
01:01:11,012 --> 01:01:14,158
Hey! No more discussions. Play with him like ball

669
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:17,686
They have bats in their hands, but where is the ball?

670
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:19,682
Your head itself the ball. Come.

671
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:23,120
You fixed like that. Ok

672
01:01:27,135 --> 01:01:27,834
He himself dug the pit

673
01:01:28,195 --> 01:01:29,835
Shall we start the game? - Proceed.

674
01:01:32,476 --> 01:01:33,503
Oh God!

675
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:35,457
Oh God! Honey!

676
01:02:17,507 --> 01:02:21,444
Lord Shiva! Save me. Help me Lord Shiva.

677
01:02:22,266 --> 01:02:24,465
You saved Markandeya from Yama on that day

678
01:02:25,031 --> 01:02:27,257
Shivaiah! Now save me from Malli

679
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,682
Please save me God

680
01:02:30,418 --> 01:02:32,049
Om Namashivaya!

681
01:02:33,472 --> 01:02:34,184
Rudraksha!

682
01:02:39,287 --> 01:02:39,689
Oh!

683
01:02:43,146 --> 01:02:59,339
Jaya Jaya Shankara! Shiva Shiva Shankara!

684
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:06,139
You asked me to present once, Why do you feel tensed by seeing me?

685
01:03:06,857 --> 01:03:11,761
God! You came for me. Bless me God

686
01:03:11,961 --> 01:03:13,488
Do your wish came true Rudraksha?

687
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:18,619
I am lucky than the people who meditate for your presence

688
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:22,338
My life became quite peaceful

689
01:03:22,957 --> 01:03:26,680
As I am your priest, so you came in front of me

690
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:31,956
But that Malli is a cruel fellow and will abuse you all the time

691
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:36,762
If all the time he will abuse me, then every time he think of me.

692
01:03:36,962 --> 01:03:39,439
But he says that you killed his parents

693
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:43,317
Work is over, Life ended and they came into me

694
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:44,423
That is fate

695
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:47,942
He is not thinking like that God. - The day comes to think

696
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:48,881
Ok, God

697
01:03:49,379 --> 01:03:50,936
Malli will have a reasonable life

698
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,696
With his marriage, it will be good to the world.

699
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:56,800
To do that I came here

700
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:01,444
This is the secret of God Rudraksha, Only you know it.

701
01:04:02,891 --> 01:04:05,017
Thank you God!

702
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:09,153
Priest! Hey priest!

703
01:04:10,568 --> 01:04:13,222
I will not leave you today. Come!

704
01:04:14,614 --> 01:04:16,801
Sambaiah! Did you see him?

705
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:20,829
Get up! You are finished today.

706
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:27,329
Malli, I did a mistake. I will not do it again Malli.

707
01:04:27,896 --> 01:04:30,760
It is your home. I will cook anything for you.

708
01:04:31,275 --> 01:04:33,652
Even I will wash out the plate in which you eat Malli

709
01:04:34,448 --> 01:04:38,186
Take care of him.

710
01:04:38,543 --> 01:04:39,816
Om Namashivaya!

711
01:04:42,496 --> 01:04:46,004
Every time he will fall on my feet, but why he is falling on your feet?

712
01:04:46,204 --> 01:04:47,586
Have you showed him flashback of Basha?

713
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:52,307
He came to know the truth

714
01:04:54,406 --> 01:04:58,145
God! Till now we thought as a stone in the temple

715
01:04:58,345 --> 01:05:03,504
Low quality food, rice of Rs.2 per Kg, used palm oil to make sacrament

716
01:05:03,704 --> 01:05:08,932
As I knew you are the real, I am using No.1 quality God

717
01:05:09,223 --> 01:05:09,965
Come on have it.

718
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:13,032
The faith of Devotee Kannappa made me to eat meat

719
01:05:13,467 --> 01:05:16,007
Why all these for me? Do not say like that God

720
01:05:16,835 --> 01:05:21,086
While you are eating this sacrament, I want to see it and feel happy

721
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:25,333
If Malli comes, he will have this sacrament with his drink

722
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:27,704
Sambaiah! - That stupid came.

723
01:05:27,806 --> 01:05:28,379
Sambaiah!

724
01:05:30,231 --> 01:05:33,153
What Priest, why you kept the sacrament at the temple in front of Sambaiah?

725
01:05:33,353 --> 01:05:34,653
That God is present here itself.

726
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:37,928
I mean, God will be in human

727
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:41,015
As a human, Sambaiah saved you like God

728
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:44,281
Is it? I like this change in you.

729
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:46,075
Ok, carry on! - Thanks Malli.

730
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:50,335
Have it soon God, otherwise he will come again.

731
01:05:57,298 --> 01:05:59,093
Sambaiah! Will you have one peg?

732
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,632
What are you saying? Stupid! Your eyes will effect.

733
01:06:02,227 --> 01:06:03,880
Priest! I want to ask you one thing

734
01:06:04,437 --> 01:06:06,869
You are pressing the legs of Sambaiah who came now

735
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:10,026
I am in your house from a long time, have you ever do it to me?

736
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,375
You know only the legs of hen and goat

737
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:16,807
Everyone in the world will meditate to touch this legs only

738
01:06:16,927 --> 01:06:17,331
Is it?

739
01:06:18,304 --> 01:06:20,363
Sambaiah! You are treating me as your friend

740
01:06:20,747 --> 01:06:23,122
So, you need to know about me and my story.

741
01:06:23,322 --> 01:06:23,869
Tell me.

742
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,238
No God! You do not know about him

743
01:06:26,574 --> 01:06:29,445
After completing his story, at last he will abuse you and also beat me

744
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:41,712
Whose mistake is it?

745
01:06:42,426 --> 01:06:46,564
It is the fate. Fate of a person is like drama.

746
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:53,546
Always you say it as mistake of Lord Shiva, but now why you turn the plate?

747
01:06:53,746 --> 01:06:55,249
No, I do not turn the plate Om Namashivaya!

748
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:57,854
Sambaiah! You tell me.

749
01:06:58,282 --> 01:07:00,548
Mistake is of Lord Shiva

750
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,843
Ok, Should I abuse lord Shiva or not?

751
01:07:04,342 --> 01:07:06,313
Abuse him. I too will abuse.

752
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:09,347
A butcher who killed his son

753
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:10,717
Most butcher

754
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:13,531
An evil who killed the father of his wife

755
01:07:13,731 --> 01:07:15,039
Supreme Evil

756
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:20,991
Butcher who kills his own devotes

757
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:24,477
Cunning fellow

758
01:07:26,184 --> 01:07:31,518
Sambaiah! Lord Shiva did injustice to me

759
01:07:35,324 --> 01:07:44,088
Happy Friendship Day! Happy Friendship Day!

760
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:48,539
Malli! What is that celebration?

761
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,517
Sambaiah! Today is the Friendship Day.

762
01:07:50,998 --> 01:07:54,671
To show their friendship by tying the friendship band and tell the greetings

763
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:55,976
But no one tie it you?

764
01:07:56,176 --> 01:07:58,919
Do I have Mother on Motherís day, and Father on Fatherís day?

765
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:01,752
Then how can I have a friend on friendship day

766
01:08:02,086 --> 01:08:02,636

After the eclipse leaves temple will be washed and then opened

827
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:19,817
People who are born in Moola star have a lot of impact of this solar eclipse

01:14:20,017 --> 01:14:22,670
Yes baby even your star is the same

After eclipse you must take a dip in the temple pond water and visit the temple

830
01:14:28,419 --> 01:14:29,728
Our priest told this

831
01:14:30,081 --> 01:14:31,467
Eclipse rays

832
01:14:32,023 --> 01:14:36,456
Come, come show me the virgins place

833
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:40,979
Come, come out

834
01:14:45,197 --> 01:14:49,476
Come! Majare rays Majare

835
01:14:49,676 --> 01:14:51,880
That world evil must be erased, this is our oath

836
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,752
You had tempted the stone statue

837
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:55,939
This body is tempted after being like a stone

838
01:17:21,781 --> 01:17:24,131
What a surprise you came to a Shiva temple

839
01:17:24,331 --> 01:17:27,258
If a friend calls we must go anywhere said Sambaiah

840
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:28,032
Happy birthday

841
01:17:28,759 --> 01:17:29,152

01:17:30,052 --> 01:17:30,494

844
01:17:31,904 --> 01:17:32,623
I will just come

845
01:17:38,184 --> 01:17:38,865
Mahi

846
01:18:04,111 --> 01:18:06,516
Our target is not him, it is her

847
01:19:03,636 --> 01:19:05,255
Even if you kill us its ok

848
01:19:05,595 --> 01:19:09,251
Thousands of Agora will come from Kashi and kill Maheshwari

849
01:19:17,255 --> 01:19:17,763
Mahi!

850
01:20:14,806 --> 01:20:24,355
Go, go whoever lusts on you or whoever will harm you I will not leave

Majare Mahi Majare

853
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:16,625
Even if you kill us its ok, many agora will come from Kashi and kill Maheshwari

854
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:20,252
Their must be a reason for murder or attack

855
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:23,910
You do not have any enemies in personal or business life

856
01:21:24,502 --> 01:21:29,073
But then somewhere in Kashi agora are wanting to kill Mahi

857
01:21:30,184 --> 01:21:33,364
There should be a reason behind this

858
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:34,881
That is what even we are not understanding

859
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:35,770
Malli

860
01:21:37,754 --> 01:21:40,289
You had saved our daughter life with your life

861
01:21:41,135 --> 01:21:42,907
We cannot equal the favour you did in this life

862
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:45,867
From now on you are not an outsider but a person in our family

863

01:24:20,377 --> 01:24:29,451
The time should be stopped now like this

878
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:38,703
Friend, I change myself as garden if you come like a nightingale

879
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:48,107
Life, I wait for you like east if you reach as early morning

880
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:28,248
if you are tired, I will be caress for you

881
01:25:28,559 --> 01:25:38,102
If you are sleepy, I will be a lap for you

882
01:25:38,336 --> 01:25:42,696
You are on my lip line You are on saree lace

883
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:47,342
You are in curve of waist You are at everywhere

884
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:56,811
You became like a line on my palm...

885
01:25:57,289 --> 01:26:06,001
Friend, I change myself as garden if you come like a nightingale

886
01:26:06,799 --> 01:26:16,356
Life, I wait for you like east if you reach as early morning

887
01:26:40,847 --> 01:26:44,044
Harish Chandra Ghats

888
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:02,427
shivohum!

889
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:04,565
Om Namah shivaiah

890
01:27:04,765 --> 01:27:05,821
Sivahum bikshandehi

891
01:27:06,324 --> 01:27:09,466
Omitting that name is what makes you to beg

892
01:27:10,956 --> 01:27:12,571
Oh Telugu!

893
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:14,419
You are standing in front of him

894
01:27:14,889 --> 01:27:16,298
You are breathing the fresh air

895
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:18,543
Taking his name is irritating you

896
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:20,045
It is strange Siva

897
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:21,778
Do not take that name I said

898
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,579
There are many names for this body

899
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:26,925
But inside resides only Siva

900
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:30,053
If even that leaves it is only a dead body

901
01:27:31,224 --> 01:27:33,329
Where are the agora who eat this dead body

902
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:38,324
agora wanting to see them and approaching them is foolishness

903
01:27:38,911 --> 01:27:40,179
If you go there, you will never return

904
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:41,674
It is dangerous for your life

905
01:28:21,124 --> 01:28:23,573
An enemy has come here catch him!

906
01:28:52,107 --> 01:28:53,494
Do you want my life?

907
01:28:53,842 --> 01:28:56,274
I want to know why you want to kill Mahi

908
01:28:56,474 --> 01:28:57,518
What will you do after knowing?

909
01:28:58,093 --> 01:28:59,093
Will you save her?

910
01:28:59,996 --> 01:29:00,875
It is not possible by you

911
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:04,307
If you do not say, you will die in my hands

912
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,466
People in general are worried about life

913
01:29:06,666 --> 01:29:08,305
But agorae work to get liberated

914
01:29:08,505 --> 01:29:09,493
Ash marks are our defence

915
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:10,991
Dead bodies are our food

916
01:29:11,373 --> 01:29:12,690
Chanting Siva is our breathing

917
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,423
World unity and peace is our aim

918
01:29:14,764 --> 01:29:19,038
That is why, as the blessings of Parvathi to her we still want to kill Maheshwari

919
01:29:19,238 --> 01:29:21,696
What is world peace and why to kill Maheshwari

920
01:29:22,766 --> 01:29:26,430
If you want to understand all this, first you need to know the truth

921
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:31,098
One demon is still remaining whose name is Andhakasura from the evil world

922
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:33,705
Maheshwari is born in pancha graha kutami and that demon wants to marry her

923
01:29:33,905 --> 01:29:39,008
On a solar eclipse and sacrifice her to gain power over 5 manifestations

924
01:29:40,037 --> 01:29:43,102
If that happens world will be destroyed

925
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,852
We are trying it must not happen

926
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:46,134
If whatever you are talking is true,

927
01:29:46,334 --> 01:29:48,412
Than go and kill that demon, why do you want to kill Mahi

928
01:29:48,612 --> 01:29:50,245
We must kill Andhakasura?

929
01:29:50,693 --> 01:29:51,505
That is impossible

930
01:29:51,821 --> 01:29:53,814
We do not have power to kill him

931
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:58,264
He is a dangerous demon who has revengeful thoughts on all the gods and goddess

932
01:29:58,464 --> 01:30:00,928
He called that demon god onto the earth

933
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:04,331
That is why if we kill Maheshwari before he weds her

934
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:05,706
His aim will not be fulfilled

935
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,995
We have to kill Maheshwari for world peace

936
01:30:09,782 --> 01:30:14,900
For Mahi I would never mind taking and giving my life

937
01:30:15,553 --> 01:30:18,321
People come from other places to die in Kashi

938
01:30:18,603 --> 01:30:22,623
But you do not come to die with the intention of killing her

939
01:30:23,356 --> 01:30:25,095
If you come then you would die

940
01:30:33,596 --> 01:30:35,027
Why did you leave him master?

941
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:37,002
Let him do what he wants to do

942
01:30:37,976 --> 01:30:38,960
We will do what we want to do

943
01:31:09,261 --> 01:31:10,548
Majare Mahi

944
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:32,188
What a scent Youthful scent

945
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:46,855
Father

946
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:50,308
Father

947
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,837
Mahi! What happened?

948
01:31:54,037 --> 01:31:56,478
Some demon he looks very scary

949
01:31:57,089 --> 01:31:58,763
What happened? May be some nightmare

950
01:31:59,089 --> 01:32:00,029
It is not a nightmare

951
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:01,277
Get the ash

952
01:32:01,477 --> 01:32:03,722
It is all your imagination

953
01:32:06,018 --> 01:32:12,187
Marriage as soon as possible get Mahi married with a suitable boy

954
01:32:12,387 --> 01:32:14,396
All problems will get solved by itself

955
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:30,956
Your self looks are irritating you Andhaka

956
01:32:32,383 --> 01:32:40,494
Not even her any human being cannot like you looking at you

957
01:32:40,694 --> 01:32:44,563
Then I will marry her by kidnapping

958
01:32:44,763 --> 01:32:53,583
Sacrifice should be done if she loves you and marry

959
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:56,335
Then only your aim will be fulfilled

960
01:32:56,635 --> 01:33:01,401
So pamper her with your love

961
01:33:02,066 --> 01:33:04,777
Tolerate her with love

962
01:33:05,557 --> 01:33:11,431
With patience marry her

963
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:15,876
She is scared just by looking at me, its impossible

964
01:33:16,076 --> 01:33:18,424
It is possible Andhaka - How?

965
01:33:18,624 --> 01:33:22,125
Enter the body of the boy with whom she is about to wed

966
01:33:22,475 --> 01:33:27,761
Flirt with her and achieve your dream

967
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:34,072
For complete solar eclipse only 15 days are left

968
01:33:35,519 --> 01:33:38,276
These are all Kashi majili stories and you do not believe you think,

969
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,018
But those agora are having trust in it

970
01:33:41,297 --> 01:33:46,761
Before complete solar eclipse they will kill Maheshwari they said

971
01:33:48,025 --> 01:33:51,902
Save her from them and marrying her is your responsibility

972
01:33:52,102 --> 01:33:55,275
I like but Mahi should also like me

973
01:33:55,475 --> 01:33:57,024
Who would not like you Malli?

974
01:33:58,991 --> 01:34:02,487
If it is written there, the situations would join accordingly

975
01:34:02,687 --> 01:34:03,196
Malli

976
01:34:04,624 --> 01:34:05,130
Come, come

977
01:34:05,657 --> 01:34:08,000
You came at the correct time, we were talking about you

978
01:34:08,097 --> 01:34:08,584
How is Mahi?

979
01:34:09,166 --> 01:34:10,452
I came to talk about Mahi

980
01:34:11,075 --> 01:34:12,214
Greetings! Greetings!

981
01:34:14,902 --> 01:34:15,942
I had seen him somewhere

982
01:34:16,269 --> 01:34:17,440
You must have seen him in any temple

983
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:25,497
Mahi is not able to forget that dangerous event

984
01:34:26,496 --> 01:34:28,387
She is also sleep talking about this

985
01:34:29,946 --> 01:34:33,611
You had saved her life now give her the courage she needs

986
01:34:34,611 --> 01:34:41,115
If you do not mind, I want you to stay in my house for some days

987
01:34:41,315 --> 01:34:46,638
Do not worry I will come for Mahi

988
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,317
Ah these are all your plays

989
01:34:49,774 --> 01:34:51,556
You made him to come here god

990
01:34:52,634 --> 01:34:54,179
Will you also go with Malli

991
01:34:56,084 --> 01:34:57,643
Promise me Great god

992
01:35:00,318 --> 01:35:02,722
I promised so cannot go

993
01:35:03,171 --> 01:35:06,587
People who trust me and people whom i like

994
01:35:07,136 --> 01:35:09,008
I will do anything till great lengths

995
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:10,014
Mahi - Father

996
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:12,704
Malli is going to stay with us from now on

997
01:35:13,075 --> 01:35:13,667
Ok father

998
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,156
This is your room

999
01:35:15,759 --> 01:35:16,214
Beautiful

1000
01:35:17,949 --> 01:35:19,935
Let me know is it female or male demon

1001
01:35:20,135 --> 01:35:23,396
You always tease me, I was so scared you know

1002
01:35:23,596 --> 01:35:24,471
Now you do not seem to be scared

1003
01:35:25,155 --> 01:35:27,699
Now you came, do you like this room?

1004
01:35:28,337 --> 01:35:30,798
To tell the truth, if it my colony

1005
01:35:31,171 --> 01:35:36,323
After I reach my room, my group will come and say Malli have you come

1006
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:44,499
After that we start praying and take sacrament

1007
01:35:46,534 --> 01:35:49,666
Next? - My people say old stories

1008
01:35:50,054 --> 01:35:51,621
Long, long ago, there was a king

1009
01:35:51,976 --> 01:35:54,687
I talk about Ramayana and Mahabharata

1010
01:35:55,414 --> 01:35:55,949
After that

1011
01:35:56,448 --> 01:35:58,267
Only musical chanting

1012
01:36:00,043 --> 01:36:04,158
Chanting, my family likes chanting, from today do it here

1013
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:08,388
Here, we are mass and your people will not like mass

1014
01:36:08,802 --> 01:36:13,348
Our life happy go lucky life, but still I had to come here

1015
01:36:13,839 --> 01:36:16,331
If we like we should not feel the burden

1016
01:36:17,587 --> 01:36:19,202
Do you like me so much?

1017
01:36:19,846 --> 01:36:20,221
Yes too much

You took birth for me and I came for you

1060
01:41:39,267 --> 01:41:42,148
What uncle, Mahi seems not to recognize me?

1061
01:41:42,348 --> 01:41:44,660
Rahul she had seen you during young age

1062
01:41:47,721 --> 01:41:49,675
Mahi is feeling shy with the name of marriage

1063
01:42:01,465 --> 01:42:03,954
Malli I want you

1064
01:42:06,524 --> 01:42:07,641
I want you Malli

1065
01:42:09,064 --> 01:42:09,749
I am their

1066
01:42:43,049 --> 01:42:48,878
On the eyes, on the lampblack eyes giving a silent kiss

1067
01:42:49,844 --> 01:42:55,542
On the cheeks, on the ruby cheeks coming to have one more kiss

1068
01:42:56,265 --> 01:43:02,662
As slowly as the bee making noise asking the place for third kiss

1069
01:43:03,017 --> 01:43:08,960
Give it fast, it is compulsory telling the address of sweet lips in your ears

1070
01:43:09,499 --> 01:43:15,028
On the eyes, on the lampblack eyes giving a silent kiss

1071
01:43:16,036 --> 01:43:22,020
On the cheeks, on the ruby cheeks coming to have one more kiss

1072
01:43:48,987 --> 01:43:54,905
Move near me to live happy

1073
01:43:55,459 --> 01:44:01,863
Melting the dreams by heating such respect comes to an action

1074
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:08,356
I got you with the axe of beauty tempted me like butterfly of dotted wings

1075
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:14,741
Applied fire flowering time here and there made the fun of tickling

1076
01:44:15,236 --> 01:44:20,999
On the eyes, on the lampblack eyes giving a silent kiss

1077
01:44:21,793 --> 01:44:27,580
On the cheeks, on the ruby cheeks coming to have one more kiss

1078
01:44:56,351 --> 01:45:02,459
Touch me softly by your silly eyes as peacock eyes

1079
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:09,162
Feeling as another miracle and make me to burn

1080
01:45:09,442 --> 01:45:15,808
You are the dome I am the pigeon on you and I say, surroundings of heart is mine

1081
01:45:16,152 --> 01:45:22,316
You are the Gopika and wish in me I am your man for your full moon light

1082
01:45:22,705 --> 01:45:28,636
On the eyes, on the lampblack eyes giving a silent kiss

1083
01:45:29,233 --> 01:45:35,231
On the cheeks, on the ruby cheeks coming to have one more kiss

1084
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:38,311
See this dialogue director

1085
01:45:38,683 --> 01:45:40,543
Only having A/c toilet we cannot keep going their right

1086
01:45:40,743 --> 01:45:41,163
Super

1087
01:45:41,363 --> 01:45:42,152
Dialogue is super

1088
01:45:44,065 --> 01:45:45,566
Get coconut water I wish to wash hand

1089
01:45:45,766 --> 01:45:46,074
Camera

1090
01:45:49,266 --> 01:45:50,230
Cut

1091
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:52,442
Director did I act fine?

1092
01:45:52,642 --> 01:45:55,049
With this ad people must believe me

1093
01:45:55,249 --> 01:45:58,555
Thirty years industry here, if we make a shot everything will be flat

1094
01:45:58,755 --> 01:45:59,898
Thanks

1095
01:46:00,667 --> 01:46:01,603
Heroin Ileana where is she

1096
01:46:01,803 --> 01:46:02,538
She asked 1 crore

1097
01:46:02,738 --> 01:46:03,488
Did you tell my name?

1098
01:46:03,597 --> 01:46:04,061
She said she will not work

1099
01:46:04,881 --> 01:46:05,971
Who is the heroine?

1100
01:46:06,171 --> 01:46:06,742
Ileana dupe

1101
01:46:06,942 --> 01:46:08,496
Ready! Camera

1102
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:12,704
Who is this who came in between the shot?

1103
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:16,236
Who is this?

1104
01:46:16,436 --> 01:46:18,058
Pitch kaki a big director Malli

1105
01:46:18,258 --> 01:46:21,953
For our Ring raja ring ad he is using our talent

1106
01:46:22,153 --> 01:46:23,453
Then I would like to see your talent

1107
01:46:23,653 --> 01:46:24,303
Greetings

1108
01:46:25,106 --> 01:46:28,911
Once my life was full of anxiety and bad luck

1109
01:46:29,225 --> 01:46:31,249
It was worst for a bad luck

1110
01:46:31,577 --> 01:46:39,344
My friend called me and suggested me to wear a ring given by Goke ring raja

1111
01:46:39,544 --> 01:46:42,078
All your problems will be solved

1112
01:46:42,755 --> 01:46:45,634
He gave me this ring

1113
01:46:46,287 --> 01:46:47,711
My life has changed

1114
01:46:48,095 --> 01:46:56,881
Samarasimha reddy, Narsimha naidu, Manmadhudu, Mass, Tagore,Sholay,Titanic

1115
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:05,281
I got a chance to write script and dialogues for these films, hail Ring raja ratnalayam

1116
01:47:06,476 --> 01:47:07,056
How did I tell?

1117
01:47:09,902 --> 01:47:11,265
What did you do for those movies?

1118
01:47:11,756 --> 01:47:13,774
I copied those scripts Malli

1119
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,603
Today you all might think I look handsome like Shahrukh khan

1120
01:47:21,157 --> 01:47:23,966
But three years before I was like this

1121
01:47:26,162 --> 01:47:27,426
He is me

1122
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:28,285
Yes

1123
01:47:29,991 --> 01:47:31,357
You cannot believe this right

1124
01:47:31,617 --> 01:47:32,236
It is true

1125
01:47:33,035 --> 01:47:35,464
People used to hate me calling me dwarf

1126
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:38,227
Small children would throw stones at me

1127
01:47:38,585 --> 01:47:44,758
That is when I consulted Sri sri sri Goke ring raja ratnalayam and wore this ring

1128
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:47,322
From then my height has increased till here

1129
01:47:49,108 --> 01:47:50,551
Hey shahrukh khan come here

1130
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,048
You too come here

1131
01:47:53,706 --> 01:47:55,323
If you him who are you

1132
01:47:55,559 --> 01:47:57,719
Audience do not bother on logic for ads Malli

1133
01:47:58,178 --> 01:48:00,281
Do you think audience are fools?

1134
01:48:04,664 --> 01:48:08,765
Stone in pulses, stone in slippers, stone in grinder, stone in kidney,

1135
01:48:08,965 --> 01:48:13,536
Stone in temple and stone in heart, so life is linked up with stone

1136
01:48:13,736 --> 01:48:18,493
That is why I say everything is stone and anything is stone Ring is stone

1137
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:24,047
These stone are from Himalaya which I could not distribute to you

1138
01:48:24,383 --> 01:48:26,364
But I gave them to my disciple Ringu raja

1139
01:48:26,739 --> 01:48:27,798
Boy ringu

1140
01:48:27,998 --> 01:48:28,423
Swamy

1141
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:29,957
Please bend

1142
01:48:34,087 --> 01:48:35,052
Where is he

1143
01:48:35,393 --> 01:48:37,092
He is lucky he is not here

1144
01:48:37,566 --> 01:48:40,458
I am here Malli - He is the most bad luck fellow

1145
01:48:41,732 --> 01:48:43,170
How much did you get paid for this character?

1146
01:48:43,464 --> 01:48:43,783
They gave me full

1147
01:48:43,983 --> 01:48:45,309
He refused to work when given half

1148
01:48:47,276 --> 01:48:49,041
I thought you cheat only in colony

1149
01:48:49,461 --> 01:48:52,164
But with this ad you want to cheat whole state?

1150
01:48:52,364 --> 01:48:53,058
Do you want a ring Malli?

1151
01:49:24,259 --> 01:49:24,822
Good morning

1152
01:49:25,022 --> 01:49:25,472
Good morning Malli

1153
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:27,173
I want to talk to you

1154
01:49:27,693 --> 01:49:27,969
Tell

1155
01:49:28,599 --> 01:49:29,638
Maheshwari and me

1156
01:49:34,438 --> 01:49:37,501
Hello yes, yes I will call you later ok

1157
01:49:37,987 --> 01:49:38,712
Tell Malli

1158
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,076
Me and Maheshwari - Hubby

1159
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:49,098
Hubby

1160
01:49:51,388 --> 01:49:53,060
We do not know how it happened brother

1161
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:06,595
On that day agora tried to kill our daughter

1162
01:50:07,141 --> 01:50:10,199
Today our dogs died whom we love a lot

1163
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:14,330
Noticing all this I feel something wrong is going to happen to this house

1164
01:50:15,159 --> 01:50:19,116
Some bad powers are seen very clearly

1165
01:50:19,968 --> 01:50:20,919
Show me the groomís astrology

1166
01:50:26,991 --> 01:50:29,877
What is this you are showing me a dead manís astrology

1167
01:50:31,907 --> 01:50:35,669
Dead manís astrology? He is presently in our house swamy

1168
01:50:35,869 --> 01:50:38,363
Impossible, he died two days earlier

1169
01:50:44,173 --> 01:50:47,094
If this astrology is true, his life is a lie,

1170
01:50:47,436 --> 01:50:50,831
If his life is true than this astrology is wrong

1171
01:50:58,926 --> 01:51:03,897
Uncle what is this you are alone and thinking something

1172
01:51:07,165 --> 01:51:12,019
To fix your marriage date, I showed your astrology to swamy

1173
01:51:12,756 --> 01:51:17,613
He told that you had died two days before

1174
01:51:20,478 --> 01:51:24,556
I am in front of your eyes. If I died, how did you believe uncle

1175
01:51:24,912 --> 01:51:32,040
I do not understand whether to believe that truth or watching this truth Rahul

1176
01:51:33,075 --> 01:51:35,173
Swami never tells lies

1177
01:51:35,790 --> 01:51:42,373
We cannot disregard his words and get you married with Mahi

1178
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:54,911
You go back to America Rahul, Sorry

1179
01:51:59,015 --> 01:52:06,756
Vishwanatham I did not come here to go away

1180
01:52:07,342 --> 01:52:10,718
I came here to marry your daughter

1181
01:52:12,199 --> 01:52:20,393
That old man told you about the dead person but did he not tell about the living me?

1182
01:52:21,922 --> 01:52:26,525
You did not fix marriage date but you fixed death date for you

1183
01:52:27,076 --> 01:52:31,025
I will not leave, I will not leave anybody who comes in my path

1184
01:52:31,369 --> 01:52:31,887
Who are you?

1185
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:33,826
Will you see?

1186
01:52:45,353 --> 01:52:49,197
Asura Andakasura

1187
01:52:49,853 --> 01:52:51,942
Rajeshwari! Malli!

1188
01:52:52,965 --> 01:52:55,498
Rajeshwari!

1189
01:52:55,698 --> 01:53:03,161
Nobody would hear your cries and screams

1190
01:53:38,646 --> 01:53:41,322
Majare mama Majare

1191
01:54:55,779 --> 01:54:57,949
Hubby! Father! Malli!

1192
01:55:15,326 --> 01:55:16,107
Doctor

1193
01:55:16,824 --> 01:55:17,424
Now he is ok

1194
01:55:18,748 --> 01:55:24,135
Because he got hurt in the brain he can only see and hear

1195
01:55:25,231 --> 01:55:27,352
Cannot say till how long he would get better?

1196
01:55:28,293 --> 01:55:31,390
After 4 days take him home and get his treatment at home

1197
01:56:15,123 --> 01:56:15,655
Mahi

1198
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:18,379
Everybody in this family thinks I am a lucky star girl

1199
01:56:18,965 --> 01:56:21,574
But I am not a lucky one but an unfortunate one

1200
01:56:22,477 --> 01:56:25,036
Everything which is happening at home is because of me

1201
01:56:26,055 --> 01:56:29,240
Do not cry, mad girl

1202
01:56:32,943 --> 01:56:36,373
Malli, take me to temple tomorrow

1203
01:56:36,883 --> 01:56:37,302
Temple?

1204
01:56:38,963 --> 01:56:42,695
Want to make special prayer ritual on father's name, please Malli

1205
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:44,537
For me

1206
01:56:47,937 --> 01:56:49,143
You want to go to temple right

1207
01:56:51,997 --> 01:56:54,528
He is there in your heart

1208
01:56:56,059 --> 01:56:58,751
Yes Rahul, I wish to marry Malli

1209
01:57:00,237 --> 01:57:03,835
Before I could tell this matter in family, this happened to father

1210
01:57:06,529 --> 01:57:07,964
Please understand me Rahul

1211
01:57:08,505 --> 01:57:12,953
Is she trusts, likes and marries

1212
01:57:13,153 --> 01:57:17,613
then only your aim will be successful after sacrifice

1213
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:34,887
Congratulations Mr Malli, Mahi told me everything

1214
01:57:36,767 --> 01:57:38,516
Mahi selection super

1215
01:57:39,290 --> 01:57:41,571
Very soon I want to see your marriage and leave to America

1216
01:57:43,221 --> 01:57:46,289
Now shall I also join with you guys to temple?

1217
01:57:46,489 --> 01:57:47,594
What is there, come!

1218
01:57:56,605 --> 01:58:00,806
The one who drives correctly will also drive life smoothly

1219
01:58:01,006 --> 01:58:02,306
My Mahi is a lucky girl

1220
01:58:03,237 --> 01:58:05,669
The day I came here you must have told this

1221
01:58:05,869 --> 01:58:07,574
That day itself matter will be closed

1222
01:58:08,686 --> 01:58:10,382
Things happen whenever it has to happen

1223
01:58:10,582 --> 01:58:13,935
You do not know what is going to happen now

1224
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:27,373
What happened Malli?

1225
01:58:27,573 --> 01:58:27,914
Break failed

1226
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:30,296
Jump off

1227
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:32,039
Without you - jump off

1228
01:58:32,992 --> 01:58:34,224
You jump out I am telling you

1229
01:58:34,424 --> 01:58:35,319
Than how about you? - You too jump off

1230
01:58:37,153 --> 01:58:37,586
No

1231
01:58:54,141 --> 01:58:55,208
Nandi!

1232
01:59:00,134 --> 01:59:46,094
(Sacred chants of Lord Shiva)

1233
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:05,819
Malli

1234
02:00:18,465 --> 02:00:20,442
Go Rahul, immediately leave to America

1235
02:00:21,606 --> 02:00:25,095
After listening to this incident, if anything must have happened to you

1236
02:00:25,957 --> 02:00:27,550
No boy leave immediately

1237
02:00:28,737 --> 02:00:37,429
Aunt I have come here not only to share your happiness but also to share your sadness

1238
02:00:40,904 --> 02:00:42,719
Do not feel bad uncle

1239
02:00:43,213 --> 02:00:44,834
I will not go, let anybody say anything

1240
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:48,327
Mahi will marry me

1241
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:54,096
I will not leave until your dream comes true uncle

1242
02:01:02,985 --> 02:01:05,843
We love each other and will also marry

1243
02:01:06,743 --> 02:01:09,510
Do you think I will leave after listening to this?

1244
02:01:11,133 --> 02:01:16,267
I am giving you only one option, leave Mahi and this house and go away

1245
02:01:17,317 --> 02:01:17,643
If not

1246
02:01:26,347 --> 02:01:28,064
Do you think he is a fool?

1247
02:01:28,823 --> 02:01:30,875
What are you thinking about my character?

1248
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:36,440
I seem to be smooth and sweet, but you are acting too much

1249
02:01:37,086 --> 02:01:38,826
I will show you dirty picture

1250
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:43,363
See if you shake me you will not find an idiot like me

1251
02:01:43,748 --> 02:01:49,084
Till I am their you cannot touch her nor her dress

1252
02:01:50,237 --> 02:01:53,622
You gave me only one option, but I am giving you two options

1253
02:01:56,201 --> 02:01:59,560
One is pack your bags and go away to America

1254
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,381
Other one is I will beat you and send your pieces in a parcel

1255
02:02:05,436 --> 02:02:08,959
Hey Swati muthyam, Mahi is mine

1256
02:02:10,926 --> 02:02:13,987
I am going to marry Mahi

1257
02:02:22,061 --> 02:02:24,828
What is the back support that you have so much guts

1258
02:02:26,258 --> 02:02:27,333
Are you scared Malli

1259
02:02:28,521 --> 02:02:30,381
I was never scared of death Sambaiah.

1260
02:02:30,938 --> 02:02:33,375
I am thinking only about my sister

1261
02:02:33,705 --> 02:02:38,242
I am your friend here do not worry about your sister

1262
02:02:38,813 --> 02:02:40,934
Take care of Maheshwari so that she does not face any troubles

1263
02:02:42,364 --> 02:02:46,486
For complete solar eclipse only 4 days are remaining

1264
02:03:15,524 --> 02:03:18,246
Parameshwara!

1265
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,028
Andhaka!

1266
02:03:26,617 --> 02:03:28,620
Why this urgency and cry

1267
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:33,167
This is aggression from my heart

1268
02:03:33,367 --> 02:03:33,860
Reason

1269
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,881
You - Me?

1270
02:03:36,081 --> 02:03:42,327
To marry Maheshwari you promised me that you will not come in between

1271
02:03:42,731 --> 02:03:46,140
Yes whatever you asked I have granted

1272
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:52,339
Then why did you save Malli who came in my way

1273
02:03:53,744 --> 02:03:56,093
To save a devotee is the duty of God

1274
02:03:57,001 --> 02:04:01,968
Is he more than me I cut of my head and gave you

1275
02:04:02,431 --> 02:04:05,742
Your devotion is selfish for worldís destruction

1276
02:04:06,294 --> 02:04:09,460
But his devotion is selfless for world peace

1277
02:04:10,569 --> 02:04:14,185
What is the meaning for the promise it is waste

1278
02:04:15,197 --> 02:04:16,824
I promised that I will not come in your way

1279
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:20,944
But you did not ask me not to help him

1280
02:04:21,144 --> 02:04:24,385
Oh what is this manipulation while talking?

1281
02:04:25,564 --> 02:04:30,842
You are also like that Vishnu who talks and cheats this Andhakarasudu

1282
02:04:32,447 --> 02:04:34,400
Do not play with me

1283
02:04:35,292 --> 02:04:37,730
Siva! I am telling you again

1284
02:04:38,288 --> 02:04:43,206
According to the word you gave me let me finish my goal

1285
02:04:43,581 --> 02:04:46,715
Till that time do not help that Malli

1286
02:04:48,381 --> 02:04:50,849
Andhaka! The name is coming true to you

1287
02:04:51,808 --> 02:04:55,115
For your self-mistakes, are you blaming me?

1288
02:04:57,696 --> 02:04:58,869
My mistake

1289
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:07,526
The boy you killed is the same boy who is grown up to be Malli

1290
02:05:07,726 --> 02:05:08,793
Impossible

1291
02:05:08,993 --> 02:05:10,636
I killed him on that day itself

1292
02:05:10,998 --> 02:05:12,085
That is your ignorance

1293
02:05:24,937 --> 02:05:29,608
To marry Mahi he took birth along with the help of fate

1294
02:05:30,490 --> 02:05:36,565
The main cheater, your whole true self is seen now

1295
02:05:37,823 --> 02:05:41,956
Maheshwara, till now I am your devotee

1296
02:05:42,764 --> 02:05:45,330
From this moment you are my enemy

1297
02:05:45,971 --> 02:05:48,715
Till now you just saw my devotion

1298
02:05:49,556 --> 02:05:52,937
From now on you will see my revenge

1299
02:05:54,041 --> 02:06:01,202
Not even you, those crores of gods will also be not able to stop me against Malli

1300
02:06:02,117 --> 02:06:06,476
After I kill him I will marry and kill Maheshwari

1301
02:06:08,316 --> 02:06:14,332
Take control of five manifestations and rule over 14 lands

1302
02:06:18,668 --> 02:06:20,516
Bad thinking will drag to destruction

1303
02:06:45,163 --> 02:06:45,839
Brother

1304
02:07:03,227 --> 02:07:06,779
Brother see this as you wished I am able to walk

1305
02:07:16,524 --> 02:07:18,756
Malli your dream has come true at last

1306
02:07:19,104 --> 02:07:19,732
How did it happen?

1307
02:07:19,932 --> 02:07:21,446
It is a miracle in medical field

1308
02:07:21,646 --> 02:07:24,929
Whether you believe it or not its gods saved your sister

1309
02:07:25,795 --> 02:07:26,832
My lovely girl

1310
02:07:28,083 --> 02:07:30,151
Swami has come back from Kashi

1311
02:07:30,763 --> 02:07:34,441
As our aunt told let us go and talk about Mahiís wedding and decide

1312
02:07:57,815 --> 02:07:58,948
Vishwanatham!

1313
02:08:03,423 --> 02:08:04,814
Swamy

1314
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:10,980
Vishwanatham got a grooms astrology to me

1315
02:08:11,236 --> 02:08:12,969
Yes he is my nephew Rahul's

1316
02:08:13,259 --> 02:08:15,831
Immediately Maheshwariís marriage has to be done with him

1317
02:08:16,824 --> 02:08:18,878
I told this to Vishwanatham

1318
02:08:19,404 --> 02:08:24,025
But before he could tell this that evil power has made him like this

1319
02:08:25,574 --> 02:08:26,566
Evil power

1320
02:08:26,942 --> 02:08:29,723
This house is controlled by an evil power

1321
02:08:30,617 --> 02:08:36,583
To wade of this evil power Maheshwari must get married to him on solar eclipse

1322
02:08:37,859 --> 02:08:38,827
Marriage on eclipse day swamy?

1323
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:42,085
She took birth at the time of Panchagraha Kutami

1324
02:08:42,581 --> 02:08:44,981
She must be married on solar eclipse day

1325
02:08:46,666 --> 02:08:47,430
It is not that swamy

1326
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:47,984
I know

1327
02:08:48,529 --> 02:08:50,240
I know what is in your heart

1328
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,390
If this marriage does not take place

1329
02:08:53,218 --> 02:08:58,718
Everybody will die one after the other and will become a graveyard

1330
02:09:00,703 --> 02:09:02,837
No swamy, do not tell that

1331
02:09:03,716 --> 02:09:07,452
What ever happened till now is too much for us to cope

1332
02:09:08,556 --> 02:09:12,947
If anything happens to this family I cannot bear

1333
02:09:13,597 --> 02:09:14,843
We cannot bear

1334
02:09:19,651 --> 02:09:22,442
As you told we would make Mahi and Rahul to get married

1335
02:09:23,159 --> 02:09:25,122
Immediately we will marry them off

1336
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:29,344
Do not worry about that, evil power I will take care of it

1337
02:09:29,982 --> 02:09:31,868
You take care of marriage

1338
02:09:32,418 --> 02:09:32,851
Marriage?

1339
02:09:36,667 --> 02:09:37,681
Did you come again Malli?

1340
02:09:39,276 --> 02:09:39,716
Wait their

1341
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,437
For any evil power there should be a back bone

1342
02:09:44,188 --> 02:09:48,318
The evil power which is powered by is him

1343
02:09:51,781 --> 02:09:53,365
Old man brain is damaged I think

1344
02:09:53,565 --> 02:09:54,836
Stop your nonsense

1345
02:09:55,296 --> 02:09:55,662
Swamy

1346
02:09:55,862 --> 02:09:56,281
I know

1347
02:09:57,708 --> 02:10:00,458
Incidents happening in this house is because of him

1348
02:10:01,932 --> 02:10:04,948
agora attacking on Maheshwari is because of him

1349
02:10:05,619 --> 02:10:08,019
Reason behind dogís death is him

1350
02:10:08,895 --> 02:10:10,481
He is the reason behind car accident

1351
02:10:11,117 --> 02:10:14,320
Reason behind Vishwanathamís accident is also him

1352
02:10:14,666 --> 02:10:16,518
Him!

1353
02:10:16,718 --> 02:10:17,311
Stop it

1354
02:10:18,625 --> 02:10:21,589
you are shouting on me?

1355
02:10:21,789 --> 02:10:23,381
What are you thinking about me?

1356
02:10:24,087 --> 02:10:27,979
Growing moustache and beard and wearing saffron robe will make them fear.

1357
02:10:28,179 --> 02:10:34,585
I am not like them, Malli mass perfect mass

1358
02:10:35,702 --> 02:10:39,482
Innocent people like them are there to believe in you fake baba

1359
02:10:39,682 --> 02:10:41,618
You keep cheating people

1360
02:10:41,818 --> 02:10:43,472
Cheating is yours or mine, I will prove it

1361
02:10:44,011 --> 02:10:46,464
I will show the proof between you and that evil power

1362
02:10:46,664 --> 02:10:49,105
I will show them all about your true colours

1363
02:10:49,305 --> 02:10:50,381
You all, come with me

1364
02:10:53,903 --> 02:10:54,261
See

1365
02:10:57,947 --> 02:10:58,506
Sambaiah

1366
02:11:03,475 --> 02:11:04,516
You see with your eyes

1367
02:11:04,716 --> 02:11:07,442
Hey if you talk about him anymore I will kill you

1368
02:11:07,642 --> 02:11:08,486
Whom do you think he is?

1369
02:11:08,686 --> 02:11:09,504
My friend Sambaiah

1370
02:11:09,704 --> 02:11:11,182
Listen everybody, listen

1371
02:11:11,382 --> 02:11:13,559
That evil power is his friend it seems

1372
02:11:13,759 --> 02:11:15,330
Yes swamy he is Malliís friend

1373
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:16,204
A very good person

1374
02:11:16,404 --> 02:11:17,751
That is what you know

1375
02:11:17,951 --> 02:11:20,356
But I will prove you what kind he is

1376
02:11:20,556 --> 02:11:20,902
Ask him to come

1377
02:11:21,787 --> 02:11:22,095
Come

1378
02:11:23,629 --> 02:11:24,012
Sambaiah

1379
02:11:26,521 --> 02:11:27,774
Why are you in this graveyard?

1380
02:11:28,939 --> 02:11:30,985
This old man is talking something madly about you

1381
02:11:31,185 --> 02:11:32,117
What are you doing here?

1382
02:11:33,141 --> 02:11:34,854
Everything is happening right in front of your eyes

1383
02:11:35,054 --> 02:11:36,193
I will make him tell the truth

1384
02:11:36,613 --> 02:11:40,941
You are wearing dead body ash is it yes or no

1385
02:11:43,609 --> 02:11:47,107
Devils and demons are in your control yes or no

1386
02:11:50,012 --> 02:11:55,187
You have a real face behind this yes or no

1387
02:11:55,895 --> 02:11:56,258
Yes

1388
02:11:57,699 --> 02:11:58,864
Now did you understand?

1389
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:04,595
I have come to protect this family from you and showed your true self

1390
02:12:07,831 --> 02:12:11,225
See how I am going to make you a scape goat in this drama

1391
02:12:22,875 --> 02:12:28,747
Maheshwari do not believe this bad man

1392
02:12:33,649 --> 02:12:38,848
Cheater why did you don as a friend to cheat

1393
02:12:39,846 --> 02:12:44,216
You saved my life and I gave more importance to you like a brother

1394
02:12:45,221 --> 02:12:48,151
Now if you do not leave I do not know what I would do

1395
02:12:48,351 --> 02:12:49,134
Go, go away

1396
02:12:50,581 --> 02:12:54,981
I came for you, you called I came now you ask me to leave I will leave

1397
02:12:57,528 --> 02:13:04,172
Hey not even you, I do not want anything that belongs to you

1398
02:13:35,919 --> 02:13:36,643
Is this all true

1399
02:13:36,972 --> 02:13:39,216
I do not know what is true and what is a lie?

1400
02:13:40,185 --> 02:13:41,239
But one thing is true

1401
02:13:42,309 --> 02:13:43,312
You are my life

1402
02:13:43,512 --> 02:13:45,473
Enough what ever happened it is enough

1403
02:13:46,586 --> 02:13:49,082
From now on do not even look at our Mahi

1404
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:51,433
Do not even come near our house

1405
02:13:51,655 --> 02:13:51,935
Come dear

1406
02:14:03,676 --> 02:14:09,025
Now you are single and Mahi is mine

1407
02:15:09,768 --> 02:15:11,594
Did you come to know the truth?

1408
02:15:23,615 --> 02:15:25,057
Aunt he is killing me

1409
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:27,637
Malli

1410
02:15:27,837 --> 02:15:28,162
Malli

1411
02:15:32,119 --> 02:15:32,668
Hey Bahadur!

1412
02:15:33,940 --> 02:15:35,718
Malli! Leave him

1413
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:40,385
Rahul has anything happened to you

1414
02:15:40,585 --> 02:15:41,997
He is not Rahul as you are thinking

1415
02:15:42,197 --> 02:15:42,817
He is a demon

1416
02:15:46,035 --> 02:15:47,608
