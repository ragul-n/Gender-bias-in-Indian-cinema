2
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,671
'ls it a meteor?‘

3
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:54,816
'Or a jungle creeper, on the path?‘

4
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,585
'What lies ahead?‘

5
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,630
'This world is extremely mysterious'

6
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,806
'A mysterious opportunity'

7
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:31,437
'Unknown future, as vast as a sea'

8
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,755
'The grasp of an Octopus'

9
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:48,804
'The grasp of an Octopus'

10
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,854
'The speed of a deluge'

11
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:06,372
'To be a mirage in deserts'

12
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,958
'Is it a shadow?
Is it a memory?‘

13
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:34,288
'The grasp of an Octopus'

14
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,272
To fly up so high,

15
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,430
And you're trying to play
Kabaddi with that dad's son?

16
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,193
Is she jumping around
with her baby bump?

17
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,075
She had a slight pain.

18
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,548
Only after that, we'll
know what it is.

19
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,037
Do one thing. You take care of things
there. I'll start from here in 10 minutes.

20
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,137
- Shall I hang up?
- Okay.

21
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,846
Oh! That's great.
How's Molly doing?

22
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,174
All right, bro!
I shall let Veerappa know this.

23
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,196
Your outgoing facility is
temporarily disconnected.

24
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:22,988
Sunny!

25
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,009
I'm in the labour room, Sunny.

26
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,481
I want to see you now, Sunny!

27
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,688
And doctor said that the next
contraction would start after one hour.

28
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,879
Didn't we tell the doctor that we don't
need a normal delivery, Mollykkutty?

29
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,862
I'm not able to talk.

30
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,198
She always hangs
up while I'm talking.

31
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,924
- Doctor, I am Sunny.
- Sunny?

32
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,131
Doctor, since Mollykkutty
has some complications,

33
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,929
Well.. I...

34
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,985
Aren't you coming
to see the babies?

35
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,211
- Okay Doctor.
- Have a safe journey.

36
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,714
To see that irritating
female in the next cabin?

37
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,180
They have cut the outgoing calls of my
personal phone, since I didn't pay the bill

38
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,292
Where to, sir?

39
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,505
Around 700.. something.

40
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,702
Shouldn't you take it much
in advance, my dear Lakshmi?

41
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,962
What is this, Veerappa?
Always fiddling on the phone like kids.

42
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,240
The company has spent lakhs
of Rupees on luxury cars,

43
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,193
- Get in! Come on!
- Okay!

44
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,472
And since it's a special day for Madam
& you, I'll take you within 7.5 hours.

45
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,908
The fear of looking down from
great heights. What is it called?

46
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,330
Veeru!

47
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,999
I think it's a deep
ravine below us.

48
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,778
My bones are all
broken into pieces.

49
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,165
He got transferred
to Thrisshur, right?

50
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,508
no one would ever suspect you!

51
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,079
He is really intelligent, sir.
(in Tamil)

52
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,740
I'm not from here, sir!

53
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,571
The bank has sent a notice to
repay the loan I took from them.

54
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,319
Yes. I've found one way.
It might work out.

55
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,236
and that the person would die,

56
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,275
Even though I borrowed
money on double interest,

57
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,847
Hello!
- Sunny!

58
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,230
Pain started for Mollykkutty,
and she's in the labour room now.

59
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:45,196
Oh! Was that you,
wearing a brown jacket?

60
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,957
I know that you won't forget that brown
jacket so soon, since you paid for it.

61
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,993
I felt like someone
was indicating that.

62
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,182
You knew about my
Delhi transfer!

63
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,591
Don't you know that I don't have the
influence there to cancel a transfer?

64
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,737
You're scared that I'll be a burden, as
you're stepping into fatherhood, right?

65
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,211
shouldn't be shattered like this.
That's not how I consider you.

66
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,373
Do you know what I felt
during that night?

67
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,074
That night,

68
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:46,869
Hello!

69
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,000
- This is Naina's word! You wait & watch!
- Hello?

70
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,822
She has even reached Mongolia now!

71
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,017
No! Have you heard of Kunnamkulam?
It's on the Kunnamkulam border.

72
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,571
Dude, I didn't actually sing for her.

73
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,179
While everyone else was singing,
you also sang?

74
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,889
Well, just the two of you
were there that night.

75
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,366
- Tell me, sir.
- It's nothing.

76
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,443
If she likes a
person or an object,

77
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:11,366
she started breaking the
line of control of intimacy.

78
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,061
She wants me to orbit
around her like a satellite.

79
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,847
Well, would Madam do anything
drastic, because of this?

80
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,601
Veerappa, the love of a woman is like
the salt shaker at Indian Coffee House.

81
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:32,481
Hey!

82
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,087
- Huh?
- It's lying next to the accelerator.

83
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,341
Help!

84
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,635
Help!

85
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,904
Don't punish me like this just
because I didn't pay the bill once.

86
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,734
Scaring me unnecessarily!

87
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:30,892
Why?

88
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,282
Veeru!

89
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,794
God understood that those who
came to listen to the speech,

90
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,811
I'm not the one who will
benefit from it. It's you!

91
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,420
Chatting will end up in cheating.

92
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,201
Like monkeys used to do long back.

93
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:09,819
So this generation is going back to
being monkeys, who are our forefathers.

94
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,664
he doesn't sleep or eat.
He gets really frustrated.

95
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,501
Do all that, and you will
gain back your wisdom.

96
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:49,673
I myself will have to see this generation
jumping from one tree to another.

97
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,306
then they will have one black tea,
and walk straight to the Church.

98
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,279
But now?
Everyone just leaves in a car.

99
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,739
Well, I'm asking because
I have no clue...

100
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:26,460
Hot black coffee and buns are ready
next to the Church building.

101
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,732
When I said that I want to call Sunny,
Doctor gave me his phone,

102
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,313
I have to meet him in
detail once I get there.

103
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,457
When are you going to
take me to Mongolia?

104
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:41,322
Well.. It's really risky to go back
to Mongolia again, Mollykkutty.

105
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,722
I mean.. China's infiltration
is getting stronger there.

106
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,808
Most of them here
are praying hard.

107
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,228
Can you give me a clue?

108
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:41,796
'I waited for you, with a thousand eyes'
(Classic Malayalam song)

109
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,278
Has she learned music?

110
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,155
Yours and Madam's long wait
will be over today, right?

111
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,788
Finally, my Mollykkutty is going to
be a mother when she's 35 years old.

112
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,896
I took care of her as if
she were a little child.

113
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,981
Help!

114
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,597
It always keeps changing.

115
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,711
That means, a day that's suitable to buy
anything that doesn't die. Understood?

116
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:34,023
But no bank would accept diamonds
as mortgage. That's really sad.

117
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,010
Do you know who invented 'Zero'?

118
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,982
It's us who invented
martial arts too.

119
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,719
Each gem lies almost
100-150 miles below us,

120
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,650
When she gets angry,
Goddess Earth erupts as volcanoes.

121
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,662
after experiencing the heat of the
lava that Goddess Earth expels.

122
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,659
But now, each stone in this,
has the scent of blood.

123
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,944
Each gem stone is like
a man and a woman.

124
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,891
You're on a different level, sir.

125
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,354
Veerappa...

126
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,159
But those British thieves stole that
from us when they left from here.

127
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,456
But they have to be born in a
respectable family for that!

128
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,489
and you were born on
the same day or what?

129
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,274
Hey! Tell me the matter.

130
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,933
since my daughter
talked to me properly.

131
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,576
The money lenders came home and
took all the stuff from there.

132
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,899
She will also have
anger and frustration.

133
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,620
Even if you didn't meet me,
couldn't you at least call & tell me?

134
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,070
No need of anything, sir.
I've arranged all that.

135
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,444
After a long time, tomorrow...

136
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,995
' She's a gem, my beloved,
a little girl with a pure heart '

137
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,704
' She's a darling, a sweetheart,
a dame whom anyone would desire'

138
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:48,297
' Jasmines bloom when she smiles '

139
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,974
' She holds an umbrella of yellow flowers,
dressed in a green skirt '

140
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,915
' There are all kinds of flowers
in the garland on her chest '

141
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:54,979
' She's a gem, my beloved,
a little girl with a pure heart '

142
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,043
Like that!

143
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,379
This is a forest.
Animals will be disturbed.

144
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,818
Why is that?
Animals don't like music or what?

145
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,730
Forest board says that animals
won't like it if we play music.

146
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,406
I've bought something else.

147
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,790
Elephant?
- Yes.

148
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:12,940
Where?

149
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:21,248
Me too.

150
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,167
Hello?

151
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,363
Someone is following us, sir.

152
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,138
There are gems worth 5
crores in this box, sir.

153
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,948
But there's no one
in front of us, or behind us.

154
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:33,923
Should I drive?
- No, sir.

155
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,099
This has also died!

156
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,062
I hope no one calls me now.

157
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,240
I'll climb the Malayattoor Hill
barefoot for three consecutive years!

158
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:00,902
Pull over.

159
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,261
I doubt whether the car
broke down somewhere.

160
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,738
Pass the phone to the doctor.

161
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,376
I can't let this go on like this.

162
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,975
What the hell do you want to tell her,
apart from what I said?

163
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,324
My phone must have lost its signal.

164
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:37,898
Will you tell her?

165
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:49,335
Sir is checking the woman
who's right next to me.

166
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,836
It's not him who should be
sitting outside the labour room.

167
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,795
If my brother has taken 2 Lakhs
from you, he will return it.

168
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,298
Ask him to call me urgently!

169
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,866
I just asked to see whether
he's around, my dear.

170
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:38,814
Are you alone?
- No.

171
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,280
I'm scared of even hearing
about those dense forests.

172
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:33,575
Hello? Hello Sunny?
Hello? Hello Sunny?

173
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,799
Sunny, can't you hear me? Hello?

174
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:48,748
Sunny, can you hear me? Sunny?

175
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:15,202
Hello?

176
01:07:41,877 --> 01:07:42,514
Veeru!

177
01:08:55,418 --> 01:08:56,965
If my body is hurt,
you know me, right?

178
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:36,128
Our car had an accident.

179
01:09:42,498 --> 01:09:46,468
our car is hanging on top of
the ravine near Kerala border.

180
01:10:02,518 --> 01:10:03,883
Hey, come on!
This is not a joke.

181
01:10:04,186 --> 01:10:05,107
I can't hear you!

182
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:16,037
We met with an accident &
we're stuck here. Please!

183
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:24,261
You're avoiding me
on purpose, right?

184
01:10:32,982 --> 01:10:33,801
Right?

185
01:10:42,124 --> 01:10:43,170
And what did you say then?

186
01:11:29,171 --> 01:11:32,914
But I didn't notice that you entered a
fantasy world, somewhere down the line.

187
01:12:22,925 --> 01:12:24,085
The Sunny I know...

188
01:12:33,235 --> 01:12:34,304
Now let me also see...

189
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:44,098
Naina!

190
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,379
Stop!

191
01:14:07,363 --> 01:14:08,261
Jesus!

192
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,044
If a car skidded down, it should
be around here somewhere, right?

193
01:14:27,883 --> 01:14:29,168
This was done by an elephant.

194
01:14:48,837 --> 01:14:49,906
Well, brother...

195
01:15:17,366 --> 01:15:18,355
Brother, be careful.

196
01:16:08,984 --> 01:16:11,942
I survived and conquered
everything, because of my bravery!

197
01:16:18,127 --> 01:16:21,460
This father of yours stopped
it with just a spear!

198
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:31,111
I didn't cry out loud!

199
01:16:40,382 --> 01:16:44,068
I sentenced a life-span
of 30 days for him!

200
01:16:49,591 --> 01:16:52,571
I pulled the cartridge
with this finger!

201
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:02,838
Even though he came charging at me
with the pain of a wounded cranium,

202
01:17:08,377 --> 01:17:13,735
He closed his eyes & died, only after his
tusk that took my eye, came under my feet.

203
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:25,804
Don't you brag to your friends
that your dad is like Tarzan?

204
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:34,662
stop shedding tears
and get up & go!

205
01:19:49,171 --> 01:19:51,651
As my babies are being born,
I'm going to die.

206
01:20:12,027 --> 01:20:13,073
and went away himself.

207
01:20:34,282 --> 01:20:37,410
Have you seen Tom
Hanks' movie 'Cast Away'?

208
01:20:45,193 --> 01:20:47,081
The heroes of all these movies,

209
01:20:54,202 --> 01:20:55,043
Hey!

210
01:21:04,579 --> 01:21:05,864
They were all movies!

211
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,888
After some time, I also
have to become like you.

212
01:22:17,385 --> 01:22:18,204
Get it for me!

213
01:22:47,582 --> 01:22:48,867
Pick up the phone!

214
01:24:22,377 --> 01:24:23,196
Sorry.

215
01:24:33,154 --> 01:24:34,223
Happy Birthday
Rupen.

216
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:42,717
If you guess it correctly,
I'll buy you a beer.

217
01:24:49,237 --> 01:24:51,660
Oh no! My money is gone!

218
01:25:00,448 --> 01:25:01,403
Not just this..

219
01:25:08,556 --> 01:25:11,013
So I can gift it to her,
and also put an end to her strife.

220
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,856
Time flies so fast!

221
01:25:34,349 --> 01:25:36,681
She will be really happy
when she gets this, sir.

222
01:25:44,526 --> 01:25:46,574
not even her own mother.
She has no one!

223
01:25:54,102 --> 01:25:56,900
To slice their own sister since she
married from a different caste,

224
01:26:01,443 --> 01:26:04,048
there happened to be some
rabid dogs running around.

225
01:26:31,339 --> 01:26:34,137
I'll buy another cake
for Rupen tomorrow.

226
01:26:44,085 --> 01:26:45,313
He will come close to you.

227
01:27:49,017 --> 01:27:49,836
Come to the other side.

228
01:28:09,571 --> 01:28:10,936
Like that..
Come on!

229
01:29:11,332 --> 01:29:12,253
Get me the phone!

230
01:29:51,372 --> 01:29:52,191
You!!

231
01:31:39,947 --> 01:31:40,766
What do you think?

232
01:31:59,233 --> 01:32:01,098
Keep your differences
with Veerappa aside.

233
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:13,235
Well.. Did you check the GPS?

234
01:32:19,554 --> 01:32:21,602
Shall we inform the police?

235
01:32:41,142 --> 01:32:42,393
...who is going to emerge victorious?

236
01:32:51,452 --> 01:32:52,817
You are little children..

237
01:33:00,828 --> 01:33:03,922
What I'm going to say now, you should
open your ears & hear it loud & clear,

238
01:33:12,106 --> 01:33:16,315
- You don't think about these poor
women, sitting on your left.

239
01:33:21,449 --> 01:33:23,258
and spends some of that
money at his home.

240
01:33:31,425 --> 01:33:33,939
So there's a rhythm to
his life like that.

241
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:45,550
when she hears that a
girl has been born.

242
01:33:51,846 --> 01:33:55,031
It's so much nicer to see girls going
to school, wearing good dresses,

243
01:34:00,988 --> 01:34:05,732
Then, from age 15 to 20-22,
it's a good time for her.

244
01:34:25,413 --> 01:34:26,232
Stop it, Father!

245
01:34:46,534 --> 01:34:47,319
So be it.

246
01:38:11,906 --> 01:38:14,045
The lady who was lying next to me..
Her child died, Sunny!

247
01:38:23,818 --> 01:38:25,183
So they're taking me
also for the surgery.

248
01:38:34,462 --> 01:38:35,770
Even if! die, it's okay.

249
01:38:44,205 --> 01:38:45,843
This long wait of
suffering all that pain,

250
01:38:54,882 --> 01:38:57,123
I want to see you
once more, Sunny!

251
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:06,114
Even if I won't be there,

252
01:39:15,002 --> 01:39:17,653
Our children should
never be naive like me.

253
01:39:25,212 --> 01:39:26,611
Always a hero, like you!

254
01:39:35,823 --> 01:39:38,132
Pray that nothing should
happen to me and our children.

255
01:40:05,853 --> 01:40:09,072
'Oh my beauty'

256
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:19,465
'When did we meet for the first time?'

257
01:40:21,502 --> 01:40:27,941
'The Mynah bird lined its eyes'

258
01:40:29,343 --> 01:40:35,407
'And kept watching from a distance'

259
01:40:52,433 --> 01:40:55,709
'Oh my beauty'

260
01:40:56,270 --> 01:41:06,521
'When did we meet for the first time?'

261
01:41:44,918 --> 01:41:49,833
'My eyes have grown tired,
waiting for you'

262
01:41:58,866 --> 01:42:02,017
'The river has thinned like a thread'

263
01:42:06,473 --> 01:42:09,749
'The ferry is empty again'

264
01:42:14,114 --> 01:42:20,940
'Spread love to this wounded heart'

265
01:42:22,022 --> 01:42:28,404
'Tell me, my beloved,
about your burning desire'

266
01:42:35,569 --> 01:42:38,845
'Oh my beauty'

267
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:49,529
'When did we meet for the first time?'

268
01:42:51,518 --> 01:42:57,957
'The Mynah bird lined its eyes'

269
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:21,060
'Didn't I sew a dress for
you with golden threads?'

270
01:43:22,282 --> 01:43:25,467
'Oh my beauty'

271
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:35,877
'When did we meet for the first time?'

272
01:43:38,565 --> 01:43:43,343
'Oh my beauty'

273
01:43:59,987 --> 01:44:02,501
the vehicle should have crossed this
road, at least 3-3.5 hours back.

274
01:44:12,232 --> 01:44:13,335
There's no chance for that.

275
01:44:50,437 --> 01:44:51,859
once you cross the
Kerala check-post.

276
01:44:57,177 --> 01:45:00,453
the balance 10 Lakhs for
you to repay your debts,

277
01:45:18,031 --> 01:45:20,511
your daughter will never
talk to you again!

278
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:49,221
Fearing that Sunny,
what if Veerappa...

279
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:08,093
I know that you wouldn't
dare to mess around with me.

280
01:46:15,088 --> 01:46:16,828
Consider that this
is for the good.

281
01:46:44,017 --> 01:46:45,973
That bloody Palani guy's
phone is still switched off.

282
01:46:53,393 --> 01:46:55,031
The place we saw earlier, right?

283
01:47:01,234 --> 01:47:04,601
Now don't say that you're
scared of this and that.

284
01:47:44,211 --> 01:47:46,076
Until then, I hope
this doesn't die.

285
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:14,905
Veeru?

286
01:48:35,095 --> 01:48:36,380
Oh my God!

287
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:15,170
You escaped, huh?

288
01:50:38,318 --> 01:50:40,502
I would have become the
father of 2 children by now.

289
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:51,114
Veeru!!

290
01:57:47,013 --> 01:57:47,968
Who?

291
01:57:48,247 --> 01:57:49,111
Me?

292
01:58:16,209 --> 01:58:20,009
Now we have so many stories
to tell them, right?

293
01:58:38,998 --> 01:58:40,636
Let us both narrate
that story together.

294
01:58:46,472 --> 01:58:49,976
Let us both narrate that story in
which we earned them like pearls.

295
01:59:00,153 --> 01:59:01,017
Call for you!

296
01:59:28,314 --> 01:59:30,054
I called you several
times to say that.

297
01:59:48,334 --> 01:59:50,791
...destiny appointed you,
to inform the police!

298
01:59:58,111 --> 01:59:59,772
If you weren't there,
I...

299
02:00:18,798 --> 02:00:19,753
Anyway...

300
02:00:36,916 --> 02:00:37,780
Is that necessary?

301
02:01:25,865 --> 02:01:26,968
At the same moment,

302
02:01:35,975 --> 02:01:37,112
Is it the hand of God?

303
02:01:47,053 --> 02:01:50,011
why did He leave my
other hand free?

304
02:03:03,963 --> 02:03:05,658
Still, I am taking her with me.

305
02:03:23,349 --> 02:03:25,510
Your dad really wanted to
get these back for you.

306
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:35,324
Dad!
