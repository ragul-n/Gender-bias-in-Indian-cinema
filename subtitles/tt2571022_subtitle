1
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,920
Sultan Malik Shah, Daniel Stanley...

2
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,080
Hans Raj Jain, Pravin Randhawa...

3
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,440
One man with different
names and the...

4
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,280
most wanted terrorist of the world.

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,120
Mumbai Cycle bomb blast,
Bangalore Science Conference attack.

6
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,960
He has committed so many crimes,
they're difficult to count.

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
He's the most wanted
Interpol accused...

8
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
and the most influential person.

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,120
I tried to arrest him
twice but he escaped.

10
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,880
He's a very clever and
dangerous criminal.

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,080
A small mistake from our side can...

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,720
lead to deaths of many people.

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
According to the information
received from top official...

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,920
he's coming to Mumbai for
his daughter's marriage.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,560
This is the house of his
son-in-law to be.

16
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,280
There are four ways to reach here.

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,240
Devakar and I'll be
at the taxi lane.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,080
Rane and Shinde will be here.
- Yes sir. Copy that.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,080
And Patel will be at this spot.
- Alright sir. Over.

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,120
All our men will be on high
alert in this area.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,720
Our sharp shooters will be present
on all tall buildings.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,720
To reach his son-in-law's
house Malik...

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,640
has to come to this circle for sure.

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,840
So, we will be parked her.

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,200
Stay alert. Once we trace him...

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,560
unleash hell.

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,560
Four cars are coming.

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,160
This is Afzal. Malik's right hand.

29
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,120
So Malik should be here
at any moment.

30
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,040
Sir, all of us are ready.

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,160
Copy that.

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,960
This must be his car.

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
This is Malik.

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Shit!

35
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Come on, move from here.

36
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't fire. I said stop firing.

37
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,960
Malik, come out.

38
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
Surrender. It's all over now.

39
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,640
I have not met you since long.

40
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,200
How are you?
- Stop.

41
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,640
Leave about my condition.
Look at your condition.

42
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Hands up.

43
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
Hello. Today, in a shoot-out...

44
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,360
terrorist Malik Shah was killed.

45
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,280
Terrorist Sultan Malik Shah who...

46
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,920
was most wanted for a long time...

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,200
was shot at by ACP Anwar
and his team in Mumbai.

48
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,600
He was wanted all over the world...

49
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
Friends, today I saw a girl.

50
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,240
She is stunning.
- Look.

51
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,400
That ruffian Malik killed
seven of our people.

52
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,720
The breaking news of shoot-out
is being shown...

53
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,000
and he's thinking about that girl.
- Hey, she's gorgeous.

54
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,600
Till today I haven't seen
such a girl in Mumbai.

55
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,240
He and his men...
- Hey, I've seen this man.

56
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,800
The shoot-out took place in
front of me. - This...

57
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,120
Did you see him?
- Yes, buddy.

58
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,360
First you said you saw
a girl and now...

59
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,800
you're saying that you saw Malik.
Are you making us a fool?

60
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
I'll explain.
First you switch off the TV.

61
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
Swear and say the truth.
- Have I ever said lies?

62
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,640
Okay tell me.

63
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,640
I had gone to ATM to withdraw money.

64
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,280
It was raining.
Lightning took place.

65
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,720
Because of your cheap story
my chips fell down.

66
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,600
Hey, when I opened the door
to get out then...

67
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Look.

68
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,720
Hello, how much time?

69
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,720
I don't know whether he was
withdrawing money...

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
or was printing notes.

71
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,040
Do you want to withdraw money?

72
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,520
It's because of the rain.
Give me your umbrella.

73
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
Why are you thinking so much?
I've just asked for the umbrella.

74
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,720
Shree, what are you doing here?

75
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,160
Are you alright?
- I'm absolutely fine, uncle.

76
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,520
I had come to the ATM.

77
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,400
Are you fine?
I hope you aren't hurt.

78
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,960
I guess I am alright.

79
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,120
Who is he?

80
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,920
Oops.

81
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,960
I don't know him, uncle.
I just met him.

82
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,280
Hi, I am Chandru.
- Shreela.

83
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,120
Shall we go?
- Okay.

84
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,320
Kumar, just drop her home.
- Okay, sir.

85
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,400
He must have dreamt at night and
now he's making a fool of us.

86
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Listen...

87
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,880
Why does everything happen with you?
- What are you doing?

88
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,560
Tell us. - Stop. - Catch him. - Hey,
give it to me.

89
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,240
Throw it here.
- Here. - Come. - Please.

90
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,280
Her card is there and I can
meet her with its help.

91
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,520
Do you want the card? - Please.
- Are you a Bollywood hero...

92
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,400
that you can save your lover...

93
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,880
from among the most
wanted terrorists.

94
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,880
Do you think yourself
to be Superman?

95
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,160
There is nothing else to tell.
He just kept on flirting.

96
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,080
Okay, tell the truth.
Was he handsome?

97
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,640
Not at all. Typical road side Romeo.

98
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,760
Hey, are you blind?
- There is "Learning" board.

99
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,160
Hey. I am a driving instructor.

100
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
First learn how to drive
the car yourself.

101
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,840
Show all these signals at home.

102
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,200
She thinks he can teach me.

103
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,320
Leave this rowdy and tell
me about that handsome.

104
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Bloody mood off.

105
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,880
You could have taken someone.

106
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,520
Shahrukh, did you bring it?
- Got it, Pa!

107
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,080
Uncle, wear this model.
It's very comfortable.

108
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,920
Okay.

109
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
Anwar told me that you'd a narrow
escape in that shoot-out.

110
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,720
Father, nothing has happened to me.
Chill...

111
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,040
Uncle, you've become super star.
- Yes, yes...

112
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
Look,
today you're on every news channel.

113
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,280
He was the most wanted terrorist.

114
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,680
Is this a beauty contest?

115
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,800
Now it's fine.
- Can I've a black coffee?

116
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,960
Okay.

117
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,600
Make a cup of tea for me, child.

118
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,040
Eesha, where have you kept sugar?

119
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
You're asking from
the wrong person.

120
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,560
She hasn't entered
kitchen even once.

121
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,120
I'll come and help you.
- Shreela...

122
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
extra sugar for me please.

123
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,720
At least learn to make a cup of tea.

124
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,120
Next month is your marriage.

125
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,520
I am feeling pity on Imran.

126
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,440
Tell me one thing.
Who was that boy in the morning?

127
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,760
Hmm. That loser.
- Yes.

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,680
I saw him for the first time today.
I met him at the ATM centre.

129
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,760
He saved me in the shoot-out.
- Okay, okay...

130
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,800
Don't think anything wrong, uncle.
- Okay.

131
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,200
You have nice hair.

132
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
All this is magical. Beware.

133
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,960
Mumbai girls are very smart.
- Is that so? Look at her.

134
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,320
They look good from far.

135
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,560
They apply a lot of make up
and talk great things.

136
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,360
I'd seen a beautiful girl.
- Correct. - She was sweet.

137
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
Are you saying the truth?

138
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,560
Look there.

139
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,400
Sexy.

140
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,680
Just imagine how she'll
look in night dress.

141
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,080
Because 90% girls wear
night dress at home.

142
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,720
I am totally confused.

143
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,840
There may be so many girls...

144
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,160
but my Shreela is the best.
- Oh God, he has started again.

145
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,480
He's still stuck there.
He's of no use now.

146
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,600
Hey, she's the same girl.
- What happened? - Where is she?

147
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Hey, same girl. Look there.
- Listen.

148
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,000
Where is he? - Hey, look there.
Hey, the ATM hero.

149
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,440
Hey, Shreela.
- Come on let's go from here.

150
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,720
Hey, wait. - Why are you
behaving so weird? Stop.

151
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,880
Hey, that one in yellow dress.
- Yes that one. - Hi.

152
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,640
He is really handsome.

153
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,400
He wants to talk to you.
- Hey, hello.

154
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,960
Don't push me friend.
- At least wait.

155
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,520
Hey wait.

156
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Bye.

157
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,400
Look here.
He'll be following you...

158
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,160
Next month is your marriage.
Have you forgotten that?

159
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,200
That is why I'm saying to let
me flirt before marriage.

160
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,040
Just like a driving test.

161
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,480
You have gone mad.

162
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,680
Before the husband.

163
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,200
Times are really bad. Oh God!

164
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,960
Chandru.
- Brother isn't up, ma'am.

165
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
He is sleeping.

166
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,480
Chandru, get up son.
It's already 9 O'clock.

167
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,040
From last three days you
haven't had a bath.

168
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,800
You haven't brushed properly.

169
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,760
Chandru, I've to go to office
and I'm getting late.

170
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,560
Chandru.

171
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,160
Coming, grandmother.

172
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,040
Chandru,
what is the name of that girl?

173
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Shreela.

174
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,760
I knew it from the smile
on your face?

175
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,600
How many days now?

176
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Excuse me. Anybody here?

177
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,320
Yes, I am coming, madam.

178
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,080
In five minutes I'll be back
after handling the customer.

179
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,640
Don't touch the camera. Understood.
- Yes.

180
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,760
He is so handsome.

181
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,720
You...

182
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
He is very cute.

183
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,960
How did he get on the TV?

184
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,960
He is really a rowdy.

185
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,960
If I tell uncle, then he'll put
him in jail and beat him.

186
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,880
Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.

187
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,560
We've just shifted here so we
need a cable connection.

188
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,040
You need a connection.
You've come at the right place.

189
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,760
I shall first show
you the quality...

190
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,640
then I would've personally come
to give you the connection.

191
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,760
What do you watch on cable?

192
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,800
Hey, where has this stupid come?

193
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,760
Madam, this is technical fault.

194
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,480
Madam, you do not go anywhere.

195
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,280
I'll just be back after
repairing the cable.

196
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,080
Nonsense, you will ruin my business.

197
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,680
You are live...
- Live...

198
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,520
No one knows how many people
must have seen you.

199
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,000
Ruffian, apologize to everyone.

200
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,200
Hi. Hi, Shahrukh.

201
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,240
Huh?
- Shreela... - Sorry.

202
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,800
I don't know whether you're watching
this program or not...

203
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,040
but do you remember me?

204
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,720
Chandru, we met at the ATM.
Handsome boy.

205
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
Handsome? Stupid fellow.

206
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
You left your card there
so I've kept it.

207
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,680
Card...
- This cable TV owner is my friend.

208
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
What was I about to say?

209
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,960
Yes. I've to return this card
to you but how should I do.

210
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,600
I shall give you my number.
You call up and take your card.

211
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,560
Phone number. Hurry up.
- Where is the card?

212
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Take this.

213
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,400
Note it down. Number 9.

214
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,640
You're holding it upside down.
- Oh no.

215
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,400
9819600605.

216
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,080
Okay, okay.

217
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,680
You'll ruin my business.
- Sorry, buddy.

218
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
It just happened by mistake.

219
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320
Ruffian,
you'll make us land in trouble.

220
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,480
He's shouting as if he's popular
as BBC. - Phone, phone...

221
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,280
Hey, it's my phone...

222
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,160
Hello.
- Hi sweetheart, it's me. Shreela.

223
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,760
Shreela? So soon.
- Shreela. - Hey, that was quick.

224
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,960
Hey, what are you doing? Sorry.
I just gave the message...

225
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,240
and you called so soon.
- Why are you talking to him?

226
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
Hang up.
- Shut up...

227
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,920
Shut up? Sorry... shut up...

228
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,680
No, no I was saying this
to my friend. - Hey!

229
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,200
Okay, shall we meet?

230
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,400
Uh... okay.

231
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
Tomorrow morning at 10 at Costa
coffee. - This is too much.

232
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,040
Costa coffee? Which one?

233
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,120
Linking Road.
- Linking Road, okay.

234
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,320
Okay sure.
- Okay. - I'll be there.

235
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,960
You... what's you problem?
- It's a date.

236
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,840
No, it's not a date. Stop it, Eesha.

237
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,360
Did you all see?
I got the connection done.

238
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,200
Thank you, buddy. It was real fun.

239
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,960
Hi.

240
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,280
You look stunning.

241
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,240
Is this the best pick-up
line you got?

242
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,480
Yes, no...

243
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,160
This is for you.

244
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
What will you have?
Cappuccino, Fapucinno...

245
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,560
Coffee, tea, biscuits and...
- Just coffee.

246
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,520
Okay, okay...

247
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,520
One cappuccino and one espresso.

248
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,120
Are you trying to be a hero?

249
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,880
No. - Then what were you
doing on TV yesterday?

250
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,800
Do you think you are too funny?

251
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
No.
- Love at first sight.

252
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,360
No love happens at first sight.
Understood, you stupid.

253
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,640
You got flowers for a girl with
whom you just spent 5 minutes.

254
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,360
Spend this money at a better place
and you'll get blessings.

255
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,800
That's deep.

256
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,240
Anyway, you'd come for this.
So take it.

257
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,480
There is no need to say thanks. I...

258
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,400
Thanks.

259
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
Hello, drink the coffee at least.

260
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,080
Hello.

261
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,520
Driver, will you take me
to RTO office? - No.

262
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
Driver, will anyone of you
take me to RTO office?

263
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,880
No, I won't go.
- Even I won't go.

264
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,920
Rickshaw. RTO office.
- No, sorry.

265
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Hello! Hello, madam.

266
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,760
No one take you except me.

267
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,440
Yes,
keep the bag in between for safety.

268
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,360
Come on. No taxi will go
because of RTO office.

269
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,600
You can go by bus.
Better come with me.

270
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
She is coming. She is coming.

271
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,640
Hey, from where have you come?

272
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,120
RTO officers will take your license.
You'll be caught.

273
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,160
Driver, take me to RTO office.

274
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,240
Shreela, this is wrong.

275
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,600
At least give me your visiting card.

276
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,280
I gave you back your ATM card.

277
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,840
Thank you. - Let's go,
brother. - I'll call you.

278
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,640
With what name shall
I store her number?

279
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,160
Baby. No.

280
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,160
Sweetie. No.

281
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,920
Beloved? What a stupid name?

282
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,520
Shreela. Yes Shri.

283
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,280
Shri.

284
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,840
Hey, oh...

285
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,360
Hello, uncle. Sir.

286
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,520
The market is going to rise.

287
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,000
Hey, stop the taxi.

288
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Rickshaw.

289
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,080
Hey, who are you?

290
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,600
Follow that taxi.

291
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,960
But why do I have to do it?

292
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,400
It is a matter of love.

293
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,920
Oh, it's a matter of girl.

294
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,520
Hey, follow quietly.

295
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
Sir.
- I'm getting down. Wait. - Sir.

296
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,480
The card is stuck.

297
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,000
A young boy is begging.
Country's economy is so worst.

298
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,160
Sir.
Sir, what are you doing? Rickshaw.

299
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,200
Yes, I am close to office.

300
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,560
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
- Hello, sir. Nice to meet you.

301
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,560
Hello. - Your foot, sir... - What
are you doing? What happened?

302
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,640
The same guy, you know.

303
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Hey Romeo, who will pay the fare?

304
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,680
Hey mister.

305
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,520
Hello. Hello.

306
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,480
Hello, Singh!
- Hey idiot, what are you doing?

307
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,880
Go straight.

308
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,040
Mister! Singh!

309
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,440
Mister.

310
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,680
Hey, who are you?

311
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,680
Oh. Hi. Hi.

312
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,840
What do you want?

313
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,360
The visiting card.

314
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,120
Okay. Take it.

315
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,040
Hey.

316
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,440
Hi.

317
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,160
Baby. My child.

318
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,600
Hey, what are you doing with
the baby? - Aunt, no.

319
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
Aunt, my card.

320
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,080
Scoot, you rogue.

321
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,080
I was trying to catch the card but
the owner of the card came.

322
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,880
Sit here.
I'll go and ask about brother's job.

323
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
Good morning, brother. - Good
morning. - Is Hari sir inside?

324
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,040
Wait for him.

325
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,440
Have you brought all
the papers with you?

326
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,400
The visa will come next Monday.

327
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,680
The total expenditure would
1 lakh rupees. - Come.

328
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,120
Shiva, your brother's job is
set in London. - Yes sir.

329
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
Next month he'll have to go.
- Okay sir. - Have a seat.

330
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,960
That post was in demand but I
played my cards. - Thank you.

331
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,080
Sit for some time.
- Yes.

332
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,880
The confirmation letter from
London will be faxed.

333
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,160
Take it and then go.
- Okay sir.

334
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,120
Hey, your friend Chandru has
also come with you. - What?

335
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,080
Shreela's car.

336
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Hey.

337
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,360
How much is the rose for?
- 10 rupees.

338
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,840
Hey, who are you?
- Hey, hey...

339
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,720
Hey, what are you doing?

340
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,000
Hi.

341
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,920
Hello, student!
Keep your hearing aide properly.

342
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,720
The honking is going on behind.

343
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,200
Look at his poor driving.

344
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,440
Hey! What nonsense are you talking?

345
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,880
Hey. I'm just helping the student.
- Enough.

346
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,040
Do you even know who he is?
- Wait.

347
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,560
Before I forget, this is for you.

348
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,640
What is this? I got it with so
much love and you insulted it.

349
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,120
You aren't even receiving my calls.

350
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,880
You don't even reply to my messages.

351
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,560
Hey, what is this?
The old man is staring you.

352
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,080
Hello, old boy. I'm telling you
to look straight and drive.

353
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,520
Don't stare at your teacher.

354
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,760
For that I am sitting behind.

355
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,960
Isn't it teacher?
Let me turn this machine off.

356
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,960
Hey. Chandru, what are you doing?

357
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,680
Hey. Cool, chill.

358
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,600
If I get such a beautiful
teacher then...

359
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,120
I shall stare her too.

360
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,800
Shreela, are you coming behind?
- Come. - Get out.

361
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,320
Just get out.
- Why?

362
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,240
Stop embarrassing me.

363
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,600
What?
- Get lost.

364
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
Hey.
- Go.

365
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,640
Huh?
- What happened?

366
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,120
At least hold this.

367
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,280
Hello, old boy. Take care, man.

368
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
I'll be there for your
graduation ceremony.

369
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,560
Fast train Mumbai driving.

370
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,440
Call after you've learnt driving.
Okay? Hello.

371
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,560
Hello. Listen.

372
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,560
Sorry, father.
- Who is that idiot?

373
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,440
I'd told you that I'd met
a boy at the shoot-out.

374
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,400
Oh, is he the same boy?

375
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,240
Does he trouble you a lot?

376
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,120
No father. Just the usual flirting.

377
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,880
I think he is crazy about you.

378
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,600
He is not less than any joker.

379
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,160
He looks like one.

380
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,280
Mad boy.

381
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,040
Oh no! It's bad.
- It's really bad.

382
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,920
You... you really scared me.

383
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,280
Shreela, it's time to donate
this car in the museum.

384
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,120
Poor car, I don't know from how
long it's bearing your burden.

385
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,720
Till now you would've
reached the moon.

386
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,680
How come?
- Listen.

387
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,800
The distance between earth and
moon is 2,32,813 miles.

388
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,440
And it has already covered
that much distance.

389
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,960
So as of now we are on the moon.

390
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,880
Did I ask your suggestion?
- No.

391
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,520
This is the same car in which
Superstar learnt driving.

392
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,320
Go on your own way.
- Hey.

393
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,360
Listen, you felt bad about it.

394
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,360
Superstar is a superstar...

395
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,880
but your car is worn out.

396
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,120
I'll call a mechanic and
get the car towed.

397
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,800
If you wish you can come with me.
This area is very lonely.

398
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,680
Hello...
I'm born and brought up in Mumbai.

399
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,960
I know about every nook and
corner of this city.

400
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,800
There used to be a mechanic here.

401
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
He has... - I'll see to
it myself. Thanks, bye.

402
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,960
Hey, my bike is here.
I'll drop you.

403
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
My bike...

404
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,560
You won't beg?

405
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,560
Won't you beg for food?
- Daddy.

406
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,880
Won't you beg?
- No.

407
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,320
Hey.

408
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,960
Are you okay?

409
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,520
What are you doing?

410
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,400
Does anyone throw a
child on the road?

411
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,440
Ma'am, get lost.

412
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Is this how you behave?

413
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
You pushed such a small
girl on the road.

414
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,040
What if she would've been
crushed by a car?

415
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,880
Come on.
Everyone come along with me.

416
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,400
I'll call the police.
- She's out of her mind.

417
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,440
Madam, go mind your own business.

418
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,520
Never get involved in
other's matters.

419
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,240
Go away! Let me see who stops me.

420
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,240
Hey, get your men.

421
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,360
Chandru!

422
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,520
Shreela, how are you child?

423
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Uncle, come soon.
There's a fight over here.

424
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,600
Where are you calling
from at this time?

425
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Hey!

426
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,440
Hey!

427
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,080
Hey!

428
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,120
Hey, you've been hurt badly.
- No, it's okay. Just a scratch.

429
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,520
Do you have a handkerchief?

430
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,760
No, I am fine.
- No, see a doctor.

431
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,160
Uncle?

432
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,720
They...
- Are you okay?

433
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,800
I am fine, uncle.
- What is this?

434
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,720
Nothing.
- I've seen you before.

435
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,240
Chandru, my friend...

436
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,000
the one who was with me on the
day of shoot-out. - Yes.

437
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,720
Hi.
- Hello.

438
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm Anwar. Assistant commissioner
of police. - Hello.

439
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,800
I think you keep following her.
- Sir, no.

440
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Your full name.

441
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,640
Sir,
Iyar Petra Ariyur Chandershekhar.

442
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,520
Do you tell wrong name to police?

443
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,640
I am writing Chandru, in short form.

444
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,480
It is my daughter's wedding.

445
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,280
Today we'd stepped out to
give invitation cards.

446
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,120
And at that moment I received
a call from Shreela.

447
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,040
So son-in-law, come for the wedding.
We will wait for you.

448
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,520
Son-in-law?

449
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Uncle you...
- I will leave.

450
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,680
Son-in-law?

451
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,040
The bride will go with the groom.

452
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,240
Good morning, sir.

453
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,400
Brother, so many girls.

454
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,600
We will have nice time here.
- Leave all that.

455
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,920
Leave my hand.

456
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,080
Hey, old boy. What's up, my friend?

457
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,960
Tell me one thing.
I hope you didn't woo your teacher.

458
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,680
You're about to die and
still you woo girls.

459
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,040
Hi. Shall I take your beautiful
teacher for a minute?

460
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
Shri baby, come.

461
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,160
Chandru, he is my father.

462
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,720
Hi.

463
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,560
Father, he is Chandru.

464
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,760
Father...

465
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,000
Hi, Father. Bye, father.

466
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,000
Wife of a policeman.
Hello, aunt. Bye, aunt.

467
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,320
Escape Chandru otherwise
you'll get arrested.

468
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,440
Rickshaw!

469
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,040
I am a channel owner.

470
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,880
Hey.
- Leave me.

471
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,320
Let's go. That old man turned
out to be Shreela's father.

472
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
Father? So you're divorced
well before marriage.

473
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,680
She has gone.
- There is a small problem, friends.

474
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,880
The famous singer Harihar
for this function...

475
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,280
has got stuck in the
traffic of Mumbai.

476
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,880
So, if anyone of you knows
singing, please...

477
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,920
Stuck in traffic?
- How do I know?

478
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,640
Anybody from the guests?

479
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,000
Sir, you?

480
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,600
Sorry.
- How about you?

481
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,120
No, I'm cool.
- Come on, sir. You can do it.

482
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,520
Anybody.
- You can do it.

483
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,880
Hey, he will sing.

484
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,440
We've a volunteer.
- Bravo! Come on.

485
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Be a hero and sing.
- Bravo!

486
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,960
Go.

487
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,440
Sing, sing...

488
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,840
What the fish!
- Please come.

489
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,360
What is he doing?

490
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,520
What?

491
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,720
Okay father, time is up.

492
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,360
From the time you've come
you're looking sad.

493
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,840
Tell me, father.
- I don't feel like talking.

494
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,040
Are you upset because of him?

495
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,720
After mother left...

496
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,840
you raised me...

497
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,200
you have given me full freedom...

498
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,280
but have I ever taken wrong
advantage of that.

499
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,000
Trust me. Okay?

500
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,400
Father,
have some faith on your daughter.

501
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,760
I will take the right decision.

502
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
I promise.
- What are you doing?

503
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,040
I cannot even do acting of
remaining angry with you.

504
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,520
You are very naughty.

505
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,840
You also say that he is a joker.

506
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,560
He is clown.

507
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,520
Happy birthday Shri.

508
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,880
Hey...

509
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,480
That's for you and this is for you.
- Thanks.

510
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,280
Tell me how is father.

511
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
Is his sugar under control?

512
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,360
You make him understand
as much as you...

513
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,800
can but he'll still eat sweets.
Even my daughter is the same.

514
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,680
Father, you don't let me eat sweets.

515
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,080
Our house is like an army camp.

516
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,240
Oh no. I am alright. Thanks.

517
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,240
I've now got transferred to Mumbai.

518
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,160
I'm joining City Bank
as marketing head.

519
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,560
I didn't want to miss
Shri's birthday...

520
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,160
so I came a day earlier.

521
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,360
You could've stayed here.
I've got such a big house.

522
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,320
No uncle, I've found a gym and a...

523
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,120
yoga teacher near to my house.

524
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,520
Even the clinic of dietician
is close by so...

525
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,960
Because of your strict diet
your wife left you.

526
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,600
I've come to know today
that Ruku left me...

527
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,560
because of my strict diet and yoga.

528
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,240
Anyway, enough of that.

529
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,440
Well, what have you planned
for birthday tomorrow?

530
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,720
If you're free in the evening
then let's go for dinner.

531
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,680
Uncle, you also come along.
- No, not me. You kids go.

532
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,600
Hmm. Okay.

533
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,680
I will have Gangio Lan Flow.

534
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,800
No cheese, no butter.
Very less salt.

535
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,800
What nonsense are you ordering?

536
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,800
Bring everything with extra cheese.

537
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,320
Yes, madam. Thank you.

538
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,840
What's happening?
- Hey...

539
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,040
Happy birthday to you.

540
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,440
Happy birthday to you.
- How sweet!

541
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,160
So cool.
- Happy birthday.

542
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,320
Hey.

543
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,880
Hey!

544
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,480
Happy birthday.
- How come you're here?

545
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,680
Shri, you invited me, that
is why I've come here.

546
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,240
Did you?
- Me? When did I invite you?

547
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,560
You...

548
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,640
You...
- Thank you.

549
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,680
Ram, he is my friend Chandru.

550
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,840
Hey. What's up, man?

551
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,160
Chandru, he is my cousin Ram.

552
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,840
Cousin, wow. That means
brother-in-law. - Brother-in-law?

553
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,040
Hi, how are you brother-in-law?
- Hi.

554
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Oh!

555
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,840
Why don't you join us?
What will you eat?

556
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,120
Good idea, brother-in-law.

557
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,440
We shall drink together.

558
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,200
What are you guys having?

559
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,800
I am having Gangio Lange Flow...

560
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,320
without cheese, without butter.

561
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,720
Oh dear. Are you unwell?

562
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,640
If I eat this I'll have
to go to the doctor.

563
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,320
What kind of a food he eats!

564
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,160
Thank God.

565
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,040
I need extra cheese.

566
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,040
Look at them.
Eat drink and be merry.

567
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,560
Absolutely carefree.

568
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,520
Hey.
- God damn it!

569
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,120
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

570
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,200
It's quite alright.

571
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,640
Oh God I'm so sorry.
- I'll just be back.

572
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,120
It's okay. No problem. Take
your time. No problem.

573
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,960
You did this purposely.
- Yes.

574
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,640
No, I mean you hit me hard.
- Go from here.

575
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,720
Leave immediately from here.
Please go. Now.

576
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,080
He's about to come. - He has asked
for dinner so let me eat.

577
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,120
He'll bad.
- He'll tell everything to father.

578
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,840
Just go Chandru, go.

579
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,760
Okay, bye.

580
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,160
Bye.

581
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,120
Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

582
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,720
Hi, birthday girl.

583
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,400
Happy birthday.
- Thank you, uncle. - Hi.

584
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,200
Hi, I am Imran.
- My husband.

585
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,840
He's with BBC.
- Alright, you're the one. - Hi.

586
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,200
Happy birthday, Shri.
- Thank you.

587
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,640
How was your dinner?

588
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,280
It was nice, uncle.

589
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,320
In fact,
Shri's friend had also come there.

590
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,360
Okay. I thought you both
had gone for dinner.

591
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,560
Yes, we'd planned, but Chandru
also came there.

592
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,800
Did Chandru come?

593
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,200
Yes,
he came there without informing.

594
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,600
Shreela,
he's your father's yoga teacher.

595
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,320
Hey, I'll slap you, smart-ass.
Ramu isn't.

596
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,160
Very cute.
- Yes, everyone is cute for you.

597
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,960
Shah Rukh is cute, old man is cute.

598
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,720
Even this dog is cute.

599
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,040
Your scarf is so nice.

600
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,280
For you except for your boyfriend
everyone else is cute.

601
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,800
Actually...

602
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,560
This one was actually cute.
- Hey... - Hey, what?

603
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,360
I'm with you and you're still
staring at other girls.

604
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,440
We've ordered food, doesn't mean
we cannot look at the menu.

605
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,480
Food is always tasty.

606
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,800
Shri, I am totally a normal boy.

607
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,240
Hmm. I do not read too much books.

608
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
I listen to music and I sleep a lot.

609
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,960
I smoke cigarette, drink beer.

610
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,360
I've a bath once in two
days and that...

611
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,000
also when grandmother scolds me.

612
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,040
I go to temple when grandmother
locks the house.

613
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,640
What else should I
tell about myself?

614
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,080
There might be millions of people
in this world like me.

615
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,720
But Chandru is a little
different for you.

616
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,280
Because no one...

617
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,760
can love you as I do in this world.

618
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,040
That is why...

619
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,320
That is why...

620
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,200
That is why...

621
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,640
That is why pay this bill as
I forgot to bring my wallet.

622
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,600
Hey...
- You... - Hey!

623
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,960
No.

624
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,200
Hey. Chandru.

625
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,760
Wait.
- Hey, no.

626
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,120
See you tomorrow.

627
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,120
Bye. - Hey,
what about my good night kiss?

628
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,280
No. Take it.

629
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Shri...

630
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,040
what is your excuse today?

631
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,880
Father.
- Tell me.

632
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,000
Chandru. Chandru is just
a good friend. - Enough.

633
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,120
I don't want anymore of this.

634
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,280
Uncle, if you wish you can call
him home once and talk to him.

635
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,400
He seems to belong to a good family.

636
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,600
Moreover if Shri likes him then
he cannot be an ordinary boy.

637
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,800
Am I right?
- Why?

638
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,600
Why should I invite anyone?

639
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,960
Even she can invite him.

640
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,760
Isn't all this happening quickly,
father?

641
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,360
So will I continue seeing the drama?

642
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,680
Shri, you go inside.
I'll talk to uncle.

643
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,840
Invite Chandru here tomorrow
morning. Okay.

644
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,880
What? The zip is closed.

645
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,120
Don't be scared at all.

646
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,400
Father is an army man,
that is why he's straight forward.

647
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,440
Okay, okay it isn't something
great for me.

648
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,320
What is it?
- What?

649
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,520
In the mouth.
- Chewing gum.

650
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,640
For getting courage. Isn't it cool?

651
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,240
Spit it out otherwise father
will think of you as rowdy.

652
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,600
He'll consider me rowdy because
I've chewing gum.

653
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,920
Okay, I have taken it out.

654
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,920
Silly.

655
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,000
Father-in-law's house is quite nice.

656
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,440
Have a seat and I shall call father.
- Okay.

657
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,200
She is so cute.

658
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,680
Look at his nose.

659
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,000
What Mr. Young man?

660
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
How are you?

661
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,880
Fine, sir.

662
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,720
Sit down.

663
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,400
What will you have?

664
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,640
Tea, coffee, juice or...
- No, nothing sir.

665
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,440
Have something, son.

666
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,040
Only water.

667
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,800
Water?
- Yes.

668
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,360
Shri.

669
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,280
So tell me...

670
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,800
Sorry uncle that day unknowingly,
I...

671
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,080
Sorry, sorry... What did you say?
- I'm sorry.

672
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,920
The machine isn't working properly.

673
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,480
If I'd taken that seriously then...

674
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,880
I wouldn't have allowed you to
sit in my house like this.

675
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,840
Hello...
- Come, Ram.

676
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,680
Nowadays it has become fashion
to insult elderly people.

677
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,160
Your entire generation is like this.

678
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,000
No, uncle. I did it unknowingly...

679
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,360
Sorry.

680
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,520
Where do you stay?

681
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,760
Matunga, Church Road.

682
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,000
Do you live with your parents?

683
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,400
Sir, I was 10 years old when they
expired in a car accident.

684
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,920
Now I stay with my grandmother.

685
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,040
I... I am really sorry.

686
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,800
It's okay, uncle.

687
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,640
Seems your grandmother has brought
you up with lots of pampering.

688
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,960
Yes, she loves me a lot.

689
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,000
What do you do? Job, study...

690
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,680
Nothing. I am jobless.

691
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,720
I keep on thinking as to
what work I should do.

692
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,960
Isn't it interesting, Ram?
- Yes.

693
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,240
I've still not decided as
to what I should do.

694
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,840
I don't understand.
What does it mean?

695
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,880
I haven't thought about
it seriously.

696
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,920
I mean I never felt the need.

697
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,400
As I understand you're an educated
unemployed person.

698
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,960
Have you ever gone to school or...

699
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,200
No, uncle. I am an MBA graduate.

700
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,440
Oh. MBA.

701
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,320
Uncle, I know what you want to say.

702
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,760
I will take good care of Shri.

703
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,600
Shri, get one black coffee for me.

704
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,080
Sorry. You were saying History,
Geography or something like that.

705
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,440
MBA, sir.

706
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,400
It may sound strange...

707
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,200
but if Shri is with me then
I can do anything.

708
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,440
I love her.
- Enough!

709
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,240
I don't want to hear your
road side dialogues.

710
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
What are you?

711
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,000
An unemployed boy who splurges
his grandmother's money.

712
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,520
The whole day,
you smoke, drinking and loiter.

713
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,760
That is your time pass.

714
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,840
With whose money have you bought
shoes, clothes and bike?

715
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,880
Tell me!

716
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,680
Let me speak practical.

717
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,880
Why should I get my daughter
married to...

718
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,960
a boy who is nothing except a zero?

719
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,600
How long do you know my daughter?

720
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,040
From last 6 months. Maximum.

721
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,400
Sir, I just know that I'll
keep your daughter happy.

722
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,440
Sir, what do you want? A job.

723
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,240
Next time when I come I'll
be having a good job.

724
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,920
I'll prove myself.
- What do you want to prove?

725
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,840
Ram, are we running a reality show?

726
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,760
This gentleman wants
to prove something.

727
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,880
It is a limit.

728
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,520
Unemployed MBA graduate wants
to prove something.

729
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,680
Sir, I will leave.

730
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,160
Thanks for your time.

731
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,760
Stop it, Chandru. Every girl's
father asks such questions.

732
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,760
Just imagine yourself on
his position and think.

733
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,400
You are supporting him.

734
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,640
Keep yourself in my place,
then you'll understand.

735
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,640
You had called me to get insulted.

736
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,440
And that Ram was sitting there
and laughing at me.

737
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,240
Don't talk nonsense.
Ram is very nice.

738
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,320
He arranged the meeting.

739
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,440
Oh, so I am the only one who is bad.

740
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,920
An unemployed person.
A rowdy roadside person who fell...

741
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,240
in love with a madam like you.

742
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,240
You should get married to the one
who works in the Citi Bank.

743
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,440
You are misunderstanding me.

744
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,320
It's so cheap! Nonsense!

745
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,120
Yes, it's nonsense!

746
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,280
You knew I'd no job,
so why befriend me?

747
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,240
Is this what it means to
be in a relationship?

748
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,880
To get married, you need wealth,
money, bungalow and car.

749
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,640
Isn't love important?

750
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,680
If only people with job had the
right to fall in love...

751
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,240
then there would be rush outside
employment exchange.

752
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,160
Chandru, stop screaming.

753
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,200
Don't just say anything in anger.

754
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,840
And don't bring Ram in between.

755
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,600
It's a truth that you don't
have a job. Isn't it?

756
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,720
Hey, this man seems to be Chandru.

757
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,960
There.
- I don't want to talk to him.

758
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,480
For how many days will
you not talk to him?

759
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,520
Ram, please don't stop.
- Wait, I'll go and talk to him.

760
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,520
Ram, please. I don't want to talk
to him. - Wait, I'm going.

761
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,880
Please don't embarrass me.

762
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,880
I will just be back.
- Ram. Please.

763
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,240
Hey Chandru, how are you?

764
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,280
I saw you once or twice
with the files in hand.

765
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,680
One who is unemployed for three
years won't get a job so soon.

766
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,280
Do one thing. Give me your resume
and I'll get you a job.

767
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,680
And that also today.
I've many contacts here.

768
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,600
No, you leave it. I will manage.

769
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,160
Ego? You're worthless and
just see your attitude.

770
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,840
Just like stars.

771
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,880
Let me tell you the truth.

772
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,120
Shreela will get married to me...

773
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,040
and our children will
call you uncle.

774
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,040
Even then you'll roam
around with files.

775
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,240
Ruffian, you are trying to be smart.

776
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,240
Shri is only mine. Understood!
- Chandru, stop it.

777
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,400
Don't misbehave.

778
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,160
He isn't finding a job so
has become frustrated.

779
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,160
I gave him a job offer and
he became angry with me.

780
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,480
Let's go from here.
- Sorry, Ram.

781
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,120
For venting your anger out on
Shreela you'll go to Baslistan.

782
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,920
Do you know it's so hot there?

783
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,440
Because of the qualification,
jobs are very less.

784
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,520
Hey, I don't like this city, that
is why I want to go there.

785
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,960
I want to prove myself.

786
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,760
Prove.

787
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,560
Now I'm getting this job
so shall I refuse it?

788
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,160
Will this job do?
- Yes sir. Okay, sir.

789
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,440
Sir, he isn't agreeing to
doing this job so that...

790
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,080
his girlfriend's father
says yes for marriage.

791
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,520
He is ready to go to Baslistan.

792
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,920
Look, wait for three months.

793
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,080
Shiva's brother is going to London.

794
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,760
It's a good job.
Rest the choice is yours.

795
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,360
No, sir. This job will do.

796
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,760
I am really in need of a job.

797
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,840
Thanks for the help.

798
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,440
In such a short period...
- Don't thank me.

799
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,960
It's my job.

800
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,400
Listen.

801
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,840
You will have to do me a favor.

802
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,400
What will I have to do, sir?

803
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,480
A poor family wants to send
their son to Baslistan.

804
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,520
He's autistic but don't consider
him less than anyone.

805
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,560
He's very smart. You just have to
take him carefully with you.

806
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,440
You'll get blessings
of his family.

807
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,720
Come.

808
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,200
Hi, I am Chandru...

809
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,040
Iqbal, keep this down.

810
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,080
Listen to what brother
Chandru is saying.

811
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,840
I am Nawaz Iqbal.

812
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:01,080
Broom the floor,
wash utensils, watch TV...

813
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,240
offer prayers, and clean the house.
- Enough...

814
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,360
He has been over-trained.

815
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,760
He has to speak this
in immigration so...

816
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,400
that is why he has learnt it well.

817
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,560
Will you come with me,
on the flight?

818
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,000
We will go in flight.

819
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,600
He does not speak much.
- Yes.

820
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,480
Shall I keep this?

821
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,640
I think he has become angry.
Did I say anything wrong?

822
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,640
Thanks.

823
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,240
Sweet.

824
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,640
Sure, sir. I will do it.

825
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,640
Call up, Shreela. - What is the
matter? Why are you so sad?

826
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,360
If you don't wish to go,
then let's go back home.

827
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,680
Grandmother,
I'm leaving you for the first time.

828
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,960
Tell these dialogues
to someone else.

829
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,120
Grandmother, I'll come back soon.
Take care of your health.

830
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,600
Chandru, are you ready?
- Yes sir. - Greetings.

831
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,760
Grandmother, I'd told you about
Hari Das. - Greetings, ma'am.

832
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,280
Greetings. - Give me your
passport. - One second.

833
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,360
Hey. Come here.

834
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,920
Chandru, where is your bag?
- It's here, sir.

835
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,520
You keep talking and I'll get the
check in done. - Okay, sir.

836
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,520
Buddy, call Shreela once. Do it.

837
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,880
Huh? Shri? Shri...

838
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,160
Hello...
- Ram here.

839
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,080
Can you call...

840
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,960
What happened, Chandru?

841
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,240
I called her and Ram picked
up the phone. Ruffian!

842
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,520
Okay Iqbal, bye.

843
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
Chandru.

844
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,840
Sorry sir. I was on the phone.

845
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,360
No problem. All the best.
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

846
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,120
Thank you for the help.
- Bye.

847
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,960
Chandru.
What has happened? Are you alright?

848
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,120
He called up Shreela
and Ram answered it.

849
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,560
That is why he is sad.

850
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,360
Nowadays the romance of children
cannot be understood.

851
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,160
No problem, I will tell her.

852
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,120
Don't worry about anything.

853
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,240
Give me a phone call. Okay?

854
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,280
You don't cry too much and
take care of yourself.

855
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,640
I will be back soon.

856
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,160
Okay.

857
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,920
Be careful while going.

858
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,040
All the best.

859
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,680
Hello.
- Hello, Shiva, you'd called.

860
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,280
Chandru had called you but
Ram answered your phone.

861
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,720
Chandru called...
- Yes, he called some time back.

862
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,280
Where is he?
- He has left for Baslistan.

863
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,960
What? - He's already in the flight
and it's about to take off.

864
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,880
This way.

865
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,720
This way.

866
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,920
Stop, don't run. I will shoot.

867
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,960
In this country drug means death.

868
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,560
He had brought drugs with him.

869
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,520
If not today then he might
be killed few days later.

870
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,400
Iqbal.

871
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,640
This is passport and call
me once you reach.

872
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,080
Don't forget. Okay?
- Next.

873
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,960
Excuse me. Are you both from India?

874
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,480
Is this luggage yours?
- Yes sir.

875
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,240
Has this luggage been checked?
- No sir.

876
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,560
Come on, go and get it checked.

877
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,520
One by one. Here.

878
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,320
Did you see that?
- Yes.

879
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,960
Drugs. Don't move. Lie down.

880
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,960
Everyone on the floor.

881
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,160
Chandru, I'm getting this bag
checked in with your luggage.

882
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,800
My man will come and take it.

883
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,680
He is Chandru. Inform there.

884
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,960
(Other language)

885
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,400
(Other language)

886
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,960
(Other language)
- Sir.

887
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,720
(Other language)

888
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,760
Sir, this is not mine. What is this?

889
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,040
Sir, this...

890
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,960
(Other language)

891
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,160
(Other language)

892
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,480
I'm taking him to higher
officer's room.

893
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,200
Mr. Chandrashekhar, how are you?

894
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,880
Sir.
- I am Harish.

895
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,400
I work for Indian embassy.

896
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,880
Sort of. Wear your clothes.

897
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,000
Sir, I haven't done anything.
- I know.

898
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,760
Don't worry. You come with me.

899
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,000
Are you scared, Mr. Chandrashekhar?

900
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,960
Sir, I have not done anything.

901
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,720
Don't get scared.
Why are we here? To help you.

902
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,200
You help us...

903
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,000
and you can go back to India
by the next flight.

904
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,080
Okay sir,
tell me what do I've to do?

905
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,400
Who gave you this?

906
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,440
Sir, we do not know anything.

907
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,840
We don't know to whom
this bag belongs to.

908
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,640
On Mumbai airport our travel
agent cheated us, sir.

909
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,320
Trust me, sir.

910
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,200
So you won't tell us...

911
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,720
from whom you have got the drugs.

912
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,040
Sir, what should I tell?
We are innocent sir.

913
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,240
I've no idea, sir.

914
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,160
Sorry, sir.
That is all what he has to say sir.

915
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,200
Take him.

916
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,880
Go in.

917
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,920
Sir, the person with whom
you'd sent drugs...

918
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,200
was caught at the airport.

919
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,960
Both are being taken to jail, sir.
- How could this happen?

920
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,280
Open it! Take me from here.

921
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,240
Mother, I want to come home.

922
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,840
I am feeling scared here.

923
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:10,680
Mother! This place isn't good.
Come and take me.

924
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,920
Hey, Iqbal! Keep quiet.

925
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,280
Hey, Iqbal, stop.

926
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,640
Get me out!

927
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,920
(Other language)

928
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,400
Get me out!

929
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,000
Get me out!
- Sir.

930
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,320
Hey. He is autistic.

931
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,680
Get me out! Leave me!

932
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,120
Mother!

933
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,680
Leave me! Leave me!

934
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,440
Mother!

935
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,360
(Other language)

936
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,600
(Other language)

937
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,040
(Other language)

938
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:21,920
Hey Iqbal...
- Look here.

939
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,320
Here no doors have lock.

940
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,960
It can be easily opened.

941
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,520
Take your hand out and open.

942
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,200
Iqbal! Iqbal.

943
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,840
How much have they beaten you?

944
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,280
Listen, listen... Go down.

945
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,600
Two storey's below there
is a storage...

946
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,120
where they keep all the medicines.

947
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,080
Those people must have slept.
I'll take care of him.

948
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,560
Go get it.

949
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,840
Listen,
while coming get a sheet for me.

950
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:10,360
Stupid,
if you shout you'll be beaten.

951
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,480
Mazhar, cigar.

952
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,600
Come on.

953
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,120
(Other Language)

954
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,800
There.
- Hey!

955
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,360
Hey, stop.

956
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,960
(Other Language)

957
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,560
Hey.

958
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,640
I will not leave you.

959
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,480
Sorry, don't beat me.

960
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,160
Don't move.

961
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,920
Come on.

962
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,400
Thanks.

963
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,440
Here.

964
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,200
Brother, what are you looking at?

965
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,240
Doesn't this market look
like that of India?

966
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,520
This is like home to us.
Why have you been jailed?

967
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,920
For theft?

968
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,960
Hey, when an elderly person talks...

969
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,960
it's disrespectful
not to answer him.

970
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,800
Hey, stop, man! What case?

971
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,440
Drugs.
- Then he is gone.

972
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,560
They will chop off your head. Take.

973
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,640
You take.

974
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,360
Take it, brother.

975
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,400
No.
- You get everything here.

976
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,960
If you wish you can even
get a girl here.

977
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,640
Where are you going without
answering the senior citizen?

978
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,400
Don't point finger.

979
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,600
Listen, yesterday they
were beating this man.

980
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,280
His name was Jia.

981
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,880
Yesterday you had saved his life.

982
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,880
Along with him is jailer Naseer.
He's a very dangerous man.

983
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,000
These men are Jia's informers.

984
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,080
And Jia is jailer's informer.

985
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,480
The way these men help
Jia similarly...

986
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,440
Jia helps them to escape from jail.

987
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,040
Just think that when jailer
isn't around...

988
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,400
Jia is his right hand.

989
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,360
If Jia gives information about
someone then Nasser kills him.

990
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,880
That is why those Chinese
men beat Jia last night.

991
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,080
It seems you belong
to a good family.

992
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,280
Then how did you reach here.
Did any travel agent cheat you?

993
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,280
How did you come to know?
- How did I come to know?

994
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,160
More than half of the men
are imprisoned here...

995
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:48,680
because of this reason.
All Indians. Muslims.

996
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,560
That's how it's.

997
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,120
When travel agents send
people like you here...

998
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,480
then quietly they send a
bag full of drugs also.

999
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,720
They know that rules
and regulations...

1000
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,480
of this country are very strict.

1001
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,200
In our country 1 kilo drugs means
1 lakh. That's nothing.

1002
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,880
But here the same 1 kilo drugs
are worth 2 crores rupees.

1003
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,040
Those travel agents take advantage
of our helplessness.

1004
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,280
Our mistake is that we
get their bag with us.

1005
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,080
But we are never able to
go back to our country.

1006
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,760
How much drugs were
there in your bag?

1007
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,680
2 kilos in my bag and 5
kilos in Iqbal's bag.

1008
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,720
Only this much.

1009
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,480
You are gone.

1010
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,360
The man over there who is talking
is Pondicherry Max.

1011
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,600
He knows many lawyers.

1012
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,320
Let's go and talk to him...

1013
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,120
and ask him if he has any means...

1014
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,640
to help you escape from here. Come.

1015
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,920
Shreenath is scaring
you unnecessarily.

1016
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,000
Don't worry your head
won't be chopped off.

1017
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,080
Make arrangements for a good
lawyer and escape from here.

1018
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,800
Sir, can this really happen?
- Of course.

1019
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:51,080
Do one thing. After escaping from
here make a false passport.

1020
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,960
And after crossing the border
go to another country.

1021
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,160
That's the only way.

1022
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,720
Look at him.

1023
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,840
Sometime the brain of Chinna
doesn't work at all.

1024
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,640
Actually the kidney of Chinna's
daughter has failed.

1025
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,400
He had come here to earn
money for her treatment.

1026
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,280
After coming here he stole money...

1027
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,400
because he didn't have
money to eat food.

1028
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,760
And he was caught.

1029
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,360
And you?

1030
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,640
I was caught here in drugs case.

1031
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,760
For how many years were you jailed?

1032
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,600
For 12 years.
Because of lawyer my head was saved.

1033
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,080
I don't have money for bail,
that is why I'm here.

1034
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,920
How much drugs did you have?
- 100 grams.

1035
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,640
Only 100 grams. - So severe
punishment for 100 grams?

1036
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:37,000
Not only here but this happens
in Malaysia and Singapore.

1037
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,360
You know that many innocent Indians
get trapped in this way.

1038
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,880
Media doesn't like to
talk about it much.

1039
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,640
An Italian had a cigarette
full of opium...

1040
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,200
and for that his head
was chopped off.

1041
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,200
And you've been trapped
here for 2 kilo drugs.

1042
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,920
May God help you, brother?

1043
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:04,320

1053
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,080
Hey man, don't cry.
Why are you crying?

1054
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,560
I didn't do anything.
- Don't cry. Get up.

1055
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,480
What's happening?

1056
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,680
I have done nothing.

1057
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,320
15 judges of high court
have together...

1058
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,000
announced their decision
to chop head...

1059
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,440
of four of you in the
middle of the road.

1060
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,040
I'm sorry about this judgment.
I'm sorry.

1061
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,600
Behead.
- We are in a foreign country.

1062
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,160
I cannot do anything about this.

1063
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,880
Please arrange for a lawyer.
Mr. Chandru, now it's out of control.

1064
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,400
Please, sir.
- Please understand.

1065
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,240
I cannot do anything. I'm sorry.
- Death for what?

1066
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,520
Why are you doing this to me?

1067
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,800
We are innocent. - You know the law
of this land is such. - Hello.

1068
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,000
Excuse me.
I'm innocent. I'm innocent.

1069
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,400
You have to help me, sir.

1070
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,720
Sir, you've to help me.
I'm innocent.

1071
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,640
Sir, please help me.
- I'm sorry. I cannot do anything.

1072
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,920
I am innocent.

1073
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,320
I've got released.
I've got released.

1074
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,040
Tomorrow I'll go to back
to my house. I'm saved.

1075
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,360
I am free.

1076
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,160
After today I'll never ask
cigarette from you.

1077
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,120
You smoke, you smoke...

1078
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,600
Hey Changu, Mangu, come let's
play for the last time.

1079
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,560
Today is the last day.

1080
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,320
Hey, my dear friend.

1081
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,600
Hey, Chinna calm down.
Look at Chandru. He's worried.

1082
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,840
These are the details of his case.

1083
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,240
Chandru, don't worry friend.

1084
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,040
I will go to Hyderabad via Mumbai.

1085
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,760
After meeting your grandmother,
I'll tell her everything.

1086
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,360
Max has written the details
of your case.

1087
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,400
With the help of a good lawyer
even you'll escape soon.

1088
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:03,360
Chinna, pay my regards to
your wife and daughter.

1089
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,240
With the God's blessings...

1090
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,480
if I get released from here then
I'll come to meet them.

1091
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,440
I am sure that we will meet again.

1092
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,840
God willing!

1093
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,360
The shop is closed for now.
Come tomorrow.

1094
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,480
Tomorrow I'll put connection
for you. Is it okay?

1095
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,800
The shop is closed for now.
Come tomorrow.

1096
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,200
Who is Shiva?
- I am Shiva.

1097
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,280
I have come from Baslistan.

1098
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,680
Today is my Chandru's birthday.

1099
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,240
Sit, sir. And eat this rice pudding.

1100
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,800
I'll just be back
from the kitchen.

1101
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,720
Sir, how will we tell
this to grandmother?

1102
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,560
She is a heart patient.

1103
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,360
But we will have to tell her.

1104
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,160
Is it tasty? Chandru loves the
rice pudding that I make.

1105
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,080
He used to eat the entire
rice pudding.

1106
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,400
Shiva, you didn't tell me who he is.

1107
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,200
Sir...
- Greetings, ma'am.

1108
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,920
My name is Chinna.
I've come Baslistan.

1109
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,960
I met Chandru there.

1110
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,720
Thank God. Now I've got information
about my child.

1111
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,040
Tell me how my child is.

1112
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,280
Is his job fine?

1113
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,960
Is his health and everything fine?

1114
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,960
He hasn't called even
once after he left.

1115
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,000
All wrong thoughts come to my mind.

1116
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,280
Ma'am, Chandru is in some trouble.

1117
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,280
What are you saying?
What has happened to my child?

1118
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,880
The travel agent had put
drugs in Chandru's bag.

1119
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,960
The moment he reached the
airport he was arrested.

1120
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:48,160
If we hire a good lawyer then
he'll surely be saved.

1121
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,720
But if we don't take
an action soon...

1122
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,800
then his head will be chopped off.

1123
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,640
Grandmother...
- What are you saying?

1124
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,520
This is the truth.
The punishment has been announced.

1125
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,600
You'll have to talk to
the ministry here.

1126
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,920
All the details of the case
are written in this letter.

1127
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,560
I'm sure God will do everything
fine. - God cannot be so merciless.

1128
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,160
Even I have escaped from there.

1129
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,760
They just cut my hand
for a small theft.

1130
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:17,640
Shiva, Chandru had asked you
to give this to some girl.

1131
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,320
Grandmother.

1132
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,080
Shreela, come out.

1133
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:51,960
What the hell!
- Come out.

1134
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,840
Shiva. - Our friend got
trapped because of you.

1135
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,520
What nonsense!
- Ask all this from your father.

1136
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,960
Grandmother is admitted to the
hospital. - Are you at peace now?

1137
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,800
Please stop screaming.

1138
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,200
What has happened to Chandru?
Tell me.

1139
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,440
Travel agent Hari Das trapped him.

1140
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,480
He put drugs in Chandru's bag.

1141
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,560
He was arrested on the airport.

1142
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,440
A man who came from there
told all this.

1143
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,160
We need to do something.

1144
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,000
Otherwise we will lose
our Chandru forever.

1145
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,360
Stop it. What is our fault in this?

1146
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,840
That is his bloody fate.

1147
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,720
Go away from here otherwise
I'll call the police.

1148
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,000
Get out of here.
- Enough, father.

1149
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,360
Don't be insensitive.

1150
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,560
Is this the time to talk like this?

1151
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,800
In which hospital is grandmother
admitted?

1152
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,280
MMC hospital.

1153
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,440
Now you're happy, Shri.
My child is in jail.

1154
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,680
I've heard that his head
will be chopped off.

1155
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,360
My Chandru isn't bad that he
would take drugs from here.

1156
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,720
Oh God, what should I do now?

1157
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:10,000
Shiva! Where has Shiva gone? Shiva.

1158
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,240
Granny. What is it?

1159
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,480
Why did you admit me
to the hospital?

1160
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,920
I have to go out from here.

1161
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,600
I've to go to Baslistan
and save my child.

1162
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,440
Take me away from here.
- Grandmother...

1163
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,320
Please don't be stressed.

1164
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,120
Your health is not good.

1165
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,240
I will go and get Chandru back.

1166
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,000
You are absolutely right.

1167
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,320
He went there because of me.

1168
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,120
I wish I was able to talk to him.

1169
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,040
Now I will get back Chandru with me.

1170
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,160
I promise you.

1171
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,640
I am sorry.

1172
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,360
Shreela, wait for a minute.

1173
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:57,960
Chandru has sent a letter.

1174
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,640
I can't take this, Anwar.

1175
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,160
What will an alone girl do there?

1176
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,040
You well very know the rules
are very strict there.

1177
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,240
There is no use talking to you.
You're supporting her.

1178
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,160
You know how stubborn Shreela is.

1179
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,840
She isn't going to stop at
anybody's insistence.

1180
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,600
Just understand that she's
in love with him.

1181
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,640
Chandru isn't a criminal.

1182
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,120
The travel agent placed that bag.

1183
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,160
He's a good chap. You get too
emotional in Shreela's matter.

1184
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,200
You're supporting her?
- Stop worrying about her.

1185
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,280
You are unnecessarily worrying.

1186
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,200
I've talked with Umar.
He'll take care of her.

1187
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,840
Child,
these are your travel documents...

1188
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,880
visa, ticket and everything
else is in this.

1189
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,200
I have talked to the home minister.

1190
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,720
Thanks.

1191
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,600
Shri. Shri.

1192
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,000
Is it necessary for you to go?
Just think it over again.

1193
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,560
It's highly risky to go there
alone and get him back.

1194
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,640
He is in a great danger, father.

1195
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,040
I will have to go.

1196
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,600
This is his bad fate
then what can we do?

1197
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,080
Will you go there and
change his destiny?

1198
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,520
Which destiny? What destiny?

1199
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,680
He went there because of me.

1200
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,920
He got this punishment for
falling in love with me.

1201
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,680
You are talking about fate.

1202
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,720
Weren't you the one who forced him?

1203
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,000
Shri, please try to understand.

1204
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,280
If you stop me then your
daughter will...

1205
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,240
remain here like a living dead body.

1206
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,000
And maybe I die after that.

1207
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,040
Shri...
- I am sorry.

1208
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,560
Taxi.

1209
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,200
Come on, madam.
- Hello, who are you?

1210
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,240
Where are you taking my bag?

1211
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,040
Tamil? I think you are from Mumbai.

1212
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,400
Excuse me.
- I'm a taxi driver, ma'am.

1213
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:41,080
I can see you're Tamil. Get in.
- What are you doing?

1214
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,360
First wear this. - Every woman who
comes here has to wear this...

1215
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,640
otherwise the police
will arrest you.

1216
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:49,080
And they put a big fine
and have no pity.

1217
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,560
You've still not told me that
where do you want to go.

1218
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,400
Low court prison.
- What? Jail?

1219
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,520
Yes, Low court prison.

1220
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,280
You want to go to jail
or a place near it.

1221
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,080
I want to go to jail.
Do you've any problem?

1222
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,440
No, I don't have any problem.

1223
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,440
Madam, shall I tell you something?
You're my last passenger.

1224
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,800
I am going back to India.

1225
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,840
My wife is waiting for me in Mumbai.

1226
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,200
I think the road is closed ahead.
- Why?

1227
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,480
I don't know.
Maybe the traffic is jam.

1228
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,720
Hello, hello. What has happened?

1229
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,640
(Other Language)

1230
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,640
Madam, for sometime our
car cannot go ahead.

1231
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,600
Why can't it go ahead?
- Traffic jam.

1232
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,960
But you're lucky. Everyone doesn't
get a chance to see this.

1233
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,720
Hey.

1234
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,960
(Other Language)

1235
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,200
(Other Language)

1236
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,200
(Other Language)

1237
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,600
(Other Language)

1238
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,560
Madam, come here. Come, this side.

1239
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,960
Step up.

1240
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,880
I don't have time to see all this.
Let's go from here.

1241
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,320
Madam,
this is the only way to go to jail.

1242
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,360
You won't get this
opportunity again.

1243
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,600
I know you're seeing it
for the first time...

1244
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,000
so you will get scared.

1245
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,960
But the law of this
place is like this.

1246
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:23,240
I can't wait. Let's go.

1247
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,360
Wait, madam.

1248
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,200
I think some Indians heads are
going to be chopped off.

1249
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,080
What?

1250
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,360
They must have committed
a big crime.

1251
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,360
Chandru!

1252
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:46,400
Chandru!
- Madam, who is Chandru?

1253
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,560
Chandru!

1254
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,440
Chandru! Chandru!

1255
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,120
Chandru!
- Move.

1256
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,320
Chandru!

1257
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,760
Chandru!

1258
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,280
Chandru!

1259
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,640
Chandru!

1260
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,320
She's a girl from our country.
She's big problem.

1261
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,840
How can I leave her alone?
I'm in the hospital right now.

1262
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,280
Look, you've waited for so long
so now just another day.

1263
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,560
Chandru!

1264
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,240
Chandru!
- Madam! Wait. Don't run.

1265
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,240
Chandru!
- Your bag and passport is safe.

1266
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,720
I have kept it safely.
- Chandru...

1267
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,120
But why did you become unconscious.
- Chandru!

1268
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,320
Because of you I missed my flight.

1269
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:45,560
I killed him. I am his culprit.

1270
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,760
What are you saying?
- He has gone.

1271
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,320
What are you saying?
- His face was covered with blood.

1272
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,240
I saw Chandru today.

1273
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,400
I'd come here to save him.

1274
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,880
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1275
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,040
Chandrashekhar.

1276
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,440
What are you saying?

1277
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,480
He was at that place.
- Yes, he's the one.

1278
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,680
Nurse, take care of her.
I'll be back soon.

1279
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,360
I don't know whose head
was chopped off...

1280
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,920
but he wasn't an Indian.

1281
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,880
Maybe Chandru is still alive.

1282
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,640
Only a nice lawyer can give
us all the details.

1283
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:33,800
Otherwise we cannot do anything.

1284
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,920
There is a lawyer here who
is my father's friend.

1285
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,800
This is his address.

1286
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,560
Okay, I will take you.

1287
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,080
Come with me.

1288
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,320
We won't get the official
details...

1289
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,840
about who was punished today.

1290
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,880
But I have met few people inside.

1291
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,840
We will come to know about
it till tomorrow morning.

1292
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,560
Take some rest. Don't worry.

1293
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,280
God is there with us.

1294
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:24,360
Madam,
madam what has happened to you?

1295
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,840
Ma'am. What has happened?

1296
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,280
Get up. Iqbal's head was
chopped off yesterday.

1297
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,800
Then the sword broke off...

1298
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,280
so that is why punishment of
the rest has been delayed.

1299
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,760
Chandru is alive. He is safe.

1300
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,600
Madam, say something. Madam.

1301
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,880
Your Chandru is still alive.
Let's go and meet him.

1302
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,480
Chandru...

1303
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:47,600
Shreela, have you come alone?

1304
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,400
Hasn't grandmother come?

1305
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,480
Is she fine?

1306
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:58,080
Grandmother couldn't come here,
Chandru.

1307
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,400
She had an attack.

1308
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,920
She is stable now.

1309
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:06,040
There is nothing to worry.

1310
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,280
Shiva is with her.

1311
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:13,320
Don't worry, Chandru.
Everything will be fine.

1312
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,280
Don't worry Chandru.

1313
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,160
I've applied for the bail.

1314
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,520
Shreela, over here...

1315
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,560
Shreela, I am very scared.

1316
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,160
Very scared.
- Hey.

1317
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,680
You cannot be shattered
till I'm there.

1318
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,360
It happened because of me.

1319
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,080
I feel so guilty.

1320
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,720
Thanks.

1321
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,200
There.

1322
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,400
(Other Language)

1323
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,040
Autistic are immune to law.

1324
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:57,200
No religion teaches this and
especially Islam does not.

1325
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:58,800
The travel agent should be punished.

1326
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,880
I am talking to the government.

1327
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:15,840
This protest has been initiated
worldwide by Miss Shreela Rajan.

1328
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,480
After the heinous act of beheading
an autistic kid Iqbal...

1329
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,320
the world is looking at
Baslistan government...

1330
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,560
for a fair trial to save Chandru.

1331
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,880
The Baslistan government
has to act fast...

1332
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,920
and provide an answer
to the protest.

1333
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,320
I've come all the way from
India to free Chandru.

1334
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,760
Mr. Chandrashekhar
people like you...

1335
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,720
who come from other countries...

1336
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:02,320
should know the rules and
regulations of our country.

1337
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,360
And they should follow it.

1338
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,240
Let me tell you that these rules
and regulations aren't new.

1339
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,440
But for centuries they're
being followed.

1340
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,880
And because of this people lead...

1341
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,040
a responsible life in our country.

1342
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,520
People from out who are protesting
don't know...

1343
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:22,240
and that is why we want to tell
them what your crime is.

1344
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:25,680
We want to set up an example.

1345
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,400
You were arrested here with drugs...

1346
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:28,960
and a case was started on you.

1347
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,720
And in that you were found guilty.

1348
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,200
That is why this court gives
you death as punishment.

1349
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,600
One month from today you'll
be given this punishment.

1350
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:40,360
(Other Language)

1351
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,480
That's it, Shreela.

1352
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:12,720
You did so much for me.

1353
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,600
I won't go back without you...

1354
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,520
no matter how many days it takes.

1355
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,520
Go. Please go back.

1356
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,680
And marry the guy your
father chooses.

1357
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:31,960
It's over.

1358
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,280
Take care of grandma.

1359
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,560
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

1360
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:11,840
Thank you.

1361
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:20,240
I have seen him before.

1362
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,920
This is Malik.

1363
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,160
Malik.

1364
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,360
Shall we go? - Look at that boy
carefully who is behind me.

1365
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:43,200
Hey, Malik.

1366
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,400
I had sent him.

1367
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:51,440
He was sentenced to death
in the drug case.

1368
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,400
Then how is he alive.

1369
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:56,480
I don't care.
No one knows that I'm alive.

1370
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,240
Before the Indian government comes
to know about me, kill him.

1371
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,400
Do you understand, you idiot.

1372
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:24,040
I am Abdul Rashid for this country.

1373
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:33,440
To earn the name of an honest
citizen, it took me 15 years.

1374
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:36,240
And today I'm a clean
and honest citizen...

1375
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,160
of this prestigious country.

1376
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,400
You all know that to make a plan
of my death in India...

1377
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:46,320
I had to do so much hard work.

1378
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,840
In this country I found such
a man who resembled me.

1379
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,480
Poor man,
he didn't know that he is...

1380
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,280
going to die an untimely death.

1381
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:02,280
According to Indian government
Malik is dead.

1382
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,280
I am a dead man...

1383
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,480
and the case is closed.

1384
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,800
I'll get tomorrow the
reward of efforts...

1385
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,360
put in by me for so many years.

1386
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:21,320
Look. There is a multi-million
dollar deal.

1387
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:26,160
After tomorrow,
I'll become richer than Ambani.

1388
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:31,400
In tomorrow's function the prince
will put his stamp on it.

1389
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,960
No problem of any kind
should come up.

1390
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,040
And I won't let it happen.

1391
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,080
One more thing.

1392
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,120
Outside the court I saw
Chandru's girlfriend.

1393
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:47,720
Maybe she also knows about you.
We need to find out.

1394
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,120
Who is this girl? Who is she?

1395
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,320
I want that girl.

1396
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:06,560
Ruffian, are you telling me now?

1397
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,480
I would have killed you here but...

1398
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:12,520
I'm sparing you because
only you recognize her.

1399
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:16,040
Just find her out and kill her.

1400
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,280
Do you understand?

1401
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:21,040
This is the last chance
for you to live.

1402
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:22,840
I will do it. I will do it.

1403
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:34,120
Goodbye.

1404
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,560
Hello, a dangerous terrorist
was killed today...

1405
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:45,800
in a shoot-out in Colaba.

1406
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:47,160
The most wanted terrorist for...

1407
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:48,480
a long time, Sultan Malik Shah...

1408
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:51,160
was killed by ACP Anwar and...

1409
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,800
his team in Mumbai.

1410
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:57,720
He was announced most wanted
terrorist in many countries.

1411
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,640
Why are you hitting me? Huh?

1412
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,680
(Other Language)

1413
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,760
Malik.

1414
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,720
I'll kill every Indian
dog who comes here.

1415
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,200
I will kill the Indians.

1416
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:07,040
You know what you'll meet your
girl friend in the hell.

1417
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,560
We are going to kill her tonight.

1418
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,280
You took the wrong name.

1419
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:57,880
This is for Iqbal.

1420
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:02,800
Listen,
shall I open the door for you.

1421
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,040
Sir.

1422
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,240
Key?

1423
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,920
Who is that?

1424
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:23,400
Hey, Chandru.

1425
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:29,000
How did you escape?

1426
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:30,760
I will tell you this later.

1427
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:32,040
We've to leave from here
as soon as possible.

1428
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:34,760
Malik's men would be finding us.
- Malik... - Yes.

1429
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:37,960
Malik... who Malik?
- I'll tell you about Malik later.

1430
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:40,960
Fast, fast, fast.

1431
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:43,960
Stop. Ma'am.

1432
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:50,120
Hello. Do you know them?

1433
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:55,040
Shreela,
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

1434
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,920
You pack everything and
wait downstairs.

1435
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,800
Where are you going now, Chandru?

1436
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:03,200
I'll come back and tell you.
Wait for me.

1437
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,080
Chandru, listen.

1438
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,360
Hello, sir. You know these guys.

1439
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:11,440
You, sir. Sure.

1440
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:15,360
How are you Hari sir?
Is everything fine?

1441
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,040
Hey, what is this? Who are you?

1442
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,360
Who are you?
Sir, didn't you recognize me?

1443
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:24,240
I'm Chandru whom you're
looking for crazily.

1444
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,560
Look, is this me?

1445
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,040
Am I the one? Look carefully.
- You...

1446
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:31,840
Hey.

1447
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:35,160
Hey.

1448
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:37,120
Stop.

1449
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,920
We've found the address of the girl.
Come on.

1450
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,240
Go to that hotel.

1451
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:50,080
Hello, yeah, that's right.
Shreela Rajan.

1452
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,160
Okay, I am coming down.

1453
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:56,040
You wait here, and rest behind me.

1454
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,200
Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

1455
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,680
Alright, thank you.

1456
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,160
You must pay there.
- Yeah.

1457
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,520
Is this girl staying here?
- No idea.

1458
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:31,840
Is she here?
- Yes, she is.

1459
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:43,480
Hurry up and check.

1460
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,840
She is in her room.

1461
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,840
What had I done?
Why did you cheat me?

1462
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,240
Because of you I would've died.
Iqbal died.

1463
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:34,600
Did he ever wrong you?

1464
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:37,520
Now tell me how did
Malik become alive?

1465
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:39,720
Just by taking his name everyone
is after my life.

1466
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:42,040
What is the connection between
you two? Tell me!

1467
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:44,320
I'll tell you. I'll tell you
but don't do anything to me.

1468
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:55,800
Hello.
- Hello, madam. Saaji speaking.

1469
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:57,760
Get out of the room.

1470
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,280
Come out from the back door
and I'll meet you there.

1471
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:06,480
Open the door.
- Okay.

1472
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:13,960
Go and see inside.

1473
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:16,640
Don't go near Malik.

1474
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:19,600
If he comes to know then he'll
kill you and your family.

1475
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,960
That mad boy was killed.

1476
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:26,560
You had seen it.

1477
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:29,680
In one attempt the
head is cut off...

1478
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,760
and the man flutters in
pain as if a cut hen.

1479
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:34,720
That was to happen with that mad
boy. As it's he was of no use.

1480
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,280
Good that he died.
What are you thinking?

1481
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,000
(Other Language)

1482
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,800
Hey, she escaped.

1483
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:15,280
Go there.
- Come on.

1484
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:03,400
Go that side.

1485
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:25,520
Madam, madam.

1486
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:25,120
(Other Language)

1487
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,120
Hurry up.
- Hurry up and sit inside.

1488
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,800
Hey.

1489
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:48,760
Now it isn't at all safe for
you to stay in this city.

1490
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:51,840
I'll take you to Baba where
everyone respects Baba.

1491
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:54,840
Only he can help those people
who have been cheated.

1492
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,640
Baba.
- Who?

1493
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,120
Baba.

1494
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:03,000
Baba, I am Saaji.

1495
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,680
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1496
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:09,120
We need passport, Baba.

1497
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:10,320
Come.

1498
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:11,920
Come.

1499
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,520
Please, come.

1500
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:20,640
Come on change.

1501
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:49,440
Take this madam.
- Thanks.

1502
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:02,320
Shreela,
when I met you for the first time...

1503
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:05,520
Malik was killed in a shoot-out.

1504
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:10,240
He has become Abdul Rashid.

1505
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:14,720
So businessman Abdul Rashid and
terrorist Malik are the same.

1506
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:42,720
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
- Okay, sir.

1507
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:51,120
Sir, Malik.
But he was killed in an encounter.

1508
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:52,800
Who has sent you this?

1509
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:54,160
Chandru.

1510
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:03,120
Here are your passports
and travel documents.

1511
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,680
Take care of them.

1512
02:13:05,160 --> 02:13:06,400
Take this child.
- Thanks.

1513
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:07,600
Saaji, come here.

1514
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:11,400
If you have to leave from here...

1515
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:13,160
you will have to cross this desert.

1516
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:16,160
Did you inform Bashir?
- Yes Baba. - Okay.

1517
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:18,120
With the help of Bashir
you can reach...

1518
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:19,840
the country through this route.

1519
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,800
The rules of this country
aren't applicable there.

1520
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,360
Good bye.
- Good bye.

1521
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:30,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my honour to welcome...

1522
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,720
the board members and the
executive committee...

1523
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:35,560
and the honorable secretary.

1524
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:38,440
And I take great amount of pride...

1525
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:41,640
to welcome the most powerful
business entrepreneur...

1526
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:43,800
Mr. Abdul Rashid.

1527
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:50,840
Stay away from Malik's men.
We will be back soon.

1528
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:57,480
We are really proud
to be associated...

1529
02:13:57,560 --> 02:14:00,280
with this young and talent
entrepreneur.

1530
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:05,080
This association will take this
business to great height.

1531
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:08,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Abdul Rashid.

1532
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:14,760
Thank you.

1533
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:17,640
Thank you, sir.

1534
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:21,240
Good evening, everyone. Greetings.

1535
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:23,800
Today is a very big day of my life.

1536
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:27,400
I reached up to this
position because...

1537
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,960
I always walked on the path
of truth and honesty.

1538
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:34,840
Thank God.
Till today I haven't hurt anyone.

1539
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,480
For me the biggest achievement
is that...

1540
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,040
I'm being given this respect
in front of my family.

1541
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:41,400
If you walk on the path
of truth and honesty...

1542
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:43,360
then you will surely be successful.

1543
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:45,960
Besides, ladies and gentlemen...

1544
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,720
I'm proud to be a part of
this global association.

1545
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:49,800
Malik.

1546
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:52,680
You are surprised to see me alive.

1547
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:54,720
Even I'm surprised
to see you alive.

1548
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,760
Dear friends,
this is Sultan Malik Shah.

1549
02:14:58,120 --> 02:15:01,920
Yes, the man himself. He's on top
of the Indian Criminal list.

1550
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,360
The most wanted international
terrorist...

1551
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,240
presumed dead in India.

1552
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:09,400
But when I came here
I was surprised...

1553
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,840
to see that this man is alive.

1554
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:14,040
He's living by the name
of Abdul Rashid.

1555
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:15,640
Magic, isn't it?

1556
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:18,760
New name,
new family, new business deal.

1557
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:23,200
Malik, when I took your name
then you wanted to kill me.

1558
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:25,000
But today I finished you...

1559
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:27,920
and that also on the most important
moment of your life.

1560
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:30,080
Okay friends, the party is over.

1561
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:33,360
Wait. I and Malik?
This is a fabricated story.

1562
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:35,480
This man is lying.

1563
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:37,520
Malik, game over.

1564
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:39,520
Everyone sitting here
has come to know...

1565
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:41,080
that you aren't Abdul Rashid.

1566
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:45,600
Indian government and this
government have completed talks.

1567
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:49,080
Breaking news about you is being
shown on every TV station.

1568
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:51,840
Do you want to see? Wait. Hold this.

1569
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,440
Ruffian, he spoiled everything.

1570
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:17,240
Run Malik, run! Run for your life.

1571
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:26,080
Ruffian... how did he escape alive?

1572
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:27,960
How did he come out of the jail?

1573
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:30,560
What was jailer Naseer
and Hari Das doing?

1574
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:32,360
Sir, he killed both of them.

1575
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:37,200
I don't know anything.
Kill him somehow.

1576
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:39,880
Do you understand?
- Yes.

1577
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:49,320
Take my family and drop them
at the airport. Right now.

1578
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:50,760
Yes sir.

1579
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,560
Keep the car ready. Fast.

1580
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,280
Come on! Let's go quickly.

1581
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:04,560
Go, go, go...

1582
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:08,800
Come on.

1583
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,520
Get down here quickly.

1584
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:23,280
Go there and Bashir Baba is
waiting for you there.

1585
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:24,840
Listen, keep this phone with you.

1586
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:26,520
Now go from here quickly.
- Thanks.

1587
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:29,320
Thanks, brother.
- Leave the formalities and go now.

1588
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:03,840
Where are they?
- They have gone?

1589
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:05,680
What?
- They have left, deaf.

1590
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:08,920
Okay, then I will send you first.

1591
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:15,200
What happened, Afzal?

1592
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:16,720
Sir, they both have escaped.

1593
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,600
Desert.

1594
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:32,880
Sir, they both have come.

1595
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:35,600
Come on.

1596
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:39,280
Baba? One second.

1597
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:42,440
Hello.

1598
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:45,240
(Other Language)

1599
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:50,040
Hasna!

1600
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:11,280
Shri.
We haven't done anything wrong so...

1601
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:12,480
nothing will happen to us.

1602
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,040
No.

1603
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:02,840
Come.

1604
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:12,520
(Other Language)

1605
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:22,800
Thank God that we've come
closer to the border.

1606
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:24,640
Now there is nothing
to be scared of.

1607
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:40,960
Just follow them.

1608
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:10,480
Turn around.

1609
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:14,440
Chandru, my foot.

1610
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:15,560
Oh God!

1611
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,200
Chandru.

1612
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:50,840
Darn!

1613
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,480
Come on, Shreela! Push.

1614
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:07,520
Come on!

1615
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:10,160
Shreela! Are you okay?

1616
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,560
I hope nothing has happened to you.
- I'm fine.

1617
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,600
Chandru, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1618
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:41,800
Malik.
