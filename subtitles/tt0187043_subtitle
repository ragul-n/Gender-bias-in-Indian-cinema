1
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:31,654
Asha.. what happened.. is
it a boy or a girl?

2
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:33,374
Asha.. Asha.. Asha..

3
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:37,014
Excuse me Mr. Dalal.
- Yes.

4
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,584
Here's your baby.

5
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:40,293
This.. is it a boy?

6
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,574
Oh no.. it's a girl.. congratulations.

7
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:47,414
It's a girl.. and you are
congratulating me?!

8
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,014
Don't you feel any shame?
Take her away.

9
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:50,614
Where shall I take her?!

10
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:52,013
Take her to hell.. throw
her in a dustbin.

11
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,534
What nonsense Mr. Dalal..
don't be so rude.

12
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:55,894
Decosta..

13
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:59,534
Hi Mr. Dalal.. congratulations..
you have got a daughter.

14
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,614
What congratulations man..
I am being ruined here.

15
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,014
My wife's father.. my father in-law..

16
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,014
He is owner of five shoe factories.

17
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,014
He has kept one condition that if
my wife gives birth to a boy..

18
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:11,654
Then he'll transfer all the
factories in my son's name.

19
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:13,654
And if she gives birth
to a daughter..

20
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,374
Then he'll donate his property to
beggars and make me a beggar.

21
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,814
He seems to be quite a fool.
- Oh yes..

22
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,654
But if I become a beggar..
I will not be alone.

23
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,014
You also will become a
beggar along with me.

24
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,208
What are you saying man?!

25
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,013
Oh yes.. because we are partners.

26
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:26,414
If we are partners in profit..

27
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,294
Then we will also have to
share the loss equally.

28
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,254
I will tell the whole world..
I will tell the law..

29
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,494
That you were just an ordinary
medical assistant..

30
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,774
That you bought duplicate
certificates..

31
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,374
And you became a doctor by those
duplicates certificates.

32
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:39,534
And your wife Julie will
immediately divorce you.

33
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:40,915
Oh shut up man.

34
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:43,014
Now I will tell you a way
to shut down this shut up.

35
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:45,614
My problem will be solved
if you help me.

36
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,054
And your problem will also go away..

37
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:48,214
The solution is this..

38
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,328
I will change my daughter
with some..

39
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:53,597
..boy who has taken birth
in your hospital.

40
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:55,214
And I will adopt that boy.

41
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,854
Congratulations inspector
Khanna.. you've got a boy.

42
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,081
I have got a boy?!

43
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:05,894
Oh no.. its you who has got
a boy.. we have got a boy.

44
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,014
Thanks god.. are you all right?

45
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:11,894
Oh yes.. but we both were
waiting so much for you.

46
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:13,178
Oh.. both of you were
waiting for me?!

47
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:15,094
Oh yes.. myself and your son.

48
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:16,254
Oh!

49
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:22,694
Well junior inspector.. did
you like your parents?

50
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:25,934
Now you will have to
come back home early.

51
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:27,094
Why?

52
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:30,334
Because we both will be
waiting for you now.

53
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,894
Congratulations inspector sahib..

54
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,813
Now when are you going
to give me sweets?

55
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,574
I will go and bring sweets..
and imported chocolates.

56
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,054
Oh my baby..

57
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,734
So you are sleeping.

58
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,534
Hello.
- Is this a boy or a girl?

59
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:50,546
A boy.

60
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,496
Whose boy is it?
- Inspector Kapil's.

61
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:14,534
Shut up..

62
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,573
I don't want a daughter who will
take away alimony with her.

63
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,014
I want a boy who will
bring alimony with him.

64
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,054
What are you doing Mr. Dalal?

65
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:40,894
Oh Ms. Ruby..

66
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:46,294
I've heard that you want to go to
London to you're your boy-friend?

67
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,494
Otherwise he will
marry someone else.

68
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,454
Am I right?
- Oh yes.

69
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:54,822
I'll give you the money for
return ticket and expenses.

70
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:56,043
I will give you everything.

71
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:59,494
If you change the registration
of these children.

72
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:01,654
Okay?

73
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:03,871
Okay.

74
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:07,253
You have given birth to a boy.

75
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,894
Boy.. but nurse was telling
me that it's a girl?!

76
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:13,411
That nurse has gone mad.. it's a boy.

77
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,734
But a girl is also incarnation
of goddess Laxmi.

78
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:17,734
What Laxmi?!

79
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:21,791
When a girl is born.. she takes
away all the money in alimony.

80
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:27,003
Come on give me my boy..
oh my dear boy.

81
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:28,174
You have got a daughter.

82
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:29,004
What?!

83
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,054
Oh yes.. you've given
birth to a daughter.

84
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:32,534
Number 108.

85
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,414
From where have you
brought this child?

86
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:38,294
Bring my boy.

87
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,230
This is your daughter only.
- No.

88
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:44,374
Mr. Dalal said that he'll give
me all the expenses for London.

89
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,494
If he doesn't give me then
I will tell everyone.

90
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,444
Oh keep quiet.. speak slowly.

91
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:48,689
If he doesn't give you..
then I will give you.

92
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,614
Oh yes.
- Give her some coffee.

93
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:51,664
Oh yes.. how much sugar?

94
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,014
What sugar man!

95
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:56,094
Don't you know that today's girls
care about their figure?

96
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:58,534
They don't consume sugar
but saccharine.

97
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,414
Sugar makes you overweight..
specially girls.

98
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,845
While she is drinking this coffee..

99
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,294
Go and arrange for her ticket.

100
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,294
Drink this.. I will arrange
for your departure.

101
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,694
You will go very comfortably.

102
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:13,174
Drink it.

103
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:21,494
What is it?

104
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,734
They have changed my child.

105
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:25,349
Don't be silly! - Really!

106
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,574
It must be by some mistake.

107
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:29,894
Nurse take this child in the ward..
- Our boy must be there.

108
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:32,329
No sir.. there is no other
child except this.

109
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,294
What?! - What nonsense..
it must be some mistake.

110
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:36,534
I will go and see myself.

111
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:39,814
Decosta.. Decosta..

112
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:43,054
Decosta.. what is this nonsense.

113
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:45,614
Someone has taken my boy
and kept this girl there.

114
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:47,214
Don't you know my wife
is a heart patient?

115
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:48,693
Don't shout inspector Kapil..

116
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:50,734
This is a hospital.. not
your police station.

117
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:51,805
Where is nurse Ruby?

118
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:53,214
Ruby?!

119
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,574
She must have committed suicide.

120
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:06,014
Inspector Kapil.. she
was very worried..

121
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,814
..after reading her
boyfriend's letter.

122
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,573
This is definitely
a case of suicide.

123
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:10,734
This can also be a murder.

124
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:13,901
Inspector Kapil.. you
always try to prove..

125
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,574
..me an accused on the
basis of your doubts.

126
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:17,154
But I always..

127
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:19,214
Go scot-free.. but not this time.

128
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:23,013
Where is our child?

129
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:25,614
We'll find him.. we'll
definitely find him.

130
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,445
These hospital people have..

131
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:31,013
What.. has something happened to him?

132
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,174
Oh no.

133
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,111
Is he ill?

134
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:35,374
Oh no.. no..

135
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:40,614
Then bring him here..
I am very scared.

136
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,614
I am getting very bad thoughts.

137
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:44,814
Why don't you keep quiet?

138
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:52,494
There is no-one in this whole
hospital apart from this child.

139
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:53,502
What?!

140
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:55,854
Yes.. they have written
in the register..

141
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,254
..that you've given
birth to a daughter.

142
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:00,174
Who has written that?

143
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:01,334
The hospital management.

144
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:06,094
But don't worry.. I will see them.

145
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,574
I will arrest Decosta.

146
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:12,894
But I won't get my son back by that.

147
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:14,094
Yes we'll get.. we'll get him.

148
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:15,294
I will legally..

149
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,251
Shanti.. Shanti..

150
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,494
These people have hidden
my boy somewhere.

151
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:34,014
I have given birth to a boy only.

152
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:35,174
Nurse?

153
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:40,134
Promise me that you'll
bring back my boy.

154
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:43,454
Promise me.. please.

155
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,734
Shanti.

156
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,894
Doctor! Nurse!

157
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:58,733
Doctor.. see what has
happened to her?

158
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,734
What is the proof of this
thing that you had a boy?

159
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,242
The proof was that nurse who had..

160
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,093
..given me the news
that I had got a boy.

161
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:10,774
Suddenly that nurse
committed suicide.

162
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,334
I think that nurse was murdered.

163
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:17,054
So as there is no witness
to this case.

164
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:20,013
The post mortem report
of that nurse..

165
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:22,294
..has been submitted to
this court my lord.

166
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,930
This is a lie me lord..

167
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,490
Because the chairman
of the hospital..

168
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,014
..Mr. Decosta can do anything.

169
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,814
This is a lie..
- Order.. order.

170
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:31,014
Sorry sir.

171
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:33,541
Inspector Khanna.. you will have..

172
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,294
..to present some witness
in this case.

173
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:40,774
And till this case is decided.. you
will keep this child with you.

174
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:43,734
No me lord.. I want justice.

175
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,013
I don't want consolation
in the name of justice.

176
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:50,312
In this condition.. this court can
handover the child to any-one..

177
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:56,574
Who will take care of this child
till this case is decided.

178
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:59,014
Yes my lord.. I will take
care of this child.

179
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:06,122
This court is approving
five hundred rupees..

180
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:08,374
..per month for the upbringing
of this child.

181
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:12,014
And inspector Khanna will
have to pay that amount.

182
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:15,734
Very well sir.. what more do I need.

183
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:21,058
And this court is instructing
police department to..

184
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,654
..submit the report to this court
after all the investigations.

185
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:30,733
Inspector tell me that why
have you called me here?

186
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:34,014
Mr. Decosta.. you would know
that some years back

187
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:39,299
.. some students started their
practice after getting..

188
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:44,014
.. duplicate certificates
form a medical university.

189
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,613
And they started playing with
the lives of patients.

190
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,093
Out of those duplicated doctors..

191
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:53,014
You are also one duplicate doctor.

192
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:57,214
What is this nonsense?!

193
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:58,374
Shut up.

194
00:11:58,454 --> 00:11:59,918
You are the owner of the hospital..

195
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:01,814
..where duplicate
medicines are used.

196
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:05,614
Where patients are neglected.. and
they're made to suffer and die.

197
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,414
Many reputed doctors have become..

198
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:09,174
..infamous because
of people like you.

199
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,894
This is a lie and nonsense.

200
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,942
These press reporters always
demand money from me.

201
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:15,694
And when I don't pay them, they
print anything about me.

202
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:17,174
You are doing illegal business.

203
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,894
You can not prove that.

204
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:19,905
I can prove that.

205
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:21,414
Oh that's impossible.

206
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:22,894
Its not impossible.

207
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,176
Mr. Decosta.. your office is being
searched at this moment.

208
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,454
What?!

209
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:37,904
We have searched every corner
of Mr. Decosta's..

210
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:40,134
..home and office.. but
we didn't get anything.

211
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,094
You didn't get anything?!

212
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:50,574
You can go.

213
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:55,014
Your file.

214
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,016
I have heart that inspector Kapil
has gone to meet Aazam Khan.

215
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,334
To ask him for his help.

216
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,454
So as he can create
evidence against us.

217
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:15,947
Mr. Dalal.. Aazam Khan
is in the jail.

218
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:25,094
Welcome Kapil Khanna.

219
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:31,534
Aazam Khan.. but what
you did is not good.

220
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,534
Well what can I do.. it's a habit.

221
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:36,374
We have sent you to jail so as
you can get rid of this habit.

222
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:40,294
But today I have come with
some important work.

223
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,093
Just order me man.. my life
is at your service.

224
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:48,814
Proof.. I can not get any
proof against Decosta.

225
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:52,054
You must have opened many
safes for Decosta.

226
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,894
But if you help the law just once..

227
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:56,733
I will definitely help the law..

228
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:59,454
Because of him your wife and
my sister lost her life.

229
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:02,894
Because of him you were separated
from your child.

230
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,174
I will send him to jail
along with proof.

231
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:08,774
Thank you..

232
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:13,374
Government has pardoned your
remaining sentence for this.

233
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:15,534
Thank you my friend.. thank you.

234
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:35,334
Even if he is released.. he won't
find the safe containing proof.

235
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:38,214
But what if he finds that safe?

236
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:46,774
I am still stuck on that
'if'.. answer my question.

237
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:52,734
Even if he finds that safe..
he won't be able to open it.

238
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,454
And what if he opens that safe?

239
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,214
What if that 'if' thing
really happens?

240
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,538
Kill him.

241
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,014
'Aazam Khan has been murdered..'

242
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:39,694
'Go to the police station and
take its blame on yourself..'

243
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,253
'You will get ten thousand
rupees now..'

244
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,694
'And ten thousand after
your sentence is over.'

245
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:47,894
Very well.

246
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:49,201
Hey Banto.

247
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:50,325
What is it?

248
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:53,093
My life's stars are shining.

249
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:55,143
See this.. I am going to get money.

250
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,574
Speak with some sense..

251
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:57,814
You are always drunk.

252
00:16:57,894 --> 00:17:00,534
I swear by you my sweetheart..
see this.

253
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:03,894
I have been given an offer
to go to jail for money.

254
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,774
Dalal is paying me twenty
thousand for that.

255
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,414
But what kind of blame
you will have to take?

256
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,013
The blame of a murder.

257
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:13,334
Twenty thousand rupees for
twenty years sentence.

258
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:16,374
Twenty thousand rupees for
twenty years sentence?!

259
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,454
How much money you got to take
this blame on your head?

260
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,294
What are you saying
inspector sahib?!

261
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,493
Who will go to jail for money?

262
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:26,334
By god.. I have done this murder.

263
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:28,654
How?

264
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:31,014
Jeep's light was very dim
and I met that accident.

265
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:32,254
I got scared and ran away.

266
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:35,333
No.. it was not an accident.

267
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:38,813
My friend was deliberately
killed with that jeep.

268
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:40,293
Who are these people?

269
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:42,614
I don't know.. I am telling
you the truth.

270
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:45,134
You don't know..

271
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:50,414
Tell me.. who murdered
my friend Aazam Khan?

272
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:51,813
I murdered him.

273
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:53,214
Tell me who murdered him?

274
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:55,294
I am telling you the truth..
I murdered him.

275
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,054
No.. you are lying.

276
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:02,694
You are helping crime by taking
that blame on your head.

277
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:04,614
Take him away!

278
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:10,734
Don't cry my dear.

279
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,305
If Aazam Khan was your father..

280
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,214
Then he also was my son.

281
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:19,254
Salaam sahib.

282
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:21,333
I am your father's friend.

283
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,333
Don't cry my dear.

284
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:25,894
I will take care of your education.

285
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:27,566
From today you'll live with me.

286
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:30,614
No.. no.. don't touch me.

287
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,333
Don't touch me.

288
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:35,488
My father would've been alive
today If you wouldn't have..

289
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:38,294
..got him released from jail
and made him work for police.

290
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:41,094
You are not my father's
friend but his murderer.

291
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:44,743
Go away from here.. I don't
want to even see your face.

292
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:45,833
No dear..

293
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:48,414
No.. - I am also very sorry
for Aazam's death.

294
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:54,053
No.. this is my father's ash.

295
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,214
I swear by this ash..

296
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:00,293
I will definitely revenge
my father's death.

297
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:05,014
And its not mine but it
is a government child.

298
00:19:05,214 --> 00:19:06,174
Government child?!

299
00:19:06,254 --> 00:19:09,174
Oh yes.. this is illegitimate child.

300
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:11,174
It doesn't have any
mother or father.

301
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:13,293
That's why the court
has given this to me.

302
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,614
And its also paying me monthly
expenses for its care.

303
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:17,174
Do you want to ask me anything else?

304
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:19,134
Why should I ask you anything?
- Then go from here..

305
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:21,042
Your husband is waiting
to break your nose.

306
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,454
What I have to do with you?

307
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:23,614
Then get lost from here.

308
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,014
Hey Banto?
- What is it?

309
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:30,494
Come here.. you have got a lottery
of five hundred rupees.

310
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,544
Lottery.. five hundred rupees?!

311
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,439
Oh yes.. hurry up.. give
me that lottery.

312
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:37,014
Where is that lottery.. take this.

313
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:41,094
Well done my dear.. you
have unlocked my luck.

314
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,014
Take these five hundred
rupees.. count them.

315
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:46,134
Today goddess Laxmi
has come to my house.

316
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:48,518
So from today your
name will be Laxmi.

317
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:13,520
"Devotees are singing songs in
the praise of goddess Laxmi."

318
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,333
"Please be and give us your
blessings of goddess Laxmi."

319
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:20,656
"Please be and give us your
blessings of goddess Laxmi."

320
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:24,374
"Laxmi is the wealth
of rich people.."

321
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:27,494
"Laxmi is the food
of hungry people."

322
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:31,534
"Laxmi is the wealth
of rich people.."

323
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:34,654
"Laxmi is the food
of hungry people."

324
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:38,408
"Devotees are singing songs in
the praise of goddess Laxmi."

325
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:41,894
"Please be and give us your
blessings of goddess Laxmi."

326
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:45,254
"Please be and give us your
blessings of goddess Laxmi."

327
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,174
"Jai Jai Shri.. Jai Jai Shri.."

328
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:48,813
"Say everyone.. Jai Jai Shri."

329
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:50,694
"Jai Jai Shri.. Jai Jai Shri.."

330
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:52,373
"Say everyone.. Jai Jai Shri."

331
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:54,088
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

332
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:55,813
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

333
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:58,014
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

334
00:20:58,094 --> 00:20:59,174
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

335
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:00,813
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

336
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:02,654
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

337
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,333
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

338
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:06,094
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

339
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:07,849
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

340
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,389
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

341
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,344
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

342
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:12,874
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

343
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:14,604
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

344
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:16,204
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

345
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:18,107
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

346
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,602
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

347
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:21,617
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

348
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,183
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

349
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:24,947
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

350
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:26,547
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

351
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:28,293
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

352
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:29,816
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

353
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,694
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

354
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,214
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

355
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,334
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

356
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:12,374
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

357
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:14,293
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

358
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:16,414
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

359
00:22:16,494 --> 00:22:18,293
"Come to our house goddess Laxmi.."

360
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:20,374
"Take away our poverty
oh goddess Laxmi."

361
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:22,374
"Come to our house goddess Laxmi.."

362
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,414
"Take away our poverty
oh goddess Laxmi."

363
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:26,454
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

364
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:28,614
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

365
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:30,454
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

366
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,734
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

367
00:22:52,774 --> 00:22:56,893
"It's yours.. it's yours.. this
whole world is yours."

368
00:22:56,974 --> 00:23:00,813
"It's yours.. it's yours.. this
whole world is yours."

369
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:04,814
"You are my mother in this
world oh goddess Laxmi."

370
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:08,814
"You are my mother in this
world oh goddess Laxmi."

371
00:23:08,894 --> 00:23:12,734
"Whether it's gold or silver..
come to me in every form."

372
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:16,494
"Whether it's gold or silver..
come to me in every form."

373
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:18,694
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

374
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:20,894
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

375
00:23:20,974 --> 00:23:22,694
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

376
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:24,893
"Say again Hail Laxmi."

377
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:10,694
"Oh goddess.. oh goddess.."

378
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:12,654
"You are the goddess of prosperity."

379
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,573
"Oh goddess.. oh goddess.."

380
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,614
"You are the goddess of prosperity."

381
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:18,503
"Oh goddess come to me.. come to me.."

382
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,734
"You are the goddess of currency."

383
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:22,534
"Oh goddess come to me.. come to me.."

384
00:24:22,614 --> 00:24:24,494
"You are the goddess of currency."

385
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:28,454
"My pockets are empty.. come &
fill them oh goddess Laxmi."

386
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:32,294
"My pockets are empty.. come &
fill them oh goddess Laxmi."

387
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:34,347
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

388
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:36,373
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

389
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:38,254
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

390
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,374
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

391
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:42,214
"Come to our house goddess Laxmi.."

392
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:44,254
"Take away our poverty
oh goddess Laxmi."

393
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:46,134
"Come to our house goddess Laxmi.."

394
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:48,134
"Take away our poverty
oh goddess Laxmi."

395
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:50,014
"Hail Laxmi, Hail Laxmi."

396
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:52,214
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

397
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,814
"Say with love.. Hail Laxmi."

398
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:18,694
Oh my god.

399
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:20,174
Oh Nathulal has come.. let's go.

400
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:22,613
Hey you.. where are you?

401
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:26,492
You put two extra charges on me..

402
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:28,654
I had to spend eighteen
years in jail.

403
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:30,486
Did he give you the money?

404
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,254
Oh yes I have brought
ten thousand rupees.

405
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:35,014
Take this and count it.

406
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:36,814
But where is my commission?

407
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:38,270
What commission.. get lost from here.

408
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,533
Hey man this is not fair.

409
00:25:39,614 --> 00:25:40,694
Oh come on.. get lost.

410
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:45,333
Where will you take all this money?

411
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:47,334
All this will remain
here when you die.

412
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:49,814
Why don't you shrug off some weight?

413
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:53,014
Donate something to
this blind woman.

414
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,734
Hey you.. how do you know
that I have money?

415
00:25:57,814 --> 00:25:58,894
You are blind..

416
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:01,414
I can see everything with
the eyes of my mind.

417
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:02,734
I can see this also..

418
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,734
That here you are giving alms..

419
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,894
And there a palace is
being built for you.

420
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:10,196
Give me.. give me something
more.. please..

421
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,054
Oh no.. take this one rupee more.

422
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:13,814
But don't let the work
of palace stop there.

423
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:15,347
Where are you going my son?

424
00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:17,254
Please help this blind
woman cross this road.

425
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,414
Your son?!
- Yes my son.

426
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,881
Now listen to her.. she
is calling me her son.

427
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,614
Come.. let's go.
- Come on.

428
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:24,639
Be happy son.
- Oh my waist.

429
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:25,894
Let's go my dear.

430
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:31,894
Money is above everything.

431
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:33,277
See this.

432
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:34,812
What.. have you brought
something today?

433
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,174
Open and see it. I have brought
ten thousand rupees for you.

434
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:39,654
Oh well my dear lion.

435
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:44,894
A sandal.. that girl.

436
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,254
Blind. that beggar woman.

437
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:52,774
Oh.. this old man has
reached my home!

438
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:53,807
She is the that one.

439
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:55,734
Oh Laxmi.. where are you going dear?

440
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:56,894
Come here.. please come..

441
00:26:57,814 --> 00:26:58,894
This is Laxmi.

442
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:01,494
And dear.. this is your father.

443
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:05,574
Oh.. this is my father!

444
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:07,814
He looks like a father
but is not a father.

445
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:09,014
What?!

446
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,014
Looks like a father
but is not a father!

447
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:14,374
Yes.. looks like a father
but is not a father.

448
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,293
But how would I know..

449
00:27:16,574 --> 00:27:19,094
That today I will have to
do this to my own father.

450
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:22,694
But you had become a blind
woman outside that jail.

451
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,333
I become anyone as per the time.

452
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:25,835
As per the time.
- What?

453
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,654
Yes.. a blind woman in the morning.

454
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:28,814
One legged woman in the afternoon..

455
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:30,727
A girl in the evening. And
an old woman at night.

456
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,573
Okay dear.. tell me one thing.

457
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:35,734
Ask me.

458
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,494
How did you take that money from..

459
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,322
..my armpit and put
that sandal there?

460
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:40,654
Get up.

461
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,414
Here I am.

462
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:43,894
It's nothing. Very simple

463
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,654
See here.. this is your money.

464
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:48,894
And this is my sandal.

465
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:51,454
Just a slight push..

466
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:53,894
Sir please help me cross this road..

467
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:58,573
What happened.. what did you do?

468
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:00,333
Nothing?
- No.

469
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,334
Then just open and see it.

470
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,014
Let me see.. sandal?!

471
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:06,174
Yes sandal.

472
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:08,494
My sandal is with you and
your money is with me.

473
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:10,214
Well.. no problem..

474
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,014
Our money is safe in our own house..

475
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:15,937
And my sandal in my feet.

476
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:22,334
By god you've trained
my daughter like me.

477
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:23,614
What else could I do?

478
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:26,134
Her father is not ready to
accept her as his daughter.

479
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,294
I get only five hundred rupees
per month from the court.

480
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,814
And what's the value of
five hundred rupees.

481
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:32,214
Hey listen.. tomorrow
is the court date.

482
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:36,054
Tell the court to increase the
amount to thousand rupees.

483
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:37,813
Okay.. okay.

484
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:42,894
How unfortunate a child I am.

485
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:48,254
I have a father.. but I don't
get father's love.

486
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,414
Commissioner sir?

487
00:28:56,454 --> 00:28:58,014
You are aware that I have been..

488
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:02,533
..living with strangers
since my childhood.

489
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:07,053
I've been longing for the love
of my mother and father.

490
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:11,894
I don't know anything about
my mother.. how she was.

491
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:14,134
I know about my father..

492
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:18,894
But he also is not
ready to accept me.

493
00:29:20,054 --> 00:29:23,134
Will I have to live all my
life in strangers' house?

494
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,134
Will I have to live on
strangers' earnings?

495
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:30,814
Won't I ever get my father's love?

496
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:34,694
Look Laxmi.. you can come
and stay at my home.

497
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,694
You will get everything you want.

498
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:39,094
But I won't accept
you as my daughter.

499
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,094
But why?

500
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:46,014
Because the day I accept
you as my daughter..

501
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:48,014
This case will be finished.

502
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:51,814
And I will never get my son.

503
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,614
You withdraw this case.

504
00:29:56,614 --> 00:30:01,254
Cases are not decided merely
on faith and intentions.

505
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:03,894
Maybe your son is..

506
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:08,774
No.. my son is alive.

507
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,214
I agree that law can not help
me in getting my son.

508
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:15,494
But I have full faith..

509
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:18,014
That wherever might be my son..

510
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:20,174
One day I will definitely meet him.

511
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,454
"The clock of my heart
says.. Tick.. Tick."

512
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:17,774
"It's telling me to always
you again and again."

513
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:22,734
"Come to me at six o'clock
in the evening."

514
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,174
"Go back at six o'clock
in the morning."

515
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:30,894
"The clock of my heart
says.. Tick.. Tick."

516
00:31:31,094 --> 00:31:34,054
"Its telling me to always
you again and again."

517
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:38,894
"Come to me at six o'clock
in the evening."

518
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:42,894
"Go back at six o'clock
in the morning."

519
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:19,254
"Ding dong-Ding dong.. dong.."

520
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,494
"Ding dong-Ding dong.. dong.."

521
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:26,734
"Ding dong.. Ding dong.. Ding dong."

522
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:48,014
"I have come here only for you.."

523
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:54,494
"I have brought this heart for you.."

524
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:57,894
"Have you got the guts to
accompany me for lifetime?"

525
00:32:58,094 --> 00:33:01,134
"Sweetheart I am a real man"

526
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:10,814
"For his entire life, o my beloved."

527
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:17,054
"Owns you someone here."

528
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:24,174
"I've made you mine."

529
00:33:28,294 --> 00:33:31,014
"The clock of my heart
says.. Tick.. Tick."

530
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:34,294
"It's telling me to always
you again and again."

531
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:39,174
"Come to me at six o'clock
in the evening."

532
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:43,094
"Go back at six o'clock
in the morning."

533
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:47,293
"The clock of my heart
says.. Tick.. Tick."

534
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:50,654
"It's telling me to always
you again and again."

535
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:55,414
"I will come to you at six
o'clock in the evening."

536
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:58,494
"I will go back at six o'clock
in the morning."

537
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,893
"Ding dong-Ding dong.. dong.."

538
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:26,054
"Ding dong-Ding dong.. dong.."

539
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:30,493
"Ding dong.. Ding dong.. Ding dong."

540
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:11,679
"Where would I find
this kind of beauty.."

541
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:17,814
"I am not able to take
my eyes off you.."

542
00:35:18,014 --> 00:35:24,174
"It's magic, I've lost my senses."

543
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:33,894
"We'll be together like.."

544
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:40,494
"..the hands of clock
meeting at 12 o'clock."

545
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:44,014
"Let the world be upset."

546
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:47,134
"You and I will not be separated."

547
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:54,094
"The clock of my heart
says.. Tick.. Tick."

548
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:57,413
"Its telling me to always
you again and again."

549
00:35:57,494 --> 00:36:02,214
"Come to me at six o'clock
in the evening."

550
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:06,094
"Go back at six o'clock
in the morning."

551
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,294
"The clock of my heart
says.. Tick.. Tick."

552
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:13,694
"It's telling me to always
you again and again."

553
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:18,533
"I will come to you at six
o'clock in the evening."

554
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,894
"I will go back at six o'clock
in the morning."

555
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:34,987
Well done.. well done.
- Take care.

556
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:38,294
You've done a great favour on us by
doing this show for our channel.

557
00:36:39,054 --> 00:36:41,014
Soon our sponsors
will deposit this..

558
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:43,414
..show's money in
your hospital fund.

559
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:46,334
She is mad about her
hospital project.

560
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,014
She brought me here
forcibly for that.

561
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:50,013
You dance very well.

562
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:52,334
Why don't you make this
your profession?

563
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:53,494
Oh yes.. why not.

564
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:56,574
You mean to say that I should
make dancing my profession?

565
00:36:56,977 --> 00:37:00,814
No sir.. this profession needs
a lot of hard work and sweat.

566
00:37:01,063 --> 00:37:03,496
And I have a habit of earning
money without wasting my sweat.

567
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:05,694
Hi dude.
- Hi Kimi darling.. how are you?

568
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:08,014
You had told us that you
will make our passes..

569
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:09,534
And you will take us to
London for the show.

570
00:37:09,614 --> 00:37:10,894
You have to go to London darling..

571
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:12,134
Then what's the big thing in that?

572
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:14,511
You know that my dad is
a police commissioner.

573
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:15,375
Oh really?!

574
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:17,134
You all don't know..
it's very strange.

575
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:19,149
He just has to put his
stamp on your papers.

576
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:20,814
Where are you meeting us tonight?

577
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:22,013
I will meet you tomorrow
in the hotel..

578
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:24,094
I mean I will meet you
tomorrow morning.

579
00:37:24,317 --> 00:37:25,334
Okay bye-bye see you.

580
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:29,774
Bye.. bye. - But you are
son of Mr. Dalal Jutawala..

581
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,014
Since when you've become son
of a police commissioner?

582
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:33,174
Try to understand darling.

583
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,701
These are beautiful girls..

584
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:37,014
And I am trying to set them with me.

585
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:40,374
Oh.. our marriage is being
fixed on one side..

586
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:42,214
And here you are trying
to set girls for you.

587
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:43,413
Try to understand darling.

588
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,814
Our marriage is being fixed..

589
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:46,014
We have not married yet.

590
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:47,254
Once I am married..

591
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:48,694
Then I will leave all these things.

592
00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:50,294
I will not even look
at another girl.

593
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,494
You hypocrite.

594
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:54,694
Reeta darling.

595
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:59,294
I think that he is romancing
me for my property.

596
00:37:59,374 --> 00:38:00,453
What?!

597
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:04,814
That Jutawala wants to encash
me by marrying his son to you?!

598
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:08,814
Dad.. I can kill him if you say so.
- Oh shut up..

599
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:10,521
You don't know anything
except killing anyone.

600
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:12,174
But dad.. I can do it.
- Oh leave me alone.

601
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:13,894
Listen dear.. do one thing.

602
00:38:14,454 --> 00:38:17,054
You keep playing that drama
of love with that Om.

603
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:18,614
Don't let him have any doubt.

604
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:22,013
Otherwise that Jutawala
will destroy such a big..

605
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,174
..hospital which I have
made in your name.

606
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:28,295
Jutawala sir.. we are here.

607
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,094
Oh.. welcome.. welcome.

608
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:32,614
I am Chinnapa Mallapa Shetty.

609
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:35,533
I have a readymade garment factory.

610
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:37,054
Please welcome.. please be seated.

611
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:40,052
Keep this dish here and
bag under the table.

612
00:38:40,744 --> 00:38:41,574
Tell me now.

613
00:38:42,694 --> 00:38:47,814
My daughter is sleeping with your
son's photo under her pillow.

614
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:51,053
And she has made a big photo of
your son and hanged it on a wall.

615
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:55,534
And she dips his small photo in
tea and eats it like a biscuit.

616
00:38:57,765 --> 00:38:59,013
Seete..

617
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:02,294
Om.. Om my darling.

618
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,134
We should immediately
fix their marriage.

619
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:06,413
Oh yes.. its all right..
but what about this?

620
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:07,574
What this?

621
00:39:07,654 --> 00:39:08,568
Don't hold my thumb.

622
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:10,774
Five lakh rupees alimony..
and half of it in advance.

623
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:12,013
Five lakh rupees!

624
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:13,574
Leave it if its too much for you.

625
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:15,174
I have a party offering
six lakh waiting outside.

626
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:17,718
Oh.. have you brought the money?
- Oh yes.. I have brought it. -

627
00:39:17,798 --> 00:39:19,013
Oh yes we have brought it..
we have brought it sir.

628
00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:20,894
Then why have you kept it
inside? Give it to me.

629
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:23,534
Did you see it son?

630
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,054
Yes dad. - This is called
Deepak Dalal Jutawala.

631
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,014
And this is called Om
Narayan Lace maker.

632
00:39:28,094 --> 00:39:29,174
See how I took his money.

633
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:30,694
One more party is coming.

634
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,054
Look brother.. now you
fix the marriage.

635
00:39:34,294 --> 00:39:35,694
Om?

636
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:38,614
Om.

637
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:40,574
Om.. do you like the girl?

638
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:45,294
Then give me two and half lakh
rupees advance of alimony.

639
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:49,534
Take these two and half lakh rupees.

640
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:53,214
Daddy.. we have take
these two advances.

641
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:54,454
But how will I marry twice?

642
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:55,614
What twice.. you won't
even marry once.

643
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:56,774
But how?

644
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:59,174
Oh man.. we are not going to marry
but do the business of marriages.

645
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:01,413
But what about the advance we have
taken? - We'll return that.

646
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:04,294
Okay.
- Have you got worms in your brain?

647
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:06,493
We have taken real notes from them..

648
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,614
We will take real notes and return
duplicate notes to them.

649
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,814
Isn't it a business?
- Well.. very well.

650
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:13,614
What are you saying?!

651
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:16,094
My daughter is not going
to marry your son?!

652
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:18,374
Look at him.. He had already married
to this bottle of liquor.

653
00:40:18,654 --> 00:40:19,734
I tried to make him understand..

654
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:22,053
That your daughter
is a bit less ugly..

655
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:24,614
Her father is a bit less
infamous in society.

656
00:40:24,694 --> 00:40:26,214
These people are a bit less cheats.

657
00:40:26,294 --> 00:40:27,614
But he is not ready to understand..
just look at him.

658
00:40:27,918 --> 00:40:28,774
We are less cheats?!

659
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:31,453
Oh no.. I say everything reversely
and put less against it.

660
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:33,013
If your daughter is beautiful..

661
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:35,014
Then I will say.. she is less ugly.

662
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:36,374
If I am happy..

663
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:38,014
Then I will say that
I am less unhappy.

664
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:39,494
Like he drinks very heavily..

665
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:41,254
But I say that he is
less in his senses.

666
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:42,413
Its not so difficult.

667
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:44,454
Like my father stays less quiet.

668
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:46,432
But what about that
two and half lakh..

669
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:47,614
..rupees of alimony
which we gave you?

670
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,254
We don't have that less money.

671
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:54,534
But why are you returning
me the alimony?

672
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:57,866
Look at my drunken father.

673
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:01,054
He started drinking liquor
after sleeping.

674
00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:03,534
And he kept drinking till
he got up in the morning.

675
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:04,694
Shameless father.

676
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:06,094
Whole night drunkard!

677
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,454
Full day drunkard.

678
00:41:09,574 --> 00:41:12,574
Your luck is bad.. your father
in law is a drunkard.

679
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:14,134
You count your money.

680
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:16,511
Oh yes I will count it.. you count
your steps back to your house.

681
00:41:16,592 --> 00:41:17,774
We will count our steps..

682
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:21,254
See this is the way
to count the steps.

683
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:24,094
You fool.

684
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:26,864
You stole that boy from my hospital..

685
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:29,734
And now you will marry that
boy with my daughter?!

686
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:33,654
And then you'll ask me for alimony?!

687
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:36,894
Oh no.. alimony.. I am not that mean.

688
00:41:37,254 --> 00:41:38,614
Then how mean you are?

689
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:40,413
I am meaner than that.

690
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:43,334
I will demand alimony from
you.. shame on my life.

691
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:44,494
I will spit on my own life.

692
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:46,014
What do you think of me?!

693
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:48,014
But why will I demand
any alimony from you.

694
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:49,454
You will yourself feel ashamed
and give it to me.

695
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:51,454
I don't want your whole hospital.

696
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:53,138
I will be happy with half of it.

697
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:54,774
Hey.. what's the number of this safe?

698
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:56,814
Shut up.. listen with your open ears.

699
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:58,013
Those are already open.

700
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:01,054
My daughter doesn't like your son.

701
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:03,574
She is not ready to marry
him at any cost.

702
00:42:04,614 --> 00:42:07,014
Mr. Decosta.. you are my less enemy..

703
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,073
So I am regarding that less enmity..

704
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,254
..and giving you this small advice.

705
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:15,014
That you should not
keep tomatoes and..

706
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:16,574
..your daughter for a
long time at your home.

707
00:42:16,894 --> 00:42:18,285
Because tomatoes will
remain fit to eat..

708
00:42:18,366 --> 00:42:20,094
And your daughter will not remain
fit for the marriage.

709
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:21,694
What do you mean.. tell me clearly.

710
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:23,814
I will tell you very
clearly.. but later.

711
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:26,894
But listen to this first.. you and
me are not separate from each other.

712
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:28,734
We belong to the same
community of criminals.

713
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,174
If you are Decosta.. then
I am Dalal Jutawala.

714
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:37,814
If you are a question.. then I'm
the answer to that question.

715
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:47,557
Yes.

716
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,494
Birju.. there is a job for you..

717
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:55,694
There is a girl.. Decosta's
daughter Reeta.

718
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:58,014
You have to teach her a lesson.

719
00:42:59,294 --> 00:43:01,973
And you know how to teach
a lesson to a girl.

720
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:23,614
Leave me.. leave me.

721
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:39,614
Leave me.

722
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:44,574
Don't be afraid my dear..
we are your lovers.

723
00:43:44,814 --> 00:43:47,214
You are not my lovers..
you are my slaves.

724
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,540
A slave..

725
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:49,574
A slave..

726
00:43:57,654 --> 00:44:01,094
We are not slaves my dear..
we are your kings.

727
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:02,493
King..

728
00:44:11,894 --> 00:44:14,174
And there is an ace above the king.

729
00:44:21,134 --> 00:44:22,414
Who are you.. come out.

730
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:28,534
A for ace and A for Akbar Khan.

731
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,054
I will just come my dear.

732
00:44:36,894 --> 00:44:38,254
You son of a joker..

733
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,214
You must have played lot
of card game till today..

734
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,787
But today this Akbar Khan will
teach..

735
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:50,094
you a new game of cards.

736
00:45:07,894 --> 00:45:09,013
Keep this with you.

737
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:35,574
Throw that cigarette here.

738
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,214
Tell me.. you will do romance?

739
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:46,294
You want to do more romance?

740
00:45:48,374 --> 00:45:50,613
Still you want to do
romance.. you idiot.

741
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,574
What?
- What?

742
00:46:00,654 --> 00:46:02,814
Romance?
- Oh no..

743
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:03,973
Then give me the keys.

744
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:14,734
Who else wants to see the magic?

745
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:29,134
Fantastic.. no-one will believe it.

746
00:46:29,214 --> 00:46:31,054
Is it so.. may god bless you.. bye.

747
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:33,014
Where are you going?

748
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:35,018
Oh.. you just did the wonder.

749
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,094
You beat these dangerous
thugs and saved my grace.

750
00:46:38,334 --> 00:46:40,254
Come.. I will tell my daddy
to give you some prize.

751
00:46:42,054 --> 00:46:48,597
Akbar Khan is not enslaved
to anyone's job or prize.

752
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:52,814
He earns his livelihood with hard
work and sleeps peacefully.

753
00:46:53,774 --> 00:46:55,214
He is not scared of death.

754
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:58,574
Because he doesn't have
anyone in this world.

755
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:01,814
But what's the harm
in taking a prize?

756
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:06,102
And a brave man like you
should get a lot more.

757
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:11,359
If I save the grace of
rich girls for prize..

758
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,454
Then who will save the
grace of poor girls?

759
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:17,054
If I am rich, then what's
my fault in that?

760
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,214
Yes there is a fault..

761
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:24,134
Why do you rich girls wear
these kind of clothes?

762
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:25,334
These kind of clothes?!

763
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:26,494
What kind of clothes?

764
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:29,060
These kind of clothes
will make me also..

765
00:47:29,371 --> 00:47:29,894
Shut up..

766
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,334
Now leave that and come
to my home with me.

767
00:47:35,454 --> 00:47:37,614
Akbar will come when
he feels like coming.

768
00:47:40,054 --> 00:47:41,134
You can go now.

769
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,294
Take this.. write your
address on any card.

770
00:48:02,187 --> 00:48:03,174
I will wait for you.

771
00:48:14,894 --> 00:48:19,174
R for Reeta and R for Rani.

772
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,094
Who is it?

773
00:48:43,774 --> 00:48:48,094
Aazam Khan.. you were dead..
how did you come down?

774
00:48:48,614 --> 00:48:50,414
Have you come on a ticket
or without ticket?

775
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,894
Have you come walking? Oh my god..

776
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:54,534
How can anyone come down like that?!

777
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:56,054
This is a world record.

778
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,374
Oh my god.. don't come towards me.

779
00:49:03,135 --> 00:49:04,734
Hey Decosta..

780
00:49:04,814 --> 00:49:06,053
What is it?

781
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:08,014
What kind of thing you
have brought here?

782
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:09,174
Who is it?

783
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:13,133
Where's your voice.. say something.

784
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:17,014
Aazam Khan.

785
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,613
You were saying he is dead..
see him.. he is alive.

786
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:24,183
Who is he?

787
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:26,694
Don't touch him.

788
00:49:26,774 --> 00:49:27,854
What is it?
- It's a soul.

789
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,013
You regarded a living person dead..

790
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:31,574
..after seeing a dead person alive.

791
00:49:35,654 --> 00:49:38,294
I have come here to ask both of you..

792
00:49:39,814 --> 00:49:42,174
Who is responsible for my death?

793
00:49:43,254 --> 00:49:45,894
Who is the person who
had murdered me?

794
00:49:46,094 --> 00:49:47,494
So you are not dead..

795
00:49:48,014 --> 00:49:51,454
You are alive and there can be
no murderer of a living person.

796
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:52,614
What say Mr. Jootawala?

797
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:55,494
You are very smart.

798
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,134
Who are you?
- I'll tell you daddy.

799
00:50:00,574 --> 00:50:04,094
He is the man who had saved
my grace and life.

800
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:06,014
I have called him here.

801
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,694
You had us scared..

802
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:11,814
But we didn't get scared..
we are also very brave men.

803
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:14,519
But we are less angry
with your bravery.

804
00:50:15,174 --> 00:50:17,134
Gentleman you are very brave.

805
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:19,013
You can ask me for
anything you want.

806
00:50:19,094 --> 00:50:22,054
See that my safe.. I want
to give you some reward.

807
00:50:24,214 --> 00:50:27,614
Akbar Khan never asks for his
reward.. he himself takes it.

808
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:30,054
Because he who ask for
something is a beggar.

809
00:50:30,814 --> 00:50:33,894
How to open this safe of yours?

810
00:50:39,014 --> 00:50:40,614
Akbar Khan knows about it.

811
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:46,336
Sweetheart.. just see the magic of
Akbar Khan.. son of Aazam Khan.

812
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:53,574
Shall I open your father's safe?

813
00:50:53,827 --> 00:50:54,734
Open it.

814
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,013
This is my reward.

815
00:51:10,094 --> 00:51:12,044
Oh great.. great.

816
00:51:12,476 --> 00:51:14,014
But tell me one thing dear..

817
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:17,533
Either I know the secret of
opening a safe like that..

818
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:20,414
Or your father Aazam
Khan knew about it.

819
00:51:21,134 --> 00:51:22,814
Where did you learn that?

820
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:24,694
Decosta I know it
since my childhood.

821
00:51:26,054 --> 00:51:28,454
This body has my father's
blood.. my father's face..

822
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:29,814
Then the intelligence must
also be my father's.

823
00:51:29,894 --> 00:51:33,894
Oh yes.. you got your father's
face.. blood and intelligence..

824
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:37,134
But its very sad that you
didn't get your father.

825
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,214
How mercilessly he was killed..

826
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,694
And that killer is languishing
in the jail.

827
00:51:43,774 --> 00:51:44,854
Where is he?

828
00:51:46,014 --> 00:51:47,094
How would I know?

829
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:48,254
What is his name?

830
00:51:49,894 --> 00:51:52,093
I will tell you his name
on one condition.

831
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:54,174
But don't tell my name to anyone.
- Tell me.

832
00:51:55,174 --> 00:51:57,814
His name is Nathulal.

833
00:51:58,494 --> 00:52:01,894
Nathulal.. come out.

834
00:52:02,614 --> 00:52:03,694
You can hide from your death..

835
00:52:03,774 --> 00:52:05,214
But you can not hide
from Akbar Khan.

836
00:52:05,578 --> 00:52:07,413
Where are you hiding?

837
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:10,013
What law will punish you..

838
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:12,814
Now I will punish you.

839
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:15,013
You had killed my father..

840
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:17,374
And his son Akbar Khan
has come to punish you.

841
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,014
Come out you rascal.

842
00:52:23,294 --> 00:52:25,334
Oh my god.. he is a
very dangerous man.

843
00:52:25,414 --> 00:52:26,494
Come inside.

844
00:52:26,574 --> 00:52:27,894
Nathulal.

845
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:32,134
Oh my god.. don't beat my husband.

846
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:38,014
I have not killed your father..
I didn't even know him.

847
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:39,814
Then why had you gone to jail?

848
00:52:40,086 --> 00:52:41,093
For money.

849
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:44,174
I'd been given money to take the
blame of murder on my head.

850
00:52:44,963 --> 00:52:46,814
What is his name?

851
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:48,774
Oh no.. I can not tell you.

852
00:52:48,984 --> 00:52:50,014
You can't tell me?

853
00:52:50,294 --> 00:52:52,294
Then be ready to die
for that murder.

854
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,723
Wait.. please wait.

855
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:02,374
You won't believe him
even if he tells you.

856
00:53:02,454 --> 00:53:03,814
Read this letter.. read it yourself.

857
00:53:04,227 --> 00:53:07,221
See this.. its his letter..
read it .. read it.

858
00:53:11,614 --> 00:53:13,254
'Aazam Khan has been murdered.'

859
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:16,493
'Go to police and take the
blame on your head.'

860
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:18,894
'You will get ten thousand
rupees now.'

861
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:23,614
'And ten thousand after
your sentence-Dalal.'

862
00:53:24,414 --> 00:53:25,494
Oh my god..

863
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:30,054
How insincere are people
in this world?!

864
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:35,533
They kill people and send
innocents to jail.

865
00:53:38,993 --> 00:53:40,534
You people have become
slaves to money.

866
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:44,413
You are afraid of poverty.

867
00:53:46,134 --> 00:53:48,014
You can do anything for money.

868
00:53:49,214 --> 00:53:51,894
But I will behead him and throw
his head at your feet.

869
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:55,814
Not only his head.. but his
children's head also.

870
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:01,093
If you tell anything to police..

871
00:54:02,094 --> 00:54:03,334
I have seen your house..

872
00:54:04,014 --> 00:54:06,094
This Pathan will come back.

873
00:54:14,014 --> 00:54:15,174
Hey you.. come here.

874
00:54:16,948 --> 00:54:18,013
Is this Ganga Nagar?

875
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:20,574
Did anyone come here?

876
00:54:21,574 --> 00:54:22,734
Was there any problem?

877
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,214
Why don't you say something..
are you people mute?

878
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,214
You are mute?

879
00:54:33,494 --> 00:54:35,534
You said that there is a
problem in Ganga Nagar.

880
00:54:36,134 --> 00:54:39,054
This is not Ganga Nagar.. this
is mute Nagar.. idiot.

881
00:54:39,414 --> 00:54:40,494
Come on now.. let's go.

882
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,013
Hey.. stop it.

883
00:54:48,014 --> 00:54:49,094
Who is it my dear.

884
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,254
I told you to apply brakes.

885
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:52,013
I had applied the brakes but
she jumped deliberately.

886
00:54:52,094 --> 00:54:53,654
She is unconscious still
poor girl is mumbling.

887
00:54:53,734 --> 00:54:54,894
What happened.. what happened?

888
00:54:56,222 --> 00:54:57,454
Now take her to the hospital..

889
00:54:57,534 --> 00:54:59,014
Or these people will beat
us and send us to hospital.

890
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:01,334
Dad.. this girl is beautiful..
we'll treat her at home.

891
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:03,574
You want us dead! Pick her up!

892
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,334
No-one will touch her.

893
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,654
Pick her up quickly. - Yes.

894
00:55:12,054 --> 00:55:13,254
Oh she is a gem of a girl.

895
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,534
Dad.. I am telling you.. make
her your daughter in law.

896
00:55:17,694 --> 00:55:19,494
Her face is shining like lightning.

897
00:55:20,054 --> 00:55:22,414
Hang her in our house.. you won't
have to pay electricity bill.

898
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:24,374
First listen to me.

899
00:55:25,894 --> 00:55:27,613
Our business is better.

900
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:30,894
You set the girls and bring
there parents to me.

901
00:55:31,214 --> 00:55:33,054
I will fix your marriage and
take alimony from them.

902
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:37,094
Then we'll cancel the marriage and
return them duplicate notes.

903
00:55:37,174 --> 00:55:38,254
This is our business.. understood?

904
00:55:38,783 --> 00:55:40,014
There is a hospital
there.. stop the car.

905
00:55:40,642 --> 00:55:41,334
Which one.. that?

906
00:55:43,094 --> 00:55:44,734
Wait.. wait.. wait.
- What happened?

907
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:47,894
She is awake.

908
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:50,174
Yeah she is making noise.

909
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:51,574
There is no need to
take her to hospital.

910
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:52,814
I think she has regained
consciousness.

911
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:55,294
No. Let us take her home.
- Again you are talking nonsense.

912
00:55:55,802 --> 00:55:56,774
Oh no.. she is such a beautiful girl.

913
00:55:57,094 --> 00:55:58,574
Oh my beautiful chicken.

914
00:56:01,448 --> 00:56:02,403
What happened?

915
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:03,654
How come your foot has become bent?

916
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:06,614
You dashed..
- You car over my foot.

917
00:56:07,694 --> 00:56:09,574
Oh.. your foot is broken.. very sad.

918
00:56:09,654 --> 00:56:10,734
Now go home.

919
00:56:11,694 --> 00:56:12,774
I won't go like that.

920
00:56:14,294 --> 00:56:15,374
You want money?

921
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:16,534
She is very smart.

922
00:56:20,434 --> 00:56:21,534
Take this.. go and have fun.

923
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:25,414
I wont take one rupee.

924
00:56:25,894 --> 00:56:27,013
Then how much you want?

925
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:28,454
Five rupees!

926
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,493
Five hundred rupees.. five
hundred rupees dad.

927
00:56:31,574 --> 00:56:32,654
Five hundred rupees!

928
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:34,254
Go and get lost from here. I have
not eaten since three days..

929
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:35,413
How can I pay you
five hundred rupees?

930
00:56:35,774 --> 00:56:36,854
What are you doing?

931
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,294
If you don't pay me..

932
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:40,613
I will tell public to beat you.

933
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:41,854
Are you blackmailing me?

934
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,694
Where did you come from to meet me?!

935
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:48,814
Coconut oil.. why are you
scratching your head?

936
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:53,894
Take this money also..
a gift from me.

937
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:56,134
At least leave this bag here.

938
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,453
You study?

939
00:57:00,454 --> 00:57:01,534
Listen?

940
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:06,294
Didn't you listen what
we were talking?

941
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:08,094
You are mute?

942
00:57:08,935 --> 00:57:09,828
Your are deaf?

943
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:11,433
Oh.. poor girl.. go.

944
00:57:12,118 --> 00:57:13,279
She is so smart.

945
00:57:18,837 --> 00:57:19,894
Dad?
- What is it?

946
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:22,374
This girl is neither deaf nor dumb.

947
00:57:22,556 --> 00:57:24,734
What are you saying.. she is such
a poor and straight girl.

948
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:28,258
Yeah she is poor and straight..
but she is not deaf and dumb. - Why?

949
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:31,014
If she had been deaf and dumb,
then she wouldn't..

950
00:57:31,269 --> 00:57:33,573
..have said yes or no
at your questions.

951
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:35,134
It means this girl is
neither deaf nor dumb.

952
00:57:37,094 --> 00:57:38,494
This Dalal Jutawala..

953
00:57:38,574 --> 00:57:39,894
Oh let her go dad.

954
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:42,013
Our two and half lakh rupees
party is waiting for us.

955
00:57:42,094 --> 00:57:43,254
When that party is coming?

956
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,414
At two thirty.

957
00:57:44,814 --> 00:57:45,894
Oh dad.. your watch is also gone.

958
00:57:46,774 --> 00:57:48,884
Mom.. see this.

959
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:52,303
Very nice.. this also
has music in it.

960
00:57:52,524 --> 00:57:54,911
And see these thousand rupees.
- Thousand rupees?!

961
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,534
It seems you got some
very rich person today.

962
00:57:57,694 --> 00:57:59,574
Not one but two persons.. both
of them were great frauds.

963
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:01,014
They must have taken birth after..

964
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:03,654
..death of hundred thousand frauds.

965
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:05,694
Let them go to hell.. come
and eat your lunch first.

966
00:58:06,454 --> 00:58:08,254
Sit down.. I will bring your food.
- Oh.. the food can wait..

967
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:10,557
First tell me where my
father like father is.

968
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:11,454
Oh what should I tell you..

969
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:13,294
Your father was an alcoholic..

970
00:58:13,474 --> 00:58:16,214
But since he has got money,
he has gone out of control.

971
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:19,014
But he was already out of control.

972
00:58:19,214 --> 00:58:22,236
Oh yes.. but he used
to drink only liquor.

973
00:58:22,316 --> 00:58:25,013
But nowadays he has started going
to brothels to hear the songs.

974
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:27,294
He must have gone there..
to that Chamelibai.

975
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:28,614
God only knows that
when she will die.

976
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:29,774
Chamelibai..

977
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:40,054
Very nice.. very nice.

978
00:58:51,454 --> 00:58:52,814
Well.. very well.

979
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:58,894
Oh why have you stopped
your harmonium?

980
00:58:59,814 --> 00:59:01,053
You?!
- Yes.

981
00:59:02,217 --> 00:59:03,089
How have you come here?

982
00:59:03,169 --> 00:59:04,894
Have some shame.

983
00:59:05,234 --> 00:59:07,871
These duplicate teeth and you
can't even stand on your feet.

984
00:59:07,951 --> 00:59:08,950
What?

985
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:11,032
You can't even listen and you're
coming here to hear songs.

986
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:13,294
Why are you bothering me?

987
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:15,894
Hey you.. get lost from here.

988
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:18,894
Hey you shameless Chamelibai.

989
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:20,453
He is your father's age..

990
00:59:20,534 --> 00:59:22,774
And you are dancing in
front of your father?!

991
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:24,214
Let me be my father or grandfather.

992
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:25,774
This is my business.

993
00:59:26,102 --> 00:59:27,814
These people throw money before me..

994
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:29,494
And I dance in front of them.

995
00:59:29,687 --> 00:59:31,334
Who are you to stop me?
- Me?

996
00:59:38,971 --> 00:59:41,334
Oh.. you can't even fight.
- You bitch.

997
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:43,453
Don't abuse my parents.

998
00:59:45,641 --> 00:59:46,774
What happened?

999
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:49,374
What happened my dear?

1000
00:59:52,774 --> 00:59:54,276
What have you done this my dear?

1001
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:56,634
Tomorrow she has to
dance in a party.

1002
00:59:57,216 --> 00:59:58,589
We have already taken advance..

1003
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:59,894
Now how will she dance?

1004
00:59:59,974 --> 01:00:01,894
I am sorry.

1005
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:04,174
If by tomorrow we do
not get 5000 rupees..

1006
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:06,014
..then how will she get operated?

1007
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:09,054
Is it very necessary for her
to dance in the party?

1008
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:11,574
Can't somebody else go?
- Who else will go?

1009
01:00:12,556 --> 01:00:14,054
I will. - What?

1010
01:00:14,854 --> 01:00:19,558
I will dance and sing
for your treatment.

1011
01:00:21,337 --> 01:00:23,620
They are telling such
big lies.. who are they?

1012
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:25,413
They are very big smugglers.

1013
01:00:25,494 --> 01:00:27,214
They are India's famous smugglers.
Do you know them?

1014
01:00:27,454 --> 01:00:29,174
You didn't call us in today's party?

1015
01:00:29,654 --> 01:00:31,694
Oh this party is for
rich people like us..

1016
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:33,413
Not footpath dwellers like you.

1017
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:36,894
That dancer who is going to
dance today is my lover..

1018
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,814
She will spend today's
night with me.

1019
01:00:40,454 --> 01:00:42,694
You'll know about it
tomorrow morning.

1020
01:00:43,592 --> 01:00:44,734
Is it so?

1021
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:57,694
"You have lightning in your feet.."

1022
01:00:59,094 --> 01:01:02,894
"You have fire on your lips.."

1023
01:01:04,254 --> 01:01:09,014
"You have clouds in your hair ..

1024
01:01:09,395 --> 01:01:13,814
..and wine in your eyes."

1025
01:01:22,982 --> 01:01:28,494
"If you keep cover

1026
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:33,134
on my face now.."

1027
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:38,575
"I will also keep cover

1028
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:43,094
on your faces."

1029
01:02:12,364 --> 01:02:17,134
"If you keep cover on my face now.."

1030
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:21,894
"I will also keep cover
on your faces."

1031
01:02:22,094 --> 01:02:26,695
"If you keep cover on my face now.."

1032
01:02:26,894 --> 01:02:31,573
"I will also keep cover
on your faces."

1033
01:02:31,654 --> 01:02:38,374
"Accept my salutes and don't

1034
01:02:38,785 --> 01:02:46,254
disrespect or disgrace me."

1035
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:51,013
"If you keep cover on my face now.."

1036
01:02:51,254 --> 01:02:56,214
"I will also keep cover
on your faces."

1037
01:03:41,894 --> 01:03:47,013
"Oh your eyes have done

1038
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:52,534
such a magic on me.."

1039
01:03:52,894 --> 01:03:57,513
"I can sing and dance

1040
01:03:57,593 --> 01:04:02,533
for the whole night."

1041
01:04:14,705 --> 01:04:19,094
"Neither I am your enemy..
nor you are my enemy."

1042
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:24,013
"If you make me infamous.. I will
also make your infamous."

1043
01:04:26,094 --> 01:04:30,894
"If you understand my signal now.."

1044
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,734
"I will also understand
your signal someday."

1045
01:04:35,814 --> 01:04:40,252
"If you understand my signal now.."

1046
01:04:40,332 --> 01:04:44,774
"I will also understand
your signal someday."

1047
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:52,014
"We should help each other."

1048
01:04:52,094 --> 01:04:58,814
"That's why I am saying this."

1049
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:03,694
"If you keep cover on my face now.."

1050
01:05:03,894 --> 01:05:08,453
"I will also keep cover
on your faces."

1051
01:05:50,201 --> 01:06:01,209
"Your eyes have cast
such a spell on me."

1052
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:10,964
"I think of you all the time."

1053
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:25,894
"If you keep my word now.. I
will also keep your word.."

1054
01:06:25,974 --> 01:06:30,694
"If you want I will keep
you also with me."

1055
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:37,374
"If you bear this pain now.."

1056
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:42,214
"I will also bear everything
someday."

1057
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:46,734
"If you bear this pain now.."

1058
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:51,334
"I will also bear everything
someday."

1059
01:06:51,414 --> 01:06:58,734
"Don't uncover these things

1060
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:05,214
which should be kept secret."

1061
01:07:05,534 --> 01:07:09,894
"If you keep cover on my face now.."

1062
01:07:10,054 --> 01:07:14,654
"I will also keep cover
on your faces."

1063
01:07:14,814 --> 01:07:22,013
"Accept my salutes and don't

1064
01:07:22,236 --> 01:07:28,214
disrespect or disgrace me."

1065
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:32,694
"If you keep cover on my face now.."

1066
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,469
Oh come on.. take all the girls.

1067
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:44,872
Yes, pick her up.

1068
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:49,431
Leave us.

1069
01:08:10,614 --> 01:08:12,388
This is my ring.

1070
01:08:27,294 --> 01:08:28,374
Police.. police.

1071
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:29,533
Its not police.. they are smugglers.

1072
01:08:34,014 --> 01:08:35,534
Driver.. why are they following us?

1073
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:36,813
Are these your fathers?
- What?!

1074
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:51,719
Hey.. get down.. come on.

1075
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:56,294
Hey Toni Decosta..

1076
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:59,734
We were trying to get this
girl since a long time..

1077
01:08:59,814 --> 01:09:01,014
Where are you taking her?

1078
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:05,573
I have taken this girl.. and
my name is Toni Decosta.

1079
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:06,734
See this.

1080
01:09:13,094 --> 01:09:14,894
We are ready to pay her price.

1081
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:18,694
My job is done.. now I will leave.

1082
01:09:18,774 --> 01:09:20,414
Where are you going dear.. come here.

1083
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:24,054
Leave the girl otherwise
I will shoot you.

1084
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:25,893
You are so nice. - Shut up!

1085
01:09:26,054 --> 01:09:27,814
My name is Toni Decosta..

1086
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:32,894
Go away from here otherwise
I will shoot her.. understood?

1087
01:09:33,694 --> 01:09:35,694
Move away Laxmi.

1088
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:41,013
Run away.

1089
01:11:42,348 --> 01:11:44,252
I'll not spare you.

1090
01:11:44,574 --> 01:11:45,491
Come I will leave you home.

1091
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:47,174
Who are you to come with me?

1092
01:11:47,254 --> 01:11:48,334
Who know you?

1093
01:11:48,414 --> 01:11:50,094
Oh.. you don't know me?!

1094
01:11:50,174 --> 01:11:51,894
You stole my daddy's wristwatch..

1095
01:11:52,014 --> 01:11:53,094
And I saved your life.

1096
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:55,014
Look.. If you talk about
wristwatch and money..

1097
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:57,668
..then I will go to police
and tell them everything.

1098
01:11:57,748 --> 01:11:59,773
Okay.. okay.. I am leaving you
because you're beautiful.

1099
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:03,214
But look.. I saved your
life.. didn't I?

1100
01:12:03,514 --> 01:12:04,037
Yes.

1101
01:12:04,117 --> 01:12:05,774
I also saved your grace..
didn't I? - Yes!

1102
01:12:06,014 --> 01:12:07,494
Then at.. least give
me something in return.

1103
01:12:08,284 --> 01:12:09,773
You are fond of becoming a hero..

1104
01:12:09,854 --> 01:12:11,454
So you sent these thugs behind me.

1105
01:12:11,654 --> 01:12:13,654
I will not give you a single
rupee out of this.

1106
01:12:13,734 --> 01:12:16,814
I will give some money to
that dancer's mother.

1107
01:12:17,254 --> 01:12:22,054
Okay.. don't give me any money..
give me one kiss. What?!

1108
01:12:23,574 --> 01:12:25,820
A kiss.. - ok!

1109
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:27,494
Turn your face here.

1110
01:12:29,614 --> 01:12:32,654
Oh.. you are in your senses
even after drinking?!

1111
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:35,893
That's called eating sweets
by acting like a dumb person.

1112
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:40,214
I keep red chilly powder
for situations like this.

1113
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:45,654
And it's necessary for every young
girl to keep red chilly powder.

1114
01:12:47,054 --> 01:12:49,054
Why.. do you want to cook something?

1115
01:12:49,134 --> 01:12:54,268
No.. not for cooking.. but
for saving my grace.

1116
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:03,199
Remember.. you have thrown red
chilly powder in my eyes..

1117
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,374
I will throw hot spicy
powder in your eyes.

1118
01:13:06,414 --> 01:13:09,614
Sir.. today a person tried
to kill Nathulal.

1119
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:12,014
And he ran away even before
we reached there.

1120
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,094
His name is Akbar Khan.

1121
01:13:15,174 --> 01:13:17,134
What.. Akbar Khan?

1122
01:13:17,774 --> 01:13:18,854
Do you know him sir?

1123
01:13:19,614 --> 01:13:22,093
I know him.. I know also his father.

1124
01:13:23,814 --> 01:13:26,374
Akbar Khan has still not been able
to forget her father's death.

1125
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:30,614
He has come to this city
after many years.

1126
01:13:31,294 --> 01:13:33,214
We have set up traps all around.

1127
01:13:34,134 --> 01:13:36,054
We will arrest him till tonight.

1128
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,614
No inspector.. remove all the traps.

1129
01:13:40,177 --> 01:13:41,454
And let him roam around freely.

1130
01:13:42,805 --> 01:13:44,574
This is my personal matter.

1131
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:49,603
Only I can take revenge
of my father's death.

1132
01:13:52,414 --> 01:13:56,331
And the fire of this revenge
is so dangerous..

1133
01:13:56,411 --> 01:13:59,504
Reeta I will burn in this fire..

1134
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,893
And you also will become
an ash in it.

1135
01:14:05,014 --> 01:14:09,454
I am ready to become an ash
in any kind of fire with you.

1136
01:14:10,374 --> 01:14:13,733
No Reeta.. I am a dead body.

1137
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:15,893
Forget about marrying me.

1138
01:14:16,814 --> 01:14:20,174
Because living persons can
not marry dead persons.

1139
01:14:27,494 --> 01:14:29,654
You might separate
me from your life..

1140
01:14:30,134 --> 01:14:34,134
But I will always regard and
keep you close to my life.

1141
01:14:34,574 --> 01:14:36,893
You can not take that
right away from me.

1142
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,614
We both are similar in one matter.

1143
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:47,894
You are also very obstinate
like me.. good bye.

1144
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:08,253
Hey.. hey.. who is it?

1145
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:14,061
Stop it! Who is it?

1146
01:15:16,165 --> 01:15:17,334
Stop flashing the light.

1147
01:15:22,982 --> 01:15:24,814
You are putting a torch
and beating me!

1148
01:15:25,294 --> 01:15:26,374
Who are you?

1149
01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:30,694
Do you recognize me?

1150
01:15:31,414 --> 01:15:33,254
Commissioner sir.. you!

1151
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:34,734
Who will not recognize you?

1152
01:15:36,014 --> 01:15:38,094
How can I forget you?

1153
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,574
How can I forget a person due
to whom my father was killed?

1154
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:45,374
Neither you have forgotten me..
nor have I forgotten you.

1155
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:49,693
Come with me.. I will save you
from going on the wrong path.

1156
01:15:51,374 --> 01:15:52,454
You are..

1157
01:16:01,174 --> 01:16:05,061
I will take revenge for
my father's death.

1158
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:09,014
And neither can you stop me
from that.. nor your law.

1159
01:16:09,355 --> 01:16:16,773
It will be better for you to
remain imprisoned in a jail.

1160
01:16:18,014 --> 01:16:19,254
You are under arrest.

1161
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:24,654
Try that also commissioner.

1162
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:26,894
I am very strict about my word.

1163
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,414
Only death can stop me.

1164
01:16:34,014 --> 01:16:36,334
Oh no commissioner sir..

1165
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,654
You have a pistol in your hand.

1166
01:16:39,164 --> 01:16:40,893
Otherwise I would have
flown in the air.

1167
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:43,494
Take this.

1168
01:16:49,174 --> 01:16:51,522
If anyone comes in the
way of my revenge..

1169
01:16:53,987 --> 01:16:55,894
I will kill him.

1170
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:29,334
But I have its key.

1171
01:17:29,894 --> 01:17:31,374
Inspector? Yes sir.

1172
01:17:38,374 --> 01:17:40,813
I will come out within
a year or two.

1173
01:17:41,094 --> 01:17:43,014
Till then this ghost of revenge

1174
01:17:43,094 --> 01:17:44,414
will not be there on your head.

1175
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:46,294
Bye.. bye.
- Take him away.

1176
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:49,174
Come on dear.. let's go.

1177
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,134
Give me one Gold Spot.

1178
01:17:56,214 --> 01:17:58,014
Please give me some money dear.

1179
01:17:58,094 --> 01:17:59,454
God will help you.

1180
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:03,214
How will god help me.. I have
not earned anything yet.

1181
01:18:11,334 --> 01:18:13,014
Bye darling.. I will be back soon.

1182
01:18:29,897 --> 01:18:31,693
Oh god.. oh god..

1183
01:18:32,134 --> 01:18:33,214
Are you blind?

1184
01:18:33,515 --> 01:18:36,894
I am blind and searching for light.

1185
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:40,227
But can't you also see dear.

1186
01:18:41,294 --> 01:18:42,773
But since when you became blind?

1187
01:18:43,814 --> 01:18:45,254
Since yesterday.
- Since yesterday?!

1188
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:48,134
How? - What shall I tell you dear..

1189
01:18:48,894 --> 01:18:54,214
Yesterday I met a girl.. I
saved her life and grace.

1190
01:18:54,614 --> 01:18:58,254
But she threw chilly
powder in my eyes.?

1191
01:18:58,725 --> 01:19:00,414
Aren't you that girl?

1192
01:19:02,414 --> 01:19:06,414
Instead of thanking me,
she ruined my eyes.

1193
01:19:06,894 --> 01:19:08,534
I ran to the doctor..

1194
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:12,214
But doctor said no.. your
eyes can not be treated.

1195
01:19:12,558 --> 01:19:15,214
You have lost the
light of your eyes.

1196
01:19:15,388 --> 01:19:18,958
How sad.. oh my god I am very sorry.

1197
01:19:19,038 --> 01:19:20,652
It's all right.
- What happened then?

1198
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:25,134
What then.. I am in search
of a beautiful lady doctor.

1199
01:19:25,746 --> 01:19:29,200
Aunty if you know any
such doctor. - Aunty?!

1200
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,728
Aunty.
- Aunty?

1201
01:19:33,294 --> 01:19:34,614
Oh my god.. come on sit down.

1202
01:19:37,414 --> 01:19:38,534
Not there but sit here.

1203
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:41,294
Oh not upon me.. sit behind me.

1204
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:43,414
Hurry up.. hurry up.

1205
01:19:47,014 --> 01:19:48,734
Here we are gone..

1206
01:19:48,814 --> 01:19:50,374
Hey.. my bike.

1207
01:19:53,814 --> 01:19:55,294
Hey thief.. thief.

1208
01:19:56,814 --> 01:19:58,654
Inspector.. didn't
you get that thief?

1209
01:19:58,734 --> 01:20:00,014
Oh no.. what happened?
- What are you saying!

1210
01:20:00,214 --> 01:20:03,014
He was trying to disgrace me.

1211
01:20:03,454 --> 01:20:05,277
Trying to disgrace an Indian woman!

1212
01:20:05,358 --> 01:20:08,462
I am coming from hospital
with my blind husband.

1213
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:11,014
Is your husband also blind my dear?

1214
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:13,937
Shut up.. I am talking about you.

1215
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:15,494
Yes I can understand something.

1216
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:18,334
Attempt of rape on a
blind husband's wife!

1217
01:20:18,672 --> 01:20:20,454
No.. this can not happen.

1218
01:20:20,534 --> 01:20:21,614
You come to police station with me.

1219
01:20:21,948 --> 01:20:24,894
Okay.. oh no.. you first catch them.

1220
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:27,214
I will go to police station

You are stealing.. you
are trying to rape?

1226
01:20:45,538 --> 01:20:46,712

And sometimes you call
me your daughter.

1236
01:21:04,006 --> 01:21:05,364
I am not a mother,
aunty or daughter.

1237
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,894
Okay.. are you young?

1238

powder in your eyes.

1242

You are looking like
dacoit Phoolan Devi.

01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:09,894
"But you girls say no to fool us."

1259
01:23:10,054 --> 01:23:13,014
"We want.. we want this
disease of love."

1260
01:23:13,313 --> 01:23:16,574
"I want this illness of love."

1261
01:23:36,294 --> 01:23:42,019
"Many a penniless boys like

1262
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,414
"Where ever I pass by."

1263
01:23:46,014 --> 01:23:49,491
"All the boys are dying at my feet."

1264
01:23:52,614 --> 01:23:54,813
"Do not think me penniless."

1265
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:58,574
"I'll build for you."

1266
01:23:58,865 --> 01:24:01,894
"A bungalow of notes."

1267
01:24:02,134 --> 01:24:05,396
"One two three four.. do

"Don't tell lies.. don't tell lies..

1282
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:20,614
"Don't keep doubts my dear.. don't
keep doubts in your heart."

1283
01:26:49,014 --> 01:26:53,454
"Girls have more love than
boys.. I knew it from you."

1284
01:26:53,894 --> 01:26:57,894
"How do you know so much
about girls.. tell me."

1285
01:26:58,214 --> 01:26:59,374
"Tell me.. come on tell me."

1286
01:26:59,454 --> 01:27:00,853
"Shall I tell you.."

1287
01:27:03,331 --> 01:27:07,374
"You feel the pain when I get hurt.."

1288
01:27:07,952 --> 01:27:12,574
"A girl's heart is a pool of love..
I have known it though you."

1289
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:15,022
"Are you telling me the truth?"

1290
01:27:15,175 --> 01:27:16,254
"I swear by my mother."

1291
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:28,894
"Oh.. I'm in love.."

1292
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:36,054
"Oh.. you are in love."

1293
01:27:39,694 --> 01:27:42,774
"Oh.. we are in love."

1294
01:27:48,414 --> 01:27:52,893
"Now I have realized that
you are my love.."

1295
01:27:53,054 --> 01:27:57,402
"You are my world.. you
are my sweetheart."

1296
01:27:57,574 --> 01:28:01,334
"And you are the shining
spot on my forehead."

1297
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:05,894
"Don't go away.. don't
go away my sweetheart.."

1298
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:10,294
"Don't go away from
me my sweetheart."

1299
01:28:10,374 --> 01:28:14,614
"Don't go away.. don't
go away my love.."

1300
01:28:15,072 --> 01:28:19,014
"Don't go away from me my love."

1301
01:28:19,175 --> 01:28:27,838
"Don't tell anyone.. don't tell
anyone that we are in love."

1302
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:34,742
"We want.. we want this
disease of love."

1303
01:28:35,054 --> 01:28:38,174
"We want.. we want this
disease of love."

1304
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,574
"We want.. we want this
disease of love."

1305
01:28:41,869 --> 01:28:44,893
"We want.. we want this
disease of love."

1306
01:28:47,163 --> 01:28:52,026
We will fill this white powder in
the heel of my shoes like this..

1307
01:28:52,656 --> 01:28:54,003
And then we will export them.

1308
01:28:54,448 --> 01:28:57,683
Girls.. fill this white powder
in shoe heels like this..

1309
01:28:58,081 --> 01:28:59,363
And then pack these
shoes in these boxes.

1310
01:29:00,177 --> 01:29:02,683
Jutawala.. take and
drink this liquor.

1311
01:29:07,003 --> 01:29:08,999
Tell us.. whom are you working for?

1312
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,846
For police.

1313
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:14,506
Oh shut up.. tell me where
were you taking that stuff?

1314
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:15,723
To your house.

1315
01:29:18,879 --> 01:29:19,683
Inspector. Yes sir.

1316
01:29:20,508 --> 01:29:22,508
Make him eat that whole..
packet. Yes sir.

1317
01:29:24,708 --> 01:29:26,548
I wont eat it.. I will die sir..

1318
01:29:26,748 --> 01:29:28,628
I will die.. I will die sir.

1319
01:29:31,428 --> 01:29:32,508
Tell me now.

1320
01:29:32,588 --> 01:29:36,508
If I tell you my boss's name, he'll
kill my mother and sister.

1321
01:29:36,908 --> 01:29:42,028
It is our duty to protect
your mother and sister.

1322
01:29:42,597 --> 01:29:44,907
Bring my mother and sister here..

1323
01:29:45,475 --> 01:29:46,948
Then I will tell you
name of my boss.

1324
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:52,827
Okay.. I'll go myself and bring
your mother and sister safely.

1325
01:29:55,828 --> 01:29:57,628
Sir.. your call.

1326
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:58,788
Ok.

1327
01:30:00,198 --> 01:30:01,340
Yes commissioner Khanna here.

1328
01:30:04,228 --> 01:30:07,508
Listen commissioner Khanna..
release our man.

1329
01:30:07,748 --> 01:30:09,907
Otherwise your life
could be in danger.

1330
01:30:11,548 --> 01:30:16,308
I had stopped fearing danger
the day I wore this uniform.

1331
01:30:19,228 --> 01:30:20,428
Give me the keys.
- But sir..

1332
01:30:20,508 --> 01:30:22,308
I don't include others in my risks.

1333
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:23,628
But sir you..

1334
01:30:25,191 --> 01:30:26,108
Thank you.

1335
01:30:34,449 --> 01:30:36,508
Now commissioner will
not remain alive.

1336
01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:38,508
Let's go and call boss.
- Lets go.

1337
01:30:41,548 --> 01:30:44,188
What did you say.. what's there
in commissioner's car?

1338
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:47,228
Bomb. Bomb?!

1339
01:30:47,951 --> 01:30:49,428
You rascal..

1340
01:30:55,828 --> 01:30:57,988
Hey.. wait. Leave me.

1341
01:31:55,091 --> 01:31:58,628
Come here.. where is Shastri Nagar?

1342
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:00,268
Go a little further then turn left.

1343
01:32:00,908 --> 01:32:01,988
Thank you.
- Okay.

1344
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,828
Commissioner sir.

1345
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:18,027
Hey you.. what is this?
- Just move away from here.

1346
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:27,428
Whatever you want to say..
you can say it later.

1347
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:30,148
But what I wanted to
say has happened.

1348
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:33,268
How did you know about this bomb?

1349
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:36,228
These are the persons who
fixed bomb under your car.

1350
01:32:37,148 --> 01:32:39,628
And he is their colleague
who gave them money.

1351
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:42,188
But how did you know?

1352
01:32:42,628 --> 01:32:43,708
They told me sir.

1353
01:32:44,144 --> 01:32:45,828
And you believed them.

1354
01:32:48,548 --> 01:32:50,668
If he is the one who planted
the bomb in my car..

1355
01:32:51,211 --> 01:32:52,828
Then why did he save my life?

1356
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,468
Sorry sir. No.. you can go.

1357
01:32:56,508 --> 01:32:58,907
Well gentleman.. thank you very much.

1358
01:32:59,828 --> 01:33:01,028
Thanks for saving my life.

1359
01:33:01,828 --> 01:33:02,908
Thank you sir.

1360
01:33:04,188 --> 01:33:05,268
You know something..

1361
01:33:05,508 --> 01:33:07,306
Police department needs
strong, brave..

1362
01:33:07,386 --> 01:33:10,028
..and intelligent persons like you.

1363
01:33:10,108 --> 01:33:11,907
No sir.. there is no need for that.

1364
01:33:12,228 --> 01:33:14,578
How will an officer
work if a strict..

1365
01:33:14,658 --> 01:33:18,228
..person like you becomes
my commissioner?

1366
01:33:18,653 --> 01:33:19,491
What do you mean?

1367
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:24,508
Actually sir I have a habit
of doing some wrong things.

1368
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:28,708
Oh yes.. and what's there in
the salary of a policeman?

1369
01:33:28,788 --> 01:33:29,610
They get the salary on
first of the month..

1370
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:31,708
And its finished on very
next day.. why Mr. Sharma?

1371
01:33:32,788 --> 01:33:34,920
And then you will not take bribes..?

1372
01:33:36,296 --> 01:33:37,428
And you also won't let
me take the bribes.

1373
01:33:37,668 --> 01:33:39,548
Then I will die of hunger..
why Mr. Sharma?

1374
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:42,268
I will leave now.. bye sir.

1375
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:53,308
Did you see sir.. that boy
is speaking the truth.

1376
01:33:53,627 --> 01:33:54,588
Shut up.

1377
01:33:58,047 --> 01:34:00,226
What happened to him? Sir
he has committed suicide.

1378
01:34:00,538 --> 01:34:04,147
He said that it's the only way
to save his mother and sister.

1379
01:34:13,337 --> 01:34:16,748
Oh goddess Laxmi.. today I am
taking an oath before you..

1380
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:20,308
That I will live my
life as a housewife.

1381
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:23,588
I am leaving all the illegal
things from today.

1382
01:34:25,428 --> 01:34:27,827
Because.. because..

1383
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:32,548
Because I've found one Om
Narayan like your Narayan.

1384
01:34:33,068 --> 01:34:36,148
Now I'll be daughter in law of a
rich family & live comfortably.

1385
01:34:38,028 --> 01:34:40,828
I don't have a mother and father..

1386
01:34:41,908 --> 01:34:44,108
So you can become my mother..

1387
01:34:50,749 --> 01:34:53,308
Please bless me like a mother.

1388
01:34:54,908 --> 01:34:55,988
Jai goddess Laxmi.

1389
01:35:06,228 --> 01:35:07,308
Mother..

1390
01:35:09,148 --> 01:35:15,228
Your wedding necklace..
it had fallen down.

1391
01:35:19,169 --> 01:35:22,508
Thank you my daughter.. may
god give you a long life.

1392
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:25,827
What daughter.. she is not
a daughter but a thief.

1393
01:35:26,428 --> 01:35:29,384
She will return your necklace and
steal all your ornaments. No mother..

1394
01:35:29,464 --> 01:35:31,428
She had stolen my wristwatch which
I've not found till today.

1395
01:35:31,508 --> 01:35:32,588
We should take her to
a police station..

1396
01:35:32,668 --> 01:35:34,827
Come with me.
- Mother you know that..

1397
01:35:34,908 --> 01:35:37,410
Come with me.
- Listen.. please listen..

1398
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:38,438
Inspector!
- What?

1399
01:35:38,519 --> 01:35:39,477
She has done nothing.

1400
01:35:39,557 --> 01:35:42,315
What is this? - She has stolen
my wife's wedding necklace..

1401
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,148
Mother please tell them..

1402
01:35:43,228 --> 01:35:44,828
She had stolen my wristwatch which
I've not found till today.

1403
01:35:45,428 --> 01:35:46,309
Come to police station with me.

1404
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:48,708
No mother.. you are witness that
I didn't steal it. - Come on.

1405
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,628
You didn't do a right thing.

1406
01:35:50,851 --> 01:35:52,827
What you have to do..
get lost from here.

1407
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:59,907
Oh.. what happened.. what happened?

1408
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:05,027
Mr. Dalal.. your one kidney has
become totally non-functional.

1409
01:36:05,548 --> 01:36:07,027
And second is also going
to be like that.

1410
01:36:07,335 --> 01:36:08,828
If you don't start the
treatment immediately..

1411
01:36:09,228 --> 01:36:10,308
Then we'll have to do an operation.

1412
01:36:11,588 --> 01:36:14,356
Operation.. but that will
cost a lot of money.

1413
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:15,668
I will have to take someone
else's kidney? - Yes..

1414
01:36:16,754 --> 01:36:18,068
Where will I bring
so much money from?

1415
01:36:19,428 --> 01:36:21,668
Doctor.. you have both
the kidneys? Yes.

1416
01:36:21,996 --> 01:36:24,028
Then give me one kidney.. my
problem will be solved.

1417
01:36:24,228 --> 01:36:25,221
Shut up.

1418
01:36:25,301 --> 01:36:26,748
You people are really strange.

1419
01:36:27,245 --> 01:36:29,068
You didn't catch me
when I used to steal..

1420
01:36:29,278 --> 01:36:30,548
And now I haven't stolen
and you have arrested me.

1421
01:36:30,828 --> 01:36:31,948
You speak too much.

1422
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,308
Inspector Sharma.
- Yes sir.

1423
01:36:34,493 --> 01:36:36,028
Had anyone come for
her bail? - No sir.

1424
01:36:37,313 --> 01:36:38,588
Commissioner sir.. commissioner sir..

1425
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:39,947
Why don't you pay my bail?

1426
01:36:41,144 --> 01:36:42,908
I don't have anyone in
this world except you.

1427
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,934
I think when your case is decided..

1428
01:36:46,014 --> 01:36:47,233
I will turn out to be your daughter.

1429
01:36:47,313 --> 01:36:49,908
Oh.. what that case has
to do with this case?!

1430
01:36:50,668 --> 01:36:53,228
Inspector Sharma..
prepare her report. - Yes sir.

1431
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:55,148
Oh no dad.. I mean sir..

1432
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:57,308
You can beat me if you want..
but don't write my report.

1433
01:36:57,548 --> 01:36:58,867
Hey you.. please don't write it.

1434
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:03,308
If you write my report.. I
will come on police record.

1435
01:37:03,548 --> 01:37:06,112
And once that label is
stuck on my forehead..

1436
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:08,007
No-one will marry me.

1437
01:37:09,228 --> 01:37:12,677
Commissioner sahib.. we are ruined.

1438
01:37:12,962 --> 01:37:14,588
What shall we tell you sir..

1439
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:18,908
Both of those butchers have
taken our hard earned money.

1440
01:37:19,228 --> 01:37:21,748
Who?
- Those father and son..

1441
01:37:23,099 --> 01:37:24,428
You keep quiet.

1442
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:26,148
Commissioner sahib.. I will tell you.

1443
01:37:26,394 --> 01:37:27,828
Both of them made a fool of us.

1444
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:29,668
Then even fixed the
marriage with me.

1445
01:37:29,748 --> 01:37:31,748
And they took the
alimony in advance.

1446
01:37:31,908 --> 01:37:33,228
And they cancelled the marriage.

1447
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:37,428
Yes. - Commissioner sahib we
got our money back..

1448
01:37:37,508 --> 01:37:40,587
But they took original notes and
returned these duplicate notes.

1449
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:42,508
But you must have got
some witness for that?

1450
01:37:42,922 --> 01:37:43,907
I am the witness..

1451
01:37:45,908 --> 01:37:46,988
Yes, Commissioner.
I know that agent. - I see.

1452
01:37:47,148 --> 01:37:48,428
I know both of them.

1453
01:37:51,675 --> 01:37:52,988
Inspector Sharma - Yes sir.

1454
01:37:53,228 --> 01:37:54,308
Bring this girl to my office.

1455
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:55,988
Okay.

1456
01:37:58,048 --> 01:37:59,579
Hey you.. open it. - Okay sir.

1457
01:38:01,447 --> 01:38:04,748
Oh.. where is the key.. oh.

1458
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:06,308
Take this.

1459
01:38:08,384 --> 01:38:14,428
Africa's richest princess on world
tour in search of her life partner!

1460
01:38:14,836 --> 01:38:15,788
Very nice.

1461
01:38:16,028 --> 01:38:17,584
This is the ray of hope
in the darkness of our..

1462
01:38:17,664 --> 01:38:19,148
..poverty emanating from
the black sun of Africa.

1463
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:20,748
Look.. what's written further.

1464
01:38:21,508 --> 01:38:25,068
One who can win princess's heart..
Who can dance on music..

1465
01:38:25,148 --> 01:38:26,564
Who is handsome..

1466
01:38:26,748 --> 01:38:28,508
partner Princess needs a life..
like that.. - Which I am.

1467
01:38:28,628 --> 01:38:29,907
I can dance on music..

1468
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,068
I am handsome..

1469
01:38:31,148 --> 01:38:32,228
I can win the hearts of girls..

1470
01:38:32,402 --> 01:38:35,377
I can fool beautiful.. girls.
- Very nice my son Om.

1471
01:39:56,384 --> 01:40:00,428
"There is only one boy
in the whole town."

1472
01:40:06,391 --> 01:40:15,508
"There is only one girl in town..
with clear mind but black body."

1473
01:40:16,228 --> 01:40:20,228
"With clear mind and black body."

1474
01:40:21,638 --> 01:40:30,711
"There is only one girl in town..
with clear mind but dark body."

1475
01:40:31,428 --> 01:40:35,028
"With clear mind and dark body."

1476
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,828
"Say something.. say something."

1477
01:40:39,308 --> 01:40:41,428
"Say something.. say something."

1478
01:41:17,195 --> 01:41:21,268
"Beauty is immortal..

1479
01:41:22,134 --> 01:41:26,308
the colour is irrelevant."

1480
01:41:27,271 --> 01:41:31,428
"My colour is also dark..

1481
01:41:32,218 --> 01:41:36,508
fair colour is out of fashion."

1482
01:41:37,477 --> 01:41:42,148
"Don't look at the colour..
let our hearts meet."

1483
01:41:42,228 --> 01:41:47,228
"Don't look at the colour..
let our hearts meet."

1484
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:49,668
"My heart said."

1485
01:41:50,018 --> 01:41:52,308
"My heart said."

1486
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:56,748
"There is only one boy
in the whole town."

1487
01:41:57,318 --> 01:42:01,508
"There is only one girl in town."

1488
01:42:46,948 --> 01:42:56,228
"Everyone is looking at you..
but don't look at anyone."

1489
01:42:56,908 --> 01:43:06,028
"Sweetheart please save
yourself for me."

1490
01:43:07,028 --> 01:43:11,828
"We both are like each other..
then how come we are alone?"

1491
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:17,148
"We both are like each other..
then how come we are alone?"

1492
01:43:17,325 --> 01:43:19,628
"My heart said."

1493
01:43:19,828 --> 01:43:22,028
"My heart said."

1494
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:26,148
"There is only one girl in town."

1495
01:43:26,908 --> 01:43:31,828
"Heart is white and
the body is dark."

1496
01:43:32,054 --> 01:43:36,228
"Heart is white and
the body is dark."

1497
01:43:37,428 --> 01:43:39,508
"My heart said."

1498
01:43:39,988 --> 01:43:42,228
"My heart said."

1499
01:44:04,988 --> 01:44:07,068
I am a sincere person.

1500
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:11,428
I have brought back these dollars
which I had taken for alimony.

1501
01:44:13,148 --> 01:44:14,805
Police had marked original
notes.. Dalal Jutawala.

1502
01:44:14,885 --> 01:44:16,148
Who.. who Dalal?!

1503
01:44:18,068 --> 01:44:20,107
Taking original notes
in the name of alimony..

1504
01:44:20,868 --> 01:44:27,708
Then returning duplicate notes
instead of original notes.

1505
01:44:28,177 --> 01:44:29,827
I am arresting you on the
charges of.. Don't move.

1506
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:31,939
Inspector Sharma.
- Sir.

1507
01:44:32,019 --> 01:44:36,228
Oh no.. I agree that sometimes
I.. Its not my.. - Daddy?!

1508
01:44:37,941 --> 01:44:39,308
Commissioner sahib.. arrest him..

1509
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:41,228
This idea of changing notes
was his.. not mine.

1510
01:44:41,428 --> 01:44:42,708
No.. he is lying.

1511
01:44:42,993 --> 01:44:46,148
He was telling his son to
make this his business.

1512
01:44:49,938 --> 01:44:51,828
I agree that I am a
very fraud person..

1513
01:44:52,351 --> 01:44:54,067
And I only taught you all
the tricks of cheating.

1514
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:56,628
But you are my son..

1515
01:44:57,068 --> 01:44:59,708
Will you hand me over
to police in this age?

1516
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:03,268
You will let him hang in this age?

1517
01:45:04,068 --> 01:45:08,508
I'll let them hang me.. but what
will happen to your mother?

1518
01:45:09,293 --> 01:45:10,428
She will die crying.

1519
01:45:10,945 --> 01:45:12,308
Will you let your mother cry?

1520
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:13,825
Will you let her die.. tell me?

1521
01:45:13,905 --> 01:45:16,947
No daddy.. I can give my
own life for my mother.

1522
01:45:18,948 --> 01:45:22,588
Commissioner sahib.. the idea
of this business was mine.

1523
01:45:23,096 --> 01:45:25,227
No. Release my daddy on bail.

1524
01:45:25,308 --> 01:45:27,828
And I am ready to bear the
punishment of this offence..

1525
01:45:28,108 --> 01:45:29,548
Inspector Sharma..
- Yes sir.

1526
01:45:30,292 --> 01:45:32,628
Record the statement of Om
Narayan in police station.

1527
01:45:35,028 --> 01:45:36,148
Please forgive me.

1528
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:40,367
I did not want this.

1529
01:45:42,428 --> 01:45:44,867
I.. I deserve this.

1530
01:45:46,232 --> 01:45:51,335
But after I serve the sentence for
my sins when I come out of jail..

1531
01:45:52,209 --> 01:45:56,228
..I will return as a new man.

1532
01:45:57,508 --> 01:46:03,508
Which might be good for you And
also for this world.. maybe.

1533
01:46:16,548 --> 01:46:18,294
Om Narayan is my name.

1534
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:22,505
My father's name is Dalpat Dalal.
He is a biog conman.

1535
01:46:22,586 --> 01:46:24,268
This is amazing!

1536
01:46:32,614 --> 01:46:33,392
Who is it?

1537
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:40,847
Hey you! Oh its you baldy..
you forgot that beating.

1538
01:46:41,417 --> 01:46:42,508
I will have to make
you remember again.

1539
01:47:01,428 --> 01:47:02,508
Thank you Khan brother.

1540
01:47:18,508 --> 01:47:19,588
What a style!

1541
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:26,588
Khan brother.. thank you for
saving my life.. thank you.

1542
01:47:34,581 --> 01:47:37,428
I don't shake my hand
with the person..

1543
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:39,588
..who's going to die with my hands.

1544
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:43,508
Then why did you save me?

1545
01:47:44,108 --> 01:47:45,428
You are not going to die
at any other's hands..

1546
01:47:46,197 --> 01:47:47,428
You will die with my hands.

1547
01:47:47,754 --> 01:47:50,028
But what is your enmity with me?

1548
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:53,428
My enmity is with the person whose..

1549
01:47:53,508 --> 01:47:56,228
..bad blood is flowing
in your veins.

1550
01:47:56,308 --> 01:47:57,908
Khan.. Keep quiet..

1551
01:47:59,428 --> 01:48:01,508
Your rascal father
murdered my father.

1552
01:48:03,494 --> 01:48:07,308
And I have taken oath
on my father's ashes..

1553
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:11,434
These ashes which are still there
in my neck in this locket.

1554
01:48:11,514 --> 01:48:12,748
I swear by this locket..

1555
01:48:14,228 --> 01:48:18,231
Until I destroy your father's
whole family..

1556
01:48:18,311 --> 01:48:22,708
By god.. I will not let
the death come near me..

1557
01:48:24,108 --> 01:48:25,548
And I will not take
coffin on my body.

1558
01:49:48,939 --> 01:49:50,908
Stop it.. I say stop it.

1559
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:52,668
Separate both of them.

1560
01:49:52,748 --> 01:49:53,827
Come on both of you.

1561
01:49:56,748 --> 01:50:00,308
Jailer sahib.. jailer sahib..

1562
01:50:01,028 --> 01:50:05,508
My hand is heavy than
this Khan's shoves.

1563
01:50:05,588 --> 01:50:09,148
Hey you son of a bitch.. whom
are you trying to scare?

1564
01:50:09,513 --> 01:50:10,827
These people interfered today..

1565
01:50:11,028 --> 01:50:13,327
Otherwise this ground would have
become red with your blood.

1566
01:50:13,407 --> 01:50:14,708
Stop this nonsense.
- Shut up.

1567
01:50:14,828 --> 01:50:19,908
Only the time will tell that whose
blood will flow on this ground.

1568
01:50:20,228 --> 01:50:24,148
Om Narayan.. tomorrow's day will
be last day of your life.

1569
01:50:24,668 --> 01:50:26,067
Tomorrow is independence day..

1570
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:30,349
And by god I will free
you from this world.

1571
01:50:30,748 --> 01:50:34,428
Khan.. just let me get a chance
to put my hands on you..

1572
01:50:35,108 --> 01:50:40,988
Leave the decision of
life and death to god.

1573
01:50:50,516 --> 01:50:52,428
Hey where are you going..
come this way.

1574
01:50:52,964 --> 01:50:54,508
Come on.. come this way.

1575
01:50:57,366 --> 01:50:59,173
Come on, have your food quietly.

1576
01:51:27,228 --> 01:51:29,308
What happened, Inspector?
- Akbar Khan shot at him in the jail.

1577
01:51:29,668 --> 01:51:32,228
Oh my God! Take him to
the operation theatre quickly.

1578
01:51:35,148 --> 01:51:37,628
Doctor please save my Om.

1579
01:51:38,023 --> 01:51:40,228
He is my friend.

1580
01:51:40,748 --> 01:51:42,107
And my future husband.

1581
01:51:42,428 --> 01:51:44,907
Please save him. Please save him.

1582
01:51:45,428 --> 01:51:46,867
I'll have to save him.

1583
01:51:47,678 --> 01:51:51,668
Because if anything happens to
Om then my Akbar will be hanged.

1584
01:51:56,428 --> 01:51:59,668
So Akbar Khan shot at Om Narayan?

1585
01:52:00,028 --> 01:52:03,828
That why I'm requesting you to
pardon Om Narayan's sentence.

1586
01:52:04,548 --> 01:52:06,668
Om Narayan has taken his father's
blame on his own head.

1587
01:52:07,068 --> 01:52:09,228
Om Narayan can be released
as soon as he gets well..

1588
01:52:09,668 --> 01:52:11,708
On the conditions that police
withdraws its case.

1589
01:52:16,828 --> 01:52:17,908
Sir this is the report.

1590
01:52:23,548 --> 01:52:25,548
Inspector sahib.. operation
has been successful.

1591
01:52:26,028 --> 01:52:27,828
Mr. Om Narayan is now out of danger.

1592
01:52:28,228 --> 01:52:29,668
He will be regain consciousness
by morning..

1593
01:52:29,748 --> 01:52:30,987
Then you can take his statement.

1594
01:52:31,428 --> 01:52:33,548
What.. Om Narayan is saved?!

1595
01:52:34,089 --> 01:52:35,308
Thank god that he is saved..

1596
01:52:35,908 --> 01:52:37,148
Otherwise you would
have been hanged.

1597
01:52:37,228 --> 01:52:40,148
Jailer sahib.. till when
you are on duty?

1598
01:52:40,508 --> 01:52:42,028
Up to ten o'clock in
the night.. but why?

1599
01:52:42,508 --> 01:52:43,668
Release me for a short while..

1600
01:52:44,282 --> 01:52:47,828
By god.. I will go and shoot Om.

1601
01:52:48,618 --> 01:52:52,921
And I promise that I will return
before your duty is over.

1602
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:54,228
Oh you.. shut up.

1603
01:52:56,628 --> 01:53:03,308
Om Narayan.. I will not leave
you.. I will not leave you.

1604
01:53:04,508 --> 01:53:06,827
Hey.. who are you.. where
are you going.

1605
01:53:12,228 --> 01:53:13,708
Hey.. have you got the card?

1606
01:53:14,428 --> 01:53:19,508
Card.. look.. I don't have post
card.. ration card or bank card.

1607
01:53:19,828 --> 01:53:21,708
I have still not seen
my wedding card..

1608
01:53:22,428 --> 01:53:24,308
For which card she
is talking about?!

1609
01:53:27,628 --> 01:53:28,945
Hey where are you going?

1610
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:32,628
Look.. I am a wife and going
to see my husband.

1611
01:53:32,908 --> 01:53:34,228
I am coming from outside
and going inside.

1612
01:53:34,708 --> 01:53:35,987
Have you got any problem? No.

1613
01:53:36,068 --> 01:53:37,508
No.. then get lost.

1614
01:53:50,428 --> 01:53:52,748
Give me one kiss.. just one..

1615
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:54,910
Really.
- Yes.. Really..

1616
01:54:02,243 --> 01:54:03,757
What happened?
- Mother.

1617
01:54:03,837 --> 01:54:04,864
Again you called me mother..

1618
01:54:04,944 --> 01:54:07,988
Oh no.. my real mother has come..
look there. Oh mom.

1619
01:54:09,428 --> 01:54:10,909
Lie down dear.. lie down.

1620
01:54:10,989 --> 01:54:13,147
Oh no.. I am all right.
I know everything.

1621
01:54:13,709 --> 01:54:16,308
This girl has looked after
you for the whole night.

1622
01:54:16,628 --> 01:54:17,827
Its good that you came here mom.

1623
01:54:17,908 --> 01:54:19,628
Otherwise she would have
again taken care of me.

1624
01:54:20,108 --> 01:54:24,028
My dear.. I like your choice.

1625
01:54:24,428 --> 01:54:25,385
Did you hear?

1626
01:54:25,466 --> 01:54:27,588
Oh yes.. touch the feet.
Not mine.. my mother's.

1627
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:33,188
Have a long life dear.

1628
01:54:33,828 --> 01:54:35,708
Tell her father to meet your father.

1629
01:54:35,908 --> 01:54:37,908
So that we can fix your
marriage at earliest.

1630
01:54:42,828 --> 01:54:44,948
Mom.. she has a father like a father..

1631
01:54:45,028 --> 01:54:48,588
But she does not have a father.

1632
01:54:49,108 --> 01:54:50,508
Then who will talk
about her marriage?

1633
01:54:52,002 --> 01:54:54,308
What's do I need parents to
talk about my marriage?

1634
01:54:55,708 --> 01:54:57,147
I will go and talk to him directly.

1635
01:54:57,385 --> 01:54:58,588
Greetings.

1636
01:55:01,708 --> 01:55:04,067
Your wristwatch.

1637
01:55:09,655 --> 01:55:11,428
You've definitely come here
to ask for something..

1638
01:55:12,045 --> 01:55:14,148
.. very big after returning
this wristwatch.

1639
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:16,308
Yes.. for me it is very big.

1640
01:55:16,828 --> 01:55:18,428
But for you, it's very small.

1641
01:55:19,068 --> 01:55:20,148
Tell me.

1642
01:55:20,428 --> 01:55:25,708
I have come here to ask
for shelter.. for support.

1643
01:55:26,708 --> 01:55:27,947
You have come at a wrong place.

1644
01:55:29,428 --> 01:55:30,628
I have come at the right place.

1645
01:55:32,028 --> 01:55:35,908
I have come to ask for the right
which every woman should get.

1646
01:55:37,108 --> 01:55:42,228
A husband.. a house and a family.

1647
01:55:43,668 --> 01:55:45,628
I have also dreamed about
making my own family.

1648
01:55:47,708 --> 01:55:50,067
My own mother and father
didn't accept me.

1649
01:55:51,428 --> 01:55:53,867
Please be my father and accept me.

1650
01:55:56,228 --> 01:55:57,948
I am also like your daughter.

1651
01:55:58,228 --> 01:56:01,508
Daughter.. a daughter is
a liability on parents.

1652
01:56:02,428 --> 01:56:05,028
She becomes a noose of parents'
neck when she's born.

1653
01:56:05,148 --> 01:56:06,988
So when I got a daughter I..

1654
01:56:12,508 --> 01:56:16,428
Its better to remain without any
child than giving birth to a girl.

1655
01:56:16,908 --> 01:56:19,228
Understood?

1656
01:56:20,228 --> 01:56:23,628
But elders have said that a
girl is wealth of the house.

1657
01:56:24,028 --> 01:56:25,908
Its not the elders but
fools who said this.

1658
01:56:26,428 --> 01:56:27,588
And I am not a fool.

1659
01:56:28,308 --> 01:56:29,948
A son is real light of the house.

1660
01:56:31,428 --> 01:56:32,508
Who brings wealth.

1661
01:56:33,028 --> 01:56:35,548
He brings as wife and dowry along.

1662
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:36,827
What does a girl bring.

1663
01:56:37,148 --> 01:56:39,068
A daughter is the darkness
of parent's lives.

1664
01:56:39,668 --> 01:56:41,588
You care for her the whole life.

1665
01:56:42,369 --> 01:56:45,508
And one day she gets
married and goes away.

1666
01:56:45,828 --> 01:56:48,228
And take wealth as dowry too.

1667
01:56:48,588 --> 01:56:50,508
That's why I hate daughters.

1668
01:56:51,308 --> 01:56:54,828
Sir, if you had a daughter then..

1669
01:56:55,588 --> 01:56:57,027
..you would have had a soft heart.

1670
01:56:57,988 --> 01:57:02,028
Just for once make me your daughter.

1671
01:57:02,988 --> 01:57:05,228
Your heart will melt.

1672
01:57:07,508 --> 01:57:09,907
I did not get a father's love.

1673
01:57:10,428 --> 01:57:12,068
You did not get a daughter's love.

1674
01:57:15,828 --> 01:57:18,588
Please touch my head.

1675
01:57:19,508 --> 01:57:21,548
Give me father's love.

1676
01:57:23,828 --> 01:57:26,828
This unfortunate daughter will..

1677
01:57:27,988 --> 01:57:29,908
..love you her entire life.

1678
01:57:30,828 --> 01:57:33,308
And will give you wealth also.

1679
01:57:34,828 --> 01:57:39,308
So you want to become
my daughter in law?

1680
01:57:41,224 --> 01:57:42,308
Do you know its price?

1681
01:57:43,588 --> 01:57:48,508
Very big and rich families
sent their proposals.

1682
01:57:48,588 --> 01:57:50,508
But everyone had to go empty handed.

1683
01:57:51,628 --> 01:57:53,628
Its price is ten lakh rupees.

1684
01:57:53,988 --> 01:57:54,878
Have you got that much money?

1685
01:57:54,958 --> 01:57:59,147
Daddy.. I have not come
here to buy your son.

1686
01:58:00,428 --> 01:58:02,907
I have come her to be the
wealth of this house.

1687
01:58:03,308 --> 01:58:04,693
So you have come to become the
wealth of this house? - Yes.

1688
01:58:04,988 --> 01:58:08,508
Then do one thing.. go and see
your face in the mirror.

1689
01:58:09,428 --> 01:58:12,228
Then go and check your price in the
market.. Then ask your own heart..

1690
01:58:12,588 --> 01:58:15,628
Are you even worthy of being
a maid of this house?

1691
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:16,788
Get out..

1692
01:58:18,908 --> 01:58:20,868
No daddy.. don't do this.

1693
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:22,827
Let me remain at your feet.

1694
01:58:23,108 --> 01:58:26,028
Get out from here otherwise
I will do something wrong..

1695
01:58:26,108 --> 01:58:30,308
No daddy.. please don't
do this. No please no..

1696
01:58:40,148 --> 01:58:45,988
Daddy.. today you have thrown
this Laxmi out of your house.

1697
01:58:47,108 --> 01:58:48,428
But remember this..

1698
01:58:49,395 --> 01:58:50,948
When goddess Laxmi goes out of home..

1699
01:58:52,548 --> 01:58:58,947
It takes away peace.. prosperity
and happiness of a house.

1700
01:59:00,228 --> 01:59:02,508
I am leaving your home with
shattered hopes and dreams..

1701
01:59:03,588 --> 01:59:05,708
But I am leaving my curse with you..

1702
01:59:07,228 --> 01:59:08,908
Today you have rejected me..

1703
01:59:10,028 --> 01:59:12,828
Tomorrow luck and fortune
will reject you..

1704
01:59:14,335 --> 01:59:15,628
Don't forget it.

1705
01:59:19,016 --> 01:59:22,308
Dalal sir.. the whole factory
has burned and become ashes.

1706
01:59:22,428 --> 01:59:23,508
What?!

1707
01:59:23,588 --> 01:59:25,827
Yes sir.. everything is gone..
nothing could be saved.

1708
01:59:26,281 --> 01:59:42,969
"Oh man what have you done this.."

1709
01:59:44,944 --> 01:59:51,148
"You rejected your daughter

1710
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:58,866
and your destiny with that."

1711
02:00:02,363 --> 02:00:06,803
Oh my god.. I am finished..
I am destroyed.

1712
02:00:10,459 --> 02:00:14,308
My factory has been destroyed..
I am finished.

1713
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:20,837
I am destroyed.

1714
02:00:21,908 --> 02:00:26,872
Dalal Jutawala is finished
within one minute..

1715
02:00:45,725 --> 02:00:48,865
Oh.. what happened.. what happened?

1716
02:00:51,988 --> 02:00:56,268
Thank you for your help.

1717
02:00:57,988 --> 02:00:59,428
But keep this in mind..

1718
02:00:59,508 --> 02:01:02,308
I will not help you in future.
- What are you saying sir..

1719
02:01:02,828 --> 02:01:06,948
A person who helps law can not do
anything illegal with the law.

1720
02:01:07,108 --> 02:01:08,188
It's not like that.

1721
02:01:09,188 --> 02:01:14,881
Protectors of law can also do
illegal things if the need arises.

1722
02:01:16,828 --> 02:01:18,108
Everything will be all right.

1723
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:19,828
God will make everything all right.

1724
02:01:20,548 --> 02:01:23,508
And whatever is mine is yours only.

1725
02:01:25,588 --> 02:01:27,708
I will even give my life for you.

1726
02:01:30,215 --> 02:01:31,508
Your life?
- Yes..

1727
02:01:32,588 --> 02:01:33,539
Do you have any insurance?

1728
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:35,827
Oh yes.. but why?

1729
02:01:36,068 --> 02:01:37,308
I was just asking.

1730
02:01:38,828 --> 02:01:40,428
Is there kerosene at home?

1731
02:01:40,508 --> 02:01:42,428
Yes.. but why? Nothing.. I was
asking just like that.

1732
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:44,628
I am feeling like having some tea..
go and make some tea for me.

1733
02:01:44,708 --> 02:01:46,548
Ramu. Oh no.. not Ramu.

1734
02:01:47,266 --> 02:01:50,235
I want this wife of mine
to make some tea for me..

1735
02:01:50,315 --> 02:01:53,708
.. and give me some hope in
this time of difficulty.

1736
02:01:53,964 --> 02:01:55,178
Go and make some tea for me.

1737
02:01:55,428 --> 02:01:57,028
I will go and bring just now.

1738
02:02:02,028 --> 02:02:04,628
If I pour five litres
of kerosene over her..

1739
02:02:05,828 --> 02:02:08,428
Then light a small stick of
match box and throw at her..

1740
02:02:09,088 --> 02:02:12,268
Then I will get ten lakh rupees
from the insurance company..

1741
02:02:13,228 --> 02:02:15,995
This idea is not less bad.
Should I go ahead?

1742
02:02:18,792 --> 02:02:21,068
Today the gas dealer has
not delivered the gas.

1743
02:02:24,148 --> 02:02:26,988
What is it.. I was just
going to bring the tea.

1744
02:02:34,228 --> 02:02:35,828
What are you doing this?

1745
02:02:35,908 --> 02:02:37,108
I want you to go to ashes.

1746
02:02:37,547 --> 02:02:42,809
I will get a lottery of five
lakh rupees.. Like this..

1747
02:02:45,386 --> 02:02:49,308
Mom.. mom.

1748
02:02:49,802 --> 02:02:51,309
Please save me.

1749
02:02:55,456 --> 02:02:57,308
Mom.. how did all this happen?

1750
02:02:58,118 --> 02:02:59,529
Your father did this.

1751
02:02:59,609 --> 02:03:04,571
He is going to get five lakh
rupees after burning me.

1752
02:03:09,257 --> 02:03:10,018
Why did you do this?

1753
02:03:10,098 --> 02:03:11,668
Who are you to speak anything
in between us?

1754
02:03:11,748 --> 02:03:13,147
She is my wife and
I can do anything.

1755
02:03:13,308 --> 02:03:17,868
For money you'd have
burnt your own mother.

1756
02:03:18,148 --> 02:03:20,508
But I won't leave my mother
here to be burnt alive.

1757
02:03:20,908 --> 02:03:22,228
Come on, mother. Come with me.

1758
02:03:24,988 --> 02:03:29,508
I should call police and let
them arrest you for this.

1759
02:03:29,628 --> 02:03:32,708
No.. don't do like that..
don't do like that.

1760
02:03:34,318 --> 02:03:35,228
Did you hear that?

1761
02:03:36,508 --> 02:03:37,708
You should be ashamed.

1762
02:03:38,746 --> 02:03:40,788
If you have a bit of
shame left in you..

1763
02:03:40,868 --> 02:03:42,148
.. then touch the feet
of this kind woman.

1764
02:03:43,148 --> 02:03:44,508
I am leaving this house
along with my mother.

1765
02:03:45,028 --> 02:03:46,628
From today our relation is finished.

1766
02:03:49,332 --> 02:03:50,588
Today I have forgiven you.

1767
02:03:51,068 --> 02:03:53,828
But I wont forgive you in
future.. remember that.

1768
02:03:53,908 --> 02:03:54,988
Come mother.

1769
02:04:05,548 --> 02:04:08,907
I have to give you ten lakh rupees?

1770
02:04:11,228 --> 02:04:15,028
And Mr. Dhanraj I owe you
fifteen lakh rupees?

1771
02:04:16,628 --> 02:04:18,428
You know my condition is very bad.

1772
02:04:19,729 --> 02:04:23,268
Give me some time and I will..
Your time is finished.

1773
02:04:23,605 --> 02:04:25,827
We have not come here
to give you time.

1774
02:04:25,908 --> 02:04:27,508
We have come here to
vacate this bungalow.

1775
02:04:27,588 --> 02:04:29,508
I have come here to
take my furniture.

1776
02:04:29,588 --> 02:04:31,112
And I have come here
to throw you out.

1777
02:04:31,193 --> 02:04:32,508
Constable.. throw him out.

1778
02:04:32,628 --> 02:04:35,268
Oh no.. just listen to me..

1779
02:04:36,028 --> 02:04:38,951
Please listen to me.. where
will I live man?

1780
02:04:39,031 --> 02:04:40,228
On that footpath.. now hurry up.

1781
02:04:40,308 --> 02:04:41,868
How will I live on footpath..
my forefathers..

1782
02:04:56,382 --> 02:04:58,548
Shine my shoes.. hurry up.

1783
02:05:01,656 --> 02:05:03,988
Didn't you recognize me?

1784
02:05:04,858 --> 02:05:07,268
I am Dalal Jutawala.

1785
02:05:09,588 --> 02:05:13,027
Jutawala's condition has
become like an old shoe.

1786
02:05:13,588 --> 02:05:17,295
Come on hurry up.. polish my shoes.

1787
02:05:17,376 --> 02:05:20,548
Are you feeling ashamed to polish
your future daughter in law?

1788
02:05:21,428 --> 02:05:23,508
My dear.. I mean my daughter in law..

1789
02:05:24,349 --> 02:05:29,308
Did I ever misbehaved
or insulted you?

1790
02:05:29,908 --> 02:05:33,668
Oh no.. you called me at your
home and welcomed me.

1791
02:05:34,228 --> 02:05:35,548
You gave me such respect..

1792
02:05:36,039 --> 02:05:38,951
Once you had mentioned some alimony..

1793
02:05:39,032 --> 02:05:41,468
And I had asked a little
more alimony from you.

1794
02:05:41,748 --> 02:05:43,428
Then my conscience
abused me and said..

1795
02:05:43,508 --> 02:05:45,028
You fool.. you are asking
so much money from her.

1796
02:05:46,308 --> 02:05:48,588
You can give me a
bit less than that.

1797
02:05:48,828 --> 02:05:50,028
Rest you can give me later.

1798
02:05:52,908 --> 02:05:57,148
One rupee for polish..
and one rupee tip.

1799
02:06:04,757 --> 02:06:09,503
Take me to doctor.. my
kidneys.. It's paining.

1800
02:06:10,031 --> 02:06:12,631
Driver please help him.. let's
take him to a hospital.

1801
02:06:12,711 --> 02:06:16,324
I will pay you the fare. Hurry up!

1802
02:06:20,004 --> 02:06:25,068
Uncle.. both of your kidneys
are not working.

1803
02:06:27,428 --> 02:06:30,428
You'll have to immediately
take one kidney..

1804
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:33,148
.. from someone from your
family and implant it.

1805
02:06:34,748 --> 02:06:36,227
Otherwise you wont be able to live.

1806
02:06:38,028 --> 02:06:39,108
Oh my god..

1807
02:06:41,286 --> 02:06:43,628
Uncle.. why don't you take
a kidney from Om?

1808
02:06:43,708 --> 02:06:49,187
Oh no.. he has left the house
after fighting with me.

1809
02:06:50,108 --> 02:06:51,668
Who will give me a kidney
at this time?

1810
02:06:59,228 --> 02:07:00,948
Oh yes.. - Uncle!

1811
02:07:02,028 --> 02:07:04,188
Oh.. you are Banto?

1812
02:07:04,543 --> 02:07:06,455
Oh yes.. but who are you?

1813
02:07:06,536 --> 02:07:07,748
I am Dalal.

1814
02:07:07,828 --> 02:07:08,908
Who Dalal?

1815
02:07:09,302 --> 02:07:11,067
Court had given you a
girl for caretaking?

1816
02:07:11,428 --> 02:07:13,028
Yes it had given to me.
- Where is that girl?

1817
02:07:13,228 --> 02:07:14,428
Please let me meet her just once.

1818
02:07:14,712 --> 02:07:16,148
Oh you have met her..

1819
02:07:16,228 --> 02:07:19,588
Didn't you throw my Laxmi
out of your home?

1820
02:07:20,183 --> 02:07:21,520
Laxmi?!
- Yes.

1821
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,828
She is my..

1822
02:07:24,028 --> 02:07:26,148
Please let me meet her once..
I am touching your feet.

1823
02:07:26,427 --> 02:07:28,316
I am working there
at that shoe shop.

1824
02:07:28,396 --> 02:07:29,668
Please let me meet her just once.

1825
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:34,588
Didn't you go to hospital?

1826
02:07:35,542 --> 02:07:38,548
Yes I had gone there.. They told me
my both kidneys are not working.

1827
02:07:38,828 --> 02:07:40,908
I can live if you give
me one of your kidneys.

1828
02:07:41,982 --> 02:07:43,908
Now you are only my Laxmi.

1829
02:07:45,068 --> 02:07:46,148
Laxmi?!

1830
02:07:48,912 --> 02:07:51,148
You had thrown this Laxmi
out of your house.

1831
02:07:51,828 --> 02:07:53,908
That day I was touching your feet.

1832
02:07:54,508 --> 02:07:55,827
And do you remember
what I had told you?

1833
02:07:56,588 --> 02:07:58,308
That today you are rejecting me..

1834
02:07:58,508 --> 02:08:00,028
Tomorrow your luck will reject you.

1835
02:08:02,148 --> 02:08:05,148
Now the price of your life
is fifteen lakh rupees.

1836
02:08:05,588 --> 02:08:07,308
Five lakh rupees for a kidney..

1837
02:08:08,036 --> 02:08:09,708
And ten lakh rupees for alimony.

1838
02:08:10,748 --> 02:08:13,227
Laxmi asked fifteen
lakh rupees from you!

1839
02:08:14,668 --> 02:08:16,588
Shame.. then Jutawala its
better for you to die.

1840
02:08:16,668 --> 02:08:18,428
And listen.. you are
already half dead.

1841
02:08:18,588 --> 02:08:20,907
Who will spend fifteen
lakh rupees for you?

1842
02:08:21,508 --> 02:08:23,308
You do one thing.. commit suicide.

1843
02:08:23,428 --> 02:08:25,827
And I will spend fifteen twenty
rupees for your last rites.

1844
02:08:25,908 --> 02:08:27,503
Decosta.. have mercy on me.. please.

1845
02:08:27,583 --> 02:08:28,987
Oh shut up.. shut up.

1846
02:08:30,104 --> 02:08:33,158
Throw him out. - Decosta..
- Throw him out.

1847
02:08:33,428 --> 02:08:36,907
Decosta.. Decosta.. Decosta.

1848
02:08:48,565 --> 02:08:51,708
Very well Mr. Decosta..

1849
02:08:53,459 --> 02:08:55,907
Don't forget this blood.

1850
02:08:57,262 --> 02:09:01,273
Now I will not die alone..
I will take you with me.

1851
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:05,428
This Dalal Jutawala who has
made you stand up on your..

1852
02:09:06,118 --> 02:09:08,668
.. feet will one day pull this
ground under your feet.

1853
02:09:10,142 --> 02:09:13,907
I agree that physically I am weak.

1854
02:09:15,228 --> 02:09:17,708
But my brain is still very strong.

1855
02:09:18,428 --> 02:09:20,668
And one day I will beat
you with my intelligence..

1856
02:09:21,538 --> 02:09:24,668
And you will fall in the
feet of this Jutawala.

1857
02:09:25,228 --> 02:09:29,228
And I will kick you and throw
you like this.. like this..

1858
02:09:29,953 --> 02:09:31,028
Remember it.

1859
02:09:44,967 --> 02:09:47,147
Hey.. look ahead.. look ahead..

send them to your home.

very strong and sharp.

1869
02:10:19,428 --> 02:10:22,907
You call me after some time..

1870
02:10:23,228 --> 02:10:24,708
Till then I will arrange
for the money.

1871

Toni.
- Yes dad.

1873
02:10:31,715 --> 02:10:33,428

Dalal's life immediately here.

02:10:33,911 --> 02:10:35,828
Go and bring her here.

02:10:35,908 --> 02:10:39,228
Thanks god that my son has
retuned to the right path.

02:10:39,868 --> 02:10:41,548
Now both of you get
married immediately.

02:10:43,588 --> 02:10:44,867
Who is it?
- Police.

1878
02:10:46,828 --> 02:10:47,908
What is it?

02:10:47,988 --> 02:10:49,068
Is your name Laxmi?

1880
02:10:49,228 --> 02:10:50,908
Oh no.. yes.

1881

I have a warrant for you.
Come to the police station.

1882

Oh.. I have not done anything wrong.

02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:01,119
I have left all the illegal things.

1886

Come and tell all that at
police station.. come on.

1887
02:11:03,535 --> 02:11:04,867
What happened.. Laxmi.

1888
02:11:13,091 --> 02:11:15,828
Commissioner sahib.. they are
taking me without any reason.

1889
02:11:16,072 --> 02:11:17,508
I have not done anything wrong.

1890
02:11:18,428 --> 02:11:22,308
On what charges are you arresting
her inspector.. - Jhon..

1891
02:11:22,744 --> 02:11:24,308
Please save me Commissioner.

1892

You don't also have your name tag.

1893
02:11:26,927 --> 02:11:28,508
Maybe it fell down. Oh yes..

1894
02:11:29,508 --> 02:11:31,628
Haven't you learned to salute
your senior officer?

1895
02:11:31,846 --> 02:11:33,628
Oh salute him. You shut up.

1896
02:11:34,912 --> 02:11:36,828
Where's the arrest warrant
of this girl?

1897
02:11:37,746 --> 02:11:39,068
He might have forgotten
that at home.

1898
02:11:40,108 --> 02:11:42,089
I think you are a duplicate
inspector.

1899
02:11:42,169 --> 02:11:45,148
What did you say? - Okay.. show
me your identity card?

1900
02:11:45,413 --> 02:11:46,907
This is my case not yours.

1901
02:11:47,068 --> 02:11:49,028
And we don't need an identity
card in that.. what..

1902
02:11:49,428 --> 02:11:50,508
Oh I see..

1903
02:11:56,772 --> 02:11:59,397
Commissioner. Commissioner.

1904
02:12:01,557 --> 02:12:03,016
Phone.

1905
02:12:03,519 --> 02:12:08,308
Wait.. I will call police and
made them arrest all of you.

1906
02:12:10,748 --> 02:12:11,827
Hello police?

1907
02:12:12,428 --> 02:12:13,508
Yes police station.

1908
02:12:13,708 --> 02:12:16,357
Some duplicate policemen have
killed police commissioner.

1909
02:12:16,437 --> 02:12:18,268
And they have brought me here.

1910
02:12:18,588 --> 02:12:20,628
Oh.. very smart.

1911
02:12:22,548 --> 02:12:24,548
Toni.
- Yes dad.

1912
02:12:25,228 --> 02:12:28,908
Call Dalal without Jutawala
that her Laxmi is with us.

1913
02:12:29,228 --> 02:12:30,988
They have taken Laxmi
with them.. Who?

1914
02:12:31,656 --> 02:12:35,708
Policemen.. but I think that they
were duplicate policemen.

1915
02:12:35,828 --> 02:12:38,108
Go dear.. I am all right.. go.

1916
02:12:38,819 --> 02:12:41,308
Don't worry mother.. I will
go and bring Laxmi.

1917
02:12:41,548 --> 02:12:43,588
Don't worry mom.. don't worry.

1918
02:12:45,504 --> 02:12:48,628
Welcome.. welcome.. without
Jutawala Dalal.

1919
02:12:49,406 --> 02:12:51,668
Immediately handover
my daughter to me.

1920
02:12:52,548 --> 02:12:55,428
Otherwise I will shoot
this daughter..

1921
02:12:55,508 --> 02:12:57,987
.. of yours who had
given you a new life.

1922
02:12:58,228 --> 02:13:00,308
Kill her.. she is not my daughter.

1923
02:13:00,428 --> 02:13:02,108
Now there is no need
to hide that secret.

1924
02:13:02,507 --> 02:13:05,476
The commissioner whose son
you had stolen is dead.

1925
02:13:05,556 --> 02:13:07,308
I will shoot her with my own hands.

1926
02:13:07,588 --> 02:13:10,548
Now I don't have any
risk from the law.

1927
02:13:11,588 --> 02:13:12,668
Commissioner is dead!

1928
02:13:14,668 --> 02:13:16,628
My dear I am really your father.

1929
02:13:16,908 --> 02:13:18,028
Why are you telling lies?

1930
02:13:18,228 --> 02:13:20,148
You are ready to be a
father for one kidney?

1931
02:13:20,228 --> 02:13:23,214
No dear.. for the first time
in life I am speaking truth.

1932
02:13:23,294 --> 02:13:24,508
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

1933
02:13:25,988 --> 02:13:27,428
I was afraid of commissioner.
Today he is dead..

1934
02:13:27,628 --> 02:13:29,148
And I have automatically
started speaking truth.

1935
02:13:29,228 --> 02:13:29,935
Please say something Decosta.

1936
02:13:30,015 --> 02:13:33,508
Dalal's wife had given birth
to a girl in my hospital.

1937
02:13:33,727 --> 02:13:34,907
And you are that girl.

1938
02:13:35,228 --> 02:13:38,268
And police commissioner's wife
had given birth to a son..

1939
02:13:38,668 --> 02:13:39,748
And Narayan is that son.

1940
02:13:40,588 --> 02:13:45,668
But your father kept you in
Narayan's room and took him.

1941
02:13:47,624 --> 02:13:49,108
Please give me one kidney..

1942
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:51,748
Otherwise I will die of this pain.

1943
02:13:51,948 --> 02:13:56,068
No Laxmi.. it will be better for
a father like this to die. - No.

1944
02:13:56,228 --> 02:13:57,988
Reeta.. don't interfere.

1945
02:13:58,148 --> 02:14:00,508
Till today you kept all
this hidden from me.

1946
02:14:01,242 --> 02:14:03,668
This hospital is a memorial
to my mother.

1947
02:14:04,308 --> 02:14:09,508
But you made it a centre for your
crimes and illegal business.

1948
02:14:09,668 --> 02:14:11,907
No dear.. its not my
but his business.

1949
02:14:12,228 --> 02:14:13,428
You rascal.. you're trying
to be a good..

1950
02:14:13,508 --> 02:14:14,452
..person in your daughter's eyes

1951
02:14:14,533 --> 02:14:16,428
Till today every illegal business..

1952
02:14:16,508 --> 02:14:19,148
..has been done jointly
by both of us.

1953
02:14:19,531 --> 02:14:21,508
Aazam Khan's murder has also been
committed by your father.

1954
02:14:21,588 --> 02:14:22,708
I have only helped him.

1955
02:14:23,428 --> 02:14:25,148
Then he played such a trick
that Aazam Khan's..

1956
02:14:25,229 --> 02:14:28,308
..son became my and my son's enemy.

1957
02:14:28,428 --> 02:14:29,827
And he went scot-free. - Dalal.

1958
02:14:30,148 --> 02:14:32,908
Shut up you rascal.

1959
02:14:32,988 --> 02:14:34,178
You are revealing
everyone's secrets..

1960
02:14:34,258 --> 02:14:36,668
And when its your turn, you're
trying to hide everything.

1961
02:14:37,068 --> 02:14:38,428
If you have guts then
tell you daughter..

1962
02:14:38,925 --> 02:14:40,508
..that you had murdered her mother.

1963
02:14:40,588 --> 02:14:43,708
No.. you killed my mother!

1964
02:14:44,028 --> 02:14:46,028
You troubled her soul.

1965
02:14:46,108 --> 02:14:47,948
I hate you! I hate you!

1966
02:14:49,535 --> 02:14:51,947
I will go to police
and tell them everything.

1967
02:14:55,951 --> 02:14:58,392
Dad.. shall I shoot her?

1968
02:14:58,472 --> 02:14:59,668
No.. give it to me.

1969
02:15:10,585 --> 02:15:12,188
If you move I will shoot you.

1970
02:15:12,462 --> 02:15:14,108
Oh.. this pain will kill me.

1971
02:15:14,473 --> 02:15:15,908
Anesthesia will not
be effective now.

1972
02:15:16,068 --> 02:15:17,588
Now we will have to
do the operation.

1973
02:15:36,038 --> 02:15:42,067
Oh.. please leave me.. leave me.

1974
02:15:47,668 --> 02:15:49,827
You.. you are alive?!

1975
02:15:50,244 --> 02:15:55,228
Law always becomes alive to catch
illegal people like you.

1976
02:15:56,068 --> 02:15:57,148
Arrest all of them.

1977
02:15:57,228 --> 02:15:58,708
But remember one thing..

1978
02:15:59,548 --> 02:16:05,228
If you arrest us.. you will loose
your lost son forever.

1979
02:16:06,708 --> 02:16:08,428
You can get your son for whom..

1980
02:16:08,508 --> 02:16:10,028
..you were fighting the
case for twenty years.

1981
02:16:10,588 --> 02:16:12,067
You can get that son back.

1982
02:16:12,876 --> 02:16:15,268
But illegally.. not legally.

1983
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:18,027
These are five lakh
rupees commissioner.

1984
02:16:19,188 --> 02:16:23,695
If you leave all of our men
and make us cross the border..

1985
02:16:23,775 --> 02:16:28,708
We will give this to you and also
tell you who your son is.

1986
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,107
'They have hidden my son somewhere.'

1987
02:16:40,827 --> 02:16:42,668
I want my son back.

1988
02:16:43,987 --> 02:16:51,539
'Promise me.. that you will bring
my son back.. promise me.'

1989
02:16:57,159 --> 02:16:58,307
I am with you.

1990
02:16:59,028 --> 02:17:00,508
Inspector Sharma..
- Yes sir.

1991
02:17:00,764 --> 02:17:03,307
Leave all these men.. and take
all the constables with you.

1992
02:17:03,827 --> 02:17:06,227
Sir.. I can arrest
you for this crime.

1993
02:17:06,308 --> 02:17:09,988
But not until you have arrest
warrant against me.

1994
02:17:10,907 --> 02:17:16,307
Go to I.G.P.. make my arrest
warrant.. then we'll talk.

1995
02:17:17,459 --> 02:17:18,931
Get out.

1996
02:17:19,147 --> 02:17:26,107
Wait.. there is a Mustafa Jamaal
in crime branch.. right..

1997
02:17:28,227 --> 02:17:33,547
Tell Mustafa Jamaal to immediately
call me here.. out.

1998
02:17:34,028 --> 02:17:35,382
Come on everyone.

1999
02:17:38,428 --> 02:17:40,307
I am hearing this Mustafa Jamaal's
name for the first time.

2000
02:17:40,428 --> 02:17:45,307
I thought you are smart.. but
you turned out to be a fool.

2001
02:17:46,428 --> 02:17:50,827
Mustafa Jamaal.. king
of the underworld.

2002
02:17:51,415 --> 02:17:52,828
He is my best friend.

2003
02:17:53,147 --> 02:17:55,463
He has got many aeroplanes
and helicopters.

2004
02:17:55,543 --> 02:18:00,108
And I would like to cross the
border in his helicopter.

2005
02:18:04,208 --> 02:18:05,588
Tell me now where is my son?

2006
02:18:25,588 --> 02:18:28,268
I have run away from jail and
I will kill you at any cost.

2007
02:18:28,428 --> 02:18:31,708
Your dead body will go from here.

2008
02:18:32,227 --> 02:18:33,907
And I will take that
on my own shoulders.

2009
02:19:04,587 --> 02:19:08,067
Akbar Khan I wont get another
chance like this to take revenge..

2010
02:19:09,629 --> 02:19:11,668
Reeta.. Reeta.. what
have you done this.

2011
02:19:12,327 --> 02:19:13,668
Akbar Khan is not your enemy.

2012
02:19:15,946 --> 02:19:19,028
And your commissioner's son.

2013
02:19:19,332 --> 02:19:22,428
What?! - Reeta..

2014
02:19:22,778 --> 02:19:24,268
Reeta.. what are you saying all this?

2015
02:19:26,548 --> 02:19:28,028
I have heard everything.

2016
02:19:29,108 --> 02:19:31,428
Dalal had picked you
from the hospital.

2017
02:19:33,082 --> 02:19:38,588
You are commissioner's son.. and
Laxmi is Dalal's daughter.

2018
02:19:39,227 --> 02:19:42,307
Reeta.. who has done all this to you?

2019
02:19:42,907 --> 02:19:49,228
My dad.. he also killed your father.

2020
02:19:50,988 --> 02:19:54,508
Take revenge of your father
from him.. don't let him go.

2021
02:19:56,228 --> 02:19:58,308
Please forgive me Om.. forgive me.

2022
02:19:58,928 --> 02:20:02,668
No Khan.. this is a time
to fight them jointly.

2023
02:20:04,148 --> 02:20:06,867
Save Laxmi's life.. she is in danger.

2024
02:20:07,188 --> 02:20:09,268
Khan.. please take care of her.

2025
02:20:10,988 --> 02:20:12,068
Reeta..

2026
02:20:12,748 --> 02:20:14,908
No.. I have to go.

2027
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:19,588
Don't leave me Reeta..
don't leave me.

2028
02:20:27,754 --> 02:20:28,908
Reeta.

2029
02:21:16,828 --> 02:21:19,308
Commissioner sahib.. please
arrest them. - Why?

2030
02:21:19,998 --> 02:21:23,308
I am ready to give kidney
to my father..

2031
02:21:23,508 --> 02:21:25,508
But they want to kill me.

2032
02:21:26,428 --> 02:21:27,346
Your father?!

2033
02:21:27,426 --> 02:21:31,428
Yes.. he had exchanged
me in the hospital.

2034
02:21:31,988 --> 02:21:34,308
I am his daughter and
Narayan is your son.

2035
02:21:35,828 --> 02:21:37,988
Tell him.. tell him that whatever
you said is wrong.

2036
02:21:38,148 --> 02:21:39,428
Tell him..

2037
02:21:44,308 --> 02:21:47,628
Daddy.. arrest all of them.

2038
02:21:49,428 --> 02:21:50,828
Give this pistol to me.

2039
02:21:54,148 --> 02:21:56,908
Now these are not our enemies
but our friends.

2040
02:21:57,226 --> 02:22:00,308
Mr. Kapil Khanna.. Dalal and me..

2041
02:22:00,575 --> 02:22:02,148
We have become partners
in this illegal business.

2042
02:22:02,807 --> 02:22:05,308
Now you also come with us. No..

2043
02:22:05,428 --> 02:22:06,508
Oh yes my son..

2044
02:22:07,508 --> 02:22:09,428
This was the only way
to fulfil the promise..

2045
02:22:09,508 --> 02:22:10,588
..which I had given to your mother.

2046
02:22:10,668 --> 02:22:13,308
Now I am not a police commissioner
but only a father

2047
02:22:13,428 --> 02:22:17,828
Don't touch me.. it will be a
crime to call you a father.

2048
02:22:19,428 --> 02:22:21,828
A commissioner who has been
caught in the net of crimes..

2049
02:22:22,908 --> 02:22:24,428
It will be crime to
call him a father.

2050
02:22:25,095 --> 02:22:27,908
You are bound with the
chains of corruption..

2051
02:22:28,428 --> 02:22:32,148
But I will not let my future
be destroyed by your crimes.

2052
02:22:33,028 --> 02:22:35,588
I am taking Laxmi with
me.. I am going.

2053
02:22:37,748 --> 02:22:38,828
Wait Narayan..

2054
02:22:39,668 --> 02:22:42,931
This father who has given
birth to you can..

2055
02:22:43,595 --> 02:22:46,028
..also shoot you for not
obeying his orders.

2056
02:22:46,355 --> 02:22:47,508
No.

2057
02:22:48,588 --> 02:22:52,108
No Laxmi.. come on shoot me.

2058
02:22:53,668 --> 02:22:55,892
My father commissioner
Kapil Khanna's..

2059
02:22:55,972 --> 02:22:57,668
..true blood is flowing in my veins.

2060
02:22:58,988 --> 02:23:02,108
Neither he was afraid of death..
nor am I afraid of death.

2061
02:23:02,854 --> 02:23:04,588
Come on shoot me.
- No.. no..

2062
02:23:16,428 --> 02:23:17,948
Hello commissioner Kapil Khanna..

2063
02:23:18,508 --> 02:23:19,828
Man you have done wonders..

2064
02:23:20,457 --> 02:23:22,428
You have made a criminal
out of Mustafa..

2065
02:23:22,508 --> 02:23:24,508
..Jamaal.. an inspector
General of police!

2066
02:23:25,428 --> 02:23:28,588
Your inspector Sharma seems
to be very serious.

2067
02:23:30,028 --> 02:23:31,148
How many people are coming to jail?

2068
02:23:31,767 --> 02:23:32,908
Ten to twelve people sir..

2069
02:23:33,399 --> 02:23:35,068
You arrange for a helicopter..

2070
02:23:35,628 --> 02:23:38,108
I want to cross the border with
my gang today night only.

2071
02:23:38,548 --> 02:23:40,028
They want to go to
a foreign country?

2072
02:23:40,588 --> 02:23:44,428
I will beat all the bastards with
sticks and put them in jail forever.

2073
02:23:44,588 --> 02:23:46,588
Call me as soon as you have
made the arrangements.

2074
02:23:47,508 --> 02:23:49,908
Dad.. I am with you.

2075
02:23:52,508 --> 02:23:54,308
You traitor.. son of a bitch.

2076
02:24:03,806 --> 02:24:07,028
No.. don't kill them like that.

2077
02:24:07,588 --> 02:24:10,428
Kill all of them slowly..

2078
02:24:10,748 --> 02:24:12,239
Kill them in such
a way that no coffin..

2079
02:24:12,319 --> 02:24:13,948
..in world can cover their bodies.

2080
02:24:14,028 --> 02:24:16,188
You bastard.. I have brought
a coffin for you.

2081
02:24:20,219 --> 02:24:22,588
This one is on behalf
of my deceased father.

2082
02:24:26,908 --> 02:24:28,828
And this is from my Reeta.

2083
02:24:34,308 --> 02:24:36,108
I have buried Reeta
with these hands..

2084
02:24:37,188 --> 02:24:39,308
And I will bury all of
you with these hands.

2085
02:26:34,157 --> 02:26:35,764
Idiot!

2086
02:27:37,748 --> 02:27:38,828
Khan..

2087
02:27:41,228 --> 02:27:42,308
What happened Om?

2088
02:27:43,355 --> 02:27:46,704
My friend.. I would have
died if a man..

2089
02:27:47,146 --> 02:27:48,628
..like you would have shot at me.

2090
02:27:49,028 --> 02:27:53,068
But I won't die even if a bastard
like this shoots me fifty times.

2091
02:28:00,148 --> 02:28:06,148
Take this Khan.. take your
revenge.. Decosta..

2092
02:28:37,948 --> 02:28:39,308
Decosta..

2093
02:28:47,828 --> 02:28:48,908
Khan.

2094
02:28:52,731 --> 02:28:53,994
Thanks a lot my friend..

2095
02:28:54,668 --> 02:28:58,148
You helped me in taking my revenge.

2096
02:28:58,508 --> 02:29:01,317
No Khan.. you have just
become my friend..

2097
02:29:02,148 --> 02:29:03,308
You can't leave me alone like this.

2098
02:29:03,428 --> 02:29:11,793
No.. see this.. my Reeta
is waiting for me.

2099
02:29:25,228 --> 02:29:26,308
Khan.

2100
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:31,079
Khan.

2101
02:29:50,876 --> 02:29:53,828
"I don't want.. I don't want..
I don't want this disease of love."

2102
02:29:54,041 --> 02:29:57,148
"I want.. I want..
I want this disease of love."

2103
02:29:57,352 --> 02:29:59,867
"I don't want.. I don't want..
I don't want this disease of love."
