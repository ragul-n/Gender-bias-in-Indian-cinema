3
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,730
This chance won't come again.

4
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,790
Sell everything in your house
and bet it on horse number 9.

5
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,250
The bookie has said
horse number 9 will win.

6
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,470
Yes, if this house was mine,
I would sell it too.

7
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,510
But you don't worry,
I'll be right back.

8
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,340
I've found it. After so many days,
I've at last found it.

9
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,646
Why are you troubling me?
What did you find?

10
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,700
- A horse.
- Horse?

11
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,180
Are you crazy? We barely make ends
meet and you want to bring a horse.

12
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,510
No,
I mean I've got two job offers.

13
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,830
It was a slip of my tongue. Don't
worry, our good times are ahead.

14
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,776
I was struggling to get one job
and now I've got two job offers.

15
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,996
Thank God.

16
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,340
Kashinath, come soon.

17
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,970
I'm coming. Give me food.

18
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,290
- Where did she go?
- Gauri.

19
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,060
You're still making the bread?
Nothing is ready on time here.

20
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm losing the horse,
I mean the job.

21
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,010
If I'm even a minute late,
I swear, everything will be ruined.

22
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,290
She's useless.
I'm screaming to serve the food...

23
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,210
but she's working so slowly.

24
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,220
- Listen...
- I'm coming.

25
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,970
- What is it?
- Do you have some money?

26
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,836
- For what? - For the taxi.
- You're going to roam or to work?

27
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,950
You don't know. If I go in a taxi,
the boss will be impressed.

28
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,070
These are the days of appearances.

29
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,440
If you wear slippers and go, you
won't get a salary of even 30 rupees.

30
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,320
But if you sit in a taxi and go,
you'll get paid 100 rupees.

31
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,800
- But I don't even have a penny.
- Gauri, did you get your salary?

32
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,820
No uncle,
I may get it this evening.

33
00:04:53,290 --> 00:05:00,620
But I need the money now. The need
formoney arises in bad times.

34
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,130
Come on Kashinath, we'll what happens.

35
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,490
Uncle... your food.

36
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh no. I told you so many times
not to call me when I'm going out.

37
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,940
I'm going for a good work.
Please bless me God.

38
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,280
You've become so big
but don't have any sense.

39
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,920
He was searching
for a job for so long.

40
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,280
Today he got a job and
he had to go without eating food.

41
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,620
You called him from behind.
When will you understand?

42
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,830
I'm sick and
you can't even make food on time.

43
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,050
Why have we brought you up?
To trouble us?

44
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,230
I didn't know that uncle would
leave so early in the morning.

45
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,910
Do you ever know anything?
The whole day you roam like a queen.

46
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,680
Do you do anything else? Since you
came here, we're facing problems.

47
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,780
You won't be at peace
until we're ruined.

48
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,120
Curse the day we brought you here.
We should have let you die there.

49
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,800
Why are you standing?
Won't you go to work?

50
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,910
You want to lose that job?
Go to work.

51
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,070
Leave all this and go to work.

52
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,270
Hurry up.

53
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,240
- Gauri sister.
- Sister has come.

54
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,160
- Please tell us a story.
- Not now, I'm going to work.

55
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,720
You go everyday to work.
Please don't go today.

56
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,750
If I don't go to work,
I'll lose my job.

57
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,680
So what? Let it be.

58
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,060
Let it be? There's no salary
without a job and then no food.

59
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,420
- Then no story?
- Not now, when I return I'll tell you a story. Okay?

60
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,960
- Okay.
- Now go.

61
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,450
Eight rupees and 2 annas.

62
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,360
Is this the time to come?

63
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,900
I come everyday at this time.

64
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,060
What? Am I lying?
You're arguing with me.

65
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,160
I've kept you to work or to argue
with me? I don't need such a girl.

66
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,150
No madam. Please forgive me.
I won't do this again.

67
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,700
Fine. But if you do this again
I'll throw you out. Understood?

68
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,870
Your beautiful eyes...

69
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,540
Don't worry.

70
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,210
If you worry like that,
your beauty will be marred.

71
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,250
Our madam is a little mad.

72
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,600
You also don't bother.
Just ignore what she says.

73
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,750
Oh my. Someone screamed at you
and you're angry at someone else.

74
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,510
The Banaras sweets are very nice.
They're great.

75
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,530
Have it.
I swear, you'll become healthy.

76
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,670
I swear, you look even more
beautiful when you're angry.

77
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,290
- Really?
- I swear on you.

78
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,730
Will you stop this nonsense?
Else I'll go and tell madam.

79
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,750
Why bring madam into it?
The matter is ours.

80
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,830
You don't know,
I care for you so much.

81
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,920
What did you do?
What did you break?

82
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,920
You broke the best teapot I had.
You've spoiled the whole set.

83
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,080
Your hands can only break.
I'll give you to the police.

84
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,300
No madam, please don't do that.
I'll give you the money.

85
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,000
You'll give the money for this?
Do you know its price?

86
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,246
Whatever you say,
please cut it from my salary.

87
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,900
Your pay isn't 100 rupees. To pay
this you'll have to work for months.

88
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,700
I'll work madam, but please don't
call the police. Please forgive me.

89
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,760
Ever since you came here,
we've had problems.

90
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,960
You won't be at peace
until we're ruined.

91
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,230
Curse the day we brought you here.
We should have let you die there.

92
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,290
Sister...

93
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,490
Give me some food.

94
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,830
- See, all pans are empty.
- You ate everything, didn't keep for me?

95
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,450
The pans are empty,
my stomach is empty and so is yours.

96
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,180
Today I'll tell you a nice story.
Come on.

97
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:39,080
Yes sister, tell us a story.

98
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,730
Okay, sit down.

99
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,450
Tell now.

100
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,100
Please tell the story.

101
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,620
Today I won't tell you the story
of a king or a queen or a fairy.

102
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,440
Today the story will be of...

103
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,890
Hey, what happened to your doll?

104
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,720
- Sister, the doll broke.
- It broke?

105
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,420
Okay, today I'll tell you the story
of a small doll.

106
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,500
Yes sister, please.

107
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,520
Listen to a long story
of a small doll

108
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,486
The way the night
hears the stars speaking

109
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,320
Listen to the story
of a small doll

110
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:18,680
In her fate there was a bed
of thorns and toys of tears

111
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,230
Pain was her friend
and her eyes had sorrow

112
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,420
She didn't have a home
or any other place

113
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,930
She didn't have a home

114
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,480
She had pain in her heart
and hid tears in her eyes

115
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,780
Listen to a long story
of a small doll

116
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:18,310
She wished for a small bungalow
on the beautiful earth...

117
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,230
where there would be games
and nice meetings

118
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,280
There would be nice meetings

119
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:53,080
The childhood went
and the tearful youth came

120
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,450
Listen to a long story
of a small doll

121
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:26,160
A marriage procession with the
queen and the king on the horse

122
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,290
There are paths of love
and flowers fall there

123
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,730
And flowers fall there

124
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,106
She wanted to become
the queen of stars one day

125
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,460
Listen to a long story
of a small doll

126
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,210
What happened after that?

127
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,350
After that?

128
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,930
In a moment her dreams broke.
The light also diminished

129
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:52,060
Only darkness and
sad mornings were left

130
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,620
This is the whole story,
but yet incomplete

131
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,900
It's still incomplete

132
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,970
Even she didn't know
what would become of her

133
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,510
Listen to a long story
of a small doll

134
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,996
The way the night
hears the stars speaking

135
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,520
Listen to a long story
of a small doll

136
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,390
Did you get your salary?

137
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,730
Why are you quiet? Say something.
Where is the salary?

138
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,040
I broke a teapot.

139
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm asking about the salary and
you're talking about the teapot.

140
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,730
- My salary was cut for that.
- You go to wash dishes or break them?

141
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,660
This girl has made our life hell.

142
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,680
She goes out and causes loss for us
and stays at home and devours our food.

143
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,720
Oh God.
Why did we get her?

144
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,670
In this mess I don't think my work
will be done. I'll come later.

145
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,190
Tonight I'll put you out in the
cold. Then you'll learn. Come on.

146
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,200
What are you looking at?

147
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,490
- I'm fed up with her.
- What?

148
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,890
We've done a lot for her.
We can't keep her forever.

149
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,650
She's not a child.
She can take care of herself.

150
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,080
We've brought her up.
Now let her go where she wants.

151
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,540
- You tell her.
- Okay. Give the vegetable.

152
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,990
Sister...

153
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,430
I've brought food for you.
Two breads and a little sauce.

154
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,580
Please eat, sister.

155
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,880
Baby, greet Gauri.

156
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,830
You won't greet her?

157
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,030
I'm feeling very bad that
your salary was cut yesterday.

158
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,090
Are you feeling okay?

159
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,690
Oh my.

160
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,890
This girl is like a thermometer.
You look at her and her temperature rises.

161
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,990
Don't worry about me,
but take care of yourself.

162
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,590
These fair hands aren't meant
to wash dishes but to apply henna.

163
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,180
If you behave like that, your life
will be spent washing dishes.

164
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,460
Just get married. I'll take you
on the Frontier Mail to Delhi and Agra.

165
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,440
I'll show you around.

166
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,680
Are you going? Else I'll go
and tell the madam right now...

167
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,810
that you bother me
and steal things.

168
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,190
Where are you going?
I'll go myself.

169
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,420
But one day you'll think of me
and regret. I'm telling you.

170
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,420
Come my dear child.

171
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,480
Where did your chain go?

172
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,390
Banke!

173
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,680
- Banke, where are you?
- I'm here.

174
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,360
Are you both deaf? Didn't you hear
my call? Who took Shobha's chain?

175
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,960
- What?
- Tell or else I'll hand you both to the police.

176
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,796
- Why are you screaming?
- What to do? See, Shobha's chain is gone.

177
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,850
- What?
- She didn't go out of the house.

178
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,550
Yes sir,
she was here, playing with us.

179
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,946
Madam, when I came here
baby was playing with him.

180
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,590
Wasn't she playing with you?

181
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:44,170
Liar. He's a thief.
I'm sure he's robbed it. Search him.

182
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,380
Madam, she's calling me a thief.
She's wrongly accusing me.

183
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,390
Silence! If neither of you
took the chain, where did it go?

184
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,980
I'll call the police right away,
and then we'll know the truth.

185
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,190
The servant doesn't have it.

186
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,180
Sir, you searched me.
Now you must search Gauri, too.

187
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,160
- Yes, why not?
- Please search her.

188
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,770
See, I don't have...

189
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,060
- What's this?
- Show me.

190
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,940
- This is Shobha's chain.
- How did it get here?

191
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,640
Shameless. How did this chain come
here if you didn't go near Shobha?

192
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,730
No, I didn't rob the chain.
I've never robbed.

193
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,410
Then how did it come in your veil?

194
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,570
I don't know inspector.
Please believe me.

195
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,060
I swear I've never robbed.
I didn't steal this chain.

196
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,240
- Come with me.
- But I didn't take the chain.

197
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:07,000
Believe me. I've never robbed. Madam
please tell him, I've never robbed.

198
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,680
The circumstances don't prove
that the accused robbed the chain.

199
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,220
Also, she's a minor and
hasn't committed any crime before now.

200
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,510
So on the assurance
of one year's good behavior...

201
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,580
promised by her uncle
Mr. Kashinath, she's released.

202
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,470
Auntie...

203
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,090
I've returned. They released me.

204
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,580
- I'll do it.
- Move away!

205
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,470
I won't let you work
with the hands which rob.

206
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,330
Why have you come here?
Get out.

207
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:09,070
- Auntie...
- We're poor, penniless, your uncle doesn't earn...

208
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,670
and I'm sick, but we
never touched anyone's things.

209
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,376
Auntie.

210
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,210
I won't let the world raise a finger
against us by keeping you here.

211
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,620
Get out of my house and don't ever
show me your dirty face again.

212
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,340
Get out.

213
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,870
Get out of here.

214
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,590
Uncle...

215
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,800
Where should I go?
Where can I go?

216
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,880
I don't have anyone in this world
except you both.

217
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,880
So what can I do? I saved you from
being jailed. What else do you want?

218
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,630
Uncle!

219
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,780
In this house only your aunt
has a say. I can't keep you here.

220
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,950
No uncle, don't throw me out.
Please have mercy on me.

221
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,380
Don't throw me out.

222
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:16,330
Why should we throw you out? We'll
keep you here and pray before you.

223
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,920
Get out.

224
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,040
We've taken a lot of misery for you.
You've defamed us in the village.

225
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,910
Aren't you satisfied? What are you
doing here? Get out or I'll hit you.

226
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,870
Go.

227
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:06,340
In a moment her dreams broke,
the light also went out

228
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:12,020
Only darkness and
sad mornings were left

229
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,490
This is the whole story,
but yet incomplete

230
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,870
It's still incomplete

231
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,980
Even she didn't know
what would be her end

232
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,550
Listen to the long story
of a small doll, like the night

233
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,020
Listen, you wanted a maid.
Here she is.

234
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,890
What can you do?

235
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:56,020
All the housework. Washing dishes
and clothes, looking after the child.

236
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,840
- What will you charge?
- Just give me food, clothes and place to stay.

237
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,570
Where do you live?

238
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,670
I don't have a house.
I don't have anyone in this world.

239
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,650
- Where were you working before?
- Before? At a rich man's place.

240
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,780
- Why did you leave there?
- What?

241
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,780
They accused me of robbing. It was
the mischief of their servant...

242
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,580
but the police caught me.
I explained to them I didn't rob.

243
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,640
But they didn't believe me
and convicted me.

244
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,480
We don't need a maid.
Please go.

245
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,700
The laundry washes my clothes, food
is from the hotel and I've no wife.

246
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,590
Can you do anything else
apart from housework?

247
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,940
Take this.

248
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,790
What's your name?

249
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,440
Take this.

250
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,710
Sir, this girl committed a theft
and was just released by the police.

251
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,350
Really? We don't give work
to thieves. Go from here.

252
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:41,880
This world
is a carnival of sorrow

253
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:00,410
It's the tale of problems

254
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:09,240
Some cry, some sing

255
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:16,450
This life is strange

256
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,100
Please support us...

257
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:37,860
Please support us
as we're in need

258
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:49,070
We're stars fallen from the sky

259
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,370
Please support us

260
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,080
If the stomach is full...

261
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,680
If the stomach is full,
the world looks bright

262
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:43,050
When hunger torments,
the conscience falters

263
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,210
Please do good

264
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:13,840
Please do good.
This life is very short

265
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:19,420
Please support us
as we're in need

266
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,940
We're stars fallen from the sky

267
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,510
Please support us

268
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,910
From your world...

269
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:01,320
God, please tell us
where should we go from your world?

270
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:12,530
We're your children
but we still suffer

271
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,490
We may be poor...

272
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,740
We may be poor,
but we're your children

273
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,070
Please support us
as we're in need

274
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,610
We're stars fallen from the sky

275
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,030
Please support us

276
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,590
What's all this?

277
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,066
Old man, you want to pick pockets
by gathering a crowd? Go away.

278
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,540
- Okay, sir.
- Go away, else you'll be dealt with.

279
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,470
We won't sing, sir.

280
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,530
Listen, take this.
It was lying here.

281
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,380
May God bless you.

282
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,710
My God is dead.

283
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,679
- Please give me this.
- Take, sister.

284
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:38,020
- All of you are here.
- We've been waiting for so long.

285
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:42,159
Many people wait for me
and have gone crazy. Come.

286
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,330
Banke.

287
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,500
Gauri, you?
When did you come back?

288
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:53,410
I'll tell you.
Ask your friends to go.

289
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,469
Yes, if you sinsist,
I'll expel them from the city.

290
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,200
Brothers please leave.
Come, please come.

291
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Please come.

292
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,170
Come.

293
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,420
All morning I've had an odd feeling.
It was because you were coming.

294
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,000
The truth is, I was praying for you.
Thank God you weren't jailed.

295
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,580
I was saved from being convicted,
but the crime I'm accused of...

296
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,320
is haunting me.

297
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,570
People think I'm a thief
and call me a robber.

298
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,770
People are fools.
What do they know?

299
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,570
Uncle and auntie
have thrown me out of the house.

300
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,270
I have no home now.

301
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,210
What are you saying?

302
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:56,760
And there's more.
I've been looking for a job...

303
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,980
but all doors are closed to me.

304
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,280
Do you know,
I haven't eaten for two days?

305
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,400
For two days
I haven't eaten a piece of bread.

306
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,140
Are you happy?

307
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,170
You haven't eaten in two days
and you think I'd be happy?

308
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,710
Okay. But do you know
who's responsible for this?

309
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,200
You.

310
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:34,430
You've misunderstood me. You
don't know how much I care for you.

311
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,850
Please listen to me. Sit here.
I'll bring food for you right now.

312
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,146
- Food?
- Yes.

313
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,176
I won't have poison brought by you.

314
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,360
Okay.
But think with a calm mind.

315
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,860
Your uncle has thrown you out.
No problem.

316
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,040
Take this broken house as your home
and stay for as long as you want.

317
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,020
- Here? - Yes.
- In this house? - Yes.

318
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,510
You ruined my life.
Will I stay in your house? Rogue!

319
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:08,460
You're getting angry for no reason.
Please listen to me.

320
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,260
I made a mistake once but
I'm not like that now.

321
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,370
You're a scoundrel.
A rogue.

322
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:25,770
If you think I'm a scoundrel,
a rogue, then beat me.

323
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,320
Beat me.

324
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,840
I know Gauri, I know...

325
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,410
because of me you had
to go through a lot of trouble.

326
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,210
You lost your job and your house.
But Gauri...

327
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,460
I'll get a job for you
by this evening.

328
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:01,890
Please believe me.
Even a bad man has a heart.

329
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,970
Yes, Gauri, please sit.
There's nothing to eat at home now.

330
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,710
But I'll get it right now.

331
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,770
Till then you sit here.
I'll get food for you.

332
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,020
There she is constable.

333
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,690
I'm not lying. She's holding a
club in her hand and waiting still.

334
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,380
I'd informed the police
about the theft she committed.

335
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,326
That's the reason
she's waiting to beat me.

336
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,450
I'd have argued if it was a man.
Unfortunately, she's a woman.

337
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,580
You may confirm it with the
residents, if you aren't convinced.

338
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,410
- Am I telling a lie?
- Not at all.

339
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,240
- You cheat! You scoundrel! I'll kill you!
- Stop it.

340
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,900
- Move, I'll kill him!
- She's beating me in your presence.

341
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,880
- What are you up to?
- I'll break your head.

342
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,020
- Stop it. - I won't spare him.
- Stop it.

343
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,570
He's a rogue and a liar too.
But you believe him always.

344
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,056
You never listen to me.
Whatever he says is the truth?

345
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,576
And I only tell lies?

346
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,250
I have neither wronged
nor have I harmed anyone.

347
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,390
But you did beat him
mercilessly, didn't you?

348
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,100
I'd have even killed him
if I could.

349
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:47,110
This scoundrel has ruined
my life. I won't spare him.

350
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,380
I don't care even if you send
me to the gallows afterwards.

351
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,020
Did you hear that?
She dares to confess her crime.

352
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,590
Good day, sir. What has
this wretch done now?

353
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,410
- She'd stolen a necklace last time.
- Did you hear that?

354
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,190
- Her own uncle accuses her.
- Shut up, will you?

355
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,860
- Yes sir.
- You'd promised to take good care of her, right?

356
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,920
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn't you then?

357
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,630
Are you aware she went
to his house to beat him?

358
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,550
Is that so?
She'll ruin us some day.

359
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,520
- Am I right?
- Oh God.

360
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,300
I suggest you take her home
and take proper care of her.

361
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,770
- Don't repeat this mistake again.
- Alright.

362
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,540
Beware. If you take her
home I'll break your bones.

363
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,570
I rescued her once, but
I can't do anything this time.

364
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,560
You're her guardian.
Who will look after her now?

365
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,580
To hell with her. She's not a child
anymore. She can manage herself.

366
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,270
- This wretch has troubled us enough.
- That's true.

367
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:03,670
I'm an indiscriminate woman,
but you're rational people, right?

368
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,250
Bankelal is a noble man too.
Inspector...

369
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,110
auntie may drive me
away and so can uncle...

370
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,900
and the whole world
may disown me.

371
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,496
Every dog has its day
and so will I.

372
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,220
I'll teach Bankelal
a lesson that day.

373
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,940
Alright. Don't act in haste.
Calm down.

374
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,650
Your uncle isn't willing
to accept you.

375
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,010
I don't want to live
in his house either.

376
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,190
I consider them dead.

377
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:40,730
I'd prefer to live alone
and die of starvation.

378
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,240
But I won't rest in peace
until I teach Banke a lesson.

379
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,780
Did you hear that, sir?

380
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,590
You don't seem to be normal.
Hence I won't permit you...

381
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,590
to move from this place.

382
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,090
I'll have to make alternate
arrangements for you.

383
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,110
Kashinath, I'll try to get
her admitted in an orphanage.

384
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:08,280
I won't live in an orphanage.

385
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,080
You cannot go elsewhere until
this issue is sorted out, Gauri.

386
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,180
You have no place to live.
I'd advise you to live in the orphanage.

387
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,480
Catch hold of her!

388
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:28,100
Let me go! I won't live
in an orphanage!

389
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,430
- Let me go.
- Set her free.

390
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,080
Come here.

391
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,410
This is her record.

392
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,640
Seems to be a complicated case.

393
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,700
You've a long tale
to narrate, indeed.

394
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,960
Come here.

395
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,530
What's your name?

396
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:30,320
He is Muralidhar, our friend.

397
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,736
She's the superintendent
of our hostel.

398
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,360
We address her as elder sister.

399
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,340
Are you annoyed?

400
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,800
- Don't you like this place?
- No.

401
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,910
I don't like the place, either.
I wish to leave the place.

402
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,440
I feel like going
to a more serene place.

403
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,950
I wish I could climb a
mountain and reach its peak.

404
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,890
But I can't.

405
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,240
There is sorrow all over the world.

406
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,610
People aren't leading content lives.

407
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,360
- We can't escape these things.
- Don't give me advice!

408
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,470
I haven't come here
to listen to this nonsense.

409
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,850
It's not nonsense. It's a fact of life.

410
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,860
I've experienced it all
and I've seen...

411
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,180
the true colors of life as well.

412
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,680
What's the punishment
you'll impose on me?

413
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,580
- Punishment?
- Why have they brought me here then?

414
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,200
- I don't know.
- But I know very well.

415
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,930
I've been deceived by several
noble men like you.

416
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,040
But now, no one can deceive me.

417
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:00,120
- Not even you.
- If you wish to be punished, you'll be punished.

418
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,870
The first punishment will be
that you go along with Didi...

419
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,910
and freshen up
and have breakfast...

420
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,390
and then relax for a while.

421
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,570
Don't worry about me.
I've been leading...

422
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,490
a peaceful life,
all these years.

423
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,080
Alright, freshen up first.

424
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,130
- Let's go.
- Move, I can walk on my own.

425
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:40,120
Nonsense. Your ashram is a strange
place and so are its residents.

426
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,950
There are a variety
of weird characters here.

427
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,760
But this girl seems
to be unique.

428
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,560
She'll be very troublesome.

429
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:57,870
Each one of them is troublesome
yet I have faith in them.

430
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:03,270
Aren't you aware that a lotus
thrives in dirty water?

431
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,920
And so does one find
a diamond in a coal mine.

432
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,730
Your efforts will be futile.

433
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,580
You must take care
for your health, at least.

434
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:17,160
You're a heart patient. God forbid
if something goes wrong.

435
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,630
Don't worry, Murali.

436
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,760
I'm perfectly alright.

437
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,010
Don't panic. You must
feel at home here.

438
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,440
They're all your friends.

439
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,470
You won't face any problems here.

440
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,380
You sit here while I make
arrangements for your food.

441
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,800
Wow.

442
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,760
Which crime have you committed?

443
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,020
Wow.

444
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,920
- Where are you heading?
- Catch hold of her.

445
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
- Why is there a commotion here?
- That newcomer has fled.

446
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,540
Stop!

447
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,890
- Do you wish to escape?
- Yes.

448
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,140
Come with me.
I'll help you escape.

449
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,050
Catch hold of her!

450
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,680
- What's the matter?
- We were jogging.

451
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,360
- He's lying. I wanted to escape, but he...
- That's true.

452
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,830
Every person is in a hurry...

453
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,620
either to buy a house
or to catch a train.

454
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,280
Tenants, too, try to escape from
the clutches of the owner.

455
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,986
Some try to escape the rains...

456
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,106
while some avoid the sun.
But their motive isn't clear.

457
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,610
- I've to settle scores with someone.
- Settle scores?

458
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,190
- What sort of scores?
- I can't tell you about it.

459
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,590
This is no jail. It's your home.

460
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,940
You're free to do
anything you please.

461
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,260
But there are certain rules
and regulations you can't disobey.

462
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,720
Promise never to escape.

463
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,860
I won't promise.

464
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,020
Alright.

465
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,941
Instead of making false promises,
it's better you not make any at all.

466
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,520
- Sir.
- Don't panic. Everything is alright.

467
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,830
Relax for a while.
You'll have peace of mind.

468
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,040
Keep watch.

469
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:13,450
Thank God I met her.
Else she'd escape.

470
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:20,990
A person tries to escape when
he is overwhelmed by problems.

471
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,250
You're absolutely right.

472
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:25,810
Nonsense.

473
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,160
What's all this?

474
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,910
I asked her to bathe, but she
smeared my face with this instead.

475
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,950
What's all this?
You're being rude.

476
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,976
By all means. I don't fear him.

477
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,200
Drag her.

478
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,630
Wow.

479
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,160
This new girl is a nuisance.

480
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,471
First she tried to escape and then
poured boiling water on the warden.

481
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,650
I wonder what's wrong with her.

482
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,390
Circumstances change a man.

483
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,740
People compel them to
resort to rude behavior.

484
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,010
But nobody troubled her here.

485
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,900
Why is she behaving
abnormally then?

486
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,750
Abnormal?

487
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,210
Let me ask you a question.

488
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,860
Your parents would have nurtured
you with love and care, right?

489
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,920
But just imagine
what you would go through...

490
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:56,260
if you were deprived of
parental love and affection?

491
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,330
What would you do if you
were treated like a slave...

492
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,830
a slave in your own home?

493
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,180
Here's her record. It's mentioned
that she stole a necklace...

494
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,640
but she denies it.

495
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,910
- I wonder what the truth is.
- If she continues to behave like this...

496
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,800
other girls may be
influenced by her, too.

497
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,500
What are we here for then?

498
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,580
Every individual passes
through this stage in life.

499
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,620
It may either mark the beginning
or the end of one's life.

500
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,480
This girl, too, is facing
a similar situation today.

501
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,760
She's reached a periphery
of life and death.

502
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,290
She may be reformed if
we try to help her, perhaps.

503
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,680
But if we refuse to help her,
her life may be ruined.

504
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,260
I don't want that. I'd like her
to stand on her own feet again.

505
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,280
Call her.

506
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,356
I've received yet another
complaint against you.

507
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,880
Is it true that you poured hot
water on her and tried to beat her?

508
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,500
- Yes.
- Why?

509
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,570
She wanted me to bathe
in her presence.

510
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,090
She refused to move.

511
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,490
It was her duty to do so.
I didn't expect this from you.

512
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,630
- I thought you were a good girl.
- Now you know I'm bad, right?

513
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,740
Dismiss me then. Set me free.

514
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,380
You won't move. In fact you'll
live in seclusion henceforth.

515
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,706
You'll live alone. You won't
be allowed to meet anyone.

516
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,430
No one will speak to you, either.

517
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,720
- Take her away.
- Let me go.

518
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,540
You'll regret your decision.

519
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,200
Let me go.

520
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:05,620
You're an ocean of love

521
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:15,140
We crave for a drop of love

522
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:26,200
Return whatever is due to us

523
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Else we'll leave the world

524
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:46,250
You're an ocean of love

525
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,890
This crazy mind...

526
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:34,000
craves for freedom

527
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,660
Desires are naive...

528
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,890
but the path isn't clear

529
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:57,830
Please guide us

530
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,530
We'd forgotten the path

531
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:20,250
You're an ocean of love.
We crave for a drop of it

532
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:54,160
On one side is life

533
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:08,480
We're confused...

534
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,340
as to which side
the periphery lies

535
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,650
Please whisper to us

536
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:31,040
We must choose

537
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:40,890
You're an ocean of love

538
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,580
We crave for a drop of it

539
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,290
Wow.

540
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,940
Don't worry. I won't harm you.

541
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,850
Friend. May you be rid of
the evil spell cast on you.

542
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,220
You seem to be a snob,
but I love such people.

543
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:54,160
- Have you been trapped for the first time?
- I'm not trapped.

544
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,250
I, too, denied the fact when
I wronged for the first time.

545
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,540
- Understand?
- I'm not a thief.

546
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,790
- I haven't done anything.
- Calm down.

547
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,360
It tends to happen with beginners.

548
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,510
Don't worry, I'll train you.

549
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,460
I'll train you in a such a manner
that you'll be an expert.

550
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,210
What's your opinion?

551
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,530
Wow.

552
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,010
Strong arms indeed.

553
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:42,900
You mustn't attack anyone
by slapping them.

554
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:47,130
You must use your fists.

555
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,590
You wretch.

556
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,900
What are you up to?
Let me go.

557
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,080
You wretch.

558
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,520
- I won't spare you.
- How dare you beat me?

559
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,760
Slowly. It hurts.

560
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,380
Alright. I accept defeat.

561
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,260
Shake hands.

562
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,470
What's going on here?

563
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,970
- A tiff.
- A tiff?

564
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:05,040
We had an argument and then
it grew into a fight.

565
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,730
- We're trying to compromise now.
- Get out of here.

566
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,240
- Why'd you throw away the food?
- I don't want your food.

567
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,960
You may take it away.

568
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:36,770
- What's the matter?
- Gauri's not been eating since yesterday.

569
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:41,360
- We tried our best. - Is she ill?
- No. She's perfectly alright.

570
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,260
But she refuses to eat.

571
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,820
I'll try.

572
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,860
I heard you haven't eaten since yesterday.
What's the matter?

573
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,510
Why are you starving yourself?
You mustn't behave this way.

574
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,580
You aren't a child any longer.
Get up.

575
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,770
I'll get annoyed if you don't eat.
Come on, get up.

576
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,640
I may have to use force,
if you refuse to eat.

577
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,890
I'll send you to
a hospital forcibly...

578
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,640
where you'll be compelled to eat.

579
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,700
We'll wait and see.

580
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:26,870
You're stubborn indeed.

581
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:31,350
She's very adamant.
We must feed her forcibly.

582
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,540
We have no other option.

583
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:38,070
There's a solution to
every problem, doctor.

584
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,130
Give me the plate.

585
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,400
Look dear. Your elder sister is starving.
Will you go and feed her?

586
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:53,170
That's a good girl.

587
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,590
I've brought food for you.
Please have it, sister.

588
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,460
Please have it, sister.

589
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,710
I've brought food for you.
Please have it, sister.

590
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,820
Please have it, sister.

591
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,780
Get out of here!

592
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,790
Calm down.

593
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:46,320
I'll have food. Stop crying.

594
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,030
Stop crying, I'll eat food.

595
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,240
Look at me. Stop crying dear.
I'll have food.

596
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:08,180
Look at me. Stop crying dear.
I'll have food.

597
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:14,830
Look, I'm having food.

598
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:21,140
I'll have food. Look at me.

599
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,150
Don't get annoyed
over trivial matters

600
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:09,930
Don't waste your energy

601
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:17,690
Life is colorful.
Don't brood over your fate

602
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:30,110
Don't get annoyed
over trivial matters

603
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:53,970
You lack lady-like qualities

604
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:11,090
You have suppressed
your true feelings

605
01:05:55,250 --> 01:06:03,110
Every morn is a new one

606
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:19,970
One must live irrespective
of joy or sorrow

607
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:08,070
People are willing
to share one's joy...

608
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:11,860
but not one's sorrow

609
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:28,490
You must face sorrow alone

610
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:40,900
Don't get annoyed over
trivial matters

611
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,620
Don't waste your energy

612
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:52,380
Life is colorful.
Don't brood over your fate

613
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,460
Great.

614
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:37,750
- What happened?
- Save me sister.

615
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,625
What happened?
Who hit you?

616
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:43,759
- My husband. He'll kill me. Please save me.
- But where is he?

617
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,260
He's drunk. He doesn't go to work.
I sold all my ornaments...

618
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,710
gave him everything. He asked
for food. There's nothing at home.

619
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:57,599
He hit me.
He always beats me.

620
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,476
I won't go back.
Please save me sister.

621
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,270
Don't be afraid. You're safe here.

622
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,840
- What's your name? - Radha.
- Call the doctor right away.

623
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,489
The superintendent was praising you.

624
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,040
I feel you can stay in the hall
with the other girls.

625
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,580
Thank you.

626
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:03,000
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

627
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,180
- Very good.
- Please listen.

628
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:08,326
What is it?

629
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:15,040
Now I follow the rules of the home,
live properly. May I go out now?

630
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,320
Yes why not? But not alone.

631
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:23,240
I'm not scared of going out alone.
I promise I'll come back.

632
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,290
But why do you want to go out?

633
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,450
It's a personal reason.
I can't say anything.

634
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,430
But we should know
where you want to go and why.

635
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,780
I have to deal with a man.

636
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:47,470
This home is like your house.
Every house has its rules.

637
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:53,930
As we don't break house rules, you
mustn't break the rules of this home.

638
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:59,950
I'm afraid I can't permit
you to go out alone.

639
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,760
But I'll tell the superintendent
to keep you in the hall henceforth.

640
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:21,040
- Your work can be done.
- What do you mean?

641
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:30,730
You want to go out. He won't permit
it and I'm here. Understood?

642
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:02,690
Com back soon. Okay?

643
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:16,366
Sister.
Where did sister go?

644
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:19,270
- What happened?
- Where did sister go?

645
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,590
- What happened?
- Where did sister go?

646
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:27,420
- She'll be here. Sleep with me.
- Sister.

647
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:32,756
- You go to sleep. She'll come soon.
- No. I want sister.

648
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,250
- No. I want to sleep with sister.
- Quiet.

649
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:57,690
Who's that?

650
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:07,560
- You?
- Yes, it's me.

651
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:15,370
- Do you recognize me?
- What are you saying? How can I forget you?

652
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,580
Good.
I, too, haven't forgotten you.

653
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:23,480
It's a small world
and we will see each other.

654
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,490
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes. But how did you come here?

655
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,670
I've come to repay you.

656
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,020
- Repay? - Yes.
- Me? - Yes.

657
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,550
- What repayment?
- This.

658
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,470
- What are you doing?
- Won't you go to get food for me?

659
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:45,390
- I'll go right now.
- Will you? - I'll go now.

660
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:52,760
No.
Enough Gauri. Please stop.

661
01:14:54,100 --> 01:15:01,070
It's enough. Please listen to me.
I'll do whatever you say.

662
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:05,810
Can you take back
the defamation I've got?

663
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:09,840
Can you remove the tag of a thief
given by you?

664
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:14,730
Can you give back my respect?
Can you make my home again?

665
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,520
Rogue. Scoundrel.

666
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:21,680
I beg of you. I touch your feet.
Please leave me.

667
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:42,430
- Sir, Gauri ran away.
- Ran away? How did this happen?

668
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,790
- How did she get out?
- Maybe she climbed the wall.

669
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:50,210
Climbed the wall?
This is very bad.

670
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:54,600
- We must call the police.
- No need to call the police.

671
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:04,680
- She'll be back.
- Did she go for a walk that she'll come back?

672
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,170
She won't return.

673
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:12,120
She'll come.
I know she'll come. I know it.

674
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:33,520
Where are you going? There's
bondage inside and freedom outside.

675
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:39,250
You're free. You can go where you
like. This chance won't come again.

676
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,660
There's still time. Run away.

677
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:39,940
Oh wanderer, where are you going?

678
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:55,290
There's darkness in your life.
First light a lamp

679
01:17:55,330 --> 01:18:02,530
Oh wanderer, where are you going?

680
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:28,740
The journey of this life
is unknown

681
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:43,740
It's easy to go astray.
There's fear of being lost

682
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:59,200
We may want it,
but the heart is not at peace

683
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:06,640
Oh wanderer, where are you going?

684
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:32,210
The one who doesn't fall,
never wins

685
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:46,970
The one who falls and walks again
is the victor

686
01:19:54,760 --> 01:20:02,200
Make the wounds of your feet
the strength of your heart

687
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:09,530
Oh wanderer, where are you going?

688
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:38,800
Did you ever think
where your destination might be?

689
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:53,470
In this big world,
where is your home?

690
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:08,586
Why did you break
the relations you made?

691
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:15,720
Oh wanderer, where are you going?

692
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,980
Call the police.

693
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:00,750
Where did you go?

694
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,340
- I've come back.
- But you were told not to go out.

695
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:10,930
- I had promised to return.
- But why did you go when I had refused?

696
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,570
Do you know the time?

697
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,960
- But I've come back.
- That doesn't mean you're right.

698
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:21,690
- Where did you go?
- To meet a dear friend.

699
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:25,450
- Which friend?
- His name is Bankelal.

700
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:32,050
He worked with me. He's a cook
but his real work is robbery.

701
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:37,510
He lives near the station.
Enough, or do you want to know more?

702
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:40,420
Yes.
Why did you go to meet him?

703
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:46,490
- I had to repay him.
- That's what I want to know, what repayment?

704
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,180
- I won't say.
- Really?

705
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:02,380
You couldn't have gotten out
of here by yourself. Who helped you?

706
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:13,370
No one. I went alone.

707
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:20,520
If you tell the truth,
I'll forget what you did.

708
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:26,130
Else you'll be punished with that
room and no meeting with anyone.

709
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,670
You can give me any punishment.
I don't care.

710
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:33,510
Okay. You may go.

711
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,510
- Sir, I helped her.
- She's lying.

712
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:45,050
I'm telling the truth,
I helped her to go out.

713
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:50,320
You're saying this to save me.
Only I'll get the punishment.

714
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:53,450
Tell him you didn't help me.

715
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:59,720
- It's not good to hide the truth from sir.
- But it's not the truth!

716
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,800
Take her.

717
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:07,690
You can't punish her. You'll regret it
if you punish her because of me.

718
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:13,510
You can't do what you want. I won't
let you do it. You can't punish her.

719
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:23,780
I'm very happy, you spoke the truth.
But you shouldn't have helped her.

720
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:27,590
I know. Please forgive me.

721
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:31,870
Okay. You may go.

722
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:43,810
Gauri's past has been awful
and it has affected her.

723
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:46,770
We'll need to take care of her.

724
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:52,660
Keep her alone tonight in the room.
We'll see in the morning.

725
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:03,620
Gauri went, Putli went, sister went
but you're still here.

726
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,880
Stop worrying and take rest.

727
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,960
- Brother.
- Yes? - Come on.

728
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,440
Come on.

729
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,160
Sir said to keep you here tonight.

730
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,730
It's only for tonight.

731
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:30,740
Yes. I know everything.
I've gone bad again.

732
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,910
I've made another mistake
so I must be punished.

733
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:38,440
I must be separated from the other girls
so they don't become like me, right?

734
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:43,520
Don't think that. Stay here tonight.
It'll be fine in the morning.

735
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:46,150
Please understand.
Aren't you a nice girl?

736
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:50,320
Yes, I'm very nice and
I'll be better than this.

737
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:54,770
I'll be so nice, he won't keep
me here for long. Understood?

738
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:59,270
- Why are you here? Go away.
- Okay, fine.

739
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:34,330
What are you doing?

740
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,800
Come inside.

741
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:52,120
Come in.
Everyone wants to come in.

742
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:57,400
Come.
Come inside.

743
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:00,880
- Sir.
- What is it, Putli?

744
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:06,440
- Gauri is creating havoc.
- What did she do?

745
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:11,230
- She was put in the room alone, as you said.
- Yes.

746
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:14,430
- But since morning she's breaking things.
- Really?

747
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:21,010
She broke the bed and glasses, tore
the mattress, doesn't let anyone in.

748
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:26,460
Murli, I can see hope for her now.

749
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:34,430
The guilty take punishment quietly
but the innocent act against it.

750
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,680
Yesterday Gauri went to
Bankelal's house.

751
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:45,210
He works at the same place
where she was caught for robbery.

752
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:52,820
Okay, but what's the link between
Gauri, Bankelal, glasses and hope?

753
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:57,820
It's there. Go and find out
why Gauri went there.

754
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:03,500
If you need to, take police help.
Go right away.

755
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,130
Okay. If you say, I'll go.

756
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:13,830
Putli, please get my coat.

757
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,940
Mr. Ashok, you can't go.
You must not go there.

758
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:25,390
I know it's your duty
to care for me...

759
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:29,840
but it's my duty to care for them.

760
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:36,980
You're my doctor; I'm their doctor.

761
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:14,180
- I'm sorry, I had to trouble you.
- No problem. Open the door.

762
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:18,760
She's mad with anger.
She hits whoever goes in.

763
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,010
She throws things at that person.
She's in a mad fit.

764
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:26,010
- Don't worry, open the door.
- No sir, please don't go in.

765
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:30,780
Sir.

766
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:32,670
Sir?

767
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,760
Great. You have a good voice.
You sing very well.

768
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:11,650
Carefully, it may fall on your feet.

769
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:16,280
Why are you standing?
Sit down.

770
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:29,880
- Where?
- Oh yes. You've really changed the decor of the room.

771
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:32,450
You've worked very hard.
Right?

772
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,650
- Because I was very angry.
- I can see that.

773
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:42,080
- What punishment will I get now?
- A very big punishment.

774
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:48,340
- What?
- You'll have to sing again that song you were singing just now.

775
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,360
- Song?
- Yes.

776
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:56,330
- I don't know how to sing.
- You sing well. Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

777
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,770
Anyway, no problem. Now I'll
break the glass and you sing.

778
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:10,360
What are you doing?
You're breaking the glass.

779
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:15,150
- Am I breaking the glass?
- Please, I don't know how to sing.

780
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:19,890
You know how. If you don't sing,
I'll break the rest of the glass, too.

781
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,240
Listen. I'll sing.

782
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:24,810
Okay, sing.

783
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,250
But not here.
Please take me outside.

784
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,580
Okay, come outside.

785
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,080
Come.

786
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:41,480
Can you sing here?
Come on, sing.

787
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:49,090
Yes. Okay, start.

788
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:47,660
My darling lied to me

789
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:56,510
He lost but doesn't admit it

790
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:06,380
My darling...

791
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:20,600
My dear claimed
to be a great player

792
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:33,350
My dear claimed to be a great player
but turned out to be ignorant

793
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:42,130
He cheated but
yet is angry with me

794
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:57,000
My darling...

795
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:03,740
My darling lied to me

796
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:08,730
My darling...

797
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,410
Your talks, oh Krishna...

798
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:40,240
Your talks,
oh Krishna, make me anxious

799
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:48,860
Your taunts make me restless

800
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:03,240
My darling...

801
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,870
My darling lied to me

802
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,440
Very good.

803
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:23,190
I knew you sang well but
I didn't know you sang so well.

804
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,720
Hearing your song, I'm very happy.

805
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,850
You don't know what you are.

806
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:39,760
The diamond doesn't know it's worth.
Come on.

807
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:46,130
Sit.

808
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,030
This window glass is strong.

809
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:55,990
Don't break them.

810
01:36:56,950 --> 01:37:01,550
Please forgive me this time.
I'll never do it again.

811
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:06,320
I'll be good, I promise.

812
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:10,480
Very good.
I expected this from you.

813
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:16,100
Because I know you may break
all the rules, not obey me...

814
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:19,450
but you'll never break
your promise. I know that.

815
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,930
Gauri, there's one more thing.

816
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,780
I was thinking about Bankelal.

817
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:40,260
In my opinion,
you didn't steal that chain.

818
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,360
Am I right?

819
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:05,140
Great. What a den. The rich
must have lost everything here.

820
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:09,000
- Do you know whose den this is?
- Whose? - Mr. Bankelal's.

821
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:18,630
There were many Banke's in Lucknow.
No one can match their style.

822
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:26,390
So this is Bankelal.
But who spoiled his looks?

823
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:28,020
- Sir.
- Yes?

824
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,740
The looks haven't been spoiled,
but have been made.

825
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:36,960
Have been made? Are you in love?
Who is that Juliet?

826
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,046
Great name.

827
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:44,020
- Pehelwan! - Yes?
- Lower your voice.

828
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:49,300
Okay. But tell me,
why did she hit you?

829
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:56,120
Let me become first. Then I'll deal
with her. She's acting too smart.

830
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:01,640
- I got her into trouble once.
- What did you do?

831
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:07,750
I tied a chain to her veil.
She was saved and was mad at me.

832
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,180
She's a woman, so I spared her.

833
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,490
You did the right thing but...

834
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:20,710
That's an old story. Let's gamble.
Who knows when you'll come again.

835
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,630
- Should I come?
- Yes. Come on.

836
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:29,760
I'll open the door.
You go.

837
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:32,370
Go now.

838
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:36,540
Hey pals.
The police are here.

839
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:46,290
- Hey, run.
- Wait here. Search everyone.

840
01:39:55,820 --> 01:40:00,790
- What's all this?
- We didn't do anything. Banke called us here.

841
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:05,160
- They came to mourn my father's death.
- Shut up. - Okay, sir.

842
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,360
Inspector.

843
01:40:10,450 --> 01:40:11,850
This stuff was there.

844
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,170
- Whose ornaments are these?
- My wife's.

845
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:18,760
- Where's she? When did you marry?
- She died before the marriage.

846
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:20,166
- Silence!
- Yes, sir.

847
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:23,710
Sir, all these were stolen by Bankelal.
We aren't responsible.

848
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:28,220
Quiet! The court will decide that.
No one must try to escape.

849
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:34,356
- Mr. Bankelal.
- Yes?

850
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:40,030
Every dog has his day.
Please go to jail.

851
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:42,470
You'll have a nice time there.

852
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:48,850
Sister, why has he called me?

853
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:54,300
- Go in. He'll tell you.
- But did I do something wrong?

854
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,260
You'll know soon.

855
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:16,950
Bankelal has been arrested.
Many things were found at his place.

856
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,400
He also admitted that
he tied the chain to your veil.

857
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:24,900
Now we have the proof
of your innocence. Take, read it.

858
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,880
- I don't know how to read.
- This means you're free now.

859
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:39,350
- Free?
- Yes. Now you can go from here.

860
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:41,650
But where should I go?

861
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:51,190
I have no home. I have no one.
Please let be stay here.

862
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:57,660
You need help for the home.
I'll do the work here.

863
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:06,230
Sister, please tell him
to let me stay here.

864
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:11,850
- Let her stay here.
- Stay here until we find a good home for you.

865
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:15,480
Thank you.

866
01:42:18,410 --> 01:42:20,820
Don't break the glass.
It's very expensive.

867
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:24,420
Eight rupees and four annas
for a dozen.

868
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:27,360
Yes, I mean no.

869
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:29,470
Listen...

870
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:35,080
Murlidhar did all this for you.

871
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,460
You must thank him.

872
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:41,840
I don't want any thank you.
She must thank you...

873
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:48,470
because you gave the idea
and I acted on it.

874
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:52,300
The soldiers fight the war but
the credit goes to the captain.

875
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,360
What do you feel, Gauri?

876
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:59,030
You're all great.
I'm very small.

877
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:02,130
I can't say anything.

878
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:11,930
Whatever you did for me...

879
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,640
Listen everyone.

880
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:23,760
What happened Gauri?

881
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:28,130
This is a long story.

882
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,780
- Whose story sister?
- The story of a small doll.

883
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:35,200
- Please tell me.
- You'll listen to it? - Yes.

884
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:55,780
Listen to the long story
of a small doll

885
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:06,240
The way the night
hears the stars talking

886
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:11,150
Listen to the story
of a small doll

887
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:34,040
Happiness came with a breeze,
on the path of love

888
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:40,690
The clouds of sorrow have gone,
revealing a beautiful moon

889
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:46,050
The spring came
and danced with joy

890
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:56,170
And it danced with joy

891
01:44:56,430 --> 01:45:01,320
The stars smiled and
the seasons of happiness sparkled

892
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:06,496
Listen to the long story
of a small doll

893
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:11,530
The way the night
hears the stars speaking

894
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:15,870
Listen to the story
of a small doll

895
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:32,720
The dreams and wishes
at last came true

896
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:38,090
The world is unknown
but everyone seems nice

897
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:53,040
The sighs became songs
and the paths opened

898
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,810
And the paths opened

899
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:08,070
This is the story of life
and the tale of the heart

900
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:13,136
Listen to the long story
of a small doll

901
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:18,186
The way the night
hears the stars speaking

902
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:22,860
Listen to the story
of a small doll

903
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:54,670
- Greetings. Are you the matron of this home?
- Yes, tell me.

904
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:59,110
A girl named Putli stays here.
I'd like to meet her.

905
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:02,200
But why?
What business do you have with her?

906
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:08,820
I'm a relative from her village.
Her old mother is very sick.

907
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:13,870
She has sent a message for Putli.
If you permit, I'll meet her.

908
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:17,980
- Your name?
- My name is Chandulal.

909
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:27,500
- Wait here. - Okay.
- I'll get her. - Fine.

910
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,610
Great.

911
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:53,910
Putli, come right away.

912
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:58,276
What are you doing, Chandu?

913
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:03,960
I came to see you but got this.
See the amount of money.

914
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:07,460
- Put it back.
- What do you mean?

915
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,590
I mean you can't take this money.
Put it back or I'll scream.

916
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:17,760
Don't get mad. We won't have this
chance again. You'll get half of it.

917
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:23,150
This is money for the poor
of this home. You can't take it.

918
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:28,590
- Don't behave like a saint now.
- Put it back or I'll kill you.

919
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:32,060
Look at yourself first
before telling me.

920
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:35,580
Wait Chandu!

921
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:39,140
Sister!

922
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:42,320
Sister, thief!

923
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:49,400
- Move away.
- Thief...

924
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:52,370
- Catch him. - Thief.
- Give me this.

925
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:19,770
Sit down.

926
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:30,330
To catch that thief you didn't
bother even for your life.

927
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:37,660
Thank God you're safe. But why
did you put yourself in danger?

928
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:45,400
Sir, I was a thief once.
I, too, used to steal from others.

929
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:53,240
But I didn't know what the person
who lost his things felt.

930
01:52:54,650 --> 01:53:00,170
That I know today.
When I saw him robbing...

931
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:07,180
I felt as if he was robbing me.
So I followed him.

932
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:15,260
Sir, today I learned
how wrong it is to be a bad person.

933
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:22,670
Very good. I can't express how
happy I am to hear this from you.

934
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:26,250
But if something
should happen to you?

935
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:31,260
So what? The world
would be relieved of a burden.

936
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:37,490
You, a burden? We're proud of you.
The home is proud of you.

937
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:45,000
Not because you saved the money,
but because today goodness has won.

938
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:49,740
This is a victory for truth.

939
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:57,330
Have a look. This is for you.

940
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:05,850
- For me?
- Yes. You can start your life again and be independent.

941
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:08,350
Sir!

942
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:16,760
- See what sir gave me. My own machine.
- Yes, it's very nice.

943
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:19,080
Yes, it's very nice.

944
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:28,460
Before today I used to cut pockets.
Now I'll try to stitch them.

945
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:30,690
That's great.

946
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:38,100
With this, my sins
will be washed away. Right?

947
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:45,570
Your sins are washed away
with what you did today.

948
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:47,910
Come on.

949
01:54:55,660 --> 01:55:01,690
- Where are you going?
- I want to meet your sir. - You can't go in.

950
01:55:02,110 --> 01:55:06,010
- Where's your sir?
- Watchman, leave him. Let him come.

951
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:10,870
- So you're the one.
- What business do you have?

952
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:12,510
Where's my wife?

953
01:55:13,210 --> 01:55:16,140
- Your wife? - Yes.
- What's her name? - Radha.

954
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,280
- So Radha is your wife?
- Yes.

955
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:23,486
- She's here.
- Call her. I'll take her home.

956
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:27,240
- First, tell me, why did she leave you?
- That's none of your business!

957
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:32,640
Maybe it concerns your wife.
When she came here, she was injured.

958
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:39,460
You never took care of her, but
you screamed at her and beat her.

959
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:44,570
She's my wife. If I want, I can kill her!
You have no right to keep her!

960
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:49,910
I have the right of humanity.

961
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:56,230
I've seen many like you. You're
fooling people. Your home is a hoax.

962
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:01,230
If you don't return my wife,
I'll kill you.

963
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:06,470
You want to kill me?
Fine, kill me.

964
01:56:07,810 --> 01:56:12,220
My life isn't precious.
If I die, no one will lose anything.

965
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:19,660
If you think I've done something
bad to you, you can kill me.

966
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:24,150
Why are you staring?
Kill me.

967
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:27,690
You can fool the world
with your speech, not me.

968
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:32,550
You encouraged my wife,
destroyed my home, I'll kill you.

969
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:38,090
So, you think we've
destroyed your home?

970
01:56:40,450 --> 01:56:44,530
But, do you know what she would
have done, if she hadn't come here?

971
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:48,300
- Who are you? I know everything.
- You don't know anything.

972
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:51,650
You're blind in anger.
Come with me.

973
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:54,560
See where your wife is
and what she's doing.

974
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,220
See these children?

975
01:57:08,690 --> 01:57:10,850
Can you any difference between them
and other children?

976
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:16,430
Aren't they too innocent,
pure and decent?

977
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:20,670
But there's a difference
between them and other children.

978
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:26,370
At their birth, their parents left
them on the roads, in garbage...

979
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:29,990
and left them at the mercy
of their fate to suffer.

980
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:36,070
Do you know why? Because they're a
sign of the sins of their parents.

981
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:39,870
Society calls them illegitimate.

982
01:57:41,150 --> 01:57:44,300
But society doesn't think the parents...

983
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:46,290
are illegitimate, only the children.

984
01:57:47,390 --> 01:57:52,190
We keep these kids here
to protect them from suffering.

985
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:58,000
We make them aware, they too have
a place and a right in the world.

986
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:04,920
Who knows? Someday one of them
may become a great human being...

987
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:09,530
and pride of the nation.
Come with me.

988
01:58:12,270 --> 01:58:13,470
- Kamla.
- Yes?

989
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:18,320
See this girl. She too is the wife
of a respected man like you.

990
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:25,260
Her husband left her in the care of
a relative and went out for work.

991
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:31,100
But that relative tried to rape her.

992
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:36,050
To save her respect,
this brave girl killed that man.

993
01:58:37,690 --> 01:58:42,910
She was arrested
but the law wasn't blind...

994
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:46,020
and proclaimed her innocent
and set her free.

995
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:50,786
But her husband
didn't take her as innocent...

996
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:53,600
and threw her out of the house.

997
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:58,780
She came here looking for support.

998
01:59:00,110 --> 01:59:05,400
Do you know if she hadn't come here,
what her condition would be?

999
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:09,410
Come.

1000
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:16,780
See these photographs.
See these brides.

1001
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:23,610
When they came here some were
orphans, some widows or victims.

1002
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:29,900
Now all of them are married
and are the respect of their families.

1003
01:59:31,730 --> 01:59:35,520
See these young men.
They have humanity and courage.

1004
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:42,400
They have accepted and given
respect to the victims of society.

1005
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:47,990
I feel they're great. I've haven't
made this home. You've made it!

1006
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:51,630
If there weren't people like you,
this home would not be here.

1007
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:57,470
Please forgive me. I misunderstood
you. I made a mistake.

1008
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:02,700
Get up.

1009
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:10,970
A man makes mistakes. But a human
is one who regrets his mistakes.

1010
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:12,430
Sir.

1011
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,680
See who is here.

1012
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:27,590
Please come home.

1013
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:31,640
Please forgive me.

1014
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:51,810
This will give you sleep
and you'll be fine very soon.

1015
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:55,610
But you'll need to rest
for a few days.

1016
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:59,170
No work, do you understand?

1017
02:01:20,990 --> 02:01:22,290
How is he?

1018
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:28,676
He's okay but he has heart disease.
Anything can happen.

1019
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:32,270
- Sister.
- Be patient. What can we do?

1020
02:01:32,970 --> 02:01:35,720
Pray that he recovers soon.

1021
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:42,910
God can't do anything for him. God
doesn't do anything for a good man.

1022
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:47,910
We'll be praying here
and he'll die there.

1023
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:53,020
He doesn't need God,
he needs a human being now.

1024
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:56,190
He needs us.
Please let me go there.

1025
02:01:57,030 --> 02:02:01,090
No Gauri,
the doctor said no one can visit him.

1026
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:08,860
God and doctor can't save him.
They can't do anything for him.

1027
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:13,870
You are the ocean of love

1028
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:23,530
We're thirsty
for a drop of your love

1029
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:34,390
If you send us back thirsty...

1030
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:43,470
we will leave this world

1031
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:54,530
You are the ocean of love

1032
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:03,360
We're thirsty
for a drop of your love

1033
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:13,940
You are the ocean of love

1034
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:37,340
The crazy bird of my affection...

1035
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:42,290
is eager to fly

1036
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:51,820
My wings are tender,
my vision is blurred...

1037
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:56,900
and I've to cross the ocean

1038
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,860
Please make him understand...

1039
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:14,740
from where I had lost my way

1040
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:24,090
You are the ocean of love

1041
02:04:24,370 --> 02:04:29,080
We're thirsty
for a drop of your love

1042
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:39,530
You are the ocean of love

1043
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:09,910
You...

1044
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:15,870
- Yes. - How did you come here?
- Walking.

1045
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:26,650
- What's the time?
- Must be 1 AM.

1046
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:30,020
So I slept a lot.

1047
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:34,480
Yes, for 14 hours.
Now how are you feeling?

1048
02:05:35,330 --> 02:05:38,140
I'm fine, absolutely fine.

1049
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,200
Please don't get up.

1050
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:47,490
Stay here. I'll be right back.

1051
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:04,890
Thank you.

1052
02:06:15,230 --> 02:06:20,110
- Where did you go?
- Nowhere, just to thank the doctor.

1053
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:25,680
Where is everyone else?

1054
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:30,500
No one was here. Murli uncle
is sleeping in the other room.

1055
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:34,100
You were sitting here alone?

1056
02:06:36,110 --> 02:06:37,610
You were here with me.

1057
02:06:41,710 --> 02:06:43,610
Did you run from the home
and come here?

1058
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:49,720
- You broke rules of the home again.
- I always do it. It's nothing new.

1059
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,000
Go back right now.

1060
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:59,940
- Is it your order?
- Think it is.

1061
02:07:02,330 --> 02:07:03,630
I won't go.

1062
02:07:05,690 --> 02:07:07,190
I won't obey this order.

1063
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:13,450
I obeyed your orders.
Now you'll have to listen to me.

1064
02:07:21,170 --> 02:07:24,820
No! Please let me stay here.

1065
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:33,670
I have no one in this world.
No one loves me.

1066
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:40,160
Everyone discards me.
Please don't discard me.

1067
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:47,010
Let me stay here.
I'll not trouble you.

1068
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:56,280
Wake Murlidhar.
He'll take you to the home.

1069
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:12,370
Come here.

1070
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:28,800
Sit down.

1071
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:38,150
Gauri, I know how much
you care for me.

1072
02:08:41,410 --> 02:08:45,360
But for me, there's not much
difference between life and death.

1073
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:54,630
- Your life has just started.
- But what have I done?

1074
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:56,700
You didn't do anything.

1075
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:00,540
But Gauri...

1076
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:07,590
every girl needs a home.

1077
02:09:10,070 --> 02:09:13,910
She needs a home to call her own.

1078
02:09:15,690 --> 02:09:18,150
- She needs support.
- Yes.

1079
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:23,050
I understand.

1080
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:32,680
And I know, where my home is...

1081
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:36,680
who my support is...

1082
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:41,340
and for whom I have to live.

1083
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:47,470
You don't know anything.
You're taking death as life.

1084
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:51,520
You want to make a home in ruins.
You've gone mad.

1085
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,506
Please don't get up.
Please lie down.

1086
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:58,620
If you cared for me
you would never think or say this.

1087
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:05,470
I want to make your life and
you want to destroy it. Is that it?

1088
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:09,890
- What's happening to you? Please don't worry. Lie down.
- No.

1089
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:15,890
Unless you take back your words,
I won't be at peace.

1090
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:20,120
I'll do whatever you say,
but for God's sake lie down.

1091
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:22,070
Please sit down.

1092
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,040
You're ignorant.

1093
02:10:37,870 --> 02:10:39,070
Very ignorant.

1094
02:10:44,850 --> 02:10:46,050
Sit down.

1095
02:10:56,150 --> 02:10:57,750
You care for me a lot.

1096
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:06,560
Do you want me to recover soon?

1097
02:11:08,850 --> 02:11:09,950
Yes.

1098
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:15,760
Then will you listen to me?

1099
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:22,290
I'll do whatever you say,
but first you get well soon.

1100
02:11:23,060 --> 02:11:24,560
I'll do what you say.

1101
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,780
Do you promise?

1102
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:35,800
Yes, I promise.

1103
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,740
Then get married to someone.

1104
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:43,890
Settle your home.

1105
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:50,950
Marriage?

1106
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:55,440
Home?

1107
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:58,600
Yes, Gauri.

1108
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:03,350
You faced a lot of problems.

1109
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:07,960
You've suffered a lot.

1110
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:12,290
Now you need a home...

1111
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:19,320
where you'll find happiness
and joy...

1112
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:23,590
and life.

1113
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:31,940
Please agree, Gauri.

1114
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:44,946
What is it brother?

1115
02:12:44,970 --> 02:12:47,380
- Come right away.
- Coming.

1116
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:54,700
- What happened?
- I've found the man I was looking for.

1117
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:57,366
- Who is he?
- You.

1118
02:12:57,390 --> 02:13:00,400
Me? But I was here.
Did I do something wrong?

1119
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:03,480
No, you did nothing wrong.
I blundered.

1120
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:09,090
You're always with me but
I didn't think of this before.

1121
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:13,500
- Think of what? Please say.
- Don't hurry, I'll tell you.

1122
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:17,920
- Didn't the doctor say that I need rest?
- Yes.

1123
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:23,320
- And you all say I should leave for a few days.
- Right.

1124
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:26,076
So I've decided to go.

1125
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:31,306
Very good. You want me to come with
you. I'll pack things, we'll go...

1126
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:34,540
No. I'll go alone.

1127
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:38,330
- Alone? Then why did you call me?
- Listen, Murli.

1128
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:44,810
There's very important work
for you here.

1129
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:48,820
You'll have to stay here, for me.

1130
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:54,850
Nonsense. I won't let you go
anywhere alone. Tell me the work.

1131
02:13:57,870 --> 02:13:59,620
- You know Gauri.
- Very well.

1132
02:14:01,310 --> 02:14:04,590
- She's a nice girl.
- Yes, she's a very nice girl.

1133
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:10,010
She's faced a lot of problems
in her life. Now she needs a home.

1134
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:12,896
She needs a husband.

1135
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:17,030
I wanted to say the same.
Take Gauri with you.

1136
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:20,056
I'll make arrangements for the
marriage. Don't worry.

1137
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:21,380
Don't be absurd!

1138
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:25,790
I'm asking you to marry Gauri.

1139
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:29,986
Me marry Gauri?
Have you gone mad?

1140
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:34,070
No, Murli.
What I'm saying is right.

1141
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:37,630
You have to settle down, too.

1142
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:43,810
Gauri will be a nice wife for you.

1143
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:50,000
- I know her.
- I know her, too.

1144
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:52,726
Before marrying me
she'll commit suicide.

1145
02:14:52,750 --> 02:14:54,620
Suicide? Why?

1146
02:14:55,180 --> 02:15:00,730
Why? You know the reason why,
and even I know it.

1147
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:03,910
But she's promised me.

1148
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:06,380
You can compel her
to promise you anything.

1149
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,786
But I know where her heart lies,
who she lives for.

1150
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:14,070
Wrong. She's innocent. She doesn't
know what's good or bad for her.

1151
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:17,640
If she's faltered,
it's our duty to guide her.

1152
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:22,930
If you forcibly marry her with
someone, her life will be destroyed.

1153
02:15:23,050 --> 02:15:25,220
No, you're wrong!

1154
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:28,930
I'm always wrong,
but this time you're wrong.

1155
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:31,890
Please try to understand me, Murli.

1156
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:39,400
I understand Gauri's feelings.
And I'm neither God nor a stone.

1157
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:42,990
I've thought a lot about this.

1158
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:48,640
But I have to do what's good
for Gauri and the home.

1159
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:52,200
That's the reason
I've asked you, brother.

1160
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:58,720
If I know she's in the right hands,
I'll be at peace.

1161
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:05,390
- Now my peace is in your hands.
- Brother...

1162
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:10,260
You call me a brother and
think of me as an elder brother.

1163
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:13,900
Can't you do this much
for your brother?

1164
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:19,220
You've given life to many people.

1165
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:23,860
You've taught them to live and
now you want to run away from life?

1166
02:16:24,330 --> 02:16:27,360
Yes, I want to run away.

1167
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:34,980
I can't fight with life anymore.
I've lost completely.

1168
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:39,190
I've lost.

1169
02:16:40,129 --> 02:16:43,409
Okay. I'll make arrangements
for you to go.

1170
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:51,850
But, you didn't answer my question.

1171
02:16:53,930 --> 02:16:57,220
If you're happy with my consent,
it's a yes from me.

1172
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:29,720
Why are you so sad?
Now you should be happy.

1173
02:17:30,209 --> 02:17:35,639
You'll have a home. You'll be happy
and content. Murli is a nice man.

1174
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:40,780
He wants to see you.
Shall I send him in?

1175
02:17:53,129 --> 02:17:55,309
I've brought gifts for you.

1176
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:01,460
Gifts are useful in marriage,
engagement, birthday, festivals...

1177
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:05,450
or to please someone.
They're very useful. Gauri, but...

1178
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:11,760
It's all nonsense. See I've brought
ornaments and clothes for you.

1179
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:13,240
See Gauri...

1180
02:18:15,410 --> 02:18:20,710
I'm talking and you're standing
quietly. What does this mean?

1181
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:26,900
- What do want me to say?
- I want you to say a lot today. Sit down.

1182
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:38,940
Whatever I ask you,
answer yes or no. Understood?

1183
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:45,790
- Do you know your marriage is fixed?
- Yes.

1184
02:18:46,549 --> 02:18:50,799
- Do you know with whom your marriage is fixed?
- Yes.

1185
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:55,590
- So are you happy?
- Yes, I'm happy.

1186
02:18:56,320 --> 02:19:00,810
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
Have you forgotten everything?

1187
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:04,230
When your life was being destroyed,
brother saved you.

1188
02:19:04,639 --> 02:19:06,869
Today when it's the matter
of his life and death...

1189
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:10,490
you're sitting here,
getting married, you're happy.

1190
02:19:12,510 --> 02:19:14,010
But this is his order.

1191
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:18,800
You've never obeyed his orders.
Why obey them now?

1192
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:24,240
Girls are strange. When you should
have obeyed his orders you didn't.

1193
02:19:24,570 --> 02:19:29,470
Now when you shouldn't obey,
you say it's his order, his command.

1194
02:19:29,870 --> 02:19:31,720
Did you understand
what I'm trying to say?

1195
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:41,420
Listen, brother ruined his life for others.
He worked day and night for others.

1196
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:45,860
Now his health has deteriorated
and he's leaving here.

1197
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:49,800
- Where?
- I don't know, he didn't tell anyone.

1198
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:53,630
- Who is going with him?
- He doesn't want to take anyone, not me, either.

1199
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:57,100
But it's not good for him
to go alone. He must be stopped.

1200
02:19:57,340 --> 02:20:01,900
What have I been saying for so long?
You can stop him, bring him back...

1201
02:20:02,070 --> 02:20:04,950
and save him.
Tell me, is this my duty or yours?

1202
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:09,390
- I can give my life for him.
- Then go now or else he'll leave.

1203
02:20:17,550 --> 02:20:22,970
I brought this for you. Take it
as a gift from your elder brother.

1204
02:20:50,770 --> 02:20:53,620
- Where's your sir?
- He's gone out. - Where?

1205
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:57,200
For a walk. He said he wanted
to see the sea before going.

1206
02:20:57,790 --> 02:21:00,510
- He's been out for a long time.
- Long time? - Yes.

1207
02:21:31,710 --> 02:21:34,030
Yes. What happened?

1208
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:39,860
Nothing. I was feeling dizzy,
so I came here.

1209
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:49,820
- But how did you come here?
- You were going, leaving me alone.

1210
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:56,530
- So did you...
- Yes, I didn't obey your order again.

1211
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:06,460
- But you promised.
- Yes I did. But you're my life.

1212
02:22:08,580 --> 02:22:09,680
Understood?

1213
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:15,330
- Listen...
- No, I won't listen to anything.

1214
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:19,180
You'll live a hundred years.

1215
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:23,830
Now no one can take you away
from me, not even death.

1216
02:22:25,220 --> 02:22:32,150
Come back to that path of life,
which you showed me.

1217
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:38,320
Now there's no limit before us.
Get up.
