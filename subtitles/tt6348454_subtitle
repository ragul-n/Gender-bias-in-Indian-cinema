1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


3
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,417
Hey, I'm driving!

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,458
(Song playing)

5
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,083
Don't be mean.
A kiss is all I asked.

6
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,833
No way.

7
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,375
Hey, please!

8
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,000
Just one kiss...
Like this.

9
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,292
I Promise.
- Fraudster

10
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,458
What do you call this?

11
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,625
That was just rehearsal.
- Really?

12
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:11,875
Hey, Rhino!

13
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,000
Why did you use
the room freshener?

14
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,875
Boss, Sadhana is here.

15
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:18,042
Taunting me, are you?

16
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,292
You always over use the perfume!

17
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,958
Thatâ€™s Victoria Secret
Line's Perfume.

18
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:26,500
You bought it from the
local store, right?

19
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,625
Country attar packed
in a fancy way.

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,542
This your Victoria Secret?

21
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:32,917
What about you?

22
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,167
You use the local ingredients
and sell it as international cuisine.

23
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:38,625
Hey!

24
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,917
Don't make fun of my recipe.

25
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,792
I have won awards.

26
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,667
I was given the best...
Enter... something like that.

27
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,750
That's Entrepreneur.
- Exactly.

28
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,542
Forget it...
Let me come to the point.

29
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:53,167
You are one among the top 25 upcoming
stars selected by a weekly magazine.

30
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,750
I wrote the article about you.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,083
Let me read it out.

32
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,417
Chef Arun.
Age: 25

33
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,708
He lost his eyesight
at the age of 15.

34
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,375
That didn't stop this
self reliant man...

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,542
from mastering the
art of cooking.

36
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,083
Traditional Indian cuisines...

37
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,625
To Italian, Mexican cuisines...

38
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,292
Chef, the food is superb.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,917
Varun is one of the best
visually challenged chefs...

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop... stop

41
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,125
I feel shy to hear my
own success story.

42
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,500
Will you please keep
the book and leave?

43
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,792
You are taunting me too much.

44
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,833
Bye.

45
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:44,917
Thank you.

46
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,667
Don't mention.

47
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,083
Rhino!
Bake it.

48
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,708
Who is it?

49
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,667
Is the restaurant closed?

50
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,375
Yes.

51
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,375
Sorry. The closing
time is 10:30 PM.

52
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,750
An elderly man on the platform
told that he was hungry.

53
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,000
He asked me if he can
have something to eat.

54
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,375
There is no other hotel nearby.
That's why...

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Please wait.

56
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,458
Let me check.

57
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,875
Somehow I managed this
with the leftovers.

58
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,208
Take it.

59
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,250
Sorry for disturbing you...
I didn't know about your condition.

60
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,042
Nothing to sympathize.

61
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:54,542
This is my restaurant.

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,750
This is my job.

63
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,667
Okay.
Thanks.

64
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,042
You can visit the elderly
man if you would like to.

65
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,500
He is nearby.

66
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,833
Hang on.

67
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,292
Let me close the restaurant.

68
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,333
He is here.

69
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,708
Take it.

70
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:18,625
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,625
I'll leave.

72
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,750
Shall I drop you somewhere?

73
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:25,708
Thanks.

74
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,917
I've a knowledge of every
nook and corner of this locality.

75
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,458
Bye.

76
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,042
Your article by Sadhana
is very good, isn't it?

77
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,750
It requires a big heart
to appreciate you- Mom.

78
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,875
Get me chappathis.

79
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,292
Despite owning a restaurant

80
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,875
You are still eating mom's food.

81
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,333
I know where this
conversation will end.

82
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,083
Don't be boring.
Okay?

83
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:15,792
Welcome.

84
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,167
Did the elderly man ask
for food, today as well?

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
No.

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,125
But, how did you know
that it was me?

87
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:26,958
Your deodorant brand
is Nivea, right?

88
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,583
You are awesome.

89
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,208
I forgot
to pay the bill, yesterday.

90
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,458
How much was it?
- It's Okay.

91
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,792
If I get the money

92
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,250
The credit for the good
deeds will go to you.

93
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,208
No need.
Sorry.

94
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,333
How about getting
some credits today?

95
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,458
You told that the elderly
man didn't ask for food.

96
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,292
It's not a big deal to find
a hungry man in our city.

97
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:56,792
One moment.

98
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,458
I'm Deepa.

99
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,083
I work in a clothing store
in a shopping mall.

100
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,875
I'm Varun.

101
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,083
Cutting, baking, boiling
and frying things.

102
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,125
This is my profession.

103
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,125
Did you just extend your hand?

104
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,792
What?

105
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,000
For an introduction?

106
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
No.

107
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,042
Sorry.
I forget this all the time!

108
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,583
It's okay.

109
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,375
No.
Let's start from the beginning.

110
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:32,917
Hi, I'm Varun.

111
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,167
Deepa.

112
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,125
Varun...

113
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,500
Excuse me.

114
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,875
Have it.
- Thank you very much.

115
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,875
Shall we leave?

116
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:54,083
Here... With no control

117
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:59,250
Somehow, I am becoming you.

118
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,333
Without the eyes laying sight...

119
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:12,083
I am becoming like you.

120
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:17,500
The fiber of my life
shines colorfully.

121
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:23,708
While killing me with fondness...

122
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,125
Love is getting kindled...

123
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,958
Sight is going beyond the eyes.

124
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,000
(Are you) The flower of
inner sun, or my penance?

125
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,417
Is this love or enemity?

126
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,625
Hey, love has become my eyes...

127
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,292
And is withholding your beauty.

128
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,417
Your fragrance has become my way

129
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,792
And brings me closer to you.

130
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,125
A storm is galloping
like a horse...

131
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,792
And my heart has climbed
aboard and vanished.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,917
Even robbery becomes just...

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,917
When my wish steals you away.

134
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,500
Where is your father?
Has he absconded?

135
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,833
He isn't picking my calls.

136
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,000
He can't run away from us.

137
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,417
If he doesn't meet us tomorrow

138
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,250
Things may turn ugly.
- Who's that, Deepa?

139
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,875
Someone I know.

140
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,958
Any problem, Deepa?

141
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,458
No.
Nothing.

142
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:26,708
Are you the woman past desires,
The one ruling all my desires?

143
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:33,500
Are you the one to rope the
moon in your forehead?

144
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,708
You became the enchanted forest
in one single flower, my lady

145
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:44,917
Are you the one to pour
nectar on that day?

146
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,375
The thought of you approaches
me and burns my soul.

147
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,792
I lost my loneliness.
I lost myself in your thoughts.

148
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,792
You are my companion.

149
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,667
I like Varun a lot.

150
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,708
But he will tease if I tell him.

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,542
Which is why...

152
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,958
You are a friend who
knows him well.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,167
He will not get a better
partner than you.

154
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,792
A storm is galloping
like a horse...

155
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,458
And my heart has climbed
aboard and vanished.

156
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,583
Even robbery becomes just...

157
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,583
When my wish steals you away.

158
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,375
Hey, love has become my eyes...

159
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,042
And is withholding your beauty.

160
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,125
Your fragrance has become my way

161
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,542
And brings me closer to you.

162
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,708
Siri, time?

163
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,542
Siri, call Deepa.

164
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Hi, Deepa.

165
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:03,792
I'm waiting for you.

166
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,125
Where are you?

167
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,583
'Sadhana Calling'.

168
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,625
Deepa.

169
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,292
What happened?

170
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,792
Is something wrong?

171
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,625
I can help you only
if you tell me.

172
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,292
Please, Deepa.
Tell me. What's it?

173
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,875
My sister fell in
love with a guy.

174
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,833
His family is quite well off.

175
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,083
But, they still
accepted their wedding.

176
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,958
Since it was my sister's wish...

177
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,583
My father spent more
than he could afford

178
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,750
He got her married
in a grand way.

179
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,208
She is happy with her life.

180
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,792
But she forgot us.

181
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,500
The money we had borrowed
for the wedding...

182
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,708
led us...

183
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,083
into endless troubles.

184
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,917
To help my dad,

185
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,833
I started working.

186
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,708
Even after 2 years

187
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,292
We couldn't clear even
a chunk of the loan.

188
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,000
Dealing with the money-lenders
has become

189
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:47,958
a struggle of our daily life.

190
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,375
But...

191
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,417
Today...

192
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,708
Today?

193
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,750
Some thugs came home...

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,458
and insulted us very badly.

195
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,375
They said... If you
can't repay the loan,

196
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,292
Ask your daughter to...

197
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,458
Unable to hear such
things, my dad...

198
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,042
In a haste...

199
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:18,125
He promised to clear the loan...

200
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,708
in 2 days.

201
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,042
I surely know that
it's not possible.

202
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,583
Either...

203
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,625
We leave the city.

204
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,833
Or...

205
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,458
My family should...

206
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,208
Don't be foolish, Deepa.

207
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,708
Even the man with a million rupees
on loan is sitting happily.

208
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,292
Please, Varun!

209
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,667
You could have asked me.

210
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,583
No.

211
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,333
I just felt like
sharing it with you.

212
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,750
So, I did.

213
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,500
I have some savings.

214
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,208
I don't have immediate
expenses lined up.

215
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,625
I will lend it to you.
- Please.

216
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:08,792
Don't Varun.

217
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,667
You are the only friend
that I have left.

218
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,458
I don't want your name in
the moneylender's list.

219
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,708
Forget this issue.

220
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,625
Also ask your dad not to borrow
any money for your wedding.

221
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,208
Because I have no
demands from my side.

222
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,958
Don't get me wrong that I'm...

223
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,000
taking advantage
of your situation.

224
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,125
I was actually waiting
for you today...

225
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,333
To propose.

226
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,750
All these arrangements
were meant for that.

227
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:46,292
Deepa.

228
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,583
I'm visually challenged.

229
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,042
If that's the reason for your silence...

230
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,875
You can tell me frankly.

231
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,583
We can drop this right now.

232
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,875
And remain friends.

233
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,250
Other than that...

234
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,083
There can be no reason
for rejecting me.

235
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,458
Because...

236
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,708
I'm handsome...

237
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,042
Charming...

238
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,208
I know it myself.

239
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:07,958
Hey!

240
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,458
You did laugh, didn't you?

241
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,042
I didn't.

242
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,292
Don't you think that we have
reached here a bit early today?

243
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,583
Don't play around, Varun.
It's getting late.

244
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,708
It's not fair to
leave me halfway.

245
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,042
I'm going to be with you
throughout my life.

246
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,667
Okay, bye.

247
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,208
Won't you send me off with a kiss?
- Here?!

248
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,583
No.

249
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Here.

250
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,667
Bye.

251
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:35,917
Deepa.

252
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,250
Say hello to my father-in-law!

253
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,083
Severe head injury.

254
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
But now he is alright.

255
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,917
Since he is under
heavy medications

256
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,417
It may take a few days for
him to gain consciousness.

257
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,250
Let him stay in the
hospital till then.

258
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,000
He will recover soon.

259
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,458
Thanks, doctor.

260
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,333
At what age did your
son lose his eyesight?

261
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,083
When he was 15.

262
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,458
All of a sudden he
had a high fever.

263
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,542
It continued for 2 weeks.

264
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,250
He started losing
his vision slowly.

265
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,125
Doctors diagnosed him with...

266
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,958
Retinitis pigmentosa,
a degenerative eye disease.

267
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,792
But none of those
treatments helped.

268
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,208
We checked his eyes now

269
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,958
His retina is
responding to light.

270
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:52,917
The ophthalmologist will be
visiting tomorrow.

271
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,833
Let's see what he has to say.

272
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,167
Varun has light perception.

273
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,208
Surgery may help him
get his vision back.

274
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,000
So...
- There's nothing to think about, doctor.

275
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,833
If Varun can get his sight back...

276
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,625
We will manage any expense.

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,458
Please go on and make necessary
arrangements. - Sure.

278
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,625
What's wrong with you?

279
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,667
I know what I'm doing.

280
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,042
The way my son saw
me before 10 years

281
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,583
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.

282
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,292
He will cry out asking
if this is what he got his vision back for!

283
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,458
You are jealous.

284
00:18:57,792 --> 00:19:00,000
He wonâ€™t even be able to identify you.

285
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,625
Shall I stick a mustache?

286
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,542
Mom!

287
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,167
Mom!
- Sir.

288
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,458
Please sit.

289
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,958
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?

290
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,375
She will be here.
- Who are you?

291
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,583
Varun!
- Mom!

292
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,042
Where were you?

293
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,667
I have no clue.
What is happening?

294
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,917
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,458
You met with an accident.

296
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,292
Varun, please don't strain.

297
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,750
Be calm.

298
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,667
You were hit by a car while
getting back from the restaurant.

299
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,750
How long have I been kept here?

300
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,208
It's been 3 weeks.

301
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:33,958
What?!

302
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,583
Stay calm.
You are alright now.

303
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,417
In fact there is a
surprising.

304
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,042
Youâ€™ve had an eye surgery.

305
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
You are going to get your sight back!

306
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,833
Your bandages will be
removed today.

307
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,583
Can you please be clear?
- Doctor is here.

308
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,292
What is he saying?

309
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,875
He has isnâ€™t able to
understand whatâ€™s happening.

310
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,083
He is tensed.

311
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,875
Nothing to worry, Mr.Varun.

312
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,917
You are absolutely fine.
Just relax.

313
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,583
Open your eyes, slowly.

314
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,208
Varun, give it a try.

315
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,833
Slowly...

316
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,083
Try...

317
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:22,917
Are you able to see?

318
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,958
Can you see?

319
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,042
One.

320
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,958
Two.
- Yes!

321
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,750
Varun!

322
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,208
I was scared!

323
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,458
Let him take rest.
I'll come back later.

324
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,625
It's Sadhana.

325
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,708
Mom.

326
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,125
Did anyone come to visit me?

327
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,708
who do you mean?

328
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,083
We are all here.

329
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,542
My friend.

330
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,958
Which friend?

331
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,500
Did anyone by the
name Deepa visit me?

332
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,250
Deepa?

333
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,625
No. No one like that had come.

334
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,583
Where is my phone?

335
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,958
Did she call me?

336
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,333
I need to talk to
her immediately.

337
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,333
I'll leave.

338
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,583
Sadhana, wait.
Where are you going?

339
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:51,333
He is asking about
someone called Deepa.

340
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,167
I asked for my phone.

341
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,625
I need to talk to
Deepa immediately.

342
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,542
I need to see her.

343
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:57,542
What is this?

344
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,792
Sadhana was the one
who took care of you.

345
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,292
You didn't even talk to her.

346
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,083
I will talk to her, later.

347
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,917
I need to talk to
Deepa now.

348
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,042
Will you give my phone?

349
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,208
What do you think you are doing?

350
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,500
We have been praying
for your recovery...

351
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,792
We have spent a lot
of money and waited.

352
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,625
You must be happy for
getting your vision back.

353
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,125
You are reciting someone random womanâ€™s name!
- What did you say?

354
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,083
What?
- You spent what?

355
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,417
Yes, we spent a lot of money.
So, what?

356
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,167
How much?

357
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,333
Why do you want to know?

358
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,208
Just tell me.

359
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,167
Apart from our savings,
we have borrowed some.

360
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,792
Varun!
- Varun, stop!

361
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,083
Your eyes are very
sensitive to light now.

362
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,958
It will take some time to get
used to excessive light.

363
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,583
You will have to use spectacles.
- Okay, doctor.

364
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,750
'Calling Deepa'.

365
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:05,000
Varun.

366
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:06,792
Think practically.

367
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,875
You say that she used to come
to the restaurant everyday.

368
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,625
But you don't know
what she looks like.

369
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,917
You neither have her
photo nor her address.

370
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,542
How do we search for her?

371
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:19,083
I promised to help her.

372
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:21,083
She must have pinned
her hopes on me.

373
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,417
Would she have any idea
about my accident?

374
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,333
She would have thought
that I had cheated her.

375
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,708
There is no wrong
from your side.

376
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,875
Don't think too much.

377
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,292
Varun.

378
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,042
Excuse me. Do you remember the
girl who used to come with me?

379
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,750
Everyday I see lot of people.

380
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,208
Thank you.

381
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,375
Tell me if you see her.

382
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,625
No idea.

383
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,042
Is there any employee
named Deepa?

384
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,750
No one here.

385
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,000
Any news of a suicide
due to debts?

386
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,917
Deepa, say hello to my father-in-law.

387
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,167
Lets go.

388
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,083
Varun.

389
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,250
Varun, look at me.

390
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,125
I have never seen you so down.

391
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,125
Please don't be like this.

392
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,458
You won't understand, Sadhana.

393
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,583
Forget it.

394
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,750
Don't say that!

395
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,667
I know you very well.

396
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,375
We have been friends for 7 years now.

397
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,000
I know how youâ€™d feel even
without you telling it to me.

398
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,042
And in the same way...

399
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,125
I hope you can understand
how I'm feeling.

400
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,375
Varun.

401
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,708
Shall we lodge a
police complaint?

402
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,708
No, dad.
It will create more problems.

403
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:44,000
Damodharan, from Chetpet, and his family,
commits suicide owing to mounting pressure from debts.

404
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:48,083
Damodharan, his wife Pushpa, and
14-year-old son Aravindh...

405
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:51,375
committed suicide by consuming poison today.
The police are investigating the incident.

406
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,708
The locked house...

407
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,167
Mom.

408
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,792
Look at me.

409
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,125
Please.

410
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Mom.

411
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,083
I don't like to see you being
upset because of me.

412
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,000
Getting back your
vision is a big thing.

413
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:40,917
You must be very happy.

414
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,375
Instead...

415
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:45,792
Why are you upset like this
about this random girl?

416
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I know, my fault.

417
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,208
Sorry.

418
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:50,833
Now, please smile for me.

419
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,667
I'm telling you again...

420
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,583
Sadhana is deeply
in love with you.

421
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,000
When you were hospitalised...

422
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,583
I know.

423
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I will talk to her.

424
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,250
What I meant is...

425
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,708
More than the one we love...

426
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,542
The one whom we love...

427
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,708
The one who loves us...
No, no...

428
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,792
Itâ€™s okay.
Leave it, mom.

429
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,333
I get the point.

430
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:33,208
Have a seat, Sadhana.

431
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,250
Will you like to have anything?

432
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:50,167
Donâ€™t suddenly flip into a
totally different person.

433
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,792
Be normal.
Only that suits you.

434
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,833
Okay.

435
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,250
I have to tell you the truth.

436
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,875
Since you were coming,
I didnâ€™t even use room freshener.

437
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,417
Okay.
Let me get to the point.

438
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:10,083
If you still love her,
I totally understand.

439
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:14,042
Don't take any decision just
because your parents are forcing you.

440
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,250
You donâ€™t have to tell me 'you like me'
just because someone is asking you to.

441
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,708
Will it be okay if
it comes from me?

442
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,708
It's not like I have to like
you with an effort now.

443
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,792
Iâ€™ve always liked you.

444
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,750
But I never felt that
you could be the one for me.

445
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:41,583
But now that I think of
it, it all makes sense.

446
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,500
I like you, Sadhana.

447
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,250
Really?

448
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,875
A small word said in passing...

449
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:10,000
It is chilly, it is true, listen.

450
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,458
You added sweetness
to what you spoke.

451
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:17,583
My feminity is stunned.

452
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:21,583
Should I blush away?

453
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,833
Or climb up high to
touch the clouds?

454
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:29,125
Should I yearn even more

455
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:32,458
Or look for more words to speak?

456
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:36,417
With the wishes as a garland...

457
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,833
Shall I go around
you all day long?

458
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,375
A small word said in passing

459
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,375
It is chilly, it is true, listen

460
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,083
You added sweetness
to what you spoke

461
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,708
My masculinity is stunned.

462
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,792
Should I say slowly

463
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,792
Or increase the speed?

464
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:32,250
Should I leave after saying
or pause right there?

465
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,875
Should I pinch at the
love that was said

466
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,667
Or should I lose myself to the
love that was grabbed by my hands

467
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,458
I realize today
that there may be a

468
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,375
thousand changes to the sight.

469
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,167
I see myself through

470
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,917
your eyes conveying love.

471
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,750
I am seeing you with a pouring love...

472
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,542
that I have collected.

473
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:30,542
I am gently bringing to your ears

474
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:34,083
the words I collected slowly.

475
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:37,917
I put my hands out
to get a raindrop...

476
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:41,542
It remained just as a drizzle.

477
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:45,500
Today, you are a
downpour from up above...

478
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,792
that drenches all my heart.

479
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,542
A small word said in passing...

480
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,667
It is chilly, it is true, listen.

481
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,125
You added sweetness
to what you spoke.

482
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:04,250
My feminity is stunned.

483
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,250
Should I blush away?

484
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Or climb up high to
touch the clouds?

485
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,333
Should I yearn even more

486
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,667
Or look for more words to speak?

487
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,625
With the wishes as a garland...

488
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,042
Shall I go around
you all day long?

489
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,750
Rhino.

490
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,750
I'll close the restaurant.

491
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,208
Mom wants you home; you leave.

492
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,250
Okay.

493
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,875
Sorry, sir.
We are closed.

494
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,542
Someone named Varun...

495
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,625
I'm Varun.
And you are?

496
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,000
Your eyesight?

497
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,750
I had lost it earlier.

498
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,458
After a surgery now...

499
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,417
Sir, who are you?

500
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,042
Do you remember Deepa?

501
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,708
Sir!

502
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,458
I'm her father.

503
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:16,417
Why did you let us down like that!

504
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,375
Sir, what do you mean?

505
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,208
Didn't Deepa come now?

506
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,667
Where is Deepa?

507
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,167
She told us happily that you
offered to help us with the money,

508
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,125
that all our problems
will go away...

509
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,250
She sounded so happy...

510
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,625
But you were seen no where.

511
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,500
I kept telling her we
should leave the city.

512
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,167
But she did not listen.

513
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,667
She was confident
that you would come back...

514
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,750
and asked me to wait.

515
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,000
How many days do
we give excuses?

516
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The moneylenders

517
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,875
have kidnapped my daughter.

518
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,708
They are threatening
to kill my daughter

519
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,125
If we don't clear all our debts.

520
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:55,375
What do you mean?

521
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,000
I want my daughter back.

522
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:58,833
Alive.

523
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,208
Alive.
- Sir...

524
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,583
Please get up.

525
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Please.

526
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,167
Don't cry.

527
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:08,833
We will rescue Deepa for sure.

528
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,875
They are very dangerous people.

529
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
If we go to the police...

530
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,167
They will not think twice
to kill my daughter.

531
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,042
Nothing of that
sort will happen.

532
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,542
Give me a day's time.

533
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,875
Please.

534
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,125
Come.

535
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:35,292
Have a seat.

536
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,083
How much do you owe them now?

537
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,708
Going to have your morning
coffee with Sadhana?

538
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,208
I have to invite my close friend.

539
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,708
I will be able to meet him
only if I go now. So...

540
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:06,417
Bye.

541
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,833
Hello.

542
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,625
Okay.

543
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,125
He asked me to come in.

544
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,208
My daughter!
- Stop!

545
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,375
Don't hurt her.

546
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,625
Have you brought the money?

547
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,208
Who is that?!

548
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:40,708
Who is the that?!

549
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,083
He is someone I know.

550
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,083
Just give him the money.

551
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,375
They might hurt her.

552
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,208
Give it to him.
- How much have you brought?

553
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,250
How much?
- Itâ€™s not cash.

554
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:51,458
It's jewellery.

555
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,583
Jewellery?

556
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,708
Are you mocking me?

557
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,750
I asked for cash.

558
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,917
Are you trying to trap
me with the jewels?

559
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,458
Oldie, looks like you don't
want your daughter back alive!

560
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,458
Leave her!

561
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:03,625
Time out!

562
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,958
Collect her pieces and go!

563
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,125
The jewels are worth
more than the money they owe you!

564
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,708
Don't rush.

565
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,875
Let her go!
Please!

566
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:16,042
Take it and leave her!

567
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:18,750
Don't hurt my daughter!

568
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,083
Let her go!

569
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,375
Deepa!

570
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:14,250
Had you given the money,
you wouldâ€™ve saved a life.

571
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,667
Trying to be a hero, are you?

572
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:19,833
Go to hell!

573
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,167
You moron,
I'll kill you!

574
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,667
If you even think of
going to the police...

575
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:44,708
You will be inviting
trouble for yourself.

576
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:53,958
Deepa.

577
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,375
Varun...

578
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,167
Varun...
Stop.

579
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,375
What happened?

580
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,750
Where were you?

581
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,083
What happened?

582
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,625
Every last piece of gold jewellery
bought for the wedding is missing!

583
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,958
I called you N number of times.

584
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,042
Aunt told that you left
the house this morning with a bag.

585
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,333
All the jewels are missing.

586
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,833
And you turn up like this now!

587
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:11,333
What happened?

588
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,750
Mom...

589
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,750
Deepa...
- Her again?

590
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,708
Why bring her up again?

591
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,417
What happened?

592
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,833
Deepa's dad met me yesterday.

593
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:27,667
He said Deepa was kidnapped
and asked for my help. So...

594
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,042
So, I took the
jewels to save her.

595
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,042
But everything went wrong.

596
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,542
They looted the jewels...
- What?!

597
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,792
I couldn't save Deepa either.

598
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:42,667
If you can't forget her.

599
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:46,167
If you are so attached to her.
Why am I even here?

600
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,000
Why is this wedding happening?

601
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:49,625
Sadhana, please.

602
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,500
I did ask you.

603
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,875
If you werenâ€™t able to forget her,
I was ready to step away.

604
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,042
You kept nodding your head and
expressing interests in me,

605
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,458
and now you are after her.

606
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,708
You took the wedding chain
as well, didnâ€™t you?

607
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:05,375
Had you saved her,
Would you tied it around her neck and married her?

608
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,667
Mom, ask her to keep quiet.

609
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:09,875
Why should I stay quiet?

610
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,375
Sadhana, be calm.

611
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:13,875
Itâ€™s not necessary anymore.

612
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,375
I will leave.

613
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,375
I'm not ready to
get mislead by him any further.

614
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,750
I'm sorry, aunt.

615
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,958
I don't want this wedding.
- Sadhana!

616
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:22,167
Mom, let's go.

617
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,083
'Who? What? When?'

618
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,458
'Swathi was hanging out
with her friends'.

619
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,917
'2 twilight thieves arrested.'

620
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,250
Sadhana.

621
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,750
Sadhana.

622
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,083
Is the article ready?

623
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,375
I want to take off for 10 days.

624
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,083
Leave for 10 days?

625
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,208
You people are hopeless!

626
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,125
If you think of going to the police...
You are inviting trouble for yourself!

627
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,125
I'm hungry.
Please help me.

628
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:19,167
Sorry.

629
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,750
Don't run!
Catch him!

630
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:31,667
Stop there.

631
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,292
Yesterday night, on the Kanyakumari-
Nagercoil highway...

632
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,167
a man was found dead after being hit
by an unidentified vehicle.

633
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,333
His age is presumed
to be about 50.

634
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:52,375
As we had asked Inspector
Arivazhagan of Kanyakumari...

635
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,250
A man who was walking on the
highway was hit by a vehicle

636
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,083
and died on the spot.

637
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,542
The man had no identity
card or phone on him.

638
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:01,958
So we were unable
to get his details.

639
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,417
Investigation is going on now.

640
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:08,292
Those who know any detail about him can
approach the Kanyakumari police station.

641
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,583
I'm going to Kanyakumari
for an urgent work.

642
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,667
I'll call once I'm done with it.
Inform dad.

643
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,583
Stop!
Why are you going?

644
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,750
A man was found dead in the
Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.

645
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:41,542
Either we run
away from the city,

646
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:45,125
Or the whole family...

647
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,000
Why are you so worried after
coming to Kanyakumari?

648
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,250
Any problem?

649
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,375
You said wanted to visit
police station as well?

650
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Nothing.

651
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,917
I'm going to meet my friend.

652
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:20,792
Sir.

653
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,042
Yes.
- I'm from Chennai.

654
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:27,250
2 days ago, a man was found dead
in a road accident in Kanyakumari.

655
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,583
Yes.
How do you know him?

656
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:31,917
Actually...

657
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,625
Then why do you want
to know about him?

658
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,417
Sir, I'm from the media.

659
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,792
You guys want news 24/7!

660
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:40,958
Why do you torture us for that?

661
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,167
There is a guy called Panju.

662
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,250
He is dealing with this case.
Go meet him.

663
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Thank you, sir.

664
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,000
Give him the keys.

665
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,375
Don't drink and drive.

666
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:56,750
Got it?
- Okay, sir.

667
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,125
Sorry, sir.
- Bye.

668
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,833
He is a relative of the MLA.

669
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,250
Won't you enquire all
these things in advance?

670
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,250
I will be careful
hereafter,Sir.

671
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:09,125
Have you caught a single
proper case till now?

672
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,042
It doesn't make a
difference either wayâ€¦

673
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,542
It's my mistake to
have become a cop.

674
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,542
Donâ€™t go and drag another problematic case
just because I said this now.

675
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,000
Get a case that will bring
honours to the station and me.

676
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,208
Bring something that brings
cheers to me and the station.

677
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:23,917
Definitely, sir.

678
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:28,333
You will repent for all these.

679
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Sir,
I am waiting for you.

680
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,667
Who are you?
- I'm Varun.

681
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,125
I'm a program producer in Q TV.

682
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,667
You would have heard about the show.
â€˜Crime: Why? What? When?'

683
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:40,792
No, I haven't.

684
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,583
A very important thing.

685
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,042
Perumal, one strong tea.

686
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,625
Sir, tea.

687
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,292
Yes.
- Sir.

688
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,083
A guy was found dead in a road accident in
Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway recently...

689
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,000
I want some details
regarding that case.

690
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:02,625
Why do you want to know?

691
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,333
I'm working on a program about unsolved
death cases caused by road accidents.

692
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:08,500
Did anyone come in search of this man?

693
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,500
In some cases, people
come searching immediately.

694
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:15,250
At other times, they come a bit late.

695
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:16,875
But no one has come in
search of this man so far.

696
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,375
What about his body?

697
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:21,167
We are done with postmortem
and other formalities.

698
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:23,708
Won't you wait till someone
comes to identify the person?

699
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:27,958
There is neither a mortuary big enough nor
the Government funds large enough to do that.

700
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:31,167
If no one comes in search of the dead
person, we proceed with the formalities.

701
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:34,417
If anyone comes after that,
we will verify with a photo.

702
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:36,542
If we have any of their belongings,
we return them. That's it.

703
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,292
Perumal, add this to
my outstanding credit.

704
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,167
Your credit amount
is never settled.

705
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,333
Sir, won't you enquire
about the vehicle driver?

706
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:49,292
It's possible only with
camera surveillance.

707
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,917
If no one comes in
search of themâ€¦

708
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:53,750
We will cross-check with other
police stations for 'person missing' cases.

709
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,000
Or else, we mark it as an unidentified
man dead in a hit-and-run incident,

710
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,458
and close the case.

711
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,250
Sir.

712
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,083
This is the concept
of our program.

713
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,792
To find out who these unidentified
dead people in these accidents are,

714
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:06,250
and to find the culprit
behind these incidents.

715
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,500
Congratulations.

716
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,708
You have come to
the right place.

717
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,333
You will get all the details that you need.
- Sir.

718
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,167
I'm sure you
are going to find it all here.

719
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,125
You are the hero of
our program. - Hey.

720
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,833
I'm already fed
up with this job.

721
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,833
Don't irritate me.
Get lost.

722
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:23,125
Please.
Have some patience.

723
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,875
Such road accidents
are very high in number.

724
00:46:26,042 --> 00:46:29,083
Many cases get closed without
finding any details about the victim.

725
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:29,875
As you mentioned...

726
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,875
There is neither the time nor
the funds from the Government.

727
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:36,792
But there will be at least one
person bothered about the dead guy.

728
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:38,917
We have to find that person...

729
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,417
And make sure the
information reaches them.

730
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,042
This is the concept
of our program.

731
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:43,792
It has an emotional content.

732
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,417
Give it a thought.

733
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:47,958
Think about it.

734
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:51,250
It's my mistake to have had a
tea without getting you one.

735
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:53,042
Have a tea in my credit.
Perumalâ€¦

736
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:53,875
Sir.

737
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,417
If this program becomes a hit,

738
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:57,833
your photo will become
viral on social media.

739
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,042
People will praise you
as the ideal cop.

740
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,458
After whichâ€¦ promotion, salary hikeâ€¦
- Get lost.

741
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:04,417
Panju Sir!

742
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,083
Panju Sir!

743
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,708
How long will you be an underdog?
When will you rise to occasion?

744
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,250
I'm going to pee.
Step aside.

745
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:20,833
Sir.

746
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:22,833
Okay, Sir.

747
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,333
Greetings.

748
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,708
Inspector asked to come here.

749
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:32,417
Didn't you bring your gun?

750
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,250
I wonder how you will manage without it!

751
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:37,958
Go upstairs.

752
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Hey, crow!

753
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,708
Perumal, one strong tea.

754
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,208
Make it two.
- Okay, Sir.

755
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:46,958
What's up, Sir?

756
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,583
Would you like to have
any fried snacks?

757
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:51,792
No tension!

758
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,708
I gave an idea to
change your image altogether.

759
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,250
Now it's upto you.

760
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:00,417
I'm scared of the risk involved.

761
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:02,542
Moreover, it's a TV programâ€¦

762
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,583
What's the risk?

763
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,875
You are a cop
investigating a case.

764
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:09,000
As a TV channel, we will support you.

765
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,500
If everything falls in placeâ€¦

766
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:11,667
We will get the content.

767
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:12,875
And youâ€¦

768
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:15,708
will get the respect and dignity from the
public, that is missing at the police station.

769
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,792
Only you have come here.

770
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:24,875
What about the rest of the crew?

771
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:28,417
Initially, I will read the case thoroughly.

772
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,458
I'll then deeply investigate it.

773
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:33,083
The crew will then arrive.

774
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,667
Perumal, make a note in
Sir's credit list.

775
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,625
Didn't the victim have any sort
of ID or visiting card on him?

776
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,875
Had it been there, you
wouldn't have had to come here.

777
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:52,708
This is a tourist spot.

778
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,583
Was the victim a tourist?

779
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,083
Was he on an official trip?

780
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,708
Or he was just trespassing?

781
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,875
Was it a death by accident?

782
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,250
Or did it he commit suicide?

783
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:03,417
I have no clue.

784
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,542
No local person was
able to identify him.

785
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:09,125
One thing is for sure.
You are real serious about this case now.

786
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:14,333
You seem to trust me.

787
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,208
I'll solve this
case just for that.

788
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,042
Madam.

789
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,208
Take this.

790
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,458
â€˜Catch if he drinksâ€™ app has
been installed in it.

791
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:29,208
If your husband
drinks alcohol in a local wine shop,

792
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:30,875
or anywhere else,

793
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:31,958
the app will send you a text.

794
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,667
Yes.
Okay?

795
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,667
There he is.

796
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,375
I'm coming to get you!

797
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,250
Reserve a special cell for me.

798
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,042
I'll be right back after
stabbing him!

799
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,208
Poor husband.

800
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,542
Can one man be the reason
for destroying another?

801
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,583
The curse of husbands
will not spare you.

802
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,958
Be careful.
- It's okay.

803
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,542
Is the inspector's phone ready?

804
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:56,917
It is ready.
- Give it.

805
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,833
Do you know the old
actor 'Bagavathar'?

806
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,708
Yes.
- This is belongs his era.

807
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,625
Why is he still using it?

808
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:05,542
May be he has his
sentiments about it.

809
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,750
We can fix that then.

810
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:09,083
Iâ€™ll fix wifi, bluetooth,
and all features in this.

811
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,208
Why would you do that!

812
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:14,167
So he can track all my
activities and be a pain?

813
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,542
Give me the phone.
Get the money from him.

814
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:19,083
If the phone conks off again,

815
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,708
take it to the museum.

816
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,250
Please don't bring it to my shop.

817
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:24,125
I'll pass the message
to the inspector.

818
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,208
Panju, if the victim
was an outsider,

819
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,375
He should have stayed
in a hotel or at a lodge.

820
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:32,708
Why donâ€™t we enquire there.

821
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,208
I now know why we seem
to set well together.

822
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:39,917
You speak my mind.

823
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,250
Well done.
Come on.

824
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:46,208
An enquiry.
- Yes, Sir.

825
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,292
Before 18th of Septemberâ€¦

826
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,375
Did this guy stay here?

827
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:51,833
No, Sir.

828
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:53,708
Are you sure? Or do you want
confirm with someone else?

829
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,208
I'm sure.

830
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:56,458
He is not our guest.

831
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,667
Panju, this is where I stay.

832
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:12,458
Please come.

833
00:52:12,792 --> 00:52:13,792
Do you know him?

834
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:15,958
No.

835
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,958
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.

836
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,167
I'm sure that he
didn't stay here.

837
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,625
How are you so sure?

838
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,875
I never forget any guestâ€™s face.

839
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:27,583
I can even remember a guest
who stayed with us 10 years ago.

840
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:29,833
Do you know him?

841
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:32,375
No.

842
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,708
Give the key for room number 205.

843
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:36,250
Why?

844
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,750
He is staying here.

845
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,208
Give the key.

846
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,250
We are investigating
trusting people like this!

847
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,625
Come.

848
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,042
He was staying here for a while.

849
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,375
What happened to him?

850
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:57,958
Don't bother about it.

851
00:52:58,042 --> 00:52:59,083
Since when was he staying here?

852
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,750
They vacated last week.

853
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:03,042
THEY vacated?
How many people?

854
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:04,958
This guy, and another man with you.

855
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:08,583
What was the other manâ€™s age?
- Probably within 30.

856
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:10,667
Take the register and
look for the entry.

857
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:18,417
Here.

858
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:21,792
This one?

859
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:26,583
SIRI, call.

860
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,042
98942-83-834.

861
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:46,375
The phone number, address, and other
information from the lodge are fake.

862
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,750
The number is registered
on a fake companyâ€™s name.

863
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,542
They have been using
it illegally.

864
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,667
The SIM had been
active till his death.

865
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Now it's not in use.

866
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,833
What about the incoming
and outgoing call details?

867
00:53:58,417 --> 00:53:59,542
Not too many calls.

868
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,833
But there are repeated
calls from a number.

869
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,083
The number that ends with 333.

870
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,333
I enquired about that as well.

871
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,875
That's also illegal.
Not in use.

872
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:08,667
Did you get information about
the other guy in the lodge?

873
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,333
We didn't get enough
details about him.

874
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,708
There is just one window
open for investigation now.

875
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,958
We have to find the
one who killed him in the accident.

876
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:20,583
Our program's main concept is to find
information about the unidentified dead people.

877
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:21,833
We can enquire about the rest later.

878
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,375
Looks like I often have to
remind you whoâ€™s the cop.

879
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:29,500
I'm the deciding authority here.

880
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,667
But finding the vehicle involved in
the accident is also is a tough taskâ€¦

881
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,125
Exactly.

882
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,250
Come with me.

883
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:37,583
Based on the postmortem report,
the impact suggests thatâ€¦

884
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:40,000
it's clear that the vehicle
involved in the accident is a car.

885
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,625
There were shattered glass pieces all over.

886
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:45,667
That must be of the car's windshield.

887
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,125
If it was an outsider, he couldn't
have left the town without changing it.

888
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:50,958
The same applies to a local person as well.

889
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,500
What if it was a local personâ€¦

890
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,333
And he has his car hidden without
changing the windshield?

891
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:57,375
Okay, you leave.

892
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,167
Investigate this case
in your pattern.

893
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:01,125
Or try a cookery show instead.

894
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,250
Don't ask for my help.
- Sir, chillâ€¦

895
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,750
I was just giving an opinion.

896
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,708
You are the leader
of this case.

897
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,333
Forget about it.
Tell me about the next step.

898
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:12,708
Start the bike.

899
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,500
What?

900
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,583
I don't know to ride a bike.

901
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,375
I have to do that as well?

902
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:29,667
Greetings, Sir.
Greetings.

903
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:33,458
I want all the details of windshield repairs
that have been done since the 18th.

904
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:34,625
Okay, Sir.
I'll check it.

905
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:37,792
Also I need the address
of nearby workshops.

906
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:38,958
Okay, Sir.

907
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:46,458
List of people who had
changed the wind shield.

908
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,500
Yes, Sir.

909
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:48,667
Yes, it was an accident.

910
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,792
A coconut fell from the tree

911
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:53,500
at full speed and shattered the glass.

912
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,333
Repair cost me 4000 rupees.

913
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,542
This car?

914
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,250
Did you replace a damaged windshield?
- Yes.

915
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,750
How did it get damaged?

916
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,708
Some kids broke it
while playing cricket on the streets.

917
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,750
Mohan.
- Welcome, Sir.

918
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:13,500
I want the details of those
who have changed windshields.

919
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:16,458
Here it is, Sir.

920
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:19,333
A car from Dindigul has been
here for a windshield change.

921
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:21,542
Let's enquire.

922
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:22,792
This is the number.

923
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:26,292
Siri, callâ€¦

924
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,708
I'm dead serious in the middle of this,

925
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:32,500
You are always poking the phone
in my face saying â€˜Siriâ€¦â€™

926
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:34,542
Can't you even dial a number?

927
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,458
Sorry, Sir.
Iâ€™m used to it.

928
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,000
Yes, a minor accident.

929
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,083
So I changed the windshield.

930
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:44,375
I had even filed an FIR to claim
insurance.

931
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,458
Do you want the FIR number?

932
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:46,833
It's okay.

933
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,042
Not necessary.
Thanks.

934
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,500
Are we taking the right path?

935
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:52,292
Only some places are left.

936
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:54,125
Let's hope for the best.
Come.

937
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:45,667
Panju.

938
00:57:58,542 --> 00:57:59,250
Who is it?

939
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Manoj?

940
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,208
Yes.

941
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:03,542
Yes, thatâ€™s me.
And you are?

942
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:05,833
We are coming from Kanyakumari
police station.

943
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:07,333
We want some details.

944
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:12,042
Is there a problem?

945
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:13,792
Shall we talk inside?

946
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:16,875
Okay, come in.

947
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:32,500
Who has kept this here?
- Don't change it's positionâ€¦

948
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,750
If you change it, he
will get hurt later.

949
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:37,875
Thanks.
And you are?

950
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:42,458
He has come with me.

951
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:43,917
Take your seat.

952
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:48,208
Tell me.

953
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,167
The car parked outsideâ€¦
Is it yours?

954
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:51,333
Yes.

955
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:53,833
You have changed the
windshield of the car on the 19th.

956
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,500
How did it break?

957
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:58,625
Why do you want to know about that?

958
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,125
A small enquiry.
Tell me.

959
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:05,500
Some drunkards pelted stones on
it as Iâ€™d parked it outside.

960
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,208
So I covered it
and parked inside later.

961
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,875
You seem to have changed
the glass in a hurry.

962
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,542
Small shards of broken glass
pieces are still there.

963
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,583
Sir...

964
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,750
I'm a blind man.

965
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,667
How would I know such
details about the car?

966
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,333
Am I the one driving the car?

967
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,375
Who drives it?

968
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,667
My driver.
Until a couple of months ago.

969
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,042
After that?

970
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:28,583
He didn't maintain.
the car properly

971
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,333
Also, I didn't use it much.

972
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:32,083
So I had to relieve him from his job.

973
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:33,875
No one used the car after that.

974
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,042
I take an auto or
cab if necessary.

975
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:41,042
Soâ€¦

976
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:43,542
No one has used the car for 2 months now?

977
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,458
Yes.
Anything else?

978
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:47,417
We will contact if
anything else needed.

979
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,625
I have some work now.

980
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,125
Soâ€¦

981
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,750
2 thugs came homeâ€¦

982
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:05,292
Your sight?

983
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,583
Greetings, Sir.
- You are Moorthy, right?

984
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,333
Sculptor Manoj's Driver?

985
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,125
I was working as his
driver 2 months ago.

986
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:47,542
Didn't you continue after that?

987
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:48,625
No, Sir.

988
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,708
Don't lie.

989
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,750
You have driven his car and got
it into an accident on the 18th.

990
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:54,875
I'm working here for
the past 2 months.

991
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:57,000
It has been while since
I last saw Mr.Manoj.

992
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:58,958
Why would I drive his car?

993
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:03,958
Manoj said that you were fired
because of you didnâ€™t maintain the car properly.

994
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,625
I was his driver for 3 years.

995
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:08,958
If that was true, he couldâ€™ve
fired me long ago.

996
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,292
My current employer verified with
him before giving me this job.

997
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:13,833
You can cross-check if needed.

998
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:17,333
If it wasn't you,
who wouldâ€™ve driven the car?

999
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,625
I thought that he was
going to sell the car.

1000
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,833
He didnâ€™t say anything when I
asked him.

1001
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,542
One day, I saw a lady
driving his car.

1002
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:28,708
I heard that she
was staying with him.

1003
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,000
I presumed that that might
be the reason for firing me.

1004
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,500
Do you know her?

1005
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:35,208
No. I have not seen her
while I was working for him.

1006
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,000
How did she look like?

1007
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,750
She was young, fair, and stylish.

1008
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:40,083
Age?

1009
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,250
She was a young lady.

1010
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:42,667
Would you able to identify her?

1011
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,750
I canâ€™t be very sure.

1012
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,958
We will enquire
again if required.

1013
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,292
Give me your number.
You mustn't leave the town now.

1014
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:52,917
Okay, Sir.

1015
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:39,667
Yes, aunt.

1016
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:40,833
How are you?

1017
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,125
Iâ€™m okay.
Tell me.

1018
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:43,333
What's the matter?

1019
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:45,125
Did Varun call you?

1020
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,708
I have deleted his number.

1021
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,417
Why would he call me?

1022
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,167
Even if he calls,
I'm not ready to talk to him.

1023
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:52,208
Please.

1024
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:53,292
Don't get furious.

1025
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,500
Even when he had was blind,

1026
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:56,833
he was peaceful.

1027
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,583
Now everything has
turned upside-down.

1028
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,625
Why are you telling me this?

1029
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:06,167
Varun left for Kanyakumari
all of a sudden.

1030
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,958
He didn't share any
further details.

1031
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,958
He has not been picking
my calls either.

1032
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,250
I'm confused.

1033
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,708
And worried.

1034
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:14,208
So I called you.

1035
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,500
Sorry, aunt. Don't
call me hereafter regarding him.

1036
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,292
I'll get it repaired.

1037
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:48,667
This Alphonse can fix all phones,
don't worry.

1038
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,500
Okay. I'll leave.
Bye.

1039
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,583
Welcome.
- Did you get any information?

1040
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:56,750
No call from the number you
mentioned got completed.

1041
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:57,958
From Manoj's number?

1042
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:58,625
Yes.

1043
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:01,875
Unless the call gets completed, I can't
find the number Manoj has been dialling.

1044
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:04,708
I checked the date you mentioned.

1045
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,000
After the 17th,

1046
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,167
there are no incoming or outgoing
calls to and from the number.

1047
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:12,792
But before the 17th, calls have been made
and received to and from a specific number.

1048
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,958
I eve have it written down
somewhere.

1049
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,208
Here it is.

1050
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:19,250
7599â€¦

1051
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,750
447333.

1052
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:22,833
333â€¦

1053
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,083
A number that ends with 333.

1054
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,292
Details of this number?

1055
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,958
You said the the victim of the
accident got calls from a number?

1056
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,167
Is it the same number?

1057
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:32,542
Let me check.

1058
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,583
Yes.

1059
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:37,042
It's the same number.

1060
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:40,208
The number we got from the lodge,
Manoj's number, and this number.

1061
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:41,625
There's some connection definitely.

1062
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,500
Sir.

1063
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:54,292
Moorthy, how are you?
- I'm fine.

1064
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,833
Did our car met with an accident?

1065
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:58,500
Why do you ask?

1066
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,167
The cops are torturing me, Sir.

1067
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,667
They are accusing me
of that accident, that I drove the car.

1068
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:04,208
What did you say?

1069
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,125
That I am no longer working for you.

1070
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,000
I told them that the lady
with you drives your car.

1071
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,292
How did you...

1072
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:12,875
Why did you blabber all that?

1073
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:14,667
Don't you have any sense?
- Sir!

1074
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:15,917
Fool!

1075
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,917
Manoj, tell us the
truth at least now.

1076
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,583
Who was with you?
What actually happened?

1077
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,167
Who is it?

1078
01:05:22,292 --> 01:05:23,375
The same cops who came yesterday.

1079
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,000
Tell me what happened.

1080
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,792
I did tell you that nothing happened.

1081
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:27,958
Please leave.

1082
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:29,250
If nothing had happenedâ€¦

1083
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,958
there is no need for
you to get furious.

1084
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,208
Manoj!

1085
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:35,292
Manoj!

1086
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,500
Manoj, open the door!

1087
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:39,542
Open the door!

1088
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:41,958
Hello!

1089
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,167
Where are you going?

1090
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:44,208
You can't leave the place
without answering us.

1091
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,208
I have no obligations to do so.

1092
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:48,000
I'll tell what I have to
tell at the police station.

1093
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,583
I'm a cop myself!
You can tell me. - Auto!

1094
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:53,333
Why is he so adamant?

1095
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,250
I don't know.
Start the bike.

1096
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:03,417
Come on.

1097
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:07,667
I'm dead!

1098
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:10,792
Though I wasn't a super-cop,
I was at least called a mediocre one.

1099
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,375
I might lose that even identity now,
because of you!

1100
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:13,708
Keep going, Panju.

1101
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:20,208
Will you drive recklessly
just because you are cop?

1102
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,500
Can't you be careful?

1103
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:24,625
Where is your helmet?

1104
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:27,750
Let's go, Panju.

1105
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:29,375
Sorry, man.

1106
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:30,417
Idiot.

1107
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,083
He went inside!

1108
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,792
How do I always find one like this!

1109
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,000
Hey!

1110
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,625
Inspector Arivazhagan?

1111
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,208
Yes.

1112
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:52,333
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?

1113
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,292
Yes.
Tell me.

1114
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:56,542
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?

1115
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,583
Indeed I am.
Tell me.

1116
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:07,583
Are you really
Inspector Arivazhagan?

1117
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,958
Who is this at my
station, questioning me?

1118
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:12,375
Hey, Panju!

1119
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,208
Sir!
- Come here!

1120
01:07:15,542 --> 01:07:16,083
Sir?

1121
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:17,750
Find out what this man wants.

1122
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:18,917
Okay, Sir.

1123
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,292
Come.

1124
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,708
Did I really speak to the Inspector?

1125
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:24,125
Yes.

1126
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,208
Why are you bugging us?

1127
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,875
Tell me, is he really
Inspector Arivazhagan?

1128
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yes, he is.

1129
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:31,625
You came so furiously to
meet this very same Arivazhagan.

1130
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,375
Manoj.

1131
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,833
Manoj, please relax.

1132
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,250
I can understand that you
are in some trouble.

1133
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,417
Your car was involved
in the accident.

1134
01:07:43,792 --> 01:07:45,875
The person with you must
have driven the car.

1135
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:48,167
Your intention of saving
her is not wrong.

1136
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:50,125
But a life has been lost.

1137
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,125
Don't get scared, Manoj.

1138
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:53,958
We are not dealing this
case officially.

1139
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:55,583
Only if you tell the truth,

1140
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,750
we can save you and
your friend.

1141
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:00,250
Just like this, a guy came to help.

1142
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:03,375
The penalty I paid for it is 20 lakh rupees.

1143
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:04,917
To whom did you give?

1144
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:06,750
Inspector Arivazhagan.

1145
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,583
What do you mean?!

1146
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,542
That who he said he was.

1147
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:15,250
Last week, my girlfriend Ashwini and I

1148
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:16,667
had gone for a drive.

1149
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:18,333
Go away.

1150
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:21,250
Just one kiss like this.

1151
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:22,708
Fraudster!
What do you call this then?

1152
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:24,958
This was just a rehearsal.

1153
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,125
Suddenly,

1154
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:30,292
she thought she saw someone
standing on the road

1155
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,917
and she swerved the car
away in one quick movement.

1156
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,500
Ashwini!

1157
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:40,083
What happened?

1158
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:46,417
Ashwini!

1159
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:48,042
Ashwini!

1160
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:49,792
Where are you?

1161
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,083
What happened?

1162
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:56,875
What happened?

1163
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:02,417
I killed a guy, Manoj.

1164
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:05,292
Come, Ashwini.

1165
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,750
Let's go.

1166
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:09,583
I convinced her somehow and
got her home.

1167
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,833
All this happened becauseâ€¦

1168
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:14,708
some idiot had placed a
scarecrow in the middle of the road.

1169
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,875
I consoled her that
it was not her fault.

1170
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:18,833
But she kept crying.

1171
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:22,083
We couldn't sleep out of fear.

1172
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:24,708
The calling ball rang at 5 AM.

1173
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,750
Who is it, Ashwini?

1174
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,125
At this time?

1175
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,458
Police!

1176
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,333
A policeman has come!

1177
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,875
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?

1178
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:37,083
He got in and started threatening us.

1179
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:39,792
The car being involved in the accidentâ€¦

1180
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:41,417
Ashwini having driven itâ€¦

1181
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,375
The windshield of the car having brokenâ€¦
He seemed to know everything.

1182
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:46,167
He threatened that
he had evidence for it all.

1183
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:47,708
Ashwini and Iâ€¦

1184
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:50,125
Ashwini immediately pleaded guilty.

1185
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,125
Ashwini is an NRI, right?

1186
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:53,958
Yes, Sir.
- Hit-and-run case.

1187
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,667
If an FIR is filed,
she can't go back.

1188
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:59,917
You must help us!
Please, Sir!

1189
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:01,833
I ensure that a case is not filed.

1190
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,667
But if any of his
relative create a problem,

1191
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:06,833
we need to silence them.
That will cost you.

1192
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,250
No, Manoj.

1193
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,625
Sir, I killed him.

1194
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:11,417
I accept my fault.

1195
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:12,667
Keep quiet, Ashwini!

1196
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:13,917
Sirâ€¦

1197
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,625
What should we do?

1198
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:16,708
Manoj.

1199
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,125
Where is Ashwini now?

1200
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:20,792
She didn't like me
bribing the cop.

1201
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:24,917
She felt guilty
and left the same day.

1202
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:28,375
I don't know where she
went or what she is doing now.

1203
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:31,000
I could not contact her either.

1204
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:34,167
Seeing everything that is happening now,

1205
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,667
I'm worried about her safety!

1206
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,500
She should be safe, Manoj.

1207
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:41,083
Is Ashwini's number?

1208
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
7599â€¦

1209
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,208
44â€¦

1210
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
7333?

1211
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:46,042
Yes!

1212
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,500
How do you know it?

1213
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:52,625
We will explain.

1214
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,167
If we need to find Ashwiniâ€¦

1215
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:57,125
We need some details about her.

1216
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,250
Since when do you know Ashwini?

1217
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,042
Recentlyâ€¦ Not too long agoâ€¦

1218
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,542
She came to see my sculptures.

1219
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,333
We became friends.

1220
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,625
You said Ashwini was an NRI?

1221
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:10,292
Yes.
From Singapore.

1222
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:13,333
She has some ancestral
property near Nagercoil.

1223
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,208
She had come to sell it.

1224
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:17,000
Was she staying with you?

1225
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:18,417
At first she was staying outside.

1226
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,375
As we got closerâ€¦

1227
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:23,417
She came here and stayed with me.

1228
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,833
I was happy every single
moment that I spent with her.

1229
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:29,792
She loved me as well.

1230
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,417
But everything turned
up-side-down in one night.

1231
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,833
Maybe Ashwini has gone
back to Singapore.

1232
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:40,042
Do you have that contact number?

1233
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,250
Her E-mail ID, Facebook
ID, or something like that?

1234
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:45,500
No.
- Nothing?

1235
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,167
So you had kept punching a
number no longer in use!

1236
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,250
Manojâ€¦

1237
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,458
Do you have any photo of
you and her together?

1238
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:57,958
No, I don't.

1239
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:00,292
What will I do with the photos?

1240
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,250
The few photos that we did take
are on her phone.

1241
01:12:06,167 --> 01:12:09,458
Any of your relatives or
friends who have seen Ashwini?

1242
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:10,958
No.

1243
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:13,792
Have you seen any of her
friends or relatives?

1244
01:12:14,917 --> 01:12:15,625
No.

1245
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,583
Where is that ancestral
place that you mentioned?

1246
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,750
I don't know.
- What?

1247
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,792
What were you doing with her
without knowing anything?

1248
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:25,333
Manojâ€¦

1249
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,500
Have you both gone out
somewhere together?

1250
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:29,792
Sometimes we used to
go for a night drive.

1251
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,875
Mostly we like solitude.

1252
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,708
Hmmmâ€¦ Enjoyment in solitudeâ€¦

1253
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:40,875
Please think about itâ€¦

1254
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:42,000
Haven't you gone out
anywhere together?

1255
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,667
On my birthdayâ€¦

1256
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:48,833
We went to a temple and
had lunch outside.

1257
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,208
Which restaurant?

1258
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:52,167
Beach Walk.
- When is your birthday?

1259
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:53,292
September 12th.

1260
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,833
Okay, Manoj.
We will try to find Ashwini.

1261
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:01,542
You don't get scared.

1262
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:02,792
Thank you.

1263
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:04,417
Don't go to the
police station again.

1264
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:05,667
You may end up in
an even bigger trouble.

1265
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:07,625
Not all cops will be honest like me.

1266
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,750
Got it?

1267
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:12,417
Panju.

1268
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,125
If 333 number is Ashwiniâ€™sâ€¦

1269
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,250
The victim is related to Ashwini.

1270
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:17,542
But, Ashwini...

1271
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,083
has not shared that detail with Manoj.

1272
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:20,542
So, our next target isâ€¦

1273
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:21,958
Ashwini.

1274
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,042
Go to September 12th.

1275
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:51,292
Lunch time.

1276
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:56,125
Panju.

1277
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,708
That camera.

1278
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,583
Play this cameraâ€™s footage.

1279
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:09,958
Play the other one.
- Done?

1280
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,875
No, Sir. I'll take care.
- Panju.

1281
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:18,000
They will leave now.
I assure you.

1282
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Varun.
- Sir.

1283
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,208
Please wait. We are checking, right?
- What is this?

1284
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Wait.

1285
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:34,333
What is this?

1286
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:35,833
Nothing, Sir.

1287
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,208
Why are they hitting the waiter?

1288
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,833
It's nothing serious..
- Heyâ€¦

1289
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:42,333
I want the answer.
- Sirâ€¦

1290
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:46,375
He had been taking photos of the
women coming to the restaurant

1291
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:47,667
discreetlyâ€¦

1292
01:14:47,792 --> 01:14:49,125
A customer noticed it.

1293
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:50,042
He was caught.

1294
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:53,167
When everyone started
hitting him, he escaped.

1295
01:14:53,917 --> 01:14:55,042
If we report it to the police,

1296
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:56,625
our restaurant will get a bad nameâ€¦

1297
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,250
So we handled the
situation and let it go.

1298
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:04,042
Where is he now?

1299
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:20,708
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?

1300
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,333
No idea, Sir.

1301
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:26,625
The guy who was working at
Beach Walk restaurant.

1302
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:28,167
His name is Dinesh.

1303
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:30,042
It's him.

1304
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:32,958
Yes.

1305
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,958
He was working in some hotel.
- Where is he?

1306
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,792
I don't know, Sir.
He should be somewhere around.

1307
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:39,292
Thanks.

1308
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,417
(boys chattering)

1309
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,333
Sorry, Sir.
Please throw the ball.

1310
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,542
I just said sorry.
Throw the ball, Sir.

1311
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,167
Oh, here you are!

1312
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Met him?

1313
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,375
They came searching for you.

1314
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:02,542
Hey, stop!

1315
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,292
Hey!

1316
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:38,208
This fellow...

1317
01:16:38,792 --> 01:16:40,250
Hello, Sir.
- Where are you?

1318
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:43,042
I am chasing an accused
in high speed, Sir!

1319
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,667
I'll talk later.

1320
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:49,375
I canâ€™t even catch
such a slow-runner!

1321
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:50,917
Iâ€¦

1322
01:16:57,583 --> 01:16:58,458
Varun!

1323
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Idiot!

1324
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:02,750
Will you keep breaking rules
just because you are a cop?

1325
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,833
You are always interfering
a responsible cop on duty!

1326
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,292
Get lost!

1327
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:23,458
Leave me!
I said leave me!

1328
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:24,958
Why are you after me?

1329
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:27,917
What do you want?

1330
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:29,625
Sir, leave me!

1331
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:33,917
Leave me, Sir!

1332
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,708
What wrong did I do?

1333
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,083
Sirâ€¦
- Got it?

1334
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:37,500
Sir!

1335
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,708
There's nothing in it.
Please give it.

1336
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,625
Stay quiet.

1337
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:42,000
Unlock it.
- Leave me!

1338
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:44,125
Give me the phone!
- Heyâ€¦

1339
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,208
Unlock it!

1340
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:50,833
Sir!
- Stay quiet!

1341
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:53,792
Leave me!
- Panjuâ€¦

1342
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,042
When is Manoj's birthday?
- September 12th.

1343
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:01,583
He keeps annoying!

1344
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:02,708
Don't move!

1345
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,708
Won't you leave?

1346
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,583
Sirâ€¦

1347
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,750
Stay quiet!

1348
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:22,417
Sadhana!
What are you doing here?

1349
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,167
How did you come here?

1350
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,833
Are you still after her?

1351
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,583
I wonder why I came running for you!

1352
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:34,292
Your mom is worried about you, wondering
where you are, what you are doingâ€¦

1353
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:37,417
And here you are, roaming
behind your lover.

1354
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,083
Don't talk nonsense without
knowing about the situation!

1355
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:40,667
This is Ashwini.

1356
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,458
Are you trying to act wise
by changing her name?

1357
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:45,042
I know that it's Deepa.

1358
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:47,667
I can never forget that face.

1359
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,292
You were all intimate with
her at the restaurant!

1360
01:18:57,417 --> 01:18:58,958
If you knew Deepa all alongâ€¦

1361
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:00,333
Why didn't you mention it
when I was searching for her?

1362
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:01,542
Yes, itâ€™s my mistake.

1363
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:02,917
Big mistake!

1364
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,417
I should have found he,
gotten her married to you,

1365
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,917
and blessed you both.

1366
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,167
It's my mistake.
Please forgive me.

1367
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:12,375
You will never change.

1368
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,000
You will go completely
mad roaming behind her!

1369
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:17,750
Please don't blabber without
knowing the situation.

1370
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,042
There's nothing complex to understand.

1371
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,417
Please, Sadhana!

1372
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:25,042
I'm already terribly confused.

1373
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:26,542
You are actually very clear.

1374
01:19:27,042 --> 01:19:29,292
Only I am confused
and running behind you repeatedlyâ€¦

1375
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,042
What's happening here?

1376
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:40,542
Butâ€¦

1377
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,125
I have seen many fraudsters.

1378
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,542
But you have tricked a cop
for your own selfish, personal reasons.

1379
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,792
Panjuâ€¦
- You easily decided that

1380
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:51,333
a person like me will
be a constable forever,

1381
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:52,458
that you can take
full advantage of me!

1382
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,708
Canâ€™t blame you.
My face is made to look like that!

1383
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,417
Had I not known the
truth even now,

1384
01:19:57,458 --> 01:20:00,583
I would be roaming with you dreaming
of becoming a TV celebrity.

1385
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:02,125
Misterâ€¦ - You almost got
me fired from my job!

1386
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:04,792
We couldn't have made such
a progress in this case without you!

1387
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,042
You would have gotten nowhere
had I not come.

1388
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,792
Panju, the case has made
a big progress.

1389
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:13,917
Our work starts only now!

1390
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:15,333
Our work?

1391
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,375
I won't even have you on
my Facebook friend list.

1392
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:18,833
Enough!

1393
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,125
We started this case to find
the details of the dead man.

1394
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:23,375
But this case has
reached new heights now.

1395
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:24,875
If we are able to nab her,

1396
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:26,625
You will be in the limelight.

1397
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:28,625
She is really a journalist.

1398
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,833
If we solve this case perfectly,

1399
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,875
The cover page of her magazine
Vikatan will bear your photo.

1400
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,792
This face?

1401
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:36,083
Cover page?

1402
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:51,333
Manoj.

1403
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:54,208
Why is he sobbing like this?

1404
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:56,833
How many shocks in the
truth can he bear to hear in a day?

1405
01:20:57,042 --> 01:20:58,917
He will be normal in a while.

1406
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,667
You left him to sob alone?
- What do you want me to do?

1407
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:04,167
He is crying by himself.

1408
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:05,542
You should be the one to console him.

1409
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:06,667
Go.
- Not again!

1410
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:10,167
So, she has been selectively
cheating blind men.

1411
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:13,417
They have to be blindâ€¦

1412
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,375
They must believe her stories.

1413
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,958
Must be ready to give
the money she asks.

1414
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,333
She targets those people.

1415
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:21,625
in the name of loveâ€¦

1416
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:23,042
And made a clean sweep.

1417
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:25,792
If my instincts are right,

1418
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:26,875
even nowâ€¦

1419
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:28,833
she should be cheating someoneâ€¦

1420
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:32,625
Call Priya.

1421
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,250
Priyaâ€¦

1422
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:41,667
Where are you?

1423
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:00,792
You, are one sneaky lady.

1424
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,750
A small, loveable vampire.

1425
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:06,667
You are a feisty flood, in a
body that is opaque like glass.

1426
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,208
You, are one sneaky lady.

1427
01:22:09,417 --> 01:22:11,417
A small, loveable vampire

1428
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,333
You are a brilliant player,
who plays very casually.

1429
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:17,417
Oh, youâ€¦ Smart, sneaky girl!

1430
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,792
Oh, youâ€¦ Smart, sneaky girl!

1431
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,375
Oh, youâ€¦ Smart, sneaky girl!

1432
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:26,417
Manoj.

1433
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:27,625
Based on what you saidâ€¦

1434
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,583
After cheating me as Deepaâ€¦

1435
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:32,208
She didn't take much time
to meet you as Ashwini.

1436
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,125
She has met you even when
I was still at the hospital.

1437
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:38,083
So, she mightâ€™ve chosen Manoj
as the next target after you much earlier.

1438
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,042
Yes.

1439
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,708
So we must find out the way
she finds these blind people.

1440
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,250
Yes.

1441
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,000
Apart from Manoj and I being blindâ€¦

1442
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:46,167
What is common between us?

1443
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,583
A blind man is cookingâ€¦

1444
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,417
That made people to
come to my restaurant.

1445
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:51,875
That gave me publicity.

1446
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:53,958
That helped my business as well.

1447
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:56,458
Yes. I have even written
about him.

1448
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,083
Manojâ€¦

1449
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:00,750
Has there been any newspaper
article or TV news about you?

1450
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:02,583
I'm not all that famous.

1451
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm just a simple man.

1452
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:07,167
She will not come after
a simple man. - Exactly!

1453
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,708
You are successful
in your field.

1454
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:11,833
You must have gotten
some recognition.

1455
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:14,333
You must have been received some awards.

1456
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:17,208
Or any ceremonies that you have
presided over as a chief guestâ€¦

1457
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:18,708
Something like of that sort?

1458
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,458
You could have spared the biscuit.

1459
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:35,042
Looks like Vijay Awards memento.

1460
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,125
What is it Varun?

1461
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,625
Tamilnadu Entrepreneur's
Association for the Specially Abled.

1462
01:23:57,042 --> 01:23:58,042
Hey!

1463
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,708
Didnâ€™t they give you an award last year?

1464
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:08,958
This is the chronological list of awardees
with the criteria.

1465
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:11,333
Check if it has their
contact details.

1466
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:17,417
Superb.

1467
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,167
Exclude other disabled persons, nowâ€¦

1468
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:20,500
Only blind membersâ€¦

1469
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,625
Details of award winners
and those without an awardâ€¦

1470
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,875
The members of this list
must be her target.

1471
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:34,208
These are the ones who got cheated, and
ones who are about to get cheated.

1472
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,417
This is the list.

1473
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:36,917
So the job is simple.

1474
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,667
All we need to do is to
contact them, and ask them,

1475
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:40,000
if a girl cheatedâ€¦

1476
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,958
If we ask them if theyâ€™ve
been cheated by a girlâ€¦

1477
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:44,125
our progress will end there,

1478
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,417
since half the people would have
no idea that theyâ€™ve been cheated,

1479
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:48,542
and even if they know, they
will not acknowledge it.

1480
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,792
Keeping aside all of thatâ€¦

1481
01:24:51,167 --> 01:24:53,667
Assuming that she is cheating
someone on the list right nowâ€¦

1482
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,125
The moment we contact
him, she will abscond.

1483
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,625
And after that, we can never find her.

1484
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:01,958
So, she should not know
that we are after her.

1485
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:03,333
But we have to nab her.

1486
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,208
How is that possible?

1487
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,875
These guys are in various towns and cities.

1488
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,625
How can we go everywhere?

1489
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,500
There is a way.

1490
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:13,042
Our student reporters
are present everywhere.

1491
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,625
This is a small assignment for them.

1492
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,542
Will it work out?

1493
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:18,708
Definitely.

1494
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,458
I'm calling from the Trichy womenâ€™s prison.

1495
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,583
Where is she?
- Erode.

1496
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:26,042
So she has been is caught in our radar!

1497
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,208
Her name is neither
Deepa nor Ashwini.

1498
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:30,583
It is Vasundhara.

1499
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:33,333
Her native is Trichy.

1500
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:35,417
She worked in a jewellery shop there.

1501
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:37,917
She duplicated the jewels
that don't sellâ€¦

1502
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:40,292
And stole the original.

1503
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:41,875
She was caught red-handed one day.

1504
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,250
From the May of 2013 to
the November of 2013,

1505
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:20,833
she was imprisoned at Trichy Jail.

1506
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:22,833
Her father is no more.

1507
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,667
Her mother passed away
when she was in prison.

1508
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:25,958
Any relatives?

1509
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:28,292
One maternal uncle, Ravi.

1510
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:29,417
Do you want to see who that is?

1511
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:31,417
Look.

1512
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:35,833
So it's a well-planned
and executed ordeal.

1513
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:38,292
But the mastermind behind all of this is

1514
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:39,667
Vasundhara.

1515
01:27:42,167 --> 01:27:43,292
I am not able to, Vikram.

1516
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,167
You know that my
parents are no more.

1517
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:50,375
My brother is all I have.

1518
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:52,625
Why does he have all these problems!

1519
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:56,542
You could have told me in advance.

1520
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,125
Never-ending problemsâ€¦

1521
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:04,208
Hospital atmosphereâ€¦

1522
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:05,583
Smell of medicinesâ€¦

1523
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:07,167
Amidst all of this, the
happiness that I have left

1524
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,417
is when I'm away from all these.

1525
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:10,583
and spend some time with you.

1526
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,125
Do you want to me to
cry that time also?

1527
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:16,583
What do doctors have to say?

1528
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,125
Before the tumor grows further,

1529
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:22,375
a liver transplant has to be done.

1530
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:26,750
There is no enough time to
wait for a suitable donor.

1531
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:29,750
The only option left is

1532
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:32,917
to arrange for an organ
illegally through an agent.

1533
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:34,625
Butâ€¦

1534
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:36,625
It's very expensive.

1535
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:41,000
I have lost hope fully!

1536
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:42,833
My brotherâ€¦

1537
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:44,333
Don't say that nowâ€¦

1538
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:46,542
I'm here to help you.

1539
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:48,875
I'll be there for you.

1540
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:51,708
Listen.

1541
01:28:52,792 --> 01:28:54,417
I'm expecting a payment this week.

1542
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:56,750
Give me 2 to 3 days.

1543
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,667
I'll somehow arrange for the money.

1544
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:01,667
No.

1545
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:04,375
No, Vikram.
- Don't talk like an idiot.

1546
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:06,375
This is your brother's life.

1547
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,208
That's the priority now.

1548
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:10,458
You proceed with arrangements for the transplant.

1549
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:11,667
We will take care of the rest later.

1550
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:13,875
Priya.

1551
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Thank you so much.

1552
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,708
A boat load of lies, in those
big beautiful eyes of yours.

1553
01:29:26,792 --> 01:29:30,667
You girl, are an anaconda in the
disguise of an innocent child.

1554
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:35,667
Soâ€¦

1555
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:36,542
What's the next plan?

1556
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:38,750
Erode.

1557
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,083
Are we going by bus or by train?

1558
01:29:46,167 --> 01:29:47,167
Go!

1559
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:48,667
Go fast.

1560
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:50,167
Are you sure it's Vikram?

1561
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:52,208
Yes, I'm tracking the
number you gave.

1562
01:29:52,417 --> 01:29:54,417
It's displaying that he is
just in the car in front of yours.

1563
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:15,708
Varun, what are you doing?
- Leave me!

1564
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:16,833
I'll kill her!

1565
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:18,208
Listen.
- Hey!

1566
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:19,833
Don't do anything silly.
Don't move.

1567
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:21,417
Everything will go in
vain if you go there now.

1568
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:25,792
We can't prove anything with
what we have found out so far.

1569
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:27,792
Have some patience.

1570
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:30,208
She has a new scapegoat.

1571
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,667
All we have to do is to
catch her red-handed.

1572
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:36,250
At least we have to
know what they are talking

1573
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:38,583
Or do you want to sit here
and issue parking tickets?

1574
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:39,750
Let's do that also.

1575
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:42,667
Give me the Bluetooth earpiece.

1576
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:44,417
Why?
- I'll tell you, give it to me.

1577
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:47,333
Wait here.

1578
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:50,083
Whereâ€¦

1579
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:55,208
Juice will do?

1580
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,625
Hello.
- Yes, Sadhana.

1581
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,333
Don't talk.
Stay on line.

1582
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:07,167
Had you not been here,
I would have helpless.

1583
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:10,042
How will I ever repay you Vikram?

1584
01:31:12,542 --> 01:31:13,542
Thank you.

1585
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,250
Thank you so much.
- Hey.

1586
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:18,917
Why are you so formal?
I'll get the money tomorrow.

1587
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:20,625
You focus on the arrangements.

1588
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:23,292
Are you done with the
hospital arrangements?

1589
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,958
I came here after paying
the advance amount.

1590
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:28,667
My brother's friends are
with him at the hospital.

1591
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:30,750
He is repeatedly
asking to meet you.

1592
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:32,333
Once the transplantation is done,

1593
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:34,333
I will be the first
person to meet him.

1594
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:40,208
She is cooking a
story to rob him.

1595
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:49,917
Priya?

1596
01:31:50,792 --> 01:31:51,792
Are you crying?

1597
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:54,542
Thanks for being there, Vikram.

1598
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:56,042
Be strong.

1599
01:31:56,417 --> 01:31:57,875
I'll be there for you.

1600
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,083
Your company is all I need.

1601
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,250
Everything will go smoothly.

1602
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:05,958
Who is this woman?!

1603
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,958
Even I want to fall in love with her!

1604
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,500
I'll pay.

1605
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,125
What's your lover
Vasundhara saying?

1606
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:44,292
Start, startâ€¦

1607
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:51,958
Go closer!

1608
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:55,333
Follow them.

1609
01:33:00,792 --> 01:33:02,000
You, moron!

1610
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,500
We have to take the other route now.

1611
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,292
Move...
- Idiot. - We lost them!

1612
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,375
Panju, call Alphonse.

1613
01:33:30,792 --> 01:33:32,417
I'm not able to reach him.

1614
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:38,208
Bye.
- Bye.

1615
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,542
Who is it?
- It's me.

1616
01:33:57,417 --> 01:33:58,542
Why did you come here?

1617
01:33:58,792 --> 01:34:00,042
Did anyone see you?

1618
01:34:00,792 --> 01:34:02,583
I took the backside stairs.
None saw me.

1619
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:04,792
An important matter.
Soâ€¦

1620
01:34:04,917 --> 01:34:06,375
Whatever it is,
you should have just called me.

1621
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:07,833
Varun is here.

1622
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:09,458
In Erode.
- Varun?

1623
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:12,292
The chef from Chennai.

1624
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,625
So what?

1625
01:34:18,042 --> 01:34:19,250
He might have come for
some official work.

1626
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:20,875
No.

1627
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:22,292
He has come searching for you.

1628
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:24,125
They have seen you at
the hotel with Vikram.

1629
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:26,750
I heard the girl with
him address you as â€˜Vasundhara.â€™

1630
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:28,583
Then they followed you in a car.

1631
01:34:29,042 --> 01:34:30,042
I diverted them.

1632
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,667
I think they know everything.

1633
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:36,000
They come targeting us.

1634
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:37,292
We shouldn't take further risks.

1635
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:38,708
Drop Vikram.

1636
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:39,875
Let's go.

1637
01:34:40,417 --> 01:34:41,250
What?

1638
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:42,708
Listen to me.
Let's leave this right here and go.

1639
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:45,083
This won't
work anymore, Vasundhara.

1640
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:56,458
You always talk negatively!

1641
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:57,583
Aren't you ashamed?

1642
01:34:59,292 --> 01:35:01,250
People will keep chasing us if we run.

1643
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:03,083
They will stop only
if we make them run instead.

1644
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:06,083
Tomorrow, by this time,
we have the money in hand.

1645
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:08,708
Nothing should stop that.

1646
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:10,167
Understood?

1647
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,750
You are the reason
for all these!

1648
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:24,958
We can't get any money from Varun.

1649
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:26,500
All his money

1650
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:28,292
has been spent on his eye surgery.

1651
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:30,750
Everything has messed up.

1652
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:32,417
we have to leave
empty-handed now!

1653
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:35,792
Forget it.

1654
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:37,625
We can't expect all our
attempts to be successful.

1655
01:35:37,792 --> 01:35:39,292
One or two might go
out of our hands.

1656
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:41,667
Okay.

1657
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:43,083
Whatâ€™s next?

1658
01:35:44,292 --> 01:35:45,292
I'll tell you.

1659
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:46,875
And listenâ€¦

1660
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:48,958
Give us our share.

1661
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,417
What are you saying, uncle?

1662
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,750
We won't get any money.

1663
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:53,500
And you are talking about a share!

1664
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:54,417
Lookâ€¦

1665
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:57,875
From spying on Varun and
drafting a plan for you,

1666
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,042
there has been no mistake
from our side.

1667
01:36:00,792 --> 01:36:01,917
If the plan messes up
in the last minuteâ€¦

1668
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,375
We can't help that.
- Heyâ€¦

1669
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:05,958
You will get your share if
the plan go as anticipated.

1670
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:07,583
Or elseâ€¦

1671
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:08,792
The loss is for everyone.

1672
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:12,292
If youâ€™d properly given
our share earlier,

1673
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:13,833
why would I demand now?

1674
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:16,375
You always take the major share.

1675
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,458
What we get is just the leftovers.

1676
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:19,708
If we don't get even that now,

1677
01:36:20,417 --> 01:36:21,417
should we beg?

1678
01:36:25,792 --> 01:36:26,792
Look!

1679
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:29,500
I'm the one who gets directly
involved.

1680
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,208
I'm the one who
takes the maximum risk.

1681
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:33,125
You and himâ€¦

1682
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:34,542
You will not get caught for sure.

1683
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,083
If I get caughtâ€¦

1684
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:37,667
I'm done.

1685
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:42,458
Don't cry like a kid.

1686
01:36:43,083 --> 01:36:44,083
Go and see what needs to be done.

1687
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:49,625
If Vasundhara gets to know,
we will get into trouble.

1688
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:51,208
The chances of her knowing are very low.

1689
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:52,917
She is with Manoj now.

1690
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:54,375
She will not search for us.

1691
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,208
This is the only opportunity we will get.

1692
01:36:57,208 --> 01:36:58,208
If we continue like thisâ€¦

1693
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,167
She will treat us like
dogs forever.

1694
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:01,625
We can't gain anything
from being like that.

1695
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,250
Don't think too much.

1696
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:04,833
I have planned everything.

1697
01:37:05,667 --> 01:37:06,958
Talk your girl, Divya.

1698
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:08,625
She has to come.

1699
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:10,167
She must not disclose

1700
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,000
these details to anyone.

1701
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:13,333
Got it?

1702
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,417
Where were you?

1703
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:43,958
You weren't in Kanyakumari
for the past 2 daysâ€¦

1704
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:46,750
Since we had no work here,
we had gone to Kerala.

1705
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:48,292
What is your Manoj saying?

1706
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:49,833
You left me alone with him,

1707
01:37:50,792 --> 01:37:52,125
and went on a vacation?

1708
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:55,375
You said that if we lure
Manoj with money and wealth,

1709
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:57,333
we can easily trap him.

1710
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,125
He is least bothered about it.

1711
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:00,917
He is sticking to me

1712
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,875
like a leech and torturing me.

1713
01:38:03,167 --> 01:38:04,917
What sort of background
work have you done?

1714
01:38:07,292 --> 01:38:08,542
He is in love with me.

1715
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:12,708
You have easily
dealt many men before this.

1716
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:14,333
This guy doesn't even stand a chance.

1717
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:27,542
You are being a bit restless.

1718
01:38:27,667 --> 01:38:28,667
Fetch me some water.

1719
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:30,375
Deal with him with some patience.

1720
01:38:31,917 --> 01:38:32,917
If it doesn't work outâ€¦

1721
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:34,792
weâ€™ll change the plan.

1722
01:38:48,042 --> 01:38:49,042
Thomas.

1723
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:51,417
Get me my handbag from
the backseat, please.

1724
01:38:54,667 --> 01:38:56,000
There is a pen inside.

1725
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:01,542
This one?
- Open the cap.

1726
01:39:03,667 --> 01:39:04,667
Thanks.

1727
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:14,125
Vasundhara! - I can sense that
you both involved in something.

1728
01:39:14,542 --> 01:39:15,542
What's it?

1729
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:17,125
Vasundharaâ€¦
- Tell me, what is it?

1730
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:22,042
It will not take any time for me to
poke this into your throat!

1731
01:39:22,417 --> 01:39:23,417
(stuttering)

1732
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,042
Ravi drafted the plan.

1733
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:29,917
We went to Chennai
to meet Varunâ€¦

1734
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:33,542
Ravi sold all the jewelsâ€¦

1735
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:35,292
we looted from Varun.

1736
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:36,792
Raviâ€¦

1737
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:38,833
has all the money.

1738
01:39:44,042 --> 01:39:44,875
Sorry.

1739
01:39:46,208 --> 01:39:47,208
I'm very sorry.

1740
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:49,958
If uncle has taken such a stepâ€¦

1741
01:39:50,292 --> 01:39:51,292
I'm the one to be blamed.

1742
01:39:53,375 --> 01:39:54,833
I thought that if you
had too much money,

1743
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:57,000
you will spend it all on
alcohol and other such nonsense.

1744
01:39:57,542 --> 01:39:58,875
I have saved a share
separately for you.

1745
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:01,208
I did for a good reason.

1746
01:40:01,417 --> 01:40:02,417
But it has gone wrong.

1747
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:06,750
Let Manoj's deal get finished.

1748
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:09,833
I'll give your fair share.

1749
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:22,500
Only if we are united,
we can cheat others.

1750
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:24,333
If we cheat amongst ourselves,

1751
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:25,750
we will not prosper.

1752
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,250
Got it?

1753
01:40:28,417 --> 01:40:30,167
Don't share this with uncle.

1754
01:40:30,542 --> 01:40:32,667
I'll draft a plan for Manoj
and let you know.

1755
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:34,708
Let's go to the hospital
and then leave.

1756
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:39,375
In the route from
Kanyakumari to Nagercoil,

1757
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:40,833
these 3 trees

1758
01:40:41,167 --> 01:40:41,875
are our mark.

1759
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:43,042
You wait here.

1760
01:40:43,458 --> 01:40:45,125
I'll give a missed
call while I come closeâ€¦

1761
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:48,333
You set a scarecrow looking like a human
in the middle of the road.

1762
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:49,750
I'll hit the scarecrow,

1763
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:51,500
and act as though Iâ€™d hit a man.

1764
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:52,833
Then you have to lie on the road

1765
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,583
like a dead man.

1766
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:56,333
Definitely he will get scared.

1767
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,500
He will try to run away from the spot.

1768
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:00,625
Then you clear the spot,

1769
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:02,208
and leave the place.

1770
01:41:03,042 --> 01:41:03,792
The plan is perfect.

1771
01:41:05,417 --> 01:41:06,000
Hey, pleaseâ€¦

1772
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:12,708
Ashwini, what happened?!

1773
01:41:13,292 --> 01:41:14,292
What happened?
Tell me!

1774
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:17,583
Ashwini!

1775
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,333
What happened?

1776
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:20,917
Where are you?

1777
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:23,958
Ashwini, where are you?

1778
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:25,625
Ashwini!

1779
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:28,167
Ashwini, what happened?

1780
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:30,708
He's dead, Manoj.

1781
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:32,375
Come, Ashwini.

1782
01:41:32,417 --> 01:41:33,417
Let's go.

1783
01:41:33,417 --> 01:41:34,417
Let's not stay here.

1784
01:41:42,917 --> 01:41:43,917
Who is it, Ashwini?

1785
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:44,958
Inspector Arivazhagan.

1786
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:46,167
Can I come in?

1787
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,958
Sir, I killed him.

1788
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:49,375
I accept my doing.

1789
01:41:49,458 --> 01:41:51,625
Do you know how many years
of jail for a hit-and-run case?

1790
01:41:52,042 --> 01:41:53,042
Keep quiet, Ashwini.

1791
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,250
Sirâ€¦

1792
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:55,333
What should I do?

1793
01:41:57,958 --> 01:41:58,958
I'll tell you.

1794
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:03,625
I'll miss you, Manoj.

1795
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:05,333
Be careful.

1796
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:07,125
I'll be awaiting your call.

1797
01:42:08,417 --> 01:42:09,417
Call me soon.

1798
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:18,583
A beautiful plotter
One who cannot be controlled whatsoever.

1799
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:22,708
You are a small secret
That hits away with ease the balls life throws at you.

1800
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:27,250
A beautiful plotter
One who cannot be controlled whatsoever.

1801
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:31,083
A chameleon in the disguise
of a cute barbie doll.

1802
01:42:35,417 --> 01:42:36,667
Ravi is nowhere to be seen.

1803
01:42:37,292 --> 01:42:38,292
His phone is not reachable.

1804
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,125
Did he inform you?

1805
01:42:42,583 --> 01:42:43,583
Did he call you?

1806
01:42:45,542 --> 01:42:47,292
Get me my bag
from the backseat.

1807
01:42:49,792 --> 01:42:50,792
Get it.

1808
01:42:54,417 --> 01:42:55,417
Oh, you â€¦. Smart, sneaky girl!

1809
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:57,500
Oh, you â€¦. Smart, sneaky girl!

1810
01:42:58,583 --> 01:42:59,583
Oh, you â€¦. Smart, sneaky girl!

1811
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,750
He will not return.

1812
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:16,875
Varun knows everything.

1813
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:19,500
If heâ€™d come here to catch me,

1814
01:43:19,958 --> 01:43:20,958
even after seeing me,

1815
01:43:21,667 --> 01:43:22,667
why didn't he come to me?

1816
01:43:23,583 --> 01:43:24,583
Why should he follow me?

1817
01:43:25,042 --> 01:43:27,333
That simple means, he has
no concrete evidence so far.

1818
01:43:28,042 --> 01:43:29,042
He wonâ€™t
get any evidence hereafter as well.

1819
01:43:31,042 --> 01:43:32,042
Butâ€¦

1820
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,250
The important thing is

1821
01:43:33,542 --> 01:43:35,375
that he should not reach
Vikram at any point.

1822
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:47,333
Vikram.
- Priya.

1823
01:43:48,667 --> 01:43:49,667
I guess you can sense

1824
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
that I'm not fine.

1825
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:53,333
Priya, don't worry.

1826
01:43:53,917 --> 01:43:54,917
I am not able toâ€¦

1827
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:56,750
My mind is not at peace.

1828
01:43:57,167 --> 01:43:58,625
Tomorrow, everything
should go well.

1829
01:43:59,292 --> 01:44:00,292
The organ dealer

1830
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:02,250
should properly
arrange everything.

1831
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:04,708
The transplant for my brother
should go well.

1832
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,417
With all these things
running in my mind,

1833
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:08,292
I'm not able to stay normal.

1834
01:44:09,542 --> 01:44:11,167
I don't think
I can stay alone here.

1835
01:44:12,208 --> 01:44:13,208
If you are with me,

1836
01:44:13,417 --> 01:44:14,417
I'll feel better.

1837
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:16,792
Iâ€™ve been feeling the same
way since I dropped you.

1838
01:44:18,042 --> 01:44:19,042
I shouldn't have left you alone.

1839
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:20,208
Iâ€™ll come there right away.

1840
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:22,292
I'll be with you till
everything ends well.

1841
01:44:23,167 --> 01:44:24,167
Okay?

1842
01:44:27,958 --> 01:44:28,958
Thanks, Vikram.

1843
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:35,125
Sir.
- Hey!

1844
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:38,833
Where had you gone?
- My phone fell into the water

1845
01:44:38,917 --> 01:44:41,000
Can't you pick the phone?

1846
01:44:41,292 --> 01:44:43,625
Don't shout without knowing what happened.
- What happened?

1847
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:45,583
Did someone die?
- Worse than that! - What?

1848
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:48,458
I'm using the phone that
fell into a commode.

1849
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:52,375
Alphonseâ€¦
- Look how he is respondingâ€¦

1850
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:54,208
He is screaming at me.
- Ignore him.

1851
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:55,833
Did you trace their location?
- Shall we leave?

1852
01:44:56,708 --> 01:44:57,708
Okay.

1853
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:00,292
AKG service apartment
is Vikram's location.

1854
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:02,333
Vasundhara's phone shows
the same location.

1855
01:45:02,542 --> 01:45:03,542
They must be together.

1856
01:45:03,917 --> 01:45:04,917
Let's go.

1857
01:45:12,917 --> 01:45:13,542
Panju.

1858
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:17,833
Panju.

1859
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:20,458
407.
- Sir.

1860
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:26,458
You seem to be very clear
about what you need.

1861
01:45:26,667 --> 01:45:29,250
I'm the confused one
running after you repeatedly.

1862
01:46:08,542 --> 01:46:10,000
Driver.
Start.

1863
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:13,583
Goâ€¦

1864
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:29,375
Hey!

1865
01:46:29,375 --> 01:46:31,167
She has swept his account clean.

1866
01:46:33,958 --> 01:46:34,958
Thank you.

1867
01:46:46,792 --> 01:46:48,458
She did see us, right?

1868
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:49,750
Yes.

1869
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:51,458
She must have cracked our plan!

1870
01:46:51,958 --> 01:46:52,958
Everythingâ€™s gone!

1871
01:46:53,708 --> 01:46:55,000
Don't unnecessarily get tensed.

1872
01:46:55,292 --> 01:46:56,833
We have to catch her now.
That is important.

1873
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:58,000
Okay.
Goâ€¦

1874
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:02,792
Stop.
- Why are you stopping the car?

1875
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:05,333
Who are you? - Quick.
- Sadhana, go.

1876
01:47:05,542 --> 01:47:07,792
I'm a cop.
We are in a hurry chasing an accused!

1877
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:10,250
I'm a cop.
- This person is seriously injured!

1878
01:47:10,292 --> 01:47:12,792
It's an important case.

1879
01:47:13,292 --> 01:47:15,417
At least tell us where
the hospital is.

1880
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,250
It's within a kilometer.
Go! Go! Go!

1881
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:19,000
Go fast!

1882
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:20,750
Is everything okay, Alphonse?

1883
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:22,875
Yes. But you keep following them properly.

1884
01:47:23,167 --> 01:47:24,208
Madam, speed up.

1885
01:47:24,542 --> 01:47:25,625
Please.

1886
01:47:25,667 --> 01:47:27,667
What's happening there?

1887
01:47:27,917 --> 01:47:29,542
Nothing.
You keep tracking.

1888
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:32,250
He is taking a left.

1889
01:47:32,542 --> 01:47:33,542
Where are you going?

1890
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:35,458
Go straight!
We have almost reached the hospital.

1891
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:39,125
Okay, go.

1892
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,750
Idiots!

1893
01:47:42,458 --> 01:47:44,542
Take a left.
- Shut up.

1894
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:46,625
We are caught up in some issue.
I'll call you again. Hang up.

1895
01:47:48,833 --> 01:47:50,625
Is your phone in
within the network range, Vikram?

1896
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:52,792
Not sure.
Iâ€™ll have to check.

1897
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,917
After Vikram withdraws
money from the bank,

1898
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:13,417
take the Perundurai route.

1899
01:48:14,333 --> 01:48:15,333
After reaching the outskirts,

1900
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:19,208
Take off of the highway and
drive the car into a deserted area.

1901
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:23,000
I'll scream and pretend to be panicking.

1902
01:48:23,208 --> 01:48:24,875
Vikram will get tensed.

1903
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:26,208
Hit him then,

1904
01:48:26,708 --> 01:48:27,708
and push him off the car.

1905
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:30,125
We leave with the money
like it is a kidnap drama.

1906
01:48:30,417 --> 01:48:31,417
We both will escape.

1907
01:48:37,333 --> 01:48:38,333
Driver.

1908
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:39,917
Where are you going?
- What happened?

1909
01:48:40,667 --> 01:48:42,125
Not sure.
He is taking the wrong route.

1910
01:48:42,292 --> 01:48:43,792
Where are you going?
Go back to the main road.

1911
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:45,792
Iâ€™m telling you to turn back!

1912
01:48:46,125 --> 01:48:47,417
Why are you taking
the wrong route?

1913
01:48:49,042 --> 01:48:49,833
Not this hospital.

1914
01:48:50,042 --> 01:48:52,583
Please go straight.
- Are you kidding me?!

1915
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:54,750
Please go straight.
- Don't you want to save him?

1916
01:48:54,958 --> 01:48:55,958
Get down!

1917
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:57,125
Get down!

1918
01:48:57,375 --> 01:48:59,583
Varun, get down.
Sadhana, open the door.

1919
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:02,917
Go straight.

1920
01:49:03,125 --> 01:49:04,125
Who are you guys?!

1921
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,083
Go straight.

1922
01:49:10,292 --> 01:49:11,292
Pick up the phone!

1923
01:49:25,542 --> 01:49:26,542
Varun.
Get in, fast!

1924
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,375
Let's go!

1925
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:28,708
Go!

1926
01:49:28,875 --> 01:49:30,500
Call Alphonse and
find out where she is.

1927
01:49:31,292 --> 01:49:32,292
Panjuâ€¦

1928
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:33,500
Panjuâ€¦

1929
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:34,917
Panju!

1930
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:36,417
What happened?
Drive to a hospital!

1931
01:49:38,292 --> 01:49:39,292
Stop the car!

1932
01:49:39,833 --> 01:49:41,708
Why?
- Do as I say!

1933
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:42,792
Take Panju to the hospital.

1934
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:44,167
And you?

1935
01:49:44,292 --> 01:49:45,875
I have to catch her.
- Are you mad?

1936
01:49:45,917 --> 01:49:46,917
Heyâ€¦

1937
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:53,125
You go.

1938
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:55,125
Sadhana, go!

1939
01:49:58,375 --> 01:49:59,375
Vikram, heâ€¦

1940
01:50:00,333 --> 01:50:01,917
Turn the car back!

1941
01:50:04,667 --> 01:50:06,792
This is Varun.
- How many times do I call you!

1942
01:50:07,042 --> 01:50:09,000
Where are they?
- I'm not able to track either of their numbers.

1943
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,375
Both numbers are switched off.
- Okay.

1944
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,250
Track my number.
- Your number?

1945
01:50:12,292 --> 01:50:13,292
Your number?

1946
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,292
Why are you talking nonsense?

1947
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,917
I said 'track my number.â€™

1948
01:50:23,542 --> 01:50:24,542
Did you?

1949
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:25,792
Yes.

1950
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,583
On Perundurai roadâ€¦

1951
01:50:27,958 --> 01:50:29,458
It is showing some
location off the main road

1952
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,250
You are moving in the right direction.

1953
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:34,500
Priya, what happened?

1954
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:35,625
Vikram!
- Why has he stopped the car?

1955
01:50:35,833 --> 01:50:37,250
I don't know.
- Where are we?

1956
01:50:37,542 --> 01:50:38,542
I've have no clue.
- Priya!

1957
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,083
Priya!
- Leave me!

1958
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:42,833
Leave me!
- Leave her!

1959
01:50:44,125 --> 01:50:45,125
Priya, where are you?

1960
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:46,958
Priya!

1961
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,458
Priya!

1962
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:51,333
Priya, are you there?
Hey, leave her!

1963
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:52,833
Priyaâ€¦

1964
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:00,042
Give that.

1965
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:06,375
Leave her!

1966
01:51:08,833 --> 01:51:09,708
Priya!

1967
01:51:15,167 --> 01:51:16,167
Take all the
money you need.

1968
01:51:16,875 --> 01:51:18,583
Please let her go!

1969
01:51:20,792 --> 01:51:21,792
Priyaâ€¦

1970
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:16,250
You, are one sneaky lady.

1971
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:18,250
A small, loveable vampire.

1972
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:22,208
You are a feisty flood, in a
body that is opaque like glass.

1973
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:24,708
You, are one sneaky lady.

1974
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:26,750
A small, loveable vampire.

1975
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,375
You are a brilliant player,
who plays very casually.

1976
01:52:31,208 --> 01:52:32,875
Oh, youâ€¦ Smart, sneaky girl!

1977
01:52:33,292 --> 01:52:35,083
Oh, youâ€¦ Smart, sneaky girl!

1978
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:36,292
Oh, youâ€¦ Smart, sneaky girl!

1979
01:52:38,792 --> 01:52:39,792
Leave.

1980
01:52:41,292 --> 01:52:42,292
Leave that.

1981
01:55:41,667 --> 01:55:42,667
Do you love her very much?

1982
01:55:47,542 --> 01:55:49,208
It is said 'Love is blind.â€™

1983
01:55:50,167 --> 01:55:51,625
She looted us all, taking
advantage of that.

1984
01:55:55,792 --> 01:55:57,542
Don't get fooled by such women.

1985
01:56:15,167 --> 01:56:16,917
Tie it properlyâ€¦
What are you doing?

1986
01:56:20,542 --> 01:56:22,625
By deceiving visually
challenged people with love,

1987
01:56:22,792 --> 01:56:23,792
Vasundhara, who has been charged

1988
01:56:23,917 --> 01:56:25,417
with financial forgery

1989
01:56:25,625 --> 01:56:27,708
is being investigated
by the police.

1990
01:56:27,958 --> 01:56:30,167
We chased Vasundhara for many
days regarding this case.

1991
01:56:30,458 --> 01:56:33,417
We are collecting the details of
the money lost by the victims.

1992
01:56:33,833 --> 01:56:35,667
What a man!

1993
01:56:44,083 --> 01:56:45,250
Thank you very much.

1994
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,333
Your news has taken over
every news channel.

1995
01:56:49,667 --> 01:56:51,417
You are the pride
of our district!

1996
01:56:51,542 --> 01:56:53,000
Thank you.
- Congrats, constable sir.

1997
01:56:53,333 --> 01:56:54,750
Thank you, Sir.
Super, dude!

1998
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:56,500
One cop like you in a town is enough

1999
01:56:56,875 --> 01:56:58,250
to stop fraudsters.

2000
01:56:58,292 --> 01:57:00,000
Thank you.
- You are great!

2001
01:57:00,417 --> 01:57:02,750
Is it your felicitation ceremony or mine?

2002
01:57:04,292 --> 01:57:06,708
You have achieved a great thing.

2003
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:10,708
Youâ€™ve got all the accolades that I
should have for my service for 37 years of service today!

2004
01:57:11,208 --> 01:57:12,000
Sirâ€¦

2005
01:57:12,042 --> 01:57:14,667
I just did my job.
People giving the praiseâ€¦

2006
01:57:15,792 --> 01:57:20,208
The photos of the victims have been
recovered from Vasundhara's phone.

2007
01:57:22,083 --> 01:57:23,625
Is that you?

2008
01:57:26,917 --> 01:57:27,917
That is definitely you!

2009
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,167
Why would you take a picture
that close to her!

2010
01:57:32,333 --> 01:57:33,333
Dearâ€¦

2011
01:57:33,667 --> 01:57:35,458
She is already jailed.

2012
01:57:36,125 --> 01:57:37,292
Your anger still not subsided?!

2013
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:56,458
Varun, I'm coming for you.

2014
01:58:54,542 --> 01:58:55,542
