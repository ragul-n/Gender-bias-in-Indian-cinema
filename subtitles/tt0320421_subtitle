Sir! That building is No.44
and this is No. 46!

55
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:48,593
So this should be No.45!
Everybody searched this only!

56
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,697
Did everybody come
for the interview?

57
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,839
That Babu export company...?
We didn't see that company!

58
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,039
No sir! lf it is No.45,

00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:01,446

63
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:26,209
Boon! That's all! Did you
send the application for 20 Rs?

64
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:29,874
See here man!
This is very injustice!

65
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:32,447
1000 Rs for advertisment
and 2000 Rs for application form!

66
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,073
They had spent 3000 Rs totally!

67
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:36,276
Other expenses is 2000 Rs!
What calculation is this?

68
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,447
Sir! They had spent 5000 Rs

69
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:49,224
Get some other job and

Ok! That kumar! What he is doing?

73
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:04,605
He went to Coimbatore!
He too didn't get job like me!

74
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:09,281
He won't bother about job!
Because he has money!

75
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,378
Do we have that?

76
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:15,950

78
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,394
Then what? Will the
mosaic stone be there?

79
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:26,960
We can eat rice without
stone only if he earns money!

80
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:30,338
He knows to blame others.
But he is not eligible to get a job!

81
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:33,534
l didn't tell anything! lf l ask,
no recommentation & no money...

82
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:36,544
No luck to me!
You'll give excuses like these!

83
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,973
You are thinking that
he'll take care of our family...

84
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,844
He'll do Sudha marriage...

85
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:48,413
You believe that he'll give dowry
money to my elder daughter Radha!

86
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,922
We won't get a single
paise even if we sell him!

87
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:55,691
But he is telling that
l am very cruel and all!

88
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,767
He is going to...

89
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:04,433
lf l tell anything, he'll
get angry immediately!

90
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:09,305
Man! lf you don't like my
cooking, throw it in the dust bin!

91
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,447
Don't make me to take your plate!

93
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:56,148
Mudaliyar! What is this?
Everything is wrong!

94
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:59,558
Didn't you prepare the statement?
l'll prepare the statement today!

95
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:02,324
l forgot to take the ledger book
yesterday! You'll forget a thing!

96
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:03,558
You'll do another mistake!

97
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,895
You've become old, haven't you?
Your vision is becoming dull!

98
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:08,027
Why are you keeping the specs
in your hands? Wear it!

99
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:10,540
Why are you giving trobule to me?

100
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,164
Forgive me this time only!

101
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,209

00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,305
Can l beat you, then?

104
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,317
My dad recommended you
at the time of his death!

105
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:26,747
Mudaliyar! Resign this job! Boss!

106
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,950
Don't tell like that! lf my son gets a job...

107
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:31,993
l won't have any worries after that!

108
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:33,324
l'll resign the job!

109
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,867
Yes man! l'd bear your mistake
until your generation gets a job!

110
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:41,404

00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:43,664
Lot of dusts on the dust bin!

112
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,603
Sweeper didn't come today!

113
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:47,503
Why don't you clean it?

114
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:50,944
Are you thinking this as a
dishonor to you? Not like that sir!

115
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:08,796
Give this to my dad!

116
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,794
Don't tell about my arrival!

117
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,439
Come man! Did you come?

118
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:21,468
Go man! We'd do this work

119

Ok! Do it! lf we don't go to

Our parents will make us to

121
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:32,410
Why are you telling

00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:49,267
Do you want this? Bribe man!

123

Bribe...? That is money!

124
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:54,440
What money sir?

125
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,678
Are you trying to cheat me?

126
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:02,181
Who are you sir? Why do
l want to give money to you?

127
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:05,249
Are you from Government
or Corporation?

128
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:10,292
He is talking too much!
We'd teach him!

129
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,562

Did you leave your anger?
Come! Let's go home!

136

Man! Come! Somebody is fighting!
Why do you bother about that?

137
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,528
Man! lf we didn't stop that,
do you know what would have happened?

138
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:38,801
Murder might have taken place!
Why do you bother about somebody?

139
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:40,532
Ok! Come lets go!

140
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,646

Nothing! A free place is
there near our shop!

337
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,545
The problem is there is a
police station near that!

338
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:32,149
lf you get me that place,
businness will go very well!

339
00:36:32,594 --> 00:36:36,655
Ok man! This is time of
election. So leave that matter!

340
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:39,961
Because if we talk secretly,
it'll come in loud speaker!

l think that you don't have
anybody to do like that!

00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:41,385
That's why l came here
to do your funeral!

348
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:45,032

Greets to everybody! l don't know

Particularly l don't know to

356
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:35,500
Don't know to act on the
stage! l know only...!

357
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:38,737
Our heart should be clean
and our duties should be clean!

358
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:42,007
We'd have justice
in our duties! What?

Everything should be
justice! Believing our party...

We'd do our duties
to our people!

361

Greets brother!
Are you fine?

362
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:11,473
We shouldn't cheat our people!

l don't know to talk
above this! That's why...!

364
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,115

375
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:06,426
lf that Dhandabany comes...

376
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:08,501
People gave respect to him &
they didn't listen your speech!

377
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:11,538
l don't like that! l am feeling very much!

You didn't give the chance to others!

Dhandapany told this in committee!

386

He can tell! All the committee
members are in my pocket!

387

00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:56,324
With that Naidu...?

502
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,962
He is that Dhandapany's man!

503
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:03,260
What did l suspect is correct!

504
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:07,036
Today is his birth day!
He is cutting! Wait man!

505
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:09,041
Only one piece is big!

506
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:14,610
Birthday is for you only!
We should sing!

507
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:25,752
Enough! To me!

508
00:50:25,893 --> 00:50:28,691
He had hit my nose with spoon!
l thought that as Vada!

509
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,921
Don't you know the difference
between Vada and nose?

510
00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:33,598
Vada has a hole!

511
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:35,461
Nose too has hole!

512
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:59,282
Sathya! Give 50 paise!
For what? Greets!

513
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,792
Thank you! For what?
She is coming!

514
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,490
Where? Who? Why are
you hurrying? She'll come!

515
00:51:09,704 --> 00:51:11,604
Sing Santha! Sing!

516
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:20,511
Daughter-in-law! Daughter-in-law!
Daughter-in-law! Bride! Come! Man!

517
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:24,574
Did he get 50 paise
for this? He is waste! Man!

518
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,681
This is my seat!
You can sit there! Man!

519
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:34,454
Give place to her! Sit down!

520
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:39,826
Daughter-in-law! Bride! Come!
Here sir! One tea & four glasses!

521
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,565
Drink tea! To you people!

522
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:48,902
We drank now only!
Sister-in-law! Drink the tea!

523
00:51:52,513 --> 00:51:54,037
We've folded our legs!

524
00:51:54,148 --> 00:51:57,777
You don't mistake! He will hit
us like this always!

525
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:01,480
He will feel shy! You don't mistake
him! Drink tea! Sister-in-law?

526
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:03,250
lf my brother is Raman,
you are Seetha!

527
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:06,088
ls it! Sathya! Stop!
Where are you going?

528
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,290
Stop man! Man! Brother! Stop!

529
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:13,922
Come! Come and sit near
my sister-in-law!

530
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:15,830
Laxmana! You keep quiet!

531
00:52:24,145 --> 00:52:26,375
You are very naughty!

532
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,208
Oh God!

533
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,682
Go dear! Janaki! Drink tea!

534
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:37,314
This is Ayothiya super dust tea!

535
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,050
You can't get this in Midhilai too!

536
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:41,418
Dear! Forgive me!

537
00:52:41,595 --> 00:52:45,622
l don't want this! Dear!
What do you want, then?

538
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:50,732
There! That deer!

539
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:53,965
Oh God!

540
00:52:57,611 --> 00:53:02,571
Why are you laughing like this?
No! You told as Seetha & Raman!

541
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:05,049
l imagined all of you in that appearance!

542
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:08,853
My brother is Raman, isn't it?
Who is Hanuman, then?

543
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:10,321
Birthday boy! lt's you!
You are that Hanuman!

544
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:16,155
My friends spoke very much!
Don't mistake them!

545
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:18,128
What's wrong in that?
They spoke very well!

546
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:22,168
We are meeting 2nd day.
But they should not call you as sister-in-law!

547
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:24,100
Can they talk after 10 days?

548
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:27,096
Won't it to be a honor?

549
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:28,469
8 days are there!

550
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:33,302
Dad! How are you dad?

551
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:36,347
How are you dear? l am fine!

552
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:38,848
How is Sudha and brother?

553
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,248
l have brought sweet
and flowers to you!

554
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:46,926
Here! What is the need of this?

555
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:49,256
Come inside dad! Stop
for few seconds!

556
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,331
What parcel is this?
Did you bring money? No!

557
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,832
Some sweet and flowers! Then!

558
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:57,768
You didn't bring money!
You came with empty hands! Man!

559
00:53:57,872 --> 00:53:59,362
You told that you'd give money
by last month, didn't you?

560
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:02,541
See here! We are not asking simply!

561
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:04,804
We are asking our dowry money!

562
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:07,106
We are asking that from you only!

563
00:54:08,115 --> 00:54:10,174
What groom? Are you fine?

564
00:54:10,284 --> 00:54:12,684
Come uncle! Come! Man! Go inside!

565
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:17,718
l didn't tell that l would not give!

566
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:19,554
l can't give now!

567
00:54:19,693 --> 00:54:20,853
Then do a thing!

568
00:54:21,162 --> 00:54:24,154
Your daughter can stay in your
home until you give our money!

569
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:26,766
Oh! Don't tell like that!

570
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:30,868
See Mudaliyar! lf you don't give
money within 10 days...

571
00:54:30,971 --> 00:54:33,030
Your daughter will come
to your home!

572
00:54:33,174 --> 00:54:35,836
You can't come here,
then! Be careful!

573
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:39,504
Not only that Mudaliyar!
Dowry balance is 15000 Rs!

574
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:44,380
lnterest and including everything...

575
00:54:44,485 --> 00:54:45,713
Totally 20000 Rs!

576
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,947
Give that and you can go!

577
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:53,052
Dad! Dad!

578
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:06,971
We'll do prayer before
we take food!

579
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:10,407
No! That's a good habit!

580
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:11,943
Whether we get anything
by prayer or not...

581
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:17,985
Acids in our stomach...

582
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:25,052
What's your profession,
Sathya? l'm a member of J.S.S!

583
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:29,357
J.S.S? What's that?
Political party? No!

584
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,871
What do you think
about Geetha?

585
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:51,076
Good imagination talent!
Then...? That is all!

586
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:56,383
l know that much! lf l move,
l'll know beyond this too!

587
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,658
Did you hear his word's?
Naughty man!

588
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,763
But we should think about him!

589
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:12,669
You told as love! lf he
tells like that...

590
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:20,745
You chase somebody
for marriage!

591
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:32,318
l won't compel her! l too have
dignity! l'm also a respectable son!

592
00:56:32,493 --> 00:56:36,953
l don't have job! That's all!
What else lacks for me?

593
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:42,798
Are you a Malayali, Sathya?

594
00:56:43,103 --> 00:56:48,302
Palakadu! No...? How do
you know Malayalam, then?

595
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:52,243
l know Malayalam & sister's
mind too! What do you know?

596
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:56,406
Sister likes me! Though sister
is thinking about a matter!

597
00:56:56,784 --> 00:56:58,479
Don't think too much!

598
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:07,327
Let him be! You're worrying
for this and all!

599
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:12,195
Won't l kill him? Sir! Didn't you
see new duplicate labels?

600
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:14,557
Show the labels that we
receive in the morning!

601
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,669
See these are too good than
the original labels!

602
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:23,174
Color to is... What is his anme?
Sathya!

603
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:29,972
Yesterday too... Seenathana!
l'd like to see him immediately!

604
00:57:30,084 --> 00:57:35,989
Ok? Ok sir? What man? You're
sticking the lable wrongly!

605
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:38,886
Stock is duplicate! Why don't
you stick this atleast correctly?

606
00:57:39,026 --> 00:57:40,891
Everybody is going to go
to prison, then!

607
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:44,459
Why do you come with me?
Why? Shouldn't l come?

608
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:49,126
Won't sister search you?
What time you told her?

609
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:53,070
l can go at any time! Sister
knows well that l'll be with you!

610
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:57,337
lf you're there with me, can you
go at any time? Go after a month!

611
00:57:58,445 --> 00:58:02,848
What's there for a month?
Tell me! l'll be with you until my death!

612
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:51,560
Bangle is singing song!
Cold breeze too is blowing!

613
00:58:51,765 --> 00:58:58,500
My fingers are shivering sometimes!
My body is getting disturbed!

614
00:58:58,572 --> 00:59:02,167
This young girl is not a girl!
She is a flower garden!

615
00:59:02,242 --> 00:59:06,508
Play the love orchestra!
Here is a love procession!

616

My fingers are shivering sometimes!
My body is getting disturbed!

00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:03,124
My eyes will send a love letter!

619
01:00:03,203 --> 01:00:07,037
l'll get a wish of seeing you!

620
01:00:07,141 --> 01:00:11,009
Your sights towards me
will become like flowers!

621
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:14,775
lt will become thrones that
hurts in my heart!

622
01:00:14,848 --> 01:00:21,947
Dear! Wounds that you got
my sight will get cured by my touch!

623
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:29,554
My fair body will starve for
the day, when l will join you!

624
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:36,900
Bangle is singing song!
Cold breeze too is blowing!

01:02:05,692 --> 01:02:12,825
Bangle is singing song!
Cold breeze too is blowing!

My fingers are shivering

639
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:42,512
He is not there here! See
Sathya's friend is coming by cycle!

640
01:03:52,733 --> 01:03:55,793
Whoever may be Sathya's
man! Murder him!

641
01:05:32,899 --> 01:05:35,868
Sathya! lt's me!

642
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:42,300
Your friend Sundar... Sorry!
Relatives only will say sorry!

643
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:44,097
lT's enough if policemen
do their duty!

644
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:48,365
You didn't find the murderers yet!
lt's 3 days since this took place!

645
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:53,374
Do you have any doubt
in our actions?

646
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:12,895
Where are you taking me?
You! Come here, man!

647
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:19,370
They were there in incident
place! We arrested them!

648
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:23,475
But they are innocents until
we get witnesses!

649
01:07:24,911 --> 01:07:29,541
Hold him! Sir! Call my
advocate! Advocate... Rascal!

650
01:07:31,117 --> 01:07:35,053
Didn't you get witness or
nobody is giving witness? Both!

651
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:39,317
But 1 witness... l'll turn
them into pieces!

652
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:45,893
lf l bring that witness...
Go! l'll do my duty at that time!

653
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,110
Our Sundar used to buy things
in your shop! He helped you!

654
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:09,581
People killed him! You come &
show the murderers!

655
01:08:09,656 --> 01:08:11,954
Brother! He is no more now!

656
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:16,654
Will your Sundar come back
by finding the murderers?

657
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:22,098
Not that! Our boy! lt tok place here!
You saw that person!

658
01:08:22,235 --> 01:08:26,194
You come & tell to police!
Nothing will take place! Leave me!

of incidents my job?

660
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,510
Leave away!

661
01:08:37,517 --> 01:08:40,782
What your son is studying?
Send him to me! Sivaprakash sir!

662
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:45,482
You're a teacher! You'll teach
your students to tell truth!

663
01:08:45,692 --> 01:08:48,786
Come sir! Our Sundar! Come to
police station! Don't fear!

664
01:08:48,928 --> 01:08:51,055
l don't fear! l will come!

665
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:54,029
l understand your problem!
But l went to the school on that day!

666
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,560
l heard that some incident
took place in street after that!

667
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:00,204
Did you go to school on that day?

668
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:06,541
That was Sunday! Sunday...
Don't lie! Go man!

669
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:16,414
All of you watch this! But nobody
come & give witness!

670
01:09:17,424 --> 01:09:21,554
Why man? Come man! l didn't see!
Didn't see! Nobody knows!

671
01:09:21,795 --> 01:09:24,229
What Nair? Didn't you too see?
l don't know!

672
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:29,768
Your shop is here! Bridge
is here! Come & tell, man!

673
01:09:29,869 --> 01:09:33,566
Leave me! Nair! l didn't see!

674
01:09:33,707 --> 01:09:36,801
Don't we have any other job?
Go man!

675
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:44,378
Run off & get hidden!
Or the truth will hurt you!

676
01:09:46,653 --> 01:09:51,454
You people used to tell
many stories about witness!

677
01:09:51,558 --> 01:09:54,891
Come to give witness!
One person!

678
01:09:55,095 --> 01:09:59,332
You people are not humans!
You people are idiots!

679
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:03,462
Dead bodies! Somebody...

680
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:43,229
Leave me, man! Who is
creating problem in the street?

681
01:11:55,515 --> 01:11:57,881
Come Naidu sir! Sit!
lt's ok! You sit!

682
01:11:58,184 --> 01:12:01,950
Why did you come here?
l've come to take our man in bail!

683
01:12:02,088 --> 01:12:04,921
ls he our man? Yes! Sir too
has come! Has our sir too come?

684
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:09,392
Ask him to come! Send our
man first! Ashok! Leave him soon!

685
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:14,793
Come out! You'd come as
soon as they open!

686
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:19,001
Sathya! Do you think how
do we know about your state?

687
01:12:19,172 --> 01:12:22,073
That is Naidu! Sir has come
to see you!

688
01:12:22,275 --> 01:12:26,405
Who's that? Dhandapany sir!
Have they torn it?

689
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:31,380
Who has torn it? l didn't tear!
lt was like this only! Come!

690
01:12:32,118 --> 01:12:35,451
Good thing only will happen!
Or will sir come searching you?

691
01:12:35,622 --> 01:12:38,955
Luck only! What's your zodiac?
l don't know! Ok! Leave it!

692
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:49,857
Greets! l'm Dhandapany! l worry
in meeting you in this state!

693
01:12:50,536 --> 01:12:53,835
l wanted to meet you many times!
But you didn't come!

694
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:06,742
Your friend late... Sundar! What
will be his age, sir?

695
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:11,851
He is my age boy, sir!

696
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:17,053
ls this an age of dying? Let's
talk about this later!

697
01:13:17,163 --> 01:13:24,069
You'd come out first! l've told
Naidu about your bail and all!

698
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:27,300
Naidu is our man!

699
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:34,012
Don't worry! Good people
won't get danger ever!

700
01:13:40,286 --> 01:13:42,584
l am leaving!

701
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:51,288
Can l ask at least now? Blamming
others is easy! Proving...

702
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:54,995
For what you should involve
in violence?

703
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:59,197
There's reason! lf anybody kills
your friend, will you be calm?

704
01:13:59,339 --> 01:14:05,039
lf anybody kills your sister,
will you get convinced with them?

705
01:14:05,411 --> 01:14:09,074
l can't bear! Sundar was
talking with me until yesterday!

706
01:14:09,182 --> 01:14:11,082
He's there in Krishnapet
as an ash today!

707
01:14:11,784 --> 01:14:13,718
l can't keep quiet!

708
01:14:17,056 --> 01:14:22,790
l'm not a wood! l am an
animal that has feelings!

709
01:14:33,406 --> 01:14:34,805
Who is that?

710
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:46,479
Mother! Radha! What dear?
What happened?

711
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:50,318
Why there are wounds in your
body? Why did you come now?

712
01:14:50,423 --> 01:14:55,952
Sister! What happened?
What dear? What happened?

713
01:14:56,195 --> 01:15:00,495
They've beaten me & sent out
me from their house! Why? Mom!

714
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:04,194
They are torturing me
asking money!

715
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:10,231
l can't bear that, mom!

716
01:15:11,244 --> 01:15:17,149
Our God has come! You've come
before my daughter's death!

717
01:15:19,786 --> 01:15:22,755
lS the insult that you got
us enough?

718
01:15:22,955 --> 01:15:30,327
Why do you torture us? We wanted
to live with honor!

719
01:15:30,696 --> 01:15:34,097
But you've spoiled our honor!

720
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:42,569
Please go off! lf he stays here,
we should commit suicide!

721
01:15:42,742 --> 01:15:46,974
What's the use by him? Brother!
Why do you start now itself?

722
01:15:47,046 --> 01:15:51,346
Are you supporting him?
Brother!

723
01:15:51,451 --> 01:15:56,946
Arrange for the money, brother!
l can't bear their torture!

724
01:15:57,023 --> 01:16:01,084
We'd die before he arranges
the money!

725
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:06,461
Dad has told him to go out!
He'd have sense to understand!

726
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:15,270
Brother! Listen to me!
Don't go out!

727
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,401
l was coming to your
home searching you!

728
01:16:47,607 --> 01:16:51,976
l don't have a house now!

729
01:16:53,346 --> 01:16:55,473
Have they sent you out
from the house?

730
01:16:56,682 --> 01:17:00,311
lt's ok, Sathya! That too
is good for a thing!

731
01:17:00,953 --> 01:17:05,014
This is not your room!
My house! Come!

732
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:10,628
Why do you see?
Our principle & way are same!

733
01:17:10,796 --> 01:17:13,356
Let our house too
be the same!

734
01:17:17,837 --> 01:17:21,170
There's an enemy for
both of us! Who is that?

735
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:28,807
Criminal... Shall l tell
you little clearly?

736
01:17:29,081 --> 01:17:35,111
This area M.L.A Mariappa was the
cause for your friend's death!

737
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:38,256
Nobody has guts to oppose him!
l'm ready to oppose him, Sathya!

738
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:41,889
But l am not young! You are
young! That's why l am asking you!

739
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,987
Come with me! Do it thinking
this as a social service!

740
01:17:45,398 --> 01:17:49,232
Service is... Ok! Don't think
this as a social service!

741
01:17:49,335 --> 01:17:53,431
Do it as a work! Do it
as a principle!

742
01:17:53,773 --> 01:17:57,038
Do it as a duty for
your friend Sundar!

743
01:18:12,959 --> 01:18:20,559
Come! lt's ok! Wear
the slipper! Come!

744
01:18:22,468 --> 01:18:28,771
How is it? Your house...?
This is your house, Sathya!

745
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:34,814
Yes! You're going to stay here
only! Where are you going?

746
01:18:34,814 --> 01:18:37,408
Come on!

747
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:43,753
This is your house!
Sit down! l'll sit! You sit!

748
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:49,356
An important matter! Tell me!

749
01:18:49,495 --> 01:18:53,466
l arranged some people
for your protection! Why?

750
01:18:53,466 --> 01:18:59,962
Don't ask me why! Mariappan's
men won't trouble you!

751
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:01,973
l've arranged them to avoid the risk!

752
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:11,881
Do you need anything else?
No sir! Tell me! Nothing sir!

753
01:19:12,718 --> 01:19:16,210
No sir! You're not telling keeping
something in your mind!

754
01:19:16,422 --> 01:19:19,550
Tell me!

755
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:31,593
Money...? How much do
you need? My sister's dowry...

756
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:41,504
Tell me, man! 20...
Ok! Sir! 20000 Rs! Ok man!

757
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:45,843
Give me 20000 Rs!

758
01:19:52,558 --> 01:20:01,728
ls that correct? lt's correct!
Sir! How can l... lt's not a credit!

759
01:20:01,834 --> 01:20:06,703
l accept it as a credit! l know
how to get back this from you!

760
01:20:07,206 --> 01:20:10,903
lf you don't know to
thank me, leave it!

761
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,442
What's this? l gave
credit to Sathya!

762
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:25,386
l'll trouble you to return it!
What man? Take rest!

763
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:28,621
l'm leaving! You stay here!
l'm leaving!

764
01:20:38,337 --> 01:20:42,330
You...? What's the matter?
Money matter! Sister matter!

765
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,973
You'd give money to leave
your sister! Do you know?

766
01:20:46,078 --> 01:20:50,515
l know! What? Keep quiet!
Have you brought money?

767
01:20:50,716 --> 01:20:53,344
l told you already that
brother would bring money!

768
01:20:53,419 --> 01:20:59,983
When? l told! My pant is
tight! Can you collect it?

769
01:21:00,192 --> 01:21:04,060
Collect it! You too come!
You too help her!

770
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:08,890
Will you leave me the way?
Go carefully dear!

771
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:12,595
You'd not stamp the money!
lt's God! Go dear!

772
01:21:24,483 --> 01:21:27,714
l'd like to talk to groom!
Talk! Go man!

773
01:21:27,853 --> 01:21:30,287
Give me that too!

774
01:21:30,856 --> 01:21:37,455
l'd break the bones of mother,
father & son for asking dowry!

775
01:21:37,596 --> 01:21:41,032
Right or wrong! My dad
promised! So l've brought money!

776
01:21:42,635 --> 01:21:49,939
She's your house girl hereafter!
lf she comes with tears...

777
01:21:51,277 --> 01:21:55,236
l won't worry even if she becomes
a widow! Ok! l understand!

778
01:21:55,414 --> 01:21:58,872
You've given the money,
haven't you? Today is our 1st night!

779
01:21:59,151 --> 01:22:03,645
Dear! Do you want to have
something? No! You talk!

780
01:22:03,823 --> 01:22:12,060
Collect it! l can't bear their
trouble! We'll run separate family!

781
01:22:15,801 --> 01:22:20,966
Start a life! There's no wrong!
Brother!

782
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:27,040
Mom told them as my parents,
when l came to this home!

783
01:22:27,246 --> 01:22:29,043
l to think like that only!

784
01:22:30,749 --> 01:22:34,549
They have wish on money!
But they are very good!

785
01:22:35,054 --> 01:22:40,754
Old people! l can't go
leaving them alone!

786
01:22:40,993 --> 01:22:44,759
l don't need to run separate
family! Tell him!

787
01:22:44,997 --> 01:22:46,624
He will listen to you!

788
01:22:56,208 --> 01:23:02,636
Take care of her! Not
impossible! Don't tell like that, sir!

789
01:23:02,882 --> 01:23:07,216
Sudha & l... See! We don't
need policemen's matter!

790
01:23:07,586 --> 01:23:12,080
You get inside! There's Sudha's
betrothal within 2 days!

791
01:23:12,224 --> 01:23:17,059
Don't spoil her life in the
name of love now!

792
01:23:17,463 --> 01:23:20,921
l beg you! Don't
compel us, dear!

793
01:23:21,033 --> 01:23:25,094
Please go off from this place!
How many times l'd tell you!

794
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:29,503
Everybody is coming to
my home! Go idiots!

795
01:23:29,608 --> 01:23:31,769
They have no sense!

796
01:23:38,684 --> 01:23:42,916
Brother! There's my betrothal
by tonight with our uncle's son!

797
01:23:43,088 --> 01:23:48,390
You know about me! l need
your help to get my lover!

798
01:23:48,494 --> 01:23:51,520
When did she give this letter?
Before an hour...

799
01:23:51,597 --> 01:23:56,261
She was fearing a lot! Problem...?
Great problem!

800
01:23:56,368 --> 01:23:59,303
No! You drink & then go!
Sathya! l need a small help!

801
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:02,167
Ok! You go! l'll tell later!
No! You tell me!

802
01:24:02,374 --> 01:24:05,605
Mom's health is not good!
There's finance problem in my home!

803
01:24:06,812 --> 01:24:09,337
l don't need money!
Get me a job, man!

804
01:24:09,415 --> 01:24:17,117
Job...? Ok! You do a thing!
Come after 4 days!

805
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:20,920
Remember the name Naidu!
He only got me this job!

806
01:24:21,327 --> 01:24:24,956
l'd go immediately! Shall
l come to help you, man?

807
01:24:26,298 --> 01:24:30,701
l don't need this! You'd
not tell! Go after eating this!

808
01:25:00,165 --> 01:25:01,894
Brother!

809
01:25:04,603 --> 01:25:07,800
This marriage is taking place
without your consent, isn't it?

810
01:25:08,607 --> 01:25:12,805
For what you've come here?
To stop your crime!

811
01:25:12,878 --> 01:25:16,041
Betrothal is going to take
place now! Don't stand here! Go out!

812
01:25:16,849 --> 01:25:23,880
l'll go! Man! What? Do you think
that there is none to ask you?

813
01:25:24,056 --> 01:25:29,084
Keep your rowdism in the road!
lf you show that to me...

814
01:25:30,562 --> 01:25:35,022
Don't ask me like this in
front of these people!

815
01:25:35,267 --> 01:25:38,930
lf l do anything, there won't
be respect for your age!

816
01:25:44,543 --> 01:25:47,979
Everybody is seeing sight!
My daughter is keep on going there!

817
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,071
What man? Did you think
that there is no brave man here?

818
01:25:50,182 --> 01:25:53,674
Ask him to leave her! Sudha!
Listen to your dad!

819
01:25:53,752 --> 01:25:57,244
Tell him! What dear? You're
standing simply! She's going!

820
01:25:57,322 --> 01:26:00,120
Ask her to wait! Ask her to leave him!

821
01:26:02,194 --> 01:26:04,492
Listen to your mom! Don't
go trusting that rowdy!

822
01:26:04,563 --> 01:26:07,031
Come! She's not listening to me!

823
01:26:07,132 --> 01:26:09,794
My daughter is going!
Everybody is seeing!

824
01:26:09,902 --> 01:26:12,166
Call my daughter!
What dear? Sudha!

825
01:26:46,105 --> 01:26:48,471
Have you married
your lover? Thank you brother!

826
01:26:48,674 --> 01:26:52,075
Why do you thank me?
Thank to our dad! Yes!

827
01:26:52,177 --> 01:26:55,078
lf he had told me, l'd have
left you there itself!

828
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:59,173
He's the elder! He blessed
you through his silence only!

829
01:26:59,685 --> 01:27:05,214
You'd thank him! Go & see him!
He'll scold me! No brother!

830
01:27:05,324 --> 01:27:08,259
He has great affection on you!
But he fears to tell!

831
01:27:08,427 --> 01:27:10,258
Please go & see him, brother!

832
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:18,534
What a typing is this? ldiotic!
You have a long years service!

833
01:27:18,637 --> 01:27:21,731
Tell me, man! Nearly 30
years! 30 years!

834
01:27:21,874 --> 01:27:24,968
What a typing is this for
your service? without space...

835
01:27:25,277 --> 01:27:28,007
Why do you kill me?
Are you doing each job twice?

836
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:32,344
l asked Sethu to get me
soda! Ask him to get me soon!

837
01:27:42,997 --> 01:27:46,023
Sir asked you to go home!

838
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:50,127
Give me the soda! No sir!
He asked you to go home!

839
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:53,069
You go! Come tomorrow!
Ok sir!

840
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:01,981
Where's soda? From how long
the glass is empty? Pour man!

841
01:28:07,155 --> 01:28:09,350
Senseless Sethu!
What a matter...

842
01:28:10,425 --> 01:28:13,223
Where is Sethu?
He didn't come! Who are you?

843
01:28:13,428 --> 01:28:16,693
Sethu's relative!
Ok leave! l'd close the shop!

844
01:28:17,065 --> 01:28:19,829
Go man! l'd close
the shop! Let me close!

845
01:28:21,836 --> 01:28:23,531
What are you doing?

846
01:28:24,472 --> 01:28:29,569
Who are you, man?
Don't beat me!

847
01:28:29,644 --> 01:28:33,671
Don't take that paint box!
lt's paining! Don't beat me, man!

848
01:28:33,748 --> 01:28:37,343
Don't push that shelf, man!

849
01:28:37,418 --> 01:28:43,050
Don't take that paint box!
lt's paining! Don't beat me, man!

850
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,926
Waht sir? You've made me
to get hanged like this!

851
01:28:48,463 --> 01:28:52,263
You asked the reason!
Shall l tell? Tell me!

852
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:56,528
Do you know Rajaratnam Mudaliar?
Yes! My worker! Why?

853
01:28:56,671 --> 01:29:03,270
He's my dad! No! Why?
Tell me his name!

854
01:29:05,713 --> 01:29:12,243
No! Mr. Rev. Rajaratname Mudaliar!
lf you had told this already...

855
01:29:12,353 --> 01:29:16,221
...there would not be this
much expenses! l didn't know this!

856
01:29:16,357 --> 01:29:18,825
l didn't know that he has
such a young son!

857
01:29:18,893 --> 01:29:25,765
l know his 2 daughters!
They're like my sisters! He's like my dad!

858
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:31,464
You're like my brother!
lf you want to break anything else, do it!

859
01:29:32,073 --> 01:29:34,439
l to can't bear it!
Shall l leave?

860
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:37,739
Allow me, man!
Thanks a lot! You leave, sir!

861
01:29:38,213 --> 01:29:42,809
Go making me to
come down! Why should l do so?

862
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:46,478
lt's wall, isn't it?
Get down, man!

863
01:29:58,466 --> 01:30:04,200
Mother! Sir!

864
01:30:04,339 --> 01:30:09,174
What happened?
lt's paining! Don't touch me!

865
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:11,938
You come! You don't
touch anything! Here is the chair!

866
01:30:12,614 --> 01:30:15,242
Come! You come
calmly! Sit down!

867
01:30:15,383 --> 01:30:18,152
You sit down!
You need not work in this shop!

868
01:30:18,152 --> 01:30:21,485
Sit! You're like
my dad! No! You're my dad!

869
01:30:21,623 --> 01:30:24,148
Sit! You're standing!
Sit down!

870
01:30:24,225 --> 01:30:27,285
You need not do any work
in this shop! Come in the morning!

871
01:30:27,428 --> 01:30:29,259
Sit simply &
go back in the evening!

872
01:30:29,397 --> 01:30:34,130
Oh! Sit down! Sethu!
Bring a tea for dad, man!

873
01:30:34,202 --> 01:30:39,504
Dad! Sir! You should
not do like this, sir!

874
01:30:47,248 --> 01:30:51,309
What do you see?
Everybody can't become rich!

875
01:30:51,753 --> 01:30:54,881
Everybody can't become
poor too for equality!

876
01:30:55,223 --> 01:30:59,489
We can control the criminals &
we can reduce the poverty little bit!

877
01:30:59,627 --> 01:31:05,691
What can we do beyond that?
ls this like the stage speech?

878
01:31:07,735 --> 01:31:12,570
That is my weakness!
This Pradeep is a great body builder!

879
01:31:12,707 --> 01:31:17,303
He will do anything if l say!
He will kill everybody immediately!

880
01:31:17,545 --> 01:31:22,346
l have 100's of peopl
like this! That is useless, Sathya!

881
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:27,487
People, who act thinking deeply
is needed for our group!

882
01:31:28,523 --> 01:31:31,788
This Andhra liquor...

883
01:31:32,694 --> 01:31:37,131
l asked from how many days
Mariappa smuggles Andhra liquor!

884
01:31:37,231 --> 01:31:41,190
That takes place from many years!
Are you thinking about that?

885
01:31:41,536 --> 01:31:47,202
We can't do that anything!
Why do you laugh?

886
01:31:47,308 --> 01:31:50,607
Nothing! l thought about
a thief's state after getting caught!

887
01:31:56,584 --> 01:32:00,611
Stop the lorry, man! ldiot!
lt seems that he is sleeping!

888
01:32:03,624 --> 01:32:04,750
Come man!

889
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:09,697
Why did police keep a check
post here? l don't know, brother!

890
01:32:09,697 --> 01:32:12,962
Yesterday's check post is
not there! They've kept newly today!

891
01:32:13,067 --> 01:32:15,297
Some new policeman might
have come getting transferred!

892
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:18,134
They are troubling us in the
name of check post! Constable!

893
01:32:18,606 --> 01:32:21,234
What? Are you sleeping?
Didn't you see the lorry number?

894
01:32:21,342 --> 01:32:26,541
Whose the lorry is? Water...
l'm asking! But he is keep on going!

895
01:32:29,584 --> 01:32:32,610
Don't play! This is
rich people's matter!

896
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:40,590
Everything...?
Sinners! 6 lakhs, men!

897
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:44,823
What is his name? Sathya!

898
01:33:05,086 --> 01:33:09,079
That Sathya should die!
Tomorrow... Not tomorrow!

899
01:33:09,257 --> 01:33:12,693
Today & now itself!
Wherever he may be! Do what l said!

900
01:33:12,994 --> 01:33:16,760
Or accept that
you can't do it!

901
01:33:20,134 --> 01:33:23,729
You are to happy now,
aren't you? Yes!

902
01:33:24,105 --> 01:33:26,767
Why do you ask me suddenly?

903
01:33:26,941 --> 01:33:30,502
There's marriage for Sudha!
Radha has joined with her husband!

904
01:33:30,578 --> 01:33:32,671
You've got a good job!

905
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:36,477
You're happy, aren't you?
Yes dear! Come!

906
01:33:36,851 --> 01:33:40,878
ls there any great happiness
than this? Than this...?

907
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:46,288
Nothing! For what else
you will feel happy?

908
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:50,262
l'll feel happy if you walk
little fast! Or car will hit us!

909
01:33:50,431 --> 01:33:55,391
Tell me! Wait! l'll tell you
after crossing this road!

910
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:02,703
Tell me, please! What do
you want me to tell?

911
01:34:07,181 --> 01:34:12,414
lS there any disturbance
for you? Don't you like me, then?

912
01:34:14,455 --> 01:34:20,758
ls there any confidential
secret? lt's there or not...?

913
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:25,160
What do you have in your mouth?

914
01:34:26,901 --> 01:34:31,235
No! You're thinking to much!
So you are questioning me a lot!

915
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:34,866
l am not a confusing person
as you think!

916
01:34:54,562 --> 01:34:55,790
lt's he! Don't leave him!

917
01:36:57,785 --> 01:37:00,777
That Sathya is a single person!
Can't you murder him?

918
01:37:02,089 --> 01:37:05,650
Where is Seenathana?
He has got caught! What?

919
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:08,989
Has he got caught?
Yes! People caught him!

920
01:37:09,096 --> 01:37:10,996
They might have handed
over him in police by this time!

921
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:15,565
We'd bring him out before
they record his case in police station!

922
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:17,467
That is impossible! Why?

923
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:20,506
Because Seenathana got
caught only after killing the police!

924
01:37:20,808 --> 01:37:22,742
So they will take him
to the court definitely!

925
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:32,316
He should not blabber
anything! Sathya! Sit down!

926
01:37:32,987 --> 01:37:36,320
Nothing has happened
to you, has it? Sit down, Sathya!

927
01:37:42,963 --> 01:37:46,956
l got worry hearing this news!
Sorry! You're taking food! No!

928
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:50,060
lt's ok! Tell me! No! l've
come to see you! That's all!

929
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:53,265
Any food...? lt's ok!
You take Sathya!

930
01:37:53,374 --> 01:37:55,934
Please sit & eat!

931
01:38:05,353 --> 01:38:10,757
l didn't tell you for these days!
l had a son in your age, Sathya!

932
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,991
He passed away
in a car accident!

933
01:38:15,096 --> 01:38:21,001
l was living without any
interest in my life after his death!

934
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:28,502
After meeting you...
Please! Be careful Sathya!

935
01:38:28,676 --> 01:38:35,479
Be careful for me! Geetha! See!

936
01:38:35,616 --> 01:38:40,485
He didn't kill anybody!
Somebody tried to kill him!

937
01:38:40,621 --> 01:38:44,421
l think that Sathya is a
good boy! Everybody is good for you!

938
01:38:46,127 --> 01:38:49,358
Because you are good!
You too are good, aren't you?

939
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:52,694
Why do you scold him
like this? What a logic is that?

940
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:57,133
There is no logic in love!
lt's like the film!

941
01:38:57,538 --> 01:39:02,703
lf Sathya comes & asks
about me, tell that l am not here!

942
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:15,714
Good morning, sister!
Come Sathya!

943
01:39:16,023 --> 01:39:22,121
Want to take sweet? There is
no shop today! Where's Geetha?

944
01:39:24,498 --> 01:39:27,934
lsn't there Geetha in home?
Do you want to drink cool drinks?

945
01:39:30,604 --> 01:39:32,799
l asked about Geetha only!

946
01:39:35,309 --> 01:39:36,708
Don't make me to lie!

947
01:39:39,547 --> 01:39:40,878
Tell the truth, then!

948
01:40:05,139 --> 01:40:07,039
Sister!

949
01:40:08,976 --> 01:40:13,470
lf she is angry on me,
she can spit on me in contact!

950
01:40:13,747 --> 01:40:17,615
She can fight with me!
l don't know why she is hiding!

951
01:40:19,453 --> 01:40:21,353
l don't know
how l'd act now!

952
01:40:21,622 --> 01:40:23,487
Can l get inside
breaking the door?

953
01:40:24,191 --> 01:40:25,920
Or can l run off
with tears...?

954
01:40:26,861 --> 01:40:31,230
l am telling you this,
what l want to tell her!

955
01:40:32,433 --> 01:40:33,866
Tell to that fool!

956
01:40:35,402 --> 01:40:37,927
l love her very much!

957
01:41:25,486 --> 01:41:27,147
What do you want?

958
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:48,806
What do you want?

959
01:42:22,276 --> 01:42:25,609
Why do you threaten me
like this? You should believe me!

960
01:42:26,113 --> 01:42:30,675
How can l believe you?
You are telling that you are working!

961
01:42:30,851 --> 01:42:34,048
What is your profession?
Where is your office?

962
01:42:35,022 --> 01:42:40,119
l see you into the police station!
Or l see your murder attempt!

963
01:42:40,494 --> 01:42:41,188
Who are you?

964
01:42:48,836 --> 01:42:52,738
How can l believe you
having these doubts?

965
01:42:53,741 --> 01:42:55,208
But a thing, Geetha!

966
01:42:56,644 --> 01:42:59,670
l don't do any crime against
law according to my conscience.

967
01:43:02,249 --> 01:43:05,275
This Dhandapany...
l'd be grateful to Dhandapany!

968
01:43:05,919 --> 01:43:11,016
See! Jeep! Money! He is making
me to get stunned by helping me!

969
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:13,259
lf he had not given me money,
my sister's life would have spoiled!

970
01:43:13,594 --> 01:43:14,822
Should not l thank him?

971
01:43:17,331 --> 01:43:22,792
Give me some days! l'll leave
this job! But you'd trust me!

972
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:25,000
You should not doubt me!

973
01:43:27,307 --> 01:43:29,298
Will you believe at least this?

974
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:37,316
Lie will reflect in our eyes!

975
01:43:38,419 --> 01:43:40,387
Look my eyes!

976
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:46,121
lf you believe this, you can
believe my words too!

977
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:34,465
Where is sir? Ok! Leave this car!

978
01:44:37,911 --> 01:44:41,677
What happened to sir? His health
is not good! He's there inside!

979
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:45,213
Go and see! Shall l...
He's there inside! Go!

980
01:44:59,633 --> 01:45:03,763
What's there for your health, sir?
What else! Mind... Naidu!

981
01:45:04,104 --> 01:45:05,901
Sir didn't the get ticket
in the election!

982
01:45:06,473 --> 01:45:08,771
Naidu! Without... Why?
Don't you want me to tell him?

983
01:45:09,209 --> 01:45:12,269
ls Sathya a third person?
Sathya! Did l say like that?

984
01:45:14,281 --> 01:45:17,773
You should know these?
There are 9 people in election commitee!

985
01:45:17,851 --> 01:45:20,149
Our people 4!
Mariappa's people 4!

986
01:45:20,554 --> 01:45:23,182
One person in them was
different! He didn't support anybody!

987
01:45:23,357 --> 01:45:26,690
He supported us as
our sir helped him!

988
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:29,886
People killed him yesterday!
Killed him...? Yes!

989
01:45:30,063 --> 01:45:32,054
lf it is some other politician,
he will leave him!

990
01:45:32,266 --> 01:45:34,257
Sir is too sad thinking that!

991
01:45:34,735 --> 01:45:37,670
l am like you! l can't
bear this, Sathya!

992
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:40,235
Why should you bear this?
You've received a matter for that!

993
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:43,466
As duplicate medicines &
children's death... Whose is the pharmacy?

994
01:45:43,844 --> 01:45:44,708
lt's Mariappa's pharmacy!

995
01:45:45,546 --> 01:45:48,743
There's a file for that! lf we get that,
Mariappa will get punishment!

996
01:45:48,882 --> 01:45:55,048
You keep quiet! Sathya may
go to bring that file for me!

997
01:45:55,155 --> 01:45:58,886
No need! Correct! Tell me
where it is! l'll bring it!

998
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:01,627
Don't bring! Sorry!
You just keep quiet!

999
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:03,557
l know the place of the file!
Come! Let's go!

1000
01:46:03,664 --> 01:46:06,690
Sathya! Won't you listen t
o me? Sathya!

1001
01:46:06,767 --> 01:46:08,928
He will tell like that by
his affection on us!

1002
01:46:09,136 --> 01:46:11,104
We should do something
for his help!

1003
01:46:11,338 --> 01:46:13,329
l know the place of that file!
But l don't have guts!

1004
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,839
You have that! Come!
Let's go!

1005
01:46:14,942 --> 01:46:17,672
Leave! Sathya! Dear! No!
Nothing will take place!

1006
01:46:17,778 --> 01:46:21,509
Don't fear! l won't get anything!
Come! l'll come with the file!

1007
01:46:30,757 --> 01:46:33,885
What Mariappa?
You gave us wine & party!

1008
01:46:34,027 --> 01:46:36,791
There is no side dish! Sorry!
l'll ask them to bring!

1009
01:46:37,364 --> 01:46:41,027
Bring that green leave plate!
l didn't mean that, man!

1010
01:46:41,435 --> 01:46:44,836
l asked about the girl!
Do you ask about her?

1011
01:46:45,038 --> 01:46:49,270
She would have come by this time!
She might have got demand!

1012
01:46:49,476 --> 01:46:51,569
Where is our lust auditor?

1013
01:46:51,845 --> 01:46:57,875
Today his mom's death anniversary!
So he should not drink!

1014
01:46:58,218 --> 01:47:00,083
Good time!
He didn't come today!

1015
01:47:01,388 --> 01:47:04,323
Do you think like that?
Let it be night 12 o'clock!

1016
01:47:04,691 --> 01:47:07,819
See whether that man comes or not!

1017
01:47:09,763 --> 01:47:13,255
Why the girl is missing yet, man?

1018
01:47:15,736 --> 01:47:19,502
She ahs come! Shall l open?
l'll hit you! l only will open!

1019
01:47:27,047 --> 01:47:29,447
ls it too late? No!

1020
01:47:49,236 --> 01:47:54,674
Move away!
Tanjore's chariot is coming!

1021
01:47:55,108 --> 01:48:00,068
He is like the wall!
Wherever l rub! He is there!

1022
01:48:00,814 --> 01:48:03,681
l'll become a flower
in the nighttime!

1023
01:48:03,817 --> 01:48:06,911
lf l become a flower,
many bees will dance with me!

1024
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:12,356
Move away! Tanjore's
chariot is coming!

1025
01:48:12,426 --> 01:48:18,990
He is like the wall!
Wherever l rub! He is there!

1026
01:48:33,847 --> 01:48:39,752
Shall we sing in chorus,
when you sing?

1027
01:48:39,853 --> 01:48:45,519
Shall we play the
back ground music?

1028
01:48:45,592 --> 01:48:51,895
Play the orchestra!
Play the band!

1029
01:48:51,999 --> 01:48:57,596
Play the orchestra!
Play the band!

1030
01:48:57,704 --> 01:49:00,673
You... New grooms!
Something... We've brought!

1031
01:49:00,741 --> 01:49:03,676
l... A continuous struggle!
You... A great gang...

1032
01:49:03,744 --> 01:49:06,611
Go man! Can many
men touch me? Tell me!

1033
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:11,617
You'll get excitement,
when you get more money covers!

1034
01:49:12,419 --> 01:49:18,058
lt's wrong!
Why do you tell like this?

1035
01:49:18,058 --> 01:49:24,258
lf you tell us your needs,
won't we give that now itself?

1036
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:30,463
lf you tell us your needs,
won't we give that now itself?

1037
01:49:30,537 --> 01:49:36,032
Move away!
Tanjore's chariot is coming!

1038
01:49:36,109 --> 01:49:43,379
He is like the wall!
Wherever l rub! He is there!

1039
01:50:21,021 --> 01:50:21,988
101 .

1040
01:50:29,296 --> 01:50:30,285
Where is the file?

1041
01:50:44,044 --> 01:50:49,778
Are you measuring the depth
through your eyes? We can't measure!

1042
01:50:49,883 --> 01:50:55,844
Are you starving for me daily?
We have no other go!

1043
01:50:55,922 --> 01:51:01,861
Hen has many more cocks!
Which boy will protect a girl?

1044
01:51:01,928 --> 01:51:07,764
Hen has many more cocks!
Which boy will protect a girl?

1045
01:51:07,834 --> 01:51:12,533
Move away! Tanjore's
chariot is coming!

1046
01:51:13,473 --> 01:51:18,501
He is like the wall! Wherever
l rub! He is there!

1047
01:51:43,904 --> 01:51:47,305
This record is enough!
Marippan's history will get spoiled!

1048
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:54,371
What Naidu? Sathya!
You don't know how great job you've done!

1049
01:51:55,348 --> 01:51:56,975
You told me! l've done it!
That is all!

1050
01:51:57,284 --> 01:51:59,912
Do you want me to do
anything else? Else...?

1051
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:03,212
This is enough, Sathya!
See day after tomorrow!

1052
01:52:03,723 --> 01:52:11,095
l'll show Mariappan's evil
character to everybody!

1053
01:52:13,266 --> 01:52:17,965
You will be tired! Go & take rest!
You're standing yet! Go!

1054
01:52:18,038 --> 01:52:22,532
Can l go, sir? Leave Sathya!
Naidu! But a thing!

1055
01:52:22,642 --> 01:52:25,110
You should take rest well! Ok?

1056
01:52:27,113 --> 01:52:32,380
Did you see Sathya's sencerity?
He's a talented person!

1057
01:52:47,033 --> 01:52:51,436
You've destroyed a great
ghost through this silly person!

1058
01:52:52,305 --> 01:52:57,208
l told on that day that we
could acheieve our goal through him!

1059
01:52:57,677 --> 01:53:00,407
Taht brother has his
soul on you!

1060
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,074
He is always roaming
behind you!

1061
01:53:03,316 --> 01:53:07,013
This file matter should come
in paper! Shall we gather press meet?

1062
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:12,251
Fool! Press meet?
You are greedy person, man!

1063
01:53:12,659 --> 01:53:16,459
This is not to give to press!
This is to bargain.

1064
01:53:16,563 --> 01:53:21,193
This is to talk business &
correct my accounts!

1065
01:53:21,368 --> 01:53:26,897
l am a fool! Tell to
Sathya... Sathya!

1066
01:53:27,207 --> 01:53:33,407
Who is Sathya? Which Sathya?
What is his position in party?

1067
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:38,808
We gave him a role! His role
is over now! Understand? No!

1068
01:53:42,255 --> 01:53:46,419
You arrange me to meet
our party president!

1069
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:50,528
Mariappa should come there!
Mariappa should participate...?

1070
01:53:51,131 --> 01:53:53,759
Ask the time, when l'd come!

1071
01:53:56,002 --> 01:53:57,469
You are torturing me a lot!

1072
01:53:57,671 --> 01:54:00,299
How it will be if you ask me
a heavy cash as l got caught?

1073
01:54:00,473 --> 01:54:02,703
You're asking my seat &
money too!

1074
01:54:02,942 --> 01:54:06,742
l don't have 20 lakhs!
What can l do, then?

1075
01:54:06,846 --> 01:54:13,649
lf you can't buy it, l'll send
it to the press & police station!

1076
01:54:13,853 --> 01:54:16,788
You man! We both are taking
fish from the same drainage!

1077
01:54:17,057 --> 01:54:18,786
l can bring out your acts too!

1078
01:54:18,892 --> 01:54:23,795
Can you blame me for any matter?
l can show many matters!

1079
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:26,057
l'll give a great list!

1080
01:54:26,433 --> 01:54:30,995
Cheating people's money through
a trust! Duplicate passport business!

1081
01:54:31,171 --> 01:54:35,403
Selling our country's
secrets to foreign!

1082
01:54:35,642 --> 01:54:37,405
You can say anything
with imagination!

1083
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:40,741
But matter with evidence is
valuable! See Mariappa!

1084
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:42,607
People, who got failed
should accept the mistake!

1085
01:54:42,749 --> 01:54:47,448
You only should save the
honor of our party giving him money!

1086
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,611
What Dhandapany?
You told correctly!

1087
01:54:49,923 --> 01:54:51,618
l'm ready to get
compramised!

1088
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:53,823
Mariappa should
decide hereafter!

1089
01:54:58,965 --> 01:55:02,366
l can give only 15 lakhs!
l can't give 20 lakhs!

1090
01:55:02,702 --> 01:55:06,365
l accept! But you'd not less
even a paise for 15 lakhs!

1091
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:11,274
Ok! That file...? Don't hurry!
Why do you worry?

1092
01:55:11,611 --> 01:55:15,206
l have that safely! l'll return
it after the election gets over!

1093
01:55:16,082 --> 01:55:19,779
l saved it from 15 years!
You've come to share that today!

1094
01:55:20,186 --> 01:55:21,778
Ok Mariappa!

1095
01:55:22,188 --> 01:55:26,056
lf l had saved that, 50 children
would have not passed away!

1096
01:55:26,393 --> 01:55:31,763
5 would have passed away!
Why don't you laugh?

1097
01:55:32,165 --> 01:55:35,293
Don't you have sense
of humor? Ok!

1098
01:55:36,002 --> 01:55:39,597
Shall l keep the documents,
then? l'll keep!

1099
01:55:39,973 --> 01:55:42,567
You'll give! There's quarrel
in between you now!

1100
01:55:42,642 --> 01:55:43,870
Have you people got
compramised?

1101
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:46,237
We've got compramised
for our party!

1102
01:55:46,579 --> 01:55:49,571
We both have
become pure!

1103
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:12,028
What's the problem there?
Oh! You...?

1104
01:56:12,105 --> 01:56:14,539
Naidu sir! Where is sir?
he is not there here!

1105
01:56:14,707 --> 01:56:16,937
Where did he go?
l don't know!

1106
01:56:18,478 --> 01:56:23,677
Did you see the paper?
See! Has it come in this too?

1107
01:56:24,117 --> 01:56:26,551
Why do you tell like this?
How can it come?

1108
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:30,721
What do you tell? Should
people print sir's photo with your permission!

1109
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,287
Why do you talk like this,
Naidu sir?

1110
01:56:32,425 --> 01:56:37,328
l brought that file as sir told
that he'd publish that, didn't l?

1111
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:39,523
l don't understand your
words! You just move!

1112
01:56:44,437 --> 01:56:46,564
Where is sir now?
He's gone to meeting!

1113
01:56:46,673 --> 01:56:47,867
Ok! Let me go by
jeep & see him!

1114
01:56:48,908 --> 01:56:52,036
You've got confused!
You'll be alright if you go by walk!

1115
01:56:52,145 --> 01:56:54,306
l'll send the person tomorrow!
You vacate the house!

1116
01:56:55,381 --> 01:56:59,647
You yourself keep the watch!
You man! Why are you calm?

1117
01:56:59,886 --> 01:57:01,911
Close the door, man!

1118
01:57:11,831 --> 01:57:14,163
lt's nice, isn't it? lt's nice sir!

1119
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:21,569
That's... Sir! Ask them to
print it dark! Ok sir!

1120
01:57:22,575 --> 01:57:25,510
What happened, Mariappa?
ls there any problem?

1121
01:57:25,678 --> 01:57:29,205
Yes! This Seenathana case
is coming to the court!

1122
01:57:30,483 --> 01:57:34,214
l was too far fearing for the
consequences of this matter!

1123
01:57:36,289 --> 01:57:39,725
You'd not involve in this!
lt's good for you to stay far!

1124
01:57:40,326 --> 01:57:43,818
You understand this! Seenathana
should understand it!

1125
01:57:45,698 --> 01:57:48,792
lf he tells the truth by
his anger on me...

1126
01:57:49,569 --> 01:57:51,833
lf l do something in the court,
my name will get spoiled!

1127
01:57:52,105 --> 01:57:55,268
What do you tell?
Are we rowdies?

1128
01:57:57,176 --> 01:57:59,542
l too don't understand that
only! You didn't think!

1129
01:57:59,879 --> 01:58:02,609
lf you had thought
you'd have got the seat!

1130
01:58:03,449 --> 01:58:07,886
lf we have a person like Sathya...
l don't need him, sir!

1131
01:58:08,221 --> 01:58:11,156
You won't get Sathya ever!
l've sent him out!

1132
01:58:11,591 --> 01:58:14,492
What's there for that?
ls there only one Sathya in the city?

1133
01:58:14,594 --> 01:58:17,563
There are many Sathyas
throughout the country!

1134
01:58:28,508 --> 01:58:31,602
One minute! l too will take the fire!

1135
01:58:36,616 --> 01:58:38,948
Are you Anand? Yes!

1136
01:58:40,053 --> 01:58:42,521
Chitambaram! Somebody
has come to see you!

1137
01:58:42,889 --> 01:58:44,516
Who is that? He is your
brother-in-law it seems!

1138
01:58:44,958 --> 01:58:48,052
A boy named Anand is standing
outside! Brother-in-law?

1139
01:58:48,194 --> 01:58:55,293
l don't know anybody like that!
Who is Anand, man?

1140
01:58:56,703 --> 01:59:01,037
Our man...? Who had sent you?
Did Mariappa send you?

1141
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,038
For these days...

1142
01:59:15,054 --> 01:59:17,386
This is a murder! People will
give you hanging punishment!

1143
01:59:17,624 --> 01:59:23,961
Why did you do like this?
Money man! Money!

1144
01:59:26,466 --> 01:59:31,597
ls money a great thing?
Mad! You're mad! Money only is great!

1145
01:59:32,238 --> 01:59:37,676
Patient mother! l need 50 Rs
for medicines daily!

1146
01:59:37,844 --> 01:59:42,645
What's that for month?
Calculate it! Unmarried sister!

1147
01:59:42,715 --> 01:59:46,378
Hunger! Money is great, man!

1148
01:59:46,886 --> 01:59:50,947
What's the hatred between me &
Seenathana? l don't know him!

1149
01:59:51,157 --> 01:59:54,820
l did it thinking as a
profession! l got money!

1150
01:59:55,461 --> 02:00:01,161
Do you think 100 or 200? 50000
Rs! 50000 Rs...?

1151
02:00:02,602 --> 02:00:07,005
You too want it, don't you?
Go mad! Who told you to do?

1152
02:00:07,407 --> 02:00:08,032
l don't know!

1153
02:00:10,543 --> 02:00:13,376
You won't tell even if you
know! Who gave you money?

1154
02:00:19,719 --> 02:00:22,882
How much did he give? 500
Rs as advance!

1155
02:00:25,792 --> 02:00:29,819
He gave me 500 Rs! He told
that he'd give the balance later!

1156
02:00:30,129 --> 02:00:32,427
l don't have a faith that
l will go out from here!

1157
02:00:32,665 --> 02:00:35,327
You only should give
that money in my home, man!

1158
02:00:37,036 --> 02:00:40,733
lf you accept the guilt,
your punishment will reduce!

1159
02:00:41,207 --> 02:00:42,731
Don't do anything
like a mad!

1160
02:00:43,209 --> 02:00:44,699
You too don't tell
to anybody!

1161
02:00:45,078 --> 02:00:48,343
lf anybody knows this,
they will destroy my family!

1162
02:00:48,481 --> 02:00:51,848
My work will become waste,
then! Sir! lt's the time to leave!

1163
02:00:52,018 --> 02:00:54,919
Money man! Money!

1164
02:00:55,121 --> 02:00:56,756
You only should give
that in my home in any way!

1165
02:00:56,756 --> 02:00:59,224
Man! Don't worry about me!
l'm ok here!

1166
02:01:01,027 --> 02:01:04,690
Sathya! Thanks man!

1167
02:01:09,936 --> 02:01:16,603
Who is that? There was
Anand's family here!

1168
02:01:17,677 --> 02:01:19,941
Have they gone out?
He's gone to jail!

1169
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:22,045
His mother has passed away!

1170
02:01:22,515 --> 02:01:23,846
lt's 3 days!

1171
02:01:31,991 --> 02:01:35,984
He had a sister!
l expected this!

1172
02:01:36,162 --> 02:01:40,189
Are you asking about Sumathi?
She went with somebody!

1173
02:01:40,466 --> 02:01:42,991
l wanted to set up her!

1174
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:53,675
Do you have sister?
That's why...

1175
02:02:02,355 --> 02:02:05,620
Constable! Who wrote
that F.l.R.? Our lnspector only!

1176
02:02:05,758 --> 02:02:09,250
He wrote it, didn't he?
We don't have problem hereafter!

1177
02:02:09,395 --> 02:02:12,990
Then! Sir! Wait man! Leave
this matter without any problem!

1178
02:02:13,132 --> 02:02:16,863
Sir! What? Sorry sir!
Where is Anand?

1179
02:02:16,969 --> 02:02:21,736
Anand...? He had gone!
Where did he go? Everything got spoiled!

1180
02:02:21,974 --> 02:02:25,137
He spoiled this station's name!
He committed suicide in the lock up!

1181
02:02:25,278 --> 02:02:27,303
Body is going for
the postmortem!

1182
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:32,281
Sir! l am! Van is going!
Go man! Go!

1183
02:02:32,585 --> 02:02:34,712
Then! Tell!

1184
02:02:38,124 --> 02:02:41,719
Sir! Who are you? Where are
you going? He is my friend!

1185
02:02:41,828 --> 02:02:44,797
Friend...? See! Man!
Show his body!

1186
02:02:46,933 --> 02:02:51,870
Did you see? Seeing is
enough! Leave man! Go!

1187
02:02:51,938 --> 02:02:53,530
Start the van!

1188
02:03:09,088 --> 02:03:12,455
Respected elders & ladies
those who are coming here...

1189
02:03:12,792 --> 02:03:22,895
We've decided to make
Mr. Dhandapany to participate in election!

1190
02:03:22,969 --> 02:03:28,737
Not only l! All of our party
people should agree this! Ok?

1191
02:03:29,542 --> 02:03:37,745
We will put garland to
Mr. Dhandapany on behalf of our party!

1192
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:47,593
Mr. Dhandapany
will speak next!

1193
02:03:47,593 --> 02:03:57,696
Dhandapany! Live long!

1194
02:03:58,337 --> 02:04:02,068
My honorable party leader!

1195
02:04:02,942 --> 02:04:07,743
My brother Mr.Mariappa!

1196
02:04:08,581 --> 02:04:13,780
Our party's eye balls!
My greets to everybody first!

1197
02:04:14,787 --> 02:04:25,425
l want to make Mr.Mariappa t
o compete in election again!

1198
02:04:25,564 --> 02:04:27,794
That is fair & that is
everybody's wish!

1199
02:04:27,934 --> 02:04:34,430
But my friend Mariappa's
health is not good from some days!

1200
02:04:35,942 --> 02:04:40,174
That is why our party's higher
officials handed over me this!

1201
02:04:40,546 --> 02:04:46,075
l get some questions while
accepting such a great post!

1202
02:04:46,652 --> 02:04:56,220
l doubt on me whether l can
serve to people like him or not!

1203
02:04:56,462 --> 02:04:57,724
You can do it definitely!

1204
02:04:58,664 --> 02:05:01,758
You can do better than him!

1205
02:05:02,535 --> 02:05:09,202
You too can kill poor people
& children doing crimes!

1206
02:05:09,575 --> 02:05:12,476
Because you both are from
the same drainage!

1207
02:05:12,912 --> 02:05:17,645
Mariappa is better than you!
He's a thief! Everybody knows that!

1208
02:05:17,917 --> 02:05:19,908
But you are a murderer!
Nobody knows that!

1209
02:05:20,019 --> 02:05:21,884
l've come here to show out that!

1210
02:05:23,789 --> 02:05:29,318
How? This country's fate...
Your fate is there in my hand today!

1211
02:05:29,462 --> 02:05:37,961
l will... You have...
Sit down, please!

1212
02:05:41,974 --> 02:05:49,642
Did you see? This happened
by taking youngsters in wrong path!

1213
02:05:49,982 --> 02:05:56,478
But we should not be
violent for that!

1214
02:05:58,858 --> 02:06:03,989
We should join them
with us with affection!

1215
02:06:05,197 --> 02:06:09,258
We should forgive their
guilts with broad-mind!

1216
02:06:10,102 --> 02:06:14,004
We should touch their
hearts telling them good points!

1217
02:06:14,173 --> 02:06:19,338
Youngster's society will
get new image only then!

1218
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:26,047
Get out, man!

1219
02:06:56,682 --> 02:07:00,413
What is this? When l bring
my daughter for the first time...

1220
02:07:00,519 --> 02:07:02,384
Why do you come
with this idiot too?

1221
02:07:02,588 --> 02:07:07,924
lt will too bad! He should
not come to my house!

1222
02:07:07,993 --> 02:07:11,588
Brother! Mom! Brother got
wound in the street!

1223
02:07:11,764 --> 02:07:14,562
Corporation person will take him!

1224
02:07:15,701 --> 02:07:17,692
Corporation...

1225
02:07:20,172 --> 02:07:23,972
lf you talk anything about
my son, l'll kill you!

1226
02:07:27,179 --> 02:07:31,946
Sathya! You get inside!
From 25 years...

1227
02:07:40,259 --> 02:07:44,889
Mom! Don't you have grace?
Will you do like this for your son?

1228
02:07:45,297 --> 02:07:48,562
Brother is the cause for
my happy life, mom!

1229
02:07:49,001 --> 02:07:50,525
Dad too doesn't know this!

1230
02:07:51,137 --> 02:07:55,073
lf brother had not given 20000
Rs on that day, l'd have died!

1231
02:07:55,674 --> 02:07:58,438
Are you a lady? Shit!

1232
02:08:25,604 --> 02:08:29,904
Brother! Should you go now?

1233
02:08:32,945 --> 02:08:38,212
What's there if you go after 2
days? There's election within 2 days!

1234
02:08:38,584 --> 02:08:42,111
lf l don't go now, l can't go
forever! Will you do a thing, then?

1235
02:08:43,122 --> 02:08:45,682
Tell me! l'll see whether
l can do that or not!

1236
02:08:51,197 --> 02:08:52,926
Show me your hand!

1237
02:08:54,533 --> 02:08:59,470
What? You used to tell me
to change me God!

1238
02:08:59,872 --> 02:09:04,775
l did Pooja for this in temple!
You won't get any danger!

1239
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:10,811
Brother! Be careful, brother!

1240
02:09:18,891 --> 02:09:20,882
Take Tiffin and then go, dear!

1241
02:09:37,576 --> 02:09:40,670
You can't defeat them! lf any
danger comes to your soul...

1242
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:45,441
l don't bother about that!
l don't worry about victory or failure!

1243
02:09:46,185 --> 02:09:54,183
l'd show them! Sathya!
you gave me a promise!

1244
02:10:00,599 --> 02:10:03,397
Sathya! Think about me!
Don't stop him, dear!

1245
02:10:04,503 --> 02:10:10,567
Doing crime is a sin! Bearing
that like cowards is a great sin!

1246
02:10:11,343 --> 02:10:14,710
l was doing that sin
from 50 years!

1247
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:22,409
l've got changed now! lt's my
duty to send him blessing him!

1248
02:10:23,088 --> 02:10:25,682
Sathya! You go bravely!

1249
02:10:48,113 --> 02:10:59,012
Our leader Dhandapany!
Live long! Our leader Dhandapany!

1250
02:10:59,091 --> 02:11:03,323
Our vote is for Dhandapany!

1251
02:11:04,029 --> 02:11:07,021
Stop the car in the street
behind the house & wait for me!

1252
02:11:07,132 --> 02:11:08,463
l'll come!

1253
02:11:08,567 --> 02:11:20,001
Our leader Dhandapany!
Live long! Our vote is for Dhandapany!

1254
02:11:20,112 --> 02:11:24,879
Our leader Dhandapany!
Live long! Our vote is for Dhandapany!

1255
02:11:48,807 --> 02:11:52,072
Who is that? Watchman!
Somebody has entered inside!

1256
02:11:57,449 --> 02:12:04,981
You man! Open the door!
Watchman! Open! Who is that?

1257
02:12:07,793 --> 02:12:11,923
Why did you come in?
Where are those files? Which files?

1258
02:12:12,364 --> 02:12:16,562
Where are Marippa's files?
l'll tell!

1259
02:12:16,635 --> 02:12:18,967
Those are in that bag
that is in that shelf!

1260
02:12:19,638 --> 02:12:23,199
Where's its key? lt's there
in my hip belt! l'll give! Wait!

1261
02:12:23,409 --> 02:12:26,242
l'll give! Wait!

1262
02:12:29,348 --> 02:12:33,045
My vig! My vig!

1263
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:34,939
You man! Move apart!
You may get wound!

1264
02:14:43,682 --> 02:14:47,846
What is this? Start the car!
lt's not starting! Start man!

1265
02:17:11,363 --> 02:17:15,527
ls the water available?
No! Soda is available! Do you need?

1266
02:17:17,736 --> 02:17:19,226
Here!

1267
02:17:21,273 --> 02:17:23,741
50 paise only!

1268
02:17:28,246 --> 02:17:30,646
lf l give soda to drink,
it seems you will waste it!

1269
02:17:30,982 --> 02:17:32,745
Give me the bottle,
sir! l'd shut the shop!

1270
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:12,446
Drop down the pistol!
Drop man!

1271
02:19:43,448 --> 02:19:46,474
What happened?
l only donated blod! Do you know?

1272
02:19:46,685 --> 02:19:48,175
Our blood is of
same group only!

1273
02:19:48,253 --> 02:19:50,153
What happened to
Dhandapany's matter?

1274
02:19:52,557 --> 02:19:56,584
You've got saved!
Truth has got failed!

1275
02:19:57,462 --> 02:20:01,899
l gave you
documents! With that...

1276
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:08,038
You are alive yet
after getting gun shot too!

1277
02:20:08,173 --> 02:20:10,641
This file too is a
cause for that!

1278
02:20:12,244 --> 02:20:16,977
Did you see? Blood!
Your blood!

1279
02:20:17,949 --> 02:20:20,816
They washed out their
sins in your blood!

1280
02:20:29,694 --> 02:20:31,958
Why are making the patient
to get excited like this?

1281
02:20:47,212 --> 02:20:49,407
Good people won't
get spoiled ever!

1282
02:20:51,016 --> 02:20:55,715
Did you see how
sincere Sathya is!

1283
02:20:57,923 --> 02:21:01,359
l had a sonj in your age
, Sathya!

1284
02:21:04,162 --> 02:21:09,964
We people should not have
urge & violent thought for that!

1285
02:21:34,359 --> 02:21:35,519
Your house has come!

1286
02:21:36,528 --> 02:21:42,194
Get out, man! l've worked
to Dhandapany a lot, man! Leave!

1287
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:45,531
You're sending me out! l
suffered a lot for him! Go man!

1288
02:21:45,603 --> 02:21:47,798
You've sent me out
before it gets torn!

1289
02:21:48,073 --> 02:21:50,542
Will you go or not?
We both sent out many people!

1290
02:21:50,542 --> 02:21:53,409
You've sent me out
now! Duty! Leave!

1291
02:21:54,980 --> 02:21:57,278
Dhandapany!
Get destroyed! Leave man!

1292
02:21:58,083 --> 02:22:01,519
You will break me!
l'll see you! Go man!

1293
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:05,886
You auto! Everybody
