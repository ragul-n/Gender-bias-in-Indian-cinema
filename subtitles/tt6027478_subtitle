<i>The village of Jambapur</i>

3
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:23,750
Changalarayadu!,
-What is it aunty?
Your wife is giving birth, take her to the hospital
- So who will tie this flagship? 

4
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:25,008
Tell your leader to come tie it 

5
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,101
If you say anything about my leader I will mix you with dirt 

6
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:34,218
- You'll go to hell!
- Changal Rayudu our leader is coming
Huh? Our leader is coming?! 

7
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:45,566
In this area who works hardest for our party?
- That guy running there, Changalarayadu

8
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:50,312
Hey Changalarayadu! 

9
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:53,164
Come on here
- Ha!, our leader called my name!

10
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:59,521
What is this?
kissing peoples legs, you should
change this tradition

11
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:03,045
Meeting you in person is my honor, you also called my name
- stand up

12
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:05,900
Changalarayadu!
- Say mother

13
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:12,800
Your baby has turned in her stomach
How many times did I ask you to take her to the hospital?
But you are too busy saying Party Party

14
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:18,302
Why do you bring this upon us?
Look if anything happens to your wife I hope it happens to
your leader too!

15
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:25,994
My party followers should not go through this!
Take her in my car with a siren

16
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:30,138
The family members of the party are more important than 
the party

17
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,754
Come on, come on, the baby will be born

18
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:48,228
Changalarayadu, its a baby boy!

19
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:55,992
Changalarayadu your son was born in the car of the party
leader. He's a lucky boy
- All because of you

20
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:10,428
Long live the city representative!

21
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:13,097
Why is it so busy dad?

22
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:17,187
The MLA is dead, so an opportunity for another member arised

23
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:20,007
whoever our leader chooses becomes the MLA

24
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:25,665
What man?
If you bring a mass amount of people I'd become scared?
Don't you have any sense?

25
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,997
I do not want to scare you but if you dont give me a seat
and give it to someone else then youll be scared 

26
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:33,876
I am the leader of the party! I make the final decision...

27
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:39,357
who are you? 
- Changalarayadu
which Changalarayadu?
- My son was born in your car

28
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:42,141
Vikarabad?
Yeah!

29
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,831
This is my son, he passed 10th grade as a top student
I came to bring you sweets

30
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:49,657
Shut up! Im burning up here and you bring sweets!?
Get out!

31
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:56,400
do not make a mistake in giving me a seat!
- Behind every decision I make there is a big reason.

32
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:59,214
Get lost with your reasoning. Only one reason!
- What is that?

33
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:04,227
Why are you raising your voice?
- It will raise if you give the seat to someone else
I'll kill both you and the other guy!

34
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:08,466
Making the people happy means you need to sell the
party. Otherwise sell your wife!

35
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:14,202
What are you saying
I'll kill you!

36
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:41,858
Changalarayadu please take this blame for me
- What?

37
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:47,856
You see if I go outside in this situation I know what they'll
do to me

38
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:53,263
The party will be lost without a leader

39
00:04:54,264 --> 00:05:00,923
If you take this blame, the society will think you did it for
the sake of me. 

40
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,113
They will believe it!

41
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:11,179
I'll give your son education
He will become a doctor, engineer with my money
I'll take care of your family

42
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:15,768
I am the leader of my party, please

43
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,372
Do not worry, sir

44
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:25,100
Dad, did you accept?
I accept

45
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,772
I will take the blame
Because kids get less punished in jail

46
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:34,400
You take that MLA seat
And be the representative then release me soon

47
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:41,492
It's your fault that I was born poor
But if I die poor, then its my fault
I won't let that happen

48
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:47,392
Do you accept?

49
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:50,717
Go outside and tell them the seat is my dads

50
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:55,171
Dad you go too

51
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,934
15 years later

52
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:57,648
We still have no news of KMR's businessmens daughters.
Three girls have been kidnapped. Still no demands have been
given. Everyone is worried about the health of the kids

53
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,470
The kidnapping numbers are high, is this a group work?

54
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:10,609
Or an international mafia?
Police investigations continue

55
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:23,898
Has he not come yet?

56
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:24,852
Who are you? Why are you taking us?
Do you know who I am? Guntha Malesh's wife.

57
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:29,395
- Sister  
My dear, I do not know your parents but every time you call
me sister sister

58
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:35,259
Do not be afraid sister, my husband will free you too
- Thank you sister

59
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,770
- Hello?
Hubby...
- Who's this?
Its me your wife, Vasundari
- Tell me

60
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:46,818
Someone took me and our son as hostage
- Kidnapped you?

61
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,877
Do not be afraid I'll send my brother to save you

62
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:59,363
What happened? You said I was your life, I was your spirit?
What happened to all those words? Are not you worried about
me?

63
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:05,779
Ammalu! They took you hostage too?
- Ammalu?! Does that mean this is that girl?! I'll show 
you later

64
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,290
sister!
Call me that again and I'll peel your skin

65
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,461
When dad said ammalu I thought he meant a little girl not my 
future step mum

66
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:15,503
Brother!
- Younger brother

67
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:19,925
Who are you?
- Why? do not you want to see me? 

68
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:20,993
What do you want?

69
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:24,754
From there you are half a kilometer away
to Kheirat Abadeh intersection

70
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:28,814
Turn right from there, a little ahead
Go left to the train station

71
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:35,429
There will be a general store called Anitta Shop
From there get me a 1 litre bottle of water, better be super cold

72
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,434
Why would you kidnap for a bottle of water??
-Yeah, along with the water, bring the four children you took hostage

73
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:42,957
Take the train to Williams

74
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:45,052
I tell you where to get off

75
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:52,766
As soon as we get off we will slice him to pieces
Put it on speaker

76
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,611
- Hello
Listen, at the next station get off with just the kids and
yourself

77
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:57,543
Damn! Let's go

78
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,983
Wait! Theres two families of mine as hostages
Pull the chain once you leave the station and walk back

79
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:21,361
Why you squeezing the bottle?

80
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:26,811
Throw me the bottle

81
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:29,523
Where is my family?
- I dropped them off before

82
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,710
With your men in the same train as yours

83
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,136
Thanks to some annonymous student tips the police
arrested the kidnappers at the train station

84
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:56,926
The kids have returned safely to their families and 
the police are thankful to the students

85
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:25,703
Dhruva make it 15 seconds today
Are you sure? - Yeah!
Youve trained well hey?

86
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,500
Let's go

87
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,609
Last nights kidnap rescue video has gone viral on social 
media

88
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:09,216
I thank the police and the government for saving my daughter 

89
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:18,209
Seeing their reactions makes me feel so happy.
It's all because of you.
You gave us the motivation to do this.
Yea, no matter how hard it is I want to keep doing it

90
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:22,742
I feel proud!
We are like minded people and it worked out

91
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:30,870
Once we get assigned to our station we can proceed further 
with the same spirit and bring a big change 
- The day we decided to become police, we already became
the police that day

92
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:35,064
But let's not wait for the change, Let's be the change

93
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,516
Today I am very happy

94
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:26,320
Do you know what this is? A pharma industry revolution

95
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:32,176
Our government is negotiating with a foreign company
to get generic medications to India

96
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:39,347
If it happens, the price of a $1000 medicine will now be $10
No poor patient will die due to high medicine prices

97
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:47,284
Our pharmaceutical companies will be shutting down.
In the future our country will be without disease

98
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:54,070
Is it not great? Everyone clap!

99
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:57,259
You're thinking why is he telling us this so happily?

100
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:07,573
I am very angry!
If we do not stop this urgently, then we will close our
companies and become beggers.
- Listening to you is scary, please do something

101
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,055
To stop it we have to buy many people 

102
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:16,181
Take them out, anyone who has sold medical seats blackmail
them

103
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:20,853
Otherwise you lose everything you have earnt
And you cannot earn anymore

104
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:25,884
To prevent this problem
Generic medicine cannot come to India

105
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:33,321
One day my friends father died in an accident and we took
him to the hospital for a post mortem

106
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:37,869
According to the rules, after 6 pm they cannot conduct a post
mortemso the whole night the corpse was left there

107
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:48,897
That day the family was very disturbed.
The rule is correct. In the old time there was no electricity so
it was not possible, but we still comply with the law

108
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:56,771
We have so many blind rules like this. Even little mobile apps
get updated but our government will not update

109
00:17:56,772 --> 00:18:00,277
The incident that day had a big impact on me

110
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,001
That's fine
- Can I share something madam?
Yes Gautham

111
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:09,665
The reason for my social strength is because of Dhruva
He told me that the terrorist in Bombay was 18 years old

112
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:17,270
The Delhi gang rapers are no more than 17 years old
Not only them but all the robbers begin at around 17-18

113
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:27,379
A bad person to learn bad things does not look for a time to do
it but a good person for good work will look for the right
time

114
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:35,823
The words he told me impacted me a lot.
To do a good deed never requires a good time is what he
taught me and gave me this watch

115
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:41,935
Every second reminds me of Dhruvas words

116
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:44,813
That's why along with me I will keep this watch and Dhruva

117
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:49,307
Quiet please!

118
00:18:54,707 --> 00:19:01,921
I know what you are doing at night going over the wall
Dhruva should come tonight to Park Hotel otherwise....

119
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,397
What is this new headache?
Who do you think sent this sms?

120
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,223
We all start in ten more days
If our superiors find out about this then the posting is out

121
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:18,550
Even if 40 people came out we can deal with it
But telling a higher officer  .. I'm tense

122
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,951
Instead of magnifying the problem, what if we simply ignore
it?

123
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:26,917
We did not start this to stop half way through
He asked us to meet right? Let's see what he's going to 
present

124
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:57,547
Ishika?

125
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:20,381
What do you think they are talking about so seriously?

126
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:28,050
Did she send the message? 
- Yeah
What is the problem between you two? 
- Ask yourself

127
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:35,668
Like my dad I wanted to become an IPS so I passed my civil
exams and went to Oosari for training

128
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:41,662
Before all of you, I met Dhruva

129
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,572
He's honking for you

130
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,788
Why are you straining yourself? Are you followin me??
- What?

131
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:07,119
If you see a beautiful girl does that mean you follow her?
If you follow me like that then....

132
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:12,453
I'll get her to marry you
- Ok for me!

133
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,530
He's come!
- 2 min

134
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:27,628
If you tell him to come then why won't he?

135
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:29,701
Get lost

136
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:33,907
She's not good, but you're good

137
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,641
Stop it! tell them the truth

138
00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:47,282
Don't look at me like that guys
If it happened like that it would be good I said

139
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:49,253
Tell the truth

140
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,942
He's come up!
He must have taken it too seriously

141
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:09,556
Sorry sir we drank a little and talked big.
I mean look at my face and look at you.
Don't take it seriously mama, sorry I mean sir

142
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:12,680
Move aside
Do you know who we are? IPS trainees

143
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:17,779
For my physique do I look like an IPS sir?
I'm just accompanying them

144
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,773
Move the bike, otherwise I'll book you and throw you in jail

145
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,155
Ishika

146
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:27,574
Thats me
- Mr. Subramaniam?

147
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,744
My dad?
This is your home keys 

148
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:37,078
Sir is busy in the campus and told me you were on this bus
so I could give you the keys

149
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,234
What will you say to my dad?

150
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:52,697
I know how hard you must have worked to qualify for IPS

151
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:56,955
You'll try to forget that hard work with friends
That's all right?

152
00:22:58,899 --> 00:22:59,665
Have fun

153
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:14,929
Anyone decides on a character through what they see
But him, even though he saw us in the wrong situation he
understood correctly. Thats when I started liking him

154
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:25,632
Knowing that I was training with him and thinking of it
made me very excited. Along with this another excitement

155
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:49,348
Excuse me! Hello! Ishika, there is a race happening here
please move

156
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:52,343
Lift please

157
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,323
Please
- I really like racing, please

158
00:23:58,324 --> 00:23:59,746
Fine

159
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:38,440
Among all these sounds only one sound is disturbing me

160
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:41,863
That is his heartbeat

161
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:50,505
Interesting, listening to his made me hear my own heartbeat
for the first time

162
00:24:54,274 --> 00:24:57,674
Because of the race his heart is beating 150 times

163
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:02,800
Just by sitting with him my heart is beating 200 times

164
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,548
This is the best moment in my life

165
00:27:17,373 --> 00:27:18,974
Enjoy your holiday my boy
- Thank you sir

166
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:21,491
Ishika
- Yes daddy

167
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:24,815
Meet my daughter, Ishika
- Hello 

168
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:27,597
I know her
- You know her? Tell me what you know about her

169
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:28,593
I mean she's very intelligent

170
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:32,681
Shes beautiful, smart not all these descriptions...
- Is there more sir?

171
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:37,299
Not bragging because she is my girl but she is very orthodox.
These parties and pubs she doesnt know

172
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:43,553
I mean my daughter...
- Listen dad (with respect)
Did you hear that? She called me with respect

173
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,949
Of course she would sir, she's orthodox

174
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:58,645
Recently I asked about marriage. Tell me if you like anyone.
She said I'm your daughter, I will marry anyone you tell 
me to

175
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:02,964
Tell me what really happened sir

176
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:07,647
Very smart boy,
- Just reverse everything I told you

177
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:07,764
Hi
- Hey, Hi

178
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,762
Nice view, no?
Did I disturb you?

179
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:13,675
Not at all

180
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:21,385
I think the trek got canceled?
- Due to the severe snowfall they postponed it to next week

181
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:33,870
Dhruva I want to tell you something
Everybody tries to impress me

182
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:38,168
But since I've met you
Everything is reversed

183
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:45,905
Dhruva you understand everything
Why do you not get this?

184
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,583
I think I'm in love with you

185
00:29:56,305 --> 00:30:02,241
I do not know how to propose but if its a little weird 
please adjust

186
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:07,481
I've told you what I am feeling

187
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:11,639
You said you don't know how to propose, but you proposed
your love this beautifully

188
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:14,418
Love!

189
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:17,567
Such a beautiful feeling

190
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:20,765
I know its worth too

191
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:27,573
But I'm not in a situation
to give it back

192
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,786
This whole "love" does not set with me

193
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,117
I mean I do not set with love

194
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:44,662
My mind and my focus is somewhere else

195
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:49,782
I like you

196
00:30:50,591 --> 00:31:02,071
Do not change a friend, just stay the way you are
But do not bring this love topic again and disturb both of us

197
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,310
Just leave it

198
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,805
I hope you understood me

199
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:25,421
I knew if I could see him then my love would not stop

200
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:30,733
But I was scared if I disturbed him again he would become
even more distant

201
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:36,754
Despite the opposition of my dad
I discontinued my training and joined pharmacy

202
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:40,337
Hey guys want to get some tea?
- Why do you want us between you two?

203
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,639
What would there be between us two?

204
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:47,925
I don't know what there is between you two
but there is an SMS between us and if our superior finds
out then mmmm....

205
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,903
You guys understood very well. Very smart

206
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:55,671
Ohhh, Well, let's go guys

207
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:59,556
Is there no seat for me? Are you single here too?
Crazy fool

208
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:03,391
Ey why did you come here?
- Why did I come? 

209
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:08,671
Actually from the words you told me that day I got very 
inspired

210
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:14,870
After that day I've been studying for only six months with 
no other distractions. The university gave me a gold medal

211
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:19,589
My dad was very proud seeing that and said this was all 
thanks to Dhruva right? So he said go tell him thanks.
that's why I came

212
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:23,767
Tell me the truth
- I couldn't stop myself thats why I came

213
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:26,350
Are you going to follow me your whole life? Is there no end?

214
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:32,397
Yea there is no end
- How come he never told us about Ishika?
- If he didn't tell us then there must be a reason

215
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:41,393
Did they give all the medicines correctly?
- You worry too much, they gave the right medicines.
Aiyoo

216
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,589
Bro, it would be at least 10 ounces

217
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,470
How did you think I would take medicine without 
a prescription?
- I do not know

218
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:17,246
Husband! Husband! Don't please don't. Don't hurt him

219
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:36,717
What happened?
- There is no pulse he is no more

220
00:33:40,493 --> 00:33:44,026
Ishika, at the next signal there is a hospital take her
there. Go go

221
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,379
They brought their weapon in this paper

222
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:51,523
Hey Karan is on the line, while following them he lost them

223
00:33:51,600 --> 00:34:01,768
Karan listen to me, that chain snatchers hood has my phone.
In your phone use find my friend app and follow my phone
location

224
00:34:03,504 --> 00:34:06,777
Yes I found a signal
- We're going to follow you. Lets stay connected

225
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,578
They're going towards Golkonda neighbourhood, let's go

226
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:22,767
Ey turn around, where did this phone come from?
- Before when riding it felt like something hit me,
this must have been that.

227
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:25,801
Someone named Ishika is calling
- First turn that phone off man, give it to me

228
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:30,964
Dammit the signal dropped out

229
00:34:33,117 --> 00:34:38,031
Dhruva, the last signal was given at the edge of the 
Golkunda fort near the Bilal Birriani shop

230
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:39,435
Which gate? 
- Western gate

231
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:42,748
So let's all meet at the eastern gate
- Ok

232
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,185
Boys, this colony is surrounded by the Golkunda Fort wall

233
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:55,918
It only has four entrances

234
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:05,348
Inside there are 14 streets and 500 homes.
They are 100% from here

235
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:08,811
We will search every street from all four corners.
We'll find them, let's go

236
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:30,275
Hey, hey, same poster

237
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:34,923
Dhruva, we saw the same poster
I think we are close to them

238
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:33,494
Dhruva, the snatchers are here and there are even more
of them inside

239
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:49,689
Who are you guys?

240
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:57,873
A persons life means nothing to you?

241
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,139
Good job brothers

242
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:18,081
All the chain snatching that happened in the last two
months of this village were done by us. Today while we 
were doing the same thing, we had to kill someone

243
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,297
Yes Ishika
- Why did you turn off the phone?

244
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,541
The battery died. By the way how is she?

245
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:27,124
She's been crying a lot thinking about her husband.
They just gave her sedative

246
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,123
Where are you now?
- Ok let's talk later

247
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:33,421
Ay Dhruva, Dhruva, hello? 
Gah crazy fool

248
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:41,796
Who's house is this?
- Don't worry man this is my best friends house
- WAIT!

249
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:49,562
Come inside with the right foot first
- Why man?
- Ey Punjab don't confuse him he put the right leg first. 
You come mama

250
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,843
What is she doing here?
- Your physique and smart thinking do you think there is 
any relation?

251
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:58,176
There should be some romance in your body mama
the chicken is ready inside

252
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:01,544
Chill mama, come on, come on

253
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:08,769
Chill? Is this even your friends house?
I thought so... ay where are you

254
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:18,677
Oh! Have you come here itself? Come, hello,
meet my boyfriend!

255
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:21,492
No matter how much I hit him, he stays silent

256
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:31,463
Everytime I'm angry I take the knife out and stab him like
this. What why you looking like that? If I didn't have this
facility then with my anger I would stab you for real

257
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,495
Why did you bring me here?
- To sort your relationship today

258
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:41,790
I've given respect to his words and stayed distant. I can't
take it anymore that's why I returned

259
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:44,700
When I came back you all jump the wall and go somewhere

260
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:48,527
And him he goes alone and meets people
- What?

261
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:53,131
Alone? We always go together

262
00:39:54,785 --> 00:39:58,627
Why are you all shocked? Do you not know he is going
alone?

263
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:02,970
I'm telling the truth. If you want ask him yourself

264
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:09,339
Is Ishika telling the truth?
- Without telling us you're going alone?

265
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,638
There is no "silence please" board here you can talk

266
00:40:12,797 --> 00:40:19,843
I have a private life, I do not have to tell everyone
about it

267
00:40:20,664 --> 00:40:21,179
Dhruva

268
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:31,272
Show the home minister the new apartment blocks personally.
Do it carefully 
- Ok sir

269
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:12,070
Dhruva what is he doing here?

270
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:23,687
What guys? You called me?
- Why are you asking so calmly?
- Can you not see anything?

271
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:27,752
Four days ago he murdered someone in front of our eyes
and we fought so hard to catch him

272
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:34,120
Today he came to the campus as if its his dads
The hand I am supposed to salute I used to hide my face

273
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:40,035
Somehow you behave as if nothing is going on
what's wrong with you?

274
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:41,610
Hello Ishika

275
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,401
I have to go, you guys coming?
- Is this a joke to you? We've been observing since
yesterday

276
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,596
Until you answer our questions we are not going anywhere

277
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,498
Yeah, until you tell us we will not go anywhere

278
00:41:57,387 --> 00:42:01,200
The woman we admitted, Ram Swami's wife, attempted suicide

279
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:09,890
Why did you do this ma'm?

280
00:42:10,506 --> 00:42:17,309
In front of my eyes they murdered my husband.
My testimony was not accepted by the court

281
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:25,782
He was wearing a helmet so they asked how I recognised him
and repented the case

282
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,410
Police, lawyers .. no one supported me

283
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:38,109
When justice won't be served why should I live?
That's why I thought of dying

284
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:50,637
Evidence that is good to come out of a court takes
40 years

285
00:42:51,163 --> 00:42:54,147
With false documents he came out in four days

286
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:59,226
Even after all this, going back to our campus what can we
achieve?

287
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,150
Why are you not talking?

288
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,949
Why are you not responding to anything I ask?

289
00:43:07,557 --> 00:43:10,756
When we ask where you go alone, there is no answer

290
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:15,563
You are observing everything but standing still like
a rock. Is there anything wrong with you?

291
00:43:15,566 --> 00:43:18,585
You're right man, I'm crazy.

292
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:26,910
Whatever you're saying to me I am not listening but looking
at the wrong happening behind you. That is my craziness

293
00:43:28,713 --> 00:43:37,152
Look over there. A few moments ago a wreckless driver 
struck another driver. To you all it looks like he is
giving money for the patients treatment

294
00:43:37,153 --> 00:43:44,385
But to me he is giving money as a bribe to escape any
penalties. I am the only one who sees that, that is my
madness

295
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:48,477
After seeing one person released from all the guys we have
caught got you all so upset

296
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:54,809
You know all those 32 offenders we got?
they are all happily roaming around

297
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:03,354
Does that mean everything we have done up to now is a 
waste?

298
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:07,418
I won't let even one inch go to waste

299
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:15,488
This is my world. No one but me comes here

300
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,551
If you tell me about your enemy, I will tell you who you
are

301
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:36,673
What is this? Don't we usually talk about our freinds?
- Yes if you tell me about your friends then I can tell 
you about your character

302
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,196
And your enemies represent your capacity

303
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:45,851
Four days ago he was our enemy. The guy he killed, Ram
Swami was a social activist

304
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:53,142
I suspected that he wasn't killed just because of his
wife's necklace so that is why I put so much effort to 
catch him. I realized that Irfan Ali is involved

305
00:44:55,553 --> 00:44:59,970
No matter how many time we put that chain snatcher into
jail he will be released because of Ali

306
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,006
Our home minister and Ali planned on a big building
construction outside the city

307
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:10,541
That land belonged to the poor and Rama was fighting for
them so that is why he got killed

308
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,436
Without anyones suspicion they planned a chain snatch

309
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,608
The police were deceived and closed the case 

310
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:22,472
Now tell me if he is our enemy or him?

311
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:29,099
Up to now the 32 criminals we caught I have had some
suspicion... with five hundred of my cases

312
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,583
full detailed analysis

313
00:45:35,923 --> 00:45:41,420
Behind all of these thefts, kidnappings there are many
manipulated plans behind them

314
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:47,006
Remember the kids?
They were not kidnapped for money

315
00:45:50,144 --> 00:45:56,306
Last month in a private hospital an incubator was short
circuited and 18 children were dead was in the news

316
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:59,826
They did not die because of this reason

317
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:04,344
Those kids were all born with diabetes. After giving them
their medicine like every normal day

318
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:10,395
but after 10 minutes all the children died

319
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:20,807
Being scared I went to tell the management but they 
threatened me to stay silent and if the news got out the 
hospital will get a bad name

320
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:24,447
The medicine that was given to the nurse was not normal.
It was an untested drug

321
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:28,962
With that drug, 18 children died

322
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:36,544
If this came out then all of the big pharma company 
misconducts will come out so the hospital said it was a 
short circuit

323
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:41,733
Dr. Rimacant wanted to report this incident but to keep him
quiet they kidnapped his daughter

324
00:46:43,126 --> 00:46:46,353
For no one to understand the cause of the kidnapping
three more children were taken along with his

325
00:46:47,702 --> 00:46:51,782
Behind this medical mafia the man who runs it is
Dheeraj Chandra

326
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:55,431
Behind every small crime, there is a big organised
crime

327
00:46:55,578 --> 00:47:12,706
Behind every small crime how can you say that there is 
a big crime behind it?
- You ask how can I say something like this well I started 
noticing this since I was 15 years old

328
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:18,647
Everyone will read whatever is written and believe it all
blindly. But I started reading in between the lines

329
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:23,557
Suddenly one day noticed the connection of the second page
and the sixth page

330
00:47:23,558 --> 00:47:27,557
Second page had an announcement about truck strikes
but the sixth page had auto rickshaw rates increasing

331
00:47:27,558 --> 00:47:32,387
In another page if someone gave a party some funds
another page would have someone he knows has been
released from jail

332
00:47:32,388 --> 00:47:37,650
One page has the value of gold increased
Another page says the holiday deal extended by two days

333
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:42,537
One page has the news of a foreign coffee brand launch
And another page has the benefits of coffee to the heart

334
00:47:43,285 --> 00:47:49,392
We do not care about businesses but it is that one business
that will lead the news of everything in that paper

335
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:59,425
For their business the news papers print and we follow them
blindly. You have to drink this water, have this medicine
study this only. A businessman decides all this

336
00:48:03,307 --> 00:48:09,461
The fate of people may be run by a politician but the 
person that writes the fate of that politician is a 
businessman

337
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:13,295
All of these 500 crimes are for business

338
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:23,805
Behind these crimes are 15 people. To capture these 500
criminals there are 5000 police officers

339
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:34,425
But between these 15 people, there is not even 1 person
to catch them. My goal is to get the biggest offender
among these 15

340
00:48:34,723 --> 00:48:43,560
If we get him thousands of crimes will be reduced
I must take this and make him my enemy

341
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:50,510
We will be given our postings in ten more days
Before that, I must choose my enemy

342
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:52,658
But how will you choose that enemy?

343
00:48:56,326 --> 00:49:01,357
They are the 15 I told you about. They are all doing wrong
but designed it in a way to get away with it so easily

344
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,461
And these are the worst of them. They are responsible for
80% of the crimes

345
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:11,786
Dheeraj Chandra, he has a monopoly in pharma medical crimes
in the state he decides if a doctor can prescribe a drug

346
00:49:12,187 --> 00:49:17,121
Jayanth Suri, he digs up land and uses natural resources to
get money from the government

347
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:24,674
Irfan Ali, a criminal that supplies the criminals in the
city. In addition, theft or murder and possession of land
is all under his control

348
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:30,125
Of these three whoever is the bigger guilty I will find 
him and prove that he can be served justice too

349
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:32,733
Superb, Excellent, Brilliant

350
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:41,177
Once we get our postings we will all be split but 
if you ever need our help just make one phone call
- Thanks man

351
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:43,775
So when are you fixing your enemy?

352
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:55,507
This is Jayanth Suri, to stop the inspection in his granite
quarry he is meeting the MLA, once I get the details of 
that then I'll make a decision

353
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:57,205
Whats the issue, all three of you came together?

354
00:50:58,206 --> 00:51:01,362
What is this? kissing peoples legs, you should
change this tradition. Let's go

355
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:18,147
Sir has given us the time to meet him at least now.
- Yea it has been over two months since we've met with sir

356
00:51:20,148 --> 00:51:26,629
He is my son and it took me two months to meet him
and I am a minister....

357
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,178
Hello sir
- Hello

358
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:20,460
Kana
- Dad, one moment, Preethi is waiting for me

359
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,011
Hello?
-Hello Preethi
Hello Darling

360
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:32,612
Dad and a few more people came, looks like I'll be late
so you have dinner

361
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:38,698
Oh No, I'm waiting for you
Get your phone to your dad

362
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:45,020
Say, Preethi
- What uncle, during dinner time you have meetings?
why can't you come home?

363
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:49,636
Youre right my daughter eating is more important than the 
meeting. I'll give it back now

364
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:50,438
Kana

365
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:58,864
Sweetheart I told them to come. Small meeting, I'll join
you soon.
- I'll be waiting for you

366
00:52:58,865 --> 00:53:01,183
Bye
- love you

367
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:06,097
What she is saying is correct kana, you have to look after
yourself too
- Ok daddy

368
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:09,030
Kana, our guys have all come to talk to you....

369
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:18,460
I have an important meeting to attend, you guys talk amongst
each other. Right kana? Thank you Kana

370
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:28,545
You've been stuck in the lab for 2 months?
- There is a reason for that

371
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:31,916
We thought of finishing all our duties before you came back
but it didn't happen

372
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,280
Angelina is saying she will come to India no matter what

373
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:42,879
No matter how much I tell her she is not being convinced.
- I'll look after it

374
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,277
That Rama swami case got our guy locked up in Kashi jail
and caused a big problem for us.
- I've already cleared that problem before in the lab

375
00:54:13,506 --> 00:54:20,682
October 3rd is a very important day for us. Be ready. At least 
until then try not to create any new problems

376
00:54:20,683 --> 00:54:22,440
Dheeraj, come with me

377
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:37,397
The Angelina matter should be carefully resolved and I'll tell
you how to.

378
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:38,322
Ok sir

379
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:52,499
Hello, Hello
- Not bad, he is healthy

380
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,265
He is our lucky kid

381
00:54:55,375 --> 00:55:00,282
We trialled it on 18 babies and this boy is the only one that 
survived

382
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:12,389
Wherever you brought him from, as it is put him back there.
Give his parents a reason

383
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,496
Every month check up on him. We can see if our formula has
been successful or not

384
00:55:17,337 --> 00:55:23,389
Bye, I'll  miss you, I'll miss you

385
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:32,287
What did sir tell you?
- October 3rd will go ahead as planned. Until it is complete he
said to be careful

386
00:55:38,472 --> 00:55:40,723
Hello doctor

387
00:55:44,335 --> 00:55:46,260
Padmasri Siddharth Abhimanyu
Man of chemical miracles...

388
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:11,245
What happened man, you told us to come urgently?

389
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:13,269
I have chosen my enemy

390
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,845
Siddharth Abhimanyu? What? Scientist Siddhart?

391
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,578
I went to choose one of the three but I found a fourth who was
their leader

392
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:27,534
To the outside world he may be a science genius, but in 
actuality he is a hardcore white collar criminal. 

393
00:56:27,535 --> 00:56:36,028
Basically he has these three beneath him and rules the entire
crime world. The other day Siddharth was a chief guest and the
CM attended it.

394
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,639
I knew there had to be a connection between them two

395
00:56:38,702 --> 00:56:41,302
The chain snatcher who killed Rama Swami got caught and so
that Siddharth would not get a problem from him, he killed him

396
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:50,031
He tattood a religious symbol, stabbed his body and threw his
corps into one of his illegitimate sites. This caused a 
religious conflict, so that police investigations would be closed

397
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:55,243
In the end he used the corpse in his favour as well

398
00:56:55,244 --> 00:57:06,462
As a young scientist we find new things everyday. But that 
doesn't make it news. You know what makes the news? Todays
poor people getting medicine that can help

399
00:57:06,463 --> 00:57:11,276
He created the conflict, then he claims to solve it and then
he got the claps on stage

400
00:57:11,372 --> 00:57:17,877
October 3rd is a very important day for him. I will make it an
unforgettable day for him

401
00:57:19,543 --> 00:57:27,264
That siddharth abhimanyu, he's actual name is Yankana.
When he got out of jail he was a young kid. His dad gave
him 4 guards and said go rule the streets

402
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:38,787
He responded saying, "I didn't make you an MLA to bully street
criminals, enrol me into a good university. Clear my criminal
record. I have to study well!"

403
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:53,709
Dhruva, do you not think about anything else but Siddharth?
Tomorrow is swearing in ceremony. Day after is posting. What
happens if you never meet Siddharth again? What will you do?

404
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:55,881
Both of us will definetly meet again

405
00:57:55,882 --> 00:58:02,547
Wherever there is money there will be heaps of crime.
Siddharth follows the money and I follow crime

406
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:07,751
The equation is what will make us collide
- You're correct

407
00:58:07,752 --> 00:58:12,313
Are you ready to shake heands with the enemy?
- What?
Tomorrow our swearing in chief guest is Siddharth

408
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,602
Siddharth Abhimanyu

409
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,338
We welcome our chief guest sir Siddharth Abhimanyu

410
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:34,287
He is a great scholar of science and has made great
contributions to the pharmacy side.

411
00:58:35,788 --> 00:58:41,150
He's very lucky, the criminal he selected is the chief guest
- fate man, fate

412
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:51,497
Honourable minister, respected members of the academy,
ladies and gentlemen, and of course, the future of our
police force

413
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:57,552
Wherever I go, the first question I am asked is what is the
cause for my success

414
00:58:58,275 --> 00:59:04,456
It's actually very simple, in your life take one idea. Let that
idea become your life

415
00:59:04,557 --> 00:59:09,302
Think about it, all the very best
Jai Hind

416
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:12,449
Now I request all the medal winners to come forth

417
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:21,329
Rajith IPS, for specialisation in cyber security.
Next Dhruva IPS, he will recieve an award from our honourable
home minister Mr Ravindra Reddy

418
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:28,431
Mr Dhruva has received this reward because of specialising
in managing activities involving all....

419
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:32,545
All the best

420
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:45,192
Dhruva has one more honour to receive. As a special award
for overall best probation of the batch which will be 
presented by our honourable chief guest Siddhart Abhimanyu

421
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,432
I kindly request our honourable chief guest to come forward
and present this award to Dhruva

422
00:59:58,044 --> 00:59:59,565
Congratualtions
- Thank you sir

423
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:06,502
Berata, beautiful pistol
- I'm glad sir
You're welcome

424
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:10,454
Not for giving me the pistol, but because you gave it to me
- All the very best

425
01:00:10,455 --> 01:00:18,557
You said to make an idea your life. I have an idea sir, 
you are my idea and I will follow you
- Good luck

426
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:30,329
You are the best officers in the organized crime unit and 
because of that I have selected you 

427
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:35,340
Normally officers look for criminals after being posted but
I have already found criminals and joined the force

428
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:38,423
there is no time to get to know each other so you will just
have to believe me

429
01:00:38,424 --> 01:00:39,741
because I believe in you guys
- sure sir

430
01:00:44,442 --> 01:00:49,518
October 3rd, there will be a big crime happening in our city.
Our first target is to decode this crime

431
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:55,582
These three are important members in our city but a big
threat to our society

432
01:00:55,583 --> 01:01:00,828
Follow them 24/7 and collect any evidence against them
- Sure sir

433
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:02,029
Good

434
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,523
Honest to god I don't know anything sir

435
01:01:41,347 --> 01:01:47,364
Because of those three 600 crores is being sent to our
Swiss bank because they are followers of us. We don't know 
anything else

436
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:54,542
On October 3rd all three of them are transferring 750 crores
to our Mauritius bank. Because you are pressuring me I told
you.

437
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:55,168
Thankyou

438
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:59,501
- This is a list of the major events on October 3rd
On the same day moharan devi and navarathri occur

439
01:01:59,502 --> 01:02:02,563
The same day, the Minister has a meeting with a
pharmaceutical company

440
01:02:05,464 --> 01:02:06,417
What is the company name?

441
01:02:24,528 --> 01:02:27,464
October 3rd is a very important day
- Important day

442
01:02:28,397 --> 01:02:30,533
Angelina insists on coming to India

443
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:38,651
October 3rd they are going to kill this woman. Her name is
Angelina, the CEO of a big pharmacy company in Switzerland

444
01:02:38,652 --> 01:02:40,777
And owns 60% of shares

445
01:02:41,478 --> 01:02:45,895
To sign the generic drugs contract she has already begun her
journey to India

446
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:55,620
October 3 is a great day for the country. Here are the details
you asked for. If Angelina puts one signature then the 
generic drugs will be allowed

447
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:57,437
Then pharmaceutical companies can not do anything

448
01:02:57,467 --> 01:03:07,295
If that happens, a drug that is worth 25,000 will be only 2,000.
500 rupee medicine will only be sold for 2 rupees. This has
to happen sir

449
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:11,500
This deal will be stopped by the medical mafia

450
01:03:11,511 --> 01:03:14,000
To stop this Siddharth must have already landed in Switzerland

451
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:24,388
Hi

452
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:32,247
Thirteen hundred and fifty crores, why is it sent to
Switzerland?

453
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:55,790
I can't believe this. Because of patent rights in India, K827
cancer drug was being sold at a high price

454
01:03:55,791 --> 01:04:05,442
because it is such a high price and people cannot afford it
a lot of poor people are dieing. I felt really sad seeing this.
I want to break the price and get cheap drugs for the poor

455
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:10,717
Do you know who this is?
- Siddharth, he is our companies Indian medical adviser

456
01:04:10,718 --> 01:04:15,433
When Siddharth is your advisor why does he not have any 
shares in your company?

457
01:04:15,664 --> 01:04:21,859
No no, he tried convincing me to sell my 60% of the shares
but I rejected that proposal

458
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:26,279
Thats it!

459
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:33,502
He transferred that much money to buy your 60% of the share

460
01:04:33,524 --> 01:04:34,530
The stage is set beautifully

461
01:04:35,755 --> 01:04:47,675
Killing you here, with Marcus buying your shares making
Siddharth the major vote which stops generic medicine coming
to India. He planned it to happen all at once

462
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,731
Do not worry, your safety is my responsibility
- Thank you

463
01:04:53,673 --> 01:04:58,526
Tomorrow we have two tasks.
1. Prevent the money being transferred to the Swiss account

464
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,417
For that to happen we need to arrest all three at the same
time

465
01:05:03,544 --> 01:05:06,551
2. Angelina has to attend the meeting safely

466
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:11,591
That generic medicine has to come to India. Every poor
persons hope must rise!

467
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:24,513
Yes. Siddharth Abhimanyu. First time he is going to take
a hit. He has to remember this

468
01:05:37,446 --> 01:05:39,794
October 3rd

469
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:51,438
Boys every act according to my plan ok?
- Ok sir

470
01:06:19,265 --> 01:06:22,694
Dhruva where are you?
- Right behind you

471
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:29,639
Sessi where are you?
- We are following your vehicle sir

472
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:36,543
Thank you for the moment and the opportunity. Good for our
share in business as well as yours

473
01:06:41,615 --> 01:06:47,923
Sir Irfan is opposite our car but nothing suspicious sir
- Without a reason he wont be there. Keep watching

474
01:06:55,397 --> 01:06:58,473
Guys be alert
- Ya ok sir

475
01:07:05,607 --> 01:07:07,751
Sir ahead of you the Rudra murgan festival is approaching
- What?

476
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:09,727
This was not their path

477
01:07:36,414 --> 01:07:40,895
There is going to be a rumble here. During this killing the
target is the plan

478
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,269
Nobody get out of the car
- Ok sir

479
01:09:14,453 --> 01:09:16,733
Ishika, Ishika

480
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:26,174
Like taking a bus you made me come in this car. Did you think
of shooting me directly and sending me to god? 

481
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:28,522
Is this a time to joke?
Do you know how tense I was?

482
01:09:29,523 --> 01:09:32,470
Not bad, you're at least a little worried

483
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:36,577
Who are you?

484
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:51,245
Angelina is fine sir, we have her in the hotel you assigned,
everything is under control
- Good

485
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:55,676
Call from India?

486
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:59,704
What the hell has happened out there, have you been trying to
kill me?
- I have done nothing wrong

487
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:04,969
Once my foot steps on Swiss soil, you are finished
- Please, w..w...wait

488
01:10:05,363 --> 01:10:08,264
It's 10 o'clock now, you said she would have been dead by 
9:30

489
01:10:08,265 --> 01:10:13,516
All my work here is done, I'm finished
- Marcus I'll take care of this. Just give me 5 minutes
Just 5 minutes

490
01:10:16,139 --> 01:10:18,476
Why is no one answering their phones? What is happening there?

491
01:10:18,477 --> 01:10:23,440
The law is doing its job kanna, they arrested all three
- Arrest?

492
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:28,664
Will you not tell me what is going on unless I ask? Without
the money how will I complete this deal?

493
01:10:28,665 --> 01:10:35,622
Are you under stress because of money? Tell me how much
you need kanna. I'll transfer it
- First bail those three out

494
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:45,885
Abbas
- Yes sir
Your brothers important task was not completed

495
01:10:48,268 --> 01:10:48,984
I'll finish it

496
01:10:49,385 --> 01:10:51,499
That area is under Dhruva's control

497
01:11:01,037 --> 01:11:02,930
Go straight then turn right

498
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:08,485
Don't stay here. Go back to the station. Come back when I 
call you

499
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:26,423
Yes Siddharth?
- I urgently need 1350 crores

500
01:11:26,424 --> 01:11:34,630
1350 crores? Are you crazy? Asking as if I owe you something
- From your Lichtenstein account transfer it to my Geneva 
account

501
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:35,749
Why the hell should I pay you?

502
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,328
I have emailed you my bank details

503
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:43,545
Do you know who I am?
- With the email I have sent an attachment. Have a look at it
then make a decision.
Attachment?

504
01:11:55,709 --> 01:11:57,892
Okay, I'll send it

505
01:12:02,509 --> 01:12:08,456
We welcome our honourable chief minister to attend the meet
for generic medicine with Pixin company

506
01:12:11,257 --> 01:12:17,401
The meeting will begin in 20 minutes. We told the CM that
we are bringing Angelina now
- I'll bring her

507
01:12:27,263 --> 01:12:30,512
She made a call to Swiss using my phone saying its urgent
- Why did you let her?

508
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:33,449
There is a chance to trace it
- Sorry sir

509
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:46,498
Come in
- Hello madam

510
01:12:47,499 --> 01:12:49,205
I can not believe what's happening around me

511
01:12:53,506 --> 01:12:57,679
You shouldn't have made that call, they can definitely trace
you
- I know what am I supposed to do?

512
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,355
What is it Sathyam?
- Sir told me to bring this file

513
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:05,240
Ok

514
01:13:49,983 --> 01:13:51,404
Angelina, Dhruva are finished

515
01:13:54,957 --> 01:13:56,788
Good job

516
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,798
Yes Abbas? Better be some good news. 
Angelina is closed and that ACP Dhruva I also got rid of

517
01:14:07,799 --> 01:14:09,401
Excellent

518
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:13,440
By the time I arrive in India tomorrow all people involved
in this should die

519
01:14:13,507 --> 01:14:19,900
There is no people sir, only one person arrested those three
and saved Angelina.
- only one?

520
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:56,931
Mrs. Angelina wanted to allow a cheaper price for the poor
by bringing generic medicine to India through a contract

521
01:14:56,932 --> 01:15:00,761
Mrs. Angelina was killed..
I'm very sorry for this death

522
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:08,867
Police investigations have begun to understand how this
murder came about. For the time being the contract for these 
medicines have been halted

523
01:15:16,194 --> 01:15:18,649
No matter what you do, do it carefully man. Be careful with
Siddharth

524
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:24,575
I am not the one that should be careful, it is him that 
should be. Even though I took the bullet, he was hit even 
harder

525
01:15:26,576 --> 01:15:30,453
After 20 years of hiding in the dark, It only took 2 days
to bring him out into the open

526
01:15:32,454 --> 01:15:34,565
Now it is him that must be careful

527
01:15:37,473 --> 01:15:45,644
Yea... You will be cool. But someone is waiting outside
and punishing herself by not coming in.
- Why punish? I am ok

528
01:15:47,747 --> 01:15:50,918
Crazy fool, when will you understand

529
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:33,411
Give me the key
- Why did he discharge the driver?

530
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:38,456
He came back two days earlier than what he told me. I
wonder what will happen

531
01:18:38,657 --> 01:18:45,550
Kanna, I bailed Dheeraj Chandra and Jayanth Suri making sure
they dont have an LLR on their record

532
01:18:45,551 --> 01:18:47,980
F.I.R
- Some sort of R kanna

533
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:53,093
Why are you looking at me like that kanna?
I did what you told me to
- Did have you have lunch?

534
01:18:53,094 --> 01:18:57,168
I did kanna
- Did you eat after asking me?
Sorry kanna

535
01:18:57,244 --> 01:19:03,316
What sorry? Just because I told you to ask me before 
doing so doesnt mean you always ask me
- Don't get angry kanna

536
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:12,369
If I made decisions without asking you and it goes wrong 
it is worse than if I ask you and it goes wrong.
This is what you have told me since you were young

537
01:19:12,803 --> 01:19:17,470
1. Any time you go out always hold your head up high

538
01:19:17,488 --> 01:19:22,370
2. Even if it is funny no matter the situation never laugh
out loud

539
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:34,303
3. Until you tell me I should not let anything slip.
That is when this world will respect me. That is what I have
been following till now. If I need to change that it is hard

540
01:19:34,304 --> 01:19:36,304
Do you not have any common sense?

541
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:43,343
Do I? No I don't. It is not in the list you told me. Should
I add it?

542
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:46,330
Nana, even a sparrow has bigger brains than you

543
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,455
Wear your scarf

544
01:19:56,290 --> 01:20:01,652
What is this? He hasn't even been posted for a week and 
arrested all three of us

545
01:20:01,712 --> 01:20:04,889
Thinking about it... Thanks to your dads smart actions we 
got out of jail

546
01:20:07,514 --> 01:20:11,552
Because you told us so, we let him go. Otherwise we would
have killed him in the hospital

547
01:20:13,253 --> 01:20:15,562
Do you know why he arrested you?
- No sir

548
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,589
Do you know why I went to Switzerland?
- No sir
he knows why

549
01:20:20,474 --> 01:20:23,278
Does your brother Abbas know you three work for me?
- No

550
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:24,086
But he knows

551
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:34,557
First time, someone brought me out of the darkness.
A lifetime is not enough to discover even a tiny formula

552
01:20:34,658 --> 01:20:38,801
But he was able to crack the Siddharth Abhimanyu formula

553
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:43,534
Someone as smart as him shouldn't be killed in a hospital
- What are you doing here?

554
01:20:43,535 --> 01:20:44,466
I told him to come
- His name is dhruva

555
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:51,398
He has no parents, he is alone. Police is his passion.
Like your research lab, he has a lab as well

556
01:21:15,362 --> 01:21:19,319
I have an idea sir. You are my idea, and I will follow you
- Congratulations

557
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:53,472
Up till now a lot of people have created problems for my
brain 

558
01:21:53,473 --> 01:22:02,303
Without giving them any respect as my enemy I defeated them
but this one is interesting. He made me think

559
01:22:02,304 --> 01:22:07,388
To finish me, he studied all about my life

560
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:14,405
To whom I was born, where I grew up, what I studied,
my past, present, future plans all analysed

561
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:21,404
Tell me who your enemy is, I'll tell you who you are

562
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,761
Along with everything, he also collected this dad

563
01:22:29,762 --> 01:22:35,491
How did he take this I wonder
- shocking and surprising
Aiyo kanna is unhappy

564
01:22:36,142 --> 01:22:39,680
Tell me who he is kanna, I will get that area councellor

565
01:22:39,681 --> 01:22:42,790
to cut off his electricity and water connections

566
01:22:46,599 --> 01:22:52,682
Kanna his ration card and adhar card I will also cancel.
I will cancel his passport and make sure he cannot go to 
Delhi

567
01:22:53,276 --> 01:22:57,414
Brain kanna! Brain 
- Imbecile 

568
01:22:57,734 --> 01:23:00,499
I will find out what his capacity is

569
01:23:01,163 --> 01:23:06,415
Is it necessary to have another surgery doctor?
- Yes, sorry Mr. Dhruva, there's a small complication

570
01:23:06,766 --> 01:23:09,231
A clot has formed in the place where you had surgery. I have
to clear the clot

571
01:23:10,137 --> 01:23:14,553
Doctor I need to be discharged today. 
- Relax Mr. Dhruva, it is a very small surgery

572
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:21,277
You can leave tomorrow morning. If we leave it, it can
become complicated.
- Please

573
01:23:22,343 --> 01:23:23,013
Ok, doctor

574
01:23:58,066 --> 01:23:59,582
what happened?
- what happened?

575
01:23:59,883 --> 01:24:01,472
Siddharth
- What?

576
01:24:01,573 --> 01:24:03,334
What are you saying?
- Siddharth came

577
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:06,878
Dhruva no one came

578
01:24:06,879 --> 01:24:11,714
I saw him
- no one came

579
01:24:11,715 --> 01:24:18,405
Sir what are you doing? I gave sedative, take him back
- please listen to me
- No I know Siddharth came

580
01:24:36,294 --> 01:24:40,966
No one came, under sedative you are seeing things
- Trust me he came

581
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:45,211
No one came man
- I'm telling you he came, he saw me

582
01:24:45,212 --> 01:24:57,940
Doctor Ram Mohan, this is a GPS tracking device. If you
implant this into his body I can monitor him 24/7. Audio
feed via satellite comes to me as well

583
01:24:57,941 --> 01:25:04,182
With that I will know where he is, who he is seeing, what
he is planning and what he is talking about at all times.

584
01:25:05,116 --> 01:25:08,535
You just told us he was overseas, if he really came
why would he leave without killing you?

585
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:15,535
Just like how I knew where he was I didn't kill him, he
must have a reason for not killing me as well

586
01:25:19,427 --> 01:25:24,421
Ishika I asked for my car to come
- This is a car as well, it has a steering wheel too

587
01:25:24,422 --> 01:25:25,063
Okay, let's go

588
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:34,687
Gautham went to Shamshabad with some urgent work. He told
me to tell you.
- Yea I saw his message too. By the way thanks for everything

589
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,482
Keep saying it. As many thanks as you want. But between
lovers no thanks, no sorry

590
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:42,606
Hey darling
- We are not lovers right?
Uncle came. He's waiting for you

591
01:25:42,783 --> 01:25:43,590
2 minutes

592
01:25:47,551 --> 01:25:50,419
Is it hurting?
- I don't know it feels uneasy

593
01:25:50,504 --> 01:25:56,509
The doctor said until the next dose of the medicine it will
be like that. Ok take rest I will go home and come back

594
01:25:56,944 --> 01:26:01,487
No it's ok, you don't need to come back
- Why are you taking it off?

595
01:26:01,784 --> 01:26:02,420
I have some work to do, I have to go

596
01:26:02,421 --> 01:26:07,752
Do you have any sense? You just came and already say you 
want to go?
- Ishika it is a very important matter. Start heading off

597
01:26:07,753 --> 01:26:10,553
Will you always do what you want to?
What is so important?

598
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:20,429
While I was in hospital I received a call about Siddharth.
I investigated about a girl who was missing and thought
it would help me on October 3rd

599
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,562
but in that process I found that the girl was not missing,
she was raped and killed

600
01:26:24,563 --> 01:26:27,429
Who's that girl
- scientist Akshara

601
01:26:29,146 --> 01:26:32,558
I knew there had to be a different motive behind the 
raping

602
01:26:32,559 --> 01:26:35,345
so I asked her boyfriend Kamal about the incident

603
01:26:35,646 --> 01:26:42,308
Your girlfriend was raped and murdered by four people
but you still don't know anything right?

604
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,411
Sir honest to god I don't know anything

605
01:26:45,129 --> 01:26:47,619
While I was in hospital, he rang me

606
01:26:49,097 --> 01:26:54,503
sorry sir, I lied the other day. I did not know who to trust.
I trust you. Akhshara was my life. 

607
01:26:54,504 --> 01:27:03,487
She worked for Siddharth at Mother Teresa Institute as a 
scientist. They unjustly raped and killed her. Before that
incident she gave me a SD card

608
01:27:03,488 --> 01:27:09,783
In that card all of Siddharths crimes were told by her.
I will give you the SD card. Please make sure he gets
punished sir.

609
01:27:09,984 --> 01:27:13,246
Until I meet you do not tell anyone about this

610
01:27:13,247 --> 01:27:21,510
I'm going to meet Kamal at his college now. If I get that SD
card then it is game over for Siddharth

611
01:27:24,868 --> 01:27:35,362
The whole world thinks you're a good person. Please sir this
kind of medicine will bring all of the world to India and
beg us

612
01:27:35,463 --> 01:27:38,495
You're wanting the whole world to come beg India

613
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,471
I want this Indian to be begged for

614
01:27:40,472 --> 01:27:42,351
simple
- Does this not seem wrong to you?

615
01:27:42,352 --> 01:27:46,747
Make yourself a wish, nothing is wrong with getting that
wish

616
01:27:46,748 --> 01:27:53,646
I will not allow this to happen sir. I will reveal everything
about you. You are trying to stop generic medicine and tie
up with the Swiss company. 

617
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:58,451
I will tell Angelina madam what you are really doing.
- I have a bad habit...

618
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:04,542
do not tell anyone and I will let you live. 
I absolutely don't talk about these things

619
01:28:04,592 --> 01:28:11,636
Even if you kill me I will make sure the world knows how 
bad you are

620
01:28:18,511 --> 01:28:23,542
Strange. I planned to know about him with the bug but he I
am learning about myself

621
01:28:23,743 --> 01:28:30,572
He is reminding me of my mistakes. How stupid am I?
I thought the Akshara case was resolved

622
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:33,588
but I did not know she had a boyfriend. I couldnt find that
out

623
01:28:33,589 --> 01:28:36,337
You made a mistake Siddharth!

624
01:28:36,338 --> 01:28:39,650
Kanna you made a mistake?
- He is not my enemy, he is my employee. 

625
01:28:39,651 --> 01:28:46,427
Anything I don't know he is finding out and telling me while
taking his wage and being an informer. 

626
01:28:49,228 --> 01:28:51,411
We will see
- We will see

627
01:28:53,212 --> 01:28:55,456
I will see
- You will see

628
01:28:56,457 --> 01:28:58,517
Shall we have lunch?

629
01:29:13,445 --> 01:29:14,447
The number you have dialled is switched off

630
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:19,301
Where is the SD card?

631
01:29:27,484 --> 01:29:30,677
Hi Dhruva, whats up?
- Gautham you are in Shamshabad right?
Yea I am, why?

632
01:29:30,678 --> 01:29:33,341
- are you in an important job?
No just a tiny robbery case but its ok tell me
- Ok listen

633
01:29:33,342 --> 01:29:38,495
- Kamal wanted to give me a SD card which contains evidence
strongly against Siddharth

634
01:29:38,496 --> 01:29:43,301
- We were supposed to meet 15 km from Shamshabad at CMR 
college
Ok

635
01:29:43,302 --> 01:29:46,918
- But when I call him, no response. I suspect something
is wrong. Little help

636
01:29:47,019 --> 01:29:48,302
Yea sure. Tell me what to do?

637
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:56,316
- If I leave from here and then he comes it will cause a 
problem. So 24/56 Bank st muduranagar is his address. You
have to go and meet him personally. 

638
01:29:56,317 --> 01:29:57,466
Yep I'm close, I'm going right away
- Thanks

639
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:00,178
Call Abbas

640
01:30:04,494 --> 01:30:08,092
Abbas, there is a police officer called Gautham coming to you
he cannot find that SD card. 

641
01:30:08,193 --> 01:30:09,193
Yes sir

642
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:11,078
Ey there is police coming. Hurry up. 

643
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:14,123
Why aren't you telling me when I ask? Where is the SD card?

644
01:30:20,863 --> 01:30:21,625
where is the SD card?

645
01:30:29,603 --> 01:30:30,684
Go go

646
01:31:08,655 --> 01:31:09,541
Sir

647
01:31:17,442 --> 01:31:19,530
Give this to Dhruva sir no matter what

648
01:31:19,531 --> 01:31:21,764
please sir, please

649
01:31:28,765 --> 01:31:31,485
I'll kill him. Give it. Give me the SD card. 

650
01:31:33,004 --> 01:31:33,892
Let him go

651
01:31:33,933 --> 01:31:36,493
Give me the SD card otherwise I'll kill him

652
01:31:37,394 --> 01:31:38,962
Don't do anything to him. I'll give it.

653
01:31:39,478 --> 01:31:48,451
This is Akshara's last wish sir, don't give it sir. 
please sir. Don't sir. 
- Don't do anything to him

654
01:31:48,952 --> 01:31:50,045
Go sir, please leave. 

655
01:31:52,046 --> 01:31:53,489
Don't do anything to him. Here I'm giving it

656
01:31:53,549 --> 01:31:54,694
Hey, let him go

657
01:32:24,794 --> 01:32:31,848
Yes Abbas
- The policeman escaped with the SD card. I will catch him
no matter what

658
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:32,753
Dam it!

659
01:32:34,554 --> 01:32:38,883
Dhruva
- Hey what happened? Why aren't you lifting your phone?
- Hold on Abbas

660
01:32:38,884 --> 01:32:42,616
Sorry man, as you suspected things got out of hand here.
I couldn't save Kamal but I have the SD card.

661
01:32:42,617 --> 01:32:43,402
Where do you want me to come

662
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:51,840
Towards Gacha Boli. I'll come in the opposite direction
and get the SD card.
- Abbas towards Gacha Boli, I'll call you

663
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:56,678
Where is the card? Where is the SD card?

664
01:33:57,598 --> 01:34:06,459
I won't tell you
- If I found you one kilometer ahead, I would have killed you
in my chemical factory and mixed you in the chemicals

665
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:11,506
- this is my new factory that is going to open in a few months.
with your death it will be opened

666
01:34:13,103 --> 01:34:18,407
- This is only 0.0001 percent of the crimes I have commited

667
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:26,590
- In these 20 years I focused more on not feeling any guilt
after my crimes than on my business

668
01:34:26,591 --> 01:34:30,570
- I did not miss any details when committing crimes,
where did that Dhruva come from?

669
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:41,439
Dhruva not only slipped past your details but he was born
to destroy your whole network

670
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:47,638
- Hey, hey hey, don't praise him that much. I'll tell you 
his future so listen

671
01:34:49,339 --> 01:34:56,375
- Everyone and everything around him I will push further away,
play on his emotions, make him crazy and kill him

672
01:34:57,147 --> 01:35:02,612
No chance. He has no other objectives other than to stop you

673
01:35:05,206 --> 01:35:13,460
I'm telling you now! Your time is ending. Your time is ending!
Remember this!

674
01:35:14,461 --> 01:35:19,237
Your time... Your time is ending

675
01:35:19,238 --> 01:35:26,457
You're finished! Time.... time
Your time is ending!

676
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:32,384
Sir I checked his entire bike, I couldn't find that SD card

677
01:35:35,413 --> 01:35:38,139
Where did you hide the SD card? Where'd you hide it?
- I wont tell

678
01:35:40,524 --> 01:35:42,689
where did you hide the SD card? Tell me!
- Abbas

679
01:36:04,224 --> 01:36:07,272
Where is the SD card? Tell me!

680
01:36:07,273 --> 01:36:11,601
I won't tell you
- Abbas he is not telling us

681
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:18,587
Using his phone we will message him and lure him here

682
01:36:27,476 --> 01:36:27,939
Gautham!

683
01:36:28,219 --> 01:36:28,943
Gautham!

684
01:36:31,626 --> 01:36:32,531
Gautham!

685
01:36:49,576 --> 01:36:53,577
Hey, hey, hey, leave him. Please
Gautham. Please leave him

686
01:39:46,444 --> 01:39:52,668
Officer killed on the road after taking drugs and roaming
around

687
01:39:54,469 --> 01:39:56,663
This is more upsetting than his death

688
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:59,719
A guy like him, this kind of death. Cha!

689
01:40:20,462 --> 01:40:24,517
Gautham died because of me. I made a big mistake by telling
him to go there.

690
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:29,519
No one could have known about the SD card. I don't
understand how anyone could have found out

691
01:40:37,317 --> 01:40:40,554
Ishika did you move that pin?
- Which pin?

692
01:40:40,808 --> 01:40:42,596
- No I didn't, why?

693
01:40:42,597 --> 01:40:45,704
That pin has been moved

694
01:40:47,373 --> 01:40:57,465
If it wasn't me or you, who else would have moved it? Did 
someone come here? Or did Siddharth come himself? Ishika
test the fingerprints on this pin

695
01:40:57,466 --> 01:40:59,043
Hey Darling
- Hi

696
01:41:04,338 --> 01:41:05,235
Hold this for a sec

697
01:41:05,236 --> 01:41:08,478
If we had Siddharths fingerprints as a reference it would
have been easier

698
01:41:13,517 --> 01:41:16,592
Here, this gun case has Siddharths fingerprints

699
01:41:16,593 --> 01:41:20,603
Are you sure?
- Of course he gave me this box that day

700
01:41:20,604 --> 01:41:24,396
I have not touched it since that day. I was wearing gloves 
when I took it from him

701
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:36,433
Fingerprints have matched. Siddharth came.

702
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:55,536
If Siddharth came here then that means he has started to
treat me specially.
- Why put a pin on this girl?

703
01:41:55,537 --> 01:41:58,449
This is 2010 Miss India Naina right?

704
01:42:03,064 --> 01:42:04,623
These are the event photos

705
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:12,617
Wait that is Preethi Sarogi right?
- Preethi Sarogi?

706
01:42:12,618 --> 01:42:14,341
Yes, Siddharths girlfriend

707
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:16,431
How is the wine?
- Excellent

708
01:42:16,432 --> 01:42:23,473
First placed Naina was with him in Switzerland, and Preethi
is in a living relationship with him. Something is wrong
There has to be a connection between the event and him

709
01:42:23,785 --> 01:42:29,326
Hey there is a link on conspiracy on events. Actually Preethi
got more votes

710
01:42:29,327 --> 01:42:32,474
but because Naina won there are a lot of comments against
that decision.

711
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:39,451
As you said Miss Preethi Sarogi is miss India crown
favourite

712
01:42:39,452 --> 01:42:48,590
There is a good chance of her becoming miss world as well.
- No, she shouldn't become miss world and travel the world

713
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:57,444
She must think I am her world and depend on me. By the time
we leave I must be in her heart. See who else can win this
contest amongst the contestants

714
01:42:57,445 --> 01:43:00,245
I found a girl with the qualities you asked, her name is
Naina

715
01:43:03,246 --> 01:43:08,494
Make her the winner. The final round is about to start,
before it does tell her that her dad passed away

716
01:43:08,495 --> 01:43:10,496
What? he died?
- He will die

717
01:43:10,497 --> 01:43:14,605
In 30 minutes Irfan will kill her dad

718
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:20,568
Preethi will not have any flights to go to Hyderabad so
she will come in my private jet

719
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:43,558
Dhruva, what is this 8?

720
01:43:45,059 --> 01:43:47,684
Siddharths downfall

721
01:44:06,409 --> 01:44:08,667
Kamal, 25 Bell, he has the SD card

722
01:44:30,553 --> 01:44:35,577
Sir your breakfast and also the det...
- Newspaper right? Put it there

723
01:46:34,537 --> 01:46:35,251
Thankyou

724
01:46:55,174 --> 01:46:56,080
Dhruva?

725
01:46:57,452 --> 01:47:00,168
What is this? What happened? What is this blood?

726
01:47:00,169 --> 01:47:03,510
- Leave it
If you tell me then I can help

727
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:05,235
Do not ask me anything, go from here.

728
01:47:07,308 --> 01:47:10,504
Dhruva...
Ishika leave. I want to be alone

729
01:47:11,567 --> 01:47:20,520
We are all here to help you. Even now without Siddharth
knowing I set an appointment at 4 to meet with Preethi. 
We will find something for sure

730
01:47:20,521 --> 01:47:29,457
- So what if we find anything? Huh? Tell me. What's the 
benefit? Even that he will know in the next minute. He is 
observing my every movement

731
01:47:30,041 --> 01:47:32,567
Read this out
- Read it as it is written right?
Excuse me gentlemen

732
01:47:34,407 --> 01:47:40,318
He killed Kamal. My Gautham is gone.

733
01:47:42,107 --> 01:47:51,590
I don't know what I'm doing. Everyone that is close to me
he is taking away one by one

734
01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:55,590
It hasn't finished yet
- What's left?

735
01:47:57,206 --> 01:48:02,486
When you said you will choose an enemy to test your
capacity I felt very proud of you

736
01:48:02,487 --> 01:48:07,687
You chose your enemy, but now you are obsessed with him
and losing yourself

737
01:48:07,688 --> 01:48:15,735
Thats why targeting Siddharth has now made you the 
target. You think Siddharth is the only thing in your life
but he is easily surpassing people like you all the time

738
01:48:16,436 --> 01:48:19,457
If you're like this then you can't do anything
- Yeah I can't!

739
01:48:20,358 --> 01:48:22,548
Happy? I can't do anything

740
01:48:23,449 --> 01:48:25,308
Leave me alone

741
01:48:26,309 --> 01:48:31,576
go...go.... GO!

742
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:42,486
Is this even you?

743
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:50,491
Everybody loves your calmness. How did you give it up?

744
01:48:52,534 --> 01:48:55,555
Think calmly, everything will come back

745
01:48:57,356 --> 01:49:06,613
Otherwise, you will lose everything you have. I have plans 
on marrying you and living a life with you. I am not telling
you because of that

746
01:49:06,614 --> 01:49:09,880
I'm telling you because I want Dhruva to win

747
01:49:10,281 --> 01:49:15,622
I have told you what needs to be told. After that it is up to
you

748
01:49:26,354 --> 01:49:30,472
"Everybody loves your calmness. How did you give it up?"

749
01:49:31,584 --> 01:49:34,083
"Think calmly, everything will come back"

750
01:49:34,089 --> 01:49:43,505
"Otherwise, you will lose everything you have. I have plans 
on marrying you and living a life with you. I am not telling
you because of that"

751
01:49:43,506 --> 01:49:47,915
"I have told you what needs to be told. After that it
is up to you"

752
01:49:55,320 --> 01:50:01,302
"Even now without Siddharth
knowing I set an appointment at 4 to meet with Preethi.
We will find something for sure"

753
01:50:01,303 --> 01:50:09,503
Call Preethi
- Hey sweetheart
Shall we go out? I don't know maybe a drive or something
- what time?

754
01:50:09,543 --> 01:50:10,537
Four o'clock?

755
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,531
I have a beauty parlour appointment

756
01:50:20,348 --> 01:50:23,633
I'm going to come home now, I'll join you for lunch.
What do you say?

757
01:50:23,634 --> 01:50:29,545
Ok darling, I'll see you then
- love you sweetheart
love you too darling

758
01:50:31,246 --> 01:50:32,440
I'm going to kill Preethi

759
01:50:33,441 --> 01:50:34,226
What? Preethi?

760
01:50:36,403 --> 01:50:40,417
Please tell me anything with a lead kanna otherwise my
heart will stop

761
01:50:40,418 --> 01:50:49,706
First time I saw her my heart skipped a beat. With a 
brilliant plan she became mine. I think I love her dad.

762
01:50:50,307 --> 01:50:51,767
But Preethi betrayed me

763
01:50:51,768 --> 01:50:56,683
She lied to me and is going to meet Ishika. That is
betrayal right?

764
01:50:57,584 --> 01:51:06,508
If its a lie you can send them to the naughty corner, scold
them but killing them? Please think about it kanna

765
01:51:06,509 --> 01:51:08,551
- Excuse me a 1kg dark chocolate cake
Cake? 

766
01:51:08,552 --> 01:51:11,041
You are smart kanna. 
- Anything special sir?

767
01:51:11,042 --> 01:51:13,088
For someone special 

768
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,559
Hello Ishika?
- Yep?
I have an important matter to tell you can you come over?

769
01:51:20,565 --> 01:51:23,233
No I wont come. If there is anything tell me over the phone
- Why don't you come please?

770
01:51:24,502 --> 01:51:31,534
What is this? Suddenly your tones changed? Am I speaking
to Dhruva?
- Yes.. If you come you'll know

771
01:51:32,045 --> 01:51:32,945
Okay, Im coming

772
01:51:33,146 --> 01:51:41,470
Excellent. Dhruva is about to propose his love for Ishika.
That's why he told her to come over.
- Thats good news kanna

773
01:51:41,471 --> 01:51:51,583
I am about to kill my love and he is about to fall in love.
He has to feel the pain of losing the girl you love

774
01:51:52,284 --> 01:51:57,585
As soon as Dhruva says he loves Ishika, the next minute I
will kill her

775
01:51:58,379 --> 01:51:59,675
That pain he has to feel it too!

776
01:52:00,189 --> 01:52:07,541
He does have to know... that's why
- Whenever I talk to you I get clarity. Thanks for the help

777
01:52:08,093 --> 01:52:12,594
I helped in planning the death of two people?
How did this happen?

778
01:52:30,267 --> 01:52:33,298
Abbas where are you?
- Two minutes sir I'll be in position

779
01:53:48,472 --> 01:53:50,176
Ishika has arrived sir

780
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:04,473
Sir, she is going inside
- Keep watching

781
01:54:05,474 --> 01:54:06,272
I'll tell you when to kill her

782
01:54:30,046 --> 01:54:32,191
Why did you call me?

783
01:54:33,356 --> 01:54:36,599
tell me... tell me?

784
01:54:40,567 --> 01:54:44,575
Sir I have a clear shot to the target
- hold

785
01:54:51,185 --> 01:54:54,565
Tell me what's up

786
01:54:58,566 --> 01:55:05,577
It's nothing. It's that IG's sons birthday. They invited us
so I called you to go to the party

787
01:55:06,578 --> 01:55:09,674
What are you saying? Is that why you called me over?

788
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:15,540
Sir shall I?
- Hold on
Ok

789
01:55:15,641 --> 01:55:21,660
You talked so romantically before?
- Because you left angrily, I talked that way to cool you
down

790
01:55:23,461 --> 01:55:27,473
Tell me the truth
- What else is there? Why do you keep asking the same thing?

791
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:35,302
- If you do not want to come then don't
Because you talked that way I thought you were going to 
propose so I came with my hopes up

792
01:55:35,303 --> 01:55:37,569
- Do you have any common sense?

793
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:44,478
- You always think about love. Do you not think of anything
else? I don't even have any love for you

794
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:47,492
- It won't happen this lifetime. Leave me alone!

795
01:55:49,502 --> 01:55:56,456
Why are you behaving like this? Instead of talking like this
why not just kill me?

796
01:55:56,657 --> 01:56:01,558
The biggest mistake in my life is to love you
- Abort

797
01:56:01,759 --> 01:56:02,849
Any problem sir?

798
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:05,419
Do as I say
- Right sir

799
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,675
- lucky you
The words you say hurts me every moment...

800
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:26,414
"Siddharth planted a bug. He can hear everything.
I love you"

801
01:56:27,050 --> 01:56:31,317
Hey how many times do I have to tell you, leave

802
01:56:52,462 --> 01:56:54,296
Hey darling
- Hey sweetheart

803
01:56:54,297 --> 01:56:59,646
How was your day?
- I have a feeling it's going to get better

804
01:57:13,413 --> 01:57:17,690
"Even now without Siddharth knowing I set an appointment
with Preethi at 4 o'clock"

805
01:57:26,351 --> 01:57:27,712
Wait a moment

806
01:57:36,193 --> 01:57:41,125
From here on do not try to help me by meeting Preethi or
anyone else

807
01:57:41,126 --> 01:57:45,540
because there is no benefit to me
- I didn't even call Preethi
you said hair appointment?

808
01:57:46,065 --> 01:57:49,461
- I only said that to try and calm you down before

809
01:58:02,272 --> 01:58:07,372
"I have called the doctor. He will come tomorrow morning to
remove the bug. Until then let's celebrate love!"

810
02:01:27,433 --> 02:01:32,505
Yes Ishika? No don't come I don't feel well. I'm going to
Chillkgot temple

811
02:01:33,011 --> 02:01:35,589
I'll talk to you after I return.

812
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:44,576
Kamal, I don't know if youll get this or not. I don't 
know if you will see me alive again Kamal. 

813
02:03:45,426 --> 02:03:47,463
Find her! She will be around here somewhere

814
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:49,500
If you find her kill her!

815
02:03:51,565 --> 02:03:57,571
Kamal they raped me! 

816
02:04:03,072 --> 02:04:11,457
You have to believe me Preethi. This is the report from 
miss India committee. They told you your dad had died
before you went to the final round

817
02:04:11,458 --> 02:04:18,773
The time then was 7:15. But the time your dad passed away
was at 7:45. Siddharth got your dad killed through an
accident

818
02:04:19,569 --> 02:04:24,020
He got you emotionally disturbed and to depend on him. He
made Naina miss India in your place

819
02:04:24,021 --> 02:04:27,099
and is now using her in his businesses

820
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:29,046
This is the FIR and post mortem report.

821
02:04:30,509 --> 02:04:34,439
This is records of some of the crimes Siddharth has
committed. Please do not trust him again

822
02:04:38,595 --> 02:04:40,712
They are Aksharas parents. All the documents you require
are in this folder

823
02:04:40,713 --> 02:04:45,875
Akhshara was always thinking about her research. We did
not think this would happen to her

824
02:04:47,082 --> 02:04:52,103
Tomorrows meeting will announce generic medicines to not
proceed in India and what we have now is enough by the CM

825
02:04:52,104 --> 02:04:58,598
I have faxed you all the appropriate details. 
- I won't let it happen that way. Generic medicine will
come to India

826
02:05:03,238 --> 02:05:07,545
Preethi replace this file. This one favour will be enough.
Thanks

827
02:05:21,553 --> 02:05:27,399
Ahhh car key... Dheeraj hang on a minute. Take dad into the
press meet.

828
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:32,759
Tell me when the CM comes. I'll join you. This policy will
give a great benefit to us

829
02:05:48,561 --> 02:05:50,427
Hello Ravinder, it was a good thing we shadowed Abbas.

830
02:05:50,428 --> 02:05:57,403
He is telling everyone that he raped Akshara and killed her
then framed 4 other guys.

831
02:05:58,548 --> 02:06:03,535
All this was told to me by Deepak. But when I call him he 
doesn't pick up and doesnt reply to my messages. I suspect
something is wrong

832
02:06:03,836 --> 02:06:07,594
I know that he caught Abbas in Nampalli but I don't know
his exact location at the moment

833
02:06:12,444 --> 02:06:18,588
I am going to play a small trick. I am going to call his
brother Irfan using Siddharths voice and ask where Abbas
is

834
02:06:19,383 --> 02:06:24,547
In the mean time come to Nampali with our squad. We have
to arrest Abbas today

835
02:06:25,548 --> 02:06:29,356
Call Abbas
- Ay phone ringing

836
02:06:32,555 --> 02:06:33,115
Call Irfan

837
02:06:34,116 --> 02:06:41,582
Who's calling me at this time? Hello
- Where are you?
I'm working sir

838
02:06:41,583 --> 02:06:45,757
- Where is Abbas?
He is in the Nampalli guest house sir

839
02:06:45,758 --> 02:06:47,328
Dhruva is looking for Abbas to arrest him. 

840
02:06:47,329 --> 02:06:52,524
He is going to call you looking for Abbas details using
my voice. Be careful with that ok?

841
02:06:52,525 --> 02:06:57,699
I am a big cheat my self. Who is going to cheat me? I'll
take care of it. Dont worry

842
02:07:01,448 --> 02:07:02,385
Ravinder, there is no need to call Irfan.

843
02:07:02,489 --> 02:07:08,584
Abbas is in the Mohinibad farmhouse. I found him by
tracking his mobile. I am going there now. Come with our 
team

844
02:07:10,553 --> 02:07:11,291
Call Irfan

845
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:17,560
As sir said someone is calling me. Hello?
- Where is your brother Nampalli or Mohinibad farmhouse?

846
02:07:17,561 --> 02:07:23,376
Oi idiot. Do you think I will not recognise you if you
do some mimicry?

847
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:24,255
I am Siddharth talking

848
02:07:24,256 --> 02:07:31,303
Ahhh Siddharth. If you are Siddharth then why not act in
movies. Why are you calling me?

849
02:07:31,304 --> 02:07:33,584
Where is your brother man?
- I won't tell you

850
02:07:35,485 --> 02:07:37,421
Call Dheeraj Chandra

851
02:07:38,692 --> 02:07:42,378
Dheeraj I'm on my way. But I cannot attend the meeting.
Bring dad outside for a second.
- Okay, sir

852
02:07:45,037 --> 02:07:48,126
This is an important press meet. I prepared a speech for
you

853
02:07:49,186 --> 02:07:51,746
Read what I wrote as it is
- As it is right?

854
02:07:53,491 --> 02:07:57,515
Dad
- Kanna
head up!

855
02:07:58,036 --> 02:08:08,550
After that we forced ICP Gautham to take drugs and left him
on the highway to get killed. I did it because Siddharth
told me to

856
02:08:25,559 --> 02:08:31,524
Minister Changalrayudu is going to speak about generic
medicine

857
02:08:31,525 --> 02:08:33,641
Hello to all

858
02:08:34,642 --> 02:08:42,810
When I swore to become the minister, I swore to make the
country without diseases

859
02:08:42,818 --> 02:08:43,437
Has this happened?

860
02:08:43,442 --> 02:08:47,501
It has not. It will not and in future I will not let it

861
02:08:49,589 --> 02:08:50,806
Ay what are you saying?

862
02:08:51,992 --> 02:08:58,537
For the good of the nations Mrs. Angelina came with a good
heart to bring generic medicines

863
02:08:58,538 --> 02:09:03,186
the minister said we have to stop it because it is not good
for the pharmaceutical business

864
02:09:03,187 --> 02:09:07,322
In that moment a lot of money was made that day

865
02:09:07,323 --> 02:09:11,849
because of this the MLA minority government became rich

866
02:09:15,124 --> 02:09:23,573
before Mrs. Angelina died she signed a contract from the
office of the minister to bring generic medicines.

867
02:09:23,574 --> 02:09:28,616
For those ministers I have kept this document a secret

868
02:09:28,716 --> 02:09:31,291
Do you know what you are doing
- Are you crazy?

869
02:09:31,292 --> 02:09:32,690
Who told him to read this?

870
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:41,172
Why is everyone shouting at me? No... My son is very clever
he always forsees everything

871
02:09:41,173 --> 02:09:46,464
My son said that I would become the prime minister one day.
It seems like it's time

872
02:09:56,155 --> 02:09:58,564
He has come lets go
- Abbas

873
02:10:03,253 --> 02:10:08,435
Abbas, Abbas, Abbas
- I won't tell you anything

874
02:10:10,436 --> 02:10:18,249
Abbas! Get up
- I won't tell you. Go!
What did you say to them? You have no control!

875
02:10:32,426 --> 02:10:36,681
Hey Abbas, Abbas! Get up
- Tell me!
Abbas!

876
02:10:36,682 --> 02:10:43,290
ey go, go, Go

877
02:10:43,652 --> 02:10:44,500
Abbas. Will you come or not?

878
02:10:45,730 --> 02:10:49,466
Ok... Shoot
They are coming man

879
02:10:55,624 --> 02:10:58,742
I'll tell you the truth. Gautham was killed by the car

880
02:10:59,466 --> 02:11:02,680
But I did not drive the car

881
02:11:04,465 --> 02:11:05,692
Siddharth killed him

882
02:11:12,327 --> 02:11:17,697
Shit! who killed him?
He was very important evidence

883
02:11:28,414 --> 02:11:34,631
This better be good. Why did you call me that many times?
- Sir your dad is reading a different speech to what you 
prepared

884
02:11:34,632 --> 02:11:37,311
he is revealing all the crimes. There will be a big
punishment

885
02:11:37,312 --> 02:11:40,112
He's reading a different one?
- Yes, all the reporters are watching

886
02:11:40,113 --> 02:11:42,457
All the public are getting angry

887
02:11:42,623 --> 02:11:47,438
Ok, before he says another word tell them he has a heart
attack

888
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:51,048
Take him to the hospital and let me know
- Ok sir
I'm coming

889
02:11:51,210 --> 02:11:57,650
This minority government will always....
- The speech you are reading is not your sons, it has been
changed

890
02:11:57,651 --> 02:12:00,340
Oh it has change... What its been changed??
- Microphone

891
02:12:00,346 --> 02:12:03,504
Turn off the microphone
- Speak calmly, calmly

892
02:12:03,890 --> 02:12:05,587
Dheeraj what should we do now?

893
02:12:05,588 --> 02:12:09,380
Say you have a heart attack and need to go to the  hospital
- Did my son say this?
- Yes

894
02:12:09,566 --> 02:12:13,487
Everyone I apparently have a heart attack
- heart is on the other side

895
02:12:15,248 --> 02:12:18,530
Someone call the ambulance
Ambulance, I do not know anything

896
02:12:24,475 --> 02:12:25,268
I'll manage it

897
02:12:27,588 --> 02:12:31,473
I gave this news about the generic medicine to
Changalrayudu to read out to everyone

898
02:12:31,474 --> 02:12:34,637
Why he changed these words and said what he said? I don't
know

899
02:12:35,404 --> 02:12:37,569
I will definitely take action on him

900
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:41,706
We will pass the contract. From tomorrow generic medicine
will come into the market

901
02:12:46,390 --> 02:12:47,287
Perfect

902
02:12:50,132 --> 02:12:55,423
Sir why did your father talk like that?
- This is what your father read

903
02:13:03,428 --> 02:13:08,753
Kanna have you come? I have understood what a heart
attack is now. I didn't think I would see you again

904
02:13:08,754 --> 02:13:11,099
what is this? Do you just read whatever is there?

905
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:14,408
You're the one who said read it as it is Kanna

906
02:13:16,409 --> 02:13:19,410
You're an ...
- Again he's started to blame me in English

907
02:13:20,411 --> 02:13:25,617
I'm remembering a story
- Story? Please tell me kanna I'll relax a bit

908
02:13:25,618 --> 02:13:31,859
Once in a village there was a king....
- I know this story! That king has 7 sons

909
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:35,472
- You tell me Kanna
He lost all trust in people

910
02:13:35,473 --> 02:13:37,817
So one day he bought a monkey

911
02:13:37,818 --> 02:13:41,030
he taught the monkey everything

912
02:13:41,031 --> 02:13:42,074
and made him his bodyguard

913
02:13:42,075 --> 02:13:49,517
and kept him there 24 hours a day as a watchman
- Ohhh is it??

914
02:13:49,518 --> 02:13:52,258
One day while the king was sleeping a small mosquito came

915
02:13:52,435 --> 02:13:57,819
The mosquito was disturbing the king
- aiyo
The monkey tried everything to get rid of the mosquito

916
02:13:57,820 --> 02:14:04,015
but it still didn't go away. Then the mosquito went and
stood on the kings neck

917
02:14:04,016 --> 02:14:13,674
The monkey got angry and got a big sword and with one swing
the monkey got the mosquito on the kings neck

918
02:14:13,683 --> 02:14:14,566
The mosquito must have died?

919
02:14:19,557 --> 02:14:22,051
What? Even with the sword the mosquito didn't die?

920
02:14:24,052 --> 02:14:26,634
Oh, he did not die?

921
02:14:32,154 --> 02:14:36,465
What is it kanna?
Your hands are very cold

922
02:14:41,466 --> 02:14:43,889
Just now the CM called from the campus

923
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:47,214
He is threatening to make your father resign or they will
suspend him

924
02:14:55,294 --> 02:14:56,198
Sir
- Yes Dhruva

925
02:14:56,199 --> 02:15:02,197
A video of Siddharth killing Irfans brother, Abbas has
come out as evidence. I heard this from an informer

926
02:15:02,198 --> 02:15:06,414
I will get that evidence by tonight. I have more evidence
against Siddharth

927
02:15:06,415 --> 02:15:10,529
I need the support and formalities to arrest Siddharth sir

928
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:16,693
What? You want to arrest Siddharth Abhimanyu?
He's a scientist and on top of that a ministers son

929
02:15:16,694 --> 02:15:18,361
Looks like you haven't heard the latest news

930
02:15:18,362 --> 02:15:22,762
His own party is against him. If you don't believe me
you can check
- Are you sure?
Yes sir

931
02:15:23,529 --> 02:15:26,217
Sir ACP Dhruva came to me with evidence against
Siddharth

932
02:15:29,218 --> 02:15:31,306
He is telling me if the evidence is strong then take action
immediately

933
02:15:32,307 --> 02:15:35,486
The CM wants you to meet him tonight with the evidence
- Sure sir

934
02:15:35,635 --> 02:15:36,479
I'll get ready for the meeting

935
02:15:39,442 --> 02:15:42,151
How did this happen? Abbas... Abbas

936
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:52,283
Irfan
- Sir, he killed me brother
I told you he would kill your brother

937
02:15:53,284 --> 02:16:00,578
Tell me where he is I will kill him
- I'll take care of that but you need to do something first
Tell me sir

938
02:16:01,379 --> 02:16:02,549
Kill my dad

939
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:12,465
You want me to kill your dad?
- He is going to drag us down with him. call me after
he is dead

940
02:16:12,466 --> 02:16:13,399
Ok sir

941
02:16:33,512 --> 02:16:37,327
Sir as you wished my driver killed your dad while coming
back from the hospital

942
02:16:37,678 --> 02:16:42,628
Is he really dead? Have you checked?
- In front of my eyes he died

943
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,424
Namaste sir

944
02:16:56,425 --> 02:16:58,839
What's the point in feeling bad now? You should have thought
about it earlier

945
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:04,391
Why did you do this to my dad sir?
- If I didn't you want me to laugh with him?

946
02:17:04,392 --> 02:17:11,147
You want me to just sit and watch while he talks like 
that? Because he is a party member I suspended him and left
him. If it was up to me I would have taken a bigger action

947
02:17:12,148 --> 02:17:17,610
What's worse than this? You killed him sir?

948
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:25,538
What? Me killing your dad? Take them outside
- Sir you all heard he threatend in front of you he would
take a bigger action

949
02:17:26,298 --> 02:17:29,538
What are you on about? Why would I kill your dad?
Has your dad really died?

950
02:17:29,783 --> 02:17:38,532
What is this sir? You killed him and are asking if he is
dead? He said two bad things about you. That doesn't mean
you hire a truck and kill him

951
02:17:39,429 --> 02:17:46,200
He burnt up and died. 
- If someone said I did it does that mean you believe it?
Not anyone sir, the driver told me it was you

952
02:17:46,394 --> 02:17:52,872
Why would I kill Changalarayadu? I made him an MLA, I made
him a minister. I didn't kill Changalarayadu

953
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:59,596
I know. I killed him myself

954
02:18:03,269 --> 02:18:07,337
I heard you issued a warrant for my arrest?
- That is the talk from others

955
02:18:07,338 --> 02:18:16,272
If they say it will you allow it? There are 57
representatives under you  that are waiting for my word.
what are you going to do?

956
02:18:16,286 --> 02:18:21,479
A warrant!?
- How did you kill your own dad?
Habit

957
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:28,590
You dont understand? 20 years ago you thought I went to
prison for a murder you committed?

958
02:18:30,591 --> 02:18:33,578
Yeah in my anger I hit him against the table

959
02:18:33,579 --> 02:18:39,146
a broken glass piece went into his neck
- that moment the glass went into him I decided to make
my dad an MLA

960
02:18:39,147 --> 02:18:53,383
I was fixed on going to jail but without dieing that dog
still had some breath left. If he dies what I want would
happen. So I killed him

961
02:18:54,884 --> 02:19:01,633
I know how to make things mine. If they do not become
mine I also know how to get out of it

962
02:19:02,434 --> 02:19:03,447
What should I do now?

963
02:19:04,212 --> 02:19:10,202
My dads successor should be one of my men. Generic
medicine policy should be contracted by me

964
02:19:10,278 --> 02:19:20,366
Anyone who has evidence against me you have to inform me.
You must also solute my dads ashes with a 21 gun shot
ceremony

965
02:19:21,867 --> 02:19:24,228
I got elected by the people because I told them I would
do good

966
02:19:24,229 --> 02:19:27,318
How can I betray them?

967
02:19:27,319 --> 02:19:32,077
God cannot always do good as well. How much are we then?

968
02:20:17,504 --> 02:20:19,776
My deepest condolences

969
02:20:24,377 --> 02:20:28,203
No matter how many times evil wins, if good wins once that
is enough

970
02:20:41,169 --> 02:20:42,136
Positions

971
02:20:49,444 --> 02:20:58,360
20 years ago when I saw you, I feared for this nation.
But 20 years later I saw him and am proud

972
02:21:02,301 --> 02:21:11,575
Our country has the most diabetic patients in the world. 
There is a plant in our sea that can cure this. With this
it is cheap to create medicines for diabetics

973
02:21:11,576 --> 02:21:21,374
In 6 months this will cure diabetes permanently. This is
my hard work but Siddharth took this from me and is
trying to sell it to other nations

974
02:21:21,375 --> 02:21:26,721
If this happens then for at least 10 years this medicine
will not be found for us

975
02:21:26,726 --> 02:21:35,470
While the drug was in testing phase he sampled it and
tried it on new borns. It killed 18 innocent babies

976
02:21:35,471 --> 02:21:37,609
In a few moments they will kill me too

977
02:21:43,413 --> 02:21:46,466
Kamal be careful

978
02:21:47,467 --> 02:21:49,739
This is the only evidence for the crimes he has committed

979
02:22:01,598 --> 02:22:05,214
for all the crimes that he is accused of, Abbas has helped
him and this is a video confession

980
02:22:10,344 --> 02:22:16,607
Dheeraj Chandra, Jayanth Suri and Irfan Ali are his allies
and they are plundering the country. These are my detailed
reports

981
02:22:17,608 --> 02:22:21,266
Yes sir, we checked the reports. Whatever he said is true

982
02:22:21,267 --> 02:22:25,210
Mr. Siddharth you need to give an explanation for all these
accusations by tomorrow otherwise you will be found guilty

983
02:22:25,211 --> 02:22:33,254
And the court issues you to be in jail for today. Mr.
Dhruva take charge

984
02:22:33,410 --> 02:22:34,283
Ok sir

985
02:22:36,054 --> 02:22:40,190
Phone
- Excuse me sir
- It's ok

986
02:22:42,132 --> 02:22:44,252
I'll be at the meeting tomorrow 5:30pm

987
02:22:50,223 --> 02:22:52,789
You've arrested him, leave his encounter with us

988
02:22:53,161 --> 02:22:54,606
We will kill him like the dog he is

989
02:22:54,607 --> 02:23:00,360
then we will be in peace. We are not the ones to take
revenge. It should be Gautham so lets send him to
Gautham

990
02:23:00,656 --> 02:23:04,249
We have also determined the place of his encounter. When
you take him to the court tomorrow

991
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:07,538
instead of going to the court, divert to a different
route. We will take care of the rest

992
02:23:21,222 --> 02:23:25,640
Hey Siddharth, shall we talk for a few minutes without this
mic, bug or technology?

993
02:23:25,641 --> 02:23:28,838
Looks like the bug disturbed you heaps?
- A lot

994
02:23:29,060 --> 02:23:31,107
Vijay 5 minutes

995
02:23:33,494 --> 02:23:37,354
Let's talk about a deal
- Deal? I like deals

996
02:23:38,351 --> 02:23:41,378
How much do you want? 100 crore?

997
02:23:41,998 --> 02:23:43,208
200 crores?

998
02:23:44,374 --> 02:23:45,602
Two hundred crores?

999
02:23:47,483 --> 02:23:54,312
Whatever medicine you created and killed Akshara for, I
have now made the patent rights under her name

1000
02:23:56,346 --> 02:23:59,486
In the end Akshara got what she deserved right?
- What she deserves?!

1001
02:23:59,487 --> 02:24:03,259
I discovered that formula. She doesn't even know what
that formula is

1002
02:24:03,260 --> 02:24:08,898
Because she said something you changed the patents? I
worked hard and discovered it

1003
02:24:10,221 --> 02:24:14,300
I know. She didn't say anything, I made it look like she did.

1004
02:24:14,618 --> 02:24:18,678
That medicine was discovered by Siddharth but he is looking
to sell it and maximise profits for himself

1005
02:24:18,972 --> 02:24:28,766
I told him it is not correct. I argued with him. But he
said I worked hard so it is my choice

1006
02:24:31,503 --> 02:24:35,661
I edited it from your discovery to her discovery

1007
02:24:35,662 --> 02:24:38,485
You discovered the formula but I made it look like she
discovered the formula

1008
02:24:40,441 --> 02:24:49,325
Played Smartly. From what I have, you havent even taken
0.00001 percent

1009
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:56,319
I don't think you understand your situation at the moment
Siddharth.

1010
02:25:07,322 --> 02:25:11,333
Destroying a person in 8 ways and I destroyed you

1011
02:25:14,034 --> 02:25:20,475
Keerthi, morality, money, power everything I have 
destroyed. Attack of the eight factions

1012
02:25:26,476 --> 02:25:35,846
All the reputation you earnt has gone with the trick
I played in the Akshara clip that is number one. Have a 
look

1013
02:25:35,847 --> 02:25:43,092
He doesn't see women as equals. That idiot. He should die.
- If I see him I will hit him with my broom

1014
02:25:44,093 --> 02:25:49,850
I changed the patent rights and in the future you won't
be recognized as a scientist. That is number 2

1015
02:25:49,851 --> 02:25:54,631
He is not a scientist. He is a bastard!
- He should have his certifications taken away

1016
02:25:56,663 --> 02:26:03,031
Everyone that was under your control from the MLA's to CM
is no longer in your support. This is number 3. Power

1017
02:26:03,032 --> 02:26:11,675
Because he was sitting next to me at a function I
casually talked to him. But do not connect me with him 
I do not want to associate with him.

1018
02:26:11,682 --> 02:26:13,608
This kind of guys should have as many cases against him
as possible and put him in jail

1019
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:21,500
Number 4, emotion. You wrongly made Preethi fall in love
with you. I told her the truth and made her distant from
you

1020
02:26:22,077 --> 02:26:32,512
Number 5. Your arrogance. No matter how many crimes you 
commit you were not scared. But with my first attack I made
you scared.

1021
02:26:32,976 --> 02:26:40,378
You were scared. That is why you put a bug in me. You
were scared of what I would do so you started following me.
Oh yea, what did you say before?

1022
02:26:40,404 --> 02:26:45,225
Two hundred crore? If you ask for ten rupees I need to
sign approval

1023
02:26:45,226 --> 02:26:50,497
All your national and international accounts are frozen.
This is 6. Money.

1024
02:26:50,498 --> 02:26:57,886
If I suffocate you a little your smartness will be gone
and you don't even know what you are doing and made a 
very big mistake.

1025
02:26:58,387 --> 02:27:01,504
That is number 7. Morality

1026
02:27:21,166 --> 02:27:24,821
"Sir as you wished my driver killed your dad on his way
back from the hospital"

1027
02:27:28,733 --> 02:27:32,246
"Is he dead? Have you checked?"
- "confirmed. In front of my eyes he died"

1028
02:27:41,544 --> 02:27:50,652
In the 21 gun salute ceremony, you were wishing the
ashes. Do you know whos they were? It was my friend 
IPS Gautham

1029
02:27:50,653 --> 02:27:53,795
Everybody there knew this was the case except you

1030
02:27:55,796 --> 02:27:57,957
Monsters like you with past, present and future

1031
02:27:58,058 --> 02:28:00,589
I have made sure you have none of it and cleansed the world
of you

1032
02:28:00,590 --> 02:28:03,533
and now you're not even worth a hundred rupees

1033
02:28:06,534 --> 02:28:14,809
Now you are not even 0.00001 percent. You are zero

1034
02:28:18,651 --> 02:28:21,434
What is number eight? Is it death?

1035
02:28:23,435 --> 02:28:25,795
How did you design that?

1036
02:28:27,238 --> 02:28:38,144
Who am I to decide that? God will decide it. Of course,
there are many people outside waiting to kill you because
they fear what you will tell about them in court

1037
02:28:38,145 --> 02:28:40,623
There is no guarentee you will get to the court safely

1038
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:46,164
But I can get you two life imprisonments instead of death

1039
02:28:47,304 --> 02:28:53,348
So you have no option. Except me

1040
02:28:55,484 --> 02:28:59,120
So what? Should we talk about that deal now?

1041
02:29:04,361 --> 02:29:10,354
I was thinking of killing him too. But I'm telling you now
listen to me. He has to live.

1042
02:29:10,355 --> 02:29:13,297
What? He has to live?
- He killed Gautham

1043
02:29:13,659 --> 02:29:20,538
We chose Siddharth so that if we stop him we can stop 
hundreds of other criminals but if he stays alive and 
talks

1044
02:29:20,539 --> 02:29:23,719
thousands of criminals are destroyed

1045
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:28,552
He is involved with national and international criminals.
We want them

1046
02:29:29,858 --> 02:29:32,683
For that kind of goal Gautham gave his life away.

1047
02:29:34,547 --> 02:29:39,777
If we go to kill the guy who killed Gautham then his death
would be meaningless

1048
02:29:39,778 --> 02:29:44,351
Without thinking whether I am right or wrong please listen
to me. Trust me please

1049
02:29:51,483 --> 02:29:53,717
This is a bulletproof jacket to save your life

1050
02:29:53,718 --> 02:29:57,689
It's really simple Siddharth. Your life and freedom I can
give it back

1051
02:29:57,690 --> 02:30:02,507
the police department are scared of the biggest criminals
but they are scared of you

1052
02:30:02,808 --> 02:30:07,579
Because all of their secrets and information are in
your hands

1053
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:14,551
and I need it. Wear this bullet proof vest. Once you go
outside my departments best shooter will shoot you

1054
02:30:14,552 --> 02:30:15,360
but nothing will happen to you

1055
02:30:16,061 --> 02:30:19,701
All the people that want to kill you will think you're
dead

1056
02:30:21,076 --> 02:30:25,414
With the governments support I can place you under witness
protection program and keep you safe.

1057
02:30:26,415 --> 02:30:35,493
By helping the country and revealing the masks of all those
criminals I am giving you this offer. Decision is yours

1058
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:43,755
Give me 5 minutes
- sure

1059
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:57,552
Kanna... How are you?

1060
02:30:59,073 --> 02:31:03,657
You made me come with police to save myself from you

1061
02:31:03,658 --> 02:31:08,550
what will you achieve by killing everyone and being the only
one left?

1062
02:31:08,551 --> 02:31:11,858
It is only true happiness when you live life together
with everyone

1063
02:31:12,501 --> 02:31:16,203
If you don't know this then how are you smart?

1064
02:31:16,204 --> 02:31:22,435
All this time I listened to what you said. This one time
listen to me kanna

1065
02:31:23,287 --> 02:31:29,596
As he said wear the vest. Wear the coat kanna

1066
02:31:35,462 --> 02:31:42,255
Today CM's, businessmans and crime gangs are worried what
will be said in court

1067
02:32:01,256 --> 02:32:02,921
Good choice

1068
02:32:03,103 --> 02:32:06,313
Ranveer
- Yes Dhruva
Everything as per plan? Take positions

1069
02:32:16,073 --> 02:32:22,739
Will this cavilar vest take a sniper bullet?
- Do not worry Siddharth this is a type three ceramic 
layered vest

1070
02:32:22,740 --> 02:32:23,606
- specially for snipers

1071
02:32:23,607 --> 02:32:25,735
Let's see

1072
02:33:10,433 --> 02:33:12,305
Where he is standing is your mark

1073
02:33:13,539 --> 02:33:17,230
Once you get to the spot my sniper will shoot you
- Ranveer

1074
02:33:18,532 --> 02:33:19,899
I'm at the vantage point

1075
02:34:08,233 --> 02:34:10,465
Why did you not wear the bullet proof jacket?

1076
02:34:10,466 --> 02:34:12,795
the vest won't stop my death anyway

1077
02:34:12,796 --> 02:34:16,584
Now it's not me that needs the jacket, you need it

1078
02:34:48,199 --> 02:34:51,633
Siddharth get up!
Somebody call the ambulance

1079
02:34:52,570 --> 02:34:58,450
My love wanted to kill me. My enemy is trying to keep me
alive

1080
02:34:59,451 --> 02:35:03,715
You played your downfall on me well.
Number 8 is death

1081
02:35:03,716 --> 02:35:07,878
Which is to happen no matter what
- Siddharth stay with me. Somebody call the ambulance

1082
02:35:09,549 --> 02:35:14,530
Why are you worried? Because I am going to die? or because
I didn't give you the evidence you asked for?

1083
02:35:16,389 --> 02:35:20,405
I gave what you asked for. I gave it.
Tell me how I gave it

1084
02:35:20,406 --> 02:35:25,327
This is not the right time to talk
- This is the only time I have. Think

1085
02:35:26,437 --> 02:35:27,591
Think about it

1086
02:35:33,003 --> 02:35:36,721
"it's not me that needs the jacket, you need it"

1087
02:35:39,155 --> 02:35:40,174
Bullet proof vest

1088
02:35:43,002 --> 02:35:55,315
You are the correct enemy for me. I gave you what you wanted.
Not for the people or the nation but for you... for you

1089
02:36:23,233 --> 02:36:36,138
arrests throughout India have begun starting in Andhra.
Businessmen and politicians all have been caught. This is 
due to the documents Siddharth Abhimanyu provided

1090
02:36:39,342 --> 02:36:44,438
An emotion bigger than this excitement is still memorable
from the news I read

1091
02:36:45,710 --> 02:36:48,218
A 16 year old kid was being taken with handcuffs

1092
02:36:48,219 --> 02:36:51,472
That day I wondered why and how?

1093
02:36:51,473 --> 02:36:57,447
Since he began doing crimes I started analysing the news

1094
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:03,155
Seeing everything that was happening around me should I
keep my mouth shut?

1095
02:37:03,320 --> 02:37:12,367
or should I take my finger out of my mouth to try and
solve the problem myself? That question I asked myself then
is the answer for my life today
