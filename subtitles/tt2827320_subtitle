There you are, you.

00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:32,973
You haven't finished working.
Where were you?

4
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,585
At Pirya, for the
tomorrow homework.

5
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:37,926
Fiches duty.
Who will help me dig?

6
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:40,475
I have already missed 3 days of school.

7
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,159
An extra day,
it won't hurt you.

8
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:45,897
Now, file.

9
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,168
Mom, I won't go
to work tomorrow.

10
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,048
I'm already late in class.

11
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,948
Your father needs you, tomorrow.

12
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,191
And you can buy yourself clothes.

13
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:03,913
Frankly? You already said that
the last time.

14
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,739
- Are you kidding!
- See that with your father.

15
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,109
And stop bothering me.

16
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:34,153
Shalu.

17
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:16,983
Piraji, your friend is here.

18
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,209
Come in. He doesn't feel well,
he has been sleeping for 2 days.

19
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,449
You neither, didn't go to school.

20
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,230
I was counting on you
for the homework.

21
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:31,864
Ask Kulkarni, after
that you will tell me.

22
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,676
Today...

23
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,255
I went to the woods.

24
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,959
I saw the Black Sparrow.

25
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,036
This bird of misfortune
not stay in one place.

26
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,661
It flies in all directions.

27
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,120
I chased it for hours.

28
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:50,099
But without success.

29
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,048
We will surely find one
near the haunted tombs.

30
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,160
We will go when I get better.

31
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,464
Here.

32
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:00,986
Get up and have some tea.

33
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,156
Is Vedant here?

34
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:12,264
Vedant! The son of untouchable is here.

35
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:17,551
Hey Vedant, pass me the remote control.

36
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,264
Hi, Jabya.

37
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,068
What is homework for tomorrow?

38
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:24,734
Two lessons from English.

39
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,334
The poem from Saint Chokhamela.

40
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,701
And we have to finish the assignment.
You finished it, you?

41
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:31,578
That's all.

42
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:53,275
- Who is here?
- Do not worry, it's me.

43
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,364
It's late!
What's this fuss?

44
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,440
I need gas.

To do what? Go back to bed.

46
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,782
Hurry up, Jabya.
You don't have time.

47
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,490
Wait a second.

48
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:41,600
Hurry up!

49
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,535
The poor boy is waiting for you.

50
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,766
- What can I do?
- The poor child.

51
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,713
Thank God,
you don't have a clear skin.

52
00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:57,711
- Are they my hair?
- Yes.

53
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,932
You're more manic
than a movie star.

54
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:09,495
Pirya, you think this belongs
to the Black Sparrow?

55
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:12,022
No.

56
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,580
Too big.
It's more like a pigeon feather.

57
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,276
No, I think this is coming
from the Black Sparrow.

58
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:22,240
I am not sure
that this feather suffices.

59
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,122
No idea.

60
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,324
No.

61
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:27,664
It's a pigeon feather,
It's certain.

62
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:31,904
Jabya, another bird,
do you think that will be okay?

63
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,417
No, it doesn't work like
that with the Black Sparrow.

64
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,812
It's difficult.

I didn't laugh, Sir.

Saint Chokhamela.

104
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,817
A verse from Saint Chokhamela.

105
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,397
Things aren't same when they seem.

106
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:43,177
We will study this poem, today.

107
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,825
Appearances, caste or religion

108
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:51,118
don't reflect a personality.
Their qualities will reflect it.

109
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:55,971
The saint explains it well
in his poem

110
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,977
using various examples.

111
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:01,919
He uses a series of
prose sentences.

112
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:04,315
We will study them.

113
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,736
It's a beautiful poem.

114
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:09,037
We'll begin from the beginning.

115
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:11,449
The juice of sugar cane
doesn't look like the plant.

116
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,980
But we judge things based
on their appearance.

117
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,858
The arc is curved,

118
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,286
but not the arrow.

119
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:21,479
But we judge things based
on their appearance.

120
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,896
Let's learn now
the saint's poem.

121
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,827
Mane, your mother is here.

122
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,928
The river meanders
but not its waters.

123
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:35,126
But we judge things based
on their appearance.

124
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,869
Chokha, himself,
is an untouchable.

125
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,179
Look here.
What are you laughing about?

126
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,850
Chokha is untouchable,
but not his feelings.

127
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,592
But we judge things based
on their appearance.

128
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:49,721
Different examples
and perspectives

129
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,609
are used by the saint to explain

130
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:56,767
the importance of values
and virtues.

131
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:58,719
A sugar cane is curved,

132
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,347
but it's juice too?

133
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:02,210
In the same way,

134
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:03,690
the bow is curved,

135
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:06,337
but doesn't he shoot
straight arrows?

136
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,620
Why did you come to school?

137
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:11,372
To learn.

138
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:13,680
I want to be educated
and have a job.

139
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,426
Mother!

140
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,565
- Why is he screaming?
- It's nothing.

141
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:21,965
I was collecting wood
around the school.

142
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:24,152
I went to see him in the class.

143
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:28,164
If you come back,
I won't go to school.

144
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:32,366
No, your majesty.
Promised, I won't come anymore.

145
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:38,006
You didn't go to Mumbai
to see the cricket matches?

146
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:39,955
I'm going there next week.

147
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,562
It seems that women in there,
they do massages.

148
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:44,435
It's wrong.

149
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:46,871
If you want to soothe your body,
go to Mumbai.

150
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:49,023
For my head,
it's you I come to see.

151
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:50,993
- You are too funny.
- The farm.

152
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,355
Hey Kachrya?

153
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,593
Pigs become troublesome.

154
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:57,277
My knee hurts me.

155
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:00,535
- I can't run.
- It's boring.

156
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:03,093
- They annoy us seriously.
- That is true.

157
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:05,398
Ghorpade was bitten
at the buttock.

158
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:09,537
Try to get rid of it.

159
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,865
- When was he bitten?
- When he relieved himself.

160
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,410
- Catch her.
- Catch her.

161
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:22,251
Which notebook am I going to ask??

162
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:23,978
Anything.

163
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:26,105
How important is it?

164
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,620
Will she give it to me?

165
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:35,288
- Hey, wait.
- Come on.

166
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:36,818
- Wait.
- Back.

167
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:38,238
- Hold on.
- What...

168
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,559
- It's mine.
- Wait.

169
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,975
- Get up!
- Do not touch her.

170
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,148
The pig touched her.

171
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:50,309
You got hurt?
Get up.

172
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:52,652
Sir, may I come in?

173
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:53,995
- Enter.
- Come.

174
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:55,095
Come in, Rani.

175
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:01,228
Sir, can I take her back?
What happened?

176
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,421
A pig touched her.

177
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,230
Why are you playing with pigs?

178
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:08,395
It's the pig that attacked her.

179
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:10,930
Wash your feet to the head.

180
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:14,054
I'm going to water your clothes with
cow urine to purify them.

181
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,191
Water me too.

182
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,872
What are you doing up there?

183
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:44,327
- Why are you destroying the nest?
- That's not we are doing.

184
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:47,577
I am checking that is it one
of the Black Sparrow.

185
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:50,191
What can it do! Come down.

186
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,388
This bird is as a Brahmin.

187
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:54,975
If you touch it,
others will ban it.

188
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:57,603
They will kill you.
Come down.

189
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:03,196
What are you looking at?
Do you want a lesson?

190
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,677
Come down.

191
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:09,071
- Jabya, what are you doing?
- Going down.

192
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:14,126
Jabya, how do I do to get down?

193
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,348
Just do the opposite way.

194
00:20:16,977 --> 00:20:20,213
- I am dizzy.
- Jumped up.

195
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:22,814
You think?

196
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:26,740
- Wait for me, Jabya.
- Come down or stay up there.

197
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,340
Sir.

198
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,621
- Hold.
- Yes.

199
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:47,040
Yes, Kachru?
What's this meeting for?

200
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,001
For the village festival.

201
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:52,724
It's coming.

202
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:55,002
Mom.

203
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:56,553
We had the pay?

204
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:00,608
Mom.

205
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:02,888
Yes, we got it.

206
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,206
A claimant
will come to see Surkhi.

207
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:07,875
We'll buy you some pants
at the village festival.

208
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,752
You already said that
before Diwali.

209
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,506
- We'll buy you some pants.
- He adds some.

210
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:35,086
Grandpa, what do you know
about the Black Sparrow?

211
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,989
The Black Sparrow?

212
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:39,972
The bird that doesn't
hold in one place.

213
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:42,261
It flies everywhere.

214
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,597
It's tail looks like a kite.

215
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:46,728
I probably saw it.

216
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:49,313
What's special about it?

217
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:51,173
Nothing.

218
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:54,040
What do you know about it?

219
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:57,861
Son, I don't understand
what are you talking about?

220
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,722
Just tell me directly.

221
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:03,331
What will happen
when we burn it?

222
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,567
What do you mean?

223
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:09,217
It becomes ashes. What else?

224
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:17,037
Give me that.

225
00:22:19,385 --> 00:22:22,108
Mom, she took my sunglasses.

226
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:30,376
Don't make fuss.
Give it to me.

227
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:35,254
Did you read the book?

228
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:37,902
Yes. Here it is.

229
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,029
Unbelievable!
<i>The Art of Hypnosis.</i>

230
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:43,455
You read it?

231
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:45,685
- Hey.
- Jabya!

232
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,933
Is it you, Jabya?

233
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:49,227
Come here.

234
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,744
- Come here.
- Go see what he wants.

235
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:07,448
The piglet is stuck.
Get it out of here.

236
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:11,929
I'm asking you to get it out.

237
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,015
I won't do it.

238
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:17,446
Listen to me, boy!

239
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,440
What does he think about him?

240
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:21,338
Any problem, Jabya?

241
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,244
What's going on?

242
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,665
Go quickly!

243
00:23:31,851 --> 00:23:33,771
Get out!

244
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:01,096
What is it?
Get out.

245
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:03,988
Or I dig your grave.

246
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:06,880
Hey, Kachrya!
Hey, Kachrya!!

247
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:09,213
Don't you hear me?

248
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:12,318
Are you deaf or what?

249
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,042
Mr. Patil asks you to come to his place.

250
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:21,991
Idiot! Who throws stones
over my chickens?

251
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:29,213
Take that away from here.

252
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:31,207
I will take it to my home.

253
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:34,383
Your son has a big head.

254
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,242
He was insolent.
He is not like you.

255
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:40,610
It is dishonorable.

256
00:24:42,392 --> 00:24:44,049
He's just a kid.

257
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:46,984
If he was married,
he could be a father.

258
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:52,052
Kachrya empties the sewage

259
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,490
- and clean the tank.
- Yes.

260
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,573
Here you are again?
Did you hang around enough?

261
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,525
Why did you disobey to Mr. Patil?

262
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:09,288
Don't be rude with people.

263
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,615
I don't want to be banned.

264
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:14,539
Don't strut like a rich kid.

265
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:22,479
The guests are here.

266
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:38,166
Welcome!

267
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:41,685
Welcome!!

268
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:48,487
Take some water.

269
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,428
What do you say?

270
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:03,492
Speak Marathi,
we want to understand.

271
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:07,318
I said we have
some difficulties,

272
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:09,284
but thanks to Heaven,
we are getting there.

273
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,735
I have two daughters and a son.

274
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:14,429
Are you going to school?

275
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:16,175
Yes, I'm in fifth.

276
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,885
The children are ashamed
to speak their language.

277
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:21,332
I have to talk to them Marathi,
even at home.

278
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:25,539
We are the only ones
untouchable in this village.

279
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:27,354
There are pigs here...

280
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,335
- Hold it.
- We do not raise them.

281
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,447
Everything is ready?
Cover your head.

282
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:35,328
- Is she ready?
- In a minute.

283
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:43,152
Go ahead.

284
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:53,590
What's your name?

285
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,769
- Surekha.
- Your full name.

286
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:59,170
Surekha Kachru Mane.

287
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,730
- Where do you come from?
- From here.

288
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:03,358
That's it to say?

289
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:05,718
Tell them the name
from our village.

290
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:07,843
Akolner.

291
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,665
You do not know it?
Tell them it's Akolner.

292
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:15,199
Of course she knows it.
She is a little nervous.

293
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,973
Don't be nervous.
Speak boldly!

294
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:19,708
Akolner.

295
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:22,389
You have questions?

296
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,813
Looks good, Vilas.

297
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,451
You won't complain later.

298
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:30,418
Go back inside.

299
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:42,039
A tea?

300
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:48,771
- Hold.
- Please.

301
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,650
Sit.

302
00:28:17,272 --> 00:28:20,349
A dowry of Rs. 50,000 then a
ring worth of 10 grams of gold.

303
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:21,660
You will finance the wedding.

304
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:24,345
- Does that suit you?
- Yes.

305
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:31,530
I ain't so easy to afford, Sir.

306
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:38,676
What do you propose?

307
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,023
You can express yourself.

308
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:47,037
I don't know what to say.

309
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:51,012
We are listening to you.
We will tell you if we accept.

310
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,757
It doesn't cost anything to talk.

311
00:28:58,646 --> 00:28:59,896
I am poor.

312
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:05,984
The life of my elder daughter
is already ruined.

313
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:10,552
We aspired to give better
for my younger daughter.

314
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:12,276
A dowry of 20,000

315
00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:15,023
and I will do as much
as for the wedding.

316
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:16,541
Is it acceptable?

317
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:44,310
We accept.
Let's start the rituals.

318
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:49,066
Listen to all.

319
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:50,334
We crush the areca nuts?

320
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,961
- Go for it.
- Yes.

321
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:00,464
<i>The piglet is trapped.
Let it go.</i>

322
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:02,838
<i>- Don't touch her!
- Jabya.</i>

323
00:30:03,517 --> 00:30:04,639
<i>A pig touched her.</i>

324
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:09,204
<i>Jabya.</i>

325
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:10,394
<i>Don't touch her.</i>

326
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:13,746
<i>Free it and let it go.</i>

327
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:18,067
- <i>A pig touched her.</i>
- <i>Jabya.</i>

328
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,269
Damn bird!

329
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:11,133
This bird has thrown us a type.

330
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,924
That's why we didn't
catch the Black Sparrow.

331
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:15,973
What can there be?

332
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:17,914
It's a bad omen for us.

333
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,215
<i>♪ Your lock of hair
Fall before your eyes ♪</i>

334
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,902
<i>♪ Your perfect face
Your luscious lips ♪</i>

335
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:33,402
<i>♪ It's not an exaggeration to say
that you are the most beautiful ♪</i>

336
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:37,171
<i>♪ As the wind blows
in your fluid dress ♪</i>

337
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,963
<i>♪ As the wind blows
in your fluid dress ♪</i>

338
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,701
<i>♪ My friend Jabya is crazy of Shalu ♪</i>

339
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:44,994
<i>♪ My friend Jabya is crazy of Shalu ♪</i>

340
00:31:45,476 --> 00:31:46,436
The farm, moron.

341
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:48,598
<i>♪ My friend Jabya is crazy of Shalu ♪</i>

342
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,847
<i>♪ My friend Jabya is crazy of Shalu ♪</i>

343
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:05,189
You shouldn't offered them Rs. 20,000.

344
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,958
The suitor was fond of Surkhi.

345
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:10,852
They would have accepted
without dot.

346
00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:13,778
What if they refused?

347
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:16,270
Pick up.

348
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:21,086
Pick up!
Pick up!!

349
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:35,421
Mr. Sheikh, you didn't participate
in the last time.

350
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:39,881
Don't worry.
You will have it this time.

351
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:41,766
Listen to all.

352
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:43,606
My friends!

353
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:46,599
Let's increase a little participation.

354
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,685
Let's go to Rs. 100 instead of Rs. 50.

355
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:51,029
These Rs. 100 are mandatory.

356
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:53,174
- Of course.
- It must.

357
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,536
Everyone pays,
without exception.

358
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:59,215
The toilet working people
have fallen behind.

359
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:02,730
We will be able to use
their participation.

360
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:04,090
The tea is ready?

361
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,261
- Yes.
- Quick.

362
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:07,233
Kachru, serve tea.

363
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,347
Give him.

364
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:16,733
Jabya, help your father
for a few days.

365
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:19,366
Impossible, I will
have my exams soon.

366
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:22,415
You can buy yourself trousers.

367
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,374
He wants jeans.

368
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:27,544
He will be able to buy
what he wants.

369
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:29,162
It is very expensive.

370
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:30,707
Who is there?

371
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:32,148
You are stealing my wood?

372
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:33,589
- That rascal is back.
- Hey!

373
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,460
Stop stealing.

374
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,325
This isn't your father's home.

375
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:40,146
It bores us that one.
Quick, gather the wood.

376
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:42,029
- Hey, you don't...
- Let's go.

377
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,377
I warned you.

378
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,236
You don't understand?

379
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,481
Run!

380
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:50,807
They took my wood
as it was like their fathers.

381
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,107
- Run!
- Are you idiots?

382
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,578
- Run!
- Surkhi!

383
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:56,784
Chenapans! Rogue!

384
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,106
Don't come back.

385
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:00,366
Damn you!

386
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:17,703
Pirya, take the letter.

387
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:24,028
Give it to me.

388
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:33,782
You have a beautiful writing, Jabya.

389
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:35,448
You don't know.

390
00:34:35,732 --> 00:34:37,739
Maybe Shalu will like it.

391
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,200
You think Shalu will love me?

392
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,620
Who knows?

393
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,835
She comes from a higher caste
and she is rich.

394
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,779
We must catch the Black Sparrow.

395
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,025
Why can't we do it?

396
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:54,834
It's a wonderful bird.

397
00:34:56,324 --> 00:34:58,631
Come on, let's go home.
I have ice cream for sale.

398
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:11,455
Can I come with you?

399
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:12,879
Of course.

400
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,004
Where are we going to sell them?

401
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,344
In the village, of course.

402
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,446
Not in ours.
Can we sell them elsewhere?

403
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:20,524
Of course.

404
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:23,017
Go! Quick! The Sparrow.

405
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:34,814
Ice cream! Who wants ice cream?

406
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:37,401
Ice cream! Buy my ice cream!

407
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,434
Buy my ice cream!!

408
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,813
Hey, stop yourself.

409
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:46,634
Ice cream!

410
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,058
Buy my ice cream!!

411
00:37:51,948 --> 00:37:53,198
Jabya.

412
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,505
You have two free days.
You will go with your father.

413
00:37:56,836 --> 00:37:58,170
I don't want.

414
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,572
I will give you two days salary.

415
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,712
Will you pay me?

416
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:04,586
How?

417
00:38:05,768 --> 00:38:07,402
He sells ice cream.

418
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:10,767
How much did you earn yourself?

419
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:13,002
It doesn't concern you.

420
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:15,704
You will have two days pay.
How is it?

421
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,231
I will buy jeans with the rest.

422
00:38:21,226 --> 00:38:22,949
Jeans, my foot!

423
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,406
Can I have an advance?

424
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:38,618
Impossible, I don't even
have a work to offer you.

425
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:35,700
Cane sugar sells
at a good price.

426
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:38,580
- How much did you sell?
- About 5 tons.

427
00:39:38,904 --> 00:39:40,659
It must be a celebration.

428
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:43,253
You surprise me.

429
00:39:43,686 --> 00:39:44,650
Kachru.

430
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:47,310
Sir, can you lend me Rs. 5,000?

431
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:50,860
Your timing is perfect.

432
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,718
Give me a hundred rupees.

433
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:01,835
- There is at least 1000 rupees.
- Thank you sir!

434
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,120
- And then this examination?
- The one of geometry?

435
00:40:12,695 --> 00:40:14,147
She's looking at you.

436
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:16,514
I'm sure, she's looking at you.

437
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:20,188
Come.

438
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:22,583
We will go ourselves on the other side.

439
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:24,469
What makes you nervous?

440
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,501
You are talking about me?

441
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:33,197
Even a blind man
would realize it.

442
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:36,794
She really looks at me?

443
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:40,286
We will get behind.

444
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,082
Let's see if she turns around.

445
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,075
It was nice, no?

446
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,394
- Only one?
- Of course.

447
00:40:58,016 --> 00:40:58,990
What did he say?

448
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:04,983
Get up, tanned.

449
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:06,992
I already told you
not to come here.

450
00:41:07,302 --> 00:41:09,861
- Don't call me like that.
- And what will you do?

451
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,193
You don't deserve to be here.

452
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:13,951
How dare you to watch Shalu!

453
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:16,941
If you do it again, you're screwed!
Disappear!

454
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:19,921
Disgusting pig.

455
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,037
Hold on.

456
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,346
<i>♪ As the wind blows
in your fluid dress ♪</i>

457
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:35,988
<i>♪ As the wind blows
in your fluid dress ♪</i>

458
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:40,109
<i>♪ Your hips are swaying
at the beat of the drum ♪</i>

459
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:45,905
<i>♪ As the wind blows
in your fluid dress ♪</i>

460
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,339
<i>♪ Your hips... ♪</i>

461
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:48,951
Shut up!

462
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:51,751
That's why, that sparrow flees.

463
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,640
Look Jabya, the sparrow.
Grab it.

464
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:58,569
It was your father who
taught you to shout?

465
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:01,621
Missed to a hair.
You almost got it.

466
00:42:01,764 --> 00:42:03,323
Missed to a hair!
Shut your mouth!

467
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,016
Chankya is a funny man.

468
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,498
No wonder the villagers fear him.

469
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,093
It's better to wear a T-shirt
or a shirt with jeans?

470
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,316
- Get up.
- Why?

471
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,664
Do it.

472
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:01,511
A T-shirt would be better with jeans.

473
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:04,935
Yes, I believe too.

474
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:08,234
Why don't we arrive early
to catch that bird?

475
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:09,541
It's been days.

476
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,686
It's really not easy.

477
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:14,836
If only we had a weapon.

478
00:43:15,452 --> 00:43:16,476
If only.

479
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:19,338
Slim.

480
00:43:19,706 --> 00:43:21,629
It must be past noon.

481
00:43:28,178 --> 00:43:30,080
Pirya, you like Rani, not true?

482
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,158
- Not at all.
- On your mother's head?

483
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:33,521
I swear, I don't like her.

484
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,787
Who is roaming around her?

485
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:37,883
It has nothing to do.

486
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:42,043
What is wrong with you
all day, then?

487
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:44,851
- You know?
- What?

488
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:46,989
Sangram and Shalu found themselves

489
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:48,584
in secret on the terrace.

490
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:52,573
You, don't worry.

491
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:54,237
It was Vedant who said it.

492
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:57,212
Sangram may have asked
to Vedant to spread the rumor.

493
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,264
He looks stupid
but he is clever.

494
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:09,204
Who is it?

495
00:44:09,473 --> 00:44:11,222
Hanya's grandma had hiccups.

496
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:12,528
This isn't serious.

497
00:44:12,746 --> 00:44:15,596
So much so that it took
bing him to the hospital.

498
00:44:16,464 --> 00:44:18,097
She's a niggard.

499
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:19,444
Here's another one.

500
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:22,600
He is drunk.
Leave it alone.

501
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:24,534
- Not today.
- He's too drunk.

502
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:27,026
Let him go.

503
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,988
Hey Kachrya!
Did you get drunk at the picket?

504
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:33,912
Who is in interest
of what am I worth?

505
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,728
Go home, Kachrya.

506
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:43,246
Go back.
Go to bed.

507
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:48,150
- At the picket!
- There you go.

508
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:50,903
At the picket! At the picket!
At the picket!!

509
00:44:51,495 --> 00:44:54,595
- At the picket!!
- Oh dear.

510
00:44:54,797 --> 00:44:56,386
- Bravo, Kachrya!
- Go!

511
00:44:56,555 --> 00:44:58,830
What a failure!
He got drunk at the piquette.

512
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:20,987
Shall I serve you dinner?

513
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,419
Needless.

514
00:45:28,707 --> 00:45:29,700
What is it?

515
00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:36,075
I saw your brother.

516
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:39,898
He can't lend me the money.

517
00:45:41,636 --> 00:45:43,078
He promised to help.

518
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:55,541
Money for the dowry.

519
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:57,732
How we are going to do this?

520
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:41,243
Pirya, wait.

521
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,524
Look for the Black Sparrow.

522
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:08,539
It's too expensive.

523
00:47:15,268 --> 00:47:16,870
Excuse me.

524
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:19,850
- Do you sell sparrows?
- Yes, see you later.

525
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:24,623
- Do you have a black one?
- A Black Sparrow?

526
00:47:24,752 --> 00:47:27,411
With a tail like a shape of kite.

527
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:30,455
Mine aren't like that.

528
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,118
Jabya.

529
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,035
Look at these fish.

530
00:47:42,406 --> 00:47:45,898
He doesn't have a Black Sparrow.
No chance.

531
00:47:48,236 --> 00:47:50,062
I must.

532
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:52,402
It's clear.

533
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:56,737
This isn't your bike?

534
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,545
Hey, driver, look behind you.

535
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:17,840
We should better go from here.

536
00:48:19,502 --> 00:48:20,659
Forget that.

537
00:48:33,154 --> 00:48:34,948
Don't cry.
Take him with you.

538
00:49:49,617 --> 00:49:52,648
- Hail, Ram! Ram!!
- Hail, Ram! Ram!!

539
00:49:56,008 --> 00:49:57,578
Do you have any work for me?

540
00:49:58,632 --> 00:49:59,690
Not at this moment.

541
00:50:02,016 --> 00:50:03,330
Call me, if you needed.

542
00:50:04,027 --> 00:50:05,052
No problem.

543
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,763
Okay?

544
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:12,903
Tell me...

545
00:50:13,955 --> 00:50:16,774
- Can I have that manure?
- Yes.

546
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:32,280
You owe me another Rs. 100.

547
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,328
Can I pay later?

548
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:36,794
Okay.

549
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,015
Jabya.

550
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,677
Did you get the Black Sparrow?

551
00:50:56,606 --> 00:50:59,906
How much can I have for the bike?

552
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,238
About Rs. 200.

553
00:51:04,597 --> 00:51:05,741
What is it?

554
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:07,720
Why are you crying?

555
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:10,379
Good.
Shalu sent you to graze?

556
00:51:12,211 --> 00:51:13,426
Her father discovered it?

557
00:51:14,102 --> 00:51:15,319
Yours?

558
00:51:15,941 --> 00:51:17,383
So why are you crying?

559
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:20,679
A truck crashed my
bike and ice cream.

560
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:22,055
What?

561
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,091
It is not serious.

562
00:51:26,632 --> 00:51:27,850
Don't repay me.

563
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,493
Why are you crying?
Get up.

564
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:31,947
Don't repay me.

565
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,320
Idiot!

566
00:51:33,545 --> 00:51:34,826
Take a seat.
We are going to play.

567
00:51:39,394 --> 00:51:40,820
Did you find the Black Sparrow?

568
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:44,085
No, but I found a feather.

569
00:51:44,494 --> 00:51:46,032
It doesn't work.

570
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:47,954
We need the Sparrow.

571
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:50,899
That is true?

572
00:51:51,331 --> 00:51:52,677
Don't you believe it?

573
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:56,354
- Yes.
- It works if you believe it.

574
00:52:09,003 --> 00:52:10,829
- How many?
- Rs. 10.

575
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:18,396
What are you doing here?
Your mother doesn't feel well.

576
00:52:19,419 --> 00:52:21,598
Go to the market, replace it.
Come on stand up!

577
00:52:27,288 --> 00:52:28,345
Go.. Go.. Go...

578
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:38,509
- What's up?
- Nothing special.

579
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:42,912
Why are you hanging out
with this good-for-nothing Chankya?

580
00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:46,441
He is a scum.

581
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:48,832
He has scammed the cleverest.

582
00:52:49,605 --> 00:52:52,392
If I see you again with him,
I'll break your legs.

583
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,363
Go to the market.
Send your mother home.

584
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,169
Fifty paisa for the candies.
Do not get scammed.

585
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:04,920
Buy my sweets. They are good.

586
00:53:05,245 --> 00:53:07,703
They are worth 50 paisa.
Don't buy them for 1 rupee.

587
00:53:08,092 --> 00:53:10,526
Sir, buy my candy.

588
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,480
How much for the basket?

589
00:53:16,772 --> 00:53:18,566
- Hundred rupees.
- Hundred?

590
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:20,251
It is very expensive.

591
00:53:20,962 --> 00:53:22,660
- I'll give you sixty.
- No.

592
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,599
Sixty is good.

593
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:26,802
The equipment already costs
200 rupees.

594
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,113
Seventy?

595
00:53:30,437 --> 00:53:31,527
Make an effort.

596
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:33,115
Seventy, that's okay.

597
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:35,569
Never mind.

598
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,663
Where did he go?

599
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:43,019
Where is this boy?

600
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,814
Surely gone looking for
some water.

601
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:46,189
He was right there.

602
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:53,221
Baskets for sale.

603
00:53:58,467 --> 00:53:59,652
Excuse me, madam.

604
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:02,455
You want this basket?

605
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,382
A beautiful wedding.

606
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:55,753
The village festival starts tomorrow.

607
00:54:56,179 --> 00:54:57,173
I know.

608
00:54:57,946 --> 00:55:00,010
This will be the opportunity to launch
ashes to Shalu.

609
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:02,648
- I don't know.
- Nobody will know anything.

610
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:04,882
I know.

611
00:55:06,234 --> 00:55:09,595
Pirya, my father told me not
to hang out with Chankya.

612
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,571
They take it all for an original.

613
00:55:14,307 --> 00:55:16,035
Do you think Chankya is right?

614
00:55:16,472 --> 00:55:18,488
We can hypnotize someone
with Moineau's ashes?

615
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:21,940
Who knows?

616
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:26,068
Look, you knew that the
Chankya wife was beautiful?

617
00:55:26,363 --> 00:55:29,429
How such a pretty girl
could have fallen in love with him?

618
00:55:29,905 --> 00:55:32,212
She is from of a Pune family.

619
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:36,302
One day her brother abducted her.

620
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:38,929
They reduced Chankya to mush.

621
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:42,779
From that point,
he began to drink.

622
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:45,823
Whatever you say, Pirya.

623
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,855
Chankya is an extraordinary guy.
He would not lie to me.

624
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:51,758
He refused the money
that I owed him.

625
00:55:52,637 --> 00:55:54,579
He told me that I looked like him.

626
00:55:55,528 --> 00:55:57,321
Chankya likes you.

627
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:18,106
Dear Shalu, I do not know
why I love you so much.

628
00:57:18,193 --> 00:57:19,633
I may not be handsome.

629
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:37,275
Don't leave hanging
your Business.

630
00:57:38,618 --> 00:57:39,580
Here.

631
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:19,972
Look, I have new clothes.

632
00:58:21,162 --> 00:58:22,413
Do you like them?

633
00:58:25,778 --> 00:58:28,532
You still have to iron
your pants.

634
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:31,058
Hurry up.

635
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,526
Here you are at last.

636
00:58:34,824 --> 00:58:36,330
You will go back there.

637
00:58:36,575 --> 00:58:39,138
Listen to me.
Buy rope for 50 rupees.

638
00:59:00,843 --> 00:59:02,847
We must go to the temple.

639
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:05,263
Why don't we go later?

640
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:22,096
Praised be the carriage of God!

641
00:59:43,812 --> 00:59:48,678
<i>My Dear Shalu, I don't have the words
to express how much I love you.</i>

642
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,724
<i>I know I'm poor and from
another caste than you.</i>

643
00:59:53,428 --> 00:59:54,838
<i>But honestly,</i>

644
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:59,627
<i>nobody loves you so
much, like I love you.</i>

645
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:01,982
<i>Not even your parents.</i>

646
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:05,931
<i>I'm ready for anything
to win your love.</i>

647
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:07,991
<i>A word from you</i>

648
01:00:08,389 --> 01:00:10,470
<i>and I would be ready
to sacrifice myself.</i>

649
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:14,307
<i>I swear by you.</i>

650
01:00:14,757 --> 01:00:16,977
<i>I think of you night and day.</i>

651
01:00:17,817 --> 01:00:19,560
<i>You can believe me.</i>

652
01:00:20,774 --> 01:00:23,902
<i>Shalu, if you don't love me,</i>

653
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:26,122
<i>rips this letter
and throw it away.</i>

654
01:00:26,796 --> 01:00:27,883
<i>I'll accept it.</i>

655
01:00:28,678 --> 01:00:30,633
<i>But don't talk about it
to your parents.</i>

656
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:34,883
<i>Don't show it to anyone
and don't bother about me.</i>

657
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:39,571
<i>And if you love me too,</i>

658
01:00:40,022 --> 01:00:41,787
<i>answer this letter.</i>

659
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:46,954
<i>Or when you come
at school tomorrow,</i>

660
01:00:47,286 --> 01:00:48,424
<i>make two mats.</i>

661
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:51,495
<i>I will understand
that you love me back.</i>

662
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:54,943
<i>I'm waiting for your answer
with impatience.</i>

663
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:57,297
<i>I'm all yours,</i>

664
01:00:58,246 --> 01:00:59,692
<i>Jambuwant.</i>

665
01:01:16,032 --> 01:01:17,825
Go, file, you.

666
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:19,483
Move, niggas.

667
01:01:19,804 --> 01:01:21,382
- You heard?
- I am going.

668
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:22,932
Get away, niggas!

669
01:01:23,457 --> 01:01:24,417
Shit!

670
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:25,678
Get out!

671
01:01:26,572 --> 01:01:27,693
Two ice creams.

672
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:44,089
We'll buy you a shirt.

673
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:47,269
We'll buy you the pants later.

674
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,608
Don't bother.

675
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:53,946
Come on, Pirya.

676
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:56,400
Come.

677
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,000
Come on, Son.
Let's go.

678
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:02,780
Good.

679
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,266
Give it to me.

680
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:09,376
- Yes, Kachrya?
- A shirt for the boy.

681
01:02:09,504 --> 01:02:11,362
- Show me the cheapest.
- Okay.

682
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:12,893
About 150 rupees.

683
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:19,525
Please.

684
01:02:22,015 --> 01:02:23,135
Which one do you prefer?

685
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,099
- This one?
- It looks better for you?

686
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:27,198
You take another one?

687
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:39,065
Here is a nice shirt.

688
01:02:39,224 --> 01:02:41,242
Looks like you're
leaving on a mission.

689
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:43,849
Where are you going?

690
01:02:43,978 --> 01:02:45,131
We came to see you.

691
01:02:51,962 --> 01:02:54,461
You could lend me
your drum for the procession?

692
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:56,941
Drums of Kem didn't
play well already?

693
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,313
- Yes.
- Yes, you can have it.

694
01:03:00,287 --> 01:03:02,763
But we must play well.
You must insure!

695
01:03:02,976 --> 01:03:04,129
You will see.

696
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:05,650
You'll have it.

697
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,796
Go ahead. I'm joining you.

698
01:03:12,494 --> 01:03:15,378
- Are you really coming?
- I'm coming very soon.

[SALE OF SPIRITS]

700
01:03:20,122 --> 01:03:21,594
We aren't ready to see him again.

701
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:27,976
He looks...

702
01:03:28,403 --> 01:03:29,555
That is true.

703
01:03:35,624 --> 01:03:39,705
Praised be the carriage of God!

704
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:43,999
Praised be the carriage of God!

705
01:04:09,714 --> 01:04:13,848
Jabya, you have to dance
and impress Shalu.

706
01:07:29,107 --> 01:07:30,068
Jabya.

707
01:08:56,367 --> 01:08:57,841
The cart fell.

708
01:08:58,591 --> 01:09:00,103
Fucking pig! He brushed my leg!

709
01:09:01,186 --> 01:09:03,717
Go quickly.
Get up!

710
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:05,606
It's a bad omen.

711
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:08,652
I know. Never mind.
Don't make fuss.

712
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:12,530
Send me, Kachrya.

713
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:14,533
Continue the procession.

714
01:09:26,605 --> 01:09:29,072
You know what happened
at the procession?

715
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:31,907
- No sir.
- A pig has made havoc.

716
01:09:32,623 --> 01:09:34,546
It struck the chariot of God.

717
01:09:35,335 --> 01:09:38,218
Get rid of those filthy pigs tomorrow.

718
01:09:39,503 --> 01:09:41,313
My daughter is getting
married in two days.

719
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:43,513
Two days?
It's not a problem.

720
01:09:43,753 --> 01:09:45,483
We have a wrestling tournament
tomorrow.

721
01:09:45,633 --> 01:09:48,645
Kill the pigs before it causes
another trouble.

722
01:09:50,265 --> 01:09:51,931
Alone, it's impossible.

723
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,975
I beg you, Kachrya.

724
01:09:55,662 --> 01:09:57,618
Take your wife
and your children with you.

725
01:09:59,147 --> 01:10:01,997
Take money from the budget
of the party, if necessary.

726
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:06,754
Here.

727
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:10,932
Kill the pigs before people
go to relieve themselves.

728
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,102
Or they will cause further trouble.

729
01:11:57,524 --> 01:11:58,837
<i>Jabya.</i>

730
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:05,318
Jabya! Jabya!! Wake up!
Wake up!! Wake up!!

731
01:12:25,289 --> 01:12:26,269
Show me.

732
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:28,512
Henna looks darker.

733
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,801
Put oil on it to darken well.

734
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:35,635
Here. Hurry up!

735
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,201
Mom. I beg you, talk to dad.

736
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:16,156
He wants to kill them on Sunday.
Why Sunday?

737
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,969
The school is closed on Sunday.

738
01:13:19,255 --> 01:13:21,700
He is ashamed to hunt pigs
in front of his friends.

739
01:13:21,927 --> 01:13:24,202
You think your father will listen to us?

740
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:23,123
Follow me.

741
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:39,836
Stay up there to watch.

742
01:14:41,888 --> 01:14:43,234
Where do you think?

743
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:51,933
Go!

744
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:05,509
Jabya, it's you
who hold the collar.

745
01:15:21,132 --> 01:15:22,669
Dhurpa, go through this side.

746
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,011
Take the pigs over here.

747
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,598
I found the pig!

748
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:17,563
Jabya's family is hunting pigs.

749
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:19,555
Hey, look there!

750
01:17:27,456 --> 01:17:29,987
Jabya! Grab it!
Use the collar!

751
01:17:33,744 --> 01:17:34,834
It runs away.

752
01:17:41,561 --> 01:17:42,811
It's time for school.

753
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:45,304
Go with them if you
want to do like them.

754
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:47,024
Let's go.

755
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:58,730
Dhurpa!

756
01:18:04,331 --> 01:18:05,548
Where did you go?

757
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,357
Surkhi!

758
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:14,260
Where are you?

759
01:18:16,315 --> 01:18:18,478
- Where is Jabya?
- No idea.

760
01:18:23,376 --> 01:18:25,936
- Where were you?
- I went to pee.

761
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:28,997
You have chosen your moment badly.

762
01:18:31,462 --> 01:18:33,096
Don't look at me like that.
Move!

763
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:37,351
If you disappear again,
I make you to shit in your pants.

764
01:18:39,693 --> 01:18:41,945
With Dhurpa, we will attract
the pigs on the other side.

765
01:18:42,743 --> 01:18:44,653
- Trap them when they arrive.
- Okay.

766
01:18:53,179 --> 01:18:55,486
What's funny?

767
01:18:56,726 --> 01:18:58,488
Nothing. What's your problem?

768
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,582
Is it in there?

769
01:19:14,911 --> 01:19:15,877
Yes.

770
01:19:16,056 --> 01:19:17,081
Be alert.

771
01:19:17,656 --> 01:19:19,103
Throw stones over the pig.

772
01:19:20,029 --> 01:19:22,240
I know what to do.
Shut up, then.

773
01:19:24,214 --> 01:19:27,225
Jabya! The pig comes
towards you.

774
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,745
Jabya, the pig is
trying to come around.

775
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:40,467
The pig is coming!

776
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:43,391
Trap and catch it, Jabya!

Follow it.

Go.

01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:26,950
Take a seat.

897
01:30:28,662 --> 01:30:32,941
Praised be the carriage of God!

898
01:30:38,678 --> 01:30:39,841
Dhurpa, help him.

899
01:30:39,992 --> 01:30:41,083
Dhurpa! Help him.

900
01:30:41,556 --> 01:30:43,703
- Give it to me.
- Come on, Jabya!

901
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:49,885
Jabya, use the collar!

902
01:30:53,191 --> 01:30:54,492
He caught it!

903
01:30:55,141 --> 01:30:56,915
- Go!
- Hold it.

904
01:30:58,582 --> 01:31:01,401
Praised be the carriage of God!

905
01:31:01,543 --> 01:31:02,616
Do not let him go.

906
01:31:02,789 --> 01:31:05,302
Pull it harder!

907
01:31:06,716 --> 01:31:08,189
Drawn!

908
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,208
Jabya's mother fell down.

909
01:31:15,486 --> 01:31:16,544
Go.

910
01:31:23,224 --> 01:31:24,184
Hold it.

911
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:26,936
Hold it.
Hold it.

912
01:31:27,475 --> 01:31:29,636
Surkhi, give me the rope.

913
01:31:31,662 --> 01:31:33,055
It killed us.

914
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,382
Gag it.

915
01:31:35,886 --> 01:31:37,156
It was very hard to catch.

916
01:31:45,075 --> 01:31:48,383
Lets' go.
Lets' go.

917
01:31:55,228 --> 01:31:56,221
We had fun.

918
01:32:01,757 --> 01:32:02,974
Not bad, Kachrya.

919
01:32:03,564 --> 01:32:04,622
Good game!

920
01:32:07,318 --> 01:32:09,014
- Pig!
- Pig!

921
01:33:11,757 --> 01:33:13,646
Come on. Come on.
We'll have a little fun.

922
01:33:16,628 --> 01:33:18,117
Get ready!
Kachru's army arrives.

923
01:33:18,309 --> 01:33:19,879
These guys stink!

924
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:23,490
Hold on, Dhurpa!

925
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:25,671
Or the pig will spin.

926
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:27,436
The farm, scum.

927
01:33:27,725 --> 01:33:29,295
Mind your own business.

928
01:33:30,262 --> 01:33:31,222
Hey, stop!

929
01:33:31,415 --> 01:33:32,825
Idiot! Who do you think you are?

930
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:34,543
That makes you laugh?

931
01:33:34,737 --> 01:33:35,794
Hold your tongue.

932
01:33:37,755 --> 01:33:40,113
Or we'll turn you, dirty pig!

933
01:33:40,743 --> 01:33:42,044
What? Vaurien!

934
01:33:42,702 --> 01:33:43,983
Hey Jabya!

935
01:33:44,373 --> 01:33:45,786
- What are you saying?
- Go away!

936
01:33:46,812 --> 01:33:49,967
- Go ahead, Jabya!
- You will have them.

937
01:33:50,336 --> 01:33:51,681
- Jabya!
- What are you doing?

938
01:33:52,511 --> 01:33:53,843
How dare you?

939
01:33:54,112 --> 01:33:55,393
Have you gone mad?

940
01:33:55,724 --> 01:33:57,252
Jabya!

941
01:33:57,524 --> 01:33:59,997
- Hey!
- I will not miss them!

942
01:34:00,214 --> 01:34:03,226
- Stop, Jabya!
- Go ahead, plug us at the door.

943
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:05,063
Get the hell out of here!

944
01:34:05,232 --> 01:34:06,312
- Jabya!
- Course!

945
01:34:06,397 --> 01:34:08,055
- Jabya!
- They will see what we are doing.

946
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:09,321
Jabya! Bloody fool!

947
01:34:11,602 --> 01:34:13,558
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Stop!

948
01:34:19,711 --> 01:34:21,057
Leave me!

949
01:34:23,538 --> 01:34:25,331
Why are you throwing rocks towards them?

950
01:34:26,571 --> 01:34:27,628
Come.

951
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,256
- Let go of me.
- Come.

952
01:34:30,513 --> 01:34:31,499
Let them go.

953
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:33,832
- Leave it alone.
- Vaurien.

954
01:34:34,427 --> 01:34:35,387
Leave me alone!

955
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:37,379
- Brother.
- Brother.

956
01:34:43,534 --> 01:34:44,720
Leave me.

957
01:34:45,063 --> 01:34:46,185
Jabya.

958
01:34:55,515 --> 01:34:56,956
Bloody Vaurien!!!
