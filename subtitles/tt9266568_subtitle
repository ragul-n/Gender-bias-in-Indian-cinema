Common people cannot control and
Cremate these criminals.

00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,916
They have thrown eggs on the
car glasses seeing the girl all alone.

65
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,767
She did not stop the car.

66
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,976
And has barged along.

67
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,017
There was a curve up forward
She could not see due to rain.

68
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,681
Due to that she has met with an accident.

69
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,892
Before the car falling down has dashed to the
rock And thus the fuel tank has opened up.

70
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,226
Due to that the car was lit on fire.

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,601
Regular beat police
has identified the vehicle.

72
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,750

before our team had arrived.

00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,583

00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:30,083
They threw eggs on the car

00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,708
Your friend have driven faster.

133
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:38,458
Due to the egg smashed on the glass She did
not see the road an lost control on car.

134
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,833
Due to damage to the petrol tank

137
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,833
Kumar

138
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,666

00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:08,125
Kumar take them to mortuary

00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:12,000
Complete the formalities
soon and let them go Ok Sir.

141
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,583
This is Vishwanath from forensic
Yes tell me Vishwanath.

142
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:35,083
You had sent me sample of Vismaya accident
yesterday While packing it to send it back.

143
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:39,500
Inside the tin which was burnt
I found a blood stained cloth piece.

144
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:45,375
Vismaya blood sample and the blood
On the cloth bold are not matching.

145
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:53,375
Judging the weaving pattern
On cloth it seems to be a gent's cloth.

146
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:59,291
What's interesting is
Have found drug on the cloth.

147
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,500
And it's called Scopolamine
Scopolamine!

148
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:08,000
It's very rare drug right?
Yes it's very rarely used in India.

149
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:14,083
Because it has very high toxic level
And it is expensive to.

150
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:20,041
So you are saying that there was someone else In
the car along with Vismaya and that would be men.

151
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,833
He may be a very rich guy or drug dealer.

152
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,750
Vishwanth will call back if
I need any information.

153
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,875
Ok Ashok! Anytime.

154
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:38,541
Sir RTO reports.

155
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,463
The car which involved in accident
was registered in the name Vishal Sir.

156
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,583
We tried to reach him but
his number was switched off Sir.

157
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,583
While we enquired about him
We come to know he was drug dealer.

158
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:55,375
When we traced the address we got to know that he
is staying In an apartment near Kanakapura road.

159
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,125
He must be a very rich
guy or a drug dealer.

160
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,333
Let's move Yes sir.

161
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,958
He is alive Sir.

162
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,958
He took over dosage of drugs and drinks
as well sir He is asleep like a dead body.

00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:54,541

00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:46,500
Kumar take him to the station We

00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,625
Send drug sample to lab and collect

They say beautiful girls do have beautiful
heart So only I came here to talk to you.

230
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:38,875
You do not know who I am and even who he is?
Intentionally you poured wine on him right?

231
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:44,184
In that case you do not know who I am
But you poured wine on my jacket.

232
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:47,309
No No...! that was an accident

Ok forget it.

235
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:55,166
While ago you said something But I could
not hear anything because of loud music.

236
00:33:55,291 --> 00:34:00,083
What was that?
Nothing I just asked you sorry, that's it!

237
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,500
I thought you said I love you.

238
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,750
What?

239
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,125
This is too much.

240
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,750
While I am talking to you
Even too much becomes normal!

241
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,000

244
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,559
Can I get to know the name of
the girl who dozes off with a touch?

245
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,458
My name is Vismaya Suresh!

246
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,708
Vismaya...! What a nice name!

247
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,541
You know what?
There a magic in your name.

248
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,750
It does not mean magic!

249
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:34,291
Then it's miracle.

250
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,666
Miss miracle, what a nice name.

251
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:40,750
So came here to do a miracle?

252
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:45,833
Too much you are
What's your name?

253
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:51,875
My life style is very simple
but my name is Vishal.

254
00:34:53,291 --> 00:35:01,291
By the way I did not drop wine
intentionally on you It's just accident.

255
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,851
That's ok, chill!

256
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:06,458
In fact it's good for me that
you poured it on my chest.

257
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,583
Else we would have not met.

258
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,892
Even you were single and
I was as well.

259
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:15,351
But now we are mingled and having drinks.

260
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,934
Stop it, you are too much!

261
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:22,809
At first meet you tend to do so much!
It's funny, oh really?

262
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,666
Funny! Funny?

263
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,017
Do you think I am a joker?

264
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:31,125
Joker...! it's very small word for you
You are more than that.

265
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:36,625
Any way I will have to go, am getting late!
Hey wait!

266
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,708
If you do not mind I will drop you.

267
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,602
You can come in my car.

268
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:43,291
No no...! See you!

269
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:51,166
After that, One day while I was driving
home I saw her standing in the bus stop.

270
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,458
What are doing here Vismaya?

271
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh! This is Vishal.

272
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,250
Hey Vishal...!

273
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:02,875

274
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,684
My vehicle is braked down so I have booked

00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,291
No need that's alright, you can go!

277
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:18,750
My car won't accept if this
Beautiful girl won't get in to my car.

278
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,291
At least for my car sake

279
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:25,416
Really? Yes please come

280
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:29,375
With an excuse to drop her
I got her into my car.

281
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,583
She started to talk with comfort.

282
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,625
We both got to know each other well.

283
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,809
You are a funny guy seriously.

284
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:44,458
We should keep meeting Just

285
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,208

286
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,625

00:36:56,291 --> 00:37:01,833
Hey listen thank you so much Bye.

288
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,166
Because of that meeting
we become very close.

289
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:13,750
The time she seated in my car
my track changed completely.

290
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,250
Gradually we started meet in pubs.

291
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:21,625
Meeting and having drinks
become routine in our life.

292
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,875
Her birthday celebration
was held on that day.

293
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,750
By the time it got completed
We both become very close.

294
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:39,250
It was common we both had drinks
And used to visit our flats.

295
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:48,666
Vishal...! In everyone's house we see photos of
god But here I am finding some others photos why?

296
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:55,708
Those who could not be seen are your god!
But these are my gods who could be seen.

297
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,708
They are my heaven
They are everything to me.

298
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,583
You and your god it's funny.

299
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:08,041
I am scared of dark
Please get me the candle.

300
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,541
Are you so scared of dark? Yes.

301
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:16,750
This is my world, what you see brightness?
It is all hell.

302
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:21,083
But in dark we have only happiness.

303
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:24,333
Our dark has no chance for fear.

304
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:28,708

306
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,666
If you agree, my life of heaven
is very near to us.

307
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,333
Will you come?

308
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,791
Oh sure!

309
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:04,041
With an excitement to play the match
We both had got down to the pitch.

310
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:08,833
Only after I got out I got know
I forgot to wear a grip to the bat.

311
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:13,791

00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,958
Are you listening or doing intentionally?

348
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,125
Vishal am five months pregnant.

349
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,583
I am begging you please!

350
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,083
How many times I told you to get aborted.

351
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:11,833
How many times I told you If I get
aborted it is dangerous to my life Vishal.

352
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:18,083
You should have taken precautions
Why you are torturing me now? Get lost!

353
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:25,083
Should I take precautions?
Should I?

354
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,208
Vishal listen to me.

355
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,000
Leave about past,
at least now take responsibility!

356
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,625
Responsibility?

357
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,750
Why should I take responsibility?

358
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,625
What's the proof that kid belongs to me?

359
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,208
Am not ready for some ones kid.

360
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:47,416
Get lost from here.

361
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,166
What did you just say?

362
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:55,291
Even now you get it aborted,
I will throw how much money you need.

363
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:02,476
You throw money on me?
How dare you have talk like this?

364
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,875
I said be calm.

365
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:38,791
I forgot the key in the car
I did not assume that would spoil my life

366
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,666
I drop her in car boot space
And I went to lock the flat.

367
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,833
I forgot car key in boot space.

368
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:53,000
May be she gained conscious then She
drived back the car by using the same key.

369
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:05,958
That's is all that happened between me and
Vismaya After that I do not know anything

370
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,041
Kumar Sir.

371
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:21,458
File an attempt to murder case on him
He was showing a movie to us.

372
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:26,833
Call her friends who came to give complaint
We might know about him from them.

373
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,666
Flirting idiot Sir!

374
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,833
Ashok are you ready?
One minute coming.

375
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:58,375
Normally ladies will take more time
to ready But in our home it's reverse.

376
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:00,708
Come soon Ashok.

377
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:05,125
Where is wedding invitation?
I do not know, it should be there.

378
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:38,583
Ashok why is this girl's photo here?
She is Vismaya, do you know her?

379
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,791
I know, she was my patient
In fact we are going to her marriage.

380
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:48,916
What? Yea!
We are going for Vismaya's marriage.

381
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:54,250
She is no more What?

382
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:59,625
When she was coming after fight with her boy
friend Some goons throw eggs to her glass.

383
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:03,458
So she lost control and it fell to depth
Car caught on fire.

384
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:09,583
She passed away Yesterday we
caught hold of her boy friend Vishal.

385
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:13,750
What you called his name? Vishal.

386
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:20,375
But her boy friend name is Suman
No chance, I am investigating it.

387
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:25,517
I am sure her boyfriend name is Suman.

388
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:30,726
Brother please I want to meet doctor
Please leave me inside.

389
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,875
Can't you understand what I am telling?

390
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:39,583
My son will die if you do not let me to go

391
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,666

Suman's mother.

395
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,291
Tell me madam.

396
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:06,166
My son met with an accident last week
and his head got injured.

397
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:09,500
Since one week he is in coma.

398
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:12,458
Doctor said chances of surviving is less.

399
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,291
You should help him survive.

400
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,708
He said you went to foreign country
And you will come by sixth.

401
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:22,041
Madam please calm down
Come let's go.

402
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,791
Even you come! Get the vehicle.

403
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,250
Show me the MRI report.

404
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,250
Hey Dr. Amrutha
what are you doing here?

405
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,333
One of our known person got admitted here
What's the patient's name?

406
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:53,458
Suman, oh I am treating him
How is his condition?

407
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,708
Madam come to the side.

408
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,875
Due to head injury,
Excessive external bleeding has occurred.

409
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:20,291
Is there any need of surgery? If his
condition remains the same, we may need.

410
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,833
Just take care of him Doctor
Sure!

411
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,041
Thank you Doctor!

412
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:37,416
Madam, not to worry, just checked
the reports Nothing will happen to Suman

413
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,583
I discussed with the doctor,
within two days he will be ok.

414
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:46,291
Thanks for the help
I was scared what would happen to my son

415
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:50,791
I need to leave,
if you need any help let me know ok madam.

416
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,875
What is the accused person saying Ashok?

417
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:09,958
As per him he met her at party
and they love each other.

418
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,496
But finally they quarrelled
due to marriage proposal.

419
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:17,125
What surprises me is, the girl who was
suppose to get married to Suman today.

420
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,416
Why was she torturing Vishal to marry her?

421
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,083
Was she blackmailing him for money?

422
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,875
On what basis she was getting married
someone When she was five months pregnant?

423
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:30,250
What? Pregnant?

424
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:35,416
It's impossible
I just checked her one month back.

425
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:39,833
After kidney transplant
It's danger to be pregnant within a year.

426
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:45,833
Where is the post-mortem report?
Give that file, Thank you!

427
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:59,958
Ashok check this post-mortem report
It says she is not a pregnant.

428
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:11,208
Hey sit down! Sir! Sit.

429
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,041
Do you know Suman? No sir.

430
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:24,041
Do you know that today Vismaya
and Suman were about to get married?

431
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,250
Do not know sir!

432
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:31,791
Vismaya is not pregnant
do you know that at least?

433
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,458
Vismaya is not pregnant?

434
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,666
Idiot!

435
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,633
Till now you said story But you
are telling do not know anything idiot.

436
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,208
Who is this?

437
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,583
I do not know madam!
Don't you know?

438
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,059
Is this is Vismaya?
No madam she not Vismaya.

439
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,083
Sir please give me a minute.

440
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,625
Then who is this girl?

441
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:10,750
Madam she not Vismaya Suresh
If you want check my face book profile.

442
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,375
In that you will find her photos.

443
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:57,958
She is the Vismaya sir Madam I
told you right, she is Vismaya Suresh.

444
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,541
Hey take him.

445
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:27,750
Vismaya and Vismaya Suresh
both are different!

446
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:37,125
When he was telling about Vismaya Suresh
I was glancing about Vismaya.

447
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:47,666
Ashok as per Vishal he does not know Vismaya
Then how is it possible for her to drive his car?

448
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:56,708
By the way Vishal's car was in his apartment
How did Vismaya come to his apartment?

449
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,583
Do you know Vismaya's address Amrutha?

450
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:04,708
I can check with the hospital.

451
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:14,291
If Vismaya Suresh drived the car How did
Vismaya replace Vismaya Suresh's place?

452
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:23,000
Vismaya could have been to that apartment
Their something could have happened.

453
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:26,541
To escape from that she
could have come to basement.

454
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:35,500
As per Vishal he forgot key in car
She saw that key and she drove the car.

455
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,000
You could be right.

456
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,625
But we found Vismaya body

457
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:57,958
what about Vismaya Suresh?

458
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,583
Kumar!
Where is the accident car?

459
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,291
Sir it is at accident spot.

460
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:49,500
Due to heavy rain and As it is
fallen deep we are not able to lift it up.

461
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:51,476
Did you verify the boot space of the car?

462
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,875
We tried sir but the boot space is jammed.

463
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:56,041
We will have to check after lifting it up.

464
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:33,851
Hey slow Careful.

465
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:36,750

467
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,375
Slow.

468
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,416
Move the barricade from there.

469
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:47,750
Straighten the vehicle
Move that side carefully.

470
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,875
One minute Sir Pull it up.

471
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:51,666
The other side.

00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,791
Break that, Hit it harder!

473
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,916
Hit there down, Break it.

474
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,416

Thank you for the information.

482
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:36,267
Look at the face properly.

483
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:37,000
We are coming immidately.

484
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,583
Why are you looking at my face?

485
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:39,791
Yes right.

486
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:44,750
She is Vismaya Suresh Sir
Put this idiot into the cell.

487
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:48,375
Come on Let us go.

488
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:53,833
Ashok!
Suman has gained conscious.

489
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,125
Come soon we will go.

490
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:59,333
Shift all these soon Kumar
Ok Sir.

491
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:03,255
Shift soon guys Not sure how many
more dead bodies are there in this car.

492
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:11,333
As we found Vismaya Suresh body
What Vishal said was true.

493
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,750
Why Vismaya drove his car?

494
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:19,666
Amrutha!

495
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,500
How do you know Vismaya and Suman?

496
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,666
Dr. Sathish
How is the patient condition?

497
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:03,916
We examined sugar level and it is high
And sent blood for investigation.

498
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,125
Report will come now.

499
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,208
You please examine once madam.

500
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,958
What's the BP reading? 118/60.

501
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:37,631
Ok will wait for the blood report
Just stabilise the patient until then.

502
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:43,250
When I checked patient blood report, I got
to know she had type 1 diabetic's myelitis.

503
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:48,166
One who has type 1 diabetic
Required amount insulin is not produced.

504
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:52,333
Because of the high level
Blood sugar in body.

505
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:58,333
In this case, because of type 1 diabetic,
She lost both the kidneys.

506
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,791
That patient is none other than Vismaya.

507
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:08,708
If she had to survive, she had only one option
She needed live organ donor to donate one kidney.

508
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:11,818
That is when Suman came into her life
As a lamp in darkness.

509
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:16,291
Madam Suman come here.

510
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,958
According to HLA report.

511
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,000
It's positive in Blood matching,
cross matching and tissue matching.

512
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,125
So you can donate kidney.

513
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,333
Is there any blood relationship
between you and Vismaya?

514
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,458
No Madam.

515
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:43,583
She is very closely known to me
Because of her my mother is still alive.

516
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:47,125
Vismaya saved your mother's life
So you're giving life to her!

517
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,333
Yes Madam.

518
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:52,458
Today my mother is
alive because of Vismaya.

519
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:58,958
If today I give life to Vismaya Tomorrow
so many people will get help from her.

520
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,166
You should think about your future.

521
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:11,125
Madam future is not a big deal for me
Compared to who saved my mother's life.

522
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,583
You prepare everything for operation madam.

523
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,500
Doctor how is he now?

524
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:18,583
He cannot talk now Amrutha Due to head
injury his nervous system is disturbed.

525
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:22,666
He is able to listen our voice and
He will understand but he cannot talk.

526
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:27,708
Suman I am Dr. Amrutha

527
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,208
He cannot talk Amrutha.

528
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:33,250
I know, but is he able to write?

529
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,750
We could try.

530
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,080
Give me pen if you do have.

531
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,333

532
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:47,208
How do know Vismaya?
How did this accident happen?

533
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:58,541
One day I bought saree for a festival
to mom My mother was not to be seen.

534
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:02,666
While I was searching her.

535
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:08,833
My neighbour informed me about
My mother getting admitted in hospital.

536
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,166
Immediately I went to hospital.

537
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:35,541
I felt lost when I saw her sleeping
Like that on the hospital bed.

538
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:40,833
When I went to meet the doctor
To enquire about my mother's health.

539
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:43,333
What happen to her sir?

540
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,068
What's your relationship with her?

541
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:48,500
I am her son Suman.

542
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:52,916
She had cardiac arrest
So we operated her immediately.

543
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:55,791
Those who admitted your mom,
They have paid all the bills.

544
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:01,750
Who admitted her sir?

545
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:04,958
I do not know who that is But will
check from the visiting card they gave.

546
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,458
This is the their card.

547
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:17,708
They paid all expenses
and helped mom for operation.

548
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:19,818
So went in search of them to meet.

549
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Hello Sir!

550
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,458

I have seen her before somewhere.

557
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:48,000
Are you Shardamma son?

558
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,416
When I was coming on my way,

559
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,378
When I happen to see who it was
It was Shardamma.

560
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:06,458
Immediately I admitted her to hospital
But doctors told she needs surgery.

561
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:14,333
So I arranged money from our Ashram
And paid the bills that's it.

01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,958
She came to know that I had helped her.

601
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:26,083
“I am attracted towards him
I am hypnotised by him.

602
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:36,791
You have infected me by your magic
I have lost to you without any words.

603
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:46,291
Why we need any topic to meet you

01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,791
Mother
I don't find this to be good.

607
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:16,333
Vismaya madam says I should stop selling
tea And should join coffee day as employee

608
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:20,208
I cannot do all that mother
Oh god.

609
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:25,708
As she said anything wrong?
She has feeling towards you.

610
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:32,708
Did she expect her husband to be an officer?
She asked to sell coffee in coffee day.

611
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:37,083
That is all right? I should speak
English in that coffee day mother

612
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:41,041
I am not comfortable with English speaking
I will not go mother.

613
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:46,958
When I have an own business
Why should I work under someone mother?

614
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:52,500
You should speak in English is it?
Oh my king.

615
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,416
Look phone is ringing.

616
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:08,583
Is it not good to communicate in English?
For how many days more you keep selling tea?

617
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:13,125
Go to coffee day and learn English
Everyone will feel happy right.

618
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:20,000
You cannot? Oh god
Just a week left for your marriage.

619
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:24,666
How is it if you
fight for such small things?

620
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:32,625
Love is like a rope that pulls the chariot of
life Both of you should pull the rope equally.

621
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:36,791
Even if one of you do not balance it
The chariot will fall down.

622
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:40,708
Then the life will be destroyed
Look at me soon.

623
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:45,333
Even she will have hundreds of expectations
My husband should be so and do so.

624
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:53,041
It is she What it is she?

625
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,041
Will tell you one thing mother.

626
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:05,166
A person who had a tea stall once upon
a time Is he not ruling the country now?

627
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:11,625
Did I say no? Even my king
could be a Prime Minister one day.

628
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:18,500
Who knows whose fate is what? Even I have
desire that my son should speak in English.

629
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:23,500
Should communicate well in English
Listen to that girl's advice.

630
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:27,416
I have said what I wanted to
Shall I pour curry? A bit.

631
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,500

633
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,260
It will happen as it
is written on your fate.

634
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:45,416
I said to mom what Vismaya had said
Even mom felt it was true.

635
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:50,583
If mother would be happy I thought it would
be correct to join for work in coffee day.

636
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:59,125

01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:17,458
Those interesting matters come like question?
It's not tough to identify the truth.

748
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:25,875
Why inspector Ashok took
10 days to solve this mystery.

749
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:31,166

01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,666
So as per this Mary friends does't have
any connection with Vismaya.

753
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:51,333
Then why Mary and her friends
came here to give compliant?

754
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,125
Then why they took Vismaya dead body?

755
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:58,791
So is there is any
evidence in Vismaya body?

756
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:03,666
Suppose if is there in evidence
at least doctor should know?

757
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:07,708
So who is doctor who done the post morton?

Am inspector Ashok need to talk regarding
Vismaya accident case.

760
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:44,541
This is not right time to talk inspector.

761

01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:06,246

779
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:14,666
While Suji playing carem board with Vicky

780
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:18,625
Then who shoot Sujay?

781
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:23,375
What was the relation
between Kumar and Vikki?

782
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:30,666
Why Dr. Aravinds call
made impact on SI Kumar life.

783
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:35,375
Ashok Find some foot prints

784
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:40,416

Then What SI Kumar told about this?
Here it is take look.

787
01:36:55,625 --> 01:37:02,458
As per my knowledge Only the name Vismaya

788
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:07,583
While mary and his
friends are enjoying in party.

789
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:15,833
It will disturb to her neighbor then she will
call to SI Kumar to take action against them.

790
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:21,750
SI Kumar warned them
for disturbing neighbor.

791
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:41,000
So Sujay asked sorry to SI Kumar and also,
he took neighbor number to tell sorry.

792
01:37:41,458 --> 01:37:47,166
After he know the number he wants to check
flat no he send mary to check flat no.

793
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:55,083
She asked that no with security guard but
he said after wards he will give.

794
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:56,416
She will move from their.

795
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:01,166
While Sujay fighting with her
they got call from security guard.

796

While security informing flat no Same time

While Security guard explining number to the

798
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:21,125
She told that flat number to Sujay.

799
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:31,500
Vismaya saw her flat door opens
without her presence.

800
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:36,375
Door opened now actually I closed the door
while am going how it is possible?

801
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,208

Call the police.

822
01:40:58,125 --> 01:41:02,291
Suman busy at the works
so he didn't pick the Vismaya call.

823
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:07,958
Why what happen
police didn't pick the call.

824
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:10,541
It didn't get connect? So sad.

825
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:17,166
After some time Suman call back to Vismaya
and heard the vismaya's screaming on call.

826
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,041
In hurry he went from there.

827
01:41:22,833 --> 01:41:26,541

starts torturing Vismaya.

828

831
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,875
Same time courier boy knock the door bell.

832
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:38,375
But due to no response
from inside he return back.

833

835
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:10,666

01:42:11,916 --> 01:42:14,291
No one help you

837
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:17,268
Shut up!

838
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:18,333
Leave me!!

839
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:20,291
How dare you to give complaint?

840
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,476
Call the police.

841
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:22,583
Call the police.

842
01:42:49,916 --> 01:42:50,916
Give me the complaint.

843
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:07,583
When his vehicle break down
Suman stops the speedy Vishal car.

844
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:12,958
Even Vishal wants to go golden apartment
so he accept to give lift.

845
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:21,583
When Suman in Vishal car his mobile got switched
off so he tried calling from Vishal car.

846
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:24,833
But call didn't get connect.

847
01:43:25,375 --> 01:43:30,833
The main reason for misleading this case
is Vismaya got call from Vishal number.

848
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:36,458
Vishal napkin and we
found napkin in tin are same.

849
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:43,083
Sujay thought Vismaya given compliant but
another lady has given due to this mislead.

850
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:45,833
In angry moment they killed Vismaya.

851
01:43:48,541 --> 01:43:53,875
While in tension he made a master
plan to overcome from this murder.

852
01:44:08,291 --> 01:44:13,666
When car reached apartment with in no time
Suman run towards Vismaya flat.

853
