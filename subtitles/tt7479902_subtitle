1
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:29,089
Sir, I’ve lost my phone.

2
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:30,431
What’s the big deal about it?

3
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:33,581
Sir, it’s not about the mobile.
The data inside is more important.

4
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,791
Data... What is that?

5
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:42,700
Lift your head.

6
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:43,651
Lift. Now.

7
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,175
Speak up!
Hit him!

8
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,292
Hit him again

9
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:50,378
Sir...!

10
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,721
Why did you kill?

11
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,170
Speak up!

12
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:06,275
I didn’t kill him on purpose.

13
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:12,941
The highest bid was for murder.

14
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:15,179
So, I did it.

15
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,019
Has he lost his mind?

16
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,774
If you ask him about head,
he talks about toe. I think he's a lunatic.

17
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,670
Did the girl recognize him?
Yes sir, she did.

18
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:47,960
Why was there a delay in
filing a complaint?

19
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:52,657
I couldn’t step out of my home
due to personal problems.

20
00:05:57,314 --> 00:06:02,355
He is already a short tempered guy,
This will enrage him further.

21
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:15,931
Sir!

22
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,907
Let me know when Madam arrives.

23
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:30,403
Get up!

24
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,492
Move..

25
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:32,786
Sit down.

26
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:38,067
He is not talking about it
even after being tortured.

27
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,571
I ran a background check.

28
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,541
He has no big contacts

29
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,540
He doesn’t have parents or relatives.

30
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,579
All he has, is the one above us.

31
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,194
Get him down.

32
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,470
Sir, I swear that I have
no connection to this.

33
00:07:58,633 --> 00:07:59,425
Sir!

34
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,928
There are two things that
happen while I interrogate

35
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:09,229
One, you either confess to the crime
irrespective of who has done it.

36
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:16,259
Or, you will die before you agree to it.

37
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,513
I swear I don’t know
anything about this, sir!

38
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:41,615
College life and the classroom,

39
00:08:41,817 --> 00:08:46,609
Will be your paradise.

40
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:57,312
They made us believe this.
Then, they pushed us down the drain.

41
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:08,254
VTU We really love you,
Don’t turn us into jilted lovers.

42
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:19,360
Campus stories are blossoming,
and smiles are introducing us to love.

43
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:24,268
Memories of college are beautiful..

44
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:34,557
Semesters have started,
and it’s driving us crazy.

45
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:45,356
Seniors are a little intimidating
and it’s all happening too fast.

46
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:55,133
USN, is our name now,
while attendance proxy is a habit.

47
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:57,932
Hey! You idiot!
Stand Up.

48
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,056
Do you guys watch porn?

49
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,330
I'm sure he watches them a lot,
just look at all the acne on his face.

50
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,449
You will have to enact your
favorite scene from a porn movie.

51
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:13,132
Get your hands off me!

52
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:16,080
Sir, I won't do it.

53
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,302
Why won't you do it?
You have to do it.

54
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:19,596
If you can't do it.....

55
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,306
..Then you will have to book 10
movie tickets for us tomorrow.

56
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,759
He's come here on a scholarship,
I don't think he will have money.

57
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,096
I'm not forcing him.

58
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:29,630
He can either act today,
Or take us for a movie tomorrow.

59
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:30,929
Okay!?

60
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:32,224
Okay sir.

61
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:39,809
Give me your laptop!

62
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:15,059
Dude, he has booked the tickets.

63
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:17,317
Morning Sir!

64
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,764
Alok! Whole college has
been talking about you.

65
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,602
Did you hack the ticketing website
and book movie tickets for seniors?

66
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,856
Sir, I didn’t have money
to buy tickets sir.

67
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,363
What does your dad do?
My parents are no more.

68
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,946
I was raised in an orphanage

69
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,017
Oh!.....I'm Sorry!

70
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,872
College is the only place where
your mistakes are forgiven

71
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:43,914
It's a different world outside.
You won’t get a lot of chances.

72
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:49,317
If you’re looking at taking up a
lucrative job offer, think again!

73
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:54,508
Engineers in this city are
already packed like sardines.

74
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:59,678
Channelize your intelligence,
Indian IT market is booming

75
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,051
And, Bengaluru is the start
up capital of India.

76
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,262
But starting a start up is not easy.

77
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:10,004
An idea that hasn’t been executed has to
come to you And that will make you win.

78
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:13,486
I’ll think about it sir.
Okay...All the best!

79
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:18,535
This is the guy who booked
tickets for seniors,

80
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:23,029
If I dated him, I would have
watched a new movie everyday.

81
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:29,084
Listen to what I say carefully,
To survive in Bengaluru you need 3 things.

82
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:31,031
Dressing sense, intelligence, and money.

83
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,432
You are intelligent, and dressing sense
would have been better, if you had money.

84
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:39,533
Can we go do shopping together?
Yes!

85
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:46,271
CS, IS, EC... It’s time to send
those friend requests to girls.

86
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,175
Hello! Hi’s! How Are You’s

87
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,005
As we slowly introduce ourselves.

88
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,558
We have started liking,
along with Whatsapp chatting,

89
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:01,620
The Night’s without sleep,
continues in classrooms

90
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:06,745
C has become plus
while fun is on minus

91
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:11,766
M1 & M2 are an eternal knot

92
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:23,546
How do we escape this Syllabus Noise,
Classroom silence, and boys chaos?

93
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:34,171
Bookworms of the first bench,

94
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:44,840
The pranksters of the last bench,
both are tensed.

95
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:49,605
Mass bunk, Cinema, Long
Drive and Attendance shortage,

96
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:55,906
Amidst this even
our friends get engaged.

97
00:13:55,931 --> 00:14:05,781
The projects still haunt us,
and all we want is 15 and 35 plus.

98
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:16,283
Java is killing our lives.
Oh Java! Why don't you die too?

99
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:27,446
Companies want campuses now,
while we want GPA’s to be shown,

100
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:37,482
We are Engineers
We are India’s Future.

101
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:49,428
We are Engineers
India’s Future is still unknown.

102
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:53,499
Alok, I have never wished
for anything in life.

103
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:58,775
Shivani, I’m not important enough
for you to shed tears on me.

104
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,259
We both belong to different worlds.

105
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,448
I’m glad you liked me
despite the differences.

106
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,479
But, please understand,
I’m in no position to decide our future.

107
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:14,033
Alok! I’ll miss you.

108
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,946
I never want to see you again.

109
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:32,277
I have attended 3 interviews since morning.
Couldn’t clear even a single interview.

110
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:34,678
How did your interview go?

111
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,842
I’m sure you must have done well.

112
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:40,309
Wearing shoes is extremely irritating.

113
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:44,725
I don’t think I'm attending any interviews.
Why?

114
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:49,125
Can’t see myself clearing
interviews, wearing formals,

115
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,776
working a 9-6 job, borrowing
money to suffice expenses.

116
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:55,353
Trying to please the
manager, attending his

117
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:58,077
parties and also ending
up paying his bills..

118
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:02,003
..Even after doing all this, at the end of
the month, will still fall short of money.

119
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,670
If I have to wear formals,
then it will be for myself.

120
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:13,015
I want to start a start up.
Super Idea dude!

121
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:15,799
Let’s work only for ourselves.

122
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:17,875
When do we begin?

123
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:21,532
Don’t act on impulse, think about it.

124
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:26,110
I have decided, If I can become anything?
I’d rather be Ambani himself.

125
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:27,909
Give me a Hi-Five!

126
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:39,685
Here's your coffee sir!

127
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,294
There's free Wi-Fi! You can access it.

128
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:10,484
Sir! Are you alright? Help me a little.
I'll look for an auto outside.

129
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:33,025
For how long have you used the system?
About 30 minutes.

130
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:36,050
Earlier credit is 50 Rs, Shall
I take that too? Yes, sure!

131
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:44,423
Hey Raki! Need you vehicle.
I'm shifting my room. Thanks!

132
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:52,370
Sir, we are near the colony.
Come inside!

133
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,167
Has somebody died here?
No! It's just me composing tunes.

134
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:58,597
Compose it after my death!
Please come in.

135
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:06,830
Please hold this! I own a flower business.
Was preparing flowers for an order today.

136
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:09,256
Room is upstairs.
Come I'll show it to you.

137
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,270
Come see!

138
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:23,416
Rent should be paid on the 10th
of every month without fail!

139
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:26,822
Pay the electricity bill, when it arrives.

140
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:35,283
Don't open this door,
it leads to the godown.

141
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,445
Here's the keys!
Thank You!

142
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:09,554
Everybody is posting about their new
car, home, and bike on Facebook

143
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,799
What about it?

144
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:17,251
We set out to be Ambani's. We're now
changing houses without paying rent.

145
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:21,176
I still need time to
prepare my business model

146
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,402
Also, nobody
becomes Ambani overnight!

147
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:31,446
3 years is not overnight!
I don't know how much more should we wait.

148
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:41,448
I've never forced you to stay with me!
Stay if you want, or leave right now.

149
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:58,507
Fighting with my buddy, feeling irritated,
He doesn't understand my feelings.

150
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:06,327
Excuse Me!

151
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:13,757
Yesterday...My laptop..
Don't worry It's safe, How Are You?

152
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,207
I'm okay. One minute!

153
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:23,279
This is my office laptop!
Thank you!

154
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:31,693
Please keep this!
Sorry, I don't accept free money.

155
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,057
I'm Susheel. Alok!
Nice meeting you, Thanks again.

156
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:48,591
Come! Madam, Pooja, she's joined today!
Hi! Hello! Welcome. Thank you!

157
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,415
This is Vidya!
Vidya, This is Pooja!

158
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,618
She's done B.Sc in computer science,
And teaches advance Java. Oh Nice!

159
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,550
Sir! This is Prakash.
He is the senior most faculty!

160
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,343
Hello Sir! Pooja, She's joined us today.

161
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:09,449
We are sitting jobless here,
What will you do after joining?

162
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,214
We will chit-chat and pass time.

163
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:20,174
6 people work in this institute.
5 people including both of us.

164
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,442
And.. Six people including Alok!

165
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:30,010
Alok, Pooja. She's joined us today!

166
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:31,097
Hi!

167
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:42,223
He's talented and a very nice guy.
Zero bad habits, and very hard working!

168
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:46,061
He works with us full-time.
And works part-time at coffee day.

169
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:53,558
There's something charming about him!
Why don't you tell him that you love him?

170
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:59,800
I was behind him for 6 months.
And requested him so much!

171
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,184
Then what happened?
He didn't budge at all.

172
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:09,377
As a last resort, I gave
him an inviting offer,

173
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:12,704
And asked if he's willing
go on an outing.

174
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,800
Did he agree to it?

175
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:21,215
No! he didn't. After this,
I decided to give up on him.

176
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:23,314
So that's how your love story ended?

177
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,800
There was no love,
Just attraction, maybe.

178
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:32,442
Can we use the computer?

179
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:34,674
Why do you want to use it?

180
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:38,008
We have school project to complete.
Do you also have project work? Yes!

181
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:44,052
Please don't do anything brother!
Don't be scared.

182
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:47,308
I won't hit you, come.
What are you doing?

183
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,587
Stand here,
Don't pull my shorts, it's loose.

184
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:58,399
I know why you wear shorts like these.
17', 18', You come here. 17'5.

185
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:03,543
Now go inside. Will measure
when you step out.

186
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:09,212
If the shorts has moved an inch,
then I'll thrash you both.

187
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:14,795
Don't you trust us?
You should have self-control in life.

188
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:23,401
There's nobody at home.
Are you busy?

189
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:31,550
I'm so happy! Aye! Enter
details before going.

190
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,550
Such a melodious music! Uffff!

191
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:44,900
My excitement has hit the roof!

192
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:48,176
Kavya! How are you!
It's been so long since I met you.

193
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:51,426
I am fine!
You should have told that you're coming.

194
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:54,206
Aren't you scared to stay alone?

195
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:56,493
How much time does it take to open a door?

196
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:01,545
How much time does.....!
Whom do you want?

197
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,410
Who's that?
Whom do you want?

198
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:11,579
Isn't this G-12?
No, this is G-11.

199
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,452
Who was that?
Don't you really know him?

200
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:21,791
Sir! I had really come to G-12.
But, this is G-11. Sorry!

201
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:27,242
Encryption. Decryption.

202
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,397
Encoding an information with a key,
And passing it across is encryption.

203
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:34,692
On the other side, if
they know the key,

204
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,559
They can decode, and
obtain the information.

205
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,560
Didn't you guys understand?
No!

206
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:59,354
A has gold which he has to give C
but, B shouldn't know that there's gold.

207
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:07,735
So A adds plus 2 to each letter and
passes it. This is encryption.

208
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:09,967
Plus 2 is the key.

209
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:18,967
Now, B doesn't realize that it's gold.
C will obtain the gold by subtracting 2.

210
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,655
This process is called decryption.

211
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,547
I told my parents that I'll take up commerce
and not science. Please let me go ma'am.

212
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:29,523
Sit down!

213
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:41,375
Instead of just laughing.
Can't you come and help?

214
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:45,967
It's my first class. Please!
I'll come.

215
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:55,262
As children, Me and mybr/friend
spoke in Pa & Ta Language.

216
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:59,488
Nobody understood the language except us.

217
00:25:59,654 --> 00:26:02,116
Even we have used it!
Really? Nice!

218
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:05,228
How do you ask if somebody
had lunch in Pa Language?

219
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,708
Ha-Pa-D Lu-Pa-nch (Had Lunch)

220
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:17,667
Here, Had Lunch is your information.
Ha-Pa-D Lu-Pa-nch is your encrypted code.

221
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:23,409
Pa is the key used to encrypt and decrypt.

222
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,647
That's encryption and decryption for you!

223
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:27,672
Now we understood everything, sir!

224
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:35,906
It was tough for me to explain.
You made it look simple, thanks a lot.

225
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:40,074
This is my favourite subject.
I have done a lot of projects on it.

226
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:06,037
Sorry! Grandparents came unexpectedly.
Couldn't text you after that.

227
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:13,466
Are you angry?

228
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:19,171
No!

229
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,733
Then what is my prince doing?

230
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:30,789
There are no wars to fight,
So he is resting now.

231
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:46,922
Tomorrow, everybody in the
family is leaving this

232
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:49,535
princess behind and are
stepping out of the kingdom.

233
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,233
Really?
Yes.

234
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,210
Then your kingdom
Will be our hunting ground.

235
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,250
You must fill an entry form
every time you visit.

236
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:13,224
You didn't do it last time.
My manager scoffs at me later.

237
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:15,225
He acts like this is
a software company.

238
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,550
I'm done entering, can I go now?

239
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:24,550
One Minute! Is your name Asthi?
It's Aasthi and Asthi.

240
00:28:26,148 --> 00:28:28,145
What's the purpose of this visit?

241
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:42,633
Kavya, wait! Don't run. Stop.

242
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:49,675
Not bad, the king does hunt well!

243
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:55,675
When the security asked for purpose
of Visit. I went completely blank.

244
00:28:56,114 --> 00:29:00,675
You should have told him 'I've come to talk
with the girl I am getting married to'

245
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,680
The mention of marriage
makes my temperature soar.

246
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,892
You said there's wine at home, right?
Go bring it.

247
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:17,773
Choose between us, Me or the wine?
Me or the wine?

248
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,044
Hi! How are you?
Fine! How are you? Good!

249
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:28,253
I've got to check on the
cooking stove. Bye!

250
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:46,925
Majnoo misses you. Laila misses you too.
Now leave! Bye!

251
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:56,001
Alok! I want to take you out for a coffee.
For helping me with the class. Please come.

252
00:29:56,977 --> 00:30:03,049
Pooja! I'm a little busy.
You Carry on. Okay!

253
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:23,260
Is playing a game more important
than having coffee with me?

254
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,690
This is too much.
Okay! Let's go.

255
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,509
What do you have? Idli,
poori, kesari baath,

256
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:38,505
Khaara baath, bisi bele
baath, and rice bath.

257
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:45,734
How much does one plate Idli cost? 20rs.
How about single vada? That is 20 rs too.

258
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:54,092
How about rice bath? 25 rs.
Okay! Go get me a cup of coffee.

259
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:58,772
Just to buy a coffee,
He's enquiring about the entire world.

260
00:30:58,804 --> 00:31:02,379
What do you want?
One Coffee please.

261
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:06,423
Two Coffees to this table.
One Idli Vada to that table.

262
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,236
I'll pay the money for it.
Make sure you don't let him know.

263
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,092
Do you know the old man?
No, I don't.

264
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:17,092
Then why did you order for him? When you're
hungry you shouldn't bother about money.

265
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:22,813
Are you saying he doesn't have money?
Did you see how arrogant he was?

266
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:26,625
My guess is that he's
extremely hungry.

267
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:29,092
When you're hungry, you
tend to be more angry.

268
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:38,435
Here's your coffee.

269
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:48,943
Coffee! I had just ordered for a coffee!

270
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:52,208
Today if you buy coffee,
We give a plate of free idli Vada. Enjoy!

271
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:17,175
Alok! Don't you have a girlfriend?
No! Why?

272
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:22,175
I just asked! Nobody asks for vacancy,
If they have no intention of applying.

273
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:26,175
My intention was not to
apply, but curiousity..

274
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:29,135
if you take care of the needs
of a stranger, So well.

275
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:34,025
How well should you understand
your girlfriends needs.

276
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:38,175
No girl will agree to be with me, Just
because we show concern and care for them.

277
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:43,175
If you search at the right place.
You will get a perfect girl.

278
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:50,217
I can see only old people here.

279
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:52,806
Are they only old people here? Huh?

280
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:29,518
Hi! I am Aasthi!
And you are?

281
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:34,996
How did you get this?
I've become close to the owner.

282
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:36,719
He said take it whenever you want.
The rent can be paid later too.

283
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:41,386
This is my friend Arasaiah Thimmapa!
Excuse me! It's Aasthi. Just Aasthi!

284
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:48,480
I am Pooja! Hi!
What's your full name?

285
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:54,258
It's Pooja Ramesh. Nice Meeting You.
Nice meeting you too, Pooja.

286
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:59,342
Okay let's leave.
Bye!

287
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:09,288
Shall we leave?
Yes!

288
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:16,131
It doesn't look like there's
a forced entry anywhere.

289
00:37:16,143 --> 00:37:18,790
I think the murderer
knew this person well.

290
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:24,425
One wine glass is missing from the set.
A lot of evidences are gradually surfacing.

291
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,946
I had heard about laughter
being the best medicine,

292
00:37:55,803 --> 00:38:00,467
Never believed in it. After seeing
you laugh, I believe it.

293
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:07,055
Whoa! Somebody is learning how to flirt.
It's not flirting, it's just the truth.

294
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:12,467
What made you laugh so much today?
Aasthi had sent a funny video on facebook.

295
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,258
How is Aasthi your friend?

296
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:24,052
When did he become your friend?

297
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,467
Remember he asked for my full name,
He sent a friend request the same day.

298
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:33,264
Did you accept just
because he sent it. Yes.

299
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:35,342
If he's your friend,
then he's my friend too.

300
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:38,137
Do you feel I shouldn't
have accepted it?

301
00:38:38,534 --> 00:38:41,342
Don't laugh for everything, people
will think you're mad.

302
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:45,342
I don't understand,
what goes on in your mind
          when you laugh.

303
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:48,043
Someone was calling laughter
as the best medicine.

304
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:50,783
Looks like the medicine
isn't working now.

305
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:55,342
He's a big flirt, His head is filled
with thoughts related to girls.

306
00:38:56,583 --> 00:39:00,342
Really?
He changes girlfriends like Whatsapp DPs.

307
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:09,493
So Often! That's very bad. From tomorrow
he will kill you with candy crush invites.

308
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:17,342
I hate candy crush. I should have never
accepted his friend request at all.

309
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:23,342
Exactly! Exactly? Exactly!

310
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:28,342
But, I think it's okay, My friend
list is filled with flirts anyway.

311
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:32,342
He will become an addition to it,
I'll manage him with the others.

312
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:37,334
Good! Very Good! Please carry on.

313
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:45,549
You know what? No!
There's nobody like you in my friend list.

314
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:53,425
What does that mean? Somebody who's
caring, possesive, protective.

315
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:57,453
I'm neither hitting on you
nor being possessive.

316
00:39:57,465 --> 00:40:01,954
advising you like a friend..No!
like a brother...

317
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:09,583
Shhhhh! Stop it. Pooja you
haven't heard anything.

318
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:19,748
Relax. Just Relax. Breathe out!
It's okay.

319
00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:25,930
How could you think I'm like your sister?
Do you see any flaws in me?

320
00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:36,737
Yeah right! Keep laughing,
laughter is the best medicine after all.

321
00:40:36,762 --> 00:40:47,366
Together, waves wave their hands
as the shore nods in agreement..

322
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:52,962
..You are the music to my breath and
words to my heart.. The girl with

323
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:54,562
less sister characteristics and more
of a girlfriend. Coffee? Tomorrow?

324
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:59,779
..and every tune is
slowly making me feel euphoric..

325
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:02,974
..I will become your shadow
even when it's dark..

326
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:09,729
..Will walk with you,
while you walk towards me..

327
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:18,163
I will reach your heart,
and will rest on your lap..

328
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:21,076
..I don’t need anything else..

329
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:26,603
..This feeling is new to me
Give something new to me..

330
00:41:26,628 --> 00:41:31,917
..A new world may be..

331
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,671
..Pester me for the secret
I haven’t revealed..

332
00:42:39,696 --> 00:42:46,337
..With words so soothing,
that my senses calm down..

333
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:53,271
..I will be your shadow’s shadow
as I walk together..

334
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:57,776
..And wait for you
while you come towards me..

335
00:42:57,801 --> 00:43:03,135
..This feeling is new to me
Give something new to me..

336
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,246
..A new world may be..

337
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:16,387
..The love that you haven’t seen
Will be gifted to you..

338
00:43:16,412 --> 00:43:19,666
..For, just dreams, I will not promise..

339
00:43:41,022 --> 00:43:52,765
The words hidden in my heart
Can I accept them like a sweet defeat?

340
00:43:52,847 --> 00:44:05,620
Smitha! let it through!
Come! Come!

341
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:08,160
Hi! this is Aasthi! Alok's friend.
Hi! Smitha.

342
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:27,508
Okay! let's go!
It's already too late.

343
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:34,508
Bye! Okay bye!
Should we really have to go?

344
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:39,508
Tomorrow what time will you meet? It
depends on what time you let me go today.

345
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:45,120
You've never seen me
wearing a saree no? No!

346
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:49,550
I've never seen you
while wearing a saree.

347
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:53,550
I'll wear a saree tomorrow,
If you promise to come soon. Okay?

348
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,094
Bye! Bye!
What's your favorite color?

349
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,550
Pink Color.
He was wearing Pink color shirt sir!

350
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:08,550
My brother is mentally ill. He may appear
nomal, but at times he is out of control.

351
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:12,262
ACP had asked to take a look at the boy.

352
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:19,592
Did nobody come near the apartment,
from 11am till 2 pm?

353
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,289
The lady in the apartment
is not a respectable woman

354
00:45:23,718 --> 00:45:26,150
None of us knew about
him visiting her often.

355
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,762
Nobody else came. Only him.
He came twice in this week.

356
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:37,592
The first time he came, he left in 5
minutes. The second time he came..

357
00:45:37,592 --> 00:45:39,633
She must have trapped him
after knowing he's rich.

358
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:45,345
Stand outside! I'll call you again!

359
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:54,252
Money is not of importance, Avinash.
Our family has a reputation in this society.

360
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:56,039
This case is very embarrassing

361
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:04,168
Everything has a price in this world,
Avinash. I'm writing yours in bold.

362
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,292
Get up your Bast**d!

363
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:17,023
During the murder, apart from Aasthi,
nobody else has entered the house.

364
00:46:17,364 --> 00:46:20,842
The numbers written in the register,
are switched off.

365
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:27,161
The guy in the lock up,
isn't responding at all.

366
00:46:32,182 --> 00:46:34,000
You leave! I'll come and look into it.

367
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:46,240
Summon Aasthi to police station,
and then file a FIR against him.

368
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,419
Everything has a price, agreed. but not
everybody can afford to buy everything.

369
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:13,470
This is the price of my mercy on you.
Your work will be done. You can leave.

370
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:24,412
Hi! Good Morning!
Has Alok come to work?

371
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:26,092
Not Yet!

372
00:47:27,747 --> 00:47:28,967
Good Morning Madam!

373
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:32,306
Smitha, is this looking good?

374
00:47:36,466 --> 00:47:37,798
He will come and tell you!

375
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:50,254
..As the cloud sways with winds,
every droplet turns into a pearl..

376
00:47:50,413 --> 00:48:06,909
..The bud turns into a flower,
and waits to turn into a bee's adulation..

377
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:09,692
Beyond the ocean,
Beyond my emotions,

378
00:48:09,811 --> 00:48:19,198
..Like a dream turning into reality. Did
it rain? Did the drops turn into pearl?

379
00:48:19,223 --> 00:48:21,899
Beyond the ocean,
Beyond my emotions,

380
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:30,368
..Like a dream turning into reality. Did
it rain? Did the drops turn into pearl?

381
00:48:30,393 --> 00:48:43,037
..Waiting for you at dusk,
as love turns into a pearl..

382
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:48,133
..And it drifts into a silence..

383
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,259
Done shopping?

384
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:01,687
Yes!

385
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:06,860
What did you buy?

386
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:09,470
Excuse Me!

387
00:49:09,807 --> 00:49:11,820
Does Aasthi live here?

388
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,011
He stays in third floor!

389
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,726
Could you guide them to his house?

390
00:49:16,202 --> 00:49:16,824
Okay come!

391
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,433
Go and bring him, if he's there.
Ok Sir!

392
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,314
Four Dresses!

393
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:32,736
Four? What all?

394
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:36,152
2 Shirts and 2 pants.

395
00:49:36,177 --> 00:49:41,552
Your clothes must be so lucky.

396
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,897
Why will they be lucky?

397
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:59,720
It gets to hug you an entire
          day.

398
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:02,198
Nobody is opening the door.

399
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,620
There's nothing I can do about that.

400
00:50:12,214 --> 00:50:15,835
Naughty guy!

401
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:21,050
Were you inside the room all this while?

402
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:22,281
Can't you knock the door once?

403
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:24,384
What were you upto inside the room?

404
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:31,240
I've called you around 30 times.
Your phone was switched off.

405
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:34,168
I was completing projects.
Didn't realize that phone was off.

406
00:50:34,644 --> 00:50:40,886
Oh! Okay! Go near the institute once.
Pooja is apparently waiting for you.

407
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,320
How do you know about her waiting?

408
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:05,310
I was chatting with Smitha,
She told me about it.

409
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:08,089
Smitha? When did this begin?

410
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,731
Can't you keep your hands
and mouth to yourself?

411
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:16,313
A good manager will never
keep his resource idle.

412
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:36,895
Smitha! Where's Pooja?

413
00:51:37,713 --> 00:51:39,492
She was waiting since morning,
and left sometime back.

414
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:43,281
Let her be today,
She will be angry.

415
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:46,028
You can console her tomorrow.
Bye Sir!

416
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:49,967
Was she wearing a saree?

417
00:51:52,428 --> 00:51:53,257
How was she looking?

418
00:51:55,728 --> 00:51:59,278
It will look good only to the
person she wore it for..

419
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:14,133
Good Morning!

420
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:16,670
Morning!

421
00:52:22,834 --> 00:52:26,056
Hi! Good Morning!

422
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:30,392
I thought you'd be angry.
Why should I be angry?

423
00:52:30,743 --> 00:52:33,743
That I couldn't meet you yesterday!

424
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,925
You will have your own priorities, Alok.

425
00:52:36,925 --> 00:52:39,851
You must have worked on
the project the entire night

426
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:42,925
Your phone must
have died without charge.

427
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:45,204
I can wear saree anytime.

428
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:48,372
I should understand that your
priorities are different.

429
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:51,590
Why are you segregating things between us?

430
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:53,444
What's your system password?

431
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:59,971
The moment you give
your password to a new girl

432
00:52:59,983 --> 00:53:02,050
She will know the
name of the old one.

433
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:05,243
So, there are secrets between us.

434
00:53:05,532 --> 00:53:09,092
And that means we both
have different lives too.

435
00:53:10,915 --> 00:53:13,108
You are right about why I
didn't meet you yesterday.

436
00:53:13,614 --> 00:53:15,188
I'm Really Sorry!

437
00:53:15,213 --> 00:53:16,974
I don't like people who lie.

438
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:19,657
I'm not lying, Pooja!

439
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:25,509
The time alone,
That I spent,

440
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:32,560
..Like I always wished to spend..

441
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:37,585
..The things you always wished for..

442
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:43,852
..I’ve always waited for you to say..
In my own way..

443
00:53:43,877 --> 00:53:50,018
..Please find the heart
to forgive my heart..

444
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:55,002
..Will wait for it till eternity..

445
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:02,435
..I hope you find the heart,
I hope it rains forgiveness..

446
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:08,335
..In the clear blue sky,
I hope the drops turn into pearls..

447
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:12,460
..Beyond the ocean,
Beyond my emotions..

448
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:17,543
..Like a dream turning into reality
Did it rain? ..

449
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,168
..Did the drops turn into pearl?

450
00:54:21,877 --> 00:54:24,877
..Beyond the ocean,
Beyond my emotions..

451
00:54:24,877 --> 00:54:29,918
..Like a dream turning into reality
Did it rain? ..

452
00:54:30,127 --> 00:54:33,063
Did the drops turn into pearl?

453
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:40,708
Done freshening up.

454
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,319
Which soap do you use?

455
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:44,451
Mysore Sandal Soap.

456
00:54:46,753 --> 00:54:49,901
Your soap must be so lucky.

457
00:54:50,126 --> 00:54:53,204
Getting ready to sleep now.

458
00:54:53,435 --> 00:54:57,053
Your bed must be so lucky.

459
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:05,214
I can't sleep without a blanket.

460
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:11,585
Oh God! Even the blanket is so lucky!
I wish you could make me lucky too.

461
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,713
How?

462
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:18,924
By sending your picture.

463
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:39,491
Do we need secrets between us?
Send a picture that doesn't hide anything.

464
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:44,740
You send it first.

465
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,038
Hahaahaha.. Little Popeye!

466
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:20,239
Alok! I'm missing you a lot!

467
00:56:22,314 --> 00:56:24,182
I'm dying to see you in a saree, Pooja!

468
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:29,762
I want to spend time with you!
Can we go to your room?

469
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,734
I've got a surprise for you!

470
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:39,027
Who's this girl?

471
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:44,147
She's my friend!

472
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:48,177
If she's a friend, then it's okay.

473
00:56:48,202 --> 00:56:51,202
Guys before you used to
introduce girls as their sisters!

474
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:01,906
This is my room!
Finally.. I get to step in.

475
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,858
Saree... For you!

476
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:15,152
Saree? How can I drape it here?

477
00:57:23,632 --> 00:57:26,105
This goes to owner's godown.
There won't be anybody there.

478
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:28,738
You can change here!
Hold this bag.

479
00:57:56,210 --> 00:58:01,960
You’re a miracle..
How do I believe it without getting close?

480
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,752
The desire to get close
has increased with time.

481
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:14,335
Mesmerizing beauty, unfolds
in front of my eyes.

482
00:58:14,335 --> 00:58:19,877
My Quivering lip has a lot to say.

483
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:26,210
I’m slowly losing myself,
even breathing has turned into music.

484
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:32,543
My heart is getting restless,
to fulfill its desires.

485
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:44,752
If you draw me so close to you.
How do I survive?

486
00:58:47,293 --> 00:58:55,502
Should we still hide from the world,
Till you see the other side of me.

487
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:32,252
Need a magical touch
to free me of this curse..

488
00:59:32,668 --> 00:59:44,377
The flame in your eyes,
has started a wildfire in me.

489
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:57,168
As we spend time together,
each moment is colorful.

490
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:10,633
Heart is a garden now,
and so begins my search for the treasure.

491
01:00:48,977 --> 01:00:54,102
Tell your password! Will change it
from old girlfriend's name to my name.

492
01:01:01,477 --> 01:01:02,577
Love You Anu!

493
01:01:31,602 --> 01:01:32,435
Aasthi?!

494
01:01:34,435 --> 01:01:35,516
Aasthi!!

495
01:01:38,885 --> 01:01:40,927
Hey Manasa!
How do I get out of this?

496
01:01:41,927 --> 01:01:42,968
Hi!

497
01:01:43,968 --> 01:01:46,010
How come you're here?
How have you been?

498
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,010
I'm awesome! How about you?
I'm good too!

499
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:07,671
What are you upto these days?
This is my son. He's Cute.

500
01:02:07,696 --> 01:02:10,505
After marriage I shifted
to the US, came here for

501
01:02:10,517 --> 01:02:14,466
vacations. Will fly back
by the end of this month.

502
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:19,499
How about you? My company
is almost ready,

503
01:02:20,142 --> 01:02:25,052
Once investors are on-board,
There's no looking back.

504
01:02:25,052 --> 01:02:27,896
Why did we even break up, Aasthi?

505
01:02:29,432 --> 01:02:32,724
You never trusted me, were
always dominating.

506
01:02:32,736 --> 01:02:37,446
It's impossible to handle a
relationship like that.

507
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:39,536
I thought I deserved a better girl!

508
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:46,052
It's not about a better girl.
You can never take care of any girl.

509
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:51,256
Smooth talk is good
during college days.

510
01:02:51,558 --> 01:02:55,052
When it comes to marriage,
you always run away.

511
01:02:55,752 --> 01:03:01,864
I thought you're responsible now.
But you're dependent on Alok even now.

512
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,939
As a friend, Here's
something I can tell,

513
01:03:06,756 --> 01:03:09,246
Only you can take
control of your life.

514
01:03:09,701 --> 01:03:10,738
Good Bye!

515
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:49,580
Bye! Bye!

516
01:03:56,198 --> 01:03:57,240
Pooja!

517
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:01,456
When are we meeting again?

518
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:07,606
We've started it today!
Will keep meeting more often.

519
01:04:12,025 --> 01:04:15,409
Can't I take my own decisions?!

520
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:20,833
Choosing not to marry you,
Was also my own decision.

521
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:25,076
You left me for a guy from US.

522
01:04:26,044 --> 01:04:28,709
How much did you drink?
Why are you talking so loudly?

523
01:04:28,734 --> 01:04:36,313
Alok, I am completely dependent on you, it
seems. Infact, I'm nothing without it you.

524
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:37,650
Is this true?

525
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:45,707
It might be true, Without you, I
can't even get inside our room.

526
01:04:45,732 --> 01:04:51,266
Yes, You can't go inside.
Because I have the room key.

527
01:04:52,327 --> 01:04:56,270
Get up!
We can't go without keys, Come sit.

528
01:05:01,461 --> 01:05:02,803
I Met Manasa today.

529
01:05:03,788 --> 01:05:10,466
You can't take care of girl. Infact,
you can't even take an own decision.

530
01:05:10,982 --> 01:05:13,798
She said your existence is a waste.
Mine?

531
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:16,368
Not you.
She told it to me.

532
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:19,574
She chided me a lot and left.

533
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:22,962
Alok! Alok!!

534
01:05:23,426 --> 01:05:26,363
Is it true?
Am I good for nothing?

535
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,564
Aasthi!

536
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,389
Life gives everybody an opportunity
To prove themselves.

537
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:41,657
Till that happens and we prove ourselves,
We are all good for nothing.

538
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:47,733
Oh Sorry Manasa!

539
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:53,989
You were right, Manasa!
I am good for nothing!

540
01:05:56,557 --> 01:06:03,116
I loved her for 2 years. She left me,
when I had nothing left with me.

541
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:07,986
I am with you since 7 years.
Why haven't you left me yet?

542
01:06:11,142 --> 01:06:13,104
Like how lovers have this
thing called break up.

543
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:17,717
There's nothing of that sort for friends.
That's why.

544
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,152
That's enough philosophy for the day.
Let's go now.

545
01:06:21,366 --> 01:06:23,271
I love you so much!

546
01:06:23,628 --> 01:06:29,024
You've been handling me,
A good for nothing fellow since 8 years.

547
01:06:30,103 --> 01:06:36,153
You could have gotten married by now,
And could have even flown to the US.

548
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:39,911
But you did not do anything like that.

549
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:44,573
You've always let me be with you,
In all your highs and lows.

550
01:06:45,192 --> 01:06:47,233
Give me a minute!

551
01:06:47,828 --> 01:06:50,080
I may be drunk...
But listen to what I say..

552
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:54,924
Friendship is always greater than love..

553
01:06:58,408 --> 01:06:59,980
The house looks so clean!

554
01:07:00,005 --> 01:07:01,325
*Pukes*

555
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,596
I will never drink ever again.

556
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:14,531
You even clean me up,
You're really great, Alok!

557
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:20,466
True friendship is.....
Shut up and sleep.

558
01:07:47,419 --> 01:07:48,461
Whom do you want?

559
01:07:49,993 --> 01:07:51,305
Sir! Hello! Sir!!

560
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:53,749
Sir, He's not well..

561
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:56,693
Wake up!

562
01:07:58,049 --> 01:08:00,045
Sir, he's completely drunk.

563
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,888
Put some clothes and get him.

564
01:08:03,957 --> 01:08:04,787
Wake him up now!

565
01:08:11,785 --> 01:08:15,785
I want to pee!
I'll make you pee in station.

566
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:40,882
The only crime we've done
is stealing a girls heart.

567
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:43,335
Please tell why have you arrested us!?

568
01:08:43,474 --> 01:08:44,969
Officer will come and explain, wait.

569
01:09:10,386 --> 01:09:11,427
Good Morning Madam!

570
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:27,997
All of you wait here!

571
01:09:55,846 --> 01:10:01,225
You have hacked confidential
information from Government data center.

572
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:05,301
It's good if you confess to your crimes,
and return the files.

573
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:09,808
Or, I'll have to proceed
with interrogation.

574
01:10:10,244 --> 01:10:11,522
I haven't stolen any files.

575
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:19,048
Anagha! Chief wants to see you.

576
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:26,904
Be a little harsh on him,
Let me know when he confesses.

577
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,393
I think you need look into this sir!

578
01:10:57,512 --> 01:10:59,814
There's been a lot of network usage,
Since the last three days.

579
01:10:59,952 --> 01:11:02,355
Somebody has broken into our security.

580
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,589
What?
We have lost too much data!

581
01:11:04,952 --> 01:11:07,952
My God!
Inform cyber intelligence immediately!

582
01:11:10,952 --> 01:11:13,993
Top Priority Case!
Data center has been hacked.

583
01:11:13,993 --> 01:11:17,159
One clue has been pointing
towards a training institute in Bangalore.

584
01:11:17,953 --> 01:11:21,018
Anagha! Leave immediately!
Ok Sir!

585
01:11:25,785 --> 01:11:27,118
What's your system password?

586
01:11:46,023 --> 01:11:50,382
We've started it today!
Will keep meeting more often.

587
01:14:14,397 --> 01:14:16,563
Hi! This is Phaneesh from SBB Team.

588
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,855
Yes, the development is in progress.

589
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:20,897
DB team is working on the ticket.

590
01:14:21,063 --> 01:14:23,688
Once solved,
we shall proceed.

591
01:14:23,938 --> 01:14:24,563
Thank You!

592
01:14:24,605 --> 01:14:25,355
You Too.

593
01:14:28,438 --> 01:14:29,313
No Parking!

594
01:14:29,397 --> 01:14:31,188
The fine is 750 rupees

595
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,313
Why should I pay 700rs fine for no parking?!

596
01:14:33,313 --> 01:14:34,397
Hey you, bring your DL!

597
01:14:34,772 --> 01:14:36,022
If you got to court it will be 750rs

598
01:14:36,063 --> 01:14:37,772
Just pay 500rs here, and leave.

599
01:14:37,938 --> 01:14:39,688
I was getting a call,

600
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:42,022
so had to stop my vehicle on the side.

601
01:14:42,022 --> 01:14:43,230
Ya! But that was a no parking zone.

602
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:45,897
Pay 750 rupees or just
give 300 rupees and leave.

603
01:14:47,105 --> 01:14:49,397
Why should I pay fine?

604
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:52,188
If you got to court you will
have to pay 750 rupees.

605
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:53,313
Okay, Just pay 200 rupees here.

606
01:14:53,563 --> 01:14:55,855
Please try and understand my point!

607
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,813
If you can't even pay 200 rupees,

608
01:14:57,855 --> 01:14:59,022
Why should I listen to you?

609
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:01,522
You should have thought about this
before breaking the rules.

610
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:02,938
Sir, I follow rules very strictly

611
01:15:03,022 --> 01:15:04,772
I haven't even taken a wrong U-Turn ever.

612
01:15:04,938 --> 01:15:07,647
I'll pay the fine, here take this.
Okay Give!

613
01:15:07,688 --> 01:15:08,272
Give me the receipt.

614
01:15:08,355 --> 01:15:09,647
You write the acknowledgement, I'll pay.

615
01:15:09,688 --> 01:15:10,647
I'm writing it, you pay it first.

616
01:15:34,188 --> 01:15:37,147
Why do you look so angry, Phaneesh?

617
01:15:37,147 --> 01:15:39,647
Try paying 750 rupees fine early morning.

618
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,480
You will know.

619
01:15:40,522 --> 01:15:42,480
Even a no parking board wasn't placed there.

620
01:15:42,897 --> 01:15:45,188
Honest people are not valued at all.

621
01:15:45,397 --> 01:15:47,980
IT employees can never make

622
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:49,972
The kind of money police and thieves make.

623
01:15:51,272 --> 01:15:53,355
I'm planning to pull off a crime,

624
01:15:53,397 --> 01:15:54,813
and settle down peacefully.

625
01:15:55,147 --> 01:15:56,772
You could join me if you want.

626
01:15:56,855 --> 01:15:57,480
Sir!

627
01:15:57,563 --> 01:15:59,063
A policeman is looking for you.

628
01:15:59,563 --> 01:16:00,938
I haven't even planned yet,

629
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,522
Are they here already?

630
01:16:04,397 --> 01:16:05,313
Phaneesh!?

631
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:06,688
Hello! Hi!

632
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:07,031


633
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,855
Anagha! Cyber lntelligence Bureau

634
01:16:09,188 --> 01:16:12,313
I don't know why I have been summoned here.

635
01:16:12,855 --> 01:16:15,105
Were you suspended from college,

636
01:16:15,105 --> 01:16:17,522
for leaking principal's private pictures online?

637
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:20,147
I had a problem with my Head of Department

638
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:23,480
I didn't know that HOD had an affair with principal.

639
01:16:23,522 --> 01:16:25,590
You have taken money from Ling Basaiah Nandimutt's

640
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:28,299
bank account and transferred it to yours.

641
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:30,267
There's no case against you,

642
01:16:30,402 --> 01:16:31,813
Because he hasn't filed a complaint.

643
01:16:31,855 --> 01:16:35,563
Taking money from your dad's purse is not a crime.

644
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:37,480
Ling Basaiah is my father,

645
01:16:37,563 --> 01:16:39,063
hence he didn't press charges.

646
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:41,230
But, he pressed me well at home.

647
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:42,355
IRCTC?

648
01:16:42,438 --> 01:16:44,647
There was a bug in their algorithm

649
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,813
lnfact they didn't know that their website

650
01:16:46,897 --> 01:16:49,647
was hacked until I told them about it.

651
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:51,522
I'm not doing all this now.

652
01:16:51,522 --> 01:16:52,605
I'm a changed man.

653
01:16:52,647 --> 01:16:54,444
Why am I being arrested now?

654
01:16:55,105 --> 01:16:56,355
You are not being arrested.

655
01:16:56,647 --> 01:16:58,313
We are investigating a case..

656
01:16:58,355 --> 01:16:59,605
...Need your help on that.

657
01:17:00,355 --> 01:17:02,438
Never knew the mistakes I did,

658
01:17:02,438 --> 01:17:04,397
would turn out to be my qualification.

659
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:05,666
Sorry!

660
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:06,855
Come!
Sorry!

661
01:17:10,355 --> 01:17:13,272
I have an appointment
to meet the Chief Minister.

662
01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:14,730
Are you Ms.Anagha?

663
01:17:14,688 --> 01:17:15,397
Yes!

664
01:17:22,063 --> 01:17:23,813
Delhi Intelligence has ordered

665
01:17:24,355 --> 01:17:27,480
the local police force to support you.

666
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,230
But I can't do it without details.

667
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:37,313
I don't have time, make it quick.

668
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:38,397
Sure Sir!

669
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:40,105
I'll quickly run you through the case.

670
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,522
In 2009, Indian Government,

671
01:17:42,522 --> 01:17:44,938
Collected the names, addresses, photographs..

672
01:17:45,147 --> 01:17:47,313
“Fingerprints of all the fingers,

673
01:17:47,355 --> 01:17:49,647
Iris from the eye, from all its citizens...

674
01:17:49,772 --> 01:17:52,355
To give everybody an unique identity

675
01:17:52,355 --> 01:17:54,355
through the SUDHAR program

676
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:57,855
The main intention was to quash fake IDs

677
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:01,980
And also,.. I know what SUDHAR is, please proceed.

678
01:18:02,082 --> 01:18:03,397
Everybody knows about it.

679
01:18:03,855 --> 01:18:04,980
I'm sure you know.

680
01:18:05,355 --> 01:18:07,813
Just telling it, so you don't find it difficult

681
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:13,897
to analyze the damage and losses from this case.

682
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,272
Loss? Analyze? What do you mean?

683
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,313
I shall explain!

684
01:18:20,772 --> 01:18:25,147
We collect all the details needed

685
01:18:25,188 --> 01:18:26,355
to identify a person, and keep them in a file.

686
01:18:26,522 --> 01:18:28,105
The file is given a number,

687
01:18:28,147 --> 01:18:30,022
And it's called the SUDHAR number.

688
01:18:30,147 --> 01:18:33,147
As on July 2016, we have issued,

689
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:36,105
over 100 crore SUDHAR numbers.

690
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,605
When compared to other countries,

691
01:18:38,605 --> 01:18:41,605
We rank highest in terms of issuing this unique identity.

692
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:45,188
Unfortunately, all the files

693
01:18:47,188 --> 01:18:48,522
have been stolen.

694
01:18:48,938 --> 01:18:49,827
What?

695
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:51,708
Are you serious?

696
01:18:52,355 --> 01:18:55,063
This is the biggest data theft in the world.

697
01:18:56,355 --> 01:18:57,355
Sir!

698
01:18:58,355 --> 01:19:00,605
It's time for the meeting with ministers

699
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,355
Cancel that meeting,

700
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,480
Don't let anybody come inside. Leave!

701
01:19:12,313 --> 01:19:14,980
Do you know the money government has

702
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:17,355
spent to collect details from everybody?

703
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,813
What do you mean by its stolen?

704
01:19:21,397 --> 01:19:23,480
When I say it's stolen,

705
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:25,438
it's not like we don't have those files with us.

706
01:19:25,772 --> 01:19:26,188
Then?

707
01:19:26,438 --> 01:19:29,480
Data theft means..

708
01:19:32,813 --> 01:19:34,855
These files are called Data.

709
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,647
It is stored in a computer just like in a rack like this.

710
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:42,938
The hacker has taken a copy of all the files

711
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,563
and has stored it somewhere.

712
01:19:44,855 --> 01:19:47,230
Now, since both the informations are same

713
01:19:47,522 --> 01:19:50,647
...We can't differentiate between original and duplicate.

714
01:19:51,022 --> 01:19:52,188
The information in your hand,

715
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,522
and the one in the rack are the same.

716
01:20:00,638 --> 01:20:02,522
How could they steal it

717
01:20:02,522 --> 01:20:03,772
from such a secured infrastructure?

718
01:20:04,147 --> 01:20:06,355
They don't have to physically go and steal it.

719
01:20:06,522 --> 01:20:09,938
They can sit in a room and still steal data.

720
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:11,980
The room could be in a different city,

721
01:20:12,063 --> 01:20:14,085
or even a different country.

722
01:20:14,172 --> 01:20:15,605
How will people believe that somebody

723
01:20:15,647 --> 01:20:17,147
from somewhere has stolen their identity?

724
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,605
These days, we book food and movies online,

725
01:20:20,772 --> 01:20:22,938
Our money transactions are also online.

726
01:20:23,105 --> 01:20:25,438
We book cinema tickets online

727
01:20:25,605 --> 01:20:27,938
When our life is on internet.
It's not surprising

728
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,188
that crime has moved to internet too.

729
01:20:31,272 --> 01:20:33,105
What's the risk if he has the information?

730
01:20:33,188 --> 01:20:34,605
How's it a problem?

731
01:20:34,855 --> 01:20:36,438
We are at a 95% risk.

732
01:20:36,438 --> 01:20:40,313
Global economy is 95% online now.

733
01:20:40,355 --> 01:20:43,813
After demonetization, it will move to a 100%

734
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,605
On the internet, we are not people.

735
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:48,272
We are just information

736
01:20:48,355 --> 01:20:51,022
Let's take my example, my name,

737
01:20:51,022 --> 01:20:53,522
age, my email id, which school did I go to...

738
01:20:53,522 --> 01:20:54,730
...Which college did I go to,

739
01:20:54,772 --> 01:20:55,688
Where do I work..

740
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:56,647
Where is my home?

741
01:20:56,647 --> 01:20:57,813
What is my vehicle number?

742
01:20:57,938 --> 01:20:58,730
Am I a vegetarian?

743
01:20:58,772 --> 01:20:59,855
Am I a meat eater?..

744
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:01,272
How much do I earn?

745
01:21:01,313 --> 01:21:02,313
How much loan have I taken?

746
01:21:02,313 --> 01:21:03,897
My shirt size, my pant size,

747
01:21:03,938 --> 01:21:05,397
Including my boxers' size.

748
01:21:05,438 --> 01:21:07,313
Every tiny detail sits in a file,

749
01:21:07,355 --> 01:21:08,272
inside an online profile.

750
01:21:08,313 --> 01:21:09,980
Not just mine, all of ours.

751
01:21:10,188 --> 01:21:12,647
If a team is interested in collecting it,

752
01:21:12,688 --> 01:21:14,855
there's a team that is interested in buying it.

753
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:18,480
In technical terms, it is called THE BIG DATA.

754
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,147
Flipkart and Amazon, these companies,

755
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,813
use this information and do business.

756
01:21:23,938 --> 01:21:27,980
Collecting and selling of this information
is completely legal.

757
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:31,480
But,with SUDHAR, Government,
to transfer benefits

758
01:21:31,522 --> 01:21:34,563
has linked bank accounts
with the SUDHAR Number

759
01:21:34,563 --> 01:21:35,688
And this is complicated!

760
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:39,188
Imagine a thief has all these details,

761
01:21:39,188 --> 01:21:42,605
and starts stealing just
1 rupee from all the accounts.

762
01:21:42,688 --> 01:21:44,272
We are a population
of 100 crores.

763
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:49,480
A lot of people have saved
their black money elsewhere.

764
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,938
And, for accounts like these,

765
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,480
fingerprints act as passwords.

766
01:21:52,522 --> 01:21:55,230
What if the thief targets the black money holders?

767
01:21:55,563 --> 01:22:00,230
Nobody will complain if a rupee is lost.

768
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:04,980
It's the same with black money holders.

769
01:22:05,855 --> 01:22:08,801
Information is money, it can be stolen,

770
01:22:08,856 --> 01:22:10,938
and once stolen, it can be sold too.

771
01:22:11,355 --> 01:22:13,688
There's a huge market for this on the internet.

772
01:22:17,147 --> 01:22:18,397
What kind of market is this?

773
01:22:18,813 --> 01:22:20,480
This is a very weird market,

774
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,522
Somebody toils, and somebody else reaps benefits.

775
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,938
Our job is to just transport things.

776
01:22:24,938 --> 01:22:27,522
His shaving, her waxing.

777
01:22:27,688 --> 01:22:30,605
Dad pays electricity bill, mom buys vegetables.

778
01:22:31,022 --> 01:22:32,480
Grandfather departing on his final journey.

779
01:22:33,298 --> 01:22:34,938
Grandmother getting admitted in a hospital.

780
01:22:35,266 --> 01:22:36,538
Husband shifts to Dubai,

781
01:22:36,563 --> 01:22:37,647
While wife sits in Mangalore.

782
01:22:37,772 --> 01:22:39,747
They were brought closer

783
01:22:39,772 --> 01:22:42,313
by a small 24 Megapixel web camera.

784
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:44,938
Every bit of their information online,

785
01:22:44,938 --> 01:22:46,313
Brings in money to us.

786
01:22:46,397 --> 01:22:49,188
Try extracting information directly or indirectly,

787
01:22:49,188 --> 01:22:51,230
if it doesn't happen, steal.

788
01:22:51,272 --> 01:22:52,230
Yes Boss!

789
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:54,355
You can't hide anything from us,

790
01:22:54,397 --> 01:22:55,730
we are always watching you.

791
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:45,813
Massager for Back Pain!

792
01:23:46,841 --> 01:23:48,088
Cold packs for back pain.

793
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:46,730
Spray for back pain...

794
01:23:48,105 --> 01:23:50,688
Pain vanishes in a moment

795
01:23:51,438 --> 01:23:54,163
Green Tea for hairloss.

796
01:23:54,188 --> 01:23:58,730
Almond oil! Almond Oil!

797
01:23:58,855 --> 01:24:03,272
Tummy Trimmer!

798
01:24:17,313 --> 01:24:19,397
Make up fanatic!
Skin doctor patient!

799
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,855
Selfie camera customer.

800
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:26,480
People who often eat outside - Gastritis

801
01:24:26,772 --> 01:24:28,522
Soon to visit a cardiologist.

802
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,022
Placed in Chennai,

803
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:31,855
Weekends will be here,
weekdays will be there.

804
01:24:31,897 --> 01:24:33,563
People who travel often,

805
01:24:33,605 --> 01:24:35,147
Also, girls in need of accommodation.

806
01:24:36,355 --> 01:24:37,647
Sunscreen companies,

807
01:24:37,688 --> 01:24:38,647
OK Boss!

808
01:24:39,063 --> 01:24:40,272
Ours is the most secured bank,

809
01:24:40,313 --> 01:24:41,772
Welcome to the family.
Thank you!

810
01:25:06,105 --> 01:25:08,147
I have lost Rs.50000 from my account.

811
01:25:08,563 --> 01:25:09,688
Sangeetha Rajan, come here.

812
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,188
Even I've lost 1 Lakh Rupees.

813
01:25:11,313 --> 01:25:12,855
Listen carefully! It's difficult to catch

814
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:15,557
something that is seen.
This is a lost case.

815
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:19,022
We both sell the same product,

816
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,276
Yet, people buy it from only him?

817
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:24,538
Business is not like selling peanuts.

818
01:25:24,563 --> 01:25:25,980
You should have data.

819
01:25:26,147 --> 01:25:27,272
What is data?

820
01:25:28,355 --> 01:25:29,647
You won't understand if I tell you.

821
01:25:29,813 --> 01:25:31,522
Wait! I'll bring you proper data.

822
01:25:32,915 --> 01:25:35,438
Wait! I'll pay how much ever you want.

823
01:25:35,647 --> 01:25:36,897
Will you take me with you?

824
01:25:37,277 --> 01:25:38,105
I don't want money.

825
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:40,105
Will you give your data?

826
01:25:41,688 --> 01:25:42,605
Okay! I'll give.

827
01:25:42,855 --> 01:25:43,355
Come.

828
01:25:56,188 --> 01:26:00,105
'Information!' 'information!'
'Data!'

829
01:26:17,313 --> 01:26:20,522
This is deep web.
The data we obtain is sold,

830
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:23,647
bought, and exchanged here.

831
01:26:31,022 --> 01:26:34,647
We can get fake passport, visa, driving license,

832
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:38,272
of any country here, and it's as good as original.

833
01:26:41,188 --> 01:26:44,147
All kinds of weapons are available here.

834
01:26:44,188 --> 01:26:49,563
You can buy it like you're
ordering shorts online.

835
01:26:49,563 --> 01:26:51,730
You could get people killed,

836
01:26:55,203 --> 01:26:58,647
nobody will know who did it.

837
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:06,480
Getting high is just a click away.

838
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:18,022
All the pictures you send,

839
01:27:22,355 --> 01:27:24,345
lies naked in front of us.

840
01:27:30,938 --> 01:27:32,313
I cannot let you go beyond this

841
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:33,397
let this one thing go.

842
01:27:33,663 --> 01:27:35,105
What's happening inside?

843
01:27:35,147 --> 01:27:37,355
Listen to me, let this go.

844
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,313
I want to see what's happening.

845
01:27:43,272 --> 01:27:45,357
Not here, come with me.

846
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:55,647
Red room, this is where biddings happen.

847
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,522
These are a bunch of psychos.

848
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,772
This is human experimenting room.

849
01:28:00,897 --> 01:28:05,938
One person kidnaps people
and bring them here.

850
01:28:06,063 --> 01:28:10,522
These people bid to cut the person's
hands, limbs, or wrists.

851
01:28:10,813 --> 01:28:15,855
He executes whatever the
highest bidding is for.

852
01:28:17,813 --> 01:28:21,938
They watch it live and enjoy it.

853
01:28:23,438 --> 01:28:25,272
Another video is streaming live now.

854
01:28:30,813 --> 01:28:40,522
Head! Head! Head! Head! Head!

855
01:28:44,879 --> 01:28:47,338
We are all good by birth,

856
01:28:48,713 --> 01:28:54,296
This system slowly corrupts our ethics.

857
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:58,921
In my 15 years of administration,

858
01:28:58,963 --> 01:29:01,838
Nobody has ever been cheated.

859
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:06,963
It's okay if politicians
lose crores of rupees,

860
01:29:07,796 --> 01:29:17,406
But a normal person shouldn't
lose a single rupee.

861
01:29:19,088 --> 01:29:21,546
Use the entire police force if needed

862
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:25,504
Get the data back at any cost.

863
01:29:26,004 --> 01:29:26,838
Sure Sir!

864
01:29:26,921 --> 01:29:29,296
We have zeroed in on a suspect already.

865
01:29:30,004 --> 01:29:31,004
Hit him more!

866
01:29:31,463 --> 01:29:32,463
Again.

867
01:29:32,879 --> 01:29:33,879
Sir!

868
01:29:36,379 --> 01:29:37,754
Why did you murder her?

869
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:40,004
Talk!

870
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,463
I didn't do it on purpose,

871
01:29:48,504 --> 01:29:52,713
Highest bidding was for murder.

872
01:29:53,629 --> 01:29:54,629
That's why I killed her.

873
01:30:01,463 --> 01:30:02,743
It's been days since the murder.

874
01:30:03,213 --> 01:30:04,493
Why didn't you file a complaint?

875
01:30:05,629 --> 01:30:09,754
I couldn't step out due
to personal problems.

876
01:30:11,213 --> 01:30:14,504
In Visitor's list, apart from Aasthi,

877
01:30:15,046 --> 01:30:16,486
nobody else has entered their names.

878
01:30:17,129 --> 01:30:19,212
How can you be so sure that

879
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:22,338
you saw this person
on the day of murder?

880
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:25,963
- I have seen him visiting the
neighboring flat, - a lot of times.

881
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,372
I saw him on the day of murder too.

882
01:30:29,546 --> 01:30:32,754
Moreover, Aasthi came to my house.

883
01:30:34,171 --> 01:30:35,691
What is your relationship with Aasthi?

884
01:30:36,338 --> 01:30:37,838
We both like eachother.

885
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:40,664
What is he doing now?

886
01:30:40,996 --> 01:30:41,996
I don't know sir.

887
01:30:42,546 --> 01:30:44,464
I met him last on that day.

888
01:30:45,838 --> 01:30:49,546
His phone is switched
off from that day.

889
01:30:50,588 --> 01:30:54,920
Sir! Our inspector is searching
for the other boy right?

890
01:30:54,921 --> 01:30:58,713
When has he ever caught the right person?

891
01:31:03,796 --> 01:31:04,796
Let us start!

892
01:31:16,588 --> 01:31:20,646
The first clue about the
large data movement

893
01:31:20,671 --> 01:31:23,004
pointed towards a training
centre in Bangalore.

894
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:29,563
Data center was attacked
by a virus on August 3rd

895
01:31:29,588 --> 01:31:31,379
From an employee's laptop.

896
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:37,420
This employee faints in a coffee shop
while drinking coffee on August 2nd.

897
01:31:37,421 --> 01:31:39,063
Somebody takes him to the hospital

898
01:31:39,088 --> 01:31:41,692
But, his laptop remains there.

899
01:31:42,088 --> 01:31:44,391
He gets his laptop the next day.

900
01:31:47,296 --> 01:31:49,755
When you connect these dots,

901
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,935
All fingers point towards Alok.

902
01:32:00,088 --> 01:32:01,088
That's it.

903
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:04,375
He must have mixed sedatives in coffee,

904
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,290
and then injected virus in the laptop

905
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:13,864
When the employee connected his laptop to
the data center, the virus was triggered.

906
01:32:20,936 --> 01:32:24,589
What if the employee has
generated this virus?

907
01:32:25,213 --> 01:32:26,933
The technical expertise
of him and the way..

908
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:30,254
This virus has been
designed doesn't match.

909
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:32,963
However, we are interrogating him.

910
01:32:39,588 --> 01:32:41,921
So you're suspecting only Alok.

911
01:32:43,075 --> 01:32:44,659
Any supporting evidences?

912
01:32:45,713 --> 01:32:47,421
There's no evidence.

913
01:32:48,004 --> 01:32:49,146
But once I had fooled him,

914
01:32:49,171 --> 01:32:50,854
and had taken his password.

915
01:32:50,879 --> 01:32:56,657
I searched and found a few
potential clues. That's all!

916
01:32:57,879 --> 01:33:00,729
Stolen data is usually
saved in physical mediums.

917
01:33:00,754 --> 01:33:02,879
Like DVD, Hard drive, CDs.

918
01:33:02,963 --> 01:33:04,272
We've searched his room, workplace,

919
01:33:04,296 --> 01:33:07,254
Coffee shop, training
institute, everywhere..

920
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:08,921
There was nothing.

921
01:33:09,656 --> 01:33:13,253
Then digital mediums, like cloud, drives..

922
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:17,188
And email. I'll start
looking at these things.

923
01:33:17,213 --> 01:33:19,588
Right! Rest of the information
is in these files.

924
01:33:20,921 --> 01:33:21,921
Thank You!

925
01:33:37,796 --> 01:33:40,670
When I started working, her parents..

926
01:33:40,671 --> 01:33:41,991
Had not started working too...

927
01:33:43,421 --> 01:33:44,313
And She makes me stand

928
01:33:44,338 --> 01:33:45,578
outside the door like a dog.

929
01:35:27,296 --> 01:35:29,368
Everything has a price.

930
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:32,234
Nobody will steal something
that is worthless.

931
01:35:33,827 --> 01:35:36,369
You must have stolen something
extremely valuable,

932
01:35:37,484 --> 01:35:39,984
or she wouldn't have
landed here from Delhi.

933
01:35:41,171 --> 01:35:42,171
Tell..

934
01:35:42,514 --> 01:35:43,838
What did you steal?

935
01:35:45,296 --> 01:35:46,296
Avinash!

936
01:35:46,338 --> 01:35:47,338
Stop it now.

937
01:35:51,874 --> 01:35:52,999
Avinash I said enough.

938
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:55,770
Sorry Madam!

939
01:35:56,963 --> 01:35:57,963
I couldn't hear.

940
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,518
He's still saying he
hasn't stolen anything.

941
01:36:02,206 --> 01:36:03,539
Atleast you made him say that.

942
01:36:03,848 --> 01:36:05,223
Great! Now wait outside.

943
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:18,130
I'm sorry to see you like this.

944
01:36:18,796 --> 01:36:21,691
But you're the reason
for your situation.

945
01:36:22,254 --> 01:36:25,462
The sooner you
surrender the data,

946
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:29,713
The better it is for you.
Alok!

947
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:32,963
I don't have any data.

948
01:36:34,629 --> 01:36:39,642
A lot of reasons are forcing
me not to believe it, Alok!

949
01:36:40,713 --> 01:36:42,753
The virus infected laptop ..

950
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:44,922
Was with you, the previous day..

951
01:36:45,588 --> 01:36:47,917
And we have the CCTV footage
to prove it..

952
01:36:49,713 --> 01:36:53,137
No matter how you see this case,

953
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,838
You're right at the very center of it.

954
01:36:57,331 --> 01:36:59,206
You have very minimal choices.

955
01:37:01,034 --> 01:37:02,909
One, you either confess to the crime,

956
01:37:03,504 --> 01:37:05,963
Or, you die here.

957
01:37:07,422 --> 01:37:09,422
A few co-incidences..

958
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:11,777
Will not make me a criminal.

959
01:37:17,088 --> 01:37:18,088
And,

960
01:37:19,004 --> 01:37:20,088
Without any evidence,

961
01:37:21,607 --> 01:37:23,145
You can't keep me in custody..

962
01:37:24,254 --> 01:37:25,989
For long..

963
01:37:26,379 --> 01:37:28,421
Who said that this is police custody?

964
01:37:29,463 --> 01:37:32,296
Nobody knows that you're
in an interrogation.

965
01:37:32,921 --> 01:37:37,644
And, I know that nobody
will come looking for you.

966
01:37:38,379 --> 01:37:41,870
Police records will have
you as a missing person.

967
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:46,296
We search for people who are missing,

968
01:37:47,088 --> 01:37:50,045
not people who are lost.

969
01:37:50,046 --> 01:37:53,130
You always had the choice of a decent life.

970
01:37:53,131 --> 01:37:56,213
You could have done anything.

971
01:37:57,629 --> 01:37:58,909
Why did you do this to yourself?

972
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:05,879
Who wants to know it?

973
01:38:07,254 --> 01:38:10,754
Pooja... or Anagha?

974
01:38:11,171 --> 01:38:14,650
Whatever was done as Pooja is a lie,

975
01:38:15,421 --> 01:38:18,060
If you believe anything in that is true..

976
01:38:18,817 --> 01:38:20,692
Then it's just your imagination.

977
01:38:30,338 --> 01:38:31,963
My parents passed away when I was a kid.

978
01:38:32,713 --> 01:38:33,879
I grew up in an ashram.

979
01:38:35,004 --> 03:17:10,700
I used to study really well.

980
01:38:35,004 --> 01:38:39,713
Mathematics was my favorite subject.

981
01:38:40,968 --> 01:38:43,088
I came to Bangalore for engineering.

982
01:38:43,421 --> 01:38:46,129
I used to be one among
the crowd in my village.

983
01:38:47,379 --> 01:38:52,171
But here, everybody wore
nice clothes, Sneakers.

984
01:38:52,796 --> 01:38:54,556
They would frequent
multiplexes when bored...

985
01:38:54,879 --> 01:38:56,546
Play a game of bowling,

986
01:38:57,913 --> 01:38:59,985
and visit new restaurant every day.

987
01:39:01,214 --> 01:39:03,172
They change phones because they're bored,

988
01:39:03,675 --> 01:39:06,688
and bikes because the
color has begun to fade.

989
01:39:06,713 --> 01:39:11,609
In my eyes, their life was a celebration.

990
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:16,027
But I lead a calculated life.

991
01:39:17,504 --> 01:39:20,944
Never had the courage to look at a menu,
and order food, even if it meant starving.

992
01:39:23,296 --> 01:39:26,696
Clothes and shoes were never in my budget.

993
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:30,504
If I came back from a hospital,

994
01:39:30,879 --> 01:39:32,971
the joy of getting well..
Was clouded

995
01:39:32,996 --> 01:39:35,284
by the fear of
overshooting expenses.

996
01:39:35,546 --> 01:39:38,361
At first, none of these mattered.

997
01:39:39,226 --> 01:39:43,626
But slowly insecurity engulfed me.

998
01:39:47,222 --> 01:39:50,055
That's when Shivani entered my life.

999
01:39:51,171 --> 01:39:52,671
Her father was a rich businessman.

1000
01:39:53,046 --> 01:39:55,671
She was the only daughter.

1001
01:39:57,129 --> 01:39:59,546
And for some reason she liked me a lot.

1002
01:40:00,379 --> 01:40:02,088
She used to take me with her always,

1003
01:40:02,588 --> 01:40:05,671
bought nice clothes,
dined at expensive places.

1004
01:40:06,713 --> 01:40:09,296
The celebration I saw from a distance

1005
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:11,504
now became a part of my life.

1006
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:16,433
Till she was there,
there were no worries.

1007
01:40:17,629 --> 01:40:21,807
Once she left, it would
be the same old life.

1008
01:40:26,796 --> 01:40:30,803
Shivani was not a luxury,

1009
01:40:32,171 --> 01:40:36,129
Shivani was peace of mind.

1010
01:40:41,713 --> 01:40:44,690
That's the difference between
mine and their life.

1011
01:40:45,963 --> 01:40:50,241
They always have a choice between things.

1012
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:55,915
But in my case, I didn't have choice

1013
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:59,370
I had to make do with what I had.

1014
01:40:59,671 --> 01:41:01,879
Even though I worked
harder than all of them,

1015
01:41:03,588 --> 01:41:05,354
I still had no choice

1016
01:41:05,754 --> 01:41:06,754
That's why

1017
01:41:07,504 --> 01:41:10,716
I wanted to bring my life to a stage,
Where I get to choose things,

1018
01:41:12,338 --> 01:41:13,338
and did just that.

1019
01:41:14,754 --> 01:41:17,754
Between right and wrong,
you can choose wrong..

1020
01:41:19,787 --> 01:41:22,387
If the righteous aren't harmed.
And I chose it.

1021
01:41:31,347 --> 01:41:32,888
You didn't arrest me, Anagha!

1022
01:41:34,263 --> 01:41:36,097
It was my choice to come here.

1023
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:46,295
I will choose the duration of my stay too.

1024
01:41:46,296 --> 01:41:47,296
What do you mean?

1025
01:41:48,213 --> 01:41:51,629
I mean, the fact that I'm the thief,

1026
01:41:52,546 --> 01:41:54,379
is just your imagination, Anagha.

1027
01:41:55,713 --> 01:41:57,171
To prove me as the thief

1028
01:41:58,213 --> 01:42:02,799
You need the data, before I leave.

1029
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:09,833
There was no connection
between my college

1030
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,792
degree and the job I
went to after college.

1031
01:42:13,042 --> 01:42:16,208
I made a plan to reach a place in 3 years,

1032
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:21,042
which would otherwise
take 15 years to reach.

1033
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,500
The shortcut to success needed a key,

1034
01:42:27,167 --> 01:42:30,877
I found the key, and even said hello to it.

1035
01:42:37,542 --> 01:42:41,750
I joined the coffee shop
he went to regularly.

1036
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:52,750
Step 1 - Shoulder Surfing

1037
01:42:54,417 --> 01:42:57,792
I had to find out his
login and system passwords.

1038
01:43:11,167 --> 01:43:14,542
Tables on this side are reserved,

1039
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:17,083
If you don't mind, can you
sit on the last table?

1040
01:43:17,195 --> 01:43:18,375
Okay, Sure!

1041
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:19,667
Thank You!

1042
01:44:02,458 --> 01:44:04,594
I got all the passwords,

1043
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:06,500
to enter data center's network.

1044
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:13,458
Step 2 - I had to get his laptop

1045
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:19,333
Step 3

1046
01:44:20,917 --> 01:44:22,000
Injecting the worm.

1047
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:44,417
Excuse me, My laptop was here yesterday

1048
01:44:44,583 --> 01:44:46,417
Don't worry, I've kept it safe.

1049
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:09,625
It was perfect till here,

1050
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,083
Then you came into my life.

1051
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:15,333
If you can guess my date of birth,
I'll give you a surprise.

1052
01:45:17,542 --> 01:45:20,292
Thanks for asking that question.

1053
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,042
Pooja, the love of my life.

1054
01:45:42,083 --> 01:45:45,000
Her real name was Anagha.

1055
01:45:52,917 --> 01:45:54,750
When everything was going smooth,

1056
01:45:55,292 --> 01:45:56,958
Police started tracking me.

1057
01:45:57,042 --> 01:45:58,875
What are you doing here?

1058
01:45:58,917 --> 01:45:59,750
Come to the police station.

1059
01:45:59,917 --> 01:46:01,292
Why Sir? There are 3 new cases,

1060
01:46:01,333 --> 01:46:03,042
one of them has to be yours.

1061
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:09,792
There was no point running away.

1062
01:46:11,696 --> 01:46:13,083
There's a surprise for you in the room.

1063
01:46:17,167 --> 01:46:17,792
Love you Anu!

1064
01:46:18,542 --> 01:46:21,417
I thought I'll stay,
right in front of you all.

1065
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,042
And even if you realize
that I'm the thief...

1066
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:27,667
They should be helpless to do anything.

1067
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:36,833
Let the fun begin.

1068
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:39,500
How did he find out that I am a police?

1069
01:46:39,777 --> 01:46:42,142
Phaneesh! If you were the criminal,

1070
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:44,000
where would you hide the data?

1071
01:46:46,417 --> 01:46:49,333
I would never keep it in
my personal computer.

1072
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:51,458
Physical hard drive? No way.

1073
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:53,542
Workplace. . Definitely not.

1074
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:56,600
Friend, I would probably keep it with a friend.

1075
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:59,667
Yes, a friend of his worked at an internet cafe.

1076
01:46:59,667 --> 01:47:00,208
You should check it out.

1077
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,250
Yes!... Ramesh!?

1078
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:05,000
Ramesh! Go to the internet cafe,

1079
01:47:05,042 --> 01:47:06,917
seize all the computers and bring them.

1080
01:47:07,281 --> 01:47:07,833
Ok Madam!

1081
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,500
Anagha, there's one more
place we should check.

1082
01:47:10,917 --> 01:47:11,250
Where?

1083
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:11,625
Come.

1084
01:47:45,708 --> 01:47:47,183
Hey! She's a police.

1085
01:47:47,208 --> 01:47:48,958
Police? Run, run.

1086
01:47:55,042 --> 01:47:56,542
Will you arrest god now?

1087
01:47:56,667 --> 01:47:58,892
Have any important CDs arrived?

1088
01:47:58,917 --> 01:48:00,662
In the last 2 months?
or 2 weeks ago?

1089
01:48:00,792 --> 01:48:01,792
Foreign or Indian?

1090
01:48:01,917 --> 01:48:02,958
Not that,

1091
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,417
the one with important information.

1092
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,417
I have run the data sniffer program,
and web crawler bots.

1093
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:23,208
In case there's any data resemblance,
We will get immediate information.

1094
01:48:23,917 --> 01:48:25,060
I'm trying.

1095
01:48:31,042 --> 01:48:35,167
From August 4th till the
day he got arrested.

1096
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:37,167
Check his phone network.

1097
01:48:37,542 --> 01:48:40,058
Go to each internet cafe
in all areas,his phone

1098
01:48:40,083 --> 01:48:42,458
network shows, and check
if he has logged in.

1099
01:48:42,792 --> 01:48:45,000
He must have given his ID proof,
you'll easily know.

1100
01:48:45,292 --> 01:48:48,292
I want all the systems
that he has used.

1101
01:48:48,417 --> 01:48:49,625
Seize everything and get it to the station.

1102
01:49:00,625 --> 01:49:03,167
Move, don't leave things,
get everything and come.

1103
01:49:03,208 --> 01:49:05,083
Sir please sir,
what are you doing sir?

1104
01:49:05,167 --> 01:49:06,750
Bro! Police have come.

1105
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:08,625
Sir, that's a TV.

1106
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:13,833
They've taken away all our PCs.
Come soon.

1107
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:24,333
Any leads?

1108
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:24,833
No.

1109
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:29,208
Apart from a few movies on torrents,
he hasn't uploaded anything else.

1110
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:31,863
Anagha, is there a movie called,

1111
01:49:31,888 --> 01:49:34,292
Dawn of the bedsheets?

1112
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:36,750
I don't watch Kannada movies.

1113
01:49:40,583 --> 01:49:41,625
Tomato Pushpa,

1114
01:49:41,667 --> 01:49:44,500
seed in the morning, ripe at night.

1115
01:49:45,417 --> 01:49:47,375
This is why I don't watch Kannada movies.

1116
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:00,875
It's okay if you don't watch any movies.

1117
01:50:00,875 --> 01:50:03,125
There's this movie called
Gultoo, you should watch it.

1118
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:03,625
What?

1119
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:04,417
Come soon.

1120
01:50:12,583 --> 01:50:15,568
Your photos, videos,
voice notes...

1121
01:50:15,667 --> 01:50:18,375
He's mashed everything into a
video, and uploaded it on torrents.

1122
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,292
But why should one upload this to torrents?

1123
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:21,500
I have no idea. 'Sir'!

1124
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:22,250
Yes tell me Ramesh!

1125
01:50:22,292 --> 01:50:23,375
Sir, we have brought the computers.

1126
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,250
Yes, get it inside.

1127
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:27,792
If we get it here, the
entire office will be full.

1128
01:50:28,583 --> 01:50:29,708
What are you saying Ramesh?

1129
01:50:29,917 --> 01:50:30,708
Come show it to me.

1130
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:50,417
Oh God! So many computers?

1131
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:51,285
Yes Sir!

1132
01:50:52,583 --> 01:50:53,828
For his peace of mind,

1133
01:50:53,853 --> 01:50:55,458
he's spoiling our peace of mind.

1134
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,217
Avinash!

1135
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:14,317
Avinash!

1136
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:23,924
Why do you always wait
outside like a dog?

1137
01:51:37,125 --> 01:51:39,708
Sit down
I need to talk to you.

1138
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:55,042
If there's a price for everything,

1139
01:51:55,958 --> 01:51:57,333
Then you must have a price too.

1140
01:51:58,958 --> 01:52:01,417
I'll pay you the kind
of money that you

1141
01:52:02,186 --> 01:52:03,402
have never seen in your life.

1142
01:52:04,625 --> 01:52:06,152
If you do what I say.

1143
01:52:07,042 --> 01:52:08,000
What should I do?

1144
01:52:08,833 --> 01:52:13,125
CH100-00-2300-A10

1145
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:17,958
Tell this number to the person I tell you.

1146
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:22,250
What should I do after that?

1147
01:52:23,917 --> 01:52:25,577
You don't have to do
anything after that,

1148
01:52:26,458 --> 01:52:28,190
they will come running towards me.

1149
01:53:00,167 --> 01:53:02,208
How do you know the
account number?

1150
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,667
It's okay if I just
knew about the account.

1151
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:08,500
But I know that it has
two thousand crores.

1152
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:10,078
Who are you?

1153
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:14,042
The cleanest
politician in state,

1154
01:53:15,458 --> 01:53:17,958
has hidden away, 2000 crores with him.

1155
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:19,708
Leave that,

1156
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:22,500
Come to the topic.

1157
01:53:24,125 --> 01:53:25,208
Tell what do you want?

1158
01:53:25,542 --> 01:53:29,081
A few years ago, An Italian,
stole client details of..

1159
01:53:29,106 --> 01:53:32,351
Over a lakh and a half
people from the Swiss bank.

1160
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:37,042
4000 accounts belonged to Indians.

1161
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:41,333
He wanted finger prints of these people.

1162
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,368
Yours included.

1163
01:53:46,792 --> 01:53:48,895
I don't know what his profit in it is.

1164
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:54,909
But he offered me an exorbitant sum
for these finger prints.

1165
01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:59,792
If you want your fingerprints
to not reach him,

1166
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,458
then you have to save
me from this case.

1167
01:54:08,458 --> 01:54:12,667
I have worn khadi to hide
the blood on my hands.

1168
01:54:13,625 --> 01:54:15,958
I haven't started politics now...

1169
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,292
Politics has always been in my blood.

1170
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,583
I've tamed many people like you,

1171
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:25,750
and ruled the state for 15 years.

1172
01:54:27,792 --> 01:54:30,167
Nobody has a whiff of
the things I've done.

1173
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:35,558
You're trying to
threaten me in my zone,

1174
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:39,167
especially when you're
in my police custody.

1175
01:54:43,417 --> 01:54:48,570
I've made you come all the way,
While I sat in your police custody, Sir!

1176
01:54:51,167 --> 01:54:54,125
A bait attracts both, a
small fish and a shark,

1177
01:54:54,583 --> 01:54:57,125
People on the shore will
never know what it is.

1178
01:54:58,333 --> 01:55:01,625
If I kill you here,

1179
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:03,583
Then our police,

1180
01:55:04,167 --> 01:55:07,208
and the Italian guy will
never get any fingerprints.

1181
01:55:35,333 --> 01:55:37,804
Sir, Sir!

1182
01:55:38,083 --> 01:55:39,683
Your government will collapse,

1183
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:40,750
even if you kill me here today.

1184
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:44,000
Tomorrow midnight all the 20 videos..

1185
01:55:44,042 --> 01:55:45,875
I've recorded, will go live on youtube.

1186
01:55:46,917 --> 01:55:50,208
Media and press will
receive a mail.

1187
01:55:50,667 --> 01:55:54,375
That has all your black money
and transaction details.

1188
01:55:56,625 --> 01:56:00,700
I came to the custody after
everything was planned.

1189
01:56:02,375 --> 01:56:04,542
You don't have much time.

1190
01:56:06,083 --> 01:56:08,250
If I don't get out by tomorrow...

1191
01:56:09,833 --> 01:56:12,347
Your government will definitely collapse.

1192
01:56:19,708 --> 01:56:22,125
You said he was being
interrogated secretly.

1193
01:56:23,125 --> 01:56:24,376
How will you produce him to court?

1194
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:29,904
How will you produce him before court?

1195
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:32,583
I'll do something!

1196
01:56:33,472 --> 01:56:34,840
I'll do it.

1197
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,708
Take this, it has to
become big news tomorrow.

1198
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:43,500
So big, that it has to reach Delhi.

1199
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,042
Okay Sir!

1200
01:56:44,292 --> 01:56:47,500
Front page is already being printed.

1201
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:49,208
It will cost you a lot.

1202
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:55,000
How can I say no to you, madam!

1203
01:56:55,625 --> 01:56:56,708
I will get it done.

1204
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,250
Hello!

1205
01:57:00,417 --> 01:57:01,667
Coming sir!

1206
01:57:02,833 --> 01:57:03,500
Where you are going?

1207
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:05,250
Baby, give me 15 minutes.

1208
01:57:05,708 --> 01:57:07,542
I'll come back soon.

1209
01:57:09,542 --> 01:57:13,978
Government informer is saying
that SUDHAR card details have been stolen.

1210
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:15,833
This will be the top news.

1211
01:57:16,208 --> 01:57:17,750
Now everybody is screwed.

1212
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,125
Mandatorily

1213
01:57:19,667 --> 01:57:21,083
Come let's update it right away.

1214
01:57:36,599 --> 01:57:37,475
Stop the printing now!

1215
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,667
We'll have to change the headlines.

1216
01:57:42,625 --> 01:57:44,795
Dude I'll give you some awesome scoop,

1217
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:45,708
to make memes.

1218
01:57:45,833 --> 01:57:48,600
A cyber crime that has shocked the country,

1219
01:57:48,625 --> 01:57:49,875
was committed in Namma Bengaluru.

1220
01:57:50,042 --> 01:57:53,625
Over 80 crore SUDHAR numbers
have been leaked.

1221
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:55,265
Oh My God!

1222
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:56,458
This is killer news.

1223
01:57:56,917 --> 01:57:59,833
Internet is not just entertainment.

1224
01:58:00,125 --> 01:58:01,625
It is a gold mine of information.

1225
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:04,292
If you don't listen to what I say,

1226
01:58:04,317 --> 01:58:06,292
Then I'll thrash you badly.

1227
01:58:06,333 --> 01:58:07,083
What are you doing?

1228
01:58:07,125 --> 01:58:08,292
Sir, Facebook live.

1229
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:09,292
Whatever it is that you're doing,

1230
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:10,292
Go home and do it.

1231
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,167
Bofors scam, 2G scam, had
already rocked our worlds,

1232
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:18,542
Now they've reached for
our fingerprints too.

1233
01:58:18,542 --> 01:58:19,833
Guys comment now.

1234
01:58:19,875 --> 01:58:21,833
Every word you write has a price,

1235
01:58:22,292 --> 01:58:23,043
Here keep this.

1236
01:58:23,958 --> 01:58:25,500
I don't write false news.

1237
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:30,727
If it is the truth, then I
don't need money to write it.

1238
01:58:32,029 --> 01:58:33,229
You can leave now.

1239
01:58:34,417 --> 01:58:38,802
Central Government opposed
Supreme Court decision

1240
01:58:38,827 --> 01:58:41,458
to enable SUDHAR, now
stands embarrassed.

1241
01:58:42,955 --> 01:59:14,000
*Breaking News Montage*

1242
01:59:15,083 --> 01:59:17,000
Do you have any idea of the
seriousness of this issue?

1243
01:59:17,083 --> 01:59:19,458
Sir! I don't know how
media picked this up.

1244
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:20,542
I'm really sorry,

1245
01:59:20,583 --> 01:59:21,375
Just stop it Anagha!

1246
01:59:21,792 --> 01:59:22,667
If I go down,

1247
01:59:22,875 --> 01:59:24,458
I promise to take everyone down with me.

1248
01:59:25,792 --> 01:59:26,292
Sir!

1249
01:59:28,792 --> 01:59:33,083
You made a circus out
of a small case.

1250
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:35,288
Sorry Sir!

1251
01:59:35,958 --> 01:59:36,788
Useless fellow.

1252
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:37,875
Leave.

1253
01:59:45,395 --> 01:59:47,341
Call Ananth.

1254
01:59:59,125 --> 01:59:59,750
Hello! Namaste!

1255
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,334
One minute.

1256
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:10,143
Yes sir!

1257
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:17,667
It's better if we
don't accept this,

1258
02:00:18,079 --> 02:00:18,508
Yes.

1259
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:21,758
Supreme Court is already
tailing us closely.

1260
02:00:25,208 --> 02:00:29,000
Don't worry, I'll handle things here.

1261
02:00:30,417 --> 02:00:35,042
Yes! Thank you!

1262
02:00:52,375 --> 02:01:00,433
There is no evidence against accused,

1263
02:01:00,458 --> 02:01:05,058
Hence the court orders to release them.

1264
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:12,375
Our heart wishes for
a lot of things,

1265
02:01:14,792 --> 02:01:20,567
as we grow, we are so
engrossed in life...

1266
02:01:22,167 --> 02:01:26,500
There's no place
for these wishes.

1267
02:01:27,527 --> 02:01:28,110
Anagha!

1268
02:01:30,708 --> 02:01:31,917
In all these days,

1269
02:01:31,917 --> 02:01:33,448
Didn't you love me at least once?

1270
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,750
I will never love a criminal.

1271
02:01:36,583 --> 02:01:39,167
Your court has decided that I am innocent.

1272
02:01:39,708 --> 02:01:41,394
The court may have said it,

1273
02:01:41,419 --> 02:01:43,037
but that doesn't prove that
you're not a criminal.

1274
02:01:47,217 --> 02:01:48,019
Isn't it?

1275
02:01:49,333 --> 02:01:51,083
We both know the truth.

1276
02:01:51,625 --> 02:01:55,125
All your sincerity has given
you nothing but loss.

1277
02:01:55,833 --> 02:01:56,750
Aasthi!

1278
02:02:02,484 --> 02:02:04,458
Life is not fair to everyone, Anagha!

1279
02:02:06,583 --> 02:02:07,557
So..

1280
02:02:11,167 --> 02:02:13,761
It's not necessary that you
should be fair to life too.

1281
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:20,375
Giving those wishes a place in our heart,

1282
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:23,458
and chasing them..

1283
02:02:25,292 --> 02:02:28,375
...is a choice we always have.

1284
02:02:30,875 --> 02:02:31,058
Aasthi!

1285
02:02:31,083 --> 02:02:31,750
Don't touch me.

1286
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:33,708
There are wounds everywhere.

1287
02:02:34,708 --> 02:02:35,333
I'm done.

1288
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,190
Aasthi!

1289
02:02:40,841 --> 02:02:43,543
These wounds tell where we came from

1290
02:02:44,170 --> 02:02:46,103
not where we are going next.

1291
02:02:47,958 --> 02:02:51,669
One crore for this,
one crore for that..

1292
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:54,547
Altogether, a 100 crores.

1293
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:55,500
100 crores?

1294
02:02:56,112 --> 02:02:56,453
Yes!

1295
02:02:56,583 --> 02:02:57,183
Really?

1296
02:02:57,662 --> 02:02:59,267
Yesterday we were almost killed.

1297
02:02:59,292 --> 02:03:00,725
Today, you're talking about 100 crores

1298
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:03,294
I don't know if you're a hero or villain.

1299
02:03:04,417 --> 02:03:05,090
Come!

1300
02:03:06,708 --> 02:03:07,833
I am not a hero to anybody.

1301
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,833
I thought it's okay
to commit a crime.

1302
02:03:14,958 --> 02:03:16,417
If a right man doesn't
lose anything.

1303
02:03:19,917 --> 02:03:20,805
I did it too.

1304
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:26,292
SUDHAR policy has helped
a lot of poor people.

1305
02:03:26,917 --> 02:03:31,750
Their money is going straight
into their accounts.

1306
02:03:32,792 --> 02:03:35,350
The security of such policy is being

1307
02:03:35,375 --> 02:03:39,000
monitored with utmost importance.

1308
02:03:39,025 --> 02:03:40,042
So...

1309
02:03:41,208 --> 02:03:44,750
Our fingerprints are all safe with us.
Don't worry about it.

1310
02:03:46,625 --> 02:03:47,333
Don't worry.

1311
02:03:47,982 --> 02:03:48,815
Hey Man!

1312
02:03:49,167 --> 02:03:50,908
Did you get the stuff
I asked you for?

1313
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,709
Yes.

1314
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:53,583
It's safe.

1315
02:03:54,083 --> 02:03:54,701
Don't worry.

1316
02:03:56,792 --> 02:03:57,566
Where is it?

1317
02:03:58,292 --> 02:03:59,639
Send me the money you promised.

1318
02:03:59,710 --> 02:04:01,162
I will. No problem.

1319
02:04:01,187 --> 02:04:02,583
But, what about the cops?

1320
02:04:04,875 --> 02:04:06,292
My startup needs an investor.

1321
02:04:07,625 --> 02:04:08,375
Do the honours..

1322
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:10,625
And, I'll tell you where the data is..

1323
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,125
Anything for the data. Anything.

1324
02:04:13,667 --> 02:04:15,125
Tell me how can I
get my hands on it.

1325
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:17,250
Look for Gultoo Kannada
movie on torrents.

1326
02:04:19,792 --> 02:04:21,208
This is not something
to be happy about.

1327
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:23,000
But, we have found the data finally.

1328
02:04:23,917 --> 02:04:25,292
In that GULTOO video,

1329
02:04:25,375 --> 02:04:27,542
He had hidden the data,
and encrypted it.

1330
02:04:28,542 --> 02:04:29,875
All these are Steganograph media.

1331
02:04:30,375 --> 02:04:32,458
It's difficult to
decrypt without the key

1332
02:04:33,167 --> 02:04:33,833
But Phaneesh!

1333
02:04:34,375 --> 02:04:36,917
Isn't this enough to file
charges against him?

1334
02:04:37,875 --> 02:04:41,208
But, that the file has been
uploaded on torrents..

1335
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:42,542
Is from your E-mail ID!

1336
02:04:46,602 --> 02:04:51,042
It's a crime that hasn't
hurt the righteous.

1337
02:05:20,042 --> 02:05:21,667
I'm not a hero for anybody.

1338
02:05:24,125 --> 02:05:25,375
I'm a hero for myself.

1339
02:05:34,945 --> 02:05:38,382
I'm an accused not a convict.
I'll definitely come back.

1340
02:05:45,167 --> 02:05:47,792
Before you decide if I'm
a good person or not,

1341
02:05:49,042 --> 02:05:50,417
I'll be done running.

1342
02:05:52,083 --> 02:05:52,958
Now..

1343
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,212
The time to chase
dreams is now yours.

1344
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,625
Chase your dreams. Stay Hungry.
Stay Foolish.
