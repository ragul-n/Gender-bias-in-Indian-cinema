00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:02,026
We spent our lives playing
and roaming around, like a bunch of kids.

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,734
Suddenly,
it feels like a decade has passed.

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,734
I feel like a man.

4
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,901
Anything can happen.

5
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:15,859
But whatever happens, I have
confidence within that I can handle it.

It's a bullet wound.

00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:04,359
We came for the police verification.

12
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:11,692
I can give you anything.
There is nothing to worry.

13
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:12,984
Who is it?

14
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:24,234
-Okay! Okay! forgive me!
-No, you are a scoundrel!

15
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,525
-It's not that¦
-It's your fault!

16
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,734
Now leave it.

17
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:32,726
No, you're such an idiot!

00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,214

-Nathuram...
-Anamika!

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,817
We're not cops.
We're not thugs or gangsters either.

22
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:17,525
We've never encountered violence
in our lives before.

23
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,500
Someone messed up with===
sister I bashed him up.

24
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,217
It was just a minor scuffle.

25
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,097
There is no other
chance to happen it again.

26
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:25,913
I thought like everyone else.

27
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:29,359
But then, life is full of surprises.
Anything can happen in life.

28
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,901
But when it happens...

29
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,442
The question is...
are we ready to face it or not?

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,404

She is very upset.

33
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,415
He followed her all the way to the
college and give her the love letter.

34
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,412
He is behaving like a mad guy.

35
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,119
Why do you try to maintain decency?

36
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:54,765
-You know where his house is right?
-I know.

37
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,217
-Giri, get the vehicle.
-come.

38
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,833
Hey!
Why are you behaving like ruffians?

39
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:00,510
-Come.
-Come. Let’s go!

40
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:04,905
Listen, you must be patient.
First, let's lure him out.

41
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,200
-Dude, is that the house?
-Yeah.

42
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,399
Hello brother, just a minute.

43
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:12,479
Come here.

44
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,496
Come here for a minute.

45
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,256
Your approach is wrong.

46
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,223
Not only approach,
your thinking too is wrong.

47
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,927
But, I am not here to correct you.

48
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,839
I am here just to tell you that
what you've done is wrong.

49
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,102
-You idiot!
-Hey.

50
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,356
Hey!

51

She doesn’t like you.

Giving love letters,

00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:41,154
waiting at the college, tailing her
was ended with the film 'Shiva'.

54
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:42,976
Even his son has become a hero now.

55
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:44,568
You know that well.

56
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,031
Hey.

57
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,488
What about you dude?

58
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,814
-I'll wait at the corner.
-Thanks a lot. Buddy.

59
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,868
-Come soon and don't get much involved.
-Just ten minutes.

60
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:05,366
Hey!

00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,483
-Hi Divya! No one is there in home right?
-Careful!

62
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:08,623
-Bye dude.
- No.

63
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:12,135
I understood that they've
seen me coming daily with Mahesh.

64
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:14,166
Oh!
[tires screeching]

65
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:19,458
Like a Mani Ratnam's film,
I saw four silhouettes in the dark.

66
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:22,641
I knew that there was
something dangerous.

67
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:25,019
Not me but for them.

68
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:26,504
Hey dude!

69
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,323
I was a little scared.

70
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:32,079
But some strange feeling
and courage from within.

71
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,212
A confidence that
I can handle the situation.

72
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,972
I'm not allowed to hit on your sister,

73
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:41,987
but its okay for you to come to
our area and romance our girls?

74
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:45,747
You're right…

75
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,149
But it's not we both but it's just him.

76
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:51,022
Mine is just pick up and drop service.
That's all.

77
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,683
I'll come to your house tomorrow
and see about your sister then.

78
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,492
No, enough you beat me and I beat you.

79
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,186
Exactly,
six punches and six blows dude!

80
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,480
I beat them with power in every punch.

81
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:09,870
None of them could get up.

82
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:28,201
Hey.

83
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,544
You're still not done?
Aren't you finished yet?

84
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:33,520
It's turning into a big fight!
Get here soon, man.

85
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:38,814
-What's the matter?
-Shut up and get on the bike.

86
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:41,055
-Did you hit everyone?
-You can't see Divya anymore.

87
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,409
-I'll not go to Divya's house again.
-Hey get on fast man!

88
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:44,555
-Why did you hit them?
-I came for you and they involved me.

89
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:50,785
Someday after my marriage,
I'll tell my son.

90
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,006
Dear son, when a gang came to beat me,

91
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:58,115
I'll tell him proudly that I bashed
them with just six punches.

92
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,127
-Hey catch it!
- Hey! Hey!

93
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:00,960
-Hey!
-Give it here!

94
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,788
-Throw! Throw!
-Hey here!

95
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,052
Dude, I understood that I can handle
such a situation if it arises again.

96
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,933
-I got confidence.
-Ok.

97
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,850
This confidence is important
to survive in the life.

98
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,019
Hey! It's too expensive.

99
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,131
I'm okay with it, dude.
I have Divya to pay for me.

100
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,138
It may be too much for you.

101
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:23,394
-Hi.
-This girl looks good.

102
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,007
I think I know her.

103
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,709
See. I'll tell Divya about this.

104
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:32,237
-You are finished.
-Hey no!

105
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:33,687
I was scouting for you, man.

106
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,491
It doesn't make me feel good
seeing you single.

107
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,615
Do you know how guilty I felt
whenever I spend time with Divya?

108
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:47,849
Cause you're all alone
and I'm happy sleeping on her lap.

109
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:48,545
Stop it.

110
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:54,667
Love... Girls... to handle all these
you must have something in you.

111
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:57,592
-A confidence of a different level.
-True dude.

112
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,497
I feel it's better not having them in me.

113
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,863
-I can be as a good boy for some time.
-Like you?

114
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,271
I don't have that kind
of confidence at all.

115
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:10,172
-Honestly, I am a nice guy.
-I know! I'm seeing you since childhood.

116
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:11,345
You continue.

117
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:16,723
I thought I knew everything about girls,
since I've two sisters at home.

118
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,074
-Is it?
-I thought they are easy to understand.

119
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,027
But no, I know nothing about them.

120
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:24,996
-What you have said now is correct dude.
-Meanwhile, how do you manage?

121
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,577
-You see...
-Got it.

122
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,527
That means there is only action but
no dialogues in between you guys.

123
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,655
That’s it.
[chuckles]

124
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:32,536
Stop it dude.

125
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:36,602
Flashback.

126
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:38,705
Now, back to Sukanya…

127
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:39,956
His second love…

128
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,046
You didn't even hold my hand.

129
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:46,101
It’s easier for you to forget me
than for me to love you again.

130
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:47,207
-Sukanya!
-This is over.

131
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:49,020
Suddenly do not do like that.
- That was an original dialogue!

132
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,252
-She was just 16 years old.
-I thought to behave like a nice boy.

133
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:53,953
Because he didn't hold her hand.

134
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:57,541
Next, Mallika…
His third love.

135
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:01,574
She was from my college.
She said she liked me.

136
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:03,719
And I never let go of her hand.

137
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,775
Tried some other stuff too.

138
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,086
Leave me.

139
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,526
And she dumped me for the same reason.

140
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:17,893
How dare you?
I thought you're a decent guy.

141
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,409
You disappointed me.

142
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:23,791
-Please leave me.
- Mallika, please.

143
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,686
I will just hold your hand
for the next time.

144
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:28,361
One says that I should hold her
hand while the other says no.

145
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:30,778
Then I understood one thing.

146
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,831
Love should come searching for you.

147
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:37,328
I should turn your life topsy-turvy.

148
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:41,088
You shouldn't even know
when you fell in love.

149
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:44,226
The day will come.
Someday it will definitely happen.

150
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:46,978
Anyway,
I have my first love till then.

151
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,506
-Yeah, dude...
-By the way, She'll be here tomorrow.

152
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,080
Finally, Superb man!

153
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,645
-It's hard to meet you after it arrives.
- Hey! Hang on.. hang on!

154
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:54,803
Who is your first love?

155
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,026
My Royal Enfield.
Always my first love.

156
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,637

00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,108
"My bike is enough to me."

174
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,629
-"It's enough."
-"Why... why... why?"

175
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:31,918
Why dude?

176
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:36,502
"Why man? Superb bike bro. Will you
flirt the girls by showing this?"

177
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,750
"What are doing here when
the girls are at that side?"

178
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,535
"Hey! Freak the mic, rock
the high. My rocky boy! Go."

179
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,711
"Listen to the matter behind my words."

180
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,158
"All you see and feel, aren't your own,
In my ride, my dreams are all mine."

181
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:50,606
"My bike is my armour."

182
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:53,022
"Don't try to follow,
you'll get exhausted."

183
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,680
"Shokilla... Shokilla... Shokilla..."

184
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,453
"If you did all the stunts
and if everything failed."

185
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,197
"I am that Shokilla."

186
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,182
"Shokilla... Shokilla... Shokilla..."

187
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:09,918
"If you did all the stunts
and if everything failed."

188
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:11,694
"I am that Shokilla."

189
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:21,038
"This cold breezer is flowing."

190
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,239
"If we show the beauty,
will Shokilla fall in love?"

191
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,895
"We, the handsome boys
came to disturb the girls."

192
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:29,089
"It's a celebration with the
girls if you obey Shokilla, yo!"

193
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:31,383
"If not, you'll fly solo."

194
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,991
"Club like a king, like
a walk with a queen."

195
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:36,103
"By holding her tight."

196
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:37,708
"We caught a beautiful girl."

197
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,025
"Keep them in limits."

198
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,662
"I am that Shokila."

199
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,975
"There ain't any flat tyres in love,
what about your bike though?"

200
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:54,599
"My bike may get punctured
but it'll never be a torture."

201
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:59,030
"Get a kiss by sleeping on her lap."

202
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:03,687
"Switch to top-gear and increase
your pleasure."

203
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,921
"A bike can help me get the chicks."

204
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,929
"Could a girl ever get me a bike?"

205
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,519
"Chicks we don't care
bike is the game."

206
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:21,399
"Chicks we don't care
bike is the game."

207
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,950
"Your gait and sway leave me clueless."

208
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:26,208
"Your mesmerising gaze
drives boys sleepless."

209
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:32,528
"When he sees the curves of your hips,
the boy falls head over heels."

210
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,760
"We're young, we know every trick,
But we still fall prey to your magic."

211
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:38,207
"I've seen your beauty and grace
Every single time, I go into a daze."

212
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:40,541
"I got enchanted by your bold glamour,
And oh boy, I fell hook, line and sinker"

213
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,593
"Shokilla... Shokilla... Shokilla..."

214
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:47,410
"If you did all the stunts
and if everything failed."

215
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,145
"I am that Shokila."

216
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:54,547
"Dude, my bike is the roaring lion."

217
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:59,523
"Don't ever mess with my bike that can
give you a hard competition, leave now."

218
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,159
"Shokilla wants to ride again,
yearning for a second time."

219
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,362
"Shokilla is trapped by your moves,
He's crazy in love."

220
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,242
"Shokilla wants to ride again,
Yearning for a second time."

221
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:22,251
"Shokilla is trapped by your moves,
He's crazy in love."

222
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,625
-Leela...
-Who is it, dude?

223
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:45,922
-She's Maitreyi's friend it seems.
-Oh!

224
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,706
Hey! Isn't our rules!

225
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,625
-Our sisters are sisters to all of us.
- Yes.

226
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,642
But our sister's friend is
not our sister right?

227
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:54,936
That's a point bro.

228
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:56,996
If friend's sisters are our sisters

229
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,981
and if we treat sister's
friends as our sisters,

230
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,636
then the whole world will be our
sisters and we remain single.

231
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,536
So dude,
let's change the rules accordingly.

232
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,143
-Am I right?
- Are you experienced?

233
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:21,824
I just covered up in the nick of time.

234
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,540
Shucks!
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,706
I need to use the bath room.

236
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,422
Maitreyi said that this was her room.

237
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,858
Oh!
Yeah okay.

238
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:37,689
I looked in the mirror for half an hour,
after she left.

239
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,018
More than the fact that she
had seen me like this,

240
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:44,247
I worried more about whether
she liked it or not.

241
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:49,924
-This is my friend, Leela.
-Hi.

242
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:52,132
You've met the others?
Leela, my brother...

243
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,844
Yeah, we just met.

244
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:55,886
Do you want to eat anything?
Want some 'Bajji'?

245
00:15:56,487 --> 00:16:00,205
-Or will you have some hot milk?
- Mom! Milk? When did I drink milk?

246
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:01,998
Give me that plate.
I'll eat 'Bajji'.

247
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:05,399
Will you have 'Bajji'?

248
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:12,060
Though,
my sister's friends keep visiting.

249
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,987
But this girl bowled me over.

250
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:20,668
Bro, she looks amazing!

251
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:22,833
How do I tell you?

252
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,148
She is different.

253
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:28,003
With the thought that she would
look at me or not,

254
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:29,464
right here..

255
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:35,161
...heat started between the
gap of hair and the collar.

256
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:40,192
Bye.

257
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,347
-Bye.
-So tomorrow at 4:00? Okay.

258
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,416
-Bye.
-See you. Bye.

259
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,675
Seems like all your friends had left.

260
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:04,592
Hey!
Isn't she beautiful?

261
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:05,792
What?

262
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,634
Did you look at her properly or not?

263
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,925
Who?

264
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,634
Cut the act.
I'm talking about Leela.

265
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,181
Oh.. she!

266
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,175
Hey!
Isn't she beautiful?

267
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:20,994
-Shall I tell you the truth?
-Yes.

268
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,133
Why didn't you bring her home earlier?

269
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:29,448
Why didn't you introduce her to me?
My God!

270
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,675
I've heard you girls saying "Leela this",
"Leela that",

271
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,258
but you never mentioned that
she looks so beautiful.

272
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,008
I didn't want to distract
you from studies.

273
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,592
-Already you've backlogs.
-That's rubbish.

274
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,230
If you would've introduced me
to her in my final Year,

275
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,735
I'd have graduated first
Class with no backlogs.

276
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,799
I'd have gotten my degree in June.

277
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,758
She is not a distraction.

278
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,592
She is an inspiration.

279
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,883
She's Leela Joseph.

280
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,716
From Alleppy, Kerala.

281
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:55,133
What?

282
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:57,799
I was just kidding.

283
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:00,342
She is Leela Satyamurthy,
from Kolhapur, Maharashtra.

284
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:02,767
Hindi?

285
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,592
Father is a Telugu while
her mother is a Maharashtrian.

286
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,050
Don't pack your bags to go after her,
now.

287
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:10,008
She is not there. She is here.

288
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:13,342
We're doing this course together
with this director

289
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,634
and she'll be living
with us from tomorrow.

290
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,675
Her father is coming here
tomorrow to check if she's okay.

291
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,550
I need not tell you.

292
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,799
Still I am telling you...

293
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,175
Be good. Do not do anything
that stains my reputation.

294
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:35,635
[music]

295
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:39,091
Anything can happen in life.

296
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:42,886
Like the way you came into my life.

297
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:49,616
[music continues]

298
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,231
-Son...
-Yes.

299
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:13,561
[music continues]

300
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,550
-Didn't you go out today?
-No.

301
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:11,550
"When she is present before my eyes,"

302
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,300
"She slapped me when I thought
it as a dream."

303
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,751
"She asked me to look at her."

304
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:28,550
"Is she a delight to my heart?"

305
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:35,787
"I born again today,"

306
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:39,702
"I feel great about it."

307
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:49,108
"Today,
I saw you as I've never seen you before"

308
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:54,754
"I feel great about it."

309
00:20:55,154 --> 00:21:01,119
"Today, my morning woke up with you"

310
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:05,614
"I feel great about it."

311
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:13,028
"You're my today's devotional song"

312
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:19,024
"I feel great about it."

313
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:25,159
"If you caress me like her breeze"

314
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:30,655
"I feel great about it."

315
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:44,320
[music continues]

316
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,133
Sorry.

317
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:36,758
You'd to sleep on
the couch because of me.

318
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,133
Super bro.

319
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,258
Last few days are the
best moments of my life.

320
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,592
Everyday night...
it is become a routine for us.

321
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,467
Dude, this better be interesting.

322
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,467
Some or the other channel would be
running on the TV in front of us.

323
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:53,050
Hey! Listen man.

324
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,091
-I'm telling about my life matter.
-You listen too.

325
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,383
Sorry,
you had to sleep here because of me.

326
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,166
Not at all!

327
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,217
I've been on the couch
for five years now.

328
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,050
I sleep in my parents' room for a few
hours if dad wakes me up in the morning.

329
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,758
They're girls.
They need privacy.

330
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,333
For me too.

331
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:14,300
No problem at all.
It's not because of you.

332
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,133
It must be really nice
with two sisters at home.

333
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,758
Mayhem! It's real torture.

334
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,383
But it's nice sometimes.

335
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:26,217
Like right now.

336
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,175
-Who else lives in your home?
- I'm the only child in my house.

337
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,841
Mom, dad and me.

338
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,758
This is better, really.

339
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:36,550
It is really boring in my home.

340
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,300
Maitreyi talks a lot about you.

341
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,175
That you are super cool, very protective,

342
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,175
Chilled up type,
you are this, you are that.

343
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,175
Sorry, I even know about
your Sukanya's story.

344
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,383
I know her famous dialogue too.

345
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,008
It is easier for you to forget
me than for me to love you again.

346
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,183
Am I right?

347
00:23:57,301 --> 00:24:00,403
Why did Maitreyi tell you all these?

348
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,133
Everyone knows.

349
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,300
Looks like entire Andhra and Telangana
knows my love story.

350
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,883
I did my schooling here, Timpany School.

351
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,925
My parents decided to move to Kolhapur
after my school.

352
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,592
So, we moved.

353
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,066
Four years of engineering!

354
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:20,883
Dad said I need not have to work
unless the offers are good.

355
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:22,675
So I've joined MBA.

356
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:26,290
Just finished and now taking it easy.

357
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,767
But every day, there would be
some conversation between us.

358
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:31,342
-Tell us some interesting bits...
-Maximum it's we two.

359
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,712
-Sometimes, Maitreyi joins us.
-Why is she in between?

360
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,456
-Such great chemistry!
-Is it?

361
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:40,342
-Some warmth is building up in that room.
-Warmth again?

362
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:42,008
That heat is so nice.

363
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:44,008
I can feel it...

364
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,091
Not sure if she can feel it or not.

365
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,425
You should show her that.

366
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,383
Yes we acted, too.

367
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,300
They asked us to stand next
to the heroine in a bus stand!

368
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,217
Like background artists.

369
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,384
Assistant directors don't just work!

370
00:24:57,484 --> 00:24:59,219
Sometimes,
they make them stand in the frame too.

371
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,233
Who is the heroine?

372
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:02,799
We're way better than her!

373
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,925
So you included yourself in the better.

374
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:07,883
Trust me.

375
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,483
So,
did you both like the job?

376
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:11,258
No!
I didn't like it.

377
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,508
I like to write.

378
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:13,883
I am going to be a script writer.

379
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:14,758
She too.

380
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,050
We are going to be a writer duo.
We have decided.

381
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:21,091
We'll churn up material to make films.
That's more interesting.

382
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,133
Just 20 more days of internship.

383
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,925
We're getting it registered as
'Leela - Maitreyi, the writer duo'.

384
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,226
Then, we need cheap and best
office in good locality.

385
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,175
Why don't you find a place for us?

386
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,758
First come up with a good script.
Then I will show you a good office.

387
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:43,383
Okay, I'm feeling sleepy.
I'm going. You guys continue.

388
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,481
Leave... leave...

389
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,883
Let me know when you want to sleep,
I'll leave.

390
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,091
Hey no! Not at all, relax.

391
00:25:56,517 --> 00:25:58,217
- It's been a long day dude.
- I didn't know the time.

392
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,091
I cannot wait for it to be night.

393
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:03,342
Hey! Hey!

394
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:06,716
Not that.
I mean, does not this heat bother you?

395
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,550
-We know very well, why you are waiting.
-You've become so wet.

396
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,300
Just imagine guys.

397
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:14,258
Surrounded by boys all day...!

398
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:16,508
I'm bored of spending
all my time with you guys.

399
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,167
-Just imagine guys!
-This is too insulting, man. I'm going.

400
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,792
-Hey! Hey!
-Yes.

401
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:22,050
Come this way to go out but not that way.

402
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,508
-Another insult!
-Leave... leave.

403
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,716
-He is my best friend!
-Leave... leave.

404
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,291
-Dude, what's the time?
-Hey! Don't overact.

405
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,133
-I fell asleep.
-I noticed.

406
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,217
You could go in and sleep!

407
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,675
-I'm hungry.
-You had dinner, right?

408
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,091
Yes, I had my dinner at 8:00 pm!

409
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,425
It's midnight now.
I'm hungry.

410
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:55,639
-Here you go. Enjoy.
-Wow! My favourite. Thank you.

411
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,987
-Oh! Really...
-Maitreyi told you right?

412
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,745
-No.
-You're not eating?

413
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:01,525
I don't know.

414
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,622
I just completed my M.B.A.

415
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,716
But I don't want to study anymore.

416
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,716
I'll plan for a small trip...

417
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,592
-later, I'll find for a good job.
- Nice.

418
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,550
Travel to where? All over the world?

419
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,550
Within my means. That is the
reason I said it's a small trip.

420
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,550
First south India.

421
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,634
Actually,
I should have left two weeks ago.

422
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,675
My friend Mahesh ditched me.

423
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,758
I didn't want to travel alone.

424
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:29,358
It will be nice.

425
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,050
On my bike, that too! It'll be great.

426
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,008
Seriously? On a bike?

427
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,091
Yes, it is just a bike.

428
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:38,799
No one at home knows.
They won't let me go on my bike.

429
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:41,966
I Planned up to Kanyakumari.

430
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:46,509
I'll watch the sun rise first and
then figure out the rest later.

431
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,331
Wow!

432
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:48,716
Will start next week.

433
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:51,425
So, you have a good bike?
To go on a road trip?

434
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,133
Which bike?

435
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:53,491
What?

436
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,966
You have not seen my bike?

437
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,750
No.

438
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:58,425
Are you serious?

439
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,434
You might be a girl but how
could you not see my bike?

440
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,858
Daily my bike parked out there,
like a rock.

441
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,575
-I have not seen it.
-You should use spectacles.

442
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:07,799
Come I'll show you my bike.

443
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,841
This is my Royal Enfield.
Isn't she a beauty?

444
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,342
Shall I tell them about your bike plan?

445
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,111
Hey! What is wrong with you?
Shh...

446
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,008
You'll be safe?
Do not drive fast and rash.

447
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,467
You haven't even told them!
So, take care.

448
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:36,550
-Ok?
-Sure.

449
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:40,291
-Ok, Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

450
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,716
And, she is super cute.

451
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,550
Like A.R. Rahman's music.

452
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,008
Like Hosanna?

453
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,258
In that film, the girl lives upstairs.

454
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,966
But here,
she is beside me at our home.

455
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,593
-Oh...
-You said it right.

456
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,175
-It is like his music that grows on you.
-Yeah.

457
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,508
As you talk to her,
as you go on looking at her...

458
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,004
Love. Clean pure love.

459
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:13,643
"Do the cuckoo's tune consist of music?"

460
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:16,608
"Is that its melody?"

461
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:25,467
"If this cuckoo looks at me, Oh! Oh!"

462
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:29,966
"What will I become with that sight?"

463
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:36,091
"I fell flat, still I love it."

464
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:40,634
"What will I become with that sight?"

465
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:48,362
"Somehow today, I glanced at you,"

466
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:52,637
"I feel great about it."

467
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:06,342
"I glanced at you which I never did
before and I feel great about it."

468
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:15,508
"You're a Telugu devotional song to me,
I feel great about it"

469
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:21,175
"If you caress me like her breeze,
I feel great about it."

470
00:30:26,153 --> 00:30:27,369
'It's nice."

471
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:36,352
"It's nice."

472
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:50,383
Were you busy?
I hardly see you around.

473
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:53,358
No, I had some work in college.
I went out with my friends.

474
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,508
I'm leaving tomorrow.

475
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:57,799
I'll head to hostel, pack my bags and the
day after morning is my train to Kolhapur.

476
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,925
Maitreyi said she'll come there
in two weeks.

477
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,133
We're planning to start writing there.

478
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,949
-Oh! All the best!
-Thank you.

479
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,734
If you're leaving then I'll also start
on my bike trip day after tomorrow.

480
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:09,990
On my road trip.

481
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:13,133
I asked some friends but not sure,
if they would join.

482
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,925
They're all in pursuit of their future.

483
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,841
But Mahesh said that he'll come.

484
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:20,217
But I know he'll ditch
me in the last moment.

485
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:22,091
Anyway,
his girlfriend won't let him go!

486
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,883
Whether he is coming or not,
I am heading out.

487
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,550
-On your bike for sure?
-Yes, on my bike!

488
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:28,694
How could you... without telling anyone?

489
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:30,442
They'd definitely won't allow
me if I tell them.

490
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,191
I've seen enough of buses and trains.

491
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,425
But this time it must be on my bike.

492
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:37,966
Me and my RE. With the wind on my face!

493
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:41,550
-Don't tell Maitreyi!
-Okay.

494
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,091
I will tell her that Mahesh
wants to borrow my bike.

495
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:45,799
He'll take the bike in the evening

496
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:47,716
and he'll wait at the
street corner day after morning.

497
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,467
I've told them that I'm
going to Kanyakumari by train.

498
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:52,716
I even bought a ticket to play it safe.

499
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:55,333
So, the next day morning I'll
convey bye to everyone

500
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,091
and reach the street corner
in a hired three-wheeler.

501
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:04,133
I feel so much better
here than being at home.

502
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:05,758
I had a great time seriously.

503
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,356
-Thank you!
-Hey!

504
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:11,091
You stayed up to so many nights
to give me your company.

505
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:12,675
You are welcome. Same here.

506
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,383
All the best. Ride safe.

507
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:17,758
All the best to you guys. Write
something fresh and interesting stuff!

508
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,716
I've kept cash in your bag,
be careful.

509
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,133
-Got the train ticket?
-Yes dad, it's there.

510
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:33,758
Don't eat junk! Take care.

511
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,925
I don't like these trips at all.

512
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,592
Where is Mahesh?

513
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:39,716
- Um, that fellow...
- He'd come directly to the station.

514
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:42,925
Don't worry, mom.
I'll be fine. Okay?

515
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,008
When I am back,
I will focus on my future.

516
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:47,342
In fact, this trip is for that.
It is really important to me.

517
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:49,198
Ok? You take care.
I will go now.

518
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,292
-Take care.
-Bye Dad, Bye.

519
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:51,646
-Bye mom.
[vehicle moving]

520
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:55,841
Hey you?

521
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,550
-What?
-Is the bike ready?

522
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,834
All set.

523
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:01,217
I've messed up with Divya and took
permission to come along with you.

524
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,383
It better be worth it.
This is true friendship.

525
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:04,643
Let that be.

526
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:07,467
Thank God! My dad did not insist on
coming to the station. I'm safe.

527
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,550
Dude, it's Leela!

528
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,841
-What is she doing here?
-Look into that first.

529
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,425
-Wait. I'll be back.
-Make it fast we are getting late.

530
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,798
-Hi.
-Hi.

531
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,550
-How come you're here? Is everything ok?
-Yeah.

532
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:37,716
Are you going to your house?

533
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:38,883
At this time?

534
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,960
Did Maitreyi know about this?
She didn't say anything.

535
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,550
Are you sure everything is ok?

536
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:44,750
Yeah.

537
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,633
-I think we're going triples.
-Is it?

538
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:51,133
I thought to come with
you on your bike tour.

539
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,317
What?

540
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,758
Sorry, I thought you said
your friend may not come.

541
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:01,592
But he is here, right?

542
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:02,961
-Hi.
-Hi.

543
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:03,966
No problem.

544
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,050
I'll leave to Kolhapur.

545
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,091
You carry on.

546
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:11,829
I've got a train at 8:30. That was the
plan anyway. So, it's okay. Chill.

547
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:13,883
-You guys have a good trip. Seriously.
-Are you sure?

548
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:15,750
What?

549
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,300
About coming with me on the bike?

550
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:20,217
Sure. I will come next time.

551
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,217
It won't be that easy.

552
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:23,675
It will be okay for the boys.

553
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,175
You'll have to rough it out.

554
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,008
Onto that you don't know me too well.

555
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,841
You're a girl. I'm a boy.
of course,

556
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,342
I am decent.

557
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,383
But you know how it is...

558
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:41,008
Looks like its going to be doubles
and just the two of them.

559
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:45,459
Your friend is here this time.
Go with him.

560
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,217
He's a boy. You're a boy.

561
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,886
It'll be nice.
I'll be fine!

562
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,667
But he's not coming!

563
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:53,799
Bro...

564
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,300
-Hey! Bro...
-Hey!

565
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:58,383
-No man, No, don't.
-Please, dude listen to me.

566
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,666
-This is for your own good. Please dude.
-Get lost! I am a fool, to trust you!

567
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,062
-Please bro...
-Get lost!

568
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:04,716
Hey! Divya would be happy.

569
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,089
-You! Betrayer!
-Did you take your luggage?

570
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,360
I packed soon after I saw her.
[vehicle moving]

571
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,667
I fought with Divya for this fellow...

572
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,883
-You always cut me, you be good.
-Let's plan it next time.

573
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:12,999
Sorry!

574
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,550
-I feel really bad.
-You don't worry about him.

575
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:18,162
He'll go straight to Divya's place.
Don't give much to him.

576
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:19,452
Come on. Let's go.

577
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:21,435
It's alright.

578
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:24,667
He'd forget this in ten minutes!
He is just over-acting!

579
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:26,876
So, what do we do?

580
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,126
I don't even know your name.

581
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:30,500
What?

582
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:34,709
It's true. Maitreyi didn't mention
your name when she introduced you.

583
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:37,751
She always refers to you as 'my brother'
when she talks about you.

584
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:39,459
Even when my dad came!

585
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:42,584
I didn't hear anyone at home, calling
you by your name either.

586
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,834
I was hoping to listen eventually.

587
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:49,126
But no one called you by name.

588
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:51,126
So...

589
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,876
What's your name?
-You know what...

590
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:55,251
Let it be so.

591
00:35:55,451 --> 00:36:00,659
[music]

592
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,376
But, tell me something.

593
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:06,126
So, why did you decide to
come with me on this trip?

594
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:13,542
This bike will take off with or without
you, depending on what you say.

595
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,251
This bike goes with me!

596
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:24,001
I've never been on a bike before.

597
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:26,459
This is the first time.
I always wanted to!

598
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,500
As you said 'The wind on my face', right?

599
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,542
I wanted that too.

600
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:35,126
I guess you are a decent guy.

601
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:37,861
Anyway, Maitreyi is there
if I need to complain.

602
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:39,417
I gave it so much thought...

603
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:42,709
Ever since you mentioned this trip.
I was thinking about it...

604
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:46,584
I know if I let this chance go by,
I won't get another in my life.

605
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:49,839
-This is why. That's it.
-Awesome!

606
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:58,293
Hey! Are you ok?

607
00:36:58,684 --> 00:36:59,251
Yeah!

608
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,032
[vehicle passing]

609
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,168
So, what's the plan?

610
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,209
Where are we going?
Do we keep on riding or stop somewhere?

611
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:14,126
What's your name?
Tell me!

612
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:19,751
We are heading to Kanyakumari.
Via Salem and Trivandrum.

613
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,709
Since you're with me now,
the rest of the plan might change a bit.

614
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,126
Will decide it on the way!

615
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,751
Let me know if I need to pull over.

616
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:30,751
Else we'll keep going
till we need to eat or sleep.

617
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:32,001
We will ride on...

618
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:39,501
-Water?
-No, no, I am Fine.

619
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:44,251
-Do you want to drink juice?
-Juice?

620
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:49,043
Have biscuits.

621
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,819
-Cup Noodles, do you want?
-What?

622
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,459
What about Chocolate Cake?

623
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:03,376
Looks like you have a
mini food-court in there!

624
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,525
-What?
-Nothing, go ahead! eat.

625
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:33,667
"Let's stretch our wings and fly."

626
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:38,209
"Leaving behind all
the bounds and stars."

627
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:43,834
"Our youth made this freeway the sky,"

628
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:50,500
"Soar high into the sky, says my girl."

629
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:55,209
"Let's go,
would I question the direction?"

630
00:38:55,784 --> 00:39:00,043
"Don't I follow wherever you go."

631
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:05,209
"Oh! Dear..."

632
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:09,251
"In this competition..."

633
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:16,942
"...lets see who is ahead."

634
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:19,287
"Let's see."

635
00:39:19,803 --> 00:39:23,959
"Who will speak those first words?"

636
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:28,834
"Who will express their love?"

637
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:34,335
"Who will break the silence first?"

638
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:39,168
"Who will lead, who would speak first"

639
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:43,751
"And when will the moment of our meet
up and opening up of heart arrive..."

640
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:46,834
"When will the moment be."

641
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,670
Hello. We're travelling
from Vizag to Kanyakumari.

642
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,086
-Oh...
-It's become dark.

643
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,131
-We need a place to stay...
-Oh is it?

644
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:05,968
-Is she your sister?
-It's me and my sister's friend Leela.

645
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:19,688
[music]

646
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:35,168
You are our guests.
We'll take care of it.

647
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:38,293
If you knock on somebody's door in the
same city and ask to spend the night...

648
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,834
They would call the cops.

649
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:42,417
Yeah, seriously...

650
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:48,168
"Sensing the swift movements,
and the eyes concealment."

651
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:53,084
"Would require an utensil
that can measure the love."

652
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:58,584
"While this agony is buried since years
how long should the heart bear its weight?"

653
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:02,584
"Will the journey end easily?"

654
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:07,376
"Sensing the swift movements,
and the eyes concealment."

655
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,251
"Would require an untensil
that can measure the love."

656
00:41:13,084 --> 00:41:17,876
"While this agony is buried since years
how long should the heart bear its weight?"

657
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:22,126
"Will the journey end easily?"

00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:26,084
"Oh! Dear..."

659
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,667
"In this competition..."

660
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,001
"In this competition..."

661
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:38,126
"Who will speak those first words?"

662
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:43,001
"Who will express their love?"

663
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:52,669
"I have a desire for you..."

664
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:56,603
"I have a desire for you..."

665
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:04,796
"I'm longing for you..."

666
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:11,756
"I'm longing for you..."

667
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,234
"I have a desire for you..."

668
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,431
"Together the distance we travelled,"

669
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:29,876
"The light you showed
by being my shadow,"

670
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:34,048
"The paths I crossed as you lead the way,
would I forget?"

671
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:39,626
"I liked this experience with you and
I desire the same for 100 more years."

672
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:43,626
"Will I know what I
need to do for this bliss?"

673
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:46,631
"Together the distance we travelled,"

674
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:49,135
"The light you showed
by being my shadow,"

675
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:53,533
"The paths I crossed as you lead the way,
would I forget?"

676
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:58,626
"I liked this experience with you and
I desire the same for 100 more years."

677
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:03,126
"Will I know what I need
to do for this bliss?"

678
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,541
"Oh! Dear..."

679
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:09,630
"In this competition..."

680
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:14,586
"In this competition..."

00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:19,335
"Who will speak those first words?"

682
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:23,792
"Who will express their love?"

683
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,959
"Who will break the silence first?"

684
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:34,251
"Who will lead, who would speak first"

685
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:41,376
"And when will the moment of our meet
up and opening up of heart arrive..."

686
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,709
"When will that moment be...?"

687
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:04,626
Two rooms, right?

688
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,417
If I say one is enough then
are you going to judge me?

689
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:11,393
No, no, not at all.

690
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:14,323
-I just want you to be comfortable.
-Just think I am Mahesh.

691
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:16,001
That's the experience I came for.

692
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:18,542
To hang out with the boys like a boy.

693
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,284
Is that so?

694
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,168
Let's go then, dude.

695
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:26,585
[chuckles] Come. Just kidding.
Don't be scared.

696
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:28,726
-Hi.
-Hello sir.

697
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:34,121
-We need one room with separate beds.
-Okay, sir.

698
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:36,584
-Two minutes...
-Your name sir?

699
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:42,104
-Terrific name sir.
-I know.

700
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:43,293
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

701
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:47,751
This way, first floor.

702
00:45:07,335 --> 00:45:08,665
-Hey!
-Yes.

703
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:12,209
You go in, I'll wait outside.
Be comfortable.

704
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:13,474
Thank you.

705
00:45:13,774 --> 00:45:19,770
[music]

706
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:31,709
Complete foodie, right?

707
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:46,409
Leela...

708
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:49,709
Leela, hi morning!

709
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:50,859
It's 4:40 am.

710
00:45:52,026 --> 00:45:54,043
We can't miss the sunrise in Kanyakumari!

711
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:54,855
Oh...

712
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:57,959
Sorry, you go ahead.

713
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:15,126
"She and I are the cloud and sky."

714
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:19,959
"She and I are lotus and the lake."

715
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:25,084
"She and I are the yield and the field."

716
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:30,043
"She and I are the root and tree."

717
00:46:30,335 --> 00:46:34,959
"If she is the moon, I am the night."

718
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:39,709
"Flower and fragrance, she and I."

719
00:46:40,368 --> 00:46:44,918
"Lamp and light,
Telugu and its sweetness."

720
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:49,959
"She and I, the soul and body."

721
00:47:15,393 --> 00:47:17,529
Are you emotional too, just like me?

722
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:41,751
I feel like I've found a good friend.

723
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:46,106
-Life long...
-You are right.

724
00:47:55,226 --> 00:48:00,959
"I am the path, she's the shore,"

725
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,084
I'll go from here, Thank you so much.

726
00:48:04,168 --> 00:48:05,126
I had a good time.

727
00:48:09,393 --> 00:48:10,417
You know what.

728
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:12,376
I'll drop you home.

729
00:48:17,534 --> 00:48:22,168
Two days,
I still have ten days of journey...

730
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:24,376
Just help me come...

731
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:27,751
No chance,
trust me I'll drop at your home.

732
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:33,751
Why should I get on your bike?
Give me one good reason.

733
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:37,001
Inseparable earth and mud

734
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:42,043
"She and I are the cloud and sky."

735
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:46,667
"She and I are lotus and the lake."

736
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:51,959
"She and I are the yield and the field."

737
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:56,709
"She and I are the root and tree."

738
00:49:02,126 --> 00:49:06,667
"She and I are the cloud and sky."

739
00:49:07,084 --> 00:49:11,376
"She and I are lotus and the lake."

740
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:16,459
"She and I are the yield and the field."

741
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:21,293
"She and I are the root and tree."

742
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:26,293
"If she is the moon I am the night."

743
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:31,043
"Flower and fragrance, she and I."

744
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:36,584
"Lamp and light,
Telugu and its sweetness."

745
00:49:36,709 --> 00:49:40,959
"She and I! the soul and body."

746
00:49:41,426 --> 00:49:45,918
"Soul and body... soul and body."

747
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:50,876
"Soul and body!"

748
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:55,417
When I spoke to my dad yesterday I lied
to him that I was still in your home...

749
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,584
I told him I'll be there tomorrow.

750
00:49:58,084 --> 00:49:59,751
I never told him I'm
on this trip with you.

751
00:50:00,226 --> 00:50:01,018
Understood?

752
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:04,168
Even when I called home,
I never told them you're with me.

753
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,201
Why?

754
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:07,335
I don't know.

755
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:11,126
I didn't say anything when we left.

756
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:13,043
Didn't tell them anything later.

757
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:16,293
They won't get it if I tell them now.

758
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:19,335
It's not like we are
doing something wrong.

759
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,709
Isn't it wrong to consider it as a
mistake when we haven't commit any?

760
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:29,584
Okay. First give me your phone number.
[vehicles horn]

761
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:31,459
Even I don't have your number.
Take it...

762
00:50:35,376 --> 00:50:36,834
-One...
-I'm saving it as unknown.

763
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:40,043
This isn't just friendship...
You're more than a good friend.

764
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:44,084
I am dying to tell you this is love.

765
00:51:44,742 --> 00:51:48,667
I've yearned to say
'don't go be with me'.

766
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:52,376
If the friendship I was searching
for becomes close as my shadow,

767
00:51:52,918 --> 00:51:54,584
it would be fantastic.

768
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:15,979
[tires screeching]

769
00:52:30,293 --> 00:52:36,217
"Time has turned into
a river and rushed,"

770
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:40,730
"Heart wont loose its pace,"

771
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:46,101
"When the shadow of friendship
in its quest reaches me."

772
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:53,709
"You filled my eyes entirely."

773
00:52:54,435 --> 00:53:01,420
"Guided by friendship
that filled my heart."

774
00:53:02,951 --> 00:53:08,399
"Every minute, my heart beats stops..."

775
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:13,950
"...breath sings a melody, every
word that I let out becomes a poem."

776
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,143
"As my heart surrenders,
you become the other half of me."

777
00:53:18,643 --> 00:53:23,267
"The first love within me
rises like a sea tide..."

778
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:29,984
"...as I watch it like a child."

779
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:38,876
"This feeling gave wings to my
imagination as it flies skyward."

780
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:46,126
"My dreams are stolen as the eyes
cuddle and melt in its warmth."

781
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:53,792
"The moonlight hurts in the
silver rain as we shine together."

782
00:53:54,126 --> 00:54:00,584
"The silence inside me has
made my dream into a poem."

783
00:54:00,709 --> 00:54:04,957
"A shower of sacred water..."

784
00:54:05,357 --> 00:54:08,799
"...has touched my life."

785
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:19,575
"This is the fundamental force
which cannot be stopped by us..."

786
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:23,362
"...will never leave us."

787
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:30,607
Hey! I love you.

788
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:38,960
"Don't leave..."

789
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:44,237
"...my heart and go."

790
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:47,937
"With a deserted heart..."

791
00:54:48,737 --> 00:54:51,430
"...how far can I walk?"

792
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:53,633
"Don't leave..."

793
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:59,037
"...my heart and go."

794
00:54:59,626 --> 00:55:03,217
"With a deserted heart..."

795
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:06,255
"...how far can I walk?"

796
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:10,610
"Without knowing the language
there is no script"

"As the world comes to an end..."

799
00:55:16,298 --> 00:55:21,198
"...our love will still
stand against odds."

800
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:23,638
"This is a boon."

801
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:40,542
"A friendship that soothes
the heart is a boon,"

"When your lips part in a
smile there is a melody,"

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,709
"The ray of love is a dawn in my heart,"

804
00:55:48,126 --> 00:55:51,293
"The moment when our
eyes met was glorious."

805
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:54,584
"A stream of love shines in my heart,
it shines..."

806
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:58,293
"...on me,
without my consent it rains..."

807
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:03,459
"Our hearts sing a melody in unison."

00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,959
"Dreams will not forsake the eyes,"

00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:11,168

"In you! and in me!"

812
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:25,001
"In you! and in me!"

813
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:28,876
"In you! and in me!"

814
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:35,667
Leela...

815
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:42,542
Leela never tell this to anyone!

816
00:56:42,876 --> 00:56:45,626
Not till my death!
Else it should be between us...

817
00:56:48,084 --> 00:56:52,043
I can't imagine dying without telling
you this. I'll never forgive myself.

818
00:56:55,593 --> 00:56:58,273
I love you! Leela.

819
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,751
From the moment I first saw you.

820
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:05,833
When we met with an accident,

821
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:10,368
I was scared I'd die and
that's why I said I love you.

822
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:17,209
We are waiting for the doctor...
Did he start the rounds?

823
00:57:18,342 --> 00:57:19,002
Okay.

824
00:57:29,293 --> 00:57:31,001
What was even scarier was...

825
00:57:31,376 --> 00:57:33,959
...waking up at the hospital and
finding you weren't there next to me.

826
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:39,459
They said you came with me, admitted
me and registered my name as Mahesh.

827
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:42,084
But you weren't with me after that.

828
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,376
I was scared wondering
what happened to you.

829
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:05,417
Excuse me.

830
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:07,068
-Can I use the phone?
-Sure.

831
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,667
Where are you?
Whose number is this?

832
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:09,918
-What happened to your phone?
-Maitreyi...

833
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:11,792
Nothing happened...
my phone broke down...

834
00:58:11,876 --> 00:58:13,287
-Do you know how many calls I made?
-That was the reason I didn't call you.

835
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:15,021
-How are you?
-Hey! I am fine!

836
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:17,001
-Phone wasn't working. That's all.-Where are you now?

837
00:58:17,084 --> 00:58:17,801
Your in Kanyakumari right?

838
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:21,959
Kanyakumari. Sunrise is beautiful...
You all must see...

839
00:58:22,243 --> 00:58:23,500
Trust me it's amazing!

840
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,251
You will always tell but
you never take us.

841
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,867
OK. I got to go. Tell mom and dad
I'll be back day after tomorrow morning.

842
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,001
Tell them I am fine.

843
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:32,209
Don't know what to tell them!
Mom wants to talk to you.

844
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:34,169
-Tell them something.-Will do that. Ok bye.

845
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:34,810
Bye.

846
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,584
-Sir, is this a government hospital?
-Yes, go inside.

847
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:43,918
It took me two hours to locate your
ward in this hospital! I'm here now.

848
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:46,376
Ok, ok, chill...

849
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:49,209
Good that I am still alive.

850
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,126
I'd be a dead man now.

851
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,417
There is a God.

852
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:56,500
When I think of the bike,
these injuries are nothing.

853
00:58:56,959 --> 00:58:58,209
My mind is only on that.

854
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:00,417
Dude, it was a hit and
run accident it seems...

855
00:59:00,692 --> 00:59:02,043
That truck fellow rammed and escaped.

856
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,417
If I caught him,

857
00:59:04,918 --> 00:59:06,792
-I would have killed him! Rogue!
-Forget about it.

858
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:12,126
Have no clue where she is.

859
00:59:12,168 --> 00:59:13,417
Are you sure that
nothing happened to her?

860
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,500
May be, she'd just fainted.

861
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:18,584
She had admitted me into the
hospital, the doctor said yesterday.

862
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:21,293
She is just another girl.
She dumped you and scooted.

863
00:59:25,376 --> 00:59:26,168
Hello.

864
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:28,667
It's me, Leela.

865
00:59:30,576 --> 00:59:31,351
Leela!

866
00:59:32,093 --> 00:59:34,584
Sorry I couldn't talk
to you for three days.

867
00:59:34,818 --> 00:59:36,043
How are you?

868
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,667
I'm fine.
Where are you?

869
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:42,500
I called up the hospital yesterday
and enquired about you.

870
00:59:42,984 --> 00:59:45,709
They told me you're alright.

871
00:59:45,984 --> 00:59:46,876
Thank God.

872
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:49,251
Sorry I am not there.

873
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:52,500
I registered your name as Mahesh.

874
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:55,209
There was a situation...
I had to leave.

875
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:59,376
Here... don't know how to say.

876
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:01,293
Father was knifed.

877
01:00:02,043 --> 01:00:03,626
He is in the hospital!

878
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:05,500
I am attending on him.

879
01:00:06,009 --> 01:00:08,667
The doctor says he might not survive.

880
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:12,001
They also tried to kill mom.

881
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,792
It's a planned attempt
to kill both of them.

882
01:00:15,818 --> 01:00:16,959
Attempt?

883
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:18,251
-Yes.
-What?

884
01:00:18,692 --> 01:00:20,293
What are you talking about?

885
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:24,084
The truck that hit us wasn't
an accident at all.

886
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:26,209
That was sent to kill me.

887
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:29,084
After I admitted you in the hospital...

888
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,792
...my dad called me up.

889
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:35,126
Asked me to leave immediately.

890
01:00:36,126 --> 01:00:37,792
While he was talking to me...

891
01:00:38,126 --> 01:00:41,043
He was attacked, I could hear it.

892
01:00:41,335 --> 01:00:44,043
Why is this happening to your family?
Why an attempt on you?

893
01:00:44,084 --> 01:00:45,542
At this moment I know nothing.

894
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,425
I am really sorry!
It's all because of me.

895
01:00:49,467 --> 01:00:52,626
Everything changed in a moment.
Don't stay there.

896
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:54,126
Go home. Please...

897
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:55,667
I'll call you once your home!

898
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:58,709
So, it was a planned attack to
take down your bike.

899
01:00:58,792 --> 01:00:59,459
With a truck?

900
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:00,959
She said so.

901
01:01:01,376 --> 01:01:01,876
Why?

902
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:03,209
She said she didn't know.

903
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:04,626
She didn't say anything else.

904
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:07,376
Dude... this sounds scary.

905
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,542
So knowing all this
we are going back for her...

906
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:14,918
We are going to be with her?

907
01:01:15,834 --> 01:01:16,459
Why?

908
01:01:17,918 --> 01:01:19,251
I made a mistake.

909
01:01:20,168 --> 01:01:21,001
What?

910
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:23,876
When I was hit by the truck,
and lying on the road...

911
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:25,959
...I told her, 'I love you, Leela'.

912
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:28,834
You said that moment?

913
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:30,751
I thought I would definitely die.

914
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,500
It felt right to tell her.

915
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:36,168
You didn't think of calling up your
parents, saying goodbye to them?

916
01:01:36,584 --> 01:01:38,335
Or even talking to me?

917
01:01:39,834 --> 01:01:41,876
Yes,
all those thoughts flashed in my mind.

918
01:01:42,584 --> 01:01:44,500
But in the end,
it was only love that lingered.

919
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,959
-Her father's name is Satyamurthy, right?
-Yes.

920
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:49,490
-Satyamurthy...
-Straight down, take a right...

921
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,781
...then you'll find
it on the second floor.

922
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:51,778
What?

923
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:53,928
[phone ringing]
-Straight...?

924
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:57,084
-Sir, the cameras are not working here.
-Excuse me!

925
01:02:06,459 --> 01:02:08,959
Dude, there is no one here.
It is empty.

926
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:41,168
Leela! Who's that?

927
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:43,667
They're my friends.
You can leave.

928
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,376
Leela, Don't cry.

929
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:55,376
What has happened to your father?

930
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:56,584
Don't know.

931
01:02:56,751 --> 01:02:58,335
No one tells me properly!

932
01:02:58,667 --> 01:02:59,876
He lost a lot of blood.

933
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:01,918
Onto that, it was an abdominal wound!

934
01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:03,792
Doctors are not hopeful.

935
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:05,959
They've stabbed him in
ten different places.

936
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:08,584
And your mom?

937
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:13,667
She has a head injury.
She fell down.

938
01:03:14,376 --> 01:03:15,959
She was also stabbed.

939
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,459
But she survived.

940
01:03:18,317 --> 01:03:19,335
She is inside.

941
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:21,168
What really happened Leela?

942
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:23,043
Do you want me to help?

943
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:25,542
Who this is, why they did this...
I don't know anything.

944
01:03:26,493 --> 01:03:27,667
Nobody knows anything.

945
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:30,209
Why did you come here?

946
01:03:31,126 --> 01:03:33,335
I asked you to go home.

947
01:03:33,959 --> 01:03:35,043
You are injured, too!

948
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:35,959
Ok.

949
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:37,980
Leela, please!
Let us sit and talk! Sit bro!

950
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:40,620
In an ordinary person's life...

951
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:46,986
...never take it for granted that
there will be no violence.

952
01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:49,209
Anything can happen anytime.

953
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:53,000
My ordinary life turned into a
violent action story at that hospital.

954
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:56,509
If a situation were to arise,
I can handle it.

955
01:03:56,593 --> 01:03:59,126
I'm confident... that I have the stuff
it takes to deal with it.

956
01:03:59,501 --> 01:04:01,501
That kind of confidence
is very important in life.

957
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:07,668
That day was the final test
challenging that confidence.

958
01:04:13,251 --> 01:04:14,441
That minute.

959
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:15,804
Leela!

960
01:04:34,108 --> 01:04:36,116
-Are you Satyamurthy's daughter?
-Yes.

961
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:42,762
Is this a hospital or what?
What's with the crowd?

962
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:44,681
Get going.

963
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:06,536
Suddenly a knife in his hand.

964
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:09,267
He raised it up..

965
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,431
It is coming to leela's neck.

966
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:16,050
I saw it in a split second.

967
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,371
Super bro!
[fighting sounds]

968
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:27,105
Becareful!

969
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,629
Don't leave him!
Kill him!

970
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,178
[foot steps]

971
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:44,197
They jumped over the wall.
We couldn't get them. Shucks!

972
01:05:45,193 --> 01:05:46,182
Oh my God!
Are you okay?

973
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,073
Who are those people?

974
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,819
Could have almost killed you!

975
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:54,333
Let's go man!
It isn't safe here.

976
01:05:55,621 --> 01:05:57,697
You shouldn't be here.
None of us should be here!

977
01:05:59,233 --> 01:06:00,678
Who would dare to come
in here and do this?

978
01:06:02,235 --> 01:06:03,840
-I don't know what's happening.
-Bro... bro...

979
01:06:04,687 --> 01:06:05,443
Are you okay?

980
01:06:10,543 --> 01:06:11,347
Who are those people?

981
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:13,734
Who are those goons?
They just tried to attack us upstairs.

982
01:06:13,758 --> 01:06:15,323
-They brought a big knife.
-Would you just one can walk...

983
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,031
-in and out of this hospital?
-Where is your security?

984
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:18,103
-Where is your security?
-Where is your security?

985
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:19,731
Is this a hospital or what?

986
01:06:19,955 --> 01:06:21,131
Where is anyone in this hospital?

987
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:21,710
Sir, I..

988
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:23,104
Sir, I don't know anything.

989
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:24,319
What do you mean?
Don't you know what's going on?

990
01:06:24,363 --> 01:06:25,402
This damn this hospital.

991
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:27,883
If you can't do
anything, just call the cops.

992
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:29,521
Call them.

993
01:06:29,578 --> 01:06:31,501
Where is the Police Station over here?

994
01:06:31,773 --> 01:06:34,851
Police stations takes 40 minutes
from here. [police siren]

995
01:06:38,434 --> 01:06:40,660
Hey! Cops are here.

996
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:43,279
Come! Leela.

997
01:06:52,316 --> 01:06:54,696
Yes. What's the problem?

998
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:55,728
Sir,

999
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:58,422
Her father Mr. Satyamurthy
is admitted upstairs...

1000
01:06:58,778 --> 01:07:00,319
He was attacked three days ago

1001
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:01,907
and now two guys tried to kill her.

1002
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:03,629
Sir! There is absolutely
no security in this hospital.

1003
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,727
He is in a bad shape and
I can't shift him.

1004
01:07:05,967 --> 01:07:07,493
Should I go to the Police Station,
What do I do?

1005
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:08,443
Whom should I speak to?

1006
01:07:08,843 --> 01:07:09,805
[clears throat]

1007
01:07:10,561 --> 01:07:11,640
English weak!

1008
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:12,877
No understand!

1009
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,909
Bull shit,
It is waste of time with him.

1010
01:07:15,377 --> 01:07:18,439
You must come to the Police Station,
file a written complaint.

1011
01:07:18,647 --> 01:07:20,759
That's how you ask for
Police Protection!

1012
01:07:20,883 --> 01:07:21,540
Who are you?

1013
01:07:21,892 --> 01:07:24,677
Sir, I am her friend,
I studied with her.

1014
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:25,306
Who is she?

1015
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:29,088
She is Leela, Mr. Satyamuthy's daughter.

1016
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:29,968
Are you a Madrasi?

1017
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,244
What's your name?

1018
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:32,805
No, Sir! I am from Vizag.

1019
01:07:33,289 --> 01:07:37,395
Your name is Vizag.
[laughs]

1020
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:40,739
Sir!
My name is not Vizag, I am from Vizag.

1021
01:07:40,854 --> 01:07:42,867
Do you understand that?
I don't think so.

1022
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,405
Who came now? What happened?

1023
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:48,060
He hit them so hard...
they got scared and ran away.

1024
01:07:48,084 --> 01:07:48,927
You beat them?

1025
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:51,871
You shouldn't have beat them,
you could have called the cops.

1026
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:53,237
I would have come immediately.

1027
01:07:53,313 --> 01:07:54,242
Sir, they had a knife!

1028
01:07:54,546 --> 01:07:55,459
They tried to kill her!

1029
01:07:55,598 --> 01:07:57,369
He swung the knife at her, so I hit him.

1030
01:07:57,569 --> 01:07:58,171
What do you want me to do?

1031
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:00,505
You want me to ask him to stop showing
the knife pick up the phone and call you?

1032
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:02,873
Sir, can you please understand
the seriousness of the situation?

1033
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:04,981
The weapons are still upstairs.
Go and check for yourself.

1034
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,563
We are afraid. I need your help.
Can you help us or not?

1035
01:08:07,788 --> 01:08:09,094
English! English! I understand.

1036
01:08:09,854 --> 01:08:11,997
You're there for everything to take
care... why do you need us here?

1037
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:17,165
To provide security and protect...
to change nappies... you do everything!

1038
01:08:17,405 --> 01:08:19,373
We go. Police go, go.

1039
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:22,589
Sir! I don't expect a Police
Officer to talk like this.

1040
01:08:22,613 --> 01:08:24,156
I don't know why you
are talking like this.

1041
01:08:24,248 --> 01:08:25,796
-Can you do something about it or not?
- Kamat! Come here!

1042
01:08:26,498 --> 01:08:28,734
-Tambe, go check.
-Ok sir.

1043
01:08:29,057 --> 01:08:30,673
Not you, call Kamath here.

1044
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:34,176
Sir, he is calling you.

1045
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:36,039
They are calling you, Kamath.

1046
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:45,455
Bro, this guy is the same...

1047
01:08:46,983 --> 01:08:48,719
He is talking very casually with him.

1048
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:50,490
Don't worry.

1049
01:08:54,104 --> 01:08:55,912
I totally get it sir, Now I understand.

1050
01:08:56,254 --> 01:08:59,623
What did you understand?
Come with me. Come on.

1051
01:08:59,863 --> 01:09:00,835
In English 'Come, Come'.

1052
01:09:04,305 --> 01:09:07,018
-Who?
-Sleep mom, go to sleep.

1053
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,224
Sir, we found this weapon here.

1054
01:09:15,924 --> 01:09:16,511
Ok sir.

1055
01:09:18,391 --> 01:09:20,222
Don't worry. I am here now.

1056
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:21,922
I will take care of everything.

1057
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:23,604
I don't want a circus here.

1058
01:09:24,108 --> 01:09:25,077
All of you leave now.

1059
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,072
Friends, family, lugguage
and everything leave now.

1060
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,286
Can't you hear? Get going.

1061
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:33,126
My mom and dad are admitted here.
I should be with them.

1062
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:36,018
Rest of them can go, if they want.

1063
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:39,758
Sir! Just two of us will be here.

1064
01:09:39,766 --> 01:09:41,641
No! My son! you told me...

1065
01:09:42,049 --> 01:09:44,617
Two guys came and attacked.
I get everything.

1066
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:47,545
But you shouldn't remain here.
You should get going. Go!

1067
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:52,967
No sir, She wants to be
with her father and mother.

1068
01:09:52,974 --> 01:09:55,043
We just stay here somewhere.
We won't disturb you.

1069
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,634
But, there is permission
for only one attendant.

1070
01:09:58,075 --> 01:10:01,123
The girl's mother can be
her husband's attendant.

1071
01:10:01,223 --> 01:10:02,714
Now the girl wants to be here, too!

1072
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:07,305
You want to tag along with her and
your friend wants to tag along with you!

1073
01:10:07,314 --> 01:10:10,580
You're driving me crazy!

1074
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:14,931
No sir. This doesn't seem to be a
hospital that follows such a rule.

1075
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:16,328
Not the hospital's rules.

1076
01:10:16,985 --> 01:10:19,436
My rules! My rules apply.

1077
01:10:19,877 --> 01:10:20,379
No, sir!

1078
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:22,886
I don't have any
intention of leaving here.

1079
01:10:28,796 --> 01:10:30,556
This guy!

1080
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:35,730
Hear what he said? Grab that guy!

1081
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,500
Sir, sir, please sir.
Don't hit him sir.

1082
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,892
You scolds me in your language?
Called me a mongrel?

1083
01:10:41,092 --> 01:10:42,082
No sir, no sir.
Please, sir.

1084
01:10:42,282 --> 01:10:44,973
I came here to help you
and you are troubling us.

1085
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:53,834
Sir! Your nose is almost broken.
I have fixed it for now.

1086
01:10:54,226 --> 01:10:56,812
It's gonna bleed for some more time,
you need to rest.

1087
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:57,680
Are you a real doctor?

1088
01:10:57,904 --> 01:10:59,787
Yes, I am an ENT specialist here.

1089
01:10:59,887 --> 01:11:01,158
What sort of hospital is this?

1090
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,643
-You know what happened upstairs?
-I don't know about all that sir.

1091
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:05,309
-They tried to kill us.
-Sir you need to calm down.

1092
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:07,932
If you move, you will continue to bleed.

1093
01:11:08,272 --> 01:11:10,628
-What are you talking?
-Just settle down sir, please.

1094
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:13,145
Ya, ya, ok fine.

1095
01:11:13,289 --> 01:11:15,133
-Nurse make sure he is comfortable.
-Hey bro.

1096
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:17,055
-Don't worry. Relax.
-I'll be back in a while.

1097
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,761
We'll look into it later...

1098
01:11:19,473 --> 01:11:20,247
Who is there upstairs?

1099
01:11:20,403 --> 01:11:22,929
There's only one Police Officer.
The rest were sent away.

1100
01:11:23,021 --> 01:11:23,774
Did he go?

1101
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,185
He is gone.

1102
01:11:25,705 --> 01:11:27,449
-Someone came along with him.
-Ok. Who else is there?

1103
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:30,420
We came for you.
There is a Police Officer upstairs.

1104
01:11:31,398 --> 01:11:33,396
You guys stay here,
don't step out from here.

1105
01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:41,583
Why you both are here?

1106
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:44,016
-Where is Hiren?
-Hiren could not make it.

1107
01:11:45,856 --> 01:11:47,648
One errand.
Even then you and me to handle

1108
01:11:48,444 --> 01:11:51,110
Sister, what do you want? Go away...

1109
01:11:52,948 --> 01:11:53,896
Close the door..

1110
01:11:56,192 --> 01:11:58,720
Can't do a better setting than this.

1111
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,968
Cameras are off, what else can I do?

1112
01:12:02,272 --> 01:12:04,629
Sent the nurse inside, you
want me to throw a party now?

1113
01:12:04,997 --> 01:12:08,370
Don't take much time.
Finish it in five minutes.

1114
01:12:08,378 --> 01:12:09,258
I'm leaving.

1115
01:12:47,411 --> 01:12:49,423
-Hey!
[bullet bursts]

1116
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:55,019
I shot them...

1117
01:12:55,763 --> 01:12:58,954
...guess there are too many tales
to tell my children to be.

1118
01:12:59,474 --> 01:13:04,479
"Dad got hit by a truck,
got thrown on a bus and still survived,"

1119
01:13:05,036 --> 01:13:07,836
"hit two people who came with knives..."

1120
01:13:08,561 --> 01:13:11,328
"I threw a cop down a flight of stairs."

1121
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:13,152
"Don't even know what happened to him..."

1122
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:17,420
With his gun, I shot two scumbags.

1123
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,841
But then I thought, it's not the kind
of bedtime story you tell children.

1124
01:13:21,162 --> 01:13:25,545
You can't tell kids that "Daddy's
hands actually held a gun once"?

1125
01:13:25,849 --> 01:13:29,578
Actually Kids, close your eyes from now.

1126
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:32,136
[bullet bursts]

1127
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:46,740
They tried to kill us.
[crying]

1128
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:49,268
Check if he is ok.

1129
01:13:50,241 --> 01:13:52,771
Check if he is breathing...

1130
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,161
-Please call the nurse.
-It's ok, just stay calm.

1131
01:14:02,263 --> 01:14:05,301
-We need to call the nurse!
-You just calm down.

1132
01:14:09,497 --> 01:14:10,518
-Are they dead?
-Hey! Wait.

1133
01:14:11,318 --> 01:14:12,176
Did you kill them?

1134
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:16,528
Bro, nothing happened, just calm down!

1135
01:14:17,532 --> 01:14:19,347
Yes! I killed them!

1136
01:14:19,523 --> 01:14:21,040
If I didn't kill them,
they would've killed us.

1137
01:14:21,548 --> 01:14:22,448
What should I do?

1138
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,237
They would kill you,
me, Leela and everyone.

1139
01:14:25,329 --> 01:14:26,658
-Do you want me to stay calm?
-Bro, you took the police officers gun.

1140
01:14:26,915 --> 01:14:28,056
Leela, where is Leela?

1141
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:31,064
-I locked Leela in the room.
-Is Leela okay?

1142
01:14:31,505 --> 01:14:33,683
Sir, sir, you can't do this.

1143
01:14:33,939 --> 01:14:35,736
-Sir, please listen to me.
-We don't have a choice.

1144
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,166
Mom are you ok?

1145
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:50,497
Bro, he doesn't have much
time we can see that.

1146
01:14:51,352 --> 01:14:52,982
-Close the glass.
-what is our plan now?

1147
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:54,032
Are we going to their house?

1148
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:55,406
Honestly,

1149
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,030
I don't know anything.

1150
01:14:58,686 --> 01:15:00,905
All I know is, we'd have died
if we remained at the hospital.

1151
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:03,152
There would have been more of them.

1152
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:05,521
And there was the cop, too.

1153
01:15:06,805 --> 01:15:09,916
Isn't there one good person
in the police department?

1154
01:15:09,992 --> 01:15:11,038
There must be.

1155
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:13,243
Let's take them home?

1156
01:15:13,971 --> 01:15:16,923
It'll be the same situation there, too.

1157
01:15:17,224 --> 01:15:19,230
We'll take them to another hospital.

1158
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:22,992
-Check the nearest town on your phone.
-Yes, I know.

1159
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:25,404
Kara.. varan.. no it's Belgaum.

1160
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:26,532
-It's one and a half hour from here.
-Are you sure?

1161
01:15:26,624 --> 01:15:27,168
Sure.

1162
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:30,754
Let's go to the Police Station
there and tell them what happened.

1163
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:34,365
With their help we'll
admit him in some hospital.

1164
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:36,326
Hope he will be alive till then!

1165
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:37,563
You shot two guys.

1166
01:15:38,182 --> 01:15:40,183
How will you explain
them about the incident?

1167
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:41,226
Will they believe us?

1168
01:15:41,498 --> 01:15:43,687
-Will they understand us?
-We will explain clearly!

1169
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,125
-Bro, please.
-Hey!

1170
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:48,908
Now you need the vehicle to go up to
your home. I'll drop you till there!

1171
01:15:49,451 --> 01:15:52,363
It will take four hours!
I don't have their permission!

1172
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:54,959
We told him till Leela's home.
Now see what he is saying...

1173
01:15:56,676 --> 01:15:57,637
Go, go.

1174
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,258
What is he saying? Will he
give the vehicle or not?

1175
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,840
[bullet bursts]
[tires screeching]

1176
01:16:09,574 --> 01:16:11,318
What happened?

1177
01:16:13,543 --> 01:16:14,695
-Mahesh! what's happening!
-Hey, Pull!

1178
01:16:14,795 --> 01:16:16,534
[tires screeching]

1179
01:16:17,633 --> 01:16:19,193
Bro, hold it.

1180
01:16:19,513 --> 01:16:22,649
Hey! He is dead.

1181
01:16:24,049 --> 01:16:26,419
What happening.

1182
01:16:27,345 --> 01:16:29,373
Hey hold him.

1183
01:16:31,707 --> 01:16:32,311
[tires screeching]

1184
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:33,746
We rammed over him.

1185
01:16:34,486 --> 01:16:37,458
Poor guy...
Bro, he is really dead.

1186
01:16:47,976 --> 01:16:48,947
Who are they?

1187
01:16:49,047 --> 01:16:52,494
-They are hitting us from behind.
-Why are they hitting from behind?

1188
01:16:52,793 --> 01:16:53,570
Careful Leela!

1189
01:16:53,874 --> 01:16:56,200
Bro, keep going...

1190
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,922
-Bro, there are coming this way.
-To your right, right!

1191
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:16,954
-Hey what happened?
-Super bro.

1192
01:17:18,729 --> 01:17:21,096
-Bro, look. The vehicle rollover.
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

1193
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:24,815
-Leela, we are ok.
-Bro, take left let's go on the highway.

1194
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:28,969
Bro, do you know driving?
when did you learn?

1195
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,547
Bro, vehicle!

1196
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,971
[ambulance siren]

1197
01:17:38,171 --> 01:17:39,473
Move everyone out of that.

1198
01:17:42,853 --> 01:17:43,728
Get down!

1199
01:17:44,112 --> 01:17:47,145
Get down!

1200
01:17:50,543 --> 01:17:52,127
Come.
Get down.

1201
01:17:52,407 --> 01:17:54,589
So it's you.
See what I will do to them.

1202
01:17:55,156 --> 01:17:55,956
Hey! Bring them.

1203
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,017
Please... please.
[fighting sound]

1204
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:00,911
Go.

1205
01:18:02,855 --> 01:18:05,175
1, 2, 3, 4..

1206
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:07,162
Oh, the old man is inside.

1207
01:18:07,586 --> 01:18:09,015
Anyway he is dead.

1208
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,887
Sit on your knees...

1209
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:13,022
Sit!

1210
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:15,318
-Sir, please.
-Put your hands behind.

1211
01:18:15,936 --> 01:18:17,124
Please, please.

1212
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:20,060
Shall I tell you again? Sit.

1213
01:18:22,437 --> 01:18:23,271
Put your hands behind.

1214
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:26,513
Are you Leela?

1215
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,710
We planned to kill you.

1216
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:31,868
He came in between and we missed you.

1217
01:18:32,187 --> 01:18:34,492
"Bang"! I could just shoot you.

1218
01:18:34,644 --> 01:18:36,776
Hey! Is he alive?

1219
01:18:37,032 --> 01:18:38,255
Remove the life support, everything!

1220
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:40,581
-Go!
-No sir, please sir.

1221
01:18:43,046 --> 01:18:44,162
Please nurse.

1222
01:18:44,289 --> 01:18:46,252
-Don't hurt them please.
-How are they related to you?

1223
01:18:46,547 --> 01:18:47,841
-Nurse...
-You feel so much for them.

1224
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:51,919
Is she your girlfriend or still trying?

1225
01:18:52,668 --> 01:18:54,159
You killed my men at the hospital right?

1226
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:56,559
My foot!
Can I shoot you down first?

1227
01:18:57,197 --> 01:18:58,737
Shall I?

1228
01:18:59,224 --> 01:19:01,034
Please don't hurt him sir.

1229
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:03,938
You disconnected everything?

1230
01:19:04,586 --> 01:19:05,410
You can leave.

1231
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:09,270
You have nothing to do with this.
You saw nothing.

1232
01:19:15,121 --> 01:19:16,377
-Why did you kill the nurse?
-Why did you kill the nurse?

1233
01:19:17,226 --> 01:19:20,171
You didn't understand? If any police
officer is here he should know...

1234
01:19:20,475 --> 01:19:21,577
...that you killed everyone.

1235
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:25,054
Him, her mother and father too...

1236
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:25,609
Okay?

1237
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:26,568
So...

1238
01:19:27,403 --> 01:19:30,955
Hold this tight,
leave your print on this for me.

1239
01:19:32,211 --> 01:19:34,313
Then shoot yourself.
Okay?

1240
01:19:34,785 --> 01:19:35,722
Here, hold the gun.

1241
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:36,956
Even I will hold...

1242
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,657
Doesn't mean I will give you the gun.

1243
01:19:39,729 --> 01:19:40,314
Take.

1244
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:42,787
You barged into the scene like a hero!

1245
01:19:43,026 --> 01:19:44,066
Now you kill your people.

1246
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,244
-Take this.
-I don't want this gun.

1247
01:19:46,296 --> 01:19:46,744
What!

1248
01:19:47,177 --> 01:19:47,892
I don't want.

1249
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:48,706
What?

1250
01:19:48,778 --> 01:19:50,426
-I don't want that gun.
-You got to kill them! Take it...

1251
01:19:50,867 --> 01:19:53,252
I don't want your gun!
I have my gun!

1252
01:19:55,812 --> 01:19:57,005
Run you scoundrels!
Else you're dead!

1253
01:20:02,505 --> 01:20:05,260
-Come on!
-Hey Bro!

1254
01:20:05,436 --> 01:20:07,019
-Super bro, that was too good.
-Come you idiots!

1255
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,973
I will shoot you down, scoundrels!
- Super bro...

1256
01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:12,043
Check if her father is alive or not.

1257
01:20:13,122 --> 01:20:14,524
Leela are you ok?

1258
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:16,546
Let's go mother...

1259
01:20:20,998 --> 01:20:22,801
-Is she okay?
-She is alive.

1260
01:20:23,811 --> 01:20:25,839
-Just because of me...
-Bro, Is he dead?

1261
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:28,834
Go check, go...

1262
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:31,045
Be silent.
How many are there?

1263
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:33,182
-How many are there?
-Five of them escaped.

1264
01:20:33,282 --> 01:20:35,412
Let's get out of here before they come...

1265
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:36,932
That's correct,
we need to go hide somewhere.

1266
01:20:37,456 --> 01:20:39,465
Shall we go in Ambulance?
There is one place.

1267
01:20:40,573 --> 01:20:42,349
Doctor Yashwanth, I know them.

1268
01:20:42,449 --> 01:20:43,990
-Family friend, we'll go there.
-Okay.

1269
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:45,811
-Shall I call them?
-Okay, just call him.

1270
01:20:46,011 --> 01:20:48,003
[vehicle arriving]

1271
01:20:56,344 --> 01:20:57,331
-Atul.
-Hi, Leela.

1272
01:20:57,903 --> 01:20:58,953
-Are you okay?
-Did you tell uncle?

1273
01:20:59,257 --> 01:21:01,177
-About everything...
-He is out will be back soon.

1274
01:21:05,306 --> 01:21:06,665
-What happened?
-Uncle, see what happened...

1275
01:21:06,865 --> 01:21:07,774
Atul go and get wheel chair.

1276
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:11,427
-Doctor please check.
-Do not worry.

1277
01:21:11,535 --> 01:21:12,405
How can this happened?

1278
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,803
-Oh, God!
-How is he uncle?

1279
01:21:15,243 --> 01:21:15,970
-Atul!
-There won't be any problem, right?

1280
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:22,925
You don't worry he will be fine.

1281
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,036
She is badly wounded Leela.

1282
01:21:42,026 --> 01:21:42,725
Is it paining?

1283
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:44,595
What is with you leg?

1284
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:46,405
That road was full of stones.

1285
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:48,860
-Leave it.
-Look at your legs without shoes.

1286
01:21:49,147 --> 01:21:50,044
Bro, Go sit.

1287
01:21:50,128 --> 01:21:52,627
-My hand is paining.
-Sit for a while.

1288
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:55,794
She needs to rest, come.

1289
01:21:57,791 --> 01:22:00,540
I have removed the bullet,
but the nurse is critical.

1290
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:03,077
Your father is very critical too.

1291
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:05,782
We must shift him
somewhere for a better care.

1292
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:07,915
And I think...

1293
01:22:08,284 --> 01:22:10,268
It's better we get the
police involved in this.

1294
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:11,936
-Sir, no sir.
-Please...

1295
01:22:12,175 --> 01:22:13,450
Please listen to me...

1296
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:15,114
I know your concerns...

1297
01:22:15,434 --> 01:22:18,122
But see whatever you had
done, it was self-defence.

1298
01:22:18,243 --> 01:22:19,672
They will understand, don't worry.

1299
01:22:20,481 --> 01:22:21,085
Come on!

1300
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:22,803
There are some good police officers.

1301
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,956
I have some good people
in police department whom I know.

1302
01:22:26,228 --> 01:22:27,208
I'll talk to them.

1303
01:22:27,512 --> 01:22:29,282
ASP Devanshu, he's there.

1304
01:22:38,013 --> 01:22:39,290
Don't call the police.

1305
01:22:40,224 --> 01:22:41,894
Here they don't act like cops.

1306
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:44,476
Listen to me...

1307
01:22:45,176 --> 01:22:46,109
He will tell anything...

1308
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:48,859
But how can we talk
with people like that.

1309
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:51,433
Once we step in, anything might happen.

1310
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:55,111
You already bumped off two or three guys.

1311
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:57,888
And he wanted you to kill everyone.

1312
01:22:58,535 --> 01:23:00,021
We'll call dad and tell him everything.

1313
01:23:05,349 --> 01:23:06,591
What do I tell him and
how much do I tell him.

1314
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,077
That too on phone.

1315
01:23:08,413 --> 01:23:11,238
I should start telling them
that I'm with Leela...

1316
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:15,800
What can we do bro?

1317
01:23:18,831 --> 01:23:22,080
We spent our lives playing
and roaming around, like a bunch of kids.

1318
01:23:23,076 --> 01:23:26,075
Suddenly, it feels as though
a decade has passed.

1319
01:23:26,347 --> 01:23:27,564
I feel like a man.

1320
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:29,581
Anything might happen.

1321
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:34,523
Come what may...
I feel like I can face it all.

1322
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:40,615
We're not cops,
thugs or gangsters either.

1323
01:23:42,415 --> 01:23:44,860
We've never encountered violence
in our lives before.

1324
01:23:47,395 --> 01:23:52,172
There was just this small fight
when I hit someone for Maitreyi.

1325
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,893
And I thought that was it. That I'd
lead a normal life, like everyone else.

1326
01:23:58,959 --> 01:24:00,967
But that was then...
anything can happen in life.

1327
01:24:02,935 --> 01:24:06,566
The question is...
are we ready for it?

1328
01:24:13,634 --> 01:24:16,839
I have a gun in my hand today.
Two, actually.

1329
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:19,125
I've shot a few people.

1330
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,847
Why do we need guns now?

1331
01:24:36,759 --> 01:24:38,740
we have reached this safe place.

1332
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:40,463
Yeah, Yeah.

1333
01:24:41,035 --> 01:24:42,804
We'll surrender it the
moment cops arrive here.

1334
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:44,468
We don't need it anymore.

1335
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,224
I am sorry!

1336
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,057
I'm so sorry, it's such a mess.

1337
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:51,302
It's all because of me,
you should never have come here.

1338
01:24:53,326 --> 01:24:56,229
This isn't your fault. Stop crying.

1339
01:24:57,958 --> 01:24:59,639
I was able to help you.

1340
01:25:00,411 --> 01:25:02,041
Maybe, that's why we even met.

1341
01:25:04,187 --> 01:25:05,265
You staying in my home..

1342
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:07,240
...our meeting!

1343
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:10,171
Coming on the road trip with me...

1344
01:25:12,002 --> 01:25:13,650
Everything happens for a reason.

1345
01:25:14,754 --> 01:25:16,018
And love.

1346
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:22,363
After the accident,
I was scared that I'd die.

1347
01:25:25,244 --> 01:25:26,810
That's why I told you I love you.

1348
01:25:31,705 --> 01:25:34,249
Bad timing, I know...

1349
01:25:35,393 --> 01:25:36,874
But what I said was right.

1350
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,468
At some point during the road trip...

1351
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:42,985
not only in my head...

1352
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:47,169
you are connected to my heart.

1353
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:53,829
This timing is not great either, eh?

1354
01:25:55,748 --> 01:25:57,266
But the stuff I'm saying is correct.

1355
01:25:58,393 --> 01:26:00,318
Love you, bro.

1356
01:26:01,081 --> 01:26:02,406
Our timing is correct bro.

1357
01:26:05,711 --> 01:26:07,937
Leela! What are you doing here?

1358
01:26:08,177 --> 01:26:10,145
Come inside, there is nothing to worry.

1359
01:26:10,809 --> 01:26:13,765
I will tell the police exactly what
happened and how you helped the family.

1360
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:16,004
So don't worry, by the way
you didn't tell me your name.

1361
01:26:16,245 --> 01:26:18,107
-Dad, I'll just switch on the motor...
-What happened?

1362
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:24,204
There is no water in the tap.
[vehicle arriving]

1363
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:36,809
Let me talk to them.

1364
01:26:57,966 --> 01:27:01,146
That's it! I don't want to hear anything.

1365
01:27:01,677 --> 01:27:02,571
Just get into the jeep.

1366
01:27:03,002 --> 01:27:06,395
You hit a cop and stole his gun!

1367
01:27:06,451 --> 01:27:08,931
And it's still in your hand, come!
Sit in the jeep!

1368
01:27:09,003 --> 01:27:10,796
Gun give.

1369
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:12,626
Is he the good officer
you were talking about.

1370
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:16,286
No, no. I spoke to the Control
Room. Asked for A.S.P Devanshu.

1371
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,255
Hey! Devanshu has sent me.

1372
01:27:18,559 --> 01:27:19,681
Don't annoy me...

1373
01:27:19,952 --> 01:27:22,701
Uncle! You're getting into big trouble.

1374
01:27:22,772 --> 01:27:25,979
These guys dirty fellows!
All bad fellows.

1375
01:27:26,203 --> 01:27:31,565
Now let's go, you can annoy me
in the jeep. [vehicle arriving]

1376
01:27:33,944 --> 01:27:36,944
Now, watch the fun unfold.
Now see!

1377
01:27:44,114 --> 01:27:45,621
Dude, it's that guy again.

1378
01:27:46,365 --> 01:27:48,025
Bro, I told you that he didn't die.

1379
01:27:54,613 --> 01:27:56,657
Mahesh! Take them inside.

1380
01:27:56,946 --> 01:27:58,063
Go! Go, go...

1381
01:27:58,353 --> 01:28:02,410
You screwed up, now they
are pointing guns at us.

1382
01:28:03,262 --> 01:28:04,739
Hey! Go and sit in the vehicle.

1383
01:28:05,422 --> 01:28:08,521
Hey hero! how many times do I have to
tell you to come and sit in the vehicle?

1384
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:12,652
Atul... do you know them?

1385
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:14,304
What is he doing with them?

1386
01:28:16,893 --> 01:28:19,144
He almost shot me in the head...

1387
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:21,145
-Would have blown my brains out.
-Leela...

1388
01:28:21,956 --> 01:28:23,985
-Dad...
-Atul, what are you doing?

1389
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:26,418
-Doctor ask them to leave.
-Atul this is wrong.

1390
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:28,316
Throw the gun.

1391
01:28:33,452 --> 01:28:34,608
Doctor you go inside.

1392
01:28:34,944 --> 01:28:37,407
-You come inside.
-You go inside.

1393
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:38,488
Go! Go and lock it.

1394
01:28:42,475 --> 01:28:45,452
-Go inside.
-Bro, we are safe here.

1395
01:28:47,527 --> 01:28:49,079
Doctor,
are you with us or with them?

1396
01:28:49,135 --> 01:28:51,504
I am with you, didn't I help you...

1397
01:28:51,644 --> 01:28:53,279
-Didn't I save nurses life?
-Okay.

1398
01:28:53,468 --> 01:28:55,355
Ok! Is there a back door?
Is the back door open?

1399
01:28:55,395 --> 01:28:57,484
I locked it myself. Is there any other
way to the house they can get in?

1400
01:28:57,536 --> 01:28:58,690
Are you sure you locked it...

1401
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:00,749
Is the balcony there in the upstairs?

1402
01:29:00,991 --> 01:29:01,614
-What happened?
-Doctor, he is not breathing.

1403
01:29:03,592 --> 01:29:05,769
Bro, please take him inside...
Doctor, please go.

1404
01:29:15,406 --> 01:29:17,409
[bullet bursts]
[people screaming]

1405
01:29:17,509 --> 01:29:18,473
Go inside.
[bullet bursts]

1406
01:29:19,575 --> 01:29:21,706
Open the door uncle.
[indistinct people chattering]

1407
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,543
-Oh my God!
-Dad, go inside.

1408
01:29:24,551 --> 01:29:27,162
Atul! Why are you killing these innocent
people? [indistinct people chattering]

1409
01:29:27,618 --> 01:29:30,051
-Why are you doing this?
-Where is he?

1410
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:34,155
[indistinct people chattering]

1411
01:29:34,593 --> 01:29:36,941
Mahesh! Shucks!

1412
01:29:37,248 --> 01:29:37,893
Mahesh!

1413
01:29:40,033 --> 01:29:40,637
Mahesh!

1414
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:48,395
Oh God!
Do not know what is happening here?

1415
01:29:53,615 --> 01:29:56,458
Leela! Leela stay there.

1416
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:58,206
I will come just stay there.

1417
01:29:58,234 --> 01:29:59,345
-Do not come outside.
-No... no.

1418
01:29:59,445 --> 01:30:00,920
[indistinct people chattering]

1419
01:30:01,537 --> 01:30:04,449
My hands are itchy...
tell your dad to go inside.

1420
01:30:04,688 --> 01:30:05,852
I'm going to call police.

1421
01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:08,863
Uncle, line is not working.
[indistinct people chattering]

1422
01:30:09,063 --> 01:30:11,279
-Hello...
[indistinct people chattering]

1423
01:30:11,379 --> 01:30:13,041
Atul, you're making a very big mistake.

1424
01:30:14,747 --> 01:30:18,507
They shot my mother.
[indistinct people chattering]

1425
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:22,857
Leela! Leela!

1426
01:30:23,097 --> 01:30:26,238
-What happened Leela?
-They came suddenly shot from a window.

1427
01:30:26,438 --> 01:30:28,538
Mahesh pushed me aside.

1428
01:30:30,251 --> 01:30:32,612
Someone shot mahesh.

1429
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:38,999
Doctor is he alive?

1430
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:40,519
They're all dead.

1431
01:30:41,503 --> 01:30:43,272
What can a doctor say,
I will tell you I'm MBBS.

1432
01:30:47,468 --> 01:30:48,123
Leela!

1433
01:30:56,145 --> 01:31:00,105
-Don't go please...
-I'll be back in a moment.

1434
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:02,985
Hey, shoot him.

1435
01:31:05,072 --> 01:31:06,608
He switched off the lights.

1436
01:31:07,824 --> 01:31:13,457
[bullet bursts]

1437
01:31:13,657 --> 01:31:15,701
[indistinct people chattering]

1438
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:18,416
Come inside.

1439
01:31:23,005 --> 01:31:23,742
Go go!

1440
01:31:27,307 --> 01:31:27,961
Hey!

1441
01:31:31,497 --> 01:31:33,550
He didn't come out, you
go to the other side.

1442
01:31:33,774 --> 01:31:34,701
I'll come from this way.

1443
01:31:40,147 --> 01:31:41,299
We must go from here.

1444
01:31:41,507 --> 01:31:42,621
No! Listen!

1445
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:44,344
-I don't know mom and dad's condition.
-This is our only chance to get out.

1446
01:31:44,544 --> 01:31:46,472
We are not going to die here... It's ok.

1447
01:31:47,312 --> 01:31:48,185
Hey! I'm not gonna die here...

1448
01:31:48,377 --> 01:31:49,578
Listen, I'm not gonna die here.

1449
01:31:49,786 --> 01:31:51,759
We'll come back from them, just trust me.

1450
01:31:51,768 --> 01:31:54,642
No, no, we'll come back for them.
Okay? Just come.

1451
01:32:17,059 --> 01:32:19,375
I told you that I would kill
you if I caught you.

1452
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:20,370
Die!

1453
01:32:28,098 --> 01:32:29,730
What do I do?
It's not working

1454
01:32:30,432 --> 01:32:31,345
It's not working!

1455
01:32:48,464 --> 01:32:49,272
Take the gun.

1456
01:33:30,959 --> 01:33:35,011
[motorcycle starts]

1457
01:33:43,681 --> 01:33:49,563
[motorcycle moving]

1458
01:34:24,436 --> 01:34:25,753
Suddenly, I got an idea.

1459
01:34:26,355 --> 01:34:28,376
We should not run for fear..

1460
01:34:29,383 --> 01:34:31,261
Fear should run away by seeing us.

1461
01:34:32,684 --> 01:34:34,447
Leela! I am taking 'u' turn.

1462
01:34:43,861 --> 01:34:44,670
What happened?

1463
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:47,641
[vehicle moving]

1464
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:54,282
So pissedoff.

1465
01:34:57,057 --> 01:34:59,785
All this is done with the help of cops.

1466
01:35:00,776 --> 01:35:02,680
This is the biggest the
mistake in their life.

1467
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,556
The cops who have to
protect us are doing so.

1468
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:11,964
Mahesh!

1469
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:15,659
Mahesh!

1470
01:35:19,594 --> 01:35:21,210
Your mom! Your dad,

1471
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:23,211
My bike...

1472
01:35:26,237 --> 01:35:27,852
That nurse, you!

1473
01:35:29,148 --> 01:35:30,801
They're fearless.

1474
01:35:34,626 --> 01:35:37,893
I'm not afraid either.
They'll lock me up anyway.

1475
01:35:39,506 --> 01:35:41,235
I don't give a damn.
We'll see it through. No matter what.

1476
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:47,200
It's only hard to die
when you've seen too much of life.

1477
01:35:47,752 --> 01:35:49,030
But what did we see?

1478
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:51,618
I don't care.

1479
01:35:55,645 --> 01:35:58,498
Leela,
it's not safe for you to be here.

1480
01:35:59,243 --> 01:36:00,426
I'll drop you somewhere safe.

1481
01:36:01,867 --> 01:36:04,248
But I'm going after them.

1482
01:36:05,289 --> 01:36:07,089
I don't know what I'll do.

1483
01:36:10,289 --> 01:36:11,600
But I'm going back there.

1484
01:36:12,064 --> 01:36:13,961
I need to know
why they did this.

1485
01:36:14,293 --> 01:36:17,748
Else I would stab them all.

1486
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:22,258
They won't know what hit them.

1487
01:36:25,729 --> 01:36:27,334
Tell me where you want to go.

1488
01:36:28,177 --> 01:36:29,594
I'll drop you there.

1489
01:36:30,269 --> 01:36:32,696
No, I'll go with you.

1490
01:36:34,056 --> 01:36:36,631
I'm going Nowhere.
I'll be with you!

1491
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:42,087
I'll come along with you.

1492
01:36:55,522 --> 01:36:58,950
-You cop killed them like a goon!
-Calm down, father!

1493
01:37:01,626 --> 01:37:03,883
-Are you ashamed of yourself?
-Chill.

1494
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:05,994
Your dad is a mad man.

1495
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:07,057
Where is the other madman?

1496
01:37:07,313 --> 01:37:09,345
You can't force me!

1497
01:37:15,926 --> 01:37:16,690
[door moving]

1498
01:37:39,091 --> 01:37:41,551
-I know the commissioner!
-Sure, go to the commissioner.

1499
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,759
-You're talking too much, uncle.
-Oh, shut up.

[indistinct people chattering]
[vehicle moving]

1501
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,406
Dad please listen to me.

1502
01:38:16,658 --> 01:38:18,257
-I'll explain you everything. Let's go.
-You are forcing me.

1503
01:38:19,611 --> 01:38:20,483
I'll slap you!
[indistinct chanting]

1504
01:38:23,877 --> 01:38:24,829
[motorcycle arriving]

1505
01:38:39,062 --> 01:38:39,685
Leela,

1506
01:38:40,521 --> 01:38:44,026
You must either be with me
or I have to do all this without you.

1507
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:46,509
Think one chapter is finished.

1508
01:38:47,101 --> 01:38:50,605
We get time to cry and feel for them!

1509
01:38:51,341 --> 01:38:52,823
Not now! No way.

1510
01:38:53,682 --> 01:38:54,589
I really need you.

1511
01:38:58,549 --> 01:39:00,624
We'll take a room okay?
You should be safe first.

1512
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,904
Keep this gun with you... careful.

1513
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,568
Okay? Use if necessary.

1514
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:11,167
It's okay. It will be fine.
I'll keep it in the bag.

1515
01:39:11,255 --> 01:39:12,883
No one should see you, keep low.

1516
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:13,777
Okay?

1517
01:39:14,247 --> 01:39:15,768
Call me once you get in the room.

1518
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,424
Call on Mahesh's number
and tell me which room.

1519
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,058
I'll be back in five minutes okay?

1520
01:39:19,258 --> 01:39:20,186
Mahesh's number is in your phone.

1521
01:39:20,326 --> 01:39:21,338
Ask one room for one day.

1522
01:39:21,594 --> 01:39:23,180
Tell then it's single occupancy.
Okay?

1523
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:27,708
Cover your face. Don't worry.

1524
01:39:28,612 --> 01:39:32,459
They went inside, they won't see you.

1525
01:39:32,559 --> 01:39:34,333
-I'm frightened.
-It's ok, you will be fine, go.

1526
01:39:49,183 --> 01:39:51,083
A plan was wandering in my mind.

1527
01:39:51,467 --> 01:39:53,772
We should identify Atul and doctors room.

1528
01:39:54,144 --> 01:39:58,067
If we talk with Atul,
we will know the truth.

1529
01:40:05,154 --> 01:40:07,627
It's a good thing your mother
didn't live to see this.

1530
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:11,052
She couldn't have taken this!
What's become of you?

1531
01:40:11,108 --> 01:40:12,436
Why did you kill them?

1532
01:40:12,739 --> 01:40:15,163
You killed them in our house!
My house!

1533
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:18,606
-I am a doctor, I save lives.
-Clam down...

01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:30,760
[vehicle arriving]

1535
01:40:35,417 --> 01:40:37,650
Look at me, relax okay?

1536
01:40:37,938 --> 01:40:39,816
-Calm down.
-This is all because of your fault.

1537
01:40:40,499 --> 01:40:42,019
There's a big problem!
Okay?

1538
01:40:42,673 --> 01:40:46,164
Kamath will be here.
I'm only asking for ten minutes.

1539
01:40:46,628 --> 01:40:48,123
Stay here. Please!
Don't go anywhere.

1540
01:40:48,523 --> 01:40:54,436
[indistinct people chattering]

1541
01:41:03,226 --> 01:41:04,475
Kamath sir, you are coming right?

1542
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:07,331
My father is furious.
He needs to know what's happening.

1543
01:41:07,588 --> 01:41:09,555
Shall I pass the phone to my dad?
You'll talk to him?

1544
01:41:22,594 --> 01:41:24,483
-Dad!
-Hey Atul!

1545
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:32,181
Doctor!

1546
01:41:40,988 --> 01:41:43,878
What are you up to? Tell me!

1547
01:42:12,862 --> 01:42:16,817
I'll gun you down...
Already used it a couple of times!

1548
01:42:16,873 --> 01:42:18,273
Why did you kill all those people?

1549
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:19,724
who are you guys!

1550
01:42:23,196 --> 01:42:24,005
I'm gonna kill you...

1551
01:42:30,516 --> 01:42:31,151
Hey you!

1552
01:43:13,975 --> 01:43:14,644
Take it!

1553
01:43:16,569 --> 01:43:17,308
Take that too.

1554
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:21,360
Every matter in our life
does not run as we plan.

1555
01:43:21,811 --> 01:43:25,724
But some matters run very alarmingly..

1556
01:43:35,386 --> 01:43:37,920
Leela!
Come out of the room with the bag...

1557
01:43:38,655 --> 01:43:39,394
Don't forget anything.

1558
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:41,422
But it's all over.

1559
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,198
Except for the cop...

1560
01:43:43,514 --> 01:43:45,327
You come out from there.

1561
01:43:48,315 --> 01:43:49,940
Don't worry. Just don't worry!

1562
01:43:50,373 --> 01:43:52,542
You come out. Let's go from here.

1563
01:43:52,829 --> 01:43:54,499
There was a gunshot sound from this room.

1564
01:43:54,587 --> 01:43:57,325
[indistinct people
chattering] Open the door.

1565
01:43:57,561 --> 01:43:58,809
Let's see what is inside.

1566
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:00,105
Where are you?

1567
01:44:01,635 --> 01:44:02,373
Come, Come..

1568
01:44:12,798 --> 01:44:13,808
Come on, come fast.

1569
01:44:20,441 --> 01:44:20,860
Leela!

1570
01:44:24,122 --> 01:44:26,110
-Come with me...
-Why should I come with you?

1571
01:44:26,463 --> 01:44:28,942
You killed my parents and
killed my friend too. Shh...

1572
01:44:29,142 --> 01:44:30,203
-Go to hell.
-Hey! Come with me.

1573
01:44:30,403 --> 01:44:32,838
-You're a murderer
-Where will you go?

1574
01:44:32,938 --> 01:44:34,493
[motorcycle arriving]
-Come!

1575
01:44:40,929 --> 01:44:42,287
Leela, get on the bike!

1576
01:44:43,712 --> 01:44:44,929
I'll kill you!

1577
01:44:47,456 --> 01:44:49,787
No... Don't he is a police officer.

1578
01:44:50,104 --> 01:44:52,171
No!

1579
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:54,008
Go.

1580
01:45:08,859 --> 01:45:10,668
It's nothing.
Just some drunkard!

1581
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:13,231
There's some issue upstairs, go check.

1582
01:45:13,615 --> 01:45:14,060
Go upstairs!

1583
01:45:15,381 --> 01:45:17,497
Hello.. yes, Kamath speaking.

1584
01:45:17,758 --> 01:45:18,668
Note down the vehicle number.

1585
01:45:19,084 --> 01:45:21,546
MH102545
A bearded guy...

1586
01:45:21,939 --> 01:45:23,307
Going towards Balki Chowk...

1587
01:45:23,764 --> 01:45:25,724
Find him and bring him
straight to the guest house.

1588
01:45:26,012 --> 01:45:27,118
Don't take them to the Police station.

1589
01:45:27,803 --> 01:45:29,004
What's going on here?

1590
01:45:29,596 --> 01:45:31,198
Out of the way! Move!

1591
01:45:31,206 --> 01:45:31,726
-Move!
-Get out!

1592
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:34,819
-Check everything properly.
-Son of a...!

1593
01:45:39,186 --> 01:45:41,832
[train honking]

1594
01:46:11,515 --> 01:46:12,278
Cry, Leela.

1595
01:46:15,322 --> 01:46:16,289
Cry till you get off!

1596
01:46:18,721 --> 01:46:19,638
We have a lot of time.

1597
01:46:21,021 --> 01:46:21,771
I'm sorry.

1598
01:46:23,485 --> 01:46:26,923
It all happened in a second.

1599
01:46:28,408 --> 01:46:32,129
If I could do this... and change
everything in a second, I would!

1600
01:46:32,946 --> 01:46:34,639
Forgive me, Leela.

1601
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:37,679
I thought we'll be killed
if we stayed at the hospital.

1602
01:46:39,087 --> 01:46:40,115
So I brought him out..

1603
01:46:43,488 --> 01:46:44,556
But they got killed anyway.

1604
01:46:45,812 --> 01:46:46,864
I am sorry!

1605
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:54,054
It's my fault. I'm responsible.
You're not responsible for this.

1606
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,286
If you were not there...

1607
01:46:58,451 --> 01:46:59,574
Mahesh is dead.

1608
01:47:02,228 --> 01:47:03,838
He came here for me.

1609
01:47:05,855 --> 01:47:08,020
Everything changed in a second!

1610
01:47:10,150 --> 01:47:10,987
He is dead.

1611
01:47:12,278 --> 01:47:15,115
He's twenty, Leela!
He is just twenty.

1612
01:47:19,483 --> 01:47:20,930
If I go to his home...

1613
01:47:22,162 --> 01:47:24,011
...what do I tell his parents?

1614
01:47:27,467 --> 01:47:29,269
How will I even
step into his house?

1615
01:48:00,326 --> 01:48:02,445
No, no! Don't. He is a police officer.

1616
01:48:03,172 --> 01:48:04,274
Let's Go!

1617
01:48:15,602 --> 01:48:17,642
Wow! You guys are hiding here?

1618
01:48:20,236 --> 01:48:21,777
I know what you are going to do.

1619
01:48:22,951 --> 01:48:25,063
Where's the gun?
Where, where, where?

1620
01:48:25,258 --> 01:48:25,956
I threw it away.

1621
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:27,014
Do not have it?

1622
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:28,947
Your guy speaks too much English.

1623
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:31,768
Where is it?
Where?

1624
01:48:32,483 --> 01:48:34,628
-Somewhere on the way.
-Somewhere?

1625
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:35,676
Okay..

1626
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,389
What's this?

1627
01:48:46,109 --> 01:48:47,172
And you said you don't have it?

1628
01:48:55,573 --> 01:48:56,755
I'm shooting your boy down!

1629
01:48:58,292 --> 01:49:00,236
Did you see my target.

1630
01:49:41,678 --> 01:49:44,029
Die!

1631
01:49:49,404 --> 01:49:52,155
Leela, Oh God!
Leela, please look at me.

1632
01:49:54,241 --> 01:49:57,752
He shot Leela...

1633
01:49:58,449 --> 01:50:00,462
But I couldn't kill him.

1634
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:04,572
Just because he is a police officer
and I'm a common man...

1635
01:50:05,746 --> 01:50:07,420
To pull that trigger...

1636
01:50:42,767 --> 01:50:44,044
Please open the door...
She is sick!

1637
01:50:47,356 --> 01:50:49,546
-Sir, what happened?
-One minute, Leela, Leela.

1638
01:50:51,351 --> 01:50:55,415
She is badly hurt. I need to go to
the hospital. Where is the hospital?

1639
01:50:57,659 --> 01:51:00,091
Get out of my vehicle.
[indistinct people chattering]

1640
01:51:18,408 --> 01:51:19,950
Leela! Leela! Just hang on! Okay!

1641
01:51:20,582 --> 01:51:22,228
Nothing will happen! Just hold on!

1642
01:51:26,874 --> 01:51:29,892
Don't do this! You just go!

1643
01:51:30,165 --> 01:51:31,938
Leela! You just stay on!
We'll go to a doctor!

1644
01:51:32,194 --> 01:51:35,155
Don't do anything for me again.

1645
01:51:36,175 --> 01:51:37,771
Leave me here and go!

1646
01:51:38,332 --> 01:51:41,596
Please! Just stop it!
Let it go!

1647
01:51:43,301 --> 01:51:45,019
You just go away somewhere.

1648
01:51:45,676 --> 01:51:49,808
No way! Leela. This is not just for you!

1649
01:52:10,817 --> 01:52:12,841
Will you please tell me your name,
before I die!

1650
01:52:15,544 --> 01:52:16,726
Please tell me your name!

1651
01:52:17,403 --> 01:52:18,894
I'm not gonna let you die, Leela.

1652
01:52:19,379 --> 01:52:20,746
I am not going to let you die!

1653
01:52:31,686 --> 01:52:32,865
Leela! Just hold on... okay?

1654
01:52:34,097 --> 01:52:38,140
I can't imagine dying without telling
you this. It would be a terrible mistake.

1655
01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:45,146
I don't know if there's
any point in saying it now.

1656
01:52:45,574 --> 01:52:49,011
But I'll say it anyway.

1657
01:52:51,667 --> 01:52:52,143
I love you!

1658
01:52:53,665 --> 01:52:54,638
I love you!

1659
01:52:56,132 --> 01:52:56,798
I love you!

1660
01:52:58,022 --> 01:53:00,288
Actually, I love you too.

1661
01:53:02,117 --> 01:53:04,470
You are my hero now.

1662
01:53:06,278 --> 01:53:09,270
But that's not why I'm telling this...

1663
01:53:12,557 --> 01:53:13,462
Since a long time!

1664
01:53:21,496 --> 01:53:22,513
You know when?

1665
01:53:25,045 --> 01:53:25,643
I know.

1666
01:53:27,627 --> 01:53:28,106
Then tell me.

1667
01:53:28,683 --> 01:53:30,487
In Kanyakumari, at the hotel...

1668
01:53:32,184 --> 01:53:35,515
I told you to use the room
and waited outside.

1669
01:53:36,683 --> 01:53:38,662
-It was then.
-Oh God!

1670
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:42,304
Was it so obvious?

1671
01:53:43,084 --> 01:53:43,613
Yes.

1672
01:53:44,093 --> 01:53:46,903
Yes, I saw it in your eyes.

1673
01:53:47,942 --> 01:53:49,556
There was an expression on your face.

1674
01:53:51,484 --> 01:53:52,379
I knew it for certain!

1675
01:53:53,805 --> 01:53:54,732
That gave me the nerve...

1676
01:53:55,703 --> 01:53:58,386
To tell you while lying on
your lap, on the road...

1677
01:53:58,905 --> 01:54:00,057
But after that...

1678
01:54:00,453 --> 01:54:02,583
...we could not talk again.

1679
01:54:04,966 --> 01:54:06,678
"Don't leave,"

1680
01:54:07,078 --> 01:54:11,756
"never ever my heart and go,"

1681
01:54:12,568 --> 01:54:15,722
"With a deserted heart..."

1682
01:54:16,222 --> 01:54:19,314
"how far should I walk?"

1683
01:54:19,559 --> 01:54:21,140
"Don't leave,"

1684
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:26,522
"never ever my heart and go,"

1685
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:30,252
"With a deserted heart..."

1686
01:54:30,652 --> 01:54:33,797
"how far should I walk?"

1687
01:54:34,023 --> 01:54:36,675
"Don't leave."

1688
01:54:41,857 --> 01:54:45,297
We found two nameless
bodies in Kolapur hotel.

1689
01:54:45,585 --> 01:54:47,910
On the basis of the eyewitness words...

1690
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:54,399
Sir!

1691
01:54:56,587 --> 01:54:58,055
Zoom him! Zoom him!

1692
01:54:58,295 --> 01:54:59,519
Yes... stop! stop!

1693
01:55:00,039 --> 01:55:02,301
I can't see his face.
This footage is useless.

1694
01:55:04,517 --> 01:55:07,156
The cameras in the hospital were shut
too. So no footage there, either.

1695
01:55:08,762 --> 01:55:11,034
Sorry sir, we didn't get any information.

1696
01:55:11,258 --> 01:55:12,220
What will he do?

1697
01:55:12,756 --> 01:55:14,690
Check each and every hospital.

1698
01:55:15,042 --> 01:55:17,352
What will he do with that
girl's dead body? Marry it?

1699
01:55:17,933 --> 01:55:20,969
If the chick is alive, where is she?
In which hospital is she now?

1700
01:55:21,069 --> 01:55:24,433
Anyone who brings that man,
dead or alive... gets a prize!

1701
01:55:24,633 --> 01:55:26,838
One lakh rupees!
Offer valid today and tomorrow.

1702
01:55:27,038 --> 01:55:28,817
And be happy.
No sorrow!

1703
01:55:29,009 --> 01:55:31,700
Mahesh, the boy on the bike.
His father...

1704
01:55:31,956 --> 01:55:32,510
Sir!

1705
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:36,168
Sir! I am Mahesh's father talking!

1706
01:55:36,456 --> 01:55:39,797
Sir, I want my son back.

1707
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:41,873
Wait for one minute and talk to him.

1708
01:55:46,673 --> 01:55:49,277
Few days back, in Kolhapur, Maharastra,

1709
01:55:49,477 --> 01:55:50,477
the cops said that they had
recovered five bodies from an ambulance.

1710
01:55:53,783 --> 01:55:58,078
Social activist Satyamurthy, his
wife, ambulance driver, nurse

1711
01:55:58,102 --> 01:56:02,707
and a 25 year old youth are stated
to have been brutally murdered!

1712
01:56:02,931 --> 01:56:05,916
This horrific incident
has shocked the state.

1713
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:08,105
After the first round of investigation.

1714
01:56:08,362 --> 01:56:13,202
Cops identified that the youth hails
from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.

1715
01:56:13,409 --> 01:56:18,181
When some unidentified thugs tried
to kill Sathyamurthy and his wife...

1716
01:56:18,398 --> 01:56:20,771
====while this boy was
trying to save them...

1717
01:56:20,871 --> 01:56:23,194
====...the cops are trying to figure
it out if he was murdered then.

1718
01:57:12,139 --> 01:57:14,050
-Hello sir.
-Greetings! How are you?

1719
01:57:14,371 --> 01:57:15,207
-Yes.
-A small enquiry.

1720
01:57:15,299 --> 01:57:16,759
Kamath from Kolhapur division.

1721
01:57:18,127 --> 01:57:18,790
Sit.

1722
01:57:19,996 --> 01:57:20,754
How can I help you?

1723
01:57:21,341 --> 01:57:24,413
A case has been filed.

1724
01:57:25,001 --> 01:57:27,208
Mahesh was driving the bike.

1725
01:57:27,381 --> 01:57:29,114
But it's registered under your name.

1726
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:30,618
Mahesh was my son's friend.

1727
01:57:31,186 --> 01:57:33,555
He took our bike with a girl.

1728
01:57:34,379 --> 01:57:35,203
I asked him where he was going...

1729
01:57:35,739 --> 01:57:36,940
They went on a road trip...

1730
01:57:37,212 --> 01:57:39,688
He called me up and informed me
soon after the accident.

1731
01:57:40,089 --> 01:57:40,962
So, what's the big deal?

1732
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:43,311
Big deal? Where?

1733
01:57:43,615 --> 01:57:44,121
Where's your son?

1734
01:57:44,425 --> 01:57:45,492
He's here, at home.

1735
01:57:46,244 --> 01:57:47,167
Your son's name?

1736
01:57:49,401 --> 01:57:50,656
-Name?
-Rajinikanth.

1737
01:57:55,032 --> 01:57:55,884
Rajinikanth?

1738
01:57:56,204 --> 01:57:56,824
Yes.

1739
01:57:59,148 --> 01:58:01,382
Rajinikanth? Good name...

1740
01:58:02,893 --> 01:58:04,114
Rajinikanth?

1741
01:58:05,218 --> 01:58:06,566
Take me for a moron, uncle?

1742
01:58:07,086 --> 01:58:10,043
Don't try to mess with me.
If I start scolding...

1743
01:58:10,379 --> 01:58:12,293
I won't spare your mother or sisters.
Tell him!

1744
01:58:12,645 --> 01:58:13,816
-Sir, if you can call your son...
-One minute!

1745
01:58:14,285 --> 01:58:14,803
Rajini!

1746
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:16,619
Hey... come here.

1747
01:58:19,212 --> 01:58:20,795
My son Rajinikanth.

1748
01:58:25,587 --> 01:58:27,911
-You Rajini?
-Yeah.

1749
01:58:29,652 --> 01:58:31,836
There was one guy with Mahesh...

1750
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:34,373
Sir came in search of him.

1751
01:58:34,561 --> 01:58:38,165
Thank you, uncle.
Thank you.

1752
01:58:46,821 --> 01:58:48,968
-You have been trying from one year!
-We are trying sir!

1753
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:52,084
-Tell me. Where should I transfer you to?
- Sir, I'm sorry...

1754
01:58:52,092 --> 01:58:53,933
Be prepared.
You'll get the transfer order tomorrow.

1755
01:58:53,957 --> 01:58:55,649
Sir, no...

1756
01:58:56,529 --> 01:59:02,230
That mongrel has ruined everything I've
earned in all these years as a policeman!

1757
01:59:02,322 --> 01:59:04,270
I feel like hitting somebody now.

1758
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:10,161
Sir, please leave.
Sir... Sir...

1759
01:59:10,770 --> 01:59:12,697
Come here, come.

1760
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:33,728
These are the details of a new officer
who is going to join the duty today.

1761
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,109
I have urgent work now.

1762
01:59:46,117 --> 01:59:48,028
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing sir!

1763
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,958
Why are you so stressed?
Chill out. [vehicle horn]

1764
01:59:51,058 --> 01:59:55,473
Okay, sir.
[police siren]

1765
01:59:55,773 --> 02:00:01,691
[music]

1766
02:00:12,926 --> 02:00:18,922
"Shokilla... Shokilla... Shokilla..."

1767
02:00:33,608 --> 02:00:37,521
This is the story of how Rajanikanth
became a Police Officer!

1768
02:00:42,589 --> 02:00:43,697
My mom is a huge fan of him.

1769
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:48,155
The moment I was born she named me
Rajanikanth without a second thought!

1770
02:00:48,887 --> 02:00:49,852
Rajinikanth.

1771
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:52,178
There's something
called as 'Yellow Pages'...

1772
02:00:52,876 --> 02:00:55,927
If you see it there will
be many Rajinikanths...

1773
02:00:56,331 --> 02:00:59,604
right through school,
college, or wherever!

1774
02:01:00,132 --> 02:01:04,516
When someone asks for my name and when
I say that my name is Rajinikanth...

1775
02:01:04,872 --> 02:01:07,475
...they at least stares an
extra three seconds at me.

1776
02:01:07,663 --> 02:01:09,719
So I don't say it most of the time.

1777
02:01:09,807 --> 02:01:11,336
Few people don't even believe me.

1778
02:01:12,287 --> 02:01:15,261
A lot of people react the
same way as Kamath did.

1779
02:01:15,461 --> 02:01:21,431
[music]

1780
02:01:47,965 --> 02:01:53,470
So this is the first episode of
my life as a police officer.

1781
02:02:00,985 --> 02:02:01,687
Kamath!

1782
02:02:17,584 --> 02:02:19,098
Since we met last.

1783
02:02:20,154 --> 02:02:22,585
Since then...
I have learnt a little bit of Hindi.

1784
02:02:22,754 --> 02:02:26,154
Actually, a lot has happened
since we last met.

1785
02:02:26,358 --> 02:02:30,906
After you came home...
I came here ten days later.

1786
02:02:31,129 --> 02:02:32,251
I have come here
many times since.

1787
02:02:32,407 --> 02:02:35,351
I used to stare at you
whether you're there are not.

1788
02:02:35,507 --> 02:02:38,479
Just to kill you!
Nothing else.

1789
02:02:38,854 --> 02:02:41,792
I couldn't bear to see you
throw your weight around.

1790
02:02:41,932 --> 02:02:45,704
I couldn't handle it.
I felt envious.

1791
02:02:46,253 --> 02:02:49,225
And then I thought,
I should be in your place.

1792
02:02:49,512 --> 02:02:50,704
But with one difference...

1793
02:02:50,944 --> 02:02:52,865
I wanted to be
a good policeman.

1794
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:57,520
So, I wrote the Union Public
Service Commission exams and passed.

1795
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:59,328
Turned down the Indian
Administrative Services,

1796
02:02:59,368 --> 02:03:00,517
And chose the Indian Police Service.

1797
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:03,154
After the official Police Verification
at my residence...

1798
02:03:03,393 --> 02:03:04,771
We are here for the
police verification...

1799
02:03:04,879 --> 02:03:06,151
I spent one and a half years
in police training at Hyderabad.

1800
02:03:06,567 --> 02:03:08,695
Then I got my first posting at Pune.

1801
02:03:08,831 --> 02:03:09,546
As an undercover cop.

1802
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:14,408
Then I insisted my posting here...

1803
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:18,855
I was aimless in life...

1804
02:03:19,407 --> 02:03:24,659
You're the one Who turned me
into a policeman. Thank you.

1805
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:28,641
Do you want to know
how this started?

1806
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:32,899
Every time I saw you,

1807
02:03:34,075 --> 02:03:36,739
I wondered why you destroyed that family.

1808
02:03:37,255 --> 02:03:38,777
Dr. Yashwanth helped me a lot.

1809
02:03:39,097 --> 02:03:42,090
First I tried to find out how his son,
Atul was involved in this.

1810
02:03:42,378 --> 02:03:45,162
Atul was dead,
but the doctor had his phone.

1811
02:03:45,450 --> 02:03:47,653
We found many pictures
in the deleted folder.

1812
02:03:48,109 --> 02:03:52,042
We searched Leela's house.
We found the same pictures in an album.

1813
02:03:52,415 --> 02:03:54,115
I knew there was a connection.

1814
02:03:54,714 --> 02:03:58,224
It took me one year to find her.

1815
02:03:58,852 --> 02:03:59,746
Just last week...

1816
02:04:00,225 --> 02:04:00,986
Anamika.

1817
02:04:01,582 --> 02:04:03,612
I got to know all this from Anamika.

1818
02:04:03,922 --> 02:04:06,286
She told me the story that took place
twenty-four years ago.

1819
02:04:06,558 --> 02:04:09,182
This love story has started
in the party office...

1820
02:04:09,438 --> 02:04:11,692
Nathuram Dubey,
a gangster.

1821
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:13,532
An RLS party worker too...

1822
02:04:13,781 --> 02:04:16,061
Anamika was a member
of the same party

1823
02:04:16,401 --> 02:04:19,421
He wooed her with talk of his ideology.

1824
02:04:19,593 --> 02:04:22,109
No one there knew that
he was already married!

1825
02:04:22,618 --> 02:04:24,621
Even that girl came to
know about it later!

1826
02:04:24,973 --> 02:04:27,180
They were together
for exactly a year.

1827
02:04:27,690 --> 02:04:32,838
Then one day, Anamika told him that
she's pregnant with his child.

1828
02:04:33,424 --> 02:04:35,130
Nathuram doesn't want
the baby or the mother.

1829
02:04:35,758 --> 02:04:39,114
Nathuram threatened
her to abort the child.

1830
02:04:39,893 --> 02:04:45,169
she gives birth to a child and
gives the baby up to her sister.

1831
02:04:45,816 --> 02:04:48,944
Only those two knew of about this.
Even Nathuram didn't know.

1832
02:04:49,998 --> 02:04:54,252
That child is Leela Nathuram.

1833
02:04:54,452 --> 02:04:57,642
Nathuram... Now politician, leader,
Party second in command.

1834
02:04:57,762 --> 02:05:01,092
If they win this election,
he may be the next chief minister.

1835
02:05:01,348 --> 02:05:02,366
When she got to know this,

1836
02:05:02,654 --> 02:05:06,254
Anamika turned up out of the blue
at the party office...

1837
02:05:06,496 --> 02:05:09,411
and tells him he has a daughter.

1838
02:05:09,699 --> 02:05:13,611
"You betrayed me!
You tried to kill our child."

1839
02:05:13,883 --> 02:05:16,221
"You're a horrible man.
You're unfit to be a Chief Minister."

1840
02:05:16,525 --> 02:05:21,502
"She's your child. She's our child.
Admit it to everyone", she begged him.

1841
02:05:21,758 --> 02:05:23,246
Then she threatened him.

1842
02:05:23,434 --> 02:05:27,702
Anamika's only fault,
was threatening him.

1843
02:05:27,742 --> 02:05:30,708
She forgot that Nathuram
was still the same old Nathuram.

1844
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:33,662
After twenty days...
he found out that Leela is his daughter.

1845
02:05:34,426 --> 02:05:37,327
He tried to kill her in
a setup road accident.

1846
02:05:37,383 --> 02:05:40,830
Then, he tries to kill Anamika.

1847
02:05:41,038 --> 02:05:44,850
But fearing the
repercussions of murdering her...

1848
02:05:45,106 --> 02:05:45,881
Until last week.

1849
02:05:45,905 --> 02:05:50,281
When Anamika called Satyamurthy, he got
to know that Leela's life is in danger.

1850
02:05:50,728 --> 02:05:55,085
But he never knew that his own life
was in danger at that very minute...

1851
02:05:57,727 --> 02:05:58,852
Next, in the hospital...

1852
02:05:59,072 --> 02:06:00,465
Sir your entry...

1853
02:06:00,969 --> 02:06:04,418
Not knowing any of this, according
to Naturam's instruction's

1854
02:06:04,962 --> 02:06:08,949
Were executed by Nathuram's
right hand Atul! Doctor's son.

1855
02:06:09,389 --> 02:06:13,406
He also used you Kamat
and gangster Hiren.

1856
02:06:13,894 --> 02:06:15,888
Later you became the main villain.

1857
02:06:16,175 --> 02:06:17,519
All of them are dead now.

1858
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:26,144
[phone ringing]

1859
02:06:26,653 --> 02:06:30,032
What you did at the hospital...
and at the doctor's house...

1860
02:06:30,645 --> 02:06:33,968
What happened to us next...
is all written in my statement.

1861
02:06:35,449 --> 02:06:37,091
I deposed to the commissioner.

1862
02:06:37,839 --> 02:06:39,560
It took me all this time to say it.

1863
02:06:39,612 --> 02:06:41,704
I needed this uniform.
[phone ringing]

1864
02:06:41,904 --> 02:06:43,468
Your phone will keep ringing...

1865
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:45,081
You know why?

1866
02:06:45,648 --> 02:06:47,339
Nathuram Dubey is arrested.

1867
02:06:48,088 --> 02:06:50,672
We used his leader
to get him.

1868
02:06:51,088 --> 02:06:54,256
When we said we're going to get him,
everyone co-operated.

1869
02:06:55,152 --> 02:06:58,283
He's being brought down here
with that, your story ends here.

1870
02:06:59,652 --> 02:07:01,564
Two of your colleagues will
be charge sheeted today...

1871
02:07:01,764 --> 02:07:02,816
...for conspiring with you.

1872
02:07:03,223 --> 02:07:04,974
One of their statements
is included in this.

1873
02:07:05,237 --> 02:07:07,202
He turned approver yesterday.

1874
02:07:07,732 --> 02:07:09,812
He told your name several times.

1875
02:07:11,356 --> 02:07:12,830
You are not a smart police officer.

1876
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:15,963
I knew you don't know who I was.

1877
02:07:16,817 --> 02:07:18,766
I took a leap and worked
towards this with that courage.

1878
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:21,750
All of us planned this together...

1879
02:07:22,622 --> 02:07:26,793
I've been waiting to take revenge
on you for two and a half years now.

1880
02:07:26,829 --> 02:07:28,880
I played the patience game.
I waited.

1881
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:30,552
I risked it.

1882
02:07:31,848 --> 02:07:33,627
I feared nothing.

1883
02:07:35,851 --> 02:07:37,739
Today I am DCP Rajanikanth.

1884
02:07:44,844 --> 02:07:45,605
Hey...!

1885
02:07:47,046 --> 02:07:48,478
What do you think of yourselves?

1886
02:07:48,485 --> 02:07:50,973
Why have you brought me in?
Who is this Anamika?

1887
02:07:51,445 --> 02:07:54,126
If this could happen to me, think
what could happen to the common man!

1888
02:07:54,297 --> 02:07:56,506
-Hey! Damn it! Give me the phone!
-Shut up sir!

1889
02:07:57,042 --> 02:07:59,472
This is a police station
and this is my station.

1890
02:08:00,624 --> 02:08:03,809
This is not your MLA hostel
nor is it your house.

1891
02:08:04,003 --> 02:08:06,547
There are proof and evidence that you
were been involved in these murders.

1892
02:08:06,835 --> 02:08:08,660
You attempted to murder
your own daughter!

1893
02:08:09,058 --> 02:08:10,276
Your lawyer is on his way...

1894
02:08:10,695 --> 02:08:12,509
Until then please be
seated in that room sir!

1895
02:08:12,909 --> 02:08:13,699
And that's an order!

1896
02:08:13,771 --> 02:08:16,246
Hey! Which statement is
it and which videotape?

1897
02:09:03,604 --> 02:09:05,890
If you want to escape from here,
you will be killed.

1898
02:09:12,488 --> 02:09:16,817
I will take ten policemen down with me!

1899
02:09:18,406 --> 02:09:20,294
Come at me, Hero!

1900
02:09:44,326 --> 02:09:47,878
You little punk! Trying
to mess with me?

1901
02:09:50,033 --> 02:09:52,675
I will walk into your house
and take your mother.

1902
02:09:56,879 --> 02:09:59,552
Mahesh is dead...
Forgive me uncle...

1903
02:10:00,341 --> 02:10:02,133
Uncle I will not leave them.

1904
02:10:38,509 --> 02:10:42,658
I won, I took revenge
and everything is over.

1905
02:10:52,785 --> 02:10:55,919
You're okay now.
We are okay now.

1906
02:10:56,623 --> 02:10:58,337
You don't have to be there anymore.

1907
02:10:58,689 --> 02:11:03,041
Go home... I'll ask dad to pick you up.

1908
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:04,498
I love you.

1909
02:11:04,698 --> 02:11:10,647
[music]

1910
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:22,780
[vehicle arriving]

1911
02:12:06,754 --> 02:12:07,895
What happened? Why did you stop?

1912
02:12:09,655 --> 02:12:12,529
This is the place you
first got on my bike.

1913
02:12:13,365 --> 02:12:13,972
I know.

1914
02:12:16,624 --> 02:12:17,678
It's getting dark.

1915
02:12:18,357 --> 02:12:19,470
Shall we stay somewhere for the night?

1916
02:12:19,728 --> 02:12:21,297
Yeah,
one room or two rooms?

1917
02:12:23,321 --> 02:12:24,841
Wait!
I got to tell you something!

1918
02:12:27,608 --> 02:12:28,306
Thank you!

1919
02:12:31,178 --> 02:12:32,512
For saving my life!

1920
02:12:33,499 --> 02:12:34,655
For giving me life!

1921
02:12:35,777 --> 02:12:37,907
Risking your own life
without a second thought.

1922
02:12:39,131 --> 02:12:41,257
I am not sure if I thanked you.
That's why.

1923
02:12:52,588 --> 02:12:53,639
You're my hero too...

1924
02:12:55,919 --> 02:12:57,291
Your name is so right.

1925
02:12:58,635 --> 02:12:59,303
Stay with me.

1926
02:13:04,782 --> 02:13:06,186
Till my last breath.

1927
02:13:06,909 --> 02:13:09,194
-Marry me.
-Yes. Of course.

1928
02:13:09,546 --> 02:13:11,743
I was about to ask you this
in a heartbeat time.

1929
02:13:13,019 --> 02:13:14,837
I have no one but you!

1930
02:13:15,348 --> 02:13:16,833
I don't need to ask anyone about this.

1931
02:13:26,136 --> 02:13:29,252
"A friendship that soothes
the heart is a boon,"

1932
02:13:29,652 --> 02:13:32,620
"When your lips part in a
smile there is a melody,"

1933
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:36,694
"The ray of love is a dawn in my heart,"

1934
02:13:36,994 --> 02:13:40,261
"The moment when our eyes
met was glorious."

1935
02:13:40,595 --> 02:13:43,337
"The ray of love is a dawn in my heart,"

1936
02:13:44,333 --> 02:13:47,113
"on me, without my consent it rains..."

1937
02:13:47,983 --> 02:13:52,126
"Our hearts sing a melody in unison"

1938
02:14:03,415 --> 02:14:08,127
"Let's stretch our wings and fly."

1939
02:14:08,283 --> 02:14:11,991
"Leaving behind all
the bounds and stars,"

1940
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:17,791
"Our youth made this freeway the sky,"

1941
02:14:18,356 --> 02:14:22,768
"Soar high into the sky, says my girl."

1942
02:14:22,792 --> 02:14:24,407
"Oh! Dear"

1943
02:14:25,037 --> 02:14:28,908
"Let's go,
would I question the direction?"

1944
02:14:29,548 --> 02:14:33,579
"Don't I follow wherever you go"

1945
02:14:34,757 --> 02:14:38,884
"Oh! Dear"

1946
02:14:39,532 --> 02:14:45,505
"In this competition..."

1947
02:14:46,843 --> 02:14:50,924
"...lets see who is ahead."

1948
02:14:51,624 --> 02:14:53,724
"Let's see..."

1949
02:14:53,824 --> 02:14:57,746
"Who will lead, who would speak first"

1950
02:14:58,526 --> 02:15:02,298
"When will express their love first?"

1951
02:15:03,301 --> 02:15:08,581
"Who will break the silence first?"

1952
02:15:08,665 --> 02:15:12,956
"Who will lead, who would speak first"

1953
02:15:13,452 --> 02:15:17,486
"And when will the moment of our meet
up and opening up of heart arrive..."

1954
02:15:18,030 --> 02:15:19,935
"When will that moment be?"
