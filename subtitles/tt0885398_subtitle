2
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:03,472
Hi, I am calling on behalf of Legacy
chain of international hotels.

3
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:04,735
Yes, ma'am!

4
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:08,474
We need an agency that
provides for escorts.

5
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:12,410
We have escorts listed. Give
me your requirements.

6
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,221
Tomorrow for a conference
in Mumbai...

7
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:17,620
...our delegate is coming
from Rajasthan.

8
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,283
We need escorts for him.

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,557
You know, like a personal secretary.

10
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,224
I will forward you the number
of our agency's escorts.

11
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:26,691
Her name is Jia Rao.

12
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,296
You can give her the details
of your guest.

13
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:55,652
Hello!
- Is this Jia Rao?

14
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,321
We got your number from Alfa agency.

15
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:58,659
Yes, Jia Rao speaking.

16
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:01,661
Look, I am calling from Legacy
chain of international hotels.

17
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,665
We need an escort for our guest...

18
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:04,999
...who is coming from
Rajasthan tomorrow.

19
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:09,005
Sure, but there is a problem.
I don't know Rajasthani.

20
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:10,334
That should be okay.

21
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,477
Okay. You message me the name of
the guest and the flight details.

22
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:15,679
I will reach the airport
to receive him.

23
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:24,419
Can't you sleep?

24
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,628
I can't sleep on the floor.

25
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,289
And if I see somebody
walking over me...

26
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:33,957
...then how will I feel?

27
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:43,435
What's the matter?

28
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,369
Your boyfriend's message,
so late in the night?

29
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,711
Read this! Boyfriend's message!

30
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:52,845
Mr. Vikram Aditya Singh Shishodiya!

31
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,977
How many men are they?

32
00:02:54,654 --> 00:03:00,388
Flight KF 903 from
Jaipur at 8:45 am.

33
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:03,387
Are you going as an escort?
- Yes!

34
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:04,521
And we are going for dinner
tomorrow night.

35
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:05,724
What about that?

36
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:08,859
Shall we go after 2 days?

37
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,065
This guest will return to
Rajasthan by then! Okay!

38
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,534
Thanks! Do me a favour! Please!

39
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:17,406
Give this chart book
and papers to Kanchi!

40
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:19,542
And tell her that I will come
for tuitions 2 days later!

41
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,340
Okay, my multi-tasking friend!

42
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:22,472
Thanks!

43
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:24,343
Oh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Come on!

44
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:33,425
Mr. Vikram Singh! Welcome to Mumbai!

45
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,425
Looking for me?

46
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:48,432
Were you expecting someone else?

47
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:54,042
No, I... actually I was told that
the guest is from Rajasthan.

48
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:57,106
Right. I am from Rajasthan.
Born and brought up there.

49
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:01,445
It means... I don't know Rajasthan.
- No.

50
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,781
Like I don't know those who
walk with an empty trolley.

51
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,453
Oh! O my God! How silly of me!

52
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:08,585
I mean...

53
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,788
Hey! What's wrong with you?
- Sorry!

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,792
May I take your bag, sir?
- It's okay. I will take care of it.

55
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,604
Today's schedule. Breakfast
after checking in.

56
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,468
Conference at 11!
Nariman Point at 4!

57
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:25,602
Got that?
- Yes!

58
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:30,476
By the way this trend of
escort is quite new here.

59
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,608
Yes.

60
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,615
You people don't face
any security problems?

61
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,486
At times you meet difficult people.

62
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:40,019
I go out all prepared.

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,958
For instance... if somebody
misbehaved then this pepper spray.

64
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,490
Straight in their eyes.

65
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,495
If this didn't work,
then I have a backup.

66
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:51,495
Chilli powder!

67
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:56,502
If I still face any danger, then
this knife. - Are you serious?

68
00:04:56,576 --> 00:05:02,173
And then... my revolver.
- Is that loaded?

69
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,510
Dummy!
- I am impressed!

70
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:07,844
Thank you!

71
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:09,850
By the way you made a mistake...

72
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:10,981
...by telling me all this.

73
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,982
Now I know everything.

74
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:19,990
I know you are not like
that. Want to bet?

75
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,528
I lost.

76
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,998
Thank you!

77
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:31,935
Hello!
- Hello!

78
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,480
Mr. Vikram Singh Shishodiya!
We have a booking!

79
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:35,605
Sure!

80
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,883
Yes, Malini. I had called.
Some urgent work.

81
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:52,489
My folder... on my computer... all
the photographs in the folder...

82
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:53,896
...mail me all of that.

83
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:55,894
Yes, I will need it
for the presentation.

84
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:57,629
You know which folder
I am talking about.

85
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:01,562
Yes, all the jpeg, mail
me all of that.

86
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:03,900
Go to folder A.

87
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:05,569
Yes, that's the one.

88
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,579
Yes?
- What are you doing here?

89
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:10,912
I am taking a bath. - Yes, but
why are you taking a bath here?

90
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,042
So where else shall I take a bath?

91
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:15,519
Go and take a bath in your room.
- This is my room!

92
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,523
Look, this is our room! As
you can see... - Excuse me!

93
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,258
Can I see that please?
- Yeah!

94
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:23,787
Sorry.

95
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,731
Sorry, you can take a bath.

96
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:34,267
This is just the serial number.

97
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,133
The room number is written
here. Princess suite.

98
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,737
Let's go.

99
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,077
Yes, I will talk. Just tell Mahajan
to be in touch with me.

100
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,210
Just one minute.

101
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,549
Can you get me a meal
of white omelette...

102
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,612
...some bacon, sausages,
some orange juice...

103
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,214
...and cheese. Don't
forget the cheese.

104
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:55,087
Yeah, Malini. I will call
you as soon as it's over.

105
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:56,887
Okay.

106
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,090
Will you get it?

107
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,297
Yes, I will get it. But what, sir?

108
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:05,962
Breakfast!

109
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,100
Oh! I am sorry, sir. I thought
you were talking on the phone.

110
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:22,646
Enjoy your breakfast.

111
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:35,192
I am sorry, sir!

112
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,604
I think those who trained
you to be an escort...

113
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:41,663
...they have taught you
only to say sorry.

114
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,803
Because you don't
know anything else.

115
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,138
You don't know how to
find the hotel room.

116
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:48,680
And you don't know how
to serve breakfast.

117
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,612
And you don't remember
that you have to...

118
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,618
...remind me about the
11 O'clock conference.

119
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,683
I am so sorry, sir!

120
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,684
Home away from home.

121
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,153
Legacy chain of international
hotels.

122
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:04,162
Shallu!
- Yes, Jia darling. Tell me.

123
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,030
You were talking about dinner
today. Let's go. We will go.

124
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:09,693
Will you be able to come?

125
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,168
I think I will reach home
within half an hour.

126
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,698
240 properties which Mr. Makhija...

127
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:15,832
I have lost my job.

128
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:16,967
What are you saying, Jia?

129
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,703
I will come home and tell you. Okay.

130
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,710
You decide where you
want to go. Okay.

131
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,713
Okay! Okay, fine. Bye.

132
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:29,980
Thank you.

133
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:36,186
I didn't want to tell
you downstairs...

134
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:37,320
...in front of everybody.

135
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:38,659
But I know. You are intelligent.

136
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,925
You know what I want to tell you.

137
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,660
I know. I have lost my job.

138
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,663
I hope you don't mind
my saying this...

139
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:48,673
...but being an escort
is not your cup of tea.

140
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,671
It's a different kind of confidence.

141
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,205
I am not saying that you
are not confident.

142
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,273
Its just that... they are
different kind of girls.

143
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:00,744
You know what I mean.

144
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,145
You are right.

145
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:10,754
It's not my cup of tea. These
7 star hotels. Formal suit.

146
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,825
High heels. I don't wear
all these things.

147
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,901
But I have to wear it. Because
this was the only secured job.

148
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:26,438
But you are right. I made
a mistake. No excuses.

149
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,777
Why don't you pursue your studies?

150
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,781
Tell your parents to support you.

151
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,784
They would have supported
me completely.

152
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,792
They would have sent any
amount of money I wanted.

153
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,789
But there is a small problem.

154
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:46,792
Their currency doesn't work here.

155
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,396
Why? Where do they live?

156
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,799
In heaven.
- I am sorry.

157
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,266
I give tuitions.

158
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,333
So there is no problem that
if I lost my job then...

159
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:03,274
But thanks for the advice. Goodbye.

160
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:12,347
Excuse me. I have not
asked you to leave.

161
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,820
Oh! But obviously sir,
I don't know my work.

162
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:18,822
So why will you stop me?

163
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,828
To give you a few tips
on your secured job.

164
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:24,768
So that next time when
you are an escort...

165
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,498
...you don't lose your job.

166
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:32,773
I will be your escort for
a day. And you be my guest.

167
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,779
After a day's training,
I am sure that...

168
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:38,373
...your job will become
permanently secured.

169
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,045
Shall we begin?

170
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,316
Well ma'am, what's your
schedule for today?

171
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,854
You have to reach Nariman
Point at 4 o'clock.

172
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:57,201
Not me... you have to
reach at 4 o'clock.

173
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,204
And it's late. So shall we go?

174
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,199
How about some chocolates
on the way?

175
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:05,335
Sure!

176
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:06,469
Let's go.
- Thank you.

177
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,007
Come on. After you.

178
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:14,876
You are giving me
too much attention.

179
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,147
Then I am doing fine.

180
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,815
The guest should always feel that...

181
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,223
...the escort is giving
him full attention.

182
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,223
Please, now stop it!

183
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:28,967
When guest says that then the
escort should double his efforts.

184
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:30,894
Here we are!

185
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,241
Sir, flowers!
- Yes.

186
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,316
Take this. Keep it.
- Thanks.

187
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,442
Thank you.

188
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:49,913
Here. For you. Shall I put it?

189
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:52,856
No, I will wear it later.
- Oh! Okay!

190
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,918
If I asked you something,
you won't mind?

191
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:58,924
The guest can ask the
escort anything.

192
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:00,390
He won't mind.

193
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,931
Are you flirting with me?

194
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:23,279
Are you still upset with me?

195
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,286
I met Anamika for the
first time here.

196
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:33,959
Anamika?
- My wife!

197
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,302
Oh! You are a married man.

198
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:41,965
I was. She died.

199
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,299
6 months ago she was involved in a...

200
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,435
I am so sorry.

201
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,981
So... how was I as an escort?

202
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:01,985
A big failure.

203
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:03,520
What?

204
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:05,996
It's true! Neither can
you accompany me!

205
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,123
Nor can I accompany you!

206
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,595
So tomorrow... what about tomorrow?

207
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,129
What do you mean?

208
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,465
I mean... will we meet or not?

209
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,004
There should be a reason to meet.

210
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,013
If there is no reason then find
an excuse. - Like what?

211
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:29,617
Think at night and tell me. Okay.

212
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,020
So... did you think of something?

213
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,024
No. I went to sleep.

214
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,100
I bet you didn't sleep at all.
Not at all. Am I right?

215
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,378
You don't want to answer me.

216
00:13:55,515 --> 00:14:00,976
Fine. Now I want to answer
those questions...

217
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:06,719
...which you want to ask...
but... you can't ask.

218
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:12,724
Did you sleep at night?
- No, Jia. I couldn't sleep.

219
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,525
Why?

220
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:18,061
Well, obviously, I was thinking
about you the whole night.

221
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,198
Oh, really. What were
you thinking about me?

222
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:25,205
Well, I thought of the
excuse for meeting.

223
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,075
Oh! Seriously?
- What's the excuse?

224
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:34,677
Will you marry me?

225
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,088
Are you ready to get married?

226
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,257
Beloved! Darling!

227
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:22,464
I search for you everywhere.

228
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:25,798
My blossoming heart.

229
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,274
My blossoming heart.

230
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,134
My blossoming heart.

231
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:39,214
To endure the pain of separation.

232
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:42,482
It's difficult to stay away.

233
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:47,692
Come and meet me.

234
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,293
My blossoming heart.

235
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,099
My blossoming heart.

236
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,628
My blossoming heart.

237
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,330
In the craving of fervour.

238
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:29,192
You dwell in my feelings.

239
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:33,198
My heart is immersed
in your thoughts.

240
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:36,673
You have made me crazy.

241
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:43,343
I thought of you. I loved you.

242
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:47,210
I asked for you. I got you.

243
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:52,223
I have won you.

244
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,752
My blossoming heart.

245
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,757
My blossoming heart.

246
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,229
My blossoming heart.

247
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,702
Beloved! Darling!

248
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:15,705
I search for you everywhere.

249
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:17,774
My blossoming heart.

250
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,778
My blossoming heart.

251
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,717
My blossoming heart.

252
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,384
My blossoming heart.

253
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,458
My blossoming heart.

254
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,267
In two days nobody asks for a kiss.

255
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,398
And he directly proposed
you for marriage.

256
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:45,469
Jia, I think something is fishy.

257
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:47,611
Maybe you don't understand...

258
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,272
That's not so! I...

259
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:53,210
Ask her! She has experience! It
has happened twice with her!

260
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,610
These people only talk of marriage.

261
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,747
Then they sleep with you
and walk away. Right?

262
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,616
Come on, let's take his interview.

263
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:05,357
No. No. I will do whatever
is to be done.

264
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:11,363
What is to do? Go and tell
him, sorry. Refuse him.

265
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:12,695
What will you say?

266
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,804
So Jia... welcome to my city!

267
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:57,740
Have you ever come here before?

268
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,886
I had thought someday I will
surely visit Rajasthan.

269
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:06,487
But I will come here this way...
I had never imagined that.

270
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:08,684
I am happy.

271
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,494
Sir!

272
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,038
Let it be! He is mad!

273
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:44,453
This road goes straight. But
there is another route.

274
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:46,857
I have never taken it before.

275
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:51,527
But today I want to take it
with you for the first time.

276
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:53,729
Here it is.

277
00:19:54,607 --> 00:20:02,946
My beloved.

278
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:14,556
My beloved.

279
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:28,765
My beloved.

280
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:40,776
Welcome to my city.

281
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:51,389
Welcome to my city.

282
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:53,795
Gajner. Our home.

283
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:55,458
Oh my...

284
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,463
So huge!

285
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:05,810
...beloved.

286
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:08,005
So make a small home here.

287
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:14,819
Welcome to my city.

288
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,491
Come. Carefully.

289
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,495
Good evening, sir. Good
evening, ma'am.

290
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:31,627
Good evening, Mahajan.

291
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:34,431
Sir... today you came
by the lake route?

292
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,501
Nothing. Wanted to try it once.
- Okay.

293
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:39,510
Jia, Mr. Mahajan! Gajner's
old manager.

294
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:40,636
This is Jia.
- Hello!

295
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:41,771
Hello!
- How do you do?

296
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:42,905
Come, Jia.

297
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:46,577
Sir! Ma'am is an official
guest or personal?

298
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:48,911
Very personal.

299
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:53,456
Well, Jia! The resort which
I was talking about...

300
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,085
...it will be built here.

301
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,822
What do you think?
- Good evening, Mr. Vikram.

302
00:21:58,464 --> 00:21:59,556
Malini!

303
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:00,690
Welcome back!

304
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,195
Thank you, Malini. Jia,
she is Malini.

305
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,867
She is everything to Gajner.

306
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:09,597
She is responsible for making this
place an international resort.

307
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:12,467
You have returned with such
a guest whom you can't tell...

308
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:15,138
...that we have been friends
for the past 25 years.

309
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:17,580
Of course! I grew
up in front of her!

310
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,884
Just kidding! Actually Jia, we
grew up together in Gajner.

311
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:24,914
Jia?

312
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,556
Well, I am really bad
with introductions.

313
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:28,718
Why don't you guess?

314
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,556
Alright! Let me guess!

315
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,760
A new interior designer for Gajner?

316
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,900
Fantastic! How did you guess?

317
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,569
Please meet my wife Jia.

318
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:39,695
What?

319
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,600
How can you do that?

320
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:43,566
Why?

321
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:45,872
I mean is this the
way to get married?

322
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:48,639
No joy and no celebration in Gajner!

323
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:52,008
I have got married once
that way too, Malini.

324
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,986
Welcome back, sir. Good
evening, ma'am!

325
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:57,147
How are you, Narayan?
- Fine, sir. It's your grace!

326
00:22:57,523 --> 00:23:00,185
Thank you! Here!
- Thank you!

327
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:03,594
Cheers to my wife!

328
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,861
Oh!
- Sorry!

329
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:09,700
Never mind! It's okay!
- But I do!

330
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,603
You did what you had to
do. It's my turn now.

331
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:16,741
Mahajan!
- Yes! - Its time to celebrate!

332
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:27,783
Welcome to my city.

333
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,146
Dance! Dance! Dance!

334
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:32,213
Come! Come!

335
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,952
Dance! Dance! Dance!

336
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,059
Come! Come!

337
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:37,652
Dance! Dance! Dance!

338
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:40,225
Come! Come!

339
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,702
He has come! He has come!
He has come!

340
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:55,235
He has come! He has come!
He has come!

341
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:59,114
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

342
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:01,243
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

343
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,288
So what do you think of Gajner?

344
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,989
My entire hostel can fit here.
- Hostel?

345
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:10,586
YWCA! In Mumbai, I lived in YWCA!
5 girls in one room.

346
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:14,598
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

347
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:18,659
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

348
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:22,605
My bangles felt coy.
My bracelet felt nervous.

349
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:24,608
My bangles felt coy...
- This is your first marriage, right?

350
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,268
...My bracelet felt nervous.
- Yes.

351
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,711
It's Vikram sir's second marriage.
- I know.

352
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,610
Maybe you don't know that there is...

353
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:32,775
...so much difference between
his first and second one.

354
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:37,613
My heart is beating fast.

355
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:41,284
My heart! My heart! My heart!

356
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,797
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

357
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,760
Come! Come!

358
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,270
Come! Come!

359
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:04,713
My veil is covered with stars.

360
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:08,742
My skirt is embellished with gems.

361
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:15,886
Kohl adorns my eyes.

362
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:20,028
My friends have dressed me up!

363
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:23,659
My friends have dressed me up!

364
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:27,330
They did it! They did
it! They did it!

365
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:31,740
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

366
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:36,205
That's the west wing.

367
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:38,682
There Mr. Vikram Aditya Singh...

368
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,809
...and his wife Mrs. Shishodiya
used to live.

369
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:43,846
Nobody lives there after her death.

370
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,747
And now nobody is permitted
to go there.

371
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:55,963
Dance! Dance! Dance!

372
00:25:56,802 --> 00:26:02,763
You can surely love him a bit
less... but be more loyal to him.

373
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:13,974
Today is the day of union.

374
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:17,715
I am craving.

375
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:21,725
My trembling body is fragrant.

376
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:25,058
Youth is young.

377
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:29,231
Lovingly in his arms, beloved...

378
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:32,737
Lovingly in his arms, beloved...

379
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:36,399
Took me! Took me! Took me!

380
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:40,741
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

381
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:44,805
He has come! He has come!
He has come!

382
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:48,080
He has come! He has come!
He has come!

383
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:51,884
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

384
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,756
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

385
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:59,763
Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!

386
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:01,355
Dance! Dance! Dance!

387
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,434
Come! Come!

388
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,164
Are you happy?
- No.

389
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:09,131
Why?

390
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,945
Everything feels like a dream.

391
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:19,908
So will you love me in your dream?

392
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:27,892
No. I will love you less...

393
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:30,919
...and I will be loyal more.

394
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:47,168
'I will love you less and
I will be loyal more.'

395
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,480
I don't know what happened
to him. He left suddenly.

396
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,914
Where is the way to exit?

397
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:28,384
You go to your room.

398
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,448
But Vikram...
- He won't come tonight.

399
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:35,017
But what did I do? I want
to talk to him that...

400
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:39,928
When he leaves in anger then nobody
is permitted to go to him.

401
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,555
I am not nobody.

402
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:43,960
Even Mrs. Shishodiya
was not allowed.

403
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:47,537
Your room is there.

404
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,411
Good night!

405
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:40,482
Good morning, Jia.

406
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,432
Vikram!
- I am really angry with my staff.

407
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:55,032
Nobody told my Jia that in Gajner
people sleep on the bed.

408
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,431
And not on the chair.

409
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,036
Even in the hostel I would
sleep on the bed.

410
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:04,473
And not on the chair.

411
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:07,075
But I don't know why last night...

412
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:08,949
...you got angry with
me and you left.

413
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,112
And I...

414
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:17,223
I am sorry. I am really
sorry about last night.

415
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:20,155
Let it be.

416
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:28,638
Are you angry with me?

417
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,038
Anyway!

418
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:40,710
I have an important business
meeting to attend.

419
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,580
You have your breakfast
and start your day.

420
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:45,115
And in the evening Vishaka Devi...

421
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,248
...and her husband are
coming to meet you.

422
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:51,326
Oh! How funny is that?

423
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,992
After marriage I am
telling you that...

424
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:55,362
...the only other person in my life
is my elder sister Vishaka.

425
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,332
And her husband Shekhar Rajput.

426
00:30:58,003 --> 00:30:59,402
Shekhar is the police chief.

427
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:04,074
He is not as capable as he thinks.

428
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:07,271
They will have dinner here.

429
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:10,072
So will you take care of it please?

430
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,013
And now that we have got married...

431
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,142
...consider this house as your own.

432
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:18,280
Love you!

433
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,199
Excuse me, ma'am!

434
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:38,634
What are you doing?
- I...

435
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,768
Narayan!

436
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:43,511
You please sit there. No, please
keep this plate here.

437
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,549
You sit there. Come.

438
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:51,113
Sit.

439
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:01,365
Excuse me! Narayan!

440
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:10,798
Narayan! Ma'am was serving
her own breakfast!

441
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,507
Had Malini found out, she
would have fired us.

442
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:15,637
Ma'am!
- Yes!

443
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:18,182
Narayan! He will serve you
breakfast every morning!

444
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,409
Okay. - Ma'am, what would you
like to have for breakfast?

445
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:22,452
Sausages, bacon with
white butter toast.

446
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:24,181
Fish with honey and olive.

447
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:26,090
Ma'am, if you want to
begin with salad...

448
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:28,091
...then we have Italian salad
and Russian salad...

449
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,217
...with all kind of toppings.

450
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:31,091
If you would like to begin
with Indian breakfast...

451
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:33,153
...then we have three kinds
of idlis and porridges.

452
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,425
We have 5 varieties of eggs.

453
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,090
Scrambled, milk omelette,
tomato omelette...

454
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,225
...half fried and boiled.

455
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,099
And in drinks, ma'am, soup,
juice, milkshakes...

456
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,195
...coffee, piping hot tea.
- And of course desserts.

457
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,369
What would you like to have
for breakfast, ma'am?

458
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:49,308
Toast and coffee... please.

459
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,211
I think the order is clear,
Narayan. Serve her.

460
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:07,391
There you are, ma'am!

461
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:12,461
This is today's newspaper.
- Thank you.

462
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:16,332
Did you enjoy the breakfast?
- Yes, it was very nice.

463
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:18,470
If there was any dearth,
then let me know.

464
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,236
As such a large spread is available
in the marriage party.

465
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:25,208
All thanks to Mrs. Shishodiya.

466
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:29,345
Here there was always an ambience
of party. - Is that so?

467
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:33,148
In India maybe you are the only
person who doesn't know...

468
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:34,282
...about these parties.

469
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,226
Twice a year.

470
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,157
For such parties even page 3 was...

471
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:41,289
...not enough to print the
snaps of this party.

472
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,663
Come. Let me show you.

473
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:50,638
The party was held here.

474
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,178
Celebrities from all over
the world who were...

475
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:57,612
...Mrs. Shishodiya's personal
guests used to be here.

476
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,346
All the guests would be in mask.

477
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:04,517
So that we couldn't know who
had come and with whom.

478
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,386
So that there is no controversy.

479
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:12,595
Singing, dancing, commotion.
Drinks, eateries.

480
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:14,890
For many nights.

481
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:20,328
Gajner used to feel alive when
Mrs. Shishodiya was there.

482
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,603
Would you like to sit
in the hall or library?

483
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:26,735
Anywhere.

484
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,206
After her breakfast
Mrs. Shishodiya...

485
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,339
...used to begin her
day with the library.

486
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,213
Giving instructions to staff,
all the social phone calls...

487
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,581
...appointments...

488
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:35,710
Where is the library?

489
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,325
Hello!
- Mrs. Shishodiya!

490
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:23,799
I am sorry. Mrs. Shishodiya
is no more.

491
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:33,735
Ma'am!

492
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,609
It was the chef's call
from the kitchen!

493
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:41,775
Oh! - He wanted to ask about
this evening's dinner menu.

494
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:46,582
I am sure you know that some guests
are coming in the evening.

495
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:50,386
You tell me. I will inform
in the kitchen.

496
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:53,924
Whatever is normally
cooked for dinners.

497
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:55,957
The same menu.

498
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,366
Mrs. Shishodiya was very particular.

499
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,305
Which guest likes what,
what should be...

500
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:02,771
...the meal combination and...

501
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:03,899
Do one thing.

502
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,307
If Mrs. Shishodiya had been there...

503
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:11,314
...then what would she have
chosen for these guests...

504
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,576
...you choose that.

505
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:15,911
As you please, ma'am!

506
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:28,482
Nobody is there to receive us.
- Now don't start this!

507
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,720
Welcome, Mr. And Mrs. Rajput.

508
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:32,454
How are you, Mahajan?
- Very well. Thank you.

509
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,388
It doesn't look like there
has been a second marriage.

510
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:38,128
So what? Marriage is done for
yourself and not for others.

511
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:41,904
There you are, Malini.

512
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:43,496
Hello, Shekhar! Hello, Vishaka.

513
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,475
Hi, how are you? How is Vikram?

514
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,902
You know, he has...

515
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:49,037
No matter how many times he
marries, he will remain the same.

516
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:52,474
Guests have come and
he is not at home.

517
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,808
Am I right, Malini?

518
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:56,079
Well, who can escape from
a policeman's eyes?

519
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:59,481
He will be here soon. Till then
we will go and sit in the lounge?

520
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:01,825
Actually it's all right. We will
manage. Thank you so much.

521
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:02,951
We will manage.

522
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:05,491
I had told you not to bring me here.

523
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:09,662
A sister is not a guest in her
brother's house, Shekhar.

524
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:12,926
Mahajan, where is Vikram's
wife? Introduce her.

525
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,536
Sure. This way please.

526
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:17,566
Jia!
- Yes!

527
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,968
Why are you standing
here like a thief?

528
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:24,507
They have come to meet you.
Go and meet them.

529
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,642
Yeah! Please!

530
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:34,050
Thank you, Mahajan. What
did you say was her name?

531
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:36,183
Jia! Jia Rao!

532
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,191
I have not heard of
this name before.

533
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,091
Excuse me, sir. I will arrange
for some tea and biscuit.

534
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:44,628
Please make yourself comfortable.

535
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:45,927
Thank you.

536
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:48,562
Now please don't form your
opinion before meeting her.

537
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:53,771
I have formed an opinion.
Look at her attitude.

538
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,072
It's been so long since we came.

539
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,579
And she has still not
come to meet us.

540
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,543
Good evening, Mr. Rajput!

541
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:05,917
Hi!
- Hi! - Vishaka!

542
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,753
So you are Jia!
- It's a pleasure meeting you!

543
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:08,883
Same here!

544
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,552
I hope you people are
comfortable here.

545
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:13,020
Its okay! Please have a seat!
- Yes!

546
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:15,860
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.

547
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,565
Good evening, ma'am!
- Good evening!

548
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:20,231
Good evening, sir! Your tea!

549
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:28,737
You're not as Vikram had
described you to be.

550
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:31,912
What had you expected?

551
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,052
Just that you won't
be so young in age.

552
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:39,715
But Jia, you are really nice the
way you are. You are so sweet.

553
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:43,025
Are you happy, Jia?
- A lot.

554
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,188
With Vikram too?

555
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:51,997
Yes. Actually everything
happened so suddenly!

556
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,528
That... I had never thought
that in a moment...

557
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:57,870
...life could change so drastically.

558
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:00,001
Just keep one thing in mind.

559
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:03,707
If you have a cousin, then
don't invite him to Gajner.

560
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,109
Please!

561
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,683
You know what?

562
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:19,223
I will leave you both alone.

563
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:24,296
My talks are not as
bad as she thinks.

564
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,569
After marriage I understood
that policemen talk less...

565
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,702
...and they accuse more.

566
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,207
Actually Jia, Shekhar is very
possessive about Anamika.

567
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,743
He considered her as
his younger sister.

568
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,582
The way Malini can't hear
a word against Vikram...

569
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:45,815
...the same is with Shekhar.

570
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:47,316
I understand.

571
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:51,591
But when I came to know that Vikram
has got married again...

572
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:53,857
...you can't guess how happy I was.

573
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:56,926
I get a feeling that you both will
be really happy with each other.

574
00:40:58,269 --> 00:40:59,327
Thanks.

575
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:09,804
Sweetheart, your brother is here!

576
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:12,606
If he saw me here alone,
then he won't even...

577
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,776
...be able to bring a formal
smile on his face.

578
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:35,639
I thought we were invited
here for dinner.

579
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:38,904
That's what are we doing.

580
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:41,236
Mourning.

581
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,706
Usually people are so silent
in someone's mourning.

582
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,985
Some people here don't
know how to talk.

583
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:53,781
That's why no topic
is being discussed.

584
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:57,658
Why are you so conscious
regarding Jia?

585
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:02,061
How will she learn if we don't talk?

586
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,672
Vikram, why don't you
bring Jia home someday?

587
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:12,736
Don't wait for an invitation.

588
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,944
Life is not so long to keep
waiting for invitations.

589
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,682
Do you know how to play polo, Jia?

590
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:23,947
Polo! No, but... - Then how will
you spend time in Gajner?

591
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,023
I will, I mean...
- I understand.

592
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,692
You must be spending a lot of time...

593
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,697
...because you don't
have anything to do.

594
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,701
Gajner's staff has trained
Anamika so well...

595
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,295
...as if she is a automatic machine.

596
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,232
You don't even need
to press the button.

597
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:49,771
Jia is a very good artist.

598
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:52,305
Maybe you can start painting again.

599
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:53,775
That's nice.

600
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,445
Let's see, how good
a painter you are.

601
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:01,718
If you want to paint a symbolic
painting of Gajner...

602
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:04,124
...then what would you draw?

603
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:06,454
Symbolic.

604
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:13,863
Front elevation of the palace...
with a turban on top.

605
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:16,197
I don't think so.

606
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:26,009
A palace amidst the dessert.

607
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:27,809
Try again.

608
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:36,758
Gajner's reflection in the lake.

609
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:42,429
You still haven't understood
Gajner completely.

610
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:46,768
If you want to draw Gajner
in one symbol...

611
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:49,305
...then that symbol is Anamika.

612
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:08,386
That was really mean Shekar.

613
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,519
What did I say?

614
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:14,793
You very well know what you
said and what you have done!

615
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:16,525
Please go and bring him back.

616
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:28,003
One drink for me too.

617
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,415
You didn't hear or you aren't
interested in talking.

618
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:45,827
I am not interested in
anything that brings...

619
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:49,491
...that tragedy called Anamika
back in my present.

620
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,426
Why are you accusing me for it?

621
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:56,297
You think about Anamika
everyday yourself.

622
00:44:56,841 --> 00:44:57,899
Cheers.

623
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:00,834
What I do with Anamika's
memories and what not...

624
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:03,106
...that's my lookout.

625
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:06,442
But if you talk about Anamika
in front of that poor Jia...

626
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:08,917
Jia! She will always
be a deprived soul.

627
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:12,845
Forget me, everything in Gajner...

628
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:16,859
...marks Anamika's presence.

629
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:19,193
Whether you see her or not.

630
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,128
Anamika is present in Gajner.

631
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:22,924
You are a police officer,
so be that.

632
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,535
Don't try to be a judge
and pass judgement.

633
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:28,872
Anamika is dead.

634
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,864
And now my wife's name is Jia.

635
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:36,470
You are my sister's husband,
that's why I tolerated it.

636
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:38,339
But just today.

637
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:40,874
You are my wife's brother, that's
why I kept quiet then...

638
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,009
...and now too.

639
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:45,884
But don't be under
any delusion that...

640
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:48,151
...I don't know the truth
behind Anamika's death.

641
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,088
Thanks for the drink.

642
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:03,897
Sometimes Vikram does get angry.

643
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,104
But then, life hasn't
been fair to him.

644
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:09,637
And you know.

645
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:12,906
Everything that happened between
him and Anamika that...

646
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:15,510
What had happened?

647
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,578
Can we leave?

648
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:18,980
Oh!

649
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:21,648
God he's getting impatient.

650
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:39,943
If you want to make your
marriage successful...

651
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,535
...then don't wander into
knowing what happened.

652
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:47,076
What you don't know,
is good for you.

653
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,347
Take care, good night.

654
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:53,481
Will you come now?

655
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:57,961
Sorry for all this.
- It's alright.

656
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:28,987
Sorry.

657
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:35,994
Jia!

658
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:39,060
Jia!

659
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:46,667
Sorry.

660
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:49,007
Sorry, I am late.

661
00:47:51,682 --> 00:47:52,740
No more sorry.

662
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:55,016
Shall we go somewhere far
away from this sorry?

663
00:47:58,155 --> 00:47:59,486
Seems like it might rain.

664
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:03,491
Narayan! A raincoat for the madam.

665
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:05,686
Where are we going?

666
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:09,761
Coming closer to each other.

667
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:13,560
I know I am a difficult husband.

668
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:17,031
But I will try to be easy.

669
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:21,042
Do you know riding?
- Yes, of course.

670
00:48:21,111 --> 00:48:22,169
That's good.

671
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:23,372
Then today I will show you Gajner.

672
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:24,709
Come here! Come here!

673
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:26,044
Isn't she a beauty!

674
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:28,177
Just remember one thing.

675
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:31,317
Don't go that way.

676
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:34,589
You got to control her
and ride her well.

677
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:41,663
Why not go that way?
- Because I said so, okay.

678
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,200
Come, come, come.

679
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:46,059
Come on, beauty.

680
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,278
Jia!

681
00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:05,680
Jia!

682
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,148
Jia!

683
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:08,350
Jia, don't go that way!

684
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,688
Jia!

685
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:45,653
She's there.

686
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:48,126
She's somewhere around.

687
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:54,400
I will find her! I will!

688
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:58,138
Then there will be a storm again!

689
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:04,814
And once again she will be
back in Gajner with a bang!

690
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,358
You said you knew horse-riding.

691
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:26,227
Do you know how dangerous it is?

692
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:28,229
I am sorry, Vikram.

693
00:50:29,907 --> 00:50:31,169
But how long will I say
that I don't know this...

694
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:33,175
...I don't know that.

695
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:35,776
I couldn't even be a good escort.

696
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,312
I don't want to lose you, Vikram.

697
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:44,182
I want to be your life.

698
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:47,654
Please be a bit patient with me.

699
00:50:52,196 --> 00:50:53,254
It's my fault, Jia.

700
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:56,797
We shouldn't have come to
Gajner after marriage.

701
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:03,197
This place can't see me happy.

702
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:08,669
I am sorry.

703
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,338
Forgive me.

704
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:16,413
I hope you aren't angry with me.

705
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,892
Come on, let's go.

706
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:26,287
Stop crying.

707
00:51:26,764 --> 00:51:27,822
Stop crying.

708
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:31,227
Otherwise the people of
Gajner will think that...

709
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,428
...something is... you
know what I mean.

710
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,717
Come on, let's go.

711
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:10,998
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning, Mr. Mahajan.

712
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,739
Mr. Mahajan, do you have matches?

713
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:17,609
Yes.

714
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:20,273
But I am sorry, I don't
have cigarette.

715
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:22,612
After Mrs. Shishodiya's demise
no one smokes here.

716
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:26,281
No, even I don't smoke but
it's a bit cold today...

717
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:29,348
...so I thought I would light
up the fireplace. - Sure.

718
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:30,684
Thanks.

719
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:44,768
Give me some work, too.

720
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:49,705
Trust me, I know these
things very well.

721
00:52:51,448 --> 00:52:52,506
There is such a lot of difference
between you...

722
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:53,641
...and Mrs. Shishodiya.

723
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:56,577
Like?

724
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:00,313
No, no, I was just saying it.

725
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:03,657
Even I know a bit.

726
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:08,326
The biggest difference is that
she was very beautiful.

727
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:10,925
Isn't it?

728
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,935
Everything about her was beautiful.

729
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:17,339
Her dress, her hairstyle,
appearance.

730
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,339
Everything was a piece of art.

731
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:22,736
But...

732
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,342
But?

733
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:27,812
A person can marry the most
beautiful person in the world.

734
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:30,945
But it is not easy to
maintain relationships.

735
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,078
What has happened to you?

736
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:40,418
What's with the new hairstyle?

737
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:44,422
Earlier it was just hair,
there wasn't any style.

738
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,033
What was the need to do all this?

739
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:54,836
You like all this, isn't it?

740
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,967
If I liked all this, then
why would I have liked you?

741
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:06,041
My Jia is lost somewhere
in all this.

742
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:08,642
I am extremely sorry, sir.

743
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:11,512
If the matter wouldn't
have been serious...

744
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:12,850
...then I would have
never disturbed you.

745
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,524
Ms. Malini is firing Mahesh
and Hanumant from their jobs.

746
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,051
They have been working with
us for the past 10 years.

747
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:20,187
What happened?

748
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:22,996
There was an expensive vase in
the library of Mrs. Shishodiya.

749
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:24,525
And it's missing, that's why she...

750
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:26,000
Ask Malini to talk to me.

751
00:55:26,803 --> 00:55:27,861
Right away, sir.

752
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:33,474
Jia, now you should
handle these matters.

753
00:55:33,944 --> 00:55:35,468
If that vase has been misplaced or...

754
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:36,603
It's not been misplaced.

755
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:38,675
And nor has anyone stolen it.

756
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:39,873
Then?

757
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:44,753
It's right there, in the
drawer. But broken.

758
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,481
I am sorry Vikram, actually
I broke the vase...

759
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:50,890
...and I was scared
so I hid it there.

760
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:56,958
Who were you scared of?

761
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:00,033
For God's sake. Jia, all
of this belongs to you.

762
00:56:00,504 --> 00:56:01,835
Whether you break it
or set it on fire.

763
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:03,702
The only person who
should mind is me.

764
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:07,101
Stop behaving like a caretaker.

765
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:12,511
You are prince Vikram Aditya
Singh Shishodiya's wife.

766
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,248
So start behaving like my wife.

767
00:56:17,788 --> 00:56:19,983
I can never be like
that Mrs. Shishodiya.

768
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:22,250
Which Mrs. Shishodiya?

769
00:56:23,527 --> 00:56:25,995
Like the Mrs. Shishodiya
Gajner was used to.

770
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:28,526
Whoever comes to meet me,
they just come...

771
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:30,930
...to compare me with Anamika.

772
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:35,001
Am I beautiful like Anamika?

773
00:56:36,006 --> 00:56:37,598
Am I a social figure or not.

774
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:39,207
Do I have a class or not.

775
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:41,201
What kind of clothes do I wear?

776
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,006
That's all what people say.

777
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,206
Is she as good as her?

778
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,614
Maybe that's why you married me.

779
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:51,277
Because I am a simple inexperienced
middle-class girl.

780
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:53,819
And no one can gossip about me.

781
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:56,952
Like the way everyone would
talk about Anamika.

782
00:56:58,829 --> 00:56:59,887
What gossip?

783
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:02,556
What have you heard about Anamika?

784
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,958
No, that...

785
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:08,698
I meant to say that...

786
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:10,296
What was the need to indulge
yourself in all that?

787
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:17,979
After coming to Gajner you...
you are not the same Jia.

788
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:21,574
Just look at you, what
you have become.

789
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,848
It's not going to work out.

790
00:57:29,192 --> 00:57:30,591
We can never be happy.

791
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,188
Sorry.

792
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:37,596
If you think we cannot
stay happy together...

793
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,329
...then I will go back.

794
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:45,205
But I can't see a reason
why we can't be happy.

795
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:47,733
We are happy with this marriage.

796
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:50,610
I am happy! You are happy!

797
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:53,616
Believe me, we both are very happy.

798
00:58:03,627 --> 00:58:06,687
Fine! I agree if you say so.

799
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:13,633
We are happy.

800
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:23,636
What did you tell Jia about Anamika?

801
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:26,379
Take a seat, I will get tea for you.

802
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,912
First answer my question!

803
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,320
I didn't tell Jia anything
about Anamika!

804
00:58:55,078 --> 00:58:57,137
Shekar hasn't discussed
about Anamika, too.

805
00:58:58,415 --> 00:58:59,677
Then who?

806
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:01,807
You Vikram.

807
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:04,278
You don't want to leave
Anamika yourself.

808
00:59:04,888 --> 00:59:05,946
Why did you get married?

809
00:59:06,423 --> 00:59:07,947
So that you can forget Anamika.

810
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:09,750
But atleast try doing that.

811
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:15,426
Or is it that you like being
sad thinking about Anamika.

812
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,305
I am giving Gajner a last chance.

813
00:59:27,444 --> 00:59:29,708
If I am not happy, then
I will sell everything...

814
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:32,976
...and go far away from here.

815
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:25,125
Vikram!

816
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:27,501
Vikram are you going somewhere?
- Mumbai!

817
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:29,762
Then I too...
- I don't need an escort.

818
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:34,434
But... - Please Jia, I have forced
you for the marriage.

819
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:37,807
And now it's important that we stay
apart for 2-3 days and think.

820
01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:41,440
Why do I get angry like this?

821
01:00:41,518 --> 01:00:43,349
And why do I get angry
on you like this?

822
01:00:44,955 --> 01:00:46,013
You will get a break, too.

823
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:48,382
Take care!

824
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:55,988
Look Vikram, stay angry
with me but be with me.

825
01:00:56,533 --> 01:00:58,364
Scold me, but be with me.

826
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:02,234
Don't talk to me but
be with me, Vikram.

827
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:03,801
Vikram, I don't have anyone
else in Gajner...

828
01:01:03,873 --> 01:01:05,807
...except for you.
- Jia, please.

829
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,309
Vikram.
- Try to understand, please.

830
01:01:08,812 --> 01:01:10,302
Babulal.
- Vikram.

831
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:12,906
Come on.

832
01:01:25,862 --> 01:01:29,559
Love can drown a person.

833
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:35,168
Love can drown a person.

834
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:01,393
Love.

835
01:02:01,464 --> 01:02:04,126
Love.

836
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,536
The heart desires love.

837
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:15,902
Life is useless without beloved.

838
01:02:16,312 --> 01:02:21,409
These moments of eagerness
are so sweet.

839
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:26,316
Moments of eagerness.

840
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:29,253
Love.

841
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:32,055
Love.

842
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:37,623
The heart desires... Iove.

843
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:10,364
There is silence reflecting
on your lips.

844
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:21,941
I never saw such an
attitude of yours.

845
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:28,548
As you raised your eyes
and looked at me.

846
01:03:29,085 --> 01:03:33,954
I was floored.

847
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:39,085
I was floored.

848
01:03:39,162 --> 01:03:41,562
Simplicity.

849
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,990
Simplicity.

850
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:50,130
The heart desires simplicity.

851
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:05,438
Mr. Mahajan, is there someone
in the west wing.

852
01:05:06,913 --> 01:05:08,676
No! No one goes there.

853
01:05:08,848 --> 01:05:09,906
Are you sure?

854
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,950
Excuse me madam, it's
restricted to go there.

855
01:05:22,895 --> 01:05:23,953
Ma'am!

856
01:06:59,925 --> 01:07:01,449
Ms. Jia, what are you doing here?

857
01:07:03,663 --> 01:07:05,563
I was a bit confused about the way.

858
01:07:05,865 --> 01:07:07,332
Actually I was looking for my room.

859
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:09,733
You have come in the
opposite direction.

860
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:11,331
This is the west wing.

861
01:07:11,937 --> 01:07:12,995
By the way, I always knew
that the west wing...

862
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,063
...always fascinated you.

863
01:07:15,408 --> 01:07:16,636
You wanted to see it.

864
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:19,070
It is not like that.
- It's absolutely natural.

865
01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:20,403
You should have told me...

866
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:22,071
...I would have made
all the arrangements.

867
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,778
Actually we are fortunate that Mr.
Vikram Aditya is not here.

868
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:28,347
But, now that you have come here...

869
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:30,651
...then you can fulfil your desire.

870
01:07:31,891 --> 01:07:33,085
Come, let me show you.

871
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:37,825
This was Anamika's dressing area.

872
01:07:38,631 --> 01:07:40,462
She would adorn herself here.

873
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:56,480
And this is Anamika's wardrobe.

874
01:07:56,982 --> 01:07:58,381
If we display her clothes,
then trust me...

875
01:07:58,451 --> 01:08:02,114
...this can beat any fashion
boutique in the country.

876
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:15,627
A flirt had once told
Anamika in the party...

877
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:18,398
...that clothes are not as
soft as they become...

878
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:20,496
...when you wear them.

879
01:08:21,407 --> 01:08:22,931
That flirt was right.

880
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:34,645
Touch this.

881
01:08:36,422 --> 01:08:39,414
Can a cloth be so soft and cosy?

882
01:08:42,461 --> 01:08:43,519
Feel it.

883
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,788
Go on feel it.

884
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:47,693
Tell me, how does it feel?

885
01:08:55,441 --> 01:08:56,499
And this!

886
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:03,448
Vikram Aditya and Anamika's bed.

887
01:09:05,484 --> 01:09:07,452
In a drunken state Mr. Vikram
Aditya once told me...

888
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,455
...that he knows a woman
whose desires increase...

889
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:12,514
...with every passing night.

890
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,455
Except for me, no one else knew...

891
01:09:15,528 --> 01:09:18,622
...that he was talking about Anamika.

892
01:09:34,814 --> 01:09:36,042
Why don't you do one thing?

893
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:38,816
Until Mr. Vikram doesn't return...

894
01:09:39,852 --> 01:09:41,513
...why don't you stay here.

895
01:09:43,823 --> 01:09:48,192
Feel those days, that
happiness. Anamika.

896
01:09:51,497 --> 01:09:52,555
She is asleep on this bed.

897
01:09:55,634 --> 01:09:56,828
Wear her clothes.

898
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,535
Sit there and adorn yourself.

899
01:10:00,706 --> 01:10:03,800
I promise you, I won't tell anyone.

900
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,166
'Mrs. Shishodiya's norms
are followed here.'

901
01:12:16,642 --> 01:12:18,633
'Even after her death,
everything here...

902
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:21,373
...runs as per her orders.'

903
01:12:31,657 --> 01:12:33,056
I've not permitted you to come here!

904
01:12:36,662 --> 01:12:37,720
Now please leave!

905
01:12:37,796 --> 01:12:39,263
That's not fair, Malini!

906
01:12:39,665 --> 01:12:41,064
You are telling your guest to leave.

907
01:12:41,133 --> 01:12:44,398
I know the difference between
Gajner's guests and enemies.

908
01:12:44,737 --> 01:12:46,671
So you too mind my coming here?

909
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:49,867
I mind everything
which Vikram minds.

910
01:12:51,677 --> 01:12:54,737
Please leave, Sanjay. Before
somebody sees us here.

911
01:12:55,147 --> 01:12:57,741
But I can see that somebody is
surreptitiously watching us.

912
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:03,748
So she is Vikram's new wife.

913
01:13:03,822 --> 01:13:05,289
Don't cross your limits, Sanjay.

914
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:08,751
Without crossing limits, you
can't meet beautiful things!

915
01:13:15,034 --> 01:13:17,696
Hi! I am Sanjay! Anamika's
favourite cousin!

916
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:24,967
Hi.

917
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:32,777
Jia Rao. Right?
- Yes.

918
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:34,716
You must have heard about me.

919
01:13:35,721 --> 01:13:37,780
Sorry. I don't know you.

920
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:40,250
Nobody praises me in Gajner.

921
01:13:41,193 --> 01:13:44,321
Only Anamika used to talk about me.

922
01:13:45,731 --> 01:13:48,325
If Vikram Aditya returned then
it will be really bad for us!

923
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:50,795
Fine, Jia. I will leave.

924
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:52,862
And we will meet soon.

925
01:13:53,739 --> 01:13:55,934
I am afraid that you have
recently got married.

926
01:13:56,008 --> 01:13:57,805
And Vikram left you alone.

927
01:14:00,345 --> 01:14:01,403
I too am alone.

928
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:04,472
See you around, Jia. Bye.

929
01:14:09,088 --> 01:14:10,146
Please do me a favour, Jia.

930
01:14:10,756 --> 01:14:12,747
When Vikram returns, please don't...

931
01:14:12,825 --> 01:14:14,816
...tell him that Sanjay
had come here.

932
01:14:15,227 --> 01:14:17,161
He will kill Sanjay.

933
01:14:18,097 --> 01:14:20,827
He is not so bad that
he will kill somebody.

934
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:24,167
He is not bad. His anger is bad.

935
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:28,168
And that anger can kill anybody.

936
01:15:07,146 --> 01:15:08,204
Yes.

937
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,805
Malini, did he say when
will he return?

938
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:13,341
He should be back by this evening.

939
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,220
It's raining so heavily.

940
01:15:17,823 --> 01:15:19,552
Yes, it has never rained
so heavily before.

941
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:22,420
In fact it doesn't rain
at this time of the year.

942
01:15:23,896 --> 01:15:25,363
It's not a good sign.

943
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:28,358
Not a good sign? Meaning?

944
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:31,564
Look, it's so dark at daytime.

945
01:15:32,838 --> 01:15:33,964
You stay in your room.

946
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,570
If you need anything,
then call me. Okay.

947
01:15:53,392 --> 01:15:54,450
Hello!

948
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:55,986
Hello, Vikram.

949
01:15:56,061 --> 01:15:58,256
Jia, listen. Hi. Is
it raining there?

950
01:15:58,463 --> 01:16:00,260
Yes, it's been raining
for the past 3 hours.

951
01:16:00,866 --> 01:16:02,925
Its 6 o'clock. And it feels
like it's midnight.

952
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:04,929
You are returning today,
aren't you, Vikram?

953
01:16:06,872 --> 01:16:07,930
I can't say.

954
01:16:08,006 --> 01:16:10,474
The flight is not departing.
I don't know what's happening.

955
01:16:11,009 --> 01:16:12,271
Meaning you are not
returning today too!

956
01:16:12,878 --> 01:16:13,936
Hello! Vikram!

957
01:16:15,147 --> 01:16:17,945
Vikram! I feel very
strange here, Vikram!

958
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:20,617
If possible then please
return by tonight! Hello!

959
01:16:20,886 --> 01:16:21,944
Jia!

960
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:25,947
Hello, Jia! Hello!

961
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:28,284
Hello!

962
01:18:06,325 --> 01:18:07,383
Malini!

963
01:18:09,194 --> 01:18:10,252
Malini!

964
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,388
Malini!

965
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:15,391
Malini!

966
01:18:16,535 --> 01:18:18,196
What happened?
- I saw her!

967
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:21,201
I saw here in the courtyard!
- Whom?

968
01:18:21,473 --> 01:18:22,531
Anamika!

969
01:18:23,408 --> 01:18:26,002
Believe me, Malini! I
am speaking the truth!

970
01:18:27,145 --> 01:18:29,079
I know that you are
speaking the truth.

971
01:18:30,282 --> 01:18:34,150
But not you... she has seen you.

972
01:18:37,356 --> 01:18:39,415
You shouldn't have gone
to the west wing.

973
01:18:41,026 --> 01:18:42,084
It's not good.

974
01:18:43,228 --> 01:18:47,164
Maybe she is not happy with Vikram
Aditya's second marriage.

975
01:18:52,371 --> 01:18:55,238
But Anamika died in an accident.

976
01:18:56,241 --> 01:18:59,108
There are certain deaths
in which a person dies...

977
01:19:00,379 --> 01:19:01,778
...but still lives on.

978
01:19:03,382 --> 01:19:04,440
What kind of death?

979
01:19:06,051 --> 01:19:08,451
Just relax. Don't think about this.

980
01:19:09,054 --> 01:19:11,249
Tonight you stay with me. Come.

981
01:19:18,397 --> 01:19:19,455
You will be safe here.

982
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:39,608
Let's go.

983
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:26,388
Rana!

984
01:20:33,538 --> 01:20:34,869
Did you know Anamika?

985
01:20:39,144 --> 01:20:40,202
I am her guide.

986
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,475
I have given her a tour
of this desert.

987
01:20:47,686 --> 01:20:52,555
She too would bring breakfast
for me everyday... for sure.

988
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:03,225
What happened to her?
How did she die?

989
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:04,359
No! She didn't die!

990
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:08,771
Nothing has happened
to her! She is alive!

991
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:12,907
She has only gone somewhere.

992
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:23,583
Where? Where did she go?

993
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:29,253
She had a fight with sir.

994
01:21:32,197 --> 01:21:33,596
Sir shouldn't have done that.

995
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:37,725
Sir almost killed her.

996
01:21:47,212 --> 01:21:52,411
I am scared of Ioneliness.

997
01:21:52,817 --> 01:21:56,617
Come and embrace me.

998
01:21:58,356 --> 01:22:03,293
Now my heart is afraid of things.

999
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:07,756
Don't go away from my sight.

1000
01:22:09,434 --> 01:22:19,776
Come and sing a love
song of loyalty.

1001
01:22:21,246 --> 01:22:23,771
You are love.

1002
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:30,314
Solace. Solace.

1003
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:33,249
My heart desires solace.

1004
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:34,656
So?

1005
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:38,993
You learnt horse riding.

1006
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:44,857
What else can I do here alone?

1007
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:48,468
Even I was alone there.

1008
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:53,473
You are alone here, too.

1009
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,272
And you left me so that
you could decide...

1010
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:00,750
...what to do with our relationship.

1011
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:05,547
I have decided.

1012
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:16,425
I have decided, Jia.

1013
01:23:21,306 --> 01:23:22,500
I want to come closer to you.

1014
01:23:23,308 --> 01:23:24,832
'Sir almost killed her.'

1015
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:32,307
I understand I have been
really unfair to you.

1016
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:34,376
Forgive me.

1017
01:23:36,454 --> 01:23:38,319
I just want us to be happy.

1018
01:23:40,325 --> 01:23:43,658
Me too, sweetheart. Me too.

1019
01:23:49,467 --> 01:23:50,729
I missed this beautiful hand.

1020
01:23:56,341 --> 01:23:57,740
I missed this beautiful forehead.

1021
01:24:02,614 --> 01:24:04,081
I missed this lovely cheek.

1022
01:24:09,821 --> 01:24:10,879
This cheek too.

1023
01:24:39,718 --> 01:24:41,447
I missed this lovely neck of yours.

1024
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:44,846
I saw her.

1025
01:24:49,861 --> 01:24:50,919
Who?

1026
01:24:52,931 --> 01:24:53,989
Anamika.

1027
01:25:12,951 --> 01:25:15,419
The more I try to forget her...

1028
01:25:15,487 --> 01:25:17,955
...the more you bring her between us.

1029
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:20,017
You are obsessed with her.

1030
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:24,624
Maybe because I don't know
much about Anamika.

1031
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:27,422
And whenever I try
to find out then...

1032
01:25:27,499 --> 01:25:29,626
...instead of telling me,
people hide things.

1033
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:36,637
What do you want to know about her?
- The truth.

1034
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,441
If I had known the truth...
then I would have...

1035
01:25:39,511 --> 01:25:41,502
...told you without you asking me.

1036
01:25:42,447 --> 01:25:44,574
Anamika's truth died with her.

1037
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:04,059
I am sorry, Vikram.

1038
01:26:04,936 --> 01:26:08,872
I promise I won't talk about things
which I shouldn't talk.

1039
01:26:12,477 --> 01:26:14,468
But I will liberate
you, myself and...

1040
01:26:14,546 --> 01:26:17,208
...Gajner from those memories.

1041
01:26:18,883 --> 01:26:20,680
And I have an idea.

1042
01:26:24,489 --> 01:26:27,686
Everybody talks about the parties
which were given in Gajner.

1043
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:30,085
The celebration, the commotion.

1044
01:26:31,095 --> 01:26:33,029
Let's have those parties
again, Vikram.

1045
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,098
Vikram!

1046
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:46,035
You didn't answer me!

1047
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:51,572
So you want to begin the
same things in Gajner.

1048
01:26:54,052 --> 01:26:55,110
Again those things will happen...

1049
01:26:55,186 --> 01:26:56,244
...which used to happen
in those parties.

1050
01:27:11,536 --> 01:27:13,060
To liberate us from those memories...

1051
01:27:13,137 --> 01:27:14,604
...you are reviving those memories.

1052
01:27:30,955 --> 01:27:34,288
So you too want to start
those parties in Gajner.

1053
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,618
I didn't say that.

1054
01:27:38,997 --> 01:27:40,726
These things were discussed
in my absence.

1055
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:45,669
It feels as if Anamika
has returned as Jia.

1056
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,809
Darkness runs away from light.

1057
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:01,609
You will be happy only when
Gajner will be happy.

1058
01:28:03,588 --> 01:28:05,021
That liveliness was
for somebody else.

1059
01:28:06,057 --> 01:28:07,888
What did I get in those parties?

1060
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:09,752
You know that!

1061
01:28:09,894 --> 01:28:11,191
The problem is your point of view.

1062
01:28:11,896 --> 01:28:13,227
Had I been in your place...

1063
01:28:13,298 --> 01:28:15,061
...I would have accepted
Jia's suggestion.

1064
01:28:26,611 --> 01:28:28,010
I think this will look very pretty.

1065
01:28:30,949 --> 01:28:32,007
Malini!

1066
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:34,909
This wouldn't have been
possible without you.

1067
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:36,615
My pleasure.

1068
01:28:36,754 --> 01:28:39,621
I used to dress up Mrs. Shishodiya
for these parties.

1069
01:28:40,925 --> 01:28:43,189
Today Vikram won't be able
to take his eyes off you.

1070
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:46,755
Excuse me.

1071
01:28:50,868 --> 01:28:52,233
Malini, the mask's sample.

1072
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,273
And here is you mask.

1073
01:28:58,876 --> 01:28:59,934
Mask!

1074
01:29:00,845 --> 01:29:02,710
This is the norm of this
masquerade party.

1075
01:29:03,381 --> 01:29:05,372
All the guests are hidden
behind masks.

1076
01:29:05,817 --> 01:29:07,648
And you have to find your lover...

1077
01:29:07,719 --> 01:29:11,348
...meaning your husband and
then dance with him.

1078
01:29:12,657 --> 01:29:14,648
It's said that the one
whose love is true...

1079
01:29:15,994 --> 01:29:18,690
...they find their love
hidden behind the mask.

1080
01:31:10,441 --> 01:31:12,500
I told you. You will come to me.

1081
01:31:14,278 --> 01:31:15,336
How dare you!

1082
01:31:17,515 --> 01:31:18,982
Hey! What's the big deal?

1083
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:20,475
Let go of my hand!

1084
01:31:20,785 --> 01:31:21,877
Come on, we were just dancing!

1085
01:31:21,953 --> 01:31:23,215
Don't touch me!

1086
01:31:29,961 --> 01:31:31,326
I just wanted to celebrate!

1087
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:42,803
Celebrate my foot! What
are you doing here?

1088
01:31:45,977 --> 01:31:47,035
Get out of here!

1089
01:31:47,979 --> 01:31:49,037
Vikram!

1090
01:31:54,018 --> 01:31:55,076
Vikram!

1091
01:31:55,253 --> 01:31:56,311
Vikram, stop it!

1092
01:31:56,387 --> 01:31:58,116
How dare you touch her!
- Vikram! - Vikram!

1093
01:31:58,189 --> 01:31:59,554
She was Anamika!
- Vikram!

1094
01:31:59,857 --> 01:32:01,825
Today you met Jia!
- Stop it!

1095
01:32:01,893 --> 01:32:02,951
I said stop it!

1096
01:32:03,494 --> 01:32:04,552
Vikram!
- Let go!

1097
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:06,529
Stop it!
- Let go of me!

1098
01:32:06,831 --> 01:32:07,889
Stop it!

1099
01:32:09,834 --> 01:32:10,892
You are disgusting!

1100
01:32:11,202 --> 01:32:12,999
Come on! We are leaving! Let's go!

1101
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:16,567
Come on! - Come! Come on, Vishaka!

1102
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:20,043
You will be sorry for this, Vikram!

1103
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,398
Don't stop me! Don't surrender!

1104
01:32:46,204 --> 01:32:48,866
Don't stop me! Don't surrender!

1105
01:32:49,874 --> 01:32:52,502
Don't stop me! Don't surrender!

1106
01:32:53,578 --> 01:32:56,604
Don't stop me! Don't surrender!

1107
01:33:04,622 --> 01:33:07,887
You dwell in my eyes.

1108
01:33:10,394 --> 01:33:13,192
You dwell in my heart.

1109
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:18,902
You dwell in my dreams.

1110
01:33:20,638 --> 01:33:24,199
My heart thinks. My heart wants.

1111
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:26,206
My heart asks for...

1112
01:33:26,577 --> 01:33:27,635
Company.

1113
01:33:28,246 --> 01:33:30,077
My heart wants...

1114
01:33:30,414 --> 01:33:31,472
Company.

1115
01:33:31,582 --> 01:33:33,550
My heart asks for...

1116
01:33:33,985 --> 01:33:35,043
Company.

1117
01:33:35,586 --> 01:33:36,917
Your company.

1118
01:33:37,555 --> 01:33:38,613
Company.

1119
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:40,384
Your company.

1120
01:33:56,374 --> 01:33:59,172
Don't stop me! Don't surrender!

1121
01:33:59,944 --> 01:34:03,175
Don't stop me! Don't surrender!

1122
01:34:11,122 --> 01:34:12,953
The ambience is crazy.

1123
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:14,682
The moment too is lovely.

1124
01:34:14,959 --> 01:34:16,654
The season is pleasant.

1125
01:34:16,727 --> 01:34:18,627
Why do you torment me?

1126
01:34:22,233 --> 01:34:23,962
There is a storm in my heart.

1127
01:34:24,168 --> 01:34:25,965
My desires are aroused.

1128
01:34:26,103 --> 01:34:27,695
I crave for you.

1129
01:34:27,772 --> 01:34:29,467
Why do you torment me?

1130
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:31,436
There is craving.

1131
01:34:31,575 --> 01:34:33,475
There is merriment too.

1132
01:34:33,577 --> 01:34:35,169
This separation is difficult.

1133
01:34:35,246 --> 01:34:37,214
Why do you torment me?

1134
01:34:37,281 --> 01:34:40,375
You dwell in my eyes.

1135
01:34:40,718 --> 01:34:43,983
You dwell in my feelings.

1136
01:34:44,422 --> 01:34:47,653
You dwell in my heart.

1137
01:34:47,725 --> 01:34:51,092
My heart thinks. My heart wants.

1138
01:34:51,262 --> 01:34:52,991
My heart asks for.

1139
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:54,455
Company.

1140
01:34:55,099 --> 01:34:56,726
My heart wants.

1141
01:34:57,034 --> 01:34:58,262
Company.

1142
01:34:58,636 --> 01:35:00,365
My heart asks for.

1143
01:35:00,671 --> 01:35:02,002
Company.

1144
01:35:02,273 --> 01:35:03,365
Your company.

1145
01:35:04,642 --> 01:35:05,700
Company.

1146
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:07,068
Your company.

1147
01:35:13,651 --> 01:35:14,709
Yes!

1148
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:42,036
You are here in the west wing.

1149
01:35:45,249 --> 01:35:47,046
Now I will be seen here, Malini.

1150
01:35:48,486 --> 01:35:49,783
From today, this will be my bedroom.

1151
01:35:50,654 --> 01:35:52,383
Did you ask Vikram Aditya?

1152
01:35:53,357 --> 01:35:56,053
Vikram says that as far as Gajner's
affairs are concerned...

1153
01:35:56,127 --> 01:35:58,687
...I don't have to ask
anything from anybody.

1154
01:36:01,599 --> 01:36:03,066
I am giving you a task, Malini.

1155
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:05,063
It should be done by tomorrow.

1156
01:36:05,803 --> 01:36:07,065
What?

1157
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:09,662
Anamika's personal belongings...

1158
01:36:10,141 --> 01:36:12,075
...especially on which
A is embossed...

1159
01:36:12,143 --> 01:36:13,405
...shift it to the out house.

1160
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:18,277
I don't want to see those
things in Gajner.

1161
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:22,217
You mean to say all of Mrs.
Shishodiya's things...

1162
01:36:22,286 --> 01:36:23,753
I am Mrs. Shishodiya, Malini.

1163
01:36:26,323 --> 01:36:28,689
Anamika will be called Anamika.

1164
01:36:31,695 --> 01:36:34,823
In Gajner, I am Mrs. Shishodiya.

1165
01:36:38,702 --> 01:36:41,569
Yes... Mrs. Shishodiya.

1166
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:06,124
You know, I always used to find...

1167
01:37:06,197 --> 01:37:07,596
...Rajasthan a very secluded place.

1168
01:37:10,301 --> 01:37:12,792
But now I find it very romantic.

1169
01:37:15,272 --> 01:37:16,864
This all the heart's doing, Jia.

1170
01:37:25,649 --> 01:37:28,140
Is the wind blowing too hard or
is this too the heart's doing?

1171
01:37:34,792 --> 01:37:37,283
You are right. I think
a storm is approaching.

1172
01:37:40,898 --> 01:37:43,765
Jia! Jia, get out! Quick!
Quick! Down!

1173
01:37:44,335 --> 01:37:45,393
Just get down!

1174
01:38:02,219 --> 01:38:05,188
I told you! A storm will arrive!

1175
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:09,721
And it will bring many things along!

1176
01:39:14,992 --> 01:39:17,620
Vikram, sir has called
you for inquiry. Come.

1177
01:39:29,673 --> 01:39:31,265
What was the truth of...

1178
01:39:31,342 --> 01:39:32,400
...Anamika and your relationship?

1179
01:39:33,944 --> 01:39:35,434
You know that I know.

1180
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:41,443
There was so much rancour
for Anamika in your heart.

1181
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,544
You know that I know.

1182
01:39:45,856 --> 01:39:47,983
Anamika's death was not an accident.

1183
01:39:49,026 --> 01:39:50,755
You know that I know.

1184
01:39:51,729 --> 01:39:54,289
Only one man had the motive
for this murder.

1185
01:39:55,799 --> 01:39:57,426
Mr. Vikram Singh Shishodiya.

1186
01:39:58,402 --> 01:40:01,303
Will you confess killing Anamika?

1187
01:40:01,939 --> 01:40:02,997
Or shall I make you do it?

1188
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:13,912
I know my hatred... killed Anamika.

1189
01:40:16,987 --> 01:40:18,477
But why is this being called murder?

1190
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:22,055
Post-mortem report.

1191
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:26,029
A heavy blow on the head.
Here. In the middle.

1192
01:40:27,831 --> 01:40:31,062
It happens when the head is
hit with a heavy weapon.

1193
01:40:32,703 --> 01:40:33,863
Case of a broken skull.

1194
01:40:45,816 --> 01:40:48,341
Shekhar! You have arrested Vikram!

1195
01:40:48,919 --> 01:40:50,716
You think he has killed Anamika?

1196
01:40:52,089 --> 01:40:53,351
If you want to question
your husband...

1197
01:40:53,424 --> 01:40:55,790
...then sit at home and
wait for his return.

1198
01:40:56,894 --> 01:40:59,624
Here only I ask questions.
Excuse me.

1199
01:40:59,697 --> 01:41:00,755
But...

1200
01:41:09,106 --> 01:41:10,368
Go from here Jia.

1201
01:41:15,913 --> 01:41:16,971
Tell me where.

1202
01:41:21,385 --> 01:41:22,977
I thought I have started
to understand you.

1203
01:41:23,587 --> 01:41:27,387
Whatever you know about
me, I am all that.

1204
01:41:28,992 --> 01:41:32,120
What you don't know, that's Anamika.

1205
01:41:34,665 --> 01:41:36,656
Mumbai's most interesting
and fascinating celebrity...

1206
01:41:37,401 --> 01:41:38,459
...Anamika Shroff.

1207
01:41:39,002 --> 01:41:40,469
She came to Gajner on my invitation.

1208
01:41:41,138 --> 01:41:42,469
And stayed back forever.

1209
01:41:43,874 --> 01:41:45,398
The society would always gossip...

1210
01:41:45,476 --> 01:41:47,944
...that who would Anamika
Shroff marry.

1211
01:41:50,414 --> 01:41:51,472
They got their answer.

1212
01:41:53,884 --> 01:41:56,011
We first expressed our
love in the dessert.

1213
01:41:57,421 --> 01:41:59,946
And Anamika made her first promise
in that dessert, too.

1214
01:42:00,424 --> 01:42:03,018
I will love you a bit less,
but be loyal to you more.

1215
01:42:03,427 --> 01:42:04,553
But she turned out to be disloyal.

1216
01:42:07,698 --> 01:42:10,030
Her friends soon started
invading Gajner.

1217
01:42:10,901 --> 01:42:12,095
A new party in every three months.

1218
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,903
She turned Gajner into a night club.

1219
01:42:17,975 --> 01:42:19,567
In the beginning even
I would enjoy it.

1220
01:42:21,645 --> 01:42:23,442
But, behind all those activities...

1221
01:42:23,514 --> 01:42:25,448
...rumours started building up.

1222
01:42:27,718 --> 01:42:29,777
Anamika would be paired with
many different people.

1223
01:42:31,054 --> 01:42:32,453
Especially with that Sanjay...

1224
01:42:32,523 --> 01:42:33,990
...who was supposed to be his cousin.

1225
01:42:36,994 --> 01:42:39,053
Malini and I would helplessly
listen to all these news.

1226
01:42:42,466 --> 01:42:43,524
Then one day, after the party.

1227
01:42:45,469 --> 01:42:46,527
I couldn't tolerate it anymore.

1228
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:48,467
Look Vikram, you are
misunderstanding.

1229
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:50,063
There is nothing between
Sanjay and me.

1230
01:42:50,941 --> 01:42:53,671
I can see what the relation
is, and also hear it. You understand?

1231
01:42:53,744 --> 01:42:56,212
Fine, then I will prove it.

1232
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:57,742
And then you will feel ashamed.

1233
01:43:13,497 --> 01:43:14,555
I felt ashamed.

1234
01:43:16,099 --> 01:43:17,498
Not of the accusation,
but for the relation...

1235
01:43:17,568 --> 01:43:19,900
...between Anamika and me.

1236
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:23,501
Where is Anamika?

1237
01:43:28,979 --> 01:43:30,105
I asked where is Anamika?

1238
01:43:31,114 --> 01:43:34,242
Actually, she has gone to Karni
palace to talk to Sanjay.

1239
01:43:51,268 --> 01:43:52,599
Hello!
- Give the phone to Anamika.

1240
01:43:56,073 --> 01:43:57,131
Phone for you.

1241
01:43:58,275 --> 01:44:01,540
She had come again, to
explain everything.

1242
01:44:05,616 --> 01:44:06,810
That was our last meeting.

1243
01:44:08,285 --> 01:44:09,616
Please spare me and Gajner!

1244
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:10,878
We don't want you anymore.

1245
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:13,548
And before you turn this place
into a whorehouse, leave!

1246
01:44:13,891 --> 01:44:14,949
And get the hell out of my life.

1247
01:44:15,893 --> 01:44:18,555
Mrs. Shishodiya! Mrs. Shishodiya!

1248
01:44:18,962 --> 01:44:20,293
Please stop.

1249
01:44:20,764 --> 01:44:21,822
There is a storm brewing up!

1250
01:44:21,899 --> 01:44:23,560
And a dessert storm is very bad!

1251
01:44:23,901 --> 01:44:24,959
Please stop!

1252
01:44:26,837 --> 01:44:30,102
Mr. Vikram it's dangerous,
please stop her.

1253
01:44:30,974 --> 01:44:33,568
Let her die, I don't care.

1254
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,584
The storm was getting intense.

1255
01:44:52,863 --> 01:44:55,593
A little while later Malini
called and said that...

1256
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:57,657
...Anamika's jeep was found
in the dessert upside down

1257
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:00,928
But she was missing.

1258
01:45:04,608 --> 01:45:05,666
The police searched for her a lot...

1259
01:45:05,742 --> 01:45:07,073
...but she couldn't be found.

1260
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:13,676
She went missing in the dessert
in that sandstorm.

1261
01:45:20,223 --> 01:45:22,282
I want all of Vikram's
conversation on record.

1262
01:45:23,093 --> 01:45:24,355
Every word.
- Yes.

1263
01:45:24,628 --> 01:45:26,027
I'll just be back.
- Yes.

1264
01:45:26,096 --> 01:45:27,154
I am coming.

1265
01:45:31,101 --> 01:45:35,367
But the police say that
you murdered Anamika.

1266
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:37,038
Do you believe me or not?

1267
01:45:40,377 --> 01:45:42,174
I want to believe you, Vikram.

1268
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:46,106
Believe me.

1269
01:45:48,318 --> 01:45:50,718
I want to believe every
word you said.

1270
01:45:56,727 --> 01:45:58,854
Hello ma'am, do you feel that
he has murdered Anamika?

1271
01:45:58,929 --> 01:46:01,659
Ma'am, please tell us.

1272
01:46:01,732 --> 01:46:03,666
Ma'am! Ma'am!

1273
01:46:09,139 --> 01:46:10,800
It's alright Mrs. Shidhodiya,
it's alright.

1274
01:46:11,742 --> 01:46:13,141
It's alright. Just relax.

1275
01:46:13,343 --> 01:46:14,810
Go home, I will handle this.

1276
01:46:14,945 --> 01:46:16,003
Go home. Okay.

1277
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:17,137
Go home, go.

1278
01:46:17,681 --> 01:46:18,739
Ma'am.

1279
01:46:18,815 --> 01:46:19,873
Excuse me!

1280
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:21,008
Excuse me!

1281
01:46:32,696 --> 01:46:35,290
Don't worry, the decision will
be given in your favour.

1282
01:46:36,166 --> 01:46:37,224
I am the witness.

1283
01:46:37,901 --> 01:46:40,699
The day Anamika disappeared
you were in Gajner.

1284
01:46:41,304 --> 01:46:44,102
I had gone after her, to stop her.

1285
01:46:58,455 --> 01:47:00,320
And then I called you
from that same phone.

1286
01:47:01,858 --> 01:47:02,916
Hello Mr. Vikram.

1287
01:47:03,326 --> 01:47:05,453
The car is stuck up ahead.

1288
01:47:06,329 --> 01:47:08,058
There is no trace of Anamika.

1289
01:47:08,465 --> 01:47:09,727
I can't see here anywhere.

1290
01:47:10,467 --> 01:47:11,729
What can the law do?

1291
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,727
My testimony will save you.

1292
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:16,200
I know that you are innocent.

1293
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,137
I am only worried about Jia.

1294
01:47:20,143 --> 01:47:23,010
She is so innocent that she
thinks all this is true.

1295
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:26,005
I am afraid that she
might do something.

1296
01:47:28,285 --> 01:47:29,752
I think I need to be with her.

1297
01:47:30,754 --> 01:47:31,812
You take care.

1298
01:48:52,035 --> 01:48:53,093
Anamika!

1299
01:48:55,438 --> 01:48:56,496
Anamika!

1300
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,898
Anamika!

1301
01:49:12,055 --> 01:49:14,990
So you think Malini's testimony
will save you.

1302
01:49:17,394 --> 01:49:18,520
You were listening to
our conversation.

1303
01:49:19,462 --> 01:49:20,986
The police have to do their duty.

1304
01:49:22,866 --> 01:49:25,858
By the way, don't be too dependant
on Malini's testimony...

1305
01:49:25,936 --> 01:49:28,200
...because the court won't accept it.

1306
01:49:30,407 --> 01:49:31,465
Why?

1307
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:36,209
Because I will decide which
testimony reaches the court!

1308
01:49:39,082 --> 01:49:41,209
Was there anyone else in
your life before Anamika?

1309
01:49:44,087 --> 01:49:45,145
No.

1310
01:49:45,622 --> 01:49:46,884
After Jia?

1311
01:49:47,891 --> 01:49:48,949
No.

1312
01:49:53,897 --> 01:49:54,955
What are you doing?

1313
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:57,891
The line of love is situated here.

1314
01:49:59,236 --> 01:50:00,965
And there are three
lines in your hand.

1315
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,098
What do you mean to say?

1316
01:50:09,646 --> 01:50:10,908
Come with me. Come.

1317
01:50:34,938 --> 01:50:36,667
I still love Mr. Vikram.

1318
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:40,065
I love him more than anybody
could've ever loved him.

1319
01:50:42,412 --> 01:50:43,470
Anamika.

1320
01:50:44,681 --> 01:50:46,615
Don't you dare take that name here?

1321
01:50:48,218 --> 01:50:49,617
I am Mrs. Shishodiya.

1322
01:51:03,566 --> 01:51:04,624
I don't believe this.

1323
01:51:08,104 --> 01:51:09,969
You never believed me.

1324
01:51:11,975 --> 01:51:13,966
You always thought I hated you.

1325
01:51:15,312 --> 01:51:16,370
But that's not true.

1326
01:51:18,114 --> 01:51:19,513
It's just the way I am.

1327
01:51:25,388 --> 01:51:27,447
You are educated and still
believe in ghosts.

1328
01:51:28,725 --> 01:51:30,317
You wanted to know the
truth, isn't it?

1329
01:51:31,528 --> 01:51:36,522
Gajner's biggest truth is
that Malini loves Vikram.

1330
01:51:39,135 --> 01:51:41,330
I have lived all my life for Vikram.

1331
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:46,998
Anamika and your love can't
even be compared to my love.

1332
01:51:50,747 --> 01:51:52,339
Anamika didn't have any affair.

1333
01:51:53,416 --> 01:51:55,350
For her Sanjay was just a cousin.

1334
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:02,153
But I allured Sanjay and
proved her characterless.

1335
01:52:03,026 --> 01:52:04,084
Yes, Vikram.

1336
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:05,286
You are in Sanjay's room.

1337
01:52:06,696 --> 01:52:08,425
Or is this my misunderstanding, too.

1338
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:16,033
And that day, the storm rose
so that justice can be done...

1339
01:52:16,106 --> 01:52:18,631
...with my love.

1340
01:52:21,244 --> 01:52:23,041
Mr. Vikram! Mr. Vikram!

1341
01:52:23,113 --> 01:52:24,307
The car is stuck up ahead.

1342
01:52:25,115 --> 01:52:26,639
There is no trace of Anamika.

1343
01:52:27,050 --> 01:52:28,176
I can't see her anywhere.

1344
01:52:30,053 --> 01:52:32,044
'Anamika lost to my love and died.'

1345
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:36,052
'I thought now Vikram will
understand my love.'

1346
01:52:37,394 --> 01:52:41,057
If that's so, then why didn't
you ever tell Vikram...

1347
01:52:41,131 --> 01:52:45,192
...that you loved him.
- Why, couldn't he see it?

1348
01:52:47,604 --> 01:52:49,128
He should have felt it.

1349
01:52:50,673 --> 01:52:51,731
But now he will.

1350
01:52:53,076 --> 01:52:54,543
Because tonight you will die too.

1351
01:52:56,079 --> 01:52:59,071
People will think that,
Jia also believed...

1352
01:52:59,149 --> 01:53:01,083
...that Vikram has murdered Anamika.

1353
01:53:02,218 --> 01:53:03,412
And she committed suicide.

1354
01:53:05,688 --> 01:53:06,746
So goodbye Jia.

1355
01:53:09,159 --> 01:53:12,492
From today, I will
be Mrs. Shishodiya.

1356
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,771
Malini, please don't do it!

1357
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:28,168
Malini!

1358
01:53:39,122 --> 01:53:41,113
Malini, stop this madness Malini!

1359
01:53:53,736 --> 01:53:54,794
Help!

1360
01:54:14,424 --> 01:54:15,482
Malini!

1361
01:54:34,177 --> 01:54:35,235
Malini!

1362
01:54:59,869 --> 01:55:00,927
What's that?

1363
01:55:03,206 --> 01:55:05,606
O my God, Gajner!

1364
01:55:36,306 --> 01:55:37,364
Shekar Rajput here.

1365
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:41,233
Send the fire brigade at the
Gajner palace. Immediately!

1366
01:56:14,744 --> 01:56:15,802
Jia!

1367
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,738
Jia!

1368
01:56:30,293 --> 01:56:33,023
Jia! Are you okay? You okay?

1369
01:56:41,304 --> 01:56:42,362
Okay Jia!

1370
01:56:42,438 --> 01:56:44,702
Mr. Vikram, she did what
I was afraid off.

1371
01:56:45,041 --> 01:56:47,509
Jia tried to set the west wing
on fire and commit suicide.

1372
01:56:51,447 --> 01:56:53,039
Malini, I know you have
started this fire.

1373
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:55,779
I even know that you
have killed Anamika.

1374
01:56:56,919 --> 01:56:57,977
I know everything, Malini.

1375
01:56:58,721 --> 01:57:02,452
What you don't know is that
how much I love you.

1376
01:57:04,594 --> 01:57:06,391
You could never see my love, Vikram.

1377
01:57:11,334 --> 01:57:12,995
Malini! Get out of there.

1378
01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:14,928
Malini, get out from there.

1379
01:57:15,338 --> 01:57:17,329
If you can save me, then save me.

1380
01:57:17,407 --> 01:57:18,738
Malini just stop this stupidity
and get out of there.

1381
01:57:19,342 --> 01:57:20,400
Get out of there. Malini!

1382
01:57:21,344 --> 01:57:22,402
Malini!

1383
01:57:22,879 --> 01:57:23,937
Malini!

1384
01:57:26,816 --> 01:57:27,874
Malini!

1385
01:57:39,362 --> 01:57:40,420
Vikram, take care of Jia.

1386
01:57:40,496 --> 01:57:41,554
I will take care of this.

1387
01:57:41,964 --> 01:57:43,556
From there, quickly!

1388
01:57:43,633 --> 01:57:44,691
Come on!

1389
01:58:25,007 --> 01:58:28,602
Love! Love! Love! Love!
Love! Love! Love!

1390
01:58:28,678 --> 01:58:32,671
Everyone needs it.

1391
01:58:33,149 --> 01:58:36,607
Love! Love! Love! Love!
Love! Love! Love!

1392
01:58:36,686 --> 01:58:40,747
Everyone needs it.

1393
01:58:41,157 --> 01:58:43,887
Immersed in my eyes.

1394
01:58:49,165 --> 01:58:53,101
Your beautiful face has
immersed in my eyes.

1395
01:58:53,436 --> 01:58:57,429
My beloved, I find
you very attractive.

1396
01:58:57,507 --> 01:59:01,170
My beloved, I find
you very attractive.

1397
01:59:01,444 --> 01:59:05,175
How do I express to
you my sweetheart?

1398
01:59:05,448 --> 01:59:09,179
I have lost my heart to you.

1399
01:59:09,452 --> 01:59:13,047
I have lost my heart to you.

1400
01:59:13,456 --> 01:59:16,118
You are my insanity.

1401
01:59:17,193 --> 01:59:20,788
I fallen in love with you, I have!

1402
01:59:21,197 --> 01:59:24,997
Love cannot be controlled
by anyone.

1403
01:59:25,468 --> 01:59:28,995
No one can bind the hearts.

1404
01:59:29,205 --> 01:59:33,005
No matter what one
tries to oppose.

1405
01:59:33,209 --> 01:59:36,872
No matter what one
tries to oppose.

1406
01:59:37,213 --> 01:59:40,478
I have lost my heart to you.

1407
01:59:41,484 --> 01:59:45,079
Love cannot be controlled
by anyone.

1408
01:59:45,221 --> 01:59:48,952
No one can bind the hearts.

1409
01:59:49,158 --> 01:59:52,889
Love cannot be controlled
by anyone.

1410
01:59:53,229 --> 01:59:56,960
No one can bind the hearts.
