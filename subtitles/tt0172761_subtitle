1
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:30,619
- Why have you sealed my house?
- Not just your house...

2
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:36,659
...but even your fate is sealed
by your father, through this will.

3
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:40,489
Will? What does it say?

4
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:49,769
I gave a lot of chances to
my son to improve himself.

5
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:55,985
But his ego is sky high, and,
he is nothing but a vagabond

6
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,736
Our lineage has never had an heir
who has put his own house in peril.

7
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:05,748
But Virendra Pratap Singh is
of that kind, who will.

8
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:13,751
If, by 21 years of age, he,
like his forefathers before him...

9
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:19,415
...doesn't join a military academy,
all his luxuries are to be stopped.

10
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:27,299
He can claim the estate fully,
only when he joins the Academy.

11
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:32,488
I've been hit by a bolt from
the blue, why are you howling?

12
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,856
When the lightning hits a house,
the house remains standing.

13
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,028
It's the huts around that house
that get burnt to ashes.

14
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:44,503
Now how will I keep the
hearth burning in my house?

15
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:53,958
Your hearth will burn, and
this seal too will be broken.

16
00:06:54,281 --> 00:07:00,290
- How, sir? - My father made one
mistake when writing this will.

17
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:06,688
He willed I was to join, but
he didn't will I was to pass!

18
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:13,147
There's not a single college here,
which hasn't kicked me out!

19
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:19,191
That's why I'll join the Academy,
and break so many rules...

20
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:25,310
...that they'll kick me out within
2 days! That's it. My way is clear.

21
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:32,259
I'm not your beloved!

22
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:36,295
Now arrange for me to join
the Academy, pronto!

23
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,808
Friends, I'm Amrik Singh Gill.

24
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,195
I've always dreamt of becoming
a top-brass in the Army.

25
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:02,849
- And today that day is here.
- Mr. Gill...

26
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:09,528
Even I had a dream. Not of just
becoming a top officer in the Army...

27
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,880
But of breaking into the enemy
territory and giving it to them!

28
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,554
They had annihilated my
entire family in the 1971 war!

29
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:35,099
Hey! Will you too say something
or are your lips sealed today?

30
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,278
What will I say?
We Bengalis don't dream...

31
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:45,393
We just think of 2 meals of rice
and fish. When I didn't get a job...

32
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:49,009
...I joined the Army. But
shall I tell you the truth?

33
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,648
I'm very scared of dying!

34
00:08:57,564 --> 00:09:01,522
- Who asked you to laugh?
- Why? Do we need your permission?

35
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:06,695
You need permission even to piss,
let alone laugh, in the Army.

36
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:11,698
And don't laugh like civilians!

37
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,575
Laugh like this... Understand?

38
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,420
Got scared, eh?

39
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,726
My dear boys, laugh
as much as you want...

40
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:31,866
...sing and smile too.
But, for the last time.

41
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:34,820
Because this gate of the Academy
is the threshold of...

42
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:41,003
...Major Jasbir Singh Rana's pride!
Cross that and no more laughing.

43
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:46,284
At his footfalls, the flowers
droop instead of blooming.

44
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:50,283
The atmosphere is as silent
as a burial ground.

45
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,364
And on seeing him, the wind...

46
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,433
...stops blowing!

47
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,441
Today you all have left behind
the crowds of ordinary mortals...

48
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,914
...and are standing with
those courageous soldiers...

49
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,045
...who not only protect the
borders of our country...

50
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:17,627
...but who also write
the fate of this nation!

51
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,922
No nation is protected
by guns, and cannons.

52
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:29,130
Nor any war is won with Atom bombs
and machine guns.

53
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:34,663
It is won by man.
With strong determination.

54
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:40,633
Which will kindle
within your hearts.

55
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:46,404
After 3 years of training
when you'll all leave...

56
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,286
...I'm leaving in 3 days!

57
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:01,659
Did you say something?

58
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,314
I said, I'll leave this
place within 3 days.

59
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:10,391
Until you're training is over...

60
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,000
Till you become a man, from
the animal that you are...

61
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,832
You won't be able to set
a foot outside this Academy!

62
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:24,816
Raise the walls then, Major...
for, I shall just jump over them.

63
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:27,833
Don't ever make that mistake.

64
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:33,332
Else, these legs that you are
standing on, won't remain so!

65
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:38,502
Let this be clear
to every Cadet here.

66
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:44,589
From today, every breath you take
will be as per my rules and law.

67
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:49,734
Then you better hear me too. From
today I'll break every rule here.

68
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,057
And this will continue...

69
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:56,548
...till you throw me out of here!

70
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:04,398
The sun may rise in the west.
Flowers may bloom in deserts, but...

71
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:07,249
...that will never be,
what you want!

72
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:01,055
This is me? No, this is not me.

73
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:07,942
- What's the matter?
- See what they've done to me.

74
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:13,432
I had grown this little by
little so very lovingly.

75
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,527
They made a mess of it
in just one go!

76
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:22,947
- I look a proper fool!
- Had you been born a Sikh...

77
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:26,423
...nobody would've dared to
misbehave with you like this.

78
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:32,340
- No thanks. I'd rather look
a fool like this! - Why you...

79
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:41,578
Take your bed-kit, pray,
and go to sleep.

80
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:45,193
- Tomorrow morn your grilling starts!
- As the good Lord wishes. - Right.

81
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:55,169
- Blabber away...
- Oh, it's you.

82
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,402
Even the Major couldn't talk in
your presence. How will I blabber?

83
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,345
You're very wise.

84
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:07,582
Don't you have anyone
to cry over you?

85
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,918
- No!
- No wonder. That's why...

86
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:15,952
...you're locking horns with him!
But the Major will have your skin!

87
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:21,761
My goodness!
This Major's a real fiend.

88
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:27,422
Will we survive next 6 months, or
will it be the Last Post for us?

89
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:31,556
Don't you worry.
If the Major is heavy...

90
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,129
...our Viru here is heavier!

91
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,897
When you run away from here,
take me with you.

92
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:47,554
My father has left me a fortune.
Has your father left some too?

93
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:52,209
- He's not dead, so how will he
leave anything? - After he dies?

94
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:57,561
- There's nothing to leave anyway!
- Then will you dance and earn?

95
00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:02,917
I'll open a sweet-meat shop! But if
I stay here, he'll bleed me white.

96
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:06,601
Lights out and go to sleep!

97
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:11,566
You've to get up at
4 a.m. So sleep now.

98
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,864
Cadets! At ease!

99
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:28,897
After a 10 minutes break.
We'll return the same way.

100
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,720
- Sir! - Count the cadets.
- Sir.

101
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,031
Cadets! Start counting
from the beginning.

102
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:40,192
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

103
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,190
There's one cadet missing, sir.

104
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,898
Very fond of running, aren't you?

105
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:32,711
I'll make you run so much, that
you'll run out of the terrain...

106
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,247
...but you'll not stop running!

107
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,190
On the double! Else, you'll
get more punishment.

108
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:14,912
- Hanuman Prasad...
- Sir!

109
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:25,332
- Take him to the hospital.
- Sir!

110
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:32,424
- What happened? - What else?
A mouse struck at a tiger.

111
00:19:32,782 --> 00:19:36,527
The tiger hit it with a paw. Poor
soldier, hit the straw! - Honestly!

112
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:42,197
- O mother! The fiend bashed me.
- Is it hurting very much?

113
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:47,233
Don't ask! He tossed
a salad out of my bones!

114
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:53,078
- Why did you invite punishment?
- Is life fun without punishment?

115
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,337
It's after punishment that a
man's determination gets stronger.

116
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,090
Hey! you're mother.

117
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:12,776
Tell me, if a nurse is a sister.
Why can't a doctor be a mother?

118
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:17,328
If you consider me a mother,
I'll make you my son.

119
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:22,685
- Don't ever do that. - Why not?
- Because I aim to run away soon.

120
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,191
You'll leave your mother?

121
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:32,346
- Were you and the major in the same
school? - Why? - He inflicts wounds...

122
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:36,587
...and you put balm of love.
If I had met you both earlier...

123
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:40,415
...I'd have got you both married!
No, no...

124
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:45,418
He'd have made your life hell! He'd
have loved you in army style too.

125
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,941
He'd have said...

126
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:55,008
You talk so sweetly. Now sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

127
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:58,968
Tomorrow morning? But I'll
run away tonight itself.

128
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:03,351
- You won't be able to. - Shall
we bet on it? - Sure. - How much?

129
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:05,440
- Whatever you say.
- 1,000/-.

130
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:11,973
Tell the major to intensify the
watch. Else, you'll lose the bet.

131
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:16,488
Don't worry about me. Because,
I know, the major may die...

132
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:20,385
- ...but he won't let me lose!
- What's so special between you both?

133
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:23,721
If I'm your mother, then,
the major is your father!

134
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:29,418
I'm married to your Major
for the past 18 years now!

135
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,504
Cadet Viren Pratap
is not in his bed!

136
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,154
I think he hid in the ration truck
and ran away.

137
00:21:57,857 --> 00:21:59,030
Find him!

138
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,905
He's not in the truck, sir.

139
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,485
Let's see how far he runs! Get in.

140
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,685
- Have you seen this cadet?
- No.

141
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:51,718
- This year too, you'll win
the 1st prize. - No, not at all.

142
00:23:53,111 --> 00:23:55,398
This time my friend
will come first. Nisha!

143
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:44,822
Hurry up, Nisha. Your name
has been announced.

144
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,611
How do I look?

145
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:58,661
- Shall we go?
- Yes. I'll certainly win this time.

146
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:58,217
- Yes?
- Have you seen him anywhere?

147
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:06,004
- Who's this ass?
- He's no ass, He's a bronco!

148
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:10,385
Send him to my stables. I'll
break him and send him to you.

149
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:15,246
He's no civilian for you to collar,
and tie him at your door!

150
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:20,531
He's a soldier. My soldier.
Only I have the right to punish him.

151
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:30,476
Suppose you find this bronco,
what will you do with him?

152
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:35,128
- He'll rue the day he was born!
- Leave that to me, okay?

153
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:46,503
- What the hell... I'm inside.
- Then stay there.

154
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:51,603
- But I may suffocate.
- If you don't, I'll throttle you!

155
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,908
- But what wrong have I done?
- I'll show you!

156
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,040
What are you doing, Madam?

157
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,810
So! Having fun?

158
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,167
You must now be knowing the
crime and the punishment too.

159
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:32,058
If you cross my path
again, I'll kill you!

160
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,967
Madam, whenever anyone
challenges me...

161
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,415
...my blood runs faster in my veins.

162
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:46,658
And I do, what even the
Almighty doesn't dare to!

163
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:56,598
Don't look away. You'll see
this face every day from now.

164
00:29:57,573 --> 00:30:00,487
You'll die terribly.
You don't know my brother!

165
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:04,034
- Who the hell is this in-law?
- You swore at my brother?

166
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:09,212
A brother-in-law is just that!
Go home and tell your brother.

167
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:13,139
...he needn't look for a boy
for you. I'll come as the groom.

168
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:42,269
Why haven't you eaten yet?

169
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,745
- Didn't feel like it.
- Really? Or...

170
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:49,985
...did some cadet make a dent
in your ego, yet again?

171
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:59,776
What you term as ego is actually
my ideals and principles.

172
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:07,218
What kind of ideals and principles
are those that treat men like beasts?

173
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:11,107
If it's a father's duty
to love his son.

174
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:15,905
Then it's also his right to
punish, if the son errs.

175
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:19,943
- But Viren Pratap is not your son.
- He is!

176
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,762
Not just him, but every cadet
here is my son!

177
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:29,849
And I'll make them able officers.
Viren Pratap too will be what I want.

178
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:32,104
Because, in him, I see my s...

179
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,254
Why did you stop? Go on.

180
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:47,397
Why don't you admit that you're
seeking your dead son in him!

181
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:54,173
If you loved your son,
so very very much...

182
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:57,820
...why did you let him die?

183
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:27,372
- How's my wife?
- A complication has set in.

184
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,843
We have but one choice.
Save the mother, or the child!

185
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,450
No... Save my wife.

186
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:46,831
Think it over. We'll save her.
But, she'll never be a mother again!

187
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:15,197
We were successful
in saving your wife.

188
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:29,233
It was a son, wasn't it?

189
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:25,197
I'll never be a mother now.

190
00:34:28,537 --> 00:34:33,811
- I know. - If you knew, why
didn't you save your child?

191
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,579
You should've let me die.

192
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,482
At least your son
would've been saved.

193
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:52,588
Had he lived, at least your
dream would've come true.

194
00:35:16,642 --> 00:35:19,272
You can at least voice
your pain through tears.

195
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:26,300
But me,... whom shall
I tell my pain to?

196
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:33,805
Whom shall I tell?

197
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:48,405
Your dream and your hope,
both have returned. Look!

198
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:53,127
Sir! I know I've to do
20 rounds today.

199
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:58,548
You might as well throw your
uniform and medals now.

200
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:00,775
You're not worthy to wear them.

201
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:06,680
A boy ran away by making a fool
of you, and has come back too!

202
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:12,593
You're getting old now. There's
not much oil left in you!

203
00:36:17,814 --> 00:36:20,384
Don't go by
this grey beard, love.

204
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:26,570
There's still a lot of oil left in
me to put even the sea to shame!

205
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:33,798
Hospital again?

206
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:40,054
I don't get one thing though.
Since you did manage to run away...

207
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:44,364
- ...why did you come back?
- Had to take my winnings.

208
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:49,996
You don't seem stupid enough to
return to the jaws of death for that.

209
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:55,347
Who's come back to the Major?
I've come back to my mother.

210
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,078
Hurry up and get me well.
Cos, I've to go out again tonight.

211
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:03,515
- Where?
- To your daughter-in-law!

212
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:09,803
Yes! When I was running away
from death last night...

213
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:15,572
...I met my life. I felt I
didn't come here to be a cadet...

214
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:20,365
...but to meet her.
She's just like you.

215
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,539
- But her temper's like the Major's!
- Where does she live?

216
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,548
Don't know where she stayed before.
But now, she lives right here.

217
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:34,970
- Stethoscope! Put it on.
- But why? - Listen.

218
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:40,599
- Can you hear her heartbeats?
- I can hear the Major's voice.

219
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,390
He's saying, today; let alone you,
even your shadow will not escape.

220
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:51,307
When somebody challenges me, my
blood flows very fast in my veins.

221
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:55,817
- And I do what God...
- You just can't escape tonight.

222
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:59,579
- Why not? - Because I've added
sedatives to your glucose.

223
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:02,984
Yes. You better sleep now.

224
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:21,547
Stop the car! Stop, I say!

225
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:55,673
- What's the matter, dear boy?
- Where's Nisha? - In her room.

226
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,472
- How is she? - Fine.
- You're lying to me.

227
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:04,643
You know I love her very much,
that's why you're lying to me.

228
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:09,677
- Why should I lie?
- Swear on my head that she's well.

229
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,532
- That's she's absolutely fine.
- My dear boy... - Brother?

230
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,934
She's fine.

231
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:27,238
This small .... you were,
when mother left you in my care.

232
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:33,138
And she said from today, son,
Nisha's your daughter, not sister.

233
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:39,951
- She dare not get a scratch on her!
- You're not hurt are you?

234
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:43,917
Nothing's the matter with me.
I'm hale and hearty before you.

235
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,015
- But your car's had an accident.
- It wasn't an accident.

236
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:53,299
- I deliberately crashed it!
- Deliberately? But why?

237
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:57,126
- I had met some idiot.
- What's his name?

238
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,823
It's God's miracle
that she came to my house

239
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:57,400
Sometimes I see her...
Sometimes I see my home

240
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:12,840
- You! How did you get here?
- I had promised you, remember?

241
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:19,093
- Will you go, or... - You are
beautiful, so you'll do a fuss.

242
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:24,102
Keep saying no, and I'll wait
for you to say yes.

243
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:30,982
- You don't know whose house
you've broken into. - I know.

244
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:34,528
This is my brother-in-law's house.
He's made a lot of money!

245
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,659
You won't heed me like this.
I'll get the guards.

246
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:47,664
Guards!
Come here! Pronto.

247
00:46:53,997 --> 00:46:58,511
- What's wrong? - She's in love.
- Throw him out. Now!

248
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,167
Madam, I can floor them all
in one swipe.

249
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:15,299
But I won't do that.
I want to put your hate to test.

250
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:21,375
And you see my love.
Which is only yours!

251
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:47,097
Why are you all standing around?
Wipe that smile off his face forever.

252
00:49:57,892 --> 00:50:00,878
- Goodness!
- Why are you hopping like a frog?

253
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:06,643
If the Major comes before Viru,
he'll have our hides!

254
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,980
You open your umbrella
even before it rains!

255
00:50:10,822 --> 00:50:14,329
He'll shave and shower first.
Then only he'll come in here.

256
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:18,320
Viru, my friend...
Please come now

257
00:50:19,198 --> 00:50:22,493
And save our skins!

258
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:41,121
My darling's come home everybody

259
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,606
Now what?

260
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:57,392
That Major's pager has to be moved.
Else how will Viru come out?

261
00:50:58,369 --> 00:50:59,683
I'll move him, man!

262
00:52:17,372 --> 00:52:20,323
Viru, did you met the girl?
- Yes.

263
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:24,668
- Kiss her? - How did you know?
- It was shown on the T.V.!

264
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:29,082
What's this wound on your face?

265
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,635
The wound is here, but
the pain must be there.

266
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:39,088
She must be remembering me,
constantly...

267
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:59,077
I will test your hatred,
and you test my love.

268
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:01,264
Which is solely yours.

269
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:52,425
Raja Thakur is waiting for you.

270
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:12,584
- Yes, sir?
- Do you know Subhash Malhotra?

271
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:17,660
- I've seen him once or twice
at your place. - That's the one.

272
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:23,354
Poor guy wants to move his mill
from Parel to Virar.

273
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:28,393
But some union leaders are
putting a spoke in his wheel.

274
00:54:29,414 --> 00:54:32,471
- Why?
- By selling the mill's plot...

275
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,869
...Malhotra made a cool 500 million!

276
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:41,989
And the labour leaders
resent that. I want you...

277
00:54:42,308 --> 00:54:46,859
... to shut those leader's mouths!
- If you can do that...

278
00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:47,326
At no cost is this deal
to go through, Bihari.

279
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:53,753
That plot will bring a gain
of 500 million!

280
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:59,459
And Raja Thakur will claim
at least 50 million from it.

281
00:55:00,785 --> 00:55:09,046
And you know how much ammunition
that 50 million can buy, don't you?

282
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:15,729
I know. In one night, he can
send us to kingdom come!

283
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:19,307
Then you better think
what to do about it.

284
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:22,430
Else, you'll have to leave
Mumbai and go back to Bihar!

285
00:55:25,915 --> 00:55:29,031
- If you say so, shall I get rid
of the Thakur? - Listen, son...

286
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:34,913
...the power lies not in Thakur's
arms, but in Shankar's head!

287
00:55:35,473 --> 00:55:39,988
- Which even death dare not defy.
- Then I swear by the holy Ganges...

288
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:44,850
...till I don't spurt blood
from this Shankar's head...

289
00:55:45,413 --> 00:55:48,955
- ...I'll not even drink water!
- Well said, Bihari!

290
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:52,638
- That's what I expected from you.
- Listen,...

291
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:56,600
...don't waste time in
praising me. Just tell me...

292
00:55:56,918 --> 00:56:02,227
- ...when and where is Malhotra
meeting Shankar? - Tonight, 10 p.m.

293
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,175
...at Hotel Park View.

294
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:05,281
- Let go of me! - Don't move,
else I'll break your neck.

295
00:57:32,186 --> 00:57:33,573
Arrest him!

296
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:40,298
Major, you're an
eye witness to this.

297
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:43,252
We'll need your statement
in the court...

298
00:57:49,868 --> 00:57:51,598
You too, Mr. Shankar.

299
00:58:02,206 --> 00:58:06,366
Is he the same man who shot at you?

300
00:58:13,884 --> 00:58:17,356
Whether this man shot at me...

301
00:58:17,499 --> 00:58:19,573
...or somebody else, I don't know.

302
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:26,003
- You're lying and misleading
the court. - Your Honour...

303
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:28,614
Is telling the truth,
misleading the court?

304
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,998
Just wear this hat. Go on...

305
00:58:43,741 --> 00:58:47,734
Your Honour, please take note
of the bullet holes on this hat.

306
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:55,029
From about a 10-feet distance,
the killer shoots at him.

307
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,222
The bullet hits his hat,
and ricochets elsewhere,

308
00:59:02,544 --> 00:59:04,558
And he claims he couldn't see
the guy who shot at him! Great!

309
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:11,709
I warn you, that to change
one's statement in the court...

310
00:59:11,768 --> 00:59:15,063
...or to lie, is the
world's greatest crime.

311
00:59:15,591 --> 00:59:20,971
I know, sir, but I want to know
which law in the world states...

312
00:59:21,569 --> 00:59:24,626
...that a hat has to be worn
in the way I'm wearing it now.

313
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,141
Actually, when I left home,
I hadn't worn my hat like this.

314
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,965
But like this! And
the bullet was fired...

315
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:39,222
...from behind me!

316
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:48,148
Now sir, how can I swear, whether
the bullet was fired by him...

317
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:51,524
...or by him?

318
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:03,892
Bihari, leave at once!
Else Shankar will kill you!

319
01:00:04,632 --> 01:00:08,934
He dare touch me!
He's scared of me as it is!

320
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:14,676
He swore in court that he
didn't see me at all.

321
01:00:17,736 --> 01:00:21,102
Honestly, uncle, within
24 hours from now...

322
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:26,243
...if I don't put his corpse at
your feet, I'll change my name!

323
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,647
Then phone me after 24 hours!
Understand?

324
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:48,482
You marred the reputation of
the whole of Bihar, old chap.

325
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:52,065
You missed your target from
a distance of just 10 feet?

326
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:59,402
- Forgive me. - If I forgive you,
will the Bihari people spare me?

327
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:04,266
Mercy. I'll take a train and
leave Mumbai right this minute.

328
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:11,359
No life never goes back from Mumbai.
Only death does that!

329
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:35,706
- Is your uncle home, or in office?
- He leaves at 5 a.m. for office.

330
01:01:36,132 --> 01:01:40,778
- What work do you have with him?
- Not with him, but at N.D.A.

331
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,674
After all, you're my passport
to step into the N.D.A.!

332
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:49,886
- Have you lost your heart to
some army chap? - Yes, I have...

333
01:01:51,529 --> 01:01:54,480
But now even if I give my life
for him, it won't be enough.

334
01:01:55,005 --> 01:01:59,343
Okay, okay. Do one thing. Come
here fast, I'll take you there.

335
01:02:00,632 --> 01:02:05,076
When you go out and turn right,
you'll see the Cadet's building.

336
01:02:05,776 --> 01:02:09,592
- You'll find Cadet Singh there.
- This way? - Yes. - Hurry up.

337
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,781
Whom are you seeking?
Then go to the M. Hospital!

338
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:21,339
- Why? - After such a beating,
will he go to the church?

339
01:02:41,576 --> 01:02:43,650
How did this happen?

340
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,704
I didn't know that you would die.

341
01:02:53,046 --> 01:02:54,598
I had come to tell you...

342
01:02:57,217 --> 01:02:59,291
...that the smile which I hated
so much on your lips...

343
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:08,155
That very smile has pulled me
here today. I love you.

344
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,807
I don't want to live
without you either!

345
01:03:22,242 --> 01:03:23,272
Really?

346
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:29,191
The girl's trapped!

347
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:47,586
What's the problem? You
had once sworn, that...

348
01:08:47,772 --> 01:08:53,152
...you'd kill me in a shoot out.
Then, like some woman...

349
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:57,220
- ...why the rendezvous in privacy?
- Look Shankar...

350
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:03,653
...I've nothing against you. My
enmity is with Raja Thakur.

351
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:09,838
That invalid made you his slave
and a target for my gun.

352
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,697
But it could also be that
I become a target of your gun.

353
01:09:16,169 --> 01:09:21,655
But then it's also possible
that my bullet finds you!

354
01:09:22,842 --> 01:09:26,172
In both the cases, Raja Thakur
will not lose anything.

355
01:09:27,639 --> 01:09:31,383
That's why, throw away that
harness of slavery...

356
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:34,517
...and wear the crown
of the king of India!

357
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:40,213
You rule over 1 /2 of India
and I rule over the rest!

358
01:09:43,209 --> 01:09:45,117
Your advice is not bad...

359
01:09:47,172 --> 01:09:51,686
...but I may trust a cobra.
Not you.

360
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:57,033
Even if we become blood relations?

361
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:05,102
Think Shankar... I have a son.

362
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:08,301
You have a sister. If...

363
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:12,473
...those two get married...

364
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:21,439
An in-law will not shoot down
his own in-law, will he?

365
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:27,070
Raja Thakur will never
agree to this alliance.

366
01:10:29,297 --> 01:10:30,825
Raja Thakur?

367
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:10,722
See? One signal from you, and
my men will get rid of this hurdle!

368
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:16,172
And you'll take a leap, from
a slave, to the king!

369
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,906
No, Shankar!

370
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,970
No!

371
01:12:21,791 --> 01:12:24,493
- Ramu?
- Yes, my dear?

372
01:12:25,196 --> 01:12:28,668
It's not a festival, then why is
this house decorated like a bride?

373
01:12:28,846 --> 01:12:32,211
This is like having the sight but,
being blind to the obvious.

374
01:12:32,843 --> 01:12:38,045
I've told you so many times,
I don't get your northern proverbs!

375
01:12:38,404 --> 01:12:41,592
- Tell me plainly, will you?
- My dear girl...

376
01:12:42,227 --> 01:12:45,522
- ...your marriage has
been finalised. - What!

377
01:12:46,398 --> 01:12:50,913
You're betrothed to that
Parsurambabu's son Vicky.

378
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:55,010
- Who finalised this?
- Who else, my dear?

379
01:12:55,157 --> 01:12:57,859
The one who brought you up ofcourse.

380
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:03,915
Just because he did that,
does my life become his too?

381
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,453
- He could've asked me at least.
- Asked you what?

382
01:13:09,338 --> 01:13:16,104
That I'm just 10 years old, and
mother left you in my care and died?

383
01:13:17,263 --> 01:13:20,628
Tell me, how will I rear you?...
How will I feed you?

384
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:25,670
Do I ask you that? No.

385
01:13:27,758 --> 01:13:29,595
I don't ask anybody anything.

386
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:33,664
I take my own decisions.

387
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:41,450
And I've take the decision
concerning your life!

388
01:13:42,009 --> 01:13:44,960
- But... - Kids with manners,
do not argue with their elders!

389
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:52,432
Go and get ready to rejoice
in my happiness.

390
01:13:54,174 --> 01:13:59,376
Sis, I'm your brother,
not your foe!

391
01:14:00,082 --> 01:14:03,554
You are my foe! If you
weren't my enemy...

392
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:06,675
...you'd have got me married
to the one I love.

393
01:14:10,649 --> 01:14:13,671
Please give me my love in marriage.

394
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:18,497
I don't love Vicky, I love
that officer... - No!

395
01:14:21,806 --> 01:14:26,073
Don't take his name.
Else, I'll present you...

396
01:14:26,498 --> 01:14:30,100
...not with that boy,
but his severed head!

397
01:14:33,032 --> 01:14:37,192
And you know very well, that,
whatever your brother says...

398
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:42,613
...he does it! Now go!

399
01:15:00,522 --> 01:15:02,394
Can you identify
this revolver, Major?

400
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:08,574
This is an army revolver.
How did you get hold of it?

401
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:12,402
That's what I want to know.
Who's that man...

402
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:17,302
...who's stealing military arms,
and selling them to gangsters?

403
01:15:18,839 --> 01:15:24,361
- What do you mean? - This gun
was retrieved from a gangster...

404
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,551
...who was killed in the
last gang war. This means...

405
01:15:28,049 --> 01:15:32,043
...one of your men was hand
in glove with the gangster.

406
01:15:32,568 --> 01:15:38,470
- It's impossible! - It's not wrong
to be proud of one's department.

407
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:42,461
But, at times, there are jackals
in a tiger's clothing!

408
01:15:43,095 --> 01:15:46,496
My every soldier is of the type
who'll die for his country.

409
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,355
But who's this one, who'll do
anything for money?

410
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,958
Sir, I found a revolver.

411
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:24,066
In Virendra Pratap Singh's trunk!

412
01:16:50,484 --> 01:16:56,173
You dare swallow a morsel!
Cos if you do, I'll pull it out!

413
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:03,271
This bread is given to us,
by the people of India.

414
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:08,070
Who knead it with their sweat,
so that we can protect them...

415
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:11,197
...and spill our blood for it.
But you!

416
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:17,934
For a few silver coins, you sold
their trust in black market!

417
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:24,120
- What are you saying, sir?
- Not me, but this stolen gun...

418
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:28,713
...is screaming, I'm the proof
of the traitor's treason!

419
01:17:30,038 --> 01:17:31,140
And you'll be punished for it.

420
01:17:53,047 --> 01:17:58,083
Isn't this what you wanted?
To be thrown out of the Academy?

421
01:17:59,477 --> 01:18:03,257
Well, you're thrown out!
But this is not your victory.

422
01:18:04,865 --> 01:18:07,459
It's my defeat!

423
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:13,546
For, henceforth, I'll never say...

424
01:18:17,724 --> 01:18:18,754
Never!

425
01:18:56,128 --> 01:18:57,443
Sit down.

426
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:11,713
We joined the army together.

427
01:19:13,802 --> 01:19:15,532
Inspite of being more
capable than me...

428
01:19:17,555 --> 01:19:20,328
...you lagged behind in
this race of life.

429
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:26,378
Know why? Because of your
ego and stubbornness!

430
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:36,383
All the army rules fall short,
compared to the height of your ego!

431
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:40,000
You've over-stepped the law's
line of limit, many a times...

432
01:19:40,913 --> 01:19:45,013
...which deserved just one penalty
that you be stripped of your uniform.

433
01:19:45,257 --> 01:19:48,895
Be fired from this job and be
thrown out. But each time...

434
01:19:49,636 --> 01:19:53,939
Every time I stood by you, Cos,
you're one such officer...

435
01:19:54,884 --> 01:19:58,914
...who knows how to make a gem
out of a piece of glass!

436
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:04,543
Those officers whom you've trained
are living examples to the nation.

437
01:20:05,938 --> 01:20:11,353
And only an officer like you, can,
in the hearts of young officers,

438
01:20:11,846 --> 01:20:14,097
...kindle a patriotic feeling
for their country.

439
01:20:16,017 --> 01:20:19,559
That doesn't mean you can whip
the backsides of those soldiers.

440
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:21,744
Like you did with that cadet.

441
01:20:27,486 --> 01:20:29,560
I'm putting a Nelson's eye to
all this, Major, just this once.

442
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:32,340
But remember...

443
01:20:52,511 --> 01:20:56,114
- Hurry! Somebody may come.
- Don't fret! Nobody will come.

444
01:20:56,682 --> 01:21:02,241
- They're all sleeping like logs!
- You don't know Major. Very sharp.

445
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:06,228
- We'll never know when he'll
come as Death to us! - Those days...

446
01:21:06,415 --> 01:21:11,273
...are gone when he ruled
the roost! From now on...

447
01:21:11,454 --> 01:21:15,234
- I'll command this Academy.
- Why?

448
01:21:15,591 --> 01:21:19,620
- Has the Major left the army?
- No, but his senses have left him.

449
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:23,442
I made a scapegoat of
Cadet Virendra Singh.

450
01:21:24,315 --> 01:21:30,560
And the Major hung him! Now
sell all the arms you want!

451
01:21:31,022 --> 01:21:33,795
Nobody will suspect us. Let's go.

452
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,344
Easy now... Keep it carefully.

453
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:44,984
Let's move, who the hell is that?

454
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:50,725
I also wear an army uniform.

455
01:21:52,016 --> 01:21:56,116
- But, like you, I don't sell my
loyalty. - Let me see you!

456
01:22:08,213 --> 01:22:10,713
- You, sir?
- Yes, me.

457
01:22:13,218 --> 01:22:17,318
Who punished an innocent for
a crime you committed.

458
01:22:19,474 --> 01:22:22,875
These hands, which belted that
innocent like an animal...

459
01:22:24,688 --> 01:22:30,068
...which rained blows on his body
instead of yours, you bastard...!

460
01:22:31,986 --> 01:22:34,060
...will now teach you such a
lesson, that never again...

461
01:22:35,323 --> 01:22:38,866
...will an army man dare to
sell his uniform like this!

462
01:25:19,793 --> 01:25:24,995
I kept skinning you alive, and
you bore it without a whimper?

463
01:25:27,786 --> 01:25:30,738
You staked your life, to save me?

464
01:25:33,174 --> 01:25:36,753
Why?

465
01:25:41,272 --> 01:25:43,417
Your whip didn't scare me as much...

466
01:25:46,381 --> 01:25:50,719
...as that stigma, which the
Subedar put on my forehead.

467
01:25:52,638 --> 01:25:56,109
That I'm a traitor.
An army officer...

468
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,760
...who can sell his mother
for a few rupees.

469
01:26:01,015 --> 01:26:07,260
Who can barter his country. I can
live with the scars on my back.

470
01:26:09,773 --> 01:26:15,047
But with this stigma,
I wouldn't have even died!

471
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:21,160
Virendra Pratap...

472
01:26:24,093 --> 01:26:29,722
You're one of those young men,
who can touch the sky.

473
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:36,768
You can be that soldier, on whom
every mother will dote on...

474
01:26:36,953 --> 01:26:40,769
...and say... If only, this boy,
Virendra Pratap, was my son!

475
01:26:47,032 --> 01:26:50,883
That does it, sir! I'll
prove to be that officer...

476
01:26:51,829 --> 01:26:57,458
...which you've dreamt of! The
day I wear an officer's uniform...

477
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,968
People will not say,
That's Virendra Pratap.

478
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:08,223
They'll say... Look! Here comes
Major Jasbir Singh Rana.

479
01:27:31,452 --> 01:27:33,952
- What's this?
- Nisha's engagement invitation.

480
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:43,848
This is not an invitation, but
a message informing her death.

481
01:27:47,649 --> 01:27:51,465
Do something, Viru, else she'll
be as good as dead!

482
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:37,378
Take me away, Viru.
Else my brother will...

483
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:43,114
I fell in love with you,
and that's not a crime.

484
01:28:43,816 --> 01:28:47,975
- If we marry it'll be with
your brother's blessings. - No!

485
01:28:48,681 --> 01:28:52,983
- You don't know my brother.
- And he doesn't know me. Come...

486
01:28:53,618 --> 01:28:57,920
- But Viru...
- We're in love. Don't be afraid.

487
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:03,910
- Rashmi... - Yes?
- Go and tell Nisha to hurry.

488
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,031
Don't be scared, Nisha.
Hold my hand.

489
01:29:19,728 --> 01:29:21,635
Today our love is being tested!

490
01:29:50,487 --> 01:29:54,303
- Throw him out!
- Don't you dare!

491
01:29:56,744 --> 01:30:00,737
If anybody steps forward
it'll be over my dead body!

492
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:04,770
Then I'll cross over your
dead body today!

493
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:17,035
Today because of him, I've
lost my reputation in public!

494
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:20,993
So now, he'll witness
your engagement ceremony.

495
01:30:21,144 --> 01:30:23,715
See for yourself!
Get the bride ready.

496
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:51,648
Parshuram Bihari, keep your
hand in your pocket.

497
01:34:53,047 --> 01:34:56,827
May no evil eye of mine be
cast on it, and your hand...

498
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,127
...get severed from your body!

499
01:36:31,514 --> 01:36:32,971
He's one of your cadets, right?

500
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:39,642
He made the mistake of walking
into my house with these feet.

501
01:36:41,315 --> 01:36:45,344
I've broken his legs so badly
that he'll never walk again.

502
01:36:49,325 --> 01:36:54,527
These hands... With them
he touched my sister.

503
01:36:59,265 --> 01:37:03,495
I've smashed them too. He
won't even be able to beg.

504
01:37:05,692 --> 01:37:10,135
I've turned this soldier of yours
into a wriggling worm, Major.

505
01:37:10,835 --> 01:37:14,094
A worm which cannot walk,
but only slither!

506
01:37:17,161 --> 01:37:20,977
If he ever comes round,
then tell him...

507
01:37:22,757 --> 01:37:26,680
...that he better dare not
lift his eyes at my house.

508
01:37:37,668 --> 01:37:41,270
An Indian soldier does not
slither on the floor.

509
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:45,240
He advances, even if his head
is severed from his body.

510
01:37:47,052 --> 01:37:51,910
You called my cadet, a worm.
A worm that slithers on the floor.

511
01:37:53,308 --> 01:37:58,239
This worm will walk on his feet
and come to me, this very moment.

512
01:37:59,773 --> 01:38:02,131
Watch! You just see.

513
01:38:12,494 --> 01:38:14,852
By the last breath
left in your body...

514
01:38:16,387 --> 01:38:18,817
Get up! And stand on your feet.

515
01:38:20,141 --> 01:38:25,106
This war is not yours alone.
It's now of all those soldiers...

516
01:38:26,501 --> 01:38:29,594
...who have known victory,
not defeat!

517
01:40:32,565 --> 01:40:35,622
See that? My Cadet...

518
01:40:36,493 --> 01:40:41,802
...did not slither like a worm.
He walked where I stood.

519
01:40:42,922 --> 01:40:45,695
And he'll walk on these very feet
and gate crash into your house.

520
01:40:48,515 --> 01:40:53,160
He'll carry your sister till here,
and you'll just stand and watch.

521
01:40:55,049 --> 01:41:00,251
One more thing. Don't you wear
your cap the wrong way round?

522
01:41:01,618 --> 01:41:06,654
From today wear your cap straight.
Because the day I shoot...

523
01:41:08,014 --> 01:41:10,265
...you won't get the time
to turn it the wrong way.

524
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:15,619
We soldiers don't strike from
behind, but from the up-front.

525
01:41:25,009 --> 01:41:26,467
Hey, you Englishman!

526
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:42,554
A dog, whether local or imported,
always barks at the gate. So bark!

527
01:41:44,508 --> 01:41:45,859
I don't mind. But...

528
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:51,701
...don't make the mistake of
crossing that line. Okay?

529
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:58,539
There your territory ends
and mine begins.

530
01:41:59,767 --> 01:42:03,582
That young man made a mistake
and we showed him a trailer.

531
01:42:06,023 --> 01:42:11,403
But, the main show
is still pending!

532
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,754
Your territory is of just
4 feet, Parsuram Bihari.

533
01:42:22,706 --> 01:42:26,036
Which starts in this
city and ends here too!

534
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:30,142
But ours, the Army's territory...

535
01:42:30,839 --> 01:42:34,868
...starts in the lofty Himalayas,
and ends in the Indian Ocean!

536
01:42:36,608 --> 01:42:39,037
If you two try to bite
chunks off it...

537
01:42:40,432 --> 01:42:44,426
I'll mince you so badly, your
lineage will have hard time counting.

538
01:42:45,298 --> 01:42:51,128
This I promise you! Keep it in mind.

539
01:43:12,408 --> 01:43:15,525
God was very unjust in taking
my mother away when I was a kid.

540
01:43:16,927 --> 01:43:18,834
But now, I think He feels
sorry for me.

541
01:43:20,924 --> 01:43:24,219
That's why He sent you.
As my mother.

542
01:43:24,921 --> 01:43:28,464
If you feel happy in calling me
mother, please do so.

543
01:43:29,092 --> 01:43:31,343
But a mother never likes
to see her son...

544
01:43:32,046 --> 01:43:37,011
- ...drenched in blood.
- No, mother...

545
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:41,773
I haven't spilt any blood.
I had gone to beg for my love.

546
01:43:41,952 --> 01:43:45,009
When one begs, one gets just
a coin that too, a bad one.

547
01:43:48,591 --> 01:43:52,857
And you went to beg for your
love! If your blood...

548
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:55,921
...hasn't dried in your veins,
meet me in the P.T. Ground, fast.

549
01:43:56,202 --> 01:44:00,789
Are you mad? He doesn't
have strength...

550
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:06,417
...even to stand up.
And you... He'll die.

551
01:44:06,629 --> 01:44:11,073
Let him die! I want every Indian
to live like a tiger!

552
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,881
Else, it's better he's still-born!

553
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:47,456
That's not a photograph,
but your destiny.

554
01:44:49,032 --> 01:44:52,991
Your destination in life.
To reach up to there...

555
01:44:53,134 --> 01:44:54,592
...you've to walk on embers.

556
01:44:57,027 --> 01:44:59,800
If you die, doesn't matter.
But don't retreat!

557
01:45:01,893 --> 01:45:03,800
- Yes, sir.
- I couldn't hear.

558
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:27,119
I want to know why he's arrested.

559
01:52:30,257 --> 01:52:31,715
I haven't handcuffed him.

560
01:52:32,343 --> 01:52:35,945
He was leaving the scene of
the fight. So I brought him here.

561
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:41,202
My cadet is not a coward. As
long as blood runs in his veins...

562
01:52:42,283 --> 01:52:44,854
...he'll stand on the battlefield
with his chest puffed out!

563
01:52:45,272 --> 01:52:50,415
If he's itching to fight then
take him to the border! This is...

564
01:52:51,042 --> 01:52:55,972
I'll not have your cadets
create nuisance in my area.

565
01:52:56,325 --> 01:52:59,999
I'll also not have any civilian
raise his hand on my cadets.

566
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:04,247
Till you police come up
with some valid proof...

567
01:53:05,361 --> 01:53:09,876
...don't touch any army personnel.
We'll break that hand.

568
01:59:13,959 --> 01:59:15,511
Doctor, see the patient's pulse.

569
02:00:26,775 --> 02:00:30,176
No, Major. You can't die like this.

570
02:00:32,441 --> 02:00:35,533
You had promised me that
you'd make me that officer...

571
02:00:36,507 --> 02:00:38,237
...in which the world would see you.

572
02:00:40,330 --> 02:00:43,968
Your cadet is standing
before you, sir. Get up!

573
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:48,145
And make him that kind of
an officer. Get up, I say!

574
02:00:48,672 --> 02:00:53,567
Open your eyes, sir. Get up.
I won't let you die Major!

575
02:00:53,885 --> 02:00:56,480
I won't let you die!
Open your eyes...

576
02:00:57,708 --> 02:01:04,309
Get up! You can't leave me and go.

577
02:01:32,814 --> 02:01:39,415
The Major caught my hand.
He's alive. He held my hand.

578
02:07:55,164 --> 02:07:57,794
A war which a man can't win
with an arrow or a sword...

579
02:07:58,986 --> 02:08:01,060
...a woman wins it, with tears!

580
02:08:03,157 --> 02:08:07,839
Before I get drowned
in my sister's tears...

581
02:08:09,066 --> 02:08:12,017
...I wish that she marries
Vicky as soon as possible.

582
02:08:13,272 --> 02:08:18,439
How many times will you insult us?
That day, in front of all people...

583
02:08:18,624 --> 02:08:22,060
...she has put me to shame.
Even after that you...

584
02:08:22,274 --> 02:08:26,268
- She won't repeat that mistake.
- Why not?

585
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:29,498
Does she look upon that
boy as a brother now?

586
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:36,999
I don't know about that, but
I've told her my decision.

587
02:08:39,304 --> 02:08:41,449
If she refuses to wed Vicky...

588
02:08:43,128 --> 02:08:47,809
...I'll severe that boy's head,
and put it in her lap!

589
02:08:48,342 --> 02:08:50,249
Then? What did she say?

590
02:08:52,581 --> 02:08:56,681
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

591
02:08:58,212 --> 02:09:01,021
Do anything!
But stop Nisha's wedding.

592
02:09:02,175 --> 02:09:06,619
- What shall I do?
Shall I go and kidnap her? - Yes!

593
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:12,873
Have you forgotten? When Daddy had
fixed my alliance elsewhere...

594
02:09:14,061 --> 02:09:17,877
- ...what had you done?
- I just broke into your house...

595
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:25,520
And I lifted you up and
brought you out.

596
02:09:53,406 --> 02:09:57,673
- Don't step out of this Academy.
- Who'll stop me?

597
02:09:58,481 --> 02:10:02,641
I will! I've got an
order from the I.G.

598
02:10:03,833 --> 02:10:06,950
Just think there's a curfew
for you, outside the Academy.

599
02:10:10,716 --> 02:10:12,730
Until Nisha gets married...

600
02:10:14,017 --> 02:10:17,940
...nobody will either go out
of this Academy, nor come in!

601
02:10:23,228 --> 02:10:25,823
...that Nisha's being forced
into this marriage?

602
02:10:27,399 --> 02:10:31,499
- And as long as I live, I'll not
let this happen. - Don't err, sir.

603
02:10:32,577 --> 02:10:36,120
Else our policemen will
riddle you with bullets.

604
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:43,754
Fire as many bullets
as you like, sir.

605
02:10:45,851 --> 02:10:49,252
Today, even if I've to cross
a river of blood...

606
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:51,887
...I'll do it, and show you!

607
02:11:11,154 --> 02:11:14,828
Take all your cadets and go inside.
And till you get further orders...

608
02:11:15,464 --> 02:11:18,865
...the doors of this Academy are
closed to you all. - But, sir...

609
02:12:03,078 --> 02:12:08,280
I've never taught my soldiers
to give up when in problem.

610
02:12:10,655 --> 02:12:14,542
- Why are you sitting like cowards?
- What else can we do, sir?

611
02:12:15,591 --> 02:12:19,928
That Commissioner, and Brigadier,
both have put shackles on our feet.

612
02:12:26,991 --> 02:12:28,933
Even I used to put
shackles on your feet.

613
02:12:30,675 --> 02:12:33,933
Even I used to intensify the guards.
But even then you ran away.

614
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:40,019
Which is that way you used,
to run away from this Academy?

615
02:14:53,318 --> 02:14:58,248
You've fired all your crackers.
Now see our explosions!

616
02:15:18,898 --> 02:15:23,484
Keep lying on the floor.
If you raise your heads...

617
02:15:23,625 --> 02:15:26,398
...you'll go to kingdom come
with our 2nd explosion!

618
02:15:29,534 --> 02:15:33,350
Go and get Nisha.

619
02:17:01,848 --> 02:17:05,106
Major Rana and his cadets
have kidnapped Nisha.

620
02:17:05,810 --> 02:17:09,626
If that's so, then you better
give your resignation!

621
02:17:10,677 --> 02:17:13,794
- You're not worthy of the job.
- What!

622
02:17:15,195 --> 02:17:19,639
Your men have surrounded us.
Then how can our men go out?

623
02:17:20,061 --> 02:17:21,720
Not can, they have!

624
02:17:27,569 --> 02:17:31,527
Hold on. What crap you're
talking. My sister is in there!

625
02:17:31,878 --> 02:17:35,694
- Open that gate. I want my sis!
- This is no door to a temple!

626
02:17:36,675 --> 02:17:40,704
- Which can be opened as per will.
- Sir, if you're so sure...

627
02:17:40,846 --> 02:17:45,492
...that the Major and his cadets
are in, why don't you let him see?

628
02:17:46,129 --> 02:17:48,203
Whether they are inside the
Academy this moment, or not.

629
02:17:52,385 --> 02:17:54,257
Okay. Follow me.

630
02:18:26,130 --> 02:18:32,245
See, I was right. Neither the
Major nor his cadets are here.

631
02:18:32,804 --> 02:18:35,861
- Where is Major Rana, I say!
- I'm here, sir.

632
02:18:44,065 --> 02:18:45,593
Where are your cadets?

633
02:19:11,175 --> 02:19:14,161
If the Major and his cadets are
right in front of your eyes...

634
02:19:15,173 --> 02:19:17,045
...then how can they have forced
their way in, in your house?

635
02:19:31,126 --> 02:19:35,120
You hoodwinked the Commissioner,
but you can't fool me.

636
02:19:35,783 --> 02:19:39,599
- I don't understand, sir.
- Your face shows very clearly...

637
02:19:39,816 --> 02:19:42,067
...that your mission was a success.

638
02:19:46,836 --> 02:19:48,910
Won't you introduce me to Nisha?

639
02:20:01,295 --> 02:20:04,553
Where's Nisha?
The Brigadier wants to meet her.

640
02:20:04,841 --> 02:20:09,355
- I'll just bring her down.
- Come sir, we'll wait inside.

641
02:20:17,735 --> 02:20:20,473
Priya... What happened?

642
02:20:38,832 --> 02:20:41,155
Then did the earth swallow her,
or did the sky took her?

643
02:20:43,211 --> 02:20:47,857
Don't stand with bowed heads,
go out and find her! Find her!

644
02:20:48,217 --> 02:20:50,018
You won't find anything that way.

645
02:20:51,935 --> 02:20:53,322
She's dead!

646
02:20:56,106 --> 02:20:57,136
See this...

647
02:21:21,305 --> 02:21:24,848
Isn't this the same clothing in
which you wanted to see her off?

648
02:21:26,172 --> 02:21:30,686
Well, she's gone alright. From
this house, and this world too.

649
02:21:32,706 --> 02:21:34,021
She committed suicide.

650
02:21:37,642 --> 02:21:42,264
- What! But why?
- You're asking me this?

651
02:21:49,111 --> 02:21:51,185
What had you promised
your dying mother?

652
02:21:52,656 --> 02:21:57,278
That you'll not allow a
scratch on her body.

653
02:21:58,704 --> 02:22:02,247
But you scarred her so
badly from head to foot...

654
02:22:03,014 --> 02:22:07,351
...that pain itself must have
shuddered! You're no brother...

655
02:22:08,575 --> 02:22:14,998
You're a butcher! Who feeds
a lamb from its birth...

656
02:22:15,874 --> 02:22:18,718
...solely with this in mind, that
one day he can kill and sell it...

657
02:22:18,862 --> 02:22:20,391
Just as you sold your sister!

658
02:22:26,649 --> 02:22:29,422
You wanted to be the uncrowned
king of despotic world, eh?

659
02:22:30,506 --> 02:22:33,729
Well, you're a king now. And
we all know how you rule!

660
02:22:34,991 --> 02:22:37,561
You're worse off than
that beggar, who...

661
02:22:38,466 --> 02:22:41,582
...didn't even get his sister's
hate, let alone love, as alms!

662
02:22:44,061 --> 02:22:46,277
Isn't this the same hand, on
which Nisha tied Rakhi for years?

663
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:50,899
It's with this hand that you
throttled her! Before she...

664
02:22:51,048 --> 02:22:55,207
...could glow as a bride, you
turned her into a corpse.

665
02:23:28,169 --> 02:23:32,850
- You're alive?
- Oh brother!

666
02:23:34,425 --> 02:23:37,542
Had she wished, she could have
married Viren and settled down.

667
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:42,418
But do you know what
she said? She said...

668
02:23:43,461 --> 02:23:47,976
If I go after my love,
I'll lose my brother's love.

669
02:23:49,301 --> 02:23:52,773
She sacrificed her love, for her
brother's happiness, only because...

670
02:23:53,541 --> 02:23:57,120
...she wanted you to give
her away on your arm.

671
02:23:58,754 --> 02:24:02,570
But you... you only wanted to
give shoulder to her bier!

672
02:24:03,065 --> 02:24:04,095
So give your shoulder!

673
02:24:11,406 --> 02:24:14,878
Now my sister will marry
the man of her choice.

674
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:20,296
Let there be havoc.
I'll even die if I have to.

675
02:24:21,033 --> 02:24:22,384
But she'll get married today!

676
02:24:25,518 --> 02:24:30,376
Yes, sir. Bring the wedding
party. I'll await you.

677
02:31:22,601 --> 02:31:27,318
I couldn't keep my word.

678
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:31,974
That Parshuram...

679
02:31:33,028 --> 02:31:37,366
...kidnapped Nisha to make
her his daughter-in-law.

680
02:31:39,284 --> 02:31:43,029
Promise me...

681
02:31:45,887 --> 02:31:49,525
...that you'll make Nisha
your daughter-in-law.

682
02:31:51,449 --> 02:31:55,964
Promise me... Major! promise...

683
02:32:22,452 --> 02:32:27,098
No use crying now. Your destiny...

684
02:32:27,249 --> 02:32:32,144
...has been decided by me.
You'll have to marry my son!

685
02:32:33,296 --> 02:32:36,970
Another thing...
This is not a house...

686
02:32:37,676 --> 02:32:43,400
It's a death-trap! Neither that
major, nor his army can save you.

687
02:36:54,529 --> 02:36:57,302
Careful! You go in here.
I'll go there.

688
02:37:08,084 --> 02:37:09,115
Who's there!

689
02:37:24,976 --> 02:37:29,420
- Hurry up. - Right.
- Come on... - Alright, coming...

690
02:38:33,240 --> 02:38:36,191
Why isn't the bride here yet?
Go and get her!

691
02:39:33,925 --> 02:39:35,453
Come on!

692
02:40:25,296 --> 02:40:30,890
- Is this yours? Not mine either.
- Really?

693
02:40:55,395 --> 02:40:56,982
Nisha's here, Dad.

694
02:41:00,261 --> 02:41:04,776
Come my dear. Come on, father...
Let them take the vows.

695
02:41:16,597 --> 02:41:22,392
Nobody move, else it'll be
too late for you to move!

696
02:41:23,966 --> 02:41:25,280
Look over there!

697
02:41:30,847 --> 02:41:34,034
Parshuram Bihari! I had told you!

698
02:41:34,671 --> 02:41:37,515
Don't mess with the Indian Army.

699
02:41:38,146 --> 02:41:42,305
But you didn't heed. You
stirred a hornet's nest!

700
02:41:42,943 --> 02:41:45,087
Now see how I mince you!

701
02:41:52,744 --> 02:41:54,058
Look out, sir!

702
02:42:01,781 --> 02:42:06,983
Ask your men to surrender, else,
there'll be nobody to cry for you.

703
02:42:17,004 --> 02:42:23,321
Throw! With such formidable
security, how did they get here?

704
02:42:24,407 --> 02:42:30,131
Because the Indian Army teaches
to win. Join, and you'll know.

705
02:42:35,148 --> 02:42:39,142
Don't you try however. Because
eunuchs have no place in the army.

706
02:42:39,666 --> 02:42:45,568
Son, this is not the
army's maze but my own.

707
02:42:47,034 --> 02:42:49,605
A man may walk in
on his own feet, but...

708
02:42:49,746 --> 02:42:54,462
...he needs 4 shoulders to
walk out of here. Get that?

709
02:42:55,306 --> 02:43:00,165
We've come here on our own feet
and will return in the same way.

710
02:43:01,216 --> 02:43:03,290
If anything, we'll leave behind
this sinful kingdom of yours...

711
02:43:04,934 --> 02:43:07,470
on whose every wall will be
written in your blood. Foes...

712
02:43:08,515 --> 02:43:14,558
- ...of love will end like this.
- You've already reached the end?

713
02:43:15,396 --> 02:43:20,705
Son, the fight's just started.
See that!

714
02:43:35,972 --> 02:43:38,923
O Englishman, will you
throw your gun...

715
02:43:39,796 --> 02:43:41,182
...or do I spill his brains?

716
02:43:41,950 --> 02:43:48,586
I'm not scared of dying now.
Let me die.

717
02:43:49,458 --> 02:43:53,345
But don't let this beast get
away with it. Don't spare him!

718
02:44:09,408 --> 02:44:13,995
Now stand there and see how
marriages are performed in Bihar.

719
02:44:15,595 --> 02:44:19,410
Come son, take your vows.
Recite the mantras.

720
02:44:44,444 --> 02:44:46,518
Congratulations! You're married now.

721
02:44:49,309 --> 02:44:55,211
We flicked your daughter-in-law
to-be, and you couldn't do a thing.

722
02:44:56,956 --> 02:45:02,858
I've heard that a soldier may
break, but he never bends!

723
02:45:03,942 --> 02:45:08,623
Spare my cadet, and see
what I do with you!

724
02:45:11,554 --> 02:45:15,927
I'm not such a fool to
discard my trump card.

725
02:45:16,836 --> 02:45:20,795
This card makes paupers out
of kings like you for example.

726
02:45:23,024 --> 02:45:26,354
Anyway, the marriage is over.
Now...

727
02:45:26,499 --> 02:45:30,042
...the honeymoon too will be
witnessed by you all!

728
02:45:33,798 --> 02:45:35,705
Son, get on with it!

729
02:45:49,092 --> 02:45:52,836
- This is not Nisha!
- Where is she?

730
02:45:55,070 --> 02:45:56,384
I'm here!

731
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:48,157
Forgive me, Englishman!
I beg you. Spare me.

732
02:47:52,509 --> 02:47:57,297
Go and seek mercy from Nisha.
Whom you humiliated in public!

733
02:48:03,631 --> 02:48:07,518
Apologise to Viren Pratap.
Whose blood you spilt like water!

734
02:48:16,092 --> 02:48:21,543
People like you don't
have the right to live!

735
02:48:28,326 --> 02:48:30,921
The military will not meddle
in the civilian affairs.

736
02:48:50,571 --> 02:48:55,501
According to the law of the
Indian Army, the Major...

737
02:48:55,958 --> 02:49:00,296
...had to face a legal action.
He admitted...

738
02:49:01,276 --> 02:49:06,550
...it was a wrong step, to take
the cadets out of the Academy...

739
02:49:07,254 --> 02:49:08,984
...for illegal transactions.

740
02:49:09,408 --> 02:49:13,923
For which Major Jasbir Singh,
was court-martialled.
