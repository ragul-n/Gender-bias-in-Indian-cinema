1
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,169
The echoing sound of this Great hymn
''HARE MMA HARE KRISHNA'' -

2
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,168
Through our teachers,philosophers
and lords -

3
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,501
Away from this Motherland of
ours by 1000 miles -

4
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,833
Went away at a very
Iong distance

5
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,668
Reached till the Western Civilization
of Europe and America -

6
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:18,168
That civilization,which got suppressed by
making its own machines -

7
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,000
And because of the
financial success -

8
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,502
Had forgotton the happiness and peace
of a person outside and within

9
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,835
Became restless to gain the
peace of the soul -

10
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,000
By reaching among
them -

11
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,835
This divine prayer of
''HARE MMA HARE KRISHNA'' -

12
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,335
Had instrumented a new revolution
into their souls-

13
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:40,170
lt worked as an ointment on their
hungry,thirsty and palipitating souls

14
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,835
Who are these people who without
understanding the meaning of this great hymn -

15
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:31,502
And have altered the meaning of
this great hymn according to their purport -

16
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,634
And are seated oscillating
and unconscious

17
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:04,504
These people,whose religion is smack
Grass,Cockene,L.S.D -

18
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,968
And whose temple is open
physical relationship -

19
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:11,501
These people are leading every moment
of their lives only for this moment -

20
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,834
They are all lost under the influence
of intoxication and enjoyment -

21
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,835
They are all unknown from themselves
unknown from the World -

22
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,169
Unknown from their family members
unknown from the Society

23
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,335
These people,whom the world
addresses them as ''Hippy''-

24
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,667
Why are they running away
from life?

25
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,768
These people,whether they have a
problem with life of they love it-

26
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:30,101
To get an answer on this,why
don't l ask that person-

27
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,170
She is Jasbir,my own Jasbir
whom l liked a lot,whom l loved a lot-

28
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,834
My own part,my
own blood-

29
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,835
Jasbir,tell me,what do you want
what's your desire,why are you like this?

30
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:53,168
Jasbir,what are you doing,you
would have broken the glasses,wear them

31
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,502
Why are you both creating a nuisence
don't you listen to your Nanny

32
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,968
Come on,drink your milk,there's
just half leR in the glass,come on,drink it

33
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,700
Oh shit,Jassu,what are
you doing?

34
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,634
Get up and drink your milk
Prashant even you drink-

35
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,033
Come on,drink your
milk

36
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,166
No

37
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:11,699
No!!

38
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:12,433
No

39
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,833
No

40
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,500
No

41
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:15,833
Will you drink
or not?

42
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:16,333
No

43
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,335
Jasbir my sister,how beautiful
a child she is-

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,035
What does Jasbir want,what
will Jasbir do?-

45
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:28,103
No one ever tried to find it,
neither Mummy nor Daddy

46
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,167
There's a feast for you,this
evening at the Montreal Club-

47
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,435
You had asked me to remind
you,will you go?

48
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,167
Go and ask
Mrs.Jaiswal

49
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,300
Will she not get angry,if
l go in and ask?

50
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,034
How do l know,you yourself
go and ask

51
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,435
Mrs.Jaiswal,can l disturb you
for a second?

52
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,700
Yes,what's it?

53
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,834
This evening,there's a feast
for you-

54
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,033
lf you are going,then l'll
call them up

55
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,834
Ask Mr.Jaiswal

56
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,567
He told to ask it from
Mrs.Jaiswal

57
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,300
So,can't he himself come
and ask-

58
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,701
He alway's sends
you to me-

59
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,500
Go and tell him,to come
and ask me-

60
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,634
And,don't come infront of me
with this ill-omented face

61
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,768
Be thankful,that a decent girl
like Miss Swami work's in this Office-

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,835
Had l kept a beautiful and a
fast secretary for myself-

63
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,501
Then l would have seen,how you
would have shown your tantrums on her?

64
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:12,169
Then you wouldn't have sent her
to my room for asking small matters-

65
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,168
You would have kept her,
Iocked in your room

66
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,367
Today,you have again
broken this glass-

67
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:21,167
Will you make this your
daily practice-

68
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,002
Look at him,he drink's it
without shouting

69
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,833
And you...

70
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,434
l'll not drink,from
her hands

71
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,501
Then,everyday,will l go back
of you,by taking the glass?

72
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,701
Alright,come here

73
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:31,766
You don't come
neaf Me

74
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,167
You have removed your
glass and thrown it-

75
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,667
Had it hurt her eyes,
then?

76
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,168
Jassu look,if you don't wear
your glasses-

77
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,667
Then,one day you'll not be
able to see anything-

78
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:41,767
You'll become blind

79
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,333
Take my child
drink it

80
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,167
Why are you beating
the child?

81
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,168
You have never given me the happiness
then how can l expect it from children?

82
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:54,833
Brother...

83
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,701
Why are you crying,look,how
fast l have drank the milk

84
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:03,104
Brother,Mummy says,l'll not be
able to see anything,l'll become blind

85
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,333
That Mummy had told it
out of anger-

86
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,902
lf you wouldn't have thrown the glasses
on Nanny,Mummy wouldn't have told that

87
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,836
No,l'll not wear the glasses
everybody in the School mocks at me

88
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,835
Then,don't wear them ,wear them in
the House,and remove it in the School

89
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,668
Then,According to Mummy,l'll
not be able to see anything

90
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:17,767
Then,keep wearing
them

91
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,568
Look,how nice it
Iooks

92
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:21,966
No...

93
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:23,833
Look at me

94
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,434
No,No....

95
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,035
Look at me,look
Iook

96
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,369
Prashant,have Mummy and
Daddy come back from the Club?

97
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,835
Nanny,have Mymmy and Daddy
come back from the Club?

98
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,502
As though,everyday they come back early
from the Club,that they'll come today

99
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,235
Today,lnfact it's their party,
quietly sleep

100
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:32,334
What was the necessity of doing
so much of drama?

101
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,834
Who did the drama,
me or you?

102
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:36,835
l didn't commit any Crime,if l
danced with Miss Lal-

103
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,166
Even,you were
dancing

104
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,969
There is a difference between dancing
and embracing a person-

105
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,768
And,that too with a
third-class woman

106
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:46,834
Mind your language,you
are over drunk

107
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:49,835
l wasn't drunk that much,that
l couldn't notice your actions-

108
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:52,301
With that third class
woman,Miss Lal

109
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,034
lf you have seen the actions
then understand

110
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,834
What?

111
00:11:56,866 --> 00:12:00,502
That,the time has come,that l
tell you,that l don't love you at all-

112
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,368
That's because,you don't
Iove me-

113
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,169
l love Miss Lal,it's because
she loves me-

114
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,701
And now,it's not good for me to
stay with that woman-

115
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:08,700
Who doesn't have any
concern for me-

116
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,502
And now,the time has come that
we get seperated from each other

117
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,335
Yes,so that she comes here,in
this House Instead of me-

118
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,834
And makes love
with you

119
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,001
Let that bitch come,l'll slipper
one on her face-

120
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,668
And l'll throw her down from
the window

121
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,669
Such prostitutes are sold for few
pennies in all the Club's like Montreal-

122
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,000
Even l am seeing it for the
Iast 3 years-

123
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,333
Today with this girl,tomorrow
with the other

124
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:29,834
Whom did you call
a prostitute?

125
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,002
Go and throw this glass on the
face of Miss Lal

126
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,500
On whom did you
slipper?

127
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,668
Don't think,that if you are
embracing her,you can kick me

128
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,668
l am your husband
your busband

129
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,501
Either you go off from here
or l'll go-

130
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:48,002
And l'll return only then,when your
ill-omented presence will not prevail here

131
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,834
And don't think that l am simply
giving you a threat

132
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:53,335
l have already got prepared
the divorce papers-

133
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,167
l knew that such a situation
would arise

134
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,168
Once l leave from here,only
then you'll remember me

135
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,170
l'll immidietly call up my Brother,so
that he comes and takes me from here

136
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,668
What's the point of staying
in such a House-

137
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,667
Where,there's neither happiness
nor peace-

138
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,667
Neither there's contenment
nor Respect

139
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,002
At the time of marriage itself
my parents were telling-

140
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,669
That without a due thought,you are
marrying a person in a foreign country

141
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,167
God forbidden if...

142
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,669
l'll not let my children also,
to stay over here-

143
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,835
The law will decide,whether these
children are mine or your's

144
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,668
l have already made the arrangements
for their Boarding School

145
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,334
Jasbir will go to St Mary
School and...

146
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,001
Neither Jassu will stay here
nor will Prashant-

147
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,168
Both of them will go back
with me to India

148
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,334
The one who can't take care
of his wife-

149
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,333
How will he take care of
their children?

150
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,166
Let's see!

151
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,667
Mummy,are we going back
to our Country?

152
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,501
So,will Jassu come
with Daddy?

153
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,335
Son,the court has snatched
my Jassu from me

154
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:02,168
Your Daddy did not want that
she should come with us to India

155
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,668
But,you are her big Brother
isn't it-

156
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,500
When you grow more
older-

157
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,502
You, yourself go and bring her
back to India

158
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,168
Now,neither you are Miss
nor Lal

159
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:49,003
Jassu,my child,what happened
did you get any dream,what happened?

160
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,505
Where is Prashant,call
Prashant,l'll go to him

161
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,335
l have sent Prashant to India
along with your Mother-

162
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,168
When you grow old,you go
and meet Prashant

163
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:07,336
So,will Mummy and Prashant
not come back again?

164
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,502
Look,my child,children should
be given good Education-

165
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,334
So that,they become intelligent
when they grow old-

166
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,834
They should become
self-sufficient-

167
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,169
That's why,sometimes for studies
they should go far from the House

168
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:18,834
Prashant will study
in India

169
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,169
And we'll send you to the boarding
School of St Marys-

170
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,669
Where good students study,so that
when you grow old...

171
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,500
You don't talk
to me

172
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,335
Jassu,is this the way of
talking to elders?

173
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,834
Now she is only
your Mother

174
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,834
No...,She is not
my Mother

175
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,002
lt would be good,if you send her to the
Boarding School as soon as possible-

176
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,667
She'll get refined

177
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:42,670
Give her to me,l'll make her lay
on the bed,you go and take rest,Go

178
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,834
Come on child,quietly go
to sleep-

179
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,169
And now if you cry, a witch
would enter from that door

180
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,835
Nanny,when will Prashant
come back?

181
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,668
My child,now Prashant will
never come back

182
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:58,666
Why?

183
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,502
Your Daddy has done a
second marriage-

184
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:03,667
She is your new mother in
that room

185
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:08,837
So,my mother is no more my
mother who leR me and went away

186
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,337
My child,your mother has
died forever-

187
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,501
And along with her
even Prashant

188
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,501
So,even Prashant
has died

189
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:29,170
Yes,even Prashant has died,otheMrise
wouldn't he had come to you

190
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,501
So,has the God taken Prashant
with him?

191
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,167
Yes my child-

192
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:39,004
Think that, God has taken both
your Mother and Prashant with him

193
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,169
But Daddy was telling,that he
has been sent to India

194
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:46,670
No,my child,your Daddy was lying
so that you don't get a shock

195
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,501
Mummy,l am absolutely fine
in the School-

196
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,834
Mohan and Jim have become
my best friends-

197
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,335
But,l remember you,Daddy
and Jassu a lot

198
00:16:56,533 --> 00:17:00,503
When a plane goes across me,l feel
like sitting in it and reach MontReal

199
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,501
Even l'll become a pilot,when
l grow old,fly an Aeroplane-

200
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,169
So that,whenever l feel like
l'll reach Canada

201
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,833
Your son

202
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:17,338
Prashant,today aRer so many years
Daddy broke his silence-

203
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,334
l received his long
Ietter

204
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:23,002
And aRer reading it,my remembrances
as a child in MontReal became fresh-

205
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,502
Today,again,infront of my eyes,l am
able to see Jasbir moving,in the way-

206
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,834
Like that of 16
years ago

207
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,835
Because,it was wrong,that we
thought,that Jasbir is dead

208
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:35,335
Jasbir is alive,and she
is in Katmandu

209
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,835
l am departing to Katmandu
by the next flight-

210
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,835
And,l am also sending you a
ticket of Aeroplane-

211
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,167
Even you reach there,by the
next flight-

212
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,501
The Valley is looking very beautiful
from the top-

213
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,333
How is this City
Katmandu?

214
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,835
Prashant,this is your first flight
towards Katmandu,isn't it

215
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:04,001
That's why,even l thought,l'll
make this a holiday trip

216
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,170
l have bid a Good bye to
Indian Airlines for a month

217
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,001
Captain Kapur is siting at the back
isn't it

218
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,333
Yes,Yes

219
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,668
He'll accompany you on your
way back to Delhi

220
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,334
Still there are no signals
of landing-

221
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:18,336
One AircraR has iust landed,and
another one is ready for a take off

222
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,667
Come on,let's have
some fun

223
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,001
Let's make the passengers,have a
Iook on the City,from the top

224
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,000
Look at that,it's the
Temple of Suyambu

225
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,669
Arey Masina,you are still
upstairs-

226
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,670
You were supposed to get a garland
made of flowers for the God from down

227
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,668
Mr.Shastri,coming

228
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:48,836
Oh Bother Toofan,Today l suppose
you are making a good money-

229
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,669
Don't forget on making some,as
an offering to God

230
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:56,002
The money of the disiples of God
If it doesn't go to the God himself-

231
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,167
Then,where else would
it go?

232
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:00,835
Yes folks,the plane has got disapeared
now turn your heads over here

233
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,504
This Suyambu is 2000 years old
add 20 years more to it-

234
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,502
That's because for the last 20 years
this servant of yours-

235
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,669
Has been regularly telling this to
their Tourist brothers and sisters

236
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,834
Look,lt looks like a
Tibbatian working centre

237
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,334
Arey,you people,haven't you
seen an Aeroplane before?-

238
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,835
Come on,everybody get in,get
on to your work,fast

239
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,000
Order

240
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,166
Shit

241
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,334
Shanti,How is the work
going on?

242
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:51,502
By your coming here,has the
sales of the people increased or not?

243
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,835
Drona sir,lt's iust
great

244
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:55,501
Yesterday the manager sir,
was telling-

245
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,669
That from the time,you have kept
Shanti,as a sales girl over here-

246
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:03,503
The foreign Tourists are coming to
the shop by three folds more

247
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,503
And,even l have started making
rounds over here,the every 3rd day

248
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,503
Drona sir,that's great,lnfact you
should be coming here daily

249
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,334
Why not,lt's all
yours-

250
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:17,169
Had you not seen this wonderful place
we wouldn't have got it-

251
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,334
To establish this centre
over here

252
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,835
Manager sir,your thought is
absolutely wonderful

253
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,334
We want only wonderful
things

254
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:28,336
Shanti,was Sathi right,that
we should be coming here daily?

255
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:31,502
Drona sir,not tomorrow,because
tomorrow its the festival of Bhaktpur-

256
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,670
And we both Shanti and Sathi along
with the people of our dance academy-

257
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:39,502
Have fully prepared for
the God's dance

258
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:42,666
ls there a crash
some where?

259
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,334
Look,How l have decorated
these dresses-

260
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,167
Anybody's heart would lure
for them

261
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,334
l am luring
come here

262
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,333
You come here

263
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,335
You said,that you'll
hike my salary

264
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,501
l promise,lt will
be hiked

265
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,336
Look outside,people have come
to buy Clothes

266
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,167
This is Soaltee

267
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,667
ls that Soaltee?

268
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:12,834
Yes,the most fashionable
Hotel of this place

269
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:20,002
lt's loaded with beautiful
white women

270
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,667
l referred about white women
and Prashant,you got lost

271
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,668
Chatteriee,ls your Daddy
alive?

272
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,835
You are landing at Katmandu
and thinking about Daddy

273
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,501
lt's been 3 years,that he
has expired

274
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:36,836
Very soon,the parents die,children
cry and forget them in a very short span-

275
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:42,503
And in the due course,the longing
for their remembrances decreases-

276
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,168
But when parents are alive and
still stay away from children-

277
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,834
And their remembrances trouble
their children-

278
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:49,000
And the children can not
meet them

279
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:52,668
Then probably,you can't estimate
what it feels like?

280
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:54,667
Your father is in Canada,
Isn't it?

281
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,835
Yes Canada
MontReal-

282
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:01,168
And we stayed in a Boarding School
of India,right from our childhood

283
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,170
ln the last 16 years,Daddy has
just written 3 letters to me

284
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,834
And in the last 12 years
just one

285
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,835
But suddenly,l got a letter
saying my son

286
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,501
l have learnt that you are
a pilot in an Airlines

287
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,167
You also must be going on a
flight to Katmandu-

288
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,500
lf not,then immidietly go
on a holiday to Katmandu-

289
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:17,833
And Inform me immidietly,as
soon as you reach there

290
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,334
The Soaltee Hotel of that place,
which is recently opened-

291
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,835
There's a Casino,the moment you
get down from that stairs

292
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:26,835
The moment you enter into a Disco
theque,which is on the right hand side-

293
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:28,500
May be you....

294
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:02,167
Why so soon,what about me,who is been
standing for such a long time

295
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:04,668
Meer,let me take some rest,
But first get me a drink-

296
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:07,001
One Beer,l am feeling
very Thirsty

297
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,834
One Beer

298
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:15,835
Now come,let me see how much you can
dance,l'll exhaust you completely

299
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,833
Did you get
hurt?

300
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,667
Wait,let me take
some more rest

301
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,168
First,give me my glasses,let
me see who you are?

302
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:36,667
Now,catch hold of
my hand

303
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:44,167
Do you like
this face?

304
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:46,000
A lot

305
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,968
What do you think,no one other
than you can wear them?

306
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,970
Even with these
glasses?

307
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,667
Jenis is a wonderful
girl-

308
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,668
From the time she has come
to Katmandu-

309
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,334
The glitter of this Disco
theque has got enhanced

310
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,834
What did you say her
name as?

311
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,000
One Brandy

312
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,166
One more

313
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,670
lf you are waiting here for Jenis
then immidietly push off

314
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,668
lt looks as if,you are the
only admirer of Jenis

315
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:01,836
lf you have doubts about it,then
throw it out from your heart

316
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,334
No,l have no
doubts

317
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,504
And don't be under a mis-understanding
by looking at her dancing in this way

318
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:13,001
Meer is my friend,and
Jenis knows about it-

319
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:16,002
And we all friends,share
each others things-

320
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:17,166
One Branddy

321
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,501
Since,when do you
know Jenis?

322
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:26,836
Jenis,l am waiting
out

323
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,168
You went away,without even
answering to my question

324
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:39,501
lt's been how many days,since
you have come to Katmandu?

325
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,834
Still one day is
not over

326
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,835
And It's been 2 months since
Jenis has come here-

327
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,836
And l know her from the same
day on which she reached here-

328
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:53,336
And,lf anybody tries to come
between both of us,then....

329
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:56,834
Jenis come,lt's
getting late

330
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:00,502
Tell Dera to pour
another Beer-

331
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,333
We'll leave
aRer that

332
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:04,834
4 Beers and along with it
the bill

333
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,502
1 Beer for Jenis,and give me
the bill

334
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,669
lf sir wants to drink,he can
drink at leisure in that corner-

335
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:13,334
Let him not take trouble of
mixing with us

336
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,501
Deepak,you are blowing
hot and cold

337
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,668
Look,l want to offer you
all a Beer-

338
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:20,500
And,your friend,all of a sudden
got angry

339
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,334
You are kicking away
a free offer

340
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,500
Dera,get me
a Beer

341
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,168
Who amongst you will
have a Beer?

342
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:32,001
And for a change,don't give
the bill to Mr.Deepak-

343
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,501
Take it from
sir

344
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:54,503
Here,have another Brandy,and
this is your entire bill-

345
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:56,334
4 Brandys and
12 Beers

346
00:26:59,866 --> 00:26:59,999
To the Bakery

347
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,501
Michele,here your commission
is completed

348
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,335
This time,even if you offer a little
more commission-

349
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,668
l'll take it

350
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:17,002
Because,the previous Idols,which were
taken away from the Temple-

351
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:20,335
Had it not been smuggled in
todays flight-

352
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:21,834
Then you would have
definitely been caught

353
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,334
Michele,that's why l appreciate
you-

354
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,336
Because l doubt,that the police
was having a little doubt on us

355
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:38,003
Till the time,these hippy people stay
in all the Houses of your area-

356
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,837
And till the time,by your grace
Michele runs a Bakery for them-

357
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:46,669
Till that time,neither the robber
can be unknown,nor the robbery

358
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,001
They all must be at
the Bakery

359
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,669
First,you would like to come
to my palace or to the Bakery?

360
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:01,500
Yes,let's go to
the Bakery

361
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:22,338
Michele,they all were your people
they are all going towards Bakery

362
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,003
Well,your's as well as your friends
rent has still not reached-

363
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,337
Don't force me to give you a notice
of leaving this entire property

364
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:38,169
Drona sir,you'll get your rent
give us some more time,l'll tell everybody

365
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:44,669
Daddy,had written,that l'll find
Jasbir dancing is Soaltee-

366
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,668
And l think,l iust now
met her-

367
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,835
But,why did everyone say her
name as Jenis?

368
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,501
And,Even l was also a
little sceptical

369
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,336
Why don't l call Daddy
in MontReal

370
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,501
Who Prashant?

371
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,502
l am calling up from Hotel Mansarovar
in Katmandu

372
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,501
Daddy,are you recognising
my voice?

373
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,503
Yes my son,How are you,
your voice...

374
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,169
You should have atleast sent
a recent photograph of Jassu-

375
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,835
lt would have made my work easy
in recognising her-

376
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:32,168
So,Couldn't you
recognise her?

377
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,668
How couldn't l,she is
my sister-

378
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,335
But l want to ask you,that
aRer we came back to India-

379
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,668
Did she keep another
name for herself?

380
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:44,335
No,Oh yes may be she has
kept,out of fear-

381
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,335
She had taken money and ran away
about a year back-

382
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:50,502
And it's possible,that she is scared to
disclose her name out of the police fear

383
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,168
She had become quiet a rebel
before she ran away-

384
00:30:53,366 --> 00:30:56,669
And for the last 1 year,we thought
that she,in an accident would have...

385
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:02,670
And listen,over there,there's
a very good friend of mine-

386
00:31:02,866 --> 00:31:05,168
l have written to him also,
you definitely meet him-

387
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,501
Even l am trying to catch the
very next flight-

388
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,834
l'll telegram you,as soon as
it gets confirmed

389
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:15,168
Arey,leave,you'll go so far
to meet Jasbir at Katmandu-

390
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,167
She is not bothered,that she
has a Daddy

391
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,168
She is anyways absconding
for the last 1 year-

392
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,501
As though previously she used to
come,meet you,leaving her friends

393
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,168
She was always in the last
when it came to studies-

394
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,667
And was always ahead,when it
came to brash behaviour

395
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,667
Had my own daughter failed
like this-

396
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,167
l would have
squashed her

397
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:33,835
Where does this young crop
stay in Katmandu?

398
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:34,333
Who?

399
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:37,501
The same,who keep roaming
as Hippies?

400
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:41,503
Sir,sleep for now,meet them
tomorrow when the down arises-

401
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:46,503
You'll find all of them on roads
in Bazaars,on cross roads-

402
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,335
But,make your start
from Suyambu

403
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,200
These people have been singing
from age old times

404
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:13,336
And today,spcially for you,
l have made them wait here

405
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,001
Oh my Bothers
MOVe

406
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:24,168
Your fate,has brought you to
the Temple to Suyambu-

407
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:28,169
Definitely a miracle will take place
remember my words,l am talking truth-

408
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,000
And Lama peopel stay
over here-

409
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,335
ln case you go astray in Nepal,
and to spend your night-

410
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,501
You'll get a lot of peace under
the feet of Budha-

411
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,835
And Shanti is a fabulous
dancer of Katmandu

412
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,002
The moment she looks up at someone
he becomes mesmerised

413
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:45,168
And my name is Toofan
absolutely opposite of Shanti

414
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,668
And Toofan is the one,who can
make you reach till Shanti-

415
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,167
Give me a chance to
serve you-

416
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:52,668
Every Tourist of the world has taken
something or the other from Toofan

417
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:53,833
Only you
are leR-

418
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,668
The moment l got up in the
morning,l heard God's voice-

419
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:57,167
That a man from India
has come-

420
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:00,001
You'll find him wandering,here
in Suyambu,definitely help him

421
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:05,335
The one whom you are in search for,
she is not far from my sight

422
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,168
lf the ceremonial dot is put
on the forehead-

423
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:19,002
And if you concentrate on God,he
immidiately enters into your heart

424
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,835
Why have you stopped,even l
am deviated from the path

425
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,668
When did you become Jenis
from Jasbeer?

426
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,833
What did you say?

427
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:38,334
Since,when have you changed
your name?

428
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,168
What name,
which name?

429
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:49,835
lf everyone has put the ceremonial
dot,then come,it's getting late

430
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,669
That man has started following me,
are you liking this?

431
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:02,001
lf you have to stay in Katmandu
here aRer don't follow Jenis

432
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:16,334
Take the help of Toofan,your
entire journey will be a sucess-

433
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,167
OtheMrise,she is a girl,she'll put
you into such a trap-

434
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:20,334
That,all the followers of God
Pashupathi together can't...

435
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,001
They all stay here,in the
same House

436
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,334
lt can be known
right away

437
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,667
Ay! Masina

438
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:26,166
Yes,Brother Toofan

439
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,500
Who had come up?

440
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:28,499
No one

441
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,169
Does any one else also stay here
or have you given the House on rent?

442
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:34,168
No,How will Mr.Shastri,give
his House on rent?

443
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,834
Where did those people go,
who just now came up?

444
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:45,667
Which people?

445
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,834
A few boys and girls had come
here,isn't it

446
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,833
l don't remember

447
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:11,333
What's your name?

448
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:13,500
Daily How much lie do
you speak?

449
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:16,002
Sir,l stay in Temple,l haven't
spoken any lie till date

450
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,834
Then,why didn't you give me
the true answer?

451
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,001
Sir,The matter is,that they
gave me 2 Rs-

452
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,000
And asked me not to say it to
anyone,that we came here-

453
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,167
And,l told it
to you-

454
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:27,003
And sir,more over,they are all my
friends,l sometims dine also with them

455
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:29,334
Sir,lt's a fact,that Masina
never speaks a lie

456
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,334
And he is known to my
small Brother-

457
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:32,667
And there are no wear abouts
of his parents

458
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:35,835
Sir,he is lying,all the Gods and
Godesses of this Temple are my parents

459
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,167
Sir,he is saying
the truth-

460
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,001
ln Katmandu,there is
a famous saying-

461
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,335
That,Masina has been thrown
by God,straight from the sky-

462
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:44,335
That's why everybody loves him,
and no one refutes to his talk

463
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:46,168
Masina,l felt happy aRer
meeting you

464
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:46,833
Sir,even l

00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:56,502
Alright tell me,where do these people

470
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:57,333
What do they do?

471
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,334
Sir,they are all,very
good people-

472
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,835
They never fight with anyone,
they all enjoy life-

473
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:03,667
They sing,drink,sleep,roam
and eat-

474
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:06,335
They are all called as English
Hippy people in Katmandu-

00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:07,834
l'll Introduce you
to them

476
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,001
Look,how nice a person
Masina is...

But sir,don't try to bid a
price on me...

478
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:14,167
Actually,l'll take you to that place
where those Hippies go

479
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,168
Yes sir,on this you should
ask Toofan

480
00:36:17,366 --> 00:36:20,168
Todays,it's the Bhaktpur festival,the

00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:21,500
This,we'll spend it

482
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:25,336
And then,when you see Shanti,you'll

How did she become
a Hippy?

490
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,501
Arey,Who is this young man
standing between both of us?

00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,501
Then,should l have hit
a sand particle?

495
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:26,168
You are ruining all
the fun

496
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,668
lf you want to have more fun
l'll give you one kick -

497
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:31,001
And the gluing which is going on
through these binoculars -

498
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:33,001
You'll find the whole World
swinging within a second

499
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:34,166
Col. Who is he?

500
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:37,335
Boss,you don't get angry,our sir
is just joking with you -

501
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:38,667
Look in the front,you can
do business

502
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:40,334
Work,Work,Work
always work

503
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:48,672
Had the frock been liRed a little more
It would have been a different scene

504
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,335
l have tried enough,but...

505
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:00,168
Look,Look,...Look

506
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:04,003
You think yourself to be very clever
when it comes to girls

507
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,168
lf you are feeling very restless
come on,go ahead and catch her hand -

508
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,501
Let me also see,how much
courage you have?

509
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:12,436
lf l give one whistle,10 such girls
will come standing in front of me

510
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,637
My name is Drona,l am surprised
till now,how did you not know it?

511
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,002
l keep the entire city on the
point of my shoe

512
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,701
The point of my shoe is
also no less -

513
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:27,169
lf Shanti,looks at you,her sight
will freeze on you -

514
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:28,834
Her heart will throb
for you -

515
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:32,502
And the wave that would rise,here
take,its the local intoxication drink -

516
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:34,835
Have two sips with me,the sight
will have more colour -

517
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,167
And the dance will become
more colourful -

518
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,300
Sir,take it,take

519
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,501
Take it sir,don't refuse,its
your money -

520
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,835
lf she looks over here the lightening
will crackle more powerfully -

521
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,834
And the bottle will turn into pieces
once it falls from your hands

522
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:08,501
Don't break the heart of
a poor Nepali -

523
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,768
The friendship will grow more
stronger by striking the bottles

524
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,371
Wow! Great!over here too
my dancing beauty

525
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:22,904
Meet our sir Mr.Raia,he has
specially come to meet you

526
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:27,569
Not Mr.Raia,people call him
King Indra -

527
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,501
Who has come into the arena
to watch the dance -

528
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:32,500
Shanti,what are you looking
over there,look here -

529
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,434
l have brought so many
photographers for you

530
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:37,101
Before you wink,there will be
1000 photographs clicked of yours

531
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:42,170
Wonderful my dear,every heart throbs
for you,but mine throbs the most

532
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:49,004
May be your pining breaks the glasses
of binoculars and the lense of your camera -

533
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,701
And the one who has to take her
takes her and flees off

534
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,334
l don't have an excuse
of a Camera -

535
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,701
But,l'll definitely go aRer making
your impression cast on me

536
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,969
Sir,what an answer,look
Shanti is enjoying,looking at you

537
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,168
Shanti,be careful before you
throw your arrow -

538
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,502
lnfact,its better if you stay
here itself

539
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:12,170
lf he loves you so much,then ask
him if he has the guts of coming infront

540
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:17,502
Sir,when the sight doesn't get settled
it turns and becomes shy

541
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,836
And the attraction which will come
out from this person's heart -

542
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:24,369
That will definitely penetrate through,
and make the hearts restless

543
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,636
Sir,don't leave it,you have won
Shanti's heart,she called you Kancha

544
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,502
And Kancha in Nepali language
means ''Young Colourful Lover''

545
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,435
Shanti,where are you going atleast
go aRer meeting my photographer friends

546
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:22,434
They have all come from
Europe and America -

547
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,635
To cover all the important and special
events of Katmandu in their magazines

548
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,168
l told them,who can be a more
eminent personality than Shanti -

549
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,168
ln the entire city,especially on
the occassion of this festival -

550
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:33,168
Just the greetings won't do,you'll
have to come in the night -

551
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:33,999
l have called all of them
to the casino -

552
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,167
They'll take your
interview too

553
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:58,637
Drona sir,my name is Prashanth
Forgive me,if l have exceeded my limits

554
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:00,367
l am quiet a low
headed person -

555
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,504
But you,this local drink and
Shanti incited me a little bit

556
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:07,499
Greetings

557
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:17,367
What was the necessity of throwing
the garland at him?

558
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,001
Didn't you like,that he made
Drona bite the dust -

559
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:21,434
Didn't allow him to hang
around near that girl

560
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:24,035
And now,if he again comes back
to enquire about you,then?

561
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:25,834
Listen

562
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,001
Had l leR away,without saying
a word of thanks for the garland -

563
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:31,167
lt would have been my
impertinence

564
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:34,168
lnfact,in the morning,you were about to
put the ceremonial dot,but you stopped -

565
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:35,500
l didn't like that

566
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:37,033
Now,there's iust one
thing lacking -

567
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,835
And if l put the ceremonial
dot on your forehead -

568
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:41,167
Put it and
See -

569
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,034
lt's been ages,that any one has put the
ceremonial dot on this forehead

570
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:53,033
You all come here

571
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:40,701
Remove these glasses,it doesn't
Iook good,it spoils the face -

572
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,834
Look how this is spoiling
my face

573
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:44,701
No,infact it looks better
Iook -

574
00:47:44,933 --> 00:47:45,833
Don't l look more
handsome?

575
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,834
Jenis,l hate you

576
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,368
Where did l hear this word
''Hate'' from?

577
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:52,699
Deepak,you

578
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:56,834
Everyone,throw Deepak out
from our boundary -

579
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,035
There is no place for a person in our
group who believes in hatred

580
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:02,168
Okay,then go,bye-bye to you
and to your group

581
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,371
And take this,take,take more
drink and abuse me -

582
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:10,701
And go die with him and don't
come back -

583
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,834
And let me also see,how long
does he stay with you? -

584
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,702
lt's been more than 2 months,that
l have wandered with you like a dog

585
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,367
Ask Meer,Greg
and John -

586
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:18,167
l have quarrelled with my
father for you

587
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:22,103
And you,if you also want to associate
your name among these Martyrs -

588
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:22,767
Then,take her along
with you -

589
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,101
One more dog will be seen
wagging his tail

590
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:35,502
Whom did you call a dog
Do you know who l am?

591
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:38,301
And that Jenis,
come here

592
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:44,567
Jenis,will you go
with him?

593
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:06,502
lf you think,that you can come
in between our unity -

594
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:08,835
Then,every time,you'll get
insulted like this

595
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,701
Come on,Go,do
your work

596
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:25,833
Getting too hot
is not good -

597
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:28,701
Share a little brandy with us
you'll get relief

598
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,001
Drona sir,don't offer me
the Brandy

599
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:34,501
lt wouldn't be good for you,if
the fire rages more

600
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,434
You are getting angry on such
a small matter -

601
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,036
You can find such insects creeping
all around Katmandu -

602
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:43,168
Let this be between us,l can
take her whenever l feel like

603
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:48,101
Arey,Why are you insulting
my guest?

604
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,702
All this wouldn't have happened; Had
you not come here following that hippy girl

605
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:12,369
There is blood on your face,
wipe it off

606
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:17,835
Or else,take back your garland
which you made me wear

607
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:23,669
Sir,the battle field can be won
only aRer sheding the blood -

608
00:50:23,866 --> 00:50:25,968
Come,let's have another drink
COMe,COMe

609
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:32,834
Arey Toofan,Masina,someone
has robbed my wallet

610
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,334
Nothing can be known in such a big
crowd,may be its fallen somewhere

611
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,433
Sir,how much money was
there in it?

612
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:39,434
Whatever,l had brought to Nepal
everything was in it -

613
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:41,300
Did a mistake,l should have
IeR it in the hotel

614
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:43,167
Sir,if your wallet has fallen somewhere
then,you'll definitely get it -

615
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,501
There is no one in Nepal
who robs

616
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:47,502
A wallet loaded with money
has fallen somewhere -

617
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,836
lf anyone has seen please
give it back,please give it

618
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:55,702
Sir,l have 5 rupees which l had saved;
if this can solve your purpose...

619
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,501
And the money which l had
it was yours -

620
00:50:57,733 --> 00:50:59,000
lt became as drink and went
into my stomach

621
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,837
Sir,there's a way,if God showers his
grace on us,let's go to the Casino in evening -

622
00:51:04,033 --> 00:51:05,701
May be this 5 rupees of Masina
proves to be lucky -

623
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:06,833
Yes sir,this is
also possible

624
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:09,001
You both are very innocent,if one
has only 5 rupees with him -

625
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,501
Even gambling doesn't
favour

626
00:51:11,066 --> 00:51:12,300
Sir,come with me

627
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,000
Where?

628
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:14,501
Don't question
just come

629
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:16,167
Come,Come
Come,Come

630
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,835
Look at that,he is
our God

631
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,834
Sir,once l cried
cried a lot -

632
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:30,703
God caioled me and said,Masina
my son,never shed your tears -

633
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,168
You will never lack anything
in life

634
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,436
And sir since then,the entire
city looks to be mine -

635
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:37,500
Someone calls me son,and
someone calls me brother

636
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:38,500
Sir,he is right

637
00:51:38,733 --> 00:51:41,035
Sir,l'll go and have
a word with God -

638
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,500
So that,in the evening you
play in a Casino -

639
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,102
May be the money that you
have lost is back in your pocket

640
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,035
But Masina,to stake,5 rupees
is nothing -

641
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,702
The money that we win,will be in
accordance to the money that we stake

642
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:54,169
Sir,l have spoken with God,and
to fulfil that,is my job

643
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,702
Aunty,l need some
money

644
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,501
Then,why are you standing
down,come up

645
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,501
Look Masina my child,l only
have 10 rupees with me -

646
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:07,234
lf this can solve your purpose
then take it

647
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,835
l need some money,
come with me

648
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:29,566
Now tell

649
00:52:30,066 --> 00:52:30,666
4

650
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:40,968
lts 3,didn't l say that its
the money touched by God

651
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:43,901
Who allowed a small boy like
you to enter into the casino?

652
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,501
lts prohibited for
children

653
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,669
Sir is my friend and l have
come here aRer God's blessings

654
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:51,301
You play gambling by keeping
a child besides you

655
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:54,168
Your talent will be known only
if you play with a player

656
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,701
Sir,iust play one
more time

657
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:03,633
Masina is right

658
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:06,502
Even God has not permitted me
to play more than 3 times

659
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,969
Throw it in the same way,as
you threw it earlier

660
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,100
One Beer

661
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,434
Why are you making children develop
the habit of beer?

662
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:44,668
lf your lips are drying
then take this

663
00:53:47,466 --> 00:53:49,968
Play like a sport,what's this,all
the four have attacked on him

664
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:52,835
Then,l'll myself settle my
accounts with him

665
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:02,768
So that,the wounds of yours
don't become septic

666
00:55:11,866 --> 00:55:14,368
Masina,carry them and distribute
half from this,among yourselves

667
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:16,501
Mr.Drona,there is no fault
of mine in this

668
00:55:27,466 --> 00:55:28,166
Your handkerchief

669
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:30,167
Keep it with you

670
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,434
May be,Mr.Drona will be wanting
to ask you

671
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:37,504
Mr.Drona has his own,of silk he'll
take that one out

672
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,835
What are you people doing here
go away from here

673
00:55:41,066 --> 00:55:42,500
Go and follow him and see
where he goes

674
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:52,501
Neither you know to lose nor
do you know to get defeated -

675
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,101
This is the biggest fault
in big people -

676
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,501
And above that,you spoke
a lie -

677
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:59,701
Under the deception,saying that
journalists from all over the World will come -

678
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:02,501
There's a feast,they'll take your
interview,you must definitely come -

679
00:56:02,866 --> 00:56:04,300
Where are those
people of yours?

680
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:09,636
ARer your father's death,l brought
you and your mother from Banaras -

681
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,501
And gave the support,and
is this the regard for it?

682
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:15,836
l got you a iob,saved you from
shame,is this the regard for it?

683
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:17,833
The people who shower mercy
don't show it

684
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:22,502
Not mercy,but l want to
shower my love on you -

685
00:56:23,866 --> 00:56:28,003
l have everything,no one refuses
if l give a hint

686
00:56:28,266 --> 00:56:32,436
Had love been a bargain,then
probably l would have told a yes -

687
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,235
But l regret,it cannot
be bought

688
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,635
You have completely finished
Drona's chance -

689
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,703
Take Shanti along with you,the
entire Nepal will watch gazing

690
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:46,368
l am wasting my time for the last
1 year,couldn't even hold her hand

691
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:48,234
What are you blabbering
about Shanti?

692
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:50,701
Arey,What are you doing
hitting a child

693
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:53,634
l am watching your movements
since morning -

694
00:56:54,033 --> 00:56:55,834
ls this the only way leR
to empty sir's pocket

695
00:56:56,466 --> 00:56:59,168
lf sir's intention has gone wrong
then take him to some shady joint -

696
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:02,502
Don't ever take Shanti's name
infront of him

697
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,834
Sir,Shanti is not a
characterless girl -

698
00:57:05,066 --> 00:57:09,170
lf by chance,he has put a wrong
notion of hers to you -

699
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,234
Then,throw
it out

700
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:12,768
Just ask Shanti also,as to
what she wants -

701
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,368
Don't you all have any other iob
other than Shanti

702
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:19,035
That Drona sir,has an eyebrow of
his being rich,of being a boss

703
00:57:19,466 --> 00:57:21,501
And here,Sathi whom l
joined for the dance -

704
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:22,834
He keeps showing his right
On Me

705
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:26,502
And you,l am watching you
vagabond from months -

706
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:29,169
By taking Shanti's name you are more
worried about increasing the tourist rates

707
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:34,704
You don't listen to anybody
Do whatever you feel like

708
00:57:36,866 --> 00:57:39,168
Why brother,did you listen to
what Shanti said

709
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,169
l never saw that this had some
cash in it,l thought it to be empty

710
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,836
Wow! This has Mr.Drona's rent
of everybody

711
00:57:59,733 --> 00:58:02,102
Last night,l felt very bad,aRer
hearing from that wicked Drona -

712
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:03,700
That,if the rent is not paid
within a week -

713
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,302
He'll throw us out from
the bakery

714
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,504
This aRernoon when l prayed,
God showered me with money

715
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:17,571
Everybody's rent has been collected
and kept in this -

716
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,336
That's why Deepak,if anybody tries to
borrow money in the excuse of rent -

717
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:22,700
Then,plainly refuse

718
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,503
And Dera,today whatever edible stuff is
there bring it and keep it in the front -

719
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,501
Today,they'll eat
so much -

720
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:32,502
That for the next 1 year,they'll
not feel the necessity of eating

721
01:05:01,066 --> 01:05:02,434
What are our people
doing? -

722
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:08,171
l told them to squash him,these idiots
are watching drama,aRer getting intoxicated

723
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,001
They even couldn't have a proper
aim of the bottle -

724
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:12,001
lf we don't leave soon from here
there is a risk of the Police coming -

725
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:15,102
l iust now saw Inspector
Thapa coming

726
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:19,501
Who,lnspector Thapa
Tell me?

727
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:22,235
Sir,there is a big turbulence going
on here amongst the hippies -

728
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:23,333
l need your orders

729
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:24,767
What's the necessity in
asking for it?

730
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:27,835
Sir,even your son Mr.Meer
is indulged in this

731
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:30,435
What,even Meer is
among them?

732
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,767
There is blood on
your face

733
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,434
Even on your face...

734
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:50,503
lf this doesn't stop in a second
l'll give the orders for firing

735
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:51,833
My daddy

736
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:55,636
From the time you all have come to
Katmandu,you have spoiled the city

737
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:58,101
Come on get lost from here,
and go to your dens -

738
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:02,169
And,tomorrow morning everybody's
Visa will be snatched -

739
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,834
And your entry will be restricted
in coming into this city

740
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,167
Deepak,Daddy will hold
you responsible

741
01:07:08,466 --> 01:07:12,503
Who,Deepak,come out,put
him into my car -

742
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:17,503
l'll ask your daddy that he'll prefer
you see arrested in a jail or in house

743
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:21,168
Come on get out from here,take them
out,put them into the police van

744
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:23,701
Come,Come everybody
come out

745
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:25,367
No daddy,l iust came
here and sat

746
01:07:38,733 --> 01:07:40,334
Oh! What do you think,can
you escape by hiding -

747
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:43,667
First and foremost,put him
into the jail

748
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:47,668
lf you want to sit like this
among these hippies -

749
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:49,501
Then,dare you enter into
the house -

750
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:56,306
Come,otheMrise,l'll tear your
skin apart with a belt,come out

751
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,368
lf you lock them into the iail,even
the jail will start rottening

752
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:27,367
Leave them by giving
a warning -

753
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:31,036
And tell them,if they again create
turbulence,the police will not spare them

754
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:39,502
Go,everybody can go,consider this
to be your last warning

755
01:09:21,133 --> 01:09:22,634
Why are you repeatedly
following me?

756
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,334
lf the answer for my question
is given -

757
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:26,167
l'll try not coming back
of you forever

758
01:09:26,366 --> 01:09:27,100
Quickly ask me

759
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:28,700
You came here leaving
Canada

760
01:09:28,933 --> 01:09:29,300
What?

761
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,167
ls your name not
Jasbir Jaiswal?

762
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:34,167
Didn't l tell you
its not

763
01:09:34,366 --> 01:09:35,333
ls your father not
Jaiswal?

764
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:36,333
Don't take his name

765
01:09:36,533 --> 01:09:37,300
ls your mother's name
not Diya?

766
01:09:37,533 --> 01:09:41,770
My mother has died and even
my father,now you go from here

767
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:44,167
Leave me

768
01:09:44,366 --> 01:09:46,501
You trust me,are you remembering
anything?

769
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:50,635
Let me live,l want to live my life
l want to be alive

770
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:54,168
Jasbir has died
Iong ago

771
01:10:10,066 --> 01:10:15,504
Mr.Upadhya,your son Mr.Deepak
is under my custody -

772
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:20,304
Even if you come and give his bail
l have no intentions of releasing him

773
01:10:20,533 --> 01:10:22,968
And neither,l have any
intention of giving his bail -

774
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:27,337
lt would be better,if you chain him
and lock him up for the entire life -

775
01:10:27,533 --> 01:10:29,701
They have spread nudity in
the entire city

776
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:33,636
Mr.l.G.P,l am myself sick and tired
of his brash and irresponsible behaviour

777
01:10:33,933 --> 01:10:35,000
Here,take it and listen for
your ownself -

778
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,368
Even your daddy holds the
same opinion as l hold -

779
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:41,703
Aren't you ashamed,this long beard
Iong hair,lice in the head -

780
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:43,834
The thick layers of dirt which is
deposited on your body -

781
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:47,435
l don't understand the meaning of
you people joining with those hooligans

782
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,836
Daddy you are wrong,neither
they are bad nor hooligans

783
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:53,835
Then,who are those people are
they Prophets of today's era?

784
01:10:55,266 --> 01:10:56,634
Uncle,your thoughts have
become old

785
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,168
And Daddy,don't forget,there is
one big gap between us

786
01:10:59,366 --> 01:11:04,170
There is a generation gap between us
and our principles...

787
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:05,233
Stop blabbering

788
01:11:06,466 --> 01:11:10,837
The only gap which is between us
is that l'll give you one slap-

789
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,701
And all your principles of which you
blow a lot of trumpet -

790
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,634
Would be thrown out and
will disappear

791
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:19,703
Go see your face in the mirror,your
appearance looks like that of a monkey

792
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,234
You are playing the Guitar?

793
01:11:24,866 --> 01:11:25,833
You must be upset

794
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:26,433
Where were you?

795
01:11:27,466 --> 01:11:28,967
l was preparing a Smoke
for you

796
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:31,101
l knew you must be craving
for it

797
01:11:31,266 --> 01:11:33,301
And l have collected
everybody's rent

798
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:34,834
Next time,if Mr. Drona
ask's for it-

799
01:11:35,033 --> 01:11:35,900
l'll throw them on
his face

800
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,501
l had told you that l'll be
Iate in the night

801
01:11:55,866 --> 01:11:57,500
l shall lock the door from
outside 8 go

802
01:11:57,699 --> 01:11:59,835
So that your sleep is not disturbed
when l return

803
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:03,169
lf you return so late in the night
can l sleep?

804
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:05,767
You should not worry about
me mother

805
01:12:06,066 --> 01:12:07,300
Because Shanti is your
daughter -

806
01:12:07,466 --> 01:12:09,568
And she knows how to take care
of herself

807
01:12:10,133 --> 01:12:11,901
You go to sleep,l'll change
my dress

808
01:12:31,466 --> 01:12:32,700
How can l stop worrying
about you?

809
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:35,502
You have returned so late 8 you
are going out again

810
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:38,102
What's going on,tell me
everything truthfully

811
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:41,101
l'll tell you everything
truthfully,mother

812
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:42,834
Have faith on your
daughter

813
01:12:48,466 --> 01:12:49,834
lf we spend the
night here

814
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,834
God won't be offended

815
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,033
Why should he be
offended?

816
01:12:53,266 --> 01:12:55,167
There are thousands 8 lakhs
of houses here

817
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,434
Will God not be pained
aRer knowing

818
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,968
That not a single person offered
you shelter for the night

819
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:03,767
l have come to fetch you
l'll take you home

820
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,834
Where is your house?

821
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,834
Right here,infront

822
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:09,433
Who all are there
in the house?

823
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:09,999
My mother

824
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:10,999
Besides her

825
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:12,700
Besides her,me

826
01:13:13,466 --> 01:13:14,099
And

827
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,500
And God

828
01:13:15,733 --> 01:13:18,368
God is here also,and there
is Peace also here

829
01:13:18,533 --> 01:13:21,836
And let your mother sleep
in Peace

830
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:24,968
And the three of us spend the night
here at the feet of God

831
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:28,035
Sir to spend the night my house
is also there

832
01:13:28,266 --> 01:13:30,835
ARer both of you feel tired of
talking,come over

833
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,168
ln the other room Mr.Shastri
sleeps soundly

834
01:13:34,466 --> 01:13:35,633
He'll not know

835
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:45,300
Have you seen your
face Shanti?

836
01:13:46,466 --> 01:13:47,700
And have you seen
yours?

837
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:50,567
lt's partly seen

838
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,300
l am a Simple Girl
of Nepal

839
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,835
But perhaps you like hippy
girls better

840
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:01,834
Wearing Jazzy clothes

841
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:04,667
How did you know my
preference so soon?

842
01:14:05,533 --> 01:14:07,835
l can also dress
like them

843
01:14:10,066 --> 01:14:11,700
Tell me truthfully what's on
your mind?

844
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,034
Why do you iump in the fire
frequently?

845
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:19,702
Perhaps l have come to Katmandu
to jump in the fire

846
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:21,767
That girl has tortured you
a lot

847
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,033
Which girl?

848
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,233
l was watching
everything

849
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:27,900
Do l look unhappy,
Shanti

850
01:14:28,466 --> 01:14:29,033
Very much

851
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:31,334
You should be a keen
observer to know

852
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,167
You are also
unhappy

853
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:34,700
That's why l
have come

854
01:14:35,733 --> 01:14:36,233
For what?

855
01:14:36,866 --> 01:14:38,834
Perhaps by sharing the unhappiness
of each other -

856
01:14:39,066 --> 01:14:40,300
We may get some
happiness

857
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,335
You have many admirers Shanti,why
should you be unhappy?

858
01:14:46,133 --> 01:14:49,035
Suddenly if you start
liking somebody

859
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,301
Should one feel ashamed to tell
the truth?

860
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,635
lt will be really not a matter
of shame

861
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:01,967
Are you seeing,Mr.Drona

862
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:05,501
l have never been hurt so much
before as l am hurt today

863
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:10,835
Shanti,l don't know whether,l am
right or not

864
01:15:11,066 --> 01:15:11,299
Why?

865
01:15:11,866 --> 01:15:15,336
Because the purpose for which l
have come here,should not be lost

866
01:15:16,466 --> 01:15:18,167
Suppose l get involved with you
and go astray

867
01:15:18,366 --> 01:15:19,366
Go ahead,l may be
of some help

868
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,301
No,you wouldn't be able
to do anything

869
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:24,168
l can't tell you anything,l can't
tell anybody anything

870
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:24,666
What?

871
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:25,767
Nothing

872
01:15:27,133 --> 01:15:28,501
Don't ask me anything now

873
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,234
l wouldn't ask
neVef

874
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,102
Because l am absolutely sure that
you will do the right thing only

875
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:36,434
And God will be
with you

876
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:42,834
ldol is of Gold

877
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:45,167
Michele was saying

878
01:15:46,066 --> 01:15:50,503
ln America it will be worth
50,OOO dollars

879
01:15:50,733 --> 01:15:52,901
Meaning it won't be worth
Iess than 5-6 lakhs of rupees

880
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:53,967
When shall we take it?

881
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:59,370
No other night will be better
than tonight to take it

882
01:16:00,866 --> 01:16:02,367
Once the idol is taken away
from here

883
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:09,372
For all our other theRs those
Iovers will be blamed

884
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:17,500
Has Mr.Shastri slept?

885
01:16:17,733 --> 01:16:18,500
Who is Masina?

886
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,667
Oh Mr.Drona,so late
in the night...

887
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:23,335
Night is not over yet
Mr.Shastri -

888
01:16:23,533 --> 01:16:27,503
This is the time for devotees to talk
to God who is in heaven

889
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:29,635
l iust came from devotional singing
8 l remembered -

890
01:16:30,066 --> 01:16:34,703
That l should tell you that a
cheque is ready for the Temple

891
01:16:34,866 --> 01:16:36,701
l will send it through Sathi
in the morning,please take it

892
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,434
Thank you Mr.Drona

893
01:16:38,866 --> 01:16:40,834
May God give you a
Iong life

894
01:16:41,066 --> 01:16:43,034
And you get more
blessings

895
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,035
Your blessings are needed
Mr.Shastri

896
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,501
Mr.Shastri he is the
same tourist -

897
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:51,168
Who had been quarrelling with
people the whole day

898
01:16:51,733 --> 01:16:56,971
But what is he doing at this time
of the night in the Temple with Shanti

899
01:16:57,666 --> 01:17:02,504
What obiections can we have when
Mr.Shastri is here?

900
01:17:02,733 --> 01:17:04,234
Okay Mr.Shastri
greetings

901
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:06,501
Forgive me if l have made
any mistake

902
01:17:10,066 --> 01:17:10,966
Mother also says the
same thing

903
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:13,835
That Guests are considered
as Gods in Nepal

904
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,169
lf you come with me to my house
mother will also feel happy

905
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,634
But what'll your
mother think?

906
01:17:19,066 --> 01:17:21,168
Who is he,where has he come
from,What has he come for?

907
01:17:21,733 --> 01:17:23,367
He is unnecessarily claiming a
right over my daughter

908
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:26,502
Suppose l give you that right
just now,then?

909
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:45,633
l'll wait

910
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:54,701
Golden Idol of God
is missing

911
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,768
Who is the one,who is
stealing the idols?

912
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,501
lt has happened 5 times
earlier also

913
01:19:06,733 --> 01:19:09,168
Last week,it was on the
papers headlines

914
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,834
Yes l also read it

915
01:19:12,866 --> 01:19:13,766
TheR in the temple!!

916
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:17,002
ln the last 4 months,this is
the 6th theR in our temple -

917
01:19:17,066 --> 01:19:18,500
And the entire Police Department
is sleeping

918
01:19:19,066 --> 01:19:20,033
Take out all
those files

919
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:22,434
Which relate to the
previous theRs

920
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:25,168
And the names of those people who
are our suspects

921
01:19:25,733 --> 01:19:27,301
l will investigate this
case myself

922
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:34,368
Previous theRs are going to be
investigated throughly

923
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:38,101
lnform Michele that the Idol
should not remain with him

924
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,002
Till the idol is sent
out of the Country

925
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:44,634
He should hide the Idol
somewhere quickly

926
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:48,502
Listen,what happened to
Suyambu's cheque?

927
01:19:48,733 --> 01:19:49,333
l am going there only

928
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:53,368
Mr.Shastri,Mr.Shastri
where are you?

929
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:55,701
Mr.Shastri what's happening in
our temples everyday?

930
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,035
l have brought Mr.Drona's cheque
for the temple

931
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:01,234
And find that God's Idol
is missing

932
01:20:01,733 --> 01:20:04,435
Masina who was there aRer
we leR last night

933
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,901
There the devotional songs
were over and here

934
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:11,170
Forget it,so many Tourists
are roaming here

935
01:20:11,466 --> 01:20:12,233
Yes yes go ahead

936
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:15,701
lt's like blaming
Shanti

937
01:20:15,933 --> 01:20:17,301
lf you have doubt
on somebody

938
01:20:17,466 --> 01:20:19,367
Then it is your duty
to tell his name

939
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,435
Masina what's the name
of that Tourist

940
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:22,166
Yes Prashant...

941
01:20:22,466 --> 01:20:23,767
Somebody was saying
just now

942
01:20:24,033 --> 01:20:25,167
That last night Prashant

01:20:25,366 --> 01:20:26,834

And aRer Shanti leR

945
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:32,369
Prashant was loitering alone near
the Temple till morning

946
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,167
lt can't be
possible

947
01:20:33,533 --> 01:20:35,034
lt's a false accusation
on Mr.Prashant

948
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,034
He can never do such
a thing

949
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:37,033
Who is accussing?

950
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,435
Under the circumstances doubt
can crop up,what do you say?

951
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:40,433
Yes Yes

952
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:42,635
He can do it,why was
he loitering-

953
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:43,934
Near the Temple whole
night?

954
01:20:46,866 --> 01:20:48,968
Are you sure he will come?

955
01:20:50,066 --> 01:20:50,766
Yes mother

956
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:53,435
And l'm very sure that he
won't come

957
01:20:53,866 --> 01:20:57,636
Whole night l was awake,
By seeing you awake

958
01:20:57,866 --> 01:20:59,300
For one hour l am
seeing you-

959

Standing in the window
scanning the road

960

Getting attached to a stranger
so soon,l can't understand it

961
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:12,303
l think by now he must have
IeR Katmandu

01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,834

963
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:16,967

967
01:21:42,733 --> 01:21:43,366

l came to know last night,how
much you love me

969
01:21:50,366 --> 01:21:53,602
Believe me,lf Meer's Daddy didn't
drag us away forcibily

970
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,302
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,

971
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,302
How has our parents obliged us by
bringing us into the World?

972
01:21:59,566 --> 01:22:03,336
lt was their moment o!ioy 8
passion that we were born

973
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:05,901
Yes,Had they asked us
before giving birth-

974
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,068
lf would have been a
different matter

975
01:22:08,266 --> 01:22:09,700
Stop being Philosphical-

976
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:12,502
Daddy is bent up on auctioning
our dress shop

977
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,002
Come,we'll not give him a chance
to reach boutique before us!

978
01:22:15,366 --> 01:22:18,035
What did you say?your Daddy
is auctioning the clothes!

979
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:21,336
Great! that means it'll be free
to the needy and poor!

980
01:22:21,533 --> 01:22:23,601
Come on friend,help me in taking out
my pant from the Cup-board!

981
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,601
And help me in wearing
this stockings!

l am afraid,may be your father

984
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:25,301
Both Mr.Shastri and Sathi
say that they saw

985
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,669
Prashant talking with Shanti
all through the night there!

986
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,937
Now,tell me,who else was with
Prashant other than you!

987
01:24:33,133 --> 01:24:34,067
Mr.Prashant is
not a thief!

988
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,301
lt is as truthful as the God
in the Temple!

989
01:24:36,366 --> 01:24:39,001
And it may be as false as,this
isn't the Temple of Suyambu

990
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,669
Mr.lnspector! If Prashant
isn't the thief!

991
01:24:41,866 --> 01:24:43,234
Then,no one else is a thief!

992
01:24:43,433 --> 01:24:45,601
Because,Prashant is
the thief!

993
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,335
No one else is a thief other
than Prashant!

994
01:24:48,633 --> 01:24:51,002
Mr.lnspector! Ask him,
where the 3 were?

995
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,335
What they were doing,all the
day with Prashant!

996
01:24:53,533 --> 01:24:57,770
He,Toofan and Shanti!

997
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,833
Mother,l am going for work!

998
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:02,201
lf Prashant comes,tell him
that l can't meet him!

999
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,001
Tell him to forget about yesterday
night's matter!

1000
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,767
And never try to
follow me!

1001
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:10,936
Prashant is his name,
take down!

1002
01:25:11,133 --> 01:25:13,001
l am Toofan! and his
name is Masina!

1003
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,101
We were with him yesterday! and we'll
be with him today also!

1004
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,602
lf you want to take us to the
Police Station,take us now!

1005
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,234
Because,we have not committed
any Crime!

1006
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:22,335
Masina is the son of God! and
l am a guide here!

1007
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:26,670
Whatever l earn daily,l offer
100/o of it to God!

1008
01:25:26,866 --> 01:25:29,435
And from those,whom l earn
l first test their hearts!

1009
01:25:29,633 --> 01:25:30,500
And then their purses!

1010
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:31,934
Toofan is my name,take it
down again!

1011
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:34,167
lf ever this Toofan meets
a theif

1012
01:25:34,366 --> 01:25:38,670
He'll iudge him as fast as he
shows this place!

1013
01:25:38,866 --> 01:25:40,834
Write down! Prashant
is not a thief!

1014
01:25:41,066 --> 01:25:42,367
Because,Toofan is his guide!

1015
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,369
lt would be better if you two give the
statement in the Police Station!

1016
01:25:45,566 --> 01:25:47,000
Because,lf people have
any doubts...

1017
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:50,102
Yes yes...l have doubts!
we all have doubts!

1018
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,970
And Mr.Shastri will also not refuse
because he had seen it!...

1019
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,434
l know,why you are aRer
Mr.Prashant!

1020
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,069
lf Shanti loves him,he
isn't at fault!

1021
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:01,600
Go and tell Mr.Drona!

1022
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,002
Mother,the times are no more for
pity and benefaction!

1023
01:26:04,266 --> 01:26:06,334
lt's a sad news for me to tell
and for you to hear!

1024
01:26:06,633 --> 01:26:09,402
That your daughter has got entangled
into the web of such a person!

1025
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,502
Who has brought dishonour
to me and you!

1026
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:15,101
She is going to be proved
as a thief!

1027
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,403
That too,whose sin will not be
absolved for generations!

1028
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:21,769
Son,l am unable to understand
whatever you are saying?

1029
01:26:22,366 --> 01:26:25,502
Mother,How can l explain it to you?
my heart is crying like hell!

1030
01:26:26,133 --> 01:26:27,734
Because,l consider you
very close to me!

1031
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,435
Colonel! You explain her
everything

1032
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,701
Mother,do you see that
thing opposite?

1033
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,434
Auspicious Suyambu's Temple!

1034
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:38,669
Yesterday night,there was a theR
of the most Beautiful Idol!

1035
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:42,336
And everyone is doubting
that Tourist Prashant!

1036
01:26:43,033 --> 01:26:46,002
What did you say,son!
Idol of the God?!

1037
01:26:46,866 --> 01:26:54,840
And mother,l am sad for,everyone is getting
informed about Shanti and Prashant!

1038
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,601
This one also...take this one also
take away everything!

1039
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,771
ls there anyone here,who can buy
the full boutique?

1040
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:04,668
l'll give full stock for rock
bottom price!

1041
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:06,000
The stock isn't a
robbed one!

1042
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:07,601
lf you want to buy,pay the
genuine price!

1043
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,502
We have put in months of our sweat
in designing and making them!

1044
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:15,438
And in these,our forthcoming income of
blood and sweat is also there!

1045
01:27:15,633 --> 01:27:17,234
And that too for
a good cause!

1046
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:18,700
Look at that!

1047
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,168
Whoever likes this,Can take
this free of cost!

1048
01:27:24,366 --> 01:27:27,502
This action will close the
Boutique forever!

1049
01:27:27,699 --> 01:27:30,669
Dare anyone touches them!touch
only if you have money!

1050
01:27:30,866 --> 01:27:32,767
Or other wise,who likes to
wear them!

1051
01:27:33,466 --> 01:27:38,838
What's the price of that pant
and shirt with silver buttons?

1052
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:41,001
Why bother about price take
it free of cost!

1053
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,368
Nothing less than Rs 250 it's
the costliest dress!

1054
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:46,567
Don't consider it as your
Dad's free property!

1055
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:48,501
These are,if not made from your
Dad's money!

1056
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:50,234
Then with those money,they
were made?

1057
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:51,667
Don't listen to him?!

1058
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:53,400
Take away,whichever
you like!

1059
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,337
They have already brought bad reputation
to our culture and civilization!

1060
01:27:57,533 --> 01:28:00,602
With their wrongful,worthless
and absurd decisions!

1061
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,234
Quickly,empty this bus!

1062
01:28:02,433 --> 01:28:05,435
So that l can fill you
colourful people in them

1063
01:28:05,633 --> 01:28:08,268
And take you out of this
City forever!

1064
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:14,871
l fully agree with you
and your way of life!

1065
01:28:16,633 --> 01:28:18,501
Whenever,l see you
and meet you

1066
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:22,336
l feel there is an unbreakable
bond of relationship between us!

1067
01:28:30,699 --> 01:28:33,669
Will you give back that dress?
and leave this place?

1068
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,135
lf you can stop me from buying it
take a chance

1069
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,901
And,this is its price!

1070
01:28:46,533 --> 01:28:47,567
He is Prashant Jaiswal!

1071
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,502
Your information is correct,he's
staying in Mansarovar Hotel!

1072
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:52,101
And he is a pilot with
Indian Airlines!

1073
01:28:52,566 --> 01:28:55,435
According to his father's letter his
intention of coming here is...

1074
01:28:57,033 --> 01:29:00,669
That boy Sathi was always accusing
him,what's his intention?

1075
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:02,334
For whom does this
Sathi work?

1076
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:02,900
For Mr.Drona!

1077
01:29:03,866 --> 01:29:06,501
And l have heard that
Mr.Drona loves Shanti!

1078
01:29:07,233 --> 01:29:08,334
And Shanti loves
Prashant!

1079
01:29:08,633 --> 01:29:10,334
Yes sir! That's what
l have heard!

1080
01:29:10,733 --> 01:29:14,169
May be,it could be like this Mr.Drona
has some bad intentions in this?

1081
01:29:14,533 --> 01:29:14,900
Sir!

1082
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:18,168
Accusing Prashant and
getting him caught!

1083
01:29:41,033 --> 01:29:42,167
The Bill is for Rs 65

1084
01:29:43,033 --> 01:29:46,102
And this Jacket! About which
you were asking! It's worth Rs 12O

1085
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,235
Uncle! If that man outside
enquires about me

1086
01:29:52,433 --> 01:29:53,000
Tell him that,l am
not here

1087
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,100
Tell Miss.Shanti...

1088
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,100
Shanti is not here...

1089
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:06,668
lf she comes back,give her
this on behalf of me!

1090
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:55,768
This is from me!

1091
01:34:56,633 --> 01:34:59,669
You too wear it with as much of love
with which l wore this!

1092
01:34:59,866 --> 01:35:02,435
This is a product of Tibetan culture centre!
not to be given free of cost!

1093
01:35:02,733 --> 01:35:05,802
This Centre hasn't taken a contract
for the love of you both!

1094
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,167
Where did that
Manager go?

1095
01:35:07,366 --> 01:35:08,266
l am not taking it
free of cost!

1096
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,235
Mr.Manager please cut the price
from my salary!

1097
01:35:11,433 --> 01:35:12,167
Yes...Yes...Why not?!

1098
01:35:12,366 --> 01:35:18,171
No Mr.Manager,let him keep it
as a charity from me!

1099
01:35:18,366 --> 01:35:19,333
Wear it quickly!

1100
01:35:19,533 --> 01:35:25,672
Because,now she's going to take him from
here to Snowclad mountains!

1101
01:35:26,033 --> 01:35:26,500
What?!

1102
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:28,802
How can l refuse your orders
Mr.Drona?

1103
01:35:29,966 --> 01:35:31,400
Look l am wearing
the Jacket!

1104
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,368
lf you have gut's take it
off from me!

1105
01:35:34,166 --> 01:35:35,433
And now,l am going
with Shanti

1106
01:35:35,633 --> 01:35:38,635
While you are watching,to the
priest of the Temple!

1107
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,602
So that he ties a knot
between us

1108
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,502
Which millions of people like will never
be able to break it even it desired!

1109
01:35:53,466 --> 01:35:55,634
Mr.Manager this is the price
of your Jacket!

1110
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,000
And a few more!

1111

And that Jacket is a giR from us

And these Garlands
from us!

1116
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:18,135
On this anspicious day don't tell Prashant
about Police enquiry and theR!

1117
01:36:18,366 --> 01:36:20,334
Bless them! Bless them!...you
have brought them together!

1118
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:24,669
Mr.Sathi please forgive me
If l had hurt you!

1119
01:36:24,866 --> 01:36:27,001
Hey! Mr.Drona,l am not to be
faulted for this!

1120
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,535
My Job is to show the Tourists
places of interest!

1121
01:36:29,733 --> 01:36:32,735
lf someone,develops
Iove for it

1122
01:36:32,933 --> 01:36:34,601
Then,whatever God does
it's always good!

1123
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,835
Whatever God does,it's
always good!

1124
01:36:37,033 --> 01:36:42,338
lt was good...lt was good
Victory to Mr.Prashant!

1125
01:36:44,566 --> 01:36:45,066
Mr.l G P

1126
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:57,404
l wanted to talk to you regarding
yesterday's Temple's TheR!

1127
01:36:57,733 --> 01:36:59,801
Just now it was on the
tip of my tongue!

1128
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,535
You had asked it yourself and
saw it with your own eyes!

1129
01:37:03,133 --> 01:37:04,767
That Shanti and Prashant!....

1130
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,201
...You too have doubts
on them!

1131
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,267
1000/o!

1132
01:37:07,566 --> 01:37:09,834
lnfact,l suggest that,you search
Shanti's House!

1133
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:12,502
May be it is possible,that you
get something from there!

1134
01:37:12,866 --> 01:37:15,335
Shanti is working here and Prashant
has come to meet her!

1135
01:37:16,266 --> 01:37:18,768
lnfact he was friendly with workers
and roaming with them!

1136
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:21,268
There's possibility that he may have
passed from your House!

1137
01:37:21,466 --> 01:37:22,466
That you were watching!

1138
01:37:23,266 --> 01:37:27,737
l have a warant in my pocket
to search the entire premises!

1139
01:39:03,866 --> 01:39:05,601
Mr.Jaiswal,you never wrote
about your visit?

1140
01:39:06,433 --> 01:39:08,468
l thought l'll give you a surprise
aRer reaching Kathmandu!

1141
01:39:08,933 --> 01:39:10,334
But,the circumstances under
which we started...

1142
01:39:10,699 --> 01:39:11,934
She had to come from Bangalore!

1143
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,667
And what a coincidence!!

1144
01:39:13,866 --> 01:39:16,034
Our planes reached here at
the same time!

1145
01:39:16,233 --> 01:39:18,001
l am unable to understand
your puzzlers!

1146
01:39:18,199 --> 01:39:19,234
You are coming from Canada!

1147
01:39:19,433 --> 01:39:20,333
Sister-in-law is coming
from Bangalore!

1148
01:39:20,533 --> 01:39:22,234
May be l wouldn't have
written it to you!

1149
01:39:23,366 --> 01:39:24,800
ARer we settled in Canada!

1150
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,235
16 years ago we got
divorced!

1151
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:30,768
Only children were the link
between us!

1152
01:39:31,066 --> 01:39:33,368
Prashant in India and
Jasbir in Montreal!

1153
01:39:34,533 --> 01:39:36,568
She too aRer Vanishing
for a year-

1154
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:41,270
lf my friend had not written me
aRer seeing her,Here in a disco!

1155
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:45,837
Atleast you could have made Jasbir
reply my letters!

1156
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:50,969
lf l had concealed the fact that her
real mother and bother are alive!

1157
01:39:51,633 --> 01:39:52,767
lt's for her good only!

1158
01:39:53,433 --> 01:39:58,171
lnfact,initially,l never let her
see your's and Prashant's letters!

1159
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:03,938
At that iuncture it was better for her
to forget about you forever!

1160
01:40:04,533 --> 01:40:07,002
As if you two never
existed in her life!

1161
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:12,570
Then,would she have forgotten
she has a mother and brother!

1162
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,433
Who are alive!

1163
01:40:16,533 --> 01:40:18,001
Thakur,that is our story!

1164
01:40:19,533 --> 01:40:21,768
And now,whatever you police think
about Prashant,thief or a dacoit!

1165
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:23,333
He is our son!

1166
01:40:24,433 --> 01:40:26,434
And l have told you about the
reason for coming here!

1167
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:28,901
Jaiswal! l am bound
by my duty!

1168
01:40:29,366 --> 01:40:31,134
Because,a network has been
established in the City!

1169
01:40:31,633 --> 01:40:33,601
So that,we police without
arresting anyone!

1170
01:40:33,699 --> 01:40:36,335
The truth will be out!

1171
01:44:40,766 --> 01:44:41,900
l have brought this
flower for you!

1172
01:44:43,366 --> 01:44:46,368
My mother told me that,Janice
Ioves flowers from childhood!

1173
01:44:46,566 --> 01:44:49,101
Come what may,she'll feel
happy seeing them!

1174
01:44:51,133 --> 01:44:54,736
Remember Janice! How beautiful these
flowers used to be?

1175
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,570
Beauty is in the Heart!
In the Eyes!

1176
01:45:08,066 --> 01:45:09,500
Take a deep puff of
this smack!

1177
01:45:09,699 --> 01:45:11,835
This will spoil my chest!
l have Asthma problem!

1178
01:45:12,866 --> 01:45:15,134
lf you want to be with us
then be one like us!

1179
01:45:16,466 --> 01:45:18,067
Do you believe in
God or not?

1180
01:45:18,633 --> 01:45:20,835
Janice,will l get God
if l smoke this?

1181
01:45:21,033 --> 01:45:23,568
Great Sages and Great Souls spend
their lifes!

1182
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,069
On the peaks of Mountains
chanting the name of God!

1183
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,469
So that he could get him!
and see the Light of God!

1184
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:33,668
And Visualising this
all of them!

1185
01:45:34,933 --> 01:45:37,435
Take deep puffs of this!

1186
01:45:44,133 --> 01:45:45,033
And when the eyes
are opened!

1187
01:45:45,233 --> 01:45:47,268
They get mesmerised by the
divinity of God!

1188
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:50,335
lf you had come for love,then
don't refuse this nectar!

1189
01:45:50,733 --> 01:45:55,070
OtheMrise,l am visualizing that
emptiness will eat you from inside!

1190
01:45:55,433 --> 01:45:57,001
And the thirst will
start growing!

1191
01:45:57,966 --> 01:45:59,000
You have got peace in this!

1192
01:45:59,733 --> 01:46:00,333
There's Intoxication!

1193
01:46:01,466 --> 01:46:02,133
There's love!

1194
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:40,835
Mr.Thakur's son is also here only
And he has come out just now!

1195
01:47:03,699 --> 01:47:05,935
l am sorry! l have a search warrant
of your House!

1196
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,167
Why? What happened?

1197
01:47:07,933 --> 01:47:10,335
Don't you know about the theR
of Suyambu Idol!

1198
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,433
TheR of Idol!?!

1199
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:12,867
Golden Idol!! The costliest!

1200
01:47:13,633 --> 01:47:14,133
Don't you know about it?

1201
01:47:15,166 --> 01:47:17,468
Then, are you here with a complaint
that we stole that idol!

1202
01:47:18,066 --> 01:47:21,335
But,we have heard that,Mr.Prashant
is living here only!

1203
01:47:26,366 --> 01:47:27,767
Janice,are you very happy?

1204
01:47:28,699 --> 01:47:31,669
Very much! l never had it since
l leR my Home!

1205
01:47:33,433 --> 01:47:34,167
When did you leave
your Home?

1206
01:47:36,766 --> 01:47:38,767
May be a year,since l ran away
from there!

1207
01:47:40,966 --> 01:47:42,767
lt's a thrill to run away
from Home!

1208
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:46,402
Particularly,when you know that
no one requires you there!

1209
01:47:47,366 --> 01:47:49,167
And you have so much love

1210
01:47:49,366 --> 01:47:52,435
That you are restless to find it
in this world!

1211

01:48:57,033 --> 01:48:58,834
Sir, She's asking me to tell you
that Jasbir is dead!

1218

Oh! Give it to me! what a
catastrophe is this girl!

1219
01:49:02,533 --> 01:49:04,701
Are you dead? Can't you wait

1220
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,468
For you,Jassu is dead

1221
01:49:06,733 --> 01:49:08,267
Why do you call me
when you are dead?

l am neck deep in problems
people are sitting infront of me!

1223
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:11,600
Matters relating to millions

01:49:17,733 --> 01:49:18,366
She'll give the money!

1228
01:49:18,566 --> 01:49:19,433
She is not my mother!

1229
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:34,567
Madam,lt's a call from
your daughter!

1230
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:35,700
Oh! yes!

1231
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:42,067
l am Jasbir calling!

1232
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:45,001
Arey! Maid! You said it was
my daughter's call!

1233
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:45,833
But,this is Jasbir's call!

1234
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:48,201
l am at Home,why will l
call you in a telephone?

1235
01:49:48,733 --> 01:49:51,368
Mother,l need milk urgently,
l have to go for a Game!

1236
01:49:52,199 --> 01:49:53,367
She'll definitely ask for money

1237
01:49:54,933 --> 01:49:56,401
Yes! What's the matter?

1238
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,301
Shall l come Home
for sometime?

1239
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,868
lt will be better if you stay with
your colourful friends!

1240
01:50:01,433 --> 01:50:03,735
l don't want your bad influence
on my children!

1241
01:50:04,199 --> 01:50:06,335
Anything special on this day,you're
showing so much of love

1242
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,402
l never loved you nor
will l ever love you!

1243
01:50:09,933 --> 01:50:11,567
But Daddy told me to
call you!

1244
01:50:11,899 --> 01:50:14,002
lf you want money,call me

1245
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,934
Witch! My mother!

1246
01:50:17,866 --> 01:50:19,834
Jasbir! Are you calling your mother
even aRer my presence here?

1247
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,433
Let's have it once!

1248
01:50:28,933 --> 01:50:32,136
From to-day,you'll call me Janice
not Jasbir!

1249
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:36,568
My real mother was no better!

1250
01:50:37,633 --> 01:50:42,104
But in that party,l felt that her
Iong nails pierced into my body!

1251
01:50:46,533 --> 01:50:48,368
l ran to Dad's Office!

1252
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,567
There was no one in
the Office!

1253
01:50:52,066 --> 01:50:56,403
My eyes fell on the safe!the
key bunch was hanging there!

1254
01:50:57,966 --> 01:51:01,302
l opened the safe! There was
Iot of money!

1255
01:51:02,333 --> 01:51:04,401
l just took $ 5000!!

1256
01:51:05,066 --> 01:51:07,234
And leR a note to
my father!

1257
01:51:07,899 --> 01:51:14,006
From that day it's been
travelling all the time!

1258
01:51:14,966 --> 01:51:16,133
Which places did you visit
in that period?

1259
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:23,234
...And now here!

1260
01:51:23,533 --> 01:51:24,667
Don't you want to return
back Home?

1261
01:51:25,133 --> 01:51:26,868
l hate Home!

1262
01:51:27,666 --> 01:51:29,501
Back to Mother!!
Back to Daddy!!

1263
01:51:30,533 --> 01:51:32,201
l hate them also!

1264
01:51:32,766 --> 01:51:35,668
But,the word'Hatred' isn't there
in your dictionary!

1265
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:40,236
From that'Hatred'only this much of love
had generated for this world!

1266
01:51:43,466 --> 01:51:45,234
Are you getting remembrances of
earlier times?...

1267
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:46,800
About your Home!....

1268
01:51:48,033 --> 01:51:49,100
16 years back....

1269
01:51:50,033 --> 01:51:52,335
No,l don't remember anything of
my earlier life!

1270
01:51:53,366 --> 01:51:55,000
l had lost my memory!

1271
01:51:55,533 --> 01:51:57,101
Any relations?!

1272
01:51:57,666 --> 01:51:59,334
These are my relations

1273
01:52:00,633 --> 01:52:01,967
They are everything
to me!

1274
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,100
Any brother?!

1275
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,334
He died very young!

1276
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,768
Jasbir! Your brother is alive!

1277
01:52:10,533 --> 01:52:11,967
l am not Jasbir!

1278
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:34,168
My Office has been raided! A diary
has been confiscated!

1279
01:52:34,366 --> 01:52:35,667
ln which your name is
also mentioned!

1280
01:52:41,866 --> 01:52:44,101
l have arranged for
everything!

1281
01:52:44,899 --> 01:52:48,169
Your tormentor is sitting with Janice
for the past 2 hours!

1282
01:52:48,933 --> 01:52:51,068
And Janice is in
her elements!

1283
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,769
l feel they have a previous
connections!

1284
01:52:55,033 --> 01:52:57,068
May be,her long lost Brother!

1285
01:52:57,399 --> 01:52:57,767
Brother!?!

1286
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,001
This one is also a stolen idol
from some Temple!

1287
01:53:05,666 --> 01:53:09,169
l swear on God,my Mother
my Husband!

1288
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:11,000
l am innocent,Mr.Prashant is
innocent!

1289
01:53:11,366 --> 01:53:13,000
We are not aware of anything
about this!

1290
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,134
l am seeing this here for
the first time!

1291
01:53:15,333 --> 01:53:16,333
Please believe me!

1292
01:53:16,633 --> 01:53:19,135
Mr.lnspector believe whatever
she's saying!

1293
01:53:19,533 --> 01:53:21,701
l am totally confused!

1294
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:24,569
All that l know about
Prashant is that...

1295
01:53:24,766 --> 01:53:25,967
lf my daughter has
married him-

1296
01:53:26,166 --> 01:53:27,500
She would have done it aRer
giving a great thought!

1297
01:53:27,699 --> 01:53:30,436
Then,Mother! Do you also doubt
that Prashant is a thief!

1298
01:54:58,466 --> 01:55:00,334
My flower had fallen
some where here!!

1299
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,568
Remember Montreal Janice!

1300
01:55:28,466 --> 01:55:30,668
How much you hated to wear
the Spectacles

1301
01:55:31,399 --> 01:55:33,368
Every one was teasing you in
the School...and....

1302
01:55:34,533 --> 01:55:36,868
l once said,why don't you take
off and throw it?

1303
01:55:37,633 --> 01:55:40,736
Not one,but you have to place all the
flowers of Kathmandu in her lap!

1304
01:55:41,166 --> 01:55:42,166
Only then,you can get her!

1305
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:44,967
That too new flowers
not the old ones!

1306
01:55:45,166 --> 01:55:46,834
She'll fall for new ones only!

1307
01:55:53,133 --> 01:55:55,602
Later on with Shanti
first sit with Janice!'

1308
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:58,669
Go,she's asking for flowers from you
go and sleep in her lap!

1309
01:55:59,166 --> 01:56:01,001
Deepak,is your death
calling you?

1310
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,335
Yes! But l'll kill you!

1311
01:57:51,366 --> 01:57:54,502
Nobody should come in between me
and Janice,l'll kill him!

1312
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:40,768
Deepak! Why did you
both fight?

1313
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:07,537
Shanti! Forgive me! For leaving you
alone and coming here!

1314
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:11,335
Don't mistake me,l want to
tell you everything!

1315
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:15,801
Where have you kept that
Golden Idol?

1316
01:59:17,033 --> 01:59:17,500
What?

1317
01:59:18,199 --> 01:59:19,668
Where have you kept that
Golden idol?

1318
01:59:21,066 --> 01:59:23,768
Golden Idol?! What are you
trying to tell me?

1319
01:59:25,033 --> 01:59:26,868
That idol which you stole
from Suyambu!

1320
01:59:28,233 --> 01:59:30,401
l am totally confused,what are
you trying to tell me?

1321
01:59:35,399 --> 01:59:38,236
Forgive me! l too don't know
what l am saying?

1322
01:59:38,433 --> 01:59:40,735
l am unable to understand
what's happening?

1323
01:59:43,233 --> 01:59:44,901
lt's good that you are not
able to understand!

1324
01:59:45,866 --> 01:59:48,835
ln my heart,l had vowed to
share only happiness with you!

1325
01:59:49,433 --> 01:59:53,069
l haven't given myself the permission
to make you sad with my sorrows!

1326
01:59:54,133 --> 01:59:55,767
lf you don't want to share your
sorrows with me!

1327
01:59:56,166 --> 01:59:58,134
Then,why did you give me
the position of your wife?

1328
01:59:58,866 --> 01:59:59,333
Then,listen!

1329
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:02,335
The sorrows which you undeMrent
on seeing me with a girl!

1330
02:00:02,733 --> 02:00:03,500
She is my sister!

1331
02:00:04,766 --> 02:00:05,233
Sister!?!

1332
02:00:06,933 --> 02:00:08,334
She was separated years back!

1333
02:00:08,533 --> 02:00:10,401
Lost! And she's refusing
to recognise!

1334
02:00:11,533 --> 02:00:13,735
l don't know whether,l'll get
her back or not?

1335
02:00:15,033 --> 02:00:17,268
lf l try to make her remember
she turns her back to me!

1336
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:19,835
When l leR her she was
a child of 8 years!

1337
02:00:20,833 --> 02:00:24,336
And she believes that she has
no brother,once she had!

1338
02:00:25,666 --> 02:00:26,266
Who's dead!

1339
02:00:26,966 --> 02:00:28,367
How to believe you?

1340
02:00:28,866 --> 02:00:32,769
l told you before God,holding your
hands to believe me life long!

1341
02:00:33,266 --> 02:00:34,934
Shanti! Has your belief had such
a premature death?

1342
02:00:35,133 --> 02:00:36,133
Whom shall l accuse?

1343
02:00:36,433 --> 02:00:39,235
You have been accused of stealing
the God's Idol?

1344
02:00:40,966 --> 02:00:41,433
What?

1345
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,703
Our house had been raided and
a stolen Idol was found!

1346
02:00:57,666 --> 02:01:00,802
Mr.Shastri! Just now,Shanti's
house has been searched!

1347
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,968
And they have got a lot of things
stolen from the Temple!

1348
02:01:03,166 --> 02:01:04,000
Then,have they found the
stolen Idol?

1349
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:07,202
Not that one,but they
found another one!

1350
02:01:08,466 --> 02:01:10,768
lts obvious that who has stolen this
would have stolen that also?

1351
02:01:10,966 --> 02:01:11,333
Who's that?

1352
02:01:11,533 --> 02:01:13,301
Mr.Shastri,who else can it
be other than Prashant?

1353
02:01:13,533 --> 02:01:17,169
He has trapped Shanti and
married her also

1354
02:01:18,033 --> 02:01:19,667
From the day this man came
to Kathmandu!

1355
02:01:20,133 --> 02:01:22,368
He has disturbed the
peace of this city!

1356
02:01:22,866 --> 02:01:25,335
Neither you are peaceful,Deepak
nor you Janice!

1357
02:01:26,033 --> 02:01:28,835
There he has trapped Shanti
and married her

1358
02:01:29,033 --> 02:01:30,401
And here he is aRer Janice!

1359
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:35,270
He is behind the great confusion
today at the Suyambu!

1360
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:39,503
lt wouldn't be surprising if anyone
of us are accused for it!

1361
02:01:39,866 --> 02:01:43,236
On you! On you! On you!...
On me...may be on you Micheal!

1362
02:01:43,866 --> 02:01:49,238
That's why! Beware and don't allow
him into your fold!

1363
02:01:49,733 --> 02:01:52,469
Don't complain aReMrards that
Drona didn't warn you!

1364
02:01:52,866 --> 02:01:54,667
Mr.Drona is telling the
absolute truth!

1365
02:01:55,733 --> 02:01:58,035
lf he comes now,he'll not
escape safely from here!

1366
02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:00,300
Now,he went aRer
getting beaten!

1367
02:02:00,699 --> 02:02:04,036
But next time each one of us will
take revenge on him!

1368
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,167
l'll not leave him alive!

1369
02:02:07,333 --> 02:02:08,367
No,Deepak,no!..

1370
02:02:09,333 --> 02:02:11,334
The thief who stole the Idol has
committed a grave sin!

1371
02:02:11,533 --> 02:02:13,167
God will never forgive him!

1372
02:02:13,733 --> 02:02:16,502
But accusing an innocent is
also a grave sin!

1373
02:02:17,333 --> 02:02:22,504
Somehow,l'll repent for those who
accused Mr.Prashant

1374
02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:25,335
Your repentence will be
Ieave him!

1375
02:02:28,733 --> 02:02:31,168
We'll never allow people from
other places!

1376
02:02:31,399 --> 02:02:36,371
And you have married a man who
steals Idols and sells them!

1377
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:37,967
How can you say that?

1378
02:02:38,666 --> 02:02:43,170
Then,will he steal to keep them
in showcase of his home!

1379
02:02:43,733 --> 02:02:47,503
This tourist is an orphan! And the Police too
know who this tourist is?

1380
02:02:47,733 --> 02:02:48,700
No....No...its false!

1381
02:02:49,066 --> 02:02:52,035
He has trapped Shanti into
his web to cover up!

1382
02:02:52,266 --> 02:02:54,635
He should be thrown out of
this City!

1383
02:02:54,866 --> 02:02:59,503
By misbehaving with Shanti,he has
brought disgrace to the entire City!

1384
02:03:00,066 --> 02:03:03,169
Because,Shanti is like our Sister
and daughter...

1385
02:03:03,933 --> 02:03:05,834
This marriage is unacceptable!
Improper!

1386
02:03:06,866 --> 02:03:09,835
Shanti shouldn't repent for it!
We all should repent for it!

1387
02:03:10,066 --> 02:03:11,767
The entire City should do it!

1388
02:03:12,066 --> 02:03:15,169
For him Police has raided
all our institutions!

1389
02:03:15,733 --> 02:03:20,704
That institutions! Which spread Gold and
Silver at the feet of God all the life!

1390
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:23,835
Our repentence will be to take
revenge on Prashant!

1391
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,702
For our City's sake!
For our God's sake!

1392
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:27,834
For Shanti's sake!

1393
02:03:28,199 --> 02:03:29,768
Shanti had loved such
a mean person!

1394
02:03:37,866 --> 02:03:39,701
Brother Toofan! We should
Ieave Nepal!

1395
02:03:39,933 --> 02:03:42,969
lf we can't prove accusations of
Prashant and Shanti to be false!

1396
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:44,434
l too think like that!

1397
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:46,333
The God inside me says...

1398
02:03:46,533 --> 02:03:46,966
What?

1399
02:03:47,733 --> 02:03:48,633
Come to Shanti's house!

1400
02:03:50,199 --> 02:03:53,703
What's this Shanti told about
stolen idols,temple and me?

1401
02:05:56,466 --> 02:05:59,168
This is Jasbir's letter,which she
IeR a year ago!

1402
02:06:02,399 --> 02:06:04,335
What did you give me other than
giving birth to me?

1403
02:06:04,533 --> 02:06:06,034
And that too was
an accident!

1404
02:06:06,733 --> 02:06:08,701
l got boarding school instead
of a Home!

1405
02:06:08,933 --> 02:06:10,701
And a maid servant instead
of a Mother!

1406
02:06:11,399 --> 02:06:13,435
For 3 years,l failed in
Cambridge!

1407
02:06:13,733 --> 02:06:15,167
l wasted your money!

1408
02:06:15,733 --> 02:06:18,902
l'll waste only $5000 more
which l am taking!

1409
02:06:19,733 --> 02:06:22,502
Don't remember me! Or ever
try to search me!

1410
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,835
Because,l'll never remember you!

1411
02:06:25,866 --> 02:06:27,634
l am not Jassu! Jasbir!

1412
02:06:28,733 --> 02:06:33,237
Then open the heart of Janice and
see there's a ocean of love there!

1413
02:06:33,666 --> 02:06:35,167
ln which the whole universe
could take refuge in it!

1414
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,835
And you say that,l don't
Iove you,Deepak!

1415
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,334
This was what l used
to play!

1416
02:06:51,399 --> 02:06:52,834
What were the lines?

1417
02:06:56,199 --> 02:06:57,634
Do you remember anything
aRer hearing this?

1418
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:00,702
l feel that my Jasbir is
somewhere here only very near!

1419
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,502
This is the same song,which
Prashant used to sing for her

1420
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:05,034
Yes,he's Prashant! Look!
He's standing there!

1421
02:07:07,133 --> 02:07:09,702
Why don't you go and meet him?
He's your son!

1422
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:11,500
Your's too!

1423
02:07:19,733 --> 02:07:21,501
Prashant! My son!

1424
02:07:26,066 --> 02:07:28,234
l had given you a telegram!
May be you didn't receive it!

1425
02:07:29,066 --> 02:07:30,700
Look,where have l come
in search of you?

1426
02:07:41,066 --> 02:07:42,667
Son,your mother is
also with me!

1427
02:07:46,733 --> 02:07:47,767
Mother,why are you standing
so far?

1428
02:07:56,533 --> 02:08:00,770
Son! Did you meet Jasbir?
She's is in Kathmandu!

1429
02:08:01,133 --> 02:08:02,167
Did you meet Jasbir?

1430
02:08:02,533 --> 02:08:03,700
Jasbir is dead!

1431
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:05,501
Her place has been taken
over by Janice!

1432
02:08:09,733 --> 02:08:11,234
Do you want to meet
your daughter?

1433
02:08:12,466 --> 02:08:13,834
Son! For that only we have
come so far!

1434
02:08:18,066 --> 02:08:20,435
Do you see those people
down there?

1435
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,703
Smoking Hashish,sleeping nude
in each others lap's

1436
02:08:24,933 --> 02:08:26,034
ln each others embraces!

1437
02:08:31,533 --> 02:08:34,569
There in between them,your daughter
Jasbir is also there!

1438
02:08:40,066 --> 02:08:40,833
Wearing that long frock!

1439
02:08:44,666 --> 02:08:47,035
ARer 16 yrs,she's refusing
to recognize me!

1440
02:08:49,333 --> 02:08:51,301
l am not able to recollect
which song was that?

1441
02:08:51,699 --> 02:08:53,034
But,you can't meet her!

1442
02:08:53,733 --> 02:08:55,835
Janice has reached the
other World!

1443
02:08:56,866 --> 02:08:59,835
Where she doesn't have a mother,
father a brother or a sister

1444
02:09:01,466 --> 02:09:04,769
lf your heart is aching to
see her from near!

1445
02:09:05,399 --> 02:09:08,035
l'll remember it now,make
a smack for me!

1446
02:14:36,366 --> 02:14:38,501
No,everyone stop!

1447
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,301
Don't stop them,Janice!

1448
02:14:40,666 --> 02:14:41,700
They have been inert for
a long time

1449
02:14:42,666 --> 02:14:43,767
They are inert and lost

1450
02:14:44,733 --> 02:14:46,835
Probably this is their atonement

1451
02:14:57,466 --> 02:14:59,167
Come foMrard 8 see her

1452
02:14:59,666 --> 02:15:01,434
She has lost her senses

1453
02:15:01,866 --> 02:15:04,501
She doesn't know who has come
and who has gone

1454
02:15:04,699 --> 02:15:07,369
Now its your turn,your turn
8 your turn

1455
02:15:09,466 --> 02:15:12,502
She is waiting for you to wake her
up 8 bring her to consciousness

1456
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:17,834
Come 8 see

1457
02:15:18,466 --> 02:15:20,434
They have got God on
earth itself

1458
02:15:20,733 --> 02:15:23,102
And when they will reach God,
What will be their condition

1459
02:15:23,733 --> 02:15:27,169
Get up,go to Mt.Everest
go to moon

1460
02:15:27,399 --> 02:15:28,300
Nothing will happen by
Iying here

1461
02:15:29,333 --> 02:15:33,336
Singing under the influence of Opium
smack and hashish

1462
02:15:33,533 --> 02:15:34,634
Nothing will happen

1463
02:15:35,199 --> 02:15:37,168
lf this is devotion
8 this God

1464
02:15:37,533 --> 02:15:41,169
HARE MM HARE KRISHNA that you
are chanting

1465
02:15:41,466 --> 02:15:43,501
Then throw away
these rosaries

1466
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,235
Float these flowers in the river
Bagmati's stream -

1467
02:15:46,466 --> 02:15:47,233
They'll look more
beautiful there

1468
02:15:47,533 --> 02:15:48,834
Tear him apart

1469
02:15:49,133 --> 02:15:50,767
He has stolen Temple Idols

1470
02:15:51,133 --> 02:15:53,568
Because of him our Houses
were searched

1471
02:15:53,933 --> 02:15:55,834
Because of him we have lost
our peace of mind

1472
02:15:56,033 --> 02:15:57,300
This is lie,this is a lie

1473
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:02,767
Save him!!

1474
02:16:04,466 --> 02:16:07,368
Prashant go away from here
they'll kill you

1475
02:16:08,066 --> 02:16:10,501
l'll not leave you here
8 go Jasbir

1476
02:16:11,333 --> 02:16:12,333
See,who is there?

1477
02:16:12,666 --> 02:16:13,366
He is Daddy

1478
02:16:18,533 --> 02:16:19,500
No

1479
02:16:21,666 --> 02:16:22,500
See up there

1480
02:16:22,733 --> 02:16:24,634
lt's mother,mother

1481
02:16:31,066 --> 02:16:31,433
Daughter

1482
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:34,502
No,Go away,go away
go away -

1483
02:16:35,466 --> 02:16:36,633
l don't want to see you here

1484
02:16:40,533 --> 02:16:43,569
l have no Mummy and
l have no Daddy

1485
02:17:02,066 --> 02:17:04,701
lf you won't leave him immediately
l will shoot you

1486
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:06,367
l am warning you

1487
02:17:06,733 --> 02:17:07,300
Who all are staying here?

1488
02:17:07,666 --> 02:17:10,368
First arrest the person who has
committed the theR

1489
02:17:11,066 --> 02:17:12,634
Yes,Yes

1490
02:17:23,799 --> 02:17:29,305
Here,there is a man who
walks like a lame

1491
02:17:31,733 --> 02:17:33,668
lf he is not
the thief

1492
02:17:34,466 --> 02:17:39,971
l will stop my scanty breath
with my own hands

1493
02:17:40,866 --> 02:17:47,505
He 8 sister Janice has committed
this theR

1494
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:49,168
Janice is his
sister

1495
02:17:50,333 --> 02:17:53,169
Both of them came to Khatmandu
for this purpose only

1496
02:17:53,366 --> 02:17:55,634
And they met each other
stealthily

1497
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:59,503
And outwardly they were
play acting

1498
02:18:02,399 --> 02:18:03,634
Arrest him immediately,sir!

1499
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:05,700
What is your name?

1500
02:18:10,133 --> 02:18:13,169
How can you say that he 8 sister
have committed the theR

1501
02:18:13,733 --> 02:18:15,701
Because l know where his
sister stays

1502
02:18:15,933 --> 02:18:17,301
Sir,you search
her room

1503
02:18:18,533 --> 02:18:20,635
Search his room along with
that Sir

1504
02:18:26,133 --> 02:18:27,567
Nothing is found in the room
of Janice

1505
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,434
This is the Idol that was stolen from
Suyambhu

1506
02:18:34,666 --> 02:18:35,500
lt was found in
Michels's room

1507
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:40,301
How did this happen?

1508
02:18:41,333 --> 02:18:43,835
Probably it reached your room
by magic

1509
02:18:46,666 --> 02:18:49,101
As you sow,so you reap
Michel

1510
02:18:49,733 --> 02:18:51,835
And the Idol that was found in
Shanti's house -

1511
02:18:52,033 --> 02:18:52,967
Who will reply to that?!

1512
02:18:53,399 --> 02:18:55,702
Perhaps Mr.Drona will reply
to it

1513
02:18:55,933 --> 02:18:57,701
Because Mr.Drona's silk
handkerchief -

1514
02:18:57,933 --> 02:19:00,335
Was found in the same room where
the Idol was found

1515
02:19:00,533 --> 02:19:00,833
His name is embossed
on it

1516
02:19:02,466 --> 02:19:02,632
Prashant,my brother

1517
02:19:02,866 --> 02:19:04,701
When Mr.Drona went to meet
Shanti's mother

1518
02:19:04,933 --> 02:19:06,968
By mistake he leR this
also there

1519
02:19:07,333 --> 02:19:07,833
This is play acting

1520
02:19:08,033 --> 02:19:11,169
lt is play acting or truth it'll
be known by your finger prints

1521
02:19:11,366 --> 02:19:12,433
Arrest him

1522
02:19:12,733 --> 02:19:15,502
Not only me but Mr.Drona has
also to be arrested

1523
02:19:15,733 --> 02:19:18,702
Because till date whatever l have
done was under his orders -

1524
02:19:18,933 --> 02:19:19,767
With his concurrence

1525
02:19:20,333 --> 02:19:21,367
lt's all a lie

1526
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,801
Court will decide
about it

1527
02:19:24,733 --> 02:19:27,502
This diary that was confiscated from
your house is a proof

1528
02:19:28,733 --> 02:19:32,503
There is long list of your
foreign friends in it Mr.Drona

1529
02:19:33,466 --> 02:19:36,168
To whom many Idols from our
temples were sold

1530
02:19:36,733 --> 02:19:37,700
Arrest him also

1531
02:19:38,533 --> 02:19:42,837
Drona's friends may become his
enemies 8 help you

1532
02:19:43,066 --> 02:19:44,967
But Drona will never become
his own enemy

1533
02:19:45,533 --> 02:19:49,503
Drona will never surrender
to the police,never

1534
02:20:16,133 --> 02:20:17,567
Daddy both of you
meet Janice

1535
02:20:52,466 --> 02:20:54,501
What did you give me
except birth

1536
02:20:55,466 --> 02:20:57,501
What did you give me
except birth

1537
02:20:58,066 --> 02:21:00,368
What did you give me
except birth

1538
02:21:03,066 --> 02:21:05,168
l was pining for brother
for my whole life

1539
02:21:05,733 --> 02:21:06,834
When l met my brother

1540
02:21:07,466 --> 02:21:11,169
lt was too late Prashant

1541
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:13,834
lt's full darkness

1542
02:21:14,866 --> 02:21:17,368
And l won't be able to see
you in this darkness

1543
02:21:18,399 --> 02:21:19,834
l am going in the light

1544
02:21:20,866 --> 02:21:22,234
Keep on remembering me

1545
02:21:22,733 --> 02:21:25,168
And never stop loving me

1546
02:21:25,866 --> 02:21:30,837
l have loved you too much and
l'll always love you

1547
02:21:31,066 --> 02:21:35,036
Because where l am going
there is only love

1548
02:21:36,466 --> 02:21:40,303
''MM KRISHNA''
