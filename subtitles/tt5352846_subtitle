1
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,029
What time did you get
in last night?

2
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,464
Late.

3
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,900
You were snoring.

4
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,535
Hmm.

5
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,937
I don't snore.

6
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,905
You do when you're stressed.

7
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,412
He goes back to school today.

8
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,620
They'll catch who did it.

9
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,724
He could have been killed.

10
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,330
Probably some stoned kids
being stupid with daddy's gun.

11
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:39,471
Looks good to me.

12
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,373
It's tragic.

13
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,110
I don't know when that happened.

14
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,611
Oh well.

15
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,979
Hey.

16
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,050
Don't worry.

17
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,020
I'll talk to him today.

18
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,022
I wish he'd talk to me.

19
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,625
He's been so quiet.

20
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,362
Teenagers don't talk
to their parents.

21
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,063
They have a code of silence.

22
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,401
He'll be fine.

23
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,981
<i>Last call for flight 306...</i>

24
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,835
Hey bud, you awake in there?

25
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:57,702
Funny.

26
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,704
Funny, dad.

27
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:07,679
Hey, uh... so, is gramps
gonna have a open casket?

28
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,814
Closed casket.

29
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,083
Why don't we just roast him?

30
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,819
Oh, that's lovely.

31
00:09:14,821 --> 00:18:29,640
It's called cremation.

32
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:20,058
And no, he's going to be buried
next to your grandmother.

33
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,929
I think that gramps would
like to have a viking funeral.

34
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,030
Viking?

35
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,631
Yeah.

36
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,099
I mean, he loved that stuff.

37
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,269
Like, you just, like,
put him on his boat and...

38
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,104
And light it on fire and,
you know,

39
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,607
send it out into the ocean.

40
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,676
Hey, there's an idea.

41
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,198
That's one way to get rid of
your boat.

42
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,150
Hey, drive him to school today?

43
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,719
I was planning on it.

44
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,853
Love you.

45
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:49,854
Love you too.

46
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:50,722
You working late?

47
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,357
I hope not.

48
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,593
You need to start thinking
about that eulogy.

49
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,227
I know, I will.

50
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,931
I'm ready when you are.

51
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,333
Oh, shit.

52
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,203
Dad, it-it doesn't matter,
really.

53
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Dad, come on.

54
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,108
Alright.

55
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:57,048
I have an idea.
What if I kept the boat?

56
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,084
Yeah, why not?

57
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,186
You live in the boat and I use
your bedroom as

58
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,722
my second office.
Fine with me.

59
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,989
I'm joking.

60
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,925
Come on, we're gonna be late.

61
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,751
You OK?

62
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,153
Yeah.

63
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,988
See you later.

64
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,458
Hey, uh...

65
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,795
Anytime you wanna talk,
we're here for you.

66
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,330
OK, bud?

67
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,165
Yeah, I know.

68
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,500
Thanks.

69
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,435
Thanks, dad.

70
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,272
See ya later-

71
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,948

75
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,493
We're ten clicks away.

00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,188
<i>Badger, target has picked up

77
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,289
Wait a sec.

78
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,058
Shit.

79
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,495
Tower one, badger,
we lost the link.

80
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,664
<i>Badger. Tower one, abort?</i>

81
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,499
Negative, tower one.

82
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,102
Third time this month.
Every time I'm back...

83
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,016
Re-acquiring a link.

84
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,751
It's gonna be tight.

85
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,773
Tower one, badger,
we're back up.

86
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,816

Targeting.

90
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,208
Target locked and we are
on the straightaway.

91
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,343
Tower one, badger,
are we clear to fire?

92

00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,481
<i>You are clear to fire.

00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,118
Three, two, one.

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,653
Rifle.

96
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,658
Impact in ten seconds.

97
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,759
Holding target.

98
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,598
Five, four, three, two...

99
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,375
Splat.

100
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,744
Tower one, badger,
partial hit on target.

101
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,513
Confirming kill.

102
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,754
Wait, I think-I think
I see movement.

103
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,897
Wow, would you look at that.

104
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,834
That's one tough dune coon.

105
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,337
Tower one, badger,
kill is not confirmed.

106
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,405
Repeat, kill is not confirmed.

107
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,242

second hellfire. Over.

108
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,343
<i>Affirmative, badger.</i>

109
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,277
10-4.

110
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,445
Still locked.

111
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:11,549
Three, two, one.

112
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:12,617
Rifle.

113
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,934
Are you gonna be allowed out
of the house this weekend?

114
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,469
I'm busy with the funeral.

115
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,471
Oh, Christ.

116
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:36,941
I'm sorry, I forgot.

117
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,277
It's OK.

118
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,949
Have you ever written a eulogy?

119
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,951
Yeah, actually I have.

120
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,353
For my uncle stu's funeral.

121
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,689
It did not go well.

122
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,858
Why, what happened?

123
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,860
I don't-just-OK.

124
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:59,430
He was kind of a miserable guy
and, you know, he took it out

125
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,299
on his wife and his kids
and everybody,

126
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,467
including me, so I said fuck it,

127
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,570
I just got up there
and told it like it was.

128
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,271
It was fucking hilarious.

129
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,673
So...

130
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,647
Were you born an asshole, Gary?

131
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,749
Quite possibly, yeah.

132
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,750
Look, you're gonna be fine.

133
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,752
Your dad was a stand up guy.

134
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,890
Yeah, but how do you condense
a man's entire life

135
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,626
into five minutes? Huh?

136
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,861
There's probably an app
for that, right?

137
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,598
You, like, download a template,
put in his name

138
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,633
and then boom, it writes it
for you?

139
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,602
Might even give the speech
for you, huh?

140
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,769
Great, thanks.

141
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,870
I don't know, ask Ellen.

142
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,405
Women are good at
this kind of shit.

143
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,773
She's doing too much already.

144
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,475
Well, don't ask a guy.

145
00:20:44,477 --> 00:41:28,952
You know?

146
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,944
We-we bury that shit for,
like, 20 years

147
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,447
and then deal with it
in therapy later.

148
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,518
<i>- Guess what.
- What?</i>

149
00:20:54,520 --> 00:41:49,038
Hey.

150
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,657
We're opening a new office,
right on Campbell street.

151
00:20:59,659 --> 00:41:59,316
Really?

152
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,493
Yeah, right next to the college.

153
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,362
Think about how good our
lunch dates would be then.

154
00:21:04,364 --> 00:42:08,726
Yeah, I think our...

155
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:08,366
Our lunch dates are working
pretty good right now.

156
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,470
I've been thinking.

157
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,771
What?

158
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,673
How about a weekend away?

159
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,308
It can be a work thing. Right?

160
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,510
Like a conference or a workshop.

161
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,945
Whatever you want.

162
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,282
I don't know.

163
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,416
What do you mean,
you don't know?

164
00:21:25,418 --> 00:42:50,834
I don't know.

165
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,785
Either we have something
or we don't.

166
00:21:27,787 --> 00:42:55,572
Of course we do, Ted,

167
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,988
but a weekend away is a whole...

168
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,557
Wake up next to me, Ellen.

169
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,562
Spend an entire day with me.

170
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,798
I thought we agreed no pressure.

171
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,966
Right?

172
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,836
I mean... that was sort
of the deal.

173
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,440
Yeah, that was the deal.

174
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:53,010
That was also three months ago.

175
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,312
Ted...

176
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,448
Ted.

177
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,692
Ted!

178
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,759
Hey, Ted!

179
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:09,593
You were very clear.

180
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,696
Come on, please.

181
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,364
Ted, come on.

182
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,569
Please, don't be mad.

183
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:22,106
Promise me you'll think
about it.

184
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,008
I'll think about it.

185
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,043
I promise.

00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,520
<i>We believe that these government
personnel have been put</i>

191
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,622
<i>at potential risk
because their names have</i>

192
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,558

Oh, oh...

198
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,720
Woah!

199
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,822
Don't hit the slide, guys.

200
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,991
Oh, here we go.

201
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,427
<i>Remember my rule,
no hitting the bench.</i>

202
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,828
<i>Let's go!</i>

203
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,430
<i>OK.</i>

204
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,505
I got it, I got it.

205
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,977
There you go.

206
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,846
Alright yeah-

207
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:09,713
throw strong.

208
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,081
Come on, son.

209
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,851
Yeah, alright.

210
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,052
Let's do this.

211
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,723
I haven't seen you around
here before.

212
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,725
I'm... I'm visiting.

213
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:22,827
Visiting, huh?

214
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,462
Yes.

215
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,564
So, you waiting for someone,
or...?

216
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,731
Yes.

217
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,233
You're meeting them here?

218
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,869
No, I'm just enjoying
the sunshine.

219
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,004
It's a lovely day.

220
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,006
Hey, come on,
remember what I said?

221
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,575
Catch it with your hand.

222
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:38,943
Geez. I tell ya.

223
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,717
It's a park for kids, mister.

224
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,752
I like it here.

225
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,154
I like to watch
the children playing

226
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,256
with their mothers and fathers.

227
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,595
Right.

228
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,530
News flash, buddy.

229
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:02,733
In this country
we don't like strangers

230
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,802
watching our kids.

231
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,239
Especially strangers like you.

232
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,541
So why don't you get lost?

233
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:14,912
Why don't you go to a mosque and
read that little book of yours?

234
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,085
I meant no offense.

235
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,888
Well, I'm offended. OK?

236
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,589
So beat it.

237
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,236
Sorry if I ruined your day.

238
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,539
Any time now.

239
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:46,003
<i>"Confirm visual, I repeat,
confirm visual.</i>

240
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,127
Hey.

241
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,229
You OK?

242
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,998
Yeah.

243
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,403
I thought you were gonna
be here earlier.

244
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,439
Yeah, traffic was a bitch.

245
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,946
You uh... can have
the dresser.

246
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,047
Catch.

247
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,494
How's the eulogy coming?

248
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:55,132
Harder than I thought.

249
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,066
You want me to write it?

250
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,135
No.

251
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,437
No, I said I would and I will.

252
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,020
He dropped bombs on Hitler.

253
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:20,224
Yet he died barely able
to hold a crayon.

254
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,831
I'm not ending up in
a place like this.

255
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,901
There's no guarantees in life,
big brother.

256
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:34,905
Hey, if I end up talking
to the walls, you shoot me.

257
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,007
I mean it.

258
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,976
Hey, did you see this?

259
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,881
Charlie gave it to me.

260
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,416
He was saying how Shane would
visit a couple times a week.

261
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,121
You raised a good kid.

262
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,556
Huh.

263
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,893
I'm surprised he found the time.

264
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,227
You didn't know he visited pops?

265
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,496
Sure, I knew.

266
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:03,967
I just didn't think he visited
that often.

267
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,936
You sure didn't.

268
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,404
Hey.

269
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,840
Neither did you.

270
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,341
Yeah.

271
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,510
Well, I guess we both dropped
the ball there.

272
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,051
Listen, I know we don't talk
a lot,

273
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:24,188
but I just want you to know that
I'm here for you.

274
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,930
And I'm here for you.

275
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:36,500
That's what dad
would have wanted.

276
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:40,470
Come on, give your
little brother a hug.

277
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,472
Come on.

278
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,011
Come here.

279
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,093
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

280
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,262
I'll take care of it.

281
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,096
You sure?

282
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,233
Yeah, I'm sure.

283
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,367
Yeah.

284
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,291
Hey.

285
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,493
<i>Yeah?</i>

286
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,332
<i>Hey, dad.</i>

287
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,769
How was school?

288
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,637
It was OK.

289
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,307
Any updates?

290
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,475
Nope.

291
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,448
What game are you playing?

292
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,118
Um, bullet catcher iv.

293
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,690
I uh, I saw your uncle today-

294
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,192
dad, uh, do you mind?

295
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:25,595
I'm online here
with a couple players.

296
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,435
Sure.

297
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,276
What?

298
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,646
I... nothing.

299
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,744
Shit.

300
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,473
Can I help you?

301
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,580
I said, can I help you?

302
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:29,452
I was, uh, I was passing by
and I saw the sign.

303
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:32,455
Oh yeah?

304
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,524
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to intrude.

305
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,728
Are you really interested?

306
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,605
Yes.

307
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,675
I am interested.

308
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:55,879
I... I put an ad online,
must have been a month ago.

309
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,315
To be honest, I forgot the sign
was still there.

310
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:01,218
Yes, I uh, I read
the ad actually.

311
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,285
Great.

312
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,655
Want a closer look?

313
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,490
Please.

314
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,362
"Amazing...

315
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,463
Grace.

316
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,231
Grace.

317
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,465
Grace.

318
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,003
"Amazing grace".

319
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:32,549
Are you a sailor that keeps
the name of the boat?

320
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:37,020
Amazing grace is a perfect name.

321
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:39,789
If I buy this I will
re-paint it.

322
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,897
May I ask why you're selling it?

323
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:51,668
When my father couldn't
manage it on his own anymore

324
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,337
he gave it to me.

325
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,373
He's a generous man.

326
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,274
He was.

327
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,842
He passed away recently.

328
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,681
The cabin is in good shape.

329
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:08,285
<i>There's beautiful mahogany
wood down below.</i>

330
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,887
She's much faster
than you would expect.

331
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:18,328
So uh, one day you just decided
to jump into the deep end?

332
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:20,064
The deep end?

333
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:25,568
Yeah, looking at buying a boat
like this, you know?

334
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,438
Out of-out of the blue?

335
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,841
It was a boat from the blue,
yes.

336
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,681
Well, uh, just so you know
I'm asking 16-

337
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,716
16,000

338
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,017
$16,000?

339
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,586
Yes, $16,000.

340
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:47,324
Are you firm on that price?

341
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:50,460
What do you have in mind?

342
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:53,029
Perhaps we can sit down

343
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:57,600
and discuss a price
that works for both of us?

344
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:00,570
Yeah, why not?

345
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,772
I'm Neil Wiston, by the way.

346
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,642
Imir.

347
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,610
Shah.

348
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,350
<i>Beth, Ted's been calling every 20
minutes, I don't know what to do.</i>

349
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,351
<i>A weekend away?</i>

350
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:15,885
<i>We're talking serious risk.</i>

351
00:39:15,887 --> 01:18:31,772
<i>Right.</i>

352
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:19,389
I know, but I think I'll lose
him if I don't go.

353
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,458
<i>And that doesn't set off
warning bells?</i>

354
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,492
OK, I got it.

355
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,361
You don't think I should go.

356
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,862
<i>Honey, listen to me.</i>

357
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,864
<i>Right now you and Ted
have a thing.</i>

358
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,632
<i>If you go away with him,
it's not a thing anymore.</i>

359
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,501
<i>It's a different thing.</i>

360
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:34,604
<i>Don't go down that road
unless you're absolutely sure.</i>

361
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,044
<i>Are you there?</i>

362
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,779
Yeah.

363
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,919
<i>Ellen, are you OK?</i>

364
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,088
<i>Hey!</i>

365
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,923
<i>Hey!</i>

366
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:54,924
<i>Come here!</i>

367
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,926
<i>Get back here!</i>

368
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,528
You get back here!

369
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,663
You little fuckers!

370
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,532
No...!!

371
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:03,900
Hey!

372
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:12,909
Oh my god.

373
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,946
Beer?

374
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,915
Thank you.

375
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,085
I wasn't sure if uh, alcohol
was allowed.

376
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,720
Haram.

377
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,822
Haram, right.

378
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:28,691
And it's been a long time
since I was in a mosque.

379
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,728
Oh, so you're not a-
you're not a practicing-

380
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,431
uh, not a practicing one, no.

381
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,598
Ah.

382
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,706
This must be your son.

383
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,810
That's him. That's Shane.

384
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,812
How old?

385
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,080
16. Smart kid.

386
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,582
Takes after his dad.

387
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,223
May I ask what you do
for a living?

388
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:01,991
I'm in it.

389
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,862
Um, computers.

390
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,864
Jesus Christ, my laptop!

391
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,842
Shit.

392
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,144
I hope this wasn't my doing.

393
00:41:21,146 --> 01:22:42,290
No, no.

394
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:27,750
I'm uh, trying to write
my father's eulogy.

395
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,886
It's driving me crazy.

396
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:32,655
Were you and your father close?

397
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,259
Yeah, I like to think so.

398
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,928
I need a good opening.

399
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,633
Once I get that, then
the rest will follow.

400
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:46,736
Maybe you should start
with a childhood memory.

401
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,071
Speak to who your father was,

402
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:51,140
not what he accomplished
in his life.

403
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:54,644
Oh, I got plenty of
sailing stories.

404
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:57,881
My brother Dave and I spent
every weekend on the boat

405
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,549
when we were kids.

406
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,186
There. You've got your opening.

407
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,055
May I make another suggestion?

408
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,123
Sure.

409
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,895
In my humble opinion,

410
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:14,964
allow the story of your father
to have true meaning.

411
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,936
True meaning?

412
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:24,240
I was taught the dead live on
in three ways.

413
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,942
Through their good deeds,

414
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,545
through the charity other
people give in their name

415
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,947
and, most important,

416
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,882
through the knowledge they
leave behind in this world

417
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,784
that benefits others.

418
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:42,325
Wow, that's beautiful.

419
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:43,793
Thank you.

420
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,798
I hope I was helpful.

421
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,266
Yeah, you were.

422
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,006
My wife, I uh, I gotta give her
a hand.

423
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:57,840
Do you mind?

424
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:59,075
Of course.

425
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,360
What happened?

426
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:18,294
<i>Baseball.</i>

427
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,362
<i>Kids.</i>

428
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,630
Jesus.
<i>I know.</i>

429
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:21,164
You OK?

430
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,865
Yeah, I'm fine.

431
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:23,866
You should have called me.

432
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,635
I'm fine, really.

433
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,005
Hey.

434
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,607
Hello.

435
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:33,876
I'm imir shah.

436
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:35,645
Um, you must be Shane.

437
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:36,713
Yeah.

438
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,983
Um... my dad around, or...?

439
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,619
Yes, um, he's outside.

440
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,888
Greeting your mother.

441
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:50,360
I'm here to talk about
buying the boat.

442
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:52,261
That was my granddad's boat.

443
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,297
I know.

444
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,866
You sure you wanna buy it?

445
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,901
You don't think I should?

446
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:02,372
Well, I don't know, I mean,
it's just an old boat.

447
00:44:02,374 --> 00:44:04,340
Hope it doesn't have termites.

448
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,191
Hello.

449
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:23,826
Hi.

450
00:44:23,828 --> 01:28:47,654
Ellen, Mr. shah.

451
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,729
Mr. shah, I hear you're
interested in the boat.

452
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:29,065
I am. Please, call me imir.

453
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:30,400
It's nice to meet you, imir.
Pleasure.

454
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:32,168
I'm just gonna put these down
and grab a drink.

455
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,903
Would you like something?
No, thank you.

456
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,672
He already has a beer.

457
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,675
I also have real masala
chai tea, if you'd rather.

458
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,109
That sounds lovely,
thank you, Ellen.

459
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,978
Great. Sure.

460
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,945
Do you need a hand?

461
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,213
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

462
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,854
You really do have
a beautiful home.

463
00:44:51,856 --> 01:29:43,710
Thank you.

464
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:55,925
Yeah, we're uh,
we're working on it.

465
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:58,094
You're coming home from work,
is that right?

466
00:44:58,096 --> 00:44:59,395
Yeah.

467
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,699
She teaches at the uh,
community college.

468
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,967
What do you teach?

469
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,837
I teach, um, comparative
cultures.

470
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,806
You're an anthropology teacher.

471
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:11,474
Ethnology, actually.

472
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,376
You must have read Levi Strauss.

473
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,977
You know his work?

474
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,846
I was under the impression
his ideas were central

475
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,748
to ethnological methodology.

476
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,982
Well, in structuralism, yeah.

477
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:21,117
A bit out of fashion these days.

478
00:45:21,119 --> 01:30:42,236
Why, are you an-

479
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,221
anthropologist?
Unfortunately, no.

480
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,457
I'm a computer engineer.

481
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,392
My father threatened
to pull me out of Oxford

482
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,861
if I switched disciplines.

483
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:32,995
Oxford?

484
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,997
God, I'd love to study
at Oxford.

485
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,733
It's not nearly as glamorous
as the brochures and films

486
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:37,867
make it seem.

487
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,404
We should probably get back
to the business at hand.

488
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,339
Um, I'll take it.

489
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,509
That boat.

490
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:49,112
I accept your price.

491
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,146
Are you serious?

492
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:51,147
Yes.

493
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:52,048
What was the price?

494
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,783
Sixteen.

495
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:57,386
Great. Great.

496
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:00,790
I uh, don't want to change
your mind,

497
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:04,060
but I thought we were
gonna negotiate.

498
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,796
Well, you seem like
honest people.

499
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:09,866
I'm sure what you're asking
is a fair market price.

500
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:10,900
Thank you.

501
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:11,768
That's nice.

502
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,401
That's nice, yeah.

503
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,269
Cheers.

504
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,170
Cheers.

505
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,004
Thank you.

506
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,006
I hope you enjoy it.

507
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,318
This tea would not be
out of place

508
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,454
at a cafe in Karachi, Ellen.

509
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:32,455
It tastes like home.

510
00:46:32,457 --> 01:33:04,912
That's sweet of you.

511
00:46:32,457 --> 01:33:04,912
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

512
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:37,560
Imir's been helping me write
dad's eulogy.

513
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:39,462
Really?

514
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,930
I'm surprised he mentioned it
to you.

515
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,565
Hey, I was surprised, too.

516
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:45,968
What can I say?
Imir enlightened me.

517
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,270
What was it you said?

518
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:49,472
Start with a childhood memory?

519
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,208
Something that speaks
to who dad was,

520
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,211
not what he accomplished
in life.

521
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,445
There's my opening.

522
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,114
A sailing story.

523
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:01,317
But it's gonna have
a life lesson.

524
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,053
Something dad taught me.

525
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:05,221
OK. I got an idea.

526
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,823
Why don't you stay for supper?

527
00:47:06,825 --> 01:34:13,648
Honey, I'm sure-

528
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:08,958
we can talk some more.
- No.

529
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,893
I'm sure he's got other plans.

530
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,830
As it happens, I don't.

531
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:15,364
I would love to share a meal
with you.

532
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,465
Great. Great.

533
00:47:16,467 --> 01:34:32,932
Yeah.

534
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,501
We'll celebrate
the sale of the boat.

535
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,570
I'll fire up the Barbie.

536
00:47:20,572 --> 01:34:41,142
What do you want? Steak?

537
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:24,207
Um, actually I don't eat meat.

538
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,208
What else do we have?

539
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,009
Salmon? Do you like salmon?

540
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,311
I do, yes. Thank you.

541
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,912
Ellen?
I'll have salmon, too.

542
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:31,447
And if you're doing a steak,
do one for Shane.

543
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,182
Surf and turf it is.

544
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,174
Pearly whites.

545
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,244
A lot of money in braces.

546
00:48:01,246 --> 01:36:02,490
Hey, mom.

547
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:04,146
Oh, hey honey. This is Mr. shah.

548
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,648
He's buying our boat.

549
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,382
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,417
We met earlier.

551
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:11,153
Hey, what time's dinner?

552
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,890
It'll be ready in about
a half hour.

553
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:17,226
Cool. I'm just gonna go out
for a bit, so...

554
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:21,030
OK.

555
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:22,198
That's Shane.

556
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,567
He doesn't seem very happy,
does he?

557
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,002
Oh, I don't know.

558
00:48:26,004 --> 01:36:52,600
I think-

559
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:28,938
he has a face my teenaged
daughter would sometimes make.

560
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,009
Right, well...
Teenagers, right?

561
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,477
I mean, his grandfather
just died,

562
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,479
so that's probably part of it.

563
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:39,015
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

564
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:43,185
No, it's...

565
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:45,288
Do you mind if I use
the loo to wash my hands?

566
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,057
Oh, god, yeah sure, but the
one down here doesn't work,

567
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,325
of course. You'll have to go
upstairs.

568
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,593
It's just down the hall.

569
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,395
Thank you.

570
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,093
What's this?

571
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,635
David gave it to me.

572
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:49,605
Did you know Shane was visiting
dad twice a week?

573
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,273
No.

574
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,875
He didn't say anything.

575
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,520
I'll see you in Valhalla,
gramps!

576
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,442
Where's Shane?

577
00:53:33,444 --> 01:47:06,886
I don't know.

578
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:37,746
He said he wanted to go out
for a little bit.

579
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:40,316
I'm gonna put a tracking device
on that kid.

580
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,717
Can't you track him with GPS?

581
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,486
I hear a lot of American parents
are doing this.

582
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:47,756
Yeah, I was actually joking.

583
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:50,626
But yeah, I do know some parents

584
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:52,895
have this new tracking app.

585
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,363
Paranoid parents,
which we're not.

586
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:56,298
Don't give him any ideas,
please.

587
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,538
So where... where exactly
are you from, imir?

588
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,472
Karachi.

589
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:05,608
Mmm. The city of lights.

590
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,009
How long have you been
in the states?

591
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:07,943
I just arrived.

592
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,778
I'm starting a new contract.

593
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,779
Oh yeah? What do you do?

594
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,381
Systems integration.

595
00:54:12,383 --> 01:48:24,764
I'm a programmer.

596
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:16,518
Listen, I uh, I don't wanna
change the subject,

597
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:22,791
but maybe we could discuss how
you plan to pay for the boat.

598
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:27,296
I- I can... arrange a bank
transfer tomorrow

599
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:31,033
if that's alright.

600
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:33,269
I don't see why not.

601
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,403
Yeah. Perfect.

602
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:38,674
Hey, bud. Glad you could
make it.

603
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:40,509
Sorry, dad.

604
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:44,513
Hey, actually is it OK if I just
eat in my room?

605
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:45,814
No, that's rude. Sit down.

606
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:46,915
Neil.

607
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,908
Growing boys eat like
their limbs are empty, hmm?

608
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,612
What's the American term
for it? Chow down?

609
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,681
Yeah.

610
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:20,582
It's a... military expression.

611
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:21,317
Hmm.

612
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:22,785
For eating.

613
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,996
It's work.

614
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,698
Excuse me.

615
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,043
Yeah?

616
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,045
<i>Bad timing?</i>

617
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,480
My steak's getting cold.

618
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:53,482
What do you want?

619
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:54,583
<i>Play nice.</i>

620
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,618
I'm doing you a favour, here.

621
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,854
Security briefing at 07:00
tomorrow, OK?

622
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,023
Attendance is mandatory.

623
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,592
Security?

624
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:04,927
Why? What's up?

625
00:56:04,929 --> 01:52:09,856
<i>It's the leak.</i>

626
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:10,132
Head office is flipping the fuck
out over the gun sight videos.

627
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:11,500
Some Geneva convention bullshit

628
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:14,903
about non-military
combat missions.

629
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:17,639
How does that affect
the program?

630
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:19,975
<i>Because if the press finds out
we're contractors</i>

631
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,044
<i>they're gonna shut us down.</i>

632
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,948
It wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

633
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,684
Just... I'll see you tomorrow,
OK?

634
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,586
Yeah.

635
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,499
Sorry about that.

636
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:44,400
Was that Gary?

637
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:45,100
Yeah.

638
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,702
What'd he want?

639
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:49,505
One of the servers is down
so I'm in early tomorrow.

640
00:56:49,507 --> 01:53:39,012
What a shock.

641
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:53,041
Honestly, if we made time
and a half for all the hours

642
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,511
he works overtime we'd be rich.

643
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:58,046
It's 9-5 one day, it's graveyard
shift the next.

644
00:56:58,048 --> 00:56:59,681
It's completely crazy.

645
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:05,087
Can I be excused now?

646
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,688
You may.

647
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,725
How about I get us some dessert?
Some cheesecake, huh?

648
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,094
I've never had American
cheesecake.

649
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,996
I hear it doesn't even taste
like cheese.

650
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,534
Hey, Shane.

651
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,803
Go help your mom
with the dishes.

652
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,976
Are we saving this for anything?

653
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,978
We're gonna toast the sale
of the boat.

654
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,650
Perhaps we should include
your grandfather in the toast.

655
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,985
Yeah, I like that idea.

656
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,695
You have a big heart, imir.

657
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:49,531
If it wasn't for dad,

658
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:54,570
we wouldn't be standing here,
would we?

659
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:56,038
I suppose not.

660
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,742
Pop grove. 2012.

661
00:58:00,744 --> 01:56:01,486
That was a good year.

662
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:07,015
First and last time I won
my fantasy six football pool.

663
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:11,887
In 2012 I had been working
abroad for two years.

664
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,756
I hadn't seen my family
in all that time.

665
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,625
That's tough.

666
00:58:16,627 --> 01:56:33,252
It was.

667
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:20,496
We would video chat
but it wasn't the same.

668
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:24,166
I missed this. Family meals.

669
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:05,974
Nine hacks of classified files,
four attacks on NSA firewalls.

670
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:08,544
We should have picked him up
at the Seattle airport.

671
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:09,945
It's not my call.

672
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,081
<i>Rover, this is canary.</i>

673
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,083
<i>We have a match
in your vicinity.</i>

674
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:23,892
Hey, stop here.

675
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,802
The house belongs to
a private contractor.

676
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:35,571
He works for us.

677
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,105
Are you kidding me?

678
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,945
A toast to new friends.

679
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:46,982
To fair weather sailing
on the water and off.

680
00:59:46,984 --> 01:59:33,966
Fair weather sailing?

681
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:50,686
Hey, don't interrupt.
I'm just getting started.

682
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,854
He is not famous for his toasts.
Yeah, no kidding.

683
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:53,956
Watch out.

684
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,825
To everyone's health.

685
00:59:56,827 --> 01:00:00,062
Including financially.

686
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:04,700
And lastly, to my father.

687
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:09,605
For as long as I can remember
he loved the sea.

688
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,741
And he loved that boat.

689
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:19,014
Imir, we're passing on a piece
of Wiston family history to you,

690
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:20,882
and I know we've only just met

691
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:24,853
but I think my dad
would approve.

692
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:27,889
Because you're a good man.

693
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:29,925
Thank you. I am honored.

694
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:30,659
Cheers.

695
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:32,060
Cheers.

696
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:33,795
Cheers, everyone.

697
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,097
Cheers.

698
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,870
Why don't you give me
your plate.

699
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:46,742
So imir, it must be so hard
to be away from home, huh?

700
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:48,910
When do you get to see
your family again?

701
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:52,214
Soon.

702
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:55,117
The last time I shared
a family meal,

703
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,787
my daughter was about your age.

704
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:01,923
Nazarene.

705
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:05,060
She was having some trouble
in school.

706
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:06,328
See, before we moved to Karachi

707
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,930
she had never been
in a co-ed school.

708
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:12,167
She had never been
around boys her own age.

709
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,002
And the other girls knew this,
and they would tease

710
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,672
her and shame her.
My god.

711
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,940
I tried to talk to her
but nothing I said made

712
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:21,777
any difference.

713
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:24,446
I felt like I was helpless.

714
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:26,815
Like I had failed as a father.

715
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:30,218
I think-I think all parents
feel that from time to time.

716
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:34,256
Yeah. Perhaps.

717
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:36,091
A few days later they went
to Miranshah

718
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,393
to visit with some relatives.

719
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:41,063
I couldn't go, I had to stay
in the city for work.

720
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:43,832
Miranshah is in Waziristan,
right?

721
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:46,368
On the Afghan border
where the Taliban are?

722
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,936
Among other things.

723
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,972
But yes, the Pakistani Taliban.

724
01:01:50,974 --> 02:03:41,946
Hmm.

725
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:55,944
So there's two different types
of Taliban?

726
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:59,114
It's complicated.

727
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:01,416
It is complicated, isn't it?

728
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:05,253
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

729
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:08,090
We want the world to be
black and white.

730
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:11,093
Good guys, bad guys.

731
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:15,230
So often in the real world
that's not the case.

732
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:20,969
You see, uh, waziristan
is a tribal area.

733
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:25,140
Very conservative,
very religious.

734
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:30,045
They treat their women
like cattle.

735
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:32,280
I'm sorry, have you been there?

736
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,317
Can't say that I have, no.

737
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:39,421
But I was in New York
a week after 9/11.

738
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,890
Seemed pretty
black and white to me.

739
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,899
Dad, can I have another
glass of wine please?

740
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:52,434
Sure.
I don't think it's a good idea.

741
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,237
No, it's a celebration, Ellen.
Come on.

742
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:11,820
My wife is very well-respected
in my family and my community

743
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,890
and we built a very happy
life together.

744
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:17,025
Yeah, of course.

745
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:19,961
Of course.

746
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,030
What's her name?

747
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:23,198
Fatima.

748
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,332
It's beautiful.

749
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:27,202
She was.

750
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:29,237
There's no beauty in death.

751
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,474
I'm so sorry.

752
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,579
Wherever she is,
she's with Nazarene.

753
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:41,349
They died together.

754
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:44,920
Oh my god.

755
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:46,054
What happened?

756
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:47,255
It's uh-I don't think
we should-

757
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:49,224
no, it's alright.

758
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:52,327
Um, they were struck
by a missile.

759
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,464
<i>That's... awful.</i>

760
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,867
It was awful.

761
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:04,973
<i>So, I mean... who fired-
who fired the missile?</i>

762
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:09,077
A drone aircraft
belonging to the CIA.

763
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,279
That's horrible.

764
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:14,249
Were they just...

765
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:16,852
Just in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

766
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:18,854
Yeah, must have been.

767
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,989
They weren't the only ones.

768
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,490
I ask you, what is
the right place?

769
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,025
The men they are attempting
to kill

770
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:27,896
are constantly surrounded
by civilians.

771
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:29,531
<i>So, I mean, did the CIA,</i>

772
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:34,302
<i>did they think that
the civilians were Isis?</i>

773
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:37,405
I don't care what they thought.

774
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:40,642
Only what they did.

775
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:43,311
Well, whatever...

776
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,981
Whatever it was
they were trying to do,

777
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:50,986
the-the us government does
not fire indiscriminately.

778
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:52,621
Well, perhaps the CIA
has a different definition

779
01:04:52,623 --> 01:04:54,656
of "indiscriminate".

780
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,424
<i>Well, yeah,</i>

781
01:04:56,426 --> 01:05:02,430
<i>I mean... mistakes happen.</i>

782
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:06,334
<i>But I-I think it's easy to um,
you know,</i>

783
01:05:06,336 --> 02:10:12,670
<i>take things out of context.</i>

784
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:10,572
<i>I mean, sometimes we don't know
the bigger picture.</i>

785
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,308
<i>Perhaps the bigger picture
is that,</i>

786
01:05:13,310 --> 02:10:26,618
<i>in the border regions,</i>

787
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:17,379
<i>civilians have been living under
the threat of these bomb strikes</i>

788
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,014
<i>for a decade.</i>

789
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:21,583
Children are afraid to go
to school.

790
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,551
Public gatherings of any kind
are avoided,

791
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:26,187
all because America thinks
it's above the law.

792
01:05:26,189 --> 02:10:52,376
I- I don't understand.

793
01:05:26,189 --> 01:05:32,627
Why is the us firing missiles
into civilian territory?

794
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:34,596
I mean, that doesn't seem-

795
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,064
very good question, Shane.

796
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:37,165
Maybe Neil has the answer.

797
01:05:37,167 --> 02:11:14,332
No, you know-

798
01:05:37,167 --> 02:11:14,332
listen-hey, everyone,
I don't think we should-

799
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:41,202
let's just not get into
this right now, please.

800
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:43,605
No, hey, it's just discussion.

801
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,241
OK, but I think it's enough. I
think it's enough.

802
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:52,480
Look. I can't-I can't even
imagine how you feel,

803
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:57,018
and we are all so sorry
for your loss.

804
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,686
<i>Yeah.</i>

805
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,020
We are. Of course.

806
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:00,221
Of course we are.

807
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:01,723
Thank you, Ellen.

808
01:06:01,725 --> 02:12:03,448
And I'm sorry, this is-

809
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:06,061
it's not a topic of conversation
for your dinner table.

810
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:10,098
I've been wholly inappropriate.

811
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,000
Today's just not a good day
for me.

812
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:14,569
It's the anniversary
of their deaths.

813
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:47,535
Ellen, why-why don't you go
make some coffee?

814
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,138
Yeah. OK.

815
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,240
Would you like some more tea?

816
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:55,110
Um, actually coffee sounds good.

817
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,145
OK. Give me a hand?

818
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:58,513
Yeah.

819
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:14,662
Oh my god.

820
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,298
That was... are you OK?

821
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,734
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

822
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,403
He's obviously distraught

823
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:23,605
and dad's obviously had
too much to drink.

824
01:07:23,607 --> 02:14:47,212
It's a bad combo.

825
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:29,144
Mom, I mean really, we're just
talking, it's not a big deal.

826
01:07:29,146 --> 02:14:58,290
No, you know what?
We're done talking.

827
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:32,280
OK? We're gonna serve this
coffee and call it a night.

828
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,715
Now get me the cream.

829
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,316
Fine.

830
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:50,598
<i>So what happened to the CIA guy?</i>

831
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,233
Happened?

832
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,469
Nothing ever happens to them.

833
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:58,339
He simply continued on
with their work.

834
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:05,180
I gotta take this.

835
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:13,388
So, the military,
they just allow that?

836
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,860
Talk to me.

837
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:20,228
Alright, I checked the logs.

838
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,363
We flew a sortie into Miranshah.

839
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:23,765
<i>One year ago today.</i>

840
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,800
<i>What was the target?</i>

841
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:28,336
<i>Some Al-quaeda bomb-maker
in the middle of town.</i>

842
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:31,873
Hellfire strike outside
his house, right?

843
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:36,778
You see, Shane, some drone
pilots aren't even soldiers.

844
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,547
They don't come within 1,000
kilometers of the battlefield.

845
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:41,249
They work in their
secure cubicles,

846
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,518
essentially playing
a video game.

847
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,253
The only difference
is in this video game

848
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:46,788
the victims are real.

849
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,290
Do you remember
any collateral damage?

850
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,526
Possibly, but we didn't have
boots on the ground

851
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:54,529
<i>so if there was a body count
we couldn't verify it.</i>

852
01:08:54,531 --> 01:09:01,269
They come home to their families
after a long day of murder

853
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:03,404
and put their children to bed.

854
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:05,573
It's so easy to divorce
what they do

855
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:09,310
from real life consequences.

856
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,513
I didn't know that.

857
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:13,414
Some coffee?

858
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,149
Thank you.

859
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:14,816
Cream and sugar?

860
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,384
No, it's fine like this.

861
01:09:16,386 --> 02:18:32,770
OK.

862
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:19,254
<i>Could this information
have come out in the leak?</i>

863
01:09:19,256 --> 01:09:20,688
Wait, is that what
you're worried about?

864
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,856
Ellen finding out?

865
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:23,558
No, not her.

866
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,659
<i>OK, then who?</i>

867
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,561
Just answer the question,
will ya?

868
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:28,830
I don't know, maybe,
but it's a stretch.

869
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,199
Why? What-what's this about?

870
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,600
<i>Nothing.</i>

871
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,171
I'll call you in the morning.

872
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:52,754
Listen, we should probably
go over the spec on the boat

873
01:09:52,756 --> 02:19:45,510
and the registration.

874
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:56,491
Can I see you in my office
for a minute?

875
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,628
I don't know what kind of game
you think you're playing

876
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,364
but I want you out of
my house right now!

877
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,566
Will you threaten with
physical violence if I refuse?

878
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:43,304
Trust me, you do not want
to go there.

879
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:46,241
I must admit, you're not
what I expected, Neil Wiston.

880
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:50,878
I'm calling the police.

881
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,913
You won't do that.

882
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:53,514
Oh yeah? Why not?

883
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:54,749
Because of what I've got
in my briefcase

884
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,252
sitting in your kitchen.

885
01:10:57,254 --> 01:11:00,255
And this detonator.

886
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:01,789
Do you know how much
high explosive

887
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,392
is in a hellfire missile, Neil?

888
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,264
<i>Almost 20 pounds.</i>

889
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:10,632
<i>I googled it.</i>

890
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:12,667
Ah, damn'it.

891
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:15,803
Canary?

892
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:16,671
Oh, shit.

893
01:11:16,673 --> 01:11:17,672
It's rover.

894
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:19,307
Code red. I repeat: Code red.

895
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:22,443
<i>Target has a possible
explosive device.</i>

896
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,713
In a few minutes it'll be
exactly one year

897
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:28,416
from the moment of
my family's death.

898
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:35,957
What do you want?

899
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,959
In time.

900
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,627
Give me your phone.

901
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,065
Give it.

902
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,878
Look.

903
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,847
Look, your family is dead.

904
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,449
I know, and I'm sorry.

905
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:03,484
I really am.

906
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:07,088
But I don't know what the hell
you think that has to do with-

907
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,756
you know exactly
what this has to do with you.

908
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:09,857
I told you!

909
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:11,592
I write code for a living!

910
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:15,730
Stop lying!

911
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,832
Your government data breach,
Neil.

912
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,868
It opened up a back door
to your drone program.

913
01:12:20,870 --> 02:24:41,738
To your flight logs

914
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:25,006
and ultimately to where
we're standing right now.

915
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:31,679
So from now on you will tell
the truth to me and to them.

916
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:40,988
Yeah, OK.

917
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,667
Mom?

918
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,738
Mom? You gonna get that?

919
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,526
Oh, good.

920
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:20,661
Everything all settled then?

921
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:24,399
Do they ever show you pictures
of the innocents you kill, Neil?

922
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,539
I've got your things.

923
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,608
Are you a dutiful wife, Ellen?

924
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,712
Sorry? What?

925
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:40,047
Do you respect your husband?

926
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:42,784
My relationship with my husband
is none of your business.

927
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,557
Now is the time to be honest.

928
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:52,627
Is there something you want
to tell your husband?

929
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:56,831
Please-

930
01:13:56,833 --> 02:27:53,664
Neil.

931
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:59,700
Your wife is seeing another man.

932
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,706
What-why are you saying this?

933
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,842
Because it's the truth.

934
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,043
Mom?

935
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,548
Neil... why are you doing this?

936
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,849
Why are you doing this?

937
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:16,951
Please...

938
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,987
What is this, you sick fuck!

939
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,756
I learned this from you.

940
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:23,024
I put you under
the same surveillance

941
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:24,992
you put my country under
with your satellites

942
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,561
and your drones.

943
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,730
So normalize.

944
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:34,502
Or shall I tell your wife
and your son who you really are?

945
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:37,572
Neil?

946
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,475
I don't work for liker surveys

947
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,477
what are you talking about?

948
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,647
Actually, there is
no liker surveys.

949
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,748
Not really, uh...

950
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,749
What do you mean?

951
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:50,518
It's just a cover.

952
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,019
A cover?

953
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,989
Are-are you an undercover cop?

954
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,023
No.

955
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,492
A criminal? What?

956
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,759
No, I'm not a criminal.

957
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:02,263
That's a matter of opinion.

958
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:08,903
I uh... I'm a-I'm a contractor
for the CIA.

959
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:09,770
The CIA?

960
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:10,872
Yeah.

961
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,673
As in the central intelligence
agency?

962
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,642
Look, I couldn't tell you
the truth

963
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:16,644
because what I do is classified.

964
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:18,045
I'm your fucking wife!

965
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:19,080
Then we're all lying!

966
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:20,181
Tell me the truth!

967
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,082
Dad!

968
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:22,049
Dad, what do you do?

969
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:25,520
I told you, I fly UAV's. Drones.

970
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:30,525
I'm-what would be classified
about aerial mapping?

971
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:33,628
Please tell me it's just maps.

972
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:42,036
I've been part of a test program
for contracted covert missions.

973
01:15:42,038 --> 02:31:24,740
Oh my god.

974
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:47,808
The us air force uses UAV's
to target enemy movements.

975
01:15:47,810 --> 02:31:35,618
Just like the military.

976
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:51,245
We do everything we can to
minimize collateral damage.

977
01:15:51,247 --> 02:31:42,492
No. No!

978
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:55,216
You do not get to reduce it
to collateral damage!

979
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,818
They are people! With names!

980
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,687
Nazarene. Fatima.

981
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,222
They have names.

982
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,090
OK, be careful.

983
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:04,959
Careful.

984
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:07,261
OK Shane, let's go.

985
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:08,129
Neil.

986
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:09,096
Ellen. Ellen!

987
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:09,964
No!

988
01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:10,698
Come here!

989
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,699
Sit down!

990
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:12,266
No!

991
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:13,601
Sit down!

992
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,578
We do what he says, OK?

993
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,213
We do what he says.

994
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:28,316
Is that a bomb?

995
01:16:28,318 --> 01:16:29,984
Is it?

996
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:33,087
I'm so sorry that
you're involved in this.

997
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:36,157
Hey, Shane!

998
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:36,958
Come here!

999
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,025
Sit down!

1000
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,860
Sit down!

1001
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:44,365
Go. Answer it.

1002
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,067
You get the door.

1003
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:47,702
Go.

1004
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:50,104
Shh.

1005
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,606
It's going to be OK.

1006
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,284
What's up with all the shouting?

1007
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,286
Oh, parent-kid stuff.

1008
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:08,823
Shane's being a pain in the ass.

1009
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:10,625
What're you doing here?

1010
01:17:10,627 --> 02:34:21,252
Well, you hung up on me

1011
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:13,995
so we were never able to finish
our conversation.

1012
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:19,033
Oh. Listen, I uh...
I'm sorry about that.

1013
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:20,301
It's just not a good time, Gary.

1014
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,670
I'm sorry. OK?

1015
01:17:22,672 --> 02:34:45,342
Oh, right.

1016
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:25,906
Well, I'm just trying to figure
out what was so important

1017
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,275
about that particular mission.

1018
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:30,645
Forget about it.

1019
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,046
Forget about it?

1020
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,182
OK. OK.

1021
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:39,053
Uh... how-how long we been
partners, now?

1022
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:41,756
I don't know. Three years?

1023
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:44,191
Yeah. Three years.

1024
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:46,761
And I know when you're spooked.

1025
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:48,329
And you're spooked, OK?

1026
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:53,701
Look, when you called
about the security briefing

1027
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:58,039
and the leak, I-I got
to thinking,

1028
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,307
I just got a little freaked out
but it's all good now.

1029
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:01,776
You got a little freaked out?

1030
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:04,779
Yeah.

1031
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:09,417
Gary, I swear, you're reading
way too much into this.

1032
01:18:09,419 --> 01:18:10,985
Am I?
Yes, you are.

1033
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:14,021
Am I?
Yes.

1034
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,723
OK.

1035
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,461
Who's that?

1036
01:18:20,463 --> 02:36:40,924
Oh, our neighbour.

1037
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:28,463
He saw Shane bust up Ellen's
windshield with a baseball.

1038
01:18:28,971 --> 02:36:57,940
Yeah, I saw that.

1039
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:32,106
Yeah, Shane was lying
about it, so...

1040
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:33,974
Acting like a little shit, huh?

1041
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:37,378
Yeah, dumb shit.

1042
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,979
OK.

1043
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:40,414
You're OK then, huh?

1044
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,283
Yeah.

1045
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:43,117
OK.

1046
01:18:43,119 --> 02:37:26,236
OK.

1047
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:45,986
Alright. Well, why don't we have
a little pow wow

1048
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:48,289
before the meeting
in the morning.

1049
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,090
Tomorrow.

1050
01:18:49,092 --> 02:37:39,820
Yeah, OK.

1051
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:51,959
Oh, and uh, tell Shane
to fly straight

1052
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:53,227
or I'm gonna kick his ass.

1053
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,096
<i>You hear that, Shane?</i>

1054
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:57,098
<i>Yeah, he heard it.</i>

1055
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,499
Alright.

1056
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:00,000
<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>

1057
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:01,736
Have a good night.

1058
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,875
You are a painfully good liar,
Neil.

1059
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,436
Are there any other secrets
we should discuss?

1060
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,907
Dad, there's something that
I need to tell you.

1061
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:41,842
Shane, you don't have
to do this!

1062
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:43,410
You tell him nothing!

1063
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:44,478
Don't tell him anything!

1064
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,014
I was there, dad.

1065
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:49,183
When granddad died.

1066
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:53,287
He squeezed my hand and he
hadn't done that in months.

1067
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:56,157
And then he looked at me
and he knew me.

1068
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,059
And then... he stopped.

1069
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:00,795
He stopped breathing.

1070
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,897
I could have gotten a nurse.

1071
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:06,801
I didn't feel like that was
what he wanted so I just-

1072
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:08,969
I left him there for them
to find him.

1073
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,338
I guess I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you

1074
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,041
to feel guilty for not being
there.

1075
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:16,577
You should have been there, dad.

1076
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:17,978
You should have been there.

1077
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:24,819
That's a very good confession,
Shane.

1078
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:27,288
But the guilty should
never be spared.

1079
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,061
<i>Visual ID confirmed.</i>

1080
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,935
Have you ever felt real guilt,
Neil?

1081
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,606
When you look at those
people below

1082
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:49,844
and you take their lives,
do you feel anything?

1083
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:56,116
What do you want? Huh?

1084
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:58,219
Do you want a confession?

1085
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:00,321
Fine.

1086
01:21:00,323 --> 01:21:03,490
Me and the guy who just left,
we killed your family.

1087
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:06,260
Satisfied?

1088
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:07,428
Not at all.

1089
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:10,998
Come on. You want revenge,
don't you?

1090
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,033
You want revenge.

1091
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,135
Come on, give me your best
fucking shot.

1092
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:16,637
Take it out on me!

1093
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,472
But let them leave.

1094
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,077
Who said anything about revenge?

1095
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:24,945
Well, why else would
you be here?

1096
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:26,647
Haven't you listened to anything
I've said?

1097
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:30,184
I'm listening. I'm listening.

1098
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:32,052
Please tell us
how we can help you.

1099
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,989
Tell us.

1100
01:21:34,991 --> 01:21:38,158
I've lost everything.

1101
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,896
I'll never see my family again.

1102
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:43,597
There's nothing left
for me here.

1103
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:45,065
You're upset, you're not
thinking clearly.

1104
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,600
This-no, you don't want this.

1105
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:47,434
Please.

1106
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:48,302
I am thinking clearly.

1107
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:49,270
Please.

1108
01:21:49,272 --> 02:43:38,542
Please, please, please.

1109
01:21:49,272 --> 01:21:53,941
I'm thinking of how they were
taken from me.

1110
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:56,577
I'll do anything you want.

1111
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,046
But please let them leave.

1112
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,182
I miss them so much.

1113
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:11,292
I miss them so much.

1114
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,966
Look.

1115
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:24,338
Please, imir, let them go.

1116
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,073
Just-just let them leave.

1117
01:22:26,075 --> 01:22:29,576
I'll do anything you want,
please.

1118
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:30,611
Just let them leave.

1119
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:32,713
Just let them go.

1120
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:37,952
I'm sorry.

1121
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,687
Now's the time, Neil.

1122
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,591
No!

1123
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:46,060
<i>No target.</i>

1124
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,263
Shane!

1125
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:54,335
<i>No visual on detonator.</i>

1126
01:22:54,337 --> 01:22:55,970
<i>Hold positions.</i>

1127
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,375
Hey!

1128
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:14,488
Get off me!

1129
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:41,415
Now you... understand, Neil.

1130
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,129
No.

1131
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,804
You're not gonna die!

1132
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:05,606
No!

1133
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,680
No!

1134
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:46,273
<i>In the wake of
the recent NSA data breach,</i>

1135
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:49,543
<i>private drone contractor
Neil Wiston has come forward</i>

1136
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:53,147
<i>with more information
on the CIA test program</i>

1137
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:57,384
<i>that blurs the line between
contractors and the military.</i>

1138
01:25:57,386 --> 01:25:59,820
<i>Ironically, as a private
contractor,</i>

1139
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:01,688
<i>Mr. Wiston may be
held responsible</i>

1140
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,390
<i>for any civilian casualties</i>

1141
01:26:03,392 --> 01:26:06,660
<i>during these previously
autonomous combat missions.</i>

1142
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,428
<i>Some folks may call Wiston
a patriot</i>

1143
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:11,698
<i>but I have no doubt he is
a traitor to this country</i>

1144
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,735
<i>and will be charged
with these crimes.</i>

1145
01:26:14,737 --> 01:26:18,872
<i>Serious damage has been done to
programs of national security.</i>

1146
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:22,442
<i>This is the danger of
whistle-blowers like Neil Wiston.</i>

1147
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:24,278
<i>They make our nation vulnerable.</i>
