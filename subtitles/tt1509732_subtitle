00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,469

191
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,837

everyone is innocent for you

211
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:43,948

did he ask anything else?

299
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,220
He was very tired

300
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:47,112
I was thinking that why he did
notjump in water to save me?

301
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,568
Whoever is inside,

305
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:32,763
From where shefali comes?

307
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,395

308
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,703
nothing will be fine

309
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:16,943
nobody likes me

310
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:40,959

311
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,769

315
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,594
I cant believe randhir proposed me

316
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:24,100
I'm very big idiot.
What will happen now?

317
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,701
How I did not see before?

318
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,404
But I always feel that

319
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,676
sometimes you cant see the
things that are infront of you

320
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,089
dont blame yourself

321
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,927
you were trying to help someone

322
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:57,395
but arjun is also fighting with me,
what's so new in it?

323
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,436
What I will say to shefali?

324
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:07,915
Tell her everything honestly
but in caring style

325
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,628
randhir is idiot

326
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,759
I made a mistake

327
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,468

328
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,979

329
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,185

330
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,036
why tou are ignoring me?

331
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,697
Who is ignoring you?

332
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:18,875
I'm not a child.
You are elder now

333
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,016
dont think that I come here
to say you sorry

334
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,885
I'm not thinking this

335
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,880
if I come here to say you sorry then?

336
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,021
Then you can say

337
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,927
If I want then still I cant
ignore you

338
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,367
my green is better than your color

339
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,076

340
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,205
