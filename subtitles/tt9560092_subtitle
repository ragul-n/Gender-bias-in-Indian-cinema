1
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,181
This movie is made with emotions and determination of our team

2
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:14,191
Raise the voice against heinous crimes of our society

3
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,070
This movie may not match the parameters of production technical aspect. 
But match the heart of us to RAISE THE VOICE AGAIST CRIME

00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,545
[siren]

5
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,990
Zoya- what kind of predators have come in this world?

6
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:53,687
-butcher's shops are in all streets. Every house is victimised.

7
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:58,151
Inspector- Rahul ji 
Rahul- Yes Sir

8
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:00,413
Inspector- You are her lawyer

9
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:02,473
Why did she kill him?

10
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:05,473
She is not telling

11
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,682
And if she remains silent like this then

12
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:12,701
These troubles will increase for her

13
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:15,269
Now only you can find a way

14
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:17,837
It is very important for her to speak

15
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:25,928
ZOYA: Peace can not be stored until oppression and crime exists

16
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,766
Rahul: Zoya

17
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:48,579
Rahul- Zoya

18
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,476
This is the investigation officer of your case Mr. Haider Ali Khan

19
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:54,690
Tell him what he wants to know

20
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,288
Do not hide anything. Say everything

21
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,538
I do not want to say anything

22
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:02,771
If you don't bring this reality to the world,

23
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,629
Zoya, why didn't you believe me?

24
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,785
Did everything by yourself

25
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,375
And when everything is done then why this silence?

26
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,813
You know, your silence can lead you to the gallows of death

27
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:19,079
[laughs]

28
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,513
[sighs]

29
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,892
I know, and I do not regret it

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Didn't we try for justice?

31
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:30,085
what happened?

32
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,290
Nothing?

33
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:35,477
That's why I gave justice

34
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:37,345
Zoya, listen

35
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:39,587
Think about your family.

36
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:40,444
family?!

37
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:44,824
What family? what parents?

38
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,843
What husband

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,533
A girl has to marry an illetrate

40
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,607
because he worships five times in a day.

41
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:58,859
and a Muslim

42
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,120
and

43
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,849
Girls are not taught after tenth

44
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:06,693
why?

45
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:09,982
Because she has to serve her husband

46
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,960
She has to give birth

47
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,908
wow

48
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:15,192

49
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:16,485
Speak everything

50
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,424
what happened? How ? and Why?

51
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:20,320
Tell me everything

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,405
Inspector is right

53
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,990
Say everything

54
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:34,941
I was married to an illiterate person

55
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,313
At Grant Road Station

56
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,956
He was downloading pirated movies in Mobiles

57
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,493
Zoya: My husband Zian

58
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:11,760
Was a victim of bad habits

59
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:16,431
whatever he earned, was lost in gambling

60
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,397
The condition of the house was not such that we could survive

61
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:24,608
And Zian's nephew also lived with us.

62
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,084
Azhar Ali, Jian's nephew was very attached to me

63
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,656
Aunty give me Manchurian

00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:57,746
SHOPKEEPER: Please have it.

70
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:01,796
Hold it properly otherwise it would fall

SHOPKEEPER: What do you want Sir

72
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:09,553
Be careful 
yes

73
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,263
Azhar listen

74
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:15,149
If you go to Madrassa everyday

75
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,324
then I shall give you treats every day

76
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,793

81
00:06:24,463 --> 00:06:26,212
Hey, look down on the clothes.

82
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,489
The white shirt will be stained

83
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:32,231
Let's go

84
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:37,605
In such condition of the house

85
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:43,754
I took the job of a baby sitter for Khushi Madam's daughter Prachi

86
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:59,519
ZOYA: Prachi Chaudhary, her father was dead

87
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,276
And Khushi Madam, was taking responsibility for her alone

88
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:09,069
ZOYA: Khushi was an officer in a big company

89
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:20,648
music

90
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,619
Khushi- My darling, What are you looking at?

00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:32,669
PRACHI: Mummy, This is Komal, a movie

92
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:35,758
It is about Good Touch and Bad Touch

93
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:38,758
That was taught in school today

94

ZOYA: I went to madarasa but Azhar was not there

109
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:19,407
Don't know where he's gone?

110
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:22,407
You do not take tension. 
He might be playing with friends somewhere

111
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,663
No, No, I searched him a lot 
but I could not find him anywhere

112
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:29,613
Yes, I'm coming, do not take tension. 
I have to leave work. What the hell

113
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:36,344
Ahmed, please take care of all. 
My nephew is missing. I have to search him

114
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,036
Ok

115
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:39,999
He will deliver you

116
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,349
Hello. 
Yes Zoya

117
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,237

00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,169
Hold it. Keep in the bag

122
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,850
This worthless is here. Where did you go

123
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,156
The only thing this boy does is give tension

124
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:20,763
My money is wasted because of you

125
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:23,266
Where did you go? I lost my earning

126
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:24,152

127
00:10:24,152 --> 00:10:25,075
Where did you go

128
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,557
Don't hit him

129
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,994
Zian: Youve screwed my brain 
ZOYA: For God's sake leave him

130
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:32,616
It's not his fault

131
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:37,218
he only went at our uncle's place to play with kids

132
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,453
I thought that he was lost

133
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,762
-It's my fault . I was just so worried

134
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:44,093
why do you hit him every day ?

135
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:46,061
beacuse of this I forgot to watch the match

136
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,642
The last over must be going on

137
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:09,579
Wow ! Virat will make us win

138
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:14,503
-And thats a four!

139
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,333

Goodbye brother

145
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,150
What is this?

146
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,721
this is...

147
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:08,794
-you know.... I...

148
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,814
These are those birth control pills right?!

149
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:14,534
Zoya- no....you.. 
Zian- Answer me!

150
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,052
Zoya- You need to understand ... that...

151
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:22,511
that we don't have the resources or money to raise another child

152
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:24,709
That's why I started taking these pills

153
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:26,681
Now that's the reason !

154
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:30,124
Even after a year of our marrige and we still don't have any kids

155
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:32,988
Zoya- We have azhar

156
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:34,526
-He's our child.

157
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:37,735
Zian- Don't you dare call this bastard my son

158
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:40,735
-He is a damn bastard ! You think you're too smart?

159
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:47,993
A child is a Allah's gift. It is said in Quran as well that,

160
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:51,893
Allah gives one life and he only takes care of that life

161
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:55,621
-Allah will punish you for using these pills and aborting the child.

162
00:12:55,873 --> 00:13:00,426
Zoya- Why dont you understand? 
Zian- You're lucky I am in a good mood today because I won.

163
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:04,647
-or else i would've beaten you to death.

164
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,489
(Zoya remembers her life before the wedding)

165
00:13:41,184 --> 00:15:58,420
(music playing)

166
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:14,915
ZOYA: Mom! I am not going to marry zian

167
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:16,227
I'm in love with rahul

168
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,578
And I'll only marry him

169
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,188
Mom- Oh My God!What nonsense are you talking?

170
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:26,285
-You'll marry a non muslim! 
Aren't you scared of Allah?

171
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,856
Zoya- Fear from Allah?

172
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:32,743
-Our Allah is not cold hearted

173
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:38,268
-And why does religon matter? Aren't they humans? 
Didn't allah give this them life as well?

174
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:45,981
Our religion teaches people to love each other

175
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:49,649
No, it teaches us to fall in love with muslims only

176
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,189
And rahul is not muslim! 
So get over him

177
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:55,165
And marry Zian

178
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,347
Only beacuse he's muslim?

179
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:01,194
I won't marry Zian

180
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:04,739
We gave your aunt our word so please get over him

181
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:10,001
Your uncle was right! He told me that I 
shoundn't have give a girl freedom and shouldn't educate

182
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,470

- I sent him to madarsa today 
but he's always so reluctant to go

261

280
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,050
- and since then he's not talking to anyone 
and didn't even go to madarsa

281
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,449
Why don't you send him to a normal school?

282
00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:09,452
Zoya- Sadly we poor pepole can't 
afford to send him to a private school

283
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:15,689
- and in madarsa they teach about 
religion also that's why we send him there

284
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:18,130

Khushi- Hi Aman, how are you? 
Aman- How am I? Would I be happy after being humiliated?

393
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:11,862
Khushi- What are you saying Aman?

394
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:18,725
There's nothing left to say. You only told me to go at your 
place take care of Prachi and Ganpati ji

395
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:25,508
- And you only told me that your daughter 
wanted to work in movies

396
00:47:25,537 --> 00:47:39,844
so I bought one of the biggest producer 
and your maid decided to insult us!

397
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:45,819
Aman- If you wanted to humiliate me 
then why did you invite me in your home?!

398
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:54,038
Prachi? 
Prachi- Coming

401
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:04,755
Prachi- Yes I'm ready

402
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:07,178
Who's on the door?

403
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:15,590
Prachi: Mumma is here!

404
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,702
Goodmorning mam, You're here

405
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:23,998
Mumma listen yesterday Aman uncle came and 
there was some other man with him and trust me they're not nice

406
00:48:23,998 --> 00:48:23,999
Mumma listen yesterday Aman uncle came and 
there was some other man with him and trust me they're not nice 
Khushi- Oh they are not nice? 
The only good person here is Zoya?

407
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:28,774
Khushi- Oh they are not nice? 
The only good person here is Zoya?

408
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,139
What are you saying?

409
00:48:33,763 --> 00:48:39,199
I know what happened here yesterday,you lied to Aman 
that we had a conversation and you told him to leave

410
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,619
I had to say that..

411
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,824
If I wouldn't have lied they would never leave

412
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:47,142
Prachi- Yes mumma! They are not nice people

413
00:48:47,142 --> 00:48:50,224
You shut up! You are becoming very rude day by day

414
00:48:50,236 --> 00:48:53,236
Mam, Prachi is telling the truth...

415
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:54,751
- Why don't you get it?

416
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:57,689
This is my house and I know how's everyone

417
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:03,630
You don't know anything mam... 
I felt it that's why I came back

418
00:49:05,056 --> 00:49:06,871
- Prachi was so scared

419
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:13,851
God forbid, if anything happened to prachi...

420
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:16,924
What rubbish are you talking? Stupid!

421
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:20,024
I'm neither stupid nor talking rubbish

422
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:22,782
I can judge the eyes of men

423
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:28,820
- You are not able to 
understand because you are blindsided by love

424
00:49:29,688 --> 00:49:33,253
You arguing with me? You are fired!

425
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:35,009
- Get out of my house now!

426
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:56,211
Mumma! Zoya di is telling the truth 
and she's not going anywhere

427
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,450
No, Prachi

428
00:50:02,214 --> 00:50:06,418
- If I'm not being respected there's 
point in staying

429
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:11,517
- I always considered this place my home

430
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,313
Prachi..

431
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:21,228

434
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:45,759
- Now, that I'm going I would like to say 
something that sometimes what we see is not the truth

435
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:50,216
- and what we're not able to see is the truth

436
00:50:50,287 --> 00:50:52,716
-They are not good people

437
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,921

00:50:57,019 --> 00:51:03,004

441
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:37,609

-Why are you crying?

447

My teacher punished me a lot today

448
00:51:57,407 --> 00:52:00,648
You must have not studied 
that's why he gave you punishment

449
00:52:02,445 --> 00:52:04,963
No..I don't want to go..

450
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:09,319
Zoya- You need to go to madarsa

00:52:10,076 --> 00:52:13,076
- And I don't want you to get hurt

452
00:52:15,127 --> 00:52:19,184
Azhar- I won't go to madarsa ... 
Zoya- Azhar, you need to

453
00:52:19,184 --> 00:52:22,347
Azhar- No one understands me! No one!

454
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:24,926
Zoya- Azhar please listen to me....

He tried...

478
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:16,265
I consider her my daughter

480
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:20,957

It's ok ... there was some error OK

- Where's azhar?

511
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:45,750
Rahul- Azhar?

512
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:47,717
- Who's azhar?

513
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:50,188
My son

514
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:52,052
Your son?

515
01:01:55,428 --> 01:01:58,428
He's Zian's nephew

516
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:01,834
- My husband Zian

517
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:10,039
- When I went to madarsa today... 
he wasn't there... I..

518
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:17,582
- I have no idea where he is 
It's been so long and he still hasn't returned back home..

519
01:02:17,764 --> 01:02:20,764
(breaking voice) I have no clue

520
01:02:21,328 --> 01:02:26,703
- ( breaking voice) I.. don't know..

521
01:02:27,074 --> 01:02:28,591
Has he ever done this before

522
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,559
Yes... a lot.... he doesn't want to go madasa.

523
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,095
Don't worry he'll come back

524
01:02:38,095 --> 01:02:41,095
- But I'll drop you at your place

525
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,251
Rahul

526
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,945
- My mom has fixed my marriage

527
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:23,517
- If I even dare to say your name 
there will be blood

528
01:03:25,721 --> 01:03:30,742
- I don't think I'll be able to chose 
between you and my mom

529
01:03:31,316 --> 01:03:34,316
- I don't what I'm supposed to do

530
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:39,278
I think you should accept the proposal

531
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:42,411
Zoya- Rahul...

532
01:03:42,529 --> 01:03:46,188
- You are telling me this? 
Are you saying that you'll forget me so easily?

533
01:03:50,951 --> 01:03:53,154
It's impossible to forget you

534
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:58,878
- If this ever happens I'll never forgive myself

535
01:04:00,486 --> 01:04:03,486
How will I spend my life without you?

536
01:04:07,742 --> 01:04:17,094
You'll become a good wife and I'll get away from 
all this noise and try to become a good person

537
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:27,948
I don't think this was the last time i've said your name.

538
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:39,713
I will take this on me, I've read 
in quran that a girl decides who she marries.

539
01:04:43,604 --> 01:04:46,519
No zoya, its not about religion.

540
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:52,660
Are we that selfish? That for our own 
happiness we'll go against our family

541
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:56,266
- And build our future on this hatred

542
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:02,507
There's nothing left to say

543
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:07,680
- I'm proud that I fell in love with a guy like you

544
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:17,974
I want my right

545
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,135
Yes?

546
01:05:22,024 --> 01:05:24,358
That you'll never stop writing poetry

547
01:05:25,117 --> 01:05:26,740
(softly chuckles)

548
01:05:26,913 --> 01:05:34,415
No Rahul, I can't do it that part of me is dead

549
01:05:40,696 --> 01:05:43,934
(sobbing)

550
01:06:01,228 --> 01:08:13,783
(music playing)

551
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:28,187
Rahul- Be careful

552
01:08:32,662 --> 01:08:36,194
- Come....come... slowly..

553
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,778
- We're here

554
01:08:43,778 --> 01:08:45,224
- Give me your keys

555
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:56,041
Rahul, come inside

556
01:08:58,505 --> 01:09:01,694
We promised that we'll 
stay away from each other

557
01:09:03,024 --> 01:09:04,570
- still

558
01:09:05,639 --> 01:09:09,564
- if you ever need help of advocate Rahul 
then call me

559
01:09:09,564 --> 01:09:12,027
- And Azhar will come back

560
01:09:29,647 --> 01:09:31,820
What was happening here?!

561
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,111
Did you find Azhar?

562
01:09:33,111 --> 01:09:38,156
Don't try to change the topic! 
Who was that man with you?

563
01:09:38,305 --> 01:09:41,305
Zoya- Who? 
Zian- He just left! Who is he?

564
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,640
I was searching Azhar and...

565
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:47,033
Zian- Stop this act of yours!

566
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:49,131
- Who is that man?!

567
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:52,131
I fainted so...

568
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:56,156
- I was searching every corner to find Azhar...

569
01:09:56,156 --> 01:10:01,388
- And Rahul ji he helped me

570
01:10:01,388 --> 01:10:01,389
- And Rahul ji he helped me 
- He's a good man

571
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:04,012
- He's a good man

572
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:06,402
- You're having a misunderstanding

573
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:09,402
Like this! 
He also removed your clothes?!

574
01:10:09,422 --> 01:10:12,422
- Rahul ji? 
Now you remember his name also

575
01:10:13,433 --> 01:10:16,433
- You're having a misunderstanding

576
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:18,806
- For god's sake find my son..

577
01:10:18,806 --> 01:10:18,807
- For god's sake find my son.. 
Stop changing the topic

578
01:10:18,807 --> 01:10:20,377
Stop changing the topic

579
01:10:22,067 --> 01:10:25,067
- I know you are a shameless woman.

580
01:10:25,328 --> 01:10:28,328
- That's why you leave the house 
without burqa

581
01:10:37,002 --> 01:10:39,791
- Now you're sick!

582
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:43,067
- Go tell your love Rahul if I ever 
see him near you

583
01:10:43,067 --> 01:10:47,064
- then I'll chop his body into tiny pieces 
and throw them into gutter

584
01:10:47,064 --> 01:10:51,131
- just like what our family did to Azhar's father!

585
01:10:52,636 --> 01:10:55,636
- Azhar's mom killed herself

586
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:18,366
Zoya- Azhar..

587
01:12:18,664 --> 01:12:20,956
My uncle was beating you 
because of me right?

588
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:22,690
- Please forgive me

589
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,300
No,my dear

590
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:24,301
No,my dear 
I'll go to madarsa everyday

591
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:26,498
I'll go to madarsa everyday

592
01:12:30,907 --> 01:12:33,197
My baby...

593
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:54,833
Food is getting cold, Azhar

594
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:29,372
Zoya- If you don't raise your voice against 
crime then you're a part of it

595
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:34,005
Aunty?

596
01:13:34,005 --> 01:13:36,074
- Aunty?

597
01:13:36,074 --> 01:13:38,064
- Aunty?

598
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:46,812
Why are you crying?

599
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:54,229
- It dosen't matter how much they 
punish me I'll still go to madarsa

600
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:02,166
- It doesn't matter what kinds of punishment 
maulvi sir will gives me

601
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,772
- No matter how much it pains

602
01:14:05,772 --> 01:14:08,037
- I'll still go

603
01:14:09,176 --> 01:14:12,834
What kind of punishment does he give you?

604
01:14:13,106 --> 01:14:15,721
That... the..

605
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:15,722
That... the.. 
- just like how uncle gives you punishment every night

606
01:14:15,722 --> 01:14:19,901
- just like how uncle gives you punishment every night

607
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:22,069
- just like today

608
01:14:22,069 --> 01:14:24,632
- Maulvi sir punishes me like that

609
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:24,633
- Maulvi sir punishes me like that 
-after madarsa he takes me to his house and...

610
01:14:24,633 --> 01:14:27,632
-after madarsa he takes me to his house and...

611
01:14:28,845 --> 01:14:33,025
- and if I do anything wrong then he punishes me.

612
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:49,573
- But it's fine I'll still go and 
suffer all the pain

613
01:14:53,793 --> 01:14:56,793
Oh my god!

614
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,020
- where did I go wrong

615
01:15:17,686 --> 01:15:19,477
- Such a crime

616
01:15:22,712 --> 01:15:25,712
- my Azhar sufferd all this pain

617
01:15:29,604 --> 01:15:33,414
- what kind of monsters did you give birth to

618
01:15:35,851 --> 01:15:38,629
- What was this poor child's fault?

619
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:43,706
- that monster made him suffer everyday

620
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,237
- and you just stood there and watched all this

621
01:15:54,597 --> 01:15:58,929
- You can't do anything 
I know that

622
01:16:00,363 --> 01:16:04,227
- I'll make that sinner pay for his crimes

623
01:16:15,192 --> 01:16:19,525
- Azhar I'm here for you

624
01:16:32,022 --> 01:16:34,030
Zoya- Hello 
Zian- Speak

625
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,593
Come home right now

626
01:16:36,711 --> 01:16:38,039
Zian- Why? What happened?

627
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:41,892
I'm telling you come home 
I can't talk about this on phone

628
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,577
Zian- Tell me what happened?

629
01:16:43,577 --> 01:16:46,577
We need to go to madarsa 
and talk to imam

630
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:48,072
Zian- Why?

631
01:16:48,072 --> 01:16:51,919
Please come home then 
I'll tell you everything

632
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,494
Zian- such a stress

633
01:16:53,494 --> 01:16:53,495
Zian- such a stress 
Please come home

634
01:16:53,495 --> 01:16:56,153
Please come home

635
01:16:56,441 --> 01:16:59,681
Zian- He's lying because he dosen't want 
to attend madarsa

636
01:16:59,826 --> 01:17:02,826
Zoya- Why would he lie?!

637
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:06,083
Zian- You don't understand 
he's a non- muslim's blood

638
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:08,728
Zoya- Stop this "non- muslim's blood"

639
01:17:08,783 --> 01:17:12,442
- Isn't he human? What rubbish are you saying

640
01:17:13,523 --> 01:17:16,335
- why don't you understand?

641
01:17:16,335 --> 01:17:19,335
- that maulvi raped him

642
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:25,705
What bullshit are you saying?

643
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:29,408
Zoya- What rubbish are you talking!

644
01:17:29,474 --> 01:17:31,410
Zian- rubbish?

645
01:17:31,427 --> 01:17:34,713
You are against our religion.

646
01:17:34,814 --> 01:17:40,142
I am divorcing you right now.

647
01:17:40,142 --> 01:17:43,205
Talaaq, Talaaq, Talaaq.

648
01:17:57,508 --> 01:18:02,598
- You'll divorce me? I'm divorcing you insted

649
01:18:50,711 --> 01:18:55,266
Rather than helping me get justice, 
my husband supported those monsters

650
01:18:55,266 --> 01:18:57,920
- then he divorced me and kicked me out

651
01:19:02,796 --> 01:19:04,937
Zoya's mom- My dear

652
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:11,169
- come in

653
01:19:12,454 --> 01:19:13,650
- come

654
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:24,544
Mom, I left Zian

655
01:19:25,809 --> 01:19:27,269
- forever

656
01:19:27,269 --> 01:19:30,278
- that rascal divorced me

657
01:19:30,278 --> 01:19:30,279
- that rascal divorced me 
What?

658
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:33,446
What?

659
01:19:52,736 --> 01:19:58,912
If the priests commit such heinous crimes 
then where will humanity go?

660
01:19:59,606 --> 01:20:02,606
- That maulvi should pay for his crimes

661
01:20:04,494 --> 01:20:09,899
- my dear, I'm responsible for this

662
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:41,123
Yash - Hello, 
yes dear

663
01:20:41,123 --> 01:20:43,125
- yes tell me

664
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:45,272
- I'm coming

665
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:55,053
Mumma...

666
01:20:55,498 --> 01:20:57,878
- you didn't believe me

667
01:20:59,034 --> 01:20:59,790
What happened?

668
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,979
about Aman

669
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:00,980
about Aman 
What?

670
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:01,992
What?

671
01:21:02,387 --> 01:21:03,386
look at this

672
01:21:13,456 --> 01:21:18,217
Aman- And after that I'll take you 
to that producer...

673
01:21:21,778 --> 01:21:24,778
He played me!

674
01:21:24,778 --> 01:21:29,000
- he's such a bad guy, I can't believe it

675
01:21:29,511 --> 01:21:32,511
- and Zoya tried to warn me about 
this a million times

676
01:21:32,511 --> 01:21:35,292
-My dear, I'm so sorry

677
01:21:39,226 --> 01:21:42,849
- you also told me about this and 
I didn't believe you

678
01:21:42,849 --> 01:21:44,331
- I'm so sorry baby

679
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:48,706
- I don't care 
I'm making him pay for this

680
01:21:48,706 --> 01:21:50,247
- we'll file police report against him!

681
01:21:50,247 --> 01:21:52,112
Prachi- No 
Khushi- Why?!

682
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,881
- he deserves to be rot in jail

683
01:21:55,881 --> 01:21:59,584
Prachi- Yes, I told tauji (uncle) about this 
he's coming to india

684
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:11,664
Zoya- Hello , Uncle 
Zoya's Uncle- Hello dear

685
01:22:13,616 --> 01:22:18,941
You know everything right? 
Nothing is hidden from you right?

686
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:21,706
- you know what happened with Azhar?

687
01:22:23,984 --> 01:22:28,745
- Uncle you have so much respect 
and power in the community

688
01:22:29,063 --> 01:22:32,063
- Uncle, I want justice

689
01:22:33,905 --> 01:22:36,905
- make maulna shakhir rot

690
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:42,766
- I want justice for Azhar

691
01:22:43,993 --> 01:22:47,664
I can understand your pain

692
01:22:47,664 --> 01:22:51,758
- I'll make that maulvi pay for crimes

693
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:55,118
- I'll call the head of madarsa and

694
01:22:55,528 --> 01:22:58,071
- I'll get that maulvi expelled from madarsa

695
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,530
You'll only expel him?

696
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:01,690
Expel.... yes

697
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:08,041
- I came here with so many expectaion 
and you crushed them

698
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:14,321
- No uncle expeling him is not enough 
there should be police case against him

699
01:23:14,753 --> 01:23:17,753
What good will come from police?

700
01:23:17,943 --> 01:23:23,838
- they'll insult our community

701
01:23:24,028 --> 01:23:25,580
- insult you.

702
01:23:26,476 --> 01:23:31,585
-Azhars insult and madarsa will also get insulted

703
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:37,291
- Do you want to give these 
non-muslims chance to embarrass islam

704
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,380
- For once think about it

705
01:23:41,442 --> 01:23:46,181
- and these embarrassed us enough already

706
01:23:47,476 --> 01:23:50,801
Everything is wrong with our community?!

707
01:23:51,064 --> 01:23:55,900
- to protect islam if we need to stay quiet then

708
01:23:55,984 --> 01:23:58,524
- consider it Azhar's mercy

709
01:23:59,144 --> 01:24:03,378
- and for Islam's sake don't go to police

710
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:11,722
By giving me all these religious causes 
you're trying to protect that monster

711
01:24:11,722 --> 01:24:12,599
No?!

712
01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:18,256
That man abused Azhar everyday

713
01:24:18,256 --> 01:24:18,257
That man abused Azhar everyday 
- no one can understand his pain

714
01:24:18,257 --> 01:24:24,140
- no one can understand his pain

715
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:27,296
- you still care about religon

716
01:24:27,296 --> 01:24:30,296
- he has forgotten his smile, Uncle

717
01:24:31,546 --> 01:24:34,459
- he dosen't have anyone else 
other than me

718
01:24:34,676 --> 01:24:37,917
- and you're telling me to stay slient 
about this?

719
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:41,728
- That's enough, Uncle.

720
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:51,184
- when I asked my husband for justice, he divorced me

721
01:24:51,464 --> 01:24:55,890
-When I asked you for justice, you preached me about religious causes

722
01:24:57,117 --> 01:24:58,905
- Goodbye, Uncle.

723
01:25:15,885 --> 01:25:19,058
In today's world there are 
a lot of issues that

724
01:25:19,058 --> 01:25:23,491
- we shy away from instead 
fighting them

725
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:26,921
- and criminals get encouraged

726
01:25:27,046 --> 01:25:30,046
- In our community every 2nd or 3rd kid

727
01:25:30,046 --> 01:25:32,430
- has been a victim of child abuse

728
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:35,092
- Now what is child abuse?

729
01:25:35,832 --> 01:25:37,364
- there are 2 types of abuse

730
01:25:37,428 --> 01:25:39,339
- First one is considered more serious

731
01:25:39,463 --> 01:25:42,204
- 21% kids are victims of it

732
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:47,386
- this includes rape, inappropriate touching,

733
01:25:47,386 --> 01:25:50,061
- and stripping down a kid

734
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:51,687
- this proves that...

735
01:25:51,904 --> 01:25:52,999
Khushi- He's right

736
01:25:52,999 --> 01:25:53,000
Khushi- He's right 
- really bad things are happening to kids

737
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,999
- really bad things are happening to kids

738
01:25:55,999 --> 01:25:57,721
- very bad things are happening

739
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:01,411
Yes, Aman also tried to do this to me

740
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:02,633
- he's so right

741
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:07,116
Don't worry I'll get my laptop 
from that bastard

742
01:26:07,116 --> 01:26:07,117
Don't worry I'll get my laptop 
from that bastard 
Amir khan- We think that our kids are 
safe at home

743
01:26:07,117 --> 01:26:10,786
Amir khan- We think that our kids are 
safe at home

744
01:26:10,896 --> 01:26:14,897
Prachi- Mumma, don't go uncle is coming

745
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,705
Zoya- Rahul.. 
Rahul- Come inside

746
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:10,874
Child abuse

747
01:27:13,788 --> 01:27:18,083
- all this happened and 
now you're telling me about it?

748
01:27:19,023 --> 01:27:22,023
- how did you go through this alone?

749
01:27:24,263 --> 01:27:30,117
you told me always to be an stranger to you

750
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,962
we didn't know that our sacrfice was for nothing

751
01:27:39,067 --> 01:27:42,298
- well now we....

752
01:27:42,298 --> 01:27:42,299
- well now we.... 
- need to get justice

753
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,460
- need to get justice

754
01:27:45,104 --> 01:27:48,312
- we'll go to police station tomorrow and flie an FIR

755
01:27:50,097 --> 01:27:52,396
- and get justice

756
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:58,940
Zoya- where will we find evidence?

757
01:27:59,318 --> 01:28:02,318
- and why would that kid lie

758
01:28:02,496 --> 01:28:06,860
Rahul- All this happened with that kid 
and you guys are not filing an Fir

759
01:28:08,308 --> 01:28:12,170
Zoya- police is also not helping us

760
01:28:19,286 --> 01:28:22,286
- how will we punish that maulvi?

761
01:28:27,656 --> 01:28:29,577
Rahul- I don't know what to do...

762
01:28:47,099 --> 01:28:49,083
- Zoya it's a very sensitive issue

763
01:28:50,165 --> 01:28:52,791
- nobody wants to touch this subject

764
01:28:55,201 --> 01:28:58,785
- Admistration,police every one is scared

765
01:28:59,263 --> 01:29:02,672
- because it's about madarsa and maulvi

766
01:29:08,946 --> 01:29:10,244
what do you mean?

767
01:29:10,618 --> 01:29:14,969
I think we should take this to court

768
01:29:16,262 --> 01:29:18,730
- and then we'll file a complain

769
01:29:20,497 --> 01:29:25,522
Court case? ...Rahul my husband didn't support me,

770
01:29:26,075 --> 01:29:28,387
- police didn't help us and

771
01:29:29,179 --> 01:29:32,572
-my uncle also didn't help me

772
01:29:32,572 --> 01:29:36,765
- then how will your court help me?!

773
01:29:41,912 --> 01:29:45,402
what did my uncle do? what did the police do?

774
01:29:45,402 --> 01:29:47,054

Oh God

794
01:31:43,994 --> 01:31:46,714

no one can take that girl 
away from me

803
01:32:24,653 --> 01:32:26,101
Prachi- Yes

01:32:27,145 --> 01:32:29,209
Yash- you do this to innocent kids!

01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:35,018
- You're a monster

806
01:32:35,018 --> 01:32:37,525
Prachi- He's a very bad guy.

807
01:32:38,568 --> 01:32:43,143

01:33:04,281 --> 01:33:09,964

Maulana Shakir also works for him

815
01:33:26,782 --> 01:33:28,973
Is he dead?

816
01:33:29,627 --> 01:33:31,137
You don't worry about it
