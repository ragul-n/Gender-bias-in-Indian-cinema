1
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,833
"Good morning, Papa
I said, good morning.."

2
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,399
Papa is sleeping!

3
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,511
"Where are you going, prince?
Won't you give Papa a kiss!"

4
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,506
"Come fast, you are getting late!"

5
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,884
"Have your food properly, son. "

6
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,245
What happened?
- What happened to you?

7
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:40,519
Why? - You did not feel shy
like an lndian woman.- I can't...

8
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:47,299
As Raju has gone to school
& servant is on leave till 1

9
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,262
Give this servant
leave for ever!

10
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,941
What is there to laugh about?
- I have to say one thing.

11
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,509
To me?
- Yes.

12
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,803
Tell -I will say it in your ear!
- What?

13
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,785
It is 8 & there is an office
meeting at 9 today!

14
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,982
Is this something to be
told into the ear?

15
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,959
What a way to wake me up.
Right in the morning you have....

16
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,791
...spoilt my mood! You've thrown
water on a husband's hopes.

17
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,826
"Come Ram sit. Look, the board
meeting has been cancelled. "

18
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,936
But for you there is
an order!- Order!

19
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,502
Today I finish 25 years of
marriage. And my wife wishes...

20
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:37,440
...to call everyone to celebrate
our wedding anniversary today

21
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,176
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,116
"Ram, you will have to come to
the party and of course sing too."

23
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,515
"Look, I do not...- Look you must
have sung in..."

24
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,021
...some party and your fame must
have reached my wife's ears!

25
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,063
Now you will have to sing!
- Where is the party?

26
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,632
"At my house, tonight
at 8 o'clock. Come surely"

27
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,542
So you have come! - What is
this? You are not ready yet.

28
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,273
"l will get ready right away, but
your son is not ready as yet. "

29
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,286
You didn't get him ready?
- He is doing some work.

30
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,888
Doing work?
- Just see!

31
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,994
"What is there in this world,
which does not eat, does not..."

32
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:35,597
...drink but still lives!
No sword can slash it.

33
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:41,005
No gun can kill it.
Even death cannot destroy it!

34
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:45,083
It is the soul!
- Right son?

35
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,915
"What Papa, with great difficulty
I got into mood and you spoilt it."

36
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,579
"What is it?
- It is not soul, it is name. "

37
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,358
"We have a debate in school.
And the subject is, 'what is..."

38
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,153
...there in a name?'. I am
preparing the speech for it.

39
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,759
"Son, we are going to a party.
You prepare your speech later."

40
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,203
No papa. Party will finish late.
We've the debate...

41
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,805
...today morning only.

42
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,969
Then what should we do?
- We can do it if you help..

43
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,135
..me. Then I can come
for the party.

44
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,008
"Yes, why not? We are "Thakurs'
by tradition! Who else will..."

45
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,554
...know the value of name
more than us.

46
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,214
Put on the tape recorder!

47
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,120
"Name! Name! Name, Yes!!"

48
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,934
Everything is there in the name.
Name does not drink or eat....

49
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,132
"...still it is important. No sword
can cut it, nor no gun kill it!"

50
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:47,143
"ln our family for name people
have cut their heads, given life!"

51
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:52,107
"Great is he, who lives for his
name and dies for it!"

52
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:56,382
"Those who don't have name are
like rats, cats or even insects "

53
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,924
Without name therefore it
is better to die!

54
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:47,428
"Whoever remembers
the lessons of faith,..."

55
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:55,173
...he only will get destroyed

56
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:51,329
"The city which is destroyed
can be constructed again, but..."

57
00:07:52,271 --> 00:08:06,083
...our house once destroyed
cannot be happy again

58
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:14,251
"ln love, one who will be
destroyed is..."

59
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:22,200
...one who remembers the
lessons of loyalty!

60
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:58,137
I will be very much protected
inside a cover...

61
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:13,078
...but gloom may be
standing at the gateway!

62
00:09:46,252 --> 00:10:07,938
They will take my name but...

63
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:21,946
...it will be taken after every
one else's name!

64
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,414
"Great, it was wonderful.
Very nice!"

65
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,354
"Wow, how well you sing!
I am hearing such a lovely..."

66
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,896
....after a very long time.
I am Dinesh Mathur.

67
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,999
I am Managing Director
of Music lndia.

68
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,569
I am so happy meeting you.
- In fact I am so happy...

69
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,169
...to meet you. For my company l
wish to record your songs!

70
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,436
"l am very happy hearing it.
-After this lovely song, let..."

71
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:23,514
"us now have some lovely food!
- Yes, let us go."

72
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,084
Come this way please!

73
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,187
Every body appreciated it.
- Very nice.

74
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,031
"Ok, we will meet again."

75
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:46,862
How are you people going?
- By Taxi...

76
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,201
"Why by Taxi?
Come, I will drop you."

77
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,572
"No no, it is all right!
- Come, I will drop you, please. "

78
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,110
"Thank you, Mr. Mathur"

79
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,235
"Brother, please hand over these
papers with lnspector Sharma..."

80
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,966
...at Bandra Police Station. They
are very important. Please.

81
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,223
What is the matter?

82
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,363
"lnspector Sharma,
from Mehta Chowdhary"

83
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:30,366
"Jagmohan, he is a very famous
man suspected to be a smuggler."

84
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,838
Yes-Polic could never catch him
as there is no proof against him

85
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:41,382
I think the papers and photos
can send him to jail.- But...

86
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:48,083
To have enemity with Jagmohan
is like an invitation to death!

87
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,826
You are a family man. Why you
want to invite trouble?

88
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:59,231
"lnstead of handing over these
papers to lnspector Sharma, "

89
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,271
it would be better to burn them.
Your welfare lies therein.

90
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,569
"What are you saying?
- Yes, accept his words"

91
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:09,304
But he doesn't know me.
-No...

92
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,316
You don't know Jagmohan.
He can trace out any one...

93
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,082
...he wants and wipe him out as
per his wish.

94
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,303
"All right, who has been
murdered? - I don't know. "

95
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,937
But there is a body lying on the
road behind the police station.

96
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,815
Behind the police station?
- Why had you gone there?

97
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,149
"Look I am a doctor, and I had
gone to see a patient. "

98
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,588
There I saw a body drenched in
blood. When I went near him...

99
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,052
I saw that hee was dead. I
thought I should inform you.

100
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,027
Do you know that man?
- No.

101
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,068
Have you seen him before?
-No.

102
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,303
"Still you come to report,
without any interest?"

103
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,310
What do you mean?
- I will explain to you.

104
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,041
Go and sit down there!
- Look I am in a hurry.

105
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,449
"l have to see a patient.
-lf you were in a hurry,.... "

106
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,214
"...why did you come here? It is
a case of murder, not a laughing"

107
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,517
...matter. Go & sit there

108
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,252
These people don't allow us to
even breathe.-Mr Dave-Yes Sir!

109
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,052
Is this the way to talk to
people? An honest citizen has...

110
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,099
...come to report a murder and
you are dealing with him as if...

111
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:34,892
...he himself is the culprit.

112
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,365
"To find out about the deceased
is your job, not his."

113
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,003
But-No ifs and buts! First write
down his report. No unnecessary..

114
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,441
"...queries. Write in 2 minutes.
Understood? - Yes, Sir. "

115
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:50,139
"l am sorry for the trouble, Dr.
Give your address and tele no. "

116
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:54,618
We may need it. I will ensure
that in future you...

117
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,615
..don't have to face similar..
difficulties. -Thank you.

118
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,823
We didn't allow him to reach the
police station.

119
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,498
The papers were not with him?
It means that before dying he..

120
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,495
...has handed over the papers
to somebody else.

121
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:16,537
Keep a watch on the police
station. Who comes there?

122
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:21,506
Who telephones and what
he talks. For whoever...

123
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,306
...has the papers will certainly
try to reach the police station.

124
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,285
And those papers should not
reach...

125
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,254
...the police station under
any circumstance.

126
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:37,351
"For last several days, he was on
search of a man who..."

127
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,524
...was getting people addicted to
drugs and destroying their lives.

128
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,066
Before dying he had rung up
lnspector Sharma that he was...

129
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,403
"...coming along with such photos
and proofs, that someone very..."

130
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,034
...important could go for many
years in jail.

131
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,941
"Those smuggler, a demon, only
have got him murdered."

132
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,513
Do you know the smuggler's
name?

133
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,818
"No, I don't know. - What did
you say was the police..."

134
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,220
...inspector's name?
- It is lnspector Sharma.

135
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,291
"Yes, Mr Mehta had told me on
phone that he is coming with..."

136
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,763
...some photos and proofs which
would help in arresting a very...

137
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,826
...big culprit.
- Who is that Culprit?

138
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,304
"Without proof, I cannot take
any one's name. "

139
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,968
Those papers! Have you got
hold of them as yet?

140
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,804
"No, not as yet."

141
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,916
Is it not possible that after the
murder the proof is destroyed

142
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,248
"Yes, it is possible. But had the
papers reached here, one big..."

143
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,119
...smuggler of cocaine would
have been caught.

144
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,990
He has addicted the youth of our
nation to cocaine and...

145
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,325
...destroyed their lives!

146
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,427
That means that Mrs. Mehta's
suspicion is right.

147
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,162
Mr. Mehta's death was not an
accident but a murder!

148
00:17:54,039 --> 00:18:00,137
"Look at this! - Oh, God! This
was a murder, not an accident"

149
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:08,014
"Look, Mr. Mathur said, these
men are very dangerous, we "

150
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,917
...should'nt get involved in this.
- Even if he keeps killing...

151
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,920
...and plays with law.

152
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:24,491
"Look, there are more good people
and very few bad people, but..."

153
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:34,138
"...crimes are increasing. Cause is,
5 bad people keep doing wrongs."

154
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,808
..and a 100 people just read the
papers. They do nothing.

155
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:46,255
Don't inform the police in fear.
- I don't want to hear anything.

156
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:51,795
"Ram, I don't want you to get into
any danger. I'll burn the papers."

157
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,230
Laxmi...- I have said it once

158
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,799
"Before burning the papers,please
answer my question.- What!"

159
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,802
Look if in his place I was there.
- Don't frame such questions!

160
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:07,135
And while running I gave the
papers to someone & died.

161
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,307
"And you as his widow, and one
burns the proof, instead of..."

162
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:17,320
"...handing over to police, how
would you feel?"

163
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,485
Why are you quiet?
Give me an answer!

164
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,392
Today it was the reporter.
Tomorrow it could be me.

165
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,835
"Day after, it could be Raju.
This reporter did his duty."

166
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,941
"Before dying, gave this work
to an unknown person"

167
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,942
Should I not even fulfil
his last wish?

168
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:51,517
"Whole life, his face will keep
torturing me. What is the use..."

169
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:59,594
"... of this life, when a man can't
fulfill its duties. I can't do it."

170
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,611
"Well done, Mr Ram. Yesterday
only I judged that you are not..."

171
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,380
"...one of those, who forgets his
duties for his own welfare"

172
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,853
But if you ever need my help
do let me know immediately.

173
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,898
"Well my car is still in the
garage, you could take me..."

174
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,628
...to the police station.
- I knew you would make...

175
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,372
...such a mistake and so l
came after reading the news

176
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,273
"Look, Ram, it is not all that
simple - What do you mean?"

177
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,109
"Look, around every police station
there would be a watch kept..."

178
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:56,916
...by Jagmohans men at this time.
- Then what do you propose?

179
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,047
We will have to think
of a way!

180
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,462
Bandra Police Station!- There
has been a theft in our village

181
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,535
Write down the report.- When
did the theft take place?

182
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,533
Some two four days back.
- And you are reporting now?

183
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:23,480
Its my wish. I suffered the theft.
I can report whenever I want.

184
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,210
"All right, then come over to the
police station and file your report"

185
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,078
"Why should I come there, why
is the telephone here then? "

186
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,953
"l told you. If you want, come to
the police station. Understood?"

187
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:40,488
"Great! If you don't, I will
get you out of your job!"

188
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:45,569
"l see, so now you are threatening
me to oust me from my job!"

189
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,398
"lf you want to file a report,
come here. "

190
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,338
It will not be taken on
phone. Understood?

191
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,034
Who was this?
- Sir he...

192
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:58,172
I think he is the same person.
I will answer.

193
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,919
Inspector Sharma here!
- Who was that shameless...

194
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:06,514
....chap who put the phone down
when I was talking to him.

195
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,115
Please talk with respect.
What is your name?

196
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:12,823
"You are a public servant, and
you are teaching me manners!"

197
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,798
"When I come there, I will mention
such a name, you will quiver."

198
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:25,899
"l am coming running!
- Come on, I am waiting!"

199
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,144
Where is that police man who is
teaching me manners?

200
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,518
Where is he? I don't know.
- He is in his office.

201
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,397
Are you lnspector Sharma?
- Yes!-You asked my name

202
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:54,872
Then see this and read my name.
I pay 20 lakhs income tax.

203
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,231
Quiet
-Read it

204
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,076
Oh! Why did'nt you tell your
name before. Please come in.

205
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,945
Now you have understood!

206
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:12,482
Should I also tell you my name?
Don't just bully around!

207
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,451
By delivering these papers here
you have done a big job.

208
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:28,272
Your name? - Thakur Ram
Pratap Singh. Keep this.

209
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,507
I will this card keep with me. I
will ensure you do not have to...

210
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,340
....come to court. No one will
come to know of your name.

211
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,847
Thank you.
- In fact I should thank you!

212
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,893
"DlG sir, this is lnspector Sharma
here. There is some good news"

213
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,932
Papers and photos sent by
journalist Mehta have been found

214
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,441
"Really, how? - There was one
Thakur Ram Pratap to whom..."

215
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,044
...he gave the papers before he
died. He has handed them over.

216
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,908
"Good, who is this
famous culprit? "

217
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,442
It is Seth Jagmohan!

218
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,144
What are you saying Sharma.
He is a very respected citizen...

219
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,016
..of our society.
- I have all the proofs and...

220
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,384
...photos in front of me.
If you approve I'll arrest him.

221
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:23,326
"Sharma, give it one more thought
- Proof is very concrete, sir"

222
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,295
"All right, go ahead
and arrest him. "

223
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,400
"That means, police can
come here any time."

224
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,505
"Sir, why don't you go
abroad for some days. "

225
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:44,475
"No. By running the case can turn
to worse. Right now, they can..."

226
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,250
...only prove a case of
smuggling but not murder.

227
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,514
"But who is this Thakur
Rampratap Singh, who delivered..."

228
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,988
...the papers right up to the
police station.

229
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,989
"Sir, if you say so, I will find
him out and finish him. "

230
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:01,231
"Mr Juda, in your hurry you will
get all of us entrapped. "

231
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,933
This is a legal matter.

232
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,801
"Till such time, case is'nt decided
in this matter, we shouldn't do..."

233
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,170
...any thing against Ram pratap.

234
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,912
Coming out of this appears
difficult. I knew one day these...

235
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:23,579
"...papers may reach the police.
Lakhani, in case I lose the case..."

236
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:29,828
...you will control the operations
in my absence.

237
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,291
"Remember that,
no work should stop."

238
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,808
When did you come?

239
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,542
What are you gazing at
so quietly?

240
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,146
"l am looking at you,
daughter."

241
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:56,583
Ok. See me to your hearts
content. Here!

242
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,551
Can a father's heart ever be
full seeing his daughter?.

243
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,361
Papa! No other father can love
as much as you do.

244
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:12,136
"Look, you like urdu songs.
I have brought you some records."

245
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:18,169
You are really great.
We will listen to them together.

246
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,234
Now don't go away for some...
urgent work.

247
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,081
Urgent work has
somehow come!

248
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,356
Some good news.
- What happened?

249
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,535
There was a phone from Mathur
he was saying recording dates...

250
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,002
...have been finalised. And they
have decided to take out an...

251
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,265
...Album of mine!
- That is great news.

252
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:55,609
Today seems a good day...
- There is another good..

253
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:59,406
...news here. Listen!
- Whats it?

254
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,916
Jagmohan arrested in smuggling!
- Let us see!

255
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,416
"Good, the reporter's death
has not been a waste!"

256
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,460
"Sir, there is someone
to meet you. "

257
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:31,314
"What is all this, Papa?
Say all this is a big lie!"

258
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:38,319
Say that you're not a smuggler
Why don't you speak?

259
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:44,588
You didn't do any wrong or crime
Why were you brought here?

260
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:50,400
There must be some mistake.
Don't ever forgive the man...

261
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:56,440
"...who reported on you.
- Yes, daughter. I will not. "

262
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,807
"Quiet, daughter. I cannot see
tears in your eyes!"

263
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,238
How will I keep quiet after
seeing you in this condition?

264
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,785
Thakur Ram Pratap Singh!

265
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:55,360
"My lover! Don't go West or
East, just stay in my heart. "

266
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:14,147
"Don't go North or South,
but stay in my heart!"

267
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:52,284
All four directions lead
you abroad and...

268
00:29:52,557 --> 00:30:01,295
...those who go may
never return

269
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:10,534
Don't leave the house and
get deceived.

270
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,412
How is my daughter?

271
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,654
What to say? Day & night she
keeps asking about you.

272
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,360
She keeps seeing your photos.
She was very keen to come here.

273
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:09,057
No. Don't ever bring her here.
- There was a phone from...

274
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,159
...Seth Saxena. The news has
reached there also.

275
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:17,900
They're now unwilling to get
their son married to Komal.

276
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,006
They have broken the
engagement!

277
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,481
"lf you say so, I will finish off
Ram Pratap Singh. - No, no. "

278
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:36,823
Never! A person who has made
my daughter so miserable...

279
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,859
...he cannot go away so lightly.

280
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:47,633
"He should die in bits. Make his
life so miserable, that he..."

281
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,402
...should beg for his own death
and he can't die.

282
00:31:54,212 --> 00:32:00,344
For the moment send him
a small gift by evening

283
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:08,185
I have been singing
without practice till day

284
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,793
When I sing with practice
I will beat everyone.

285
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,132
"Great, before reaching home,
someone has sent me a bouquet."

286
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,311
It has a cassette. Perhaps your
songs are in it!

287
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:35,452
There is no shortage of music
lovers in this country.

288
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:37,952
"Let us hear music, son. "

289
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:46,823
"Let us listen to Papa's music,
mother-With care!-Listen now"

290
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:55,338
Congrats for earning my enemity.
I send you a gift. You thought...

291
00:32:55,506 --> 00:33:02,776
...you will live peacefully after
sending me to jail? That no one...

292
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:11,447
...will know your name or
address?

293
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,192
"Mr. Ram, You were wrong!"

294
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:25,365
"However your death may take
two years or more, so that..."

295
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:35,310
"...you have enough time to decide
the best type of death you,..."

296
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:43,444
...your wife and your small son
Raju would love to have

297
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:48,616
But I feel Raju is still...
small

298
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:55,163
He should not have any pain.
Hence instead...

299
00:33:55,366 --> 00:34:01,271
"...of putting him in boiling
oil, it is better to burn him"

300
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:08,471
"Ask Raju, if he'll
like to burn in a fire? "

301
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:15,278
Have you seen? I had stopped
you from involving in this.

302
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,857
But you wanted to correct the
society and become God in your...

303
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:24,220
...own eyes! Are you
satisfied now?

304
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:54,381
"Congrats, due to you, Jugmohan
has been imprisoned for 2 years."

305
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,496
What happened?
Is something wrong?

306
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,573
How did they come to know
about Ram Thakur.

307
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,243
Does he have any man in this
police station- Not possible

308
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:18,345
"Ram Thakur identity was known
only to me, and I only spoke to..."

309
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,417
...the DlG on the phone.

310
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,248
Are our telephones being tapped?
- Possible.

311
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:31,586
Do one thing. After 15 min ring
up from outside that Jagmohan..

312
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:37,597
...has committed suicide in
jail. If our phone is being...

313
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,802
...tapped they will ring up quickly
to Central Jail to find out!

314
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,132
I am going to Central Jail.

315
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,511
"Yes, speak! - Sir, he beat me
up after drinking. "

316
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,157
"This is Sub lnspector Dube, is Mr
Sharma there? - He is not."

317
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:06,787
"As soon as he comes, tell him,
Jagmohan has committed.."

318
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,991
...suicide in jail today.
- Oh my God! Suicide!!

319
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,238
Should I get some tea or coffee
for you. - No!

320
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,577
We have heard Seth Jagmohan
has committed suicide in Jail.

321
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,809
Is it true? - How do you know.
Who are you? Hello.

322
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,819
That was lnspector Sharma.

323
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,448
I told you there is something
fishy. Think before you telephone.

324
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,083
Now by your telephone lnspector
Sharma would have learnt that...

325
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:42,427
....police lines are being tapped.
Idiot!

326
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,364
"lnspector, you have come to
meet me? Is everything ok?"

327
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,966
Even after being caught in a cage
your pride has not gone.

328
00:36:56,013 --> 00:37:01,178
How can a lion forget to roar
even if he is in cage!

329
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,981
"Tell me, how did you require me
now? How do I serve you?"

330
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:08,023
Some of your men are still
outside the jail. As per your...

331
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,525
"...orders, they're tapping police
telephones and making threats..."

332
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:15,993
"...through tape. -I don't
understand, what you're saying. "

333
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,965
Who is being threatened?

334
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,831
Don't try and be clever
Jagmohan. You very well know...

335
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:24,101
...what I am talking about & who
is being threatened.

336
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:29,473
It will be good if there're no
threats or any harm done.

337
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,408
Else there won't be any one
worse than me.

338
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,920
"Jailor sir, how long do I have
to wait?"

339
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,462
You can go and meet him now.

340
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,799
Why did this lnspector Sharma
come here?-To show proof...

341
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:02,969
...of your foolishness. They found
you were tapping telephones.

342
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:07,517
"You know it, one small mistake
can take us to the gallows. "

343
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,156
How is Komal?
- She is very quiet.

344
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:23,026
She remains awake the whole
night. It looks she hasn't smiled...

345
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:28,434
...for ages. - And what do you
do? - Sir..

346
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:35,145
"She does'nt sleep, she is
unhappy, and you do nothing? "

347
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:41,842
You let those who destroy my
daughters happiness sleep happily

348
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:48,516
"Lakhani, one by one destroy their
sleep, their happiness. "

349
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:54,890
Snatch their smiles. Take away
their sleep! Create terror in them

350
00:38:55,032 --> 00:39:00,060
"l want to see, how lnspector
Sharma saves them"

351
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,821
Where is the tape?

352
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,820
"Friends can forget,
but not the enemies. "

353
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:38,895
How can we forget that
today is Ram's birthday.

354
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:45,362
"Ram, celebrate your present
birthday as much as you want."

355
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,599
For this day is not going to
recur.

356
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,979
"6 days later, it is your son
Raju's birthday on 10th December"

357
00:41:56,113 --> 00:42:04,213
"For him, a very big gift is
planned. You too will remember,..."

358
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:09,987
...what a gift it was.
A Time Bomb..

359
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,588
...which at this moment
is in his bed!

360
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:31,871
"Don't be afraid. This is just a
ball. But on birthday, not ball... "

361
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:35,008
...you will get a bomb!

362
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,127
What exactly do you desire?

363
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,027
"For their protection, I wish to
start a new security scheme. "

364
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:52,201
In US they have a Witness
Security Programme for the...

365
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:56,133
"...protection of witnesses, run by
the local police and the FBl. "

366
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,835
In this scheme the witness and
his family are given a new...

367
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:03,777
"...identity, new ration card and a
new name & allowed to settle..."

368
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:08,214
...in a new town & begin life
afresh. This way those against...

369
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,981
..whom he has given witness
can't threaten & spoil their lives

370
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,786
But who bears all the expenses?
- It is the Government.

371
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,863
But as it is we have a
shortage of funds.

372
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:25,431
"lf we can spend so much to
catch offenders, we must surely.."

373
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,902
...spend on the security of those
witnesses who risk everything...

374
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,801
...to help us catching
the offenders.

375
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:35,909
By this method in US many
witnesses took the courage and...

376
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,946
...gave vital proofs so that many
big offenders were caught.

377
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,382
In our country too we will be
able to put many big offenders...

378
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,922
"...in the dock, and at the same
time protect people like Ram. "

379
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:52,052
If we cannot protect Ram & his
family who will in future come...

380
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,290
...forward to give witness
and have enemity with criminals?

381
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,265
This scheme is very necessary
for their protection.

382
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:09,075
"Do you understand the meaning
of giving up one's name, forget..."

383
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,944
"...whatever one was doing, leave
one's friends and relatives..."

384
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,187
It is like dying for our own
people. This is not possible.

385
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:24,388
"This work is definitely difficult,
but not impossible. "

386
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:30,397
"Certainly there is a problem in
the beginning, but later one gets.."

387
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:35,233
"...used to it. And besides, once
the entire gang is caught, you..."

388
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:41,004
...can return and regain your
old name and identity.

389
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:45,839
You mean you can't protect a
family till the goons are caught

390
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:53,321
"Protection is the job of the
police, and it will continue to do"

391
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,858
But still people have watchmen
lock and bolt their doors and...

392
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,823
...keep themselves safe. This
Witness Protection Program...

393
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,865
...has also started for you only.

394
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,024
We want to help but if you don't
cooperate then...

395
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:08,367
"Even if we agree to go, what
will we tell our families."

396
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,872
...What will he tell his mother?

397
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:19,573
"Well, you can say you are getting
a better job and you have to go!"

398
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,843
"And in future also, you
might move."

399
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,517
You mean there will be no
telephones or mail and we...

400
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,788
...can't give them any news or
they won't get any newsfrom us

401
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:35,930
That they should get continuously
worried thinking we are lost.

402
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:41,201
Your scheme is totally
not acceptable to us.

403
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,933
"Look, please think
again of the proposal. "

404
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,838
This scheme can only
save you.

405
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:50,174
No thank you.
- All right.

406
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:05,122
"Mr. Ram, please synchonise
your watch. - Why?"

407
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,230
It is 5 to 5 now-Who are you?

408
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:12,063
This place is as far away from
Raju's school as your office.

409
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:18,897
"Let us see who reaches to
ake tyour son first, you or us!"

410
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,231
What is it? - Have all the
children gone? - Yes.

411
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,280
May I telephone
from here?

412
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:10,283
"Has Raju reached home? - No,
why? What is the matter? "

413
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,760
Quickly get to the
Bandra Police Station.

414
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:21,928
"Ram, where are we going?"

415
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,904
Where are we going?

416
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,116
I am lnspector Sharma
from Bandra Police Station.

417
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,786
"Just now, you called up and said
about a child who had..."

418
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,398
...met with an accident.
- He died a long time back!

419
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,037
Where is the body? - We have
sent it to the morgue

420
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:59,802
"Can we see it?-Savant, Show
them no. 13 in the morgue. "

421
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:36,001
"Mr Thakur, I promise you, l
won't spare any effort. I mean it"

422
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,854
Mr Thakur!
- Where is my Raju?

423
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:01,458
You are unnecessarily searching
the whole town.

424
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,364
Your Raju is near you.
- Where is he?

425
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,837
The area behind your house.

426
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:52,438
"Where am l? Mother,
save me, they are after me. "

427
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,143
Save me!

428
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:04,784
"lnspector, your scheme
is acceptable to us. "

429
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,560
"Amit Gupta, Asha Gupta and
Sunil Gupta, your new names."

430
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:13,600
"And these are birth certificates,
ration and other documents"

431
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,396
Keep these. After two days
under your old...

432
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,374
"...names you will proceed towards
Botswana, Africa. "

433
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,174
"lnstead of boarding the Botswana
flight, a car will take you to..."

434
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:31,184
...the Bangalore flight. Your
baggage under your new name...

435
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,257
...would have already reached
there. The travel agent's car...

436
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,417
...will take you to Ooty where
a bungalow has been arranged

437
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:43,962
What will we do in Ooty?
- There is a small chemical...

438
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,298
...factory up for sale. Loan
sanction has also been arranged.

439
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:52,397
"And yes, in this file, my private
telephone no. is there"

440
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,170
Call yourself Amrit and speak.
But please don't call your...

441
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,371
...relatives or friends

442
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,112
I will take leave now.

443
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:08,791
And one more thing. The
recording company has not put...

444
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:12,190
"...your photo on your album, but
your name is there. And your..."

445
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:16,561
...voice too can be recognised.
So please do not ever sing.

446
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,211
I myself saw them going in the
van for the Botswana flight.

447
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,143
And you took it that they
have gone to Botswana!

448
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,306
What else! Could I have gone
with them.

449
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,246
Your job was to keep watch
on them.

450
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,212
They have not reached Botswana.
Where have they gone?

451
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,323
"Ok, they havn't reached. I was
saying that we should finish..."

452
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,925
...them once for all. But you
kept saying no.

453
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:49,827
"Mr Juda, don't forget that I'm Ur
boss now. Talk with respect. "

454
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:06,114
Here! Today you got late again.
- What to do. The work is new.

455
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,784
It takes time.
It is not that easy.

456
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:20,927
Raju...-Raju is at Mr Shah's
place playing with his son.

457
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:33,604
What did you do the whole day?
- What is there. Just settling...

458
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,104
...down in the new place.
And there are no letters or...

459
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,578
...any post that some time
will pass waiting for it.

460
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:46,855
I never thought that by changing
names so much will change.

461
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:56,421
Don't get worried. Everything is
new. I will get used to it.

462
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,002
"Come refresh yourself,
You must be tired."

463
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:05,506
"Where were you little Thakur?
-I was playing. Playing there,..."

464
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:09,836
..time passes off very well.
- Really! - Yes.

465
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:15,412
You know what he calls me.
- What?

466
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,247
Absent minded professor.

467
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,584
You see he does not know my
actual name. Nor am I used to...

468
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:25,793
"...my new name. So when he calls
me, I feel he is calling some..."

469
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:30,593
...one else. It is great fun. I am
going up now.

470
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,798
Children are better than us

471
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:43,074
"He has no sorrow of the past,
not the worry of tomorrow. "

472
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,239
"Sir, there is a bad news.
- What is it? "

473
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,819
"Today morning, Ram's mother
passed away. "

474
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:59,218
"On her last breath,
she was asking for Ram. "

475
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,531
Ram too loved his mother.
While going he said that l...

476
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,796
...should keep him informed of
his mother's health.

477
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:15,138
Now how should I tell him that
his mother died...

478
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:20,381
...remembering him to the last.
Now he will not be able to...

479
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:22,314
...pay her his last visit.

480
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,893
Is Mr Gupta there?
- Who is speaking?

481
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,829
Inspector Sharma.
- I hope all is well.

482
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:45,130
I am going to give you some bad
news. Please fortify yourself.

483
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,405
"What is it?
- The day before,..."

484
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,276
...your husband's mother
passed away. -What?

485
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:00,821
Whose phone is that?

486
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:25,078
"Mr Gupta, this is lnspector
Sharma. - Yes, go ahead. "

487
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,911
I am sorry to inform you that
the day before your mother...

488
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,542
...passed away.

489
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,456
And you are informing
me today!

490
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,528
I didn't want you
to come here.

491
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:49,496
Can't I go and be there for
my mother's death too?

492
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:08,813
We couldn't see her even in her
death bed.

493
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,291
"Sharma, did you read today's
papers? - No. "

494
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,527
Is there anything special?

495
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,266
The minister has given a
statement in the assembly...

496
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,302
...today. He has informed the
assembly about the witness..

497
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,377
"...protection scheme.
- How has he done it,..."

498
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,877
"...it was to be a confidential
service, & can be harmful"

499
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:36,884
"l know. But in democracy, nothing
can be hidden for long."

500
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,046
This may help the culprits.
So you remain alert.

501
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,114
As this news would've reached
those searching for him too.

502
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,989
Congratulations on your birthday
A man's heart should be young...

503
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,432
...always. Age does not matter!

504
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:57,061
"lt is not my birthday,
it is of my daughter!"

505
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,267
"l see, of the daughter!
Then it is all right."

506
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:07,182
Come come.- Greetings to you.
-Come son

507
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:15,986
"Mr Gupta, this is Mr Sehgal, and
this Mr & Mrs Subramanium. "

508
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:24,028
He is a great music critic. He
can make or break careers.

509
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,327
"So whose song are you
making us listen to, today."

510
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,096
"There was a voice. There was
great strength in it, but after..."

511
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,835
"...few songs, he dissappeared.
Then we never got such a voice"

512
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:37,378
You are very right!
- Whom are you talking of?

513
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,142
He is talking of Ram Thakur!

514
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:44,944
We're his fans. Every evening we
used to listen to his songs

515
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,987
"Then what are we waiting for?
- Sure, we will put the record. "

516
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:54,291
I will say something more. Ram
Thakur used to write himself.

517
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:58,593
In this he has described the pain
of a wife whose husband...

518
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,530
...remains most of the time
abroad.

519
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:41,341
"Lover, don't go west, nor to
the east, stay in my heart. "

520
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:59,861
"Don't go North, nor to the
South, but stay in my heart!"

521
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:40,565
"All directions go abroad,
but the one who went..."

522
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:48,242
...abroad does not return.

523
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:57,147
Don't get out of the house
and get deceived.

524
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:41,887
He used to come to the
banks of the river

525
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:54,366
And Radha used to
come to fetch the water.

526
01:01:54,510 --> 01:02:00,244
The player of flute..

527
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:03,982
How did this current go?

528
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:36,819
"My dear, don't go south or north
but live in my heart"

529
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:56,832
Let us light these candles
throughout the night

530
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:06,176
Listen something from my side
and tell me some yourself

531
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:15,019
Don't go west nor to the east.
Just stay in my heart.

532
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:33,601
"Lover, don't go North, nor to the
South, just stay in my heart!"

533
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,987
I told him not to sing. He has
wasted all my efforts.

534
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,386
If Jagmohan reads this news...

535
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,857
Today Jagmohan is being
released from Jail.-I know

536
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,292
But we have to
somehow stop it

537
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,555
How is this possible?

538
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:18,848
"l have returned, kid. "

539
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,439
"Jagmohan, there is one good
news. "

540
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:47,374
"ln Ooty, a music critic has
written that had the singer..."

541
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:53,421
"...not given his name as Amrit,
he would have thought that..."

542
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:59,291
...famous Ram Pratap Singh
was singing who had...

543
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:03,760
...suddenly dissappeared from
the music world

544
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:21,976
Thank God I read that news and
reached here on time.

545
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:30,256
"l will get down first, but Dubey
will accompany me. "

546
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:34,387
"Your new names are Peter
Martis, Freddie and Tony Martis"

547
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:38,797
Christians? - We only got these
names in a hurry.

548
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,800
You mean we will
have to change our religion

549
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:46,466
No. Its only because Jagmohan's
men are on the look out for you..

550
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:53,146
...and it will not be safe for
you to go to a temple...

551
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:59,243
...and a christian name will help
you to hide your true identity.

552
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:07,393
One more thing. Instead of your
sacred marriage thread round...

553
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:11,489
"...your neck, please put on this.
Christians don't put on that..."

554
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:18,900
...thread nor do they put on
vermillion. Please don't use them

555
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:24,408
What are you saying. All these
are a mark of my marital status!

556
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:25,844
I can't do all this!

557
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:29,279
These marks can't be greater
than your husband itself.

558
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:38,291
"Their names are Peter Martis,
Fredie Martis and Tony Martis. "

559
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,055
"Yes, they are christians.
- But how did you come to.."

560
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:44,430
...know their names?

561
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:51,968
It is a matter of brains.
Ram has many names.

562
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:58,235
"But behind all names is only one,
that is lnspector Sharma."

563
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:03,348
So I put some men on his
trail.

564
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:07,820
"When he goes to the registrar of
births and deaths, my man just..."

565
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:13,360
...follows him. They take hours
to find new names and in...

566
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,759
...minutes we get to know
about it.

567
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:21,226
"Now, he may change his names
any number of times, in future..."

568
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,201
...will come to know the latest
even before Ram does.

569
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:28,299
There is no need to be afraid.
But he needs rest. Weather is...

570
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,346
...bad outside. So please be
with him till he gets alright

571
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,045
I will go now.

572
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:48,128
"Martis sir, phone for you.
- For me? - Yes. "

573
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,559
It must be Sharma's.

574
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:12,084
I hope you had a comfortable
journey - Sorry. I can't place U.

575
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:17,217
"Perhaps you have forgotten us.
How can we forget Peter Martis,"

576
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:23,821
...or Amrit Gupta or Thakur
Ram Pratap Singh.

577
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,962
"No matter how many names you
change, or how many places... "

578
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,766
"...you change, we will
never leave you. "

579
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:32,165
What do you want finally?

580
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:38,202
"You have put your hand in a
beehive, Thakur. Now whereever..."

581
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:43,785
"...you go, the bees will not
leave you. No one can save you."

582
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:46,845
Then lift your gun and kill all
three of us!

583
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:55,523
"l could've done it long back, but
I will torture you and kill you "

584
01:08:55,865 --> 01:09:00,029
"Please, Jagmohan Seth. My child
is very sick. Please!"

585
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:03,128
You have started
pleading so soon

586
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,999
My game has just started.

587
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:17,150
Whose telephone was it?
- Seth Jagmohun.

588
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,454
Go inside and I will just
return after a phone call.

589
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:43,409
"Ram, what happened?
- Jagmohan knows everything!"

590
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:50,508
What! -lnstead of this torture
why not we commit suicide.

591
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:53,521
"Don't lose heart, and don't think
like that at all"

592
01:09:56,392 --> 01:10:02,490
I don't see a way.
We can't do anything

593
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:08,534
I can't even give a day's rest
to our sick son.

594
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:20,941
After all what have I done?
It's only that I fulfilled my duty.

595
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:26,818
"l listened to my conscience, and
for that so big a punishment!"

596
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:36,593
I heard truth always prevails.
Truth is also defended by God.

597
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:44,965
There is no such thing. God
is dead! He is dead.

598
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:54,541
"Listen, quickly vacate this place.
Go down this hill and you will..."

599
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,149
...find an Ambassador Car. The
number is 3786.

600
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:58,845
Here are the keys!

601
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:02,788
Where will we go? - Highway.
Maddy...I will meet you there

602
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,789
You took a long time. What
should I tell my Sir?

603
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:20,959
Raju is not well and we
had to go to a Doctor.

604
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,938
"Papa, I am all right now."

605
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:27,131
You please go inside and rest.
Mr Sharma must be coming now.

606
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:55,034
Is Sharma uncle getting me
another new name. - Yes!

607
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,329
What will be my new name?

608
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:06,070
"Tell me, Papa!
- I do not know."

609
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:18,157
"Papa, when I become your age,
I would have forgotten my true...."

610
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:22,821
...name. I might not have
any name by then.

611
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:51,355
Name is all important. Name
does'nt eat or drink.

612
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:56,988
"No sword can cut it, no gun
can destroy it. Even death can't..."

613
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:04,163
"... take it. In our race, for the
sake of name, people have died."

614
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:10,303
One who lives for his name an
dies for it is a real man

615
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,849
"One without name is like a
rats, cats etc."

616
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,979
"Death is better, than living
without a name!"

617
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:39,206
I am sorry Ram. I came to know
that your Christian identity too...

618
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:44,142
...has been compromised. I have
changed my techniques. Now they.

619
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:48,443
...will never come to know of
your identity. Your new names...

620
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:49,881
"...are Mohammed Hussain,
Salma Hussain & Fida Hussain. "

621
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:57,859
Why are you people so quiet?
- You have done a lot. Now...

622
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:04,762
...do us one final favor.
- Final favor? - Yes!

623
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:10,160
Now onwards do nothing for us.
Take back all our names and...

624
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:16,069
...give us our true names!
- What are you saying?

625
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:19,772
"Yes, lnspector he is right!
- You too!"

626
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:25,078
Yes. Till when we'll change
names and run from death.

627
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:28,213
One day we'll tire out and face
death- Everyone has to die...

628
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:35,486
...one day! But does it mean we
stop fighting death or living

629
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:46,197
We've stopped living long back.
See his condition in these 2 yrs

630
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,967
It looks as if we have been
punished and not Jagmohan

631
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:56,243
He can atleast sleep peacefully
in jail. But here we're facing..

632
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,912
...constant threat and tension
and running continuously

633
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:08,496
"You've snatched our peace, name
our relatives, religion, all..."

634
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:12,933
You have made us cowards. You
have made us fall in our son's...

635
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:17,903
...eyes! I cannot stay
further like this.

636
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:23,974
"But without our support, you
have no chance to survive. "

637
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:29,311
Whom are you trying to save?
- Save? I do not understand.

638
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:37,118
"Whom are you saving? Ram, Mr
Gupta, Peter or Md Hussain?"

639
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:43,095
These three are one only. These
names were given to save you.

640
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:43,788
No. Inspector.

641
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:52,067
All these names have not saved
Thakur Ram Pratap but have...

642
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,038
...in fact destroyed him.

643
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:58,371
You have finished him. And in his
place resides a man who takes..

644
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:02,281
"...the names of dead persons
so that he can live. From today,.."

645
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,011
...I will not live on the names of
dead persons!

646
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:12,154
From today if anyone lives he
will be Thakur Ram Pratap Singh.

647
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:16,327
And if anyone dies it will be
only Thakur Ram Pratap but...

648
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:21,301
"in his name, not on anyone's
else's name!- But..."

649
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,438
"There is no scope for any buts,
lnspector. "

650
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:27,839
Thakur Ram Pratap Singh has
made his decision.

651
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,571
He does not need any
help from you.

652
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,448
"lnspector Sharma, you can go!"

653
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:54,199
"See, at this time you people are
very upset. I will come again. "

654
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,190
"Brother, where are you going up
to? - We are going to Mumbai."

655
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:25,232
What is your good name?

656
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:35,400
My name is Thakur Ram Pratap
Singh.

657
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:39,039
Are you the same famous
singer - Yes!!

658
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:48,385
We will live if we have to.
And we will die if we have to.

659
01:18:48,557 --> 01:19:00,992
We have decided what we
have to do now.

660
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:06,231
"We will live by our name,
and we will die by our name."

661
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:13,173
"lf we have to live we will,
if we have to die we will."

662
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:20,147
We have decided what we
have to do now!

663
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:17,269
For long we kept getting scared.
-We kept drowning in a stream.

664
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:25,447
We will die surely one day
- but we kept dying each day!

665
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:33,087
"We are not afraid of death,
death should be afraid of us."

666
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:17,098
Our fate was bad then
-We had chains on our feet.

667
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:23,576
We had a life In our hands
-They were faded pictures

668
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:33,253
"And in these faded pictures,
we have to add our own colors."

669
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:27,236
"Mr. Mathur, you had once told a
friend that he should call you...."

670
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:29,509
...whenever he needs your help.
you remember.

671
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:33,377
"l never forget my promises,
Thakur Ram Pratap Singh"

672
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:38,077
The doors to my house are
always open for you

673
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:44,382
"l am very happy that instead of
running away like a jackal, you.."

674
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:48,223
...have decided to stand and fight
like a tiger!

675
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:53,900
"But Ram, just bravery is not
enough. In war, preparation and..."

676
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:56,060
...planning have a lot of
importance.

677
01:22:56,171 --> 01:23:01,404
Have you thought about it?
- Yes. - What?

678
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:11,145
"All this while I was running
away, for I was afraid of him."

679
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:17,316
The question is why should one
man be afraid of the other!

680
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:25,166
I was'nt scared that he will kill
me but feared what'll happen to..

681
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:30,934
...my wife and child if I die or
he will harm them somehow.

682
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:31,404
That was my weakness!

683
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:42,347
"Like this, every man has some
weakness or the other. And the..."

684
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:43,949
...same can be the cause of his
being afraid.

685
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:51,491
"Exactly like this, Jagmohan must
be having some weakness or..."

686
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:56,563
...the other.
- He has. His young daughter.

687
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:59,831
The one on whom he dotes.
& can't live without her

688
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:05,567
This is his weakness. But U'll
be finished before reaching er.h

689
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:10,000
"When people can reach the
President of America, what is...."

690
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:14,081
"...the problem of reaching
Jagmohan, but I need special help"

691
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:17,878
But I need some one who can
give me all the information...

692
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:20,317
...about Jagmohan and his men.

693
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:29,396
I have one man in sight.
My friend Murthy

694
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,531
"What is the matter, how can l
help you. - Ram, you tell. "

695
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:39,839
I need information about one man
and the people around him.

696
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:41,602
What type of information?

697
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:46,346
"Where they stay, where do
they go and their weaknesses. "

698
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,141
Your work will be done!

699
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:03,525
And this is Lakhani

700
01:25:04,564 --> 01:25:08,227
Jagmohan's Manager and
his brain

701
01:25:08,535 --> 01:25:13,529
"And his strength. Till he is with
Jagmohan, noone can harm him."

702
01:25:14,574 --> 01:25:17,475
"He must have someone else too.
-Yes, one beautiful young widow"

703
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:23,811
The credit for making her a
widow also goes to him only

704
01:25:24,117 --> 01:25:28,110
Meaning!-Her husband was
wrongly blamed for a murder

705
01:25:29,122 --> 01:25:31,249
He could've been saved easily.
But he defended this case so...

706
01:25:31,391 --> 01:25:34,326
...badly that the poor man was
sentenced to death.

707
01:25:34,461 --> 01:25:37,624
"After that, his career as a
lawyer was finished..."

708
01:25:37,764 --> 01:25:39,493
...and he started this work.
-Where is that widow?

709
01:25:49,576 --> 01:25:50,668
Who will say that you
are a widow?

710
01:25:51,745 --> 01:25:56,182
Raise your hands up!
Raise your hands...

711
01:25:57,317 --> 01:25:58,545
Who are you?

712
01:25:59,519 --> 01:26:00,577
What do you want

713
01:26:01,488 --> 01:26:07,552
This body and youth can spoil
anyone's habits.

714
01:26:07,827 --> 01:26:10,523
Do you need money?
How much!

715
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:18,463
Do you eat fish?
Do you eat!

716
01:26:21,608 --> 01:26:23,235
"Yes, I eat
-Do you like it?"

717
01:26:25,378 --> 01:26:31,339
Yes - Even the fishes will
like your body a lot

718
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:39,786
I will make this into many pieces
and feed the fishes

719
01:26:40,193 --> 01:26:45,256
"No! You take howmuchever
money U want, but don't kill me"

720
01:26:45,498 --> 01:26:55,305
"l also don't wish that, but Seth
Jagmohan wants your corpse"

721
01:26:55,442 --> 01:26:58,070
But I did'nt do anything

722
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:04,611
You did'nt do! - No! - Then how
did you get this big bungalow?

723
01:27:15,862 --> 01:27:22,563
"Tell, from where you
got this bungalow? Tell me"

724
01:27:22,702 --> 01:27:26,263
Lakhani gave this to me
-What else did he give?

725
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:30,100
A bungalow in Kolkata- And...
-10 lakhs-And then...-Some gold.

726
01:27:34,247 --> 01:27:41,915
Do you know that all this
money belongs to Seth Jagmohan

727
01:27:43,256 --> 01:27:43,847
I know that

728
01:27:51,865 --> 01:27:54,732
You & Lakhani have jointly looted
Seth Jagmohan...

729
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:03,098
Shall I pierce this knife in your
body - Please forgive me...

730
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:10,277
"For god's same, forgive me
and save me. Please save me"

731
01:28:11,584 --> 01:28:16,248
Only one man can save you and
that is Seth Jagmohan

732
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:27,457
"Sir, she is a liar and
characterless"

733
01:28:27,734 --> 01:28:32,330
I don't know her at all
-You don't know her

734
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:39,902
You know all about her that she
is a liar & characterless. Is'nt it?

735
01:28:43,516 --> 01:28:50,217
"Sir, I got deceived by this
woman"

736
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:53,755
I have served you for
twenty years.

737
01:28:54,394 --> 01:28:56,589
Please forgive me

738
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:59,122
"Yes, I can forgive you"

739
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:03,863
But just for twenty minutes.

740
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:11,301
"Yes, you take your life as far
away as possible from death..."

741
01:29:11,411 --> 01:29:12,503
...within these 20 minutes

742
01:29:13,313 --> 01:29:16,771
"Exactly after 20 minutes, Tiger
will start from here"

743
01:29:17,116 --> 01:29:19,380
He will carry your death
in his hands

744
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:23,347
Run as far as you can

745
01:29:24,757 --> 01:29:27,624
Now it is exactly 8 O'clock

746
01:29:28,461 --> 01:29:32,295
"Jagmohan, I have served you
throughout my life."

747
01:29:34,767 --> 01:29:37,827
"This is my first mistake,
please forgive me."

748
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,467
Twenty seconds have been lost in
those twenty minutes

749
01:29:47,447 --> 01:29:58,381
"But, assure you that this mistake
will never be repeated again"

750
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:01,657
Twenty more seconds have
been reduced.

751
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:06,131
"Sir Jagmohan, there must
be some way out."

752
01:30:06,633 --> 01:30:12,196
Think again and please forgive
my mistakes. Forgive me...

753
01:30:13,306 --> 01:30:16,104
Only 19 minutes are left now.
Go now.

754
01:30:16,809 --> 01:30:18,470
Run away.

755
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:38,857
Shall I leave...

756
01:30:48,374 --> 01:30:52,674
You won't need the bullets. He
will die on his own due to fear

757
01:33:01,808 --> 01:33:05,710
"Tiger, you wicked fellow...
dog of Jagmohan..."

758
01:33:06,412 --> 01:33:08,107
...I won't leave you alive

759
01:33:08,414 --> 01:33:11,713
I will cut you into pieces.

760
01:33:12,151 --> 01:33:16,110
I will kill you before I die.

761
01:33:16,556 --> 01:33:23,155
"l will not leave you alive, Tiger
You wicked fellow..."

762
01:33:23,629 --> 01:33:26,462
"Your telegram, sir"

763
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:27,082
Tell me now- Lakhani died of
heart attack

764
01:34:31,497 --> 01:34:34,432
"Yes, tell me something
about Tiger"

765
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:37,330
That man will kill anyone
for the sake of money

766
01:34:37,537 --> 01:34:41,769
Neither he thinks nor gives time
for anyone to think.

767
01:34:41,874 --> 01:34:47,073
He is Judo's special man
-Anything else..-He has no...

768
01:34:47,747 --> 01:34:50,147
...house or bank property. How
he keeps his money is not known

769
01:34:50,249 --> 01:34:55,551
"Any weakness - One beautiful
Cabarat artist, Anne who..."

770
01:34:55,621 --> 01:35:00,081
...stays alone in Hotel Sawai
in Room No. 823

771
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,653
Tiger spends every evening
with her only.

772
01:35:04,096 --> 01:35:04,824
I shall leave now.

773
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:06,592
Why so soon...

774
01:35:06,866 --> 01:35:09,300
I have to go out for some work.
I will come tomorrow

775
01:35:09,769 --> 01:35:14,672
How is this possible?
How will I be without you?

776
01:36:58,611 --> 01:36:59,100
What is this?

777
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:13,858
"Darling, I am always scared
that Tiger will come to know "

778
01:37:14,226 --> 01:37:18,822
Don't you worry! I have sent
him for such a work...

779
01:37:19,098 --> 01:37:21,191
...that he can't return till
tomorrow-You are a genius

780
01:37:22,568 --> 01:37:23,500
She is sinking both of them.

781
01:37:24,537 --> 01:37:27,700
You have the camera.
Come now...

782
01:38:28,167 --> 01:38:32,160
"Mr. Juda, Tiger is coming
to kill you"

783
01:38:33,806 --> 01:38:36,798
He has learnt everything about
you and Anny

784
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:40,243
But who are you?
-I am the enemy of Tiger

785
01:40:29,822 --> 01:40:33,815
"Good, keep hanging like
this only."

786
01:40:52,778 --> 01:40:55,542
Why are you standing here?
Who will look after food?

787
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:56,376
"Go- Ok, sir"

788
01:40:57,483 --> 01:40:58,142
Bring carefully

789
01:41:01,353 --> 01:41:02,251
You have come.
Welcome...

790
01:41:07,393 --> 01:41:10,055
Most beautiful cake for the most
beautiful girl in the world.

791
01:41:10,696 --> 01:41:12,721
18 candles are looking
very beautiful

792
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:14,525
"Carefully, brother.
Stop here..."

793
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:19,303
"Sir, Both Judo and Tiger
have been killed"

794
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:23,608
"What?-Yes, both the corpses
have been found in Judo's house"

795
01:41:24,176 --> 01:41:26,542
Someone has gunned them down
Police are investigating...

796
01:41:39,491 --> 01:41:44,554
Mary...-Yes sir- Where is baby?
-She has gone to beauty parlour

797
01:41:44,697 --> 01:41:47,860
...for her hairdo. - What is the
telephone no. there-I don't know

798
01:41:48,167 --> 01:41:49,156
"Find out, then"

799
01:42:23,569 --> 01:42:25,332
Come exactly at 5 O'clock

800
01:42:49,094 --> 01:42:51,585
"Miss Komal, police have come to
your house - Police!"

801
01:42:52,064 --> 01:42:55,556
You have been called home
immediately

802
01:42:55,768 --> 01:42:58,259
But why!- Something must be
there. Come now...

803
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:04,439
"Miss Komal, there is a call from
your house."

804
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:06,334
"Tell them, she is coming
home now"

805
01:43:16,522 --> 01:43:17,318
Please come

806
01:43:18,157 --> 01:43:21,217
"But this is not our car.
-Yes, come- Who are you?"

807
01:43:25,464 --> 01:43:26,692
Who are you?

808
01:43:31,837 --> 01:43:33,202
Where are you taking me?
Leave me...

809
01:43:41,714 --> 01:43:46,083
"Sir, I was told to come at
5 O'clock to the beauty parlour"

810
01:43:46,218 --> 01:43:49,278
"But when I went there, somebody
had picked her up before-What?"

811
01:43:49,421 --> 01:43:52,413
He has said that police has
come here and she has...

812
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:53,014
...been called home urgently.

813
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:56,328
"Fool, why did you leave
her and go? Why did you go?"

814
01:43:58,697 --> 01:44:02,030
Search every nook and corner of
the city. My daughter should...

815
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:06,263
...be with me within an hour.
Go...

816
01:44:16,582 --> 01:44:20,143
I am Jagmohan here. Someone
has kidnapped my daughter today

817
01:44:20,285 --> 01:44:23,482
I need your help today

818
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:28,423
Take all your men and
find my daughter somehow.

819
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:30,119
I will never forget your favour

820
01:44:31,864 --> 01:44:35,493
"Karimbhai, you will get the full
agency for Maharashtra..."

821
01:44:35,768 --> 01:44:37,633
...if you will do this work
for me

822
01:45:51,076 --> 01:45:58,482
"Jagmohan, you are searching for
me desparately. Here I am now."

823
01:45:58,684 --> 01:46:07,183
"Did you recognize me? If you've
forgotten, let me tell you."

824
01:46:07,793 --> 01:46:11,229
My name is Thakur Ram
Pratap Singh alias...

825
01:46:14,099 --> 01:46:20,868
"..Ramdas Gupta, Martin,
Mohammed etc..."

826
01:46:21,173 --> 01:46:26,702
I am here to answer your
every query.

827
01:46:29,515 --> 01:46:32,609
You like very much to talk
through the tape.

828
01:46:33,285 --> 01:46:35,344
I have also adopted the
same procedure.

829
01:46:36,688 --> 01:46:41,489
You must be very anxious to
know about your daughter

830
01:46:43,795 --> 01:46:44,887
She is with me

831
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:47,924
She is here only
In the other room.

832
01:46:48,433 --> 01:46:51,129
"Today is her birthday,
is'nt it?"

833
01:46:51,203 --> 01:46:53,330
Congratulations for
your daughter's birthday.

834
01:46:58,143 --> 01:47:04,707
I have organized a special gift
for Seth Jagmohan's daughter

835
01:47:09,321 --> 01:47:12,188
See this! You must be surely
recognizing this.

836
01:47:14,526 --> 01:47:18,394
This is your own product which
you have been presenting to...

837
01:47:18,463 --> 01:47:22,559
...the youth of this country
for many years.

838
01:47:23,735 --> 01:47:25,532
Cocaine...
-You bastard...

839
01:47:25,837 --> 01:47:31,798
Will something happen if you
abuse me or get angry?

840
01:47:32,177 --> 01:47:35,635
Today is a happy day. Let
us celebrate her birthday.

841
01:47:41,853 --> 01:47:42,512
I will kill you.

842
01:47:52,531 --> 01:47:55,557
"Baby...- Scoundrel, why have
you brought me here?"

843
01:47:55,801 --> 01:48:00,670
"You only want money, is'nt it?
1 lakh, 2, phone my father..."

844
01:48:00,806 --> 01:48:05,266
...he will bring it immediately.
Please allow me to go from here

845
01:48:05,444 --> 01:48:08,538
Let me go to my father.
-Come on..

846
01:48:08,814 --> 01:48:14,753
How will I allow you to go so
easily?-You don't know my dad.

847
01:48:15,187 --> 01:48:17,849
I know him very well. I've just
stolen the light of his eyes.

848
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:24,726
"Take this small dose of cocaine
injectin- Don't trouble me, please"

849
01:48:24,796 --> 01:48:29,460
No-Don't be scared. Nothing will
happen except little intoxication

850
01:48:29,601 --> 01:48:35,631
Then you will get nice sleep -No
-Then you will get used to this

851
01:48:35,774 --> 01:48:39,369
"Then, another life will
get destroyed"

852
01:48:40,379 --> 01:48:41,107
Papa....

853
01:49:09,641 --> 01:49:11,734
Where is Ram?
-He has gone outside.

854
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:19,682
When will he come back?
-I can't say anything. Please sit

855
01:49:20,819 --> 01:49:24,380
You just tell him that I won't
help him in anyway after today

856
01:49:24,523 --> 01:49:30,291
But what happened!- I thought
that Thakur is a gentleman...

857
01:49:30,395 --> 01:49:34,331
... but not a criminal.
-I did'nt understand

858
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:37,334
Jagmohan's three men have been
killed. His daughter has...

859
01:49:37,469 --> 01:49:39,266
...been kidnapped and she is
being given cocaine injection.

860
01:49:39,371 --> 01:49:42,397
Ram has taken law into his
hands and become a criminal

861
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:47,342
And I can't give support
to any criminal. Tell him

862
01:49:58,457 --> 01:50:06,694
Heard that Jagmohan's men have
died & his daughter is...

863
01:50:06,832 --> 01:50:10,393
...kidnapped and she is being
given drug injection

864
01:50:14,439 --> 01:50:16,634
I am telling you something

865
01:50:17,275 --> 01:50:21,541
I am listening
-ls this true?

866
01:50:24,616 --> 01:50:31,078
Who told you?-I just asked
whether this matter is true.

867
01:50:33,759 --> 01:50:38,128
"Yes, it is true, you speak now.
-Are you getting diverted in life?"

868
01:50:38,263 --> 01:50:42,290
"Are you yourself becoming
a criminal, in this continuous..."

869
01:50:42,768 --> 01:50:46,534
...fight with another criminal.
Are you taking the wrong steps...

870
01:50:46,638 --> 01:50:49,903
...in this war of right & wrong
-There is only defeat or loss...

871
01:50:50,342 --> 01:50:53,505
...in a war. One who wins is
right and the other is wrong.

872
01:50:54,279 --> 01:50:58,147
I never knew that you will forget
the difference between right and..

873
01:50:58,283 --> 01:51:02,617
...wrong one day.-What do you
want now. - What is the...

874
01:51:02,754 --> 01:51:06,815
...difference between you and
Jagmohan? He also kills anyone...

875
01:51:07,125 --> 01:51:12,495
"...or kidnaps anyone. Now, you
are also doing the same thing"

876
01:51:12,631 --> 01:51:17,364
"Another Jagmohan has come now
-Yes, I am like Jagmohan only"

877
01:51:17,435 --> 01:51:22,737
"What do you say?- I also have
to say that, I still understand..."

878
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:25,867
...the difference between right
and wrong and will oppose a...

879
01:51:26,144 --> 01:51:29,545
"...criminal, even if he is my
husband. That is it."

880
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:18,825
"Doctor, who had called
you to come here."

881
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:22,861
"Let it be. You need rest
very badly. Rest, please"

882
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:31,239
Hello- Atleast thank me.
-You...

883
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:36,105
I sent your family doctor to your
house & also medicine in his bag

884
01:52:36,281 --> 01:52:37,077
Did you get it?

885
01:52:45,757 --> 01:52:47,156
How did this come
in my bag?

886
01:52:50,328 --> 01:52:53,729
"You go now- What has happened
to you suddenly, Jagmohan?"

887
01:52:53,832 --> 01:52:55,493
Nothing. I need rest very badly.
You go now.

888
01:53:13,351 --> 01:53:18,687
"Jagmohan, I have to tell this
with great sorrow that your..."

889
01:53:19,157 --> 01:53:27,587
"...daughter is very sick. Trust
me, I did'nt do anything"

890
01:53:27,832 --> 01:53:34,670
She is not able to eat anything.
Is this is the effect of Cocaine

891
01:53:35,473 --> 01:53:38,567
I give her injection only thrice in
a day

892
01:53:40,245 --> 01:53:42,713
Is this a very high dose?

893
01:53:43,581 --> 01:53:46,379
"l am not aware, as to how
much dose should be given"

894
01:53:47,185 --> 01:53:54,489
I don't know what to do. I can't
even show to the doctor.

895
01:53:56,494 --> 01:53:59,486
You yourself see
her condition

896
01:54:53,885 --> 01:55:01,883
What is it?-Please give back my
daughter to me. Don't give her...

897
01:55:02,527 --> 01:55:10,593
...more pain. I am ready to do
whatever you tell me to do.

898
01:55:11,503 --> 01:55:15,564
"l am ready to accept all my sins
-lf you do that, will the many..."

899
01:55:15,774 --> 01:55:19,540
...Iives which've been destroyed
by you become alright.

900
01:55:19,677 --> 01:55:25,775
At the most you will be jailed
for some years or be hanged

901
01:55:25,917 --> 01:55:27,544
"l will not allow to die so
easily, Jagmohan"

902
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:31,553
I will give you such a punishment
that even your soul will...

903
01:55:31,689 --> 01:55:36,217
...be scared to do sin. My
answer is not complete yet.

904
01:55:50,475 --> 01:55:51,066
Up here only...

905
01:56:06,825 --> 01:56:10,784
"No, don't give me any
injection."

906
01:56:24,442 --> 01:56:27,138
Do it fast. One scoundrel has
bound me here.

907
01:56:28,113 --> 01:56:29,205
Please take me from here

908
01:56:44,929 --> 01:56:45,418
Come fast

909
01:56:47,665 --> 01:56:48,427
"Perhaps, he has come"

910
01:58:08,546 --> 01:58:10,810
Please save me.

911
01:58:12,383 --> 01:58:16,217
"Brother, please protect me
from him."

912
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:27,525
I won't allow you to go
Get away?- I won't let you go

913
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,295
"Get away, she is Jagmohan's
daughter-Yes, why do you want..."

914
01:58:30,535 --> 01:58:34,232
"...to punish the daughter for his
father's sins, she is innocent"

915
01:58:34,372 --> 01:58:38,274
What is your mistake and
Rajiv's. Why was he behind you?

916
01:58:38,343 --> 01:58:42,336
The one behind us is a criminal.
He does'nt mean anything to me

917
01:58:42,447 --> 01:58:45,416
You are my husband and my
son's father. I won't allow...

918
01:58:45,516 --> 01:58:47,916
...you to become a criminal.

919
01:58:49,187 --> 01:58:54,420
"You know very well that once l
decide, I don't turn back."

920
01:58:54,525 --> 01:58:57,619
I will make you change
-Go away from my path

921
01:58:57,695 --> 01:59:01,324
I won't- I tell you to move away
-I've already refused to move

922
01:59:11,075 --> 01:59:16,103
"lnspector sir, I need the help of
police. -What am I seeing today."

923
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:23,643
Sir Jagmohan wants police help.
One who roars even in a cage...

924
01:59:23,721 --> 01:59:28,454
...is now asking for help
with folded hands.

925
01:59:28,726 --> 01:59:33,186
"One who used to roar was
a dangerous animal, Jagmohan"

926
01:59:33,431 --> 01:59:39,597
One with folded hands here
is just a father who has...

927
01:59:39,804 --> 01:59:46,107
...come to beg for his daughter's
protection from you.

928
01:59:46,177 --> 01:59:49,203
Please save her somehow.

929
01:59:49,647 --> 01:59:51,706
"Save her, inspector"

930
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:55,213
What happened to her?
-Ram Pratap has kidnapped her

931
01:59:55,486 --> 01:59:59,855
He is giving her cocaine injection
and destroying her life

932
02:00:00,491 --> 02:00:05,827
"lnspector sir, my daughter
will die."

933
02:00:06,164 --> 02:00:09,691
Don't worry. We will
surely help you

934
02:00:10,068 --> 02:00:14,767
But what a strange thing is
this? One who used to play...

935
02:00:15,106 --> 02:00:18,405
"...with law, now wants
help from the police."

936
02:00:18,776 --> 02:00:24,305
"But one who was helping law,
now police is going to catch him"

937
02:00:26,084 --> 02:00:28,518
"Anyway, here is Ram?
-I don't know"

938
02:00:28,653 --> 02:00:31,816
"lnspector sir, I will tell you
where he is."

939
02:00:32,123 --> 02:00:38,329
"You - yes, I know where Ram
has hidden his daughter"

940
02:00:38,329 --> 02:00:42,356
"Come, inspector, time is very
short -Let us go"

941
02:00:51,509 --> 02:00:52,498
Up there...
-Let us go

942
02:01:04,722 --> 02:01:10,058
"Ram Pratap...
Come out, Ram Pratap Singh"

943
02:01:10,261 --> 02:01:14,698
You good lies in surrendering
yourself to the police

944
02:01:14,799 --> 02:01:18,701
You cannot escape.
Come out.

945
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:23,504
"l am coming out, lnspector"

946
02:01:34,619 --> 02:01:38,419
"Even if the whole world goes
against me, it can't catch me..."

947
02:01:38,489 --> 02:01:42,585
...today. -Komal...
-Papa...

948
02:01:43,094 --> 02:01:47,224
"Call as much police as you
want, lnspector Sharma and..."

949
02:01:47,365 --> 02:01:52,234
"...fill as many bullets as you can
-Ram Pratap, do you know..."

950
02:01:52,537 --> 02:01:55,267
"...what you are doing. -Ask this
to yourself, lnspector"

951
02:01:55,373 --> 02:01:59,503
"lf you don't know the answer,
I will tell you."

952
02:01:59,811 --> 02:02:01,142
Look to your left side.

953
02:02:03,214 --> 02:02:06,581
"Today, the Jagmohan you are
helping is the one who had..."

954
02:02:06,751 --> 02:02:10,551
...made not only my life but also
made your life miserable

955
02:02:10,822 --> 02:02:15,521
Remember the day when we went
to search for our son in the...

956
02:02:15,693 --> 02:02:21,063
...mortuary very frantically
with great anxiety

957
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:25,431
"Remember the day, you called
me and said my mother is dead..."

958
02:02:25,603 --> 02:02:28,231
...but that I cannot even see
her for the last time

959
02:02:28,539 --> 02:02:35,707
"And today, you have brought
your force to help that man."

960
02:02:35,847 --> 02:02:42,150
"No, today I have come to help a
father, an innocent girl's father"

961
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,550
"And I want you to leave that
girl, Ram Pratap Singh"

962
02:02:44,722 --> 02:02:50,319
"No, lnspector. Leaving her is
out of question today."

963
02:02:50,461 --> 02:02:54,420
"lf you try to stop me, I will
escape in front of you and this..."

964
02:02:54,565 --> 02:02:57,830
...police force of yours will
not be able to do anything.

965
02:03:00,638 --> 02:03:01,662
"l am coming down, lnspector"

966
02:03:05,376 --> 02:03:07,469
"Take your respective positions,
come on..."

967
02:03:08,212 --> 02:03:11,807
"Please don't shoot,
Don't shoot, lnspector"

968
02:03:44,115 --> 02:03:48,677
"Ram Pratap, I beg to you.
You take my whole wealth"

969
02:03:48,786 --> 02:03:53,314
Kill me if you want.
But leave my daughter

970
02:03:53,457 --> 02:03:57,018
You got the help of police. Now
I will make your daughter's...

971
02:03:57,161 --> 02:04:01,564
"...condition more worse. See her
to your satisfaction, Jagmohan"

972
02:04:01,699 --> 02:04:04,031
"Next time, I will send only a
floral tribute to her- No"

973
02:04:04,168 --> 02:04:06,136
"ln that, there will be a small
slip in which the mortuary's..."

974
02:04:06,671 --> 02:04:07,797
...address will be written.
-No

975
02:04:51,449 --> 02:04:52,473
"Ram, stop"

976
02:04:57,321 --> 02:04:59,152
"Even if you take another step,
you won't find both of us alive"

977
02:04:59,323 --> 02:05:06,354
"You can't do this- If you can do
this, I can also do it."

978
02:05:07,498 --> 02:05:14,495
"You can't do it- Leave sister
If you want to kill, kill me, dad"

979
02:05:33,424 --> 02:05:40,296
"Don't do that sister, you kill me
if you want, let my daughter die"

980
02:05:40,431 --> 02:05:45,767
But don't punish this small kid
for my sins

981
02:06:30,848 --> 02:06:31,337
Papa...

982
02:06:34,151 --> 02:06:36,483
Papa...
-My daughter...

983
02:06:40,458 --> 02:06:42,517
"There were no bullets
in this, Jagmohan"

984
02:06:43,461 --> 02:06:48,421
There was only fear in this. I
could have killed you and your...

985
02:06:48,532 --> 02:06:53,435
...daughter long back. But l
wanted to kill only the...

986
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:54,401
...animal inside you.

987
02:06:56,640 --> 02:07:01,134
"Through you, I wanted to tell
every rowdy, smuggler and..."

988
02:07:01,278 --> 02:07:11,176
...terrorist in this world that
you are not God but only human

989
02:07:11,789 --> 02:07:18,854
You also have a daughter and a
wife and hence don't do any...

990
02:07:19,163 --> 02:07:22,758
"...such sins, for which your
innocent children may be punished"

991
02:07:25,536 --> 02:07:29,165
You did not understand me
and I don't regret that

992
02:07:31,242 --> 02:07:38,114
"But the regret is that my wife,
my child's mother and also..."

993
02:07:38,182 --> 02:07:43,586
...my best friend also did not
understand me.

994
02:07:52,062 --> 02:07:55,259
"Jagmohan, I have not hurt
your daughter in any way."

995
02:07:56,734 --> 02:07:59,532
She was never given any
cocaine injection.

996
02:08:00,404 --> 02:08:04,397
"lt was just glucose injection
which was name as "cocaine"..."

997
02:08:04,742 --> 02:08:09,145
...so that the pain of that
injection went inside you

998
02:08:14,685 --> 02:08:18,781
"Ram, I have to arrest you for
the crime of kidnapping Komal"

999
02:08:19,757 --> 02:08:26,253
Who said he kidnapped me. I
went with him on my own wish

1000
02:08:32,436 --> 02:08:39,433
"Papa, you also come here. Their
world is much better than yours"

1001
02:08:47,451 --> 02:08:51,046
"Ram, please forgive me.."

1002
02:08:55,492 --> 02:09:07,131
"My love, don't go east or west,
but live in my heart."
