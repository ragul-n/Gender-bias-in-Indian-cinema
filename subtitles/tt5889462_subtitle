And on top of it
again in the evening

128
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,424
Will all this information
come of use before you die?

129

He knows everything
about this world

131
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,894
The teachers in this school
come to Tinku to clear their doubts

132
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,441
'lf my memory serves me right...'

133

You got at least a glimpse
Lucky fellow!

138
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,353
She doesn't look at
any other boy in this colony

139
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,827
That's why l am a little hopeful

140
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,833
Just 2 eyes

141
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,698

149
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,507
-Are you going into town today?
- No, tomorrow

150
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,103
Don't come back with
those scamps you call as friends

151
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,012
They drink tea and not
1 fellow pays, useless bums!

152
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,043
Dearest Nasseer
My life depends on this lever

153
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,851
lf you had a problem
couldn't you call me?

154
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,859
lt wasn't that complicated
Otherwise l would have called

156
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,966
You must come by 3:00 p.m

No excuses

159
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:36,230
lf l don't get to school on time
my Amina will be waiting for me

160
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,069
Only 1 hour
l'll be back by then

161
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,646
'lkka, you come
2 hours late these days'

162
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,112
'Shouldn't l be back home by night?'

163
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,877
'Don't forget l shell out
a big chunk of my salary'

164
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,009
Sure you do
What rubbish!

165
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,052

167
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,189
Hi Black Molly

168
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,623
Come nearer and put
this pan on your lap

169
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,261
She's irritated because no one
has taken action to rescue Pappoye

170
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,469
We are all going now

171
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,470
Give us a 'dosa'
Or we'll starve

172
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,529
l called Onachan and
he just hung up on me

173
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,632
When l called, he yelled
his choicest words at me

174
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,677
Let him come here
l'll break his limbs

175
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,767
Don't!

176
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,503
Then Pappoye's release
will be delayed even more

177
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,809
Give me one of those bull's-eye?

178
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,613
Get lost!

179
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,210
Call me when Onachan comes

180
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,845
- Guppy?
-Yes, sister?

181
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,082
l have told you a zillion times
not to read those silly serial stories

182
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,657
Blow your nose

183
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,896
You allowed it to burn

184
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,304
Just a bit

185
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,246
No salt at all
in Molly's 'dosa'

186
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,648
lf l go and tell her now
she'll pickle me in salt

187
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,549
Now it's too salty

188
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,820
Fine! Don't eat it

189
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,773
-Why isn't this healing?
- lt will, gradually

190
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,820
- See if it's warm enough
- Ouch! Too hot

191
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,031
'Did you ask Pappan
for the chit fund'

192
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,293
He said he'll pay tomorrow

193
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,130
'Warn him otherwise
l will come in person'

194
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,226
l did

195
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,963
- Hejust laughed at me
-Why?

196
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,733
'He knows it's impossible'

197
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,941
'We must buy a car'

198
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,275
Do we buy a carjust to
collect this Rs 150 interest?

199
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,109
That's simply super logic!

200
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,121
'l was justjoking'

201
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,150
'How much pocket money do you have?'

202
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,849
'Rs 400...?'

203
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,451
'What happened to the rest?'

204
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,721
'l paid the school fees for Gracy's kid'

205
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,766
'You have been doing this
quite often for Gracy'

206
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,801
'You must see the airs
her son Philip puts on'

207
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,235
'He thinks he's the only one
going to school in our colony'

208
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,965
'But isn't that true enough?'

209
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,739
'Then ask Philip to come
and help you bathe'

210
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:52,727
''All through the day
we shall pray-''

211
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,336
Ma, be quiet

212
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,066
Aren't we going
to town tomorrow?.

213
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,471
'Sure, we have to'

214
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,373
What about the money...?

215
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,841
'We'll do something about it'

216
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
Okay, fine

217
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,909
Chechi?!
How are things?

218
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,849
Get lost

219
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,320
Goodness! l just asked
about the colony

220
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,414
-Aren't you going to school?
-Why don't you go?

221
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,321
lf l had, l wouldn't be rotting here

222
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,054
Children must be smart like him

223
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,993
'Wonder whom l can con today!'

224
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,479
Onachan is coming

225
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,956
Let me deal with him

226
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,328
- Where are you off to?
- Got some work to do

227
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,524
Here you go
Oryou'll fret

228
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,858
Keep the towel
Blow your nose

229
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,008
'He could get out only
because cop Smith was there'

230
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,914
Otherwise we would
have all died of shame

231
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,577
Why did you come,
you rotten corpse?

232
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,982
Thought the Chief minister
will come to bail you out?

233
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,250
Just read this news item

234
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,088
You must have done it
without knowing, Pappoye?

235
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:35,294
Oh my God!
lt was hilarious

236
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,200
Why don't you explain?
lnstead of laughing!

237
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,863
He is mad

238
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,407
He snatched a gold chain and ran

239
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,238
He ran...so what?

240
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,073
So why wasn't
a case registered?

241
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,237
Why indeed?

242
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,544
The chain he snatched
wasn't real gold

243
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,611
He laughed nonstop for this?

244
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,947
l knew he was about
to say something silly

245
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,049
Minister! Come back one day
in a car with the Govt flag

246
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,184
Hey! Take me along too

247
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,370
Don't you have class?

248
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,463
The last hour is drill exercise

249
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,103
l want 4 guppies

250
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,511
Why do you always buy
the same kind every time?

251
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,645
Just like that!

252
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,249
- Here
- No, thanks

253
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,486
Take it

254
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,328
lnstead of the girl with the veil
can't you date this girl?

255
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,339
lf it was me l would...!

256
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,102
That won't work out

257
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,610
There he comes!

258
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,451
Why is he always
hovering around that kid?

259
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,212
He's scared of boys like you

260
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,346
Don't you dare!

261
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,390
Shah Rukh Khan has
started his make up

262
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,585
Thank goodness my shop
is at the back of the school

263
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,254
lf not l would be sheertrouble!

264
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,298
'Then the teachers would find it
hard to tackle Pappan'

265
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,987
Wherever you go
these boys are such a menace!

266
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,090
lf you do such stunts to
impress Amina and hurt yourself...

267
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,928
...only we will be counting for you!

268
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,024
'Just continue counting'

269
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:55,698
90...91...92...93...94

270
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,209
Look! Nimmi

271
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,580
Hey! Stop it
Go, sit inside

272
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,745
''A beautiful girl like you''

273
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,421
- 'Dosa'...how many?
- 8

274
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,118
''lf we get together,
it's a time to remember''

275
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,428
- l've packed 10 for you
- But l want only 8

276
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,397
lt's okay, l know
you'll be hungry later

277
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,163
- How is your mother?
- Much better

278
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,363
Then go home

279
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,963
Don't loiter around here at night

280
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,473
Nimmi?

281
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,439
Side dish

282
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,617
Close your mouth
Flies may get in!

283
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,609
'Dear people of the colony'

284
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:46,180
'Thanks to ourADF Govt
and party members...'

285
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:50,717
'...our dream of a decade to have
a bridge will soon be fulfilled'

286
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,286
And work will begin immediately

287
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,132
With your prayers and blessings
we will soon have a bridge of our own

288
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,440
The engineer is coming!

289
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,707
Afamous engineer of
Road and Bridge Corporation

290
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,615
Renowned engineer Thejas Varkey
will be here to build our bridge

291
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,518
On December 23rd-

292
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,679
- Esthapan
- Be quiet!

293
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,553
On December 23rd
we will celebrate Christmas

294
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:23,253
And have a reception to welcome
the engineerto our colony

295
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,454
Esthapan uncle is coming

296
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,087
'Why can't he mind his own business?'

297
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:31,568
Esthapan uncle and the ADF party will
extend a warm welcome to the engineer

298
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,763
This is my humble announcement

299
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,172
Devil! l'll make sure
his pension is blocked

300
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,437
Dear friends,
you must be aware...

301
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:46,747
...our party's efforts and its paper work
was stolen by some corrupt official

302
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,547
Yet on this happy occasion we wish...

303
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:54,286
...all of us join hands together

304
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,452
So you are out
foryour share, eh?

305
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,223
l had no option
Please help

306
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,321
Let me think about it

307
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,504
My boss will listen
to anything l say

308
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,469
Okay

309
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,200
Actually l am the boss here

310
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,263
Okay

311
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,865
l want money

312
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,737
Only then things will work out

313
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,302
ls that okay with you?

314
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,478
Sir, he's asking a bribe

315
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,450
Then pay him

316
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,884
Otherwise your work
won't get done

317
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,679
Sir, he's lying

318
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,492
Have you ever seen such a decent
Govt employee asking for a bribe?

319
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,493
Lousy old man!

320
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,325
Sapless feeble freak!

321
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:33,823
What took you so long?

322
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,490
Got delayed, sorry

323
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,162
Why are you so angry?

324
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,596
l tried to con that old man
with the white beard

325
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,764
But it didn't work out

326
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,898
He complained to my boss

327
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,904
Wonder who will be
the next scapegoat!

328
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,737
'Asolution for mosquito menace
Healthy Kerala'

329
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,741
Gosh! Snakes

330
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,375
Snakes will eat fish
Let's go...quick

331
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,851
Let's go

332
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,712
Lalichan, what about the money?

333
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,223
l have it
l will give it to you

334
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,187
How much do l owe you
minus my commission?

335
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,626
Rs 3600

336
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,198
Bring it when you come for
the welcome function on Sunday

337
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,701
l have no choice
l'll be there

338
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,897
l am responsible for
the engineer's well-being

339
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,471
Look how troubles come unannounced

340
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,840
Now l'll be kept on my toes
till the bridge is constructed

341
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,507
Have you met him?

342
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,377
-Who?
- Engineer

343
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,507
l got a message
saying he was coming

344
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,847
What about welcoming him?

345
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,945
Krishnan sir has already arranged it

346
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,422
- Okay, see you
- Hey! Don't go

347
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,480
What is it, da?

348
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,652
lf you pay me on Sunday
l will buy it on Monday

349
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,965
You are a real gem of a boy, da

350
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,904
'Mani, that boy is heading this way'

351
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,339
So?

352
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,469
'Tell him l'm not here, partner'

353
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,641
lt will soon wear down
the way you keep stroking it

354
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,682
Why don't you buy it?

355
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,343
Where is Joseph'etan?

356
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,511
He has gone out

357
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:37,747
Will he back now?.

358
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,686
Late evening

359
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,747
He asked me to
lock up and leave

360
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,525
What will that 'face'
in the mirror cost?

361
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,898
Joseph'eta, he saw you!
You can come out now

362
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,697
Vamoooose!
Bearded mirror!

363
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,462
What happened to all
the other shops out there?

364
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,563
All shut down

365
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,572
What did they sell?

366
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,972
Same stuff like this

367
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,344
No wonder both of you
sit here swatting flies

368
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,470
You must think before
pricing your stuff so high

369
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,846
Awheel chair like this
costs less overthere?

370
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,885
Why don't you go buy there?

371
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,477
My dear boy,
have you any idea...

372
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,548
...how many days since you paid
an advance of Rs 1000 and blocked this?

373
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,853
Tell me?

374
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,020
Whenever someone
comes in here to buy this...

375
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,791
...l remember only your face

376
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,627
Then l find it
impossible to sell it

377
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,696
l am quite upset about this

378
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,861
-What day is today?
- Did you come here to ask that?

379
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,496
Tell me, Joseph

380
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,833
Today is Wednesday

381
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,499
Wrong
lt's Saturday

382
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,568
Saturday is inauspicious
l knew it the minute he came in

383
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,409
On Monday morning
open the shop at 9 sharp

384
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,504
l will take delivery of it

385
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,641
What about the money?

386
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:40,581
lt's ready

387
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,881
- Swear upon your mother?
- lt's ready

388
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,080
You mean 45-

389
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,023
Being happy is all fine
But don't get drowned!

390
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,702
Goodness!

391
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,007
Lalicha, is everything okay
Engineer sir is coming?

392
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,843
He will be here
The function can begin now

393
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,780
One day l'll be elected
the Prime minister

394
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,819
Don't tangle with the color bulbs
l paid forthem

395
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,081
l am slinking away, okay?
l can't hang around anymore

396
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,122
Why?

397
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,919
Engineer is coming
only after 7 - 8 days

398
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,424
What will happen to him?

399
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,017
The townsfolk will take care of him

400
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,928
He's trying to get me
into trouble for quite some time

401
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,991
You have the correct
amount now, right?

402
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,597
Hard worker!
You got your way finally

403
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,136
l noticed this only now

404
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,036
Are you dancing today?

405
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,385
All these decorations were arranged
by your papa from Heaven

406
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,485
Enjoy yourself

407
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,625
See you

408
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,398
Go on, speak

409
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:38,993
Dear friends

410
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,598
The vehicle with lnfant Jesus
is on its way from the church

411
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:48,134
When the cortege accompanied by angels
and our reverent Father reach here...

412
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,976
...this event will be
a grand celebration

Don't go, Akku

00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,399
Don't say that, Nomu

00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,821
From there l'll take a train
and have a comfortable journey

455
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,831
What do you know?.
The roads ahead are very bad

456
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,900
We will face plenty of ice

457
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,232
You and your bike
won't be able to move

458
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,363
Don't worry, father
Akku will go by truck

00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,236

00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,012
No one has seen it
lt will end anytime soon

476
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,574
Sit here for some time

478
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,480
There!

479
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,183
That's the wheel-chair l saw
Fully automatic

480
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,452
lt's very expensive

481
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,390
l want this one

482
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,927
What about the one you booked?

483
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,723
l want only this one

484
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:26,952
Not possible

485
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,931
How can you change your mind?

486
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,626
Do you know
how much l'll lose?

487
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,692
Do you know
how many customers l lost?

488
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,998
This won't work out, Mani

489
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,163
Here's your advance

490
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,197
This will work out, Mani

491
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,139
This works for me

492
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,649
Khalid?
l am Joseph

493
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,716
Joseph here, l say

494
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,946
Are you busy?

495
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,419
Not at all
Tell me

496
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,757
Have you seen the film
'Bangalore Days'?

497
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,117
Notjust me

498
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,059
My whole family has seen it

499
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:01,097
ln that movie the hero uses
a wheel chair belonging to a girl

500
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,633
Have you any idea about
that kind of wheel chair?

501
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,299
Bloody fraud!

502
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,303
Don't you know it was
bought from my shop?

503
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,134
Someone wants
an identical one

504
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,195
They are rather poor

505
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,740
How much does it cost?

506
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,666
Rs 1,10, 000

507
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,540
You can give me Rs 100000

508
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,603
He says Rs 1,40,000

509
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,781
Will he give it for less?

510
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,609
Any chance of a discount?

511
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,483
May be 10,000 less
Fix it for Rs 90,000

512
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,516
He says 1,35,000

513
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,562
Swindler! How can you
squeeze poor people like this?

514
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,555
Khalid, stop joking

515
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,123
l know how you deal with people

516
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,796
- Now hang up
- Okay

517
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,736
You have struck a great deal

Almost 10km per hour'

540
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:42,371

00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:50,919

''To protect now like a canopy

544
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:42,334
'Anthonyappan Colony'

545
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,955
l still have my doubts

546
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:04,050
Weren't you fully aware of the lie
about the engineer's arrival?

547
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,561
Onacha, this is the 100th time
you are repeating this

548
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,121
lf you ask me once more
l won't bother about your age

549
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,527
l'll simply splash
boiling milk on yourface

550
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,029
ls he God to be showered
in milk from head to toe?

551
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,071
And look at his blessed face!

552
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,934
Haven't seen Tinku
for the past few days

553
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:21,739
l really miss him

554
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,109
You'll feel better
once he's back

555
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,341
Where can he go?!
He'll be back in no time

556
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,600
Must be a great feeling
to roam around on a bike

557
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:52,105
lnstead of loafing around
can't such guys find a good job?

558
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,608
'Look at that
No time even to shave'

559
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:59,907
1 glass tea

560
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,916
Brother

561
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,685
Shall l make it strong?

562
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,953
Sure

563
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,618
What about sugar?

564
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,526
Go ahead

565
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,564
Shall l make it
strong and sweet?

566
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,429
Just to know
your preference

567
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,093
Make tea like the way
you usually do, okay?

568
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,871
'Give him tea'

569
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,145
Where are you from?

570
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:33,981
Quite a distance

571
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,676
Doesn't it have a name?

572
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,778
Manali

573
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,421
Kannamali

574
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,218
Our party is very strong there

575
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,155
Just you wait

576
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,061
One day this stove will burst

577
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,433
'My tongue is jinxed!'

578
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,569
What kind of tea is this?

579
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,006
l know to make it
only this way

580
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,952
Lali here

581
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,580
What is it?

582
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,556
Onacha, the engineer has come

583
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,785
He'll be in the office
in another hour and a half

584
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:17,917
Get lost

585
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:21,054
l feel so bad
l fooled you

586
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,632
But today the engineer
informed me directly

587
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,927
Just get lost!

588
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,563
Engineer, my foot!

589
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,796
- How much?
- Rs 8

590
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,863
Here

591
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,233
500 rupee note?

592
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,977
Don't you have
a lesser denomination?

593
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,205
This is not a KFCjoint

594
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,507
What's KFC?

595
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:39,879
The finance company
run by Kerala govt

596
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,247
That is KSEB

597
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,284
Onacha, you will really
become a minister, l'm sure

598
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,785
-Why whisperthat?
- See if you can change this, sir

599
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,889
How can l give you
something l don't have?

600
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,188
l have only 500s

601
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:55,220
There's a petrol bunk next door
Break the note and get me change, sir

602
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:58,993
Looking for your mobile?

603
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,536
l had left it right here

604
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,628
Let it be here

605
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,967
First get me the change

606
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,530
You are a great guy
roaming the world on your bike

607
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,009
How do we know
you'll be back?

608
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,035
Make it fast, sir

609
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,139
Don't take all this seriously

610
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,115
These boys revel in pranks

611
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,242
'Give me that cake'

612
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,683
Get lost!

613
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,888
lnstead of peeling it
why don't you skin it first?

614
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,956
-You have cigarettes?
-Yes

615
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,290
How much was the tea?

616
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,295
Rs 8

617
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,629
Give me cigarettes for
Rs 992, Kings brand

618
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,328
We haven't stocked cigarettes
forthis huge an amount

619
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,662
Of course we have

620
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:35,932
Give it to him

621
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,241
Show yourtemper when
you have your own shop, okay?

622
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,364
Buy yourself a lollipop with this

623
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:22,681
He's carrying such a huge can!
Wonder if he has a ration shop?!

624
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,050
Onacha, the engineer has come

625
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,089
Oh God!
Really?

626
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,682
l thought Lalichan
was fooling me

627
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,727
Let me go and get
everything organized

628
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:33,888
Get Mathukutty and his band
to come there at once

629
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,328
-Will you pay me?
- Sure

630
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,059
Come fast
with these boys

631
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:38,859
Quick

632
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:43,930
(humming)

633
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,999
Hey! Aren't you also going there?
Let me also come

634
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,772
My feet hurt

635
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,904
l would've reached faster
if l had walked

636
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,777
Do you have a license to drive this?

637
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,874
He doesn't even have a house
lmagine a license!

638
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,885
Both of us need to wear helmets

639
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,353
Who are you?
What do you want?

640
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:13,994
'Engineer Thejas Varkey'

641
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,833
Do some work
instead of hanging around

642
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,133
What the heck!

643
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,634
Where is Pappan?

644
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,198
He is still poking
at the soot in his stove

645
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,834
He was so full of
sentimental advice

646
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,936
Comrade, are the crackers ready?

647
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,947
l know your party
can't survive without them

648
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,448
What?
l didn't hear you

649
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,117
l said crackers are ready

650
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,312
l don't like its color

651
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,117
This is the latest color
making waves

652
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,180
But don't forget
we are building this bridge

653
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,156
Sure

654
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:39,294
Barges in here and
talks of making waves!

655
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,832
What is this, Mathukuttycheta
Like a bunch of fishermen

656
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,929
Don't you have uniforms?

657
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,667
Pappoye won't let me wear a shirt

658
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,730
lt's washed and drying

659
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:53,866
-Washed, eh?
-Yes

660
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:54,705
That's great

661
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,676
When our guest comes
you must ace it!

662
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,976
Afterthe fireworks
it's yourturn to blast music

663
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,684
Bro, be assured
we'll rock it

664
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,753
Good...alright

665
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:06,311
Come

666
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,321
All of you come

667
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,118
Make it quick

668
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,351
Trumpeters come

669
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,121
Sir, how's everything?

670
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:14,953
Are you absolutely shameless?

671
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:15,690
No, sir

672
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,962
l want my party and myself to take
full credit for building this bridge

673
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:22,129
Only then l will have a decent
foothold in the elections

674
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,696
Sir, do you personally
know the engineer?

675
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,433
What if l did?

676
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,840
l just wanted to know
the kind of person he is

677
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,378
That you will come
to know by and by

678
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,936
You mean when he comes here?

679
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:32,003
What a pity!

680
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,250
Here comes
my lucky mascot!

681
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,403
Run!

682
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,238
Shucks!

683
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,574
l'm sure you have an idea
of the townsfolk here

684
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:42,978
This is how they are

685
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,987
The other day they arranged
a grand function to welcome you

686
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,387
l got to know about it
That's why l didn't turn up

687
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,482
How did you know?.

688
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,527
You had given me
Lalichan's number, remember?

689
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,791
How's your stay
at the guest house?

690
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,798
l think a tent would
have been enough

691
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,857
l tried to get in touch
with you many times

692
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,062
But you were off work
for quite some time, right?

693
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,072
l had gone on a long journey
l decided l wanted a break

694
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,801
l can always go back
to work, isn't it?

695
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,103
Always on the move roaming

696
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,336
Lucky chap!

697
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,504
Lucky...me?

698
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,372
Sorry, l didn't mean it that way

699
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,441
l assumed such a remote village
will be free of corruption

700
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,986
That's why l accepted this project

701
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,248
Not too bad

702
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:22,052
Only a few like Onachan

703
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,954
People like him are needed
to add spice to life

704
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,895
-When do we begin?
- Right away

705
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:32,223
lf possible, let us include
the work of the approach-road

706
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:35,962
There is yet another case
l'll let you know in due course

707
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,439
Let's see

708
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,997
We'll do a total clean up

709
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,940
By the way, shouldn't we
have a get together?

710
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,238
Of course!
We must

711
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:45,941
ls Lalichan here?
l wanted to buy something

712
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,984
He usually hangs around
eavesdropping!

713
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:57,186
''What's the sound at this hour?
ls it the koel cooing with fervor?''

714
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:21,340
Chinnappa, can you
make me a cup of tea?

715
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:25,379
l am busy with art work
Please make it yourself

716
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,884
That's a cool T-shirt, sir

717
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,587
That too with your beard

718
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,187
l love it

719
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,253
Want it?

720
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,890
Will you give it
if l say 'yes'?

721
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,030
l'll wash it and give it
to you tomorrow

722
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:42,435
l'll wash it myself

723
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:45,406
Just in case
you change your mind

724
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,515
Sir, if you are making tea
l'll have some too

725
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,951
Stinking!

726
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,921
l can wash it and use it

727
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:01,317
We could have taken thejeep

728
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,358
Not at all!

729
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,723
lt's so good to ride
against the breeze

730
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,155
Am l troubling you?

731
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:09,460
Krishnan sir has said you must
be well taken care of

732
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:13,059
There is no word called
'trouble' in my dictionary

733
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,103
Anything you want, you can
always ask Chinappu

734
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,436
He was employed to look after
the overhead watertank

735
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,736
He always laughs
when l ask him for anything

736
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:25,414
He listens to my Tamil songs
and sits around creating art objects

737
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:29,008
Poor chap!
He is my friend

738
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,575
ls he paid any salary?

739
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,120
Of course!
Rs 10000

740
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,450
Rs 10000?

741
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,724
l take 5000
He actually needs only 2000

742
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,121
l give him that
Poor chap!

743
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,290
Why are you laughing, sir?

744
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,355
Nothing

745
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,527
What to do, sir?
l have 4 kids

746
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,263
ls your salary enough
to make ends meet?

747
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:49,326
Not at all

748
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:51,032
l make up for it
underthe table

749
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,438
l will also give you

750
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,305
l want only affection

751
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,208
Don't ask me for that alone, please

752
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,374
Are you hurt?

753
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,010
No, not at all

754
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,628
What is this, sir?

755
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,162
l bought that

756
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,491
For my Malu

757
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,663
- Who is that?
- My daughter

758
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,074
Looking very smart!

759
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,413
- What if we had died?
- Who the heck was he?

760
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,485
The indicator light is damaged
Shall we ask him to pay?

761
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,821
How does he matter to us?

762
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:19,191
Do we really have to?

763
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,695
- Come
- lt's now or never

764
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,592
l am sorry
l was-

765
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,760
My foot you are sorry!

766
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,565
Oh! This chap, eh?

767
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,196
Do you have a pimple in your eye?

768
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:31,467
Where were you rushing to?

769
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,270
Our indicator light is broken

770
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,832
Why were your eyes
not on the road?

771
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,674
- Pay us
- But you are all fine

772
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:37,770
Money please!

773
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,712
You can afford to buy
cigarettes for 1000 bucks

774
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,113
Money, sir

775
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,278
Now you don't have, eh?

776
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,111
Sir, people are coming
lt will be embarrassing for you

777
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,383
Cash please

778
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:51,451
Pay up

779
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,494
Give it, sir

780
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,560
One more 500

781
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,397
There's plenty of
tinkering to be done

782
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,266
Stop fussing and give, sir

783
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,297
Thinks no end of himself!

784
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,643
Okay, see you

785
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,803
Here's your key

786
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,915
Come, he has paid

787
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:16,183
Go...all clear

788
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,221
Let's get the indicator repaired

789
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,779
First see if the vehicle is intact!

790
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,655
No head lamps
Then why indicators?

791
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,353
Why did you get
another 500 from him?

792
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,328
We are 5 of us
How can we share equally?

793
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,886
Now we get 500 each?

794
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,638
Let's go, sir

795
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,483
Sir?

796
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,953
Why do you look upset?

797
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,285
Nothing

798
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,195
Shall we go to the proposed site?

799
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,630
Sure, just drive straight down

800
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,599
- lt's quite close by
- Let's go

801
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,933
He's Amina's grandpa

802
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,236
Amina's grandpa?

803
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:17,211
Yes, he's the gatekeeper here
ever since this gate was set up

804
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,676
He thinks he is
the lord and master here

805
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,979
lkka, how are you?

806
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,750
He is the engineer
of our new bridge

807
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,664
Please sit, sir

808
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,830
On this track?
Here on this bench?

809
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:45,498
No trains pass
at this time of the day

810
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,201
Okay, let's sit inside

811
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,437
l have not come
to sit and chat

812
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:52,873
What the heck?!

813
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,314
Ask him to keep it away
and do his work

814
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,579
lkka, we don't need the bench

815
01:05:58,587 --> 01:05:59,747
Mannerless fellow!

816
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,347
Parks the jeep on the track
and pretends to be fair and right!

817
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,976
Shall l get you some black tea?

818
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:23,804
No, thanks

819
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,007
Sir, this area is a vote bank

820
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:31,246
There are around 10000
to 15000 voters living here

821
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,289
lf you calculate at the rate of
Rs 10,000 per head...

822
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,722
...adds up to 100 million

823
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,597
Promises to sail a ship
open a port and so on

824
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,864
Their budget will take care of this
and they get a good name as well

825
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,308
Onachan is just a dummy

826
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,711
This is a game played by
senior politicians of the party

827
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,389
'They are all our own boys'

828
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,490
What are your plans, sir?

829
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,863
Have you come by yourself?

830
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,064
Not at all
They will follow

831
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,999
2 or 3 assistants

832
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,769
Care for some tea?
This is our Pappan's shop

833
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,006
Oh no!
l already did once

834
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:33,474
'Good tea'

835
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,346
'Okay, as you wish'

836
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,048
All fine with you?

837
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:46,087
2 or 3 people called
We must go tomorrow afternoon

838
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,493
How many do you want?

839
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,326
Take 4 plastic covers

840
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,525
Let me leave
Engineer sir is waiting

841
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,993
Lalicha?

842
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,036
What?

843
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,695
Did he mention anything?

844
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,136
No, why?

845
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,534
Nothing
We'll meet tomorrow

846
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,639
Out of my way

847
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,036
These naughty imps!

848
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,671
Shall we go?

849
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,381
What is that boy doing there?

850
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,580
That boy?

851
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:14,452
He's the cleverest of them all

852
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,754
l kind of gathered that
Tell me more about him

853
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,552
My previous boss Ganapathy sir
started a scheme

854
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,427
Guppy cultivation

855
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:26,092
Since it gave no returns
he stopped it

856
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,768
But when the mosquito menace
increased in the city...

857
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,171
...demand for Guppies also rose

858
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:36,469
One day l mentioned this
while having tea at Pappan's tea shop

859
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,642
lmmediately this chap began
breeding them in that canal

860
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,012
Guppy cultivation

861
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,549
He's smart, sir

862
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,748
What's his name?

863
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,447
That's really strange

864
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:52,193
Ever since he started growing guppies
people decided his name was Guppy

865
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:53,656
Guppy!

866
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,154
What about his family?

867
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,424
Only his mother

868
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:02,102
His father used to
head out to sea for work

869
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,835
One day he was brought back dead

870
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,967
Then his mother suffered a stroke
and she became immobile

871
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:14,114
After that she refused
to send him to sea

872
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,650
The boy was now in a fix

873
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,019
So a tragic life, eh?

874
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,988
Yes, but he's an innocent chap

875
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,589
You call him innocent?!

876
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,121
Yes, sir
Not the crafty kind at all

877
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,224
He does not have any dealings
with the Panchayat, eh?

878
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,991
What do you think!
l take care of it

879
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,036
Krishnan sir does not mind

880
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:40,739
My dear sir, l pay him
Rs 3 for each pair of Guppies

881
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:41,934
How much?

882
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:45,544
Rs 2

883
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:46,638
Come again?

884
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,115
Sir, 1 rupee, 50 paise
l take the other half

885
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,918
Haven't l told you?
l have 4 kids

886
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:58,116
Sir...?

887
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,254
- Please don't let this out
- Of course not

888
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,192
l am scared

889
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:05,733
You'll soon get over it

890
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,268
l have made a hole there

891
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:08,970
No tension

892
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,072
Come this way

893
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,906
- Let's go
- How much more?

894
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,807
Suku'anna, make it exciting

895
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,676
Can we at least hear sounds?

896
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,614
How did this hole become so big?

897
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,750
l made it bigger

898
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:30,483
Go and read this book
forthe time being

899
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,489
Peeping is an art

900
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,290
When you are old enough
l'll call you

901
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,858
Go!

902
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:39,660
Let me also see

903
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,703
-You also go
- Please, brother

904
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:50,739
Guppy, out

905
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,539
Next is you
Heads ortails

906
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:56,551
Tails!

907
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:57,608
Now you are out too

908
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:58,914
Now give it to me, buddy

909
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,013
Go home, boys
lnstead of sitting here in the dark

910
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,785
Hope he gets caught at home

911
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,219
lt's gone

912
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,526
l couldn't even get
a proper look at the picture

913
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,030
Sit down, Lalicha
l hope you drink?

914
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,831
Oh! l do, sir

915
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:20,638
Sir, our Onachan is here
Can l call him in?

916
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,006
Sure, call him

917
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:23,539
Onacha?

918
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,170
Come in

919
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:29,708
Sir, please forgive me
lt was a big blunder

920
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,184
Hey! Get up
Sit down

921
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,278
l won't create any more
trouble foryou

922
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,550
l'll sit, but tell me
you have forgiven me

923
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,717
lf not, l'll drink all of this
and eat the bottle too!

924
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,693
l have come here
to build the bridge

925
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:43,198
So l need the help of
politicians like you

926
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,062
l called you here
to tell you this

927
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:49,997
1 minute

928
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,167
Lalicha?

929
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,105
Did you hear what he said?

930
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,268
What?

931
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,612
He called me a politician

932
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,875
My deepest desire from childhood
was to be called a politician

933
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,939
Not bad

934
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,815
Look at this and drool

935
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,855
Haven't you gone to sleep yet?

936
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,059
lf you sit and stare at it
then that's all you'll do

937
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,689
He will be late

938
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,631
Sit and drool over it

939
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,637
Wasn't that for me?

940
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,834
Sir will not be back
for some time

941
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:29,207
Why not drink some
and fill it up with water?

942
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,179
You have always been
an expert in that

943
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,745
l know what happens
in the office

944
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:38,783
Corruption king!

945
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,947
Onacha, l have 4 kids
and l'm stressed out

946
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,960
You keep saying this
like a parrot

947
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,391
lf you continue like this
l'll tell our people

948
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:51,956
l have my doubts
if they are your own kids

949
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,399
Go ahead and announce

950
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,362
Quick! Sir may come back anytime now

951
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,265
Quick! Close it

952
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,174
Gosh! My throat
nearly got seared!

953
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,083
What's that?

954
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,061
Magazine
Christmas edition

955
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,932
Didn't you read it, papa?

956
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:30,236
Don't beat me, papa

957
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,999
'Muthuchippi'

958
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,126
So this has to be
placed here, right?

959
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:56,754
Shall l make you
some black coffee?

960
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,782
Shall l make some more
black tea for you?

961
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,843
Okay, go ahead

962
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,989
That makes it the 5th one

963
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:27,528
From his appearance looks like
he is a little too fond of women

964
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:50,917
What is it, sir?

965
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:53,046
Nothing

966
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,385
lsn't this a drainage canal?

967
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:58,288
Why do we need
a drainage canal here?

968
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,020
Then why is it here?

969
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,253
The Panchayat dug it, sir

970
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,266
When it rains heavily
this place gets flooded

971
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:09,498
lf that's the case
how can you block this canal?

972
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,797
Don't be worried, sir
This is after all our own place

973
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,308
We can easily solve it

974
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,175
What is it?
What's the problem?

975
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,579
Why are you here?

976
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:21,908
What is it, Pappan?

977
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:24,145
Nothing, my boy
Sir was justjogging

978
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:31,823
Get lost, you half-pint

979
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:33,122
Half-pint is your-

980
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,787
Shut up!
l'll kill you

981
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:36,387
Did you see his biceps?

982
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,424
'Am l your age?'

983
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:42,265
'God! He could have
dunked me into the canal'

984
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,967
Remember l told you
about an old man?

985
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,975
l think he is a little flirty
l'll call you back

986
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,442
Can l ask you something?

987
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:50,910
What is it?

988
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:53,607
l have a little girl
She's now 12 years old

989
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,546
You have a 12 year old girl?

990
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:59,080
Actually, she's my
granddaughter, Amina

991
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:02,987
Her parents died in an accident
when she was a baby

992
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,992
My life's desire is to see her
become an engineer

993
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,289
What should l do after
her schooling is over?

994
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:11,127
ls this why you were smiling
at us every now and then?

995
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,600
Among all living beings
only humans can smile

996
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,137
So l smile

997
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,369
Does Amina study well?

998
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,135
She's always 1st in her class

999
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,837
Then after her 10th grade
let herjoin entrance coaching classes

1000
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,176
- ls that all?
-Yes, that's all

1001
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,839
l am quite aware of this
Time to close the gate

1002
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,234
l don't want your black tea

1003
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,635
Get away from here

1004
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,503
Wonder if the others want?

1005
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,904
Such a minor issue

1006
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,041
Why not deal with it directly?

1007
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,678
That won't be good enough

1008
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:08,284
l must consider his age too

1009
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,656
l want to make him cry

1010
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:12,187
Beg at my feet

1011
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,091
Youngsters like him
mustn't show such arrogance

1012
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:22,130
Call him, dude

1013
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:30,303
Where is it?

1014
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,680
Krishnan sir?

1015
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,244
Where are you, Lalichan?

1016
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,015
-At home
-Why?

1017
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,252
At my home

1018
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,551
Okay, Lalicha
Sorry

1019
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,458
Why did you call?

1020
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:50,464
That boy who grows guppies...?

1021
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,729
Yes...hold on a minute, sir

1022
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,266
Hey! Take her away

1023
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:59,436
How much does
he earn every month?

1024
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,968
l don't really-

1025
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,710
Sir, going by my estimate
around 12000

1026
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:09,611
Why, sir?

1027
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:12,749
How much does our office pay him?

1028
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,485
At the rate of Rs 3

1029
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,985
Out of which l take Re 1
4 kids and all, sir

1030
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,155
l know your share in this deal

1031
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,132
Like that!

1032
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:30,031
Tell that boy

1033
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,770
Hereafter he will
be paid only 50 paisa

1034
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:39,345
Sir, but 50p is too less

1035
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,414
Doesn't matter
Just inform him

1036
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,019
Krishnan sir does not usually
interfere in such matters

1037
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,122
Did you meet him?

1038
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,699
How could l?
l came here early this morning

1039
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:03,367
Tell him l can't sell
at the rate he quoted

1040
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:11,072
lf he says he can't sell
at that rate...

1041
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:12,771
...ask him to stop
his guppy cultivation

1042
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,645
We don't want to deal
with him any more

1043
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,115
Right, Krishna?

1044
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:17,613
Yes, but...?

1045
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,751
So he is the one behind all this

1046
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:24,257
Sir, but if we stop it...

1047
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:28,092
...how do we supply guppies
to meet the popular demand?

1048
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:32,266
There was even a feature about
guppy cultivation on a TV channel

1049
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,568
Tell people we'll supply
After all it's a small fish

1050
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:36,763
How?.

1051
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,606
Someone who's here
to build a bridge...

1052
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,541
...can easily construct
a 10'x10' tank

1053
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,313
l'll build you this big tank
and fill it with guppies foryou

1054
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,575
l shall bear
all the expenses

1055
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,221
This must happen
We deserve this!

1056
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,352
And you are the sole reason for it

1057
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,324
- Me?
- Do you think it's me?

1058
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,520
Boys must be boys

1059
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:03,626
Who do you think you are?

1060
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:07,293
Stirred up a hornet's nest

1061
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,593
l didn't understand
Be more specific

1062
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,198
That's his work

1063
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,274
We don't have an option

1064
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:21,110
Agree to the rate he quoted
and go tell Krishnan sir

1065
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,116
- Okay, l'll tell him
-You have to

1066
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,418
Go apologize to
the engineer if you can

1067
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,620
l have other plans
chalked out for him

1068
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:33,854
Then go ahead and harass him

1069
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,191
As if he will let you!

1070
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:36,457
Earthworm!

1071
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,398
Look here, don't mess with him
until he finishes his job

1072
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:41,230
These guys have nothing to lose

1073
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,100
But you and l stand to lose a lot

1074
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:47,435
At least think of my situation

1075
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:51,712
Oh! Come on, Lalicha
Forever greedy

1076
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,783
Where can l find Krishnan sir?

1077
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,419
He'll be at the approach road
taking measurements

1078
01:20:58,486 --> 01:20:59,885
You can go straight to him

1079
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,786
Engineer sir will also be there

1080
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,349
Pappoye, come with me

1081
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:06,660
l'll come if everyone else comes

1082
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,528
Go and apologize

1083
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,392
Go

1084
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,674
l'll apologize

1085
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,254
l feel something is wrong

1086
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:38,519
That's correct

1087
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,686
Does he really intend to apologize?

1088
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,221
Or is he planning to beat him up?

1089
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:44,322
'Let us see'

1090
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:55,331
What?

1091
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:05,349
Tyres on this side are flat too

1092
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:22,827
Let's go

1093
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:26,765
You went to apologize...?

1094
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,435
Quick...hurry

1095
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,009
Sir, wait!

1096
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:13,712
Beat him

1097
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,658
Come on, do it

1098
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:21,991
Whack him!

1099
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:32,633
Boys, leave him alone

1100
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,568
Come, let's escape

1101
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,014
Don't

1102
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,056
Now do you realize
it isn't a minor issue?

1103
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:57,324
Did anyone see?

1104
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,733
No, only l did

1105
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,511
Let's go to the hospital

1106
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,315
What happened?

1107
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,909
Pappan, we arejust back
after apologizing

1108
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,453
Everything is fine now

1109
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,581
Aglass of Horlicks
will be great

1110
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,912
'Onacha, we must do something'

1111
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:51,952
'Afterthat we can
take a decision'

1112
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,024
'How do l know
who did it?'

1113
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,725
'l saw it only this morning'

1114
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,690
'What a pity!'

1115
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,840
Since the sketch is ready
you can all leave

1116
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,779
l'll let you know
when to return

1117
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,915
This is too bad

1118
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,710
l have some other
unfinished work to attend to

1119
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,477
(humming)

1120
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:28,206
Sir, plenty of snakes there

1121
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:58,544
Nuisance!

1122
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:04,084
'What's wrong with this man?
Calling me so late?'

1123
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,812
Were you asleep?

1124
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,221
Not at all, sir

1125
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,287
Who is that calling
in the middle of the night?

1126
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:14,290
Who is that?

1127
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:16,190
My wife has come down
from my hometown

1128
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,494
Aiyo! Sorry, Krishnan
l'll see you tomorrow

1129
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,500
Hey! That's okay
You can tell me

1130
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,229
No problem at all

1131
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:26,505
Those canals dug
along the roads

1132
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,906
Do you really think
that was a good idea?

1133
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,009
l didn't think
it was wrong, sir

1134
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:39,585
During heavy rains, the school and
entire neighborhood will be flooded

1135
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:43,851
Do you feel the previous officer
was a decent chap?

1136
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,927
As far as l know
he was a good man

1137
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,855
You still have a soft corner
towards that boy, eh?

1138
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,163
Which boy?

1139
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:52,062
Guppy

1140
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:52,861
Not at all, sir

1141
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:53,662
Never

1142
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:54,963
l get so mad at him, sir

1143
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,731
l swear, he makes me hopping mad

1144
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:58,795
The way those boys
badgered you on the road

1145
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,204
l can't even think of it

1146
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:01,332
- Really?
- l swear

1147
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:03,203
Tomorrow you have a surprise

1148
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:09,976
'He and his surprise
in the middle of the night!'

1149
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,215
'Are you asleep, darling?'

1150
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:16,023
'Why did you say
l was your wife?'

1151
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:18,149
'Should l have said it was
my aunt in bed with me?'

1152
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,296
'Why are you laughing?'

1153
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:24,661
'l didn't laugh'

1154
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,029
'Must be from your phone'

1155
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,276
- Last night
- Last night?

1156
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,238
l was-

1157
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:40,912
You?

1158
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,243
l was-

1159
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,285
Tea

1160
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:48,150
Hope you are fine, Lalicha

1161
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:49,211
You can go, Lalicha

1162
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:54,788
What was the surprise
you mentioned?

1163
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,693
After the bridge is built-

1164
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:58,755
lf it's a surprise
let me also hear it

1165
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,996
Are you or am l
the village officer?

1166
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:03,260
You, sir

1167
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,965
Then l will listen
to the surprise

1168
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:06,006
Leave us alone

1169
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,974
Acting too big for his boots!

1170
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,136
He's hiding there

1171
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,950
'Are you with your mother?'

1172
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,857
'Move aside and listen to me'

1173
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,958
l'll be back now, ma
Your medicine is there

1174
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,229
Roaming around in the sun

1175
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:38,295
Yourface has tanned
like those street kids

1176
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:53,210
After the bridge work was over
didn't we plan to repairthe roads?

1177
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,083
Yes?

1178
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:59,183
So the road behind the school
must be widened as part of the plan

1179
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:03,194
Not only that

1180
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,959
Materials to build the bridge
will arrive by that road

1181
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,432
So that road must
be strengthened

1182
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:08,366
What do you say?

1183
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:10,666
Does it?
Yes, it does

1184
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,134
Sure
So?

1185
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:18,211
l intend demolishing Pappan's shop
and that boy's fish tank

1186
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,303
- When?
- Right now

1187
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:27,277
This is a decision taken
by the Govt, Mr Krishnan

1188
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:30,152
A chance that fell
right into my hands

1189
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:32,186
l will get even with them, sir

1190
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:33,385
Let us give them some time

1191
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:37,090
lf we give them time, they will easily
shift the guppies to another pond

1192
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:38,223
That's no fun at all

1193
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:39,732
Let us go right now

1194
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,201
- Come quickly
- Turn the vehicle around

1195
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,262
Come

1196
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,337
Lalichan had called

1197
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,339
Fast!

1198
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:57,515
He will come a bit late
Has to inform everyone, right?

1199
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:09,485
Drive faster

1200
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:18,138
What is it?

1201
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:19,264
Didn't you go there today?

1202
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,170
No

1203
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:21,969
A small problem

1204
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:23,937
What is it, sir?

1205
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:25,245
What is the problem?

1206
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:27,472
A small problem
We came to look into it

1207
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:29,072
What is the problem?

1208
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:38,042
Why do we need all that?

1209
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,554
Be quiet, man
Let's go

1210
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:50,023
Demolish my shop if you want

1211
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:52,196
But not theirfish tank, sir

1212
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,058
Give them some time, sir

1213
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:57,069
They will shift the guppies
to another place

1214
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:04,332
Wait
Guppy

1215
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:07,200
Pappan, look

1216
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:13,170
Onachaaaaan

1217
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:20,918
Pappan?

1218
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:24,390
'Lalicha, ask them to stop'

1219
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:36,936
'Hey! Stop it, man'

1220
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:29,267
This advertisement is
a comedy from start to finish

1221
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:30,401
That will be good

1222
01:37:30,477 --> 01:37:32,342
We can finish it
within Rs 100000

1223
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,408
This is a little emotional

1224
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:35,743
Will cost you 800000

1225
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,445
lsn't this place stocked with
knives, scissors and syringes?

1226
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,248
Yes

1227
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:42,548
Then we can add a bit of violence

1228
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:44,591
Rs 120000 production cost

1229
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:46,920
- Oh my God!
- l can make it perfect

1230
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:50,426
Hey Changulivalan!
l don't have this kind of budget

1231
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:53,694
May be l can spare 100000

1232
01:37:54,768 --> 01:37:57,259
Adjust a bit
lt's forthe local TV channel

1233
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:58,430
Then call the local people

1234
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:00,268
Each frame of mine
will cost you 100000

1235
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:01,808
- lsn't this local?
- lt was meant to be

1236
01:38:02,176 --> 01:38:05,270
Joseph'eta, return Rs10000
from the advance l gave you

1237
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,346
lt's urgent

1238
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,742
How can l do that, my boy?

1239
01:38:07,815 --> 01:38:10,477
lf you ask all of a sudden
how do you expect me to give?

1240
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:16,187
Why are you staring at me
giving me thejitters?

1241
01:38:16,257 --> 01:38:17,383
l'll give you the money

1242
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:20,555
Here...no, here

1243
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,458
Who is that?

1244
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:25,691
That's a long story

1245
01:38:25,766 --> 01:38:28,200
Tell me the story, may be
it can be made into a good film?

1246
01:38:28,269 --> 01:38:29,600
l'll takejust the thread, okay?

1247
01:38:34,942 --> 01:38:37,740
Sister, Venda Sabu...?

1248
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:40,575
You are just a kid
Why source an assassin?

1249
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:41,706
Nothing

1250
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:42,907
Go there

1251
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:14,674
l will do whatever is worthy
of the money you pay me

1252
01:39:14,748 --> 01:39:16,613
Let me know when
you get him alone

1253
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:17,514
Off you go

1254
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:38,598
l had reserved this Scotch for
the day l finished the bridge work

1255
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:45,407
lf l opened it today,
it's because l am so happy

1256
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:47,974
You'll never know how much,
my dear Krishna

1257
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:50,674
My dear!

1258
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:56,512
Like in any other film
there is a hero and a villain

1259
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:57,855
A hero and a villain

1260
01:39:57,925 --> 01:39:59,392
And they fight all the time

1261
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,489
Finally in the end we win

1262
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:06,263
Can l ask you something?

1263
01:40:06,367 --> 01:40:10,064
This film you were talking about
Are you the hero orthe villain?

1264
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:20,041
Why do l come up with unnecessary
dialogs at the wrong time?

1265
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:27,412
Won't that boy bejust
4-5 years olderthan my Malu?

1266
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:41,892
Remember l told you about
an incomplete shopping complex?

1267
01:40:42,002 --> 01:40:45,028
Can you give me a proposal
with an estimate to complete it?

1268
01:40:45,472 --> 01:40:47,975
lt's easier to sanction funds
when people like you are involved

1269
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,739
l can do it
But don't ask me to build it

1270
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:52,711
You don't have to
l can do all that myself

1271
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:53,712
Okay, l'll do it

1272
01:40:54,515 --> 01:40:56,449
Didn't you call Onachan and Lalichan?

1273
01:40:57,985 --> 01:40:59,680
They won't come any more, sir

1274
01:41:00,954 --> 01:41:02,785
All of them are unhappy

1275
01:41:21,608 --> 01:41:23,838
So l am the villain, right?

1276
01:41:25,446 --> 01:41:26,435
You carry on

1277
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,046
Don't tire yourself standing
l'll come later

1278
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:03,778
'Are you asleep?'

1279
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:04,783
Yes

1280
01:42:14,094 --> 01:42:15,026
ls this the place?

1281
01:42:15,095 --> 01:42:15,993
Yes

1282
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:17,121
l'lljust look around

1283
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:19,631
Sir, l'm just getting
my mobile recharged

1284
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:30,804
'Who is the client?'

1285
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:32,573
lt's really badly constructed

1286
01:42:32,646 --> 01:42:34,637
'lt was for someone l know here'

1287
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:36,182
'Not planned well at all'

1288
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:38,042
'lt was lying in a mess'

1289
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,548
'That's why l asked you to look at it'

1290
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:41,918
l would have come with you

1291
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,183
l just happened to pass by

1292
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:43,985
So l got in

1293
01:42:44,057 --> 01:42:45,854
My driver pointed it out to me

1294
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:47,894
lt's like a haunted place

1295
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:49,959
Okay, let me look around

1296
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:51,824
l'll call you later

1297
01:42:53,867 --> 01:42:54,959
Venda Sabu

1298
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:56,764
-Who?
- Venda Sabu

1299
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:58,235
-Venda Sabu?
-Yes

1300
01:42:58,505 --> 01:42:59,904
What do you want?

1301
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,634
l have been assigned
a 'quotation' job

1302
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:03,107
Quotation?
What for?

1303
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,041
To break your hands and legs

1304
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:07,113
Better escape
as soon as possible

1305
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:07,943
Otherwise-

1306
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:08,947
Otherwise?

1307
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:23,787
l got hit by an iron rod

1308
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:45,547
No point in beating up
an unconscious man

1309
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:47,678
So l waited for you
to regain consciousness

1310
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,280
Stop it!

1311
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,254
l'll go right away

1312
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:56,990
l have other 'jobs' to do
tomorrow and the day after

1313
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:58,229
Go

1314
01:43:58,298 --> 01:43:59,265
l know who sent you

1315
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:00,698
Your guess is wrong

1316
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:01,290
lt's late

1317
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:03,126
Otherwise l'd have shown you

1318
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:07,445
Nothing to worry

1319
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:10,456
Doctor says he can be discharged
in a couple of days

1320
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:13,383
Sir, whatever l have to say
l've already told you

1321
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,189
l did not see the person
who stabbed me

1322
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:18,231
There's no point in you repeating
what we find difficult to believe

1323
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:19,856
Please cooperate

1324
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:22,960
l don't have any complaint

1325
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:23,968
Okay, sir

1326
01:47:24,237 --> 01:47:26,171
We'll investigate in our own way

1327
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:27,999
Okay

1328
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:35,080
You really don't know?.

1329
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:43,118
Oh! Here you are

1330
01:47:45,192 --> 01:47:47,126
Guppy, someone stabbed our engineer

1331
01:47:47,194 --> 01:47:48,388
No one knows who

1332
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:50,022
Did anything happen to him?

1333
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:50,892
He is alive

1334
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:53,057
The hospital is swarming
with police and the army

1335
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:53,861
Army?

1336
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:56,164
That was just to rhyme!
Why are you sitting here scared?

1337
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:57,362
What about Venda?

1338
01:47:57,437 --> 01:47:59,769
lt was not Venda
l called and asked him

1339
01:48:00,006 --> 01:48:03,100
Rubbish! l saw him
go away after stabbing him

1340
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:05,442
Did Venda lie to me?

1341
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:09,105
He is a hired killer
Why won't he lie to you?

1342
01:48:09,182 --> 01:48:10,479
You are right

1343
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:17,984
When police asked he said
he didn't see his assassin

1344
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:19,992
Not see the man
who stabbed him?

1345
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:21,186
Will anyone believe that?

1346
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:22,819
Even the police didn't

1347
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:25,160
He still stuck to
his story, Onachan said

1348
01:48:25,398 --> 01:48:27,958
Venda came without even
covering his face with a mask

1349
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:30,559
lf he confesses
l'll be trapped

1350
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:33,363
Does Venda know your name?

1351
01:48:33,573 --> 01:48:34,801
Why should he know?.

1352
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:36,365
He can say
it was a boy

1353
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:39,268
Everyone will know it was me

1354
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:44,045
By not revealing
the culprit's name...

1355
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:47,043
...what if he is planning
to take revenge on you?

1356
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,287
How?.

1357
01:48:49,956 --> 01:48:51,924
Suppose he comes
and stabs you in return

1358
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:58,395
Don't get upset
l am there for you

1359
01:48:58,465 --> 01:48:59,489
'That's what you think!'

1360
01:48:59,566 --> 01:49:01,591
Your mother was
looking out for you

1361
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:04,266
Don't stress

1362
01:49:07,607 --> 01:49:08,801
Mother

1363
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:13,403
Don't you want to bathe?

1364
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,970
l have already heated the water

1365
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:16,174
Just bring it for me

1366
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:19,579
Why did you do it?
l would have come

1367
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:21,548
Take me to the bathroom

1368
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:25,889
You never listen

1369
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:28,086
lt's already 3-4 hours late

1370
01:49:29,296 --> 01:49:32,231
l was worried l'll fall sick
if l delay further

1371
01:49:34,334 --> 01:49:36,359
l'll bring the towel

1372
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:24,408
Eat your porridge

1373
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:25,950
You skipped lunch

1374
01:50:26,019 --> 01:50:27,452
l can bathe by myself

1375
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:30,253
l'll eat later-

1376
01:50:30,323 --> 01:50:32,018
l said l'll manage!

1377
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:38,516
Mother

1378
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:41,550
l did not read it

1379
01:52:42,856 --> 01:52:44,551
l did not even open the book

1380
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:48,288
Pappoye gave it to me

1381
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:52,161
l threw it into the sea

1382
01:52:53,833 --> 01:52:55,733
l swear l won't
do it again, mother

1383
01:52:58,204 --> 01:52:59,262
Mother?

1384
01:53:13,753 --> 01:53:15,516
Come here

1385
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:19,549
l wanted to tell you it was wrong
That's why l behaved like that

1386
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,484
lt's okay

1387
01:53:22,162 --> 01:53:24,790
This is normal curiosity
for boys of your age

1388
01:53:24,864 --> 01:53:26,263
We must forgive them

1389
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:27,321
That's all

1390
01:53:27,433 --> 01:53:30,732
When you pretend to be asleep
don't forget to snore, okay?

1391
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:35,466
Oh God!
l completely forgot

1392
01:53:39,712 --> 01:53:43,512
Were you upset when
l didn't let you help?

1393
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:44,777
Upset?

1394
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:46,649
l went to the seashore

1395
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:50,314
l sang, danced and
took a good nap!

1396
01:53:51,758 --> 01:53:53,453
l can't sleep

1397
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:54,492
Why?

1398
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:56,654
l didn't bathe
because you weren't there

1399
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:57,855
Not even in the morning?

1400
01:53:58,131 --> 01:53:58,722
No

1401
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,800
l came out
after you left

1402
01:54:00,867 --> 01:54:02,528
Neither in the evening

1403
01:54:03,269 --> 01:54:05,237
My body is itching all over

1404
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:09,908
Make some hot water
l'll bathe and then sleep

1405
01:54:29,896 --> 01:54:31,727
l've been watching you
the past few days

1406
01:54:31,798 --> 01:54:33,493
You look dull and depressed

1407
01:54:33,566 --> 01:54:34,498
What happened?

1408
01:54:34,567 --> 01:54:37,798
Sure, before that my face
was fair and awesome!

1409
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:39,330
Stop joking and come

1410
01:54:39,405 --> 01:54:40,497
Let's catch some sleep

1411
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:43,366
l was simply pulling your leg

1412
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:45,138
You don't have
to be offended

1413
01:54:48,681 --> 01:54:49,739
Why are you worrying?

1414
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:51,477
That engineer got
what he deserved

1415

Be quiet! lf any one hears
my mother will come to know

1416
01:54:55,388 --> 01:54:56,582
But you didn't do anything

1417
01:54:56,689 --> 01:54:58,657

1418
01:55:04,464 --> 01:55:06,625
Why are you staring

1419
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,734
ln case l get 'biriyani'

1420
01:55:09,836 --> 01:55:12,202
Haven't you seen in some movies?

1421
01:55:12,272 --> 01:55:15,537
When clothes fly
the heroine comes to pick it up

1422
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:16,631
Keep looking!

1423
01:55:16,709 --> 01:55:18,836
That old man's underwear
will come flying now

1424
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:26,744
Today is Sunday

And the sea breeze

1427
01:55:31,424 --> 01:55:33,415
Sunday or Monday
All you can see are 2 eyes

1428
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:35,695
Hope someone has not
cast their evil eye on her

1429
01:55:35,695 --> 01:55:39,756
Lady Molly, why don't you go inside?

1430
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:43,701
Snubbed her

1431
01:56:42,562 --> 01:56:44,689
Grandpa has chest pain

1434
01:57:25,138 --> 01:57:28,335
Amina, my dear
Cover your face with the veil

1435
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:30,362
Hair looks lovely
But the face...?!

1436
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:39,970
Amina, wearyour veil

1437
01:58:53,726 --> 01:58:56,695
Nothing will happen to you
God won't let you fall sick

1438
01:58:56,762 --> 01:58:57,956
What is this, grandpa?

1439
01:58:58,030 --> 01:59:00,464
Crying?
Shame on you

1440
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,191

1441
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:05,603
Grandma, not for me

1442
01:59:05,671 --> 01:59:07,798
He was worried
about his health too!

1443
01:59:09,942 --> 01:59:12,604
lt was your enemies
who brought you here on time

1444
01:59:12,678 --> 01:59:13,906

1445
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,038
Enemies?

1446
01:59:16,115 --> 01:59:17,207
Come in, boys

1447
01:59:17,850 --> 01:59:19,112
Show your face

1448
01:59:19,785 --> 01:59:21,719
Let grandpa see you properly

1449

l didn't know you were
such good boys

1451
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,902
Forgive me, boys

1452
01:59:38,804 --> 01:59:42,968
We saw Amina's face
forthe first time

1453
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:49,511
lt was because she asked
we rushed you to the hospital

1454
01:59:49,582 --> 01:59:52,574
lf Amina asked, we would
even operate on you, grandpa

1455
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:58,157
Shoo those dogs away

1456
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:36,890

Not only tea
l brought you food also

1464

Not bread and omelet

1465
02:01:07,994 --> 02:01:09,655
Yummy rice and curry

You are young and healthy

1470
02:01:23,042 --> 02:01:26,307
Youngsters must make
tea for older ones

1471
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:32,016
And your tea is so tasty

1472
02:01:32,084 --> 02:01:33,551
Then how come now?.

1473
02:01:34,987 --> 02:01:36,921

Tea, please

1484
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:19,787
Didn't they harass this boy
with the excuse of widening the road?

1485
02:02:19,865 --> 02:02:21,264
Why is no one around now?.

1486
02:02:21,634 --> 02:02:23,192
Will they break down
this tea shop also?

1487
02:02:23,269 --> 02:02:25,737
God made sure of
divine justice!

1488
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:28,971
He's getting discharged tomorrow

1489
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:32,070
He has many plans
up his sleeve

1490
02:02:32,144 --> 02:02:33,668

l don't paint
Guppy does

He does it very well

He does all the painting here

1528
02:08:06,512 --> 02:08:07,706
But he has a problem

1529
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:11,279
Whatever he paints

That's how l noticed that boy

Poor chap!

1557
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:29,644

No thanks, Chinka

02:11:40,759 --> 02:11:43,284
How long will you slink around
hiding and avoiding?

1589
02:11:46,765 --> 02:11:50,292
My dearest grandpa
Why don't you sell this rickety bike?

1590
02:11:50,402 --> 02:11:52,597
lf l buy a new scooter now

1591
02:11:52,671 --> 02:11:55,401
By the time you start college...

1592
02:11:55,474 --> 02:11:56,964
...it will look old and rickety

1593
02:11:57,342 --> 02:11:58,468
ls that okay?

1594
02:11:58,543 --> 02:11:59,805
Then don't buy one now

1595
02:12:00,579 --> 02:12:02,274
l knew you would say this

1596
02:12:21,633 --> 02:12:24,659
What is the name of that boy
who just cycled past us?

1597
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:26,269
Why do you want to know?

1598
02:12:26,338 --> 02:12:27,703
Just like that
Tell me, grandpa

1599
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:30,770
Everyone calls him Guppy

1600
02:12:31,243 --> 02:12:32,767
What sort of a name is that?!

1601
02:12:34,646 --> 02:12:36,671
They make fun of him

1602
02:12:36,748 --> 02:12:38,909
Guppy is the name
of the fish he breeds

1603
02:12:39,518 --> 02:12:42,544
The ones yourfriend
brings foryou

1604
02:12:42,888 --> 02:12:45,584
Do you know
his real name?

1605
02:12:45,691 --> 02:12:48,683
l have heard his mother
call him Michael

1606
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:49,952
Wonder if he remembers?

1607
02:12:50,062 --> 02:12:51,529
Why Michael?

1608
02:12:52,764 --> 02:12:54,698
That is the name of an angel

1609
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,893
Our Koran also has
the same angel Mikail

1610
02:13:39,011 --> 02:13:40,035
Grandpa?

1611
02:13:42,748 --> 02:13:44,477
Engineer sir has come

1612
02:13:57,429 --> 02:13:58,726
Let this fan remain here

1613
02:13:59,498 --> 02:14:00,692
lt belongs to the State Govt

1614
02:14:00,766 --> 02:14:02,393
But the Centre has rights over it

1615
02:14:02,501 --> 02:14:03,661
Sit down, sir

1616
02:14:06,671 --> 02:14:08,434
- Sit
- No, sir

1617
02:14:08,507 --> 02:14:09,633
Sit down, brother

1618
02:14:17,482 --> 02:14:19,916
Are you a permanent staff
in the Railways?

1619
02:14:20,352 --> 02:14:21,944
No, sir, this is
a temporary post

1620
02:14:22,821 --> 02:14:25,449
l must pass a written exam
to become permanent

1621
02:14:25,557 --> 02:14:28,822
So if you lose this job
you won't get another, right?

1622
02:14:33,765 --> 02:14:37,098
l was assigned this job
to fulfill the dream of this village

1623
02:14:37,469 --> 02:14:40,905
But l realized it was only
for some personal motives

1624
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,435
Which politician has
the time for progress...

1625
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:47,876
...when he's busy
filling his own pockets?

1626
02:14:48,513 --> 02:14:51,539
There is absolutely
no need for a bridge here

1627
02:14:52,851 --> 02:14:59,780
So l stopped work saying
it wasn't technically feasible

1628
02:15:01,493 --> 02:15:04,929
May be politicians like Onachan
may find another to replace me

1629
02:15:06,565 --> 02:15:09,762
But forthat to happen at least
2 more Govts will change

1630
02:15:12,471 --> 02:15:13,836
Which grade is Amina now in?

1631
02:15:13,905 --> 02:15:15,065
7th grade

1632
02:15:15,974 --> 02:15:19,432
So another 12 years to go before
she completes her engineering

1633
02:15:22,614 --> 02:15:27,847
lf this bridge is built, you will lose
yourjob and your income will stop

1634
02:15:28,753 --> 02:15:32,416
With your weak health condition
you can't take up anotherjob

1635
02:15:32,491 --> 02:15:35,858
l did not know all this, lkka

1636
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:40,621
But beyond all this,
it is Amina's future

1637
02:15:40,732 --> 02:15:41,994
Her happiness

1638
02:15:43,168 --> 02:15:46,626
l realize these were the reasons
which prompted you to act this way

1639
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:50,505
An indiscretion done with
good intentions at heart

1640
02:16:04,789 --> 02:16:07,781
Amina mustjoin a decent
engineering college

1641
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:12,962
This card has my number
Call me if you need any help

1642
02:16:13,765 --> 02:16:15,892
l am leaving tomorrow

1643
02:16:19,204 --> 02:16:20,432
My son...!

1644
02:16:22,874 --> 02:16:24,808
Look, they are watching

1645
02:16:26,178 --> 02:16:29,079
l wouldn't have built the bridge
even if you hadn't done all that you did

1646
02:16:29,147 --> 02:16:30,978
But l am happy
you are also a reason

1647
02:16:31,049 --> 02:16:35,509
We were able to save
100 million of tax payers' money

1648
02:16:42,594 --> 02:16:43,583
Amina?

1649
02:16:45,297 --> 02:16:48,733
You must take care
of your grandparents

1650
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:51,660
They have gone through
a lot to educate you

1651
02:16:53,238 --> 02:16:54,796
Can l get you a black tea?

1652
02:16:59,144 --> 02:17:00,475
No need

1653
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:57,090
''When time ticked by
did darkness coveryour eye?''

1654
02:17:57,369 --> 02:18:07,802
''Did it burn like an inferno
Heart full of thoughts aglow''

1655
02:18:07,879 --> 02:18:18,949
''Was it embers burning to ashes
with moist eyes misty lashes''

1656
02:18:19,391 --> 02:18:29,289
''Quiet sobs as memories surge
shattering your heart to emerge''

1657
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:46,717
Sister!

1658
02:18:47,252 --> 02:18:48,219
Sir?

1659
02:18:48,286 --> 02:18:49,913
Where is this boy Guppy's house?

1660
02:18:49,988 --> 02:18:50,977
Over there

1661
02:18:51,956 --> 02:18:53,821
But you won't find him there

1662
02:18:53,892 --> 02:18:57,623
l sent him to pluck
some coconuts

1663
02:18:57,696 --> 02:18:58,720
Where?

1664
02:18:58,930 --> 02:19:00,192
Just go straight ahead

1665
02:19:00,265 --> 02:19:01,664
There's a coconut grove there

1666
02:19:01,733 --> 02:19:02,700
You'll find him

1667
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:12,838
Will you come down
or shall l come up?

1668
02:19:19,351 --> 02:19:22,809
l'll pelt you with stones
Better come down

1669
02:19:23,922 --> 02:19:25,617
lf l call the police...

1670
02:19:25,690 --> 02:19:27,624
...everyone will get to
know what you did

1671
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:30,021
Especially your mother

1672
02:20:43,535 --> 02:20:46,868
Greetings!
Are you still here, sir?

1673
02:20:46,938 --> 02:20:49,031
You were not to be seen
for quite sometime

1674
02:20:52,977 --> 02:20:55,878
Safety pin
Foryour shorts

1675
02:21:09,294 --> 02:21:11,387
Please give this to
your daughter Malu

1676
02:21:23,808 --> 02:21:24,934
Come

1677
02:21:31,049 --> 02:21:32,311
Sit

1678
02:21:37,856 --> 02:21:39,824
Make sure the pin doesn't hurt you

1679
02:21:42,827 --> 02:21:43,919
See you

1680
02:23:51,923 --> 02:23:54,357
Pappan, can l borrow your cycle?

1681
02:23:54,425 --> 02:23:56,120
l want to see my mother

1682
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:18,205
Joseph'etta, what is this?

1683
02:24:18,282 --> 02:24:19,249
Not like that

1684
02:24:19,317 --> 02:24:20,477
Look here

1685
02:24:20,551 --> 02:24:22,041
lt is a visual beauty

1686
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:24,247
Worming into
people's hearts

1687
02:24:24,322 --> 02:24:25,983
What the heck?

1688
02:24:26,057 --> 02:24:27,046
ls it a worm?

1689
02:24:27,125 --> 02:24:28,217
No! Like a centipede

1690
02:24:28,292 --> 02:24:30,226
Mani, l don't like this

1691
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:17,360
Shouldn't we bathe her?

1692
02:26:20,872 --> 02:26:22,134
l'll be back

1693
02:26:22,373 --> 02:26:23,840
l'll come back
and bathe her

1694
02:29:21,285 --> 02:29:24,277
'Afew days later'

1695
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:32,552
'Black tea man is on his way
to pick up his granddaughter'

1696
02:29:32,663 --> 02:29:35,461
'Nowadays he is a changed man'

1697
02:29:36,767 --> 02:29:39,463
-You are early today
-Yes

1698
02:29:39,637 --> 02:29:42,572
- Shall l get you black tea?
- Okay

1699
02:29:43,474 --> 02:29:44,441
Come

1700
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,407
Hey! Look who is coming?!

1701
02:29:52,450 --> 02:29:53,712
Our Tinku

1702
02:29:56,654 --> 02:29:58,588
Come, Tinku
Sit here

1703
02:30:00,091 --> 02:30:01,649
Where did you disappear, old man?

1704
02:30:01,726 --> 02:30:02,784
You got us all worried

1705
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:05,590
l came back this morning
l was at Palakkad

1706
02:30:06,364 --> 02:30:08,559
l read about an old lady
who was sick and sinking

1707
02:30:08,632 --> 02:30:10,691
l went there
Accepted her as my mother

1708
02:30:12,470 --> 02:30:14,062
l looked after her for some days

1709
02:30:14,438 --> 02:30:15,530
'She died'

1710
02:30:19,677 --> 02:30:20,837
lsn't that him?

1711
02:30:21,612 --> 02:30:22,738
That engineer...?

1712
02:30:23,347 --> 02:30:25,611
Thejas Varkey

1713
02:30:27,418 --> 02:30:28,715
Do you know him?

1714
02:30:29,487 --> 02:30:30,511
Not personally

1715
02:30:30,588 --> 02:30:31,919
But l have read about him

1716
02:30:31,989 --> 02:30:34,514
He came here to
build our bridge

1717
02:30:34,859 --> 02:30:36,554
But it didn't happen

1718
02:30:36,660 --> 02:30:39,356
People here cooked up reasons
and forced him to stop work

1719
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:40,863
That is the real reason

1720
02:30:40,931 --> 02:30:42,091
Go away from here

1721
02:30:42,666 --> 02:30:43,860
Give him this tea

1722
02:30:44,602 --> 02:30:46,661
How do you know about him?

1723
02:30:46,837 --> 02:30:49,829
He used to be in
the News for a while

1724
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:53,103
The over-bridge was a dream come true
forthe people of Omallur

1725
02:30:53,611 --> 02:30:55,738
'He was the engineer who built it'

1726
02:30:56,447 --> 02:30:59,075
'On the inauguration day
the entire town assembled'

1727
02:30:59,150 --> 02:31:01,550
'The Chief minister was
also gracing the occasion'

1728
02:31:01,619 --> 02:31:02,779
'But he didn't come'

1729
02:31:03,487 --> 02:31:05,717
When he was coming with
his family forthe inauguration...

1730
02:31:05,823 --> 02:31:07,586
...his car met with an accident

1731
02:31:10,161 --> 02:31:15,428
'His wife, 7 year old daughter
and his parents died'

1732
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:20,127
'Even now every year,
people of Omallur...'

1733
02:31:20,771 --> 02:31:24,707
'...light candles in memory
of that tragic day'

1734
02:31:25,776 --> 02:31:28,472
'Later, resigning from
the Road and Bridges corporation...'

1735
02:31:28,546 --> 02:31:32,414
'...there was a News feature
saying he was on ajourney'

1736
02:31:33,050 --> 02:31:34,779
This was about 3-4 years back

1737
02:31:34,852 --> 02:31:37,719
'May be this was his
first assignment afterthat'

1738
02:31:38,522 --> 02:31:40,786
So his daughter...that doll?

1739
02:31:40,858 --> 02:31:43,622
ls he mad?

1740
02:32:08,185 --> 02:32:09,550
He'll come back

1741
02:32:09,887 --> 02:32:11,878
Don't be upset
and magnify it

1742
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:44,415
'They will lift you up
in their hands...'

1743
02:32:44,522 --> 02:32:46,490
'...so you won't strike
your foot against a stone'

1744
02:32:46,557 --> 02:32:48,525
'HE nobly roams to help you,
amidst clouds in skies blue'

1745
02:32:48,592 --> 02:32:49,616
'Deuteronomy'

1746
02:33:02,506 --> 02:33:05,907
He calls my daughter and
his friends' daughters too as Malu

1747
02:33:06,710 --> 02:33:09,474
Yes, Lalicha
lt's a kind of madness

1748
02:33:09,580 --> 02:33:11,172
Amadness he refuses
to get treated for

1749
02:33:11,248 --> 02:33:12,806
And his beloved madness

1750
02:33:12,917 --> 02:33:14,043
His Malu

1751
02:33:16,754 --> 02:33:26,629
''Mist spiraled heavenwards
Dissolving like nimbus clouds''

1752
02:33:27,698 --> 02:33:37,835
''May your lingering tears soon
fade away into oblivion''

1753
02:33:38,609 --> 02:33:48,610
''May your heart be filled
with lofty dreams to be fulfilled''

1754
02:33:48,686 --> 02:33:59,688
''Away must be etched
for a rainbow to be sketched''

1755
02:34:00,731 --> 02:34:10,663
''Chariot of your dreams you must fly
without restrain in the azure blue sky''

1756
02:34:11,041 --> 02:34:21,918
''Scars in your heart must heal
Your eyes devoid of tears or ordeal''

1757
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:32,755
''Search for a dawn bringing
an auspicious beginning''
