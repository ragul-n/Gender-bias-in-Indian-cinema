'200 years ago, casteism and tortures 
due to it were at it's peak in India'

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,120
'Anyone who raised their voice 
against the dominant...'

5
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,560
'were brutally tortured, 
murdered and buried away'

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,920
'During this phase, in parts of Tamil Nadu 
especially in Nagercoil and Kanyakumari...'

punishments were brought in to practice'

in practice by the Kingdom of Travancore'

'That was the 'Breast tax system''

'Women apart from the 
ones in higher caste...'

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,240
'were imposed with tax if they 
had to cover their breasts'

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,360
'Which means, they need not pay the tax 
if they don't cover their breasts'

13
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:21,600
'A woman from the lower caste single 
handedly protested against this law'

14
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,040

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,160
'In order to silence Nangeli's protest, 
the government imposed double tax on her'

16
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,120

refused to pay the tax'

ran inside her house...'

for imposing tax then here, take them!''

placed them on a plantain leaf'

of blood and died in her husband's arm'

pain of her demise...'

the freedom to dress'

'But instead all she got 
was freedom from life'

30
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,360
'Freedom of expression, 
women empowerment etc.'

31
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,480
'all such freedoms 
that we have today...'

32
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,280
'are the results of 
many sacrifices'

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,240
'Though such events can be hidden 
or erased from history...'

'still people from those parts 
remember these sacrifices'

'AADAI

36
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,680
Where are you? 
Did you get down?

37
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,320
Just got down from my cab

38
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
The roads are quite empty today

39
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
On top of that, I can 
hear a dog howling

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,520
What? The road's empty?

41
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,760
Also you hear a dog howling!

42
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
Watch out for ghosts

43
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,200
Who said so?

44
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,920
The dog must be howling in hunger 
and you say it's ghosts?

45
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,760
Ghosts are nothing but a myth

46
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,640
Hey! Excuse me!

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,400
Who's that?

48
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,560
”Rise n Shine 
You give me grace”

49
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,040
”Rise n Shine 
Make you mean”

50
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,840
”Come and tell”

51
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,000
”Rise n Shine 
You give me grace”

52
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,760
Dude, she is our scapegoat. 
Ready...ready!

53
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,560
- Look over there! There! See that camera? 
- See there?

54
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,760
Cool down! Cool down!

55
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Cool down! It's just a prank show.

56
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
Its for our #TAG TV's new 
show 'Gotcha! Gotcha!'

57
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,600
And you're the first lucky victim!

58
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Say Hi

59
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
It's a prank. 
It's all dummy

60
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,080
Hi!

61
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,480
Now say "Gotcha! Gotcha!'

62
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,520
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

63
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,880
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

64
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

65
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,640
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

66
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,200
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

67
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Five. Six. Seven. Eight!

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,120
Yov

70
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
"Hey! This is our forte!"

71
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
"We scare the people 
and play pranks"

72
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,880
"As the whole place watches..."

73
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,400
"We are here to entertain you"

74
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
- Move! Make way! 
- Make way, you mongrel!

75
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,160
”We will tease people around”

76
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,440
”We adorn the hat 
and make scapegoats”

77
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,800
Get up

78
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,680
So, you kidnapped her?

79
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,640
First of all, who are you?

80
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,120
Sir! Sir! Check out this fellow

81
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
What's the matter?

82
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,920
What do you want?

83
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Sir, remember I told you about 
our girl and this fraud?

84
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
How did he convince you? 
I saw you with another girl last week

85
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Hema. Please come here

86
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
Sir! Yes sir! Its him!

87
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,000
Last week you cheated me!

88
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,120
- You took me out last week! Didn't you? 
- OMG! I don't even know her!

89
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,840
Don't trust him!

90
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
Dude, she has started crying..

91
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,200
Poor girl. Let's stop here

92
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,080
You cheated me, didn't you? 
Sir, it was indeed him!

93
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Ask them to shut up and continue

94
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,080
Keep continuing, guys

95
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
”We make scapegoats”

96
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,640
What happened?

97
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
”Scapegoats of our candid show”

98
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,480
”This is our forte”

99
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,920
Shall I pour it?

100
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
Shall I?

101
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
Just for fun!

102
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,800
Dating sounds fine. 
Marriage is not my forte

103
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,280
Or else what will you do?

104
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,080
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

105
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,520
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

106
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,960
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

107
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,160
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

108
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,080
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

109
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,200
Akash...

110
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,560
What's the total duration?

111
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,880
Give me a second

112
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,680
22 minutes and 15 seconds, bro

113
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,640
Superb! Lock it

114
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,360
Mr. Dumped, check if you're 
ok with the edit?

115
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,840
How many times have I warned you 
not to call me Mr. Dumped?

116
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,840
- Say it again and I'll slap you! 
- Ok, dude. Relax

117
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
- There is a limit 
- Cool!

118
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,040
How does it look?

119
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,560
Looks good...

120
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,680
That dumped part from the ghost sequence

121
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,120
'Dumped' part?

122
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,920
Stop laughing

123
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Dude, I think we can extend the 
ghost sequences. It's entertaining

124
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Dude, that guy started 
weeping out of fear

125
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,760
Once we told him it's a prank, he 
lost it and was about to hit us

126
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,600
But...

127
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,200
seriously poor fellow. 
I feel you guys went a little overboard

128
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,920
Akash, you may feel 
pity for that boy...

129
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,560
but then Kamini?

130
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
- Phew! 
- Who's that?

131
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
What?

132
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,600
Oh! You're new here, right?

133
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,880
You must not have watched 
Kamini's previous episodes

134
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,120
Dude, the girl who acted unconscious 
pranking people. That's her!

135
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
Oh. That's our Kamini?

136
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,320
Our Kamini?

137
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,760
I guess our new editor 
will woo her soon

138
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,640
No! No! I know her already 
that's why I said so

139
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,880
Go ahead. Flirt with her

140
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,320
I just wanted to know if she acts 
really well. That's all. I swear

141
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Acting? Dude, she just won't 
stop once she gets started

142
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240
At one point even if we plead her to 
stop out of sympathy, she won't!

143
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,440
Even I'll crack up and laugh 
at some point but Kamini?

144
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
She is quite spontaneous, 
sharp and bold! God!

145
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,080
A sadist!

146
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,360
Dude, haven't you moved 
on since that dumping incident?

147
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
What dumping incident?

148
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,200
Well, that...

149
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,720
Well, the day 
Mr. Dumped got dumped...

150
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,400
and that dumping was 
witnessed by his friends...

151
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,240
Dude, he is asking and it's 
only fair I let him know

152
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,120
Sunny Leone?

153
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes. Historical movie!

154
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
There are sword fights in it

155
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,480
Historical film, my foot!

156
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,120
Sunny Leone films are mostly porn that we 
delete from Browser history after watching

157
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,800
Hey guys, morning!

158
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,440
Hello sir

159
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,880
So Gowri, is everything 
packed up?

160
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,760
Almost, sir. We are on it

161
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
What's that?

162
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,600
A small correction in the "Gotcha! 
Gotcha!" latest episode

163
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,000
Come on, guys! We've been slowly 
shifting our office over a week

164
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,000
What's with the last minute corrections?

165
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,120
Today's the last day

166
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,360
We gotta empty the building 
by today evening.

167
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,400
It's a court order

168
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,000
Almost done

169
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,200
See, our boss is very particular. 
It's a prestige issue

170
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,920
If we don't vacate 
by today evening...

171
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,760
other channels will make a news out 
of this, and spoil our reputation

172
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,040
- Ok, sir 
- Right?

173
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
Why is he carrying a long face?

174
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,040
Is he missing 
this building already?

175
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,360
Well, sir...the day 
Mr. Dumped got dumped...

176
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,760
and that dumping was 
witnessed by his friends...

177
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Shut up, Gowri!

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,320
Hey, where is Kamini?

179
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,760
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

180
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,040
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

181
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,920
What happened?

182
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,200
Had a nightmare?

183
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,520
Indeed mom!

184
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
- A bad dream! 
- What was it about?

185
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,280
I was wearing lot of bangles 
in my hand...

186
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,160
and with flowers in my head...

187
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,480
and Mehendi in my hands

188
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,080
Top of it, 
I was wearing a red colored Saree

189
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,760
Red colored Saree?

190
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Did it set off a bull and 
did it charge towards you?

191
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,320
A bull?

192
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,440
Tell me what happened then?

193
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,720
What more do you expect to happen?

194
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,680
That's all and I woke me up

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
Crap! It's 11!

196
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,480
So, seeing yourself in a Saree 
is a nightmare to you?

197
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,280
Move! Won't you 
wake me up on time?

198
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,120
Look at her room! Eww!

199
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,280
It's her birthday and look when 
she wakes up! It's 11 am already

200
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
That too after having set an alarm!

201
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,280
Dressed traditionally and 
stepping into a temple.

202
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,240
Who else would call it a nightmare?

203
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,120
Instead of getting married and leading 
a family life with husband and kids...

204
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,240
you work in a TV station, 
playing pranks on people!

205
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,240
I bought you a new Saree, hoping 
you'll wear it at least today

206
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,240
But you? You get into that 
same circus attire of yours!

207
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,960
I named you 'Sudhandhira kodi'(Free soul)

208
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,960
And what do you do? You give yourself 
an alias 'Kamini!' (Bold and beautiful)

209
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
Wonder when you'll 
make your mom proud

210
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,840
Mom, tune into our channel

211
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,960
My program is airing

212
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,960
So all this while my words 
were falling in deaf ears?

213
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
I heard you. Now, 
increase the volume

214
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,720
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

215
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,280
Rekha, come here

216
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,400
What happened?

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,560
Felt like something bit me

218
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,240
What's gonna bite 
you in this place?

219
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,320
Indeed! Something bit me too

220
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,320
What is it?

221
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,400
I don't know

222
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Kamini!

223
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,240
Kamini!

224
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,520
Kamini!

225
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,440
’Due to breakage in gigantic pipes..’

226
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
’..there is a delay in water supply..’

227
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,840
Look at her

228
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,600
Dressed up beautifully in a Saree...

229
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,240
well groomed and beautiful like a doll. 
No roaming business

230
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,720
Look how graceful she looks

231
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,480
Why don't you try something like that?

232
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Instead...

233
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,960
'Hi! We are from #TAG TV'

234
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
'Look over there! 
See here! See the camera?!

235
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,440
'Wave your hands!'

236
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,760
'Now say 'Gotcha! Gotcha!'"

237
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,360
What is this?

238
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
And top of it you keep bringing 
up Feminism all the time

239
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,920
Of course! Tell me 
what is feminism?

240
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
I do know

241
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,560
Is it? Explain me

242
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,440
Well, it is...yes!

243
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,880
One extra idly you have after satisfying 
your hunger belongs to someone else

244
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,560
Mom! That's Communism!

245
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,480
Communism?

246
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
And she thinks she just delivered 
a dialogue like actor Vijay!

247
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,720
- Are you already done eating? 
- Come on, mom!

248
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,080
You can't even differentiate 
between Communism and Feminism

249
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,320
But what's that got to do with food? 
Does Feminism preach you to eat less?

250
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,000
Becoming a news anchor 
isn't a big deal, mom

251
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,760
We must not be the one 
who reads out the headlines

252
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,640
We must be the headlines!

253
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,080
Don't you know, mom?

254
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,040
I took up this media job because 
I hate to sit and work at a desk

255
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,520
Sucking up to suited up bosses 
isn't my kind attitude, Lakshmi

256
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,760
I have no problem you being the headlines

257
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,840
But just that the headlines 
must be a good one, Kamini

258
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
It must make me feel 
proud about you

259
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't want to judged as a single parent 
who didn't raise her daughter well

260
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,880
Oh My God Enough mom!

261
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,400
Now what's your problem? News 
Anchoring is a better job, right?

262
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,840
Fine, I'll become a News anchor. 
It's a silly matter, mom

263
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,840
You? Anchoring? My foot!

264
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
You can't even speak four 
lines in proper Tamil accent

265
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Hello!

266
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,520
Challenge?

267
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,320
- Wanna bet? 
- I'll lay one slap!

268
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,160
First, stop betting 
on everything!

269
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
It'll become an addiction

270
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,360
What the hell? 
Look at your dress!

271
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,880
Even while drying our inners 
we dont let others see it

272
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,800
But you show it off wearing it!

273
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,920
Such a drama queen!

274
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,960
Let's put a 'To be continued...' 
to our serial fight

275
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,440
Next Episode, tomorrow

276
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,920
Deepak already called me. 
I must go now

277
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
I have to pick him up

278
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,600
Ok mommy

279
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Let me know if it's heavy. 
Do not push

280
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,960
It's been hardly a month 
since I joined...

281
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,080
and already we are 
vacating the office!

282
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,960
Turn

283
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,000
- This way 
- Yes. Hold it properly.

284
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,320
Why are we vacating 
in a hurry?

285
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,600
Well, bro...

286
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,000
this is a rented building

287
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,120
Our boss offered to buy the 
building but the owner refused

288
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,560
Our boss too refused to vacate

289
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,480
Hold like this

290
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,760
The owner pressed charges

291
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,440
On one hand, the 
case in the court...

292
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,680
on the other hand, our boss started 
constructing a new building in Mandaveli

293
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
It's still under construction but then...

294
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,120
the court has already passed an 
order to vacate this building.

295
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,440
And so here we are

296
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,880
Last time I did something 
similar was during...

297
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,640
my School annual 
day, lifting benches

298
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Should we handle luggage 
at the new place too?

299
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,280
Whose charger is it?

300
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
That belongs to Mr. Dumped. 
Leave it there

301
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,880
Mr. Dumped!

302
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,240
Why do you guys call 
Sugumar as Mr. Dumped?

303
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,640
Well, it's a boring flashback. 
Forget it

304
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,240
It's ok. Just tell me. 
I'll edit the boring part

305
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,360
Boring flashback

306
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,760
Initially, we tried our 
hands on every show

307
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,440
We did a lot of shows but we weren't 
getting that break and recognition

308
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,840
That's when Kamini came up 
with "Gotcha! Gotcha!"

309
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,160
Jeni became a news reader

310
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,920
We also became famous

311
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,800
The TRP rating rocketed 
sky high for our show

312
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,320
"Hey you little angry birdie!"

313
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,920
"Don't you make me desperate"

314
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,960
"And when I look at you..."

315
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,040
"stop mesmerizing me!"

316
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,280
"Hey you little angry birdie!"

317
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,600
I could see Kamini and Sugumar getting closer 
day by day. I felt it was overwhelming

318
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,080
I expected Sugumar 
will propose her first

319
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,040
But Kamini proposed Deepak by kissing 
and hugging him on the streets

320
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,800
Even then, Sugumar didn't leave her

321
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,680
The very next day that 
incident took place

322
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,800
Kamini...

323
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,280
Kamini...

324
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,760
I have something to tell you

325
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,840
What is it? Are you 
quitting the job?

326
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,960
Dude stop!

327
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,320
- Look, Sugumar 
- Then what?

328
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,720
- Do you have any new idea for our show? 
- He is a goner!

329
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
Well, I don't know how it happened...

330
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,240
but I think I'm in 
love with you Kamini

331
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
- You're in love with me? 
- Yes, Kamini

332
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,400
I gave it a good thought

333
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm indeed in love

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,040
Take out the camera

335
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,640
- What are you up to? 
- Wait and watch

336
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,920
We don't even have guts to ask extra 
sides when we are at a restaurant

337
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,840
Where as, our fellow 
is proposing her!

338
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,080
This is history

339
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,880
You drink and are a spoilt brat

340
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,840
You are arrogant. You bet at 
every possible opportunity

341
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,680
Do you think a lot of them will like 
a girlfriend with such qualities?

342
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,480
But I love you, Kamini

343
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,480
Sugumar...

344
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,720
stop kidding

345
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,000
There is a limit for everything

346
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,480
Exactly. There is a limit!

347
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,600
We have crossed the limits of 
a friendship long ago, Kamini

348
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,880
When you hop on my bike 
instead of others' bike...

349
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,280
You have no idea how 
happy it makes me, Kamini

350
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,600
As I drive the bike, you 
fall asleep on my shoulders

351
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,080
I feel extra weight...

352
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,480
but the feel it gives me...

353
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,000
Whoa!

354
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,040
It feels like heaven 
on earth, Kamini!

355
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,920
Don't you feel the 
same way, Kamini?

356
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,000
What nonsense, Sugumar?

357
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,040
Something's wrong with you

358
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,840
Indeed Kamini. 
Everything's wrong with me

359
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,240
I have gone mad

360
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,920
- I can't live without you, Kamini 
- Just shut up!

361
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,160
Why is she yelling so bad?

362
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,840
Are you nuts?

363
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,480
If a girl rides with a guy in 
his bike during the night...

364
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,160
you call it love?

365
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,320
- Ok, people are watching 
- Just shut up!

366
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,000
I chose your bike over others 
bike because I love your bike!

367
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,280
Not because I love you!

368
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,040
Kamini...

369
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,960
other day you tasted 
food from my plate?

370
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,040
I would have been starving!

371
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,640
Your food must have arrived 
earlier and hence I took a bite

372
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
You call that love?

373
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,560
You sported a horn on my head while 
posing for a group photo. That one?

374
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,560
Cut the crap!

375
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,360
And that made you fell in love?

376
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,640
Did you bring me all the way to this 
crappy tea shop at this hour to propose?

377
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,640
Look here, girl!

378
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,000
This shop is my hard work! 
Better mind you words!

379
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,320
You!

380
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,520
What's with the rude tone? 
Who do you think you are?

381
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,840
You better show some respect!

382
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,000
Or else what?

383
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,760
I could be the next chief 
minister or prime minister

384
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,360
Get lost you monkey-face!

385
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,480
Not the time. I'm pissed off! 
You better step back

386
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,600
Sorry. Please get back inside. 
Please. Sorry

387
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,160
Forget it, Kamini. 
Come, I'll drop you home

388
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,000
You think I'll ride with 
you after all this?

389
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,680
Get lost!

390
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,160
Kamini, look here. Listen to me. 
Kamini...Kamini...

391
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,720
- Calm down, Kamini 
- Just get lost!

392
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,200
- Just come with me, Kamini 
- I'll book a cab and go safe

393
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,480
Kamini, please!

394
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,760
- What happened? 
- Wait

395
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,920
He saw us!

396
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,400
Kamini!

397
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,280
Kamini, look "Gotcha! Gotcha!"

398
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,240
" Gotcha! Gotcha!" prank. 
Look over there. Hey, Gowri!

399
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,200
Gowri! Gowri!

400
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,960
- Say "Gotcha! Gotcha!" 
- Just say it

401
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,720
Look, Kamini fell for my prank! 
Come on!

402
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,840
- "Gotcha! Gotcha!" 
- "Gotcha! Gotcha!"

403
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,040
Come on, guys

404
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,200
"Gotcha! Gotcha!" 
"Gotcha! Gotcha!"

405
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,160
It was just for fun Kamini. 
Come on

406
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,920
Sugumar's a smart guy!

407
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,520
Thanks to us. If we hadn't 
responded to him...

408
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,000
Kamini would have unleashed 
hell on Sugumar!

409
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,800
So that's how Sugumar got the nickname 
'Mr. Dumped?'

410
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,040
Wait editor, the 
story ain't over

411
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,840
Later, Kamini and Deepak 
got into a relationship

412
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,600
Deepak could have kept 
his mouth shut but...

413
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,560
he revealed what happened the 
other day was for real

414
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,880
Holy guacamole!

415
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,400
Then?

416
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,480
Greetings! I'm Gowri

417
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,240
Myself and Deepak were crossing 
the very place on the very day

418
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,560
Sugumar took Kamini out to propose her

419
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,560
This hurt her a lot thus a silly 
issue became a major issue

420
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,040
Myself, Madhavan Nair, the owner of the 
tea shop where the incident took place

421
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm Jenifer. Kamini's friend

422
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,360
She made a special Mr.Dumped episode 
and released it on Valentine's day

423
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,840
The episode was a hit

424
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,280
Our people have weird taste!

425
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
Even today, somewhere, someone 
shares this video on social media

426
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,600
And since then everyone in our 
office address Sugumar as Mr. Dumped

427
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,800
Poor fellow

428
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,160
She went too overboard in the 
name of getting back at Sugumar

429
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,320
That's Kamini for you

430
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,160
She does what she wants

431
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,880
If she places a bet then she 
will do anything to win it

432
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,480
Deepak is in a relationship with her and 
I wonder what hell he is undergoing

433
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,840
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

434
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,600
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

435
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,120
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

436
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,760
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

437
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,360
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

438
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,000
”O Godess our protector 
O powerful Goddess”

439
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,440
”O powerful Goddess Shakthi 
Shower Your grace”

440
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,280
”Shower Your grace”

441
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,080
Good morning, Jeni baby

442
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,320
Good morning?

443
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,160
Time is about to be 
1 in the afternoon

444
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
My day has just begun

445
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,640
What is that you see 
in this mirror?

446
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,000
You adore so much 
looking into it

447
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,760
Kamini, give that to me. 
Give me the mirror

448
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Why do you need all this 
for reading out the news?

449
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,480
Hands off me! You 
will never understand

450
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,400
The news reader girl, her attire, the 
ornaments in her neck and her earrings...

451
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,680
There are people who watch 
news channels to just watch these

452
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,360
Celebrity Priya Bhavani shankar...

453
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,160
guess how she became popular?

454
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
Too much!

455
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,760
I'm allergic to this 
traditional Saree

456
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,240
I wonder how you wear it and 
walk without tripping over

457
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,520
When you can walk with high 
heels without tripping over...

458
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,920
can't you walk wearing Saree?

459
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,240
Don't wear it if you don't like it

460
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,320
But I seem to be very beautiful 
in Saree according to my fans

461
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,680
Look here, everyone has a different 
style in which they look good

462
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,280
You wear what suits you the best

463
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,320
In that case I will look very 
beautiful without any dress

464
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,320
It's sad we can't do that

465
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,920
Ok, fine

466
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,920
Get naked and read the news

467
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,240
Start a new program

468
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,360
Los Angeles has news shows 
where anchor removes-

469
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,320
-clothes one by one as 
they read the news...

470
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,440
I have heard of such 
Naked News channels

471
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,960
By the time they reach weather 
report, they'll be in their bikini

472
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,840
Would you like to 
try it out, Kamini?

473
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,280
"The naked truth! 
Nothing to hide!"

474
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,080
How's the title?

475
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,200
Nice!

476
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,360
- Madam, mic 
- Place it over there

477
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Thank you

478
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
Jeni...

479
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,520
Challenge accepted, I'll read 
the news like you described

480
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,520
Wanna bet?

481
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Stop kidding, Kamini

482
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,080
News reading isn't as simple as 
your "Gotcha! Gotcha!" show

483
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,120
To blabber whatever you want and 
shoot it easily from a van far away

484
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,720
Go and see for yourself

485
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,960
There are 10 departments 
working on the PCR alone

486
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,640
While reading, we must also focus on 
director's instruction in Talk-back

487
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,000
Then read lines from the prompter and 
express accordingly while reading

488
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,080
Even a small mistake will 
screw up the whole thing

489
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,640
And this is a live telecast. 
Hope you realize that

490
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,600
- Everything ok? 
- Yes, ok

491
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Fine, I'm getting late

492
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,680
The live feed will start any minute. 
I'll go to the restroom before that

493
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,520
Ok?

494
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,920
Bye. Good luck

495
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,920
Thank you

496
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,560
What' the time man?

497
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,120
- 12:40, boss 
- Oh no!

498
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,200
- Sir... 
- Not now! Not now!

499
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
Guys!

500
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,680
Where is Jeni?

501
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Sir, she went to the washroom

502
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,120
- What? 
- Yeah

503
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,440
Hey, Sugumar come here

504
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,560
Go, get her. Quick! Run! Fast!

505
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,480
Where the hell is she?

506
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,880
Go get her! Fast!

507
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,640
The director is yelling at me! 
Come fast!

508
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,960
Ok, dude...err...Ok, sir

509
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,360
Get out of my way! Get out!

510
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,440
Senz sir, why are you upset?

511
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,680
If Jeni can't make it, we have 
Aarthi right?

512
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,320
Aarthi is on leave, Kamini!

513
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,160
Our boss would have tuned 
in to watch the news now

514
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,920
News1 live was our channels first 
ever live program to be aired

515
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,840
So sentimentally boss wants to finish 
all the activities in this building...

516
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,440
with the same News1 live!

517
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,040
Bloody superstitious fellow!

518
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,800
Tortures me with his sentiments, 
auspicious time, colors, belief in God!

519
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,080
Sir, you're an atheist?

520
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,080
What?

521
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,760
Do you believe in God or no?

522
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,720
I am on the neither side

523
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm just neutral

524
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,320
Ok sir

525
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,800
Guys, everything will be fine

526
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,480
Jeni will be here in sometime

527
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,400
Senz sir...

528
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,240
Jeni is not there 
in the washroom

529
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,920
- What are you saying? 
- I checked thoroughly. She's not there

530
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,000
Call up, Jeni

531
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,800
She left the phone with me

532
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,160
Senz sir...

533
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,520
Sir, relax

534
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,720
Shall I read the news?

535
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,200
This is not a joke, Kamini

536
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,000
You're not meant for this. 
Just stay away

537
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,840
You don't have to 
be so judgmental, sir

538
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,800
What do you mean?

539
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,200
I mean I can pull it off

540
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,480
Just a while ago I was talking to Jeni

541
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,400
In fact I went through few 
sheets of news material

542
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,320
Sir, I have a strong 
feeling I can do this

543
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,000
Are you sure?

544
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,320
- Wanna bet? 
- What?

545
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,480
Nothing. Sir, I'm damn sure. Trust me

546
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,560
- Aditi, give me the bag 
- Get it done! Quick! Fast

547
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,920
- Yes, sir 
- Ok guys, alert

548
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,640
We are going to go live 
in five minutes, alright

549
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,960
Prompts and punches! Get 
the news rolling fast!

550
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,880
I want the ticker 
happening right now

551
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,360
Guys, please cooperate a little

552
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,560
Only ten minutes to go. Get me a Saree

553
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,000
- Is this the one? 
- That's not good

554
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,280
Quick, get me another one

555
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,440
Look, it's over there

556
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,080
God's speed, baby!

557
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,920
- Enough 
- It's not over

558
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,200
We'll do the rest on the spot

559
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Guys, come

560
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,720
Camera one, standby

561
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Camera ready

562
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,080
Prompter speed ok?

563
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,760
Cue

564
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Out...Out! It's ready. Go!

565
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,760
Three

566
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,840
Two

567
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,360
One

568
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,440
Greetings

569
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,600

Chances of heavy rainfall

Moving on to the details

Lorries on strike 
for the 5th consecutive day

578
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,280
She is spot on, isn't it

579
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,800
Vegetables, fruits and flowers 
have become costlier

580
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,160
Biscuit?

581
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,080
I'll get you a fresh piece

582
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,360
Reporter Arunmozhi Varma is 
on Live with the details

583
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,120
Arunmozhi, please tell us 
about the lorry strike..

584
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,160
Director sir, how is the show?

585
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,640
She is doing good

586
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,040
My girl

587
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,200
The news continues after 
a small commercial break

588
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,160
You have three minutes break, Kamini. 
Relax yourself

589
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,960
Turn on the talk back

590
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,160
Kamini, you're doing great

591
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,280
Just one thing. Chin up while 
facing towards camera two

592
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,280
Yeah. Yeah, that one. Correct

593
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,760
Ok?

594
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,320
Great going. Keep going

595
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,320
Take this

596
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,360
Sugu...

597
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,880
Call up my mom and ask 
her to watch this news

598
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,000
Quick!

599
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,800
The news continues

600
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,920
Yes, this is Sugumar here

601
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,160
Yes

602
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,240
Do you hear me?

603
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,640
Yes, I'll watch it. Right away. 
Ok, dear

604
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,720
Condemning the ruling party's 
act of publishing his-

605
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,760
entry into politics as a 
part of sports section....

606
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,360
the top actor sent out a 
rude notice to party media

607
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,320
He condemned that 
it was a prejudicial act

608
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,800
The party that secured 
lesser votes than NOTA

609
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,240
Jeni! Where were you?

610
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,440
Why is she panting?

611
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,640
You went missing hence Senz sir 
asked Kamini to read the news

612
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,840
Where were you?

613
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,800
The restroom downstairs was full

614
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,680
So I went to the one upstairs

615
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,240
I couldn't lock the door there

616
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,520
Somehow I locked it but 
later it wouldn't open

617
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,680
I threw papers out from there and yelled out 
to you all. Didn't anyone of you hear me?

618
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Luckily, just now a carpenter 
came in and opened it

619
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,960
Relax. Give her some water

620
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,240
And with this we come to an 
end to the news at 1 live

621
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,920
Stay tuned to #TAG 24/7 for 
latest news and headlines

622
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,160
Thank you!

623
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,400
Yay!

624
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,520
I did it!

625
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,960
You did well 
Super

626
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,920
Thank you! Yay!

627
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,840
Unforgettable place

628
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,520
Five years

629
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,040
People don't even stick 
to a job for a year

630
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,680
They keep jumping 
jobs like monkeys

631
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,760
We are swag!

632
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,680
Of course

633
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,880
All the memories from my 
joining day are still fresh

634
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,120
Yeah man

635
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,120
I remember it very well, Jeni

636
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,200
You were so different 
when you joined here

637
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,200
You used to change the TV channel 
the moment they air whisper ads

638
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,560
But now?

639
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,280
She is carrying three 
condoms in her bag!

640
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,560
- Whoa! 
- Ok! Calm down. It's ok

641
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,120
Sir, let's leave

642
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,080
We'll meet at our new office on Monday

643
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,040
Aren't you locking the gate?

644
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,560
Why lock up an empty place?

645
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,800
It feels heavy to lock this building

646
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,400
It's a brand new lock. Atleast I will 
use it for my home

647
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,240
See you

648
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,640
- Bye 
- Take care

649
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,960
I have an idea

650
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,560
You heard the security. 
He was so emotional

651
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,600
We lived here for five years

652
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,280
How about we spend some time here and 
cherish our memories for the one last time?

653
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,520
- Nice idea 
- It's risky

654
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,000
Why is it risky?

655
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,480
It's Kamini's birthday

656
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,560
Let's party here instead 
of somewhere else

657
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,960
My family will be waiting. I gotta go

658
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,520
Hold on

659
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,800
You guys worked here for five years! 
I joined hardly a month ago

660
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,640
I'm going home

661
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,040
- No! No way! 
- Hold on

662
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,760
It's weekend from tomorrow

663
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,240
If we get wasted after getting drunk 
no one's going to look for us. Got it?

664
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,680
So, shut up and stay back

665
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,560
Just one day dude. 
Go home late

666
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,520
- Cool? 
- Kiddo!

667
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
What an innocent guy

668
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,520
Innocent? You mean him?

669
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,840
He can smell a girl from far away and 
exactly tell the perfume she uses

670
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,120
You think he's innocent?

671
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,800
He wants to go home and smoke up 
a joint with his family

672
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,240
- Yours is a joint family, right? 
- Yes

673
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,960
Ok guys, who are 
boozing tonight?

674
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,920
- Me! Me! Me! 
- Ouch! My hand!

675
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,360
Cheers!

676
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,520
- Happy birthday to me! 
- Happy birthday, Kamini

677
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,120
Happy birthday, Kamini!

678
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,760
Ok, what do we do now?

679
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
I'll suggest an idea

680
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,480
Let's play sing along

681
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,560
Lame! Don't you know 
any other better game?

682
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,120
So, tell me this...

683
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,560
do we have to pay royalty for 
singing songs in Sing along?

684
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,360
May be. Who knows

685
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,360
Then, forget it

686
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Cool, Let me start

687
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Wait

688
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,240
"Does the Little 
sparrow has any plan?"

689
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,160
Yeah! It needs a Family plan!

690
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,360
Are you all ganging up on me?

691
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,080
Wait, I'll attack you with 
an emotional song

692
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,360
Go ahead!

693
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,480
Quick

694
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,320
"Just a young gun with a quick fuse.."

695
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,200
Hold on...

696
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,880
Why did you look at him and sing 
'Young gun with a quick fuse?'

697
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
Birthday baby...

698
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,320
Why are you quiet?

699
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,800
I'm busy eating

700
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
She's laughing

701
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,160
Kamini...

702
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,520
How old are you?

703
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,320
Twenty plus

704
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,120
Girls! No matter how high you are, 
you will never reveal your age.

705
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,400
Hey, I'm sorry

706
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,800
Happy birthday, baby

707
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,240
Thank you!

708
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,840
Don't bite my nose

709
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,720
Forget it, dude

710
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,760
She can never be yours.

711
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,440
There can't be two knives 
in a single holder

712
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Why bro? I have seen it

713
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,720
Single holder with two knives

714
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,480
Shut up, you pervert!

715
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,720
Shut up!

716
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,680
There can't be two knives 
in one holder, dude

717
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,840
Hey Jeni. Why are you so sad?

718
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,880
What happened?

719
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,480
What happened, babes?

720
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:03,960
What?

721
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,000
I couldn't show up 
to read the news...

722
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,960
and the mongrel Senthil embarrassed 
me in front of everyone!

723
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,160
It was so embarrassing

724
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,200
Don't cry, Jeni

725
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,640
- Don't cry, baby 
- Don't cry

726
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
How about we get 
even with Senz sir?

727
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,720
- Call him 
- Awesome buddy

728
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Screw him up

729
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,280
- Here 
- What is it?

730
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,080
Mushroom fried rice

731
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,360
Mushroom?

732
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,880
Yes. Have it

733
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,560
Here, you too have some

734
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,960
Hello

735
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,800
Hello, is this Senz sir's...

736
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,160
Senthil sir's residence?

737
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,400
Yes sir

738
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,840
May I know who is speaking?

739
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,360
Isn't he there?

740
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,320
He is lying on the top sir

741
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,800
His wife?

742
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,720
She is lying down and 
he is on the top

743
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,720
And what are you doing?

744
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,680
I am holding the lamp, sir

745
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,320
Here, eat

746
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,880
She is holding the lamp!

747
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,280
Quiet. My mom's calling me

748
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,360
Quiet, her mom's call

749
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,200
- Her mom? 
- Oh. Nirma is her mom?

750
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,480
Nirma isn't her mother

751
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,040
All mothers are same

752
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,160
Tell me, mom

753
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,600
Where are you? It's late night 
11 and you aren't home yet

754
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,680
Mom, I'm still at work

755
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm with my friends

756
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,320
Once work is over, I'll eat out with 
them and come home.

757
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,040
You go to bed

758
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,240
Why do you eat out and 
spoil your health?

759
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,360
It's your birthday...

760
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,440
I had prepared Gulab Jamun

761
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Mom, didn't I have 
my lunch at home?

762
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,000
Please, let me be in peace mom

763
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,040
Come on. Come to me, dear

764
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,200
Even Tom Cruise can't beat you! 
Dude, don't sit on the food!

765
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,440
How many times have I told you to intimate 
me if you're gonna reach home late?

766
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,960
Guess, all the booze 
effect will wear off

767
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,160
Kamini...

768
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,920
are you drunk?

769
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,400
N...No, mom

770
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,520
Don't you lie to me

771
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,880
Swear on me!

772
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,560
Come on...

773
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,520
Yes, I'm drunk

774
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,440
Mom, drinking isn't a big deal

775
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,400
Today people drink wine at home 
for a glowing skin

776
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,720
Mom...

777
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,120
Mom, say something

778
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,160
Don't talk to me

779
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,280
I was so happy to watch 
you as news anchor today

780
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,840
It's all in vain now

781
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,080
I raised you with great difficulties 
yet is this how you behave?

782
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,960
What's lost now?

783
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,200
Why are you crying now?

784
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,680
Stop crying first!

785
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
Did I fail you at any point?

786
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,520
Didn't I read news on the 
channel, just the way you wanted?

787
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,600
Just because you like to see me in Saree, 
I wore one and anchored

788
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,120
Poor Jenifer, I even had to 
lock her up in the restroom...

789
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,160
Jeni, I don't anything about it

790
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,840
Ok ,mom...

791
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,840
you hang up now. 
I'll talk to you later

792
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,840
Look!

793
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,320
Don't come home drunk like your dad does!

794
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,440
Now why would you compare 
me with that guy?

795
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,080
Don't you come back home!

796
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,360
Hang up! I'm not coming home

797
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,000
Don't call me, hereafter

798
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,000
Jeni?

799
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,120
What happened to you, Jeni?

800
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,760
Dude, she is crying

801
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,520
Sorry, Jeni

802
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,920
It's ok. Don't cry

803
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,200
Why did you lock me 
in the restroom?

804
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,160
You wanna lock horns now?

805
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,240
Sorry

806
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,080
You think a sorry will 
make things right?

807
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,240
Do you have any idea how embarrassed 
I was because of you?

808
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,840
Weren't you standing right 
next to me and laughing?

809
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,840
Why did you do it?

810
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,840
Because we had a bet!

811
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,440
You showed off. Glorifying news reading 
and mocked me I am incapable for it

812
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,600
That is why...

813
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,160
I proved that I can do it

814
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,920
Guess what...

815
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,040
There was not even a single mistake!

816
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,520
You haven't won the bet yet

817
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,320
Remember the bet?

818
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,160
The deal is to remove dress one by one 
while reading the news

819
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,040
Oh.

820
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,960
Is that what you are looking for?

821
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,440
Fine...

822
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,520
I'll do the naked news thing

823
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,240
Kamini...

824
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,320
Kamini!

825
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,680
Super Kamini!

826
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,200
I'll record it

827
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,600
Countdown starts

828
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,520
Three!

829
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,480
Two!

830
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,400
One! Come on, Kamini

831
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Greetings

832
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,400
I'm your news anchor, Kamini

833
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,560
Awesome!

834
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,520
#TAG TV's new news anchor, Kamini...

835
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,240
gets a amazing reception

836
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,960
Kamini, no!

837
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,800
Though it was a last 
minute decision..

838
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,200
still her quick wits helped Kamini 
win the hearts of the viewers

839
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,960
Awesome! There you go!

840
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,880
Wow! Awesome!

841
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,960
Hey Mr. Dumped, dont 
record to take revenge.

842
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,960
Dont play with her life

843
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,400
Shut up! I'll take care

844
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,920
The self made Tamil queen who is 
the usual news anchor of #TAG TV

845
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,720
The lightning speaker!

846
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,200
- The Glam Doll 
- Whoa!

847
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,560
The one with a rotten 
pumpkin face...

848
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,560
Oh that lady?

849
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,080
Jenifer...

850
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,440
she was...

851
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,320
locked up in the toilet

852
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,480
That's it

853
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,280
Careful

854
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,920
How dare you?

855
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,080
Wow! Wrestling!

856
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,640
Punch on her face! Come on, Jeni!

857
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,840
Jeni! Come on!

858
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,880
How dare you?

859
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,680
His family jewels are hurt!

860
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,240
Wait

861
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,880
Now, what?

862
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,920
What happened?

863
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,520
Now, what's wrong with him?

864
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,400
What was that booze we had?

865
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,720
Everything around me is swirling

866
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,600
Yes, dude. 
My perspective is changing

867
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,200
You should have let me go home 
instead of pulling my leg!

868
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,760
How do you feel now, 90s kids?

869
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,320
How was that mushroom fried rice?

870
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,360
Isn't it just a fried rice?

871
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,120
It's not just any 
ordinary fried rice

872
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,920
It's magic mushroom

873
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,760
I just mixed a little bit

874
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,200
Leave me

875
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,920
I think she is having a bad trip

876
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,920
She is having a bad trip!

877
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,160
Attention!

878
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,840
Breaking news

879
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,160
High on trip; Jenifer collapses...

880
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,880
Kamini...quiet

881
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,680
Hey, Jeni!

882
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,520
Watch me, baby

883
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,040
Watch me!

884
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,480
Living up to the meaning 
of your name, Kamini?

885
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,720
Aren't you a good girl?

886
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,800
Wear it

887
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,880
Dare you bet with me

888
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,280
Jeni, are you ok?

889
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,440
I am Kamini!

890
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,880
You want me to read the news naked?

891
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,720
I said, don't shoot

892
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,520
Hey...hey...pussy cat...

893
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,800
Not only reading the news naked...

894
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,360
If I bet I can spend the whole 
night naked alone in this building?

895
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,480
Kamini...

896
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,920
Wanna bet?

897
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,200
Look, how she's behaving

898
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,440
Dude. I'm holding my nerve just for you

899
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,680
"You..."

900
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,720
"Are you the rainbow?"

901
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:55,160
"Are you here in search of colors?"

902
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,480
"Tell me, oh Snow white flower"

903
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,720
"Hey, you..."

904
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:35,280
"Are you an object on display?"

905
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,960
"Admiring yourself?"

906
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,040
'AADAI 
[Dress]'

907
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,240
"Is that all you do?"

908
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,920
Hey!

909
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,880
Stop kidding guys!

910
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,040
Anybody there?

911
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,400
Deepak!

912
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,680
Gowri!

913
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,760
Hey!

914
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,080
I have an idea

915
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,400
How about we get inside, cherish our 
memories and have fun for one last time?

916
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,560
Cheers!

917
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,560
Happy birthday to me!

918
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,960
Happy birthday, Kamini

919
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,360
Mushroom fried rice

920
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,120
Mushroom?

921
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,680
It's magic mushroom!

922
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,320
Hey Aakash...

923
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,000
It's late night 11 and 
you aren't home yet

924
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,200
Why did you do it?

925
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,680
Because we had a bet!

926
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,280
Hey Mr. Dumped, don't record to take 
revenge. Don't play with her life

927
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,640
Shut up! I'll take care

928
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,280
Remember the bet?

929
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,200
The bet was to remove your dress one by one 
while reading the news, until you're naked

930
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,800
"Is that all you got? 
Bring it on, if not!"

931
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,400
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. 
Happy to see you all present here

932
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,000
Since we all gather and meet 
up here only once in a year...

933
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,000
we've arranged a special 
performance to entertain you all

934
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,240
So, give it up for 
Oorka Rocket band!

935
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,320
Damn!

936
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,160
Damn!

937
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,920
I must get out

938
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,440
I must get out

939
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,560
Sugumar was the one who 
was recording a video

940
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,240
I'll kill him if I get hold of him!

941
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,760
Probably I can get out 
of here after sunset

942
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,480
Crap!

943
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,920
(Phone ringtone)

944
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,240
(Phone ringtone)

945
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,960
(Phone ringtone)

946
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,080
Hello

947
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,240
What is it?

948
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,240
Can't he wait for a few minutes?

949
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,160
Tell him I'll be there at once

950
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,360
(Phone ringtone)

951
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,800
Not a good idea

952
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,680
Deepak

953
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,080
'Your account has run out of balance.'

954
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,360
Please E-recharge on Air wave.com 
or Air wave app to continue

955
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,400
Idiot!

956
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,760
'Press #1 for Police department'

957
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,800
Else cut the call

958
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,080
'Press #1 for Police department'

959
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,040
I'm calling the emergency number but it's 
connecting to the police control room

960
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,360
If I take the cops help, 
media will come in to play

961
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,320
Shit

962
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,080
What do I do? What do I do?

963
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,480
Customer care?

964
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,120
Good morning, madam. Thanks for 
calling Air Wave customer care

965
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,440

01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,080

01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,040
Thanks for calling Air

Only the opposite sex 
answer the calls always

972
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,600
Fraudsters!

973
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,320
Good morning, Ms, Kamini. Thanks for 
calling Air Wave customer care

974
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,080
How may I help you?

975
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,320
Actually, I have a problem

976
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,200
Tell me, madam

977
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,160
My number has exhausted 
it's balance

978
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,920
Also, I cannot step out 
and recharge my number

979
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,280
I shall give you my debit card details. 
Can you please recharge it for me

980
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,880
Sorry madam, we do not have 
such services available

981
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,200
Please go to the 
nearest Air Wave store...

982
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,840
and you can choose a plan 
and recharge your number

983
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,280
Like I said, I cannot step out now

984
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,760
- Please 
- Sorry madam. Pardon us

985
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,320
What ever is the issue, please 
go to the nearest store and...

986
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,480
I said I cannot step 
out, you wretch!

987
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,000
Sorry. I know you guys 
will record all the calls

988
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,200
I'm stuck in a situation. 
Please believe me

989
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,480
Aren't you a women? 
So please try to understand

990
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,360
Sorry madam, we receive millions 
of such prank calls on daily basis

991
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,320
No! No! No! Come here 
if you don't trust me

992
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,400
I'm begging you

993
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,440
I'll pay you! Please!

994
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,800
Thank you for calling 
Air Wave customer care

995
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,800
Idiots! Wonder from 
where do they call up

996
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,520
What happened? Did any 
guy play prank on you?

997
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,440
No. It was a girl. Looks like...

998
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,840
she is stuck some situation 
and wants us to recharge

999
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,840
A girl?

1000
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,560
How many news do we 
come across such news?

1001
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,400
What if she really needs help?

1002
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,720
I'm saying something but then 
you're immersed in your mobile

1003
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,080
Mom, you have called me 18 times...

1004
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,880
Call me one more time, mom

1005
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,280
You! Won't you spare 
even a mannequin?

1006
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,160
No ma'am...err...

1007
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,840
- She is rocking, right? 
- Don't talk

1008
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,960
It is to bust such womanizers 
like you...

1009
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,120
- Hello 
- Hello

1010
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,440
- Taste buds? 
- Yes, madam

1011
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,840
I'm stuck here in a prob...err..no. 
Well...

1012
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,480
Do you guys deliver food?

1013
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,200
Order for Rs. 1000 or above 
and delivery is free

1014
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,160
Okay! How much will five 
mutton biriyani cost?

1015
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,800
One second madam... Rs. 1015/- madam

1016
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,360
Ok. Five mutton biriyanis

1017
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,600
Ok, madam. Your mobile 
number and address?

1018
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,160
173, Venkateshwara 
Nagar, Nungambakkam

1019
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,480
Ok madam. Our delivery boy will 
deliver the food in half an hour

1020
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,520
Don't you have delivery girl 
instead of a delivery boy?

1021
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,480
Delivery girl?

1022
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,240
Well, the reason I'm asking this is...

1023
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,200
See I am all by 
myself at my home

1024
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,000
Just worried if the delivery 
boy will take advantage of me

1025
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,400
Madam, you say you are all alone but 
you just ordered 5 mutton Biriyanis

1026
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,840
I am having few doubts. Can I 
trust you with this order?

1027
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,440
No worries, it's all ok

1028
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,600
Send in delivery boy

1029
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:56,160
Don't send in a well built guy. Send 
someone who is young, thin and dummy . Ok?

1030
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:56,720
Please

1031
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,880
We'll try our best ma'am

1032
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,920
- Ok. Sure 
- Ok, thank you

1033
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,000
Come in

1034
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,320
Please come in

1035
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,960
See that, dude?

1036
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,320
When the channel 
office was here...

1037
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,720
and every time we came here for collecting 
donation for our deity's rituals...

1038
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,280
The security guys go...

1039
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:10,960
What is it?

1040
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,640
Who asked you to come? 
Why are you here?

1041
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,960
Sign here 
Wait over there

1042
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,800
They used to torture us

1043
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,760
But now, the whole building is empty

1044
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,160
There is not even a single 
soul to question us!

1045
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,480
Of course. It was strict order 
from the court to vacate

1046
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,920
Fine, come on. Let's try our 
luck and see if we get anything

1047
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,120
What are we gonna do in 
such an empty place?

1048
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,440
Nothing's here. Let's go back

1049
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,360
Listen you pot head. 
Just shut up and come

1050
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,760
If we don't get anything let's 
use the toilet at least

1051
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,920
What are you doing?

1052
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,200
Now, watch me!

1053
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,720
I too can break a brick!

1054
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,520
Wake up

1055
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,600
Dude, let me have this

1056
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,360
Dude, don't break it

1057
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,000
Nope. They have nailed it

1058
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,960
Hello!

1059
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,560
Leave!

1060
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,360
Let go of my hand!

1061
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,800
Leave

1062
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,240
I said, leave me

1063
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,000
Anybody there?

1064
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,360
It's too silent over here

1065
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,800
Security!

1066
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,160
Hello!

1067
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,360
What is this?

1068
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,720
Dude...

1069
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,960
it's a murder

1070
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
What do you mean?

1071
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,520
Some guys seem to have molested 
and finished off a girl

1072
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,440
Look, even her 
buttons are undone

1073
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,440
Dude, I'm scared

1074
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,280
Lets not invite trouble. 
Come on, let's go

1075
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,120
Leave? Why are you amused 
looking at the corpse?

1076
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,720
Let's inform the police at once

1077
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,760
Police?

1078
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,680
Dude, the murder has taken 
place at a new channel office

1079
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,280
If the other TV channels 
find out about this...

1080
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,920
it'll be like lottery for them. 
They will feast on it for days

1081
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,400
Hence, let's inform the police

1082
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,120
We'll become celebrities and will 
be all over the media and social media

1083
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,480
Our faces will become familiar

1084
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,800
We can show off in front 
of the girls in our area

1085
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,280
- Of course 
- Hast la vista, dude!

1086
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,280
What's the number to 
reach the police?

1087
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,680
- Watch out! 
- What is it?

1088
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,440
Why would you place 
hands over there?

1089
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,000
You'll get caught if they analyze 
the place for fingerprints

1090
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,920
Put your hands in your pocket

1091
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,560
I said, hands in your pocket!

1092
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,200
Hello, is this R2 police station?

1093
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,680
- Dad 
- Tell me, dear

1094
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,240
There is a new phone in the market 
which unlocks using face recognition

1095
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,440
Buy me one

1096
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,520
Both our faces look similar

1097
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,400
I'll unlock your phone and frisk it. 
Are you ok with it?

1098
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,120
No. No need.

1099
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,880
Let me check 
another model online

1100
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,920
Hang up!

1101
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,280
Sir!

1102
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,520
What's the noise?

1103
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,760
Damn it! Torture!

1104
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,000
Can't even relax on a holiday

1105
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,240
Did you inform the forensic?

1106
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,120
Pardon sir

1107
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,920
The guys who check the fingerprints

1108
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,480
Oh, you mean forensic team. 
Informed them sir.

1109
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,560
They'll be here soon

1110
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,480
Is she breathing?

1111
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,880
I did check. She has kicked the bucket

1112
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,560
Mind your language! What do you 
mean by 'She kicked the bucket'?

1113
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,120
”Birth and death..”

1114
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,200
What's that noise?

1115
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,680
Twitter users have 
organized an event called...

1116
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,640
'Mega tweet up' to meet 
and greet each other

1117
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,560
Did you search all over the building?

1118
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,240
I thought I'll seek your permission first

1119
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,800
You don't seek my permission 
when it is a must

1120
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,360
And wait for my order 
when it is not needed!

1121
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,440
I'll skin you alive! Get lost!

1122
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,280
Run!

1123
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,400
"Nothing is in hands! Nothing in hands!"

1124
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,640
"There is nothing in your hands"

1125
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,840
"Nothing in hands! Nothing in hands!"

1126
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,400
"There is nothing in your hands"

1127
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,000
"In the hands of god the creator, 
we are all puppets"

1128
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,120
"Time and tide are 
nothing but myth"

1129
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,600
"Focus on your dream"

1130
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,800
"Do not have fear or worries"

1131
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,720
"All you need is Love and support"

1132
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,800
"It makes you a real human being"

1133
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,440
Take that

1134
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,520
Hello

1135
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,040
Where?

1136
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,520
When?

1137
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,280
These things are supposed 
to be personal...

1138
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,840
Sir, its shocking!

1139
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,760
I didn't even find a piece of paper 
in this entire building

1140
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,360
All I found was this cigarette bud

1141
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,520
Hey. I just threw it after smoking

1142
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,040
Sir...

1143
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,560
I found a high heel 
shoe from the bathroom

1144
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,120
Sir, with all those broken beer bottles, 
I can assure you that killer was drunk

1145
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,720
But then this shoe doesn't 
belong to the victim

1146
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,400
That's what confusing me, sir

1147
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,520
Is it just a murder or a rape and murder. 
I am clueless!

1148
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,360
Check for Semen traces sir

1149
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,800
- Who are these fellows? 
- They are the ones who informed us sir

1150
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,560
How do you know about semen tracing?

1151
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,680
Well that, last week I 
went for a horror flick

1152
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,600
A movie in which the even the 
ghost rape girls. Quite funny!

1153
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,920
- What movie was that? 
- No idea sir

1154
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,200
Sir, the press members 
are waiting downstairs

1155
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,760
Look here, don't blabber anything 
when you see the camera and mic

1156
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,600
Just say as instructed by us. 
Got it?

1157
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,640
Move!

1158
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,320
You, keep an eye on them

1159
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,320
Ok sir

1160
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,640
Who said she is dead?

1161
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,960
She is still alive. 
Come, help me lift her

1162
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:30,880
"Even valuables are a 
myth that can be stolen"

1163

"Wake up but only to 
achieve your dreams"

1164
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,880
What are you up to? Keep moving!

1165
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,000
You, go guard that place

1166
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,120
"Life consists of nothing but 
worries and false promises"

1167
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,160
"For the banks across..."

1168
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,880
- Put these two in the jeep! 
- Sir!

1169
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,720
"Even the stars are a myth"

1170
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,640
"Is the situation under control?"

1171
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,960
"Or until it gets better, do you 
think everything is a myth?"

1172
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,320
You! Hands out of pocket!

1173
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,040
"We see light in the morning"

1174
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:02,720
"And if it keeps changing 
then its a myth again"

1175
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,720
"Ask my heart and it says 'This 
isn't wrong' 'This is nothing'"

1176
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,920
"Nothing is wrong"

1177
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,400
"Nothing is wrong! 
Nothing is wrong!"

1178
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,720
"Noting is wrong over here"

1179
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,040
"In the hands of god the creator, 
we are all puppets"

1180
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,320
"Time and tide are 
nothing but myth"

1181
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,840
"Focus on your dream"

1182
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,040
"Do not have fear or worries"

1183
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,640
"All you need is 
Love and support"

1184
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,200
"It makes you a real human being"

1185
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,520
Don't you get signal?

1186
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,880
I will go that side and talk

1187
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,200
- Hello 
- Hello

1188
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:51,960
Yes sir?

1189
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,280
That girl's issue has taken a new 
diversion. No need to guard there

1190
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:54,920
Ok, sir.

1191
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,760
Both of you return to 
the police station

1192
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,320
I'll bring him along too. 
Ok, sir

1193
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,080
Looks like that girl's issue 
has take a new diversion.

1194
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,240
We have been ordered to return

1195
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,920
Hey! Hey! Stop!

1196
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,640
Stop being a pain in the head. 
What now?

1197
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,520
I think I saw someone 
shadow inside the building

1198
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,480
Shut up and come with me

1199
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,520
What did you do?

1200
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,400
I pressed it and it switched on

1201
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,320
Turn on all the lights! 
Turn them all!

1202
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,760
I'll inform sir and come back

1203
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,440
What are you doing here?

1204
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,560
Do you have a torch light?

1205
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,160
I gave it to actor Kamal sir. 
Why don't you mind your business?

1206
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,280
Well, I feel like someone's 
hiding inside the building

1207
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,440
Rubbish! You couldn't even find 
a shoe that was in the toilet

1208
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,960
You think you'll 
find the accused?

1209
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,360
This fellow I tell you!

1210
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,440
Already that delivery girl's 
issue has become an issue

1211
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,640
Inspector ordered us to return. 
Isn't it?

1212
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,320
What are you looking for?

1213
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,160
Are you coming or should I start 
abusing you and your family?

1214
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,640
Stop pissing me off!

1215
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,800
Hello

1216
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,360
Hello Sugumar, I'm stuck 
with a problem here

1217
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,120
My phone is about 
to die any moment

1218
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,960
Where are you all?

1219
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,440
What happened last night?

1220
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,480
What did you guys do?

1221
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,680
Kamini you are saying all those 
that we are supposed to say

1222
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:55,080
We are stuck in a 
big mess over here

1223
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,840
We thought you'll save us but 
you say you're stuck?

1224
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:58,960
Give me the phone

1225
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,040
Give me the phone. 
I said, give me the phone

1226
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,160
- Sir, just a minute 
- I said, give me the phone!

1227
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,920
I thought you will call your advocate 
instead you are calling a girl?

1228
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,240
Hello, who is this?

1229
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,440
Who are you?

1230
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:11,920
What?

1231
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,600
There you go! Damn it!

1232
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,600
I'm a police officer 
from E3 station

1233
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,680
Police station?

1234
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,840
What did they do, sir?

1235
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,480
Don't ask me...

1236
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,000
Stop. Stop

1237
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,920
Did your vehicle have a flat tyre? 
Want lift?

1238
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,960
Show me your license

1239
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,400
- What was that? 
- License

1240
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,320
Hold on. See the bike's 
going off balance

1241
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,200
- Sir! Hold on! 
- Excuse me! Hold on!

1242
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,800
Superb. Hand it over to him

1243
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,000
Hand me back my keys

1244
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,760
Superb! Superb! Superb!

1245
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,720
I asked for license and you 
show me your aadhar card!

1246
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,760
How dare you throw away the Aadhar card? 
You Anti-Indian!

1247
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,920
Get down and step aside

1248
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,040
Ok. Ok. Guys step down

1249
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,000
Get down and step aside

1250
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,040
Stand in a line!

1251
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,200
I'll stand first in the line!

1252
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,720
- No, I'll be first 
- What's with the noise?

1253
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,480
Sir! They are not standing in a line!

1254
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,320
Stop acting like Ajith Kumar!

1255
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,320
Just stand over there!

1256
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:09,400
I'll stand first

1257
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,040
Blow

1258
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,560
Are you doubting me?

1259
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:15,840
I said, blow! Blow!

1260
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:17,280
I am drunk!

1261
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,400
Cool. Relax

1262
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,080
You talk to him. 
I don't like his face

1263
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,240
Sir...

1264
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,160
will anyone tell men to....

1265
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,720
Double meaning

1266
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,400
Sir, only you can control them.

1267
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,520
Yes, sir. Only you 
can control us

1268
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,680
Look here, he is wearing 
diaper on the face

1269
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:47,240
I will video him and 
upload on the internet

1270
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,480
Set to HQ only then his 
face will be visible

1271
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,160
- Focus on his face 
- Go Live on FB

1272
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:53,280
Check out his arms?

1273
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:56,080
Arms must be an inch 
bigger than the shirt

1274
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,680
But instead you wear a smaller 
shirt and show off Mr...

1275
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,960
Radha Ravi? Why showing 
off Mr. Radha Ravi?

1276
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,840
- Dude I have doubt 
- Go ahead

1277
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,600
Nizhagal Ravi got his name 
because he did Nizhagal

1278
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,080
Indeed

1279
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,680
Jayam Ravi got his name 
because he did Jayam

1280
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,160
Indeed! He is he leading star

1281
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,120
Then what does Radha Ravi mean?

1282
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,440
Sir, you could have better 
named yourself as...

1283
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,840
- 'Silent' Ravi 
- Yes sir. That suits you

1284
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,000
What happened, Akash?

1285
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,600
I was about to sin without 
realizing it is an idol

1286
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,080
Come on! Come on!

1287
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,360
- Dude, you've sinned! 
- Let pray for forgiveness

1288
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,400
Bash them up and put 
them in lock-up!

1289
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,800
Our officer will let go of all 
that you did last night

1290
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,760
But these guys called a water tank as 
Lord's idol and worshipped it last night

1291
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,320
Which he won't forgive

1292
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,080
You put us in this mess!

1293
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,600
Shut up for a while!

1294
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,480
- Hello...Hello 
- Hello

1295
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:01,720
Hello?

1296
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,360
She hanged up the call

1297
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:04,400
Hello!

1298
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,880
Sir, give me one last chance sir

1299
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,240
I'm worried about my girlfriend

1300
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,400
Whom are you gonna call?

1301
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,240
My uncle, ItIs Sreesanth

1302
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,160
He is a rebel

1303
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,400
A rebel?

1304
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,520
He is a celebrity in twitter!

1305
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,360
That's why I said...

1306
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,480
We already have enough nuisance 
from all the existing celebrities

1307
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,240
And now Twitter celebrities?

1308
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,600
Why?

1309
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,800
How dare you shoot us and 
upload the video on the net?

1310
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,800
Already inspector saw that video 
hundreds of times

1311
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,160
Let him come

1312
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,360
Let the inspector come!

1313
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,800
What happened, Kamini?

1314
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,120
Are you afraid?

1315
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,200
It's really strange

1316
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,600
Aren't you a brave girl?

1317
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,720
Didn't you hear them shout outside?

1318
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:51,840
"Is that all you got? 
Bring it on, if not!"

1319
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,840
Doesn't that suit you perfect?

1320
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,640
Whoa...

1321
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,120
and now you're crying?

1322
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,760
Why is the stomach aching?

1323
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,840
Guess it's the hunger

1324
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,520
Hey stomach, I'm on the 
run to save my honor...

1325
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,240
and you want food?

1326
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,760
Mom!

1327
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,120
Poor mommy...

1328
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,000
She must be sleepless, 
waiting for me

1329
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,480
Don't worry mom

1330
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,840
I'll be back

1331
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,880
I'll be back with my honor intact!

1332
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,880
I won't make you bow your 
head out of shame, mom

1333
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,040
I won't let you bow 
your head down in shame

1334
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:43,280
"Are you a rainbow?"

1335
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,440
Why didn't you wait for one more day?

1336
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,920
Your daughter went missing and you 
came down to the police station?

1337
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,240
Did you inquire?

1338
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,360
Sir...

1339
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:55,200
When I spoke to her 
last time on phone..

1340
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,480
she was drunk

1341
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,320
Yeah! Mention that first!

1342
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,920
You have done a good job 
raising your daughter!

1343
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,880
Go and sit there. 
I'll call you

1344
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,360
Sir...

1345
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:23,840
"Are you an object on display?"

1346
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:30,520
"Are you all that you see?"

1347
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:35,040
Feels so good making fun 
of this higher officer!

1348
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:39,040
This officer looks like that innocent 
kid from that ad right? What was that?

1349
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,080
Yes! That diaper ad kid! 
He looks like that kid!

1350
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:45,880
He asked license...but you are...

1351
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,520
Sir, please let go of me

1352
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,920
"Are you a snow white 
flower searching for colors?

1353
01:44:54,480 --> 01:45:00,320
"Are you an object on display?"

1354
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:10,000
"Are you all that you see?"

1355
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:18,600
"I'm a soul that yearns to 
leave behind its flawed body"

1356
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:23,000
"I don't have the nerve to 
remove this stains that remain"

1357
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:27,960
"I'm a soul that yearns to 
leave behind its flawed body"

1358
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:33,120
"I don't have the nerve to 
remove this stains that remain"

1359
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:38,840
"Hey! You have time on your 
hands and wind in your sails!"

1360
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,480
"All you need is you!"

1361
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:48,440
"Hey! There is will 
and there is a way"

1362
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:51,160
"All you need is this life!"

1363
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,400
We were riding in a bike and we were drunk

1364
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,400
We slipped and fell down

1365
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,960
And we injured our head, legs and arms

1366
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,760
The cops helped us

1367
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:10,000
Instead of being thankful, 
we mocked the police

1368
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,360
Please do not drink and drive 
thinking it's real heroism

1369
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,800
Please don't spoil your life

1370
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,440
The police department 
is your friend

1371
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,760
Sir, we said it all

1372
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,640
"The weary heart that shackles 
its dream and crosses the shore"

1373
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,200
"I'm drowning in a leak 
that I can't seem to fix"

1374
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:28,680
"Hey! You have time on your 
hands and wind in your sails"

1375
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,880
"All you need is you!"

1376
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:37,440
"Hey! There is will 
and there is a way"

1377
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,080
"All you need is this life!"

1378
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:31,920
Sir

1379
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,040
Sir!

1380
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,800
Sir! Sir! Please help me

1381
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:42,120
I'm stuck here without any dress

1382
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,520
Can you help me? 
Please give me your raincoat.

1383
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,440
You already have the umbrella

1384
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:48,840
Hello!

1385
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,760
Why are you quiet?

1386
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:53,360
I can't bear it anymore. 
I'm starving.

1387
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,280
I'm feeling cold. Look at this

1388
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,120
My hands and legs are bruised

1389
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,200
Please help me. Please help me! Please!

1390
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,240
Hey! Stop!

1391
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,000
Didn't you run in back here 
thinking it was the cops?

1392
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,160
No!

1393
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,560
I have seen you somewhere...

1394
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,640
Weren't you the one 
came to deliver food?

1395
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,560
And I hit you on the head! 
Why did you do this to me?

1396
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,960
Tell me, why?

1397
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,120
Can't you hear me talking? 
Where are you off to?

1398
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,600
Answer me

1399
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,560
Now I'll do the same to you!

1400
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,840
Let go off me!

1401
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:13,080
Stop!

1402
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:15,800
Let go of me!

1403
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,160
I'm not leave you

1404
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,320
Let go of me!

1405
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,760
Stop

1406
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,920
Remember me?

1407
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:26,320
Have a good trip 
to the city, dear

1408
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,840
(Song from 'Paarthal Pasi Theerum')

1409
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:28,920
Excuse me...

1410
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,640
What happened? 
What happened Sister?

1411
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:36,960
Please open your eyes and look at me. 
Please!

1412
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,360
It's paining real bad. 
Help me, its paining

1413
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,880
Anybody there? Help!

1414
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,840
Don't worry, sister. 
Nothing will happen to you

1415
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,200
Water...

1416
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,560
Water...

1417
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:59,640
You're losing blood

1418
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,880
Excuse me. What's your blood group? 
Please don't faint

1419
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:06,960
Excuse me

1420
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:09,520
Please stop

1421
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:13,320
Come, let's go to the hospital

1422
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,440
I can't bear the pain!

1423
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,000
Please. I'm helpless

1424
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,240
Come help me lift her. 
She is serious

1425
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:23,640
She is dying. 
Have a heart and step up!

1426
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,680
Hey, Why are you yelling at me?

1427
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:27,920
Look, I am a handicapped

1428
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,040
Call someone and throw 
her inside the rickshaw

1429
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:31,120
Hold on

1430
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,440
Excuse me, a lady is...

1431
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,240
- What is it? 
- Please...

1432
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,840
An individual is hurt on the road.

1433
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,800
She must be admitted in 
hospital immediately

1434
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,680
Can you help me put 
her in the rickshaw?

1435
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,320
Will you pay me? Will you pay me?

1436
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,920
- Help me and I'll pay you 
- Will you pay?

1437
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,280
Ok, I'll pay 
Come

1438
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,720
Hold it

1439
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,960
- Lift her 
- Come on

1440
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,680
Please, quick! Drive to the hospital

1441
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,880
Move her head

1442
01:53:58,920 --> 01:53:59,920
Hold on sister.

1443
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,800
Few more minutes, 
we'll reach the hospital

1444
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:02,920
What happened?

1445
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,280
The rickshaw isn't starting. 
Someone must push it

1446
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,320
Excuse me.

1447
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:11,600
The rickshaw isn't starting. 
Please push it and help to start it

1448
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,720
Nothing. We are on our way

1449
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,960
What in the hell are you doing?

1450
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:19,920
I am pushing. Try starting it

1451
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:23,480
Can't you tell him he is doing it wrong? 
Tell him to push from behind!

1452
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,560
You drunkard! Idiot! Enough!

1453
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:29,080
Enough of your help! Get lost!

1454
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,840
Excuse me!

1455
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,200
Oh God! Sister!

1456
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,000
Somebody please save her!

1457
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:43,760
Prank!

1458
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:46,920
Oh God! Sister!

1459
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:51,280
Prank! It's a prank! 
It's a prank show!

1460
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:58,040
- Relax! It's just a prank show 
- Even I am part of it!

1461
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,040
Look over there

1462
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,400
I was on my way to 
write my UPSC exam

1463
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,800
I passed the prelims 
at my place

1464
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,800
And came to Chennai on that day 
for main exams

1465
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,760
I was searching for the centre

1466
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,840
Instead of going to the exam I helped you 
thinking you were really hurt

1467
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:17,360
I got late for the exam and missed it

1468
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,960
Again I have to start all over from the 
beginning and clear prelims one by one

1469
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:25,000
I lost a year because of you!

1470
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,400
What?

1471
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:32,760
Since you missed you an ordinary exam...

1472
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,280
you took revenge by doing this to me?

1473
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,720
Come again! An ordinary exam?

1474
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,400
You make it sound so easy!

1475
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,480
There are protests going on 
for having and banning exams

1476
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:44,520
Students are made to travel 
1000 of miles to write exams

1477
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,400
Worse, there are dress codes 
while entering a exam hall!

1478
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,880
In the name of security check girls 
students dress were tore before...

1479
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,680
they step inside exam halls!

1480
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:57,480
There are girls hanging themselves 
for failing in entrance exams

1481
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,800
And everything is 
just a game to you?

1482
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,040
Your prank didn't impact me much 
even after I missed my exam

1483
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,920
I let it go thinking after all 
it's just a prank you pulled on me

1484
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:14,280
But then one day, an incident 
changed everything for me

1485
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,160
What happened, mom?

1486
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,680
Nothing, dear. Its so hot 
I am exhausted

1487
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:24,440
Come on, mom. We are almost 
reaching the bus stand

1488
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:29,800
Dear!

1489
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,840
- Oh my God! 
- Mom! Mom!

1490
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,840
Mom, what happened?

1491
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,720
Excuse me, please come here

1492
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:47,200
Mom, please wake up

1493
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,840
- What happened? Did she faint? 
- I don't know what happened

1494
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:51,680
She fainted all of a sudden

1495
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:54,280
Please help. 
Let's get her to sit somewhere

1496
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,600
Please, consider her as your mother 
and help her. God will bless you

1497
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,240
Excuse me!

1498
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,440
Wait, this is a prank show, right?

1499
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,120
Where are the hidden cameras?

1500
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:12,160
Behind that car or somewhere 
behind that tree?

1501
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:15,240
Are you nuts? Can't you see an 
elderly lady has fainted? Move!

1502
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,520
Lift her. First, let's get 
her to sit under a shade

1503
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,320
No uncle, it's a TV show. 
I have watched it quite often

1504
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,800
Can't you differentiate? 
Splash some water on her face

1505
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:24,640
Excuse me...

1506
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,560
It's a prank show!

1507
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:33,600
Oh, come on. It's just a prank

1508
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:36,120
Kamini, that was one 
hell of an acting!

1509
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:37,680
It's just the prank show

1510
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:38,760
Its a prank!

1511
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,920
Show 'Gotcha! Gotcha!'

1512
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:42,680
- Relax 
- Relax

1513
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,640
- Would you like some water? 
- Don't cry

1514
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:48,440
- Come on. Don't cry 
- You look beautiful with the cap

1515
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,480
Look at the camera and say 
'Gotcha! Gotcha!'

1516
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,600
'Gotcha! Gotcha!'

1517
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:52,800
'Gotcha! Gotcha!'

1518
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:56,960
Relax.

1519
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,600
Ok, that's enough. Cut! Cut!

1520
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:39,280
None of them here takes 
anything seriously!

1521
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:40,720
People take everything so easy

1522
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:43,800
Nowadays, in our whole body, only 
thumbs are working overtime

1523
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:46,360
That is using the 
mobile all the time!

1524
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:49,400
Social media and smart phones 
have turned people in to buffoons

1525
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:52,560
Pranking, trolling, pulling leg 
is all everyone does these days

1526
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,640
Facebook and Twitter are 
filled mostly with fake ids

1527
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:56,240
Login and all you find are memes

1528
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:00,080
People bath with a bucket of ice in 
the name of #Ice bucket challenge

1529
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,160
But do they even know why? 
They say it's fun!

1530
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,080
#Freethenipple!

1531
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:06,840
Women are protesting in social media 
so that they can show of their breasts...

1532
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,080
by making #Freethenipple trending

1533
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,640
Back in old days women protested 
to hide their breast

1534
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,280
And women today are 
protesting to show it off

1535
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,960
A stupid medicine student throws 
off a puppy from the tenth floor

1536
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,680
He shoots it and posts it in the internet. 
Why? For fun!

1537
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,640
A guy clicks selfie on railway track while 
train is approaching and dies. Why?

1538
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:28,880
For cheap likes, comments and 
some followers! How cheap!

1539
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:31,680
Why click selfie with a corpse?

1540
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:35,320
Just for fun!

1541
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:38,680
In the name of fun 
people do all this...

1542
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:42,000
and as a result every house 
has kids turning into rogues

1543
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,080
Blah! Blah! Blah!

1544
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:06,240
So, we’re the reason behind all this...

1545
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,480
Is that what you're saying?

1546
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,880
It was just a prank show

1547
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,480
Absurd Prank show. My foot!

1548
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:18,520
When my mom fainted on the streets, the 
guy who came to help stepped back!

1549
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,400
Why?

1550
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:20,960
Because of your show!

1551
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:22,840
If you play unconscious 
and prank people...

1552
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,200
then who will save people when 
they faint for real?

1553
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,840
Already people are confused struggling 
to differentiate wounded...

1554
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,560
and drunk people on road

1555
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:34,600
On top of that, you guys! 'Look, see 
the camera? Say 'Gotcha! Gotcha!'

1556
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,520
You guys deserve a tight 
slap and proper class!

1557
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:42,720
When you deceive someone you 
know, then its called a prank!

1558
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,120
Playing prank on a stranger 
is called Nuisance!

1559
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,040
And that is what you guys are doing

1560
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:54,360
Do not misuse the freedom you have

1561
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,880
It's not my job to 
change all these

1562
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:05,680
This is not a revenge

1563
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:08,480
While driving when someone overtakes 
me and jumps the signal...

1564
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,680
I just stare at them in a way 
that they don't find out

1565
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:13,160
I am just an ordinary person

1566
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,080
That is all I can do

1567
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,680
We have only one chance

1568
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:20,120
I'm still unable to 
complete those exams

1569
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:23,880
Then I started working here

1570
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,320
Kamini!

1571
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:57,440
Do you wanna see me spend the whole 
night alone and naked in this building?

1572
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:01,840
We need more booze! 
Yes! More booze!

1573
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:09,640
Hello, Jeni's father? 
She is drunk and lying wasted at office.

1574
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:11,400
Please, come pick her up

1575
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,280
How much will five 
mutton biriyani cost?

1576
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:49,760
Like you did to me, I also acted 
as if I was fighting for life

1577
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,400
Thought you'd save me.

1578
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,520
Instead you hit me in 
the head with the rod

1579
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,960
When I woke up in the hospital,

1580
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,080
I escaped the eyes of the police 
to rush and check on you!

1581
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:03,720
I thought I'll throw your 
dress inside and escape

1582
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,960
But to my surprise you 
were already at the gate

1583
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:11,760
I expected you won't give a damn 
and walk out naked in the streets

1584
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:13,280
Well, not bad.

1585
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:16,000
You turned out to be 
better than what I thought you were

1586
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:30,560
I...

1587
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:33,560
I hope you understood 
whatever I said

1588
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,000
What did you understand?

1589
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,760
Freedom is not for free

1590
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:53,520
It needs lot of discipline

1591
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:06,040
"Oh Moon! Will you come out 
from the Sky?"

1592
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:09,640
"I need a pair to play"

1593
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:21,680
"Before anyone sees on the Earth 
I'll send you back early in the morning"

1594
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:26,240
You sang it really well

1595
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:31,200
Did you practice music 
professionally?

1596
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:34,360
No sir

1597
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:36,400
My mother's a good singer

1598
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,200
I got it from her

1599
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,720
Very good

1600
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:44,520
Why do you close your 
eyes while singing?

1601
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:51,360
It's natural when you loose 
yourself while singing

1602
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,160
Some girls do it while singing 
and some while kissing

1603
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:01,240
I had mentioned it 
in one of my song lyrics

1604
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,720
So, now...

1605
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:11,800
The industry has changed

1606
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,040
The heroes have started 
writing lyrics

1607
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,640
The music director sings all 
the songs in a movie album

1608
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:17,760
Indeed, sir

1609
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,880
I have written more 
than thousand songs

1610
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:22,920
Even my plight is the same

1611
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,400
You got to look for opportunities, get 
them and then become a chorus singer

1612
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,760
When will you become 
a leading singer?

1613
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,560
Sir, you can open gates for me

1614
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:36,960
Of course, I can do it

1615
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,800
I got contacts

1616
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,320
But why should I do it?

1617
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:44,760
I don't get you, sir

1618
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:45,920
Well, nothing...

1619
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:49,080
Like how you closed your 
eyes while singing...

1620
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:53,520
Likewise close your eyes for 
a little while

1621
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:58,200
But then, isn't this wrong?

1622
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,800
Decency and desire

1623
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:04,200
cant prevail together darling

1624
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:32,880
"First we carry an attitude..."

1625
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:42,600
"living without boundaries, 
limits and with an arrogance"

1626
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:52,560
"Later, we have a 
self realization..."

1627
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:57,560
"and become strong enough to face 
the world alone like a brave heart"

1628
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:02,480
"We turn a new leaf 
and get up, stronger!"

1629
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,880
Famous lyricist caught red handed in 
#MeToo movement

1630
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,280
#TAG TV crew's live report

1631
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,040
Without realizing it was an 
undercover reporter...

1632
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,640
Mr. Rathna Kumar tried molesting a young 
girl, who came looking for opportunity

1633
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:19,240
He also blurted out lot of his 
wrong doings in the process

1634
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:21,720
Decency and desire

1635
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:24,480
cant prevail together darling

1636
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,240
He has been at receiving end 
of many hatred reactions

1637
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:31,600
As the first step, it is expected 
that he'll lose his MP seat

1638
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:35,920
This was made possible only because of the 
daring #TAG TV reporter Kamini

1639
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:40,560
In the recent past a swamiji was exposed in 
a similar incident, which became viral

1640
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,280
I didn't expect it to go haywire

1641
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,880
It's all because of me.

1642
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,840
Please forgive me, sister!

1643
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:05,640
”Hearts shake hands here beautifully”

1644
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:07,600
I'm sorry

1645
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:11,200
It's okay

1646
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:13,640
What's your name?

1647
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:15,920
Nangeli

1648
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,320
”Wounds vanish..”

1649
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,840
Picking up a good habit is tough

1650
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:58,160
Dropping a bad habit is 
equally tough

1651
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,640
Its an addiction

1652
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:03,160
I couldn't come out of it

1653
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:06,840
But I started changing 
my intentions a bit

1654
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:10,960
For #Tag NEWS 
Signing off is Sudhindharakodi

1655
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:21,600
"Freedom isn't a game to be played 
without rules and boundaries"

1656
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:30,440
"Go beyond your limits and 
it will destroy you!"

1657
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:12,240
"One day..."

1658
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:31,680
"Next day..."
