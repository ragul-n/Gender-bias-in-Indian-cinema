00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,052
Greetings, Princess!

2
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,439
You're my daughter, Shivangi.

3
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,174
But don't forget...

4
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,776
...after your wedding,
your real home is with your in-lavvs.

5
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,280
Did you inform them...
about your arrival?

6
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,153
If I wanted to inform them...

7
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,727
...then I would've written
two letters, mother.

8
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,588
But I only came here to share
my troubles...and not add to them.

9
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,394
Sajjangarh is not too far from here...

10
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,800
...and the news of your arrival
won't stay hidden from them.

11
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,467
Their daughter-in-law
returned from England...

12
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,404
...and went home directly.

13
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,508
This could infuriate them.

14
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,443
They've lost the right
to get angry, brother.

15
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,376
What scares me is that...

16
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:53,213
you may lose your cool,
when you find out the truth.

17
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,775
Stop talking in riddles...

18
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,155
You know I like talking
straight to the point.

19
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,382
She will if you let her.

20
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,191
Please speak.

21
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,323
What's wrong with the Prince?

22
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,326
Everything was fine
until the 21st of April.

23
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,634
Veer saa‘ Law exams were over...

24
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,228
...and the results were due soon.

25
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:45,026
"Now that...you're right before me..."

26
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:52,176
"
 wonder what's wrong with me."

27
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,779
"You're making my heart..."

28
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,415
"...skip a beat with your eyes."

29
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:05,446
"Where did you...
earn this new trick?"

30
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:12,589
"
 am with you
everywhere...like a shadow."

31
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:20,096
"Without you...
 am nothing."

32
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:24,036
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

33
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,409
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

34
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:33,008
"
 was unaware...of the moment..."

35
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,313
"O beautiful."

36
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:40,115
"May we stay like this...forever."

37
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,750
"SO be it."

38
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,360
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

39
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:51,164
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

40
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,496
Greetings, Veer.

41
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,597
Out there, in the distant land,
you're the pride of entire Ivlewad...

42
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,234
...and not just Sajangarh alone.

43
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,244
Today, on the eve
of our annual festival...

44
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:05,746
...p
ease accept this
humble gift and grace us.

45
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:10,653
Yours sincerely,
Chief Bansarilal Bismil.

46
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:17,492
"When you're with me..."

47
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:24,993
"...there's nothing else I wish for."

48
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:31,704
"When you smi
e...for me..."

49
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:38,639
"...
'

 lay out my heart."

50
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:46,122
"
 am with you
everywhere...like a shadow."

51
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:53,228
"Without you...
 am nothing."

52
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,163
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

53
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,568
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

54
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:06,009
"
 was unaware...of the moment..."

55
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,977
"O beautiful."

56
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,746
"May we stay like this...forever."

57
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,048
"SO be it."

58
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,521
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

59
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:23,049
"Beautiful... Beautiful."

60
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,615
Dhani saa...

61
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,280
Dhani saa!

62
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,553
Dhani saa...what's wrong with you?

63
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,782
Kesar Ivlaa...

64
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,653
Kesar Ivlaa!

65
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,091
Yes, madam.

66
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,429
Tell the driver to get the car.

67
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,521
We've to go to the hospital.
- Right.

68
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,502
Medical tests performed...

69
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,562
...and blood samples were
sent to bigger hospitals.

70
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,035
Before I could ask
the doctor anything...

71
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,470
Dhani saa...

72
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,540
Dhani saa...what's happening to you?

73
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,046
What's happening to you?

74
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,640
Dhani saa...what's happening to you?

75
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,613
Dhani saa...

76
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,711
I'll go call the doctor.

77
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,311



...

78
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,589
Doctor...

79
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,693
Doctor...come quickly.
- What happened?

80
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,160
My husband, doctor.
Doctor please come with me.

81
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,391
Oh my, God.

82
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,013
Get me Lignocaine 20 mg... Quickly.

83
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,214
What is wrong with him, doctor?

84
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,585
If I am not mistaken, Mrs. Veer...

85
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,254
...your husband is
suffering from Tetanus.

86
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,486
It's a very rare condition.

87
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,397
It affects only one
in a thousand people.

88
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:40,502
The disease was discovered
in Germany by a Japanese doctor.

89
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,264
But no cure has been found yet.

90
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,408
The doctor was explaining to me...

91
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,138
...but I couldn't understand anything.

92
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,570
Except for the fact...

93
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:56,484
...that medical science had
not found a cure for his disease

94
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,122
My only solace was...

95
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,189
...that he would fall asleep
for a while after the injection.

96
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,591
And get some rest too.

97
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,129
Excuse me, ma'am.

98
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,567
There's a call for
you from your residence.

99
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:02,008
George, take me home.
- Yes, madam.

100
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,481
Please hurry up.

101
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,534
This is Black Magic...

102
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,507
The doctor can't cure
him with his injections.

103
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,266
Kesar lvlaa...vvhy would
anyone use Black Magic...

104
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,471
...on a nice guy like him?

105
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,472
He never even raised
his voice on anyone.

106
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,283
You were born in a country
of Ivlahabharat and Ramayan!

107
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:16,124
You'll find Kekeyi and
Duryodhan at every corner.

108
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,425
The Prince's step-mother
never loved him.

109
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,327
And that's why His Highness...

110
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,062
...sent the prince away
for studies when he was a kid.

111
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,535
So that he isn't affected
by the ambiance at home.

112
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,138
But the young queen knew...

113
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:38,679
...as long as the Prince is a
ive...her
own blood can never ascend the throne.

114
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,444
And so...she plotted this
ruse when the king grew old.

115
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:47,523
Hovv dare they...harm our Prince!

116
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,025
Come Surya Pratap!
Let's go talk to them!

117
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,154
Wait!

118
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:59,594
One needs vvater to douse the fire.

119
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,038
But this fire is invisible
to the naked eye.

120
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,538
What do you think?

121
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,037
You'll go accuse them...

122
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,008
...and they'll quietly
admit their crimes?

123
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,579
I can kill my enemy whenever I want.

124
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,652
But right now...my motive
is to save our Prince.

125
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,054
So...are we just going
to sit idle, father?

126
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,763
I never said that.

127
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,293
In order to give them a fitting reply...

128
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,733
...we must do it in their language.

129
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,270
Prepare to go meet Baba.

130
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,343
I am sure he has an antidote
for this Black Magic.

131
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,408
Hail Ivlaha Kali!

132
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:48,246
Did you get...a

 the ingredients
I asked for, your highness?

133
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,316
Yes, Baba.

134
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,457
Photo.

135
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,198
Baba, why did you ask for this mirror?

136
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:08,132
Through the naked eye one can
only see his reflection in the mirror.

137
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,236
And if we look closely...

138
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,636
...the mirror is the reflection
of the entire world.

139
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,439
The only difference is...

140
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,046
...there's a world that
resides in this mirror too.

141
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,074
A worlcl...that's parallel to ours.

142
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,978
Normally people from this world...

143
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,649
...are forbidden to go in their vvorld,
and they're forbidden to enter our world.

144
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,493
But when some spirit breaks the law...

145
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,492
...and troubles the
people in this world.

146
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,532
Then, in order to bind her...

147
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,099
...
've to break certain rules as well.

148
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,034
But what will you do
with this picture, Baba?

149
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,040
This picture will
draw that spirit to us...

150
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,737
...who's been making Veer suffer.

151
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,014
And I'll bind her with my spell...

152
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,112
...and free Veer forever.

153
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,507
Your Highness...

154
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:09,113
That evil spirit...turned out
to be more powerful than I e><pected..

155
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,646
I cannot do this, your Highness.

156
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,284
If you refuse to help us...then
our hopes will be shattered.

157
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:19,327
Your Highness/there's
only one person on this earth...

158
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,461
...who can save the Prince now?

159
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:27,368
And your family knows him really vvell,
your Highness.

160
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,391
Uncle.

161
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,014
Tell me the truth, uncle.

162
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,354
What's everyone hiding from me?

163
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,681
Why doesn't anyone want
to go see the Ivlevvadwale Baba?

164
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,698
Unc
e...you've always
treated me like a daughter.

165
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:33,060
For my sake...don't
hide anything from me.

166
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,341
Fine, Princess...

167
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,076
Ivlevvadwala Baba is none other than Jai.

168
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,446
Jai Singh Gujjar.

169
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,254
Jai?

170
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:26,455
My daughter's getting
married in two months.

171
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,152
We've tried all sorts
of medicines...and prayers.

172
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,330
But to no use.

173
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:38,034
Now...on
y you can perform some miracle.

174
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,762
You're an elder...

175
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,164
...don't embarrass me.

176
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,034
Everything will be fine.

177
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,625
Who did you bring to protect
your daughter this time?

178
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,123
Him!

179
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:17,474
He can't save your dear daughter,
Pratap Singh.

180
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,105
He's been behind bars
for five years himself.

181
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,680
And do you know what his crime was?

182
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:30,451
Pratap Singh...please go out.

183
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,745
Yes, but...

184
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,424
Look...you won't be able
to see what happens here ne><t.

185
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,703
Now tell me who you are?

186
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,469
And why are you after this poor girl?

187
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,538
Then listen carefully.

188
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,011
One evening...
 was sitting
on the banyan tree..

189
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:10,250
And she...was returning from the fair.

190
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,594
As soon as she lost her way...

191
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,598
...and took the dirt road...

192
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,235
...
 lost my heart to her.

193
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,669
That's it...
 possessed her.

194
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,580
Now go back to where you came from.

195
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,018
Or else I'll make you suffer.

196
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,420
A prisoner...is going to save this girl...

197
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,517
...vvith the art he learned in jail.

198
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,428
From me?

199
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:51,762
What are you doing?

200
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:56,234
As long as it's in my hand...it's
the holy water of Ganga.

201
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,275
But for you...

202
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,509
...it's like acid.

203
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,508
Stop blabbering and go away!

204
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,692
Leave this girl's body.
- I won't!

205
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,222
Did you hear? I won't.

206
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,199
She's mine...on
y mine.

207
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,723
If she can't be mine...then
I won't let anyone have her.

208
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,565
We can never repay this favor.

209
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,737
But this is a small
token for your efforts.

210
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,269
I didn't learn this art
from my guru to earn money.

211
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:08,275
Your daughter needs these
jewelries more than I do.

212
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,689
I only want is an
invitation to her wedding.

213
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,250
The royal chariot...

214
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,075
...parked outside this paupeﬁs home.

215
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,348
There must be a reason behind it.

216
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,389
Princess Shivangi
has returned from abroad.

217
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:57,659
She wants to meet you.

218
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,534
I don't care what she wants.

219
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,229
But...right now...

220
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,742
...
 want you to take
her message and leave.

221
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,071
I don't want to meet your Princess.

222
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,543
But son...
- Enough, uncle.

223
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,345
You're elder to me...

224
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,048
...so I am requesting you.

225
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,248
If you ever come back again...

226
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,424
...or mention the princess
to me...then I might disrespect you.

227
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,260
What a dilemma!

228
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,059
You don't want to go with me...

229
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,331
...and I can't leave without you.

230
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,168
I'll wait for you outside.

231
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,254
Lies...
ies...a

 lies.

232
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,593
You've been lying
to me for four years.

233
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,163
The truth is that...

234
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,064
...you don't have the courage
to talk to my father.

235
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,439
It's not about courage, Shivangi.

236
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:13,335
It's about the opinion
these royal people have...

237
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,435
...about ordinary people like us.

238
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,306
I am not scared of your father.

239
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,212
I am scared of myself.

240
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,614
Because you know I won't
be able to endure his refusal.

241
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,558
And what if father gets
me married to someone else?

242
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,424
Will you be able to endure that?

243
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,287
Stay here...
'm going to tell father...

244
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,266
...that I am ready to
marry any guy of his choice.

245
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,761
Shivangi.

246
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,362
Shivangi...

247
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,572
"Why upset..."

248
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:50,207
"Don't be angry with me."

249
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:54,676
"
 can't even breathe...without you."

250
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,520
"
 wonder why..."

251
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,722
"Let it stay...in your 
ove..."

252
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,987
"Let me stay.

253
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:13,265
"Let me float in your dreams."

254
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:18,365
"Let it happen."

255
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:24,113
"
'm the dewdrops of your dawn."

256
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,781
"
 am your destiny."

257
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,666
"It's always there..."

258
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:26,336
"...the impression
of your lips on mine."

259
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,773
"
 can feel it..."

260
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:34,779
"...your presence in the lonely nights."

261
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,678
"
 can feel..."

262
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,187
"...fe
t 
ike...you just touched me."

263
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:49,055
"
'm the dewdrops of your dawn."

264
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,627
"
 am your destiny."

265
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:58,531
"
'm the dewdrops of your dawn."

266
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:04,636
"
 am your destiny."

267
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,647
What are you looking for?

268
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,989
Your life line's smaller than mine.

269
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,258
These fate lines cannot
predict anyone's destiny...

270
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,455
It's nonsense.

271
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,464
Don't laugh.

272
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,760
If anything happens to you...

273
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,365
...then what about me?

274
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,999
If I ever have to leave you...

275
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,173
...then I won't go even if I am dead.

276
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:38,676
Are you crazy?

277
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:42,014
Now our lines are similar.

278
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,118
We'll live together...

279
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,687
...die together.

280
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,029
"It's necessary..."

281
00:35:54,352 --> 00:36:00,268
"Just like the air's
necessary...to breathe."

282
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,504
"Similarly.

283
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:09,202
"...you're a necessity for me."

284
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:15,374
"Our love will e><ist
for ages to come..."

285
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,580
"...and it's been there forever."

286
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:23,490
"
'm the dewdrops of your dawn."

287
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,724
"
 am your destiny."

288
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:32,531
"
'm the dewdrops of your dawn."

289
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:38,565
"
 am your destiny."

290
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,385
You?

291
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,713
Vvhy?

292
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,389
Were you expecting someone
else in these caves?

293
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:35,531
What's so special about
that...ordinary shepherd...

294
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,032
...that we blue-blooded men don't have?

295
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,562
Rana saa...if you weren't
the husband of my aunt...

296
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,538
Then...

297
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:51,503
Hovv else would I have
set my eyes on a girl like you?

298
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,274
You're the only one...

299
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,186
...in that huge palace.

300
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,154
And if some no-good
shepherd swoops you away...

301
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:08,360
...then what's the point of being
born in such a high-class family?

302
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,990
Rana saa...leave me, or else...

303
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,329
Or else what?

304
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,333
What?

305
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,262
You'll tell everyone that...

306
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,135
...you were fooling around
with that lowlife shepherd.

307
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:23,444
Your betterment lies
in compromising with me.

308
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,646
You take care of me...

309
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,713
...ancl l'll take care of
your little secret forever.

310
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,998
Jail

311
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,234
Jai, stop.

312
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,612
Jai, let Rana saa go.

313
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,009
For my sake, Jai...
et Rana saa go!

314
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,631
This is royal blood...

315
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,191
You'll have to pay dearly for this.

316
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,300
Your honor, the truth is...

317
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,469
...that Jai Singh and the Princess
know each other really well.

318
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,035
And they are friends.

319
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,445
Whatever Jai Singh
did...vvas to save himself.

320
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,178
That's a lie, your honor.

321
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:44,578
Hovv can the accused Jai
Singh and the Princess be friends?

322
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,280
A Princess...and a shepherd!

323
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,286
Where can they possibly meet?

324
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:53,156
I think we shouldn't
waste the court's time...

325
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,058
...vvith such absurd arguments.

326
00:40:57,322 --> 00:41:00,303
And so...
 would like to
call upon my ne><t witness.

327
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,167
Princess Shivangi!

328
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,485
Princess Shivangi...
have you met this man...

329
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,616
....Jai Singh Gujjar, before?

330
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,761
Please answer in 'yes' or
'no' for the court's convenience.

331
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,032
Yes.

332
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,563
ls he your friend?

333
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:42,773
Let's skip that.

334
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,636
Can you tell the court...

335
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,376
...what happened with you that day?

336
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,381
Rana Jagpratap Singh is my uncle.

337
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,422
He will never think ill for me.

338
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:59,284
I know Jai Singh...
he came to our court.

339
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,654
But he's not my friend.

340
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,688
Shivangi, what are you saying?

341
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,057
Tell them what happened with you.

342
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,298
You've no right to speak in-between!

343
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:14,704
Please speak without
any fear or hesitation.

344
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,007
This man didn't just trouble me...

345
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:23,550
...in fact he also
said that he won't rest...

346
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,414
...unti
 he doesn't make me his.

347
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,022
That's a lie. She's lying.

348
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,591
Shivangi, what's wrong with you?
- Silence!

349
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,027
Don't interfere with
the court's proceedings!

350
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:37,229
When Rana Jagpratap
Singh learned about this...

351
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:41,734
...he went to see him in order
to save the honor of our family.

352
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:46,269
But he didn't just ignore
his age...but his stature too.

353
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,377
And attacked him.

354
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,674
It's a lie. She's lying.

355
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,271
What are you saying, Shivangi?

356
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:56,246
Shivangi, why don't you
tell them that you love me?

357
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,449
Shivangi. . . look at me.

358
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:05,426
Shivangi...look into my eyes
and say that you don't know me.

359
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,648
The court finds Jai
Singh Gujjar guilty...

360
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:31,315
...and sentences him
to 5 years of imprisonment.

361
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,216
Shivangi!

362
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,289
Why did you do it?

363
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,364
Vvhy?

364
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:48,097
It took me very long to understand...

365
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,663
...that the royal family honor
is more important than any relation.

366
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:55,067
Those who live in palaces...should
always support royalty.

367
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,637
And not some ordinary shepherd.

368
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,272
Unc
e...
 said I won't come!

369
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,606
Go away!

370
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,058
Uncle, I...

371
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,101
I knovv...you don't want to see me.

372
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,214
But only you can help me, Jai.

373
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:16,319
And if he isn't freed from
that spirit's clutches soon...

374
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,559
...then he'll be dead, Jai.

375
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,359
Well... the so-called aristocrats...

376
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:29,330
...fina

y need the help
of an ordinary shepherd.

377
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,497
I know I am your culprit.

378
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:36,503
But why punish an innocent man for it.

379
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:42,512
I beg you...please save my husband.

380
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,078
Please save Veer.

381
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:48,757
Your love mighfve been a joke,
Shivangi...

382
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,455
...but my hatred is real.

383
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:56,622
You didn't care for my

ove...so why should I do for you?

384
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:05,030
I've heard that you learnt
this art in order to help others.

385
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,010
Veer Saa is one of those people...

386
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:11,270
...who needs you and your art.

387
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,110
Hovv can you punish someone else...

388
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:17,284
...for whatever happened
between us, Jai.

389
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:18,713
Think about it...

390
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,355
If some other girl
had come begging to you...

391
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:26,520
...to save her husband's life,
what would you have done?

392
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,631
Would you have disappointed her too?

393
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,997
If that's the case, then fine...

394
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:42,170
For others I do it free of charge...

395
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:49,710
...but I will take a high-fee
for this job from you royal people.

396
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:53,481
Nothing is more valuable
than Veer See's life for me.

397
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:58,183
Just come to London
with me...and save his life.

398
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,251
Kesar Ivlaa...

399
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:48,043
How's he, Kesar Ivlaa?

400
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,605
ls he fine?

401
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,672
Don't go inside, madam.
Please don't go inside.

402
00:47:55,306 --> 00:48:00,312
What I saw in bits and
pieces this entire month...

403
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,024
...you won't be able to see it suddenly.

404
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,983
Don't go inside.

405
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,494
Don't go inside!

406
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:09,257
You won't be able see him.

407
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,024
You won't...

408
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:54,702
You didn't do anything wrong
by bringing me here, Shivangi.

409
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:59,302
This spirit has completely
possessed your husband's body.

410
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,509
She's a witch...
that's stealing Veer Singh's age...

411
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,705
...and his strength.

412
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,513
If we don't do something soon...

413
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,151
...then it'll be difficult to save him.

414
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:17,684
We have...on
y a week's time.

415
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,223
Then do something, Jai! Do something.

416
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:22,659
Perform some ritua
s...or
take any measure you want.

417
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,135
But...but please save him,
Jai...please save him.

418
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,330
Of course...
 will save him.

419
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:33,302
But for that...vve must take him home.

420
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,362
Strange...he's your husband,
it's your decision.

421
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:00,398
Whether you get him treated
here or someplace else...

422
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,401
...who's the doctor to decide?

423
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,264
That's what I told him.

424
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:07,466
But the doctor said
that he'll discharge him...

425
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,034
...but if anything happens
to him after that...

426
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,238
...then I will be
completely responsible.

427
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:14,543
And I must give him
in writing as well.

428
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,150
So, what's the problem?

429
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:19,347
Maybe not today but this
can be a problem in future.

430
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,547
God forbid,
if anything happens to him...

431
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:25,057
...then my in-laws will
hold me responsible.

432
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:33,191
There's one way.

433
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,564
That's the difference
between good and bad spirits.

434
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,097
Bad spirits can't stop thinking
about physical pleasures...

435
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:40,369
...even after they've left their body.

436
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,439
Especially...the taste.

437
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,112
And that's why sometimes we use...

438
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,681
...meat and alcohol in order
to attract these bad spirits.

439
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:56,456
Mrs. Veer,
we're educated people living...

440
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:59,188
...in the age of science
and medical revolution.

441
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,231
I am shocked that you
still believe in Black Magic.

442
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:05,397
What you're suggesting
is...quite frankly...

443
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:09,196
...not only nonsensical...
but also ridiculous.

444
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:12,307
Please, doctor.
You promised me five minutes.

445
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,309
Five minutes is all
I am asking you for.

446
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,603
Please, doctor.

447
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,038
If you insist!

448
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,483
What is in that piece of cloth?

449
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,019
You will find out, doctor.

450
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,151
Please, be patient.

451
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:39,658
Now ask him to come to
the Prince's room with us.

452
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,138
Shivangi...

453
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,522
Wipe your tears, Shivangi.

454
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,659
As long as I am here...

455
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,466
...nothing will happen to your Veer Sea.

456
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,065
Can I see those pictures?

457
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:53,348
If your in-laws have done this...

458
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:56,615
...then only mantras are
not enough to get the job done.

459
00:56:57,481 --> 00:57:01,019
They must have found
some medium...or method...

460
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,359
...to send this evil spirit here.

461
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:05,331
Think carefully...

462
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,460
Did they send something to eat?

463
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,168
Or did someone bring
some kind of offerings...

464
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,139
...coconut, flowers anything
that which they sent...

465
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,972
...and it's still in the house.

466
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:19,447
No, I can't think
of anything like that.

467
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,478
How's this possible?

468
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:26,718
Without a medium...
from thousands of miles.

469
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,446
No...

470
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,321
...there's something
that you're missing.

471
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:37,722
Someone did send a
gift from India.

472
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,258
Gift?

473
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:41,130
What gift? Who? When did he send it?

474
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:44,104
Few days ago we received
a locket through mail.

475
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,074
Locket?

476
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,149
What now, Jai?

477
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,283
First...we must neutralize
what has already happened.

478
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,457
There must be a river or stream here?

479
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:38,223
Yes...

480
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,223
3 miles avvay...the Thames River.

481
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:44,990
We must wait for nightfall.

482
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:56,236
3 o'clock at night...

483
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,047
...is when both the quarters meet.

484
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:05,049
We must immerse the

ocket...at exactly 3 o'clock.

485
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,013
Have you by-hearted the mantras?

486
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,988
Yes.

487
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,560
Any kind of carelessness...
can cost three lives.

488
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:15,455
Your husband...

489
00:59:16,153 --> 00:59:17,257
You...

490
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:18,598
And me.

491
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:23,003
You must fight this
battle for 15 minutes.

492
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,304
l'll leave when the
clocl<'s hand is on 9...

493
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:29,310
...and immerse this locket
in the river at 3 o'clock.

494
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:32,139
But you must keep
chanting the mantras...

495
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,579
...and keep that spirit here.

496
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:35,014
If that doesn't happen...

497
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,382
...then the spirit will
get to me and try to stop me.

498
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,547
And maybe even succeed.

499
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,382
I won't let that happen, Jai.

500
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:46,255
At any cost...
I won't let it out of here.

501
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,693
I know you'll try hard, Shivangi.

502
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,994
But I also know that
Spirit's going to try harder...

503
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:56,368
...to get out of here.

504
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:59,770
She'll try to scare you,
intimidate you...foo
 you...

505
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:04,501
...but at any cost...you cannot stop
chanting the mantras before 3 o'clock.

506
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,137
Not even for a moment.

507
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,809
She's ready...

508
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,304
...and so are we.

509
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:14,742
Madam...

510
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,412
Don't stop chanting.

511
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,119
Don't stop chanting.

512
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,305
Madam...don't vvorry.

513
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:42,542
I'll go get a lantern.

514
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,373
George, river?

515
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:25,442
River?

516
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:32,243
Shivangi.

517
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,447
Why are you hiding there?

518
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:36,145
What happened?

519
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,318
What's wrong, Shivangi?

520
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,550
Tell me.

521
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:44,751
What's going on here?

522
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:52,625
What's wrong, Shivangi?

523
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:58,028
What happened? Why are you crying?

524
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,334
ls everything alright?

525
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,577
God answered my prayers.

526
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:07,641
He made you normal again.

527
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:16,611
Send it to England.

528
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:18,675
Will she come?

529
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,053
I am the disease...

530
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:22,713
...and the cure.

531
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:26,187
Shivangi will have to come.

532
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,464
I beg you...

533
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:34,994
...save my husband.

534
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:38,134
Please save Veer, Jai.

535
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:17,141
Princess Shivangi...

536
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:22,712
Just like a snake's bite
can be cured only with its venom...

537
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:31,084
...similarly...your Veer Singh's
cure and disease is in this locket.

538
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:35,694
Now no one can save your Veer saa.

539
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,289
No one!

540
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,226
I intentionally made a mistake.

541
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:14,225
Even after you had explained me...

542
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,134
...
 fell for her trap and
stopped chanting the mantras.

543
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:18,372
If I hadn't done that...

544
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,841
...she cou
d've never
gotten out of there...

545
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:22,842
...and harmed you.

546
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:25,470
I don't care about my wounds,
Shivangi.

547
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,212
I was thinking about your husband.

548
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:32,346
I don't regret that we didn't succeed.

549
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:33,746
But what I do regret is that...

550
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,484
...we lost when we were
so close to winning.

551
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:38,256
One...

552
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:41,925
We made one small mistake
and lost everything.

553
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,325
If this hadn't happened...

554
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:47,793
...then your husband would've
escaped from her clutches permanently.

555
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:51,196
I trust you, Jai...

556
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,739
You will definitely
find some solution...

557
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,207
...and still manage to save Veer Saa.

558
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:01,175
Now there's just. ..one solution,
Shivangi.

559
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:04,778
No point in cutting
the branches anymore.

560
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,852
We must uproot this evil permanently.

561
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,847
And for that...vve must find out...

562
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:12,559
...where this evil spirit came from.

563
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,270
There are good spirits
and bad ones too.

564
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,732
If we want to find
out that witch's name...

565
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:30,505
...or where she's from.

566
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:33,680
Then only a good
spirit can tell us her.

567
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:35,840
This lemon will stop rolling...

568
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:40,245
...vvhen it finds a good
spirit that can help us.

569
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,521
I'll throw this lemon out of the door...

570
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:45,751
...and you must find it.

571
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:48,696
This job sounds easy,
but believe me it's not.

572
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,627
Because that witch will attack
you at every opportunity she gets...

573
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,225
...and try to hide her truth.

574
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,359
And if you return empty-handed...

575
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:59,339
...then you should know that
we'll never be able to identify her.

576
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,208
Are you ready?

577
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:16,616
Shivangi...

578
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,218
Take care!

579
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:23,323
And whenever you're scared...

580
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:28,301
...just remember that your
friend is always with you.

581
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,869
Madam!
- Stop, Kesar ma.

582
01:12:18,268 --> 01:12:20,509
Neither you...nor I
can fight this battle.

583
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:24,245
Only a virtuous wife
can fight this battle.

584
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:46,619
Sallangarh.

585
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,454
I always knew the answer...

586
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,758
...and now it's been proven too.

587
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:54,888
What do you mean?

588
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,328
It means...

589
01:15:56,753 --> 01:16:01,532
...this origin of this spirit
is connected with Shivangis in-lavvs.

590
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:04,594
What should I do now, Kesar ma?

591
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:07,137
Should I still keep quiet?

592
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:10,105
Should I still think
about my honor and respect?

593
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:14,342
Should I just sit id
e...and
wait for Veer saa to die.

594
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,640
What else will you do?

595
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:18,549
Ask them the price
of my husband's life.

596
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:21,419
And if the price is my life...

597
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:23,820
...then I'll give up my life
in order to save my husband.

598
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:28,696
I never thought that
his family can stoop so low...

599
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,197
...in order to gain power.

600
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:34,325
I will never spare them, Jai.

601
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,162
Don't be so naTve, Shivangi.

602
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:41,135
You think you'll accuse
them for your husband's condition...

603
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:42,403
...and they'll admit it.

604
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:43,637
They must admit it.

605
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,406
Don't be crazy, Shivangi.

606
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:48,109
Your in-laws are very
cunning and they'll clearly

607
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,583
...deny any knowledge about
a gift or the chief's letter.

608
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,211
Shivangi, this is not the
time to get into a spat with them...

609
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:55,381
...in fact, we should
be saving your husband.

610
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,648
This lemon has revealed that...

611
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:01,320
...the Spirit's origin
is connected with Sajjangarh.

612
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:04,627
But this doesn't mean
you can uproot them.

613
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:09,669
Then what should I do, Jai?

614
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,197
Should I just sit here
and do nothing.

615
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:14,240
No.

616
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:17,801
Just stay here and
look after your husband...

617
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,078
And I...

618
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:22,716
I will go there and try to
uproot this evil from its origin.

619
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:26,782
I won't let that witch
succeed in her motives, Shivangi.

620
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,383
I promise you.

621
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:42,625
I can never forget
what you're doing for me.

622
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:45,570
What's this?

623
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,570
Keeping my end of the promise.

624
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,472
But my job's not done yet.

625
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,278
I'll take these once my work's done.

626
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:55,579
Jai...

627
01:17:57,607 --> 01:17:59,109
Thank you so much.

628
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,349
I am not doing it for you...

629
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:05,115
I am doing it for myself.

630
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:11,195
I mean...
 feel really
obliged doing this for you.

631
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:13,767
See you.

632
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,193
Waterloo Station, please.

633
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:36,799
Please hurry up, George.

634
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,224
Jail

635
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,232
I never told you who sent that locket.

636
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:38,732
Then hovv did you know that the
chief of Sajjangarh sent that locket.

637
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:42,842
‘Your in-laws are very
cunning and they'll clearly

638
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:46,341
'...deny any knowledge about
a gift or the chief's letter.‘

639
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:07,689
I kept thinking that
my in-laws are doing this.

640
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:14,300
But I didn't know that
the man whom I trusted the most...

641
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,505
...turned out to be my biggest enemy.

642
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:21,207
You sent that spirit to me...

643
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:25,783
...and I kept begging
you to get rid of it.

644
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:32,152
I held your hand for protection.

645
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:37,186
But you let me drown.

646
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:38,523
Yes!

647
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,563
Because you held my hand
for your own intentions...

648
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:44,602
...and also let go for the same reason.

649
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:47,734
You turned out to be my biggest enemy.

650
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,603
By accusing me in the court.

651
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,880
By humiliating my love
in front of everyone.

652
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:57,249
By showing me my stature.

653
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,186
I was jailed only for few years,
Shivangi...

654
01:23:00,743 --> 01:23:02,654
...but I am still being punished for it.

655
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:05,455
That judge heard your testimony...

656
01:23:05,548 --> 01:23:09,325
...gave his verdict...and
snatched all my happiness.

657
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:11,825
And me...

658
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,563
I listened to my heart.

659
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,604
And decided to snatch strip
you of all your happiness.

660
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,738
I had already passed judgment
on your husband's death order.

661
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,771
I only came here to
put a seal on my judgment.

662
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,651
And I did it by throwing
that locket in the river.

663
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:39,656
Every tear you shed
makes me so happy, Shivangi.

664
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:41,456
It's really hard to say.

665
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:45,591
I wanted to see the
same agony in your eyes...

666
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:48,734
...which my eyes felt did once.

667
01:23:50,559 --> 01:23:52,732
The agony of losing someone.

668
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:57,300
What did you think...on
y
you felt that agony?

669
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:00,406
Were you the only one who loved me?

670
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,307
You were punished alone?

671
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:09,619
Do you want to know...
why I lied in the court that day?

672
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:15,317
Wait!

673
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,153
What are you doing, brother-in-law?

674
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,290
Such a small punishment
for such a big crime?

675
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:21,096
He tried to tarnish our family honor...

676
01:24:21,123 --> 01:24:23,125
...and for that he must suffer to death.

677
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:25,195
We must cut that lowlife
into small pieces...

678
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,171
...and throw them to the scavengers.

679
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:31,208
I would've done something
similar with you!

680
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:33,512
But what to do?

681
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:36,746
The one who tried to
tarnish my family honor...

682
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:41,311
...is none other but
my sister's husband.

683
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:44,349
If we shed your blood...

684
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:49,489
...my sister will become a widow.

685
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:56,134
Rudra! Go! Finish him.

686
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,434
No, brother. Don't do it.

687
01:24:58,494 --> 01:24:59,564
Don't do it.

688
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:02,632
If he's committed a crime,
then so did l?

689
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:04,143
Punish me...

690
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,873
Punish me,
but don't harm him, brother.

691
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:07,239
Please...

692
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:09,282
Move aside!

693
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:12,075
Father, stop him.

694
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,450
Father, stop him.

695
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:15,779
Don't kill my Jai.

696
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,125
I'll tell him to go far away.

697
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:28,624
Father...

698
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,502
Father, I never asked
you for anything.

699
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,507
But consider this my
first and last request.

700
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:36,804
And after that I'll do as you say.

701
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,736
Please let him go.

702
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,337
Spare Jai's life, father.

703
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:42,245
Spare my Jai.

704
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,783
Please listen to me.

705
01:25:44,173 --> 01:25:47,643
Please father, listen to me.

706
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:55,557
Fine, if you want
me to spare his life...

707
01:25:56,118 --> 01:25:59,531
...and keep the honor
of our family intact.

708
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:05,571
Then you'll do...as I say.

709
01:26:09,632 --> 01:26:12,306
You...

710
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:15,741
Why didn't you tell me?

711
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,811
You always thought from your heart.

712
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:23,479
And my family... resolved
every problem with a gun.

713
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,321
Someone had to think calmly.

714
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:36,532
My lie would keep you
behind bars for few years.

715
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:39,836
But my truth...

716
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:46,275
But my truth...vvould've killed you.

717
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:53,781
And that's vvhy...
I did what I thought was right.

718
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:57,620
What have I done?

719
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,893
You gave such a big
sacrifice to save my life.

720
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:05,189
And I...

721
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:09,133
I tried to kill your husband...

722
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:13,129
No, Shivangi!

723
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,809
Even if I've to fight
some witch or God himself...

724
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:21,206
...
 promise your husband
will be unharmed.

725
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:22,772
Nothing at all.

726
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,509
Jail

727
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:08,594
While doing the wrong
thing...
 didn't realize.

728
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:12,204
When the time comes
to make things right...

729
01:32:12,794 --> 01:32:14,569
...everything will go wrong.

730
01:32:16,465 --> 01:32:18,445
It'll be out of my hand.

731
01:32:20,102 --> 01:32:23,743
The spirit I sent
to posses your husband...

732
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,311
...is no longer under my control.

733
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:32,889
For the first time I feel so helpless.

734
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:34,784
What now, Jai?

735
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:38,423
We don't have much time on our hands.

736
01:32:57,138 --> 01:32:59,175
You were right, Shivangi.

737
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:03,184
We really don't have much time.

738
01:33:04,513 --> 01:33:05,890
What will we do now, Jai?

739
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:11,558
Hovv will we free Veer saa
from the clutches of that spirit...

740
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,122
...in such short time?

741
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:19,568
Sometimes...in order to go forward...

742
01:33:20,495 --> 01:33:23,840
...one has to take a step
back and mend one's mistake.

743
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:31,148
I must turn back time...
and go see my Guru.

744
01:33:31,506 --> 01:33:33,452
He'll definitely give me a solution.

745
01:33:56,832 --> 01:33:58,869
‘Remember this place.‘

746
01:34:00,268 --> 01:34:03,715
‘This is where I trusted you.‘

747
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:09,584
‘And handed over my knowledge
to you before I died.‘

748
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:12,223
‘For doing good deeds.‘

749
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:15,727
‘To help those in need.‘

750
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:19,120
‘Because I knew...‘

751
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:27,300
'...you were serving time for
the crime you never committed.‘

752
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:32,438
‘I was so lost in your innocent eyes...‘

753
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:36,145
'...that I forgot to
peek in your heart.‘

754
01:34:36,571 --> 01:34:41,179
‘The seeds of hatred
were already sown in there.‘

755
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:43,452
‘Forgive me, Guru.‘

756
01:34:45,213 --> 01:34:48,456
‘That hatred raging in
my heart...‘

757
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:51,160
'. . was never right.‘

758
01:34:52,587 --> 01:34:54,464
‘I was wrong, Guru.‘

759
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:57,295
‘I was wrong.‘

760
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,764
‘Help me, Guru.‘

761
01:35:02,497 --> 01:35:04,306
‘I must rectify my mistakes.‘

762
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:09,273
‘What you're trying to do,
Jai, isn't as easy as it looks.‘

763
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:14,718
‘Because what you
did...is quite dreadful.‘

764
01:35:16,077 --> 01:35:18,250
‘You awakened that witch.‘

765
01:35:19,347 --> 01:35:21,759
‘Promised her a soul.‘

766
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:24,461
‘And now...‘

767
01:35:25,654 --> 01:35:28,430
'...she won't rest in
peace without the soul.‘

768
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:34,430
‘Right now...she's searching
for Veer's soul.‘

769
01:35:34,529 --> 01:35:39,239
‘You're the only one
who can help me right novv.‘

770
01:35:40,402 --> 01:35:42,109
‘I must save Veer.‘

771
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:46,147
‘I must protect ShivangFs happiness.‘

772
01:35:46,775 --> 01:35:48,618
‘There's one way.‘

773
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,440
Shivangi.

774
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,412
Guru has shown me the way.

775
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,151
Yes, madam.

776
01:36:21,243 --> 01:36:24,850
Ask him is there's place
where God's foundation was laid...

777
01:36:25,413 --> 01:36:27,188
...but no one goes there anymore.

778
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,357
What kind of a question is that?

779
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:33,464
Hovv can he have the
answer to such a question?

780
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,829
Didn't he tell you a name?

781
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:39,470
‘On a moonless night...
amidst the mountains.‘

782
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:44,132
‘God's broken home...
that's where you'll find your path.‘

783
01:36:44,866 --> 01:36:48,712
What is all this?
- What my guru told me.

784
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:53,350
George, is there a place here...

785
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:55,547
...where people go on
a no-moon light night.

786
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:57,180
Like a hill or a mountain?

787
01:36:57,245 --> 01:36:58,553
Not that I know of.

788
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:02,486
Wait a minute,
there a place called no-moon hill.

789
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:05,863
But there is nothing there
e><cept for a broken-down church.

790
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:07,257
I got it.

791
01:37:08,523 --> 01:37:10,469
That's where we must go.

792
01:37:15,363 --> 01:37:17,365
But what will we do once we get there.

793
01:37:17,432 --> 01:37:19,378
We'll know that once we get there.

794
01:37:20,235 --> 01:37:21,339
I don't get it.

795
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:24,250
All I could understand was that...

796
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:27,181
...someone will help
us once we're there.

797
01:37:59,174 --> 01:38:02,451
"Let me cry my heart out today..."

798
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:05,787
"You betrayed my breath,
left me alone...

799
01:38:05,847 --> 01:38:11,354
"...and me destroyed completely,
beloved."

800
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:16,129
"Make my wounds fresh again."

801
01:38:16,157 --> 01:38:19,161
"Cure my sorrows."

802
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:24,404
"Make those loyal again, beloved."

803
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:29,248
"Am I addicted to you..."

804
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:32,376
"...or is it your intoxication?"

805
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:38,814
"Hovv do I tell you, my benefactor?"

806
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:42,354
"Let me cry my heart out today..."

807
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:45,728
"You betrayed my breath,
left me alone...

808
01:38:45,787 --> 01:38:52,295
"...and destroyed me completely,
beloved."

809
01:39:19,754 --> 01:39:24,430
"
 need you to stay alive..."

810
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:31,870
"...how can one narrate it?"

811
01:39:32,867 --> 01:39:37,873
"There's grace in my eyes..."

812
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:45,355
"...that can lighten
up an entire world."

813
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:51,890
"The heart's down with 
ove."

814
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:57,367
"All it wants is some peace."

815
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:02,469
"Your sorrows are my destiny."

816
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:05,909
"Why can't you be mine?"

817
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:11,207
"You're the sea and I'm the shore,
beloved."

818
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:15,619
"Let me cry my heart out today..."

819
01:40:15,677 --> 01:40:19,215
"You betrayed my breath,
left me alone...

820
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:24,753
"...and destroyed me completely,
beloved."

821
01:40:25,753 --> 01:40:29,257
"Make my wounds fresh again."

822
01:40:29,324 --> 01:40:32,464
"Cure my sorrows."

823
01:40:32,526 --> 01:40:38,272
"Make those loyal again, beloved."

824
01:41:38,126 --> 01:41:40,231
You've come.

825
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:43,798
I was waiting for you.

826
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:47,771
Don't be surprised.

827
01:41:48,636 --> 01:41:51,173
It was me you were meant to meet.

828
01:41:51,372 --> 01:41:54,615
She already knew we were coming.

829
01:41:56,144 --> 01:41:58,454
Maybe she's the one
who's going help us?

830
01:41:59,147 --> 01:42:03,425
Ask her...
hovv is she going to help us?

831
01:42:06,688 --> 01:42:09,134
lam going to help you...

832
01:42:09,257 --> 01:42:12,670
...by giving you these knives.

833
01:42:13,561 --> 01:42:15,438
Does she understand our language?

834
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:19,638
I don't understand
the language of the body...

835
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:24,239
...but, I understand
the language of the soul.

836
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:29,420
She understands the language
of the soul, not body.

837
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:46,432
Ask her...

838
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,235
...what do we have
to do with these knives?

839
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:56,841
Veer saa!

840
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,178
Veer saa!

841
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,150
Veer saa, what's happening to you?

842
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:01,148
Veer saa!

843
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,619
In the last 24 hours...

844
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:07,658
...
've felt his heart
stop beating twice.

845
01:43:08,549 --> 01:43:10,290
We don't have much time, Kesar maa.

846
01:43:11,085 --> 01:43:14,123
But this knife will tell us hovv much?

847
01:43:14,322 --> 01:43:15,300
But how?

848
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:17,768
What are you going to do?
Hovv are you going to do it?

849
01:43:17,825 --> 01:43:19,702
I don't understand, Jai.

850
01:43:19,827 --> 01:43:22,273
Did you get everything I asked for?

851
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:55,732
That was the first knife.

852
01:43:56,664 --> 01:43:59,372
Now...we've only until
the sands completely over.

853
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:14,318
The second knife has done its job.

854
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,320
It's opened a door for
me into the other world.

855
01:44:17,785 --> 01:44:19,594
Until this knife stays embedded here...

856
01:44:19,654 --> 01:44:22,863
...this will be the door
between this world and that.

857
01:44:23,525 --> 01:44:26,836
Without this door...neither
can I come out, nor can she.

858
01:44:27,362 --> 01:44:30,206
Now I must go in that
world with the third knife...

859
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:33,177
...and stab her with it

860
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:35,307
But why in that world?

861
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:37,371
Because in this world
she's just a soul.

862
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:39,243
But in that world, she has a body.

863
01:44:39,507 --> 01:44:42,351
And one can only stab the body,
not the soul.

864
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:44,286
So I must go there at any cost.

865
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:48,151
This means...if you
succeed in that world...

866
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:49,887
...things will be back to normal?

867
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:51,152
No.

868
01:44:51,219 --> 01:44:53,825
I must finish her in this world.

869
01:44:53,888 --> 01:44:55,595
But those stab wounds will force her...

870
01:44:55,656 --> 01:44:59,229
...to give me the locket
which I threw in the river.

871
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:00,533
As soon as I get that locket here...

872
01:45:00,595 --> 01:45:02,472
...vve'

 have to throw it in the fire.

873
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:05,676
As soon as the locket burns...
the spirit will be destroyed too.

874
01:45:05,733 --> 01:45:07,269
And as soon as that happens...

875
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:09,239
...the prince will be fine again.

876
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:13,751
But what if that spirit
comes out after you go in...

877
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:15,778
...and attacks us?

878
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:17,612
For that you must do one thing.

879
01:45:18,112 --> 01:45:19,216
Until I don't return...

880
01:45:19,414 --> 01:45:22,588
...you must hold this coconut
tightly with both your hands...

881
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,822
...in front of this mirror.

882
01:45:24,085 --> 01:45:24,756
And remember...

883
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,257
No matter hovv hard she tries...

884
01:45:26,487 --> 01:45:28,364
Until you don't let
this coconut budge...

885
01:45:28,423 --> 01:45:29,731
...she can't come out.

886
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:32,270
So...you must not fall
week in any condition.

887
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:38,367
Keep the fire burning, Kesar ma.

888
01:45:38,866 --> 01:45:41,312
I will return with
the locket at any cost.

889
01:48:08,449 --> 01:48:09,792
Veer saa!

890
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:11,152

891
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:13,297
Prince.

Veer saa.

903
01:54:49,349 --> 01:54:52,296
Shivangi, what happened to you?

904
01:55:14,474 --> 01:55:16,715
‘There's only one way.‘

905
01:55:17,444 --> 01:55:19,720
‘That witch wants a soul...‘

906
01:55:20,381 --> 01:55:23,453
'...and she won't leave
until she gets one.‘

907
01:55:24,585 --> 01:55:29,694
‘Are you prepared to
give your 
ife...your soul?‘

908
01:55:30,157 --> 01:55:33,866
‘If this is the only way
to save Shivangi's happiness...‘

909
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:41,171
'...then yes...
 am ready
to give my soul to that witch.‘

910
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:53,709
"Someone's unknown."

01:56:54,708 --> 01:56:59,123
"Someone's defamed."

"

916
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:24,671
"...then why is he touching it."

917
01:57:24,738 --> 01:57:33,715
"

918
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:43,394
