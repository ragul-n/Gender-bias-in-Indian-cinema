1
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,917
His name's Vikram Sethi. 6ft tall...
He's in a black car.

2
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,042
You guys overtake
him from front.

3
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,500
Barricade all the roads.

4
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:46,750
Mister, are you alright?

5
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,833
Someone help him.

6
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,542
What happened?

7
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,292
What happened?

8
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,708
Someone call the ambulance.

9
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,375
Are you alright, mister?

10
00:02:57,542 --> 00:03:00,292
-Are you okay?
-Careful...Careful...

11
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,167
Someone get water.

12
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,167
-Sir, Vikram Sethi.
-Where?

13
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,667
-There...
-Let's go...

14
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,542
Stop...stop you...

15
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,250
Stop...I said stop... Stop!

16
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,167
Stop!

17
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,417
Sorry.

18
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,500
Stop!

19
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,875
Stop...I said stop... Stop!

20
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,625
What are you doing?

21
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,500
Stop!

22
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,917
Stop!

23
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,750
Stop...how much more are
you going to make me run?

24
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,125
Stop!

25
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,375
You'll regret this when
I get my hands on you.

26
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,958
Stop.

27
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,458
Stop!

28
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,042
Wait...

29
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,667
Did you find him? No,
we didn't find him.

30
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,500
Gawde, you go there.
And, I'll look here.

31
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,500
Call me if there's any
message on the wireless.

32
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,333
Okay, sir.

33
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,125
What the...

34
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,750
Control room beat number 4.

35
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,708
Hello, sir.

36
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,042
What is the situation
at Worli Checkpost.

37
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,625
Everything alright, sir.

38
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,875
Shinde, report to Haji Ali Road.

39
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,500
There's a traffic jam.

40
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,083
Tambe, come in.

41
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,125
Tambe, come in.

42
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:34,042
Vikram Sethi was last seen
near Palm's Court Society.

43
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,833
Over! Tambe!

44
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,042
Tambe!

45
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,250
Tambe!

46
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,458
Tambe!

47
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,667
Tambe!

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,542
Open the door!

49
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,083
What's wrong with you?

50
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,667
-Were you sleeping?
-No, sir.

51
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,083
Mumbai's monsoon is
so unpredictable...

52
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,417
It starts pouring
without a warning.

53
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,583
Let's go... Cuffe Parade.

54
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,542
Vikram Sethi and the rain,
Both are getting on my nerves.

55
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,875
while you're sleeping

56
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,833
Sir, I don't see anyone.

57
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,083
Look... Hey...

58
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,167
-Sir.
-Come here.

59
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,875
-Sir.
-Where were you?

60
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,917
The bathroom, sir.

61
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,833
And have gone six
times since morning.

62
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,625
I had milk over fish and rice.

63
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,375
-And since then...
-Enough! We don't want details.

64
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,667
We're not making a sketch.

65
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,292
Did someone in a gray
coat come in Here?

66
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,500
-Around 6ft tall.
-Impossible, sir.

67
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,917
Why? You can see everything
from the bathroom

68
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,167
whose coming or going?

69
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,417
Toofan's is there, sir.

70
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,458
-He's Toofan?
-He's a very dangerous dog, sir.

71
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,920
Last time he bit two people right
in their Main Point (crotch).

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,167
How does a dog know where a
man's Main Point (crotch) is?

73
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,042
You can check yourself, sir.

74
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,292
-Tambe, go check.
-Sir.

75
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,958
-Hey, dog...
-Sir, it's Toofan.

76
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,458
Toofan...

77
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,167
-Stay sharp.
-Yes, sir.

78
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:28,250
What if that dog had bitten
my Main Point (crotch)?

79
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:30,792
It's not funny.

80
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,958
-Main point...
-And I am yet to become a father.

81
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,583
I need a son to carry
my lineage forward.

82
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,417
-Tambe...
-You have two.

83
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,958
-Tambe..
-The elder one's called...

84
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,833
Don't Move!

85
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,500
Tambe. Gawde.

86
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,083
<i>This is RJ Anmol with you.
at the moment</i>

87
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,792
<i>But the one who's been with you
since morning is the rains</i>

88
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,417
<i> This monsoon</i>

89
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,000
<i>My advise is stay at home.
on't step out in this weather.</i>

90
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:51,500
Yeah.

91
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,958
I'll be there.

92
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:02,042
I said I'll be there.

93
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,125
Babe.

94
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,083
Babe.

95
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,167
Babe.

96
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:22,625
Babe... Where's my white shirt?

97
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,515
Oh...there it is.

98
00:09:28,974 --> 00:09:30,974
Thank you, baby.

99
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:58,099
Light.

100
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:22,390
<i>Oh god! This is really shocking.</i>

101
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:24,765
<i>The entire city of Mumbai
is talking about this</i>

102
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:28,307
<i>Famous novelist Vikram sethi
was taken into police custody</i>

103
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:43,932
Come on.

104
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,724
There are no CCTV
cameras here only.

105
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,557
They are all over the city,
but do they even work?

106
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,974
Your right, sir.

107
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,140
-Sir! Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

108
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:07,724
I am Sub-Inspector
Gautam Kohli...

109
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:10,182
I am in-charge here.
Everything's under control.

110
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:16,849
You making tea at a crime-scene?

111
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,724
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,724
Actually, sir...

113
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,265
It's been a long night, sir.

114
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,349
They all were feeling sleepy.

115
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,474
So I only suggested
let's have a cup of tea

116
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,752
it will refresh us all.
That's why, sir.

117
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:30,890
It's a good thing the
crime scene is in a house

118
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:32,182
and not a dance-bar.

119
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,307
Otherwise you'll would
be throwing money.

120
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:36,890
No, sir... It's
nothing like that.

121
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,224
-Did you put ginger?
-I did...

122
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,640
But there isn't any Cardamom

123
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:03,557
Hey, mister, who killed you?

124
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:08,140
He isn't saying anything

125
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:10,307
why don't you tell me.

126
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,600
Sir, it's a very
high-profile case.

127
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,884
This is Vikram Sethi, he's a
celebrated novelist in England.

128
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:18,724
And, he's in India for the
launch of his new book.

129
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:20,640
He's facing
double-murder charges.

130
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,807
First, his wife Katherine Sethi.

131
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,515
And the second, this
lawyer Shekhar Sinha.

132
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:32,699
-Cause of death?
-Head injury, sir.

133
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:35,015
He hit his head on the table
which lead to his death.

134
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,390
Have a look, sir.

135
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:38,515
Blood is found on the table.

136
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,599
I've sent it to forensics.

137
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:41,199
So it's quite obvious, sir,
this is the cause of death.

138
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,099
Have you seen the
wound on his head?

139
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,432
It's not caused by the table.

140
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,724
He's been Hit by
something heavy.

141
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:10,307
You call yourself Policemen... You're
not even fit to be security guards.

142
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:17,515
-Send it to the lab.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,099
-Send it.
-Yeah...

144
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,474
-Shravan.
-Yes sir.

145
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,474
-Send this to the lab for investigation.
-Okay, sir.

146
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:33,474
Its empty, sir.

147
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:36,640
And the one outside?

148
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:40,390
Tambe, I told you to
check the one outside.

149
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:41,724
No, sir.

150
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:44,182
-Yes...sir.
-Then why didn't you?

151
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:45,599
-Sorry, sir.
-Go check it now.

152
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:51,724
What are these burnt things?

153
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:53,807
Sir.

154
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,182
Sir.

155
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:08,974
Okay.

156
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,640
Okay bye.

157
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:18,890
-Jai Hind, sir. Good morning.
-Sir.

158
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,265
Good morning. Good morning.

159
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:25,640
What's the progress on
Vikram Sethi's case?

160
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,307
We're still at
initial stages, sir.

161
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,390
You know the department's speed.

162
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:32,265
We take a week just
to get started.

163
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:35,057
We have to solve this
case in three days.

164
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,515
Sir in three days it's
impossible to find a missing dog

165
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,974
and this is double-murder.

166
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:41,390
Can't help it.

167
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:44,349
And you've got three days only
because it's a long weekend.

168
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:47,599
By then either we charge him
or we'll have to let him go.

169
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:48,849
We can't keep him in remand.

170
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:51,265
-Sir, are you serious? I mean...
-Listen he's a UK Citizen.

171
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,807
Plus, he's well connected.

172
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:55,140
And, there's a lot of
political pressure.

173
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:56,724
Then why don't we
let him go, sir?

174
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:58,099
Acquit him.

175
00:14:58,432 --> 00:14:59,852
Anyway It's become a trend...
Commit a crime in India

176
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,974
and flee to a different country.
One more won't matter.

177
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,224
Look, we've got to do it.

178
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,557
And you know you can do it.

179
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:12,599
You have three days.

180
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,099
Excuse me.

181
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,849
Jai Hind, sir.

182
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,974
How are we going to
do it in three days?

183
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:27,807
Go ask him.

184
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:06,099
It happens...

185
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,099
When you're on a Run.

186
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,640
Vikram Sethi... You're
a writer right?

187
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,765
Don't look like one.

188
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,807
I mean I always
thought that writers

189
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:29,682
dressed in homespun shirts, with
a bag slung over their shoulder

190
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,974
and slippers.

191
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:34,432
But look at you...

192
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:37,849
I am Dev.

193
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,849
Your case...is under me.

194
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,224
Why did you kill
your wife at home?

195
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:49,724
Stupid.

196
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:52,140
You should've taken
her to a Hill-station

197
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:54,140
and while she's busy
admiring the beautiful view

198
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,765
you could've given her a...
little push.

199
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,515
And as she spiraled to her death

200
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,640
You could have walked
away a happy man.

201
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:02,807
No one would've suspected you.

202
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:04,682
What?

203
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:07,974
Oh yes...

204
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:13,390
Your wife's dead and you're
in a state of shock!

205
00:17:13,474 --> 00:17:14,724
Where is Katherine?

206
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,140
Come let's eat and talk.

207
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:28,682
But skip the "I am innocent, I
haven't done anything" part.

208
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:29,765
Okay.

209
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,099
Last night was my book's
launch party at the Hyatt.

210
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,599
I was there since 7:30 pm.

211
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:42,265
Kat...

212
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,224
Katherine was resting at home.

213
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:48,974
The entire trip took
its toll on her...

214
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,515
She was tired.

215
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:57,182
The company, which
published your book

216
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,682
-wasn't Katherine their CEO?
-Yeah.

217
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:03,640
So she flew all the way from London
to India for the book launch.

218
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,515
but didn't attend
the launch party.

219
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,307
How tired was she?

220
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,390
Katherine has a minor heart
problem since she was a child.

221
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:13,724
I mean 'she did'

222
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,724
She had exerted herself in the
last couple of days, so...

223
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,974
I only told her to take it easy.

224
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,640
That's why I also
returned early.

225
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:36,307
Katherine.

226
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,515
Katherine.

227
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:51,182
Kat...

228
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,974
Don't want to ruin
your breakfast.

229
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:30,057
Okay... then, you
called the Police.

230
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:34,057
The Police wanted to take you
to the Station for questioning

231
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,265
and that's when you ran.

232
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,432
Why did you run?

233
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,765
Do you know how they behaved ...

234
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:45,474
I got scared.

235
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:50,349
Hey... Hey...come with us.

236
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:55,974
-Me?
-Well, we can't take her now. Can we.

237
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:58,599
So you'll have to
come with us instead.

238
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:04,599
I'm the one who called you.

239
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:08,599
Yes but... That doesn't
mean you didn't kill her.

240
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:13,349
Are you suspecting me?

241
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,974
Until the case is solved...
We suspect everyone.

242
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:17,515
-Come on...
-Let's go.

243
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,099
-I want to talk to my lawyer.
-First Talk to us, mister. Let's go.

244
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:25,599
Sir, guilty until
proven innocent.

245
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,474
-Let's go...
-Hurry up.

246
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:28,557
You see, sir...

247
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,349
In 95% of the cases, it's always
the husband who kills the wife.

248
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:32,640
Sometimes it's because
he's had an argument

249
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:33,599
with the neighbor but
takes it out on the wife

250
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,432
or it could be because he
didn't get enough dowry...

251
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,140
In fact, sometimes it's because
he didn't like her cooking.

252
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:40,140
Nobody says a word
in the beginning.

253
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:42,557
But once we reach the station
they start singing like a bird...

254
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,140
-And that's where we're going now, right?
-Yes. Come on.

255
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:48,057
-Can I use the washroom?
-Huh?

256
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:49,557
Toilet?

257
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,224
Yes, of course.

258
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:53,890
Everyone's sh** scared
to see the Police.

259
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:55,515
Tambe...

260
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:59,724
Instead of looking for the real
criminal they were framing in on me.

261
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:03,515
What else could I do?

262
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,182
-Send the body for post-mortem.
-Okay sir.

263
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:21,599
-What's taking him so long?
-I guess he's taking a big one.

264
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,557
Go...

265
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:29,349
Let's go, mister...
we've to go home.

266
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:32,724
We won't do anything... Come on

267
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,140
Kadam sir...

268
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,349
Kadam sir, he's escaped.

269
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:43,765
Running was a big mistake,

270
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:50,224
You see the Police
are like dogs.

271
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:54,015
If you had just stayed still

272
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:56,557
we would've sniffed
and left you alone.

273
00:21:57,557 --> 00:21:58,765
Anyway...

274
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:02,515
Let's say that you ran away
because you were scared.

275
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,474
But why did you kill Shekhar?

276
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,265
I didn't kill Shekhar.

277
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:10,682
I didn't even know him.

278
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,224
I was driving very fast.

279
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:21,140
I was injured.

280
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:23,932
...and in a lot of pain.

281
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:07,349
Excuse me...

282
00:23:08,182 --> 00:23:09,599
Can you please help me?
I was in an accident.

283
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:11,015
-I really need your help.
-I am sorry.

284
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,974
-Please go elsewhere.
-No-no, one-second ma'am.

285
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,265
My name is...Vikram Sethi.
I am a writer.

286
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:18,265
-I lost my phone in the accident.
-Just leave, please.

287
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:21,224
Just one second. Excuse me.
I need to...

288
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:22,890
I need to call a
doctor, actually.

289
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,724
Please, can I make
one phone call?

290
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,307
Please.

291
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,932
Just one call, okay.

292
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,974
Thank you.

293
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:52,224
Wait right here, I'll
go get the phone.

-Get out.

318
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,474
-Please believe me, I didn't murder anyone.
-I said get out.

319
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:28,849
Please, just listen
to me for a second...

320
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:37,057
Please don't open the door.

321
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:42,599
Go and stand there quietly.

322
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,224
Do you want my help or no?

323
00:25:47,682 --> 00:25:48,349
Go and stand there.

324
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:58,557
-Yeah...
-I tried the key, but the door didn't open.

325
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,890
Why did you lock the
door from inside?

326
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,765
-Come back tomorrow.
-No-no...it'll only take 5 minutes.

327
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,724
-No...I said let it be.
-But, the dishes will stink later.

328
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:05,640
No, I said come back tomorrow.

329
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:06,849
-Who's inside?
-There's no one.

330
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,182
-Where is sir?
-Sir is not at home.

331
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:09,974
-Please leave.
-Why are you behaving like this?

332
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:11,182
What happened?

333
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:13,724
You were standing
behind the partition

334
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,515
and, she was near the door.
Right?

335
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:18,515
Then why didn't she run?

336
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:20,349
Frankly, at that point it
didn't strike me as to

337
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:21,515
why she didn't run.

338
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,474
Then I thought that maybe she
really wants to help me.

339
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,640
But, ever since I
entered that house

340
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:28,432
I had this strange feeling...
something wasn't right

341
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:31,515
-Like...
-Like the coffee table was broken.

342
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:33,099
Shards of glass
scattered everywhere.

343
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:34,932
Maya had a bruise on her neck.

344
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:37,307
And she had locked the
bedroom door from outside.

345
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,557
She...was definitely
hiding something.

346
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,640
Maybe she murdered her husband

347
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,932
-and hid the body in the bedroom.
-Exactly.

348
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:49,974
-That's what I'm saying...
-And coincidentally...

349
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:57,099
After killing your wife,
you ran in to a house

350
00:26:57,807 --> 00:27:00,474
where a wife had
murdered her husband.

351
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,182
Unbelievable.

352
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,307
-Sir, last night when I...
-Sir...

353
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:05,640
Just a minute.

354
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:10,974
You're a writer, aren't you?

355
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:16,390
You write well.

356
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,849
Please hear me out, sir.

357
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,390
Excuse me.

358
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,182
Sir, Maya's here.

359
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:26,765
Have you read any of his books?

360
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,682
Sir, he's just Chetan's
'Bhagat' (fan).

361
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:31,224
And, doesn't like anyone else.

362
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,182
Who arrested Vikram
from Katherine's home?

363
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:35,474
Inspector Kadam.

364
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:36,807
-Is he here?
-Yes, sir.

365
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,640
One second.

366
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:39,057
Take this one.

367
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,224
-Kadam.
-Sir.

368
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,890
Sir...

369
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,265
-Kadam.
-Sir.

370
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:45,265
-Did you arrest Sethi?
-Yes, sir.

371
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,724
Both the times. Before he
ran, and also afterward.

372
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:48,932
Why did he run?

373
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,640
Sir, Tambe scared him
out of his wits.

374
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:52,307
He told him in 95% of cases
it's normally the husband

375
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,474
who is the killer.

376
00:27:53,765 --> 00:27:55,390
We'll make you sing
like a bird in lockup.

377
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,807
He was scared s***

378
00:27:57,724 --> 00:27:59,432
Sir, one last thing.

379
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:01,390
There's another case
registered against him.

380
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:02,890
-Who?
-Sir, Vikram.

381
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,474
A girl who committed
suicide in Aram Nagar...

382
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,765
She was the same girl on whom
Vikram's novel was based.

383
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:09,640
Her father registered
a case against him.

384
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,182
-Thank you, Kadam.
-Okay, sir.

385
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:16,265
Sir...

386
00:28:17,682 --> 00:28:19,807
Sir, I asked Maya to
sit in my office...

387
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,894
-and made sure...
-Is there another case registered

388
00:28:20,974 --> 00:28:21,932
against Vikram?

389
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,432
Yes, sir, actually...

390
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,849
A girl had committed suicide

391
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:28,765
and her father registered
a case against Vikram.

392
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:31,015
And, when were you
going to tell me?

393
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:32,932
Actually, sir, it
slipped my mind.

394
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,432
-There's so much work load, and...
-If this happens again

395
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:37,765
-you'll be off this case.
-Sorry, sir.

396
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,474
She didn't open the door,
how could I see anything.

397
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:42,432
-Fine.. Stop jabbering and leave.
-You're just wasting my time

398
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:44,640
and she hasn't paid
my dues either.

399
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,182
-Call that girl's father.
-Yes, sir.

400
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,890
Maya.

401
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,474
-Hi, I am Dev.
-Hi.

402
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,057
Please, take a seat.

403
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,974
I am really so sorry

404
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:06,182
that I had to call you in
a situation like this.

405
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:08,640
Would you like something?
Some tea or refreshments?

406
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,140
Can I just see Shekhar?

407
00:29:11,724 --> 00:29:13,057
No, I am afraid
that's impossible...

408
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,599
Not before the post mortem.

409
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:20,099
Did you charge Vikram?

410
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:24,057
Ma'am, this isn't
like baking a cake

411
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,432
where you mix all the
ingredients and voila.

412
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,432
It's a murder case

413
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,224
and, frankly, I don't even
know the entire story.

414
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,807
I'll tell you whatever
you need to know.

415
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:36,140
But...he should be
punished for his crimes.

416
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:41,182
Why do you think
Vikram killed Shekhar?

417
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:43,307
Because frankly speaking

418
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:45,432
I don't see a motive here.

419
00:29:48,557 --> 00:29:50,807
Someone who can kill his wife

420
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:54,682
won't hesitate to
kill a stranger.

421
00:29:57,182 --> 00:29:58,557
And, Shekhar...

422
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:02,932
And, Shekhar was only
trying to save me.

423
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:06,474
But that's still not a motive.

424
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,515
So, are you sure Vikram and
Shekhar didn't know each other?

425
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:14,682
No...they didn't
know each other.

426
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm Pretty sure.

427
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,932
So what happened last night?

428
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:25,599
Shekhar often returned
late from work.

429
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,432
I was alone at home.

430
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:56,515
Don't scream.

431
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:01,390
-Who else is at home?
-Who are you?

432
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,807
Who else is at home?

433
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,265
My husband...he's
in the bedroom.

434
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,515
-Where's your husband?
-Get out!

435
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,807
Go away!

436
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:40,265
Come on.

437
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:43,724
I tried the key, but
the door didn't open.

438
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:44,890
Why did you lock the
door from inside?

439
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:48,265
-Come back tomorrow.
-No-no...it'll only take 5 minutes.

440
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:49,765
No...I said let it be. You can
wash the dishes tomorrow.

441
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,474
Why you behaving like this.
Open the door.

442
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:53,224
Who's inside?

443
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:55,515
There's no one. Sir
is not at home.

444
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,765
-Please leave.
-God knows what you're doing inside.

00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:07,182

Why don't you guys believe me?

462

Why do you keep calling me

463
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:32,224
and asking me the same
question over and over again?

464
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,682
I've told you a thousand times

465
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:35,807
that man killed my daughter.

466
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,724
Why can't you ask him?

00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,890
What's going on?

468
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:40,890
Sir, he's the father

469
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:42,932
of the girl who
committed suicide.

470
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:44,890
Hello.

471
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,140
Here.

472
00:33:56,765 --> 00:34:02,515
Sir, I know you're upset
with our Department.

473
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,807
But, we just want to help.

474
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:09,432
You're not helping me

475
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:12,140
rather, you're
asking for my help.

476
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:14,390
As long as this was
my problem alone

477
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:16,057
this case wasn't
important for you.

478
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,182
Now, since it's
become your problem

479
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,557
this case has suddenly
become important to you.

480
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:28,182
But don't worry, I won't
behave the way you did.

481
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:30,724
Ask whatever you like.

482
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:34,349
Why did your daughter
commit suicide?

483
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,307
It wasn't a suicide...

484
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:39,349
It's a murder.

485
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,307
Vikram Sethi killed her.

486
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,224
Everything that
happened to Sandhya

487
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:49,390
Vikram coaxed her into letting
him write a book about it.

488
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:56,057
He said that her story can
help other rape victims cope.

489
00:34:56,432 --> 00:35:01,349
And, he promised that her
name would remain anonymous.

490
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,265
<i>The victim's named has been
leaked on Social Media.</i>

491
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:07,140
<i>Who maligned the reputation
of an innocent girl?</i>

492
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,974
<i>Police investigation hasn't</i>

493
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,640
<i>revealed any hard evidence.</i>

494
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:11,682
<i>According to the
Indian Penal Code.</i>

495
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,515
The news spread
throughout the city.

496
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,894
<i>...leaking the name is a crime.</i>

497
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:18,557
Friends and family
were embarrassed.

498
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:22,224
While others were
feeling pity for her.

499
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:27,307
Madam...ma'am...

500
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,640
Everyone wanted to
know only one thing.

501
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:33,765
We heard that there were 5 guys.

502
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:36,182
It was terrible.

503
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:41,015
And it's all that
bloody Vikram's fault.

504
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,099
He sweet-talked her into it.

505
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:50,807
We never imagined he
could be such a bas***

506
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,432
People's sympathy

507
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,849
...killed my daughter.

508
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:24,265
Sir...

509
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:29,307
-Cheers, sir.
-Cheers.

510
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,390
Both Maya and Vikram's
stories are believable.

511
00:36:35,474 --> 00:36:38,599
We just have to find out
who is telling the truth.

512
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:43,849
I feel there are three
sides to this story.

513
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:48,182
Vikram's...Maya's...and
the truth.

514
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:49,640
And We have to find the truth.

515
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:52,015
But how's it possible to
find it in 2 days, sir?

516
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:57,224
-Ohhh...so you're handling this case?
-Hmmm...

517
00:36:58,932 --> 00:37:00,849
He can't be the murderer...

518
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,890
He's so good looking.

519
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,099
Then, he must have killed
her with his looks.

520
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,974
According to you...

521
00:37:09,432 --> 00:37:11,224
Everyone is a criminal.

522
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:18,015
But genuinely Sir,
Maya is innocent.

523
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:19,682
According to her
Vikram's innocent

524
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:21,182
and, according to you
Maya's innocent.

525
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:24,140
So did Shekhar hit himself on
the head with the candle-stand?

526
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:28,852
<i>This is RJ Anmol with you</i>

527
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:32,390
<i>and it's still pouring
in Mumbai, but...</i>

528
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,724
Sir please tell us...

529
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,390
Sir one question please...

530
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:51,349
Stop pacing around!

531
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,682
Sit down.

532
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:56,265
Wait a minute... Come here.

533
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,557
I said come here, Do you
need an invitation?

534
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:00,765
Come here...

535
00:38:02,557 --> 00:38:04,890
Hold this... hold it.

536
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:08,765
I've to keep telling you the
Same thing over and over again.

537
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:11,974
Now hold this.

538
00:38:12,182 --> 00:38:13,307
Give that.

539
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:19,265
Wait...

540
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:23,182
I am doing it na... Why
you poking around.

541
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,640
Come on...

542
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,807
Yeah...

543
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,474
What the...

544
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:39,057
Yeah... See?

545
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:42,640
Go sit.

546
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:46,640
Sir!

547
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:57,890
So, Mr. Writer, according
to your story...

548
00:38:57,974 --> 00:38:59,432
It's not a story, sir.

549
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:02,474
Ya Whatever it is...

550
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,349
What happened next?

551
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:11,307
After Maya's maid left

552
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,432
I told her about my situation.

553
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,265
And, she believed you?

554
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:18,099
Yes.

555
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,432
Let me have a look.

556
00:39:31,557 --> 00:39:32,932
In the accident...

557
00:39:40,182 --> 00:39:41,557
Take your jacket off.

558
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:43,724
It's okay, I'll be fine.

559
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,057
Take your jacket
off and sit down.

560
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,432
Let me clean it.

561
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:02,599
Show me.

562
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,974
This might burn a bit.

563
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:29,682
It's okay.

564
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,015
Do you think I should surrender?

565
00:40:39,224 --> 00:40:40,682
Surrender?

566
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:44,474
Do you really think the
Police want to help you?

567
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:47,432
They're just interested
in closing the case.

568
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:51,807
If they can't find the real
murderer they will put it on you.

569
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,224
Or if your lucky
maybe someone else.

570
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,724
My husband is a lawyer.

571
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,474
I know how all this works.

572
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:08,932
In fact, my husband should
be back any minute.

573
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:13,807
Since you've waited this long
why not stay a little longer.

574
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,599
Thank you.

575
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:31,224
-But the news...
-Don't stress yourself.

576
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:32,724
Just try and relax.

577
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:35,474
Would you like
something to drink?

578
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:39,015
-Can I have some water?
-Water?

579
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:41,557
-Have a drink...
-No wait, listen...

580
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,932
Come on, where else will you
find such a good hostage.

581
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:03,640
Hello, Maya

582
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,349
Hello, sir.

583
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:11,474
Can I get you anything?

584
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:14,349
-No, thank you.
-Sure?

585
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:18,849
Small whiskey, rum,
maybe some wine?

586
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:20,182
Sorry?

587
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:24,140
Come on, you enjoy a
criminal's company.

588
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,932
Why not the Police.

589
00:42:26,932 --> 00:42:28,349
What do you mean?

590
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,724
Maya...Maya...Maya...

591
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,432
We found two glasses
at your house

592
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,890
with Vikram and your
fingerprints on it.

593
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,390
And, you'll were definitely
not drinking apple juice.

594
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:42,182
Hold on...

595
00:42:42,682 --> 00:42:45,557
I didn't have a drink
with Vikram willingly.

596
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,557
Is there a locker at home?

597
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:53,182
Do you want money?

598
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:55,349
-If you want money, I can...
-Stay there!

599
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:57,932
Is there a locker at home?

600
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:09,057
Can I drink some water?

601
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:12,890
It's right there.

602
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:43,099
Do...do you want something?

603
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:44,849
Shall I make you a drink?

604
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:46,515
Wait, just a second.

605
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,057
I'll make you a drink.

606
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,265
Do you have a bandage?

607
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:47,765
In the washroom.

608
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:05,057
I've to use the washroom.

609
00:45:06,557 --> 00:45:07,432
Go ahead.

610
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,682
-Like this...
-Then don't...

611
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:14,724
Okay, but can you
please turn around.

612
00:45:54,182 --> 00:45:55,974
-How much longer?
-Just a minute.

613
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:57,390
Hurry up.

614
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,515
No, not at all!

615
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:23,890
I didn't have any
reason to be aggressive

616
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:25,557
in fact she was very friendly.

617
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:29,140
If she was being so friendly

618
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:31,349
then, why didn't you also?

619
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:34,741
You look like a man
who enjoys himself.

620
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:37,283
I don't know what you would've
done if you were in my place?

621
00:46:38,616 --> 00:46:40,991
But all I could think
about then was Katherine.

622
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:47,783
Just can't believe she's gone.

623
00:46:52,116 --> 00:46:53,616
Everything was fine yesterday.

624
00:46:58,491 --> 00:47:00,533
I don't even know how she died.

625
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:04,074
Who killed her? Why?

626
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,116
And I am on the run...

627
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:19,074
I just...

628
00:47:19,658 --> 00:47:22,324
I just don't know what to feel.

629
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:24,908
Sorry.

630
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:26,283
It's...

631
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:31,241
Have this... It's the best
way to drown your sorrows.

632
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:44,158
You really loved her.

633
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:51,908
People say all men are the same.

634
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:55,199
Not true.

635
00:47:57,866 --> 00:48:00,033
I wish Shekhar was
more like you.

636
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:08,658
How did the table break?

637
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:11,953
I dropped a vase on it.

638
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:13,741
I can be clumsy sometimes.

639
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:30,991
That's Shekhar's wallet.

640
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,366
He must have forgotten it.

641
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:36,699
I'm telling you, sir... something
was definitely not right.

642
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:38,616
Your right it does
sound strange...

643
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:42,533
You were on the run after
murdering your wife

644
00:48:42,908 --> 00:48:44,991
and Shekhar's wife was
coming on to you.

645
00:48:45,366 --> 00:48:47,908
I agree...it is strange.

646
00:48:49,449 --> 00:48:50,783
Did you use a condom?

647
00:48:52,908 --> 00:48:54,033
No?

648
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:56,866
Its better if you didn't

649
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:58,908
cause it will prove
your story right.

650
00:48:58,991 --> 00:48:59,866
What is wrong with you guys?

651
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:01,494
I've been trying to tell
you the table was broken

652
00:49:01,574 --> 00:49:03,449
-his wallet was there...
-Hey boy...

653
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:07,741
Keep the volume down

654
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:12,658
otherwise we have ways
to do that for you...

655
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:17,699
Sit...

656
00:49:18,908 --> 00:49:24,241
You... You guys don't get it.

657
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:27,991
I am telling you, sir,
Shekhar was already there.

658
00:49:29,783 --> 00:49:31,824
You saw Shekhar
come home, right?

659
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:32,911
Yes, sir.

660
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:35,699
He came home at around 7:30 pm.

661
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,908
-And, you didn't see him leave?
-No, sir.

662
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:41,408
Because my shift
ends at 8 o'clock.

663
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:44,199
He didn't leave as
long as I was on duty.

664
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:47,033
Sir...Shekhar's
post-mortem report.

665
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:49,408
What is this? What
have you done?

666
00:49:49,658 --> 00:49:52,241
-You should've wiped your shoes first.
-Sorry, sir.

667
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:54,533
And you?

668
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,408
Sir, I was sick that day...
stomach problem.

669
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,991
When I was in the
bathroom I don't know...

670
00:50:00,283 --> 00:50:02,783
But, when I wasn't...
he didn't either.

671
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:03,953
What?

672
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,074
I mean... I...

673
00:50:06,158 --> 00:50:07,991
I didn't see him leave, sir.

674
00:50:11,824 --> 00:50:13,991
Shekhar returned at
around 12 o'clock.

675
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:19,199
If he hadn't come home

676
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:22,074
then he would've killed me.

677
00:50:28,574 --> 00:50:29,824
-Shekhar!
-What are you doing?

678
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:31,949
-Let Maya go.
-Close the door.

679
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:34,074
What do you want?

680
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,283
Please...talk to me.

681
00:50:42,866 --> 00:50:44,241
Leave...

682
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:48,824
Shekhar.

683
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:52,866
-Let me go.
-Leave her.

684
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:15,741
By the time I returned

685
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:21,533
he had already killed Shekhar.

686
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:27,283
I shouldn't have left him.

687
00:51:32,616 --> 00:51:34,408
I shouldn't have left him.

688
00:51:47,574 --> 00:51:48,616
So...

689
00:51:49,408 --> 00:51:51,408
Did Shekhar always
come home late?

690
00:51:52,158 --> 00:51:53,408
No...

691
00:51:53,658 --> 00:51:55,866
Only when he was busy with work.

692
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,824
Then he must've been
really busy that day.

693
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:06,116
Tell me something is your Security
guard's mother dead or alive?

694
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,824
-I am sorry.
-You see...

695
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:13,574
Your Security guard
swore on his mother

696
00:52:14,491 --> 00:52:16,741
and said that Shekhar
came home at 7:30.

697
00:52:17,491 --> 00:52:19,116
And you won't lie to us.

698
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:24,158
Oh yes, he did come
home at 7:30, but

699
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,033
only for a few minutes.

700
00:52:26,116 --> 00:52:29,991
Then he finally returned
home at midnight.

701
00:52:32,574 --> 00:52:35,366
I guess he forgot to give you a
goodbye kiss in the morning.

702
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,366
Do you think I am stupid?

703
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:42,074
I am telling you, sir, Shekhar
did come home at 7:30

704
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:44,116
and only after he
left Vikram came.

705
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,033
And, everything that
happened after that

706
00:52:46,116 --> 00:52:50,491
-everything important, I...
-You don't decide what's important!

707
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:54,199
Now, tell me everything
that happened

708
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:56,866
after you woke-up
in the morning.

709
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:57,953
Sir...

710
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,949
What time did you get
up in the morning?

711
00:53:00,408 --> 00:53:02,033
Seven... I woke up at 7 o'clock.

712
00:53:03,491 --> 00:53:05,449
-Next, I had breakfast...
-You didn't brush?

713
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:07,953
-Excuse me?
-Brush... floss clean your teeth...

714
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,866
-Didn't you brush your teeth?
-After we freshened up...

715
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,741
Why did Shekhar
come home at 7:30?

716
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:13,699
I don't know... He came
back for some papers.

717
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:15,908
-Not entirely sure why?
-Maya, look at me.

718
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:19,533
According to the
post-mortem reports

719
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,866
Shekhar died between 8 and 12.

720
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,241
What are you trying to imply?
That I killed my husband.

721
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:29,699
The Security guard saw
Shekhar come home at 7:30.

722
00:53:30,158 --> 00:53:33,408
But no one...saw him
leave after that.

723
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:36,911
Sir, I've been trying to tell you
that I didn't kill Shekhar...

724
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:39,783
You...have been saying
a lot of things...

725
00:53:40,824 --> 00:53:43,158
-But, none of it is true.
-I am not lying.

726
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:46,866
Why will I kill my husband?
I didn't kill Shekhar.

727
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,699
I didn't kill my husband!

728
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:54,991
I loved him.

729
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:57,199
I didn't kill my husband!

730
00:54:36,074 --> 00:54:38,783
-Sir, almonds?
-No...

731
00:54:38,866 --> 00:54:39,658
No...

732
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:41,866
<i>Please close the door.</i>

733
00:54:42,283 --> 00:54:45,533
Sir, freshly soaked almonds
helps make your memory sharper.

734
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,699
You won't forget anything.
And remember everything.

735
00:54:49,866 --> 00:54:51,491
And Who reminds
you to eat these?

736
00:54:51,574 --> 00:54:53,199
<i>Please close the door.</i>

737
00:54:56,658 --> 00:54:59,033
<i>Please close the door.</i>

738
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:02,366
Why don't you just come and
show me how to shut it?

739
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,074
Did you find out any other
information about Vikram?

740
00:55:05,158 --> 00:55:06,324
Yes, sir...

741
00:55:07,824 --> 00:55:11,116
His first book was
a huge success.

742
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:12,449
In fact, he even
won awards for it.

743
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:15,158
But his second book
was a disaster.

744
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:19,574
So, it was very important to our Writer
that his third book be successful.

745
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:21,574
Sir, his...

746
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:23,366
What are you building?

747
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,366
Sir, his third book would've
been a disaster too.

748
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,783
But, then he leaked
Sandhya's name

749
00:55:29,866 --> 00:55:33,116
the rape case victim and the
media took a keen interest.

750
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,491
-And the book was an instant bestseller.
-I see...

751
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:37,741
-Which is the house?
-Yes?

752
00:55:46,366 --> 00:55:47,994
-Yes?
-Mrs. Kawatkar.

753
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:48,949
Yes speaking.

754
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:51,199
From Colaba Police Station...

755
00:55:51,324 --> 00:55:53,491
Oh yes, come in, come in.

756
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:55,783
We've been waiting for you.

757
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:57,574
-Where's the camera?
-Camera?

758
00:55:57,658 --> 00:56:00,699
-Uncle, I want to be on TV too.
-Wait...

759
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,783
You've come for the
interview with no camera?

760
00:56:02,866 --> 00:56:05,783
Not an interview madam, we
came here for information.

761
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:07,783
Ohh...

762
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,574
So you were saying on the phone

763
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:13,533
that you've information about
Kathereen Sethi's murder.

764
00:56:13,658 --> 00:56:14,366
Yes-yes...

765
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:17,033
You see, it was our
tenth-anniversary

766
00:56:17,116 --> 00:56:20,783
and, he took me to JW
Marriot to celebrate .

767
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:22,533
We booked it on MMT.

768
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:25,241
It was so romantic.

769
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:28,158
He's like that, you know...
Completely different.

770
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,741
-Then, madam?
-Then what?

771
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:32,658
I wore that deep-neck
blouse for him

772
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:35,324
and you should have seen
his face turn pink.

773
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:38,658
Immediately he took out his new
12 megapixel camera phone,

774
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:39,866
To take my picture.

775
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:43,158
He was trying to
capture my video...

776
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:44,449
Instead

777
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:46,741
he captured the fight.

778
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,699
-What's wrong?
-Come here.

779
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:53,283
Look.

780
00:56:54,324 --> 00:56:55,574
Zoom in!

781
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:22,033
Morning.

782
00:57:23,366 --> 00:57:24,699
How are you doing, buddy?

783
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:28,699
Ok... This is a
little embarrassing.

784
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:31,366
But I need a small
favor from you.

785
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,408
Can I get your autograph?

786
00:57:36,866 --> 00:57:38,533
I am serious, I'm not joking.

787
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:40,408
My wife's a huge fan.

788
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:47,366
Thank you.

789
00:57:48,824 --> 00:57:50,574
We had a little argument
in the morning.

790
00:57:51,074 --> 00:57:53,699
So you see...if I get
your autograph for her

791
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:55,824
at least I won't have to
sleep on the sofa tonight.

792
00:57:56,324 --> 00:57:57,741
You know how it is...

793
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:59,783
These Husband-wife
disagreements.

794
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:02,866
I'm sure you and Katherine
had your share of them.

795
00:58:05,158 --> 00:58:06,699
I've heard that your
books and looks

796
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,574
are quite popular
amongst the women.

797
00:58:10,074 --> 00:58:11,741
Didn't Katherine feel jealous?

798
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:14,116
No, never.

799
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,741
Oh, come on...

800
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:18,074
You're such a celebrated writer

801
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:20,074
always surrounded by women.

802
00:58:20,408 --> 00:58:22,408
You never had the
hots for anyone?

803
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,074
I don't know what you're
trying to get at.

804
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:27,366
We were happily married.

805
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:30,033
-You can ask anyone.
-We did...

806
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:34,408
-Your neighbor.
-My neighbor? What did she say?

807
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:36,741
See for yourself.

808
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:53,449
Look, this is not
what you think it is.

809
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,699
All I can think of

810
00:58:57,991 --> 00:58:59,199
is that Katherine and
you had an argument.

811
00:58:59,283 --> 00:59:01,033
And two days later Katherine
ended up up dead.

812
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:03,324
I admit Katherine and
I had an argument

813
00:59:04,283 --> 00:59:05,908
but, you don't know
the reason behind it.

814
00:59:05,991 --> 00:59:08,658
I promised her,
Katherine...and her father.

815
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:11,033
But you still leaked her name.

816
00:59:11,408 --> 00:59:13,366
<i>Katherine published this
book at her own risk.</i>

817
00:59:13,574 --> 00:59:16,783
She killed herself...
because of you.

818
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:19,741
<i>It was very important for
this book to succeed.</i>

819
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:22,283
I can't change that.

820
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:23,574
No one can.

821
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:26,949
<i>She was doing all this for us.</i>

822
00:59:28,116 --> 00:59:30,449
<i>But Sandhya's name
shouldn't have leaked out.</i>

823
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:32,866
<i>I was really upset.</i>

824
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:35,533
I do...I'll fix this.

825
00:59:36,283 --> 00:59:37,449
Trust me.

826
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:40,241
Okay.

827
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:46,533
Here.

828
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:51,324
<i>And I didn't want the book to
launch after what happened.</i>

829
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:56,158
<i>But Katherine didn't want
to cancel the book launch.</i>

830
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:59,366
The book launch is
two days from now.

831
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:01,074
You cannot cancel it.

832
01:00:01,824 --> 01:00:04,199
I am sorry...I can't do this.

833
01:00:04,283 --> 01:00:07,283
It's not right. And I
know you know that too.

834
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:11,408
Let me remind you that
you're under contract.

835
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:13,324
And if you go against it

836
01:00:13,408 --> 01:00:18,283
I'll file a case so big, that
you will never write again.

837
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:25,866
Katherine was a
wonderful person, sir.

838
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:28,158
I owe her everything.

839
01:00:32,824 --> 01:00:34,824
That's why please don't
drag her name into this.

840
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,949
She was under tremendous pressure
that why she wouldn't understand.

841
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:53,199
-Vilas, where's Dev sir?
-Don't know, sir.

842
01:01:04,824 --> 01:01:05,866
Hey...

843
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:09,449
-Where's Dev sir?
-Don't know.

844
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:11,366
Go back to sleep.

845
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:25,991
-Sir.
-What? I'm busy.

846
01:01:26,158 --> 01:01:27,033
Sorry, sir.

847
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,783
But Katherine Sethi's post
mortem report has arrived.

848
01:01:29,866 --> 01:01:31,366
She died of a heart attack.

849
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:33,241
And, in Shekhar's report

850
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:35,741
the cause of death is
'Blunt Force Trauma'.

851
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:38,824
I already told you that.

852
01:01:39,824 --> 01:01:42,283
Sir, we found fingerprints
on the candle stand.

853
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,949
It's a common household object.
You'll find many fingerprints on it.

854
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:48,866
Is there any toilet
paper out there?

855
01:01:50,616 --> 01:01:51,866
Yeah.

856
01:01:57,033 --> 01:01:59,116
-Ready?
-Yeah.

857
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:01,408
-Ready?
-Yeah.

858
01:02:01,574 --> 01:02:03,699
-Ready?
-Throw...!

859
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:09,241
Did you catch it?

860
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:11,158
So that means we've nothing.

861
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:13,366
No-no, sir. There is one thing.

862
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:17,158
Sir, Shekhar Sinha's
height was 6 feet

863
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,949
and looking at this head
injury, we can assume that

864
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:21,449
the assailant was at
least 6 feet tall.

865
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:28,824
But, couldn't it also be that
Shekhar's Assailant was short

866
01:02:29,158 --> 01:02:32,324
and he attacked him when
he was sitting down.

867
01:02:32,574 --> 01:02:34,783
That's quite unlikely.
Let me explain.

868
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:39,449
Please, sir.

869
01:02:45,116 --> 01:02:46,199
One more time.

870
01:02:51,366 --> 01:02:52,824
If you notice, sir

871
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:54,866
there's a huge difference
between both the injuries.

872
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:56,783
In place and angle.

873
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:01,116
So you see sir,
it's quite evident

874
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:03,658
that Shekhar was attacked
when he was standing.

875
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,366
And the assailant is
at least 6 feet tall.

876
01:03:14,866 --> 01:03:16,199
Come, you've been summoned.

877
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:17,783
Time to go.

878
01:03:18,366 --> 01:03:19,366
Where's Dev?

879
01:03:23,616 --> 01:03:25,491
Dev? Who Dev?

880
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:28,241
Amdev or Kamdev?

881
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:29,953
Get up...up...

882
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:32,408
Hey...take him to the lockup.

883
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:34,324
-Come on.
-I want to talk to Dev.

884
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:36,283
Yeah...get up.

885
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:37,699
According to forensics report

886
01:03:37,783 --> 01:03:41,283
Shekhar Saxena was killed by
someone having a height of 6 feet.

887
01:03:41,366 --> 01:03:43,324
Vikram Sethi is 6'1

888
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:47,699
and, his fingerprints were
on the murder weapon.

889
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:50,408
-I want to talk to Dev.
-Fine...get up.

890
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:53,033
Stop with your English... I'll
make you sing in Marathi.

891
01:03:53,116 --> 01:03:54,199
Hold on...I want to talk to Dev.

892
01:03:54,283 --> 01:03:55,866
What about Katherine
Sethi's murder?

893
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:56,908
We need some more time for that.

894
01:03:56,991 --> 01:03:58,994
Katherine Sethi's forensics
report stated that

895
01:03:59,074 --> 01:04:00,366
she died of a heart attack.

896
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:01,994
We've also talking to
her doctor in London

897
01:04:02,074 --> 01:04:03,741
for her past medical reports.

898
01:04:03,866 --> 01:04:08,953
But as of now, we've enough to
charge Vikram Sethi for murder.

899
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:11,491
-Listen to me...
-Yeah-yeah, we'll listen to you.

900
01:04:11,574 --> 01:04:14,199
-What's going on here?
-There was someone else.

901
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:17,074
-Take him away. I said take him away.
-Listen to me.

902
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:18,574
Stop. Catch him.

903
01:04:18,658 --> 01:04:19,658
Come.

904
01:04:21,033 --> 01:04:22,699
Excuse me sir.

905
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,158
Sir, will you please look this way?
Thank you.

906
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:25,991
Sir!

907
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,283
Dev! Dev!

908
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:32,366
Stop... Catch him...
Catch him...

909
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:42,074
Stop...I'll beat you up.

910
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:43,116
Wait...

911
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:45,658
Catch him.

912
01:04:48,741 --> 01:04:49,953
Catch him.

913
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:50,824
Stop.

914
01:04:51,866 --> 01:04:54,033
-Let me meet Dev.
-Quiet.

915
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:55,741
-Let me speak with Dev.
-Quiet...

916
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:58,241
Take him upstairs, lock him up.

917
01:04:59,158 --> 01:04:59,783
He's lost his mind.

918
01:04:59,866 --> 01:05:01,533
-Hello.
-What's going on?

919
01:05:01,658 --> 01:05:02,699
Nothing, sir. Nothing.

920
01:05:02,783 --> 01:05:04,366
-Go upstairs.
-It's all okay.

921
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:06,366
Everything's under control.

922
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:08,241
Did you find out anything
about those photos?

923
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:10,241
Photos? What photos?

924
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:11,994
The ones we found
at Maya's home.

925
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,158
Oh yes...

926
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:15,324
Its from a small time
detective from Andheri.

927
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:17,491
It's all been sorted out.
He's coming tomorrow.

928
01:05:17,866 --> 01:05:19,116
Okay.

929
01:05:47,324 --> 01:05:49,949
Hey, writer...chew on this.

930
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,449
Naik, when he pushed you down...
Did you get hurt?

931
01:05:54,574 --> 01:05:55,324
No, sir.

932
01:05:55,408 --> 01:05:57,658
You know after you fell
down I picked up my stick

933
01:05:57,741 --> 01:06:01,366
and then, and flogged
him quite well.

934
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:03,033
You know how it is ...

935
01:06:03,116 --> 01:06:05,033
Yes Sir I saw.

936
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:15,366
Detective.

937
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:17,866
Where is your hat,
goggles, coat?

938
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:20,574
-That's only in the movies, sir.
-I see...

939
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:25,241
So how do you peek
inside others bedrooms?

940
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:27,699
Sometimes from a tree, or
the building next door.

941
01:08:27,866 --> 01:08:32,533
But how do you know when the
action's going to start?

942
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:35,824
We don't. Sometimes we
have to wait all day.

943
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:36,741
I see...

944
01:08:36,824 --> 01:08:40,158
So you must be seeing a
live sex show everyday.

945
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,741
...minus the sound, huh!

946
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:50,283
-What a Great job.
-What's so great about it?

947
01:08:50,366 --> 01:08:51,783
We've to work very
hard for a living.

948
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:54,241
Someone else is doing all the work...
your just...

949
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:55,366
Now Take Shekhar for instance

950
01:08:55,449 --> 01:08:57,033
he's got a one-way
ticket to heaven.

951
01:08:57,241 --> 01:08:59,866
So, who's going to pay you?

952
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:03,824
I've heard that the police
pays for information.

953
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:06,449
That also only happens
in the movies.

954
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:09,741
Sir, detective.

955
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,199
-Who is it, Ramesh?
-It's Suresh, not Ramesh.

956
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:31,953
Come on... put the beer down.

957
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:33,241
-You guys can't just barge in here?
-Let's go.

958
01:09:33,324 --> 01:09:35,241
Leave that... Sir's called you.

959
01:09:35,741 --> 01:09:37,408
Look, I am a lawyer,
I know my rights.

960
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:38,866
-Get out.
-Listen.

961
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:40,324
-Out.
-Listen...

962
01:09:40,616 --> 01:09:43,033
If you're right,
there's nothing wrong.

963
01:09:43,408 --> 01:09:44,366
-What?
-Sir...

964
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:45,994
-He doesn't get it.
-One minute..

965
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:47,824
-Bring him in...
-We'll explain it to him in our language.

966
01:09:47,949 --> 01:09:50,324
-Keep the phone down.
-Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

967
01:09:50,408 --> 01:09:51,408
I am coming.

968
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:52,949
Come on...

969
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:54,866
-Come on, Tambe.
-Sir, one minute.

970
01:09:55,033 --> 01:09:56,324
Fingerprint.

971
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:07,699
<i>Dev, if the media finds
out about these pictures</i>

972
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:09,658
<i>then, our department
will be ridiculed.</i>

973
01:10:10,033 --> 01:10:13,866
<i>Do whatever it takes, but
solve the case in one day.</i>

974
01:10:14,366 --> 01:10:15,283
<i>Understand!</i>

975
01:10:28,408 --> 01:10:29,574
Are you in charge?

976
01:10:30,116 --> 01:10:31,449
What is the meaning of this.

977
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:33,866
Forcibly dragging someone
out of their home!

978
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:40,533
Is this how you're going
to interrogate me?

979
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,908
Firstly it's a Sunday

980
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:44,616
and you don't even
have a warrant.

981
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,949
Ok... Let's get straight to it...
What do you want?

982
01:10:50,658 --> 01:10:52,908
You had come to drop Maya at the
station the other day, right?

983
01:10:56,824 --> 01:10:58,574
Yes, sir. She's a
friend after all.

984
01:10:58,866 --> 01:11:01,199
If friends don't help each
other, then who will.

985
01:11:01,283 --> 01:11:02,908
I am sure you have
friends as well.

986
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:12,991
What kind of friendship is this?

987
01:11:14,366 --> 01:11:16,324
One with benefits it seems.

988
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,366
I'm sure there's a story
behind these photos as well.

989
01:11:35,949 --> 01:11:37,699
Shekhar was over-ambitious.

990
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:42,658
He never had time for me.

991
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:48,241
Maybe that's why we started
having differences.

992
01:11:48,574 --> 01:11:50,199
That doesn't mean
that we killed him.

993
01:11:52,324 --> 01:11:54,533
Shekhar and I were
very good friends.

994
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:56,658
Chirag used to spend
time with me.

995
01:11:56,991 --> 01:11:59,949
Talk to me... He
understood me...

996
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:01,616
I don't know how this happened.

997
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:04,991
But it didn't feel wrong.

998
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:07,074
Maybe we should've
never done it.

999
01:12:07,158 --> 01:12:09,449
And that's why we were
trying to end it.

1000
01:12:12,033 --> 01:12:13,074
That's the truth.

1001
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:20,908
Everyone seems to
be a bloody writer.

1002
01:12:22,241 --> 01:12:25,199
Both your stories
are word for word.

1003
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:27,991
Well rehearsed.

1004
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:31,283
On the day of
Shehkar's murder...

1005
01:12:31,949 --> 01:12:33,074
Did the two of you meet?

1006
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:37,491
No, sir. That day I was
at the office all day

1007
01:12:37,574 --> 01:12:39,574
and after that, I went
straight home in the evening.

1008
01:12:41,616 --> 01:12:46,741
Really then...there's a really
big conspiracy against you.

1009
01:12:47,741 --> 01:12:51,366
Because your blood was
found at the crime scene.

1010
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:55,824
Now quickly give yourself a call

1011
01:12:57,449 --> 01:12:59,074
because, you my friend

1012
01:13:00,824 --> 01:13:02,366
desperately need a lawyer.

1013
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:06,241
Okay.

1014
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:09,574
Yeah, that day I...

1015
01:13:10,283 --> 01:13:14,616
Maya, we should stop this.

1016
01:13:16,033 --> 01:13:17,491
What if Shekhar walks in on us?

1017
01:13:17,783 --> 01:13:19,574
Shekhar never comes
home so soon.

1018
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:23,616
I have a feeling
he knows about us.

1019
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:28,366
Shekhar will never know.
What's wrong with you?

1020
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,574
Maya, I am trying to talk.

1021
01:13:34,408 --> 01:13:36,699
Just listen... Just stop...

1022
01:13:40,366 --> 01:13:41,366
Okay.

1023
01:13:45,324 --> 01:13:46,241
Okay!

1024
01:13:50,574 --> 01:13:52,033
Sh**' get up.

1025
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:56,491
-What were you saying, Chirag.
-Huh...

1026
01:13:57,824 --> 01:13:59,574
Shekhar comes really
late these days.

1027
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:02,911
Shekhar, we were just
talking about you.

1028
01:14:02,991 --> 01:14:04,241
You're home early today.

1029
01:14:04,991 --> 01:14:07,658
Chirag... what would
you like to have?

1030
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:11,241
Nothing, buddy... I
think I should leave.

1031
01:14:11,324 --> 01:14:13,366
I was just telling here...
I'm getting late.

1032
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,741
Where are you going? Sit down!

1033
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:16,408
What are you doing, Shekhar?

1034
01:14:16,908 --> 01:14:17,866
What's wrong with you?

1035
01:14:20,574 --> 01:14:21,949
What's wrong with you?

1036
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:28,574
What is this?

1037
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:39,116
Shekhar, this...

1038
01:14:41,324 --> 01:14:44,199
Shekhar... let me explain...
Listen to me.

1039
01:14:44,283 --> 01:14:45,324
Explain?

1040
01:14:48,241 --> 01:14:49,366
Explain?

1041
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:53,241
Is there something
more than this?

1042
01:14:53,324 --> 01:14:54,699
Try to understand, Shekhar.

1043
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,866
-What?
-There's nothing between us.

1044
01:14:56,949 --> 01:14:58,783
Did he come here to
break up with you?

1045
01:14:58,866 --> 01:14:59,824
This happened long back.

1046
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:02,616
-It was a mistake, try to understand...
-Understand what?

1047
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:04,866
-Tell me...I am listening.
-Tell me...

1048
01:15:04,949 --> 01:15:07,491
Shekhar just calm down. Please.

1049
01:15:07,574 --> 01:15:08,866
-Tell me.
-I will.

1050
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:10,491
-Talk to me...look here.
-What?

1051
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:11,574
Shekhar.

1052
01:15:12,283 --> 01:15:15,074
Chirag! You okay?

1053
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:16,658
Your bleeding.

1054
01:15:16,741 --> 01:15:17,616
Get up.

1055
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,991
After that I thought
best I leave.

1056
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:30,908
And I did.

1057
01:15:31,783 --> 01:15:32,866
What happened next?

1058
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,283
I was really concerned
about both of them.

1059
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:41,574
I tried calling Maya, just to
check if everything's okay.

1060
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:43,991
But her phone was switched off.

1061
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:46,783
So I went over to Maya's house.

1062
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:53,991
Maya, I've been trying
to call you for so long

1063
01:15:54,074 --> 01:15:55,533
why aren't you
answering your phone?

1064
01:15:55,616 --> 01:15:57,949
Chirag, I think
you should leave.

1065
01:15:58,616 --> 01:16:00,908
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am fine. Pease leave.

1066
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:03,283
-Wait...where's Shekhar?
-Chirag, just...

1067
01:16:03,366 --> 01:16:04,491
Maya, just listen...

1068
01:16:06,574 --> 01:16:08,574
What could I tell Chirag?

1069
01:16:09,616 --> 01:16:11,824
Vikram was standing
right behind the door.

1070
01:16:22,408 --> 01:16:24,991
I know that in your
opinion I am wrong.

1071
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:29,574
Yes, I know I made a mistake.

1072
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:31,824
I had an affair...

1073
01:16:35,074 --> 01:16:37,449
I was just lonely!

1074
01:16:43,574 --> 01:16:45,574
And what hurts me most is that

1075
01:16:45,658 --> 01:16:48,491
Right before he died...
I broke his heart.

1076
01:16:54,324 --> 01:16:55,866
I did love him.

1077
01:17:01,866 --> 01:17:04,074
<i>Katherine was a
wonderful person, sir.</i>

1078
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:05,824
<i>I owe her everything.</i>

1079
01:17:05,908 --> 01:17:07,908
<i>Someone who can kill his wife</i>

1080
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:10,408
<i>won't hesitate to
kill a stranger.</i>

1081
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:12,283
<i>I didn't kill Shekhar.</i>

1082
01:17:12,366 --> 01:17:13,741
<i>I didn't kill Shekhar.</i>

1083
01:17:14,574 --> 01:17:15,824
<i>I didn't even know him.</i>

1084
01:17:15,908 --> 01:17:17,741
<i>She's definitely
hiding something.</i>

1085
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:35,658
What's wrong?

1086
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:39,783
I can't fight it anymore.

1087
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:44,866
Not you...

1088
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:48,574
Nor your questions

1089
01:17:49,908 --> 01:17:51,616
or the fact, that...

1090
01:17:54,283 --> 01:17:55,741
Katherine is no more.

1091
01:18:08,574 --> 01:18:10,533
You know, I always thought that

1092
01:18:10,699 --> 01:18:12,574
you really wanted to know
my side of the story.

1093
01:18:16,783 --> 01:18:19,199
But no you just
want to frame me.

1094
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:25,491
Because you have no interest
in knowing the truth.

1095
01:18:26,241 --> 01:18:28,199
Tell me your side of the story.

1096
01:18:29,074 --> 01:18:30,324
I am listening.

1097
01:18:34,824 --> 01:18:37,449
That's Shekhar's wallet...
He must have forgotten it.

1098
01:18:46,074 --> 01:18:48,574
-Where are you going?
-Maya, I think I should leave.

1099
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,449
Shekhar will be here any minute.

1100
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:51,241
Listen...

1101
01:18:54,741 --> 01:18:56,408
See...Shekhar's here.

1102
01:18:57,908 --> 01:18:59,533
Sir that wasn't Shekhar

1103
01:18:59,824 --> 01:19:02,241
but, Maya introduced
him to me as Shekhar.

1104
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:03,824
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

1105
01:19:03,908 --> 01:19:05,366
I told Gautam sir, but

1106
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,241
no one was listening to me.

1107
01:19:07,866 --> 01:19:08,866
How did he look?

1108
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:12,574
He was about my height,
fair, average looking

1109
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,574
and, he was wearing glasses.

1110
01:19:20,783 --> 01:19:21,991
Was this him?

1111
01:19:26,574 --> 01:19:27,574
Yes, sir.

1112
01:19:30,574 --> 01:19:31,574
Shekhar.

1113
01:19:31,741 --> 01:19:32,574
Play along.

1114
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:34,199
Come in.

1115
01:19:37,574 --> 01:19:41,449
Shekhar, this is Vikram.
Actually, he needed your help.

1116
01:19:41,616 --> 01:19:44,074
-Oh, hi. Shekhar.
-Hi.

1117
01:19:44,616 --> 01:19:46,574
Like I said before
Shekhar is a lawyer.

1118
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:48,866
Now will you relax... Let me
explain everything to him.

1119
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:50,158
Please, come.

1120
01:20:21,366 --> 01:20:22,491
Vikram.

1121
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:32,866
Hurry up.

1122
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:40,199
Maya, the police are downstairs.
Go get them.

1123
01:21:25,324 --> 01:21:26,949
Stay there!

1124
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,116
Tambe...Gawde...

1125
01:21:38,366 --> 01:21:41,158
Sir, Sometimes I think I should've
just taken up a desk job at a bank.

1126
01:21:41,574 --> 01:21:45,324
After 5 pm, even if there's an
earthquake or a storm nobody cares.

1127
01:21:45,574 --> 01:21:47,574
And every holiday
is a bank holiday.

1128
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,283
And look at us.

1129
01:21:49,658 --> 01:21:51,491
On a Sunday also
we have to work.

1130
01:21:55,908 --> 01:21:57,116
What's taking you so long?

1131
01:22:01,408 --> 01:22:04,449
Look, there can be
two possibilities.

1132
01:22:04,533 --> 01:22:06,449
Who'll let me join a bank now?

1133
01:22:06,783 --> 01:22:07,824
In the case!

1134
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,408
Have you lost your mind?

1135
01:22:14,324 --> 01:22:16,116
If Chirag killed Shekhar...

1136
01:22:16,949 --> 01:22:17,911
Shekhar...

1137
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:19,324
Chirag! Get up.

1138
01:22:19,574 --> 01:22:21,366
Shekhar, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

1139
01:22:22,991 --> 01:22:24,449
Shekhar, leave him please.

1140
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:28,408
And if Vikram killed Shekhar...

1141
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:30,574
Let me go.

1142
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:38,074
Sir, we know for sure that Shekhar
came home at 7:30 that night.

1143
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:41,074
Yes, sir. I saw him... He
returned at around 7:30.

1144
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:42,908
He did come home at around 7:30

1145
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:44,491
only for a few minutes.

1146
01:22:44,658 --> 01:22:46,116
I didn't see Sir leave.

1147
01:22:46,241 --> 01:22:48,658
But no one knows whether
he left after that or not.

1148
01:22:53,616 --> 01:22:55,116
It's quite simple, Gautam.

1149
01:22:55,866 --> 01:22:57,408
If Shekhar didn't leave

1150
01:22:57,491 --> 01:23:00,116
then Maya and Chirag killed him.

1151
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:02,574
And if he did leave

1152
01:23:03,074 --> 01:23:04,741
then Vikram killed him.

1153
01:23:04,991 --> 01:23:06,783
But, how will we know that?

1154
01:23:13,616 --> 01:23:15,616
What is this? What
have you done?

1155
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,449
You should've wiped
your shoe first.

1156
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:18,741
Sorry, sir.

1157
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:32,991
-Ma'am, case 1147.
-One minute, sir.

1158
01:23:33,366 --> 01:23:35,199
Shekhar Sinha murder case.

1159
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:42,783
-Did anyone tamper with the evidence?
-No, sir.

1160
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:50,158
What's wrong, sir?

1161
01:23:51,116 --> 01:23:54,074
The night of the murder... What
time did it start raining?

1162
01:23:54,408 --> 01:23:56,449
-Raining...
-Around 11 pm, sir.

1163
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:57,824
I had gone to see a movie

1164
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,074
and, as I got out of the
movie it started raining.

1165
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:02,616
But, what has the rain got
to do with the murder?

1166
01:24:02,824 --> 01:24:04,533
If Maya's telling the truth

1167
01:24:04,783 --> 01:24:07,533
and that night Shekhar
arrived after 12 o'clock

1168
01:24:08,408 --> 01:24:11,616
then, there should've
been mud on his shoes.

1169
01:24:19,408 --> 01:24:20,533
Exactly.

1170
01:24:26,824 --> 01:24:27,991
<i>It was love.</i>

1171
01:24:31,949 --> 01:24:35,241
<i>Because of Laila Majnu's plan, our
Romeo was going to get framed</i>

1172
01:24:36,616 --> 01:24:39,824
<i>Maya and Chirag killed Shekhar
before Vikram got there.</i>

1173
01:24:45,824 --> 01:24:47,324
I didn't kill Shekhar.

1174
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:49,991
<i>It was a crime of passion.</i>

1175
01:24:58,449 --> 01:25:01,491
<i>Coincidently, the house
Vikram chose to save himself</i>

1176
01:25:01,949 --> 01:25:03,033
Excuse me.

1177
01:25:03,116 --> 01:25:04,074
<i>was going to get him entrapped.</i>

1178
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:05,949
Please, can I make
one phone call?

1179
01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:09,366
<i>And Vikram Sethi is suspected
to have killed her.</i>

1180
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:11,116
<i>As soon as Maya
found out that...</i>

1181
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,241
Have a drink...

1182
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:14,949
I wish Shekhar was
more like you.

1183
01:25:15,074 --> 01:25:19,366
<i>the police are looking for Vikram in
connection for Katherine's murder...</i>

1184
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:20,366
Player on.

1185
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:26,866
<i>she cunningly pinned Shekhar's
murder on him as well.</i>

1186
01:25:26,949 --> 01:25:29,241
Maya, the police are downstairs.
Go get them.

1187
01:25:37,574 --> 01:25:39,366
<i>It was a good plan.</i>

1188
01:25:42,574 --> 01:25:44,033
<i>But it failed.</i>

1189
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:47,658
<i>Too bad.</i>

1190
01:26:00,949 --> 01:26:02,574
It was Chirag and Maya.

1191
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:09,574
And Katherine...

1192
01:26:11,616 --> 01:26:13,033
She died of a heart-attack.

1193
01:26:17,866 --> 01:26:19,783
Your paperwork's being processed

1194
01:26:20,033 --> 01:26:21,783
this will all be over soon.

1195
01:26:25,033 --> 01:26:26,033
No, Dev.

1196
01:26:29,574 --> 01:26:30,449
I killed her.

1197
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:42,283
I shouldn't have left
her alone that night.

1198
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:48,658
I should I have
been that with her.

1199
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,866
Shouldn't have left her alone.

1200
01:27:07,283 --> 01:27:08,991
You know my younger brother Aman

1201
01:27:11,783 --> 01:27:14,241
he loved riding bikes.

1202
01:27:16,033 --> 01:27:17,991
I would teach him
how to ride a bike

1203
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,866
without telling our father.

1204
01:27:23,283 --> 01:27:24,574
Then one day...

1205
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,824
I let him take the
bike out alone.

1206
01:27:30,783 --> 01:27:32,824
He met with an accident
and I lost him.

1207
01:27:38,783 --> 01:27:42,158
For years I kept blaming myself.

1208
01:27:43,783 --> 01:27:47,033
I wish I had listened
to my father!

1209
01:27:48,574 --> 01:27:52,199
I wish...I had never taught him.

1210
01:27:54,908 --> 01:27:56,366
But, do you know what, Vikram?

1211
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:00,866
Blaming yourself only
adds to the pain.

1212
01:28:01,324 --> 01:28:02,533
it doesn't lessen it.

1213
01:28:04,783 --> 01:28:06,158
If you really want to
remember something

1214
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:08,574
then, remember the times
you spent together

1215
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,408
and not when you lost her.

1216
01:28:12,116 --> 01:28:12,949
You know.

1217
01:28:24,324 --> 01:28:25,991
And these are your belongings.

1218
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:32,783
What about Katherine's...

1219
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,866
That will take a couple of days.

1220
01:28:35,033 --> 01:28:38,491
No-no...don't worry.
It'll be done today.

1221
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:42,783
Thanks, Dev.

1222
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:46,533
Thank you.

1223
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,074
Dev...

1224
01:29:58,491 --> 01:30:00,033
Come, Dev. Dinner's served.

1225
01:30:00,366 --> 01:30:01,408
Just a minute.

1226
01:30:07,283 --> 01:30:10,574
Looks like someone else has
also become Vikram's fan.

1227
01:30:11,074 --> 01:30:12,074
Babes, honestly.

1228
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:14,449
I just don't understand how
you guys read this stuff.

1229
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:16,866
I've been stuck on one page
for the last 30 minutes.

1230
01:30:17,783 --> 01:30:20,491
You are just too slow.

1231
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,908
You took three days
to release my Vikram.

1232
01:30:25,158 --> 01:30:26,283
'My'.

1233
01:30:28,866 --> 01:30:29,991
Come for dinner.

1234
01:30:33,866 --> 01:30:36,449
Remember when we went
to see 'Gupt' film.

1235
01:30:37,033 --> 01:30:38,241
And right after we
bought the ticket

1236
01:30:38,324 --> 01:30:40,491
you told me who the killer was.

1237
01:30:41,033 --> 01:30:42,158
Remember?

1238
01:30:42,283 --> 01:30:43,991
It's a good thing I
am not like that.

1239
01:30:44,283 --> 01:30:46,033
I am not going to tell you that

1240
01:30:46,116 --> 01:30:49,158
the hero of this book
dies of a drug overdose.

1241
01:30:50,908 --> 01:30:51,949
Sorry.

1242
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,033
-Arpit.
-Yes sir.

1243
01:31:38,116 --> 01:31:40,158
In Katherine Sethi's post mortem

1244
01:31:40,699 --> 01:31:42,324
did we check for an overdose?

1245
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:44,824
No, sir. There was
no reason for it.

1246
01:31:44,908 --> 01:31:46,283
-She died of a heart attack.
-I know.

1247
01:31:46,366 --> 01:31:48,658
-I know, but did we check?
-Sir, I am sure.

1248
01:31:48,949 --> 01:31:50,033
Natural causes.

1249
01:31:52,949 --> 01:31:54,158
She was...

1250
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:56,449
She was taking some kind
of medication, right?

1251
01:31:56,533 --> 01:31:57,908
For a genetic heart disorder.

1252
01:31:58,699 --> 01:32:00,991
She had been taking this
pill since she was a child.

1253
01:32:01,283 --> 01:32:02,408
One pill a day.

1254
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,283
So it is possible that

1255
01:32:06,574 --> 01:32:07,991
that Katherine died from
an overdose of this pill?

1256
01:32:08,116 --> 01:32:10,158
Not possible in
Katherine's case, sir.

1257
01:32:10,408 --> 01:32:13,491
I checked. Look here.

1258
01:32:14,324 --> 01:32:16,033
The date of purchase is
mentioned on the bill.

1259
01:32:16,324 --> 01:32:17,533
I counted the number of pills.

1260
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,866
And Katherine took
only one pill a day.

1261
01:32:19,949 --> 01:32:20,908
As prescribed.

1262
01:32:23,241 --> 01:32:24,449
What's wrong, sir?

1263
01:32:29,033 --> 01:32:30,991
Maybe I am just over-analyzing.

1264
01:32:31,991 --> 01:32:33,741
I was reading Vikram
Sethi's book...

1265
01:32:34,324 --> 01:32:35,491
Doesn't matter...

1266
01:32:36,324 --> 01:32:37,783
-Oops, I am sorry.
-It's okay, sir.

1267
01:32:37,866 --> 01:32:38,949
I'll do it.

1268
01:33:02,074 --> 01:33:05,158
Sir, this pill contains almost
3 times the normal dose.

1269
01:33:34,449 --> 01:33:36,574
<i>Katherine had a minor heart
problem since she was a child.</i>

1270
01:33:37,074 --> 01:33:39,908
<i>In the last few days, she
had too much exertion.</i>

1271
01:33:40,033 --> 01:33:41,699
<i>I told her to rest.</i>

1272
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:44,283
<i>Katherine was a
wonderful person, sir.</i>

1273
01:33:44,824 --> 01:33:46,491
<i>I owe her everything.</i>

1274
01:33:56,658 --> 01:33:59,533
Gautam, listen to me carefully.

1275
01:34:00,033 --> 01:34:02,658
Vikram is on a Jet Airways
flight tonight to London.

1276
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:08,866
Do whatever you have to do but
stop that flight, Gautam!

1277
01:34:08,949 --> 01:34:11,449
You hear me. Stop
the fu*** flight.

1278
01:34:30,033 --> 01:34:32,199
What happened Gautam... Are
they stopping the flight?

1279
01:34:32,449 --> 01:34:33,324
Why?

1280
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:35,699
Is someone trying to run?

1281
01:34:36,199 --> 01:34:37,824
I know you killed her, Vikram.

1282
01:34:37,949 --> 01:34:39,949
But I already told you that.
Remember...

1283
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:43,533
"No Dev, I killed her."

1284
01:34:45,158 --> 01:34:47,699
I was really emotional,
and so were you.

1285
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:48,699
And, in that emotional moment

1286
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:51,074
you told me about
your brother Aman.

1287
01:34:51,783 --> 01:34:53,158
I felt a real connection.

1288
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:55,491
You know what

1289
01:34:56,199 --> 01:34:57,949
even I want to tell
you how my wife died.

1290
01:34:58,033 --> 01:34:59,033
You killed her because

1291
01:34:59,116 --> 01:35:01,241
she was going to cancel
your book release.

1292
01:35:01,741 --> 01:35:04,658
It wasn't just that, Dev...
she was threatening me also.

1293
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:07,158
It's only two days away, you
can't cancel the book launch.

1294
01:35:07,241 --> 01:35:08,953
I can't...but you can.

1295
01:35:09,033 --> 01:35:10,074
All I did was leak a name...

1296
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:12,824
Either that or I'll tell everyone
that you leaked her name.

1297
01:35:12,908 --> 01:35:14,283
She was going to
get me arrested.

1298
01:35:14,366 --> 01:35:16,866
-You know they will put me
to jail for that? -Yes.

1299
01:35:17,324 --> 01:35:19,033
It's about time you
paid for your sins.

1300
01:35:20,033 --> 01:35:21,658
Now if your wife had
threatened you like that...

1301
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:22,574
What would you have done...

1302
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:25,324
Yeah...exactly...
That's what I did.

1303
01:35:25,533 --> 01:35:26,699
I was forced to kill her.

1304
01:35:31,824 --> 01:35:33,449
Do you know how much it hurt me?

1305
01:35:33,783 --> 01:35:36,241
I was almost in tears

1306
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:41,408
but then Katherine's got
a message on her phone.

1307
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:46,953
I realized that
Shekhar and Katherine

1308
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:48,949
were planning this
for a long time.

1309
01:35:49,449 --> 01:35:53,033
My sweetheart wife and that
over-enthusiastic lawyer

1310
01:35:53,574 --> 01:35:55,033
were going to file
a case against me.

1311
01:35:57,616 --> 01:35:59,033
They had to be stopped.

1312
01:36:07,324 --> 01:36:09,366
Hello. Did you enjoy your stay?

1313
01:36:09,741 --> 01:36:10,824
Yes...

1314
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:13,199
In fact, for a moment I thought
I will never be able to leave.

1315
01:36:15,949 --> 01:36:17,199
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1316
01:36:18,533 --> 01:36:19,866
So, where was I?

1317
01:36:22,283 --> 01:36:24,158
Next, I arrived at
Shekhar's house.

1318
01:36:25,408 --> 01:36:26,994
I'm sure Maya must have
told you the rest.

1319
01:36:27,074 --> 01:36:28,994
<i>Someone who can kill his wife</i>

1320
01:36:29,074 --> 01:36:31,449
<i>won't hesitate to
kill a stranger.</i>

1321
01:36:31,533 --> 01:36:33,033
<i>Shekhar returned at
around 12 o'clock.</i>

1322
01:36:33,116 --> 01:36:35,866
-Poor girl was telling the truth.
-'I didn't kill Shekhar.'

1323
01:36:36,449 --> 01:36:38,033
I didn't find Shekhar, but

1324
01:36:38,783 --> 01:36:40,241
when I was looking
for the papers,

1325
01:36:41,241 --> 01:36:42,491
I found something else.

1326
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:51,491
And you knew Maya would
try to hide her affair.

1327
01:36:51,574 --> 01:36:54,741
You're really not that stupid...
just a little slow.

1328
01:36:55,908 --> 01:36:57,199
I think it's the age.

1329
01:37:06,074 --> 01:37:07,116
Mumbai Police.

1330
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:08,824
What's the status of
your London flight?

1331
01:37:08,908 --> 01:37:11,199
-The flight is about to leave the gate.
-Which gate?

1332
01:37:11,366 --> 01:37:12,324
Gate 51.

1333
01:37:12,741 --> 01:37:14,033
Call them, stop the flight.

1334
01:37:21,991 --> 01:37:25,491
After that I...killed Shekhar.

1335
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:55,199
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1336
01:37:56,574 --> 01:37:58,116
And then I made up a story.

1337
01:37:58,199 --> 01:37:59,866
But, ever since I
entered that house

1338
01:37:59,949 --> 01:38:01,324
I had this weird feeling...
something wasn't right

1339
01:38:01,408 --> 01:38:03,199
I didn't have any
reason to be aggressive

1340
01:38:03,658 --> 01:38:04,994
in fact she was very friendly.

1341
01:38:05,074 --> 01:38:06,908
There was someone else
there that night.

1342
01:38:10,366 --> 01:38:11,491
Yes, sir...

1343
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,324
My greatest ever, I think.

1344
01:38:15,033 --> 01:38:18,074
But every story needs a twist.

1345
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,324
The night of the murder... What
time did it start raining?

1346
01:38:21,616 --> 01:38:22,991
<i>Around 11 pm, sir.</i>

1347
01:38:23,533 --> 01:38:26,033
'There should've been mud
on Shekhar's shoes.'

1348
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,241
I am closer than
you think, Vikram.

1349
01:38:39,824 --> 01:38:42,324
Seat no. 1A.

1350
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:44,908
Come and get me.

1351
01:38:45,074 --> 01:38:48,408
But the UK Government won't let you
touch me without solid evidence.

1352
01:38:49,366 --> 01:38:51,949
And, all thanks to you I got rid
of the biggest piece of evidence.

1353
01:38:53,116 --> 01:38:54,116
You know what, Dev?

1354
01:38:54,533 --> 01:38:55,991
But don't blame yourself.

1355
01:38:56,908 --> 01:38:59,033
Blaming yourself only
adds to the pain.

1356
01:38:59,949 --> 01:39:01,033
It doesn't lessen it.

1357
01:39:02,616 --> 01:39:04,199
And if you really want
to remember something

1358
01:39:04,991 --> 01:39:07,533
then remember of all the
times we spent together.

1359
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:09,408
And not the times we are apart.

1360
01:39:12,908 --> 01:39:16,116
Bye, Dev. It was
lovely meeting you.

1361
01:39:28,283 --> 01:39:29,616
<i>...this is your
captain speaking.</i>

1362
01:39:29,699 --> 01:39:32,574
<i>The ground staff has just informed
us about a slight hold up.</i>

1363
01:39:32,824 --> 01:39:35,949
<i>I think it shouldn't be long
before we get on our way...</i>

1364
01:40:03,283 --> 01:40:04,741
Stop the flight!

1365
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:06,408
Stop the flight!

1366
01:40:06,491 --> 01:40:07,533
Sir, the gate is closed.

1367
01:40:07,741 --> 01:40:10,116
The flight is on the run way
and taxing for take off

1368
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:37,074
<i>Some use the truth
to their advantage</i>

1369
01:40:37,403 --> 01:40:38,824
<i>while some lie.</i>

1370
01:40:40,474 --> 01:40:42,033
<i>But I used coincidence.</i>
