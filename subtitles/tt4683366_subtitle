1
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,072
Ajay..

2
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,202
If you think you have been wronged..

3
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,544
Then <i>lwill</i> help you getjustice.

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,705
Stop worming about getting
mejustice, inspector.

5
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,514
And use all your police
force in protecting him.

6
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,051
But he won't live. <i>lwill</i> kill him.

7
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,190
I'll kill him today itself.

8
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,228
Whenever law will murder justice"

9
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,260
A new Ajay will be born.

10
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,125
Excuse me, sir..

11
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,592
Instead of sewing
such ajudicial system..

12
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,468
I would rather like supporting Ajay.

13
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,514
'After going through all
the aspects of this case..'

14
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:24,419
'..the court dismisses all other
charges made on the accused Ajay..'

15
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,584
'..finds him guilty
only under section 302..'

16
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,427
'..and sentences him
14 years of imprisonment.'

17
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,518
Milk helps you make a cup of coffee.

18
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,186
Milk helps you make cottage cheese.

19
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,659
Similarly, seven musical notes
help you make music.

20
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,760
Hey, what are you?

21
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,504
Tell me, is it necessaw to say
'Aayo' and 'Aito' evew time?

22
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,364
You are late, Kishore.

23
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,403
I had gone to look for
jewelq/ for Munni today.

24
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,042
We should buy some
now that we have the money.

25
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,180
If we start collecting now..

26
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,334
Father, why did you throw this here?

27
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,741
You should always
throw it in the dustbin.

28
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,270
You know that, right?

29
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,143
Sony.

30
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,141
Grandpa, you won't forget
the password this time, right?

31
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:07,707
No, I won't.

32
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,146
"Nanacool."

33
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,484
"Nanacool?"

34
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,246
So I am cool?

35
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,990
So then, I can attend the party.

36
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,025
But there is an age limit.

37
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,288
I mean couple entq/ is compulsow.

38
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,661
I will be going with Anushka.

39
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,725
So do you have anyone to go with you?

40
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,093
With me...?
- Grandpa!

41
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,160
Yes?
- Don't shut down my machines.

42
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,605
My project files are rendering. Okay?

43
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,199
Yes. You will surely
win this competition.

44
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,266
Thank you.

45
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,505
Let's go.
- Shall we? - Let's go.

46
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,307
Bye, grandpa.
. Bye, grandpa.

47
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,642
Love you. - Bye.

48
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,545
Bye-bye.
- Let's go.

49
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,513
Bye.

50
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,780
Grandpa, Varun's grandma is single.

51
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:44,612
You want me to hook you up with her?

52
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,714
Imp! You will hook me up?

53
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,122
Varun!

54
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,492
Varun!

55
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,322
Varun! Can't you hear me?

56
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,122
The parties these
kids attend these days"

57
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,300
"are just leading them
astray from their religion.

58
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,531
He is my son. He will have
fun but he won't go astray.

59
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,268
Yes, of course. I know even/thing.

60
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,537
Varun, you can break a few rules.

61
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,113
But never break our trust.
- Sure.

62
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,148
Here the key??
- Sure.

63
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,310
Brother" Say hi to Zoya.

64
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,021
Zoya? Are you there?

65
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,625
Zoya.

66
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,594
I am asking you something.
- No, mom.

67
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,223
So irresponsible.

68
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,193
Did he call?
- Yes, he did.

69
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,702
What did he say?

70
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,104
Zoya? I am asking you something, Zoya.

71
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,270
Zoya.

72
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,778
Listen mom,
you have Zack's number, right?

73
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,281
Call him.
And ask all this crap yourself.

74
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,374
Okay, dear.

75
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,313
Now come on the camera.

76
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,615
Let me see your sweet face..

77
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,451
Before the flight takes off.

78
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,487
It's weird, mom.

79
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,493
What's weird?

80
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,327
We stay in the same house
but still we chat over Skype.

81
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,698
Come on, Zoya. Now don't begin
with the whole thing all over again.

82
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,597
You too must be wondering,
my mom and dad are never togethen.

83
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,505
Then how did I come into this world?

84
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,539
Come on, Zoya.

85
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,305
Yes, I got downloaded
into their life by mistake.

86
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,640
Am <i>l</i> right, skype?

87
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,175
Let's go. Bye.

88
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,085
Go easy with the butter, Joe.

89
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,118
It's butter chicken, darling.

90
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,282
I cannot change the recipe.

91
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,758
Too much butter will kill you.

92
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,528
The thing I love cannot kill me.

93
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:40,033
Neither this, nor this and nor this.

94
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,005
So I am come last, huh?

95
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,041
Last but not the least.

96
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,203
Listen"

97
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,307
I want to go to Nanded.

98
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,740
I want you to come with me.

99
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,210
For along drive.

100
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,044
For your RTR?

101
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,710
No.

102
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:03,357
"Come, let me take you.."
- No Joe, I have to finish this.

103
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,023
"To a new world.."
- No.

104
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,728
Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

105
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:12,962
Good evening, sir.

106
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,527
Good evening.

107
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,506
A sensational movement
for women's security and respect.

108
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,100
Change it.
- But sir..

109
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,341
Good evening, sir.

110
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,569
Good evening.

111
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,338
Good evening, sir.

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,310
Good evening.

113
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,516
You have seen our
newspaper's logo, right?

114
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,747
Yes. But even/thing
written in it is true.

115
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,422
Then why do you need
to use words like sensational.

116
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,659
Such words give more weight
to lies and not the truth.

117
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,125
D.C.P. Ashraf..

118
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,999
Okay. Thank you, Raman.

119
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,562
Oh God.
- Of course.

120
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:54,269
Mr. Rajguru,
Ashraf is going to create a problem.

121
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,581
He will approach the
media and cause a problem.

122
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,080
Mr. Sinha, you worw unnecessarily.

123
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,555
It will be an issue
if Herald makes it.

124
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,989
But the Herald is with you.

125
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,385
Let's go.
- Come on.

126
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,125
Come on.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,193
Mr. Sinha..

128
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,301
Girls from small
town want to go ahead"

129
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,032
But they don't know how to walk.

130
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,734
You are right, sir. You are absolutely right.
- No, let's go.

131
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,977
Come on. Let's have same fun.
- Cheers!

132
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,118
Why are you all clapping for me?

133
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,127
It's a prayer.

134
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,998
Ananya, why don't you
tell them the meaning?

135
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,328
It means: oh God,
please guide us"

136
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,628
From untruth to truth.

137
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,040
From darkness to light.

138
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,108
From death to eternity.

139
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,232
Let there be peace all over.

140
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,210
Right, grandma?
- Yes, dear.

141
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,007
You are absolutely right.
- Okay, okay. Attention even/one.

142
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,378
Lights off.

143
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,662
Come, come, come.

144
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,364
Blow, blow, blow.

145
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,537
Once more.
- Happy birthday to you.

146
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,510
To papa..
- Happy birthday dear Ananya.

147
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,786
Now to grandma.

148
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,661
Actually, C.M. had kept
an urgent meeting in Delhi.

149
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,426
I said, it's my daughter's
birthday sol need to be there.

150
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,401
Actually, my kids had come
to meet the film stars and cricketers.

151
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,834
You didn't invite them?

152
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:04,205
My Ananya knows that you
get happiness when you share them.

153
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,741
Look how she is sharing happiness.

154
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,105
"With the kids from our foundation.
- Come on.

155
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,509
Nice. Wow.

156
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,227
Nayar has been twing to hack
into our system since afternoon.

157
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,596
He doesn't know that all
his data is being downloaded.

158
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,091
You keep playing with Nayar.

159
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,336
Look, I have done myjob.

160
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,340
Sir..

161
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,048
Your swing is too stiff, dad.
- It slipped.

162
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,052
But I have the perfect
thing to loosen you up.

163
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,280
Check this out.

164
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,815
Good night, dad.

165
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,725
What is it?

166
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,524
From the telecom ministq/'s sewer
they got tomorrow's bid's document.

167
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,029
We got the tender, Kaka Sahib.

168
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,330
Anything that belongs to
the government, belongs to you.

169
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,095
Why did you need to hack into it?

170
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,663
This is Kabir's first
independent project.

171
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,670
And as you know,
if wants something, he gets it.

172
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,670
Right here, right now.

173
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,609
- Hey bro, what's up!

174
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,209
Good to see you.
- Join the party.

175
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,652
I've been working on this
music for the past few days.

176
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,260
Hello, beautiful.
- Hey.

177
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,519
Whoa!

178
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,089
Hey, yo!

179
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,279
'Phoolchand Mehra, the second.'

180
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,782
'If we have a son,
we will name him Phoolchand Mehra.'

181
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,388
It was my grandfather's name.

182
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,580
I don't like it.

183
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,618
But I love it.

184
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:03,692
Why?

185
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,625
No way.

186
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,694
How about.

187
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,589
Tu karam Gan pat Rao.

188
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,598
No way.

189
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,998
No.

190
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,630
Ajay Mehra's son will
be called Phoolchand Mehra.

191
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,141
I had promised my dad.

192
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,302
'Varsha is dead!'

193
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,609
'Her son is also dead!'

194
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,308
'They died because of you.'

195
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,442
'I wanted to talk about
something important.'

196
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,118
'Are you listening Ajay.'

197
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,018
'I am worried.'

198
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,081
'Balwant Rai.'

199
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,281
'Is anybody listening?'

200
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,092
'They killed my brother.'

201
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,055
'Is anyone listening?'

202
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:19,292
Ajay, the medicine is
right in front of you and you...!

203
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,232
Take it.

204
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,039
Stop playing with your memories, Ajay.

205
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,282
These moments that you tq/
to recall with your dear ones..

206
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,123
Just stop it!

207
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,986
The nightmares that come with them
will take you somewhere from where..

208
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,164
...no neurologist will be able
to bring you back, let alone me.

209
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:31,074
You know that your life
isn't just yours anymore, right?

210
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,612
You killed her, right? Confess it.

211
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,123
You raped her. Confess it.

212
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,681
You did it, right? Tell me.

213
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,527
I killed her.

214
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,097
I killed her.

215
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,749
Good morning, sir.

216
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,349
Good morning.

217
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,696
Ajay, he is Inspector Pawar.

218
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,512
Sir, this is the letter.

219
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,032
You have to do it tomorrow.

220
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,533
I've already committed.
Tw to understand.

221
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,977
Mr. Mehra, Mr. Rajguru
is waiting for you.

222
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,341
Please come.

223
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,283
Come in, sir.

224
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,214
Mr. Mehra..

225
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,480
Hi.

226
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,492
What brings you here?

227
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,338
Lokesh, all clear?
- All clear, sir.

228
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,616
Have a nice day.

229
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,246
You too, sir.

230
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,264
Akshay, clear?

231
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,202
Yup, all clear.

232
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,336
Wait. Let the car pass.

233
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,527
Can't you see?

234
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,097
Let's go. Let's go.

235
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,073
Ajay Mehra, you bastard!

236
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,706
You bastard!

237
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,607
Who the hell do you think you are?

238
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,146
You want to mess with me?

239
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,614
With Aditya Rajguru?

240
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,549
You will mess with the Daily Herald?

241
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,322
After a few exposés,
you think you are someone great?

242
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,220
You think you are a media mogul?

243
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,658
These RTA activists,
retired police officers.

244
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,218
You think you can challenge
me with the help of these clowns?

245
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,025
You wanna mess with me! You...

246
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,816
Your mother is a woman.

247
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,581
Your wife is a woman.

248
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,216
A daughten.

249
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,284
A sisten.

250
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,298
Do you recognize her?

251
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,771
Read it.

252
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,121
'Papa, I thought...'

253
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:24,350
'...l'll come to Mumbai,
get ajob and support you.'

254
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,324
I'll become ajournalist and be the
voice of all the girls in this countw.

255
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,559
But my boss Aditya Rajguru..

256
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,332
'...who is exactly your age.'

257
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,373
Killed my voice.

258
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,178
'He took advantage of my trust.'

259
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,554
'He raped...'

260
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,626
'I don't want to live anymore, papa.'

261
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:18,215
'How will I ever face you,
or my fiancé Shrikant?'

262
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,444
'I am sorry, P3P3-'

263
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,282
'Please forgive me.'

264
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,194
What does this prove?

265
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,162
I didn't kill her.

266
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,216
Docton.

267
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,528
Between a rapist and
an innocent boy's DNA..

268
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,396
There is a difference, right?

269
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,562
Sorw, sir.

270
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,230
Please forgive me.

271
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,236
The three suspects of
reporter Renu Sharma's rape.

272
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,876
First: The owner of the Daily Herald,
the rapist, Aditya Rajguru.

273
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,048
The entire countw is shocked by the shameful
deed of such high-profiled socialites.

274
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,208
<i>Dr. Poonawala.</i>

275
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,716
Instead of Rajguru's DNA sample...

276
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,588
...he presented Renu's
boyfriend Srikanfs sample.

277
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,748
...and made a false report.

278
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,289
Police commissioner Saurabh Sinha.
He destroyed all the evidences.

279
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,056
He tortured SrikanL.

280
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,390
And forced him to confess.

281
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,329
That he raped Renu Sharma.

282
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:46,199
S.l. Pawar was instrumental in
Ajay Mehra's unraveling of the case.

283
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,464
This is the biggest and most Sensational
expose done by Mr. Ajay Mehra.

284
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,338
He had torn the suicide note
on being pressurized by his seniors.

285
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,570
But later S.l. Pawar realized"

286
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,238
That he too has a daughter.

287
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,042
Ajay Mehra has done it again.

288
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,081
How does he do it time and again?
- May Ajay Mehra Iivelong.

289
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,379
We will disclose this secret in some time.
- So that our daughters stay safe.

290
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,422
This was Mumbai police'sjob,
but Ajay Mehra did it.

291
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,650
Ajay Mehra should also be in Delhi.

292
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,714
Only then will our girls be safe.

293
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,519
I will regain the trust
people have lost in Mumbai police.

294
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,620
'We used to give sleepless nights...

295
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,688
...and now Ajay Mehra
has done the same to us.'

296
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,428
'Our boss has been arrested...'

297
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,562
'...but keep listening
to Radio Herald uninterrupted.'

298
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,571
The market today opened
with Herald shares.

299
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,507
"Taking a 47% dip in the value.

300
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,301
Experts are predicting
a further fall ahead.

301
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,504
That's great.

302
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,139
Dad, Herald media group is now ours.

303
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,250
That's good, Kabir.

304
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,753
Wow!
Butter chicken!

305
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,032
Ajay Mehra...

306
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,368
That's why you are my
favorite doctor, Ms. Riya.

307
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,377
Because you know how
to keep your patients happy.

308
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,103
Well done, my boy.

309
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,341
JOe!

310
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,581
What are you doing?

311
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,381
Meet them.

312
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,188
Hello.
- Hello.

313
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,382
Hi, dear.

314
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,391
Ajay! I am feeling so proud of you.

315
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,484
Come, come, come.

316
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,124
Evew woman in this world
must be praying for you today.

317
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,266
Wonderful.

318
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,231
Let him eat.

319
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,401
It's okay to have it sometimes.

320
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,432
Sometimes?

321
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,604
He eats it evew day.

322
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,476
Hey!

323
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,277
Sir, what's the progress
of Nanded's case?

324
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,641
Did RTA reply?

325
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,378
Yes.

326
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,418
I had to go there as well.

327
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,317
I asked the principal to come along"

328
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,293
...we would work as
well as romance a little.

329
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,727
Romance?
- So?

330
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,521
Eat.

331
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,157
You should go with him.

332
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,696
Long drives, outings.

333
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,634
Don't listen to him, Riya.

334
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,701
He always has a hidden agenda.

335
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,605
Last time he took my friends
with him to Latur for an outing.

336
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,602
Once there, he parked the
car outside the collectorate.

337
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,172
...he gave us some
plank cards to hold..

338
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,618
"And asked us if we could
protest with him for a while.

339
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,548
I was so embarrassed.

340
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,420
What are you saying?
- Yeah.

341
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,524
Did you really do that?

342
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,687
I killed her.
- She is lying. - What?

343
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:31,157
I humbly asked them whether
they could protest for a while.

344
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,400
They rudely said "no"!

345
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,436
I said fine. - I won't let
anything happen to you. Trust me.

346
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,666
I killed her, mother.

347
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,333
I killed her.

348
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,178
As you can see Srikant
who was excruciated by the police..

349
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,079
"Has lost his mental balance
completely.

350
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,516
You can see that he is vew scared.

351
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,576
And that police has
tortured him a lot.

352
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,423
I killed her.
- You didn't do anything.

353
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,789
I killed her.

354
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,293
L.. I killed her.
- I am right here with you.

355
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,962
L.. I killed her.

356
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,496
L.. I killed her.

357
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,729

It's not electric shocks.

371
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,506
It's a therapy which
is vew important for him.

372
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,048
Look at Ajay.

373
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,656

Calm down.

384
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,244

386
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,026
Relax, Ajay.
- You are not Varsha.

387
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,757
Ward boys!
- You are not Varsha.

388
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,125

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,297
'I want to die.
I want to go to Varsha'

391
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,266
After the death of his wife and kids,
he turned suicidal.

392
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,075
But look at him now.

393
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,437
He is absolutely fine.

394
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,576
Srikanfs case is not that serious.

395
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,480
He will get well in a few months.

396
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:06,553
But he can get well
only when you and others.

397
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,683
"That is, his friends and
family behave positively with him.

398
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,686
We will need to give him a new aim.

399
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,428
When he will get a new aim,
his new life with begin.

400
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,470
What are you thinking?

401
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,644
Superintendent said that
my term here is coming to an end.

402
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:38,182
I will be released next year.

403
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,217
What will I do once I go outside?

404
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,594
The things which
others can't do, Ajay.

405
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:53,268
Not even/one has the strength
to endure and to fight as you do.

406
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,735
He is right, Ajay.

407
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,606
And when we are with
you then your aim is close by.

408
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,143
An aim..
- Ajay..

409
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,478
Why don't we get out of here
and help those who are helpless.

410
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,742
Alone..

411
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,542
And feel defeated by the system.

412
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,180
Ajay?

413
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,721

414
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,188

D'Souza sir's car was in it.

537
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:14,432
Sir, there were 8-10 more
people apart from Joe sir.

538
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:18,133
And the tanker driver
was also burnt to death.

539
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,340
Ajay, sister-in-law..

540
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,342
JOe!

541
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,510
JOe!

542
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,744
I want to see Joe.

543
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,414
0h, my God!

544
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,122
JOe!

545
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,589
Joe! No, Joe! No, Joe!

546
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,464
Joe! My Joe! I want to go..

547
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,129
Let mejust see him once.

548
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:53,141
Let me.. oh my God.
- 'An Accident on Mumbai-Pen Highway.'

549
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,474
We have got information
that 8-10 died in this accident.

550
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:00,004
Former deputy commissioner
and RTI activist.

551
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,507
'This incident.'
- Guys! Guys, he killed him.

552
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,545
Joe D'Souza!
- Who?

553
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,512
The RTI activist. Kabir shot him.

554
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,571
Shit, he killed him.

555
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:34,638
Shit.

556
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,448
I was watching this and suddenly the..
- What happened? - Look at this grandpa.

557
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,486
Raj Bansal.

558
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,388
And that's Kaka Sahib,
that's the home minister. - Shit.

559
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,551
I am going to blog this right now

560
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,593
No, Zoya.
- Why?

561
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,595
It will take only two seconds
to trace its IP address.

562
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:48,595
Exactly.
- Shit.

563
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,097
We should give it to the police.

564
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:50,723
Have you lost your mind?

565
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,160
The home minister himself
is involved in this.

566
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,167
Ajay Mehra.

567
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,170
We need to take this to Ajay Mehra.
- No!

568
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,767
No Ajay Mehra.
No!

569
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,666
No one will tell anything to anyone.

570
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,607
You guys don't know anything.

571
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:02,642
Come with me.

572
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,739
This is the biggest ever road
accident on Mumbai-Pen Highway so far.

573
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,575
8-10 people are believed
to have died in it.

574
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,380
What?

575
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,751
You saw that? - Former deputy
commissioner and RTI activist.

576
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,284
Are you getting it?

577
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:18,789
They turned a murder into an accident.

578
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,325
They killed 8-10 people.

579
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,325
These images might disturb you.
- Rohan, call up your father.

580
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,134
And ask him to come here immediately.

581
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,636
Yeah, my dad.

582
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:32,765
It's clear that the Pen Highway
accident in which our founder...

583
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,738
...and other 10 people died..

584
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,406
"Happened due to the
mistake of the tanker driver..

585
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,745
...and road department's mismanagement.
- Vew good.

586
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,411
Satyakam family prays
for Joe D'Souza and"

587
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,819
Mr. BansaL. good riddance.

588
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,353
Troy is just great.

589
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,792
He killed 11 people
along with D'Souza.

590
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,294
That made the accident
quite convincing.

591
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:01,029
And the way Satyakam confirmed it..

592
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,298
Now I am relaxed.

593
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,068
I am relaxed.
- Good night.

594
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,303
'You socialist rats!'

595
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,539
'Bloody anarchists!'

596
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,343
'What is your contribution
in this countq/'s growth?

597
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,644
'We are the ones who create wealth.'

598
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,309
'We are the ones
who provide employment.'

599
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,716
'We are the ones who
are feeling you all.'

600
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,550
'You always create hurdles for us.'

601
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,588
'All of you should die.'

602
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,351
'And lwill kill all ofyou.'

603
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,453
Where is papa?

604
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,430
Over there.

605
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,523
Ananya!
- Ananya!

606
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,262
Slow down, dear.

607
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,227
<i>Papa!</i>

608
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,502
Look at this, papa.

609
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,705
Mom got an award.
I, too, went on the stage.

610
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,577
Why didn't you come here?

611
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,214
Dear, I was. Prema..

612
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,618
Ananya, you have to
go to school in the morning.

613
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,349
Say good night to even/one.

614
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,220
Good night, papa.
- Good night.

615
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,688
Good night, grandma.
- Good night, dear.

616
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,994
Good night, mom.

617
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,424
Good night, Ananya.

618
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:06,491
What's wrong, son?
You look upset.

619
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:11,298
Nothing, mother.
lt'sjust.. You should go and rest.

620
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,245
What is wrong, Raj?

621
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:28,249
Actually, today, I realized that
the huge empire that my dad built..

622
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:34,796
...our legacy, our son
won't be able to take it ahead.

623
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,064
Why do you say that?

624
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,702
I wish you could
witness his anger today.

625
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,605
He shot a man today.
And the way he shot.

626
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,041
Shot? What do you mean?

627
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,339
What do you mean by shot?
He killed someone?

628
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,103
Yes.

629
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,409
But the murder has been taken care of.

630
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,541
What are you saying?
- But the murder has been taken care of.

631
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,051
I told you not to give him a gun.

632
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,212
This is not about the gun.
- I had told you..

633
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,050
Tomorrow he kills
someone with his can.

634
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,991
I will! I surely will!
- Please tq/ to understand.

635
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,661
I am shocked by the rage
with which he killed that man.

636
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,622
His attitude, his thoughts.

637
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,092
How will he run such a
big empire with so much anger?

638
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,159
We have failed as parents.

639
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,996
What kind of an upbringing
have you given him?

640
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,334
Me?
- Yes, you.

641
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,467
L..
- You are his mother.

642
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,704
You never let me be a mother, Raj.

643
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,239
I was just a nanny to your prince.

644
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:30,277
I gave birth to him,
but he got all his values from you.

645
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:35,388
You didn't stop him when he
insulted his elders or the sen/ants.

646
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,652
You gave him even/thing he wanted.

647
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,722
You made such a big
Bansal world for prince..

648
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,768
...that he thought that he has
a right to anything and even/thing.

649
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,602
You are responsible for it.

650
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,299
You have made him a..

651
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,469
You have made him a murderer.

652
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,449
This is even/thing?
- Yes. - Yes, dad.

653
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,648
There is nothing left behind with you?
- No.

654
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,088
You sure?
- Yes, sir.

655
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,148
Let's go.
- Uncle..

656
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,524
But what are you going to do?

657
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,660
Dear, you know that
I am a lawyer, right?

658
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,563
Yes.

659
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,228
I will do what you want to do.

660
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,332
But in my own way.

661
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,267
Another thing:

662
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,505
You won't mention this to anyone.

663
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,647
Promise?
- Yes, uncle.

664
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,547
Yes, uncle.
- Let's go. - Okay.

665
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,093
Doomed. Oh damn..

666
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,270
What a piece of crap!

667
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:04,173
This makes it look as if
we are killing him on purpose.

668
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,572
But it was not so.

669
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,548
Well done, Kaka Sahib.

670
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:12,610
You invited the vew person
I came hereto complain about.

671
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,622
Mr. D'Souza..

672
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:18,649
You've made a good name for
yourself with your RTI applications.

673
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,354
It's time to call it quits.

674
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,721
Now it's time to join
hands and move ahead.

675
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,057
Kaka Sahib,
how many times do I have to tell you..

676
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,099
I don't wear a uniform anymore.
I am retired.

677
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,235
Hence, I am no longer
forced to follow your orders.

678
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,509
I have instead gotten
into a habit of following up.

679
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,570
Look at this.

680
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:44,312
3452 families which you have ruined.

681
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:49,714
Rehabilitate their homes, farms
and animals and the problem is solved.

682
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,157
Mr. D'Souza..

683
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:56,061
We have given them the compensation
government has ordered us to.

684
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,101
You haven't given them anything,
you have fooled them.

685
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,261
In exchange of a mere compensation,

686
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,000
you've stolen the lands of those
illiterate poor people.

687
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,234
Come on, Mr. D'Souza.

688
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,967
People will get employment
because of the project.

689
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,012
If they don't die due
to stan/ation by then.

690
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,181
Even/thing that we did was
done with government approval.

691
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,548
Which government
are you talking about?

692
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,517
The government that
dances naked to your tunes?

693
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,184
How dare you talk to my father
like that, you rotten slave?

694
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,249
What did you say?

695
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,194
Leave me. - This is what
your father wants to make us.

696
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,424
Mr. D'Souza.
- Leave me.

697
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,591
The government too is your slave.
- Leave me.

698
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,566
Water, electricity, phone network"
- Leave me..

699
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,136
Even/thing belongs to you.
- Leave me or I'll kill you.

700
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,296
Even/thing belongs to your father.

701
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,601
The only thing left is
his image on the currency.

702
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,198
You are making this countm.

703
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,043
Now do you understand?

704
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,104
Yes. I completely understand.

705
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,179
You are not at fault, son.

706
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,781
It isjustified. Justified, he is.

707
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,054
Joe D'Souza is such a man that
this was bound to happen eventually.

708
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,216
Hence, I brought even/thing over here.

709
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:00,126
Mr. Kriplani, what do you mean to say?

710
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,021
That you have not
made any copies of it?

711
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,492
What? What are you saying?

712
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,558
You must have kept
one for safety sake.

713
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,263
You are accusing me.

714
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,135
You are a lawyer.

715
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,702
You are getting me wrong. l..

716
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,706
Look Mr. Raj, I am a corporate lawyer.

717
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,345
You know me. I did all this"

718
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,178
Kaka Sahib is making
an accusation on me.

719
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,115
Relax Kriplani.
- I did all this for you.

720
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,117
Relax.

721
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:28,321
He is just reassuring.
And I trust you.

722
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,153
And I appreciate your gesture.
- Thank you.

723
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,524
Vew shortly, you will receive
a call from my accounts department.

724
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:33,684
No.

725
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,988
Why are you taking it the wrong way?

726
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,362
Look, you are getting it all wrong.

727
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,128
I didn't do all this for the money.

728
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,261
Mr. Kriplani, control yourself.
No, no. Mr. Kriplani, please.

729
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,397
This is the reason I brought
all these things with me. - Calm down.

730
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,737
I spoke about the moneyjust
as a good gesture on our part.

731
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,169
No, I don't want any money.

732
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,506
You don't have to
worw about anything.

733
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,170
Please relax.
- Mr. Kriplani..

734
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:55,149
I hope you don't mind sharing a few
details of those four kids with us.

735
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,246
They won't utter a word
about this to anyone, sir.

736
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:00,220
Mr. Kriplani,
Troy is our security chief. - Okay.

737
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,018
It's just a regular security drill.

738
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,649
You don't need to feel scared.

739
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,627
Like you said, my son is
just like your own son.. - Absolutely.

740
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:10,096
Similarly,
your son is my life my own son.

741
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,427
Okay, relax.

742
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:12,565
Yeah?

743
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,035
Thank you.
Thank you vew much.

744
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:16,269
Thank you.

745
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:24,968
This gull--

746
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,646
He is too funny.

747
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,011
Kabir..

748
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,379
I'm damned"

749
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,251
Stop worming about your son.

750
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,518
We will have to stay alert now.

751
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,092
You know why no one
has ever touched D'Souza?

752
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,255
Because he had Ajay Mehra's support.

753
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,562
He is vew stubborn. You don't know
what kind of a person Ajay Mehra is.

754
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:50,034
Balwant Rai was once
where you are now.

755
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,630
He killed Ajay Mehra's brother.

756
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:57,611
The entire Mumbai police, D'Souza
and his men provided him security.

757
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,444
But no one was able
to stop Ajay Mehra.

758
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,541
He gave him 24 hours.

759
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,281
He went inside Balwant
Rai's house and shot him.

760
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:11,187
And he also killed all
those who were with him.

761
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,387
He killed all of them.

762
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,994
He is a crazy stubborn guy.

763
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,693
Mr. Bansal, he killed even/one.

764
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,961
Did you hear me?

765
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,166
You don't know what Ajay Mehra is.

766
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,207
Who is this Ajay Mehra?

767
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,211
I am thinking about my son
and you are talking about Ajay Mehra.

768
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,213
Who the hell is this Ajay Mehra?

769
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,016
'Why are you staring?'

770
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,415
'Honesty never dies.'

771
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:47,092
'When a corrupt person dies,
his rein ends.'

772
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:52,466
'But when an honest man dies,
his rein begins.'

773
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,135
'Satyakams never dies.'

774
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,541
Morning, mom. Morning, dad.
- Good morning.

775
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,640
See you in court.
- Sure, sir.

776
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:10,548
Morning.

777
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,685
Dad, what did you do with that video?

778
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,251
I mean what's the progress?

779
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,416
My friends were asking"

780
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,188
"as we haven't heard any
news about them getting arrested $0..

781
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,126
Eat this.
- Yes, I'll eat it.

782
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,195
So what's the progress, dad?

783
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,230
Rohan, the progress is
that I have made all of you safe.

784
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,170
Safe? - And I am sure, this
is what other parents wanted as well.

785
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,637
Aren't you getting late?
- Yes. Let's go.

786
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,641
Dad?

787
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,736
Dad! Dad, wait!

788
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,741
Rohan.. - But what
does making us safe mean?

789
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,677
I gave the video to the
ones to whom it belonged.

790
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,746
Kabir Bansal murdered Mr. D'Souza.

791
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:52,085
And you gave the evidence to him?

792
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,454
Rohan, it's"
- Dad.. dad, he is wrong.

793
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,725
What is wrong?

794
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,495
Is it wrong to be a father?

795
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,667
Is it wrong to save your family?

796
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,571
No, dad. But it wrong to
be scared of the wrong people.

797
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,402
And you are a lawyer!

798
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,440
You stand for truth and justice.

799
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,240
Truth and justice?

800
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,710
You know what is
truth and justice today?

801
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:18,547
Today truth and justice is Raj Bansal.

802
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:24,458
Raj Bansal,
today, is truth and justice!

803
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,622
He must be having
his own reasons, Rohan.

804
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,565
He must be genuinely
afraid of Mr. Bansal.

805
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,232
He's a powerful man.

806
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,734
Anushka is right, Rohan.

807
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,535
How is she right?

808
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,699
If a lawyer of his stature
cannot bring justice to someone"

809
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,373
...then how can a common man
hope for anything in this countw?

810
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,608
And our parents are so duplicitous.

811
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,172
They teach us one thing and
they do something just the opposite.

812
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,147
Pretending parents.
- What?

813
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,045
Pretending parents.

814
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,312
You are right, Zoya.

815
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,046
Pretending parents.

816
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,518
That day we should have
given that video to Ajay Mehra.

817
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,457
Then what are you waiting for?

818
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:00,051
I have taken a backup of that video.

819
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,529
Zoya? When? How did you do it?

820
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,665
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

821
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,772
He will now stay in the
militaq/ academy, mother.

822
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,572
L'm the one who spoilt him, so I'll be
the one who will get him back on track.

823
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,438
No.
- Call him again.

824
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,079
You have a problem bending
before your elders as well?

825
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,439
Touch her feet properly.

826
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,213
Go on.

827
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:05,421
Your manners help you
win the world and not your ego.

828
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,299
He is not answering it?

829
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,703
Yes, Zoya?

830
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,262
Hello, Alnoor sir..

831
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,329
Can I please speak to Ajay Mehra?

832
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,703
Any emergency?

833
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,210
Sir, Joe D'Souza didn't die
in an accident. He was murdered.

834
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,210
What?

835
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,247
And we have the evidence.
- Are you sure?

836
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,215
Yes, sir.
Can we please talk to Ajay Mehra?

837
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,479
Troy, kids have a copy of the evidence.
And they are going to Ajay Mehra.

838
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,419
Copy that.

839
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,582
Mr. Bansal, the kids
have the copy of the evidence.

840
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,252
And they have made
contact with Ajay Mehra.

841
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:41,528
Ajay..

842
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,592
There is an emergency.

843
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,403
Hello, Zoya..
- Sir! Ajay sir!

844
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,107
Raj BansaPs son,
Kabir Bansal murdered him.

845
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,342
We have the proof, sir.

846
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,042
What? Whose murder?

847
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,110
We went to Karnala bird
sanctuaw to make a documentaw.

848
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:11,023
One of our cameras captured
Kabir Bansal shooting at Joe D'Souza.

849
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,756
Our home minister Kaka Sahib and
Raj Bansal were also present there.

850
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,758
Do you know what you are saying?
Are you sure about it?

851
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,590
Yes, sir. We have the proof.

852
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,033
This incident took place
in a farmhouse in Karnala.

853
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:21,728
Where are you?

854
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,232
In college, sir.

855
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,130
Hello, sir, I am Rohan.

856
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,435
Rohan, do you know where my office is?

857
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,440
Yes, sir.
- Go there. I'm coming here.

Call Kaka Sahib and Kriplani as well.
- Yes, sir.

861
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,643
What's happening, Raj?

862
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,376
You had said that
even/thing would be fine.

863
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:36,516
What's going on? Tell me something.

864
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,450
Sheetal, please. - Ajay Mehra
is at Mt. Maw Church, Bandra.

865
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:39,509
Do whatever you have to do.

866
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,317
Just make sure that
Kabir stays unharmed.

867
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,085
I don't let any harm come to my son.
Don't worw, Sheetal. - Zoya is at Pedar Road.

868
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,454
And we are here.

869
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,221
Joshi, what are you waiting for?

870
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,660
You didn't call Kaka saheb?

871
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,355
Zoya has left ?

872
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,558
You can catch them here.
At Senapati Bapat Road.

873

I'll get the kids.
- Get them.

875
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,214
Yes, Mr. Bansal?

Income tax, sen/ice tax,
IT cell, narcotics department.

877
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:21,255
Use all the departments
and seize Ajay Mehra's office..

00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,060
...his press and all his properties,
Immediately.

879
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,197
Why? What happened?

00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,496
Another copy of that
video has showed up.

881
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,230
The kids are going
to give it to Ajay Mehra.

882
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,294
Why are you putting me in a fix?

883
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,396
Just shut up.

884
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,339
Just do as I say.

885
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,450
Kriplani,
if you had given me all the copies.

886
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,712
...then which copy are the
kids going to give to Ajay Mehra?

887
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,048
There is no other copy of it,
Mr. Bansal.

888
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,214
Are you playing with me?
- No, not at all.

889
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,554
Stop your son,
or else I will kill him.

890
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:51,614
No!

Sir, Rohan is not
taking Kriplani's call.

898

Troy, you need to be faster.

00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,027
Your dad is calling.
- Don't answer it.

902
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,691
Sir, there is only a distance of
800 yards between Troy and the kids.

903
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,098
Yes, Kriplani?

904
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,226
Hello, Kulkarni?

Rohan is not answering my phone.
- What happened?

907
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,638
They have made a copy of that video.

908
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,107
The kids are going to give
it to Ajay Mehra. - A copy?

909
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:41,733
To Ajay Mehra?

910
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,410
Call her up right away,
or all of them will die.

911
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,378
They have taken a left

Hello, grandpa?
- What have you done!

914
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,085
From where did you get that copy?

915
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,558
You are going to give
that copy to Ajay Mehra?

916
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,095
You won't give that
copy to Ajay Mehra.

917
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,564
You will instead go straight
to Kriplani's house.

918
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,564
Okay, grandPa-

919
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,225

00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,560
What happened?
- He is furious.

921
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,140
He has told me not to go
to Ajay Mehra with the hard drive.

922
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:15,540
200 yards"

923
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,680
I don't get one thing,
how did he learn that..

924
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,613
...we are going to Ajay
Mehra with the hard disk?

925
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:25,043
Obviously,
Bansal is tapping our phones.

926
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,315
What?
- How else would he know?

927

100 yards"

928
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,556
Troy, where are you going?

929
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,190
You have just crossed them.
- Stop them.

930
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,039
Now what?
- Who are they?

931
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,769
Guys, they are BansaPs men.

That's how they knew
we were in that shop.

Then what should we do?

1041

01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,675
I kept saying that you shouldn't
get Ajay Mehra involved.

1230
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,446
But this was Anushka's project,
wasn't it?

1231
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:56,250
Yes, it is.
But Zoya is responsible for this mess.

1232
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,257
What? - She keeps coming
up with weird ideas.

1233
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,020
Why are you involving
my daughter into this?

1234
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:03,052
If you had given even a little
attention to your daughten.

1235
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,131
Have you ever
read your daughter's blogs?

1236
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,961
Zoya writes blogs?
- Yes.

1237
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:10,401
Why is the media saying such things
about our kids.. - So what do I do?

1238
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,597
Who is it?
- Kriplani.

1239
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,606
What is he saying? - He's saying that
the media is calling our kids criminals.

1240
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:15,107
Search evewone's houses.

1241
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,199
I mean even/one.

1242
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:19,370
We got him, sir.
We are nearly there.

1243
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:37,761
Shit!

1244
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:45,094
What happened, sir?

1245
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:48,074
BansaPs cyber cell was
twing to hack our sewer.

1246
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,642
If it had succeeded, they would've
found out about this hideout.

1247
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:51,575
But now we are safe.

1248
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:52,407
Sir..

1249
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:53,741
Troy wants to talk to you, sir.

1250
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,143
Yeah, Troy.

1251
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,274
Sir, I have tried
my best to break them.

1252
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:58,613
But they are not talking.

1253
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,518
Troy, just kill one of them.

1254
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:05,615
Others will speak automatically.
- No, Troy.

1255
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:11,254
Is this the best solution
you could think of?

1256
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:12,662
That's the Nazi way, dad.

1257
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,166
Fear of death is worse than death.

1258
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:15,132
And next what?

1259
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,062
Blow up this whole city with a bomb?

1260
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,597
What do you think,
am I some god or godfather?

1261
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,504
Are we running
a crime syndicate here?

1262
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,533
Why are you shouting at me?

1263
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,336
You are behaving as if
you haven't killed anybody.

1264
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,606
What did you say?
- Raj..

1265
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,272
What did you say?
- Yes, you heard me right.

1266
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,145
You are behaving as if
you haven't killed anybody.

1267
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,616
I didn't kill anyone with my own hands.
- What difference does it make?

1268
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:33,619
It makes a difference because
we are running a business here.

1269
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,655
We are not running a crime syndicate.
- Just keep quiet, Kabir.

1270
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,691
I had got people killed
for tactical reasons.

1271
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,981
You are a Han/ard graduate.
- So what?

1272
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:43,986
Don't you understand that
not rage but courage solves problems?

1273
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,588
Go and think over this issue.
- Yes, I am going.

1274
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:46,496
Go.
- I am going in my room.

1275
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,533
Let me talk.

1276
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:48,693
Kabir!

1277
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:51,400
Hello?

1278
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,464
Papa, food has been sewed.
We are waiting for you.

1279
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,243
Give the phone to your grandma, dear.

1280
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:00,240
Yes?

1281
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,304
We got it, sir.
Here is the hard drive, sir.

1282
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,713
See this.

1283
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:07,647
Sir, I was scanning the mall's
footage and here's what I found.

1284
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,084
Good. Vew good.

1285
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,492
Oh, we have got the drive!

1286
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,086
My God. Inform Troy.

1287
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,132
Troy is already in the mall, sir.
- Great.

1288
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,962
Give me the live feed
of the shop. Give me. - Yes, sir.

1289
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:23,628
Ask Troy to reach there quickly.
I want the hard drive now!

1290
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,703
Your papa will come later.

1291
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,270
We should start eating.

1292
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,365
Prema?

1293
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,709
This is the live feed from the mall.

1294
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:40,517
Mr. Bansal, even Ajay Mehra
must be aware about this, right?

1295
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:46,525
Doomed. He is already there.

1296
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:47,989
Troy!

1297
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,289
Where are you, Troy?

1298
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:01,563
Good.

1299
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:03,473
Catch him.

1300
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:48,182
Troy!

1301
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,245
Hard disk should not
go into Ajay Mehra's hand..

1302
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,087
...even if you have to shoot him.

1303
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:53,091
Kill him.

1304
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,077
Doomed.

1305
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,060
Go!

1306
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,055
Watch out!

1307
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,762
Do you have a death wish?

1308
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,470
Hey, are you mad?

1309
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,274
Have you gone crazy?

1310
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,350
Watch out!
- Are you blind?

1311
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,482
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

1312
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:28,773
Move!

1313
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:55,519
Ajay Mehra.

1314
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,092
That's Ajay Mehra.

1315
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,463
Yes, he's wounded.

1316
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:21,579
Move.

1317
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:42,421
Yes Rakesh.
- Yes, sir.

1318
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,393
What happened?

1319
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:45,226
The news is true, sir.

1320
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:49,662
We just found Raj Bansal's security
chief's dead body on the railway tracks.

1321
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,671
People have also seen
Ajay Mehra fighting with him.

1322
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:57,533
This means this issue directly
involves Ajay Mehra and Raj Bansal.

1323
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,373
This is a vew big stow.

1324
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,208
No, hang on.

1325
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:01,369
Wait for my instructions.

1326
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,040
Don't worw. The hospitaL.
- Sir..

1327
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:04,949
Who..
- Mr. Kaitan.

1328
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:06,618
Yes, Kaitan?

1329
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,018
Mr. Bansal, we have been
hearing many rumors since morning..

1330
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:12,217
"That you and your men are
involved in Ajay Mehra's case today.

1331
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,122
So?

1332
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,219
Nothing. We are not
airing any news against you.

1333
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:17,024
Don't worw.

1334
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:20,123
We understand that Ajay Mehra
has become a problem for all of us.

1335
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:21,462
Good.
- We don't.

1336
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:26,295
Rakesh, for now we
will only show the truth"

1337
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,534
"that doesn't affect our
channel's business interest. - Okay.

1338
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:31,509
Keep an eye on the situation
and keep me updated.

1339
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:32,304
Got it?

1340
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,105
Okay, sir.

1341
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:38,740
Akshay!

1342
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:40,183
Yes, sir.

1343
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,649
Sir, this" - Akshay..
Where are the kids and Riya?

1344
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,054
Sir, the kids were in a bad condition
so Riya took them to the hospital.

1345
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:47,059
But she is on her way back.
- What happened over here?

1346
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:48,393
All this.

1347
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:50,122
Sir, Bansal was twing
to track our location.

1348
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:51,491
"So I had to disconnect even/thing.

1349
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:53,999
Here. Connect this.
- We had no other option.

1350
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,247
Ajay.

1351
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,053
Riya.

1352
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:21,118
What happened?

1353
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:23,584
What happened?

1354
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,491
We had taken the kids
to the hospital.

1355
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,203
Let me go! - Help me!
- How could you just barge in?

1356
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,705
Security! Security! Stop them!

1357
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:35,263
Help me!

1358
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:37,104
Security!
- Leave me.

1359
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:41,377
Leave me! Let go! Let me go!

1360
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,746
Anushka!
- Leave me!

1361
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:45,811
Somebody help us!

1362
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:48,178
Let them go!

1363
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,153
Let them go!

1364
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:53,116
Anushka! Rohan!

1365
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,619
Anushka!
- Rohan!

1366
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:58,323
Why are you hitting them?
Leave them.

1367
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:02,065
Rohan!

1368
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:03,099
M“
"w!

1369
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:05,137
Ma'am, please help us!
Ma'am! - Let them go!

1370
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:08,333
Let them go! Leave me!
- Yes, sir.

1371
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:10,137
Let me go!
- Talkto him.

1372
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:11,006
Talkto him.

1373
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:13,170
I could've killed you as well, doctor.

1374
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:18,650
But I am letting you live.
- Bansal, they are just kids!

1375
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:20,447
What enmity do you have with them!

1376
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:23,284
Let them go! - Go and reason
it with your mental patient.

1377
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:25,413
If he doesn't return the video..

1378
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,461
...then I'll hang their dead bodies
of them at Ajay Mehra's press.

1379
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:30,291
Do you understand that?

1380
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:32,259
I couldn't do anything.

1381
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,696
I couldn't do anything. Ajay..

1382
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:50,207
Satyakam, our years of hard work,
our sacrifices.

1383
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:56,680
In just a few hours that man
has brought us back to square one.

1384
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:00,420
The entire systems and machineries..

1385
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:03,186
"Have become a criminal's agent.

1386
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:08,600
And people are still just
watching from the sidelines.

1387
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:11,760
They will side the one who wins.

1388
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,100
They don't give a damn
about the truth or lies.

1389
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,640
Okay, then so be it.

1390
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:27,484
Akshay, upload it.

1391
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,283
I cannot, sir. The sewer is dead.

1392
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:31,721
Fine then make copies of it.

1393
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:34,521
Yes. <i>lwill</i> personally distribute
it across the city.

1394
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:36,118
Make copies of it.
- Didn't you hear me?

1395
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:37,526
Make the copies.
- They will kill the kids.

1396
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:41,032
Let him kills the kids if he wants to!

1397
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:44,028
He is already on a killing spree.

1398
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:46,435
He killed Joe D'Souza.

1399
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,098
He killed so many
innocent people as well.

1400
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:53,339
And today,
he killed our friends in front of you.

1401
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:54,769
No!

1402
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:59,381
I will destroy BansaPs empire..

1403
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,409
<i>Iwill</i> have him begging on streets!

1404
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,682
<i>Iwill</i> expose him!

1405
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:05,716
What are you waiting for?
Make copies of it.

1406
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,459
Make copies of it.
- Stop it.

1407
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:09,392
Make copies of it. No!
- What are you doing? Stop it.

1408
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:10,485
I want copies.

1409
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:12,030
Make copies of it.
- Stop it.

1410
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,087
Copies. Copies
- Stop it.

1411
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:14,064
I want copies.
- Stop it.

1412
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:15,498
Come to your senses!
Stop it! Stop it!

1413
01:33:15,556 --> 01:33:17,229
Look at me.
They are kids.

1414
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:20,730
They are just kids.
They are innocent, Ajay.

1415
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:24,374
They don't know that this
video could have them killed.

1416
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,474
What do you want?

1417
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,078
You want their photos
on that martyrs' board?

1418
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,677
Can you live with that?
Can you?

1419
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:39,582
You didn't see how
they killed Joe D'Souza.

1420
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:44,354
Just look at that.
- I know.

1421
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:47,254
I know, Ajay. I know.

1422
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:52,329
But even Joe sir wouldn't
want us to risk the lives of kids.

1423
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:58,134
And we have no right
to take such a risk with them.

1424
01:33:58,332 --> 01:34:01,279
Please Ajay.. tq/ to understand.

1425
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:04,012
They are not our kids.

1426
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:48,423
You thought that you would
come on news channels, as heroes.

1427
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:49,559
Right?

1428
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:02,506
For Ajay Satyakam Mehra,
these four kids were blackmailing..

1429
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:05,544
...money laundering
and hacking accounts.

1430
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:08,546
The police are yet
to disclose their names.

1431
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:13,415
But they say that these kids
will soon be in their custody.

1432
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,117
Luckily, all of you are just kids.

1433
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:20,651
Not you, Rohan.

1434
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:25,326
You know what treatment
boys like you get in thejail.

1435
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:27,361
Don't drop the soap"

1436
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:28,764
No, Rohan.

1437
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:35,574
She has you whipped, already.

1438
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,648
Kabir!

1439
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:47,316
Anushka!
- I will kill you!

1440
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:52,082
Stop, please! No.

1441
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:53,318
Leave him!

1442
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:57,685
No!
- Leave him!

1443
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:00,028
Kabir!
- Leave him!

1444
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:02,301
No!
- Kabir!

1445
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:14,602
What?

1446
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:16,745
What were you doing in there?

1447
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:18,642
Teaching these slaves a lesson.

1448
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:21,252
Kabir!

1449
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,215
Have you lost your mind?

1450
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:28,086
Kabir.. listen to me.

1451
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:29,093
Stop.

1452
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:30,026
Stop, Kabir!

1453
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:31,129
Listen to me.

1454
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:32,459
Listen to me, Kabir!

1455
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:34,595
Listen to me.

1456
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:36,568
Kabir.. listen to me.

1457
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:01,559
Son..

1458
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:08,199
One should hide their children's
mistakes, not their crimes..

1459
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:17,105
I heard someone scream.

1460
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:19,001
What is happening?

1461
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:21,372
It's nothing, mother.

1462
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:22,379
Go to your room.

1463
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:24,382
I am not blind or deaf, son.

1464
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:26,315
It's nothing, mother. Come.

1465
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:29,252
I feel as if something vew bad
is going to happen. - Come with me.

1466
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:31,185
Why are you hiding it from me?
- Come.

1467
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:33,153
I am feeling vew scared.
- Mother"

1468
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:34,488
I am not feeling good..

1469
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:38,428
Sir.. - Mother,
you should take care of Ananya.

1470
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:41,064
Please take care of Ananya.
- I am feeling vew scared.

1471
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:41,758
Please, mother.

1472
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:44,093
I am not feeling good about this.

1473
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:46,236
Yes, tell me.
- Vew good news, sir.

1474
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,295
Ajay Mehra is going
to Kriplani's house.

1475
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:49,532
Kriplani had called.

1476
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:52,737
He said that Dr. Riya is coming
over to his house with Ajay Mehra.

1477
01:37:54,468 --> 01:37:55,378
Good.

1478
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:56,614
Good.

1479
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:59,378
We have our men there.
If you want we could.. - No!

1480
01:38:12,686 --> 01:38:13,460
No!

1481
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,726
My leg!

1482
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:16,568
My leg!

1483
01:38:32,473 --> 01:38:35,386
Grandma. let's pray.

1484
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:37,547
Even/thing will be fine.

1485
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,025
Even/thing will be fine, my child.

1486
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:47,693
Where is my daughter?
- Ajay!

1487
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,257
Where is my daughter?
- Did you find the kids?

1488
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:52,166
Ajay, give us that evidence video..
- Ajay, how dare you...?

1489
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:55,139
Ajay, who has given you the right
to put my daughter's life at risk!

1490
01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:56,196
Give that damn thing now!

1491
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,209
We too are concerned
about your children's safety.

1492
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:01,075
Why would you be concerned? - If you are
concerned then give us the evidence.

1493
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:03,547
This is not done.
- Let me at least talk.

1494
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,214
My Varun..
- Please listen to me. Hold on. Please listen to me.

1495
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:08,549
Just listen to me. Listen to me!

1496
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:14,024
Once Bansal is exposed,
he will be busy saving himself.

1497
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:15,560
You.. - He won't
do anything to the kids.

1498
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,095
You just need to be patient.

1499
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:19,153
He has our kids!
- You don't understand.

1500
01:39:19,219 --> 01:39:20,289
If anything happens to Rohan...

1501
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:23,335
He won't do anything to them!
- How can you say that?

1502
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:26,132
Once he is exposed, he can do nothing!
- I am worried about my kid.

1503
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:28,366
He cannot do anything...
- Ajay Mehra.

1504
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,342
You?
- Give them the evidence..

1505
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:35,036
Or your daughter will die.

1506
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:38,047
Daughter?
- Yes.

1507
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:41,709
Anushka is your daughter.
- My daughter?!

1508
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,478
But you said.

1509
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:47,318
Varsha is dead.

1510
01:39:47,748 --> 01:39:50,661
And her child is also dead.

1511
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:52,493
Because of you.

1512
01:39:52,753 --> 01:39:55,359
During delivem.
- No. You are lying!

1513
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:58,002
Both of them..
- I spoke to her a few days ago.

1514
01:39:58,058 --> 01:39:59,765
They are dead because of you.

1515
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:02,572
Both of them are dead because of you.

1516
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:04,336
It's your fault.
- No!

1517
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:06,635
I want to die. I want to die.

1518
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:09,478
Let me die.

1519
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,115
Ajay, drink this water.

1520
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:14,750
I want to go to Varsha.

1521
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:42,714
My daughter is alive.

1522
01:40:44,104 --> 01:40:45,777
You kept her hidden?

1523
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,083
Why?

1524
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:51,317
Why did you keep my daughter hidden?

1525
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:54,552
Because I wanted to keep her alive.

1526
01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:58,788
Anyone who was close to you died.

1527
01:40:59,686 --> 01:41:00,721
Your brother.

1528
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:02,692
Your sister-in-Iaw.

1529
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:05,262
Your friends.

1530
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:06,536
Varsha.

1531
01:41:06,693 --> 01:41:08,070
D'Souza.

1532
01:41:08,128 --> 01:41:10,608
All of them.
All of them died.

1533
01:41:11,098 --> 01:41:15,638
Now look, your daughter facing death"

1534
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:20,243
"as soon as she came close to you.

1535
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:24,144
Why do you want to kill your daughter?

1536
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,051
You want Anushka dead.

1537
01:41:26,113 --> 01:41:28,286
Enough, uncle,
you have said enough.

1538
01:41:28,348 --> 01:41:29,656
Calm down.
- Varun!

1539
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:32,158
MY 50h!

1540
01:41:32,486 --> 01:41:34,090
Mother!

1541
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:35,359
MY 50h!

1542
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:36,332
Son..

1543
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:39,034
How did this...

1544
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,232
It's hurting a lot, mother.
- Where?

1545
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:43,536
It's hurting a lot.
- Where does it hurt, son?

1546
01:41:43,664 --> 01:41:46,110
Oh God, they have hurt him so badly.

1547
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:48,109
It's hurting. Move aside.

1548
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:49,340
Please to listen to me.
- Ajay sir..

1549
01:41:49,403 --> 01:41:51,383
Listen to me, Varun. Listen to me.

1550
01:41:51,572 --> 01:41:54,178
Sir, they will kill my friends.

1551
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:56,312
Sir, they are ruthless.

1552
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,385
Sir, we can't take it anymore.

1553
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:02,090
Please, sir. - Give them the evidence.
- Now what else do you want, Ajay?

1554
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:03,287
Please give it.
- Give them the hard drive.

1555
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:04,761
We can't take it anymore.

1556
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,598
Sir, please give the hard drive.

1557
01:42:07,654 --> 01:42:08,724
Please sir.

1558
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:11,230
Take this.
- Thank you.

1559
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:12,235
Thank you, sir.

1560
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:13,304
Move aside.

1561
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,430
Move aside.

1562
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:17,066
But you got the hard drive.
- I have to save my friends.

1563
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,611
Varun, stop. Varun..

1564
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:22,442
Please go along with my son.

1565
01:43:17,324 --> 01:43:18,701
Zoya!

How are you?
- My child..

1569
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:28,439
What happened?

1570
01:43:28,468 --> 01:43:29,344
I am so hZPPY-

Anushka..

1573
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,281
She is still there.

1574
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:42,521
Sir, they were first
going to keep me back.

1575
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:47,623
But as soon as they learnt that she is
your daughter, they kept her instead.

1576
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:54,034
Sir, they know even/thing
that is happening here.

1577
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:56,169
Because of my dad.

1578
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:01,537
I am sorw.

1579
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:05,607
Sir, Bansal has given this for you.

1580
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:24,727
Are you my father?

1581
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:28,667
Yes, dear.

1582
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,601
Then where have you
been all these years?

1583
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:38,143
Why was I kept away from you?

1584
01:44:44,478 --> 01:44:48,153
Why did grandpa always
say that my parents are no more?

1585
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:51,596
I am sorw, dear.

1586
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:53,464
I am sorw.

1587
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:57,534
You didn't know that
you had a daughter?

1588
01:44:59,159 --> 01:45:01,696
You didn't know about me?

1589
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:06,269
I will explain even/thing
when we will meet.

1590
01:45:07,734 --> 01:45:09,975
You are not my father.

1591
01:45:10,037 --> 01:45:13,177
No, dear. I am your papa.

1592
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:15,176
I will explain even/thing.

1593
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:17,620
What will you explain?

1594
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:21,049
When I was small,
and I used to go to schooL.

1595
01:45:21,114 --> 01:45:25,028
...l used to think that all
my friends have parents, but I don't.

1596
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:30,229
Since childhood I have been
told that I don't have anyone.

1597
01:45:33,293 --> 01:45:34,533
I am sorw, dear.

1598
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:36,267
I did not have anyone, papa.

1599
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,202
My child..

1600
01:45:38,265 --> 01:45:40,302
I thought that I am alone.

1601
01:45:42,102 --> 01:45:43,080
My child..

1602
01:45:43,136 --> 01:45:45,707
What will you explain,
that why am I here?

1603
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:49,011
Why they are troubling me?

1604
01:45:49,076 --> 01:45:51,283
Why am I facing these problems?

1605
01:45:51,545 --> 01:45:53,547
What will you explain?
- Dear..

1606
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:56,323
You are not my father.

1607
01:45:56,383 --> 01:45:57,794
No dear, you shouldn't say that.

1608
01:45:58,018 --> 01:45:59,793
I hate you!

1609
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,230
Dear..

1610
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:02,533
Anushka!

1611
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:03,565
My child..

1612
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:06,536
Don't worw. I will explain
even/thing to your daughter.

1613
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:11,132
Bansal, I gave you the hard drive.

1614
01:46:11,665 --> 01:46:14,407
Give me my daughter back.

1615
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:17,172
You are a smart journalist, Ajay.
- Please send her back.

1616
01:46:17,237 --> 01:46:19,683
I am sure you must have
made copies of this video.

1617
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,486
I don't have any copies, Bansal.
I don't.

1618
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,647
This is what was told
to me last time as well.

1619
01:46:24,678 --> 01:46:26,624
But then copies of
that video cropped up.

1620
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,660
Hence, this time
I cannot take any risk.

1621
01:46:28,749 --> 01:46:32,492
Your daughter is the
guarantee of my son's safety.

1622
01:46:32,753 --> 01:46:34,733
Anyway, what difference
does it make to you?

1623
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:37,025
She has been staying
away from you all this while.

1624
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:39,227
Stop your nonsense, Bansal.

1625
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:41,763
Give me my daughter back.

1626
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:42,597
No!

1627
01:46:42,662 --> 01:46:44,005
Give me my daughter back.

1628
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,567
She will stay with
me till you are alive.

1629
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:49,739
And remember,
if you do anything stupid"

1630
01:46:50,003 --> 01:46:50,777
Anything.-

1631
01:46:51,371 --> 01:46:53,783
Then you know what you will lose.

1632
01:46:55,542 --> 01:46:57,522
And the discussion ends here.

1633
01:47:08,388 --> 01:47:09,560
Joshi..
- Yes, sir..

1634
01:47:15,362 --> 01:47:18,104
Joshi, take this
girl back to her father.

1635
01:47:18,165 --> 01:47:20,202
Mother!
- What are you...?

1636
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:23,743
You will kidnap someone's daughter?

1637
01:47:24,004 --> 01:47:25,449
Now this is what you will do?

1638
01:47:25,505 --> 01:47:26,643
Then what do you want?

1639
01:47:27,007 --> 01:47:28,350
That I should shoot Kabir?

1640
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:30,749
Should I send him tojail?
- Yes, send him tojail.

1641
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:32,490
He has committed a crime.

1642
01:47:32,546 --> 01:47:34,150
He should be punished.

1643
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:35,716
What are you saying?

1644
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:40,259
The stock market will crash if
Kabir even gets a scratch on his body.

1645
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:43,024
Thousands of investors
will commit suicide.

1646
01:47:43,223 --> 01:47:46,397
You want to kill thousands
to save a single girl?

1647
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,406
You too have a daughter.

1648
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:50,373
What if someone does this to her?

1649
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:51,431
Mother!

1650
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:55,639
If someone touches my daughter,
<i>lwill</i> kill him!

1651
01:47:56,002 --> 01:47:57,413
I am Raj Bansal!

1652
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:58,779
What do you think?

1653
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:03,988
Your daughter is valuable
and his daughter is not?

1654
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:08,115
Raj, anyone's daughter
is always treated like one's own.

1655
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:11,025
Let me do my work, mother.
Please. Go away from here.

1656
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:12,688
I won't leave.
- Please leave, mother.

1657
01:48:12,953 --> 01:48:15,331
I will send this
girl back to her father.

1658
01:48:15,388 --> 01:48:18,062
Let me do my work. Sheetal, take her away.
- What you are doing is not right.

1659
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:20,331
You keep quiet.
You too arejust like him.

1660
01:48:20,393 --> 01:48:21,701
Please leave, mother.
- No.

1661
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:22,599
Take her away, Sheetal.
- Okay..

1662
01:48:22,662 --> 01:48:24,198
Please. - What you
are doing is not right.

1663
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:25,208
Let's go, mother.
- Please, mother.

1664
01:48:25,265 --> 01:48:26,573
Something bad is
going to happen to us.

1665
01:48:26,633 --> 01:48:28,476
Please leave.
- You are not getting it, Raj.

1666
01:48:29,236 --> 01:48:31,238
Even/thing will be over.

1667
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:33,981
What does he think of himself?
- Calm down, mother.

1668
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,144
What does he think of himself?

1669
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:36,711
A sin is being committed in my house.
- Come with me.
