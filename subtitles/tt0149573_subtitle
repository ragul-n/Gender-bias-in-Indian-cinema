Like you need to breathe...

3
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:35,799
like you need to breathe to live...

4
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:42,809
"you need a beloved
to love"

5
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:56,553
"Like you need a drink
to lose your senses..."

6
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:03,269
"you need a beloved
to love"

7
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:12,772
"You just need a beloved
to fall in love with"

8
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:44,300
"Time holds the destiny
of every human being"

9
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:53,544
"Time holds the destiny
of every human being"

10
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,813
"The mirror speaks lies...
the pictures are true"

11
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:03,092
"Where there is pain,
there's music"

12
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:07,756
"Where there is love,
there is a mate"

13
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:11,259
"No one knows, but..."

14
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,767
this is the way to life

15
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,769
Like you need a tune...

16
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:28,118

to love"

00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:44,127
"All you need is a beloved
you can love"

00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:56,304
"Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr and Mrs Pestonji..."

20
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,748
celebrate their 25th wedding
anniversary in our midst today

21
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,078
Let's give them a big hand!

22
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:29,509
"The goal has been accomplished,
yet there is a distance"

23
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:38,787
"The goal has been accomplished,
yet there is a distance"

00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,289
"Without a companion,
life is incomplete"

25
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:48,292
"Somewhere, I will find my niche"

26
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:52,795
"How will I spend this journey
in loneliness?"

27
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,537
The eyes that share my dream...

28
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,801
are the eyes I'm looking for

29
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,745
Like you need the Moon...

30
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:13,253

for moonlight..."

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:20,256
"you need a beloved
to fall in love with"

32
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:26,495

"to live, you need a beloved
to love"

34
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:40,783
"to live, you need a beloved
to love"

35
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,281
To love...

36
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,285
to fall in love

37
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,789
to fall in love

38
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,136
to fall in love

39
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,742
Stop here

40
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,748
Must leave now. It's very late.

41
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,245
Wait a moment.
Let light a cigarette.

42
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,246
Where's the match?

43
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:23,494
Hey Master...
give me a match

44
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:30,259
Spoilt rich brat!

45
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:34,505
Carry a blade if you want a shave!

46
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:37,099
"You drive an expensive bike,
but you won't carry a match!"

47
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,268
Light it up.

48
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,271
"I had a dream last night, Master."

49
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:47,280
"A morning-dream, you know.
They often come true."

50
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,112
What did you dream?
- I dreamt...

51
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:54,283
of a huge air-conditioned
tailoring shop. I was amazed.

52
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,618
I asked people whose it was.

53
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,466
Know what they said?
It's Master's!

54
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:07,062
"And bang next to that,
I dreamt of a posh bungalow"

55
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:10,472
I was even more amazed and I asked...
whose is this?

56
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:13,077
Guess what people said?
It's Master's!

57
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:16,239
Don't tell me!
- I swear! Outside the bungalow...

58
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:22,083
I dreamt of three Mercedes cars.
I was stumped. I asked...

59
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:25,589
"whose are they? And guess what
they said? "They're master's"

60
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,090
Really?

61
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,596
"Inside the bungalow, I dreamt
of a big crowd"

62
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:36,497
"I asked, who is the crowd for?
- For Master?"

63
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,261
"Yes, you're right!
And later..."

64
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:44,275
I saw a corpse covered
in white cloth.

65
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,770
"I asked people,
whose corpse is this?"

66
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:50,275
And guess what people said.
Guess!

67
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,508
What?
- It's Master's!

68
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:58,781
Look... how often have I told you
not to say such things to me?

69
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,720
How often have I told you?
I'm terribly scared of dying.

70
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,454
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I?

71
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,723
Don't ever say such a thing
to me again.

72
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,060
Sorry... I'm sorry.

73
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:16,072
And you! Go around with
this spoilt brat all night!

74
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:20,071
"Master, I went out to earn a living.
What's the matter?"

75
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,072
"What's the matter, eh?
Aren't you worried about anyone?"

76
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,075
Know what happened?

77
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:30,078
Your father came here
in a car.

78
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,081
He talked to your mother
for a long time.

79
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,093
Your father then went away...

80
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:39,493
and your mother ran after
his car like a mad woman.

81
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,258
"Fortunately, I was around.
And I saved her. Or else..."

82
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,098
Want me to come?

83
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,101
Mother...

84
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,723
"What is the matter, Mother?
What are you doing?"

85
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,059
Mother...

86
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,731
"For my sake, tell me
what happened, mother."

87
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:32,241
Mother... won't you tell me
what happened? Won't you?

88
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,491
"Mother, what happened?"

89
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,273
Go and give this back.

90
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:07,515
Give this with all the other stuff.
And also tell him...

91
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:13,782
that I will not wait for him anymore.
I've waited enough.

92
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:17,126
Go on.

93
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,293
I always had this hope
that he'd come back some day.

94
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:30,299
"So I kept all his things in the house,
just as they were."

95
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,538
But not anymore.

96
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:42,817
"What has my father done to you,
Mother? What has he done?"

97
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,556
"Nothing, son."

98
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,551
Your father is getting married.

99
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,827
Today. Right now.

100
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:11,276
"Congratulations, Roy saheb."

101
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:14,512
I've had enough with one wedding.
And you've married again!

102
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:18,113
Mr Vikram Roy!

103
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,782
"Come on out, you cheat!"

104
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,855
"Congratulations on your wedding,
Mr Vikram Roy!"

105
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:33,538
"On your wedding, your first wife,
my mother, has sent this gift for you."

106
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,131
Here you are!

107
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:41,143
Rahul! Have you gone mad?

108
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:45,815
"Yes, I have gone mad!
Because you have cheated my mother!"

109
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,310
You have betrayed her!

110
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:51,321
She sends you back this
wedding necklace. Here you are!

111
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,550
"You're dead for us, Vikram Roy!"

112
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,163
This isn't a wedding!
It's a trip to your grave!

113
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:05,260
I curse you! You will never
be happy again. Never!

114
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,263
"Vikram, call the police.
Have him arrested."

115
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,767
On what charges? On what charges
will you have me arrested?

116
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,777
"My only crime is that my father
is marrying again, isn't it?"

117
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,106
So I've gone mad?

118
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:23,119
"Rahul, that's enough.
Go home now. Or else..."

119
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,380
"Or else, what?"

120
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:31,529
"Or else, what are you going to do?
You'll have me locked up? Lmprisoned?"

121
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:36,534
Go ahead and do it!
Do what you want to!

122
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,536
Have me arrested!
Send me to jail!

123
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:43,298
Send me to jail!
Have me locked up!

124
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:49,811
Call the police! Call them!
What are you looking at me for?

125
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,548
What are you doing? Stop it!
- Leave me alone.

126
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:57,816
"Hello, police?"

127
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,814
Take that!

128
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:15,506
Stay here.

129
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,281
"Give this to Mr Shinde.
- Very well, sir."

130
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,791
Come here.

131
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:54,300
I'm talking to you. Come here.

132
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:06,076
The warden from your hostel
must be arriving any moment.

133
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,483
"Don't try to run away again,
after you go back there."

134
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:15,483
You're a young girl.

135
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,754
It's not safe for you to walk
around the streets at night.

136
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:26,267
Perhaps because you have been
brought up in the orphanage...

137
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:29,764
you don't know anything
about the outside world.

138
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,434
You have no idea.

139
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:35,512
Inspector Deshpande?

140
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:48,118
You?
- Ernie Campbell. Hostel Warden.

141
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,119
"I'm sorry for the inconvenience, sir."

142
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:54,293
"Because of this girl, you've been
put to a lot of unnecessary trouble."

143
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:00,471
May I ask you why this girl
ran away from the hostel?

144
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,740
Your silence has answered
my question.

145
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:15,243
"Anyway, she's all yours.
You may take her away."

146
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:22,752
But remember one thing. A thing like
this mustn't happen again. Okay?

147
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:28,260
"Thank you for your advise.
Anu, let's go."

148
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:34,496
"I said, let's go."

149
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:45,114
Come on. I've got to
talk to you in privacy.

150
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,518
Come.

151
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:53,788
"Sawant, we're getting a lot
of youngsters here nowadays."

152
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,519
"They're making us feel old,
aren't they?"

153
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:07,735
"All heated up, eh?
A fire in the heart?"

154
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:11,739
Want to break things?
Want to beat up people?

155
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,741
Hit me... go on...

156
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,740
"Hit me, I say!"

157
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:22,744
"You have a lot of spunk, don't you?"

158
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,275
"Inspector, lock me up in this cell."

159
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,521
There's no saying what I'll do
if you let me go.

160
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:02,051
Nothing's in my control. I might
end up killing someone... please!

161
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,223
And why?

162
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:13,734
Did you get it written in your destiny
that you'd have happiness all the way?

163
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,235
You want someone else to bear
your share of sorrows?

164
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,473
And what do you think?

165
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:25,740
You're the only one in the world who
has problems? Everyone else is happy?

166
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,487
The way you behaved at your
father's second marriage...

167
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,750
I could lock you up for good.
And what then?

168
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:37,485
What happens of your mother?
You mustn't even have thought of that.

169
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:41,256
And why must you think?
- So what am I to do?

170
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,501
That man has heaped
insult on my mother.

171
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:50,770
All I have for him is hatred.
And I must live with this hatred.

172
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:01,048
"My son, hatred does
not let people live."

173
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,446
That has been my experience.

174
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:10,222
If there's anything that keeps
man alive in this world...

175
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:13,463
it's love. Love.

176
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,229
I'll take responsibility for you
and let you go.

177
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:26,075
Go and awaken love in your heart.
Not hatred.

178
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,070
Awaken love.

179
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,482
Go on.

180
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:02,277
May I know what's your problem here?
Why did you want to run away?

181
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,781
And what did you intend to do
having run away from here?

182
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,112
Answer me.

183
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,519
Do you hear me?
Answer me!

184
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:19,526
I don't want a life of charity.
I don't want anyone's favours.

185
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:24,296
I want to become something
on my own.

186
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,795
I want to lead my own life...

187
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:31,302
I want to have something of my own.

188
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:34,804
Have you ever taken a look
at yourself in the mirror?

189
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,810
You don't have a good face
nor good brains.

190
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,315
Listen to one thing carefully.

191
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:51,554
Your future is as dark
as your past was.

192
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:58,568
What will you do after
you leave this hostel?

193
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:03,100
What will happen of you
once you've left?

194
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,773
You... you can't do anything.

195
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:13,517
All you can do is to
embarrass us.

196
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:19,787
"I had to bow my head before that
inspector, only because of you!"

197
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,524
Because you committed the sin
of escaping from here.

198
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,621
"I committed no sin, sir.
- Shut up!"

199
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,792
Don't you dare talk back to me!

200
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:37,799
You have committed a sin.
And you must now atone for it.

201
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,309
You will get nothing
to eat or drink...

202
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:47,547
till such time as you clean
all the rooms in the hostel.

203
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,311
From the ground-floor
to the top-floor.

204
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,554
From night to the morning.

205
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,792
"Rahul, come here. I've got to
discuss something with you."

206
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:55,548
"Rahul, my son.
Whatever happened last night..."

207
00:22:57,156 --> 00:23:00,148
we'll never talk about it again.

208
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,494
"My son, there's nothing more dead
than love that has died."

209
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:16,503
I want to bury my dead love and
try to lead my life once again.

210
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:20,268
Will you help me?

211
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:46,527
It's 9. I'll miss my train.
I must leave now.

212
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,131
Thank you.

213
00:23:55,547 --> 00:24:00,143
"The electricity bill is lying here.
I'm leaving a cheque, too."

214
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:03,478
"Remember to pay the bill,
or the supply will be cut."

215
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,247
"Okay, Mother.
- May I leave now?"

216
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:48,289
"Keep an eye. I'm going out.
- Very well, sir."

217
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:56,537
Hey Gavaskar... Kapil Dev!
We're talking about Cricket.

218
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,472
It can't be played by two people.
We need atleast eleven players.

219
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,073
Stand here and bowl.
You and I are going to play today.

220
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:08,742
"Only the two of us?
- Yes, and bowl well."

221
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:23,098
"O God! You've hit a six,
haven't you?"

222
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:25,493
The Test match is all over!

223
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:30,268
I knew it. Now...
- Wait here.

224
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:33,768
I'll go and bring it back.

225
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:41,782
My word! Since when has he
taken a fancy to fielding?

226
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:46,121
"Hey mister, this is a girls' hostel.
Entry is forbidden. Don't you know?"

227
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,517
I'm looking for my ball.
I'll go away with my ball.

228
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:50,785
Find it quickly and go away.

229
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,272
What happened?

230
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,776
"How did you fall, Anu?
What happened?"

231
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,117
Get up.

232
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,725
"Let's go, Anu.
Mr Campbell has sent for you."

233
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:09,234
"C'mon, or he'll be angry.
Let's go."

234
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:37,257
"Come on, Anu."

235
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,452
"What is the matter, mother?
Why are you so quiet?"

236
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:07,057
"My son, don't you find
something unusual here?"

237
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:11,726
Unusual? Oh no.
Everything is the same.

238
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:17,465
But why's it so dark in this room?
And why have you lit candles?

239
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:24,478
"When do we light candles, my son?
- Is it someone's birthday?"

240
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:31,087
No. We light a candle when
a young irresponsible man...

241
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:35,249
"forgets to pay the electricity bills,
despite being reminded..."

242
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:39,257
only then do we light candles.
Am I right?

243
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,096
Bill?

244
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:47,768
The bill!

245
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,774
What? What did you say?

246
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:54,507
You threw the electricity bill
on the girl?

247
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:59,106
"Was she going to pay it?
- No, Master. You don't understand."

248
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:01,047
I understand it.
I understand everything.

249
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:04,452
First you see the girl...
is that right?

250
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:08,458
And she sees you. Right?
- Right.

251
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:12,060
And you and she wanted to
say something to each other.

252
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:15,065
But you could say nothing. Right?
- Right.

253
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,465
So where does this electricity
bill land here?

254
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:23,230
I scribbled something on the bill and
threw it to her. She picked it up.

255
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:31,472
Very good. You wrote something
on the electricity bill...

256
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,245
and she picked it up.
Great!

257
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:39,247
You now want the bill. Right?
- Oh yes. That's right.

258
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,752
Only the bill? Or also a reply
to what you wrote on it?

259
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:50,491
"Both, I want both. Or there'll
really be darkness in my life."

260
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:53,765
Stand straight.

261
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:57,264
Turn around. You've grown an inch.

262
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:01,268
Whom did the cops catch yesterday?
- Anu.

263
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:04,514
Anu!
- Go on. Yours is over.

264
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:07,115
"Anu, come here."

265
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:12,120
Stand straight... hands straight.
Look up.

266
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,283
At least return the electricity bill.
- What?

267
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,121
I'll stitch the dress
just as he says.

268
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:22,189
"Not an inch more, not an inch less."

269
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:24,798
"Am I right, sir?
Very strict!"

270
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:28,796
Stand straight now.

271
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:34,308
That guy Rahul...
he's a very nice boy.

272
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:38,141
I know him very well.
He comes from a nice family.

273
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,541
"Right now, his house is
plunged in darkness."

274
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:46,819
So return that electricity bill
and write a few lines in reply.

275
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,151
You will? Sure?

276
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:52,562
Very good. Give it to me.

277
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,271
Here's Master.

278
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:09,103
"Rahul, looks like
he's done it for you."

279
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:14,281
"The way he's walking,
I'm sure he has scored today."

280
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,784
Spoilt brat! How often have I told
you not to play with my scissors?

281
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,116
Give that to me!

282
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,285
And what have you done?
You've torn this up?

283
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:29,290
This is my bread and butter!
I hate people poking fun at it!

284
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,126
Just tell him that!
- All right...

285
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:36,297
stop acting high and mighty and
tell us. Have you brought a reply?

286
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,533
Talk softly! You want me killed?

287
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:48,315
"Master! We've all got to die someday.
I, him... and you!"

288
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:53,818
No touching! I told you so many
times not to talk about dying!

289
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,560
I'm scared of death! Tell him!
He always tries to scare me!

290
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:59,160
Stop it.

291
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:02,766
"Master, tell us what happened.
Have you brought the bill?"

292
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,765
And a reply too.
- Show...

293
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:10,097
Why're you excited in
someone else's affair?

294
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:14,508
What is it to you?
- Wait... give it to me.

295
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:18,275
Hold this. And this too.

296
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,518
Here you are.

297
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:25,779
This is the bill.
Give me the reply.

298
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:33,287
"Rahul, meet me in the room next
to the library next Saturday"

299
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:36,528
"At 7:30.
- Anu"

300
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,128
"Thank you, Master.
- Not again!"

301
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:43,297
"Congratulations, my friend!"

302
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:48,808
"Your love story has begun, Romeo!
But what will you do till Saturday?"

303
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:19,767
"Slowly and quietly,
come into my life..."

304
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,510
"slowly and quietly,
steal my heart"

305
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:30,511
"I love you so dearly, my love..."

306
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:35,516
"I've got to meet you
and tell you"

307
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:41,129
"Slowly and quietly,
come into my life..."

308
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,792
"slowly and quietly,
steal my heart"

309
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:52,300
"I love you so dearly, my love..."

310
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:56,542
"I've got to meet you
and tell you"

311
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:32,780
"Ever since I have seen you,
my heart has not had any peace"

312
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:43,784
"On my lips, there is no name
other than yours"

313
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:57,302
"My state is like
yours too, my love"

314
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:07,742
"I miss you.
I do nothing else"

315
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:15,488
I've gone crazy about you

316
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:20,095
So steal my heart

317
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:26,264
"Slowly and quietly,
come into my life..."

318
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:31,098
"slowly and quietly,
steal my heart"

319
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:12,479
"You have often awakened me
in the nights"

320
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:23,250
You have stolen my sleep

321
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:36,503
"And you have tormented
me so very much"

322
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:47,279
"And yet, I love everything you do"

323
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:54,290
"Come to me now...
stop feeling shy"

324
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:59,293
Steal my heart

325
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:05,226
"Slowly and quietly,
come into my life..."

326
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,063
"slowly and quietly,
steal my heart"

327
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:15,740
"I love you so dearly, my love..."

328
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:20,479
"I've got to meet you
and tell you"

329
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:26,750
"Slowly and quietly,
come into my life..."

330
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:31,255
"slowly and quietly,
steal my heart"

331
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,052
Where did you get that?
Where?

332
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:09,456
"In the church, sir."

333
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:15,228
Could you only find a lipstick
in our sacred church?

334
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,471
What did you aim to achieve
by donning this make up?

335
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:24,071
"You want to fall a prey to
someone's lust, like your mother?"

336
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:29,747
"Speak. You remember what they
did to your mother, don't you?"

337
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:34,247
She could never exorcise the
ghosts of what she had done.

338
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:38,485
So she ended her life
under a running train.

339
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:45,498
But she left you to be brought up
by us! The outcome of her sin!

340
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:46,259
Is all this really happening?
Or am I dreaming?

341
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,512
I don't know why security left
the door of this classroom open.

342
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,782
Come to my office
at 9 'o clock sharp.

343
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:42,809
What do you want from me?

344
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:50,158
Your love.
- What for?

345
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:55,828
Because I'm convinced...
that my future is tied to you.

346
00:40:58,169 --> 00:41:01,502
"When I myself don't have a future,
what future can you have with me?"

347
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:05,499
Do not look for sparks
in the night.

348
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:09,269
I have nothing to give you.

349
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,115
Thank you.

350
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:13,770
"Rahul, Master has left
some photographs for you"

351
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:16,773
"I'll return late. Have your food,
if you're hungry"

352
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:50,136
You...

353
00:42:52,817 --> 00:42:56,309
are my life

354
00:42:57,822 --> 00:42:59,813
You...

355
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:04,757
are my every happiness

356
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,490
You...

357
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:13,498
are my happiness

358
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:15,762
You...

359
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:19,270
are my every happiness

360
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:23,269
"You are my love,
you are my desire..."

361
00:43:23,514 --> 00:43:26,278
you are what my love stands for

362
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:28,779
You...

363
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,782
are my life

364
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:37,288
You are my every joy

365
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:20,499
"I realise now,
you are my first love"

366
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:28,101
"I realise now,
you are my first love"

367
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:35,108
"You are the thirst
I could never quench"

368
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:42,284
"You are my first desire...
and you are the last one"

369
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:47,291
You... are my life

370
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:52,792
You... are my every joy

371
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:06,076
You...

372
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,083
are my life

373
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:11,244
You...

374
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,481
are my every joy

375
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:18,251
"You are my love,
you are my desire..."

376
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:21,493
"you are what my
love stands for"

377
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:26,499
You are my life

378
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:31,768
You are every joy of mine

379
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,530
What scene are you creating here
at this time of the night?

380
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:02,233
You? What are you doing here
at this hour?

381
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,242
I see. A love story.

382
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:18,478
"Sawant, it's a love story.
Not for us. Let's go."

383
00:48:29,486 --> 00:48:33,081
I've written your name
not only on my hand...

384
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:39,495
"it possesses my heart,
my mind and my soul."

385
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:42,755
No one can stop me from falling
in love with you now. No one.

386
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:45,758
Not even you.

387
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:53,265
"I mean it, Anu. Not even you."

388
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:30,240
"Rahul, it's a disaster!
This is terrible!"

389
00:49:30,481 --> 00:49:33,473
You went to the hostel to
meet Anu last night? Didn't you?

390
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:37,247
The warden caught her red-handed
just after you had left.

391
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:42,081
He's going to have her admitted
in a hostel in Ooty now.

392
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:44,250
Anu's sent a note for you.
Here you are... read it.

393
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:51,098
"Rahul, you convinced me
last night..."

394
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:53,260
"that you want my heart,
not just my body"

395
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:56,095
I wish it were possible

396
00:49:56,273 --> 00:50:00,505
"Destiny is taking me far away from
you. Maybe we'll never meet again"

397
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:02,510
Bye

398
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:07,277
"Pallo, we're going to Ooty.
- What?"

399
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:17,790
"He wanted to visit Ooty!
Rahul, where the hell are you?"

400
00:50:18,796 --> 00:50:22,288
"Pallo, I've found out!
I know where Anu is!"

401
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:26,296
That bloody white is staying at
Hotel Fernhill with Anu.

402
00:50:26,537 --> 00:50:28,129
Really?
- But we have a problem.

403
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,637
"Not one... we have
many problems, my friend."

404
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:33,641
I'm feeling terribly cold!
I've had four cups of tea...

405
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:36,803
and two pints of brandy already!
It has made no difference.

406
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:40,810
"There's no warmth for miles!
- Oh shut up, Pallo."

407
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:43,551
That white is sticking to Anu
like a shadow.

408
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:46,812
It's necessary for me to meet Anu
somehow or the other.

409
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,321
"How many days will you
keep me locked here, sir?"

410
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,828
When are you taking me
to the other hostel?

411
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:01,103
You're mistaken...

412
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:04,764
that I've brought you here to
admit you to another hostel.

413
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,503
"Actually, it's something else."

414
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:15,274
Had I revealed the secret
to you in Bombay...

415
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,286
you wouldn't have come here
with me so easily.

416
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,117
It's time to tell you the
reason why we've come here.

417
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,296
I've brought you here
to have you married.

418
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,529
It's a boy from our
institution here.

419
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:40,310
But sir...
- But what? What?

420
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:44,803
"Just that you haven't
even met him, isn't it?"

421
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:47,807
"Just that you don't even
know him, right?"

422
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:54,557
"Or just that you don't love him?
You love someone else, right?"

423
00:51:57,661 --> 00:52:00,494
Love! Love!

424
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,260
"Your mother fell in love, too."

425
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:09,762
With a man she knew and
what happened?

426
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:14,767
You ended up in an orphanage
and she... under a train!

427
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:16,272
Sir...

428
00:52:19,283 --> 00:52:25,119
So listen quietly to what I say.
We have a party this evening.

429
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:28,781
Phillips will come there
to meet you.

430
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:33,787
And I will have the two
of you engaged at the party.

431
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:42,795
Here is your dress.
Wear it and get ready.

432
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:47,141
The party begins in an hour.

433
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:55,808
"Die, if you wish to.
But it isn't so easy."

434
00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:04,744
What were you upto?
You were trying to kill yourself?

435
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:09,084
"You wanted to commit suicide?
Why, Anu?"

436
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:11,317
Because I'm fed up!

437
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:16,495
I want freedom from this captivity!

438
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:32,775
"To gain freedom from this captivity,
you can even give up your life..."

439
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:35,774
but can't you even try to
get yourself out of it?

440
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,115
Who do I have out there?
Who?

441
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,787
"I, Anu.
And I will always be."

442
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:48,794
At least try to rebel against those
who shackle you.

443
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:52,795
"The new world awaits you, Anu."

444
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:56,128
Get up... and grab it.

445
00:54:57,808 --> 00:54:59,799
"I love you, Anu."

446
00:55:00,477 --> 00:55:02,468
You have lived enough in fear.

447
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:06,477
I'll wait for you at the party.

448
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:11,744
You will raise your voice in
that monster's presence.

449
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:18,086
"Wake up, Anu...
A new life awaits you."

450
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:50,786
"I will forsake this world
in my love for you"

451
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:59,298
"I will forget this world
in my love for you"

452
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:05,237
"Even if the world is an enemy,
do not ever forget me..."

453
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:12,472
"I'll destroy myself...
in my love for you"

454
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:21,256
"I'll forget this world
in my love for you"

455
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:30,090
"I'll forsake this world
in my love for you"

456
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:35,604
"I'll never leave,
I'll never break my promise"

457
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:43,110
"I'll destroy myself
in my love for you"

458
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:51,778
"I'll forget this world
in my love for you"

459
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:27,488
"In my breath lingers
your fragrance..."

460
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:31,750
"in my heart beats
your heart"

461
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:36,489
my life lies in your arms

462
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:41,101
"My eyes are but
a reflection of you"

463
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:45,771
"Without you, I'm worth nothing"

464
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:49,502
"Without you, I'm worth nothing"

465
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:57,277
"Every sorrow I will bear,
in love with you"

466
00:57:59,456 --> 00:58:03,222
"I'll never leave you,
I'll never break my promise..."

467
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:10,457
"I'll destroy myself
in love with you"

468
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:19,236
"I'll forget the world
in love with you"

469
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:51,267
"Let me hold you
to my bosom"

470
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,438
I'm crazy about you

471
00:58:56,112 --> 00:59:00,208
From meeting you...

472
00:59:00,717 --> 00:59:04,209
"how will the world
ever prevent me?"

473
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:08,452
I'll never leave you

474
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,222
I'll never leave you

475
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:17,462
"I'll give up everything
I possess..."

476
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:21,469
in my love for you

477
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,074
"Even if the world is an enemy,
do not ever forget me..."

478
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:34,480
"I'll destroy myself...
in my love for you"

479
00:59:36,253 --> 00:59:43,250
"I'll forget this world
in my love for you"

480
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:49,095
"I'll never leave,
I'll never break my promise..."

481
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:57,105
"I'll destroy myself
in my love for you"

482
00:59:58,108 --> 01:00:05,276
"I'll forget this world
in my love for you"

483
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:10,283
In love with you...

484
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:14,280
In love with you...

485
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:18,784
"Rahul! Police!
- Run, Anu!"

486
01:00:19,296 --> 01:00:23,289
"Sir, forgive them! Forgive them!"

487
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,533
They've done nothing!
They've not done anything!

488
01:01:09,512 --> 01:01:14,108
"Enough! Enough, Anu...
We don't need to run anymore."

489
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:18,110
We've come pretty far already.

490
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:35,794
Is this... the heavens?

491
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:50,809
Yes. This is heaven.

492
01:02:05,268 --> 01:02:07,259
How'd I know where he is?

493
01:02:07,437 --> 01:02:10,770
"Who'd know about your friend,
if not you?"

494
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:14,266
"Inspector, may I ask you something?
- Go ahead."

495
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:18,106
Do you know where your father is
right now and what he's up to?

496
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:21,512
It's only a question. Do you know?
- No.

497
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:25,778
Exactly! So how would I know where
Rahul is and what he's doing?

498
01:02:26,122 --> 01:02:29,785
"A valid question, isn't it?
- It's all right. You can go now."

499
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:31,787
"Thank you, sir."

500
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,120
Excuse me.

501
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:44,530
"Constable, keep an eye on him."

502
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,776
Don't you get it?

503
01:03:32,522 --> 01:03:36,515
Beat it! Get lost!

504
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:43,289
If anyone even touches her...
I'll break his hands.

505
01:04:07,757 --> 01:04:11,249
"Run away, Anu...
for my sake! Escape!"

506
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:30,768
"You touched Anu with
these hands, didn't you?"

507
01:05:31,107 --> 01:05:33,507
You'll never be able to touch
another woman with these hands again!

508
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:35,767
Not another woman!

509
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:35,767
"My love, sweetheart..."

510
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:41,505
"My love, sweetheart..."

511
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:47,773
"My love, I swear it on you..."

512
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:53,518
"I'll die, if I don't have you"

513
01:06:54,123 --> 01:06:58,526
"My love, I swear it on you..."

514
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:04,066
"I'll die, if I don't have you"

515
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:09,734
"How will the world
ever stop us?"

516
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:15,467
"Even in death,
we'll keep our promise"

517
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,482
"My love, sweetheart...
I swear it on you"

518
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:26,085
"should I not have you...
I'll die of grief, my love"

519
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:53,271
"With flowers, buds and stars, I'll
adorn you and take you for my bride"

520
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:04,449
"With flowers, buds and stars, I'll
adorn you and take you for my bride"

521
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:09,721
"The beautiful fragrance of Spring,
I'll give to you"

522
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:14,459
I'm in love with you...

523
01:08:16,072 --> 01:08:20,736
"and I take deep breaths, my love"

524
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:26,075
I take deep breaths...

525
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:32,250
"My love, sweetheart,
I swear it on you..."

526
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:37,753
"if I don't have you,
I'll die of grief"

527
01:08:38,594 --> 01:08:43,258
"My love, sweetheart,
I swear it on you..."

528
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:48,764
"if I don't have you,
I'll die of grief"

529
01:09:21,737 --> 01:09:27,073
"Without you, how have
I spent my nights and days"

530
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:38,250
"Without you, how have
I spent my nights and days"

531
01:09:39,088 --> 01:09:43,752
"What secrets do I hold in
my heart? Don't even ask me"

532
01:09:44,594 --> 01:09:48,758
When two hearts beat together...

533
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:54,259
this is just how they pine

534
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:59,771
They pine... they indeed do

535
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:06,271
"My love, sweetheart,
I swear it on you..."

536
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:11,780
"if I do not have you,
I'll die of grief"

537
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:17,519
"How will the world
ever stop us?"

538
01:10:18,294 --> 01:10:23,288
"Even in death,
we will keep our promise"

539
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:28,133
"My love, my sweetheart...
I swear it on you"

540
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:33,798
"If I do not have,
I'll die of grief"

541
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:38,145
My love... sweetheart...

542
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:43,550
My love... sweetheart...

543
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:48,820
My love... sweetheart

544
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:54,557
My love... sweetheart

545
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,266
You're going to have me killed
some day! I've arranged for a car.

546
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:02,095
We've got to reach Bombay.
Come on.

547
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:05,263
"Come on, Anu.
- We've got to reach Bombay."

548
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:10,768
"Rahul! It's the police!
Run away, Rahul! Run away!"

549
01:11:11,113 --> 01:11:13,104
Go away!

550
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:23,114
You're under arrest.

551
01:11:23,793 --> 01:11:27,285
You can't take Anu away from me!
She belongs to me!

552
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:31,796
"Don't be afraid, Anu!
Nothing will happen to you."

553
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:34,796
"I'll be coming, Anu...
I love you!"

554
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:38,296
"Nothing will happen to you!
I love you, Anu!"

555
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,532
"I love you, Anu!"

556
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:47,809
"Don't be afraid, Anu!
I'll certainly come back!"

557
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:53,311
Forgive him this once.
He won't make this mistake again.

558
01:11:55,825 --> 01:11:59,556
"You're being released on bail.
But don't do this again, okay?"

559
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:04,264
I'll do it a thousand times.
And no one can stop me.

560
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,501
"To fall in love is no sin,
Inspector."

561
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,501
What did you say?
- Inspector! Relax! Sit down.

562
01:12:12,108 --> 01:12:16,272
Are you out of your mind? You talk
like this with the Inspector?

563
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:20,278
"Aren't you ashamed! One slap,
and I'll straighten you out!"

564
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:25,516
"Don't mind him, Inspector. The chill
here has driven him a bit mad."

565
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:30,622
But he's okay. No problem.
I assure you...

566
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:34,786
he won't make this mistake again.
I'll take him away right now.

567
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:37,122
"Take him away.
- Good bye, sir."

568
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:41,135
"Let's go away before he changes
his mind. Good bye, sir."

569
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:45,638
I wonder what Anu's going through
in Bombay. Try to understand.

570
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:48,538
"Thank you, sir. Good bye, sir."

571
01:12:52,148 --> 01:12:57,814
"Anu, what you have done is
not worthy of forgiveness."

572
01:12:59,822 --> 01:13:02,256
But since the managing
committee of the institution...

573
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:08,259
"has nothing against you, you are
being given another opportunity."

574
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:12,090
"But we have a condition, Anu."

575
01:13:12,268 --> 01:13:15,499
You must forget Rahul...

576
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:23,272
and all the shameful things
you did with him.

577
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:28,777
"To maintain the solemnity of this
sacred place, you must do that."

578
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,283
"Do you agree, Anu?"

579
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,792
"I know I have come to be
a burden on you, sir."

580
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:49,293
Perhaps you can bear this burden...

581
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:58,138
"but the condition you have set
before me, I cannot fulfill."

582
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:07,246
Looks like it's time for me to face
the consequences for what I've done.

583
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,094
"As far as our knowledge goes,
you have just one relative"

584
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:18,089
A distant relative

585
01:14:22,772 --> 01:14:25,263
After meeting him...

586
01:14:25,775 --> 01:14:28,505
maybe you'll change your decision
about leaving this place.

587
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:33,112
No...

588
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:36,109
anyway...

589
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:41,784
here he is. Uncle Peter.

590
01:14:54,136 --> 01:14:57,799
"Don't worry, Anu.
This is only the beginning."

591
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:03,077
"The moment you step in the outside
world, you will discover..."

592
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:09,073
how mercilessly life puts you
through difficulties.

593
01:15:11,086 --> 01:15:15,250
"And remember, this obsession
of love you're suffering from..."

594
01:15:17,259 --> 01:15:22,492
"time will rid you of it,
even if starvation doesn't."

595
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:25,756
All the best.

596
01:15:52,795 --> 01:15:54,786
Where is Anu?

597
01:15:55,798 --> 01:15:58,130
How dare you come in here
like this?

598
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:01,065
Where have you sent Anu?

599
01:16:01,737 --> 01:16:04,729
"I can't believe you
are the same lover..."

600
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:08,066
"who shouted himself hoarse
in the valleys, screaming..."

601
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:11,736
you'd find Anu from
any corner of the world.

602
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,483
What went wrong with
the power of your love?

603
01:16:17,086 --> 01:16:19,077
You've accepted defeat already?

604
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:25,254
This is no time for jokes.
I want to know where Anu is.

605
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:30,261
"Okay... I'll tell you,
if you're getting upset."

606
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:37,103
But I won't tell you so easily
and offend your manhood.

607
01:16:39,775 --> 01:16:45,771
"In this area of Bombay city,
lives Anu's uncle, Peter."

608
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:50,513
"Anu now lives with this
depraved, drunken man."

609
01:16:51,787 --> 01:16:58,283
So go on... roam these streets.
Shout as loudly as you can.

610
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:02,053
Maybe she'll hear your voice.

611
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:07,225
"What are you doing, Rahul?
Have you gone mad?"

612
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:09,463
I'll go mad if I don't find her.

613
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:13,230
"You won't find Anu if you
shout like this, will you?"

614
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:18,073
If there's anything true
about my love and my cries...

615
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:20,738
she will certainly hear my voice.
She will!

616
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:04,716
My love... sweetheart...

617
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:09,053
Sweetheart

618
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:11,556
Sweetheart

619
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:20,474
My love... sweetheart

620
01:18:22,277 --> 01:18:24,472
Sweetheart

621
01:18:25,748 --> 01:18:27,739
Sweetheart

622
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:41,486
My love... sweetheart

623
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,423
Sweetheart

624
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:47,759
Sweetheart

625
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:55,506
My love... sweetheart

626
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:59,103
Sweetheart

627
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:04,212
Sweetheart

628
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:35,475
"My love, sweetheart...
I swear it on you"

629
01:19:36,085 --> 01:19:41,489
"I'll die of grief,
if I don't find you"

630
01:19:42,191 --> 01:19:46,753
"My love, sweetheart,
I swear it on you..."

631
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:52,263
"I'll die of grief,
if I don't find you"

632
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:58,496
How will the world ever stop us?

633
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:03,777
"Even in death,
we will keep our promise"

634
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:09,109
"My love, sweetheart...
I swear it on you"

635
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:15,119
"I will die,
if I do not find you"

636
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:20,287
"I will die,
if I do not find you"

637
01:20:21,463 --> 01:20:25,126
My love... sweetheart...

638
01:20:26,802 --> 01:20:30,533
My love... sweetheart...

639
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:36,136
My love... sweetheart...

640
01:20:38,147 --> 01:20:41,548
My love... sweetheart...

641
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:12,276
"Now listen, Peter. I'm not letting
Anu stay with you, come what may."

642
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:16,512
Whatever happens.
- How won't you let her be with me?

643
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,111
I'm her legal guardian.
I have a right over her.

644
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:24,117
"Hey uncle! You can't fend for
yourself, what will you feed her?"

645
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:29,791
She's going to fend for me.

646
01:21:30,532 --> 01:21:34,525
"Dubai. If I send her away to Dubai,
there's lots of money to be made."

647
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:37,298
As if it's so easy to
send her away to Dubai!

648
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:41,632
It's okay if she doesn't go to Dubai.
I'll find her bit roles in films here.

649
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:44,802
She'll make no less than
50 or 60 rupees a day!

650
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:49,811
"For a drunkard like me,
50 or 60 bucks is a lot of money."

651
01:21:50,252 --> 01:21:52,152
"She'll earn, and
I'll sit back and eat."

652
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:55,314
"I'll knock your teeth out!
- One moment, Rahul. Relax!"

653
01:21:55,557 --> 01:21:58,321
I'll toss you over
if you say a thing like that!

654
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,494
You're bullying me? Bullying me?

655
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:03,593
I'll call the police!
I'll go to the courts!

656
01:22:03,765 --> 01:22:05,756
That girl's my property!
I'm not letting her go!

657
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:08,496
"All right... shut up, will you?"

658
01:22:09,504 --> 01:22:11,768
"Relax, Rahul. Cool down, okay?"

659
01:22:12,107 --> 01:22:15,270
"I understand his language.
I'm the Gujarati, after all."

660
01:22:16,778 --> 01:22:20,771
"Now listen, Peter. We'll pay
you 10,000 rupees, that's all."

661
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:24,775
"10,000 rupees. Not a penny more.
But you must forget about the girl."

662
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:28,518
"What?
- Make it 15,000, okay?"

663
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:33,288
"15,000?
Okay, make it 20,000. That's final"

664
01:22:33,528 --> 01:22:35,519
Don't ask for anything more.

665
01:22:36,131 --> 01:22:38,531
Here's the dough.
20000

666
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:43,627
Don't touch the money.
Sign the documents first.

667
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:46,130
"Master, give me the papers."

668
01:22:50,145 --> 01:22:52,136
Sign this.

669
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:58,813
"Don't touch the money, I said.
Sign the papers first. Here."

670
01:23:03,258 --> 01:23:07,490
Go on. Get lost.

671
01:23:28,784 --> 01:23:34,120
And now?
- What else? You're free now!

672
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:38,789
This tailor here...
he's your guardian now.

673
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:41,519
Peter has gone.
He signed the papers and left.

674
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:45,793
"Go anywhere you wish, stay where
you want to. Do anything you wish!"

675
01:23:47,536 --> 01:23:51,802
Anu will live with my mother.
In my house.

676
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:58,135
"No, Rahul. I don't want to be
a burden on your mother."

677
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:04,241
"Even at the orphanage, I was
a burden on them."

678
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:08,079
"Now that I'm out,
I'm a burden on all of you."

679
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,252
I've begun to hate myself.

680
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:17,755
For how long will I live under the
obligation of others? For how long?

681
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:23,096
You guys have done
so much for me.

682
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:27,105
So what's the big deal?
For the first time...

683
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:29,268
I've put my father's money
to good use.

684
01:24:29,511 --> 01:24:31,502
"What do you say, Rahul?"

685
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:34,772
I have a request to make
to all of you.

686
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:40,511
"If you really want to help me,
let me stand on my own two feet."

687
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:50,288
Find a place for me to live in...
and a job. That's all.

688
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:55,797
Wow! What a self-respecting girl!

689
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,734
"Hats off to you, dear...
what a great thing you've said."

690
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:31,595
Before my eyes...

691
01:25:33,108 --> 01:25:35,269
close to my heart...

692
01:25:36,211 --> 01:25:39,112
Before my eyes...

693
01:25:39,514 --> 01:25:41,505
close to my heart...

694
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:45,279
there is someone...

695
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:49,786
and that's you

696
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:52,783
Before my eyes...

697
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:55,519
close to my heart...

698
01:25:56,798 --> 01:25:59,289
Before my eyes...

699
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:02,065
close to my heart...

700
01:26:03,071 --> 01:26:06,063
there is someone...

701
01:26:08,076 --> 01:26:10,237
and that's you

702
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:13,240
Before my eyes...

703
01:26:14,082 --> 01:26:16,243
close to my heart...

704
01:26:42,444 --> 01:26:47,780
"What does it mean to pine?
My heart knows better"

705
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:57,524
"What does it mean to pine?
Ask my heart"

706
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:03,559
"From a large gathering,
I return so lonely"

707
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,233
I might even die...

708
01:27:10,472 --> 01:27:13,066
I might even die...

709
01:27:13,808 --> 01:27:17,574
if I were separated from you

710
01:27:18,346 --> 01:27:20,473
Before my eyes...

711
01:27:21,249 --> 01:27:23,479
close to my heart...

712
01:27:24,486 --> 01:27:27,250
Before my eyes...

713
01:27:27,756 --> 01:27:30,486
close to my heart...

714
01:27:31,092 --> 01:27:34,084
there is someone...

715
01:27:36,097 --> 01:27:38,497
and that's you

716
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,500
Before my eyes...

717
01:27:42,103 --> 01:27:44,264
close to my heart...

718
01:28:23,411 --> 01:28:28,747
"Loneliness won't let me live;
I feel restless"

719
01:28:33,154 --> 01:28:38,490
"Loneliness won't let me live,
I feel restless"

720
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:44,596
"I feel afraid
when I don't meet you"

721
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:49,500
Don't ever leave me...

722
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:57,510
"Don't ever leave me
and go away"

723
01:28:59,514 --> 01:29:01,709
Before my eyes...

724
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:04,441
close to my heart...

725
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,211
Before my eyes...

726
01:29:08,723 --> 01:29:10,714
close to my heart...

727
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:15,223
there is someone...

728
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,226
and that's you

729
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:22,229
Before my eyes...

730
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:25,232
close to my heart...

731
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:28,732
Before my eyes...

732
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:31,735
close to my heart...

733
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,743
there is someone...

734
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:40,084
and that's you

735
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:20,283
"We've finished the selection
in Madras, Delhi and Calcutta."

736
01:30:20,795 --> 01:30:24,788
But we haven't found a singer in
Bombay. What's happening here?

737
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:29,297
"Relax, sir. It'll all happen.
- When will it happen? When?"

738
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,541
Excuse me...

739
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:47,144
will you please get up?

740
01:30:47,655 --> 01:30:49,145
Get up

741
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:57,554
Yes! This is the face!

742
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:00,498
"Mr Padamsee...
- Yes, sir?"

743
01:31:00,602 --> 01:31:03,503
She's here for the audition.
Talk to her.

744
01:31:06,775 --> 01:31:09,608
Lucky girl!
- May I know what's it all about?

745
01:31:09,778 --> 01:31:13,111
"Sure, I'll explain.
And you are?"

746
01:31:13,281 --> 01:31:16,773
"Rahul. Rahul Roy, sir.
And this is Anu Varghese."

747
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:20,519
Nice to meet you both.
And that was Mr Paul.

748
01:31:21,122 --> 01:31:25,115
He's here from Paris to
choose Indian models...

749
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:30,129
"and he thinks you can take part
in the competition, if you wish to"

750
01:31:30,465 --> 01:31:34,128
But I... I was here
looking for a typist's job.

751
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:40,531
"Typist? You don't know. If you're
chosen, you'll go places"

752
01:31:40,809 --> 01:31:44,142
The sky is the limit!
- But I...

753
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:48,311
There's no time to think.
The audition takes place next week.

754
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:52,142
"Thank you, Mr Padamsee.
Anu will surely participate."

755
01:32:11,452 --> 01:32:15,445
Wow! What a gait!
She's too much!

756
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:19,955
Shut up! That's no dress...
she looks like a witch!

757
01:32:30,471 --> 01:32:36,467
"And look at her, Master! Wow!
- Stop barking like a dog!"

758
01:32:37,978 --> 01:32:42,472
Wait for Anu... she's going to
knock them all over! All of them!

759
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:26,953
Thank you.

760
01:33:31,698 --> 01:33:37,967
"As we all know, we're all here
to choose an Indian model..."

761
01:33:38,305 --> 01:33:41,468
for Paris's Jean Cardin.

762
01:33:42,643 --> 01:33:45,976
There's a special announcement.
On behalf of Jean Cardin...

763
01:33:46,313 --> 01:33:49,646
"the chosen model will be given
an advance of 100,000 rupees..."

764
01:33:49,816 --> 01:33:55,652
and a flat to live in.
And also a free tour of Europe!

765
01:33:57,424 --> 01:33:59,654
"So get a hold on your hearts,
friends."

766
01:33:59,927 --> 01:34:04,261
The model we have chosen
today is...

767
01:34:05,432 --> 01:34:06,922
Miss...

768
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:10,435
Miss Anu Varghese

769
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:29,278
Congratulations.

770
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:51,468
I had heard a story as a child.
That of the Prince of Dreams...

771
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:58,919
who took the hand of an ugly orphan
and turned her into a beautiful fairy.

772
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:05,915
Some stories turn out to be true.
Atleast in my case.

773
01:35:09,429 --> 01:35:13,661
The one who gave me a sense of
belonging and made me feel wanted...

774
01:35:13,767 --> 01:35:15,758
was Rahul.

775
01:35:17,938 --> 01:35:20,930
"Rahul, please come here."

776
01:35:23,944 --> 01:35:25,935
And take my hand before this crowd.

777
01:36:01,982 --> 01:36:07,921
My heart beats for you

778
01:36:15,429 --> 01:36:17,420
It beats for you

779
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:26,663
"The sight of you makes
my heart skip a beat"

780
01:36:34,281 --> 01:36:36,272
It skips a beat

781
01:37:07,647 --> 01:37:12,414
"Come to me.
I want to kiss your lips"

782
01:37:12,986 --> 01:37:17,650
How will I tell you what I want

783
01:37:21,762 --> 01:37:26,665
"Come to me.
I want to kiss your lips"

784
01:37:27,267 --> 01:37:31,931
How will I tell you what I want

785
01:37:33,373 --> 01:37:38,436
"Press it in your arms,
this fair-skinned body"

786
01:37:38,945 --> 01:37:43,678
"How else will I quench
this fire within?"

787
01:37:44,951 --> 01:37:50,947
A fire rages in my heart

788
01:37:58,632 --> 01:38:00,623
A fire rages

789
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:42,435
"What heartache is this?
It's a new pain"

790
01:38:43,276 --> 01:38:48,270
"It's a realisation that
you have come of age"

791
01:38:52,285 --> 01:38:56,619
"What heartache is this?
It's a new pain"

792
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:02,225
"It's a realisation that
you have come of age"

793
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:08,395
Love intoxicates me

794
01:39:08,902 --> 01:39:13,635
"It's fun, my love"

795
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:20,904
"I can't control my heart,
no matter how much I try"

796
01:39:28,655 --> 01:39:30,646
I can't control it

797
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:39,656
My heart beats for you

798
01:39:47,274 --> 01:39:49,674
It beats for you

799
01:40:05,225 --> 01:40:10,891
"Anu, I can't control myself anymore.
Let's get married."

800
01:40:13,233 --> 01:40:15,224
Anytime you wish to.

801
01:40:19,239 --> 01:40:21,230
"I love you, Anu."

802
01:40:34,988 --> 01:40:37,252
You're better than
I was told you are.

803
01:40:38,258 --> 01:40:41,659
What?
- I'm Rahul's mother.

804
01:40:48,602 --> 01:40:50,593
Please come in.

805
01:40:53,873 --> 01:40:58,367
"It's a good thing to achieve so much
at such a young age, my child."

806
01:40:59,212 --> 01:41:02,875
"In fact, it's necessary for women
to stand on their own feet."

807
01:41:05,218 --> 01:41:07,618
"What would I have done,
if I didn't have a job?"

808
01:41:11,224 --> 01:41:13,215
"Don't ever stop working, dear."

809
01:41:14,894 --> 01:41:19,228
"What will you have? Tea or coffee?
- Nothing, Anu. Sit down."

810
01:41:26,906 --> 01:41:29,898
"It's like this, Anu.
I'm Rahul's mother."

811
01:41:31,411 --> 01:41:33,402
I wouldn't wish the two
of you anything bad.

812
01:41:35,248 --> 01:41:39,912
But the haste the two of you
are showing you to get married...

813
01:41:41,254 --> 01:41:47,250
is bad for your love
and for your future.

814
01:41:47,594 --> 01:41:49,585
I don't understand.

815
01:41:51,765 --> 01:41:57,431
Have you ever wondered why Rahul
never brought you to meet me?

816
01:41:58,938 --> 01:42:01,270
"Well...
- Look, Anu."

817
01:42:01,941 --> 01:42:05,672
"Rahul can lie to the whole world,
even to himself..."

818
01:42:06,279 --> 01:42:08,270
but he can't tell lies to me.

819
01:42:08,448 --> 01:42:10,780
He knows he has not achieved
anything till now.

820
01:42:11,951 --> 01:42:13,282
He also realises that...

821
01:42:13,453 --> 01:42:16,786
there's suddenly a distance between
the two of you.

822
01:42:17,957 --> 01:42:20,949
"Anu, you make much
more money than he does."

823
01:42:22,529 --> 01:42:25,965
"You have a name in society,
an identity of your own."

824
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:32,294
But Rahul is looked at
as only your boyfriend.

825
01:42:33,306 --> 01:42:35,706
The fiance of a successful model.

826
01:42:36,309 --> 01:42:38,470
"Mother...
- It sounds bitter, my dear."

827
01:42:39,713 --> 01:42:45,481
But it's true. And if you want
to change things...

828
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:51,313
give Rahul some time.
I know he has the talent...

829
01:42:51,491 --> 01:42:53,425
and ability to achieve something.

830
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,752
"Rahul will pressurise you
to get married, Anu."

831
01:42:57,764 --> 01:42:59,755
"Because now that
you are a success..."

832
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:03,431
the fear of losing you
haunts him all the time.

833
01:43:05,438 --> 01:43:07,429
"I'll tell you something
out of experience, my dear."

834
01:43:08,274 --> 01:43:13,268
A relationship succeeds only when
the people involved are equals.

835
01:43:16,683 --> 01:43:20,949
That's it then.
This is all I wanted to say.

836
01:43:22,956 --> 01:43:26,289
And don't tell Rahul that we
have talked about these things.

837
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:29,451
He won't be able to understand.

838
01:43:39,706 --> 01:43:42,470
"Okay, Rahul. Say hi to Anu
on my behalf."

839
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:44,301
Okay.
- Bye.

840
01:43:44,477 --> 01:43:46,468
"One moment, Pallo."

841
01:43:47,714 --> 01:43:49,978
Give me a hundred rupees.
- Sure.

842
01:43:50,483 --> 01:43:53,919
I'll have to take a cab
to drop Anu home.

843
01:43:55,922 --> 01:43:59,756
"I now owe you 26,535 rupees, okay?"

844
01:44:00,426 --> 01:44:03,259
"I told you, Rahul. There are
no accounts between friends."

845
01:44:03,363 --> 01:44:05,763
"You can have more, if you wish.
- No, this is enough."

846
01:44:07,267 --> 01:44:09,428
Anu's a big model now.

847
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:13,671
I don't like to take her out
in crowded buses and trains.

848
01:44:15,275 --> 01:44:17,266
I'd rather take money from you.

849
01:44:17,377 --> 01:44:23,941
But I can't take advantage of the
success my future wife has made.

850
01:44:24,684 --> 01:44:27,778
"I understand. Okay...
- Thanks, buddy."

851
01:44:28,288 --> 01:44:29,778
Bye.
- See you.

852
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:33,450
"Anu, turn this side... turn left.
More life!"

853
01:44:35,295 --> 01:44:37,456
Vibrant! Yes!

854
01:44:38,298 --> 01:44:40,698
Excuse me... whom do you
wish to meet?

855
01:44:41,301 --> 01:44:43,701
I'm here to meet Anu.
- You can't meet her right now.

856
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:46,302
You can ask if you wish...
- She's busy right now.

857
01:44:46,706 --> 01:44:48,697
Please go out. Please.

858
01:44:51,311 --> 01:44:53,302
"Salil, he's with me."

859
01:44:53,413 --> 01:44:57,907
"Salil, you stupid donkey!
Don't you know how to talk to people?"

860
01:44:58,418 --> 01:45:00,409
Come and sit down here!

861
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,650
"Sorry, Rahul. Really sorry.
- It's all right."

862
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:10,652
Wait... wait.

863
01:45:12,665 --> 01:45:16,260
"Take your hand up, please.
Yes, that's it."

864
01:45:19,672 --> 01:45:21,264
That's it.

865
01:45:22,275 --> 01:45:24,266
"It's okay, thank you.
I'll do it."

866
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:30,943
That's it... a close-up.
Come on.

867
01:45:33,953 --> 01:45:35,944
Okay. Hold on.

868
01:45:36,689 --> 01:45:39,954
"Anu, get into the swimming costume.
- What?"

869
01:45:40,293 --> 01:45:42,022
Hurry up.
- Swimming costume?

870
01:45:42,462 --> 01:45:44,453
Anu's not wearing
that swimming costume.

871
01:45:48,301 --> 01:45:51,964
Hello! Who asked you?

872
01:45:52,705 --> 01:45:54,639
Don't disturb us.
Let us get on with our work.

873
01:45:55,408 --> 01:45:57,239
"Okay, get on with your work."

874
01:45:57,410 --> 01:46:00,243
"But Anu's not wearing that
swimming costume, I said."

875
01:46:01,247 --> 01:46:05,650
"Mr Padamsee, what's going on?
I say, what's going on?"

876
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:12,248
"Rahul, come on... it's all right.
Take it easy, Rahul."

877
01:46:12,659 --> 01:46:16,254
"Come, let's have some coffee.
- No."

878
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:19,421
"Anu, you will not
wear those clothes."

879
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:22,259
Hold it!

880
01:46:22,435 --> 01:46:24,426
Who the hell are you
to tell us that?

881
01:46:24,938 --> 01:46:28,669
"Anu, tell them who I am."

882
01:46:29,442 --> 01:46:32,434
"Okay, if you won't tell them,
I will."

883
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,680
I'm Anu's fiance. We're going
to get married very soon.

884
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:39,282
"I don't understand what
he's saying, Anu."

885
01:46:39,686 --> 01:46:42,678
Haven't you told him?
According to our contract with you...

886
01:46:42,789 --> 01:46:46,452
"you can't marry for another 2 years.
- But, sir..."

887
01:46:46,693 --> 01:46:48,684
Salil! Get that
file of the contract.

888
01:46:50,296 --> 01:46:52,287
Hurry up.

889
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:57,392
Is it true that you've signed
a contract like that?

890
01:46:57,904 --> 01:46:59,394
Without even telling me?

891
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:01,903
"And I've been dreaming of marriage,
like a fool!"

892
01:47:02,642 --> 01:47:05,406
"I've been busy making arrangements!
- Please calm down, Rahul."

893
01:47:05,912 --> 01:47:09,404
I'll explain everything later.
- Not later!

894
01:47:09,515 --> 01:47:12,643
Tell me right now!
What's happening here?

895
01:47:13,252 --> 01:47:15,243
Why have you done this?

896
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:28,663
"Rahul, you know how important it is
for me to achieve something in life."

897
01:47:30,269 --> 01:47:34,262
"To achieve that,
I had to sign this contract."

898
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:39,275
"All right, so break this contract.
Just leave them! Come with me, Anu."

899
01:47:39,445 --> 01:47:41,436
"It isn't so easy to break
a contract, Rahul."

900
01:47:41,681 --> 01:47:45,674
"I'm talking to Anu, not you!
Don't interrupt!"

901
01:47:47,787 --> 01:47:54,215
"Let's go, Anu. Come on.
- No, Rahul. I can't do that."

902
01:47:59,632 --> 01:48:02,226
"All right, I understand."

903
01:48:04,237 --> 01:48:07,638
I understand everything.

904
01:48:22,655 --> 01:48:25,647
"Don't worry, Anu.
You've done the right thing."

905
01:48:26,659 --> 01:48:30,925
This is in your interest and ours.
- You won't understand.

906
01:48:34,267 --> 01:48:36,667
"I didn't do this for myself,
nor for the contract."

907
01:48:39,939 --> 01:48:43,670
I've done all this only for Rahul.

908
01:48:45,945 --> 01:48:47,936
Only for him.

909
01:49:40,766 --> 01:49:44,668
"Anu, I will meet you only when
I get to be something in life"

910
01:49:45,671 --> 01:49:50,438
"If I don't make it big...
do forget me. Forever."

911
01:49:51,277 --> 01:49:52,437
- Rahul

912
01:50:18,404 --> 01:50:21,237
Without you...

913
01:50:22,408 --> 01:50:24,399
I will live

914
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:31,410
"I will swallow the poison
that my life is"

915
01:50:32,585 --> 01:50:38,922
"It doesn't matter
if I'm heart-broken"

916
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:45,925
"It doesn't matter
if I'm heart-broken"

917
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:51,668
Without you...

918
01:50:53,272 --> 01:50:55,365
I will live

919
01:50:56,609 --> 01:51:02,377
"I will swallow the poison
that my life is"

920
01:51:04,217 --> 01:51:06,208
"That's wonderful, young man!"

921
01:51:06,552 --> 01:51:12,616
Your voice has the feeling and
pain I have been looking for.

922
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:21,389
At last! You have been introduced
to love and pain.

923
01:51:22,401 --> 01:51:24,892
Want to know who I am?

924
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:29,231
I'm Bashir Khan.

925
01:51:29,642 --> 01:51:32,406
"On behalf of Super Cassettes
Industries, it's my duty..."

926
01:51:32,645 --> 01:51:34,636
to show new artists
the way to stardom.

927
01:51:35,248 --> 01:51:40,242
Come with me and I will take you
to the place you deserve.

928
01:51:40,653 --> 01:51:42,245
Come on.

929
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:53,665
What has your love given me?

930
01:51:54,433 --> 01:52:00,929
"I loved you and
you were unfaithful"

931
01:52:02,008 --> 01:52:08,675
"It was my mistake...
what did I seek?"

932
01:52:09,282 --> 01:52:15,687
"I expected love
from an unfaithful girl"

933
01:52:15,955 --> 01:52:19,288
"How will you know
what pining is?"

934
01:52:20,393 --> 01:52:22,953
You are selfish and insensitive

935
01:52:23,963 --> 01:52:26,693
"Go away, heartless girl..."

936
01:52:27,466 --> 01:52:30,299
I have seen your love

937
01:52:31,370 --> 01:52:34,965
"I now know what you are,
O merciless one"

938
01:52:38,477 --> 01:52:40,968
Without you...

939
01:52:42,481 --> 01:52:44,711
I will live

940
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:51,723
"I will swallow the poison
that my life is"

941
01:52:55,995 --> 01:52:59,431
"How are you, Rahul? Speak up...
haven't heard you for so many days."

942
01:52:59,765 --> 01:53:01,926
What will I say?
- Say anything.

943
01:53:02,435 --> 01:53:04,665
Is someone else listening
to my voice too?

944
01:53:05,004 --> 01:53:09,668
What? Oh no.
I'm all alone.

945
01:53:10,276 --> 01:53:14,940
"Listen, Pallo.
I've known you for years."

946
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:17,945
I don't want anyone to
listen to my voice...

947
01:53:18,451 --> 01:53:21,284
nor do I want to listen
to anyone. That's it.

948
01:53:21,687 --> 01:53:27,956
"Little did I know that my beloved
would break the promises of love"

949
01:53:28,694 --> 01:53:35,293
"If only I knew what
you had on your mind"

950
01:53:36,469 --> 01:53:42,965
"I loved you so much.
I gave you my heart"

951
01:53:43,576 --> 01:53:49,981
"I was so naive,
I couldn't understand anything"

952
01:53:50,483 --> 01:53:53,418
I wept

953
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,920
Tears flowed from my eyes

954
01:53:57,923 --> 01:54:00,653
My shattered heart...

955
01:54:01,427 --> 01:54:04,260
is a sign of your love

956
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:09,424
"How will I ever forget
how unfaithful you were?"

957
01:54:12,938 --> 01:54:14,929
Without you...

958
01:54:16,675 --> 01:54:18,666
I will live

959
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:25,945
"I will swallow the poison
that my life is"

960
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:32,956
"It doesn't matter
if I'm heart-broken"

961
01:54:34,693 --> 01:54:40,290
"It doesn't matter
if I'm heart-broken"

962
01:54:43,903 --> 01:54:46,303
Without you...

963
01:54:47,973 --> 01:54:49,964
I will live

964
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:56,646
"I will swallow the poison
that my life is"

965
01:54:58,918 --> 01:55:00,909
I will live...

966
01:55:02,755 --> 01:55:04,916
I will live...

967
01:55:06,425 --> 01:55:08,655
I will live...

968
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:22,273
"Oh my God! I'm really sorry
I kept you waiting, Anu."

969
01:55:22,675 --> 01:55:24,666
"Two minutes more, okay?"

970
01:55:27,446 --> 01:55:30,438
Two minutes?
What do you mean?

971
01:55:31,684 --> 01:55:36,951
You've got to finalise artworks
of four of my music albums today.

972
01:55:37,356 --> 01:55:41,952
"Relax, just relax. Why do you get
serious with such things?"

973
01:55:42,461 --> 01:55:47,455
Atleast give me the pictures of
the singers and the other details.

974
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:49,292
Here.

975
01:55:53,639 --> 01:55:56,403
"What do I see, Mr Bashir?
- What?"

976
01:55:57,409 --> 01:56:01,903
Rahul Roy? Are you releasing
a record by him?

977
01:56:02,915 --> 01:56:05,907
"Yes. So what?
- Come on, Mr Bashir."

978
01:56:06,418 --> 01:56:09,910
Why're you encouraging
this two-penny singer?

979
01:56:10,656 --> 01:56:15,423
"As your marketing advisor,
it's my duty to advise you..."

980
01:56:15,528 --> 01:56:21,660
not to make such mistakes. It could
be damaging for your company's image.

981
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:27,261
"Mr Padamsee, please step out.
- One minute."

982
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:32,434
"I said, come with me.
I want to talk to you."

983
01:56:41,954 --> 01:56:43,945
What happened?

984
01:56:44,957 --> 01:56:48,290
A petty man shows
his pettiness...

985
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:51,691
when he unnecessarily casts
aspersions on someone's capabilities.

986
01:56:51,964 --> 01:56:53,295
What?

987
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:59,633
"I know why you hate Rahul.
- Yes, I hate Rahul."

988
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:04,403
What's this lifetime? I don't
spare my enemies in any lifetime.

989
01:57:04,643 --> 01:57:10,240
"When I'm around, not you, not the
whole world can do any harm to Rahul."

990
01:57:12,251 --> 01:57:16,915
"Mr Padamsee, if you try to
sabotage Rahul's album..."

991
01:57:18,424 --> 01:57:20,654
I'll break your contract
and walk out.

992
01:57:21,927 --> 01:57:25,260
"Don't threaten me, Anu.
Don't."

993
01:57:28,767 --> 01:57:30,257
What are you doing?

994
01:57:30,369 --> 01:57:32,428
"You have invested a lot
in my face, haven't you?"

995
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:38,273
You will have to release
Rahul's album.

996
01:57:40,279 --> 01:57:44,682
"Or else, I'll burn my face.
- No! No!"

997
01:57:44,950 --> 01:57:47,680
Go on.
- I'm going... don't do it!

998
01:58:01,233 --> 01:58:03,895
"Excuse me, sir.
May I come in?"

999
01:58:05,237 --> 01:58:08,638
"Welcome, Rahul Roy!
I've been thinking about you."

1000
01:58:08,741 --> 01:58:11,232
Where have you been?
I just didn't see you around.

1001
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:14,402
"I've been around, sir.
- What can I do for you?"

1002
01:58:14,647 --> 01:58:18,413
"I need some money, sir.
If I could have it?"

1003
01:58:18,917 --> 01:58:20,908
Some money?
- Yes.

1004
01:58:21,253 --> 01:58:23,244
If I could have a 1000 rupees.

1005
01:58:23,422 --> 01:58:28,655
"Is that all? Don't you know then?
- Know what, sir?"

1006
01:58:28,927 --> 01:58:34,263
"Look, we're getting reports from
our agents across the country."

1007
01:58:34,433 --> 01:58:37,664
Your song is a super-hit young man!
It's a super-hit.

1008
01:58:38,003 --> 01:58:43,669
"The chairman is going to give you a
gold disc and a cheque for 200,000!"

1009
01:58:44,443 --> 01:58:46,934
"Talk in terms of hundreds
of thousands, my friend."

1010
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:49,941
Not mere thousands!

1011
01:59:06,231 --> 01:59:08,222
Hello?
- Hello.

1012
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,391
"Have you received the flowers, Anu?"

1013
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:15,634
"Know what I'm celebrating?
I'm a star, Anu. I've become a star!"

1014
01:59:16,909 --> 01:59:21,243
"This evening, I'm getting a cheque
of 200,000 and a trophy."

1015
01:59:22,247 --> 01:59:24,647
"I've telephoned my mother,
Pallo and Master."

1016
01:59:24,917 --> 01:59:26,908
They'll meet me at the function.

1017
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:31,913
"As I promised, I'm coming over, Anu.
I'll have lunch with you."

1018
01:59:32,257 --> 01:59:34,418
"And we'll both leave for
the function, okay?"

1019
01:59:36,595 --> 01:59:38,654
"I love you, Anu. I love you."

1020
01:59:39,431 --> 01:59:42,662
I love you Rahul. I love you.

1021
01:59:50,776 --> 01:59:54,371
Like you need to breathe...

1022
01:59:55,214 --> 02:00:01,380
like you need to breathe to live...

1023
02:00:02,221 --> 02:00:08,217
"you need a beloved
to love"

1024
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:14,393
Like you need a lamp...

1025
02:00:15,901 --> 02:00:21,635
"like you need a lamp
for light..."

1026
02:00:22,407 --> 02:00:28,642
"you need a beloved
to fall in love with"

1027
02:00:31,650 --> 02:00:37,646
You need a beloved to love

1028
02:00:42,261 --> 02:00:43,660
Hi!

1029
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:46,659
Surprised?

1030
02:00:46,932 --> 02:00:52,427
Maybe you are surprised
to see me here. Right?

1031
02:00:53,705 --> 02:00:55,195
No?

1032
02:00:57,376 --> 02:01:02,211
"In fact, I wanted to surprise you.
So I landed here like this."

1033
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:05,873
Know what the surprise is?
- No.

1034
02:01:06,218 --> 02:01:10,382
"It is something like this. Anyway,
what's the point in harassing you?"

1035
02:01:14,393 --> 02:01:16,384
You're going to Paris!

1036
02:01:16,628 --> 02:01:20,621
This is a small gift from me.
Please...

1037
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:31,404
So you've already heard
about going to Paris?

1038
02:01:32,244 --> 02:01:35,407
I'm late. No problem.
It's all right.

1039
02:01:37,649 --> 02:01:41,415
"Sorry, sir. You must leave now.
I'm expecting someone."

1040
02:01:43,255 --> 02:01:45,246
These flowers are to celebrate
Rahul's success.

1041
02:01:45,657 --> 02:01:48,421
He's coming over for lunch.
- So I've come at the wrong time?

1042
02:01:49,361 --> 02:01:53,263
"Now listen to me. In 15 days,
you're going with me to Paris."

1043
02:01:53,432 --> 02:01:56,924
Although I don't want to interfere
with your personal life...

1044
02:01:57,436 --> 02:02:01,668
I must tell you something.
The less you see of Rahul...

1045
02:02:02,274 --> 02:02:04,765
the better it will be
for your career.

1046
02:02:05,444 --> 02:02:10,939
"From today, Rahul is my life and
my career. I'm in love with him..."

1047
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:14,680
and we're going to get married
very soon.

1048
02:02:14,953 --> 02:02:20,687
No! You know very well Anu that you
can't marry for another 2 years.

1049
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:25,293
You have signed a contract with me.
If you try to break the contract...

1050
02:02:25,697 --> 02:02:29,963
"it'll be very bad for you.
- Do what you want to do, Padamsee."

1051
02:02:30,702 --> 02:02:32,966
I don't care.

1052
02:02:34,973 --> 02:02:39,467
Rahul has become a very big singer.
He'll fight you in the courts.

1053
02:02:41,713 --> 02:02:43,704
"I'm not one of those
who take defeat, Anu."

1054
02:02:44,316 --> 02:02:46,307
I'll be too much to handle
for the two of you.

1055
02:02:47,486 --> 02:02:49,477
Remember that.

1056
02:02:50,722 --> 02:02:52,713
Mr Padamsee...

1057
02:02:56,428 --> 02:03:00,421
take this as you go.
There's no room for this either.

1058
02:03:05,671 --> 02:03:07,662
Never mind.

1059
02:03:24,289 --> 02:03:26,951
"Hello, Mr Rahul Roy.
Congratulations!"

1060
02:03:30,295 --> 02:03:36,461
But I wonder if I must congratulate
you or your fiancee.

1061
02:03:37,302 --> 02:03:40,294
"I'm talking about Anu.
- It's one and the same thing, sir."

1062
02:03:40,706 --> 02:03:46,975
"Oh yes. Behind every successful man,
there is a woman."

1063
02:03:47,079 --> 02:03:49,309
And this adage you have proved
to be true today.

1064
02:03:49,648 --> 02:03:51,980
"What do you mean?
- Come on, Rahul."

1065
02:03:52,317 --> 02:03:56,913
Don't pretend not to know.
You aren't so innocent.

1066
02:03:58,256 --> 02:04:01,419
"Come to the point, Mr Padamsee.
What are you getting at?"

1067
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:07,656
Just that you used Anu very well
to scale the ladder of success.

1068
02:04:08,667 --> 02:04:13,263
I must compliment you for that.
Had Anu not forced me...

1069
02:04:13,438 --> 02:04:16,430
your album would never have
been released and you...

1070
02:04:16,675 --> 02:04:19,269
"you'd have been rotting in that
restaurant, still singing there."

1071
02:04:19,678 --> 02:04:21,669
You must thank Anu.

1072
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:24,942
It's because of her that
you are worth something today.

1073
02:04:26,284 --> 02:04:31,449
No. I don't believe this.
It's a lie.

1074
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:35,691
"Lies are shortlived, Rahul.
And since this is the truth..."

1075
02:04:36,294 --> 02:04:39,286
it'll be out before the world soon.
By then maybe...

1076
02:04:39,698 --> 02:04:43,293
you'll be used to a life
that is dependent on women.

1077
02:04:43,702 --> 02:04:46,296
Stop it!
- Why're you angry with me?

1078
02:04:46,705 --> 02:04:49,697
"If you don't like what I say,
go and be angry with Anu."

1079
02:04:50,308 --> 02:04:53,903
Go and ask her why she has
given your success a stigma.

1080
02:04:54,413 --> 02:05:00,648
"Grab her collar, not mine. Okay?
You claim to be a real man..."

1081
02:05:00,919 --> 02:05:03,410
"spurn the charity she gave you,
if you have the guts."

1082
02:05:04,256 --> 02:05:06,247
Kick the success. Go on.

1083
02:05:42,461 --> 02:05:44,452
Where had you gone away?

1084
02:05:47,699 --> 02:05:50,293
Don't leave me and
go away ever again.

1085
02:05:56,241 --> 02:05:59,642
"Rahul, you're hurting me!"

1086
02:06:02,647 --> 02:06:06,640
What did you get out of
humiliating me? What?

1087
02:06:07,252 --> 02:06:09,914
"What kind of a joke is this, Rahul?"

1088
02:06:10,655 --> 02:06:12,919
That's exactly what I want to know.
Why did you play a joke on me?

1089
02:06:14,259 --> 02:06:17,660
"Why did you do it? Why?
- What's gotten into you, Rahul?"

1090
02:06:19,264 --> 02:06:22,256
What do you want to say?
- Stop it! Stop it!

1091
02:06:23,869 --> 02:06:25,860
Padamsee has told me everything!

1092
02:06:26,271 --> 02:06:28,933
Your farce isn't working
with me anymore. Okay?

1093
02:06:30,275 --> 02:06:36,680
"Anu, you have belittled my pride
and my self-respect today."

1094
02:06:37,949 --> 02:06:40,679
You have poisoned my life forever!

1095
02:06:42,287 --> 02:06:44,687
And what did I ask you for? What?

1096
02:06:44,956 --> 02:06:47,686
Why did you have to do me
a favour in charity?

1097
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:51,792
I can't believe it!

1098
02:06:51,963 --> 02:06:56,400
I'm beginning to hate you
and your face!

1099
02:06:57,235 --> 02:07:01,638
I hate you! I hate you!

1100
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:09,643
"No! Stay right there!
And don't try to follow me, okay?"

1101
02:07:28,667 --> 02:07:30,658
What's up? Rahul hasn't yet arrived?

1102
02:07:30,936 --> 02:07:33,268
"Our chairman, Mr Gulshan Kumar
will be arriving any moment now."

1103
02:07:33,438 --> 02:07:35,668
"This is Rahul's mother, Mr Bashir.
- Hello."

1104
02:07:35,941 --> 02:07:38,671
He has gone to fetch a friend.
He'll be arriving any moment.

1105
02:07:38,777 --> 02:07:41,439
"Go and make a call, Pallo.
He must be on his way."

1106
02:07:51,957 --> 02:07:54,892
"Hello, sir.
Welcome Mr Gulshan Kumar."

1107
02:07:58,230 --> 02:08:00,630
Where could he have gone?
Is no one taking the call?

1108
02:08:00,899 --> 02:08:02,730
What are we to do now?

1109
02:08:02,901 --> 02:08:06,894
"This is the limit, Mrs Roy.
The Chairman has arrived already."

1110
02:08:07,405 --> 02:08:10,636
Rahul has really embarrassed me.
- I'm extremely sorry.

1111
02:08:10,742 --> 02:08:16,237
You tell us what we must do.
- I'll start the function...

1112
02:08:16,648 --> 02:08:19,412
you can receive the cheque
on behalf on Rahul.

1113
02:08:19,651 --> 02:08:21,642
Me?
- Yes.

1114
02:08:22,654 --> 02:08:24,645
I'll start the function.

1115
02:08:50,282 --> 02:08:51,442
Hello.

1116
02:08:51,683 --> 02:08:53,617
"Mr Padamsee, I've got to say
something important to you."

1117
02:08:55,387 --> 02:08:58,879
Well?
- I'm willing to leave for Paris.

1118
02:09:23,415 --> 02:09:27,408
"Is Rahul there?
This is his friend, Pallu."

1119
02:09:30,655 --> 02:09:35,922
Where have you been all night?
- In hell! What is it to you?

1120
02:09:43,935 --> 02:09:46,665
Out! Get out.

1121
02:09:47,672 --> 02:09:49,936
There's no place for you
in this house anymore.

1122
02:09:51,676 --> 02:09:55,373
You try to humiliate us?
You belittle us?

1123
02:09:57,615 --> 02:09:59,207
Here's your money.

1124
02:09:59,384 --> 02:10:03,218
Go and have fun. Do as you please.
Just go to hell.

1125
02:10:03,321 --> 02:10:05,312
Mother...
- You keep out of this!

1126
02:10:06,624 --> 02:10:10,617
Do you know why this boy
keeps twisting our arms?

1127
02:10:11,396 --> 02:10:15,890
It's because we love him very much.
We love him more than necessary.

1128
02:10:16,901 --> 02:10:18,892
This is what his father did too.

1129
02:10:19,237 --> 02:10:23,401
"But what happened? Did I die,
after he left me?"

1130
02:10:24,409 --> 02:10:29,244
"Rahul, however strong
a relationship is..."

1131
02:10:29,647 --> 02:10:32,241
life does not end with it.

1132
02:10:32,917 --> 02:10:35,647
Anu won't die without you.
- Enough!

1133
02:10:36,254 --> 02:10:38,415
"Don't utter that bitch's name
in my presence, mother!"

1134
02:10:38,923 --> 02:10:44,657
Don't you dare abuse her!
I'll pull out your tongue!

1135
02:10:45,663 --> 02:10:48,655
Do you know what she has
done for you?

1136
02:10:48,933 --> 02:10:53,267
"Yes, I know! Which is why
I feel like killing myself!"

1137
02:10:53,605 --> 02:10:56,369
You don't know anything. Nothing.

1138
02:10:58,209 --> 02:11:00,609
"Whatever Anu did,
was at my behest."

1139
02:11:01,379 --> 02:11:05,611
I told her not to marry you till you
had reached some position in life.

1140
02:11:06,384 --> 02:11:08,375
And she obeyed me.

1141
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:13,213
"You thought she was unfaithful,
but she didn't tell you the truth."

1142
02:11:13,725 --> 02:11:15,215
How about what Padamsee told me?

1143
02:11:15,393 --> 02:11:19,386
Why did she do me a favour?
Why make me a success?

1144
02:11:19,898 --> 02:11:24,232
"Nobody does anybody a favour,
Rahul. Anu only helped..."

1145
02:11:24,335 --> 02:11:28,897
in taking your voice to the people.
It's people who made you a success.

1146
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:32,641
It's the public. If you
didn't have the talent...

1147
02:11:32,744 --> 02:11:34,735
would you ever reach this stage?

1148
02:11:36,247 --> 02:11:38,408
You gave Anu so much of love.

1149
02:11:38,917 --> 02:11:42,648
"And when she tried to reciprocate,
it hurts your ego so much?"

1150
02:11:43,988 --> 02:11:47,651
"Anu's love is for real, my son.
Don't humiliate her."

1151
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:52,252
"You don't find true love
very often in life, Rahul."

1152
02:11:52,664 --> 02:11:56,259
Go and stop her. She's going
away to Paris... stop her!

1153
02:11:56,434 --> 02:11:58,664
"Bring her home. Go on, Rahul"

1154
02:12:00,271 --> 02:12:05,937
"There is a wall between you
and Anu, Rahul. And it's you!"

1155
02:12:06,277 --> 02:12:09,269
It's your pride!
Do away with it...

1156
02:12:09,447 --> 02:12:11,677
or you will regret it.

1157
02:12:14,786 --> 02:12:18,688
I realise today why people
consider a mother to be God.

1158
02:12:19,958 --> 02:12:23,450
"I'm leaving, mother.
I'll bring Anu here."

1159
02:12:24,295 --> 02:12:25,455
"I'll bring her home, mother."

1160
02:12:30,301 --> 02:12:34,294
Passengers traveling by British
Airways flight 316 to Paris...

1161
02:12:36,808 --> 02:12:38,298
Out of the way!

1162
02:13:03,935 --> 02:13:05,766
Watch it...
- Shut up!

1163
02:13:35,466 --> 02:13:37,457
"Step on it, Pallo! Faster!"

1164
02:13:41,706 --> 02:13:43,298
Stop here!

1165
02:13:52,817 --> 02:13:54,751
Get out of our way!

1166
02:13:56,654 --> 02:13:58,246
Let's go!

1167
02:14:06,264 --> 02:14:08,255
"Rahul, where are you going?"

1168
02:14:21,279 --> 02:14:23,679
Get in! Hurry up!

1169
02:14:27,285 --> 02:14:31,688
They're taking my car away!
Stop them!

1170
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,951
Did you see him?

1171
02:14:38,963 --> 02:14:40,294
"Let's go, Sawant. Hurry up."

1172
02:14:51,709 --> 02:14:53,404
The cops are after us.

1173
02:15:25,443 --> 02:15:26,671
Only two.

1174
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:57,731
"Brakes, Pallo! The brakes!"

1175
02:16:09,253 --> 02:16:14,247
Passengers travelling by British
Airways flight 316 requested to...

1176
02:16:14,659 --> 02:16:16,251
Come on!

1177
02:16:19,664 --> 02:16:21,928
You? What the hell
is all this?

1178
02:16:22,266 --> 02:16:24,928
"I'll explain, sir. But it's necessary
for me to reach the airport."

1179
02:16:25,269 --> 02:16:27,430
Or the girl will go away.
- That girl from the love story?

1180
02:16:27,538 --> 02:16:30,439
"Yes, sir! Please do something, sir!
- Please, sir."

1181
02:16:31,275 --> 02:16:32,936
"Hurry up, sir."

1182
02:16:36,681 --> 02:16:39,673
"Inspector, drive faster!
- Only 5 minutes to go!"

1183
02:16:47,458 --> 02:16:51,292
The last and final call for passengers
travelling by British Airways...

1184
02:16:51,395 --> 02:16:53,625
"flight 316 to Paris.
- Let's go, Anu."

1185
02:16:54,899 --> 02:16:56,890
Proceed for security check.
- Come on.

1186
02:17:09,247 --> 02:17:10,646
The airport.

1187
02:17:40,278 --> 02:17:44,681
I've got to convey an urgent message
to Anu Varghese in flight 316.

1188
02:17:49,453 --> 02:17:51,444
I'm talking to you and you
aren't even listening!

1189
02:17:51,689 --> 02:17:54,624
The flight you're talking about
has taken off just now. Okay?

1190
02:17:55,226 --> 02:17:56,215
What?

1191
02:17:56,327 --> 02:17:59,888
"My love, sweetheart..."

1192
02:18:02,233 --> 02:18:04,224
Sweetheart

1193
02:18:04,902 --> 02:18:06,631
Sweetheart

1194
02:18:07,238 --> 02:18:09,229
Sweetheart

1195
02:18:11,242 --> 02:18:16,236
"My love, sweetheart..."

1196
02:18:17,415 --> 02:18:19,645
Sweetheart

1197
02:18:20,651 --> 02:18:22,642
Sweetheart

1198
02:18:23,921 --> 02:18:25,912
Sweetheart

1199
02:18:48,679 --> 02:18:54,618
For a moment I thought you had
gone far away from me. Forever.

1200
02:18:55,386 --> 02:18:57,377
I never ever went away from you.

1201
02:19:43,935 --> 02:19:46,665
Hey spoilt brat!
What are they doing?

1202
02:19:48,272 --> 02:19:50,263
You won't understand.

1203
02:19:50,942 --> 02:19:53,706
It's a love story.
It's all about love.

1204
02:19:54,211 --> 02:19:57,374
Like you need to breathe...

1205
02:19:58,883 --> 02:20:04,879
like you need to breathe to live...

1206
02:20:05,723 --> 02:20:12,219
"you need a beloved
to love"

1207
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:18,633
Like you need a lamp...

1208
02:20:19,737 --> 02:20:25,903
"like you need a lamp
for light..."

1209
02:20:26,644 --> 02:20:32,913
"you need a beloved
to fall in love with"

1210
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:42,257
You need a beloved to
