2
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,583
Once upon a time,
there was a Prince.

3
00:00:55,416 --> 00:01:00,458
A handsome, charming and
intelligent Prince.

4
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,416
But the prince had a problem.

5
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,625
What was that?

6
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:10,541
He was unable to lead wars
as he was scared of blood..

7
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,416
Oh!

8
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,541
Then how can he rule the kingdom?

9
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,625
Then?

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,666
The priest advised a solution
to get rid of his fear.

11
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,125
What was that?

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:31,833
If he can bring from a pristine forest
the untouched treasure of an unseen virgin,

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,375
then, he can get over his fears
and get enthroned.

14
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,125
Then?

15
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:41,916
So, he started his journey
in search of the virgin.

16
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:50,458
After a strenuous hunt through the dense
forest, the prince spotted the virgin.

17
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,500
Then?

18
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:59,416
On seeing the exhausted prince
Who had covered dense forests and hostile jungles,

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,083
the compassionate virgin asked,
"What do you wish from me?"

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,041
That question flustered the prince!

21
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,250
Why so?

22
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:15,583
Because the Prince didn't know,
what treasure the Virgin possessed, right?

23
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,333
Poor Prince!

24
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:24,208
But the Prince was very cunning..
he smiled and said,

25
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,458
"I want every inch of you".

26
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,666
Then?

27
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:34,541
Hearing his reply, she blushed
And said with a heavy heart;

28
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,125
"But I don't own myself".

29
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:59,083
Shadow of Water

30
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,416
Boss, she is taking too long..

31
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,875
Come, let's go then.

32
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,041
No.. please wait for
five more minutes.

33
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,708
Did they see me?

34
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,875
Go away you dumbass

35
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,500
Let me take a puff.

36
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,875
Why so late?

37
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,708
Mother left only just now.

38
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,166
Ah! Come fast

39
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,791
Come, what are you waiting for?

40
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,500
Come..

41
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,125
No, I am not coming.
- Why?

42
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Why is he here?

43
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,375
It’s my Boss. He will drop us at
the junction. No issues..Come.

44
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,083
Hey don't play
around, let us go!

45
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:27,791
Come..

46
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,708
Oh my God!

47
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,416
Boss, the place is fantastic!

48
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,083
Hey Janu, did you see this?

49
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,041
Why are you sitting tensed?

50
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,500
Look outside..

51
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,375
We left your place.
Come, have a look!

52
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,000
Come out and look!

53
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,041
Now nothing to fear.

54
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:57,750
(The boy talking continuously)

55
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,375
I will drop your shawl.

56
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,416
I will drop it.

57
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,375
Oh no! Boss, please stop.
Her shawl flew away.

58
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,208
Boss! Please stop the vehicle.

59
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,833
My shawl flew away.

60
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,750
Boss..

61
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,291
Did you inform your mother,
that you are coming?

62
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,250
Don't worry

63
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,208
I’m not going to tell anyone.

64
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,416
Here is your shawl

65
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,750
Let’s go, Boss

66
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,541
Are you feeling cold?

67
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,208
- No
Then why are you so huddled up?

68
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,375
Boss, let’s have some food.
Aren't you hungry?

69
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,708
Come, aren't you hungry?

70
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,791
I’m going home by bus.

71
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,625
Going back?

72
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,458
You said you will be alone.
Then why is he here?

73
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,083
What is the problem
if boss is there?

74
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:51,750
Come..

75
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,333
I want to go home.
- Don't be silly.

76
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,375
Ok, come I will drop you home.

77
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,625
Come, Come

78
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,875
I will go alone by bus.

79
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,250
Bus? Have you gone crazy?

80
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:26,291
It is not possible to go now.
We've already come so far.

81
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,250
Come, Come

82
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,833
What are you doing?

83
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,958
Please come, don't get drenched.

84
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,291
I am not coming..

85
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,666
Come, don’t play around.

86
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,208
I said, come here..

87
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,250
I told you to come na?

88
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,166
Don't be scared, come..

89
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,583
Sit

90
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,666
(RADIO singing some
old Tamil love song)

91
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,791
Here, take it.

92
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,083
I don't want it.

93
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,583
Eat.. it's good.

94
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,666
Have it..

95
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,333
Don't be scared.

96
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,583
Boss, you want tea?

97
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,541
Hey..
- Where are you going?

98
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,208
Are you going to
help her to pee?

99
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,541
Are you still mad at me?

100
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,125
Why are you so gloomy?

101
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,291
Are you thirsty?

102
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,041
Why are you gloomy?

103
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,458
Then look at me and sit.
Don't put on a glum face.

104
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,583
If you want, drink

105
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,166
Hey, don't hurt yourself

106
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,125
If you don't want,
I will keep it, ok?

107
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,958
Hey, you didn’t want it earlier?
What happened now?

108
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,500
So you know how to laugh?
You cheeky!

109
00:26:54,541 --> 00:27:01,125
(SONG played in the shopping mall )

110
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:18,166
It is plastic.

111
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,291
Can you show some more?

112
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,250
One minute.

113
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,416
That one please.
- This?

114
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,166
How is this?

115
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:05,708
Did you like it?

116
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,958
Where is the trial room?
- There, it is.

117
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,750
You go and try.

118
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:16,333
Over there.

119
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:44,250
Hey boss, where are you?

120
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,958
We are at the beach only.

121
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,458
Ok

122
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,083
Can you come fast?

123
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,291
Ah! Ok.

124
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:58,833
Alright. Boss

125
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,500
Look, it’s a police van..

126
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,708
It’s the Police!

127
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:36,875
Nice, isn’t it?

128
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,666
I should reach home
before my mom arrives.

129
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,125
You want to go home today?

130
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,791
It is already late.

131
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,291
Hello..

132
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,166
What happened?

133
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,791
Boss is out of coverage area..

134
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,125
Let's go by bus, I
don't like that man.

135
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,708
That is not possible.
Let us walk.

136
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,375
It's already late..

137
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,875
We won't reach there,
if we go by bus.

138
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,041
It is late. Am getting afraid.

139
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:12,083
My mother will kill me.
How will I explain to her?

140
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,083
Don't be afraid.
- We will go by bus.

141
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:21,041
Calm down! We will go.
Hello Boss, where are you?

142
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,583
We are near the beach road.

143
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:26,958
Yes.

144
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,833
Yes, the same route...

145
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,916
We are waiting here..

146
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,833
Wait Wait. Yeah I saw you.

147
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:40,458
BOSS

148
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,666
Hey, come on..!

149
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,041
I want to change my dress.

150
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:23,416
Boss, we are drenched.
She has to change her dress.

151
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,750
Please stop somewhere.

152
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:37,833
I can't go home in this dress..
I have to change.

153
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:39,666
Ok, we will change.

154
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:42,416
Ask him to stop.

155
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:44,583
Boss

156
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,708
(PHONE RINGS)

157
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:04,625
Hello!

158
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Tell, buddy..

159
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:13,958
What happened?

160
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,541
No! I am here only.

161
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,208
No, I am in the village.

162
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,541
Boss, please stop the vehicle..

163
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,458
A small problem..

164
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,791
Wait a moment, buddy..

165
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,458
No range here..
I can't hear you

166
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:39,791
Yes..yes..

167
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,666
No.. no, no

168
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,583
Ah! yes.

169
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:52,375
What?

170
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,166
Who told you?

171
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,000
No.. I am in the village
only with my boss..

172
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:07,958
Ok..

173
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,333
You cut the call,
I will ring you back..

174
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,083
Ok

175
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,000
Boss, please come..

176
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,916
A small problem.

177
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:22,375
What happened?

178
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,250
Nothing.. You wait inside.

179
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,458
Can I change?
- Ok..Change your dress.

180
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,291
Boss! There is a problem.

181
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,833
People at the village came
to know I left with her

182
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,041
Her mother is creating a ruckus!

183
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,875
Are we in trouble?

184
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:56,500
What the hell did you think?
Such things happen..

185
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:00,583
But Boss, we did nothing..
And yet getting trapped?

186
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:14,625
If she comes to know,
she will raise hell..

187
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:28,458
Hey..

188
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,333
Yes..

189
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:34,416
You just keep mum,
I will handle this..

190
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:36,166
Got it?

191
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:36,833
Ok

192
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:40,875
It’s all part of this game..
And I will handle it..

193
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,500
Just follow my advice..

194
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,166
There is nothing else to worry..

195
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:49,041
Don't pick or attend
any phone calls..

196
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,250
Understood?
- Yes.

197
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:58,083
Shit.. I should not
have gone for this..

198
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,083
What? Come, let's go

199
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:10,541
Don’t forget what I said. OK?
- Yes.

200
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,250
What happened?
- Did you change your dress?

201
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,416
Hey, nothing happened.

202
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,625
What is happening...

203
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,750
Nothing

204
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
(PHONE RINGS)

205
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,583
Can't you understand?

206
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,333
But Boss..

207
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,250
What?

208
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,250
Please tell what happened?

209
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,750
Hey, it's nothing..

210
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:58,916
Eh?

211
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,458
Nothing. No issue.
Let's go, Boss..

212
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,041
Your mother came to know!

213
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:04,708
Everyone in the
village knows now..

214
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,541
Now we can’t go back there..
That's it..

215
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:11,791
Don't cry! There
won't be any issue.

216
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,333
Don't cry! There won't be any issue.
- You promised to take me back by evening.

217
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,208
Shut up!!

218
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,833
What the hell did you
think, when you came?

219
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Don't cry!

220
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:09,500
I want to go back to my mother.

221
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,916
I am scared of this place.

222
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:21,000
You promised to take me
back by evening, right?

223
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,208
Boss is here to see someone..
Let me see..

224
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,791
We will go by bus. I am scared.

225
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:31,625
Believe me, You are my darling.
I will take you back..

226
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,458
Please don't get scared.

227
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,708
[Boss]Don’t you want a room?

228
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,000
[Boss]You need a room or not?

229
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,250
[Boss] I’ve taken a room..

230
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,125
I will sleep in the vehicle..

231
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,208
[Boss] You go and convince her

232
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:39,500
Go..

233
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,041
Come, let us go by bus.
Please..

234
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,125
Yes.. we will go... but.. but..

235
00:47:56,833 --> 00:48:00,291
It is not possible to go now.
Please try to understand.

236
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,875
What is your problem?

237
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,500
No problem, Boss
Let me talk to her..

238
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:07,000
I don’t have to bear with you two, ok?

239
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,708
Do you understand? Huh?
- Yes, boss.

240
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:12,583
Then, come.

241
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:17,625
I am scared, I need to go home.
- What?

242
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,458
Yes boss, we are coming!

243
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,541
Let's stay back today,
it is very late now.

244
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,708
If we go today, it will
only create problems.

245
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:40,000
My mom!
Don’t worry we will convince her..

246
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,875
Let us take a bus

247
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:49,083
There are no buses at this time.

248
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:58,250
Hey..
- Yes.

249
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,250
I don’t want to stay here..

250
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,750
Don’t be scared
Am I not with you?

251
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,958
Why are you scared?

252
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,166
My dear Janu, don't be scared.

253
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,041
Don't worry! I am with you right?
Then why get tensed?

254
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:27,416
Let us go somehow. Please..

255
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,708
Listen my dear...

256
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:32,791
I want to see my mother,

257
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:33,875
Janu, please...

258
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:34,875
We will go by bus.

259
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:35,916
What the crap?

260
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:39,833
No boss, she feels
scared of this place..

261
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:42,708
Why the hell did you
come with him then?

262
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,666
This is not your house,
behave properly.

263
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,208
Boss, I already told her..

264
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:51,791
I have already told you.

265
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,916
Come up..

266
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,125
Oh no! I am scared.

267
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:03,666
Boss! Please..
She is so scared.

268
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,458
Look, this is not your home...

269
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:09,333
Come up...

270
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,833
You go up.. I will bring her..

271
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,250
Move aside..

272
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,125
Water?

273
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:15,250
Do you have water?

274
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,375
Come, let us go in..

275
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,708
My Mother..

276
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,875
Boss, please don’t
frighten her..

277
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,416
I told you already.

278
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,458
Can you take her home this late?

279
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:38,750
No.
- Then what?

280
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:43,750
Don’t make me repeat.

281
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,958
Come let's go by bus

282
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:57,333
It is not possible to go now.
Janu, please listen to me.

283
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,625
I want to see my mother.

284
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:00,875
How will we go?
You yourself think about it.

285
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,666
Bus! We can go by bus.

286
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:06,166
We won't get any bus now.
Please understand.

287
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:12,250
Didn't you promise me that you
will take me home before evening?

288
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:17,666
Janu, please listen to me..
-Why can't we go alone?

289
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:21,625

00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,875
Take a shower if you want.
I will be back in a moment..

292
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,458
I have to see my mother now,

293
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,125
Janu, we can't go now...

294
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,875
You promised that you'll
take me back by evening.

295
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,750
How can we go? Just
think about it.

296
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:46,625
I want to see my mother now.

297
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,166

Janu, don't cry like this..

301
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,833
People in the next room will hear..

302
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:04,208
I am scared of this place

303
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:07,083
Don’t worry, I am with you right?
Don’t get tensed up.

Go away.

You are mine, right?

311
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:01,583
Boss..

312
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,791
Did you eat something?

313
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:12,333
No, boss.

314
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:17,416
Go and get some food!
Don't stay hungry.

315
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,416
Boss...

316
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:27,541
What?

317
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,625
We have no problem,
No need for food now.

Aren’t you taking bath?

331
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,458
Is this the liquor shop?

332
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,291
Yes.

333
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:10,291
Hey..

[Boy crying]

342
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,250
Boss

343
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,458
Why did you do this to me, Boss?

344
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:31,333
Get lost..

345
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,458

01:13:58,791 --> 01:13:59,958
Boss, please wake up..

355
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:06,458
She is not responding.

356
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,208
She is not waking up..

357
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,125
Has anything happened to her?

358
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:14,125
I am getting scared, boss.

359
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:51,708
Pack your bag. We’ve
to leave early.

360
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:57,625
Didn’t you hear me?

361
01:15:58,625 --> 01:15:59,375
Hey, make a move.

362
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,125
Ask her to pack and come.

363
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:13,791
I don't want to go home.

364
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:43,583
Boss..

365
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:47,416
Boss, she is crying

366
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:50,541
So, what should I do?

367
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,041
