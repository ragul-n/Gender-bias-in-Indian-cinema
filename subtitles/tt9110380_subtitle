1
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:39,125
Depression means low pressure!

2
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,583
Rain comes with coffee – one or two cups.

3
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:46,708
As I look through the window,
evening sets in.

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,542
Clouds gather like the yester days
but no tears.

5
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:54,708
A lone cup of coffee caged in your palms.

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,292
I know the meaning of depression – sadness.

7
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,542
You're listening to
91.9 Friends FM with Arjun …

8
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,583
'Mon Amar' …

9
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,375
Let's see which friend is on the line …

10
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,708
Hello!

11
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,000
Arjunda! This is Moutrisha …

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,375
Do you remember me?

13
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,500
Have been listening to your show
for the last five years …

14
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Haven't missed a day …

15
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,042
Sounds familiar...

16
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,917
Moutrisha from Behala...
Ashutosh College...

17
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,292
Two years back on a rainy day you had
proposed to the person you love... right?

18
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,667
You remember?
I have to...

19
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:48,958
...after all, we are friends...
Tell me... how is he?

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Suman and I have broken up …

21
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:54,417
we've moved on...

22
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,083
Move on! Move on!

23
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,125
Today is his birthday...

24
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:06,167
I want to wish him from here …
Go on Mou … wish Sumon.

25
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:10,042
Sumon… many of your things
are still with me…

26
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:14,208
I've kept them very carefully …

27
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,625
My only wish is wherever
you are, be happy …

28
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:24,958
If you love someone truly, you can cherish
the memories of your love all through your life.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,375
Is it called unrequited love?

30
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:36,250
Friends, you're listening to
91.9 Friends FM with Arjun …

31
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,292
' Mon Amar ' …

32
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:42,417
Speak your mind …
A beautiful song for you friends …

33
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:48,833
My unreasonable demands
doesn't follow logic, I know …

34
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:54,458
Take me with you this day …

35
00:03:54,458 --> 00:04:00,167
Come along a few steps with me …

36
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,208
I want to walk a few steps

37
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,083
with you …

38
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,792
Let's see who else is there on the line …

39
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,292
Hello …

40
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:31,833
I got through after trying
for a long time...

41
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,708
I thought maybe I'll never be
able to say my last words...

42
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:40,250
Words never get exhausted,
my friend... tell me who's there?

43
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
I am Saheli...

44
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,667
I felt...
you're my only friend...

45
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,333
I want to say goodbye to this world...

46
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,542
I want to say something to you …

47
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,708
which you can share with all others …

48
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,500
Saheli... we want to
know more about you...

49
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,958
your friends of this radio
want to know about you.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,250
My papa and ma...

51
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,208
they're very busy...

52
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,792
they come back very late...
they fight all the time...

53
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,000
seems I'm the problem between them …

54
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,708
sometimes, I feel like cursing myself...

55
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,833
Saheli …

56
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,417
where are you now?

57
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,625
… What are you doing right now?

58
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,792
I am sitting on the cornice
of our terrace alone...

59
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,875
I feel … I feel like …
right now...

60
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:36,167
Saheli... do you know at this moment
everyone is listening to you?

61
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,458
… Every person in this city
is listening to you?

62
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,458
Hello Saheli?

63
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,250
Are you trying to dissuade me?

64
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not trying anything
of that sort Saheli...

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,250
Saheli … do you know why
your parents fight...

66
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,708
you might hear your dad
tell your mom...

67
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,625
“Why don't you spend more time with Saheli?”...

68
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,542
Your mom might be saying
the same thing...

69
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,958
because they love you a lot...

70
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,333
Saheli, if I ask something from
you, will you give it to me?

71
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:28,917
Your papa's number?

72
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,792
He's abroad …
for business …

73
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,917
Ma's number?

74
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,208
934249320 …

75
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,125
But please do not call Ammu …
she's very busy at this moment …

76
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:52,542
Saheli … you know … I've a
son … I miss him so much …

77
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:57,333
When I'm at the radio station …
alone … absolutely alone …

78
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,417
talking to my radio friends …
then I feel …

79
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,083
… can he hear me?

80
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,250
Actually he can't stay awake very late …

81
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:09,542
before I reach him it
might be midnight,

82
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,333
I also cannot afford time for him …

83
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:19,083
Friends, a very beautiful
song for you all …

84
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:24,333
And this song is specially
for Saheli.

85
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,542
'Extend your hand'
… Anupam Roy …

86
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:37,292
Extend your hand … I want
to hold your finger again …

87
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:46,750
Extend your hand … I want
to walk beside you again …

88
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:53,125
Extend your hand …
Your hand …

89
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:59,125
Madam … this is Arjun …
Arjun Mallik from 91.9 Friends FM …

90
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't talk right now...
I'm extremely sorry …

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,542
I want to talk to you
about your daughter Saheli...

92
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,208
she's standing on the terrace
and she wants to end her life!

93
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:19,667
I'll connect you to your daughter
on a live call... hold on …

94
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,583
Saheli …

95
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:33,042
This is my favourite song...

96
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,583
A lot of people like this song...

97
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,792
you know Saheli, today I have
a huge surprise for you...

98
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:45,167
someone wants to talk to you Saheli...
see if you can recognize her...

99
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,417
Saheli … my darling …

100
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,083
… where are you?

101
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,500
Ammu!
Tell me, my dear … tell me …

102
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,667
what's happened with you? …

103
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,875
where are you?

104
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,000
Ammu … I was badly
missing you Ammu! …

105
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:00,000
Ammu, where are you?

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,167
I'm very near you …

107
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,833
When will you return Ammu?

108
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,958
I'm in the hospital dear!
I'll just finish my work and come to you...

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,417
As words remained unsaid...
many relationships got destroyed...

110
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,500
As words remained unspoken...

111
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,792
people parted ways!

112
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,083
So, when you have the scope …

113
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,500
and when God has given us this voice …

114
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,750
this ability to talk...

115
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:33,125
then come …
speak your heart out...

116
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,833
tell your beloved 'I love you'!

117
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,583
Friends … speak your mind …

118
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,042
call me at 22022202...

119
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,125
with Arjun you're listening
to 'Mon amar'...

120
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,667
91.9 Friends FM.

121
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:52,125
Here's another
mind blowing song for you …

122
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:57,458
If I do not lay my ears on the sky...

123
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:03,042
I'll not be able to hear your words!

124
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:10,125
If I do not touch the wind...

125
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:23,708
I'll not be able to feel your touch!

126
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:30,083
I'll not be able to hear your words …

127
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:48,083
The sound of silence...

128
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:26,125
Hmm... baba.

129
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,125
What are you watching?

130
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,833
It's very good! Come!

131
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,833
Sleep broke in the world of sleep …
A sweet murmur rose!

132
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:16,750
Birds awoke on the boughs of trees,
And bees on the flowers!

133
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,667
Horses woke up in the stable …

134
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,208
Stop stop! Just a second …

135
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,000
Bring 'morning' into your voices …

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,917
Sing the 'morning' note …

137
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,125
Sa re ga ma pa dha ni sa …

138
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:34,875
Sa ni dha pa ga ma re sa …

139
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,542
Come on!
Doing very good...

140
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,292
Bring the 'morning'...!

141
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,667
Aha! Bring the 'morning'
in your voice...

142
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,333
Practice properly!

143
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,667
Baba!

144
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,583
Come on! Let's practice our part
at the last moment!

145
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,083
No! I'm not doing
the evening news today!

146
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,458
Why … Arjun has his award
ceremony today!

147
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,750
Went to Posta and heard...

148
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,750
About your daughter's marriage!

149
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,667
I don't know!
I need leave … I'll take leave …

150
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:21,708
Want to know
the kind of boy he is?

151
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,042
You said it like
an old man … isn't it?

152
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,375
You put pressure on your voice …
it hurt …

153
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,750
Now to say it if we use the harmonium
in our voice it would be easier.

154
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,000
How is that?

155
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:38,000
Last week I worked in
two extra shifts …

156
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,958
I've asked leave only for a day and …

157
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,417
Have you noticed your grandaunt?
Yes …

158
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,542
As she is old …
her feet totter…

159
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,875
Likewise, if we make use of
our voice harmonium …

160
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,500
and touch the upper
and lower 'sa' notes...

161
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,250
Sa sa...

162
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:52,458
What did you say?
Oh no no …

163
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,958
Went to Posta and heard...
About your daughter's marriage...

164
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,125
Get these ironed!

165
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,417
Will you teach me?
Sure!

166
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,292
Everything is for you!
You're my hero!

167
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,708
Why are you smoking the cigarette?

168
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,875
… Messed up the room …
smoking in front of Tukai?

169
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,208
Rightly served …

170
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,250
Tukai has said he'll skip
the evening tuition today!

171
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,583
I've told all my school friends that

172
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,583
my father is getting 'Voice of the Year'.

173
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,542
… Getting 'Voice of the Year' …

174
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,167
Gopal!

175
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,542
Gopal, start off with Tukai …

176
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,333
Go!

177
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,083
Listen … we'll not have
dinner tonight!

178
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,583
Make something for yourself …

179
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,000
On your way back, bring corn flakes
for your little brother!

180
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:15,667
Reads the note woven carefully
with golden thread …

181
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:20,750
Read the name, the place and the note …

182
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:26,708
Laid it on her lap
to read it a hundred times …

183
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:34,208
The princess sat on her bed
and thought …

184
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,875
Who will garland me
in this lonely retreat?

185
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:42,292
The fragrance of your body
fascinates me the most …

186
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:50,458
Will not be able to kiss you amidst
all in the award show …

187
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,875
so let me do it now …

188
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,583
From college social directly to radio play …

189
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:15,583
Then there was poetry …
and reading letters from listeners …

190
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:22,167
And now our nights are never complete
without listening to his voice …

191
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,208
Ladies and Gentlemen …

192
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,042
No … I'll not tell you
the name just now …

193
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,500
That person will be awarded by...

194
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,583
an amazing personality …

195
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,750
Mr. Barun Chanda …

196
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,458
His baritone voice has mesmerized
Bengalee audience through ages …

197
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,583
Barunda … please …
come on stage …

198
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,542
Many thanks for coming here …

199
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,333
Thank you! …

200
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,083
And now the person I was talking
about for so long …

201
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,500
'Ei Samay' Voice of Bengal
powered by 'Siti Cinema'

202
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,333
'Voice of the Year'...

203
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,167
award goes to...

204
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:12,875
The RJ of 91.9 Friends FM …

205
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,375
Arjun Mullick …

206
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,667
Splendid!

207
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,792
A louder applause please!

208
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:39,458
Your clapping is an honour
to RJ Arjun!

209
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,042
Arjun …

210
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:53,708
… your impeccable voice …
Your delivery … your throw …

211
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,333
Has kept the Bengalee audience
completely charmed …

212
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,583
You richly deserve this award
more than anybody else …

213
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,000
Thank you Arjun … thank you!

214
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,542
In one word, extraordinary …

215
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:11,167
Let this clapping continue please …

216
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,333
Don't let the applause
die down …

217
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,250
When today we've got Arjun here,
he must say something!

218
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,792
How do you feel?
Share your feeling!

219
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,250
Take it!

220
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,167
Hello!

221
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,708
What's wrong with his voice?

222
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,167
A person like Arjun
is speechless today?

223
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,875
Forgive me, please… my voice …

224
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,083
I think Arjun's voice is
choked with emotion …

225
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,208
these things happen …

226
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,833
but...

227
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,417
I want a big big hand from all of you!

228
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,458
Audience … Louder! Louder!

229
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,083
Thank you Arjun!
Thank you Barunda!

230
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,667
Thank you so much …

231
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:47,875
and in such moments, we get speechless...

232
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:52,500
we get 'overwhelmed' …

233
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,042
We'll move on to our next award …

234
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:02,333
Child…on the first morn of your life...
I introduced you to this entire world …

235
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:09,250
That's me, and today I've cast aside
all embarrassment, to tell you who I am!

236
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:16,125
Lady, the light of your lowered eyes... melts my heart,
as the sun's rays melt mountain snows!

237
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:22,625
Your voice pierces my ears as a voice from
a previous birth... and stirs strange pain.

238
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:28,833
Tell me then, by what mystery's chain
is my birth linked to you, unknown woman?

239
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:34,125
Oh, be patient, child, for a moment!
Let the sun-god first slide to his rest...

240
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:37,000
and let evening's darkness
thicken round us.

241
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,667
Now let me tell you, warrior...
I am Kunti.

242
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,875
You are Kunti!

243
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,667
The mother of Arjun!

244
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,125
Fix an appointment with
Dr. Majumdar… tomorrow morning!

245
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,625
There's a growth in the throat …

246
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:39,750
Biopsy must be done …

247
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,083
CT scan …

248
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,958
Biopsy report indicates …

249
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,250
carcinoma …

250
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,208
which we call cancer …

251
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:08,250
CT scan is also positive …

252
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,667
We had organized
a Tumour Board meeting …

253
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,625
with many doctors …

254
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:18,125
The decision made is …
we'll go for surgery!

255
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,333
Although in cancer treatment
chemotherapy … radiotherapy …

256
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,000
that is radiation … are all there...

257
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,667
But this is the fourth stage …

258
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,667
Apart from surgery, there's
no other way out.

259
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:38,958
As a doctor, my objective
is to save your life!

260
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,917
There's one more thing, Arjun!

261
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,875
No smoking!

262
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,625
It's poison for you!

263
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:52,917
The cancer is spreading pretty fast …

264
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,917
Can't give you time …

265
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,958
What's disturbing is...

266
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,583
you'll lose...

267
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,417
...your voice box!

268
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:10,583
I know it's very painful for you …
because it's your profession …

269
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:14,708
You're a radio jockey …
A voice artist …

270
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,500
Still … I'm repeating …

271
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,042
Life, I think is much more
precious than voice …

272
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,500
You'll not be able to speak
the way you did before …

273
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:29,375
All other things
you'll be able to do normally …

274
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,083
Discuss it between yourselves …

275
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,917
It's a very very difficult decision …

276
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:37,167
But the surgery has
to be done immediately!

277
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,833
Zakir Hussain's hands are amputated …

278
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,167
The eyes of a rifle shooter
are plucked out …

279
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:51,208
then try keeping them alive …
what's the point?

280
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:56,750
Keeping me alive, without my voice,
is tantamount to killing me!

281
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,542
I will be alive, but...

282
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,667
I'll live like a dead man!

283
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,625
I'll be a vegetable … isn't it?

284
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,417
My voice is an asset in my life …

285
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:18,458
Manoj, I'm living
for the sake of it …

286
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,333
What are you seeing? … What?

287
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,500
I'll not let them operate on me, Pritha!

288
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,667
I'll not allow the operation to happen …

289
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:30,583
I'll die, if I have to …

290
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,083
Pritha and Tukai …

291
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,292
What about Pritha and Tukai?

292
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:39,167
Tukai is only seven, Arjun …

293
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:42,208
Do you want him
to lose his father at this age?

294
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,375
I'm not considering my life …

295
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:48,417
For me what's important
is not your voice, but you!

296
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:51,500
You're the life support for us!

297
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,250
Had it happened to me,
what would you have done?

298
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,792
Did you disclose to Tukai?

299
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,708
Dad, I've come first!

300
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,542
See …

301
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,833
he's come first …

302
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,250
My champion!

303
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,167
So, my friend …

304
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:37,583
Our friendship of twenty five years
is coming to an end …

305
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:44,083
So, let's say goodbye
to each other …

306
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,167
Let's make love for the last time!

307
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:28,792
Haripada, the driver of Lalmohanbabu
had taken a leave, so Feluda had to replace him.

308
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,625
On the way, Lalmohanbabu said...

309
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:40,208
"So you dumped a responsibility upon
my shoulders, a binocular and two books" …

310
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,333
Dad … is it painful?

311
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,333
You need not read any more …

312
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:23,208
Talk to me …

313
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,708
Speak Arjun …

314
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,500
Speak … say something …

315
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,208
Please …

316
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,917
Don't be silent …

317
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,250
Say anything …

318
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:42,333
I want to talk to you
throughout this night …

319
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,500
say something … please …

320
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,542
My sad days walk the straight way...

321
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:50,708
My happy days float...

322
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:57,167
On such a rainy day, at every step
I remember the day I died...

323
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:04,083
My happy fields are steeped in water...

324
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:08,292
My hard earned paddy dies...

325
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:12,208
I remember the day it rained...

326
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:15,917
There's no end to my birth!

327
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:23,583
In this life …
our conversation ends here...

328
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,000
Pritha...

329
00:32:54,458 --> 00:33:00,000
In knee deep water
My memories float.

330
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Life speaks …
Everyone is silent.

331
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:26,333
On my shoulder rests
Your chin covered by clouds …

332
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:31,625
Who painted this illusion …
How wonderful it is!

333
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:37,042
That great vagabond
by joining mirages...

334
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:42,333
Designs very far...
A mound of light.

335
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,208
Jockey?

336
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,250
You mean …
those who ride horses …

337
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:00,833
Do you gamble in horse races?
No no …

338
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,708
It's radio jockey …

339
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,458
I do radio anchoring …

340
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:07,333
That means you lend
your voice in the radio …

341
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,333
Birendra Krishna Bhadra …

342
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,250
Starved to death …
now eat …

343
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:19,625
As the night descends...

344
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:24,667
No one can be seen …

345
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:30,333
This white marble
is so cold …

346
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,667
In the discarded love bower
who listens to whom...

347
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:57,000
I send you inwardly...
the early dawn.

348
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:02,292
The silhouette created... by
cutting the veins of sleep

349
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:07,708
Silently walks...
the firefly thief …

350
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,458
Mrs. Mullick...

351
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,792
Will you, please, come inside?

352
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:56,333
Come!

353
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,875
Sit …

354
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,000
The operation has been successful …

355
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,583
and the life of the patient
has been saved …

356
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,167
And that's the best part …

357
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:17,417
The cancer didn't spread to the gland,
it was confined to the larynx …

358
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:20,250
No Pritha!

359
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,542
You can't break down now!

360
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:27,208
You've many more battles left to fight …

361
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,417
Actually, the real fight starts
from now onwards …

362
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:40,375
See! The most important
person in his life, is you!

363
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,250
He loves you very much!

364
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:49,250
But now, he'll despise you the most …

365
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:55,583
Because he'll try to share
his words with his dearest person …

366
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:59,417
but when she'll fail to understand,
he'll get exasperated.

367
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:03,250
And Pritha!
You, too, are a voice artist …

368
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,292
The patient in room no. 451
is to be discharged today.

369
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,125
Keep the bill ready.

370
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,292
Mr. Mullick...

371
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,208
If you press this bell,
I'll respond at once.

372
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,500
And this is a slate
and a marker pen.

373
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,750
If you require anything,
please write on this.

374
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,958
How are you feeling now?

375
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,375
Feeling better?

376
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,000
'Speechless'

377
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,042
Won't you write on the slate?

378
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:26,250
Doctor was saying it's like
your rice initiating day!

379
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:31,417
I know … after laryngectomy
you don't get any smell!

380
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:36,833
The scent of 'Gobindobhog' rice …
which you love …

381
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,625
And boiled 'moong' lentils!

382
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,958
Want to go home!

383
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,625
We'll go!

384
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,333
Hold this …

385
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,625
And take the bag …

386
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,667
Come!

387
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,208
Careful!

388
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,292
Welcome!

389
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:20,583
Since you got admitted in hospital,
aunty has come to stay here.

390
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:28,792
You were captured by the royal disease …
the royal disease!

391
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,500
It's ok …

392
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,083
Now I'm here … you come!

393
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:38,292
When Sri Ramkrishna had this disease,
Mother used to feed him with …

394
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,625
SEMOLINA...

395
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:44,250
She used to strain it and strain it …

396
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:49,000
Or else she gave him lamb stew …

397
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,250
Cooking it needs a lot of skill …

398
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,583
SKILL … understand?

399
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:56,667
At first you put the meat in normal water …

400
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:01,417
And then you add some bay
leaves and a little spices …

401
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:04,667
And then you boil it until
it becomes soft like cotton …

402
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,250
Aunty … please …

403
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:11,375
If you lie on a betel leaf bed...

404
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:15,333
It sucks … SUCKS
away your cancer …

405
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,333
Why are you shouting?
I can hear normally.

406
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,208
Aunty … please leave him alone …

407
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,708
please go…
I'll call you later …

408
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,958
Ok, I will go!

409
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,708
What a dangerous disease
has seized you, my child …

410
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:33,542
Dear God, please cure my child!

411
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,792
Hey hey! What're you doing?

412
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,292
I … I'll take it...

413
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,208
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

414
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,417
Should have kept the phone
with me … Give me the phone …

415
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,250
Dad!

416
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,875
Tukai … Tukai …

417
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,417
Tukai … listen Tukai …

418
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,875
What has happened to you, my dear?

419
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,083
What has happened? Tell me!

420
00:41:54,125 --> 00:42:00,417
That hole in dad's throat …
it scares me …

421
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:05,042
Now Daddy will breathe through
that hole my dear …

422
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:06,625
there's nothing to get scared!

423
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:11,125
Like we breathe through our nose,
dad will breathe through his throat!

424
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:14,125
Will he not be able to speak any more?

425
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:17,208
Who said he won't?
Of course he will!

426
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,458
We'll have to be at Daddy's
side … encourage him …

427
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,458
Never get scared again!

428
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,875
Good boy!

429
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:38,208
Rare cosmic event on a winter evening …

430
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,458
After a lapse of 160 years …

431
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:44,458
Super Moon, Blood Moon, Blue Moon … And
total Lunar Eclipse … all together!

432
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:48,417
In this lunar colour play,
children are the most excited.

433
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:54,542
All citizens are hooked to the sky
to watch the changing faces of the Moon.

434
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:57,833
Everyone has booked their
seats on their rooftops.

435
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:02,833
Tonight the moon will be 14% larger
and 30% brighter than the other days.

436
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,667
This evening all eyes are on the moon!

437
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:08,333
Apart from India, this eclipse
can be seen from other countries

438
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:11,917
like Asia, US, Russia,
North East Europe and Australia.

439
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:57,833
I've told God...
give back my dad's voice.

440
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:02,833
I tell you... you'll be
able to speak one day.

441
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,708
Radiation ends today …

442
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,708
And the whistling sound from his throat …

443
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:25,500
which is a concern for you …

444
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,042
I think it will get
reduced in some time …

445
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:34,292
Speech Therapy will start from now on.

446
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:38,083
Why don't you have
a look at our Laryngectomy Club?

447
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,750
Better bring him tomorrow …

448
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,667
We...

449
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,042
can speak …

450
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:51,417
in three different ways …

451
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,333
TEP...

452
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:58,125
They make a
permanent surgery in the throat …

453
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:02,625
Here in our country,
people do not do this …

454
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,792
because of pollution …

455
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:08,042
The second one is called...

456
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:09,833
...electrolarynx.

457
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,250
Listen carefully.

458
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:15,458
Like a shaving unit,

459
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:19,000
speak with the help of this machine.

460
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,417
Machine...

461
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:27,208
may fail.

462
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,833
But...

463
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:32,667
speaking with the food pipe …

464
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,542
is original and natural …

465
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:45,083
Our Laryngectomy Club...

466
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,917
has an anthem …

467
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,292
Let's hear it …

468
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,667
The little boy says – o … a

469
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:57,375
He has not learnt to speak …

470
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:01,750
Tiger lives in the jungle …

471
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,375
Bird lives on the tree …

472
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,625
Fish lives in water …

473
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:12,708
Will you not stay here any more?

474
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:32,042
I'll not speak in such
a distorted voice …

475
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:36,375
For a radio anchor,
this period is really tough …

476
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:40,875
Better take him to Romila …

477
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,417
the address is there …

478
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,625
Should I call her?

479
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,792
Arjun, you've to go somewhere …

480
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:05,708
either to the hospital to
do speech therapy …

481
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,792
or take private training …

482
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:29,208
Leave me alone …

483
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,167
It says – right turn!

484
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,833
This side …

485
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,542
We're on the right path …

486
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,417
Break! Break! Break everything!

487
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:08,167
You're in such a hurry …
Such a hurry – eh?

488
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,500
You broke my lemon plant …

489
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,750
Hey! Hey!

490
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,250
Can't even hold the pot …
why have they sent you at all?

491
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:22,333
Why are you standing there like
a wooden doll?

492
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,083
Hold the pot … hold it!

493
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,083
Ohh! It'll break!
Today it's Potol's day or mine …

494
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:32,583
Why are you pushing the bell, Potol?
Come up, at once!

495
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,417
This is your man
for the pots – isn't it?

496
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,125
I had told you to send
minimum of two persons.

497
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,083
It's taking my whole day …

498
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:42,167
There're more than 50 pots …
They've to be sent to Jhulandi's place today itself …

499
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:45,792
Your man has broken my lemon plant …
I'll give him a tight …

500
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,667
My dad has had a throat operation …

501
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,583
Will you teach my dad to talk?

502
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Actually, I used to hold
the therapy sessions in private …

503
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:24,792
But next week I'm shifting to
Dhaka permanently …

504
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:27,250
leaving Kolkata for good.

505
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:31,750
So, it's impossible for me
to take up a new case …

506
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,833
Please go to this Beckbagan Institute …
where there are other speech pathologists.

507
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,292
Previously, I also was associated with
this institute... here is their number …

508
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,625
You can call them here …

509
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,667
I'm extremely sorry …
I'll not be able to take a case any more …

510
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:55,083
Won't you teach my dad to speak?

511
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,875
There are other doctors,
my dear … they'll teach him …

512
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:13,375
Desperately need private tuitions …

513
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:14,958
Why me?

514
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,875
Because you are the best …

515
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:29,250
Look, I can't say that …

516
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:32,375
but it's impossible for me
to take a new case.

517
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:48,083
Is this the time to come Potol?

518
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:51,083
Your man has broken
my lemon plant …

519
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,917
My white hibiscus also
has broken limbs …

520
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:55,833
Weren't you supposed to
send more people?

521
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:59,542
Who will bring down
so many pots? Tell me.

522
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:02,375
Come at once.

523
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,167
Aunty, nowadays you can see
RJs on Facebook or twitter …

524
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:14,167
previously, it was not like that.

525
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:18,333
By listening to the voice,
you thought he was handsome.

526
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,333
Remember our RJ Diganta …

527
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,125
You won't know … but you should!

528
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:25,458
Oh yes! He looks just like me!

529
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:30,458
Fat … pot-bellied …
lost almost all his hair …

530
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,292
but his voice gives you an impression of

531
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,750
Clint Eastwood with Salman Khan …

532
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,875
Whoever comes to the Radio Station,

533
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,083
he would just run and hide,
himself, in the office.

534
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:43,083
I thought – what's happening?

535
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,792
He would say – "Indranidi …
please do not introduce me to anyone …

536
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:47,208
everything will get messed up …

537
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,250
Whatever I'm doing is
only because of my voice …

538
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,167
if anyone gets to see
my potbelly and balding head …

539
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,500
then everything will be finished …"

540
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,500
It never happens to me...
no fan ever turns up …

541
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,958
Why didn't you take me along?

542
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,417
So presumptuous!
" It never happens to me …"

543
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:09,208
How old are you that you'll have fans?

544
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,167
What did the doctor say?

545
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,042
Doctor is going away …

546
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,042
Said she has no time …

547
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:16,542
can't teach …

548
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:18,292
Going away means?

549
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:23,250
Remember … Arjunda used to make my
boyfriend sit in the office to guard me?

550
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,417
Your boyfriend with disheveled hair …
how can I forget?

551
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,250
Poor boyfriend …

552
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:31,542
I'm calling up Dr. Majumdar just now …

553
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:34,042
if required we'll go to Chennai …
Mumbai …

554
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,542
If needed, I'll take three
to six months leave …

555
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,875
Let's search …

556
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,458
Arjun!

557
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:43,042
Do you all know
what happened with Arjun?

558
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:47,750
Bundles of letters kept pouring
at the radio station …

559
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,250
One day, I opened a letter …
it read …

560
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:54,292
My darling, how are you?

561
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,583
I can't live without you …

562
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,500
Why aren't you picking up my phone?

563
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:03,542
Are you avoiding me?
I can sacrifice my life for you …

564
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:05,542
I was thinking – Good Heavens …

565
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:07,500
Give me the bag … let me …

566
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:10,083
Why are you worrying?
Everything will be ok.

567
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,458
We'll search for other places …

568
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:15,875
At the bottom, I found
a phone number …

569
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:17,833
I called up …

570
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,083
What are you saying?

571
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,833
What kind of a girl are you …

572
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,000
You called her straight away?

573
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:25,875
Aunty, listen what happened next …

574
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,167
The phone was ringing …

575
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,917
She picked up the phone …

576
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,500
I said … Mahua?

577
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,250
She said … yes …

578
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I said … Do you write letters to Arjun?

579
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:39,083
She said … yes …

580
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:43,375
I said … But Arjun is married …

581
00:56:43,792 --> 00:56:45,625
Just silence...

582
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:50,708
Suddenly, she cried out, "It's a lie!
You're trying to come between us"!

583
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,750
Tell me, was I trying to
come between you?

584
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,125
Arjun!

585
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:26,625
Come … sit with us outside …

586
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:41,542
Not feeling well?

587
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,333
Myself, Pritha and you …

588
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:56,167
We started our career together in radio …

589
00:57:57,458 --> 00:58:00,417
Don't cast us away like this …

590
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:05,125
You're my only friend at
the radio station …

591
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:20,750
Please leave me alone!

592
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,083
No Mr. Arjun Mallick!

593
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:30,917
I'll never leave you alone!

594
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,708
I'll be with you!

595
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:39,542
I'll never leave you!

596
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,208
Mom! Granny had called …

597
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:58,750
She wants me to visit her once,
before going to Dhaka.

598
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,875
Ok! Go! Everyone will be so happy!

599
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,833
You know, I don't like it!

600
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:05,375
I hate that house!

601
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,625
I don't like to see my dad
with anyone else …

602
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:08,625
Don't you understand?

603
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,667
Can't you see, that
I hate that woman?

604
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:17,417
Saheli, you are aware that
we are, now, divorced!

605
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,583
You can't compel
your dad to do anything …

606
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:23,042
He can do whatever he likes …

607
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,708
But a marriage right after divorce?

608
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,792
He couldn't wait?

609
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,792
What kind of a talk is this?

610
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:32,208
Mom, I can't be as generous as you …

611
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,042
Have sent all the plant pots to
Jhulandi's place today …

612
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:42,375
Just taste it!

613
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,208
Oh! How tangy is mustard oil!

614
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,000
Like it?

615
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,042
Oh yes!

616
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,542
You, really, sent your pots Mom?

617
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:52,583
You, really, could …?

618
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,167
Yes...

619
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,458
Arjun Mullick?

620
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:04,375
Where did you get this?

621
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:08,042
A patient had come …
laryngectomy …

622
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,125
I refused …

623
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:11,167
You know, I can't accept a new patient …

624
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,708
Mom … this is Arjun Mullick …

625
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:15,583
So?

626
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,833
Arjun Mullick …
don't you remember?

627
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:20,458
Who made us talk …

628
01:00:22,417 --> 01:00:23,833
when I was on the terrace …

629
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,792
Oh! That's why
he's not doing the show now …

630
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,375
Open your mouth!
Open!

631
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,542
A little more …

632
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,542
Great!

633
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:41,708
Hello!

634
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,583
Madam! This is Arjun …
Arjun Mullick …

635
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,667
from 91.9 Friends FM …

636
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,792
I cannot talk to you just now …
I'm extremely sorry …

637
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:50,833
Madam! I'm talking to you about
your daughter, Saheli …

638
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:53,875
She's standing on the terrace
and wants to end her life …

639
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:57,125
I'm connecting you
to your daughter … live …

640
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,125
Hold on …

641
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:01,250
Saheli, you know... there's a
great surprise waiting for you today …

642
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,417
Someone wants to talk to you …

643
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,833
Mom!
See if you can recognize her!

644
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:06,583
Remember?

645
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,458
Is this Arjun Mullick's house?

646
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,708
I'm Romila Chowdhury …

647
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:27,333
He and his son had come to
meet me this morning …

648
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,750
Please … come …

649
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,500
He has closed the door! …

650
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:40,208
Doesn't want to confront anyone …

651
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,042
Has gone into total depression …

652
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,708
Can you give me a piece of paper?
… Pen?

653
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:47,500
Ok! Just a minute!

654
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:10,292
Romila Chowdhury …
please open the door …

655
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
RJ … do you remember...

656
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,625
… I'd called you?

657
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:22,333
I'm your fan … I'm Saheli …

658
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:26,167
that foolish girl who stood on the terrace …

659
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,833
Mr. Mullick!

660
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:32,458
One night, you had connected
me and my daughter …

661
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,708
Have a lot of debts to square up …

662
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:40,083
The gratitude that we
couldn't show you that day …

663
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:41,917
today …

664
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,500
today we're here for that …

665
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,083
Will you teach my dad to talk?

666
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:51,500
You want me to do that … isn't it?

667
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:54,958
I give you my word …
your dad will speak again …

668
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:01,625
Mr. Mullick …

669
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,333
It is highly possible to
talk after laryngectomy …

670
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,625
but the cause of your depression is

671
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:07,667
you'll not be able to hold
radio shows any more … isn't it?

672
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:14,417
Come!

673
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,042
Together, let's take a challenge!

674
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:19,333
You'll hold radio shows again …

675
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:21,750
Yes!

676
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,000
Waiting for a long time?

677
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:53,292
No, no! It's ok.

678
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,958
Your husband …
let's not be formal …

679
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,708
Sure …

680
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,917
For your husband,
I postponed my ticket to Dhaka.

681
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,792
It was getting very difficult …

682
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,958
How did you happen to be in Kolkata?

683
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,500
I was born in Dhaka …

684
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:12,417
Studied Speech Therapy in London …

685
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,125
In fact, my...

686
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:18,583
ex-husband was from Kolkata …

687
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:20,208
Businessman …

688
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,625
Fought my case of divorce for six long months …

689
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,500
Got the custody of my daughter …

690
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,917
Actually, I got tired
fighting the divorce case …

691
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:30,208
But I'm charged again with
your husband's case …

692
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,083
Tell me … what will you have?

693
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:33,625
For me, Darjeeling tea …

694
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:34,708
But I'll pay …

695
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:37,167
This is my regular joint
… leave it!

696
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,667
Hey!

697
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,250
One Darjeeling tea for madam …

698
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:41,708
And my usual …

699
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:44,583
Cold coffee with a lot of cream …

700
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,125
May I...

701
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,375
ask you a question?

702
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,542
Yes...

703
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,208
Tell me …

704
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:03,083
Will Arjun, really, do a radio show?

705
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:12,000
Actually, everything depends on Arjun …

706
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:14,250
See … he'll be able to speak …

707
01:05:14,292 --> 01:05:17,333
but not like he did before …

708
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:20,667
Listen …
disease can take one of your lungs …

709
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,208
but the other lung is there …

710
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,708
if they take one of your kidneys …
there's another one …

711
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:29,542
you'll continue to live …
but live in a different way …

712
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:33,125
Actually, it's a little difficult
for your husband …

713
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:34,625
after all, he's a radio jockey …

714
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:37,250
a lively young man of forty wakes up

715
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:40,125
in the morning, to find that
he can't speak …

716
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,708
mentally, it's very shocking …

717
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:46,833
he has to start
afresh from the alphabets …

718
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,792
ka … kha … ga … gha …

719
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:51,417
English vowels … a e I o u

720
01:05:51,417 --> 01:05:55,417
Actually, accepting it is a bit difficult …

721
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:56,250
Ok...

722
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,167
tell me …

723
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,667
when does Arjun get up in the morning?

724
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:07,292
He used to get up at 9 …

725
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:11,000
His recitation students come in the morning …

726
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,375
Thank you …

727
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:16,625
His previous routine has remained as it is …

728
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:21,417
I've stopped the recitation class …

729
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,500
Oh my!

730
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:24,792
But why?

731
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,708
Pritha! Everything
has to be just like before.

732
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,417
Everything should be normal …

733
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:32,333
Suspension of the recitation class,
will force Arjun into deeper depression …

734
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,167
Resume it from tomorrow!

735
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:38,375
And tell me …
what kind of gift does he like?

736
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:44,167
Now take the turn …

737
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,333
be careful …
Turn carefully …

738
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:50,250
Bravo! Bravo! Very well done!

739
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:59,250
How are you? I'm good …

740
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:04,333
Didn't you come the other day?
Yes...

741
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,875
This side or that side?

742
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:11,042
Faridpur … and you?

743
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,167
Barisal …

744
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,250
To come a pike …
To go a pike...

745
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,292
That's called Barisal…

746
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:22,000
Where's my patient?

747
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,958
Inside the room …

748
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:28,083
Keeps himself confined the whole day …

749
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,500
Such a fresh young man …

750
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,500
What has happened to him …

751
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,042
Now that I've come …

752
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,625
just see what happens …

753
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,625
Go! …

754
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,500
Aren't you from Barisal?

755
01:07:57,417 --> 01:08:01,375
Then, where is the valour of a Barisalite?

756
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:06,375
Grab the tail and bravely
jump into work …

757
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,792
Then, only will people say …

758
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:13,583
a Barisalite father's Barisalite son …
come!

759
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,625
Come...

760
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,833
From now on …

761
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:28,625
this will be your style statement …

762
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:35,083
There should be a slight gap,

763
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:36,792
so that you don't
have any problem in breathing.

764
01:08:37,917 --> 01:08:40,875
Like Dev Anand … ok?

765
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,708
Now you'll wear this …

766
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,667
And this one is extra!

767
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:49,042
Today, we are going
on a date …

768
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:52,125
Your wife has, already, been informed!

769
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:53,917
Let's go!

770
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:58,292
I've extended my hand …
let's go!

771
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,667
Didn't know radio jockeys could
be so unsmart!

772
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:03,792
Come along!

773
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,042
What happened?

774
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,542
No! … No!

775
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:11,583
Only the car key!

776
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,542
Be careful!

777
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:16,042
Careful... don't fall!

778
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,750
Turn! Turn! … That's it!

779
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,958
When will you return?

780
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:40,958
How many times do I have
to tell that I can hear?

781
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,667
We are not doctors …

782
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,250
Do you know what people call us?...

783
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,292
Face physio …

784
01:09:57,917 --> 01:10:00,250
Not only laryngectomy patients …

785
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:04,458
A heart stroke patient
with a slurred speech …

786
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:06,417
those who stammer …
unable to get a job …

787
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:08,375
all these are our patients.

788
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:11,958
Nowadays, you don't get
good speech therapists in Kolkata …

789
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,958
Do you know why?

790
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:17,208
If you have to interact with a patient …

791
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,500
you'll have to know him,
must give him time … personal training …

792
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,083
and for that you have to dedicate
one to two hours …

793
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:26,417
While a doctor can see
more than fifteen patients within that time...

794
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:29,250
And in our case …
only five …

795
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,625
maximum six …

796
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:00,208
If you've to leave your old beloved

797
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:03,583
keep her number intact in your mobile.

798
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,750
Learn to ignore it …

799
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,667
If you want to give up smoking...

800
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:11,000
do it, by keeping the cigarette
packet on the table.

801
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:21,750
Listen to the radio …

802
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,083
feel the pain …

803
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:26,417
enjoy the pain …

804
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:28,708
but do not stop it.

805
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:32,083
Consider yourself to be a retired hurt …

806
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,125
And you'll come back …

807
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:37,958
And you'll come back with a bang!

808
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:50,792
Listening to the radio irritates him …

809
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:52,500
he just can't stand it …

810
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,292
the sound of radio …

811
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:58,708
I feel guilty even while reading the news …

812
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,833
But what can I do? …

813
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,625
Indrani …

814
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,708
I can't believe...

815
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:10,333
the man who laughed so much …
was so lively …

816
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,125
planning the evening programme
in the morning …

817
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,667
discussing with you all …

818
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:17,083
scanning the newspapers
to select the topic …

819
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:22,042
selecting songs to discuss
in the programme …

820
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:23,750
that man is...

821
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,375
...totally closed!

822
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,625
Manoj please!

823
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:30,542
Please involve him in something!

824
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:33,125
Feeling very scared about him!

825
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,750
Can't we involve him in writing scripts …

826
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:38,750
I mean …

827
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,625
he will write different scripts for the radio?

828
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,667
It's a fantastic idea …

829
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:47,083
Let's decide on a few topics,
go and tell him …

830
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,292
and take it forward …

831
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,083
Yes! That's it!

832
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,083
Very good idea!

833
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,167
Mr. Mullick …

834
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:05,958
you learnt your first
words from your mother.

835
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,583
Obviously with your windpipe …

836
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:13,292
for the second time in your life,
you'll talk through your foodpipe …

837
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:14,958
sip the lemonade …

838
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,375
sip it …

839
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,958
Now...

840
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:41,917
we'll hold a competition of
who can belch better …

841
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:43,625
Ok?

842
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:45,292
Long, long belches …

843
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:48,333
Belch beautifully, with ease …

844
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,958
Start …

845
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,208
Belch …

846
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:52,917
Don't be ashamed …

847
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,083
To belch is a normal thing …

848
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,125
Belch! … Come on, belch!

849
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:58,458
Yes! Belch!

850
01:14:02,542 --> 01:14:04,500
Long … large belches …

851
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,542
with ease …

852
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,542
I want it loud …

853
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,167
There it comes …
now do it …

854
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,167
That's it … bigger …
bigger … beautiful …

855
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:13,625
Louder … louder … more than that …

856
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:17,083
There it comes … beautiful belches …

857
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:20,167
Nothing to be ashamed … nothing …

858
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:22,125
Bigger belch …
a bigger belch is wanted …

859
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:27,500
Normal, normal, normal …
absolutely normal …

860
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,125
Listen… in our childhood, our mothers
and grandma's used to say

861
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:34,250
if you rub the back of the child,
it will help him to belch …

862
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:35,417
Now belch … belch … belch …

863
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:37,667
Big belches … loud belches …

864
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:39,917
That's it … Belch …

865
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:42,333
Louder please … louder …
more than that …

866
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:43,417
Here it comes …

867
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:45,667
Louder …
slightly more loud …

868
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,042
Great! now...

869
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:51,333
With this belch, you'll say...

870
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,333
'Aa'!

871
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,042
Just look at me …

872
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:01,500
Do it!

873
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,583
Yes, do it!

874
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,000
Do it...

875
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,125
Say it!

876
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:12,750
What happened?

877
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,708
Belch! Belch!
Try it! Try it!

878
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:16,208
Yes!

879
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,083
Aa … aa … aa …

880
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:20,333
Aa … try...

881
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:23,083
Great! Excellent!

882
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:26,875
Belching to speak is, actually, talking
through the esophageal voice …

883
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:29,583
that means talking through the food pipe …
See!

884
01:15:30,417 --> 01:15:34,375
How... are... you?

885
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,250
Now you go home and practice

886
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:39,417
'o', 'aa'

887
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,042
and English vowels –

888
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:48,958
a, e, I, o, u …

889
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:52,750
After this you'll be given
the 'First Book of Alphabets' …

890
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:55,375
What are you seeing?

891
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,667
What are you looking at?

892
01:15:57,667 --> 01:15:59,500
Mr. Arjun …

893
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,583
five sessions hence from today,

894
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,917
you'll speak your first word …

895
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,750
To speak, there's no such tactics …

896
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:13,375
Day and night, just
practice and practice.

897
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:03,042
Then, the herbal practitioner
came and said …

898
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:05,500
there's no remedy for this disease …

899
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:09,625
and allopath treatment would
not suit Thakur …

900
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:15,750
And then, ultimately,
Mahendralal Sarkar was called …

901
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:22,708
Mom! Granny! Come come!
Dad is speaking …

902
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,667
What?

903
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:27,667
I saw Dad speaking …

904
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:31,333
Don't drag! Granny will fall!
But I saw him speak!

905
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:32,500
Come quickly!

906
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:41,750
Speak Dad! Speak!

907
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:48,667
Dad! It will happen! It was
happening only a few moments back!

908
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:52,208
Do it Dad! Do it!

909
01:17:56,667 --> 01:17:59,833
Dad was speaking Mamma …

910
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:02,167
Looking at the mirror,
I saw him speaking …

911
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:05,292
Dad will do it!
Dad will speak!

912
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:07,667
Don't force him!
Let him try on his own!

913
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:11,667
My son! My dear!

914
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,792
Hey! Speak here!

915
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:43,292
No! You can't stop practice …

916
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:47,333
a, e, I, o, u …

917
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:51,875
you'll have to practice all the five vowels …

918
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:55,333
if you can't say them properly,
we're not meeting any more this week …

919
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,625
Ok? Bye …

920
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:04,750
Someone told me... the
waves of this ocean

921
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:12,375
Will drift me out into the sea …

922
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:16,625
Where the shore is a little smoother …

923
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:21,000
Covered by an all-encompassing light!

924
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:33,000
Keeping myself mum, no one
knows How am I living …

925
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:41,292
Sometimes I wake up from my sleep …

926
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:45,458
Are all of them singing
in full throated ease?

927
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:50,125
Covered by an all-encompassing light!

928
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:58,625
Sun has its home in my heart...

929
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:04,542
My eyes reflect my lust for life!

930
01:20:04,542 --> 01:20:09,292
My mind nests Himalayan hope...

931
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:13,958
Never asked for a receipt for buying time!

932
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:18,667
My God will recognize me

933
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:24,125
I'm standing at His door!

934
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:28,625
Dreaming the same dream everyday...

935
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:32,917
Covered by an all-encompassing light!

936
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:50,375
He is unable to bear it Romila!

937
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:53,208
He's unable! He's getting tired!

938
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:56,250
He lies in the room …
doesn't eat anything!

939
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:59,292
I help him in every possible way …

940
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:01,042
But that's wrong!

941
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:03,208
Why will you help?

942
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,542
From now on,
don't give him water with food …

943
01:21:07,542 --> 01:21:10,375
What? Let him ask for water!

944
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:13,000
Let him make the first sound!

945
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Let him gesticulate … Communicate
by movement of hands and feet …

946
01:21:17,042 --> 01:21:19,667
Stop sleeping with him …

947
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:23,000
What? Yes. Let him ask for it!

948
01:21:23,042 --> 01:21:26,583
Switch off all lights,
so that no gesticulation works!

949
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:30,458
Let him make sounds!

950
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:35,917
I can't do it, Romila!

951
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:46,375
Don't you want
Arjun to do radio shows again?

952
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:50,000
Don't you want
your old Arjun back?

953
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:53,750
This is called Need Block Theory!

954
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:57,958
Block all the necessary
things in his life.

955
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,167
Finish this...

956
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,667
Chew properly.

957
01:22:19,292 --> 01:22:20,292
Eat!

958
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:31,375
What do you want? Tell me!

959
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,667
Say what you want …

960
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,583
Wa…ter …

961
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:32,250
Won't you sleep?

962
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,167
Raise your voice!

963
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:36,625
Romila! He said
the vowels … just now …

964
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:40,917
Now he is saying 'o' 'aa' …

965
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:42,292
Listen!

966
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:48,958
Can you hear?

967
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,750
'K', 'kh' …

968
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,667
Say it …

969
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:06,583
It's more like dumb charades …

970
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:09,792
Each of us will say a riddle …

971
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:12,708
Arjun has to give the answer …

972
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:16,458
He has to speak it out.

973
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,458
Right everyone? Right!

974
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:21,667
Let's see what comes first!

975
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:28,458
Aunty!

976
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:29,417
Shall I say?

977
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:30,708
Oh yes!

978
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:34,167
I'll eat whatever you give me!

979
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:37,333
If you give water, I'll die!

980
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:40,250
Now, tell me who am I?

981
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:46,583
I'll eat whatever you give me!
If you give water, I'll die!

982
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,333
Now, tell me who am I?

983
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:55,542
Fire. Superb Arjun!
Superb! Superb!

984
01:27:58,333 --> 01:27:59,958
We've something to tell you!

985
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:02,958
In Barishal's language,
these are called 'polki'.

986
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,208
Tell him about the scripting …

987
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:09,833
Polki means puzzle or riddle …
which means 'couplet art'.

988
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:12,333
In UK there's a radio channel
called Fun Kids …

989
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:15,375
They make a lot of programs for children

990
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:17,333
Others are doing
a lot of good experiments …

991
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,500
We should also try and
invent some new programs …

992
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,500
Like Upendra Kishore,
Sukumar Roy's stories, Lila Mazumdar …

993
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:26,292
if we can make some radio plays
based on their stories …

994
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:29,042
See, you know it pretty well
we're fighting with hindi programs …

995
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:32,583
Bengali content is gradually
getting eroded … it's reducing …

996
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,333
I think it'll be a great challenge for us …

997
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,583
Tell him Manoj …

998
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:40,792
We should write a
good script … Pritha!

999
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,792
That should make a total difference …

1000
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:45,333
the show, the program,
the genre everything …

1001
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:47,042
His name is a three-letter word …

1002
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:49,333
Hey Arjun! You've to listen …

1003
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,000
His name is a three letter word

1004
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,875
He lives in water…

1005
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,083
You cut the middle letter

1006
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:58,375
It opens its wings to fly …

1007
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,292
Who am I?

1008
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:02,542
A three letter word...

1009
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:04,958
Cut the middle letter...

1010
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,000
It wil fly away …

1011
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:12,250
'Muittha' – the preparation
that you love so much.

1012
01:29:12,292 --> 01:29:13,708
She gave away the clue.

1013
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:18,958
Chi-

1014
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,500
Chitol …

1015
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:23,083
Excellent …

1016
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:25,208
Great Arjunda … great!

1017
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:37,000
My mother-in-law's gold bracelet
is not with me …

1018
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,250
I've tallied the list
and returned all the ornaments …

1019
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:45,042
Ok fine! I'll search for it again.

1020
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:48,583
See! Two things of my ex-husband
are with me …

1021
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:54,167
One is a pair of torn slippers …
And my wedding ring …

1022
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:57,333
Yes! I'll return them all!

1023
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,375
Why have I kept this?
Why at all?

1024
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:06,458
Does it have an answer?

1025
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:14,333
Why do relationships end so badly --
can you tell me?

1026
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:17,125
So much of dissection …?

1027
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:39,042
Breaking up gracefully...
leads to a new beginning...

1028
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:42,375
'Some of my belongings' … This song
doesn't fit into this situation …

1029
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:45,417
That you're an extremely cheeky person,
a mischievous fellow –

1030
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:48,375
has anyone ever told you that?

1031
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:55,917
What happened?

1032
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,417
Can't you drive carefully?

1033
01:31:00,417 --> 01:31:02,625
Will you die and kill me
at the same time?

1034
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,500
What's wrong?
What has happened?

1035
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,708
Talking in english!

1036
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,333
Why did you come this side?
We are on the right side!

1037
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:10,125
You should have slowed down …
not we …

1038
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:13,000
How were you driving your car?

1039
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,208
Talk gently!
Don't you know how to talk to a woman?

1040
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,042
So what? Women have
the right to kill us?

1041
01:31:19,042 --> 01:31:23,125
Driving like an uncivilized person!

1042
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:29,958
You scoundrel!

1043
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
How great! Give him!
Hurl more abuses at him …

1044
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Come on! Say … say … revile …

1045
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,333
Rascal!

1046
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:45,833
Wonderful! You say full sentences
when you are angry!

1047
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,625
This is the first time
you're speaking in public …

1048
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:51,583
Oh! Thank you brother!
Thank you!

1049
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:53,250
Thank you! Thank you!

1050
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:59,292
Let's go! Come!

1051
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,708
Abused me?

1052
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:06,250
Crazy or what?

1053
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:12,292
You did it! So proud of you!

1054
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,083
Two months after the operation,
he uttered the first word.

1055
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:27,042
Yes!

1056
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:31,042
Gave the doctor a four letter abuse …

1057
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:35,167
I used fifty per cent of
the word … fool …

1058
01:32:35,208 --> 01:32:39,708
The scoundrel could not understand
what I was saying … that's why …

1059
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:45,458
Depression...

1060
01:32:48,417 --> 01:32:53,000
While driving, if I see...

1061
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,792
a policeman taking bribes,

1062
01:32:56,792 --> 01:33:01,792
can't abuse him the way I did earlier …

1063
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:03,500
I miss that …

1064
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,500
Do you notice the similarity with you?

1065
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:10,458
Today he has called
the taxi driver a scoundrel …

1066
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:13,042
O God!

1067
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:18,500
We should celebrate this over a drink!

1068
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,500
Do you drink?

1069
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:24,708
I'm a regular drinker …

1070
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:28,333
I had cancer in larynx …
also in colon …

1071
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:32,250
I can't drink through the mouth …

1072
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:36,250
Hey! Let me!

1073
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:39,000
I have a pack
attached to my stomach...

1074
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,667
I administer it here
directly through the syringe …

1075
01:33:41,667 --> 01:33:42,708
Rum …

1076
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,667
The intoxication is perfect!

1077
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:47,500
What is this …

1078
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,583
What impression they'll have of you?

1079
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:53,292
They want to know about me …

1080
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,042
I've to tell – isn't it?

1081
01:33:57,042 --> 01:33:58,000
No... no!

1082
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,417
He was very depressed …

1083
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,625
Reviled even me …

1084
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:11,417
Once I dozed off in the hospital …
he threw the pillow at me …

1085
01:34:11,417 --> 01:34:13,917
Similarity here also …

1086
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:17,458
Splashed water on his wife's face …

1087
01:34:19,042 --> 01:34:20,375
Heard that?

1088
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:23,958
Exactly like me …

1089
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:29,125
How fast he writes …

1090
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:32,333
Other things are all normal?

1091
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:36,792
Yes! Other things are normal … But

1092
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:44,292
What exactly do you want to know?

1093
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:49,083
Sex life...?

1094
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:52,583
Why are you pricking me?

1095
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,792
The earlier desire is not there …
it has reduced …

1096
01:35:00,792 --> 01:35:04,500
I was given 30 chemos …

1097
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:08,250
But you'll have your
wife at your side …

1098
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:14,375
and you'll not caress her …
can that possibly happen?

1099
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:18,125
She is getting angry!

1100
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:22,333
See she's running away …

1101
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:26,292
She's feeling shy …

1102
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:37,542
But this wife is everything …

1103
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:40,750
They'll be at your side till the last …

1104
01:35:40,792 --> 01:35:43,625
Don't forget …

1105
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:52,792
Brought this sweet for you …

1106
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:55,167
Good! Keep it!

1107
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,208
Let me have one! Sure!

1108
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,250
First you?

1109
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:05,083
Pulak …

1110
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:06,542
our Pulak …

1111
01:36:06,542 --> 01:36:08,583
that Maths teacher …

1112
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:13,042
his tongue has been totally operated …

1113
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:16,042
not one word can be understood!

1114
01:36:16,042 --> 01:36:19,125
And, whenever, I visit him,
he asks for money …

1115
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:24,750
Says – all his money
has been spent for the disease …

1116
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:28,250
Strange! Did you ask me
before you started smoking?

1117
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:32,708
You want me to pay for your sins?

1118
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:36,292
Nowadays, I feel scared
to go to anyone's place …

1119
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,042
lest they ask for money …

1120
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:42,083
No! Here, of course, there's no
such fear … What do you say?

1121
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:46,458
The entire share of property
belongs to Arjun …

1122
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:51,125
Yet, he has kept,
a room for me upstairs …

1123
01:36:51,167 --> 01:36:54,167
nowadays who does that?

1124
01:36:54,167 --> 01:36:55,792
Pritha hasn't returned yet?

1125
01:36:55,792 --> 01:36:58,250
No … she's taken shift duty …

1126
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:00,958
Has to work for a longer time …

1127
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:03,792
Nowadays, Arjun doesn't have any work …

1128
01:37:03,792 --> 01:37:06,417
Sad! Full load is on that girl …

1129
01:37:06,417 --> 01:37:09,750
Now carry the burden of the entire family!

1130
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:12,167
Hush! Arjun has come!

1131
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:17,083
Hope, he has'nt heard us!

1132
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,292
Radio station is not sending
him any money?

1133
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:29,583
Money! He keeps himself
confined in the room …

1134
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:31,792
doesn't talk to anyone …

1135
01:37:31,833 --> 01:37:34,833
People do not survive once
they have this disease …

1136
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:38,667
That he's still living is a big thing …

1137
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:52,000
Very sad! The girl has to bear
the burden of Arjun for the entire life …

1138
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,500
The child must be brought up!

1139
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:16,667
What are you writing?

1140
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,625
How disheveled is your hair …

1141
01:38:24,042 --> 01:38:25,833
Am I...

1142
01:38:27,208 --> 01:38:28,958
...your...

1143
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:30,667
...burden?

1144
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:33,458
What...?

1145
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:38,208
Don't you understand?

1146
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:43,250
Am I your burden?

1147
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:45,000
Burden?

1148
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:04,083
Please! Please!

1149
01:39:41,792 --> 01:39:44,583
Sorry...!

1150
01:40:12,417 --> 01:40:14,417
It's almost like shaving!

1151
01:40:14,417 --> 01:40:18,375
At some point in your throat,
there's a sweet spot …

1152
01:40:18,417 --> 01:40:22,542
if you touch it, it vibrates … yes! yes!
Speak! Louder! Has to be clearer!

1153
01:40:22,542 --> 01:40:24,333
Yes, speak!
Hello!

1154
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,625
A little more clear …

1155
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:27,625
Hello! Arjun Mullick speaking …

1156
01:40:30,667 --> 01:40:32,167
Slightly louder!

1157
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:33,250
Hello, Pritha!

1158
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:34,583
Wonderful!

1159
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:38,958
I hate you!

1160
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,250
That's cute!

1161
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:45,333
Hello!

1162
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:47,375
Just like a robot!

1163
01:40:47,417 --> 01:40:50,042
Where's the sound coming from?

1164
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:52,500
From here!

1165
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,167
Hemlata!

1166
01:41:18,375 --> 01:41:21,333
Don't you've diabetes?
And you're stealing sweets!

1167
01:41:21,333 --> 01:41:25,958
Sorry! It's a mistake!
I'll never do it again!

1168
01:41:25,958 --> 01:41:30,792
Oh! I was so frightened
to hear that voice!

1169
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:37,417
We're dining out after such a long time!

1170
01:41:37,417 --> 01:41:41,708
But you'll have to be
careful about the food!

1171
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:46,458
Medicines … rules …
can't we talk avoiding these?

1172
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,833
Yes! We can!

1173
01:41:48,875 --> 01:41:51,625
Like, today, you'll place the order …

1174
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:55,417
You can't make gestures or
show the menu card …

1175
01:41:55,417 --> 01:41:59,458
Myself and Pritha … we're dumb …

1176
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:02,792
We'll only nod …

1177
01:42:02,833 --> 01:42:07,833
From now on … in all public places …
you'll speak …

1178
01:42:07,917 --> 01:42:09,833
In the market … or restaurant …

1179
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:15,083
For this reason … no one …
will be able to … stay with you …

1180
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:17,042
That's why no one stays …

1181
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:18,750
Very unromantic …

1182
01:42:21,417 --> 01:42:23,583
Please order …
feeling very hungry …

1183
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:26,042
Hello! Excuse me!

1184
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:34,708
Two …

1185
01:42:36,708 --> 01:42:39,167
Use the esophageal voice …

1186
01:42:56,750 --> 01:43:01,125
Strange!
You don't understand?

1187
01:43:03,375 --> 01:43:05,375
Sir … please show us
on the menu card …

1188
01:43:05,417 --> 01:43:07,500
And we will serve you.

1189
01:43:29,833 --> 01:43:33,750
Do you think leaving
the table will work?

1190
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:36,625
Will you not see
his fight with your own eyes?

1191
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:39,375
I can't see him like this …

1192
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:46,083
He needs both of us
by his side …

1193
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:52,750
Mentally, you know that
Radio Anchor Arjun

1194
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,708
can speak two hundred words
per minute …

1195
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:57,750
but, physically, now you can say only
twenty words per minute …

1196
01:43:57,792 --> 01:44:00,458
so when you'll try to speak fast,
it would get stuck,

1197
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,500
the reason why we stammer!

1198
01:44:02,542 --> 01:44:04,542
Rate Reduction Therapy…

1199
01:44:04,542 --> 01:44:08,333
While you're speaking,
if there is a need to talk faster, then don't talk…

1200
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:17,083
Take …your… time… and… say…
the… words… slowly… in.. a rhythm…

1201
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:20,542
Take this list. You have to buy everything
that is written on it…

1202
01:44:20,542 --> 01:44:23,208
Go Arjun… All the best.

1203
01:44:25,917 --> 01:44:26,500
Yes?

1204
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:29,458
Maggi?

1205
01:44:29,458 --> 01:44:30,542
Maggi?...Are you sure?

1206
01:44:30,583 --> 01:44:31,708
Give me the list

1207
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:33,500
Tea Leaves.

1208
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,708
What?...Tea Leaves?

1209
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,625
Slowly...

1210
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:39,250
Fortune...

1211
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:41,917
Mustard...

1212
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:44,000
Oil...

1213
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,042
Mustard Oil? Fortune Mustard Oil?

1214
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:49,792
O – unknown island someone is calling...

1215
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:55,292
A – the lighted candle in the postbox

1216
01:44:57,417 --> 01:45:01,333
E– Such a day when the picnic starts

1217
01:45:03,167 --> 01:45:07,417
OI – The plane in the sky shines in the sun

1218
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:13,125
Look at the sun that is setting

1219
01:45:14,542 --> 01:45:18,542
Music plays in the field rampart.

1220
01:45:31,667 --> 01:45:35,583
In the primer of this life

1221
01:45:37,417 --> 01:45:41,292
Let the words be good friends today

1222
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:45,833
Words are flying,
words are bonding

1223
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:48,417
Happiness like saving coins

1224
01:45:48,417 --> 01:45:51,042
Words bloom softly,
in whose lips

1225
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:54,083
Bloom the alphabets

1226
01:46:05,542 --> 01:46:08,417
Had a small introduction

1227
01:46:08,417 --> 01:46:11,250
The story has been enacted

1228
01:46:11,292 --> 01:46:14,208
If it advances further

1229
01:46:14,208 --> 01:46:15,708
Let it be.

1230
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:20,250
What flower is given
as an expression of love?

1231
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:22,417
Rose.

1232
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:24,667
Dose?

1233
01:46:24,708 --> 01:46:28,042
RJ is saying it right, why are you
unnecessarily harassing him?

1234
01:46:28,083 --> 01:46:31,250
Did you notice that his voice
is much clearer now?

1235
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:35,083
Are you deaf?

1236
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:37,250
See! He can say a full sentence.

1237
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:45,708
K – College Street, in a drenched tram

1238
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:51,667
KH – Bits of hay … the rain comes

1239
01:46:51,667 --> 01:46:56,958
G – The bye-lane and the vagabond

1240
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,042
GH – Song of the kite that flew away

1241
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:08,750
Look at the sun that is setting

1242
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:13,042
Music plays in the field concert.

1243
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:30,750
In the primer of this life

1244
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:36,458
Let the words be good friends today.

1245
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:22,708
If you could please update
my passbook…

1246
01:48:24,417 --> 01:48:27,208
This is not a machine but...

1247
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,167
a human speaking.

1248
01:48:29,167 --> 01:48:31,667
Why did you take the trouble to come?

1249
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:33,625
Your wife could have come!

1250
01:48:34,833 --> 01:48:35,708
Why?

1251
01:48:35,708 --> 01:48:38,125
Do you like my wife more?

1252
01:48:45,042 --> 01:48:48,875
Maa..what should I do
on parent's day?...

1253
01:48:48,875 --> 01:48:51,583
Last time Baba was with us…

1254
01:48:51,583 --> 01:48:54,542
Should you and I do something?

1255
01:48:54,542 --> 01:48:57,500
What should we do…?

1256
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,833
Tell what we should do...

1257
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:01,750
Goopi Bagha... Goopi Bagha… You
both are really good kids…

1258
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:04,375
Come to me, come to me!...

1259
01:49:04,417 --> 01:49:06,458
We'll enact Goopi Bagha?

1260
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:07,417
I'll be the King of the ghosts!

1261
01:49:07,417 --> 01:49:08,333
I'll be Goopi!

1262
01:49:08,958 --> 01:49:11,708
Goopi Bagha... Goopi Bagha… You
both are really good kids…

1263
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:14,708
Come to me, come to me!...

1264
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:16,792
Do you know us?

1265
01:49:16,833 --> 01:49:18,833
You know our names?

1266
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:21,917
I know your names,
address…everything!

1267
01:49:21,958 --> 01:49:24,583
The king drove you away…

1268
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:27,167
Oh the way you helped him!

1269
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:30,417
Where you'll go, what
you'll do you don't know!

1270
01:49:30,417 --> 01:49:34,292
Seriously Rajamoshai,
we are really sad!

1271
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:37,083
We don't know what to do!

1272
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,792
I'm there, I'm there, I'm
the King of Ghosts...

1273
01:49:39,792 --> 01:49:43,333
If I'm happy, I'll
fulfill your wishes.

1274
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:45,708
Three wishes, Three
wishes, Three wishes!

1275
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:48,667
Three wishes!

1276
01:49:48,667 --> 01:49:52,500
We should never have to worry
about food and clothes…

1277
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:56,833
Alright! … If you want
food then you should clap…

1278
01:49:56,875 --> 01:49:59,208
If you want clothes then you should clap…

1279
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:01,792
One of you should clap the other's hand

1280
01:50:01,792 --> 01:50:04,542
What other wishes do you desire?

1281
01:50:04,542 --> 01:50:07,500
We really love to travel dear King!

1282
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:10,917
Wear the shoes, name the place
that you want to visit

1283
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:13,583
and then clap each other's hands.

1284
01:50:13,583 --> 01:50:19,417
Also, dear King, if we could entertain
everyone with our songs and music..

1285
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:21,500
Sure! It would be so.

1286
01:50:21,542 --> 01:50:25,125
There will be songs and
drums, music and rhythm,

1287
01:50:25,167 --> 01:50:31,292
Whoever will listen will be
stunned and will be still!

1288
01:50:36,417 --> 01:50:37,583
Excellent!
Great!

1289
01:50:38,542 --> 01:50:40,458
A laryngectomy patient...

1290
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:43,375
will be a radio jockey…

1291
01:50:44,167 --> 01:50:46,083
will be a radio jockey!

1292
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:50,417
We will do a show which
will be named…

1293
01:50:50,417 --> 01:50:52,000
Name?
Yes..Tell me…

1294
01:50:52,042 --> 01:50:53,833
I need a show name…

1295
01:50:53,833 --> 01:50:55,917
Ju..Juju?

1296
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:56,875
Juju!

1297
01:50:56,917 --> 01:51:02,250
Juju who scares you
and Juju who is the friend..

1298
01:51:04,083 --> 01:51:07,875
There is a website named 'Web Whisper'
by laryngectomy patients…

1299
01:51:07,917 --> 01:51:10,583
Really? Yes…exactly!

1300
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:13,000
There are many laryngectomy patients

1301
01:51:13,042 --> 01:51:16,083
who sing, do rap, do robot rap…
We should definitely

1302
01:51:16,125 --> 01:51:17,292
let them know this.

1303
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:20,042
This sounds very
good… very good!

1304
01:51:20,042 --> 01:51:21,833
Yes… Absolutely!

1305
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:27,417
You all, often, don't understand
what I am saying...

1306
01:51:27,417 --> 01:51:32,083
and I'm going to do
a professional radio show?

1307
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:35,208
Radio is very personal…

1308
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:38,458
I don't want to be a
laughing stock Manoj.

1309
01:51:40,417 --> 01:51:44,833
Romila, I can't do a show…sorry!

1310
01:51:45,333 --> 01:51:46,500
Arjun!

1311
01:51:50,583 --> 01:51:51,917
Romila please see…

1312
01:51:51,958 --> 01:51:52,875
Arjun!

1313
01:51:52,917 --> 01:51:55,125
I'll see, don't worry!

1314
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:56,583
Arjun…

1315
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,625
Come with me.

1316
01:52:06,583 --> 01:52:09,167
Ticket... ticket

1317
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:10,208
How are you?

1318
01:52:10,208 --> 01:52:11,250
All well?

1319
01:52:11,292 --> 01:52:12,792
Yes, very well.

1320
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:16,792
It has been 5 years…

1321
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:18,750
Ganeshda has never stopped..

1322
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,667
He has kept on doing his work...

1323
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:23,750
Here..take this.

1324
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:31,292
Vascular system is something
which keeps a man alive…

1325
01:52:31,333 --> 01:52:32,958
Come inside…

1326
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:36,417
Hello…How are you?
Should we come in?

1327
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:38,042
Going on fine?

1328
01:52:38,083 --> 01:52:40,875
So, let me finish with the class…

1329
01:52:40,875 --> 01:52:42,417
I hope you are well!

1330
01:52:42,417 --> 01:52:43,167
Yes sir..

1331
01:52:43,917 --> 01:52:45,667
Dr. Romen Samaddar…

1332
01:52:45,667 --> 01:52:47,583
It has been three years Arjun!

1333
01:52:48,542 --> 01:52:50,292
He is continuing his own profession…

1334
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:53,208
he didn't stop!

1335
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:55,042
He teaches Cardiology.

1336
01:52:57,542 --> 01:52:59,000
Arjun…

1337
01:52:59,042 --> 01:53:01,167
You are not doing
this show for yourself…

1338
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,708
You'll do this for Somnathda…

1339
01:53:06,375 --> 01:53:09,125
You'll do it for all the cancer patients.

1340
01:53:13,917 --> 01:53:16,958
A hawker, a professor,
a bus conductor…

1341
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,958
The Creator has taken
away so many of their voices…

1342
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:22,875
But they all returned to their
professions, due to will power

1343
01:53:22,875 --> 01:53:25,292
and you are saying you
won't be able to do it?

1344
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:32,208
The world doesn't get to
know about these people…

1345
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:37,042
But you can share
their stories with the world…

1346
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:40,667
Don't give up Arjun…
don't give up

1347
01:53:40,667 --> 01:53:42,333
You are their hope…

1348
01:53:42,375 --> 01:53:44,250
You are their voice...

1349
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,083
You can't fail the human race.

1350
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:49,458
At least let one person
talk against this disease

1351
01:53:49,458 --> 01:53:51,917
For now we have got a weekend show

1352
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:53,958
and management has approved…

1353
01:53:53,958 --> 01:53:55,500
The show has been
confirmed… Absolutely!

1354
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:58,042
On Sunday morning,
from 11.00 to 1.00 …

1355
01:53:58,083 --> 01:54:00,208
The name of the show is 'Juju'

1356
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,625
And we'll also going
live on facebook…yes!

1357
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:06,833
The whole world will know that
a laryngectomy patient is conducting a show…

1358
01:54:06,875 --> 01:54:08,583
You must do it…

1359
01:54:08,583 --> 01:54:11,583
Arjun…Arjun…

1360
01:54:14,125 --> 01:54:15,125
Me?

1361
01:55:17,083 --> 01:55:20,042
Happy Anniversary!

1362
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:32,167
I don't get the odour of
your body anymore.

1363
01:55:39,083 --> 01:55:41,458
Are you angry with me?

1364
01:55:46,708 --> 01:55:49,292
Today is a very special day!

1365
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:53,250
Manoj informed...

1366
01:55:55,167 --> 01:55:58,375
That the show has been confirmed.

1367
01:56:01,458 --> 01:56:08,542
Romila took me to a lot of places today…

1368
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,792
I met so many people…

1369
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:26,667
I, really, missed you today…

1370
01:56:31,542 --> 01:56:35,167
You spent the whole day with Romila?

1371
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:46,083
I have collected a lot of journals for Arjun
and there are many case histories…

1372
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:54,250
And see this pen drive contains
a lot of videos of patients.

1373
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:59,625
If only the sound of breathing could be slightly
reduced from the stroma…

1374
01:56:59,667 --> 01:57:02,625
otherwise the voice is absolutely
clear…what do you say?

1375
01:57:04,417 --> 01:57:06,792
I'm super excited Pritha…
I'm super excited!

1376
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:09,292
I feel like I am…

1377
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:11,500
…not Arjun… I'm
conducting the show.

1378
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:14,208
I don't want your presence
on the show that day…

1379
01:57:18,417 --> 01:57:21,417
I don't want...

1380
01:57:21,417 --> 01:57:23,250
...you to be there
on Arjun's show…

1381
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:31,500
He can do everything
now… he can even speak…

1382
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:34,375
I want him to do
everything on his own…

1383
01:57:36,083 --> 01:57:40,000
The way you're feeling today that
you are conducting the show instead of Arjun…

1384
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,500
I have felt the same way
for the last 22 years.

1385
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:46,417
In Caledonia of Scottish College
our first audio play …

1386
01:57:46,417 --> 01:57:48,250
He rehearsed in front of
me that whole night…

1387
01:57:48,292 --> 01:57:51,167
And when the next day
he was participating in the competition,

1388
01:57:51,167 --> 01:57:53,208
I felt I was standing there...
right beside him!

1389
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,250
'Biday Abhishap' in Jadavpur Gandhi Bhaban,
I was there beside him…

1390
01:57:59,292 --> 01:58:02,417
Our first reading of Purnendu Patri's
'Prothom Kathopokathan' in All India Radio…

1391
01:58:02,417 --> 01:58:04,667
From then on, 'Kathopokathan'
became our life…

1392
01:58:04,708 --> 01:58:07,750
Arjun and Pritha's pair…
we were going everywhere together…

1393
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:16,792
I want my Arjun back…

1394
01:58:16,833 --> 01:58:18,292
Romila…

1395
01:58:18,333 --> 01:58:20,292
I want him back…

1396
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:27,000
I'm aware how much
you've contributed in Arjun's life…

1397
01:58:30,125 --> 01:58:31,750
But…

1398
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:36,083
I can never let go of that day…

1399
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:38,833
…Please!

1400
01:58:42,458 --> 01:58:46,167
I envy Arjun's dependence on you…

1401
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:52,542
What's your relationship
with him?

1402
01:58:58,583 --> 01:59:03,042
The relationship between a
speech pathologist and a patient …

1403
01:59:04,458 --> 01:59:05,292
That's all?

1404
01:59:05,833 --> 01:59:07,083
That's all.

1405
01:59:21,958 --> 01:59:23,833
Then keep this…

1406
01:59:26,417 --> 01:59:28,625
This is your fees…

1407
01:59:31,125 --> 01:59:32,958
And thank you!

1408
01:59:43,375 --> 01:59:45,542
Pritha, you didn't want
to know even for once...

1409
01:59:45,542 --> 01:59:47,958
why I'm giving the journals to you?...

1410
01:59:49,208 --> 01:59:52,833
Why did I give the case histories
to you only?...

1411
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:55,833
Why did I give those videos
to only you?...

1412
02:00:01,708 --> 02:00:03,708
Because...

1413
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,708
My journey has also
come to an end, Pritha...!

1414
02:00:12,833 --> 02:00:15,458
I have to return to Dhaka.

1415
02:00:19,292 --> 02:00:23,833
The most important life support to
a laryngectomy patient...

1416
02:00:23,833 --> 02:00:25,708
...is his wife!

1417
02:00:28,083 --> 02:00:32,625
So many people leave their near
and dear ones at such junctures of life.

1418
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:38,208
I have seen, so many cancer patients
being abandoned by their relatives.

1419
02:00:42,417 --> 02:00:46,000
Pritha, I'm absolutely
charmed by you.

1420
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:51,708
It was good that you said it.

1421
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:55,250
Even if you hadn't told me,

1422
02:00:55,292 --> 02:00:58,167
I would not have stayed
for the show...

1423
02:01:02,458 --> 02:01:04,708
Arjun is yours, Pritha…

1424
02:01:06,208 --> 02:01:08,333
…all yours…

1425
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:18,250
I won't be able to accept the
fees… neither from you nor Arjun…

1426
02:01:26,458 --> 02:01:31,792
The love that I have received
before leaving India for Dhaka…

1427
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:34,000
that is my biggest reward…

1428
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,333
I hope our friendship lasts…

1429
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,583
What happened Mom?

1430
02:01:47,708 --> 02:01:50,583
Come, we'll have to return…

1431
02:01:50,583 --> 02:01:52,667
All the patients in Dhaka are waiting …

1432
02:01:56,583 --> 02:02:03,958
Take me back, I have been
here for a long time...

1433
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:15,125
I have heard that many unsaid
words float in the sky there...

1434
02:02:15,167 --> 02:02:18,750
Covered by an all-encompassing light!

1435
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,583
Further away...

1436
02:02:27,625 --> 02:02:32,375
Making conscience my company

1437
02:02:32,417 --> 02:02:36,458
Arjun I'm sorry…I have to return to
Dhaka for some important reasons…

1438
02:02:36,458 --> 02:02:38,542
You have to conduct the show alone…

1439
02:02:38,583 --> 02:02:39,542
Best of luck!

1440
02:02:39,542 --> 02:02:43,917
The golden rays of the sun
has woven a collage there

1441
02:02:43,958 --> 02:02:47,583
Covered by an all-encompassing light!

1442
02:02:53,542 --> 02:02:57,375
Sun has its home in my heart...

1443
02:02:58,375 --> 02:03:02,375
My eyes reflect my lust for life...

1444
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:06,792
My mind nests Himalayan hope

1445
02:03:08,292 --> 02:03:10,792
Never asked for a
receipt for buying time

1446
02:03:12,667 --> 02:03:16,667
My God will recognize me

1447
02:03:17,458 --> 02:03:21,333
I'm standing at His door...

1448
02:03:22,667 --> 02:03:25,667
Dreaming the same dream everyday

1449
02:03:30,042 --> 02:03:31,958
'Art defeats cancer'!

1450
02:04:27,125 --> 02:04:29,125
Mom … Mom …
Hmm?

1451
02:04:29,167 --> 02:04:31,417
Arjun uncle is calling...

1452
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:34,458
It's okay… we shouldn't pick up.

1453
02:04:34,458 --> 02:04:35,792
Don't pick up…

1454
02:04:35,833 --> 02:04:38,083
He has a show today… he needs
to concentrate. Leave it…

1455
02:04:38,958 --> 02:04:41,208
Please give back the keys…

1456
02:05:21,417 --> 02:05:23,333
Welcome friends!

1457
02:05:23,333 --> 02:05:25,750
You're with Juju …

1458
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:27,792
In the world of Juju...

1459
02:05:27,833 --> 02:05:32,417
This morning, Juju will talk
with his friends …

1460
02:05:32,417 --> 02:05:35,333
Let's see which friend is on the line …

1461
02:05:37,333 --> 02:05:40,375
Madam, previously he used to do
shows in the night …

1462
02:05:40,417 --> 02:05:43,875
And then after he had cancer,
his voice had to be operated …

1463
02:05:43,917 --> 02:05:45,167
But he has come back …

1464
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:48,167
Hello Juju! How're you?

1465
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:51,417
I'm good … How're you?

1466
02:05:51,417 --> 02:05:52,542
I'm fine …

1467
02:05:53,125 --> 02:05:54,542
Who is talking?

1468
02:05:54,542 --> 02:05:55,292
I'm Rob …

1469
02:05:56,542 --> 02:05:58,667
Hello Rob! How're you?

1470
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:01,458
Who all are there in your home?

1471
02:06:01,458 --> 02:06:06,333
My mom is there, my dad is there
and my little sister … Puchki!

1472
02:06:06,375 --> 02:06:08,250
Oh...

1473
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:09,583
Puchki?

1474
02:06:11,375 --> 02:06:15,000
Who is more naughty –
you or Puchki?

1475
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,667
I'm more naughty …

1476
02:06:16,667 --> 02:06:19,083
Silently, I eat my sister's tiffin …

1477
02:06:19,125 --> 02:06:22,500
Oneday, I cut off her doll's hair.

1478
02:06:24,417 --> 02:06:25,375
Show... how many?

1479
02:06:25,375 --> 02:06:26,292
Show is a hit!

1480
02:06:26,292 --> 02:06:27,750
Superb! Superb!

1481
02:06:30,042 --> 02:06:34,833
Oh my God!
What a sultry morning!

1482
02:06:35,417 --> 02:06:38,875
Let me see which friend is on the line.

1483
02:06:42,292 --> 02:06:45,208
Hello Juju! I'm Tiasha speaking …

1484
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:47,250
Tiasha Pal …

1485
02:06:47,292 --> 02:06:49,250
I live in New Alipur …

1486
02:06:51,375 --> 02:06:53,583
Where are you Juju?

1487
02:06:54,583 --> 02:06:56,417
Juju, where have you gone?

1488
02:06:56,417 --> 02:06:58,417
What happened?

1489
02:07:01,708 --> 02:07:04,583
Juju … Have you returned to Mars?

1490
02:07:06,417 --> 02:07:09,333
I want to talk to you …

1491
02:07:09,958 --> 02:07:11,708
Juju …

1492
02:07:11,708 --> 02:07:15,667
Will you please raise the volume?

1493
02:07:15,667 --> 02:07:17,833
Hey Juju!

1494
02:07:17,917 --> 02:07:20,042
Why aren't you talking to me?

1495
02:07:20,083 --> 02:07:21,167
Battery exhausted!

1496
02:07:22,542 --> 02:07:24,417
Wait! Shall I come?

1497
02:07:26,083 --> 02:07:28,667
Please stop the car for a while.

1498
02:07:30,292 --> 02:07:32,708
Juju, I want to be your friend …

1499
02:07:33,417 --> 02:07:34,875
Juju, do not go back to Mars …

1500
02:07:35,417 --> 02:07:36,875
Manoj go and check!

1501
02:07:36,875 --> 02:07:38,458
Feeling very tensed …

1502
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,708
Esophageal...

1503
02:07:43,708 --> 02:07:45,458
Arjun try your esophageal voice...

1504
02:07:45,458 --> 02:07:47,542
Mom! Juju is not talking …

1505
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:53,167
He cannot hear!

1506
02:07:53,167 --> 02:07:55,167
Backup sound should start …

1507
02:07:55,208 --> 02:07:57,000
No no...
Don't go anywhere!

1508
02:07:58,333 --> 02:08:01,833
I want to talk to Juju,
but he's not talking at all!

1509
02:08:02,833 --> 02:08:03,917
Hello!...

1510
02:08:04,708 --> 02:08:06,833
I'm Muju speaking!

1511
02:08:06,875 --> 02:08:08,083
Muju?

1512
02:08:08,125 --> 02:08:10,375
Yes! I'm Muju …

1513
02:08:10,417 --> 02:08:12,750
Let's go!

1514
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:14,667
I'm...

1515
02:08:14,667 --> 02:08:17,667
Juju's brother Muju speaking …

1516
02:08:18,708 --> 02:08:21,958
Juju has gone to have ice cream …

1517
02:08:23,125 --> 02:08:24,958
He's naughty!

1518
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:29,417
Ice cream is not available
in our Mars …

1519
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:33,500
So he has gone to have ice cream …

1520
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:36,500
He said it in esophageal voice …
isn't it Mom?

1521
02:08:37,667 --> 02:08:40,000
I love vanilla more than anything else …

1522
02:08:40,042 --> 02:08:41,083
I also …

1523
02:08:41,125 --> 02:08:44,417
Tell me …
can Juju have ice cream?

1524
02:08:44,417 --> 02:08:47,000
Yes! He can!

1525
02:08:47,042 --> 02:08:50,958
He loves to have ice cream.

1526
02:08:51,417 --> 02:08:56,417
Do you know on my last birthday
I fed everyone with ice cream?

1527
02:08:56,417 --> 02:08:59,292
Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce …

1528
02:08:59,333 --> 02:09:01,333
Did you ever have it Muju?

1529
02:09:01,375 --> 02:09:02,958
It's my hot favourite!

1530
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:04,833
I love to have it!

1531
02:09:04,833 --> 02:09:06,458
Please have it once!

1532
02:09:06,458 --> 02:09:08,375
Will you come to my house one day?

1533
02:09:08,417 --> 02:09:09,125
Hello …

1534
02:09:09,125 --> 02:09:12,792
Then I'll feed you with the
Vanilla Ice Cream with chocolate sauce …

1535
02:09:12,792 --> 02:09:14,542
Also bring Juju with you …

1536
02:09:14,542 --> 02:09:17,208
Is it working? Fantastic …

1537
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:18,250
It's working Manoj!

1538
02:09:19,333 --> 02:09:21,208
Hello Muju!

1539
02:09:21,208 --> 02:09:23,208
Where have you gone?

1540
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:24,542
Juju has returned …

1541
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:28,333
Hello Muju! How dare you?

1542
02:09:28,375 --> 02:09:32,833
How dare you keep me away
from my friends?

1543
02:09:32,833 --> 02:09:34,917
Mom! Juju has come back!

1544
02:09:34,958 --> 02:09:37,958
Why are you so envious?

1545
02:09:38,417 --> 02:09:41,042
Juju …
now our Madam will come to teach us …

1546
02:09:41,042 --> 02:09:46,083
Our Madam will, also, come
to teach me and Muju …

1547
02:09:46,125 --> 02:09:47,708
You also have a Madam?

1548
02:09:47,708 --> 02:09:51,375
Yes! But now she has taken leave …

1549
02:09:52,167 --> 02:09:56,292
That's why I found time
to come and talk with you!

1550
02:09:57,792 --> 02:09:59,792
Do you know, our Madam is...

1551
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:01,125
very sweet …

1552
02:10:04,042 --> 02:10:05,958
and...

1553
02:10:05,958 --> 02:10:07,458
very...

1554
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:10,417
strict at the same time …

1555
02:10:10,958 --> 02:10:13,125
How so?

1556
02:10:13,167 --> 02:10:15,750
Our Madam says...

1557
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:19,167
In order to talk, you don't
need to apply any tactics …

1558
02:10:19,208 --> 02:10:23,208
Day and night only
practice and practice!

1559
02:10:24,042 --> 02:10:28,417
For our beautiful Madam,
here's a beautiful song ̶

1560
02:10:28,417 --> 02:10:31,167
Friends … you also continue to listen …

1561
02:10:31,208 --> 02:10:35,000
In Mars, we also listen to this song …

1562
02:10:55,125 --> 02:11:02,458
On your birthday, amidst
so many secret envelopes

1563
02:11:02,458 --> 02:11:05,542
I'll also sing a song …

1564
02:11:07,625 --> 02:11:18,667
Among your flower pots, I'll also bathe
In the different shades of sunlight!

1565
02:11:37,042 --> 02:11:41,458
Melodies rise from the piano

1566
02:11:41,458 --> 02:11:45,500
Sunrays come running in the noon

1567
02:11:45,542 --> 02:11:49,667
Emotions raise their heads

1568
02:11:49,708 --> 02:11:53,042
To throw me on the sea shore

1569
02:11:53,083 --> 02:11:56,167
Knowing it well there's no hope

1570
02:11:56,208 --> 02:12:01,292
I start getting thinner
like the shadows!

1571
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:11,958
On your birthday, amidst
so many secret envelopes

1572
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,208
I'll also sing a song …

1573
02:12:33,958 --> 02:12:38,125
People floating in the air

1574
02:12:38,167 --> 02:12:42,417
Give you bunches of flowers

1575
02:12:42,417 --> 02:12:46,583
None of them will try to find out

1576
02:12:46,625 --> 02:12:49,625
That I roam with so many letters

1577
02:12:49,667 --> 02:12:52,958
Knowing it well there's no hope

1578
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:58,083
I start fading out in
the evening of winter!

1579
02:13:01,417 --> 02:13:05,458
On your birthday,

1580
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:08,750
amidst so many secret envelopes

1581
02:13:08,792 --> 02:13:11,792
I'll also sing a song …

1582
02:13:17,792 --> 02:13:21,750
Hello Juju brother! Please
don't be angry with me!

1583
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:23,708
Now I'm far away!

1584
02:13:23,708 --> 02:13:25,500
I didn't get to say goodbye…

1585
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:27,333
That's why I'm writing to you now!

1586
02:13:28,208 --> 02:13:30,542
You have to help me with a lot of work…

1587
02:13:30,958 --> 02:13:34,833
After the death of Somnathda, the Laryngectomy
club is on the verge of getting closed …

1588
02:13:35,292 --> 02:13:37,417
You have to continue it…

1589
02:13:38,833 --> 02:13:41,542
You are listening to Juju…

1590
02:13:41,542 --> 02:13:44,083
And you have to continue
your show as well…

1591
02:13:44,708 --> 02:13:47,000
You are an inspiration
to a lot of people…

1592
02:13:55,625 --> 02:13:58,292
I have joined a hospital in Dhaka…

1593
02:13:58,333 --> 02:14:00,417
Saheli has also started
going to a new school…

1594
02:14:00,417 --> 02:14:03,208
We are very happy here…

1595
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,083
Juju brother…we'll definitely
meet… someday or the other!

1596
02:14:11,125 --> 02:14:13,083
I'm giving you my word…

1597
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,167
'Ei Somoy – Aloye Phera'

1598
02:14:22,583 --> 02:14:25,417
Show of the Year goes to…

1599
02:14:26,042 --> 02:14:27,708
Any guesses?

1600
02:14:31,125 --> 02:14:33,375
Juju...

1601
02:14:39,167 --> 02:14:42,292
I would like to call
RJ Arjun Mullick on stage

1602
02:14:42,333 --> 02:14:44,042
Go Guru…

1603
02:14:44,042 --> 02:14:45,208
Go for it!

1604
02:14:48,958 --> 02:14:54,583
Arjun will receive this award from that
phenomenal personality, our most favorite

1605
02:14:54,583 --> 02:14:56,583
…Usha Utthup.

1606
02:15:13,625 --> 02:15:15,333
Thank you so much Usha di…

1607
02:15:15,375 --> 02:15:17,500
We are, immensely, grateful…

1608
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:20,333
I would request Arjun to say a few words…

1609
02:15:27,167 --> 02:15:28,250
Hello!

1610
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:35,167
I never thought that I could retain

1611
02:15:35,208 --> 02:15:39,583
the smile and return in front of all of you…

1612
02:15:39,583 --> 02:15:42,667
was beyond my expectation!

1613
02:15:42,708 --> 02:15:46,958
I am here because of
some people in my life…

1614
02:15:48,375 --> 02:15:51,125
My Doctor…Dr. Majumdar…

1615
02:15:55,917 --> 02:15:57,292
Proud of you!

1616
02:15:58,333 --> 02:16:00,333
My...

1617
02:16:00,333 --> 02:16:02,750
...teacher...

1618
02:16:02,750 --> 02:16:04,167
my guide…

1619
02:16:04,208 --> 02:16:05,542
Romila Choudhury.

1620
02:16:05,542 --> 02:16:07,417
She is in Dhaka now…

1621
02:16:10,875 --> 02:16:15,917
My friends at the radio station
who never let me slacken…

1622
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:19,292
Manoj…

1623
02:16:20,625 --> 02:16:23,542
Thank you!

1624
02:16:23,542 --> 02:16:24,958
Indrani...

1625
02:16:26,250 --> 02:16:28,042
She never let me feel alone!

1626
02:16:32,667 --> 02:16:40,667
And my son Tukai who loves
my robot voice the most!

1627
02:16:40,667 --> 02:16:43,708
Tukai … Dad mentioned your name!

1628
02:16:47,375 --> 02:16:49,333
And that person,

1629
02:16:50,625 --> 02:16:53,208
Who endured everything…

1630
02:16:53,250 --> 02:16:59,250
My helplessness… my
anger…my depression…

1631
02:17:00,833 --> 02:17:03,500
People say that...

1632
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:09,500
the most important life support
for a cancer patient is his wife…

1633
02:17:21,125 --> 02:17:23,292
Pritha…

1634
02:17:25,917 --> 02:17:27,292
...love you…

1635
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:37,458
And I want to thank my audience
who, regularly, listen to my show…

1636
02:17:39,417 --> 02:17:43,542
For loving my...

1637
02:17:43,583 --> 02:17:45,292
...mechanical voice!

1638
02:17:45,333 --> 02:17:48,333
I would like to call on stage

1639
02:17:48,333 --> 02:17:54,333
my friends from
the Laryngectomy Club…

1640
02:18:02,042 --> 02:18:04,458
My fight…

1641
02:18:04,458 --> 02:18:06,833
Our fight…

1642
02:18:06,875 --> 02:18:14,208
is against Him… to whom,
I wish to say, from this stage…

1643
02:18:35,917 --> 02:18:38,167
I'm made of clay,
I'm the embodiment of the Soul.

1644
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:41,708
I'm imperishable, inexhaustible,
immortal.

1645
02:18:45,417 --> 02:18:48,833
I intimidate the humans, demons and gods.
I'm ever-unconquerable.

1646
02:18:48,875 --> 02:18:55,125
I'm the God of gods, the
supreme humanity.

1647
02:18:59,625 --> 02:19:04,208
I'm traversing the heaven and earth!

1648
02:19:07,083 --> 02:19:14,500
I'm mad, I'm mad! I have realized myself,
all the barriers have crumbled away!!

1649
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:28,417
I'm the Rebel Brighu, I'll stamp
my footprint on God's chest...

1650
02:19:28,417 --> 02:19:32,333
Sleeping away indifferently,
whimsically, While the creation suffers.

1651
02:19:32,375 --> 02:19:35,750
I'll tear apart the chest
of the whimsical God!

1652
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:41,708
I'm the Rebel Brighu, I'll stamp
my footprint on God's chest...

1653
02:19:45,292 --> 02:19:49,000
I'll tear apart the chest
of the whimsical God!

1654
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,292
I'm the eternal Rebel...

1655
02:19:51,333 --> 02:19:54,042
I have risen beyond this world,

1656
02:19:54,042 --> 02:19:56,375
alone with my head ever held high!
