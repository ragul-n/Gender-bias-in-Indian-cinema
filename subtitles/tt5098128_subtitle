SUBTITLE MADE BY INSANBIASA (FUHH PENAT GILER NAK BUAT!)

2
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,060
Starving.

3
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,620
Sex.

4
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,420
Sleep..

5
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,260
Three things are the basic things that humans and animals need.

6
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,660
But the thing that sets us apart from animals is emotions.

7
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,180
Butterflies on Bank Street.

8
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,700
Beautiful, right?

9
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,740
Yes, very beautiful.

10
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,140
But do you know?

11
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,860
If a butterfly flutters its wings ..

12
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,580
There are places in America that are about to be hit by a hurricane.

13
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,940
Is he sir?

14
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,940
Don't you know?

15
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,700
Come here.

16
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,260
Come on, come on everyone.

17
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,780
There is a butterfly.

18
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,980
And it has wings.

19
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,340
When he moves his wings, low pressure will form.

20
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,260
Because of the different pressure, the air will be added ...

21
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,100
..so that the existing air will get support ..

22
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,020
So a hurricane will form in America.

23
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,460
Interesting right?

24
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
Very interesting, sir.

25
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,820
Actually, why did I hit you just now?

26
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,940
We don't throw our cups in the trash.

27
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,580
Why do I want to hit you for that?

28
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,540
We've already thrown it away.

29
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,220
Get rid of it quickly.

30
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,620
Alamak ..

31
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,140
You're hurt.

32
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,500
Why do I act like that just because of a small problem?

33
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,060
Emotions don't match the situation.

34
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,980
It should have been shown elsewhere.

35
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Where did that emotion come from?

36
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,980
Encik Abhiram.

37
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,180
You are so pretentious and arrogant!

38
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,340
You're out of my company.

39
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,820
Oh, it came from there.

40
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm sorry sir. - What?

41
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,420
You were mad at me this morning, weren't you?

42
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,380
Yes.

43
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,420
I didn't react right away.

44
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,820
Certainly!

45
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,220
Because I had no reaction at all ..

46
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,020
..that emotion is in me and turns into anger.

47
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,460
And I hit other people.

48
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,620
So what?

49
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,860
Now I have no emotions.

50
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,660
No emotion. No enemies.

51
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,820
therefore..

52
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,820
You better let go of your emotions right away.

53
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,420
If we do not react to our anger or sadness ..

54
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,740
..that emotion will stay within and affect others.

55
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,940
And eventually we will be the ones who fail.

56
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,060
I have failed before.

57
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,620
I lost my job.

58
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,860
For those who failed like us..

59
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,300
I started this company.

60
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,140
The name of the company, is KMC.

61
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,660
I will only take 2 minutes to explain about this company.

62
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,140
That is my company.

63
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,900
If you all believe me ..

64
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,500
..please invest in this company.

65
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,980
What is the guarantee that this company will succeed?

66
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,260
Good question.

67
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,380
I will increase your bank balance 100 times in 2 minutes.

68
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,380
Then you will believe, right?

69
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,300
How?

70
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,220
Sudhir..

71
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,820
Sedia, Abhi..

72
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,140
This is the London stock market.

73
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,460
This is the value of the company's shares when the account is closed.

74
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,060
Next view ..

75
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,500
This is C-Gate Sottware Solutions.

76
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,860
My expectation is within 2 minutes after the market opens ..

77
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,780
..the stock of this company will go up 100 times.

78
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Listen to me.

79
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,740
And invest your money in this company.

80
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,020
That's your money ..

81
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,820
..will increase 100 times in two minutes.

82
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,500
- Believe me. - Are you crazy?

83
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,900
Over 52 weeks the company’s market is among the lowest.

84
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,780
How do you think the price will go up?

85
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
If I'm not mistaken ..

86
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,980
You are Kamal Shival, right?

87
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,740
Yes.

88
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,740
And your bank balance is only 1 pound.

89
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,940
Yes.

90
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,340
If you lose that 1 pound ..

91
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,300
..your life won't be a mess.

92
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,540
No.

93
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,460
But you will get the answer with only 1 pound.

94
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,860
1 pound you have ..

95
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,100
So invest in C-Gate Company.

96
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,660
Come on everyone. What are you waiting for?

97
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,860
You only have 2 minutes. Invest in C-Gate.

98
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,140
Lima..

99
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,340
Four..

100
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,660
Three..

101
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,660
Two..

102
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,500
One..

103
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,180
How?

104
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,140
But how?

105
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,220
This is not a question. But the excitement.

106
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,700
There should be no answer for him.

107
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,220
Since then..

108
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,380
No one questions success.

109
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,380
- You are right! - Yes!

110
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,020
Is everything ready?

111
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,260
Start start .. Start start ..

112
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,860
Don't stop until the game is over.

113
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,380
Live, live..

114
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,500
Don't stop until you swim.

115
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,380
Don't stop until luck knocks on your door.

116
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,420
Don't stop swimming until the ship can save you

117
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,260
Don't stop until you get enough.

118
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,860
Don't stop until you get enough.

119
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,140
Don't stop until you get enough.

120
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,860
Don't stop until you get enough.

121
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,980
If you have any doubts.

122
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,380
Ask and relieve your emotions.

123
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
How did C-Gate Company’s stock suddenly soar 100-fold?

124
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,860
- You know Raj Patel? - Know. The richest Indian in the UK.

125
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,980
He recently bought 40% of the shares of C-Gate Company.

126
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,460
Why does he have to buy it?

127
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,900
His secretary cum his girlfriend who forced him to sign.

128
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
Why did he ask for a signature?

129
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,540
Because I saved her son from an accident.

130
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,780
You are willing to take risks.

131
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,060
- It's just a graph. - Graphics? What is that?

132
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,140
This was taken while I was crossing the street.

133
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,980
There are no buses.

134
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,300
- This is a recording of the last bus. - There are no slaves.

135
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,180
That's why I put the 2 recordings together and made them graphics.

136
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,780
And this is the result.

137
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,860
You should save Raj Patel's son.

138
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,620
Why the secretary's son?

139
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,340
He would have asked for this matter under investigation if it was his son.

140
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,380
He would be quiet if it was his girlfriend's daughter.

141
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,060
Don't stop thinking that they have given up on you.

142
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,220
Because they don't know you're a marigold.

143
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,980
Don't stop thinking they've beaten you.

144
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,620
Because they don't know you're like running water.

145
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,140
Don't stop thinking that you have their support.

146
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,260
Because they don't know you are a seed that will grow tall.

147
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,900
Be a seed and grow into a tree.

148
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,180
Be the tide and the height of your waves.

149
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,420
Be the wind high in the sky.

150
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,260
Don't stop until you get enough.

151
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,900
Don't stop until you get enough.

152
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,860
You are like drops and raindrops.

153
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,980
So why do you block the rain with an umbrella when it comes down?

154
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,940
You're like a sunburn.

155
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,180
So why are you looking for shade when the sun shines on you.

156
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,100
You are like the sound of the wind.

157
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,060
So why do you close the window when the wind is blowing.

158
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,260
Live the way you like.

159
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,660
Why do you cry when trouble comes.

160
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,580
Go against the flow and stand proud.

161
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,900
Don't stop until you get enough.

162
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,620
Don't stop until you get enough.

163
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,740
Don't stop until you get enough.

164
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,300
Don't stop until you get enough.

165
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,700
Abhi

166
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,140
Abhi..

167
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,500
Red phone.

168
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,980
Father is sick. The situation is serious.

169
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,940
Abhi, lompat.

170
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,700
Dad. Emotions that follow me all the time ..

171
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,220
Jump Abhi. Jump.

172
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,860
Come on ..!

173
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,740
Come on, Abhi ..

174
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,300
I see a variety of emotions in a lot of people.

175
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,740
But face various emotions with a smile ..

176
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,620
I only saw it on my father.

177
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,940
I don't know what my father's face looks like without a smile.

178
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,820
Love. Mom has come. Mom wants to come.

179
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,460
Good kid..

180
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,940
Do not Cry.

181
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
What about dad?

182
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,140
-Hi Abhi. - Nothing.

183
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,500
3 days ago he played with Sweety.

184
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,740
Suddenly my father fainted.

185
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,780
We remember the usual stomach ache.

186
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,060
She was having trouble breathing, so we took her to the hospital.

187
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,060
He is Dr. Vijay Mithra.

188
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,620
My younger sibling.

189
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,500
Hi..

190
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,460
He had Pancreatic Adenocarconoma. Final stage.

191
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,100
In this situation, each organ will begin to fail to function.

192
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,020
Sorry if I say..

193
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,300
He may have only a month and a half to live.

194
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,020
More or less so.

195
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,820
That's why my brother thinks it's better for him to stay at home in the last days.

196
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,100
So brother took him back.

197
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,460
Everything happens like in the movie.

198
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,740
Where's dad?

199
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,980
Father..

200
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,220
Why is dad sad?

201
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,460
Dad should be the happiest person.

202
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,540
We all have good jobs..

203
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,460
I have a Range rover.

204
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,940
My father's second child has a house in Lister Square.

205
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,020
Dad's youngest son had just set up a pipeline company.

206
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,260
Mr. Subramanyam’s son has value in society.

207
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,260
Who is responsible for all this?

208
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,460
Because my father worked hard to raise us.

209
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,620
Maybe you need to work hard.

210
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,820
..but you all don't have the need to live hard.

211
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,420
What..

212
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,820
Did you buy a Range rover?

213
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,580
When you were little you always went to school with a Ferrari.

214
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,820
And you..

215
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,020
You bought a 4 -room house.

216
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,020
You always play hide and seek in a 24-room castle.

217
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,700
..and there are 40 workers trying to find the three of you.

218
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,180
To teach him to play chess, there were 10 teachers lined up waiting their turn.

219
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,340
You are not the poor son of Subramanyam.

220
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,940
You are the son of the richest businessman in the Indian community in the UK.

221
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,900
Ramesh Chandra Prasad..

222
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,500
Right..

223
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,820
Father's name is Ramesh Chandra Prasad.

224
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,380
My dream is that every Indian in England should have his own home.

225
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,620
So I plan to build a world -class city with all the amenities.

226
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,220
If you trust me, invest.

227
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,220
Every penny you spend I will guarantee.

228
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,380
Great India in Britain.

229
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,580
Thank you.

230
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,660
Thank you very much.

231
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,780
Then someone cheated on dad.

232
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,460
He made the father a liar in front of everyone.

233
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Great Indian construction company that builds ..

234
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,980
..buildings in the UK went bankrupt overnight.

235
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,820
Great India construction land was declared an Eco zone by the British government.

236
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,940
The person who always claps for dad..

237
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,180
..the same person had also driven father from there.

238
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,980
Dad, I'm hungry.

239
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,540
Ma'am, my child ..

240
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,500
Hungry.

241
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,700
Is there any bread?

242
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,900
- What is your name? - Subramanyam ..

243
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,580
- Where are you from? - India.

244
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,740
What is your job

245
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,020
I will do any work.

246
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,060
I remember when I was busy taking care of you all my life ..

247
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,300
..dad will forget the deception he did to you.

248
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
But..

249
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,100
She's still in pain here.

250
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,340
Only by cheating on him again can we get ourselves a father again.

251
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,980
Dad doesn't worry about dad's death.

252
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,180
Dad was worried that Dad would die without getting revenge on him.

253
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,980
Dad didn't want to die as a failed Subramanyam.

254
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,380
Dad wants to die as Ramesh Chandra Prasad.

255
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,140
Father..

256
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,460
Father. Father..

257
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,340
His name is Krishna Murthy.

258
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,940
Chairman of K-Group Company.

259
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,660
Is everything according to plan?

260
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,700
Ya, tuan.

261
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,940
I don't want construction to stop.

262
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,900
Make sure we get more of this stuff.

263
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,300
I want immediate delivery.

264
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,420
If not..

265
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,820
Who is that?

266
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,620
Krishna Murthy, sir. Mr. K, chairman of K-Group.

267
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,260
Will birds eat butterflies?

268
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,460
The bird's stomach was full of butterflies.

269
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,420
You know Kapil ..

270
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,740
A bird can stop a hurricane in America.

271
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
That's right.

272
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,980
That's the butterfly effect.

273
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,380
There's nothing wrong with birds eating butterflies.

274
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,900
And it's also not wrong if we save America.

275
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,460
Tell me, why do I need to hear all these stories now.

276
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,340
That's right. But remember this. We'll talk about this later.

277
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Natural oil and gas.

278
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,580
I have been looking for it for 7 years and spent 70 million in Europe.

279
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,580
You're lucky. You found it on your own land.

280
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,340
Do not worry. I didn't kill anyone.

281
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,300
I will just win.

282
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,500
Let's play a game.

283
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,180
Two balls.

284
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,460
One has gold, and the other has silver.

285
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,980
If you choose the gold one ..

286
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,700
..you will win.

287
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,780
My choice is this.

288
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,060
Why do I want to play this game.

289
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,460
Because if you win, I'll go.

290
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,180
My guess is right.

291
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,100
You are stupid.

292
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,700
You don't have the ability to manage this project.

293
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,500
I will give you 20%, leave this project to me.

294
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,180
Forgive me.

295
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,620
What is all this? If you take 80% then I have to be scared of you?

296
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,900
And I'm not afraid of you.

297
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,500
I want you to remember something.

298
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,580
What was that thing?

299
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,700
About the effect of butterflies or something ..

300
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,100
You are not afraid of me.

301
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,220
But you will be afraid of butterflies.

302
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,380
Branch-branch?

303
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,460
Adnani coal mine in Australia.

304
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,740
The project is worth millions of dollars.

305
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,620
- Why was it stopped - Golden Green Frog.

306
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,700
Because of the frog ..

307
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,780
Do you know why?

308
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,820
Because ...

309
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,140
The frog was only found in that place.

310
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,180
And because of the project, rare snakes will become extinct.

311
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,620
So the government canceled the project.

312
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,220
There are only stones here.

313
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,540
Not bad.

314
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,100
You are smart enough ..

315
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,260
..for fear.

316
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,100
Giri. Newspaper.

317
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,540
This is tomorrow's newspaper.

318
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,860
“The people’s gas project will be an eco zone” is written in Spanish

319
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,500
Eco..

320
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,500
And this is the newspaper the day before yesterday.

321
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,500
"The people's gas project license was revoked by the Spanish government."

322
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,060
And this is the next day's newspaper.

323
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,060
"Investors are asking for their money back. Kapil Sinha ran away with their money."

324
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,340
Why do I want my license revoked And why do I want to run away?

325
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,300
Why do I want to change my identity. Why?

326
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,060
Because ...

327
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,740
They found butterflies that are rarely found here.

328
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,820
It means..

329
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,580
A very rare species.

330
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,620
If this project is continued.

331
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,700
The butterfly is in danger.

332
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,980
If they die the project will be stopped.

333
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,420
A rare butterfly?

334
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,460
Hey! Krishna Murthy..

335
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,380
There are no flowers here either.

336
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,060
How can there be butterflies?

337
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
Speak up.

338
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,620
That is my butterfly.

339
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,340
My butterfly.

340
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,820
My butterfly effect.

341
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:27,980
The butterfly-me effect.

342
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,460
I have researched about Krishna Murthy.

343
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,780
I have prepared the case documents.

344
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,540
We will be able to make a claim in court.

345
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,940
Dad don't worry.

346
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,220
We will take care of him.

347
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,340
Dad, take a break.

348
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,820
You just said the same thing my brother said.

349
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,580
So..

350
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,540
..my brother and I cheated on you. Like Krishna Murthy did.

351
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,700
Why do you think we want to cheat on dad?

352
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,340
I lied because I wanted to make my father happy.

353
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,860
Dad doesn't need my brother's deception now.

354
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,660
He wants to see the fall of Krishna Murthy.

355
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,140
What happened 20 years ago because of dad’s naivety.

356
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,980
So we want to retaliate against Krishna Murthy?

357
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,140
So we want revenge on Krishna Murthy?

358
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
What is your opinion?

359
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,580
That's right brother.

360
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,220
I will also deceive my father in this matter.

361
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,700
This revenge thing is just nonsense.

362
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,780
You just set up a company. You better handle it.

363
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,740
Nothing is more important to me than my father.

364
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,220
Don't talk like you're the only one who cares about dad.

365
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,740
A tourist going to the Taj Mahal will definitely be excited ..

366
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,300
..but not for the guards who see the Taj Mahal every day.

367
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,540
You only come to visit dad once in a while.

368
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,460
Don’t suddenly get emotional and talk out of excitement.

369
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,500
Sorry. Take a good look.

370
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,180
- I am sorry. - Sorry what?

371
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,140
Why are you smiling?

372
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,420
I can't control my emotions just because my shirt is exposed to coffee.

373
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,940
My brother kept scolding him.

374
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,980
And dad carried the same emotions for 20 years.

375
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,700
Before Dad dies, we have to get rid of that emotion.

376
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,780
Dad's face should have smiled after his death.

377
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,660
So?

378
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,980
You want to face Krishna Murthy?

379
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,420
Do you know who Krishna Murthy is?

380
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,540
The richest and most ruthless businessman in the UK.

381
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,300
It takes 300 days just to get an appointment. What are you going to do in 30 days?

382
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,180
Yes. lanya impossible.

383
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,420
Dad is counting the days.

384
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,900
It's not dad who counts the days.

385
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,460
Krishna Murthy.

386
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,100
Every breath I take is the moment of the downfall of Krishna Murthy.

387
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,100
Abhi..

388
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,300
Go eat first.

389
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,140
Krishna Murthy doesn't have much time left sister.

390
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,580
I only have 30 days.

391
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,620
30 days means 720 hours.

392
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,660
720 hours means 43200 minutes.

393
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,100
43200 minutes equals 2592000 seconds.

394
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,500
Harta kekayaan Krishna Murthy bernilai 35000 kror.

395
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,140
Each moment is worth 10 crore.

396
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
Zero operation.

397
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,660
This is the name of my mission to deceive Krishna Murthy.

398
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,100
I need 3 people to make it happen.

399
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,500
Why?

400
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,260
Is it because I'm fast typing?

401
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,020
No.

402
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,420
I love your tattoos.

403
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,940
Between me and your father. You choose!

404
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,300
Let me ask dad first.

405
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,180
- Oh, sorry. - Who is this?

406
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,380
My father. Thank you.

407
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,900
What time did I tell you all to come?

408
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,220
What time is it now?

409
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,380
10.31 forest.

410
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,220
So, you're a minute late.

411
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,140
Can you come at exactly 10.32?

412
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,420
Ya, tuan.

413
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,500
Time is calculated in seconds and minutes.

414
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,500
But I counted it according to my father's heartbeat.

415
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,020
From now on, the time you waste is not your time ..

416
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,260
But my time.

417
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,620
I only have 30 days.

418
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,420
Do you know why I chose you all for this mission?

419
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,380
Because there is one common qualification between the three of you.

420
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,940
That is, the three of you love your father.

421
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,460
Additional qualifications.

422
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,380
You are all former employees of Krishna Murthy's company.

423
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,140
Krishna Murthy.

424
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,460
Is a smart and fast thinker in the business arena in London.

425
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,460
Is a smart and fast thinker in the business arena in London.

426
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,420
Is a smart and fast thinker in the business arena in London.

427
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,980
Can I dig oil and gas out of the ground?

428
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,260
I want a release document in 24 hours.

429
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,380
I need details on his thoughts.

430
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,220
What he ate and drank.

431
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,820
How many hours did he sleep? How many hours does he work?

432
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,580
What clothes she wears and what perfume she uses.

433
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,820
What brand of wine. What pen is he using.

434
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,980
Did he laugh hearing the jokes. Will he get angry when he gets wind.

435
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,860
Has he ever hit people.

436
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,140
I want all the details.

437
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,540
What I mean is..

438
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,260
Every detail in detail.

439
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,060
He eats broccoli for breakfast.

440
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,180
So what are we waiting for again?

441
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,820
Bring me broccoli.

442
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,500
Is he eating at this time?

443
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,900
No sir. 12.30 am..

444
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,460
So serve at 12.30 later.

445
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,020
To defeat Krishna Murthy we have to know his business strategy and secrets.

446
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,900
Why do we need what he eats and what he drinks?

447
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,700
Every girl wants a man who has qualities like her father.

448
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,100
Elektro kompleks.

449
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,620
So I want to change myself like Krishna Murthy.

450
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,900
What do you mean?

451
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,580
Our first goal...

452
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,220
Daughter of Krishna Murthy.

453
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,660
He is a 40% shareholder of the company.

454
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,300
The watch he's wearing is probably ...

455
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,420
..worth 10 crore.

456
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,900
His name.

457
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,980
Divyanka.

458
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,020
Coffee..

459
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,380
Coffee.

460
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,620
Double Shot Cappuccino.

461
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,820
How do you know?

462
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,220
How do you know I want to order Double Shot?

463
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,420
A girl who missed her first coffee ..

464
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,260
..would have a strong..coffee for both coffees.

465
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,860
How do you know I missed my first coffee?

466
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,940
Girl typing her coffee cup..

467
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,180
..must miss the coffee in the early morning.

468
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,380
Are you trying to screw the girl you met by chance?

469
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,300
This is not a coincidence?

470
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,940
I'm planning on having coffee with you, that's why you're sitting here.

471
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,100
Forgive me?

472
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,540
Where should you be now?

473
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,380
At the Art Gallery.

474
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,300
So why are you here?

475
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,460
Because I didn't drink coffee this morning.

476
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,860
How did you miss your coffee?

477
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,420
Because the coffee machine is broken.

478
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,220
Why is it broken?

479
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,620
There is no electricity supply.

480
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,140
Precisely.

481
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,300
I cut off the electricity.

482
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,460
Because there was no electricity for 5 minutes.

483
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,660
You left the house 10 minutes late.

484
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,660
Due to being 10 minutes late, you will pass the school zone.

485
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,460
I don't want to wait for you to turn left.

486
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,380
500 meters ahead.

487
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,860
You just notice the road is being repaired and you turn left.

488
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
On the way there were protesters (gatherings).

489
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,300
And you took the long way to the art gallery.

490
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,940
This is the first coffee shop on the route.

491
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,460
So you're sharing coffee with me now.

492
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,380
So that's the story of why you missed your morning coffee.

493
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,900
I will not believe.

494
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,980
it's just a coincidence.

495
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,980
As it happens.

496
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,500
There are so many tables in the store but why did you choose this table?

497
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,060
Because only this table is empty.

498
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,700
I arranged them.

499
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,900
Why do all this?

500
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,540
To publish love between us.

501
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,300
You do not understand?

502
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
Easy.

503
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,820
You are like carbon. And I am also a carbon.

504
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,580
And there is a free flow of electricity in you and me.

505
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,020
If they are combined.

506
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,900
There must be a magical moment created between the two of us.

507
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,180
And for that we have to meet many times by chance.

508
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,180
Since I don't have much time ..

509
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,260
I will plan all our meetings.

510
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,420
So until you fall in love with me, when and where will I meet you ..

511
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,900
..you will come and meet me by chance.

512
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,100
Okay.

513
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,340
Tomorrow try to see me ..

514
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,980
..and I will try not to run into you.

515
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,140
Hello. - Hi, Divya.

516
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,260
My car broke down. I am at home.

517
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,460
Please come pick me up.

518
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,860
- Please. - All right.

519
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,180
Thank you.

520
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,620
- I'm tired. - Shivani, whatever happens today.

521
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,060
Hey, stop. There are puppies there.

522
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,140
Cute puppy.

523
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,940
Hey, puppy. Really cute.

524
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,820
Sparky. Nice name.

525
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,660
Hey there. - Number 36.

526
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,980
Try checking. - Yes, that is correct.

527
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,660
Hey, Sparky!

528
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,820
Who is that?

529
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,180
You go. I'll come later.

530
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,620
What about this time? Uninterrupted electricity supply in the house.

531
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,380
This time it's not your house without electricity.

532
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,500
But at your friend's house.

533
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,140
Because his car can't be started.

534
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,980
He called you and told you to pick him up.

535
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,500
On the way you see a puppy.

536
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,180
Because your friend really likes puppies.

537
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,060
You two are trying to find the address.

538
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,900
So again you will share coffee with me.

539
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,740
What if my friend ..

540
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,340
..don't call me.

541
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,780
What if he took a taxi.

542
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,540
So..

543
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,100
We met by chance.

544
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,860
This is better.

545
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,540
Look here, Divya.

546
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,620
Your friend didn't call a taxi, so we could have coffee together.

547
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,900
Something that happens naturally.

548
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,700
Will determine a situation elsewhere.

549
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,060
Everything is related to each other.

550
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,220
For example.

551
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
The position of this coffee cup is placed on the table.

552
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,660
..and they just sit and chat.

553
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,180
And he took pictures.

554
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,860
By the time it happens, something is happening in a different way.

555
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,260
So..

556
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,100
It's like we sit here and drink coffee.

557
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,340
Maybe your father is sitting drinking coffee somewhere else.

558
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,700
And may lose all his belongings.

559
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,660
How?

560
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,380
Because he faces northeast.

561
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,100
If he moves his desk exactly 42 degrees to the east ..

562
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,700
His wealth must have doubled.

563
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,300
So you mean, because the position of this cup is like this ..

564
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,340
..can't we create love between us?

565
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,300
If the cup is like this ..

566
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,700
Just a second.

567
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,380
- You won't do that. Why?

568
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,220
Because you might kiss me.

569
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,180
What?

570
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,700
Why do you love me?

571
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,660
Duit.

572
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,940
Because of your money.

573
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,860
You are the daughter of a millionaire.

574
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,980
You have 40% of the company's shares.

575
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,820
Okay, you tell me.

576
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,740
As long as you have money.

577
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,180
Would you believe me if I told you another reason?

578
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,420
Certainly not.

579
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,860
Even though I really love you ..

580
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,740
..you might think I'm chasing your money.

581
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,940
That's why I give you reasons that you will believe.

582
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,020
You think selfishness will create a sense of love between us ..

583
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,340
What's his name?

584
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,660
Carbon material, electric, at magic.

585
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,500
Love has already begun.

586
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,580
When did it start?

587
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,300
The time you kissed me just now.

588
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,820
How can you say that.

589
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,140
I can read your thoughts.

590
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,060
Really?

591
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,460
Want to try?

592
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,500
Okey.

593
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,820
Big.

594
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,860
Hold out your hand.

595
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,580
Close your eyes.

596
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,100
Soothe your body, mind and soul.

597
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,260
Just calm down.

598
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,700
I can hear a sound.

599
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
Trolley. Beg.

600
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,180
Trolley. Beg.

601
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,020
There are a lot of people.

602
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,140
Announcement.

603
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,180
Very noisy sound.

604
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,500
lanya train.

605
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,220
No. No. Wait.

606
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,620
lanya plane.

607
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,220
Now, everything is very clear.

608
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,860
Airport.

609
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,180
Little girl.

610
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,820
She was crying.

611
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,540
Screaming called his mother.

612
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,780
Someone grabbed his hand and held it.

613
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,980
Shivani.

614
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,420
The young man is weird.

615
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,180
He told me about my dream.

616
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,260
Until now I never told my father about my dream.

617
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,340
Really? - Yes.

618
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,860
But the puppy is really cute.

619
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,460
Oh, God..! All this because of the puppy.

620
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,780
You know ... I smelled him.

621
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,540
Did you kiss him? What kind?

622
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,660
Suddenly a camera light flashed.

623
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,020
There is basketball. The waiter spilled coffee.

624
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,180
And I smelled him.

625
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,140
I do not understand.

626
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,380
Now..

627
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,260
Everything in this world is connected.

628
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,220
At the moment it happens in one place naturally ..

629
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,420
..will determine another moment elsewhere.

630
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,660
For example.

631
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,660
When I change the direction of my coffee cup ..

632
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,060
- Sorry, ma'am. - It's fine. It's ok.

633
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,260
Sorry, ma'am.

634
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,620
Sorry.

635
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,100
What happened Divya.

636
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,500
Nothing. Just a second.

637
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,300
Try to avoid seeing me tomorrow.

638
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,420
If we meet, it means we are in love.

639
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,900
He's a message.

640
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,420
He said that if we meet tomorrow by chance it means love.

641
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,180
Now what kind?

642
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,500
He doesn't know if I've read his message or not.

643
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,860
Because my phone doesn't have a "blue tick"

644
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,460
Yes, okay. Just a second.

645
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,420
Now you stand in front of the mirror.

646
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,980
And look at your birthmark on your left waist.

647
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,140
No. You are wrong.

648
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,900
Yes, speak up.

649
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,820
What? Okay. Okay. Just a second.

650
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,980
The girl who replied to the second message must have read the first message.

651
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,060
Shivani, bye.

652
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,220
Try to avoid meeting tomorrow.

653
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,660
If we meet, it means we are in love.

654
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,020
Stop at a coffee shop.

655
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,780
Okey.

656
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,860
No. No. Not the first store. But the second.

657
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,300
Thank you. - Thank you.

658
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,340
How?

659
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,740
Easy.

660
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,580
I'm just following you.

661
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,220
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

662
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,140
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

663
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,420
Oh beautiful girl.

664
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,140
Wherever you go, it's because of me ..

665
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,580
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

666
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,940
Oh sweet, naughty girl.

667
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,100
Your address is in my heart. I can say for sure.

668
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,900
Your address is in my heart. I can say for sure.

669
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,420
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

670
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:16,500
Like a signal following a cell phone, I always follow you.

671
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,460
Yesterday, today and tomorrow.

672
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:30,060
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

673
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:36,580
Oh beautiful girl.

674
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,220
Wherever you go, it's because of me ..

675
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,620
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

676
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,660
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

677
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,580
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

678
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,100
Party here. The party is here.

679
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,300
Dance.

680
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,300
Party here. The party is here.

681
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,420
When you go to the coffee shop, I'm the cup there.

682
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,580
When he touches your lips, I am his insert.

683
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,420
When your heart beats, I'm the beat.

684
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:21,420
If you go and shake your waist, I'll be your friend.

685
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,020
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

686
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:37,060
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

687
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,500
I want your tail. I want to follow you.

688
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:02,300
Like a cat drinking milk with its eyes closed.

689
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,860
Don't think I didn't see you, girl.

690
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:11,980
Remind yourself like an arrow, don't get so excited.

691
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,540
The one who released you from the bow was me.

692
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,700
Nothing can take you out of my sight.

693
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Not Krishna, Jesus or God.

694
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,700
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

695
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:44,540
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

696
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,700
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.

697
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,460
So you love me.

698
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:56,980
I told you ..

699
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,860
If we meet the third time there must be love.

700
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,060
Do you know what this is?

701
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,740
Carlos Ross and his famous butterfly painting.

702
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,460
lanya cantik.

703
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,500
My father really liked this painting.

704
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,540
After 20 years it will be auctioned.

705
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,020
I really like my dad.

706
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,220
I want to give him this painting as a gift and give him a surprise.

707
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,140
But because of you ..

708
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,700
Three times I missed going to the gallery.

709
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,820
And the painting is gone.

710
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,460
The auction is over.

711
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,380
So thank you so much for you.

712
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,780
I missed the painting.

713
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,180
So, I was so intrigued that you missed the painting.

714
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,260
Do you know what caught my eye the most?

715
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,860
Maybe you're a witch.

716
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,180
You can probably read my mind, can predict my future.

717
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,460
We only get excited when magicians do all this.

718
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,740
But will not fall in love.

719
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,860
Love cannot exist by planning it.

720
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,500
If we are destined to meet, no one can stop it.

721
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,860
In fact, nature will also help bring us closer.

722
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,020
Air, sky ..

723
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,060
..that tree, that puppy.

724
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,300
Everything.

725
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,260
So, bye.

726
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,580
All of you.

727
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,580
I need the painting right away.

728
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,980
- Go find it. - Yes, boss. Okay.

729
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,020
Krishna Murthy has hired an advocate.

730
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,740
Answers for the defense have also been made.

731
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,340
The case will be heard soon.

732
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,980
We've gathered all the evidence.

733
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,900
I'm sure we will win.

734
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,980
Dad has a friend named Satpal Singh.

735
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,780
He does the land business.

736
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,340
See if he can help in this case.

737
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,620
I'll see him dad.

738
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,380
Don't cry, baby.

739
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,940
- What kind of father? Brother, tell me well.

740
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,700
If dad makes only 10% of what brother told me..

741
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,940
..I can imagine an old story.

742
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,980
He did not tell Subramanyam.

743
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,460
But he told Ramesh Chandra Prasad.

744
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,380
If you knew we cheated on him ..

745
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,060
..of course he feels worse than what Krishna Murthy has done to him.

746
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,220
Yes, that is correct.

747
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,700
Brother is just telling a story. So you tell me what you should do.

748
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,140
You said you wanted to deal with Krishna Murthy.

749
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,460
But you can't even manage his own child.

750
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,020
What are you going to do with Krishna Murthy?

751
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,180
So talk when you've done something.

752
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,060
Then my brother will stop telling my father.

753
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,100
Neelima ..! Serve the food to Abhi.

754
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,860
He has a lot of free time.

755
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,460
Come on, dad, tell me a story. Once upon a time, there was a man named Abhi ..

756
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,180
I think you're right, brother. Look, Sweety isn't crying anymore.

757
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,460
Boss, the painting is here.

758
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,540
Nice. It looks like an original painting.

759
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,060
How does the boss know this is a fake carving?

760
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,260
- Doesn't look like a scratch on this wing? - We saw the boss.

761
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,940
- What color? - Cobalt blue.

762
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,300
Two hundred years ago there was no cobalt blue.

763
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,900
It only appeared after that.

764
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,420
And this painting is 200 years old.

765
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,300
So this may not be an original painting.

766
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,700
No one else can guess this is not an original painting other than the boss.

767
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,500
Okay, let's just share this one, boss.

768
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,260
Does it matter if it is genuine or fake when we actually want to deceive them?

769
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,060
I have no plans to deceive Divyanka.

770
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,140
Only his father..

771
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,980
If I give him this painting ..

772
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,940
..she will give it to her father.

773
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,180
And it was as if Divya was cheating on her father.

774
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,060
And I don't like it.

775
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,020
We can find out who bought the painting.

776
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,780
But he asked for 25 crore.

777
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,460
Whatever the cost, I want an original painting.

778
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,420
- Hello. - Divya..

779
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,620
I have the painting you want.

780
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,180
For the past few days you remember ..

781
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,020
..you missed this painting for meeting me.

782
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,940
But now, if you don't find me, you'll miss it.

783
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,060
I'm waiting for you at my place.

784
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,460
Dengan Cappucino "Double Shot"

785
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,300
See you later.

786
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,780
Nice try.

787
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,500
Encik Abhiram.

788
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,380
Once you do it may look interesting.

789
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,380
When you do it again, it looks shocking.

790
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,020
The third time you made it look like a fool.

791
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,660
Where are you now?

792
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,660
You know where I'm going if you've planned it.

793
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,860
I know you're in the car in the back.

794
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,660
Divya..

795
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,140
Divya..

796
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,380
Someone is trying to kidnap Divya.

797
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,940
Let go! Let go..

798
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,980
He kidnapped Divya using a plan we made.

799
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,300
So..

800
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,460
If they imitate our plan, that means ..

801
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,660
..they will probably go to the coffee shop first.

802
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,220
Coffee shop 1

803
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,340
Here we put 30 people.

804
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,740
Surely he was one of them.

805
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,460
Coffee shop 2.

806
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,020
Here, one of the 30 earlier...

807
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,700
..he is there.

808
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,140
He pretends to take a wedding, but he takes a picture of Divya.

809
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,020
Why is he trying to trap Divya, boss?

810
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,020
Did he kidnap Divya for money?

811
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,260
It's too big for him.

812
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,900
Something small.

813
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,020
Got it.

814
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,380
When he came to the coffee shop 2 ..

815
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,980
He didn't take a picture of Divyanka, but a picture of his watch.

816
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,860
I told you, it costs 10 crore.

817
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,980
If he wants a watch ..

818
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,780
..he will take his watch and leave Divya.

819
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,460
But they brought Divya once.

820
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,100
I think they will rape her.

821
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,580
So we have to find where they will take Divya, boss.

822
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,780
If we want to know ..

823
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,820
..we got to the place where Divya was kidnapped.

824
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,340
You know where I'm going if you've planned it.

825
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,860
Divya's place of abduction is between coffee shop 1 and coffee shop 2.

826
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,780
Because he got into the school zone.

827
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,540
Definitely at the coffee shop 1.

828
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,460
Where is the place where there is no CCTV on the route?

829
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,860
- On the bridge. - Good. We start from there.

830
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,460
To the left of the surveillance camera. Security checks.

831
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,380
On the right there is only a bus route, normal vehicles cannot pass.

832
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,660
The right road is closed.

833
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,700
They must have turned left.

834
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,780
The sound of an ambulance.

835
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,260
The kidnapper may be speeding.

836
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,660
..so there is a possibility of an accident.

837
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,100
-Kate?-Ya, tuan.

838
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,820
Impact if there is any accident at a nearby location.

839
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,460
How about you? What happen?

840
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,940
A car hit him.

841
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,580
is it black? - Yes black car. He went that way.

842
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,500
Take care of him.

843
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,100
The impression of the water heading west.

844
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,220
The mouth of the bottle may have been rotated 55-degrees to the south.

845
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,580
So, they must be heading north.

846
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,620
We got the watch and the girl.

847
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,940
Good. Careful.

848
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,780
Bring him.

849
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:32,940
Kate..

850
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,820
lanya personal number. I need another number.

851
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,620
Kate, try to trace the number. - Sir, I tried, I'm so sorry.

852
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,300
- What? - I got the signal.

853
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,220
- Call me. - I can connect it, boss.

854
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,820
Connect me on the phone.

855
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,700
- Just do it. - Lanya rang the boss.

856
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,220
Hello? - Hello Abhi..

857
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,380
Divya..

858
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,660
Divya, can you hear me?

859
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,300
Divya..

860
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,180
Divya, can you hear my voice?

861
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,060
Divya, where are you?

862
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,380
- There are a lot of cars here, Abhi. - I haven't heard Divya.

863
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,580
Lots of cars ..

864
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,860
Give me a clue. A little hint, please.

865
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,220
Divya, just give me one hint.

866
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,620
Chur, Churchill Street - What?

867
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,060
What? Divya, speak up.

868
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,980
Divya..

869
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,500
Churchill Street.

870
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,940
He's mine.

871
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,340
Are you okay

872
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,180
Divya, stop.

873
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,700
Turn the shoe 45 degrees.

874
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,780
Counter clockwise.

875
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,100
Abhi..

876
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,780
Divya, don't. I will tell you everything.

877
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,100
There is a lot to discuss.

878
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,180
Divya, don't be afraid.

879
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:48,140
Suddenly a car came. He almost hit the boy.

880
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,820
I saved the boy. The car hit me.

881
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:55,740
I fell. But when I open my eyes and I see ..

882
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,500
I saw your shoes.

883
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,260
That little dog..

884
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,580
Bite that shoe and run.

885
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,700
I chased behind him.

886
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,940
That dog told me where you were.

887
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,220
You are right Divya. I understand now.

888
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,620
This is not a plan but a destiny, Divya.

889
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,260
Nature helps us.

890
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,420
Rain.

891
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,300
The wind, the baby and the dog...

892
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,020
I don't have to plan to see you.

893
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,580
Because I love you.

894
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,980
Listen. Listen ..

895
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,540
Look into my eyes, feel my heart.

896
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,900
He will tell you something that words cannot express.

897
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,740
Hold my hand, don't let go.

898
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,180
I want to hear that you will live for me.

899
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,580
My heart to you..

900
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,140
And your heart is on me.

901
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:57,820
Caught with each other.

902
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,140
My heart to you.

903
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,820
And your heart is on me.

904
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,340
Stick to each other as if in an arrow.

905
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,100
Don't you leave me dear.

906
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,180
You are destined to love me.

907
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:17,100
You need to trust me. I'm the only one for you.

908
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,660
I give half of myself to you.

909
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,620
I remember you day and night.

910
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,700
My heart to you.

911
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,260
And your heart is on me.

912
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:37,100
Caught with each other.

913
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,220
My heart to you.

914
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,460
And your heart is on me.

915
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,180
Stick to each other as if in an arrow.

916
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,140
Look into my eyes, feel my heart.

917
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,780
He will tell you something that words cannot express.

918
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,540
Hold my hand, don't let go.

919
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,020
I want to hear that you will live for me.

920
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:28,300
When snow touches us with its cold. We warm up with a kiss.

921
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:37,460
When I'm in your arms We can't stop making mistakes.

922
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,820
Don't you want to be my darling forever?

923
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,860
Our eyes are opposite and opposite to each other.

924
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,340
My heart to you.

925
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,580
And your heart is on me.

926
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:57,380
Caught with each other.

927
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,660
My heart to you.

928
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,860
And your heart is on me.

929
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:07,260
Stick to each other as if in an arrow.

930
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,060
You have me to set me free.

931
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,420
Proceed. I feel like it keeps moving.

932
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,620
You don't know what I feel the way you do.

933
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,060
You decide. This game is getting more and more interesting.

934
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,980
- Hey dad. - Hi darling.

935
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,260
- How are you? - I'm okay now.

936
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,460
Still in pain?

937
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,020
- How do you feel? - Feel better.

938
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,300
Come on, sit down.

939
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,460
- Sit down. - Thank you.

940
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,060
They have been subjected to action.

941
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,660
They won't come back.

942
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,740
No one can hurt you anymore.

943
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:42,020
After all, it was an eventful day.

944
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,060
Yes, really bad.

945
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,220
I know.

946
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,740
Are you stressed? Why?

947
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,420
Dad didn't drink coffee this morning, did he?

948
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,100
How do you know?

949
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,220
Because depressed people often miss their morning coffee.

950
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,380
What happen?

951
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:56,900
Nothing, ma'am.

952
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,660
It's just an oil and natural gas project that we want to start in Spain.

953
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,740
..didn't get a NOC certificate.

954
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,900
The Spanish government is very firm.

955
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,060
If we don’t have it, investors will pull away.

956
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,300
The value of the stock will plummet.

957
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,860
If we get the NOC in a month.

958
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,820
Your father will be the richest entrepreneur in the UK in ...

959
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,820
..oil and natural gas as well as being listed in Forbes.

960
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,940
Because he faces northeast.

961
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,540
If he faces 42 degrees to the east ..

962
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,660
..it's likely that his wealth will be doubled.

963
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,420
I understand.

964
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,020
Father..

965
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,820
This arrangement of my father's office has caused negative things to happen.

966
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,540
But if it is arranged in a different way ..

967
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,020
Positive things will happen.

968
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,860
- I can't believe any of that. - Father..

969
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,740
Take this seriously.

970
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,380
If not in a few days dad will lose all the money.

971
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,780
JD, where is 42 degrees north?

972
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:36,660
JD, where is 42 degrees north?

973
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,060
Divya.

974
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,980
You're starting to believe this kind of nonsense.

975
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,260
Are you in love? - Dad?

976
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,500
Actually, yes.

977
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,340
The same guy.

978
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,100
- Who saved you? - Yes.

979
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,620
He's like a father.

980
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:03,260
Smart, handsome, smart.

981
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,420
Dad invited him to Dad's birthday party.

982
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,100
Dad, meet him. 10 minutes only.

983
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,940
Sorry baby. Dad was in Paris at the time.

984
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:11,900
- No. - I'm sorry, sir.

985
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:15,060
I just got an email. Prince Morroco is coming to London.

986
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,900
To meet you on your birthday.

987
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,300
Five minutes?

988
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,740
- Okay. It's only 5 minutes. - Thank you.

989
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,140
Thank you. Okay, I'll see you later.

990
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,820
- Bye. - Bye-bye

991
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,940
And dad, please don't change the position of this table.

992
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,460
Okay. Thank you.

993
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,580
- Hey! Change that table. - Sir. Miracle sir.

994
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,620
I got a confirmation call from the Spanish minister.

995
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,260
We got the NOC, sir.

996
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,300
Don't switch tables.

997
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,620
Dad, our case will be heard.

998
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,380
Today Krishna Murthy is going to court.

999
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,860
I will interrogate him.

1000
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,380
I will meet Krishna Murthy for the first time.

1001
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,780
We will definitely win this case.

1002
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,420
I'll be back, dad

1003
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:53,820
Where are you going?

1004
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,260
To make my brother's deception a reality.

1005
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:55,940
What?

1006
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,620
I want to meet Krishna Murthy.

1007
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,740
Hey! Abhi..

1008
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,820
Hey, Sweety has stopped crying. Maybe he's right.

1009
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,580
Irate Paki Cricket supporters injure Indian workers.

1010
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,700
What's this boss? The boss has an important meeting with Krishna Murthy.

1011
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,180
Is it important to do all this?

1012
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,460
Nothing.

1013
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,020
When I remember Krishna Murthy's deception against my father ..

1014
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,380
Maybe I'll kill him if I see him.

1015
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,460
That's why I want to let go of that emotion here.

1016
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,900
Now, I'm calm.

1017
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:28,380
- Let's go see Krishna Murthy. - Okay, boss.

1018
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,980
There is a man who has deceived my father.

1019
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:21,540
He made the father of a liar in front of everyone.

1020
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,900
Abhi..

1021
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,420
Hold on, you come by yourself.

1022
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,100
Hey! Thanks for this painting.

1023
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,860
Beautiful clothes.

1024
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,660
You look charming.

1025
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,860
Be careful when talking to dad. He's smarter than you.

1026
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,180
Just a second.

1027
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,060
Good luck for next year.

1028
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,780
Forgive me.

1029
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,060
Ayah. Abhi..

1030
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:02,900
Forgive me, sir. - Yes.

1031
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,780
Prince Morroco will arrive in another 10 minutes.

1032
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,100
Dad, give me 5 minutes.

1033
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,860
Beautiful.

1034
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,220
Do you like butterflies?

1035
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,500
You also like butterflies.

1036
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,700
I really love my son.

1037
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,020
I also really love your son.

1038
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,420
You may be smart.

1039
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,140
But that was before you entered this room.

1040
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,820
Not after you came in. - Exactly.

1041
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,020
I want you to think I'm a normal guy

1042
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,420
Just kidding.

1043
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,540
Gula?

1044
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,220
2 cubes.

1045
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,340
If you're smart enough ..

1046
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:07,300
You won't waste 2 minutes of the 5 minutes I gave you.

1047
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:08,900
If you're really smart.

1048
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,940
You will not determine your child's life in just 5 minutes.

1049
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,420
Mr. Krishna Murthy Kautilya.

1050
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,220
Krishna Murthy Kautilya.

1051
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,060
Remember that name.

1052
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,620
We will discuss later.

1053
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,460
Time to play.

1054
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,140
And this game.

1055
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,740
Will determine if you will be in my son's life or not.

1056
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,420
I have never lost in this game.

1057
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,740
And I never played a game that I would lose.

1058
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,820
I will play to win.

1059
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,340
I would play if I knew I would win.

1060
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,260
Okey.

1061
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,740
On these two balls.

1062
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,620
One has gold, and the other has silver.

1063
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,820
Select one.

1064
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,460
If you choose the color gold ..

1065
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,900
My child is yours.

1066
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,340
This is my choice.

1067
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,300
Give your telethon a second.

1068
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,380
Do you know why you always do this game?

1069
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,260
You divide everyone into 3 categories.

1070
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,460
That doesn't make sense.

1071
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,820
Clever people.

1072
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:49,340
A very wise person.

1073
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,860
Same like me.

1074
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,060
First. Foolish people.

1075
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,180
Because you pushed this ball forward.

1076
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,780
He will choose the ball because he remembers it is a golden ball.

1077
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,460
But the gold in this ball...

1078
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,020
And he will lose.

1079
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,620
Clever people.

1080
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,700
Because you pushed this ball forward ..

1081
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:13,260
You want him to know there's gold in this ball.

1082
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,140
He will definitely pick this ball.

1083
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,260
But the gold is in the ball.

1084
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,020
And he will lose.

1085
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,140
The last. A very wise person.

1086
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,820
Because you pushed this ball forward.

1087
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,420
Then he will remember there is gold. on another ball because you guessed ..

1088
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,020
..he will pick this ball. And he thought ..

1089
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,580
..he will take another ball.

1090
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:34,980
Gold is in this ball.

1091
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,140
He will still lose.

1092
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,700
The moment you push this ball forward

1093
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,460
You proved me. a very wise person.

1094
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,580
But you know how I think.

1095
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,580
I would think like a smarter person than me.

1096
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,580
It means..

1097
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,540
Wiser than a very wise person ..

1098
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,460
My choice is this ball.

1099
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,140
Gold.

1100
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,660
It means..

1101
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:13,300
I think that determines who I will exist in your son's life.

1102
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,860
This is my logical explanation and I know you won't understand.

1103
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,180
That's why I recorded it.

1104
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,740
Watch when you're free.

1105
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,060
Okay.

1106
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,180
I excuse myself first.

1107
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,460
Thank you for this coffee.

1108
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,780
I ask you to remind me. Is he huh?

1109
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:47,340
Krishna Murthy Kautilya.

1110
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,700
There was only one man who called me by that name.

1111
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,860
Ramesh Chandra Prasad or known as Subramanyam.

1112
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,100
Your father.

1113
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,260
How is she

1114
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,740
I remember my enemies more than my friends.

1115
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:06,580
After a few years you came for revenge, that means ..

1116
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,820
..you have a strong motive.

1117
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,860
In three meetings, you've trapped my son.

1118
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,900
You must not have much time.

1119
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,060
Probably ..

1120
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,020
It was your father's last request.

1121
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,380
Is he lying in bed?

1122
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,340
How long will he live?

1123
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,780
6 months?

1124
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,100
3 months?

1125
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,820
A month?

1126
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,540
It must only be a month.

1127
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,500
What did your father tell you?

1128
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,300
Did he tell me he cheated or he was cheated?

1129
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:40,300
As far as I know in this world there is no deception ..

1130
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,980
Dealing with smart people is called fraud.

1131
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,340
It's flying.

1132
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:54,260
I'm just dealing with your dad.

1133
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,740
You remember it was a scam and you wanted revenge.

1134
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,580
I don't know what you're all thinking.

1135
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,580
When someone succeeds they say he is a criminal.

1136
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,860
I don't know about anyone else.

1137
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:08,140
I'm not a criminal.

1138
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,060
I'm just in business.

1139
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,940
Indeed I cheated and I succeeded.

1140
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,820
We should enjoy it too.

1141
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,420
It is not easy to cheat.

1142
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,220
You need different genes.

1143
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,860
For example you.

1144
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,940
You came to deceive my son.

1145
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,780
But what happened was that you fell in love.

1146
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,540
Butterflies 25 kror. Beautiful.

1147
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,820
You gave a very expensive gift, that means ..

1148
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,300
..you plan to deceive me and make my son bait.

1149
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,180
This is my bank account balance.

1150
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,140
35,000 kr.

1151
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,180
Income for 30 years.

1152
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,460
In 30 days.

1153
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,260
You will make it empty.

1154
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,140
- Dungu. - I'm sorry sir.

1155
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,860
I just got the information. Prince Morroco has arrived.

1156
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,580
Your time is up.

1157
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,140
People are willing to wait a year to see me for 2 minutes.

1158
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,220
But I gave you 5 minutes.

1159
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:18,540
You go and tell me that you can meet Krishna Murthy for 5 minutes.

1160
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,740
Berambus.

1161
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,180
Guards.

1162
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:24,540
- Get him out. - Wait for a while.

1163
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:29,020
Sir, where is your birthday supposed to be celebrated?

1164
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,380
From Paris.

1165
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,180
Why did you celebrate it in London?

1166
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,620
To meet Prince Morroco.

1167
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,940
Aeed Milad Sheik.

1168
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:45,340
Happy Birthday.

1169
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:45,340
I speak in Moroccan.

1170
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,820
I am the Prince of Morocco you have been waiting for.

1171
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,260
So..

1172
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,260
I didn't come because you wanted to see me.

1173
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:55,300
I want to see you, that's why you're here.

1174
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,860
And I still have 1 hour left.

1175
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,460
Actually, I don't need to see you.

1176
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,020
You know why I want to see you.

1177
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,540
I want to see how you are before you die.

1178
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,020
Otherwise it's hard to recognize you after that.

1179
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,740
Your birthday present.

1180
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,860
This is the November 1st newspaper.

1181
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,700
"Krishna Murthy's empire is collapsing!"

1182
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,580
"Krishna Murthy muflis."

1183
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,380
This is the news of the next day.

1184
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,060
"Krishna Murthy escaped."

1185
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,260
Here's the news the next day "Krishna Murthy changed his identity."

1186
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,220
Exactly in a month.

1187
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:32,860
That means ..

1188
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,020
Nov. 1, 6 p.m.

1189
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,780
You will only have this 1 pound.

1190
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,300
One more..

1191
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,540
There are still 58 minutes left.

1192
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,460
You probably won't have any more free time.

1193
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,700
Make a plan to run away from me.

1194
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,700
Sir. Do you want to take a break?

1195
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,860
No.

1196
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,220
35000 kr.

1197
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:09,220
To your surprise, it might have added another 3 billion.

1198
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,220
What do we want to do now?

1199
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,660
Easy.

1200
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:14,460
Hack his account.

1201
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,220
Is the boss kidding?

1202
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,780
To hack it, we need an account number.

1203
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,340
..passwords, IBan codes BIC codes and more.

1204
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:23,740
Kate.

1205
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,700
Write down the details. - All right, boss.

1206
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,900
Bank UDS.

1207
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,380
Account number 234, no, no.

1208
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,940
80081234

1209
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,420
Spell Code - 235386

1210
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:59,540
Kod IBan - CH37 RFXL 376349

1211
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:02,060
Kod BIC - RJSPCH 2M

1212
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,340
- Yes, great boss. - Great.

1213
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,300
This is enough to hack his account.

1214
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,420
Yes, boss. This is enough.

1215
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:10,020
We can hack his account.

1216
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,380
There is a small problem, to hack his account we need to have an account in the bank.

1217
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,100
But to open an account there you need 2 kror.

1218
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,780
And we don't have a pound.

1219
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:29,340
You've invested all the money we have on the painting.

1220
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,580
Wasting gave the painting to Krishna Murthy.

1221
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,580
He has no taste.

1222
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,140
He doesn't know the true beauty of the painting.

1223
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,980
..can be seen if exposed to sunlight.

1224
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,340
For him, it is enough to give him an imitation painting.

1225
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:42,540
We don't need to waste money.

1226
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,660
- JD. - Sir.

1227
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:49,380
Hang the painting there.

1228
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,140
Now is the time to rest.

1229
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,820
Hello, sir. - Bill for Mr. Ramesh Chandra Prasad.

1230
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,540
The report, sir. 10,000 pounds.

1231
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,740
I'm sorry, sir. Your card has been declined.

1232
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:49,420
What?

1233
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,340
Can you try again? - Okay.

1234
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:58,220
No. Can not. I am sorry. Your card has been declined.

1235
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,340
How much did you put into the account?

1236
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,620
I do not know.

1237
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:12,100
Abang.

1238
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,540
He bought a painting.

1239
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,500
Did you buy a painting?

1240
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:28,020
You bought 24 kror and bought a painting for Krishna Murthy's son.

1241
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,980
Brother, don't be depressed. I'll take care of the money.

1242
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:39,020
That's not your money alone. That's money from the three of us.

1243
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,940
He used to trick us, and we lived on the streets.

1244
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:44,500
Now we will live on the streets because we want to deceive him.

1245
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,180
There is no difference. Now we have to start again by begging.

1246
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,700
There's no point in telling you all this.

1247
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:53,460
That's wrong dad. He can die peacefully, but he wants revenge.

1248
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,300
He should have got a clearer picture.

1249
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,180
Brother? - Yes!

1250
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:58,020
- Brother will explain to him. - Brother ..

1251
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,780
Brother, don't do that. Abang ..

1252
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:10,980
I lied to my father.

1253
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,100
I tricked dad about everything.

1254
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,500
About filing a case against Krishna Murthy in court, it is all a hoax.

1255
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,620
I told my father all that so that he would be happy.

1256
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,260
He is not the Krishna Murthy that my father thought.

1257
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,420
He's in power and we can't touch him.

1258
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,340
This is reality, please try to understand.

1259
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:29,900
Because my father wanted revenge, he bought a painting worth 24 kror for the girl.

1260
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,500
We are doomed.

1261
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,260
Dad raised us with difficulty.

1262
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,980
But father destroyed us.

1263
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,140
This is not right, father.

1264
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,900
It doesn't matter if I've been to school riding a Ferrari.

1265
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,820
The range rover I bought with my efforts was more important.

1266
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,580
Dad, I also have a family.

1267
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,540
I also have to take care of them.

1268
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,140
Call my brother when my father is gone.

1269
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,780
Abang will complete the last uparaca.

1270
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,780
Because of the older son's brother.

1271
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:17,900
Sorry dad.

1272
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:22,180
How much have you replied to Krishna Murthy?

1273
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:26,620
Satpal Singh told my father everything.

1274
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:29,060
Dad heard you found him.

1275
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:45,020
Tell me how long you should live.

1276
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,100
Dad will try to keep breathing and living.

1277
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:55,540
I did not want to die until I saw the fall of Krishna Murthy.

1278
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,820
You go.

1279
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,300
Abhi..

1280
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,700
What about Divya?

1281
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,660
Father's grudge is true..

1282
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:15,940
That's why I found my love.

1283
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,540
That's the main framework. Connect it.

1284
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:07,620
Kate.. - Bos.

1285
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:08,900
Do you accept? - Yes.

1286
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,340
Infectious. Data launched. Access successful.

1287
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,260
Accept. - Accept..

1288
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,820
Kate, we only have 5 minutes.

1289
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:17,420
- Otherwise the system will 'reboot'. - Reception is complete.

1290
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,900
Reception complete.

1291
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,420
Waiting for the password, Kate.

1292
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,220
Hurry up, we don't have time. - Good boss. Is looking for.

1293
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,620
Password accepted. A password is provided.

1294
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,460
Trace it. - Tracking him.

1295
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,420
Oops, I can't access the password.

1296
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,340
Why Kate? Do something.

1297
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,180
Access denied.

1298
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,300
What is it, Kate?

1299
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,380
I like your confidence.

1300
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,460
So your plan is to hack my account and steal my money.

1301
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:48,860
Proceed.

1302
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,780
I like the confidence you have in me.

1303
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:54,620
That's why you're depressed because I've come here

1304
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,420
That's right.

1305
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,820
Remember, we will discuss it later.

1306
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:01,380
JD..

1307
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,820
Don't stop them if they want to come to our office.

1308
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,260
Let them try.

1309
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,580
This is my access card.

1310
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,700
With it you can enter any room, anytime in my office.

1311
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:15,380
No need to bother to get into my office.

1312
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:20,900
Let me show you something.

1313
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,940
This is a connection device via satellite.

1314
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,540
It can be connected to any server.

1315
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:33,420
Each time you log into my account, it will create a new password.

1316
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,380
And the password is only for 30 seconds.

1317
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,060
Want to hack this device ..

1318
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:42,060
Impossible.

1319
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,020
I told you to remember something.

1320
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,660
I came here feeling depressed.

1321
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,420
I didn't come here because of you.

1322
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,260
But for my daughter.

1323
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,820
Each girl will go through 2 phases.

1324
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,540
Before falling in love, and after falling in love.

1325
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:04,220
Before falling in love, father was his hero.

1326
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,700
After falling in love his father was a villain.

1327
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,220
And me too ..

1328
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:10,060
Not blessing your love.

1329
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:13,100
But don't you think he needs to know why I disagree?

1330
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,420
That's why I brought him along.

1331
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,180
Divya .. - Want to play a game?

1332
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,900
Next time, don't ask anyone to play this game.

1333
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,740
You will understand if you play it yourself.

1334
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,220
Select one.

1335
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,140
If you choose the right, you will be a hero in your child's life.

1336
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,660
Otherwise, you will be a criminal forever.

1337
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,140
This is my choice.

1338
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:46,620
Play it.

1339
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:51,060
- Giri. - Sir.

1340
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,620
Choose this.

1341
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:58,820
Silver sir.

1342
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,540
You lose.

1343
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:25,260
I'm at the club. Bring two tshirts. Important.

1344
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,260
One for you. And one for me.

1345
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:31,060
- It's time for you to stop. - I want more.

1346
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:32,700
That's enough Divya. - Thank you.

1347
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,100
Boss, tshirt for the boss.

1348
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,340
- You brought a tshirt for you. - I don't need it, boss.

1349
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,300
Seriously, you have to stop.

1350
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,620
Everything will be okay. Divya, please.

1351
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,460
Forgive me.

1352
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,180
To the edge.

1353
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,740
Divya, I'm sorry.

1354
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,740
I don't know if this is a way to apologize or not.

1355
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:58,340
..because this emotion is so new to me.

1356
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,820
Divya..

1357
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,220
Divya, your father ..

1358
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:06,580
True, I want to cheat on your father but I really love you.

1359
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:10,100
Love and revenge are 2 different emotions.

1360
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,220
..don't mix it like a cocktail

1361
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,780
We will say we love if we love someone, as well as revenge.

1362
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:22,380
I was unlucky because I had to do both at the same time. Do you understand?

1363
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,020
Berambus.

1364
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:29,580
Divya..

1365
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:33,860
He told me to bring two, but I only brought one.

1366
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:35,580
This is so bad, you know?

1367
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,620
Divya..?

1368
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,020
Divya, listen.

1369
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,740
Okay, I'm sorry. I have the solution.

1370
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:43,940
We forget what happened.

1371
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,340
We start all over again.

1372
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,700
Love me once again.

1373
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,820
Divya, please.

1374
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,020
Throw it away.

1375
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,900
Throw.

1376
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,500
Look here, Divya ..

1377
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,580
Just flip.

1378
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,500
Apologize to the bowl.

1379
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:07,700
What?

1380
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:09,780
I'm sorry.

1381
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,020
Sorry.

1382
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,180
Can the bowl be repaired?

1383
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,380
No.

1384
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,140
This time I will win in this game.

1385
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,260
Divya..

1386
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,460
Divya please. Listen to me.

1387
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:56,060
For the sake of the weary eastern horizon, will the sun never rise again?

1388
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:07,140
For the sake of a lone star, won't the moon appear again?

1389
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:18,540
For the sake of an unshakable beach, won't the waves storm again?

1390
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:25,220
I ask that you love me..

1391
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:32,900
Love me once again.

1392
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:40,140
Love me once again.

1393
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:47,020
Love me once again.

1394
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:55,340
Love me one more time, baby.

1395
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:14,100
Whether it's a dream or a cry.

1396
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,580
Don't you see it again in your eyes?

1397
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:21,460
Whether it's sadness or joy.

1398
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:25,140
Don't you feel it again in your heart?

1399
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:28,620
Look at me once more, smile at me once more.

1400
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:32,340
You did the same thing over and over until now.

1401
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,900
You're showing the same anger you once showed.

1402
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:40,100
Like that, can't you love me one more time?

1403
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,060
Love me once again.

1404
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,780
Love me once again.

1405
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:20,260
I apologize with all my heart.

1406
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:24,180
I'm sorry just this once.

1407
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:31,820
This error will not happen again. Love me for the second time.

1408
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,460
I will come again. I'll see you again.

1409
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:39,300
I will be introduced to you once again.

1410
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,820
I will give my heart to you again.

1411
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:46,700
Love me like it's your habit.

1412
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,700
Love me once again.

1413
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,780
Love me once again.

1414
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,420
Love me once again.

1415
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:12,860
Love me one more time, baby.

1416
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:18,140
Love me once again.

1417
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,340
Today the boss is an hour and a half late.

1418
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,780
Sorry. - Excuse me, boss?

1419
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,900
We only have 20 days left.

1420
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:45,340
I can't stand the pressure, I feel like I just want to stop.

1421
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:48,300
Divya could no longer be persuaded.

1422
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,220
One ‘double shot’ cappuccino. I'm having a headache.

1423
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,260
Lately, many bosses have been drinking 'double shot'.

1424
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,980
It's all because of Divya.

1425
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:00,500
That's right.

1426
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,940
I can't forget him.

1427
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,620
I'm used to him being there.

1428
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:07,460
Yes ..

1429
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:09,140
Now..

1430
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,580
How will Krishna Murthy handle such a situation?

1431
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:18,100
Will she feel guilty if her love fails.

1432
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,660
He won't taste anything. He's stupid.

1433
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,620
- He'll just put it aside. - So we do the same thing.

1434
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,340
Hey, you tell me.

1435
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:25,700
Tell me something to forget Divya.

1436
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,620
Divya just wasted the boss, apart from the 'double shot' she didn't know anything.

1437
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:30,340
No..

1438
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:33,780
We should just save the love for Divya, don't bother right away.

1439
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:37,020
Tell me something that will raise my anger at Krishna Murthy.

1440
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:38,980
Why do you laugh when you get slapped?

1441
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,060
I know boss, the emotion is not from here.

1442
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:41,620
another from there.

1443
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,860
I have news, boss.

1444
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:46,460
If I told the boss, of course the boss would upset Krishna Murthy.

1445
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,180
This emotion is not from here, but from there.

1446
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:51,140
Krishna Murthy bought oil and natural gas wells in Spain.

1447
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,740
It actually belongs to Kapil Sinha.

1448
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,540
He said there were butterflies that were rarely found and bought the project at a cheap price.

1449
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:56,940
If the project is started, he will be on the Forbes list.

1450
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:59,940
So our target is no longer 35,000 crore but lakh crore.

1451
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:03,420
If we can stop the project, Krishna Murthy will be destroyed.

1452
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,460
Dad, what's all this?

1453
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:17,500
It's okay, ma'am.

1454
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:22,660
They think their air and water will be polluted if we dig for natural gas here.

1455
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,260
Islanders objected to the project.

1456
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,620
So, what will happen?

1457
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:29,020
Nothing baby.

1458
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:31,860
lanya under the law of the Department of the Environment of the Government of Spain.

1459
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:35,620
In three or four days they will give dad a certificate of discharge.

1460
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:37,060
We can keep working.

1461
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,140
Taxi.

1462
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,580
Welcome to Spain.

1463
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:41,620
Divya, you?

1464
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,020
Is this all your plan?

1465
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,820
If you want to see our boss, you can just call him.

1466
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:46,900
Why kidnap anyway?

1467
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,700
We just landed, they kidnapped us.

1468
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:50,420
You haven't just landed now ..

1469
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,340
But 3 days before.

1470
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,220
Did you hear what I said?

1471
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:57,180
You came to Spain three days ago.

1472
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,140
As soon as you arrive, you go to the Spanish state library.

1473
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,780
Collect all the articles about dad's gas land.

1474
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:04,260
..that is a 20 -year -old eco zone area.

1475
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,100
From there you go to the Ministry of Environment and make a complaint.

1476
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,100
You incited the people in the area.

1477
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:29,740
..and make them protest this oil and natural gas project.

1478
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:33,180
I know why you did all this.

1479
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:35,940
In 2 days the Environment Committee will be here.

1480
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:39,740
If the Committee does not issue a certificate of clearance, the project will be stalled.

1481
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,180
So my dad will lose in this game.

1482
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,060
He will lose all his possessions.

1483
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:47,100
This is your plan, isn't it?

1484
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,500
And this plan you call an operation ..

1485
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,020
LEAD.

1486
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:53,620
Lead (Lead)

1487
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:54,540
L means Library

1488
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,780
E means Minister of Environment.

1489
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:58,340
A means excited.

1490
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,180
And D, I still don't know.

1491
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:02,420
I need to know.

1492
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:04,220
Otherwise, you will continue to be here.

1493
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,980
D means Divya.

1494
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,700
I didn't come here because of your father, Divya.

1495
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:10,900
I came for you.

1496
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,340
Don't gossip.

1497
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:16,380
LEAD.

1498
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:20,700
How does Divya know our plans?

1499
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,860
I have no doubt he's the boss.

1500
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,380
He's a good guy, boss.

1501
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:33,220
- Actually I think .. - You shut up.

1502
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,340
We don't understand the language of the boss. He doesn't understand our language either.

1503
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:39,220
Want me to talk, boss?

1504
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,900
You want to say what we think, right?

1505
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:44,660
Bunch.

1506
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,380
The boss who told Divya, right boss? Because of love?

1507
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,300
I want some juice, boss.

1508
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,660
From now on, you all can't know anything about my plans.

1509
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,980
- Sorry boss. - Go out!

1510
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,260
What? What do you think?

1511
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:04,940
You can't think of anything.

1512
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,260
Finish it. Finish it right.

1513
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:08,020
Now talk.

1514
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:09,220
What does D mean?

1515
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,540
What are you going to do to my father?

1516
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:11,660
D means Divya.

1517
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:12,580
Finished.

1518
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:13,700
Are you done?

1519
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:14,820
Nah.

1520
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:17,340
Finish all this. Finish it.

1521
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:20,140
- Okay. What does ISRO mean? - Indian Space Research Organization.

1522
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,700
-NASA? - National Auronotic Space Administration

1523
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:23,940
Who is the President of Britain?

1524
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:26,260
Britain has no President. They have a Prime Minister.

1525
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:27,860
Think before you ask questions.

1526
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:30,660
Oh, so you're thinking in between the time intervals of my question?

1527
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:31,660
No way.

1528
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,940
Let me know.

1529
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:33,900
D means what

1530
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:35,020
D means Divya.

1531
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:35,940
Ready.

1532
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:39,620
I want to bathe.

1533
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:42,060
Where is the bathroom?

1534
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:54,260
What?

1535
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:55,940
I have some questions.

1536
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:57,980
Do you want me to answer from the bathroom?

1537
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:00,740
No problem, you can answer while you take a shower.

1538
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:03,900
Sachin Tendulkar.

1539
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,100
What?

1540
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,860
That's the answer to your next question.

1541
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,300
How do you know I want to ask that question?

1542
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,140
I know.

1543
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:17,380
Anyone 2 feet away from me I would know their frequency.

1544
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,860
What does that mean?

1545
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,980
I know what they're thinking.

1546
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:25,620
So talk.

1547
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:27,780
The answer to my next question?

1548
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:28,980
Belgium.

1549
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:33,100
Talk now.

1550
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:34,260
Answer the next question.

1551
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,300
Britain.

1552
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:40,580
Speak up. Answer the next question.

1553
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:46,060
Frequency is not close enough. A little close.

1554
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:49,820
Close again.

1555
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:54,900
Close again.

1556
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:56,420
Close again.

1557
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,140
Amir Khan 


1558
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,220
How can...

1559
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,420
It's hard to believe.

1560
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:10,140
I don't believe it myself.

1561
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,340
You left a question paper in the bathroom.

1562
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,820
- Divya. - What?

1563
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:20,780
D means Divya.

1564
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:26,500
What?

1565
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,700
I have emotions left behind.

1566
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:30,500
I want to take a shower now.

1567
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:31,860
This is the right time.

1568
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,500
Actually if you're too close to me ..

1569
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:37,460
When I gave Amir Khan's answer ..

1570
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,020
I feel like I want to kiss you.

1571
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:41,860
You know me right?

1572
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,460
Whatever the emotion, I will try to resolve it immediately.

1573
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,620
If I don't make it and just keep that emotion in me..

1574
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:49,460
I will probably do it on other people.

1575
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:51,540
So if you give me that kiss again ..

1576
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,860
I will go.

1577
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:53,860
No way.

1578
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,780
Why not possible?

1579
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,460
What's the matter you can't kiss me?

1580
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,740
After all, you don't love me.

1581
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:02,100
No.

1582
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:06,940
Will you feel emotional or romantic if I kiss you?

1583
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:08,700
- Then let me know. - I don't feel that way.

1584
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:09,620
So?

1585
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,020
So there is no problem if I want to take my kiss again.

1586
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:14,980
That's all. Are you ready?

1587
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,980
Forget it.

1588
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,940
You might get emotional if I kiss you.

1589
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:27,700
Kiss Me. Kiss!

1590
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:38,740
In fact..

1591
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,620
I want to hug you before I kiss you.

1592
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:45,740
Let me be filled with that emotion as well.

1593
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,420
I will not taste anything ..

1594
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:50,460
Did you see that?

1595
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:53,380
You don't feel anything.

1596
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,980
Because you don't love me.

1597
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:58,980
Because this is my emotion.

1598
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:04,260
Look, even now you don't feel anything.

1599
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:08,580
But why is your breath heavy?

1600
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,700
Are you mad at me?

1601
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,380
Emotions?

1602
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:16,820
How do we know if it's emotional or angry?

1603
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:23,060
We'll find out if we test this hair.

1604
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:25,380
Do you know one thing?

1605
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:29,700
When girls start to get emotional. estrogen levels in the body increase.

1606
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:32,780
If we test this...

1607
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:36,140
We will know whether it is emotion or anger.

1608
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:38,300
We test it in the lab.

1609
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:40,220
Go take a shower.

1610
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:41,740
I will wait.

1611
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,500
Actually Divya, there is another emotion.

1612
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,380
Hi good afternoon. - Good evening.

1613
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,700
Good evening. - Hi..

1614
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:55,820
In fact..

1615
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,260
This is a hair sample and..

1616
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,740
I want to check this girl's estrogen level.

1617
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,940
Yes, I can, but I need his signature.

1618
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,820
You need a signature here.

1619
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,300
Thank you very much, Divya.

1620
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,980
Because come to the lab with me.

1621
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:16,060
If this test proves you have no feelings for me ..

1622
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,060
I will never see you again.

1623
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,100
- Here he is. - Thanks very much.

1624
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:35,900
Why did you bring me here?

1625
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:37,540
Abhi, do you remember this place?

1626
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:42,020
This is not the third place you have visited in Spain.

1627
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:44,140
This is fourth place.

1628
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:50,620
Do you know what D is?

1629
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,700
Dock.

1630
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:56,860
Three days ago you came to the pier.

1631
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,220
You met an animal smuggler.

1632
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:01,980
So generally, as soon as the Spanish Committee arrives tomorrow.

1633
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:03,660
You're going to drop it on the gas project.

1634
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:05,660
Your plan is to stop the project.

1635
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,900
What you don't know is ..

1636
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:10,300
The committee will not come tomorrow.

1637
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,300
They came today.

1638
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,300
In fact, they have already left.

1639
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,620
They have moved from the hotel.

1640
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:23,020
They were on their way to the gas project site.

1641
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,780
So this is my operation.

1642
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:34,100
I didn’t even come to the lab to know about my feelings.

1643
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:36,060
I just want to distract you.

1644
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:37,700
I have no feelings for you.

1645
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:39,460
Anyway ..

1646
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:42,140
In half an hour the Committee will issue a certificate of discharge.

1647
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:44,180
You only have 30 minutes.

1648
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,100
Do what you can.

1649
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,060
Abhi..

1650
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:56,540
I really want to see you depressed.

1651
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:58,060
Good luck.

1652
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:03,460
Hello JD. - Yes, ma'am.

1653
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:06,420
For safety, you better follow Abhi.

1654
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:29,900
Hi all.

1655
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:30,860
Glad to see you.

1656
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:35,180
This NOC was signed by the Spanish Environment Committee

1657
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:40,020
All Kay Gas Company affairs will be handled.

1658
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:44,180
I am proud to appoint my daughter, Divyanka as CEO of Kay Gas Ltd.

1659
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:45,300
Congratulations.

1660
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:50,420
Oh JD. - Yes, ma'am.

1661
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:53,180
Tie guarantees Abhi to come out.

1662
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:54,740
Now he can't do anything to us.

1663
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:56,620
But Abhi has been released.

1664
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,100
Why?

1665
01:50:58,100 --> 01:51:01,180
It's not an endangered rat, it's just a normal rat.

1666
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:02,700
lanya is always found in Spain, that's why

1667
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:04,260
He was released because it was not a crime.

1668
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:05,420
What kind?

1669
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:08,020
Possible..

1670
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:11,220
D does not mean pier.

1671
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:11,980
Is she madam?

1672
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:14,300
JD you follow me. - Okay ma'am.

1673
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,820
Dr. Robinson. - Yes.

1674
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:22,260
Can't check the girl's estrogen level with a hair sample.

1675
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:22,860
What?

1676
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,700
lanya gossip. Medically impossible.

1677
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,700
I still haven't received the report. Can you give it to me?

1678
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:34,340
Good.

1679
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:38,260
This is a DNA report..

1680
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:39,020
Yes.

1681
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:42,500
The young man came one day for a DNA test.

1682
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,340
With a sample of the blood sample that was brought.

1683
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:45,860
And match it with your DNA sample.

1684
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:48,980
Can you tell me whose blood sample it is?

1685
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,740
Sir.

1686
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:55,260
Hey, ayah.

1687
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:56,980
Divya, why did you suddenly leave the party?

1688
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:58,660
Dad, I want to go to jail.

1689
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,700
Dad, Abhi distracts us.

1690
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,620
He went to jail and he found someone.

1691
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:04,780
He brought a blood sample to... - Divya.

1692
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,740
You are the son of Krishna Murthy. Don't forget that.

1693
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,380
You look down on his wisdom.

1694
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:11,060
Dad, let me finish it.

1695
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,060
Okay, come back quickly.

1696
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,580
Okay, Bye-bye. Stop here.

1697
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:21,260
JD, take this. - Good ma'am.

1698
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:22,540
Give me the letter.

1699
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:23,860
- Okay. - Thank you.

1700
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,380
- Giri. - Sir.

1701
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:35,620
- Giri - I'm coming sir.

1702
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,940
Teleton Divya soon.

1703
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:44,180
- Sir. - Hello Div..JD, where is Divya?

1704
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:45,860
Sir, madam go to the central prison of Cartegena.

1705
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:47,740
He can't go to jail.

1706
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:49,020
Stop him.

1707
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:50,580
Okay, sir. Ma'am!

1708
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:51,580
Thank you.

1709
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:52,620
Point.

1710
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:53,580
Ma'am, wait.

1711
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,140
Stop, you can't come in.

1712
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:57,420
Sir, this is an important call. I need to talk to him.

1713
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:59,980
Sir, please. Go.

1714
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:03,060
Hello, sir. They wouldn't let me in.

1715
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:10,220
Rosa..

1716
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:13,300
Is he not with you?

1717
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:15,220
Why is this?

1718
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:17,140
He wants to meet with a prisoner.

1719
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:18,980
Want me to follow you? - All right, come on.

1720
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,500
Okay, thank you.

1721
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,100
What is your name?

1722
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:19,900
What is your relationship with Abhi?

1723
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,340
Why did he find you?

1724
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:23,820
What do you two want to do to my father?

1725
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:27,780
If anything happened to my father, I would not let anyone go.

1726
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,540
I do not know.

1727
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:34,300
He came to see me and asked me to hand him this envelope.

1728
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:53,380
Come Divya, mother angel.

1729
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,500
Father. - That's dad.

1730
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,860
Thank you.

1731
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:04,780
- Tandas. - Let me take him.

1732
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:13,620
I'm sorry ma'am.

1733
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:15,340
I want to check your bag.

1734
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:16,060
Hello.

1735
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:20,220
What are you doing?

1736
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,220
I dont know anything.

1737
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,380
Krishna?

1738
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:36,060
Krishna?

1739
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,180
Mother?

1740
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:21,500
D for dreams.

1741
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:24,020
Your dream.

1742
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,540
You want to know how I know your dreams, right?

1743
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:28,620
Because it's not a dream, it's a reality.

1744
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,780
reality, forever it's like a dream chasing.

1745
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,820
You once said, once it breaks it won't be restored.

1746
01:57:44,540 --> 01:57:46,980
But if what's broken is put back...

1747
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:49,020
Only then do you know how beautiful it is.

1748
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,540
This is for you.

1749
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,300
Your estrogen levels are high.

1750
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:37,340
Hi Baby, take it easy, because of you, take it easy.

1751
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:40,620
In my heart, slowly, the cylinder began, bursting.

1752
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:44,140
Oh my god, slow down, because of you, slow down.

1753
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:47,340
On my body, slowly, Petrol marks are placed.

1754
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:54,220
Your knife is like a smile that cuts all my sleep.

1755
01:58:54,580 --> 01:59:00,540
You threw away all my shyness.

1756
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:05,340
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.

1757
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:12,140
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.

1758
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:39,940
If you become my main source of energy, the 'kissometer' inside me just explodes

1759
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:41,700
If you become my main source of energy- the 'kissometer' inside me just exploded

1760
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:48,580
If you hold me tight, the 'heartmeter' inside of me just explodes.

1761
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:55,580
Your shadow gives me my shadow makes me go crazy.

1762
01:59:55,820 --> 02:00:01,660
Your speed becomes cyanide and drives the world crazy.

1763
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:07,020
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.

1764
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:13,580
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.

1765
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:49,900
If you're away from me, we shiver like an ice bucket challenge.

1766
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:56,700
If you and I get close, we'll fall apart like a jug of juicing.

1767
02:00:57,060 --> 02:01:03,580
Your love is like a plane crashing down on me.

1768
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:09,900
Your words are like a kite that takes me high.

1769
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:15,140
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.

1770
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:21,820
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.

1771
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:43,740
Please wait in the next room

1772
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:45,300
Go out.

1773
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,700
The war has begun.

1774
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:53,740
In one round there are 100 people.

1775
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:56,260
The first person has a sword.

1776
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:57,940
The first person killed the second person.

1777
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:00,580
He gave the third person the sword.

1778
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:03,700
The third killed the fourth.

1779
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:05,460
And give the sword to the fifth man.

1780
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:07,740
That's how the murder went on.

1781
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:11,220
Out of 100 people only one remained.

1782
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:13,020
And that person is the one who...

1783
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:14,660
73rd person.

1784
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:19,060
0.2 seconds.

1785
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:22,220
You answered in a short time that means ..

1786
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:24,100
You are Ramesh Chandra Prasad!

1787
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:27,820
I don't recognize you Subramaniam.

1788
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:30,820
But I can't forget Kautilya.

1789
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:32,020
Kautilya!

1790
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:33,860
I haven't heard that sound in a long time.

1791
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:36,540
I miss him.

1792
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:42,460
If people haven't seen him for a long time, he will ask how are you.

1793
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:44,740
But I don't need to ask you either.

1794
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:48,140
When I look at you like this, I feel so sorry.

1795
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,460
So there is nothing wrong if your child is hurt.

1796
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:56,140
I feel sorry when I know your future.

1797
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:59,140
It's a pity when your child isn't with you.

1798
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:01,620
Yes you are right.

1799
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:03,540
My daughter.

1800
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:05,820
Remember that. We will discuss it later.

1801
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:08,900
In this game, you are sure your son will win right?

1802
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:11,580
If he succeeds in making you come see me ..

1803
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:15,740
So to beat you, that's not a big deal for my son.

1804
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:27,780
You have a strong desire to survive, right?

1805
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:31,420
I live only to see the destruction of your life.

1806
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,820
You should live because ..

1807
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:37,940
You should see your whole family destroyed. Then you can die.

1808
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:41,540
That's why I brought the best doctors from London.

1809
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:44,060
You deserve to live to lose.

1810
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:47,020
Didn't I tell you to remember something?

1811
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:47,900
My child.

1812
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:49,100
I have never lost.

1813
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:51,420
That's why there's no need to kill other people.

1814
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:53,700
But if the situation can make me lose ..

1815
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:56,140
To win, I am willing to kill.

1816
02:03:59,620 --> 02:04:01,900
When your eldest son gets the news of your death ..

1817
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:04,660
..he will rush to the hospital.

1818
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:09,500
And my game began.

1819
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:13,020
The butterfly effect.

1820
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:18,020
Abhi, when did it happen?

1821
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:19,620
What happen?

1822
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:21,460
You gave a message saying dad was gone.

1823
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:22,420
Me?

1824
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:23,580
I didn't even message my brother.

1825
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:26,740
- Are you drunk - No.

1826
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:30,420
Today is the last day you have to defeat Krishna Murthy?

1827
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:32,820
Still ego right?

1828
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:36,220
Sweety's three -hour drive hasn't eaten yet.

1829
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:38,820
I had an important meeting but I ran here.

1830
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:40,020
Is this the right time?

1831
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:42,620
Don't call my brother again. Never call.

1832
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,900
If your father dies, don't call.

1833
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:45,940
Brother listen to me .. - Enough!

1834
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:46,940
We're done!

1835
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:49,460
Listen to me brother ..

1836
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:51,420
Forgive me. This is for you.

1837
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:53,620
For me? - Yes.

1838
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:57,220
Hello.

1839
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:00,020
Remember the date again? 1 September.

1840
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:03,020
You only have 2 hours left to beat me.

1841
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:05,420
In the meantime, what say we play the game?

1842
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:08,060
Before playing, I want to tell you the shocking news.

1843
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:12,300
In Africa, there is an endangered species of scorpion named ..

1844
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:16,780
Whatever it sounds like, the sting is very poisonous.

1845
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:18,860
..and if you get hit you will die in 6 hours.

1846
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:21,100
Actually I have two tails.

1847
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:24,420
One is missing. Do you see?

1848
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:29,860
You've already found it.

1849
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:31,740
So you only have 30 minutes.

1850
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,620
Don't worry, I won't kill anyone.

1851
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:35,260
I will just win.

1852
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:38,100
So I'll give you a clue.

1853
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:47,460
Find and save yourself.

1854
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:58,180
Do you have trouble breathing?

1855
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:00,900
It seems that the poison is already effective. That's just the first rank.

1856
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:02,900
The second stage, your knees will be weak.

1857
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:05,380
The third stage, your vision will be blurred.

1858
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:08,620
The fourth stage, remember this, we will discuss it later.

1859
02:06:08,620 --> 02:06:10,900
Is there a drug called VX06ZFM?

1860
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,780
You won't get the antidote at the pharmacy.

1861
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:14,340
Can you check it again?

1862
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:15,300
He will deny it.

1863
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:16,700
No. There is no such medicine.

1864
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:19,300
That's my brother's car number.

1865
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:54,140
Do you know who's after you?

1866
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:56,140
The most dangerous medical drug mafia.

1867
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:58,540
You know what's in your hand? Synthetic drugs.

1868
02:06:58,540 --> 02:06:59,860
It's worth millions of pounds.

1869
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:03,540
The box will save you and they will kill you for the box.

1870
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:11,380
does it look the same? There is only one antidote.

1871
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:13,380
You are wiser than the wisest of them.

1872
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:15,140
Find the right medicine, and save yourself.

1873
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:16,220
Cepatlah Abhi..

1874
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:29,500
Brother, do you use saline? - Yes.

1875
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:30,820
My brother went near the saline bottle.

1876
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:34,300
On the bag there is a number circled with a red pen.

1877
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:35,180
Why is this?

1878
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:36,260
Tell me that number.

1879
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:40,740
105 000 2526

1880
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:46,060
What number did he ask you?

1881
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,820
3041

1882
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:07,620
I told you to remember something, right?

1883
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:08,580
Don't you remember?

1884
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:11,180
He ranks fourth. Your brain stopped working.

1885
02:08:11,180 --> 02:08:12,940
Your IQ is 0.

1886
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:14,380
Now you are a fool.

1887
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:17,340
You leave the box open in the train and release the carbon dioxide.

1888
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,700
You called your second brother to ask for a number.

1889
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:22,540
Now the three of you are nearing death.

1890
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:25,740
You should live for your father, Abhi ..

1891
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:26,580
You should continue to live for your father, .Abhi ..

1892
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:29,420
Lari Abhi, lari..

1893
02:08:43,700 --> 02:08:44,860
Give me the box.

1894
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:52,660
Come on, let's go.

1895
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:09,700
Abang ..

1896
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:29,180
I'm sorry, you have food for my child, milk.

1897
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:30,620
Thank you..

1898
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:41,740
My child, hungry. Any bread?

1899
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:46,740
1050002526

1900
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:50,020
In this game if you win, you still lose.

1901
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:52,860
You will be arrested for drug trafficking and imprisoned.

1902
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:53,900
For 10 years.

1903
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,540
Game over.

1904
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:11,820
May I have your name?

1905
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:13,300
Abhiram.

1906
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:14,540
Date of birth?

1907
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:15,940
May 28, 1989

1908
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:19,540
And you have a lawyer to represent you today?

1909
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:20,660
No.

1910
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:23,100
I don't think I have a lawyer.

1911
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:23,900
There, officer.

1912
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:26,100
I am Vamsi. Advocate Abhi.

1913
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:29,780
Good afternoon Sergeant. This is a bail document.

1914
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:36,540
Can I have your ID?

1915
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:46,300
Brother, wait a minute.

1916
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:49,460
Where did you get the money for bail?

1917
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:51,660
There is no money in the account.

1918
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:53,180
Brother sells brother's car.

1919
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:55,220
What is all this, brother ..?

1920
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:57,820
That's my brother's favorite car.

1921
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:01,180
It's just a Range rover.

1922
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:04,740
When I was little, I went to school in a Ferrari.

1923
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:10,700
It's not as important as Dad.

1924
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:25,100
Let's go. Krishna Murthy doesn't have much time.

1925
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,860
Just one more hour.

1926
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:35,020
Sir, they're at the mall.

1927
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:40,060
Where is he?

1928
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:41,460
He went to the lord's salon.

1929
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:45,260
Salon? What do they do?

1930
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:47,220
They massage the head at the salon.

1931
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:48,660
Head massage?

1932
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:50,500
Are they crazy?

1933
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:57,300
I can't tie it properly.

1934
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:58,460
I'm there for my brother.

1935
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:00,860
Sir, they bought new clothes.

1936
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:02,540
Only 30 minutes left but are they shopping?

1937
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:04,580
Do you follow them or do you follow other people?

1938
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:05,780
Sir, I'm following them.

1939
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:08,380
Why is your line busy?

1940
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:10,060
Sir, they go to our office now.

1941
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:11,260
Our office?

1942
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:27,700
JD..

1943
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:31,380
The boys have come to class. Do not disturb for 10 minutes.

1944
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:38,300
Head massage, shopping ..

1945
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:40,300
New suit.

1946
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:42,340
- Looks cool. - Thank you sir.

1947
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:44,580
You understand your physical condition very well.

1948
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:46,500
Your defeat must be beautiful.

1949
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:48,940
On the run you really need a new suit.

1950
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:53,060
Your father also wore a suit while running away.

1951
02:13:56,220 --> 02:14:00,420
Nice. Follow the example of your father. Only 5 minutes left.

1952
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,380
It's tomorrow's newspaper.

1953
02:14:05,380 --> 02:14:06,900
"Krishna Murthy's empire collapsed."

1954
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:09,460
This is today's newspaper. "Krishna Murthy escaped."

1955
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,140
It's the next day's news.

1956
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:13,060
"Krishna Murthy changed his identity."

1957
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:14,820
Take this and show it to your father.

1958
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:16,420
Before dying, he should die happily.

1959
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:17,980
Save this.

1960
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:19,420
There must be some use.

1961
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:20,780
I know you have no money.

1962
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:22,580
Funerals should be made on a massive scale.

1963
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:23,860
And enjoy a medical ‘manicure’ too.

1964
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:25,380
And enjoy the 'medical manicure too.

1965
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:26,100
Go out.

1966
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:31,260
Sir, my brother wants to take a selfie with you.

1967
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:32,740
Come on brother ..

1968
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:39,140
Brother ... - Yes, brother.

1969
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:40,780
Game begin.

1970
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:45,140
- Brother. - Yes.

1971
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:46,820
Beg. - Thank you.

1972
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:53,500
Time for a game.

1973
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:59,140
Now I want to tell you a scam.

1974
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:02,580
If you believe it is deception then it will be deception.

1975
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,620
What is he?

1976
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:07,340
This is a kick check.

1977
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:08,740
Because ...

1978
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:10,540
Your bank balance is empty.

1979
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:13,020
Check if necessary.

1980
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,420
I am serious.

1981
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:30,940
You are right.

1982
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:33,100
Not 35.

1983
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:34,180
It's 40.

1984
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:36,820
And the difference is 5000 kror.

1985
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:40,620
Three.

1986
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:42,520
Two..

1987
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:43,580
One..

1988
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:46,660
Boom!

1989
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:04,780
What happened to my account?

1990
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:06,540
Wait a minute sir, let me check.

1991
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:09,260
The lord who gave permission.

1992
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:10,620
When do I give permission?

1993
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:11,940
What are you doing?

1994
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:15,260
Sorry to inform, your account balance is empty.

1995
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:37,180
How?

1996
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:38,100
It's easy sir.

1997
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:40,300
You remember it was a hoax, and it came true.

1998
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:44,380
This is a satellite device that generates passwords.

1999
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:45,620
How can you hack it?

2000
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:46,580
That's right sir.

2001
02:16:46,580 --> 02:16:47,980
It's hard to hack it.

2002
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:49,860
But it's easy to type.

2003
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:51,660
I do not understand.

2004
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:55,420
Paintings bought with money from my brother's efforts ..

2005
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:57,260
I installed a small camera.

2006
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:06,180
So the moment you look at the password and type it ..

2007
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:09,060
My assistant saw it and also typed in the password.

2008
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:41,980
We succeeded.

2009
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:43,180
His fingers are very fast.

2010
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:45,380
That's why I chose him.

2011
02:17:52,980 --> 02:17:54,260
I can understand ..

2012
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:55,820
Why do you doubt when all this happens?

2013
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:56,780
Easy sir.

2014
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:58,780
Our favorite theory.

2015
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:00,780
The butterfly effect.

2016
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:06,420
All this happens because of the position in this room.

2017
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:09,340
If this table was there all this would not happen.

2018
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:10,340
Father.

2019
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:13,180
The position of the furniture in this room causes negative things to happen.

2020
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:14,540
What if it is arranged differently.

2021
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:16,060
JD where is 42 degrees northeast?

2022
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:19,620
If the table is here, the sun will shine there.

2023
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:22,860
Real beauty will be visible if it is exposed to sunlight.

2024
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:24,140
Put the painting there.

2025
02:18:24,980 --> 02:18:28,380
Because the painting is placed there then our work becomes easier.

2026
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:37,420
While you were eavesdropping on my conversation ..

2027
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:40,380
I can see what you're doing.

2028
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:42,540
Your device.

2029
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:58,500
Great game.

2030
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:00,940
You win.

2031
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:03,340
But I didn't lose.

2032
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:11,460
Natural oil and gas. Kay Group Company.

2033
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:14,020
The largest coal area in Europe.

2034
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:17,180
Each share is worth 1 lakh.

2035
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:18,900
25,000 members.

2036
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:21,300
Millions of lakhs ..

2037
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:23,060
Unlimited amount of oil storage.

2038
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:25,380
So is the value of the stock.

2039
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:30,380
The money I lost, I can get it in a month.

2040
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:32,820
Now go.

2041
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:08,620
- Hello? Hello? - Speak up.

2042
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:09,340
Sir.

2043
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:10,820
I am Giri from Spain.

2044
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:12,980
Sir, the gas at the mine has run out.

2045
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:15,420
it doesn't burn.

2046
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:18,380
Gas, what kind ..?

2047
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:19,900
How can it run out?

2048
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:22,220
Do you remember it's a gas tank that can be empty?

2049
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:23,100
lanya lombong!

2050
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:27,740
It's a gas tank. Very large barrel.

2051
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:30,220
They put it 10km away, sir.

2052
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:34,580
From there they installed a large pipe to connect it.

2053
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:36,700
They make us believe that there is gas here.

2054
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:45,380
We have been deceived sir.

2055
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:22,100
Turn off the gas.

2056
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:24,540
The owner from Kapil Sinha..

2057
02:21:24,620 --> 02:21:26,500
..is a friend of my father, Sathpal Singh.

2058
02:21:31,420 --> 02:21:32,740
Do you know who they are?

2059
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:34,580
KMC Company Employees.

2060
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:35,940
For people who fail like us..

2061
02:21:36,060 --> 02:21:37,740
I have set up a company.

2062
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:38,540
Company name..

2063
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:39,700
KMC

2064
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:40,340
it means ..

2065
02:21:40,660 --> 02:21:43,300
Krishna Murthy Scam Company.

2066
02:21:44,820 --> 02:21:47,780
I will explain about this company for 2 minutes.

2067
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:52,460
The same emotion in all of us ..

2068
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:54,580
Krishna Murthy.

2069
02:21:54,820 --> 02:21:57,380
Everyone is here, including my father.

2070
02:21:57,380 --> 02:21:59,060
Has been deceived by Krishna Murthy.

2071
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:02,100
Krishna Murthy is the reason our family is homeless.

2072
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:05,100
My goal is to make him empty. That's my goal.

2073
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:09,300
That is our company.

2074
02:22:10,860 --> 02:22:13,220
You remember this game started 30 days ago.

2075
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:16,780
But I started the game against you 10 years ago.

2076
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:20,820
My dad told and gave us everything we needed.

2077
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:23,700
But I got to know what my dad wanted before that again.

2078
02:22:23,980 --> 02:22:26,860
What did you do?

2079
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:29,500
Nothing baby ..

2080
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:33,860
What he could not tell others, he wrote in his diary.

2081
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:37,500
I'm sorry, Krishna Murthy.

2082
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:40,820
I didn't do all this because I pissed you off.

2083
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:43,180
I did all this because of my love for my father.

2084
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:49,340
You have nothing now.

2085
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:54,820
All the investors in your company already know your situation now.

2086
02:22:58,100 --> 02:22:59,780
You have been completely besieged.

2087
02:23:03,020 --> 02:23:05,020
You have no choice but to run away.

2088
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:10,180
Abang ..

2089
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:16,580
This is a special gift for you.

2090
02:23:17,380 --> 02:23:19,020
It must be very useful for you.

2091
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:22,100
It's a surprise.

2092
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:27,700
Game over.

2093
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:34,620
There he is.

2094
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:03,580
This is a special gift for you.

2095
02:24:03,580 --> 02:24:05,060
It must be very useful for you.

2096
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:45,780
I am sorry. The situation is very critical.

2097
02:24:46,300 --> 02:24:47,580
We've tried.

2098
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:14,940
Father..

2099
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:18,140
Father..

2100
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:20,780
Father..

2101
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:22,900
It's over dad.

2102
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:25,660
The work my father told me to do is done.

2103
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:28,420
I threw Krishna Murthy to the side of the road, father.

2104
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:30,220
She's fine.

2105
02:25:31,220 --> 02:25:32,820
I came to tell my father.

2106
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:35,220
But why is dad like this?

2107
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:37,660
Hey, don't cry. I'll kill you later.

2108
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:41,460
I'm not dead, I'm still alive.

2109
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:43,100
If someone cries, I kill him.

2110
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:44,420
Hey! Wipe tears.

2111
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:49,100
Father..

2112
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:52,060
Dad, can you hear me?

2113
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:54,500
Dad, can you hear me?

2114
02:26:00,380 --> 02:26:03,500
Dad said dad would breathe and breathe and dad would live.

2115
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:14,380
20 years dad lived just for this, dad.

2116
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:19,860
It's dad's fault.

2117
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:22,580
What you did is wrong.

2118
02:26:24,980 --> 02:26:26,140
Father..

2119
02:26:26,140 --> 02:26:29,500
Listen to me, and please don't die.

2120
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:36,780
At the very least, live a little longer.

2121
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:38,540
Listen to what I'm saying, dad.

2122
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:43,620
After that it's up to you, I won't stop you.

2123
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:53,780
I've tried hard dad.

2124
02:26:57,700 --> 02:26:59,260
Dad, please.

2125
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:03,820
Just a moment, listen to what I have to say, father ..

2126
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:15,660
Dad, get up.

2127
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:16,820
Wake up dad.

2128
02:27:19,660 --> 02:27:21,060
Dad, get up.

2129
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,620
Wake up dad.

2130
02:27:41,740 --> 02:27:45,260
Dad for a moment. Bring a fast tv.

2131
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:54,420
In an unbelievable event ..

2132
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:55,860
Kay Gas claims ..

2133
02:27:55,860 --> 02:27:59,220
Gas mines in Spain are a scam.

2134
02:27:59,420 --> 02:28:02,740
The millionaire is finding it increasingly difficult to control the anger of the holder ..

2135
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:06,140
..stocks, investors. K Group board members, members of the public.

2136
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:10,300
Kay Group chairman Mr Krishna Murthy is currently being hunted by London police.

2137
02:28:10,300 --> 02:28:11,220
- Krishna Murthy .. - Hey you ..

2138
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:12,940
Your name?

2139
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:15,940
Subramaniam.

2140
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:16,900
Let's go.

2141
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:53,980
Every grief you face.

2142
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:56,460
All obstacles are overcome.

2143
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:58,020
Father..

2144
02:28:58,060 --> 02:28:59,580
My cradle ..

2145
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:01,460
My beloved father.

2146
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:03,980
My dear father..

2147
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:06,940
My dear father..

2148
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:09,460
My dear father..

2149
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:10,700
My pray..

2150
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:12,580
My life..

2151
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:39,100
I remember I had to express my emotions at the same time.

2152
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:40,100
But..

2153
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:43,780
I don't want to express these sad emotions.

2154
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:49,340
We have to hide some emotions in our lives.

2155
02:29:50,340 --> 02:29:52,100
So that I will never forget my father.

2156
02:29:52,300 --> 02:29:53,340
Meaning ..

2157
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:55,860
This pain should be with me forever.

2158
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:57,500
My beloved father..

2159
02:29:57,940 --> 02:30:00,460
I, Abhiram ..

2160
02:30:00,460 --> 02:36:02,460
