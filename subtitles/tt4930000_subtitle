1
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:54,091
Brotherhood and contention
is born from the same blood.

2
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,792
Brotherhood and contention
becomes rivalry..

3
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:04,396
When a brother values
the land more than his brother.

4
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,100
The temporary stonewalls
made on land for division"

5
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,109
Have caused the death
of millions of Jats in Punjab.

6
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:42,539
"A Jat and his land share
a different relationship."

7
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:49,544
"The entire history of Jats,
lies in this relationship."

8
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:01,590
"We brothers divide the land.."

9
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:08,027
"The brotherhood between
the brothers ends."

10
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:14,002
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

11
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:20,205
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

12
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,746
"When they don't
see eye to eye anymore.."

13
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:33,022
"All the ties sever, distances
increase and the matter reaches court."

14
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:39,164
"Then with time the
contention increases."

15
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,265
"The ones who used to pray
for each others' good health.."

16
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,801
"Now seek each others' blood."

17
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:50,770
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

18
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,378
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

19
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:05,184
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

20
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,538
Uncle Jassa! Uncle Jassa!

21
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,600
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

22
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,977
Uncle, look, we are sitting
on the rod, now give us a round.

23
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:08,481
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

24
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,114
Uncle, look, we are sitting
on the rod, now give us a round.

25
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,419
Uncle, give us a round.

26
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,990
You won't be able to make
thirty rounds of this. - Really?

27
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,299
I have kept this
only to give you rounds.

28
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,535
Faster, uncle. - Okay. Hold on.

29
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,506
Get me down. - What happened?

30
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,542
Why are you screaming now?

31
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,236
He will make 30 rounds.
- No, he won't.

32
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,506
Yes, he will.

33
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,744
Hey boys,
you two are troubling my brother?

34
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,751
Now let us both do it together.
Here you go. Hold on tight.

35
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,456
No! Stop!

36
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,788
What happened now?

37
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,050
Stop it. - Why?

38
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,220
You have done 30 rounds.

39
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,728
Stop it. - Very good.

40
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,159
Stop it. We will fall down.
My brother will fall down.

41
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,434
I cannot tolerate this
noise anymore, father!

42
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,440
This isn't the sound
of the tinkling bells.

43
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,571
It's the enemy hollering and saying
that that land now belongs to them..

44
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,137
The one which once
you used to cultivate on.

45
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,207
These are the thrones
left behind by my father.

46
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,220
Otherwise, I have four sons"

47
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,346
...so Pavitra wouldn't
dare to cultivate on that land.

48
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,755
Father, you don't agree.

49
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,013
Otherwise, this son of yours"

50
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,052
...would have a puff
and then break their bones.

51
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,961
Stop blabbering, Banta.

52
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:06,636
Pali Jat knows how
to keep his enemies at bay.

53
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,071
What have you achieved so far?

54
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,076
Hold on right there.

55
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,974
You know will what I am capable
of when we will see them grumble.

56
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,972
Uncle! - Papa!

57
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,982
Surjeet, what are you
doing here drinking buttermilk?

58
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,085
Don't you have to go to cut?

59
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,085
It will get crowded if you are late.

60
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,588
Yes, I have to go there, father.

61
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,214
I thought of taking the kids with me.

62
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,290
They will have an outing.

63
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,986
Let's go, Ekam. - Go.

64
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,016
I won't.

65
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,491
I will stay with uncle.

66
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,998
He is his uncle's pet.
- He won't go with me.

67
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,294
Let's go, son. - Let's go.

68
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,097
Very good.

69
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,125
Come back soon.

70
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,439
<i>Brother, Pa“ has once
again diverted the water.</i>

71
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,214
Jassa!

72
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,069
Jassa, you have messed
with the wrong person!

73
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,961
Find a place where
you can save your life.

74
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,964
Stop your nonsense, you addicted thug.

75
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,273
Look at that, headman.

76
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,973
They have stopped our water
and they are calling us thugs.

77
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,071
This is not fair. - Shut up, Dara.

78
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,378
Cheat and then act clever.

79
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,714
Your entire family just loves to lie.

80
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,615
Mind your language, Surjeet.

81
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,680
Don't make me break your head here.

82
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,091
I will break your neck.
- What are you waiting for?

83
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,390
<i>Pa“! Jassa'. Act your age'. - You'.!</i>

84
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,329
<i>Pa“, we doth want
to argue with them.</i>

85
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,696
They are like a dog's tail, Jassa.

86
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,702
It won't change unless you cut it.

87
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,101
Get lost! Take him with you!

88
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,536
Stop it.

89
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,137
Pavitra, if this is how
you had to resolve the matter..

90
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,608
...then you should have fought at home.

91
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,144
It's okay, headman.

92
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,338
You do us justice. - What justice?

93
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,574
Everyone in this village knows that
he has spent his life in the army.

94
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,482
And I kept cultivating the land.

95
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,282
He kept having fun over there.

96
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,152
Who has ever had
fun in the army, uncle?

97
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,188
You used to cultivate the land..

98
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,558
...and my father used
to give all his salary to you.

99
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,397
And then we have distributed
the land as per our father's will.

100
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,660
Your old man was the biggest traitor.

101
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,599
We are suffering because of his deeds.

102
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,968
Pali, that old man
was your grandfather.

103
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,106
Why are you defaming him,
here in front the council?

104
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,664
You will surely love him.

105
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,175
He gave everything to you.

106
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,535
Couldn't he see?

107
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,079
We are four grandsons.

108
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,271
And you have two.

109
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,677
Yet, he divided the land equally.

110
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,280
And you have been given
the land with the water source.

111
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,386
He favored you.

112
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,320
Yes, of course.
Now you are thinking about him.

113
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,017
When father needed your care,
none of you came forward.

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,720
Shut up, oh caregiver.

115
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,020
We know how you took that land.

116
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,986
And we know how to take it back.

117
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,989
I can use my stick
to make the decision.

118
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,397
You don't have that courage.

119
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,992
Half lion half jackal.

120
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,563
You brave lion.. - Come on!

121
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:02,336
"When they don't
see eye to eye anymore.."

122
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:08,349
"All the ties sever, distances
increase and the matter reaches court."

123
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:14,557
"Then with time the
contention increases."

124
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,561
"The ones who used to pray
for each others' good health.."

125
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,154
"Now seek each others' blood."

126
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:26,235
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

127
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:32,265
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

128
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,673
Mother, you cook lentils everyday.

129
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,580
How about making meat sometimes?

130
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,448
Sure, I will cook a goat for you.

131
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,084
I wonder how they can
swallow even a morsel.

132
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,386
That kid made fun of
you in front of the council.

133
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,059
And none of you could
do a thing about it.

134
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,751
Stubborn bulls.

135
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,361
Here, eat till your heart's content.

136
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,160
You have no pride in your.

137
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,757
You let them win.

138
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,632
Bittu, go inside.

139
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,003
Otherwise,
they will make you be like them.

140
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,703
Here, eat it or drown in it.

141
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,238
Oh God, what harm have I done to you?

142
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,210
All my kids are bad.

143
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,645
None of them are good.

144
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,008
That's enough, old hag.
Now see what I do.

145
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,046
<i>Pa“.
Where are you going?</i>

146
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,446
You have no sense in you.

147
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,456
Are you happy now?

148
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,425
I will end this today,
once and for all.

149
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,593
Brother, what are you doing"?
- Listen to me.

150
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,653
They keep troubling me.
- Pali, use your senses.

151
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,599
Back off! Get lost! I've
had enough of this. - Let's go back.

152
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,658
<i>Let go oi me.
- What are you doing, Pa“?</i>

153
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,239
Jassa!

154
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,034
Be careful!

155
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,041
Are you asleep?
Or are you hiding inside out of fear?

156
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,134
Why are you barking from up there?

157
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,340
This won't end like this.

158
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,646
Come down.
Meet me in the lane. I'll tell you.

159
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,779
Come on.

160
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,384
We will clear your
misunderstanding soon enough.

161
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,255
If I don't dance with my foot on your
neck then I will shave off my hair.

162
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,690
Hear him talk.

163
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:58,251
You act like great goons! I will
have to come there and chop you off.

164
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,059
Come on, then.
- Surjeet. Go inside, all of you.

165
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,296
Take them inside, old man.
Hide them inside.

166
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,994
Get inside. - Let's go inside.

167
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,027
Wait, listen to me.
- For God's sake Jassa, go inside.

168
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's go. - I will have
to do something about you.

169
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,038
Come down, and I will show you.
- Cowards.

170
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,644
Jassa, try to control your anger.

171
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,672
You want us to hide inside?

172
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,516
Son, you shouldn't behave
like animals in an animal's company.

173
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,744
I cannot tolerate this anymore.

174
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,121
If you cannot, then do
whatever you want to after I die.

175
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,564
You calm down and come back to me.

176
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,227
But you don't listen to me.

177
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,700
What do I do, father?

178
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,532
I feel very angry.

179
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,044
And I ask you to control your anger.

180
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,444
If the way you say
something is wrong"

181
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,379
Then what you say also becomes wrong.

182
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:56,144
An arrow once shot and a word
once spoken cannot be retrieved.

183
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,086
So you have forgiven him?

184
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,618
Surjeet,
you are the one who has spoilt.

185
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,757
You are right.

186
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,318
He has spoilt me.

187
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,192
Really? My Drama king,
I have spoilt you? - Yes.

188
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,426
I have spoilt you?

189
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,024
Wait, I will show you. - No.

190
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,693
I have told you not to tickle me.
- Wait, I will show you.

191
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,103
Stop it.

192
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,536
The love you two share
makes me very happy.

193
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,706
But it also makes me sad sometimes.

194
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,207
Why, father? What makes you sad?

195
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,676
Nachattar and I are
brothers after all.

196
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,345
We didn't realize when we grew apart.

197
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,356
Father's will changed everything.

198
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,222
Now I feel scared to
make a will for myself.

199
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,064
Father, find a lawyer
and make a will today itself.

200
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,734
You cannot tell them.

201
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,702
Uncle! - Come on.

202
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,364
Right, brother? - Come here, son.

203
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,032
Father, we two can
never have differences.

204
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,605
Transfer my share of land to Agam.

205
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,673
Do you love me more or Agam?

206
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,441
Hey"

207
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,973
Ekam.. do you want
the land or your uncle?

208
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,110
Uncle. - That's better.

209
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,510
Transfer it to Agam.

210
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,987
Jassa, there aren't
differences between brothers.

211
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,424
But when a female
enters the household"

212
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,552
...then the problems begin.

213
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,989
Brother, the one who could cause
problem for Jassa is yet to be born.

214
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,233
"Let's dance."

215
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,737
"Let's celebrate."

216
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,534
"Let's dance."

217
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,370
"Let's celebrate."

218
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,205
"I will dance."

219
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,678
"I will move like fire."

220
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,246
"I will dance."

221
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,444
"I will move like fire."

222
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,747
"I will dance."

223
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,613
"I will move like fire."

224
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,250
"When I dance, my anklets tinkle."

225
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,761
"I will dress up
and dance like a babe."

226
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:50,023
"I will dress up
and dance like a babe."

227
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,368
"There are nine doors to move around."

228
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,134
"And a ladder to run away."

229
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,030
"There are nine doors to move around."

230
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,635
"And a ladder to run away."

231
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,968
"I give you my heart,
hiding from my parents."

232
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,575
"Elope with Banto,
this won't be a theft."

233
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,210
"Elope with Banto,
this won't be a theft."

234
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,687
"Elope with Banto,
this won't be a theft."

235
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,492
"Listen to me, oh handsome young man."

236
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,327
"You are the one I love."

237
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,129
"Listen to me, oh handsome young man."

238
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,668
"You are the one I like."

239
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:29,001
"I feel like befriending you."

240
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,439
"I feel like befriending you."

241
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,668
"But I fear the world a lot."

242
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,108
"Oh young man of my age.."

243
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,339
"Oh, brave young man.."

244
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,777
"Oh young man of my age.."

245
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,208
"Oh, brave young man.."

246
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,114
"Oh young man of my age.."

247
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,748
Pali, my man! You should
have at least drunk some water.

248
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,620
You immediately started
eyeing the girls.

249
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,261
Brother, I have come
across many girls. - Yes.

250
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,135
But I swear, none of them
have been as deadly as her. - Okay.

251
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,062
She is so beautiful.

252
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,371
"Dance, girls."

253
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,601
Even if she were not beautiful,
we would have got you married to her.

254
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,609
Really?

255
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,406
What do you mean?

256
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,505
She is a Siddhu. Only child.

257
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,411
They have 60 acres of land.

258
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,218
Really? - Yes.

259
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,178
You know them?

260
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,483
Look at the one with
whom our father is standing.

261
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,559
He is her father.

262
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,322
Our father's friend.

263
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,494
Hello. - Hello, clear.

264
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,988
Let's go, Dara.

265
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,332
Introduce us, brother.

266
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,593
Yes.

267
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,194
Hello. - They are my sons.

268
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,698
<i>Pa“ and Dara.</i>

269
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,029
Hello.

270
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,539
Hello.

271
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,541
Daddy, we are going. - Have fun.

272
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,610
Let's go, Preet.

273
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,346
I knew Pali since
he was just small boy.

274
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,678
He has grown up to be
quite a young handsome man.

275
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,344
I will soon find
an excuse to meet you.

276
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,510
Now allow me to leave.

277
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,122
Let's go together.

278
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,454
Come.

279
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,427
Hey look, Rano is crying.

280
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,059
Rano, you should cry when
they are sending you away.

281
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,066
Jassi, I won't want to marry him.

282
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,361
Why not?

283
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,069
I love someone else.

284
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,406
Love? And you?

285
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,642
You are very secretive.

286
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,075
You never told us.

287
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,167
Fine, tell me who he is.

288
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,076
Hardeep.

289
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,380
Hardeep?

290
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,176
That nave boy in our tuitions?

291
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,377
Yes, I cannot live without him.

292
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,314
If you cannot live without
them then refuse to get married.

293
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,989
I can refuse,
but it will give me a bad name.

294
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,592
If you worry about a bad name today..

295
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,592
...then you will regret
this all your life.

296
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,994
Have you seen the wedding procession?

297
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,299
They are drunk and
shooting bullets non-stop.

298
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,236
Forget about these gunmen.

299
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,207
Jassi, listen to me.

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,570
Hello. Hello. 1,2,3. 1,2,3.

301
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,045
Yes..yes.

302
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,112
Yes, everyone, please pay attention.

303
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:58,211
Everyone is requested
to enjoy the meals thoroughly.

304
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,553
And drink as much liquor as they want.

305
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:02,957
There is nothing to worry about.

306
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,994
The dance program will begin soon.

307
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,088
But there is a slight
change in the wedding schedule.

308
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,958
Rano loves someone else.

309
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,166
Hence, this wedding cannot take place.

310
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,505
A joke.

311
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,406
Sister-in-law,
you shouldn't joke at such times.

312
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,071
It's not a joke, brother-in-law.

313
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,739
Brace your heart.
Your Rano is running away.

314
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,416
Hold this. Run, Rano!

315
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,420
Run, everyone. Rano! Rano!

316
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,159
Duck!

317
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,594
Let's go.

318
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,161
Duck!

319
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,402
Are you deaf, you idiot?

320
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,470
Duck!

321
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,165
Let's go, Rano.

322
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,608
Look what times have come, son.

323
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,382
A girl is running
away with another girl.

324
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,314
Do something.

325
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,552
Quickly do something.

326
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,384
Lie low, or I will end up killing you.

327
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,395
Duck!

328
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,420
Mother, first let's
save our own lives.

329
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,488
Back off.

330
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,491
Have you never seen a girl before?

331
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,051
Back off.
What are you doing over here?

332
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,089
You are getting yourself into
trouble while trying to save me.

333
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,191
Let's run. - They are following us.

334
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,435
I am dead. Jassa, I am dead.

335
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,998
I am doomed. - What happened?

336
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,603
Your future sister-in-law ran away.

337
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,615
Thank God,
she ran away now rather than later.

338
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,451
I don't understand, how anyone
agreed to let his daughter marry you.

339
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,451
Have you seen your face in the mirror?

340
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,350
You looked like you were slapped
by the midwife right after your birth.

341
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,617
By the way, who is the girl
my sister-in-law ran away with?

342
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,218
Jassi, from Saaru.

343
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,022
<i>Jassi.</i>

344
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,243
lam in Saaru. But I cannot see her.

345
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,653
Who are you?

346
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,052
How dare you step inside my fields?

347
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,527
I am no one but a pleader.

348
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,690
I have come here to plead.

349
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,327
I heard you unite lovers.

350
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,597
Do me as favor as well.

351
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,698
Yesterday, a girl hugged me in broad
daylight and stole my heart away.

352
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,711
I couldn't sleep at night.

353
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,203
I don't feel hungry or thirsty.

354
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,342
I am sure you too feel the same.

355
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,350
Stop your nonsense.

356
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,351
I will kill you.

357
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,217
If death is this beautiful
then I am ready to embrace it.

358
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,041
Let me put it in simple words.

359
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,378
I like you.

360
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,612
Now go and tell your family..

361
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,651
...to refuse anyone who approaches
them to get married to you.

362
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,117
Because I am the
one who will marry you.

363
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,187
Go and wash your face first.

364
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,199
I rather marry a dark
thief than marry you.

365
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,289
I will die single but
I will never marry you.

366
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,199
I have seen many
useless lovers like you.

367
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,668
I will kill you.

368
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,995
Mr. Brar, you lost your
way that you have come here.

369
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,340
No, Mr. Siddhu, it's not like that.

370
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,045
Farming keeps me busy.

371
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,780
The thing was such that..

372
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,341
...I had to specially
spare some time and come here.

373
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,441
I didn't get you.

374
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:34,012
We are here to seek your daughter's
hand in marriage for Pali.

375
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,717
What can be better than that?

376
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,621
I got such a nice match for
my daughter without making any effort.

377
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,461
Please don't mind but I
have brought up Jassi like a son.

378
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,034
I cannot give my
consent until I ask her.

379
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,631
Look, <i>Jassi is</i> here.

380
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,145
Hello. - Hello, clear.

381
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,380
Hello.

382
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,312
God bless you, dear.

383
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,383
Hello.

384
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,179
Brother, now allow us to leave.

385
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,515
Think about it and let us know.

386
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,215
Okay.

387
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,120
Bye. - Bye.

388
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:08,748
Let's go.

389
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,981
Bye. - Let's go, Pali.

390
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,422
Dear, if your mother were with us, she
would have spoken to you about this.

391
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,433
<i>Nachattar wants to you
and Pa“ to get married.</i>

392
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,593
What do you say?

393
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,098
As you wish, daddy.

394
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,705
"She is arrogant about her beauty."

395
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,014
"I had to meet her. I felt helpless."

396
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,020
"I had to meet her. "

397
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:52,424
"Each style of yours, made me crazy.."

398
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,042
You?

399
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,970
Why did I take the
trouble of going to place?

400
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,612
You came here,
at your in-laws' house, on your own.

401
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,983
Don't you think you
are a tad too eager?

402
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,416
I had a desire to
dance at our wedding.

403
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,717
Oh God.

404
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,992
If you really wish to dance
then you can dance at my wedding.

405
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,686
I am marrying your cousin.

406
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,095
Now with your broken heart
you will peep into that house.

407
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,656
I came here to inform you.

408
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,763
There are three single
men in that house.

409
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,562
I am destined to
kill all three of them.

410
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,732
Which one are you getting married to?

411
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,631
Tell me.

412
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,509
I will spare his life.

413
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,502
Goon.

414
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,016
Not a goon, a lover.

415
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:50,459
"The separation has ruined me."

416
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:56,360
"Oh wretched one,
I am on the streets."

417
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:02,166
"Oh wretched one,
you will go to lower world."

418
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,533
"My life is destroyed.."

419
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,700
When your husband won't be able
help you, this lover of yours will.

420
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,476
You can test me.

421
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,607
"May you be doomed."

422
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,652
Not even my sandal will approach you.

423
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,213
Jassa, who is she?

424
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,091
<i>Jassi.</i>

425
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,992
Answer it.

426
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,294
Why? What's wrong with you?

427
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,193
Hello?

428
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,567
Hello? Is that Pali?

429
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:35,728
Who is on the line?

430
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,406
<i>R's me, Jassi. You are Pa“, fight?</i>

431
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,340
<i>P a“?</i>

432
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,134
This is the first time someone
has said my name so politely.

433
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,338
Pali..

434
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,138
Pali, I don't have much time.

435
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,204
I really have to meet you.

436
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,339
When do you wish to meet?

437
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,440
Right away.

438
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,247
Tell me, where can you meet me?

439
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,221
There is a brick factory nearby.
Meet me there.

440
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,359
Factory?

441
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,963
This matter seems scorching hot.

442
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,467
What is it, brother?
You are all smiles.

443
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,193
Don't ask, Banta.

444
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,498
The players wishes
to raid before the match.

445
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,266
Then go for the cut.

446
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,206
But watch your steps.

447
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,403
Or the raider might
take you to the other side.

448
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,323
"Don't apply kohl in your eyes.
- Why so?"

449
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,692
"Don't deck up so much.
- Why so?"

450
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,124
"Don't go alone anywhere."

451
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,428
"People gossip."

452
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,666
"Agree to marry me,
or someone might make a claim on you."

453
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,996
"Agree to marry me,
or someone might make a claim on you."

454
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,011
Okay, so I am ready.

455
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,676
Come on, now.

456
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,214
You are here.

457
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,714
Of course, I had to come to meet you.

458
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,419
You are here, but now I'll send
you only when I want you to leave.

459
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,547
Fine. But make me a promise first.

460
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,059
You won't say no to me.

461
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,557
How can I refuse you
when it comes to this?

462
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,597
Great.

463
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,394
You know why I wanted to meet you?

464
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,957
I have an idea.

465
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,994
Why don't you enlighten me?

466
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,473
Rano..

467
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,077
She too came with you?

468
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,079
I called you here because of her.

469
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,539
Wait a minute.

470
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,277
She is the same girl
who ran from her wedding.

471
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,582
Yes, the one she ran
away for has refused..

472
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,519
...to introduce her to his family.

473
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:33,487
Okay.

474
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,219
So you want me to convince
that boy and his family? - Yes.

475
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,691
Have you lost your mind, Jassi?

476
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,319
What are you getting yourself into?

477
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,562
What do we have to do with this girl?

478
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,758
Get this straight, Jassi.

479
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,729
You are the future daughter-in-law
of the Brar family.

480
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,336
And I won't tolerate my future
wife wandering around like this.

481
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:51,570
Got it?

482
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,008
Don't you dare step out of the
house again for such stupid things!

483
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,702
She said, "Pali, come and meet me."

484
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,338
"I have an important work with you."

485
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,053
Jassi, what will we do now?

486
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,722
'When your husband won't be able
help you, this lover of yours will.'

487
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,183
Let go of me, brother.

488
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,957
Let's sit and talk.
Don't do this.

489
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,592
Listen" at least listen to me.

490
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,694
Brother, the entire college is..

491
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,305
Do you know her?

492
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,536
Yes.

493
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,172
Look at yourself.

494
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,318
You should feel ashamed of yourself.

495
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,977
Our elders have always
respected women.

496
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,023
And you make fun of them.

497
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:45,423
Find a beautiful girl,
follow her for a few days.

498
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,723
Say a few lies and cajole
her to brag about it to your friends.

499
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,999
Is this your definition of love?

500
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:58,433
Once you hold someone's hand, even if
you have to die, never let go of it.

501
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,440
That's the definition of love.

502
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,206
You let it be.
You are no less.

503
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,650
Anyone who follows you
on his bike a number of times..

504
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,347
You happily agree to sit
on the backseat of the bike.

505
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,017
And then you hit the brakes
when you say I love you.

506
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,458
Unfortunately, those who don't
value love are the ones who get love.

507
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:40,048
"I am engulfed in my beloved's love."

508
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:47,047
"I see God in this love."

509
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:55,062
"Love is a color of the Almighty."

510
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,065
"I am engulfed in my beloved's love."

511
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,660
"Love is a color of the Almighty."

512
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,332
"I am engulfed in my beloved's love."

513
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:10,243
"When I saw my handsome beloved.."

514
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:18,210
"When I saw my handsome beloved.."

515
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,787
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

516
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,317
"I fell in love."

517
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,730
"I feel a lot of love."

518
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,125
"I fell in love."

519
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,726
"I feel a lot of love."

520
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,030
"I fell in love."

521
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,371
"I feel a lot of love."

522
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:46,379
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

523
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,748
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

524
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,751
"I pray for our happiness."

525
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,588
"I pray to the sages."

526
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,391
"I pray for our happiness."
"I pray to the sages."

527
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,592
"I tie a thread in his name."

528
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:26,044
"God has gifted me this happiness."

529
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:31,556
"God has made me forget all sorrows."

530
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:37,363
"God has gifted me this happiness."

531
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:42,568
"God has made me forget all sorrows."

532
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,269
"I am so happy that
I cannot contain it."

533
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:54,373
"God has lightened up our path."

534
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,753
"How beautiful.."

535
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:06,023
"How beautiful my world is now."

536
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:11,096
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

537
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:17,105
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

538
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:22,342
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

539
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:28,108
"The one who earned
love.. had found God."

540
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,049
"The one who earned
love.. had found God."

541
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:37,788
"The one who convinced
the beloved has convinced God."

542
00:33:55,566 --> 00:34:00,982
"I prayed everywhere I could."

543
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:06,551
"God, now that you have given me love,
also give me a long life."

544
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:17,998
"I prayed everywhere I could."

545
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,338
"God, now that you have given me love,
also give me a long life."

546
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:29,101
"I have a request,
always stand by me."

547
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:35,011
"My soul is now united to yours."

548
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,650
"Now I trust love.."

549
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:47,027
"Now I trust love a lot."

550
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:52,132
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

551
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:58,433
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

552
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:03,469
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

553
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:09,481
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

554
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:15,117
"Oh God, I truly fell in love."

555
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,524
Now never let your
Jassi go away from you.

556
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,123
Jassa know how to be true
to his love and his enemies.

557
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,329
I misunderstood and said yes for Pali.

558
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,995
Don't worry.

559
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:36,603
I will clear your misunderstanding.

560
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,014
You must be wondering
what I am doing here.

561
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,312
You have a right to wonder.

562
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,049
One shouldn't go
where one is not loved.

563
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,783
Stop making up stories.

564
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,349
Come to the point.

565
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,126
Why have you come here?

566
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:57,331
To put it in simple words,
Pali, God made us enemies.

567
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,467
The girl you are
betrothed to loves me.

568
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,997
I too love her and that
too from the bottom of my heart.

569
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,210
At first,
we were only fighting for the land.

570
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,975
Now there is also a woman involved.

571
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,173
Now we will have fun.

572
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,118
Now you'll see the real enmity.

573
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,318
Don't test my patience, Jassa.

574
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:28,495
You are standing in my house,
and hence you are still alive.

575
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,495
Get lost.

576
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,094
Otherwise, people will say
that I killed the enemy who came home.

577
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,502
I too don't love to squabble.

578
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,004
Don't keep an eye on Jassi.

579
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,671
You are a player.

580
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,779
You will get many.

581
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:03,192
"The fire already burning
wasn't extinguished."

582
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:09,402
"To make matters worse,
another storm approached."

583
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:15,669
"Anyone who eyed Mirza's Saiba.."

584
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:21,183
"..is sure to die, even if he is God."

585
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:25,082
"He is sure to die."

586
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,993
Father, I was going to the city.

587
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,189
Do you want something?

588
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,995
It gets cold in the
mornings and evenings.

589
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,092
Get a shawl for me.

590
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,998
I will get it.

591
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,001
Also, give this for
stitching for Jassa.

592
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,539
Okay, I will.

593
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,764
But where is your
beloved brother-in-law?

594
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,033
He still didn't wake up?

595
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,442
The sun has just risen.

596
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,104
He will wake up when it is on the top.

597
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,744
You have spoilt him.

598
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,209
Give him a responsibility.

599
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,645
I won't live forever, son.

600
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,090
Father, these are the
days for him to have some fun.

601
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,053
Let him.

602
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,158
Jassa!

603
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:04,955
Jassa!

604
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:05,993
What happened?

605
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,052
Do you want something from the market?

606
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,066
I have asked Shanty to tape
two cassettes with Manik's songs.

607
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,058
Pick those up. - Sure.

608
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,728
He doesn't work.

609
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,597
He keeps listening
to songs all night long.

610
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,369
And keeps riding
the bike during the day.

611
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,067
Fine, do as you please.

612
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,169
Let's go, father.
- Useless. He won't change his ways.

613
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,543
Father should have
been a leader or something.

614
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,707
He is good at giving lectures.

615
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,321
Dara..

616
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,431
...you have once again
changed the route of the canal.

617
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,000
It was our turn to get the water.

618
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,730
You must be keeping the tabs on turns,
not us, uncle.

619
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,494
I am not as educated as you.

620
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,230
Both of you should mend your ways.

621
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,535
Why are you getting into trouble,
old man.

622
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,439
Don't make me kill an aged.

623
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,238
Leave.

624
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,244
Pali, I've played with
you when you were a child.

625
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,413
Have some shame.

626
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,713
Old man, don't try
to rekindle old relations.

627
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:06,281
If you really want some action,
send your sons here.

628
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,584
You don't have to
courage to face my sons.

629
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,153
Stay within your limits.

630
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,056
Should I show you my courage?

631
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,686
Come on! - Help!

632
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,995
Your Jassa wants
to marry my betrothed.

633
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:25,407
What kind of kids have
you given birth to, old man?

634
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,074
Help!

635
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,548
Sllrjeet!

636
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,279
Sllrjeet!

637
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,681
Jassa!

638
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,657
Jassa!

639
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:20,756
"The child I played with.."

640
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:26,798
"The child I played
with when he was a child."

641
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:32,633
"Look at Lord's atrocity, today
he has come here as my murderer."

642
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:39,081
"Baba Nanak has said so in his Bani."

643
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,183
"There was so much slaughter
that the people screamed.."

644
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:45,081
"Didn't You feel the pain, Lord?"

645
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,380
"There was so much slaughter
that the people screamed.."

646
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,483
"Didn't You feel the pain, Lord?"

647
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:56,691
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

648
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:02,595
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

649
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,117
What is wrong with you?

650
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,335
Father..

651
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,267
Father..

652
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,604
Father..

653
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,741
Father..

654
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:42,102
"The fire of revenge intensified,
the world bore witness."

655
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:48,105
"Now it's time to kill the murderer."

656
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:54,254
"You prove your status
either by dying or killing."

657
00:46:54,444 --> 00:47:00,053
"Such people are never
born into this world again."

658
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,635
Jassa!

659
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:16,973
Jassa!

660
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,504
I killed Pali.

661
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,979
Now I have to kill Dara.

662
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,609
Now you won't kill anyone.

663
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,280
I killed Pali. - Police is after you.

664
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,721
I killed Pali.

665
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,981
I have to kill Dara.

666
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,088
I killed Pali.
- What's wrong with you, my brother?

667
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:35,993
What's wrong with you?

668
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,089
I have to kill Dara.

669
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,428
Our father is dead.

670
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,003
Cry a little, my brother.

671
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,231
You will feel lighter.

672
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,000
I killed Pali.

673
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,199
I have to kill Dara.

674
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,610
We are all alone now.
We are all alone.

675
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,510
We have lost our father.

676
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,345
Cry a little, my brother.

677
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,681
Cry a little.

678
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,056
Jassa!

679
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:15,401
Oh God! What do I do now?

680
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:23,711
I don't want you to spend
the rest of your life behind bars.

681
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,539
Heed my advice and leave this country.

682
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,017
Leave this country.

683
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,979
Jassa, you have never said no to me.

684
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,755
Heed my advice.

685
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,185
Heed my advice, my brother.

686
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,993
Leave this country.

687
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,695
My brave son died young.

688
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,142
May you be doomed.

689
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,687
So inspector, what brings you here?

690
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,561
Why does police come
at such an occasion?

691
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,056
We are here to investigate.

692
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:16,722
Call everyone here.

693
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,096
May you rot in lower world, you idiot.

694
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,395
Our enemies have killed my young son.

695
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:24,995
And you are here to investigate?

696
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:28,006
May you be doomed. Get lost from here.
- Calm down, mother.

697
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,966
Listen to me.
- May our enemies rot in lower world.

698
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,469
Look inspector,
it's very simple and straightforward.

699
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,311
Pali killed our uncle
and Jassa killed Pali.

700
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,747
Now what brings you here?

701
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,178
Dara, nothing stays
hidden from the police.

702
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:42,213
According to the post-mortem report,
Pavitra was killed by two people.

703
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,987
Pali is dead and I am here
to take the second person with me.

704
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,525
It's well and go if
he agrees to come with me..

705
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,331
Otherwise,
I know whom I have to take with me.

706
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,201
Hold on, inspector.

707
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,338
You need a person, right?

708
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,011
I will come with you.

709
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,577
I confess that Pali
and I killed Pavitra.

710
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,749
We were not in the village,
otherwise along with Pavitra..

711
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,581
...we would have also
performed Jassa's last rites.

712
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,125
Fine then, come outside.

713
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,795
Dara, remember just one thing.

714
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:29,664
That Nachattar Singh Brar isn't going
to prison because he loves his son.

715
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,029
He is going to get rid of his enemies.

716
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,033
Now come to meet me
in the prison only when..

717
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,039
...you bring the news of Jassa's death.

718
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:55,188
Jassa, you are leaving us,
but you will always stay in our heart.

719
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:59,497
We will call you back
when everything settles down.

720
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,094
You are under my oath, Jassa.

721
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,573
You won't come back
unless I ask you to.

722
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,111
May God always be with you.

723
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,140
Uncle..

724
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,019
Uncle..

725
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,219
Uncle, I cannot live without you.

726
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,420
Take me with you.

727
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,021
Father, ask him to take me along.

728
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:32,261
Jassa, he won't be
able to live without you.

729
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:33,366
Take him along.

730
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,528
Mother, I don't want to stay here.
I want to go with uncle.

731
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,128
Please let me go.

732
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:42,037
Sister-in-law,
tell Jassi that I will be back soon.

733
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,368
Ask her to wait for me.

734
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:50,248
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

735
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:56,481
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

736
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:03,198
"The relations surviving
the fire revenge are very fragile."

737
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:09,327
"Once a beautiful courtyard
turns into ruins."

738
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:15,500
"These flames make
all the faces blur."

739
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:21,105
"The heart weeps from within.
The screams go unheard."

740
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:27,018
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

741
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:33,251
"Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord."

742
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:40,263
"The fields which were
once lush green with harvest."

743
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:46,137
"Those fields now lay barren."

744
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:52,380
"The piece of land because
of which the sons laid their lives.."

745
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:58,052
"The same land now lays barren,
and hollers its owner."

746
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,478
'Run and wherever you want to.'

747
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,746
'This reciprocation
that you have begun..'

748
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,619
'..now Dara will pay
you back with interest.'

749
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,238
Hello, sister-in-law.

750
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,037
Jassa? Have you reached?

751
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:23,338
How is Ekam?

752
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,503
Ekam is fine.

753
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:25,569
How is brother doing?

754
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,616
He was waiting for your call.
He just left for the fields.

755
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,684
Fine, I will call later.

756
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,714
Sister-in-law,
did you give my message to Jassi?

757
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:45,793
Jassa, I don't know how
do I tell you about this?

758
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,239
Jassa, Jassi is no more.

759
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:53,463
What?

760
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:58,174
She couldn't bear the shock of
your departure and she killed herself.

761
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,035
Hello?

762
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:00,741
Hello?

763
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,211
Jassa, are you listening to me?

764
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,717
Hello?

765
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:13,387
"Oh my Lord!"

766
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:57,471
'Lord Almighty. Victory to the Lord.'

767
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:04,670
"May my hope be fulfilled."

768
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:11,408
"May my hope be fulfilled."

769
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:17,617
"The thirst for repeating your name
continues to exist."

770
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:24,721
"The thirst for repeating your name
continues to exist."

771
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,993
"May my hope be fulfilled."

772
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,739
'May the Sikhs be humble in
mind and exalted in understanding.'

773
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,408
'The Almighty endows
these virtues on them.'

774
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:41,110
'Almighty,
I left my house many years ago.'

775
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,311
'End this exile, my Lord.'

776
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,344
'Before I get tired and give up.'

777
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,650
'Today Agam is getting
married in the village.'

778
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,587
'After a long time, happiness
has entered that house, Lord.'

779
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,227
'Keep my family away from
all kinds of trouble, Almighty.'

780
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,160
'Have mercy, Almighty.'

781
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:07,465
"Ward off the evil,
the mother of the groom."

782
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,000
"The bride and the groom
are standing outside."

783
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:16,608
"Ward off the evil,
the mother of the groom."

784
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:20,314
"The bride and the groom
are standing outside."

785
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:25,985
"The bride has brought
happiness with her."

786
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:29,427
"The bride and the groom
are standing outside."

787
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:35,332
"The bride has brought
happiness with her."

788
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,998
"The bride and the groom
are standing outside."

789
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,440
So? What are you looking at?

790
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,147
I have seen many twins, Agam.

791
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,444
But you two look just the same.

792
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,015
Because twins are
usually two individuals.

793
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,019
But Agam and Ekam are one.

794
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,113
My darling brother.

795
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,653
We are going to England
for our honeymoon.

796
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,690
To be with him.

797
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:08,993
Can I say something, Agam?

798
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,368
I cannot believe that I am so lucky.

799
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,966
It was love at first sight for me.

800
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:19,312
But I didn't know that
I would see this day so soon.

801
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,279
If you go away from even for a day..

802
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,217
...I will complain to
God right then and there.

803
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,115
You know I have a special
connection with Him.

804
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,549
I won't give you a chance to complain.

805
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,524
Just make a small request to Him.

806
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,593
Tomorrow the verdict
on the land will be made.

807
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,429
It should be in our favor.

808
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:38,022
You don't worry about that.

809
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,658
You go to the court
and I will go and meet Him.

810
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,435
Consider that you have
already won the case.

811
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,096
Oh really, fatso?
- Don't call me fatso.

812
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,441
Uncle, I really wanted
to attend Agam's wedding.

813
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,013
You cancelled the program
at the last moment.

814
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,706
Only your father can tell you why.

815
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:57,347
It's okay.

816
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,353
Rukhi and Agam are coming here.
You can fulfill all your desires then.

817
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,455
And son,
now you too should get married.

818
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,526
Uncle, one needs to
have a girl to get married.

819
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,493
And I don't have one. - Really?

820
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:18,595
Who was that girl?

821
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,503
Which girl?

822
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,466
The one who was clicking photographs.

823
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,510
Oh, her?

824
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,668
We like each other.

825
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,174
Hey, you just said there
is no girl in your life.

826
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,208
She isn't in my life.
She is still outside.

827
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,116
And I am scared of father.

828
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:36,588
Son, you shouldn't bother
about anyone if your love is true.

829
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,683
I will talk to your father.
You have fun.

830
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,425
"What does the queen of trouble want,
I don't know."

831
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,998
"When baby will cause trouble,
you never know."

832
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,330
"Your look is like
that of Angelina Jolie."

833
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,391
"Why are you getting us hanged,
baby, let it be."

834
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,665
"In high heels, you look tall."

835
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,333
"In a short shirt you look wonderful."

836
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,672
"You cause bloodshed in the city."

837
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,110
"Your gait is killer."

838
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,477
"In high heels, you look tall."

839
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,949
"In a short shirt you look wonderful."

840
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,349
"You cause bloodshed in the city."

841
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,377
"Your gait is killer."

842
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,946
"You will cause never ending cases."

843
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,992
"You will cause never ending cases."

844
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,688
"Oh the trouble you cause."

845
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,953
"You will cause a riot in the city."

846
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,533
"Oh the trouble you cause."

847
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,624
"Nice boys fight with each other."

848
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,967
"Oh the trouble you cause."

849
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,404
"Oh the trouble.."

850
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,312
You have a body which is lean."

851
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,406
"Tell me what is your scene."

852
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,282
"Let's go on a ride on a Harley."

853
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,482
"You kiss some and you hug some."

854
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:44,184
"Come with me to a side too."

855
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,419
"What do you want to join?"

856
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:46,551
"Your red face shines."

857
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:49,028
"You keep a control on your diet."

858
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,190
"You are fit.
Among boys, you are a hit."

859
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,528
"They keep looking
for you on Google site."

860
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,763
"Your attitude has killed many."

861
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:57,994
"Your attitude has killed many."

862
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,996
"Oh the trouble you cause."

863
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,704
"You will cause a riot in the city."

864
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,609
"Oh the trouble you cause."

865
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,670
"Nice boys fight with each other."

866
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,013
"Oh the trouble you cause."

867
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,746
"Oh the trouble.."

868
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,220
Last night's party was great fun.
I had a great time.

869
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,560
Stop.

870
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,731
Hi, uncle darling.
Okay, see you on next Saturday.

871
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:31,461
Good morning, uncle.

872
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,336
Good morning? You said
you would come yesterday evening.

873
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,339
And you are showing
your face to me now?

874
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,638
Did you go to the Gurudwara?

875
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:37,473
Uncle, to meet you
is like meeting God.

876
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,739
I have paid my respect to you.

877
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:45,610
You've learnt to say these
things only because of your uncle.

878
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:49,815
Brother has been very strict with Agam.
He never says anything unnecessary.

879
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,717
Come on, uncle.
That's the reason I changed the group.

880
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:56,195
Once Agam is here,
we will have many parties.

881
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,822
You better not stop us.

882
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:00,432
Don't spoil him.
He is a nice boy.

883
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,339
Thanks, Osama.

884
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,014
Come, let's go.

885
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,113
Uncle, they.. - What were you saying?

886
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,159
Go back to your country, Osama.

887
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,168
Okay.

888
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,437
He's not Osama. He's a Sikh.

889
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,636
Come on, you want to mess with him?

890
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,578
Show Osama not to mess with us.

891
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,340
Come on, you want to mess with us, eh?

892
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:55,712
Ekam!

893
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,422
Go back to your country.

894
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:03,997
Ekam!

895
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,502
Ekam!

896
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,637
"For one who has lost his honor.."

897
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,510
"Even eating food is sinful."

898
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,413
"For one who has lost his honor.."

899
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,213
"Even eating food is sinful."

900
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,007
"For one who has lost his honor.."

901
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,783
"Even eating food is sinful."

902
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,546
"For one who has lost his honor.."

903
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,218
"Even eating food is sinful."

904
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,361
"For one who has lost
his honor.." - Fight back.

905
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,227
You want to know what is a Sikh?

906
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,362
One who does not frighten anyone..
And who is not afraid of anyone else.

907
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:47,135
Says Nanak, listen,
oh mind: call him spiritually wise.

908
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,645
He who doesn't scare anyone.

909
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,242
He is a Sikh.

910
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,144
One who isn't scared of anyone.

911
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,683
That is a Sikh.

912
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,520
Next time don't mess with
anyone when a Sikh is around.

913
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:20,437
Are you all right?

914
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,007
Yes, uncle, I am fine.

915
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,611
Uncle, I had forgotten
what terror Jassa can cause.

916
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:27,311
Today you reminded me of Jassa,
the villager.

917
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:52,597
Sir, your family has a
special interest on this land.

918
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:58,035
Bhinda, I have paid
a hefty price for this land.

919
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,072
I have lost many precious
things in this land.

920
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:05,415
I won't rest in peace
until I cultivate on it.

921
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:10,284
Now there is only the verdict of court
that stands between this land and me.

922
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:14,551
'Keeping all the witness accounts in
mind the court has come to a verdict..'

923
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,426
...that the land which
Agam Brar's grandfather"

924
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,092
<i>...P avitra Singh Br a: son oi Dhyan
Singh Brat had given to his grandson"</i>

925
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:23,103
<i>“Agam Bra: son oi
Sufieet Singh Brat ..</i>

926
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:27,005
...Dara Singh Brar or his
brothers have no right over it.

927
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,536
The real owner of
the land is Agam Brar.

928
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,640
Hence, section 145
is lifted from this land.

929
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,686
The land's owner can cultivate
on this land, as he wants.

930
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,656
Sir, should I begin?

931
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,600
I won't let go of this land.

932
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:02,675
Court cannot resolve such matters.

933
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,078
Now I will have to take
the matter in my own hands.

934
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,176
"You now belong to me."

935
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,311
"You should walk with pride."

936
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,117
Rukhi, we won the case.

937
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:18,521
I had told you.
God always listens to me.

938
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,491
Thank you, God.

939
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:22,427
Hence forth, I will ask you to
make all the requests for me, fatso.

940
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,498
I will go and give this good
news to mom and dad right away.

941
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,430
No, Rukhi. Don't say anything to them.

942
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,332
I will come and tell them..

943
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,104
Again!

944
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,435
Hello? Hello? Say something, Agam.

945
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:40,446
Agam! Why don't you say something?

946
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,347
Say something, Agam.

947
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:48,719
Agam! Why don't you say something?
- "Blood has turned against each other."

948
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,551
"What caused this?"

949
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,219
Again!

950
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:07,158
"The young son died.
The apple of his father's eyes."

951
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,516
"One bullet caused a disaster."

952
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,746
"it made the heart bleed."

953
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:26,684
"The blood boils as
the enemy challenges."

954
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,091
Jassa still didn't come.

955
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,126
I think they didn't tell him.

956
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,496
Otherwise,
he would have come out of his burrow.

957
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,233
He hasn't come as yet.
But he will surely come.

958
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:48,443
I too feel sorry for your dead, Agam.

959
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,609
It wasn't your fault.

960
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,715
It was only your uncle's fault.

961
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,458
Jassa, till we don't
come face to face..

962
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,718
...neither of us are going to win.

963
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,094
Now I am one up.

964
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,196
You will have to come.

965
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,311
Good morning, Mr. Singh.

966
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,483
Hi, John.
Good morning.

967
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,339
Hello? - Hello.

968
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,677
I have been calling since yesterday.
You didn't answer my calls.

969
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,775
Have they left the airport
or have they called the program?

970
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,706
If he is close by
then make him talk to me.

971
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,012
I will teach him a lesson.

972
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,015
Jassa, listen to me.

973
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:05,583
The one you are waiting
for has left us forever.

974
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,359
We couldn't do anything.

975
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:12,625
Time changes so quickly, Balwant.

976
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:17,061
A few days a wedding took
place in this house. There was music.

977
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,155
There was so much happiness,
everywhere.

978
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,266
And look at it now?

979
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,100
The same house is mourning.

980
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,606
God, You are strange.

981
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,535
Hold on.

982
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,979
Let's go and give our
condolences to our brother.

983
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,191
Hello, brother Surjeet.

984
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,691
Only God knows what God does.

985
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,557
One becomes careless
and the other loses his life.

986
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:56,430
The bird dies and the hawk enjoys.

987
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,433
The tractor driver couldn't find anyone
else to kill other than our Agam?

988
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,565
I will..

989
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,407
We have differences.

990
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,006
But he was a part of our family.

991
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,444
I thought I should
give you my condolences.

992
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,746
Even strangers come and
meet at the time of sorrow.

993
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,120
Jassa didn't come?

994
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,524
No? Let me know if he comes, okay.

995
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,023
I'll let you know.

996
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,222
Jassa left from here.

997
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:28,032
You forgot how it was when
Jassa used to be here, Dara?

998
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,330
Be grateful that
he isn't in the village.

999
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,737
Be patient.

1000
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,244
I too shall see how
patient can you be.

1001
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,043
You will call for your
brother Jassa eventually.

1002
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,998
Stop over here.

1003
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,337
My ears were yearning
to listen to this noise.

1004
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:33,451
The story that was left
incomplete 10 years ago"

1005
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,584
Now it's time to complete it.

1006
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,122
Jassa is back.

1007
01:14:16,055 --> 01:14:22,404
"He returns a stranger after ages."

1008
01:14:24,463 --> 01:14:30,573
"He tries to recall his old house."

1009
01:14:31,303 --> 01:14:36,303
"He wonders where all
the happiness has disappeared."

1010
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:46,981
"The souls which were once
your friends are there no more."

1011
01:14:55,627 --> 01:15:00,627
"No one knows what this
heart has been through."

1012
01:15:08,107 --> 01:15:14,353
"No one knows what this
heart has been through."

1013
01:15:14,413 --> 01:15:20,489
"No one knows what this
heart has been through."

1014
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:35,008
Jassa?

1015
01:15:36,235 --> 01:15:40,650
I have seen this many a times in life
that all happiness has a shelf life.

1016
01:15:41,507 --> 01:15:45,614
But such a big happiness in
our life had such a small shelf life?

1017
01:15:46,445 --> 01:15:48,550
We cannot go against God's will.

1018
01:15:49,314 --> 01:15:51,294
Calm down, brother.

1019
01:15:51,984 --> 01:15:53,691
No, Jassa. Don't stop me now.

1020
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:59,400
I have been waiting
for my brother to come..

1021
01:16:00,225 --> 01:16:03,468
So that I can hug him and
cry my heart out. - No, brother.

1022
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:05,701
Enough.

1023
01:16:06,231 --> 01:16:07,073
Enough, brother.

1024
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:09,975
Enough.

1025
01:16:21,613 --> 01:16:25,686
Look mother,
they are having a prayer meet.

1026
01:16:27,686 --> 01:16:29,461
Are you still angry with us?

1027
01:16:30,322 --> 01:16:32,165
Now are your children worthy enough?

1028
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:35,298
You kept on screaming
at us unnecessarily.

1029
01:16:37,529 --> 01:16:41,568
Your son knows how to
strike at the right time.

1030
01:16:44,336 --> 01:16:47,579
Yes, sir. I agree.

1031
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:50,118
You will have to.

1032
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:51,483
Look over there.

1033
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:56,987
I had told you,
even if Jassa is hiding in lower world..

1034
01:16:57,483 --> 01:16:59,360
...Dara would make him come out.

1035
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,596
I have never suspected you,
sir, I swear.

1036
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:06,931
But what will we do with him?

1037
01:17:07,626 --> 01:17:12,700
You just wait and
watch what game I play.

1038
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:16,975
Now see how the lightening strikes.

1039
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,046
Zorawar.

1040
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,350
<i>Mr. Brat, R you perm“ me...</i>

1041
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:29,383
...I'd like to take Rukhi
with me for a few days.

1042
01:17:31,049 --> 01:17:32,619
She will feel lighter.

1043
01:17:37,723 --> 01:17:39,532
Whatever you think is right.

1044
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:20,376
Uncle, why is everyone crying?

1045
01:18:22,968 --> 01:18:24,038
Because they are sad.

1046
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:26,307
Then should we too be crying?

1047
01:18:29,975 --> 01:18:33,320
No. We become happy
when they are sad.

1048
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,654
Anyway, a person dies one day.

1049
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:41,087
But they leave their land behind.

1050
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:44,665
It is our job to take
care of the land, son.

1051
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:47,301
You too should grow up quickly.

1052
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:49,600
You have to cultivate
on our enemy's land.

1053
01:19:11,216 --> 01:19:14,095
This isn't a good
reason to return, Jassa.

1054
01:19:15,153 --> 01:19:17,292
But it's good that you are back.

1055
01:19:17,556 --> 01:19:19,194
Now don't go back.

1056
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:23,698
Half the village saw who killed Pali.

1057
01:19:24,463 --> 01:19:26,374
But no one testified.

1058
01:19:28,533 --> 01:19:29,705
Do you know why?

1059
01:19:30,435 --> 01:19:32,278
Because I asked them not to.

1060
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:38,678
I thought it's a personal matter.
Why should we drag it to court?

1061
01:19:39,411 --> 01:19:40,617
We will settle it between us.

1062
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,182
And that too soon.

1063
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:46,418
AlmightY-

1064
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,964
Father..

1065
01:20:03,068 --> 01:20:05,275
Here father, have some sweets.

1066
01:20:06,071 --> 01:20:07,311
Jassa is back.

1067
01:20:10,409 --> 01:20:11,149
Really?

1068
01:20:16,348 --> 01:20:18,157
Don't you feel ashamed to say that?

1069
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:22,291
Spineless man,
where is your pride dead?

1070
01:20:23,922 --> 01:20:27,961
How could you forget
your brother Pali's screams?

1071
01:20:28,593 --> 01:20:32,939
How could you forget
how Jassa killed him?

1072
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:37,078
I'm in this prison"

1073
01:20:38,103 --> 01:20:41,482
...so that the fire of
revenge stays lit within you.

1074
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:47,980
Your fire of revenge should
extinguish only after Jassa's death.

1075
01:20:49,381 --> 01:20:52,487
I want Jassa's blood, Dara.

1076
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:54,528
I want Jassa's blood.

1077
01:20:54,986 --> 01:20:59,401
Father, Jassa is back.
But I won't let him go back.

1078
01:21:00,258 --> 01:21:04,297
Now the day you hear drums
beating at the prison gate"

1079
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,440
...you will know that
Jassa has been taken care of.

1080
01:21:37,462 --> 01:21:43,174
"It doesn't listen to God.
It doesn't listen to the world."

1081
01:21:43,235 --> 01:21:48,207
"it chooses the path of my beloved."

1082
01:21:48,273 --> 01:21:57,057
"I spend the nights
dreaming about her."

1083
01:21:57,249 --> 01:22:02,426
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1084
01:22:02,487 --> 01:22:07,903
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1085
01:22:08,527 --> 01:22:13,670
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1086
01:22:13,899 --> 01:22:19,247
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1087
01:22:19,304 --> 01:22:25,220
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1088
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:31,317
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1089
01:22:57,709 --> 01:23:03,523
"My heart is vacant,
it waits for her."

1090
01:23:03,615 --> 01:23:06,289
"It's over but it
couldn't be erased.."

1091
01:23:06,351 --> 01:23:09,355
"Her being a part of my destiny."

1092
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:20,608
"My heart is vacant,
it waits for her."

1093
01:23:20,665 --> 01:23:23,373
"It's over but it
couldn't be erased.."

1094
01:23:23,435 --> 01:23:26,575
"Her being a part of my destiny."

1095
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:35,056
"She is the first word
and the last I will say too."

1096
01:23:35,113 --> 01:23:40,290
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1097
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:45,461
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1098
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:51,498
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1099
01:23:51,563 --> 01:23:57,514
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1100
01:23:57,569 --> 01:24:03,076
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1101
01:24:03,141 --> 01:24:09,387
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1102
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:41,352
"Whenever this heart desired
wasn't given to me by those sages."

1103
01:24:41,413 --> 01:24:47,227
"We really didn't want
to but destiny separated us."

1104
01:24:53,124 --> 01:24:58,472
"Whenever this heart desired
wasn't given to me by those sages."

1105
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:04,203
"We really didn't want
to but destiny separated us."

1106
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:12,051
"The prayer broke before
it could reach God."

1107
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:17,985
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1108
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:23,396
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1109
01:25:24,322 --> 01:25:29,396
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1110
01:25:29,461 --> 01:25:35,434
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1111
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:40,711
"My heart is a disbeliever,
it doesn't listen."

1112
01:25:40,972 --> 01:25:47,355
"it says, it wants to take
the path that leads to my beloved."

1113
01:26:14,406 --> 01:26:17,478
Mulla, I think you are
messing with the wrong person.

1114
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,549
<i>Are you Jassa Brat, fight?</i>

1115
01:26:22,647 --> 01:26:24,991
Then you are really messing
with the wrong person.

1116
01:26:48,973 --> 01:26:52,648
Please forgive me.
Dara asked me to go after you.

1117
01:26:58,983 --> 01:27:00,087
You have shown what you
are made up of, you worm.

1118
01:27:00,151 --> 01:27:01,255
Listen to me, Jassa.

1119
01:27:02,253 --> 01:27:04,631
You couldn't dare to fight with me?
- Listen to me.

1120
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:06,168
You send men to kill me.
- Please, listen to me.

1121
01:27:06,224 --> 01:27:07,202
Where is Dara?

1122
01:27:07,258 --> 01:27:08,236
Stop hitting me.
- Ask him to come out.

1123
01:27:08,293 --> 01:27:09,966
Where is he?

1124
01:27:10,061 --> 01:27:11,472
Why are you hitting him?

1125
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,932
Why are you hitting him?

1126
01:27:54,172 --> 01:27:56,015
Mummy, mummy..

1127
01:28:00,311 --> 01:28:01,949
Mummy, why is he hitting my father?

1128
01:28:27,705 --> 01:28:30,652
Jassa, I will get dinner for you.
- Sister-in-law, I met Jassi today.

1129
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:38,119
My sister-in-law who
is like a mother to me.

1130
01:28:38,716 --> 01:28:41,060
And Jassa is like a son to her.

1131
01:28:43,521 --> 01:28:45,626
How can a mother lie to her son?

1132
01:28:48,726 --> 01:28:50,103
Why did you do this?

1133
01:28:51,629 --> 01:28:52,471
Why?

1134
01:28:55,066 --> 01:28:57,672
Jassa, you tell me,
what else could I do?

1135
01:28:58,403 --> 01:28:59,473
What would I tell you?

1136
01:29:00,071 --> 01:29:03,644
That the girl for whom
you have forgotten the world..

1137
01:29:04,275 --> 01:29:08,087
...didn't even wait for
four days after you left.

1138
01:29:08,413 --> 01:29:09,687
She married our enemies.

1139
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:16,029
Instead of telling the truth
and hurting the son's feeling"

1140
01:29:16,354 --> 01:29:18,265
...any mother could tell a lie.

1141
01:29:19,691 --> 01:29:21,068
I too did the same thing.

1142
01:30:07,538 --> 01:30:08,516
Jassa"

1143
01:30:13,278 --> 01:30:15,383
Will you not listen to
me even if I ask you in..

1144
01:30:15,446 --> 01:30:17,289
...the name of God at His doorstep?

1145
01:30:32,063 --> 01:30:36,944
I endured a sentence of staying abroad,
away from my family for 10 years..

1146
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:42,208
Tomorrow when I saw you, I realized
that my sentence is still not over.

1147
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:46,286
You have a right to complain, Jassa.

1148
01:30:47,478 --> 01:30:49,958
But you too left me in a lurch.

1149
01:30:50,548 --> 01:30:51,993
That too without saying a word.

1150
01:30:53,484 --> 01:30:55,691
I waited for you for a long time.

1151
01:30:56,487 --> 01:31:01,334
I waited so that after you come, I'll tell
you the truth and make my death easier.

1152
01:31:02,026 --> 01:31:04,165
In the little time
you had spent with me..

1153
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:07,439
...you left me with something
I can remember you.

1154
01:31:07,932 --> 01:31:10,538
And I wanted to bring
it into this world.

1155
01:31:13,604 --> 01:31:18,075
And to bring it into this world, I had
no other option but to get married.

1156
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,547
That boy who.. - Yes, Jassa.

1157
01:31:22,513 --> 01:31:24,322
The boy you saw in
that house yesterday"

1158
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,526
The one who considers
Banta his father..

1159
01:31:34,192 --> 01:31:38,231
Jassa, one can complain
about the circumstances"

1160
01:31:39,197 --> 01:31:41,370
But one cannot change the destiny.

1161
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:08,570
Hello, Junior Brar.

1162
01:32:10,528 --> 01:32:12,007
You don't talk?

1163
01:32:14,599 --> 01:32:16,135
In which class do you study?

1164
01:32:20,905 --> 01:32:21,940
Wonderful.

1165
01:32:22,607 --> 01:32:23,950
So much anger?

1166
01:32:29,147 --> 01:32:30,649
<i>Zor aw a: Singh B: a: .</i>

1167
01:32:32,016 --> 01:32:33,256
That's a nice name.

1168
01:32:33,317 --> 01:32:34,352
Who named you?

1169
01:32:37,055 --> 01:32:38,398
My uncle.

1170
01:32:38,456 --> 01:32:40,527
<i>Mr. Didar Singh B: at.</i>

1171
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:43,297
<i>We are Brats and you too are a Brat.</i>

1172
01:32:43,628 --> 01:32:45,471
But there is a difference between us.

1173
01:32:46,097 --> 01:32:48,270
YOU are OUI' enemy.

1174
01:32:48,332 --> 01:32:49,970
And we are your enemy.

1175
01:33:40,418 --> 01:33:43,456
Jassa, I am very upset with you.

1176
01:33:44,188 --> 01:33:46,395
You came home and you
didn't even inform me?

1177
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:49,127
We would have served you well.

1178
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:55,210
Oh yes, how did you feel
after seeing Jassi in our house?

1179
01:33:56,567 --> 01:33:57,978
You left her.

1180
01:33:59,036 --> 01:34:00,379
But she is fortunate.

1181
01:34:01,272 --> 01:34:04,276
Look, she has found
such a nice husband.

1182
01:34:05,209 --> 01:34:06,119
Right.

1183
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:11,688
That's why he survived.

1184
01:34:13,117 --> 01:34:15,996
Otherwise, it has never happened
that a person doesn't die..

1185
01:34:16,187 --> 01:34:17,393
...when Jassa tries to kill him.

1186
01:34:18,289 --> 01:34:20,997
Have you forgotten
how I had killed Pali?

1187
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,132
Dara..

1188
01:34:24,362 --> 01:34:27,468
You shouldn't roam around in
the village in such a carefree manner.

1189
01:34:28,699 --> 01:34:30,303
Jassa is back.

1190
01:34:39,577 --> 01:34:43,115
From the time Jassa is back,
alcohol doesn't give me the same high.

1191
01:34:43,981 --> 01:34:46,621
I thought that the
wait of ten years is over.

1192
01:34:47,385 --> 01:34:49,991
But he is making my life miserable.

1193
01:34:53,491 --> 01:34:57,735
Brother, I wonder what
special herb he had abroad.

1194
01:34:58,029 --> 01:35:00,236
Earlier he used to only use his hands.

1195
01:35:00,298 --> 01:35:02,505
Now he has started
using his brains as well.

1196
01:35:03,067 --> 01:35:05,980
I think it's better if we stay quiet.

1197
01:35:06,537 --> 01:35:07,481
Shut up.

1198
01:35:07,672 --> 01:35:11,643
Such anger?
You don't need to get so angry, sir.

1199
01:35:12,043 --> 01:35:15,616
I have found a solution for you.

1200
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,660
Let it be.

1201
01:35:17,982 --> 01:35:22,328
He builds a dream castle and
then sells it for double the price.

1202
01:35:22,386 --> 01:35:24,957
You get us insulted for no reason.

1203
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:27,196
Don't use it if you
don't like it, sir.

1204
01:35:27,258 --> 01:35:28,498
You can at least hear me out.

1205
01:35:28,593 --> 01:35:29,970
Stay as you were.

1206
01:35:30,528 --> 01:35:32,132
I will handle this on my own.

1207
01:35:33,097 --> 01:35:36,306
The problem isn't as
big as you think it is.

1208
01:35:36,734 --> 01:35:38,611
You should just become
the rightful owner of the land.

1209
01:35:38,669 --> 01:35:40,342
That too without much effort.

1210
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:43,380
The land belongs to Agam.

1211
01:35:43,674 --> 01:35:46,086
Agam is no more.

1212
01:35:46,377 --> 01:35:47,685
Now whom does that land belong to?

1213
01:35:51,482 --> 01:35:52,085
Whose?

1214
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:53,360
Rukhi's?

1215
01:35:54,151 --> 01:35:58,122
The documents in her name were
submitted to the registrar today.

1216
01:35:58,623 --> 01:36:01,627
This means now the
land belongs to Rukhi.

1217
01:36:01,692 --> 01:36:03,535
And Rukhi no longer has a husband.

1218
01:36:03,594 --> 01:36:05,665
And our Bittu is single. - Yes.

1219
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:09,069
Well done.

1220
01:36:10,368 --> 01:36:15,681
Today, for the first time you
have said something right, I swear.

1221
01:36:16,941 --> 01:36:18,943
It was bad what she had to go through.

1222
01:36:19,944 --> 01:36:21,514
You have such a nice house.

1223
01:36:22,513 --> 01:36:24,584
She was married into
such a nice family.

1224
01:36:25,116 --> 01:36:27,062
I wonder which idiot
cast his evil on her.

1225
01:36:28,152 --> 01:36:29,654
She didn't even see
two days of happiness.

1226
01:36:31,122 --> 01:36:32,726
She has her whole life ahead of her.

1227
01:36:34,692 --> 01:36:37,332
Mr. Sandhu, I say you are great.

1228
01:36:37,995 --> 01:36:39,599
How do you endure this sorrow?

1229
01:36:40,331 --> 01:36:42,004
You have so much courage.

1230
01:36:43,467 --> 01:36:48,678
Mr. Brar, I have just my
courage to endure this huge sorrow.

1231
01:36:49,974 --> 01:36:52,011
What other option do I have?

1232
01:36:54,011 --> 01:36:55,991
There is another option.

1233
01:36:57,648 --> 01:37:00,925
But only if you promise that
you won't act like a stranger.

1234
01:37:02,386 --> 01:37:04,696
I cannot see her sad.

1235
01:37:06,057 --> 01:37:07,263
She is such a nice girl.

1236
01:37:07,325 --> 01:37:08,633
And she is dressed in white.

1237
01:37:10,928 --> 01:37:12,100
I cannot tolerate this.

1238
01:37:16,133 --> 01:37:18,943
I am going to plead with you.
Please don't refuse me.

1239
01:37:20,171 --> 01:37:22,617
<i>Give Rukhi married to Emu.</i>

1240
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:25,987
lam making you a request.

1241
01:37:26,077 --> 01:37:26,680
No.

1242
01:37:27,611 --> 01:37:28,555
No, Mr. Brar.

1243
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:30,981
You don't call this a request.

1244
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:37,965
What you just said has
given my daughter another life.

1245
01:37:39,423 --> 01:37:42,131
You have come to my house as an angel.

1246
01:37:45,663 --> 01:37:47,438
Don't say that, Mr. Sandhu.

1247
01:37:48,299 --> 01:37:49,676
Let bygones be bygones.

1248
01:37:50,568 --> 01:37:52,673
Now you can remove all
the burden from your heart.

1249
01:37:55,339 --> 01:37:56,977
I am with you.

1250
01:37:57,341 --> 01:37:59,480
Where is everyone?

1251
01:37:59,744 --> 01:38:02,247
Look who is here.
Come out quickly.

1252
01:38:02,513 --> 01:38:04,584
Look your brother Dara is here.

1253
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:10,097
Hello, brother.

1254
01:38:10,287 --> 01:38:13,131
Quickly come down.
I have brought sweets for you.

1255
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,133
Keep the basket down.
What are you waiting for?

1256
01:38:18,262 --> 01:38:19,036
Hold on.

1257
01:38:19,096 --> 01:38:21,235
This is a limit. This is
like your own house. Sit over here.

1258
01:38:21,298 --> 01:38:22,936
Don't feel shy.
Sit over here. It's okay.

1259
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,201
Look, brother is here.

1260
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:26,475
Brother, you must be wondering
what I am doing in your house.

1261
01:38:26,537 --> 01:38:28,141
I was very happy.

1262
01:38:28,205 --> 01:38:29,479
I couldn't control my emotions.

1263
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,577
So I thought of sharing it with you.

1264
01:38:31,942 --> 01:38:34,388
Look, after all you are family.
Am I right?

1265
01:38:34,445 --> 01:38:37,119
Life has become sad
after Agam left us.

1266
01:38:37,248 --> 01:38:38,989
But it's okay. God has
blessed us with more happiness.

1267
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:39,993
This is how things happen.

1268
01:38:40,184 --> 01:38:41,720
Bittu. Bittu, come here.
Give it to me.

1269
01:38:42,586 --> 01:38:43,360
Give it.

1270
01:38:47,324 --> 01:38:52,205
Rukhi Kaur, daughter of Mr.
Bakshi Singh is getting married..

1271
01:39:01,639 --> 01:39:05,086
Rukhi Kaur, daughter of Mr.
Bakshi Singh is getting married..

1272
01:39:05,142 --> 01:39:11,184
...to Dilsher Singh Brar,
son of Nachattar Singh Brar.

1273
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:24,538
How dare you say such a thing?

1274
01:39:25,463 --> 01:39:28,603
Dara, be grateful that
you are standing in my house.

1275
01:39:29,967 --> 01:39:34,177
Otherwise, you too would
have been torn apart like your card.

1276
01:39:34,438 --> 01:39:36,440
No, brother.
Why are you getting angry with us?

1277
01:39:36,507 --> 01:39:38,453
Why don't you discuss
this with Mr. Sandhu?

1278
01:39:38,509 --> 01:39:40,955
He asked to Bittu's hand in
marriage and I couldn't refuse him.

1279
01:39:41,078 --> 01:39:43,581
Anyway, you must be feeling
sad for Rukhi, right?

1280
01:39:43,647 --> 01:39:46,594
Don't worry. We will take care of her.
It's not a problem.

1281
01:39:47,051 --> 01:39:49,122
Please do attend the wedding. Okay?

1282
01:39:49,487 --> 01:39:51,057
With your whole family.

1283
01:40:02,166 --> 01:40:06,478
Jassa, isn't Agam's share
of land in Rukhi's name?

1284
01:40:07,538 --> 01:40:09,415
She is soon joining
to join our family.

1285
01:40:10,307 --> 01:40:12,378
Look, we kept fighting for no reason.

1286
01:40:13,143 --> 01:40:14,918
It was so simple.

1287
01:40:15,613 --> 01:40:18,526
God always provides simple solutions.

1288
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:23,930
You are great, Lord.
One never knows what You do.

1289
01:40:34,231 --> 01:40:37,440
Mr. Brar, I made the decision
after giving it a lot of thought.

1290
01:40:38,235 --> 01:40:41,273
Keep yourself in my shoes.

1291
01:40:41,705 --> 01:40:42,945
You will understand everything.

1292
01:40:43,073 --> 01:40:45,144
Mr. Sandhu,
Rukhi got married into our family.

1293
01:40:45,609 --> 01:40:47,680
What she went through was bad.

1294
01:40:48,178 --> 01:40:50,351
But you are sending
her to our enemy's house?

1295
01:40:50,414 --> 01:40:52,485
I agree that they are your enemies.

1296
01:40:53,117 --> 01:40:54,357
But think about me as well.

1297
01:40:54,952 --> 01:40:56,954
What does a father goes through"

1298
01:40:56,987 --> 01:40:59,558
...whose daughter becomes
a widow at such a young age?

1299
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:06,168
How can a father refuse if
he gets a good match for his daughter?

1300
01:41:06,997 --> 01:41:08,271
We agree with you.

1301
01:41:08,432 --> 01:41:11,345
But perhaps you don't know why
Dara came to you with the proposal.

1302
01:41:11,468 --> 01:41:13,345
Because Dara is a nice man, Jassa.

1303
01:41:14,038 --> 01:41:16,382
I know we were fortunate
to get a son-in-law like Agam..

1304
01:41:17,374 --> 01:41:19,183
But Bittu too must be getting
proposals from nice families.

1305
01:41:19,443 --> 01:41:23,084
Yet Dara came to my house with
a proposal for my widowed daughter.

1306
01:41:23,147 --> 01:41:26,685
Brother,
Rukhi is like a daughter to us.

1307
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:29,488
Like a daughter,
but not your daughter, Mr. Brar.

1308
01:41:30,187 --> 01:41:32,497
To understand what a father of
a daughter goes through is different.

1309
01:41:32,923 --> 01:41:35,130
And to be a father
of a daughter is different.

1310
01:41:35,593 --> 01:41:37,664
Mr. Sandhu, how can you.. - No, Jassa.

1311
01:41:40,164 --> 01:41:41,939
You are right, Mr. Sandhu.

1312
01:41:42,633 --> 01:41:47,082
We might have hurt your
feelings by getting too emotional.

1313
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:48,509
Please forgive us.

1314
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:53,150
Let's go, Jassa.

1315
01:41:55,646 --> 01:41:57,091
You should have let me talk.

1316
01:41:57,147 --> 01:41:58,217
No, Jassa.

1317
01:41:58,549 --> 01:42:01,621
All our arguments are much
smaller than the problem he is facing.

1318
01:42:02,886 --> 01:42:04,365
Hello, father.

1319
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:13,069
Dear, I wanted you to
stay at Agam's house forever.

1320
01:42:14,331 --> 01:42:17,005
But this father is
yours feels helpless.

1321
01:42:17,401 --> 01:42:20,541
I wish God could find us a solution.

1322
01:42:21,238 --> 01:42:23,912
Or if someone could bring Agam back.

1323
01:42:31,215 --> 01:42:32,956
What do you mean? Without informing?

1324
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:34,529
All of a sudden,
you are going to India?

1325
01:42:34,585 --> 01:42:36,462
I don't know what's happening.
I too don't understand.

1326
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,466
First uncle went to
India without informing me.

1327
01:42:38,522 --> 01:42:39,626
Now he wants me to come there.

1328
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:41,931
Okay. Okay. When are you coming back?

1329
01:42:41,959 --> 01:42:43,461
I will come back when uncle says.

1330
01:42:43,927 --> 01:42:45,929
Listen, you and your uncle..

1331
01:42:45,963 --> 01:42:48,944
If your uncle asks you to forget me,
will you let go of me?

1332
01:42:48,966 --> 01:42:50,445
Yes, I would if uncle says so.

1333
01:42:50,501 --> 01:42:52,037
I hate you.

1334
01:43:00,377 --> 01:43:02,084
I am so unfortunate.

1335
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,650
I couldn't even meet my brother.

1336
01:43:05,282 --> 01:43:08,923
I kept on waiting for my brother
and sister-in-law over there.

1337
01:43:09,153 --> 01:43:11,895
And so much happened over here?

1338
01:43:12,923 --> 01:43:15,597
I don't know who has cast
an evil eye on our family.

1339
01:43:16,427 --> 01:43:19,237
A brother couldn't get
the support of his brother.

1340
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:22,010
First, I got separated from Jassa.

1341
01:43:23,333 --> 01:43:24,437
And you from Agam.

1342
01:43:24,501 --> 01:43:26,037
No mother, don't cry.

1343
01:43:26,503 --> 01:43:27,948
Look, your son is back.

1344
01:43:28,272 --> 01:43:32,015
Ekam, now that you are back, you should
take the responsibility of this house.

1345
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:35,019
You should marry Rukhi.

1346
01:43:36,513 --> 01:43:38,959
Daddy, Rukhi is my sister-in-law.
Agam's wife.

1347
01:43:39,016 --> 01:43:40,222
What are you saying?

1348
01:43:41,452 --> 01:43:43,932
We have said it after giving
it a lot of thought, Ekam.

1349
01:43:44,288 --> 01:43:45,926
What have you given
a lot of though, uncle?

1350
01:43:45,956 --> 01:43:47,458
I too have a personal life.

1351
01:43:47,591 --> 01:43:49,264
You know everything.

1352
01:43:49,326 --> 01:43:50,634
Ekam, you don't know.

1353
01:43:50,961 --> 01:43:53,134
Our enemies are waiting
to pounce on us.

1354
01:43:54,064 --> 01:43:55,304
They want to make Rukhi
their daughter-in-law"

1355
01:43:55,365 --> 01:43:57,504
...and transfer our
land into their name.

1356
01:43:58,135 --> 01:43:59,637
Try to understand, Ekam.

1357
01:44:00,270 --> 01:44:03,217
Uncle, you are talking about the land
because of which I lost my grandfather.

1358
01:44:03,273 --> 01:44:05,275
Because of which we had
to stay abroad for so many years.

1359
01:44:05,976 --> 01:44:08,422
Because of which Agam
spent half his life in court.

1360
01:44:08,545 --> 01:44:09,649
You are talking about that land?

1361
01:44:09,713 --> 01:44:11,488
Today, when you are
about to lose the land..

1362
01:44:11,548 --> 01:44:13,619
"Relationships don't
matter to you anymore?

1363
01:44:13,684 --> 01:44:15,163
Well clone, uncle.

1364
01:44:15,686 --> 01:44:18,496
You are no less than our enemies.
- What did you say?

1365
01:44:19,156 --> 01:44:21,432
You said that Jassa is our enemy?

1366
01:44:21,492 --> 01:44:23,529
Why did I have to have a bad son?
- Brother.

1367
01:44:23,594 --> 01:44:25,073
Hold on.. - What are you doing?

1368
01:44:25,129 --> 01:44:26,574
Let it be, brother. - Listen to me.

1369
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:28,371
Let it be. He's just a kid.
- Get out of my sight.

1370
01:44:28,432 --> 01:44:30,241
How dare you! - Stop it, brother.

1371
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,211
The one who has done so much for us.
- Control yourself.

1372
01:44:32,269 --> 01:44:34,010
You address him as our enemy?
- Listen to me.

1373
01:44:34,204 --> 01:44:34,978
Let it be.

1374
01:44:35,005 --> 01:44:38,009
Listen to me.
- I had just one child. Agam.

1375
01:44:38,175 --> 01:44:39,518
He is dead.

1376
01:44:39,576 --> 01:44:41,021
Daddy, please listen to me.
- Get lost.

1377
01:44:41,078 --> 01:44:42,079
Brother.. - You...!

1378
01:44:42,146 --> 01:44:43,523
No. No.

1379
01:44:45,582 --> 01:44:46,253
Don't do this.

1380
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:48,085
Get out of my house.

1381
01:44:48,152 --> 01:44:50,393
Listen to me.
What are you doing?

1382
01:44:50,454 --> 01:44:52,127
Our son came home
after such a long time.

1383
01:44:52,189 --> 01:44:53,759
Let's go inside.
- No do this. Stop him.

1384
01:44:53,991 --> 01:44:56,494
We don't have a son. Let's go inside.
- Please listen to me.

1385
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,130
My son.. - Let's go inside.

1386
01:44:58,195 --> 01:44:59,401
Please listen to me.

1387
01:45:22,586 --> 01:45:24,691
Your bag was left behind.

1388
01:45:29,993 --> 01:45:31,472
So you are leaving your uncle?

1389
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,179
You once told your grandfather"

1390
01:45:38,101 --> 01:45:41,014
...that you don't want the land,
you want your uncle.

1391
01:45:44,408 --> 01:45:45,751
You were a child back then.

1392
01:45:46,577 --> 01:45:47,681
You are a grown up now.

1393
01:45:49,346 --> 01:45:51,223
Perhaps you made a mistake back then.

1394
01:45:55,519 --> 01:45:56,998
Don't worry about your uncle.

1395
01:45:58,488 --> 01:45:59,990
He is crazy.

1396
01:46:02,025 --> 01:46:04,938
Sometimes for father,
sometimes for brother..

1397
01:46:05,662 --> 01:46:07,073
Sometimes for Agam..

1398
01:46:07,531 --> 01:46:09,101
And sometimes he lived for you.

1399
01:46:09,399 --> 01:46:11,538
He never lived for himself.

1400
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:18,520
But you never make that mistake.

1401
01:46:21,111 --> 01:46:23,523
One should always
live for one own self.

1402
01:46:27,184 --> 01:46:28,458
Take care of yourself.

1403
01:46:29,519 --> 01:46:32,363
Uncle, you are leaving your Ekam?

1404
01:46:32,422 --> 01:46:33,662
No, uncle.

1405
01:46:35,225 --> 01:46:36,533
Please forgive me.

1406
01:46:36,593 --> 01:46:39,403
This life belongs to you. You can do
whatever you want with it. - Enough.

1407
01:46:40,397 --> 01:46:41,637
That's enough, son.

1408
01:46:50,641 --> 01:46:55,590
Rukhi, this might be our first meeting
but I know you from a long time.

1409
01:46:57,014 --> 01:46:59,494
Agam always used to talk about you.

1410
01:46:59,983 --> 01:47:02,327
How you came into his life.

1411
01:47:02,953 --> 01:47:04,455
How you became his wife.

1412
01:47:05,188 --> 01:47:07,259
It was like a dream come true for him.

1413
01:47:08,625 --> 01:47:10,662
God took him away from us.

1414
01:47:11,495 --> 01:47:13,634
But can treasure his dreams, can't we?

1415
01:47:19,536 --> 01:47:25,111
Rukhi, trying asking your
God how happy Agam's soul will be..

1416
01:47:25,309 --> 01:47:29,314
...if you come back to the house where
Agam had brought you after marriage.

1417
01:47:43,226 --> 01:47:48,574
Brother, this is like having
cutting the cake and having it too.

1418
01:47:48,632 --> 01:47:51,135
This will make them lose their pride.

1419
01:47:51,468 --> 01:47:53,641
And we will also get the land.

1420
01:47:54,438 --> 01:47:57,146
And even our Bittu will get married.

1421
01:47:58,575 --> 01:48:02,022
I don't even realize about him,
that we even had another brother.

1422
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:05,116
Today I realize he
will be our ace of spades.

1423
01:48:09,019 --> 01:48:11,090
Hello, brothers.

1424
01:48:13,523 --> 01:48:16,129
You will never change.

1425
01:48:16,293 --> 01:48:18,466
You are keeping them
busy with your talks.

1426
01:48:18,628 --> 01:48:20,505
I have been looking for
you all over the village.

1427
01:48:20,664 --> 01:48:21,938
There are just two
days left for the wedding.

1428
01:48:21,965 --> 01:48:23,239
You should start making preparations.

1429
01:48:24,267 --> 01:48:25,109
Why are you staring at me?

1430
01:48:27,204 --> 01:48:30,981
Dara.. let me know
if you need anything.

1431
01:48:31,341 --> 01:48:32,649
I know you are hesitant.

1432
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:34,953
Our enmity is different.

1433
01:48:35,045 --> 01:48:37,047
But one should always
share happiness, right?

1434
01:48:37,114 --> 01:48:39,492
You think so much about us.
Am I right?

1435
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:41,429
You gave condolences for Agam's death.

1436
01:48:41,485 --> 01:48:42,725
You were worried about Surjeet.

1437
01:48:42,953 --> 01:48:44,557
You were concerned about Rukhi, right?

1438
01:48:47,057 --> 01:48:50,231
You should stop using this old rag.

1439
01:48:50,394 --> 01:48:52,169
You are a well-known person.

1440
01:48:52,963 --> 01:48:55,307
Don't worry.
You will get a new one at the wedding.

1441
01:48:55,465 --> 01:48:59,072
Not because you are the brother,
but because you are the uncle.

1442
01:49:00,337 --> 01:49:01,407
What are you trying to say?

1443
01:49:01,471 --> 01:49:02,506
What's there to say? Nothing.

1444
01:49:03,206 --> 01:49:05,948
The gift which we were to give you,
now you are going to give it to us.

1445
01:49:06,043 --> 01:49:07,545
We will go together for the wedding.

1446
01:49:08,412 --> 01:49:10,153
Everyone in the village
will say that they have..

1447
01:49:10,213 --> 01:49:11,954
...never seen such
a wedding procession.

1448
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:15,958
Dara, the wedding will take place.

1449
01:49:17,687 --> 01:49:22,602
But Ekam will be
the groom and not Bittu.

1450
01:49:28,098 --> 01:49:29,634
You have to be a part of the wedding.

1451
01:49:30,267 --> 01:49:31,371
With your entire family.

1452
01:49:32,235 --> 01:49:33,441
I am inviting you.

1453
01:49:34,971 --> 01:49:35,642
Bye.

1454
01:49:41,545 --> 01:49:45,288
Oh yes, you once again lost the land.

1455
01:49:46,416 --> 01:49:49,556
God's simple solutions didn't work.

1456
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:53,697
Really, You are great, Lord.
One never knows what You do.

1457
01:50:00,897 --> 01:50:02,069
What happened, brother?

1458
01:50:02,566 --> 01:50:03,670
What else can happen?

1459
01:50:04,034 --> 01:50:06,947
Bakshi Singh must have
now said yes to them.

1460
01:50:07,404 --> 01:50:08,405
This is not fair, brother.

1461
01:50:08,672 --> 01:50:10,015
Come, let's go and talk to him.

1462
01:50:10,907 --> 01:50:12,580
We have done enough of talking.

1463
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:14,518
Now we will make the decision.

1464
01:50:15,579 --> 01:50:18,355
Jassa, there will be
two wedding processions.

1465
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:23,327
The one with strength
shall take the bride.

1466
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:30,504
"The lock of hair on my
son's forehead shines brightly."

1467
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:37,341
"The lock of hair on my
son's forehead shines brightly."

1468
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:41,979
"Come on, apply the customary henna."

1469
01:50:42,072 --> 01:50:46,214
"Come on, apply the customary henna."

1470
01:50:46,343 --> 01:50:52,385
"The henna's color
is dark red on my son.."

1471
01:50:52,449 --> 01:50:58,525
"The lock of hair on my
son's forehead shines brightly."

1472
01:51:06,363 --> 01:51:12,336
"When an enmity begins,
swords clash at the village square."

1473
01:51:17,274 --> 01:51:22,587
"When an enmity begins,
swords clash at the village square."

1474
01:51:22,646 --> 01:51:25,388
"We then eat.."

1475
01:51:25,448 --> 01:51:28,486
"..only after killing our enemy."

1476
01:51:28,552 --> 01:51:30,589
"After killing our enemy."

1477
01:51:30,654 --> 01:51:33,294
"Today, we have to clear
all the doubts of our enemy."

1478
01:51:33,356 --> 01:51:36,496
"We will skim them
off like cream from milk."

1479
01:51:41,498 --> 01:51:44,206
"Today, we have to clear
all the illusions of our enemy."

1480
01:51:44,401 --> 01:51:47,041
"We will skim them
off like cream from milk."

1481
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:53,086
"The ones, who act brave, will be lying
in a grave. They will meet the dust."

1482
01:51:55,212 --> 01:51:57,954
"Today we'll remove them
from their houses and shoot them."

1483
01:51:57,981 --> 01:52:00,518
"Today we will get rid of them,
once and for all."

1484
01:52:00,584 --> 01:52:02,928
"Today we'll remove them
from their houses and shoot them."

1485
01:52:02,986 --> 01:52:06,331
"Today we will get rid of them,
once and for all."

1486
01:52:17,334 --> 01:52:20,042
"You had ill intentions about me,
oh my enemy."

1487
01:52:20,103 --> 01:52:22,606
"You don't know how powerful I am."

1488
01:52:22,672 --> 01:52:27,052
"You don't know how powerful I am."

1489
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:28,180
"How powerful I am."

1490
01:52:28,245 --> 01:52:30,953
"You had ill intentions about me,
oh my enemy."

1491
01:52:31,014 --> 01:52:33,585
"You don't know how powerful I am."

1492
01:52:35,585 --> 01:52:38,589
"Today, I will open
all the previous records."

1493
01:52:38,655 --> 01:52:41,261
"Wait and watch, there will
be firing in front of your house."

1494
01:52:41,391 --> 01:52:44,065
"Today, I will open
all the previous records."

1495
01:52:44,194 --> 01:52:46,572
"Wait and watch, there will
be firing in front of your house."

1496
01:52:46,630 --> 01:52:49,304
"I will clear all your illusions."

1497
01:52:49,432 --> 01:52:52,140
"Today I will use my
brawn against my enemies."

1498
01:52:52,202 --> 01:52:55,274
" I am brave. There will
be dead bodies lying everywhere."

1499
01:52:55,338 --> 01:52:58,217
"I need to settle the scores."

1500
01:53:00,176 --> 01:53:02,588
"Today, we'll remove them
from their houses and shoot them."

1501
01:53:02,646 --> 01:53:05,559
"We will get rid of them,
once and for all."

1502
01:53:05,615 --> 01:53:08,027
"Today, we'll remove them
from their houses and shoot them."

1503
01:53:08,084 --> 01:53:11,293
"We will get rid of them,
once and for all."

1504
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:24,935
"There is fire in the eyes.
It's decision time."

1505
01:53:25,001 --> 01:53:28,244
"No one will have
pity on anyone here."

1506
01:53:30,073 --> 01:53:32,679
"The blood boils in the veins."

1507
01:53:32,942 --> 01:53:35,422
"Today I need to
get rid of the claims."

1508
01:53:35,545 --> 01:53:38,287
"When will I get a chance
to have a one-on-one.."

1509
01:53:38,348 --> 01:53:41,090
"I have been wondering
from a long time."

1510
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:49,502
"With the fire in me,
I will bury all my enemies alive."

1511
01:54:19,656 --> 01:54:22,569
Brother, I think Jassa
ran away like a coward.

1512
01:54:24,361 --> 01:54:28,241
No. Jassa isn't one
of those who will run away.

1513
01:54:29,999 --> 01:54:33,970
I know where he must
be waiting for me.

1514
01:54:46,149 --> 01:54:48,322
Well done, Jassa.

1515
01:54:51,554 --> 01:54:53,534
There is something about you.

1516
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:57,995
Enmity is fun if
the enemy is like you.

1517
01:54:59,262 --> 01:55:02,505
My soul feels alive
when you come before me.

1518
01:55:02,699 --> 01:55:05,145
This is the last time we
are coming face to face, Dara.

1519
01:55:05,301 --> 01:55:09,477
This matter will only
end after one of us dies.

1520
01:55:09,672 --> 01:55:12,448
Today if you breathe
a single breath more than me..

1521
01:55:12,609 --> 01:55:13,713
This land will be yours.

1522
01:55:19,249 --> 01:55:21,991
"The bullets are being fired
like there are firecrackers."

1523
01:55:22,185 --> 01:55:24,688
"Today I will be act
stubborn and claim my rights."

1524
01:55:24,954 --> 01:55:27,434
"I will bury all those.."

1525
01:55:27,524 --> 01:55:30,266
"..who are walking
bravely towards me."

1526
01:55:40,703 --> 01:55:43,741
I hate you so much that
if you are born a thousand times..

1527
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:47,417
Then I shall kill
you a thousand times.

1528
01:55:48,545 --> 01:55:52,493
Today Dara will go back to the
village with your turban on his head.

1529
01:55:52,715 --> 01:55:56,561
It won't be fun if our
enmity ends with a single bullet.

1530
01:57:11,961 --> 01:57:13,372
Stop right there.

1531
01:57:15,465 --> 01:57:19,242
Your Dara had a desire to
get face to face with my Jassa.

1532
01:57:19,302 --> 01:57:20,940
Let them settle it.

1533
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:22,176
Get lost.

1534
01:57:22,372 --> 01:57:25,478
Why does your entire family
want to die with our hands?

1535
01:57:26,543 --> 01:57:27,613
Get him.

1536
01:57:57,173 --> 01:57:58,243
Go on.

1537
01:57:59,976 --> 01:58:05,449
If anyone tries to cross it,
I will kill him.

1538
01:59:04,507 --> 01:59:07,351
All you can do is talk, Dara.

1539
01:59:07,677 --> 01:59:10,317
Not even four blows"

1540
01:59:10,446 --> 01:59:12,551
And you are back to your old tactics.

1541
01:59:12,915 --> 01:59:16,658
I tried hard to be honest
to our enmity like you.

1542
01:59:16,919 --> 01:59:19,297
But it is very difficult.

1543
01:59:28,297 --> 01:59:32,973
Jassa, you have grown
old but you are still strong.

1544
01:59:34,537 --> 01:59:38,485
Now see how Dara fights like Dara.

1545
01:59:48,584 --> 01:59:54,660
Do you remember it all started
with me killing your father?

1546
01:59:57,593 --> 02:00:01,006
I am sure after seeing Pali's dead
body you must have known..

1547
02:00:01,898 --> 02:00:04,071
...how I seek revenge.

1548
02:00:05,401 --> 02:00:09,213
But you still have one
death to seek revenge of.

1549
02:00:12,041 --> 02:00:13,543
Of Agam's death.

1550
02:03:03,646 --> 02:03:05,057
Dara!

1551
02:03:27,937 --> 02:03:30,213
Uncle! Uncle!

Let go of me, mother!

No.

I am alive in your son.

1559
02:04:55,624 --> 02:05:00,130
I knew that Zorawar is your son.

1560
02:05:01,464 --> 02:05:04,240
I brought him up as your enemy.

1561
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:12,985
Now your own son will
seek revenge for this.

1562
02:05:24,086 --> 02:05:25,463
Why is he killing my uncle?

1563
02:05:33,729 --> 02:05:35,640
Let go! Let go of me!

1564
02:05:47,643 --> 02:05:49,350
Uncle! Uncle!

A letter for you.

letter to you a number of times.'

'But I never found
the courage to do it.'

1569

'When I heard that you are getting
released, I couldn't stop myself.'

1570

'The news that Jassa is coming back..'

1575
02:07:09,225 --> 02:07:11,967
'..has spread in the
village like a wild fire.'

1576
02:07:12,328 --> 02:07:15,241
'Everywhere, everyone is
talking about the same thing.'

1577
02:07:15,297 --> 02:07:19,507

but the enmity is still there.'

Dara has inculcated in Zorawar..'

'And then there are the
taunts that villagers make..'

'l have spent my
life roaring in pain.'

What a strange story this is."
