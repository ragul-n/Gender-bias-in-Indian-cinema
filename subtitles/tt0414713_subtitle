1
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,113
If I have to see one more
monument today, I'm done for.

2
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,281
Let's go home now.

3
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:16,189
Oh my God! Oh my God! Would you
look at that? What is that?

4
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,984
That? It's for election campaigns.

5
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:23,290
Stop, stop! I want to get that on my camera.
Stop, stop, stop!

6
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:25,758
Hey! What are you doing?

7
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,029
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:29,793
OK I'm going around and coming back.

9
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,564
Careful!

10
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,948
Uncontrollable. Typical Roy family!

11
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,945
If your wife has complaints then
startle her tonight.

12
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:51,657
I have the cure for you...

13
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:53,325
it's to increase your might.

14
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:56,024
This oil is for enlargement.

15
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:58,595
To make your life...

16
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,662
your daily life a delight.

17
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,615
Mom. I can't tell you how much
I love being in India.

18
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:21,510
And with the family.

19
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:28,626
I still can't understand why
you didn't want me to come.

20
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:55,751
Things are so crazy here.
And so real you know.

21
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,961
I feel very foreign. Yet sometimes...

22
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,136
something tugs at me deep inside.

23
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,352
I'm sorry I didn't understand.

24
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:27,445
Heads are need to cover.

25
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:28,517
Sorry.

26
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:53,211
It's almost been a month. I miss y ou.

27
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,287
Today we're going to the village...

28
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,328
to the place where I was born.

29
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:40,826
Now what?!

30
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:51,929
Arre wait wait - relax!
Don't worry. I'll just fix it.

31
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:54,160
It's amazing to actually be here you know.
Yeah.

32
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:58,403
I wish I could remember something.

33
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,509
Should we go now?

34
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:06,874
Let Kaju come.

35
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:16,951
Uncle. Come sit here. I want to
get a shot of you guys for Ma.

36
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,560
Gran, do you want to say something to Ma?

37
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:25,630
Is she here that I can speak to her!

38
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,361
Gran, she's going to send this to America.

39
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,130
Just speak into the camera.

40
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:32,694
Keya, come quickly!

41
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:35,866
In just one month
your daughter's turned my hair white!

42
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,736
Look Ma. She finally stopped dying it!

43
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,370
Shoo, you wicked child!

44
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,610
But honestly, to have this child
with me after all these years...

45
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,651
it's just so lovely.

46
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:04,631
How much is that?

47
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,738
Fiv e rupees.

48
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:12,405
It's okay. Just give me four.

49
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:24,816
Here's ten. Keep the change.

50
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:28,418
Kaju, Tuki! Hurry up!

51
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:29,793
It's late.

52
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:32,864
What's her name?

53
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,991
Durga.

54
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,571
Shall we go?

55
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:45,968
Come. Oh you bought a pot. Nice.

56
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:51,116
Come on Kaju you were so young.

57
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:55,711
You're right I mean I was only 3.
But seriously. I can't remember anything.

58
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:02,484
Yeah. OK listen.
Do you want to come for this party?

59
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,121
No.
Come on. It'll be fun.

60
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,400
No. I don't know anyone.

61
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,696
There'll be lots of people from different
colleges. So you'll get to know people.

62
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:16,999
Come on.
India's not just villages, it has cities also!

63
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:18,270
Oh really!

64
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:22,610
You should see them. Come you haven't even
met Siddhartha yet. Come come Kaju please.

65
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:23,773
Okay. Fine. I'll come.

66
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:29,244
It's okay, Bela, we'll make the beds.
Good night.

67
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,824
So who else is going to be there?

68
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,326
Everyone! Siddhartha will be there!
Yeah!

69
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,513
Are we leaving anytime soon?

70
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,582
Why? We don't have to be home till 1 am.

71
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,320
Are you getting bored?

72
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:13,354
No, I'm fine. It's just...
It's part of my Indian education...

73
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:18,133
the sociology of the
elite Indian twenty somethings.

74
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,030
I'm missing out on the joke.

75
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:21,971
You won't get it!

76
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:33,542
Oh Hi. I didn't see you.

77
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:42,590
It's nice out here isn't it?

78
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:46,460
I'm Kajori Roy by the way. Kaju.

79
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:49,126
I'm Kabir. Kabir Sehgal.

80
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:56,572
I believe there's a famous mosque
around here.

81
00:09:56,743 --> 00:10:03,649
Oh that's the Hazrat Nizamuddin.
He was a famous Sufi saint. 15th century.

82
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,108
And it's not a mosque. It's a shrine.

83
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,686
Oh. Are you a history major?

84
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:14,424
It's just stuff you grow up with
when you live here.

85
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:15,926
You're visiting?

86
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,062
Ya. I'm from LA.

87
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:22,224
So I suppose you're doing the whole
tourist thing? Camera and all...

88
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:27,863
Exploring the ancient India,
the exotic India, the spiritual India...

89
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,841
Well I just want to get to know all of India.
The real India because...

90
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:37,372
Oh. The real India. And what? I suppose
you'll find it through your foreign lens.

91
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,352
Are you always this quick
to put someone in a box?

92
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,888
I just want to get to know India
because it's a part of who I am.

93
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:52,591
Well it was nice meeting you Cabron.
Or what was it... Kabir!

94
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:58,526
So half an hour?
Let me ask Mamu what the plan is tomorrow.

95
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:04,673
Mamu? Tomorrow you're practicing
for the cultural function right?

96
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:09,007
Yes. We have to. There are only 2 weeks left.

97
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:13,585
So I was thinking...
I'd go to the University tomorrow.

98
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,186
Coz I haven't seen Mom's
old college yet you know.

99
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:20,787
Why don't we go day after tomorrow?

100
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,589
Why?

101
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,788
I'll take you there myself.

102
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:26,387
We'll go again.

103
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:31,533
Kaju, the university is far off.
You don't know how Delhi is - you'll get lost.

104
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:36,099
Maima I went to Mexico alone. Just tell me
which bus to take. Write it down for me.

105
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,304
I'll be fine I promise.

106
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,874
Bus? How preposterous! No. Absolutely not!

107
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:20,541
Can you tell me where I can get chola
bhaturas? Is there a good cafe around here?

108
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:28,121
Ya. You can try Balbir's. What you do
is go straight down and take a right.

109
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:44,443
Tuki didn't tell me you were coming.
Come sit.

110
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,104
Guys, this is Tuki's cousin - Kaju.

111
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:54,280
Gobind bhai, meet Kaju.
She's come from America.

112
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:59,614
From America! In my cafe!
My God. It's unbelievable!

113
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:06,863
This calls for a special tea - on the house!
Pappu, make the No. 1 ginger tea special.

114
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,962
Less sugar. And you'd better use
mineral water!

115
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:12,567
Is this your first time here?

116
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:16,706
No. Actually I was born here but then I
moved to the US when I was three.

117
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:20,337
I just graduated from UCLA.
But then I thought I'd take a break...

118
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:23,314
...before getting a job or
thinking of Grad School.

119
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:25,873
It seemed a good time to
get in touch with my roots!

120
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,514
I mean... Dilli is so intense you know.

121
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:33,785
Ok guys we have to go.
Can't bunk Chakki's class.

122
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:38,523
Kaju see you around.
Kabir don't forget Shake Soc at 3.

123
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:40,398
Bye guys. Catch you later.

124
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:43,764
What's Shake Sock?

125
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,999
It's our Shakespeare Dramatic Society.

126
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,267
Shakespeare?

127
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,411
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

128
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,040
No. Maybe I could shoot it
through my foreign lens!

129
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,316
Oh thank you. Pappu?

130
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:03,748
My good name is Sanjay.
Pappu my home name.

131
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:06,823
Madam, take one shot of me, please.

132
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,497
Oye, Pappu. Becoming a film star!
Nonsense!

133
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:14,395
I made you Lakshman in the Ram Leela
and you couldn't say one line properly.

134
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:15,491
Standing around bullshitting...

135
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:22,068
So Madam do you make films or something?

136
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,501
No, I just make documentaries.

137
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:24,667
Daku? Bandits?

138
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,337
If you like bandits, let me do
Daku Gabbar Singh for you.

139
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:29,640
It's a brilliant dialogue.

140
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:41,784
"For miles around mothers
get their children to sleep

141
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:44,758
by scaring them with stories about me,

142
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,764
the dreaded bandit Gabbar Singh!"

143
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,127
"How many bullets are there?

144
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:52,735
How many bullets?!"

145
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,501
"Six, Boss."

146
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,604
"Six bullets, three men.!

147
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,902
Very unjust!

148
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:05,373
Very, very unjust!"

149
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:10,979
That was really cool. Thank you.

150
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,422
That was nothing.

151
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,959
My son, the younger one, is even better.

152
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:17,790
By God, he dances so well.

153
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,455
He easily defeats even Shahrukh...

154
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,629
Gobind bhai, can I come
to your house to shoot?

155
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,496
Why are you pulling my leg?

156
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,663
Maybe that's not such a good idea Kaju.

157
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,868
Why not? I think it's an
excellent education for her.

158
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:33,807
Just what she's looking for.

159
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:38,311
I've got a good idea. Why don't you
take Kaju to Gobind bhai's place.

160
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,944
Me. Why?

161
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,452
His name is Kabir. His father
is a very senior government official.

162
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,023
He's doing Economics Honors.
He's very bright. He'll be doing an MBA.

163
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:51,358
How is that even relevant?
I hate corporate types.

164
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,020
No, no. This boy is right.

165
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,898
He'll be the best
to show you around Delhi.

166
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:01,136
Gran, I can... I can go around
Delhi perfectly just by myself.

167
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:07,368
Listen to me, sweetheart. Please don't go
anywhere alone. For my sake.

168
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:11,913
OK Gran, I won't. But only because
I adore y ou.

169
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:14,312
Besides this Kabir is such a dork.

170
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:18,321
No he's not.
And he's the one who knows Delhi the best.

171
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,724
Will you all mind if I ask you something?

172
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:23,655
We're all ears.

173
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:27,956
When you wear pants
how do you manage to pee?

174
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:41,076
We don't pee!

175
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,078
How can that be?

176
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,452
Don't you wear pajamas?

177
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:50,954
With pajamas you can take one leg out
but with pants y ou can't!

178
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:55,316
Down with lockouts! Lockouts won't do!
Won't do! Won't do!

179
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:03,195
This is the beginning!
The struggle lies ahead!

180
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:07,001
"Long Live Workers Unity"

181
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,039
Raise your voices, workers!

182
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,836
Raise them louder! Raise them louder!

183
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,441
Raise your v oice against the police state!

184
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:18,482
"Workers and peasants
demand the renewal of India."

185
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:21,376
So you're making okra?

186
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:25,318
This is Shakunthala. She's an amazing woman.
Today she's making okra!

187
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:28,291
And if you ask me -

188
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:32,826
Move! Run away from here!

189
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,100
They are crazy!
Again - the same thing!

190
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:43,339
Ask me who is
the neighborhood loudspeaker?

191
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:45,009
Leelavati.

192
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:46,408
And who is Leelavati?

193
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:47,477
My wife.

194
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,772
Go and sit there quietly - good children.

195
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:54,243
The kids have been waiting since yesterday.

196
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:56,316
They've asked me ten times.

197
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,481
When is the heroine aunty coming,
when is she coming?

198
00:17:58,557 --> 00:17:59,888
I said "She'll come, she'll come."

199
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,356
Good day, Uncle.

200
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,324
Hav e they come?
Yes, this is her.

201
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,224
It's a good shot, right?
How is it looking?

202
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:46,836
Oh no. The electricity's gone.
It's the same story everyday.

203
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:50,606
Today I've made this dessert called
halwa after a long time.

204
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:53,939
When his grandfather was alive
we used to make it on all occasions.

205
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,908
Gobind also loves it.

206
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,845
He told me to make it since you were coming.

207
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:01,213
I said today's kids don't like such things.

208
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:02,982
He said Kaju madam is different.

209
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,683
I said, as if you know her so well.
How many times have you met her?

210
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:08,158
He said he just met you once
and that too only three days ago.

211
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:08,921
But don't you worry...

212
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,294
It's just a mouse. It's alright.

213
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:15,729
But don't you worry. Eat, eat.
I've made it with boiled water.

214
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,827
What can we do. No matter
how clean we keep it, our neighbors...

215
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:22,931
Be quiet. Are you going
to say everything in one breath?

216
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,067
From the time my
parents went to the village...

217
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,941
Oh god, the village.
Don't even talk about it...

218
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,342
When we went there
for the kids' summer vacation

219
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,645
My father-in-law insisted
that we stay on there.

220
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,981
The children go to school here.
Now tell me can they study in a village?

221
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,214
I put my foot down. "I'll educate the
children." And I came back to the city.

222
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,222
Whose photograph is that?

223
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,987
That's Balbir Uncle.
He was a v ery good man.

224
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:49,200
Gobind's father used to say that it was
a blessing to know such a great man.

225
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:53,032
Sadly I never met him. You must have seen
his photograph in the cafe - it's a big one.

226
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:57,404
Enough now. You've been jabbering like a
tape recorder for one hour. Without a pause.

227
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,810
She asked me about the picture so I
answered. Otherwise why would I talk.

228
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:06,841
No. It's not been you who's been talking all
this time. It's been our neighbor, Mr Chaddha!

229
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,823
The electricity's back!
Come on son, come on! Dance now!

230
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:51,389
We're definitely lost. I don't understand why
you had to insist that Gobind bhai not drop us.

231
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:56,463
All we had to do is walk straight. We wouldn't
have been lost if you hadn't tried a shortcut.

232
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:59,166
Wait. I'll just find out.

233
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,664
What? What happened?
Nothing.

234
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,751
Kaju. Is ev erything okay with you?

235
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:27,655
Ya. Why?

236
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:30,559
You've been a little
withdrawn the past few days.

237
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,387
I'm fine.

238
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,464
Sure?
Ya.

239
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:39,535
Is it Kabir? Are you falling for him?

240
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:42,434
Don't be silly. Come on.
Let's do some stretches.

241
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:44,166
I think he likes you.

242
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:45,904
Whatever. Tuki!

243
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,670
I'm not doing anymore.

244
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,044
Come on. It's just a little bit.
Give me your hands. OK?

245
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:04,028
Tuki remember how you were telling me
about the villagers migrating to the cities...

246
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:05,295
What?

247
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,956
When we were coming back
from Chandan Hola?

248
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,568
Ya. Why?

249
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,137
Is that common?

250
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:17,331
I guess if there's a bad season
or something. Why?

251
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:23,312
No I was just wondering.
Beladi, will you bring us some water please?

252
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:29,543
Thank you.
More?!

253
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:35,854
Hi Veena.
Hi.

254
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,924
So who won?
Guess!

255
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,261
Long time. How's Rohit? I want Kabir
to meet him. Get a feel for the Bank.

256
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,739
Yes, yes any time. Son, you're joining
the bank? But you're such a talented actor.

257
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:57,014
Yes, Kabir has a real passion for acting.

258
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,138
With so many English films...

259
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:03,243
Acting shacting is all very well as a hobby
but he has to find a real job to feed himself.

260
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:08,287
And what is this real job we are talking about?

261
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:16,757
Baba are you coming for a wash?
Ma, will you order a beer for me please?

262
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:42,016
Namaste Didi. Hello Bubli.
Do you know what I've got for you?

263
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:48,322
Chocolate!
No. Look! Elephants!

264
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,328
You didn't like them?

265
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,431
Guess who didn't like them either!
For you!

266
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,577
It may not be chocolate but its
elephants! Say thank you.

267
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,814
And this is for you. Bangles!

268
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:08,649
Ban-gels. For me? You're spoiling me too!

269
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:11,082
Do you want chocolate? Come.

270
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:14,286
I don't hav e change.

271
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,621
Okay, wait. I'll get some.

272
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:26,363
I have this rehearsal I need to get
to very urgently, so can we leave?

273
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,769
Sure. I'm just waiting for the change.

274
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:33,835
So when can we meet again? Day after?

275
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:36,705
And where do you want to go?

276
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:40,683
Umm actually I kind of want to
come back here again.

277
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:45,757
Again? But why? I mean there are so many
interesting parts of Delhi

278
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,190
that you hav en't seen.

279
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:51,092
And you've done the whole poverty thing.

280
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:57,861
Is that what you think?
There's no lack of poverty in LA you know.

281
00:25:58,003 --> 00:25:59,800
Oh please. It's not even the same thing.

282
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:03,601
How would you know? First of all
I was born poorer than Bublee.

283
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:08,108
I was born in a village which didn't
even have electricity or tubewells.

284
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,738
Maybe that's why I'm drawn
to the whole poverty thing.

285
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:13,952
And what? Your mother went
from a village to America?

286
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:21,224
My birth parents died from a malaria epidemic
which wiped out my entire village.

287
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:25,120
I was adopted from an agency
when I was three.

288
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,729
Kaju I'm really sorry. I had no idea.

289
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:35,070
Bubli, come I'll take you home.

290
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,137
I can drop you.

291
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:39,541
It's fine I'll manage. I thought
you had rehearsal anyway.

292
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:52,415
Give me a small Goldflake...

293
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:59,395
What movie is it?

294
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:00,597
Raaz.

295
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:03,300
Raj?
No. Raaz.

296
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:04,664
Same thing.

297
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:07,936
Isn't that the remake of "What Lies Beneath"?

298
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:10,138
How many is that?

299
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:12,641
Two tablecloths. Three towels.

300
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:15,176
Doesn't it have that Bengali bombshell?

301
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,042
Go and see if there are more
clothes in the girl's room.

302
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:27,757
Oh god, who could it be at this time of night?

303
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:31,458
Oh wow, look who's here!

304
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:32,528
Keya!

305
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:33,723
Surprise!

306
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,768
Oh my God! Mom? I can't believe it!

307
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:48,073
Here's Ma.
You should have sent word!

308
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:58,013
Come sweetheart.

309
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:00,121
I just can't believe it!

310
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:03,794
Go, go and sit down.

311
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:06,428
She loves giving surprises.

312
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,996
On which flight did you come?

313
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:12,864
Come sit next to your Mom.

314
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:15,303
Ma come and sit.
Sit here my darling.

315
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,098
Be comfy.
Thanks.

316
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:21,237
Wow this girl has grown so tall - Tuki!

317
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,275
Of course - you've come after so long.

318
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:26,283
So your case is finished and everything?

319
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:26,983
Case is over.

320
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:28,844
And you locked up the house?

321
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:31,285
Sweetheart, I locked up the house efficiently.

322
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,152
On your own!

323
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:37,384
Ma, this girl thinks only she can
get anything done. Thank you Bela.

324
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:40,960
Really, even after all these years
you look exactly the same.

325
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:44,068
You're the one who's beautiful.

326
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,668
But tell me, what are you feeding my brother?

327
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:48,772
He's looking wonderfully robust!

328
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:50,101
It's not me. It's your mother!

329
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:54,807
How are you Ma?

330
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:57,847
What do you expect being separated from you?

331
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,411
Do you know how much I miss you?

332
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:02,712
And I didn't miss you?

333
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:09,951
Really. I can't believe it.

334
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:13,865
Do you know how many years
it has been since you came?

335
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,928
Five years.

336
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:20,831
What were you all watching?

337
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,267
"Secret". Ask Ma.
She has to watch TV twice a day.

338
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,839
But ask her and she won't
be able to tell you anything.

339
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:30,445
Ma, tell us who's that?

340
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:32,446
That rogue?

341
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:35,346
So what have you been doing?

342
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:40,687
Well it's been terrific. Dilli's so amazing.
And your college is so beautiful.

343
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:42,791
Isn't it beautiful? Did you meet L?

344
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:46,586
I did. She's great. And I also had the
best chick peas and naan ever.

345
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:49,866
I know where you had those.
Chacha di Hatti?

346
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:53,570
No. It was Balbir's dhaba.

347
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:56,002
Ya, so who did you go with? Tuki?

348
00:29:56,441 --> 00:30:00,036
Ma that's the whole point. Why do I
always have to go with someone?

349
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:06,541
Tuki's friends were there.
Sid and Radhika. Kabir was there.

350
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:10,452
Yeah Kabir. Ma's been
talking about him all morning.

351
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:11,954
She says you'v e been
seeing quite a lot of him.

352
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:12,853
No way.

353
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:14,221
I mean do you like him? He's a nice...

354
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,224
No way!

355
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:15,782
You don't like him?

356
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,260
I don't think I'm ever going to see him again.

357
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:20,790
Kaju, every time a guy gets close to you,
you just back off...

358
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:23,531
Darling don't be so scared of commitment...

359
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:26,226
No. He's just such a bourgeois snob!

360
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:27,565
Bourgeois snob!

361
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:30,536
Really! I mean he thinks I want to
experience how the other half live...

362
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,836
And that's why I went to
Gobind bhaiyya's slum.

363
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:35,045
Oh you went to a slum?

364
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:39,644
Ya, that's where Gobind bhaiyya lives.
I went to watch his kids dance.

365
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:42,480
They're so good. I got it on video.

366
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:56,498
Ma, did you know that
Kaju had gone to a slum?

367
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,836
No. When did she go?

368
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:04,873
Ma shouldn't you at least be keeping track of
where the child is going, what she's up to?

369
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:06,976
She doesn't exactly listen to anyone!

370
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:08,910
Actually, the whole generation is the same.

371
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:11,209
Tuki for instance,
is going around with a boyfriend.

372
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:14,216
She thinks I have no idea.
She's totally neglecting her studies.

373
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,878
Boyfriend? So what?

374
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:20,685
If she won't have a boyfriend at this age,
then when? At mine?

375
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,688
Oh hi Kabir. What's up?

376
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:27,559
Look I'm really sorry.

377
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,098
Oh that's ok.

378
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:30,498
I just say these things sometimes that I...

379
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:31,727
That's OK.

380
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:32,633
I don't know...

381
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:35,172
OK. But this is your last warning.

382
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:36,331
So what else has been happening?

383
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,940
Not much. My Mom's just arrived.

384
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:45,908
Oh! That's nice. So I guess you don't have
time to meet for tea today. Hmm?

385
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:52,652
So silly L!

386
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:02,895
Delicious!

387
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:16,036
You won't believe it. I just feel
I breathe differently when I'm in India.

388
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,744
I never want to go back when I'm here.

389
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:21,182
Why don't you stay?

390
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:26,546
How can I stay L?
I've got my whole life, my politics...

391
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:29,591
You'll just get right back
into the swing of things.

392
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:34,721
You know we are really organizing now.
Why don't you giv e it a try.

393
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:42,005
I don't know. I think when I was young
I used to say I was born in New York.

394
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,605
But I guess it's only now that
I really want to find out. You know?

395
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:48,773
Well your Mom's home.
Can't she help you find out?

396
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:51,077
At least the names of your birth parents.

397
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,773
She doesn't know any more.

398
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:57,781
I mean whenever I try to talk to her
about it, it's like this wall goes up.

399
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:01,048
I mean I guess its hard for her. It's frustrating.

400
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,548
How's work?

401
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,580
It's going pretty well thanks.

402
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,685
With?

403
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:37,884
I'm working with migrant workers.
It's pretty tough.

404
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:41,292
They're a very very discriminated section.

405
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,263
How's Kaju?

406
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:49,596
She's fine thanks.
Single mothers aren't all that bad!

407
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:59,381
I tried to call you a few times.
I hung up when I heard a different voice.

408
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:01,985
Why did you bother Neel?

409
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,786
Because I still care.

410
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,828
Keya, I'm sorry.

411
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:18,058
Now when I think back... I think you
made the right decision. I'm sorry.

412
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:29,540
I hope Kaju's grown up to be
the kind of person you wanted her to be.

413
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:31,515
Ya.

414
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:42,024
I've told you a thousand times
to always carry her towel.

415
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,584
Nothing will happen. She's big now,
she goes to school.

416
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,253
What if she feels like vomiting?

417
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,328
Look at those lovely vegetables there.

418
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:11,447
Kaju! Hurry up! My uncle's waiting for us.

419
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:17,222
We couldn't even sleep at night
until we heard the train.

420
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,967
Are you coming?

421
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:09,772
I know this place.

422
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:21,214
Gobind was very naughty.
Always busy playing not studying.

423
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:29,293
Then Balbir Singh, our neighbor, said
"Why don't you send him to my cafe?

424
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:35,228
He'll learn some work."
Balbir Singh was a great guy.

425
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:40,533
Uncle, must you talk so much?
Always blathering on with your stories.

426
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:43,747
They're not here to listen to your fables.

427
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:49,451
No, no Uncle, do tell us. Why did Gobind's
father move from here to Sanjay Colony?

428
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:58,019
Son, till '84 we all lived together.
Then half of our slum burned down.

429
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:03,333
A lot of people left their homes.
My brother had to take care of the cafe.

430
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:09,863
Uncle, they've come here for the first time.
And you've started in with your sob story.

431
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,575
Is this the time for such stories?

432
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:20,182
But how did the slum burn down?
Was there a fire?

433
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:26,251
It wasn't accidental. The fire
was deliberately set. Riots, fire...

434
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,150
Riots.

435
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:34,226
You're talking about the '84 riots, right?

436
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:39,102
Yes, the terrible riots of 1984 in the
aftermath of Indira Gandhi's assassination.

437
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:42,505
Sikhs made up more than half of this colony.

438
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:47,401
Anyone who had a
turban or a beard was targeted.

439
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:53,481
The whole city of Delhi was burning.
Over five thousand Sikhs were killed.

440
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:56,844
But why did they kill Sikhs?

441
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,881
One more! One more song!

442
00:38:26,184 --> 00:38:28,550
Okay, okay. Another song.
Which one?

443
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:57,472
Hey, look everyone! Look how stunning
Kaju is in a sari.

444
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,716
Kaju, please sing a song now. I'm really tired.

445
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,722
I don't sing. Please.

446
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:11,084
You guys haven't seen her dance.
Tuki just put on her CD.

447
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:16,966
Ma, I really don't wanna dance.

448
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:27,171
Come on sweetheart.

449
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:31,941
OK. Hold on a second. This is difficult.

450
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:44,486
Is something the matter?
Usually you love to dance.

451
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:49,127
I don't know Ma. I'm just
not feeling good inside.

452
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,933
Maybe... I don't kow...
maybe I ate something bad.

453
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,568
I thought you ate with Kabir in a coffeeshop.

454
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:59,209
I did but then... we went to
Gobind bhaiyya's jhuggi and...

455
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:04,341
Did you know about these horrible riots?
I mean most of his slum was burnt down.

456
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:06,707
In Trilokenagar.

457
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,879
What happened, what happened? Are y ou OK?

458
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,682
Brother, how much did y ou give me to drink?

459
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,220
Mishti just serve the food now.

460
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:17,360
No I'm fine.
Nothing's happened Ma.

461
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:22,592
Ha! Match!

462
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:25,529
Well played kiddo.

463
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:29,996
You need a little more practice.

464
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:32,269
Remind me to give y ou a
two game head start next time!

465
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,200
I was letting you win.

466
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:36,075
Ha! You wish.

467
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:45,617
By the way were we in Delhi
during the '84 riots?

468
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:48,417
I was talking to a friend yesterday
and I couldn't quite remember.

469
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:54,830
No. Why do you have to
bother with such things now.

470
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:58,367
Don't tell me this was the urgent thing
you called me about in office yesterday.

471
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:02,599
No actually Dad, I need a favor. Could you find
out through the health ministry or something?

472
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:07,243
There was this epidemic in '85
in Chandan Hola. And a friend of mine...

473
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,370
Anything for y ou son.
Just bring him over anytime.

474
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:15,408
Actually I did ask her, Kaju that is,
to Sunday lunch.

475
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:17,587
Oh like that huh?

476
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:18,712
Please it's hardly like that!

477
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,155
Well it's about time.

478
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:28,997
Namaste. I'm Kaju. Is Kabir here?

479
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,963
Just go straight down the hall.
Everyone's in the back garden.

480
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:38,239
My God! This is Kabir's house!

481
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:42,542
God. I really had no idea. He's really rich ha?

482
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:45,011
So many paintings in the hall!

483
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,777
Ya. It's beautiful.

484
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:51,550
But this place is never ending.

485
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:55,249
Kabir's house! One sec.

486
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:02,692
You're so lucky Mira - to have Ramu.
Servants these days...

487
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:06,935
By the way did I tell y ou?
Ranvir's got into Harvard.

488
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,102
Wonderful. Congratulations.

489
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,499
And what are Kabir's plans?

490
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:16,872
Well I hope he does something
daring and imaginative...

491
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,248
So he doesn't end up like the rest of us!

492
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:22,251
Such a riot Meera!

493
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,685
Would you'll like another drink?

494
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:25,153
Maybe a shandy.

495
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:26,656
Could you put a little vodka into this?

496
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,748
Scotch on the rocks!

497
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,354
And then Lady Mountbatten says,
"Driver, show me the place where you pee.

498
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:40,026
The driver turns around and says,
"Madam first y ou show me yours!"

499
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:44,967
Well I guess I'm shocked because
I just found out about it.

500
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:48,337
I mean over 5000 people killed
in one city in 3 days.

501
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,782
I mean not that many people
were killed in 9/11.

502
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,874
And no one knows about it.
In the world I mean.

503
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:58,612
It's better that they not know about it.
Why project this ugly part of India?

504
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:00,757
We must have a good image abroad.

505
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:03,853
You see it's a very complex history.

506
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:09,032
But I have a very simple question. I mean, no
matter what the deeper causes for this event...

507
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,397
or the prov ocation - how come the cops
couldn't stop the rioters for 3 days?

508
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,994
Exactly!

509
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:16,198
I can see you're an American.

510
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:19,607
Our police aren't as efficient as your LAPD.

511
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:22,008
They should be trained by the Americans.

512
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,546
What rubbish! They were completely efficient

513
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:27,015
when they had to arrest
50,000 people under TADA.

514
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:29,312
That's just like the Patriot Act.

515
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,282
Don't listen to him. He's an artist.

516
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,318
But I'll tell you who can answer your questions.

517
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:36,654
Arun!

518
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:40,393
Weren't you in charge of
something or the other in 1984?

519
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:47,996
Lunch is getting cold everyone.
Shall we go? Come on.

520
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:56,068
Mr Sehgal, what exactly were you
in charge of during the Delhi Riots?

521
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,113
It must have been awful.

522
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,545
Ah. So you're the one who's got my
son interested in these kinds of things.

523
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:04,985
No...
Dad this has nothing to do with...

524
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:07,816
And are you the one who
was born in Chandan Hola?

525
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:10,156
I was going through the records...

526
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:12,058
Oh did you find something?

527
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:13,755
Didn't Kabir tell you?

528
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:15,889
Sir, a call for you.
Just a moment.

529
00:44:16,534 --> 00:44:18,058
I was going to tell you. I was going to tell you.

530
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:22,438
Show me the jhumkis you have.

531
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,706
You wanted those jhumkis na?
Those jhumkis are those hanging things.

532
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:29,178
There are different designs...

533
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,639
These are a bit big. I want the small ones.

534
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:34,347
These are the big ones
and these are the small.

535
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:40,046
Yes, these are very pretty.
Can you pass me that mirror?

536
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:45,254
Look darling you look so pretty in it.
Look, isn't that pretty?

537
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,693
Give me both these pairs.
How much?

538
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:50,961
Seven hundred rupees.

539
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:55,796
Seven Hundred!
Do you think we're foreigners?!

540
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:03,869
So you never told me about the Sehgal lunch.
Who all were there?

541
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:06,506
Was it fun?

542
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:15,081
What's the matter? Did somebody
say something to upset you?

543
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:18,627
What is it Kaju?

544
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:23,057
Why did y ou tell me my parents
died in an epidemic in Chandan Hola?

545
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:25,365
Because they did.

546
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:29,704
There was no such thing!
There was no epidemic.

547
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:33,009
What do you mean? Who told you that?

548
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:35,508
It doesn't matter. The point is there was no...

549
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:40,079
Of course it matters Kaju.
They don't know what they're talking about.

550
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:45,186
It was Kabir. His father checked the health
ministry records for Chandan Hola in 1985...

551
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:48,649
Why should Kabir ask his father
to do such a thing.

552
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:50,960
Mother you're avoiding the question.

553
00:45:51,095 --> 00:45:57,500
No I'm not. That's all I know. That's
exactly what the adoption agency told me.

554
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:00,861
Where's the agency?

555
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:08,269
Kaju, don't you remember? When you first
asked me in LA. I told you this.

556
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:15,277
The adoption agency doesn't exist anymore.
It's been seventeen or eighteen years.

557
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:19,479
Ya, but there've got to be some papers.
The papers will mention something for sure.

558
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,684
Where are they?

559
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,094
I think... your grandfather had them.

560
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:48,411
What are you looking for?

561
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:51,716
I was just looking
for some scotchtape actually.

562
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:54,655
Ma the prawns are burning.

563
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,456
The prawns are getting burnt. I'll be back.

564
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,712
When do we meet for lunch son?

565
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:56,177
Outside Basil and Thyme. And don't be late.

566
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:02,890
Do you have any books on the '84 Delhi Riots?

567
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,324
Delhi Riots? No, I'm afraid
there's nothing available.

568
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:06,589
Nothing?

569
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:07,493
Nothing at all.

570
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:12,926
What do you want a book on the '84 riots for?

571
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:20,332
I'll tell you later okay? Listen there's
a call coming through. I'll just call you back.

572
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:26,939
Hello. Hi Kaju? What happened?

573
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,720
No, wait I'm coming. Ya. Ya.

574
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:36,523
Just wait there okay? Bye.

575
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,361
Bela just chop the onions.

576
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:58,399
Mishti, let's go out for Chinese today.
Don't cook. I'm just going up for a bit.

577
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,906
Ma, why didn't you tell me my mother
died in Trilokenagar?

578
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:08,541
What are you talking about?

579
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:12,483
I found this in your stuff.
I'm sorry I broke into your trunk.

580
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,758
You did what? How dare you do that Kaju?

581
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:19,761
How could you not tell me this?

582
00:50:20,064 --> 00:50:23,522
What are you doing?
You've no right to do that.

583
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:26,396
Right? Did you have the right
to keep this from me?

584
00:50:26,537 --> 00:50:29,973
Don't talk to me like that.
I was going to tell you.

585
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,474
When? I've been begging you for any small
detail since the time that I can remember...

586
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,306
When were y ou going to tell me?

587
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:47,221
Ma. I'm talking to you.

588
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,794
I thought the... the slum
would bring back bad memories.

589
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,956
I didn't want to open those up for you.

590
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,295
Hi ev eryone.

591
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:06,465
So did my parents move from
the village to the slum or what?

592
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:07,703
What slum?

593
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:11,813
It turns out my parents used to
live in Gobind bhaiyya's slum.

594
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:19,044
Oh my God! No wonder you couldn't
remember anything in the village.

595
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:22,351
When we went there?
And you were trying so hard, remember?

596
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:25,962
Ya. I must have been a baby then.

597
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,022
Wait a second. Where did you
get the death certificate?

598
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:32,226
Ma should I intervene?

599
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:34,803
From the adoption agency.

600
00:51:36,874 --> 00:51:40,537
The ones that made the mistake
about the epidemic?

601
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:45,280
I thought they told y ou
my parents died in the village.

602
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:48,713
But why would they say that if they
had the death certificate all along.

603
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:51,650
What's going on Ma?

604
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,201
Was there ev en a village?

605
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:41,129
You're back?

606
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:44,139
Taken over my desk already.

607
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:48,800
Er just give me two minutes. I'm on the net.

608
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:54,173
Oh. I think I know what you're up to.
It's okay. Take your time!

609
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:13,330
Pass the lentils please.

610
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,640
Our fishmonger was carrying on
as if he'd caught the fish...

611
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,835
...in Bangladesh himself!
Just taste it and see.

612
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:31,188
Keya, I'll take you to
our music rehearsal.

613
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:32,951
The woman who can't sing at all...

614
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:35,719
she always likes to stand
in front of everyone!

615
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,652
Kaju darling, you're not eating anything.

616
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:41,999
Would you like some rotis?

617
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:44,365
Bela, quickly! Make some rotis.

618
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:47,232
I don't feel like it Aunty. Excuse me.

619
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:11,125
Brother. I can't cope anymore.

620
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:17,823
I just feel like I'm messing up so badly.

621
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:24,329
You must think that too. I know Neel does.

622
00:54:25,108 --> 00:54:27,235
Don't listen to him.

623
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:33,038
You're the one who's handled everything.
He didn't have to deal with anything.

624
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:37,882
Do you remember
when she was five y ears old...

625
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:41,886
when she first asked you...

626
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:45,152
You freaked out and frantically called us.

627
00:54:45,262 --> 00:54:47,253
Father was still alive then.

628
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:51,461
We all agreed. "She's too young.
You don't have to tell her now."

629
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:55,798
But she's not a child anymore.

630
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:04,444
Ya. I know you're right.
She's just grown up so fast.

631
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:13,616
After finding out everything what if she...

632
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:17,190
what will she think of me?

633
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:27,595
I'm feeling very scared.

634
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,009
I don't know I feel kind of bad now.

635
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:38,205
I mean they didn't mean to. Poor Gran.

636
00:55:38,415 --> 00:55:40,713
Look don't blame y ourself at all.

637
00:55:40,784 --> 00:55:43,082
It was brave enough for you
to confront them in the first place.

638
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,189
Ya but what was the point.
I still know nothing about my parents.

639
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,819
Are y ou carrying the death certificate
with you? It has a name on it?

640
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,194
Ya but it was all smudged.
I could not make out anything.

641
00:55:56,366 --> 00:55:58,061
Let me see.

642
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:14,611
Shan - it could be Shannu
or maybe Shanno?

643
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:18,582
Or Shanti. It could even be Shanta.

644
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:24,421
Leela you are too good.
You should do crosswords.

645
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:27,463
What do you think?
I've passed the eighth grade.

646
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:30,863
I have decided that I will
finish High School with my children.

647
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:37,272
In fact, I bet I can guess the last name too.
What were the letters?

648
00:56:37,374 --> 00:56:39,740
It starts with the letter K
and ends with the letter R.

649
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:43,903
It could be Kaur.
It could be Kakkar or Kanwar.

650
00:56:44,715 --> 00:56:48,151
It could even be Kumar. Didn't Uncle
keep talking about a Kumar?

651
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:51,521
Try and remember.
Lo! Why did you stop working the pump?

652
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,716
I'll be back. I've got some work to do.

653
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:55,959
What! Just now you wanted roti.
Told me to make rotis.

654
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:59,196
Amazing man! Won't eat roti,
won't push the pump!

655
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:04,156
Hey, bring back some squash.
Wants to eat squash, eat this, eat that...

656
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:06,701
Really, this man!
Look - left a pen in his pocket.

657
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:12,070
You work the pump at a good speed.
Do you also do this in America?

658
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:14,673
How much would a pump be there?

659
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:20,178
Do you think Gobind's uncle
knows any Shanno or Shanta?

660
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:23,648
There's no guarantee with Uncle!

661
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:26,984
But there is an old lady called Durga Aunty
who knows everything and everyone.

662
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:30,855
What I say is let's eat lunch here
and take our evening tea with her.

663
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:32,827
You see, sugar prices have really gone up!

664
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,993
Maybe that could be it. Shanti Kumar.

665
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:38,660
Did she have any children?

666
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:42,461
Yes, she had a daughter.
I can't remember the girl's name.

667
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:46,937
And Shanti... what about her?
What happened to her?

668
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:51,880
I don't know.
I don't know where she went.

669
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:57,142
When... where?
Where and when would she have left?

670
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:00,748
I don't remember the date.

671
00:58:02,793 --> 00:58:06,092
Wait... she was here until '84.
She left after that.

672
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:12,100
During the riots?
Were they Sikh?

673
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:14,261
How could she be Sikh?

674
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:17,033
Shanti Kumar is a Hindu name.

675
00:58:17,674 --> 00:58:21,075
Aunty, try to remember clearly.
Where would she have gone?

676
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:27,580
As I was saying, it was during '84.
We were all sitting in the train.

677
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:31,583
And the little girl was with us too.

678
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:38,756
Indira Gandhi has been killed.

679
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:42,094
Her bodyguards did it. They were both Sikh.

680
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,993
These Sikhs have to be taught a lesson.

681
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:48,798
Shit! They killed the Prime Minister!

682
00:58:54,411 --> 00:58:57,608
They seem to be attacking Sikhs.
These guys are in real danger.

683
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:00,675
Sir! Sir! You have to hide!

684
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,352
There's only space for one person
to hide here.

685
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:08,883
Cut your hair.

686
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:11,493
You have to cut your hair.

687
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:13,858
I hav e a pair of scissors.

688
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:16,224
Please... No!

689
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:18,367
They're coming! Do it!

690
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:20,197
Hurry up! Hurry up!!

691
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:22,134
They're breaking the door down!

692
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:36,075
Bring out the bastards! Go and look ahead!

693
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:39,349
Sir, if there were any Sikhs here,
you think we would have spared them?

694
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:41,890
There aren't any here. You should go on.

695
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:44,721
They eat our food and kill
our leaders. The swine!

696
00:59:44,794 --> 00:59:47,763
Do you think we'd let these bastards live?
Don't worry - go!

697
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:49,492
Who is that?

698
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:50,800
He's my son.

699
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,068
What's the matter with him?

700
00:59:52,068 --> 00:59:54,104
Suresh lyer. He's got a fever.

701
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:56,673
We are Mr. And Mrs. Lyer. This is our son.

702
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:58,197
There are no Sikhs here.

703
00:59:58,275 --> 01:00:00,505
Okay. Okay. Let's mov e on.

704
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:15,254
Kaju. You don't have to do this you know.
I mean we can just go back.

705
01:00:16,226 --> 01:00:18,956
It's okay not to find out.

706
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:23,657
I don't want to find out. But I can't stop myself.

707
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:54,221
Excuse me. We're looking for someone
called Shanti. Shanti... from Trilokenagar.

708
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:57,155
We heard that she lives here now.

709
01:00:59,703 --> 01:01:02,001
Shanti, some people are here to meet you.

710
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:17,218
Yes? I don't recognize you...

711
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:24,182
Actually, Kaju was born in
Trilokenagar - in 1981.

712
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:28,020
Until 1985 she lived there with her parents.

713
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,527
We think they may have died in 1985.

714
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:38,630
We found out that her
mother's name was Shanti.

715
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:44,038
I lived there too - in Trilokenagar.

716
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:48,713
But I have a son, not a daughter.

717
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,414
Son, please come in.

718
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:58,120
Come, children. Sit.

719
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:03,792
Do you know Durga Aunty?
She was with you on a train in '84.

720
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:10,399
Those were bad times.
That night when I came back...

721
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:16,668
Shanti hid my entire family in her house.

722
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,241
And that's why they burned her house down.

723
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:25,477
But how did it all start?

724
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:30,756
I had disguised my son in a brown kurta...

725
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:35,162
...and a white pajama just like yours.

726
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:38,300
He looked like a pretty girl - my son did.

727
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:43,495
He was scared. He said,
"Mummy, I'm not going out."

728
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:47,565
I said, "Son, no one will
realize you are a boy."

729
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:52,177
There was a mob in the alley.
The politician was there too.

730
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:57,012
He pointed and said,
"Hey, that's Kulbir Singh's wife...

731
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:01,086
and they don't hav e a daughter.
Catch them!"

732
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:05,392
They removed my son's pajama.

733
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:08,724
Wicked politician!

734
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:12,130
They killed my son.

735
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:14,893
A politician did it?

736
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:19,638
Indeed, a member of the gov ernment.
It was all under his supervision.

737
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:21,606
He gave the orders.

738
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:25,179
But not all government officials were involved.

739
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:27,340
It must have been just
a few bad politicians - no?

740
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,777
All of them were inv olved.

741
01:03:30,153 --> 01:03:34,522
Police, bureaucrats, government,
politicians - the whole lot.

742
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:40,218
But there must have been some good officials
too... in the police and the government?

743
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:43,523
Son, the question is not of one or two people.

744
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:47,132
For twenty years we've been
banging on the doors of justice.

745
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:51,671
Ten thousand people were killed.
Twenty years have gone by!

746
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:57,168
Governments have changed.
One party comes into power, the other goes.

747
01:03:57,547 --> 01:04:01,916
The second goes and the third comes.
But we didn't get justice.

748
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:07,378
My son's killers roam the streets.
No court has punished them.

749
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:13,662
Ma'am, in our courts it takes years.
On top of that, there's corruption.

750
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:17,663
So with circumstances like these
justice may take a while.

751
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:21,596
Justice is delivered.
When it suits them.

752
01:04:21,704 --> 01:04:23,865
Two of the killers of November '84
were punished...

753
01:04:24,707 --> 01:04:27,574
The killers of Indira Gandhi!

754
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:44,082
It's all very well for you to sit here and lecture.

755
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:47,588
Hav e you ever been in a riot?

756
01:04:48,264 --> 01:04:51,392
You've bloody well been
sheltered your whole life.

757
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:55,635
There's no point talking about this.

758
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,964
I've decided not to do an MBA.

759
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:02,369
Ah. So you're taking advice from... from Kaju?

760
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:07,476
I'm writing a play.
And you should read it sometime.

761
01:05:10,453 --> 01:05:14,412
It's called "1984: That Black Night."

762
01:05:15,558 --> 01:05:19,619
It's about what people did and did not do.

763
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:29,972
Ev ery Tom, Dick and Harry
has Kumar as a last name!

764
01:05:30,406 --> 01:05:32,306
Even well known film stars...

765
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:37,713
Gobind, wasn't that thug also called Kumar?

766
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:42,352
You're too much, Uncle! Sometimes
you bring up such irrelevant stuff.

767
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:43,720
But what was his name?

768
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,021
I don't know.

769
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:47,922
Kaju, he was the one
who killed our Balbir.

770
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:52,155
Balbir was our Sikh neighbor.

771
01:05:53,196 --> 01:05:55,494
We hid his family.

772
01:05:55,865 --> 01:06:01,428
We thought no one would find out.
But I don't know how that thug KK found out.

773
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:05,774
Yes! That was his name.
KK. Kishan Kumar.

774
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:08,740
He was our neighborhood's small time thug.

775
01:06:09,078 --> 01:06:12,878
He was no small time thug.
He was a big gangster.

776
01:06:13,082 --> 01:06:15,642
He had connections with many big politicians.

777
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:19,854
And he carried this huge knife
with him at all times.

778
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:24,727
Uncle, listen to me once and for all.
He didn't kill Balbir.

779
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:28,523
He did kill him.
I saw it with my own eyes.

780
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:31,826
He dragged Balbir out of the house.

781
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:38,503
The mob drenched Balbir in kerosene.
And KK lit a match.

782
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:42,267
Balbir started screaming.

783
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:47,883
My brother and I wrapped him in a blanket
and took him to the hospital.

784
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:51,115
By evening he was dead.

785
01:06:51,587 --> 01:06:54,215
It was KK, Kishan Kumar
who killed him.

786
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:56,655
Didn't I tell you he didn't kill Uncle Balbir?

787
01:06:56,893 --> 01:06:59,453
Why are you defending that bastard?

788
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:02,187
He did not kill Uncle Balbir!

789
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,027
I killed him!

790
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:10,199
And now I live off his cafe.

791
01:07:11,274 --> 01:07:12,866
I'm telling the truth.

792
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:17,975
When you sent me outside...

793
01:07:19,582 --> 01:07:21,573
I ran into KK.

794
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:28,384
He recognized me. He held the knife
against my throat and demanded,

795
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:33,455
"You work for Balbir, don't you?"
"Tell me where he's hiding."

796
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:38,662
I kept screaming, shouting
"I don't know anything. I don't know anything."

797
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:44,606
But in a rage he stabbed me here.
See this. Here.

798
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:51,772
I called for Father, I called for you.
Why didn't you come?

799
01:07:52,982 --> 01:07:57,180
You sent me alone outside to
find out what was happening?

800
01:07:57,754 --> 01:08:02,054
If I hadn't told him,
he would have killed me.

801
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,231
That's why... I told him.

802
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:21,409
Gobind, my son...
You were just a child.

803
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:27,347
How could it be your fault, son?
How could it be y our fault?

804
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:40,019
I killed Uncle Balbir.
And I didn't tell any one until now.

805
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:43,628
She just never wants to talk to me about it.

806
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:45,564
Kaju dear, listen to me.

807
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:48,733
Why won't she talk to me. What is it?

808
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,335
I mean I just found out all this stuff today.

809
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:59,670
All these gruesome killings and
a slum that was burnt down...

810
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:04,108
What did my birth parents do?
What did you all do?

811
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:09,114
Kaju sweetie, if as you think,
all Hindus were responsible for these killings

812
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:14,191
there would not have been a single
Sikh left alive in the entire city of Delhi.

813
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,166
What about y ou all? What did you guys do?

814
01:09:24,307 --> 01:09:27,333
What do you think?

815
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:40,389
Excuse me, which one is KK's auto?

816
01:09:42,091 --> 01:09:43,490
Boss?

817
01:09:43,659 --> 01:09:45,092
What?

818
01:09:45,428 --> 01:09:47,623
Somebody's asking for you.

819
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:49,688
Tell them I don't want to take them.

820
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,324
Boss it's not a customer,
it's someone to meet you.

821
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:58,766
Who in the hell has been born to meet me!
Won't even let me sleep in peace.

822
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:08,843
Is y our name Kishan Kumar?

823
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:10,609
And if it is?

824
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:13,544
I wanted to talk to y ou about something.

825
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:15,248
Be my guest!

826
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:22,091
Here? Let's talk over a... umm cup of tea?

827
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:25,964
Let's go.

828
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:38,803
Just ask me what you want straight out.
Don't beat around the bush like a cop.

829
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:45,618
I don't like all this beating around the bush.
Tell me what you want.

830
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:50,819
What happened to your family?

831
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:56,556
They must be dead. What do I care?

832
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:01,360
And your daughter?

833
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:04,730
Must be in an orphanage
or in a brothel...

834
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:08,469
Do you remember the '84 riots?

835
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:18,209
What riots?
I was not a part of any riots.

836
01:11:25,094 --> 01:11:30,862
No one goes and confronts those who gave
us the kerosene to burn the Sikhs alive.

837
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:36,968
Those who gave us electoral rolls to identify
the Sikh houses and kill every Sikh.

838
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:42,806
You're scared of them because
they live in grand government bungalows.

839
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:45,471
We only followed orders. That's all.

840
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:49,343
You followed orders.?
Then who killed my Uncle Balbir?

841
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:53,480
I'll kill you - you dog.
I'll drink your blood!

842
01:12:28,624 --> 01:12:31,593
I just can't stop my teeth from chattering.

843
01:12:33,262 --> 01:12:36,595
Kaju he's not your father you know.

844
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:39,135
His name begins with K and ends in R.

845
01:12:39,135 --> 01:12:40,336
So what?

846
01:12:40,336 --> 01:12:42,201
He lived in Trilokenagar.

847
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:44,940
Yes which has a population
of a 1,000 if not more.

848
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,238
He had a daughter. The daughter got adopted.

849
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:49,869
I mean, all that added up -
it can't be a coincidence.

850
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,743
Yes it can.

851
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:58,019
You're too beautiful to be his daughter.

852
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:04,254
There's no way a man like that
can be your father.

853
01:13:05,494 --> 01:13:10,022
Why not? You think
killers don't have families?

854
01:13:10,966 --> 01:13:13,264
We just found out about these politicians

855
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:16,395
who go around in fancy cars
and live in big mansions.

856
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:19,475
You think if he'd been like them
and you'd seen him in your living room

857
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:21,170
you'd hav e been okay with him?

858
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:26,745
Kabir, y ou have to face up to the fact
that I'm a kid from the slums.

859
01:13:29,552 --> 01:13:37,982
Kaju, what your father or my father did
or did not do has... has nothing to do with us;

860
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:45,327
has nothing to do with...
it has nothing to do with you and me.

861
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:46,585
Kaju, we're leaving for the cultural function.

862
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:48,815
I'll explain to Kabir okay?

863
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:51,791
Listen take care. Try to catch some of it.

864
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:55,353
I will. Best of luck. Thanks Tuki.

865
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:59,465
Aunty, Kaju said we should
carry on. She'll walk.

866
01:15:59,568 --> 01:16:01,900
Come on, come on. It's getting late.

867
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:23,649
She's wearing a sari!

868
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:26,387
Aunt. I want you to meet Siddharth.
He's just walked in with Kabir!

869
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:28,494
I think we should start now.

870
01:16:28,697 --> 01:16:30,631
Best of luck everyone.

871
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:41,169
Despite hearing the cries for help
From the millions along your vast banks...

872
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:44,672
I don't know why Kaju's late.

873
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,405
Umm she said she might be awhile.

874
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:48,609
Ya. But just call her up. It's really getting late.

875
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:54,451
How can you, O River Ganga, roll along
- indifferent, silent, listless!

876
01:16:59,194 --> 01:17:01,355
Actually I don't know if
she'll be at home right now.

877
01:17:01,964 --> 01:17:04,455
Where else would she be?

878
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,166
She went to some cafe.

879
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:10,272
Cafe? What do y ou mean cafe?

880
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:12,832
Tuki what is happening?

881
01:17:12,975 --> 01:17:16,968
Umm. She said she had to go meet
someone who might be her Dad.

882
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:19,071
What!

883
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:20,839
Actually I know what's happening.

884
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:25,880
O River Ganga, O Ganga
why do you keep rolling along?

885
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:28,324
Where is Kaju? Where is she?

886
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:29,916
This is in Gobindpuri.

887
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:35,262
Tuki just go. Just go straight away and
get the car key from your Dad. Just go Tuki!

888
01:17:35,397 --> 01:17:37,533
Let me come with you. I - I know the place.

889
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,694
Kabir, just give me the directions.

890
01:17:40,235 --> 01:17:43,033
Witnessing the fall of mankind...

891
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:46,299
Shamelessly, lazily -
how can you just keep rolling along?

892
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:51,972
Why don't you imbue people with the spirit
of a thousand years of turbulence

893
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:02,120
Inspire them to become
fearless fighters?

894
01:18:10,299 --> 01:18:15,259
When the world has become self-serving
Debased and rudderless

895
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:19,102
Why don't you tear it apart?

896
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:52,463
Oh god Kaju. Come, come
we have to get out of here.

897
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:05,018
Don't cry like that my darling.
Whoever that man is he's not your father.

898
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:08,983
He is. Don't try and shield me from the truth.

899
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:15,063
You're right. You are strong
enough to know the truth.

900
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:25,130
Your father was a good man. His name
was not Kumar. It was Gurbachan Singh.

901
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:28,943
What are you kids doing here?

902
01:19:29,178 --> 01:19:33,672
Come on inside - your Mother's calling.
Come here, my baby.

903
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:36,778
Come on children, come for lunch.

904
01:19:37,019 --> 01:19:41,979
And your mother.
Her name was Shanno. Shanno Kaur.

905
01:19:45,094 --> 01:19:47,289
Come quickly.
The food's getting cold.

906
01:19:47,463 --> 01:19:50,660
And you had a little baby brother. Arjun.

907
01:19:50,732 --> 01:19:52,165
What's the matter with Arjun?

908
01:19:52,234 --> 01:19:54,031
I don't know. He just started crying.

909
01:19:54,136 --> 01:19:56,263
Was there a fight between them?

910
01:19:56,738 --> 01:20:01,198
What about my name?
Was I always called Kaju?

911
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:05,742
No. Your name was Amrit.

912
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:09,642
Your brother named you Amu.

913
01:20:09,885 --> 01:20:14,845
And then that's what everybody
called you. Amu.

914
01:20:21,463 --> 01:20:27,060
Will Amu have it or Ma?
Come, feed your brother also.

915
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,902
What's all this commotion?

916
01:20:37,646 --> 01:20:39,375
Some people are running.

917
01:20:39,581 --> 01:20:41,048
Should I go take a look?

918
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:43,151
No, finish your food first.

919
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:53,420
What was that?

920
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:58,591
Shanno, you stay here.
I'll go take a look.

921
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,826
No, don't go! Don't go outside!
Don't go outside.

922
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:06,033
Don't be scared, I'm taking the dagger
with me - y ou stay with the kids.

923
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:17,274
Kids, come here. Don't make any sound,
okay? Just sit here quietly.

924
01:21:20,622 --> 01:21:22,988
Shanno, Shanno, go get the police!

925
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:26,726
Amu! Ajju!
Don't move until I come back!

926
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:31,922
Bring my Mommy to me!

927
01:21:38,073 --> 01:21:41,702
What have I done?

928
01:21:51,853 --> 01:21:54,981
Leave him! He hasn't done anything. Let go!

929
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,796
Help! Help!

930
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:12,029
Beat them! Kill them! Burn them!
No Sikh should escape!

931
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:16,141
I haven't done anything.

932
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:34,255
Help me! Help me, please!

933
01:22:34,429 --> 01:22:36,897
Off with y ou! Be gone!

934
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:39,757
Is anyone there? Save us. Save us.

935
01:22:44,206 --> 01:22:45,537
Amu!

936
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:46,975
My brother's in there! Stop!

937
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:48,340
Amu! Ma!

938
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:06,254
Save us. Please.

939
01:23:06,528 --> 01:23:09,759
Burn all Sikhs.
Don't leav e a single one alive!

940
01:23:10,332 --> 01:23:11,890
Ma. Arjun!

941
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:23,342
Wait! I'm coming!

942
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:38,586
My baby brother. I couldn't do
anything to save my baby brother.

943
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:42,416
Darling, you were only a baby yourself.
How could you have done anything?

944
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:47,584
It was so organized. They were all involved.
The government, the police.

945
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:50,628
Thousands of families were destroyed.

946
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:55,467
And you? Did you know my mother?

947
01:24:56,705 --> 01:24:59,299
I met you and your mother in a relief camp.

948
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:07,880
It was ordinary people and the Sikh temples
that set up these camps. Not the government.

949
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:18,156
It's just awful. These are
the most awful cases.

950
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,293
She's lost 9 children.
Her daughters were raped.

951
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:24,927
What's the use of just making lists?
We have to do something.

952
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:29,169
Namaste Comrade. Do you have enough?

953
01:25:29,337 --> 01:25:32,829
These are from Sultanpuri.
Yes, here you go sir.

954
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:34,899
Do we have enough now?

955
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:37,672
I think we'll fall short.
We'll need to ask for some more.

956
01:25:39,047 --> 01:25:43,143
Do you know where Shanno and Amu are?
I'll just see where they are.

957
01:25:51,726 --> 01:25:56,686
Amu! See, my child,
what your Aunty has brought you.

958
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:03,326
What all have I brought you today?
Sit here. And I'll just show you.

959
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:12,139
I've got you a sketch book
and crayons.

960
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:24,147
What's wrong?

961
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:28,796
You didn't come yesterday, sister?
Why didn't you come yesterday?

962
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:33,499
Yesterday I had to go to that other camp.
Why, did something happen y esterday?

963
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:39,729
Everyone was calling me mad.
Forcibly shutting me up.

964
01:26:40,108 --> 01:26:41,632
But why?

965
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:44,936
Yesterday that politician had come.
To distribute blankets.

966
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,444
The one with the dark glasses.

967
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:50,779
I threw the blankets in his face.

968
01:26:51,219 --> 01:26:55,883
"I don't want blankets from murderers", I said.

969
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:04,287
And these people call me mad.
Am I mad or are they?

970
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:06,860
Which politician?

971
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:13,403
Sister, he is the same one that I had
gone to for help near the railway line.

972
01:27:14,943 --> 01:27:17,878
The day that... that...

973
01:27:21,182 --> 01:27:26,449
And he said, "Not one Sikh should survive."

974
01:27:27,355 --> 01:27:30,654
Shanno, you did absolutely the right thing.

975
01:27:31,026 --> 01:27:34,723
We'll file a report with the police.
You are a key witness.

976
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:38,764
Only then will you get justice, Shanno.

977
01:27:39,668 --> 01:27:43,399
Justice, sister?

978
01:27:44,172 --> 01:27:46,970
Will I get justice?

979
01:27:48,543 --> 01:27:51,068
Will I get my husband back?

980
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,807
Will Amu get her father back?

981
01:27:57,886 --> 01:28:00,411
Will Amu get her brother back?

982
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:06,091
Can I get my baby back?

983
01:28:09,764 --> 01:28:13,063
She was so brave - your mother.

984
01:28:20,575 --> 01:28:22,907
Then what happened?

985
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:27,413
My mother. What happened to my mother?

986
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:32,283
They wore her spirit down.

987
01:28:33,922 --> 01:28:38,154
How many times did she have to
go to that police station.

988
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,360
They didn't believe her.

989
01:28:42,464 --> 01:28:48,460
And even after three months the government
had not rehabilitated the victims.

990
01:28:50,605 --> 01:28:54,735
And the tragedy was she had to go back.

991
01:28:56,411 --> 01:29:01,371
To that room where the
little baby had been killed.

992
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,578
What happened here?

993
01:29:06,688 --> 01:29:07,780
She fell.

994
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:12,293
The girl fell? What happened to the boy?

995
01:29:12,761 --> 01:29:15,628
The boy is carrying the vegetables.

996
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:18,623
And what's this?

997
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:21,602
He's putting medicine. She got hurt.

998
01:29:21,903 --> 01:29:23,427
Oh! My father.

999
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:32,477
Amu, do you want to draw now?
Here's your slate. What will you draw?

1000
01:29:34,382 --> 01:29:35,474
Jug?

1001
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,414
Duck!

1002
01:29:36,484 --> 01:29:39,476
You'll draw a duck? Okay.
Can you draw an elephant too?

1003
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:40,053
No.

1004
01:29:40,121 --> 01:29:42,817
Okay. Draw whatever y ou feel like.

1005
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:48,492
I could do nothing to stop it.
I wish I...

1006
01:29:55,136 --> 01:30:02,269
I visited you. Almost everyday.
She seemed to be recovering.

1007
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,376
Shanno, I'm so late. I'm sorry.

1008
01:30:57,165 --> 01:31:01,101
Keya sister, today is my baby Arjun's birthday.

1009
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:05,198
I wanted to go to the Sikh temple
and pray for him.

1010
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:10,834
But as the day wore on,
my pain became unbearable.

1011
01:31:12,614 --> 01:31:16,710
Today is his birthday.
And he's dead.

1012
01:31:18,286 --> 01:31:22,450
Sister, I am leaving Amrit in your care.

1013
01:31:22,824 --> 01:31:25,588
She should not remember anything.

1014
01:31:26,194 --> 01:31:28,321
Not her father.

1015
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,464
Not her baby brother.

1016
01:31:30,899 --> 01:31:32,958
Not her mother.

1017
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:36,665
She should never know who she is.

1018
01:31:37,238 --> 01:31:40,401
She is young. She will forget everything.

1019
01:31:41,009 --> 01:31:44,206
Sister, I have one more request.

1020
01:31:45,613 --> 01:31:50,346
She should never know
that her mother left her.

1021
01:31:51,019 --> 01:31:54,455
That her mother could not live for her sake.

1022
01:31:55,156 --> 01:31:57,750
And chose to die instead.

1023
01:31:59,227 --> 01:32:02,924
Please fulfill this. My dying wish.

1024
01:32:05,133 --> 01:32:09,695
I will remain eternally grateful to you.
- Shanno.

1025
01:32:21,149 --> 01:32:23,947
Have you seen Amu?

1026
01:32:35,296 --> 01:32:40,256
Amu, come my child. Come to me.

1027
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:59,417
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1028
01:33:09,931 --> 01:33:13,332
It was not your fault.

1029
01:34:17,465 --> 01:34:19,933
Amu?

1030
01:34:35,883 --> 01:34:39,887
Good evening. As many as 57 people
are now thought to have died

1031
01:34:39,887 --> 01:34:41,946
in violence in a train in Gujarat.

1032
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:46,023
The Sabarmati Express was carrying
pilgrims back from Ayodhya to Ahmedabad

1033
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:49,093
and the violence erupted after
it entered the town of Godhra

1034
01:34:49,263 --> 01:34:51,629
about 3 hours from Ahmedabad.

1035
01:34:51,766 --> 01:34:55,258
These are the images of the
train after it was attacked.

1036
01:34:55,436 --> 01:35:00,032
It appears that the violence was in response
to religious workers provoking locals

1037
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:03,699
in the Muslim dominated area
of Godhra a little earlier.

1038
01:35:04,045 --> 01:35:09,005
The coaches carrying the pilgrims were
first stoned and then set on fire.

1039
01:35:04,045 --> 01:35:09,005
The coaches carrying the pilgrims were
first stoned and then set on fire.

1040
01:35:04,045 --> 01:35:09,005
The coaches carrying the pilgrims were
first stoned and then set on fire.
