00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,383
KOTHAGA MAA PRAYANAM.

00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:10,978
Hell with this life!

4
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,188
It's infinite when we cannot figure it out

5
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,481
and if it is understood,
then it is the end.

6
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,596
Every moment I imagine,

7
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:39,425
I'm getting to know that my
life is going far away from me.

8
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:49,095
I didn't know unless my
heart stuck at a girl,

9
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,024
that I did a mistake by
meeting a lot of girls in my life.

10
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:54,894
My name is,

11
00:03:55,325 --> 00:04:00,646
Karthik... Karthik... Karthik...

12
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:06,022
"After having some beer and rum"

13
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:11,219
"To a peg of brandy,"

14
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,733
"Add an ice cube"

15
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:17,202
"After mixing it"

16
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,063
"If you consume the cocktail,"

17
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:26,098
"It's dedicated to you"

18
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:31,967
"Among men, virtuous people stand apart"

19
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:40,385
"Among idiots, jerks stand apart"

20
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:47,148
"Beloved of the Bounteous,"

21
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:52,455
"You will go to come if you listen"

22
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:56,393
"Hail to Kishkinda"

23
00:04:56,486 --> 00:05:00,246
"Hail to Kishkinda"

24
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:04,137
"Hail to Kishkinda"

25
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,879
"Hail to Kishkinda"

26
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,584
"You'll be ruined if you
date a single girl"

27
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:15,574
"You'll become a great person
if you date the trendy women"

28
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:19,221
"You'll be ruined if you
date a single girl"

29
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,785
"You'll become a great person
if you date the trendy women"

30
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:26,660
"Commiting to a single
weapon and a single lady"

31
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:30,590
"It doesn't work if you
live like Lord Sri Rama"

32
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,308
"Playing flute all around"

33
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,612
"Follow Lord Krishna's style
of flirting with women"

34
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,339
"Hail to Kishkinda"

35
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:50,150
"Hail to Kishkinda"

36
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:53,874
"Hail to Kishkinda"

37
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,929
"Hail to Kishkinda"

38
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:32,409
"Oh dear friend, life is as
short as a Lifebuoy soap"

39
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:36,270
"There is no guaranty whether it
lasts for three days or three months”

40
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,069
"Will you do the stuff at the age
of 50 which has to be done at 20?

41
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:43,992
"You have the multiple
choice only at this age"

42
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:57,020
"Hail to Kishkinda"

43
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:00,747
"Hail to Kishkinda"

44
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:04,553
"Hail to Kishkinda"

45
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:08,450
"Hail to Kishkinda"

46
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:30,328
Boo!

47
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,066
Don't you have sense?

48
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,880
Why would I come to
you if I have sense?

49
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,327
Enough, come inside.

50
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,109
You said that you would go
to Bangalore.

51
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,245
I thought to but I didn't.

52
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,396
May I know the reason?

53
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:43,748
No matter wherever we go
it's all about earning.

54
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:48,176
So if I work here I can talk to you daily.

55
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,040
You learned how to answer.

56
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:53,423
Hey!
I don't want coffee or tea.

57
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,944
Let's have our lunch directly.

58
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,799
Won't you learn cooking?

59
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,610
No.

60
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,266
Will the groom accepts if
you don't know how to cook?

61
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,289
Why not?
He cooks for me and I'll have it.

62
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,487
Stop blabbering.

63
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:12,809
Although,
I'm not interested to get married.

64
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:15,693
Everyone says the same
thing but it is mandatory.

65
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:17,464
But I'll get rid of it.

66
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:24,347
Karthik, please stop...

67
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:27,208
Oh God!

68
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,630
Hey!
What happened?

69
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,779
Why did you drive so fast?
Aren't you scared?

70
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,751
Whiners and faint-hearted people
cannot gain happiness and comfort, baby.

71
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,979
Will you be so funny all the time?

72
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:39,505
Yeah.

73
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,209
Burnt candle and spent
moments are history.

74
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,395
They aren't useful for us.

75
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:47,063
Future is like watching the trailer
and expecting the film.

76
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:48,893
No one knows what is happening.

77
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:54,761
So, my philosophy is to
enjoy every moment my dear.

78
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:57,142
But your feelings aren't good enough.

79
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:00,407
Hey!

80
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:04,841
Hey!

81
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,449
Awe!

82
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,954
No, no.

83
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:48,406
God didn't bless the men with the art
of hiding the beauty and feelings.

84
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,981
Anyhow,
God is partial towards women.

85
00:09:52,236 --> 00:09:52,969
Is it?

86
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:57,259
When the desire is being seen in the eyes,
they hide it by closing their eyelids.

87
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:00,452
The boys drool by not knowing
the reason behind those looks.

88
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:05,287
Is it fair to confine the
heartful words behind the lips?

89
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:08,837
Do we display it instead of hiding?

90
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,573
Who the hell is calling
me in this early morning?

91
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,463
Huh!
Is it him?

92
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,923
Good morning, Madhav.

93
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:30,999
Everyday is a good morning for you.

94
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,509
You'll be left with
fantasies if you have a family.

95
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:36,149
These dialogues don't suit us like you.

96
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:37,538
We have interviews today.

97
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,918
I'm not in a mood to come there.

98
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,649
You attend them for this time.

99
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,200
I'll come and sign them.

100
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:45,261
You are born just to put signatures.

101
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,852
Come to the Bala's flat in the evening.
Let's booze.

102
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,293
I got a lot of work.
End the call now.

103
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:52,763
Alright.

104
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:55,777
Hey baby! Shall we go another ride?

105
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:01,543
You don't care for your husband as
much as you care for your beauty.

106
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,270
Hell with your beauty!

107
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:06,295
You gave me the tea right, now
go and prepare breakfast.

108
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:07,791
The breakfast is ready.

109
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:09,787
Then,
why are you still standing here?

110
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,105
My friend Keerthi has come.

111
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:14,602
I thought of reminding you once.

112
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,399
You are bringing your friend when I'm
thinking that it's waste to feed you.

113
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,063
She said that she would stay in a hostel.

114
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,450
I asked her to come so that
you'll offer her a job.

115
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,039
Now you request a job for your friend,

116
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:24,997
next, you ask for the women's freedom.

117
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:27,973
Later you would insist that
you would work and torture me.

118
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,623
Why should I worry about them?
Take it.

119
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:34,108
You are here to fulfil my needs.

120
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:36,873
A job is required for her
to fulfil her needs.

121
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:40,081
There is no one to look after Keerthi.

122
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:41,852
Please.

123
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,803
There is no need to bow down.

124
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,326
Ask her to meet me at office.

125
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:53,401
Ta-da... ta-da...

126
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,945
- Then the hero...
- Yes, we are waiting for him.

127
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,839
No, I'm not talking about him
but about the hero in my film.

128
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,780
- Okay.
- The scene starts in the evening...

129
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,736
Guys, Sulochana might recognise.

130
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:05,144
Eat guava leaves so that she cannot
recognise that you are drunk.

131
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:06,027
- Is it so?
- Yes.

132
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:07,564
- Shall I continue?
- Yes, go ahead.

133
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,234
Do we want me to narrate a film
story or a serial story?

134
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:12,188
- Narrate whatever you wish to.
- Serial is better.

135
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,212
We can expound it.

136
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:14,121
If we open it...

137
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:15,368
Hey!
Your phone is ringing.

138
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:17,701
Tell me.

139
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,426
Now, the time is 10:30 pm.

140
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,699
You didn't come for the dinner yet

141
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,513
Who are you?

142
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,431
If not 10:30 pm it would be 1:30 am.

143
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:25,651
It's his family issue.

144
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:26,768
What is it now?

145
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:27,721
That is...

146
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,090
The responsibility of a wife is
to open the door when I arrive,

147
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:31,524
serve me food when hungry

148
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:33,216
and massage my legs when I'm tired.

149
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:34,816
Shut your mouth and end the call.

150
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,318
It's wrong not to give your
wife even the importance,

151
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,149
that you give to
the women at work.

152
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:40,730
My foot!

153
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,411
The girls at our office are
like the newly released films.

154
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:44,971
We should watch them
whenever they arrive.

155
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:47,122
Meanwhile, wives are
like televisions at home.

156
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,375
We can watch according to our wish.

157
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:50,704
You continue.

158
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,030
- In the opening scene...
- The hero has come.

159
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:54,935
Hi.

160
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:59,101
- Didn't you guys start yet?
- How do I start?

161
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:01,861
- They are not allowing me to open it.
- We were waiting for you.

162
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:03,868
Cheers!

163
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,074
Instead of them,
I'll narrate it to myself.

164
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:09,983
If the hero goes in that way, returns
and if he does like this...

165
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,652
- Hey you upcoming director.
- Yes.

166
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,359
Narrate a proper romantic story
instead of love and marriages stories.

167
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,187
I should get high.

168
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,567
- Do you want to get high?
- Yes.

169
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,859
I should narrate a lullaby
story for him to sleep

170
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,503
and a story for him to get high

171
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,998
and a story for his entertainment.

172
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:26,290
Are you making fun of a director?

173
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:28,336
Hell with your demands!

174
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:30,487
Ofcourse, I've the stories.

175
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,229
If we start the scene

176
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:36,827
Oh
My God! Sulochana is calling me.

177
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:38,027
Attend the call.

178
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,150
Seems like her love on you is overflowing.

179
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,212
- Attend the call.
- Oh my God!

180
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:44,284
She might not talk to me from tomorrow
if she gets to know that I'm boozing.

181
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,473
How can she recognise by a call?

182
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:46,745
It smells when I talk, right?

183
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:48,121
You!

184
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:50,993
Are you boozing?

185
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,356
Didn't I tell you that it
smells when I get drunk?

186
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,799
Hey!

187
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,065
Aren't you boozing along
with that freaking batch?

188
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:57,250
Did you just call us a freaking batch?

189
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,970
Does it mean your batch is a good one?

190
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:01,224
Is that the reason you are
making men go behind you?

191
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,032
- You are making them go crazy.
- No, don't do that.

192
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:03,764
Shut up idiot!

193
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:06,755
Hey Karthik!
What do you think of me?

194
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:10,259
Did you steal five lakhs until now?

195
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,328
Oh my God! Five lakhs?

196
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:12,919
I'll make a film with a 5D camera.

197
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,345
Shut up you drunkard!

198
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,756
Aren't you hurt?

199
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,636
The alcohol was indeed
invented to talk the truth.

200
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:19,505
- Do you know that?
- Disgusting!

201
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:20,830
Why should I talk to you?

202
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:23,551
Did you see,
she disconnected the call.

203
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:26,313
You seem to destroy my life.

204
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:27,906
- Hey!
- Yes.

205
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,534
Forget about being dumped.

206
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:33,215
If you go behind her, she will
definitly make you a pauper.

207
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:36,887
So, listen to me and leave her.

208
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:39,814
Leaving her is not that easy.

209
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,034
You'll get to know that pain
if you love someone.

210
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:47,555
To feel sad or nostalgic I'm
not a family guy like you.

211
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,190
I'm a different guy.

212
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:53,980
My bladder has become full.

213
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:56,041
I should pee urgently.

214
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,199
This wall is good.

215
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,292
Come on.

216
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:07,006
Who is this shameless guy peeing
in front of a ladies hostel?

217
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:08,545
Oh God!

218
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:11,201
Hey!
Have you gone mad?

219
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,517
Idiot! Didn't you find any other place?

220
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,361
Who is beautiful lady?

221
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:20,427
Don't you have comman sense?

222
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:23,135
Idiot!
Did you find only a ladies hostel to pee?

223
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,439
Get out from here.

224
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,387
What are you staring at?
Brainless fellow!

225
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,791
Let's go.
Why are you messing with this mad guy?

226
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,840
Hold on.
I'm not talking to you.

227
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,114
You carry on.

228
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:37,367
Even if you aren't ashamed,
I do feel ashamed to scold you.

229
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:38,567
Shame?

230
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:45,031
"Singing Siggoo Poobanthi
song from the film Swayam Krushi"

231
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,566
Damn!
Get lost.

232
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:49,218
You come in.

233
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:51,212
Excuse me, scold me more.

234
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,650
Else I shall pee here from now on.

235
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:56,816
I'll complain to the cops
if you come here again.

236
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,584
You need not to pee here instead
they shall make you do it.

237
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:02,145
Why go that far?
It's comfortable here.

238
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:03,452
Huh!

239
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:10,336
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning sir.

240
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:11,396
Good morning sir.

241
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,398
Sir, take the coffee.

242
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:21,357
What is this

243
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,145
It's not a projection
but it's my birthday.

244
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:25,309
Wish me happy birthday.

245
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:26,911
Did you buy it or steal?

246
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,255
- What is that?
- I'm talking about the coat.

247
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't money to buy one
or the courage to steal it.

248
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:34,218
I brought it for rent to avoid risk.

249
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:36,524
How come she is here?

250
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:39,255
- She is Keerthi.
- Hi.

251
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:40,358
- Our new joinee.
- Hello.

252
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:41,672
Who is she?

253
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:42,818
She is my dream girl.

254
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,266
She came in real.

255
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:45,823
But she has not fallen for me yet.

256
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,366
All the best.

257
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:48,493
Thank you.

258
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,441
- Pranav, she is Keerthi.
- Hi.

259
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,870
- I'm Keerthi.
- Oh, hello.

260
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,914
- She is our new joiner.
- Oh, all the best.

261
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:56,536
Thank you.

262
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:58,087
He is my bestfriend too.

263
00:16:58,491 --> 00:16:59,637
- She is Sulochana.
- Hi.

264
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,144
- I'm Keerthi.
- Nice to meet you.

265
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:04,614
Instead of introducing
her to the correct person,

266
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,599
he is introducing her to someone else.

267
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,565
- Idiot!
- Wait dude.

268
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,927
Come fast dude.
I'm waiting here.

269
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:12,810
Karthik.

270
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,814
I think that idiot understood it.

271
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:16,097
Karthik.

272
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:16,830
Shucks!

273
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:19,280
- She is Keerthi, our new joiner.
- Oh man! Do I have to work with him?

274
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,304
I'm Keerthi.

275
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:23,143
He already introduced you.

276
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:24,724
Excuse me.

277
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,303
- It's nice.
- Excuse me.

278
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:31,807
I mean it's nice of you
to join in our office.

279
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,007
Will you leave it?

280
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:34,001
What is it?

281
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:35,201
My hand.

282
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,610
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:42,242
By the way, would you like to
have tea, coffee or cold drink?

284
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,248
Did I come to your home?

285
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:47,434
Be it my house or the office, respect
is the same everywhere right?

286
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:48,634
No thanks.

287
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:50,755
He is a insane.

288
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:51,855
Bye.

289
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:55,617
What are you doing?

290
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,878
I'm working.

291
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,654
If you place your laptop
on your lap and work,

292
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,034
things will get blocked
and you can't have kids.

293
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:04,064
Then, where should I place my
laptop so that I can have kids?

294
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:06,328
- Why is he asking like this?
- You don't even know this.

295
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,446
Kamala in our office used to place
the laptop in her hap and work.

296
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:12,020
She delivered to twin babies.

297
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,107
Are you aware of it or not?

298
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,129
Yes, I'm aware of it.

299
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:16,495
- Oh God!
- Hey!

300
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,312
Idiot!

301
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,080
He is talking about men not women.

302
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:21,875
- You...
- You...

303
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,969
- Get lost.
- Senseless fellow.

304
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,956
- Idiot doesn't have the general knowledge.
- Get lost!

305
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,922
I inscribed a beautiful story.
Will you listen to it?

306
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:30,081
I got to correct many of my scenes.
Shut your mouth and do your work.

307
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,556
Hey!
What should we close?

308
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:33,756
Oh my God!

309
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,855
- Hello.
- Am I speaking to Ms. Suchitra?

310
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:48,091
No, I am Keerthi.
You have called a wrong number.

311
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,772
Keerthi, this is Karthik speaking.

312
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,771
How did you obtain
my phone number?

313
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:53,135
Poor girl.

314
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:57,639
These days earning money is tough
but not the phone number.

315
00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:00,638
Is it?
Don't you feel shame?

"Siggu Poobanthi song from

317
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:10,946
Are you even human?

318
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,581
Oh stop it!
You and your stupid thoughts.

319
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,590
Already none of the girls
are falling for me.

320
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,427
Why did she disconnect the call?

321
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,994
Poor girl!
I think she was very much hurt.

322
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:32,382
Awe!

323
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:35,173
Why did he come here as if he
doesn't get any other place to pee?

324
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:37,191
Damn! Come let's go after he pees.

325
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,624
Why are you scared of him?

326
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,442
I'm not scared but I'm
irritated with him.

327
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:42,413
You go if you want to.

328
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:43,669
Hey!
Listen to me.

329
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:47,426
Why is she escaping?

330
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,377
Poor girl!
Not sure what she saw in the night.

331
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:50,803
- Hi.
- Why did you come here?

332
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,165
You said that you will
kill me if I call you.

333
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,160
I don't want to turn you as a murderer so,
I came directly.

334
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,948
Thanks. You did a good job.
Will you leave now?

335
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:03,414
No, you might've deeply hurt last night.

336
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:07,686
So, I came to drop you till
the office and apologise.

337
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,909
So that you would
forgive me at least then.

338
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,441
Dude,
Neither I want your thanks nor your help.

339
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,304
Kindly, do not come here again.

340
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,782
Few of them are
scared by seeing you.

341
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:18,982
Listen to me...

342
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,017
Can't you understand at once?

343
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:22,457
Auto.

344
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,078
Alright, let's meet in the office.

345
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:40,190
Sir, please take the coffee.

346
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,816
Narayana,
don't disturb me please.

347
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:44,922
- Go.
- Okay sir.

348
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,034
What would you lose
if you look at me?

349
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,293
Why don't you look here once?

350
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:57,529
He is irritating a lot.

351
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,232
Narayana, bring me a coffee.

352
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:01,380
Sir, there is no coffee.

353
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,651
Bring the tea then.

354
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:03,897
Sir, even tea isn't there.

355
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,664
Bring anything like Horlicks, boost.

356
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:07,878
There is nothing available.

357
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,643
Else bring me some poison.

358
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,799
Okay sir.

359
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,259
- What is this?
- It's a phenyl.

360
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:18,075
It is similar to poison.

361
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:20,425
Pour it in his mouth.
His menace would end.

362
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:23,421
Narayana, don't be
sarcastic. Shower me some affection.

363
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,333
By the way,
how are you planning my birthday?

364
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,896
I don't have enough money so,
I thought to make it simple.

365
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:37,808
Are you planning to celebrate it in a
simple manner? Don't you have shame?

366
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:39,297
I don't care what you do.

367
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:42,064
I've already conveyed my friends
that there will be a big party.

368
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,458
I'll kill you if you don't
celebrate my birthday grandly,

369
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:48,976
Of couse you will threaten him.
It's not your money, right?

370
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:51,107
Please, you hold on.
We are discussing, right?

371
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:52,747
- What the hell will you talk?
- Hey!

372
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:57,025
Look at him once. He used to be so
healthy and now he became so thin.

373
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,945
You used to be very thin and now,
you became so fat like an elephant.

374
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:03,405
You are sucking all
his energy, aren't you?

375
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:04,352
Damn it!

376
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,625
You look at your personality first.

377
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,687
You'll get to know how you are.

378
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,752
If you marry her, she'll become
a grandmother but not a mother.

379
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:15,862
Look at my friend,
he used to be as smart as a Samsung phone.

380
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,962
He has turned into a screwed up China
mobile after you arrived in his life.

381
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,046
Show some pity on him.

382
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:22,854
Why are you interfering in our matter?

383
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:25,504
We got a lakh of personal between us.
How does it matter to you?

384
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:29,221
You are talking about a lakh, but
it's over five lakh rupees here.

385
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:30,786
What are you thinking about me?

386
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:32,194
We talk about only facts.

387
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:33,233
- Hold, on you guys.
- We don't assume, right?

388
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,333
Why do you guys fight?

389
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:35,624
- You wait.
- You...

390
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:38,909
She has come.

391
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,743
You wait,
I'll talk to you later.

392
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
My bad luck!

393
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:45,883
Did you tell him how
much you spent on me?

394
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:47,183
Hi.

395
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,333
Bye.

396
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:57,109
- You met me at my hostel in the morning.
- Yes.

397
00:22:57,178 --> 00:22:58,665
You stared at me till now in the office.

398
00:22:58,689 --> 00:22:59,156
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:22:59,238 --> 00:23:01,989
But why do you behave
as if you just saw me?

400
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:05,868
I don't know what it is but whenever
I see, you look so different.

401
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,549
Oh, do I see like that for you?

402
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,450
I can only express when I see you,
right?

403
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,412
Then I think you might've affected
with some kind of new disease.

404
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,030
You'll die very soon.

405
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,668
Vainglories like you
would fall in love instantly.

406
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:21,171
- Oh no!
- Hey! Careful.

407
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:24,109
- I had already fallen for you.
- But the work is yet to be done.

408
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:25,854
You should lose some weight.

409
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:30,441
Hero brought the heroine to a
beautiful location to express his love.

410
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:34,849
The heroine felt bliss after witnessing
the beautiful nature.

411
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,016
- Soon...
- What's up with you Bala.

412
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,435
You was writing something seriously.

413
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,327
Dude, I wrote a consecrated scene.

414
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:42,018
- Let me explain you.
- Bala, let me finish my work and come.

415
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:42,886
I'll listen to your scene later.

416
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:47,223
- It's a new scene it seems, let's listen.
- He'll narrate you but I'll show you.

417
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:48,506
Come now.

418
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,726
Damn!

419
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,130
I'll continue the Pavitra's love story.

420
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,921
Hero holds the flower bunch...

421
00:23:57,196 --> 00:24:00,215
- and calls the heroine with love.
- Hey! Remove those clothes.

422
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:01,686
Clothes?

423
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,645
No matter how much they try to disturb
you, concentrate on your scene.

424
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,591
Control, control yourself.

425
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:10,829
Write it down.

426
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,314
With love...

427
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,738
- Ouch! Stop tweaking me.
- Oh my God!

428
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:14,945
Don't over act.

429
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:18,768
They came closure...
Hey!

430
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:20,893
Oh God!

431
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:23,831
Damn!
They are changing the story.

432
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:25,776
Hey.

433
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:28,032
Oh man! It's a pure love story.

434
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:30,976
- Enact heroine in a shy way.
- Oh God! Are you feeling shy?

435
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:32,197
Shy?

436
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:34,439
- Madhav, why'll I feel shy infront of you?
- What am I writing and what are you doing?

437
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:35,615
Oh my God!

438
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:39,390
- I cannot tolerate.
- Hey! Leave me.

439
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:40,852
- Oh God!
- Hey Madhav!

440
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,887
Oh my God!

441
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:45,066
- Oh my God!
- Hey

442
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:47,770
From next time, bring you friend too.

443
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,317
Hey!
My story is spoiling.

444
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,050
Why is he shaking like a hen
which is laying an egg?

445
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,836
Bala, you wanted to narrate a scene right?
Narrate it now.

446
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:56,845
I won't say anything and I don't
know anything. Please leave.

447
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:57,888
It's alright, please continue.

448
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:58,633
I don't know anything.

449
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,719
- But I love to hear.
- Wait.

450
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:03,213
Go home, arrange them and read it.

451
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,249
He is very sensitive.

452
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:06,187
He said that he would
narrate us something, right?

453
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:07,902
He might've heard
something unusual.

454
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:12,618
Yes, coming.

455
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,946
Oh God!

456
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,970
I'm coming.

457
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,243
Hi Keerthi.
Get inside.

458
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:23,540
Sit down.

459
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,957
Why isn't the hot water coming?

460
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:27,910
Geyser is not working.

461
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,279
I've complained to the owner. He said
that he will get it repaired tomorrow.

462
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,734
I've put the hot water
in the bucket next to it.

463
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:35,004
Where did you keep the shampoo?

464
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:36,903
Oh no!

465
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:40,139
Who the hell will shampoo
my hair and scrub my back?

466
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:43,351
- As if this is the first time.
- I'm coming.

467
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,756
Should I ask you daily to massage?

468
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:52,087
Hey! Is breakfast ready?

469
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:53,660
Yes, it is.
You are late for it.

470
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,657
You just answer to my question.
Don't talk much.

471
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:58,144
Serve.

472
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:02,082
Why do you cook bland Idly all the time?
Is it that it takes less time to cook?

473
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,333
Hi Keerthi.

474
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,559
- Had your breakfast?
- Yeah, I had. You carry on.

475
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,380
Where is the bowl?

476
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:14,833
I'm bringing it.

477
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:18,723
You make me repeat the
same things every day,

478
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,267
as if you are doing it for the first time.

479
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,291
Where is the napkin?

480
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:24,521
Put on my shoes.

481
00:26:25,954 --> 00:26:28,689
Can't you at least put on your shoes,
Madhav?

482
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,346
She is here to serve me, isn't it?

483
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,177
Keerthi,
do you know how the word wife originated?

484
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:38,073
The word wife derived from the word slave.

485
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:38,807
Am I right?

486
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:40,089
Make it fast.

487
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:41,651
It's done.

488
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:47,139
Why did you come so early?
Do you have any work with your friend?

489
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,533
Nothing. As I have time for the office so,
I came here.

490
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,783
But I didn't think that
she would be very busy.

491
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:55,660
Can cooking Idlies in the morning
be considered as being busy?

492
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,827
Anyway, women do always support women.

493
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:04,552
But you don't accept men as great
who works hard the entire day.

494
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:05,871
Where are my keys.

495
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:07,475
Bring it fast.

496
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:08,246
Here it is.

497
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:11,147
Move aside.
Don't irritate me in the morning.

498
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:12,472
Bye Pavitra.

499
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,898
Huh!

500
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:24,151
He seems like a rowdy, who the
hell gave him the software job?

501
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,810
Hooligan!

502
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:29,717
Why don't you eat some spicy
food to generate your feelings?

503
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:31,699
Sir, coffee.

504
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:35,915
Narayana, things are getting cleared now.

505
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:38,923
Don't disturb me by offering
tea or coffee. Get lost now.

506
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:40,337
Ok sir.

507
00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:44,995
Would you like to go for a coffee with me?

508
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:46,955
Why are you serious at me?

509
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,070
If not coffee, have a cold drink.
You would be chilled.

510
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:52,738
- What if I don't like you?
- I'll try till you like me.

511
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,003
I will never like you.

512
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,296
- Please, get lost.
- Ok.

513
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,622
He don't have shame. Damn!

514
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:01,969
- What dude? Didn't it work?
- It might take some time.

515
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,463
You are following her restlessly.

516
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:05,936
It's hard to find beautiful girls.

517
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,632
There is a lot of competition.

518
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:09,106
We should try our best.

519
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:10,180
Are you in love?

520
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,467
Damn! Why will I do such things?
It's just for timepass.

521
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,360
Oh God!
He has become very smart.

522
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,830
Auto.

523
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,407
Take me to Madhapur hostel.

524
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:47,841
Hey wait.
Where are you coming to?

525
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,159
It's a public auto.
Shouldn't we use them?

526
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,213
Consider it as a sharing auto.

527
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:54,504
Else assume me as a stranger.

528
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:57,475
You keep quite.
We should also let them live.

529
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:58,991
Dude, keep going.

530
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:05,033
I know that you would play such
filthy tricks if I stay closer to you.

531
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,496
Keerthi, it's not the trick but truth.

532
00:29:07,694 --> 00:29:08,746
I like you.

533
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,439
I'm thinking to live with you.

534
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:12,728
Are you in love with me?

535
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:14,081
Love?

536
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:16,752
Love is another name for self-deceit.

537
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:20,245
Love is a time waste process
and it doesn't suit me.

538
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:23,200
If not do you want to marry?

539
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:24,484
Marriage?

540
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,969
It's like an outdated trend for
the modern people like us.

541
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:31,027
Tolerable feelings of a husband
and a wife are foolish feelings.

542
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:36,128
I don't like adjusting to
the partner's wishes.

543
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:40,662
Let's share the household
works and spendings equally.

544
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:42,501
Let's live together for each other.

545
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:45,326
There won't be any issues such
as anger, adjustability etc.

546
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:48,169
Let our earnings and lives be independent.

547
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:49,884
Let's live happily.

548
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:50,819
What do you say?

549
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,493
Do you mean that we need to
spend our life in a jolly way,

550
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:55,417
by cooperating to each other?

551
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:57,386
Excatly, living together.

552
00:29:58,651 --> 00:29:59,651
Hey stop!

553
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:06,246
Dude, take it.

554
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:08,316
Keerthi.

555
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:10,698
Keerthi.

556
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,154
What should I answer
when the neighbours ask?

557
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:14,811
Tell them that we are
in living relationship.

558
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:15,987
They'll bash you.

559
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:18,084
I hate this hypocrisy.

560
00:30:18,403 --> 00:30:19,843
I live for myself.

561
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:22,587
Don't live for everyone
but live for yourself.

562
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,067
Life is yours so your choice is.

563
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:27,577
Damn!
He is senseless.

564
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,460
Hell with his filthy ideas!
Brainless fellow!

565
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:33,706
Do remember that society will always
try to blame you no matter what.

566
00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:37,629
They say that she left her parents
when you marry your lover.

567
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:41,616
Else they say that she cheated her lover
if she marries according to her parents.

568
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:42,716
Idiot!

569
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:45,369
If she waits for her
parents to get convinced,

570
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:48,912
they say that the mad girl is
wasting her time by not marrying.

571
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:51,480
Keerthi, think over it.

572
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:58,449
Heroine after waiting for 40 years,

573
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,342
She stopped after witnessing the hero.

574
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,165
Soon she will get stabbed.

575
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,141
That brought both of them together.

576
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,327
They both hugged each other.
The film ends there.

577
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:09,738
How is it?

578
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:11,642
- Waiter, serve me a peg.
- Peg?

579
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:13,096
Isn't it juice?

580
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:16,520
- Yes, there is a little amount of juice.
- A little amount?

581
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:17,990
Then the rest of it is?
Oh God!

582
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:20,137
She seems to be a traditional girl.

583
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,925
Tell me, how are the characters?

584
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:23,403
- Very bad.
- Why?

585
00:31:23,603 --> 00:31:26,322
Wouldn't the heroine in your film smoke?

586
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,404
- Does she hate alcohol?
- Yes.

587
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:30,944
Does she stick to a single
boyfriend throughout her life?

588
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,915
Go away man.
Hell with your same old stories!

589
00:31:35,115 --> 00:31:37,189
We don't need such.
Your film shall be a huge flop.

590
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:38,645
- Same old story?
- Let's go.

591
00:31:38,803 --> 00:31:40,708
Did she come or not?

592
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,340
The party is lively, isn't it?

593
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:45,181
I don't understand why do they
celebrate birthdays at this age.

594
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,620
Ofcourse, she has to come for me.

595
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:48,985
Hi.

596
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:52,285
Oh man!
Why did he come here too?

597
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:55,483
Hey!
Why do you get scared of him?

598
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,782
- I'll get annoyed by him.
- Hold on.

599
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:58,883
- Oh, you are here.
- Yes, because I didn't expect you here.

600
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:01,552
But I came here knowing
that you would come.

601
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:05,832
Are these bangles
presented by me?

602
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:07,692
Hey!
Seems like you are trying very seriously.

603
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:09,364
I'm not the guy who
quits after getting started.

604
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:10,388
All right continue.

605
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,902
Excuse me,
why are you escaping as if you saw a rat?

606
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,742
What's fleeing after seeing a rat?

607
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:19,231
That is, you are escaping like
a cat who escapes seeing a rat.

608
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:23,730
Oh! Cat doesn't escape seeing
a rat but rat does.

609
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:24,928
You are sharp.

610
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:28,359
I won't bother you.
Don't get scared.

611
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,390
Assume me as your brother.

612
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,548
By the way, I'm Karthik.

613
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:37,172
Don't fear Shruthy,
assume me as your brother-in-law.

614
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:39,177
But you just said that
you are my brother.

615
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:40,921
You're got me again.

616
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,711
Alright, assume whatever you feel like.
Come with me.

617
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:48,356
Excuse me, take care of your friend.

618
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:49,550
She is scared.

619
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,624
What can she do when you behave so?

620
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:53,635
What did I do?

621
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:57,005
Oh!
You are so innocent.

622
00:32:57,187 --> 00:33:00,057
Thanks for understanding
after these many days.

623
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:02,123
By the way, where is he?
Bye.

624
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:03,545
- How is the party?
- It's your birthday,

625
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,666
- So, it would be definitely colourful.
- Why did you come?

626
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,846
Wonderful man! You are celebrating
birthday her in a five-star hotel.

627
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:11,831
Your idea is awesome Sulochana.

628
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:14,337
What's the expenditure for this party?
Is it one lakh?

629
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:16,615
How does it matter to you?

630
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:18,809
- Are you paying for it?
- Who invited you?

631
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,749
Sulochana, I didn't invite him.
I swear on you.

632
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,748
You hold on man.
Don't rush.

633
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,576
You are anyways good forecaster.

634
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:27,976
If you had come across someone like me
then he would've slit your throat.

635
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:31,786
You are living because
of my innocent friend.

636
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,963
No one shall ever love a guy like you.

637
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:37,317
That is the reason I
never proposed a girl.

638
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:40,869
Once a boy proposes a girl,

639
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:45,699
his countdown would start.

640
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,051
She keeps asking him
to take her to places,

641
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:50,867
buy her things and keep
him around like a dog.

642
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:56,509
You all will escape saying that you
are consecrated if we ask to kiss us.

643
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,479
I should blame him instead of you.

644
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:01,445
- Hey!
- What's wrong in it?

645
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:05,579
Boys obey the girls
only when they are in love.

646
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:09,478
When guys are asked to come at a certain
time, they'd arrive early and wait for us.

647
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:14,242
After the wedding, if we ask to come
at 9:00 pm they reach at 12:00 am.

648
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,237
Because they don't care anymore.

649
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:17,491
Even I'm asking the same.

650
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:20,126
Why the girls demand
the boys while in love?

651
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,512
And why do boys command girls
after the wedding?

652
00:34:22,612 --> 00:34:23,919
Can't they both stay equal?

653
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:25,462
Can't they respect each other?

654
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:28,028
I want to know the
reason for this problem.

655
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,563
I want to know right now.

656
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:32,805
What is this Karthik?
Do you have sense, Keerthi?

657
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:34,843
Don't you know what to
talk at this moment?

658
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,130
Is this all needed now?

659
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,120
Today is Sulochana's birthday.
Let's happily celebrate it.

660
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:40,151
Move aside.

661
00:34:40,218 --> 00:34:42,972
Sulochana, come here.
Please, don't mind his words.

662
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:44,908
I should blame you instead of him.

663
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,332
I don't want to celebrate this birthday.

664
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:50,130
- Sulochana, please let's go.
- Sulochana, let's go and cut the cake.

665
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,950
- Please, let's go and cut the cake.
- Come.

666
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:53,103
- Hey!
- Hey!

667
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:55,244
- Keerthi.
- Yes.

668
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:58,830
I like you very much in this matter.

669
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:03,778
- Both our tastes are similar, right?
- Of course.

670
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:04,781
Hey!

671
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:10,197
Happy birthday to you...
happy birthday to you...

672
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:14,216
Hey!
Move aside.

673
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,508
Happy birthday.

674
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:22,574
Hey you!

675
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:32,615
Oh God! They are boozing.
I'm scared. You please go.

676
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:34,434
Go.

677
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:40,247
- Will you come to Madhapur?
- No way. Get lost.

678
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:46,596
Hey, fools! Do you reject when a
girl comes to you asks to come?

679
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,109
- Baby, where shall we go?
- Damn!

680
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:50,649
Hey!

681
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,221
Baby, while we were boozing,

682
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:54,145
why are you leaving
after asking us to come?

683
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:57,206
- Hey! Leave me.
- Baby, where will you go?

684
00:35:58,043 --> 00:36:00,389
Hey! Who is that?

685
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:12,159
They call them an audience
who stares at anarchy,

686
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,578
but the hero is the one who opposes them.

687
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:18,113
Your personality is good.
Go and try for a chance in the films.

688
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:22,381
It is your mistake to consider me as soft
as I'm smart and arrived in a Skoda car.

689
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,441
We are already drunk.
Get lost, don't irritate us.

690
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:27,780
If I drink two beers if I booze.

691
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,213
Guys, why do we talk with him?
Go and bash him.

692
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:31,613
What is it with you?

693
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,159
Why are you looking there
after sending him here?

694
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,912
Won't you look what is happening here?

695
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:47,133
Should I show it again?
Then watch it.

696
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:49,513
Hey!

697
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:01,061
Hey! Hey!
Go and bash him.

698
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:06,197
Hey!

699
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,099
Hey!

700
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:13,711
Hey!

701
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:40,623
Hey!

702
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:43,315
Hey!

703
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
Hey!

704
00:37:49,882 --> 00:37:51,209
Hey!

705
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:59,714
Go and sit in the car.

706
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,777
No, even you are drunk.

707
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:06,198
Hell with this life! She doesn't know the
difference between a hero and a villain.

708
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,940
Hey!

709
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:09,129
Hell you!

710
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,324
Hey!

711
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,799
Hey!

712
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,879
Hey!

713
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:32,183
Sorry brother...
Sorry brother...

714
00:38:34,664 --> 00:38:37,412
Keerthi, what about my proposal?

715
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:38,850
I'm the hero.

716
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,402
- Let's go.
- Keerthi, what about my proposal?

717
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,570
Shucks!

718
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:54,469
Bro, please give me Rs. 5000.

719
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:57,184
I got an opportunity to go to Chennai and
narrate the story to the hero Mr. Surya.

720
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,736
- I don't have cash.
- It's okay. Give me the ATM card.

721
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:00,867
I don't even have it.

722
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:02,845
- My credit card...
- Give me I'll use it.

723
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:04,151
- I don't even have it.
- Why?

724
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:07,295
Do you know that I took a loan
of Rs. 1,00,000 for her birthday.

725
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,242
She withdraws my salary every month.

726
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:11,259
She looks after my financial matters.

727
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:13,760
- Then what do you have?
- I have Sulochana's heart with me.

728
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,045
Oh God!

729
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:18,293
Did you give your ATM card to her?

730
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:20,308
Is she withdrawing your entire salary?

731
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:23,333
Oh God! Your salary is
Rs. 50,000 per month.

732
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:29,034
Are you planning to beg by
giving her your entire salary?

733
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,396
- Senseless guy!
- Ouch!

734
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:33,145
Leave it.
He might have some problem.

735
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,780
Problem my foot!

736
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,945
It's not just a thousand
or two but it's Rs.50,000.

737
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:41,893
There is no doubt.
She would definitely dump you.

738
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:43,969
You cannot our relation.

739
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:46,814
Even yesterday, you
interrupted and disturbed us.

740
00:39:47,214 --> 00:39:50,029
I had to interrupt
because of your innocence.

741
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:50,849
Hmm.

742
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:54,100
Look Pranav,
you aren't understanding a logic here.

743
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:57,556
You are trusting her so much, right?
Then why isn't she trusting you?

744
00:39:57,756 --> 00:39:58,574
In which matter?

745
00:39:58,643 --> 00:39:59,909
In your love matter.

746
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:03,337
- You thought to get married, right?
- Yes.

747
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:05,562
What's wrong in enjoying together?

748
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:11,995
Had she spoke to you romantically
except accosting about the money?

749
00:40:12,095 --> 00:40:13,846
No. She doesn't speak so.

750
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:15,948
Because she has to commit.

751
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:22,262
She is using you because there won't be
any chance to escape after committing.

752
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:26,065
So, use your dumb brain.

753
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,111
Bring her wisely, enjoy with her
and make her pregnant if needed.

754
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,515
Then there will be
guarantee for your love.

755
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:35,726
In that case, it would be great
if you spend and if she enjoys it.

756
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,985
This is like baiting a piece
of jaggery to kill flies.

757
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,858
It's your bad luck if
you don't understand yet.

758
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:45,169
Bala, how much do you want?

759
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:46,369
Rs. 5000.

760
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,865
- Damn!
- Damn!

761
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,069
- It's okay.
- Rs. 10,000.

762
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:55,107
- Thanks, dude.
- All the best.

763
00:40:55,692 --> 00:40:57,401
I can meet Danush
along with Surya.

764
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:01,866
Hey! I'm saying this for everyone
like you. Listen to this.

765
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:06,291
Love is like a goods train which
is lengthy but the speed is low.

766
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:11,082
While lust is like a metro train which
is short in length but is very speed.

767
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:13,028
Understood?

768
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:16,672
Why do you bother about the train
when the driver is such an idiot?

769
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:18,688
It's not like that.
I'll appoint a driver.

770
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:21,340
Are you understanding
what are you speaking?

771
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,152
Jeez!
I'll go crazy if I talk to him.

772
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:26,633
I'm at your office.
Where are you?

773
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:28,565
But it was you who planned it.

774
00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:34,295
What? I applied leave request and came to
you as you said.

775
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,180
Come then.

776
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,906
How much time will you take?
Alright.

777
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,184
Wow!

778
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:52,089
Why is he going near my vehicle?

779
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:55,126
New vehicle is very fresh.

780
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:57,858
How much did it cost you on road?

781
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:00,753
Head light is good.

782
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:03,309
Wow!

783
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,070
Indicators are too good.

784
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:07,672
Hey!

785
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:10,540
You're finished.
Remove your hand.

786
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:13,053
I'll kill you if you touch my vehicle.

787
00:42:13,122 --> 00:42:15,988
What did I do that you
became so aggressive?

788
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:19,983
I just said that your bike is good.

789
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:22,375
Ofcourse it will be as
it is a new vehicle.

790
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:24,435
Will you give it to me once,
I'll ride it and see.

791
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:28,330
The vehicle will be damaged if every
random person rides it. Move aside.

792
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,477
One person can ride it.
That's okay Please give it to me.

793
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,899
Urgh! I won't give it to you.
Get lost!

794
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:38,265
Keerthi.

795
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:43,954
Even the seat is
very soft and good.

796
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,272
Idiot!
You'll get ruined.

797
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:49,698
Thank you.

798
00:42:49,888 --> 00:42:50,949
- Thank you.
- Take it.

799
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:53,396
By the way, what's the special?

800
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,119
He is just too much.

801
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:57,852
- My partner purchased a new bike.
- Oh.

802
00:42:58,028 --> 00:42:59,028
That is the special.

803
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:03,263
- Take the sweet.
- Thank you.

804
00:43:03,802 --> 00:43:04,802
Thank you.

805
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:07,489
Take the sweet.

806
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,153
Why are you staring like that?

807
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,460
My partner has got a new scooty.

808
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,379
That is the reason I'm just celebrating.
Take it.

809
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:24,031
I don't understand what's your problem is.
Why are you chasing me?

810
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:26,993
The answer to the first question is
you are my problem.

811
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:31,034
And the answer for the second
question is that I like you.

812
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,234
Are you crazy?

813
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:35,491
Guys generally chase girls to
love them or marry them.

814
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,910
But why the hell are you torturing
me for living relationship?

815
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,219
Shall we get married?
Tell me where shall we get married?

816
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,780
Is it a temple or a register office?

817
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:46,108
It's your wish.

818
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:50,312
Keerthi, a guy's psychology is,

819
00:43:51,354 --> 00:43:56,545
He owns the girl the
moment he gets married.

820
00:43:57,922 --> 00:44:03,307
The moment he owns the girl, he
loses the respect on the girl.

821
00:44:03,913 --> 00:44:07,058
Just like the mobile in my hand,
my wife will be there at my home.

822
00:44:07,342 --> 00:44:08,582
There is no much difference.

823
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:13,845
Keerthi,
I don't like to consider human as a thing.

824
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:16,962
That is the reason,
there is no need for owning one another.

825
00:44:17,678 --> 00:44:19,918
It's enough if both of them
respect and trust each other.

826
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:22,188
I won't oppose your freedom.

827
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,563
Similarly, you shouldn't
oppose to my freedom.

828
00:44:24,684 --> 00:44:26,364
Then there shall be no
space for arguments.

829
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:29,478
In this way,
we shall lead our life happily.

830
00:44:29,578 --> 00:44:30,702
What's wrong in this?

831
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:33,828
Decide what you want.

832
00:44:35,593 --> 00:44:36,593
Huh!

833
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,199
Hey!

834
00:44:39,216 --> 00:44:40,216
Take your own time.

835
00:44:40,757 --> 00:44:44,238
No matter if it is a week or a month.

836
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,365
But I want you.

837
00:44:47,972 --> 00:44:49,512
Sir, here is your coffee.

838
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:52,956
Shucks!

839
00:44:53,285 --> 00:44:56,335
Every girl seem to be beautiful
in a short span.

840
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,991
He bought her to the
flat as he advised.

841
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:07,534
Oh my God!
This flat seems like a lodge.

842
00:45:07,587 --> 00:45:09,630
- Why did you bring me here?
- To show.

843
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:11,589
- What is it?
- Our home.

844
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:13,892
- You've already shown it to me.
- When did I?

845
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:17,332
You brought me two times after
you got shifted to this flat.

846
00:45:17,432 --> 00:45:20,072
I had shown you the hall and now
I'm going to show you the bedroom.

847
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:26,053
He might feel disturbed as he is writing.
Shall we go inside and talk?

848
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:29,780
Do not go into the room.
It is the actual disturbance.

849
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:31,629
Let's go.

850
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:34,894
Oh God! I cannot
write dialogues to these sounds.

851
00:45:35,094 --> 00:45:36,503
It's better to sit outside.
Pack up.

852
00:45:37,495 --> 00:45:39,144
- Sulochana.
- Yes.

853
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:41,811
That is... that is...

854
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,067
We feel comfortable when
we scratch while it itches.

855
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:48,284
But its disgusting when you
scratch unnecessarily. Remove your hands.

856
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:53,935
I wanted to sit beside
you and sleep in your lap.

857
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:56,549
What's wrong with this poor guy?

858
00:45:57,144 --> 00:45:58,998
There is nothing wrong
but it's the desire.

859
00:45:59,286 --> 00:46:01,917
Wait! We agreed not to
proceed until we get married right?

860
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:04,121
My friend told me that it
seems to be very happy.

861
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:06,325
However we shall get married.
What's wrong in it?

862
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:10,239
Who told you?
Is it Karthik?

863
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:11,019
That is...

864
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:12,191
Ouch!

865
00:46:12,907 --> 00:46:14,439
This sound doesn't
seem like that one.

866
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:15,936
Why did it reverberate?

867
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,086
Yes, this might be that sound.

868
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,927
- Sulochana... Sulochana... wait.
- Take your credit and debit card.

869
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,683
By not differentiating in both of us,

870
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:30,382
to stay happily after our wedding,

871
00:46:31,013 --> 00:46:34,031
To buy a flat and a car,

872
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:38,881
Till now I saved 10 lakhs from our
salaries with a lot of thought.

873
00:46:39,518 --> 00:46:41,711
But you suspect me?

874
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:45,582
Damn!
Every man thinks in the same perspective.

875
00:46:45,982 --> 00:46:48,747
Is it love only if we get physical?

876
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,472
Bloody idiot!

877
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:53,681
- Sulochana, it's not that...
- What is it then? Hold on, I'm coming.

878
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:56,826
Everything got ended the
moment you suspected me.

879
00:46:57,026 --> 00:46:59,253
Damn! From now on,
don't try to talk to me.

880
00:47:00,348 --> 00:47:02,406
Sulochana, I'm sorry.

881
00:47:03,066 --> 00:47:04,168
- Hello sister.
- Damn!

882
00:47:04,603 --> 00:47:05,826
Sister, why did it sound so loud?

883
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,318
She might've learnt
Karate in her childhood.

884
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:08,422
What might be his position?

885
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:13,289
Hey!

886
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:16,269
Though he seems as soft as Mr. Kamal
Hassan in the film 'Swathi Muthyam',

887
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,933
our boy might've rocked it.

888
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:25,138
- Bloody idiot! You'll get ruined.
- In which way?

889
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:25,723
Damn it!

890
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:29,849
Hey! Hi, take this.

891
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:33,373
Hey! What happened?

892
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:36,929
I've seen many girls but
everyone gave moderate reactions.

893
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:38,565
No one cried like her.

894
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:40,174
What did you do?

895
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:44,616
Why are you acting mute at a time where
you need to be proud and loud like a man?

896
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:47,561
She slapped him so
hard that his ear is ringing.

897
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:50,434
- Oh, the matter turned topsy-turvy.
- Exactly.

898
00:47:51,546 --> 00:47:55,956
Don't worry. I'll plan
and you just follow it.

899
00:47:55,977 --> 00:47:57,889
- Oh God! I don't want.
- Hey!

900
00:47:58,019 --> 00:47:59,806
- Hey!
- Hell with your idea!

901
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:03,226
Don't involve in our matters.
I'll beg you.

902
00:48:07,363 --> 00:48:09,582
You will not get better.
Damn it!

903
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:12,903
Why do you give such advice?
Look at the poor kid!

904
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:14,166
Hey wait!
I'm coming.

905
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:22,444
Sir, take the coffee.

906
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,042
Narayana, your timing is perfect.

907
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:28,555
I'll have the coffee later on but,

908
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:31,987
ask her about my proposal.

909
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:33,746
Ok sir.

910
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:38,430
Madam,
sir wants to know about his proposal.

911
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,242
Are you a peon or a broker?

912
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:42,150
No,
there is something behind this.

913
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,143
Did he offer you a drink?

914
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:48,944
No. He gave me some space in his heart.

915
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:54,252
What is it Narayana?
You seem to be thinking deeply.

916
00:48:54,352 --> 00:48:55,352
Yes, dear.

917
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,220
I have a daughter.

918
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,394
I would be very
happy if she dies.

919
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:02,750
Did she love someone?

920
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,100
I wouldn't have this tension
if she did so.

921
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,241
Did she elope?

922
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:09,396
It would have been
much better if done so.

923
00:49:09,557 --> 00:49:10,593
Then what happened?

924
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:11,819
She scored a good rank.

925
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,603
She wants to study MBBS now.

926
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:16,475
It requires lakhs of rupees.

927
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:21,010
I gave her the entire jewellery and
sent her to the Muthoot finance.

928
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,821
Meanwhile, rowdies theft it.

929
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
What should I do?

930
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:25,953
My salary is Rs. 6000.

931
00:49:25,993 --> 00:49:27,853
From where should I arrange it?

932
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:31,377
- I'm there for you.
- What can you do?

933
00:49:34,365 --> 00:49:37,731
I'll do anything for you
daughter to become a doctor.

934
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:44,608
Hey! Who are you?
Go from here.

935
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:49,279
Hey!

936
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,585
Hey!

937
00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:07,586
Hey!

938
00:50:08,052 --> 00:50:09,658
Hey!

939
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:11,667
Hey!

940
00:50:21,572 --> 00:50:22,572
Hey!

941
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:25,682
Hey!

942
00:50:27,578 --> 00:50:28,763
Hey!

943
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,320
Hey!

944
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:35,508
Hey!

945
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,292
Hey!

946
00:50:41,428 --> 00:50:43,168
Hey!

947
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:44,368
- Hey!
- Hey!

948
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:47,498
Hey!

949
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:49,292
Hey!

950
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:54,566
Hey!

951
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,639
Hey!

952
00:51:01,096 --> 00:51:01,639
Hey!

953
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,039
Hey!

954
00:51:17,418 --> 00:51:18,418
Hey!

955
00:51:46,014 --> 00:51:47,014
Hey!

956
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:05,922
Madam, he is a mad guy.

957
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:10,806
Who'll be there for you
if you are in trouble?

958
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:16,467
Madam, that is the reason that
I'm very much affectionate to sir.

959
00:52:21,157 --> 00:52:25,449
Madam now tell me, what did
you do with the sir's proposal?

960
00:52:32,558 --> 00:52:33,787
Okay madam.

961
00:52:34,976 --> 00:52:37,782
She asked you not to
pee wherever you like.

962
00:52:40,872 --> 00:52:42,780
You informed me, right?
You can leave now.

963
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,276
Okay sir.

964
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:54,289
Keerthi, there is a handbag in
the boot space. Bring it inside.

965
00:52:57,948 --> 00:52:59,083
When did you come?

966
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:05,029
How does it matter to you?

967
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:06,713
Where did you go?

968
00:53:06,737 --> 00:53:09,631
I went to the tailor
shop to bring my blouses.

969
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:12,318
Did you go for to bring blouses
or for the sake of blouses?

970
00:53:12,418 --> 00:53:13,840
Why are you talking like that?

971
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:18,018
What did she do that you are slapping her,
Madhav?

972
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:19,610
What is wrong in it?

973
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,191
Does she need to take your
permission for such a small thing?

974
00:53:22,207 --> 00:53:26,355
It's not a theatre for everyone to
involve but it's a couple's matter.

975
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:27,977
You don't get involved.

976
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:30,152
Madhav, this is not correct.

977
00:53:30,352 --> 00:53:34,543
You need not teach me what
is right and what is wrong.

978
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:39,209
Every man supposes to put
his wife in limits.

979
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:40,417
That is men's nature.

980
00:53:40,877 --> 00:53:43,614
Women think that wandering
gives you freedom.

981
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,135
We don't like that.

982
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,716
First you get married.

983
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:51,284
You'll get to know how a husband behaves
and how you should behave with him.

984
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:56,329
Keerthi, you leave now.

985
00:53:58,457 --> 00:54:01,039
Get out. You don't have an entry now.

986
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:06,183
Why are you making this small
issue as a huge one?

987
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:07,921
Is this a small issue?

988
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:11,218
Today it is blouse tomorrow it maybe
saree and next it shall be a night dress.

989
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:14,942
I cannot tolerate this.
Get out from here.

990
00:54:35,209 --> 00:54:37,650
Keerthi,
do you know how the word wife originated?

991
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:41,052
The word wife derived from the word slave.

992
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:45,773
First you get married.

993
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:49,395
You'll get to know how a husband behaves
and how you should behave with him.

994
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:52,948
There is no need of owning one another.

995
00:54:53,682 --> 00:54:55,922
It's enough if both of them
respect and trust each other.

996
00:54:56,575 --> 00:54:58,138
I won't oppose your freedom.

997
00:54:58,535 --> 00:55:00,828
Similarly, you shouldn't
oppose to my freedom.

998
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:06,836
Life is yours so your choice is.

999
00:55:36,532 --> 00:55:37,732
Are you accepting my proposal?

1000
00:55:53,387 --> 00:55:55,803
He is mad.

1001
00:55:56,675 --> 00:55:58,783
He has humanity beyond that.

1002
00:55:58,983 --> 00:56:01,089
He doesn't have civic sense too.

1003
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:02,741
But he has respect for women.

1004
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:04,563
Do you know how does he uphold them?

1005
00:56:04,663 --> 00:56:07,608
Every boy pretends to be a
good boy in front of the girls.

1006
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:10,890
Every boy looks here and there.

1007
00:56:11,174 --> 00:56:12,624
Karthik isn't like that.

1008
00:56:12,824 --> 00:56:15,748
Hey!
You are in the hoodwink of Karthik.

1009
00:56:16,899 --> 00:56:19,605
Yes,
I've fallen in love with him.

1010
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:23,482
He isn't asking you to marry him but
he is asking you to live with him.

1011
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:26,461
God might've created someone for me.

1012
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:28,469
And I believe that it's Karthik.

1013
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:31,315
It's not correct to plan for
a living relationship.

1014
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,125
- Think about it again.
- Thank you for your advice.

1015
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:38,235
I'll get dressed if you leave.

1016
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:40,818
By the way, wish me best of luck.

1017
00:56:43,253 --> 00:56:46,477
Hurray! I'm going to accept
Karthik's proposal today.

1018
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:02,023
"My new relationship with you"

1019
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:06,454
"This journey is unknown"

1020
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:11,733
"While this ecstasy is being rushing"

1021
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:15,954
"This flow isn't
reaching the coastal shore"

1022
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,256
"While the life is urging for a war"

1023
00:57:21,164 --> 00:57:24,971
"The feet are walking along"

1024
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,159
"If the distance is unbearable"

1025
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:35,357
"The time is bringing us together"

1026
00:57:36,738 --> 00:57:41,143
"Why are you sad when
you've become his half"

1027
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:45,534
"Why are you brawling instead
of getting along with him?"

1028
00:57:46,438 --> 00:57:50,690
"Though he met me despite
not being matched"

1029
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:55,418
"The disturbance in heart
transformed into the rain"

1030
00:57:55,518 --> 00:58:00,081
"A known chuckle and an unknown tease"

1031
00:58:00,392 --> 00:58:04,797
"Do you know my breath
became your friend?"

1032
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:09,827
"Our pair is like the dreams to the eyes”

1033
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:14,536
“That is the reason I’ve
adapted your nature"

1034
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:29,971
"The past is showing some affection"

1035
00:58:30,538 --> 00:58:34,929
"Don't know what good it
wants by stopping the craving"

1036
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,883
"It's deceiving me that he is magic"

1037
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:44,674
"Alright, let's leave that all"

1038
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:58,794
"A known chuckle and an unknown tease"

1039
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:02,964
"Do you know my breath
became your friend?"

1040
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:08,634
"Our pair is like the dreams to the eyes”

1041
00:59:08,888 --> 00:59:13,187
“That is the reason I’ve
adapted your nature"

1042
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,702
"If he shows me the reality like a mirror"

1043
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:38,592
"The war has begun somewhere in the heart"

1044
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:43,567
"Whatever it is loneliness is a pain"

1045
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:48,430
"What difference does it
make if he is in my heart"

1046
01:02:04,613 --> 01:02:06,892
Who the hell is disturbing
me when I'm in a great mood?

1047
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:09,816
Huh!

1048
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,297
Who the hell is it?

1049
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:17,314
Keerthi?

1050
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:19,775
Karthik?

1051
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:26,949
The thing is...
Oh no!

1052
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:32,223
Hey, why are you vacating
the hostel? What happened?

1053
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:34,354
Didn't you like us?

1054
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:35,801
I liked Karthik.

1055
01:02:36,649 --> 01:02:38,967
We decided to stay together.
So, we took a flat.

1056
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:39,770
Hmm...

1057
01:02:39,865 --> 01:02:42,190
If she would have taken flats
with every guy she liked,

1058
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:45,711
she would be having 40 to
50 flats in the city by now.

1059
01:02:46,332 --> 01:02:48,035
She might have seen something
in him at some point of time.

1060
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:49,246
That's why she fell for him.

1061
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:51,563
- Did you like him that much?
- Shut up!

1062
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:53,099
All of you shut up
and leave this room.

1063
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:54,289
Come on, get up. Go.

1064
01:02:54,443 --> 01:02:55,443
Go now.

1065
01:02:56,795 --> 01:02:58,946
He doesn't have any clarity on himself.

1066
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,401
How did you trust him?

1067
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:03,322
I trust Karthik's commitment.

1068
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,490
Karthik

1069
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:18,126
Love means bearing both
good and bad in a person.

1070
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:20,282
Past is past.

1071
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,789
There is no need for any
explanations for the past events.

1072
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:26,152
From now on, you should have me
as the only girl in your life.

1073
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:34,126
Yes. Done!

1074
01:03:34,225 --> 01:03:37,737
You shouldn't take advantage
of me as I'm staying with you.

1075
01:03:37,777 --> 01:03:39,865
I will never do that.
All I do is what you like.

1076
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,877
I can't tolerate if you
disrespect or insult me.

1077
01:03:42,977 --> 01:03:46,222
I swear on the land and the sky,
I'll never get you in that situation.

1078
01:03:46,494 --> 01:03:49,042
I'll place you in my heart and
take the utmost care of you, Keerthi.

1079
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,637
Think it over and tell me, Karthik.

1080
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:52,610
I live every moment with you, Keerthi.

1081
01:03:53,217 --> 01:03:54,315
Welcome to my life.

1082
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:05,035
The words of men are just
writings on a seashore.

1083
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,219
Thanks for your advise.

1084
01:04:06,546 --> 01:04:08,946
I feel Karthik is not
a correct guy for you.

1085
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:20,437
Get down, I'll tell you.

1086
01:04:24,162 --> 01:04:25,796
Why did you stop here?
What's the matter?

1087
01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:28,997
We're going to stay in this house.

1088
01:04:29,993 --> 01:04:31,953
How come she gelled up
so quickly for just a hint.

1089
01:04:32,272 --> 01:04:35,361
- What?
- I said the house is beautiful.

1090
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:36,523
- Let's go.
- Alright.

1091
01:04:37,994 --> 01:04:40,034
We won't have any problems
with the landlord, do we?

1092
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:43,468
Hmm... This is kitchen.

1093
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:51,315
Huh? This bed is awesome.

1094
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:54,168
This is hall. Okay.

1095
01:04:57,866 --> 01:05:00,231
Everthing is good.
This is a fully furnished flat.

1096
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:04,100
But I don't understand why we
need a double bedroom flat.

1097
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:06,506
It is that only two of us
would be staying in here, isn't it?

1098
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,090
One bedroom for you
and another one for me.

1099
01:05:09,231 --> 01:05:11,077
In that case,
why should we live together?

1100
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:15,142
We aren't husband-wife to sleep
together by keeping legs on each other.

1101
01:05:15,305 --> 01:05:16,840
We're just living together.

1102
01:05:17,756 --> 01:05:18,352
What does it mean?

1103
01:05:18,776 --> 01:05:19,776
It means...

1104
01:05:21,186 --> 01:05:23,712
We should take it to another level
only when we both feel it together.

1105
01:05:23,736 --> 01:05:24,736
It applies to both of us.

1106
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:25,549
Understood.

1107
01:05:25,749 --> 01:05:27,556
You're having a great clarity.

1108
01:05:27,872 --> 01:05:29,670
- Seems like you are born to play.
- What?

1109
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:33,127
I mean you are trying to live in happiness

1110
01:05:33,327 --> 01:05:34,327
Discipline.

1111
01:05:35,054 --> 01:05:38,079
I'm Simhadri who
disciplines the discipline.

1112
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:39,346
Who the hell is this freaking person?

1113
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,499
House owner...
House owner.

1114
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:42,534
You remember all the things
I told you, didn't you?

1115
01:05:42,558 --> 01:05:43,558
I remember them, uncle.

1116
01:05:44,255 --> 01:05:45,455
We have to keep the flat neat.

1117
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,537
We shouldn't drill nails to the walls.

1118
01:05:47,997 --> 01:05:50,397
- We shouldn't slam the doors.
- But there is one more thing.

1119
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:53,306
The most important thing is
that I hate sound pollution.

1120
01:05:53,768 --> 01:05:54,261
What?

1121
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,469
You shouldn't quarrel or
keep high volume of TV.

1122
01:05:58,581 --> 01:05:59,981
You won't have that problem, uncle.

1123
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:01,541
Alright.

1124
01:06:02,106 --> 01:06:03,526
Live harmoniously.

1125
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,733
Don't have kids.

1126
01:06:06,145 --> 01:06:08,320
Our country is already debt-ridden.

1127
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:10,943
Is it? Why don't you lend
some money to the country?

1128
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,377
Discipline. Huh!

1129
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:19,408
"This night is sweet"

1130
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:23,083
"This tender breeze is romantic"

1131
01:06:35,718 --> 01:06:36,718
- Keerthi.
- Yes.

1132
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,650
Ask me if you need a soap or
anything like that. I'll give it to you.

1133
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:41,366
Why the hell did you come here?

1134
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:44,227
Just in case you need anything,
I'm here to give them to you.

1135
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,610
I don't need anything.
Everything is available here.

1136
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:47,889
Get the hell out from here.

1137
01:06:47,913 --> 01:06:49,396
Alright.
Come out quickly.

1138
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:50,694
We're getting delayed.

1139
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:52,756
Why? Where are we going?

1140
01:06:53,249 --> 01:06:54,967
That's a long journey.

1141
01:06:55,999 --> 01:06:58,679
It can't be understood when
explained in words. I'll show you. Come.

1142
01:07:01,169 --> 01:07:07,083
"Ee Reyi Thiyyanidi
from the movie Johnny"

1143
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:18,611
Why doesn't she show it to me instead?

1144
01:07:25,973 --> 01:07:26,998
Sprays are not needed.

1145
01:07:29,656 --> 01:07:30,660
The aroma of these flowers is enough.

1146
01:07:30,684 --> 01:07:31,833
Why did you come again?

1147
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:35,575
Crazy girl! The guys are like water,

1148
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:38,111
Wherever there is a
slope they flow towards it.

1149
01:07:38,511 --> 01:07:39,002
That's it.

1150
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,495
The girls are like lotus
flowers floating on water.

1151
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,385
They get damaged if touched.

1152
01:07:43,736 --> 01:07:44,748
Just go away from here.

1153
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:55,237
Wow! She is gorgeous.

1154
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:58,068
- Wow! Awesome!
- What's awesome?

1155
01:07:58,464 --> 01:08:02,165
It is the aroma of jasmine flowers.

1156
01:08:02,452 --> 01:08:02,966
Hmm...

1157
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:03,989
Hey, what's this?

1158
01:08:04,177 --> 01:08:05,412
Huh? What happened?

1159
01:08:07,261 --> 01:08:08,261
Hey...

1160
01:08:08,377 --> 01:08:09,588
Shut up and leave.

1161
01:08:09,688 --> 01:08:12,208
"Aadavari Matalaku Arthale
Verule song from the movie Kushi"

1162
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,680
Shucks!

1163
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:24,594
Were you born in a wrong time?

1164
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,799
The dogs are better. They enjoy happily.

1165
01:08:27,975 --> 01:08:30,055
All the freaking restrictions
are confined to humans.

1166
01:08:30,336 --> 01:08:31,336
Shucks!

1167
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:33,991
- Will you allow me to have dinner?
- Oh! Have it.

1168
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:35,763
- Go, sit there.
- Come on, have it.

1169
01:08:35,787 --> 01:08:36,971
You eat and serve me too.

1170
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:41,612
The flowers will wither.

1171
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:43,405
And my mood will be off.

1172
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,088
- Keerthi
- Yes.

1173
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:49,044
I don't know why but I
feel intoxicated today.

1174
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:50,953
Yeah. Of course, you'd feel so.

1175
01:08:55,804 --> 01:08:58,723
Okay. Good night.
Sweet dreams.

1176
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:01,900
Why do I sweet dreams
when you are with me?

1177
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:04,912
Oye! Don't keep such hopes today.

1178
01:09:22,347 --> 01:09:23,540
Where did he go?

1179
01:09:27,472 --> 01:09:28,502
Hmm...

1180
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:31,425
That's not his ideology.

1181
01:09:32,648 --> 01:09:35,648
Wow! What an analysis you did!

1182
01:09:40,121 --> 01:09:41,121
Shucks!

1183
01:10:21,744 --> 01:10:27,707
"There is an immense pleasure which
can't be concealed in the heart"

1184

1185
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:42,608
"Even if we combine the sea and sky"

1186
01:10:44,733 --> 01:10:50,706
"It is not possible to
measure the pleasure"

1187
01:11:25,819 --> 01:11:30,345
"The heart transformed into a bird"

1188
01:11:31,097 --> 01:11:33,081
"and started its journey"

1189
01:11:33,397 --> 01:11:37,387
"A wave of happiness"

1190
01:11:37,675 --> 01:11:40,315
"rose in my heart today"

1191
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:44,449

pleasure that can't be bore by hands"

1195
01:12:05,692 --> 01:12:11,603
"There is an immense pleasure which
can't be concealed in the heart"

1196
01:12:29,594 --> 01:12:33,571
"This is the excitement"

1197
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:36,303
"of living in heaven every day"

1198
01:12:37,713 --> 01:12:41,503
"The thoughts of winning over my past"

"A happiness that was

"There is an immense pleasure which

1204
01:13:41,613 --> 01:13:42,118
Leave me.

1205
01:13:42,521 --> 01:13:43,917
Don't you overact.
Leave me.

1206
01:13:44,565 --> 01:13:45,565
Get me a coffee too.

1207
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:50,697
Why don't you prepare it and give me?

1208
01:13:51,512 --> 01:13:53,199
One has to do their own work.

1209
01:13:53,591 --> 01:13:55,783
Here, no one is going to serve anyone.

1210
01:13:56,252 --> 01:13:57,252
Huh!

1211
01:14:00,584 --> 01:14:01,584
Okay...

1212
01:14:14,178 --> 01:14:15,284
Where shall have breakfast?

1213
01:14:23,288 --> 01:14:25,117
Okay, they didn't drill any nails here.

1214
01:14:29,579 --> 01:14:31,537
Why is the kitchen very clean?

1215
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:34,277
Seems like they are using no
other rooms except the bedroom.

1216
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,325
Alright, the walls are fine.

1217
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:42,525
Have you been
cleaning the floor regularly?

1218
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:44,729
Can't you see there?

1219
01:14:46,823 --> 01:14:48,265
I did see it. That's alright.

1220
01:14:49,014 --> 01:14:50,503
But keep a tab on your water usage,

1221
01:14:51,143 --> 01:14:53,703
As the people of this city
are facing a severe water crisis.

1222
01:14:54,452 --> 01:14:57,487
And there is a power cut at the time
when the municipality disperses the water.

1223
01:14:57,511 --> 01:15:01,369
Look, close the taps
when you leave to office.

1224
01:15:01,862 --> 01:15:03,330
And regarding those electrical switches,

1225
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:03,945
it's upto you,

1226
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,913
Because you'd be the
one who pays the bill.

1227
01:15:09,497 --> 01:15:10,636
Discipline.

1228
01:15:11,267 --> 01:15:13,979
I'm Simhadri who
disciplines the discipline.

1229
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:17,890
Be careful.

1230
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,895
He is doing too much.

1231
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:22,359
Huh!

1232
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:24,601
Every dog has its day.

1233
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:26,565
There would be someday for this dog too.

1234
01:15:27,077 --> 01:15:28,967
That day, I'll make him drool.

1235
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,057
Conduct Archana, priest.

1236
01:15:43,093 --> 01:15:44,301
Okay.

1237
01:15:44,525 --> 01:15:46,445
Son, what's your name and Gotra?

1238
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:48,275
My name is Karthik and
my Gotra is Paidipala.

1239
01:15:52,193 --> 01:15:53,353
Tell him your name and Gotra.

1240
01:15:53,517 --> 01:15:55,726
My name is Sai Suma Keerthi
and my Gotra is Kaundinya.

1241
01:15:56,061 --> 01:15:59,005
The last name and the Gotra of the husband
are also applicable to wife.

1242
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,420
She's not my wife.

1243
01:16:00,488 --> 01:16:01,488
Ah!

1244
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:02,852
He's not my husband.

1245
01:16:03,206 --> 01:16:04,467
But you came together, didn't you?

1246
01:16:04,491 --> 01:16:05,626
Because we're living together.

1247
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:08,602
Son, be clear without confusing me.

1248
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:13,060
'Saha-Jeevanam'.
It means a live-in relationship.

1249
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:14,425
Oh God!

1250
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:16,813
Whatever the expenditure
is, we share it equally.

1251
01:16:16,837 --> 01:16:18,702
We share food when we're hungry.

1252
01:16:21,145 --> 01:16:22,590
I understood it.
Enough.

1253
01:16:30,123 --> 01:16:31,324
We'll leave now, priest.

1254
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:32,662
Alright, son.

1255
01:16:32,702 --> 01:16:35,447
Earlier, people used to live together
only if they are attached by hearts.

1256
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,440
But these days, it's just people who
are living together without any feelings.

1257
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:38,515
Oh God!

1258
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:46,267
Overall, you have created a new way.

1259
01:16:46,554 --> 01:16:47,228
All the best.

1260
01:16:47,467 --> 01:16:47,979
Thank you.

1261
01:16:48,265 --> 01:16:49,422
When are you throwing a reception party?

1262
01:16:49,446 --> 01:16:53,035
We aren't married to invite
everyone and throw a party.

1263
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:55,170
Just we're living together.

1264
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,625
It means we want to live with free will

1265
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:59,426
By the way,
are you done with your first night?

1266
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:00,696
We're done with our last night too.

1267
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,359
If you have kids in the future, would
they call you mom and dad or...

1268
01:17:04,799 --> 01:17:06,797
I don't like having kids.

1269
01:17:06,837 --> 01:17:07,941
You are way ahead of us.

1270
01:17:08,466 --> 01:17:09,866
Of course, we have to be like that.

1271
01:17:10,484 --> 01:17:12,181
Well, you both are alike.

1272
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:17,347
Sulochana...
Please, Sulochana. Please.

1273
01:17:17,707 --> 01:17:19,595
These aren't arms.
Consider them to be your feet, Sulochana.

1274
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:22,013
Please talk to me, Sulochana. Please.

1275
01:17:23,201 --> 01:17:23,686
Huh!

1276
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:24,776
What you are holding

1277
01:17:24,968 --> 01:17:26,862
- are neither my hands nor my feet.
- Whatever!

1278
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:27,906
Leave me.

1279
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:30,082
- Don't squeeze my stomach.
- Talk to me, I'll leave.

1280
01:17:30,157 --> 01:17:31,498
Don't squeeze my stomach.

1281
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:34,361
I'll leave only if you talk to me.

1282
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,390
It's urgent dude.
Please leave me.

1283
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:39,263
No, I won't leave you. I'll leave
only if you agree to talk to me.

1284
01:17:39,461 --> 01:17:40,461
Will you leave me or not?

1285
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:42,292
I can't live without you, Sulochana.

1286
01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:43,641
Please, Sulochana.

1287
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:47,254
As long as you consider Karthik as your
friend, you think in a perverted manner.

1288
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:49,382
The only work of Karthik
is to mislead everyone.

1289
01:17:49,653 --> 01:17:51,057
This is your last warning,

1290
01:17:51,157 --> 01:17:53,365
Promise me that you'd break
off the friendship with him.

1291
01:17:53,457 --> 01:17:54,546
I swear on you, Sulochana.

1292
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:56,709
Does it mean that it is alright if I die?

1293
01:17:57,136 --> 01:17:58,726
Oh no! I don't mean that.

1294
01:17:58,922 --> 01:18:01,411
I swear on myself,
I won't even let Karthik come beside me.

1295
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:02,251
Can I trust you?

1296
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:04,054
I don't I consider that idiot
to be more important than you.

1297
01:18:04,078 --> 01:18:05,078
That's good.

1298
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:10,784
Sulochana,
I won't even see Karthik's face.

1299
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,470
Hey, Karthik!

1300
01:18:24,268 --> 01:18:25,569
Tell me.

1301
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:27,028
Why the hell are you bashing me?

1302
01:18:27,052 --> 01:18:27,519
Hey...

1303
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:30,284
Wait... Ouch! Respect.

1304
01:18:30,577 --> 01:18:31,577
Show some respect.

1305
01:18:31,912 --> 01:18:35,328
Why the hell should we
respect you? Freaking respect!

1306
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:38,365
Don't you know that you should
repay the loan which you took from us?

1307
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:39,832
Don't you feel it unfair
to levy 60,000 rupees

1308
01:18:39,856 --> 01:18:41,140
as interest for the principle
amount of 1,00,00 rupees.

1309
01:18:41,164 --> 01:18:42,164
Is it?

1310
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:47,085
Aren't you earning some lakhs of rupees
by pressing a keyboard in your office?

1311
01:18:47,428 --> 01:18:48,428
What's that?

1312
01:18:48,455 --> 01:18:49,133
Computer.

1313
01:18:49,356 --> 01:18:50,356
Yes...

1314
01:18:50,752 --> 01:18:52,532
Aren't you being paid the
amount you've asked for?

1315
01:18:52,556 --> 01:18:53,316
The same applies here.

1316
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,716
If you play tricks and say no,

1317
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,637
I'll kick you between your legs.

1318
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:00,634
Then, you'd become
unfit to start a family.

1319
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,825
Come on, make the phone call.

1320
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:05,477
Call your family members
and ask them to get the money.

1321
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:07,481
Give me four days,
I'll pay the total amount.

1322
01:19:07,787 --> 01:19:09,956
Not only that you can't go to
your home until the payment,

1323
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,756
you can't even attend your nature calls.

1324
01:19:12,117 --> 01:19:15,255
There is only one guy in my circle
who can arrange such a large amount.

1325
01:19:15,336 --> 01:19:16,336
Then, call him.

1326
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,620
He isn't a gentleman like me.

1327
01:19:17,872 --> 01:19:19,512
It is not a problem even if he is mental.

1328
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:20,641
Your bad luck!

1329
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:22,041
Give him the phone.

1330
01:19:22,802 --> 01:19:23,351
Come on, call him idiot.

1331
01:19:23,573 --> 01:19:24,130
I'm on it.

1332
01:19:24,354 --> 01:19:25,354
I'm coming.

1333
01:19:29,772 --> 01:19:31,626
Let him come, I'll smash both of you.

1334
01:19:37,165 --> 01:19:38,235
What's this sound?

1335
01:19:38,321 --> 01:19:40,001
That's the sound of
my friend's motorcycle.

1336
01:19:44,524 --> 01:19:46,046
Look, he's here.

1337
01:19:46,646 --> 01:19:47,646
He's my friend.

1338
01:20:05,322 --> 01:20:07,209
We're unable to bear your exposing.

1339
01:20:16,486 --> 01:20:18,533
We're getting delayed for
the party. Shall we get started?

1340
01:20:18,557 --> 01:20:19,557
- Yes.
- Then, let's go.

1341
01:20:19,621 --> 01:20:20,750
Thank you dude.

1342
01:20:20,794 --> 01:20:22,435
Look, brother

1343
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,350
If you want to take him from this place,
you should pay the amount.

1344
01:20:27,426 --> 01:20:29,328
Did you call me brother?
I'm least bothered about relations.

1345
01:20:29,352 --> 01:20:30,352
I'll do only settlement.

1346
01:20:31,397 --> 01:20:32,471
I'll pay the total amount.

1347
01:20:34,099 --> 01:20:36,362
I didn't just pay the principal amount,
it included the interest too.

1348
01:20:36,386 --> 01:20:37,386
Enjoy!

1349
01:20:37,641 --> 01:20:38,816
Hey, take the money.

1350
01:20:39,341 --> 01:20:40,479
But on one condition,

1351
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:44,686
The person who wants to take that
amount should strip from top to bottom.

1352
01:20:44,854 --> 01:20:46,974
Won't you let them take the
money if they don't strip?

1353
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,010
Try doing that.

1354
01:20:48,658 --> 01:20:52,782
Hey, when he's flaunting his
pride despite standing between us,

1355
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:55,935
Why are you simply watching
as if you aren't pride men?

1356
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,162
Should I formally invite
you to bash him up?

1357
01:21:00,262 --> 01:21:01,928
Hey...

1358
01:21:02,352 --> 01:21:03,352
Oh no!

1359
01:21:04,992 --> 01:21:06,185
Nice!

1360
01:21:06,286 --> 01:21:07,286
Hey...

1361
01:21:07,941 --> 01:21:09,556
Hey, bash them up. I'll be aside.

1362
01:21:17,535 --> 01:21:18,535
Whoa!

1363
01:21:18,855 --> 01:21:19,855
Pundru!

1364
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,340
Bash him up.

1365
01:21:40,778 --> 01:21:42,584
Attaboy!
Attaboy!

1366
01:21:42,792 --> 01:21:44,271
Break his bones.

1367
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:46,710
Come on, smash him.

1368
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,111
Sister, he respects ladies.

1369
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:15,243
Yes, he has a lot of respect for ladies.

1370
01:22:15,419 --> 01:22:16,741
Come on, show them.

1371
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:21,675
Nice...
Even the stick is very handy.

1372
01:22:23,455 --> 01:22:25,233
Hey... Come on, get up.

1373
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:27,471
Oh my! He's even thrashing.

1374
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:33,055
Oh no! He's here.
Hey fatty, bash him up.

1375
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:34,534
Bash him up?

1376
01:22:34,634 --> 01:22:36,495
His whipping is making my
saree stick to my skin.

1377
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:39,303
Generally, I bash everyone
but he's bashing me instead.

1378
01:22:39,827 --> 01:22:43,923
Oh no! Oh God! He's bashing me up at
the place where my hands can't reach.

1379
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:46,195
Hey brother, please stop.

1380
01:22:46,683 --> 01:22:49,587
I neither want your principal amount
nor interest. Here's your money.

1381
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:51,872
Why are you cheating
in between this game?

1382
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,333
This is not cheating, brother.

1383
01:22:53,541 --> 01:22:56,114
I plead by
touching your feet. Keep your money.

1384
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:58,050
- Please spare us.
- If you ever,

1385
01:22:58,494 --> 01:23:01,405
exploit in the name of
compound interest or any other interest,

1386
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,325
- Here, take your amount.
- I'll whip you with this stick.

1387
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:09,711
- Take this money.
- Keep it with you. But be careful.

1388
01:23:10,349 --> 01:23:11,696
Oh man, he's a good guy.

1389
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:13,467
Stay blessed.

1390
01:23:19,096 --> 01:23:20,096
Hey...

1391
01:23:20,581 --> 01:23:21,581
What's he doing?

1392
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:25,678
- Sulochana kissed me twice.
- Sulochana kissed me twice.

1393
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:28,602
Hell with you kisses.
You told this 30 times by now.

1394
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,968
If he's very excited just for a kiss,

1395
01:23:31,276 --> 01:23:33,737
I can't imagine what happens to
him when he faces the real task.

1396
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:35,636
He'll faint by the smell.

1397
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,437
- Huh?
- I mean the smell of jasmine flowers.

1398
01:23:37,838 --> 01:23:38,959
- Who came at this time?
- I'll go and check.

1399
01:23:38,983 --> 01:23:39,607
The watchman.

1400
01:23:39,768 --> 01:23:41,976
Did he come today when I
asked him to show up yesterday?

1401
01:23:44,343 --> 01:23:44,835
Awe!

1402
01:23:44,926 --> 01:23:46,500
- Sorry.
- Discipline.

1403
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:49,642
I'm Simhadri who
disciplines the discipline.

1404
01:23:50,422 --> 01:23:52,502
Sir, this is very chilled.
Would you like to have it?

1405
01:23:52,591 --> 01:23:55,119
Hey, how dare you drink
beer inside my house?

1406
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:56,888
On top of that,
how dare you offer me that?

1407
01:23:56,968 --> 01:23:57,968
Sorry, forget it.

1408
01:23:58,172 --> 01:23:59,492
Let me decide on this matter now.

1409
01:23:59,767 --> 01:24:02,334
Keerthi... Keethi.
Where is Keerthi?

1410
01:24:02,382 --> 01:24:03,033
- She is over there.
- She is over there.

1411
01:24:03,193 --> 01:24:04,222
- Keerthi
- Hey, stop it.

1412
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:05,594
Uncle, she is in the kitchen.

1413
01:24:05,618 --> 01:24:07,755
- Let me decide what you're doing now.
- She's in the kitchen, uncle.

1414
01:24:07,779 --> 01:24:09,810
When a gang of people boozing here,

1415
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:11,826
How dare you to support
them instead of scolding?

1416
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,531
What do you think this is,
a house or a bar?

1417
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:14,647
Keerthi...
Where is Keerthi?

1418
01:24:14,839 --> 01:24:15,839
Keerthi...
Ouch!

1419
01:24:16,073 --> 01:24:19,550
I'm seeing you from day one I came
to this flat, what's your problem?

1420
01:24:19,842 --> 01:24:21,661
- What's it?
- Are you threatening me?

1421
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:23,149
Discipline.

1422
01:24:23,453 --> 01:24:25,597
I'm Simhadri who
disciplines the discipline.

1423
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:27,117
Discipline, my foot!

1424
01:24:28,081 --> 01:24:29,170
What would you do?

1425
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,138
Do you know what this is?

1426
01:24:37,495 --> 01:24:39,445
You'll be dead if I stab you.

1427
01:24:41,004 --> 01:24:43,299
- Come on, move.
- Just a minute.

1428
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:44,930
Discipline

1429
01:24:46,713 --> 01:24:48,617
Move... Go now.

1430
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,434
Oh man!

1431
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:51,451
If you come again...

1432
01:24:51,923 --> 01:24:53,012
Excuse me dude.

1433
01:24:53,328 --> 01:24:56,027
Why is leaving like a cat
when he entered like a lion?

1434
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,244
I just shown him a sample action scene.

1435
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,958
Oh! Very nice.

1436
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:00,746
Come on, cheers!

1437
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:03,357
Otherwise, would he teach
me about discipline?

1438
01:25:07,517 --> 01:25:09,028
Hey, what are these sounds?

1439
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:11,044
Do they think it as a home or dance class?

1440
01:25:11,168 --> 01:25:12,241
Go, warn them.

1441
01:25:14,589 --> 01:25:16,163
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1442
01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:18,978
No... He would place carrot.

1443
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:20,250
What's with placing carrot?

1444
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:24,606
You don't know about him.
He would place carrot.

1445
01:25:24,614 --> 01:25:26,934
Hell with you! Are you a man?
Let me handle him.

1446
01:25:27,306 --> 01:25:28,443
Please don't go, dear.

1447
01:25:28,635 --> 01:25:30,267
He would place a carrot for you too.

1448
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:31,430
Please listen to me.

1449
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,777
What the hell is your carrot fuss?

1450
01:25:34,282 --> 01:25:36,766
You don't know it.
He would place only carrot.

1451
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,149
I kept my bowl...

1452
01:25:38,173 --> 01:25:39,387
Hey...

1453
01:25:39,893 --> 01:25:41,913
I think the owner
came with a backup.

1454
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:43,153
- Let's welcome him.
- Seems like the dose was not enough.

1455
01:25:43,177 --> 01:25:45,130
- Let's make him do Nagini dance.
- He's going to suffer.

1456
01:25:45,154 --> 01:25:46,622
- Finish him off
- Nagini dance.

1457
01:25:46,877 --> 01:25:47,877
Hey...

1458
01:25:48,422 --> 01:25:50,294
- Oh, is it you?
- Whom did you expect?

1459
01:25:50,371 --> 01:25:51,371
I thought it was him.

1460
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:53,501
What's this?

1461
01:25:53,722 --> 01:25:55,958
Oh man! Do I have to explain it again?

1462
01:25:56,677 --> 01:25:57,939
This is called as beer.

1463
01:25:58,363 --> 01:25:59,654
And that's a chicken
starter and those are chips.

1464
01:25:59,662 --> 01:26:00,662
Do you want it?

1465
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:03,543
- Are you kidding me?
- No, Keerthi. It's true.

1466
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,727
- What do you say dude?
- How would I know?

1467
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:05,868
I don't have a habit, do I?

1468
01:26:06,068 --> 01:26:08,228
- I just sat simply.
- Get the remaining beers outside.

1469
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:10,328
- Bye, Karthik
- Bye, Karthik

1470
01:26:10,352 --> 01:26:12,221
- Sit down, my bottle isn't empty yet.
- Hey...

1471
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:13,737
- Hey
- I can't handle dude.

1472
01:26:13,988 --> 01:26:15,576
- What happened to you?
- Move aside.

1473
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:19,492
Don't tell Sulochana
that I boozed with him.

1474
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,838
Because she kissed me twice.

1475
01:26:21,961 --> 01:26:23,243
-She kissed me

1476
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:24,616
- when I told her that he isn't a good guy
- Hey, you idiot!

1477
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,339
Did you use me for two kisses?

1478
01:26:26,531 --> 01:26:27,531
Hell!

1479
01:26:28,488 --> 01:26:30,327
- Hey, take him away.
- Please, Keerthi.

1480
01:26:30,423 --> 01:26:31,648
Kindly don't tell her.

1481
01:26:31,855 --> 01:26:33,344
Hey, you can tell the
story of your two kisses later.

1482
01:26:33,368 --> 01:26:35,326
- Keerthi, there is no other way.
- Take him away.

1483
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:37,270
The smell got absorbed on
the clothes, that's it.

1484
01:26:37,482 --> 01:26:40,208
- Please Keerthi, understand my plight
- Hey, just go dude.

1485
01:26:40,358 --> 01:26:41,655
- Let me finish my story.
- You can tell it later.

1486
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:42,684
Shut up! Shut your mouth.

1487
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,128
Why did you arrange a
booze party without my permission?

1488
01:26:50,233 --> 01:26:53,330
What do you mean? Do I have to
take your permission to booze?

1489
01:26:55,358 --> 01:26:56,664
Don't I have such freedom?

1490
01:26:57,193 --> 01:26:58,473
This flat belongs to both of us.

1491
01:26:58,975 --> 01:27:02,094
So, I don't like you doing these
kind of things without my permission.

1492
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:03,910
Okay, leave it.

1493
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:05,451
This won't repeat again.

1494
01:27:06,798 --> 01:27:07,798
Okay.

1495
01:27:10,121 --> 01:27:11,830
- Who would clean that?
- Okay.

1496
01:27:12,452 --> 01:27:13,775
We clean our mess.

1497
01:27:14,228 --> 01:27:15,228
Whoa!

1498
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,368
Hey, take out your hand.

1499
01:27:30,854 --> 01:27:31,854
Hey, get off me.

1500
01:27:32,259 --> 01:27:35,675
- Go, sleep in your room.
- Is it projection?

1501
01:27:36,535 --> 01:27:39,037
Listen to me.
Go, sleep in your room.

1502
01:27:40,429 --> 01:27:44,701
Please.
Fight with me anywhere but not in the bed.

1503
01:27:44,919 --> 01:27:46,326
- Please
- Damn! Get up.

1504
01:27:46,426 --> 01:27:47,504
Go to your room.

1505
01:27:49,595 --> 01:27:50,761
- Muah!
- Hey, get up

1506
01:27:51,137 --> 01:27:52,872
- Go now. Go, sleep in your room.
- Please.

1507
01:27:53,058 --> 01:27:53,517
Go now.

1508
01:27:53,926 --> 01:27:54,926
- Please.
- Just go.

1509
01:27:56,796 --> 01:27:57,876
- Go away
- Please, Keerthi.

1510
01:27:57,921 --> 01:27:59,206
Allow me for once.
Please...

1511
01:27:59,986 --> 01:28:01,919
Ah! Okay... Alright!

1512
01:28:36,387 --> 01:28:37,387
Mosquito...

1513
01:28:37,706 --> 01:28:40,292
Mosquito...
Mosquitoes entered into the new flat.

1514
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,596
You sleep.
Hey mosquito, come with me.

1515
01:28:42,703 --> 01:28:43,838
You sleep...

1516
01:28:43,994 --> 01:28:45,309
Let's go...

1517
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:47,853
I don't have an entry and you
want to come in. Let's go.

1518
01:28:57,852 --> 01:28:58,852
Keerthi...

1519
01:29:00,299 --> 01:29:01,379
Keerthi...

1520
01:29:03,637 --> 01:29:05,546
She spends a lot of time in the bathroom.

1521
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:15,917
Here are the clothes,

1522
01:29:18,876 --> 01:29:19,876
vegetables,

1523
01:29:20,331 --> 01:29:23,567
Keerthi, shall I place the vegetables
in the refrigerator or in the kitchen?

1524
01:29:24,807 --> 01:29:26,031
What's she doing inside?

1525
01:29:26,198 --> 01:29:27,198
Keerthi...

1526
01:29:28,685 --> 01:29:29,685
Keerthi...

1527
01:29:33,537 --> 01:29:34,537
Keerthi...

1528
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,740
Keerthi

1529
01:29:41,525 --> 01:29:42,125
What happened?

1530
01:29:42,488 --> 01:29:43,130
Are you okay?

1531
01:29:43,368 --> 01:29:44,449
Shall we visit the doctor?

1532
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:46,012
Not needed.
This is ladies problem.

1533
01:29:46,121 --> 01:29:47,139
It happens every month.

1534
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:49,503
There is a tablet over there.
Open it and give me.

1535
01:29:56,627 --> 01:29:57,627
Be relaxed.

1536
01:29:59,943 --> 01:30:03,071
Keerthi...
Keerthi, what happened?

1537
01:30:03,645 --> 01:30:04,645
Are you okay?

1538
01:30:06,107 --> 01:30:07,107
Relax for some time.

1539
01:30:30,885 --> 01:30:33,626
Why am I in his room?

1540
01:31:03,062 --> 01:31:04,062
Good morning.

1541
01:31:06,257 --> 01:31:07,257
Good morning.

1542
01:31:07,725 --> 01:31:09,739
Why did you bring coffee today?

1543
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:13,243
Because you took a lot of
effort for me last night.

1544
01:31:14,223 --> 01:31:16,639
Is it? Do you want to
suffice it with just coffee?

1545
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:17,972
That's not going to work.

1546
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:20,794
I'm tired of doing
service to you last night.

1547
01:31:21,467 --> 01:31:22,891
You have to do all my works today.

1548
01:31:23,203 --> 01:31:24,820
I understood your stupid logic.

1549
01:31:25,252 --> 01:31:27,796
This is Keerthi.
Keerthi never keeps any debts.

1550
01:31:28,097 --> 01:31:29,372
I'll repay with interest.

1551
01:31:29,496 --> 01:31:31,238
Tell me,
what do you want as breakfast?

1552
01:31:31,429 --> 01:31:33,098
Idli, Vada, Pongal, Puri and Dosa,

1553
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:34,190
Choose whatever you want.

1554
01:31:34,518 --> 01:31:35,518
I want Dosa.

1555
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:36,624
Go, get freshen up.

1556
01:31:37,105 --> 01:31:38,768
Add chilli and onions too.

1557
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:47,132
Here's your Dosa.

1558
01:31:47,344 --> 01:31:48,344
Wow!

1559
01:31:52,036 --> 01:31:53,956
What do you want me to do
the next thing for you?

1560
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:55,472
Shoe polish?

1561
01:31:55,547 --> 01:31:56,635
White or black or brown?

1562
01:31:57,222 --> 01:31:57,758
Black.

1563
01:31:58,028 --> 01:31:59,421
Black?
Alright, give me a moment.

1564
01:32:01,538 --> 01:32:02,538
Your shoes are ready.

1565
01:32:06,717 --> 01:32:07,241
Keep it there.

1566
01:32:07,697 --> 01:32:09,217
What's the next thing?
What shall I do?

1567
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:13,173
Do you want me to wash your clothes?
I'll be back in two minutes.

1568
01:32:16,424 --> 01:32:17,664
Is that it?
Or do you have more?

1569
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:19,656
Umm...

1570
01:32:24,907 --> 01:32:25,491
Is that it?

1571
01:32:25,615 --> 01:32:26,849
Come on, remove.
Remove this shirt.

1572
01:32:26,873 --> 01:32:28,193
- Even this one?
- Yes, remove it.

1573
01:32:28,599 --> 01:32:29,599
Okay.

1574
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:33,229
Hmm...

1575
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,660
A handful of surf isn't
sufficient to clean his dirt.

1576
01:32:35,839 --> 01:32:37,319
Huh!
I need to put in the entire surf.

1577
01:32:40,058 --> 01:32:41,058
Huh?

1578
01:32:43,328 --> 01:32:44,328
Shucks!

1579
01:32:44,502 --> 01:32:46,902
Sorry, the power is gone.

1580
01:32:47,947 --> 01:32:50,347
If there is no power,
opt out for the conventional way.

1581
01:32:50,367 --> 01:32:51,807
You have to stick to the commitment.

1582
01:32:52,305 --> 01:32:54,105
If you quickly wash
them and iron the clothes,

1583
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:55,313
I'll be going to the office.

1584
01:32:55,846 --> 01:32:57,373
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1585
01:32:57,948 --> 01:32:59,748
I don't have any other
choice to wear clothes.

1586
01:33:00,838 --> 01:33:02,594
- Go now. It's getting delayed.
- Okay.

1587
01:33:10,804 --> 01:33:11,988
Let me see what she is doing.

1588
01:33:24,216 --> 01:33:25,216
Here...

1589
01:33:30,714 --> 01:33:32,183
When was the power restored?

1590
01:33:32,547 --> 01:33:34,672
The power is restored the
very next moment it went off.

1591
01:33:34,696 --> 01:33:35,696
- You...
- Hey...

1592
01:33:36,887 --> 01:33:38,487
I don't have any energy to even hit you.

1593
01:33:38,789 --> 01:33:39,810
Saddist idiot!

1594
01:33:40,518 --> 01:33:41,518
Here...

1595
01:33:43,337 --> 01:33:44,232
I, Pranav

1596
01:33:44,275 --> 01:33:45,091
I, Pranav

1597
01:33:45,282 --> 01:33:46,282
I, Sulochana

1598
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:47,600
- Would marry Sulochana
- Would marry Pranav

1599
01:33:47,624 --> 01:33:49,762
- From now on
- Till death separates us.

1600
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:51,296
In the witness of the holy spirit,

1601
01:33:51,372 --> 01:33:52,705
Both in happiness and sorrow,

1602
01:33:52,881 --> 01:33:54,121
With my pure heart

1603
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:57,048
- I accept you as my husband.
- I accept you as my wife.

1604
01:34:06,151 --> 01:34:08,735
Your wedding is done
in the witness of God.

1605
01:34:08,811 --> 01:34:13,513
So this is the life that is
arranged by God and live happily.

1606
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:14,721
Amen.

1607
01:34:14,981 --> 01:34:15,981
Amen.

1608
01:34:19,867 --> 01:34:21,297
The arrangements are
very good, aren't they?

1609
01:34:21,321 --> 01:34:22,321
Yeah... Yeah.

1610
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:23,837
- Congratulations dude.
- Congratulations

1611
01:34:23,845 --> 01:34:25,481
- Where's Karthik?
- He's on the way.

1612
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:27,417
Thank you.

1613
01:34:29,155 --> 01:34:31,567
Hey Keerthi,
didn't you get ready yet?

1614
01:34:31,614 --> 01:34:32,614
I'm not attending.

1615
01:34:33,152 --> 01:34:34,035
You didn't attend the wedding.

1616
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:36,416
And it wouldn't
be good if you don't attend the reception.

1617
01:34:36,924 --> 01:34:38,901
They aren't treating me
as your wife, Karthik.

1618
01:34:39,308 --> 01:34:41,566
The staring of the guests at me
would be very irritating to me.

1619
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:42,672
What's wrong in it?

1620
01:34:42,783 --> 01:34:44,703
They are staring at you
because you're beautiful.

1621
01:34:44,834 --> 01:34:46,364
Anyhow, you aren't my wife.

1622
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:47,780
Huh!

1623
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:52,064
Hey... Sorry.

1624
01:34:52,892 --> 01:34:53,892
Did you get hurt?

1625
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:56,150
I can't take it, Karthik.
I won't attend the reception.

1626
01:34:56,226 --> 01:34:57,226
Leave me alone.

1627
01:34:57,278 --> 01:34:58,925
So be it.
I too won't attend it.

1628
01:35:00,438 --> 01:35:01,053
Is it okay?

1629
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:02,968
I'm hungry.
Shall we have dinner?

1630
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:06,011
I didn't get any food as I thought
that you're going to the function.

1631
01:35:06,772 --> 01:35:07,782
Then, it is more good.

1632
01:35:08,513 --> 01:35:09,922
We shall go to your favourite place,

1633
01:35:09,946 --> 01:35:13,191
have dinner and roam around.

1634
01:35:13,215 --> 01:35:14,575
- Is it okay?
- I still won't come.

1635
01:35:15,187 --> 01:35:16,596
- Won't you come?
- I won't come.

1636
01:35:16,668 --> 01:35:18,948
Won't you come? Huh!

1637
01:35:19,472 --> 01:35:22,198
Won't you come?

1638
01:35:22,834 --> 01:35:24,850
You know very well how to convince me.

1639
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:26,702
Well, I'll get dressed.

1640
01:35:27,336 --> 01:35:28,336
Come quickly.

1641
01:35:33,776 --> 01:35:35,207
Hmm... How's the dress?

1642
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:37,998
- Wah!
- Shall we get started?

1643
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:39,238
Superb!

1644
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:41,638
This dress is good on no one but you.

1645
01:35:42,576 --> 01:35:44,136
- It's very beautiful.
- Well, let's go.

1646
01:36:07,388 --> 01:36:08,388
Order, sir?

1647
01:36:11,459 --> 01:36:12,459
Okay...

1648
01:36:13,123 --> 01:36:14,145
Shall I give the order or
would you like to do that?

1649
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:15,256
- You give it.
- Okay.

1650
01:36:16,035 --> 01:36:18,473
- Two veg soup and...
- Give it to me, I'll give the order.

1651
01:36:19,256 --> 01:36:20,504
You always order the same food.

1652
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:24,318
Two chicken manchuria...
Are you good with mutton biryani?

1653
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:25,182
- Yes.
- Okay.

1654
01:36:25,398 --> 01:36:26,518
One mutton biryani.

1655
01:36:26,826 --> 01:36:27,826
Make it fast.

1656
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:29,216
Two veg corn soup.

1657
01:36:29,377 --> 01:36:30,377
Why order two?

1658
01:36:30,568 --> 01:36:31,852
One...
One soup is enough.

1659
01:36:32,118 --> 01:36:33,569
Get it with two spoons.

1660
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:35,250
Okay, sir.

1661
01:36:42,754 --> 01:36:43,754
Madam

1662
01:36:55,767 --> 01:36:56,839
- Ew!
- What happened?

1663
01:36:57,015 --> 01:36:57,866
It is disgusting.

1664
01:36:58,013 --> 01:36:59,013
Is it?

1665
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:03,670
This is alright, isn't it?

1666
01:37:03,976 --> 01:37:04,976
Is it?

1667
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:07,618
Give it to me.

1668
01:37:10,513 --> 01:37:13,261
Yummy! It is delicious with
your added lipstick flavour.

1669
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,637
Hey... Shucks!

1670
01:37:14,731 --> 01:37:16,989
- Oh no! I'm sorry.
- Oh crap!

1671
01:37:17,397 --> 01:37:18,693
Here, use this tissue paper.

1672
01:37:18,794 --> 01:37:20,557
It's okay.
I'll go, get it cleaned.

1673
01:37:20,898 --> 01:37:22,274
- You...
- Huh!

1674
01:37:22,663 --> 01:37:24,006
Keep waiting.

1675
01:37:37,425 --> 01:37:38,425
Hi Karthik.

1676
01:37:38,806 --> 01:37:40,159
Hey... Hi Jessi.

1677
01:37:40,624 --> 01:37:42,824
- Whoa!
- Did you come here with your girlfriend?

1678
01:37:42,918 --> 01:37:43,374
Yeah.

1679
01:37:43,466 --> 01:37:46,434
That's how it happens. You'll forget
your followers when you get freshers.

1680
01:37:46,523 --> 01:37:47,523
Nothing like that.

1681
01:37:47,808 --> 01:37:50,425
Don't blabber. Do you know how
many times I've called you?

1682
01:37:53,442 --> 01:37:55,917
Sorry baby, it's work busy. That's it.

1683
01:37:56,005 --> 01:37:56,923
So you are telling
that you didn't forget me?

1684
01:37:56,999 --> 01:37:57,419
No...

1685
01:37:57,477 --> 01:37:59,089
Then, when are we going to meet again?

1686
01:38:00,021 --> 01:38:00,520
Come on, tell me.

1687
01:38:00,994 --> 01:38:01,613
Let's meet in the weekend.

1688
01:38:01,699 --> 01:38:02,453
Give me a kiss

1689
01:38:02,661 --> 01:38:04,475
- because I'll be waiting until weekend.
- Oh no!

1690
01:38:04,499 --> 01:38:05,499
Where is here?

1691
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:08,599
Did he go to the washroom or
is he waiting after washing it?

1692
01:38:32,464 --> 01:38:33,464
Karthik...

1693
01:38:33,733 --> 01:38:34,733
Yes...

1694
01:38:34,823 --> 01:38:36,092
Oh Keerthi...

1695
01:38:37,949 --> 01:38:38,949
Crap!

1696
01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:40,319
Keerthi...

1697
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:42,060
Keerthi...

1698
01:38:44,095 --> 01:38:46,041
Hey Keerthi, I'm sorry.

1699
01:38:47,185 --> 01:38:48,573
Keerthi... Keerthi.

1700
01:38:48,961 --> 01:38:50,029
- Huh!
- Sorry, Keerthi.

1701
01:38:51,543 --> 01:38:53,203
Nothing happened over
there like you assumed.

1702
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:55,644
I got a bit tempted as
the situation demanded.

1703
01:38:55,859 --> 01:38:57,919
What if I get tempted for any guy?

1704
01:39:01,115 --> 01:39:02,675
I've got more enraged when you did that

1705
01:39:02,737 --> 01:39:03,439
You should have slapped me.

1706
01:39:03,656 --> 01:39:06,096
What's the difference between a
human and an animal if I slap?

1707
01:39:06,136 --> 01:39:07,136
What do you mean?

1708
01:39:07,616 --> 01:39:08,846
Whenever someone gets anger and mood,

1709
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:11,190
the one who maintains mental
balance is said to be a human.

1710
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:12,919
The one who reacts wildly is an animal.

1711
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:14,631
Do you mean I'm an animal?

1712
01:39:29,572 --> 01:39:31,304
Is clothing necessary for animals?

1713
01:39:34,493 --> 01:39:35,493
Damn!

1714
01:39:36,924 --> 01:39:39,187
Would she call me an animal?
Let me teach her a lesson.

1715
01:39:39,977 --> 01:39:42,221
I will show her how an animal behaves.

1716
01:39:46,587 --> 01:39:47,627
Let me teach her a lesson.

1717
01:39:54,107 --> 01:39:55,587
Let me show her how
an animal behaves.

1718
01:39:58,820 --> 01:39:59,820
Freaking girl!

1719
01:39:59,845 --> 01:40:01,605
Ow! Oh!

1720
01:40:10,965 --> 01:40:12,339
You're very cute.

1721
01:40:12,627 --> 01:40:13,040
Muah!

1722
01:40:13,491 --> 01:40:16,850
- You're very cute. Cute...
- Why the hell did you enter my room?

1723
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,063
Shut up and get out.

1724
01:40:18,241 --> 01:40:19,336
What's with you?

1725
01:40:19,512 --> 01:40:22,105
Earlier, you called me an animal
and now you're asking me to get out.

1726
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:23,129
Huh!

1727
01:40:23,718 --> 01:40:24,958
How dare you call me an animal?

1728
01:40:24,984 --> 01:40:26,038
It's your endgame today.

1729
01:40:26,114 --> 01:40:27,114
Hey...

1730
01:40:27,516 --> 01:40:28,516
Hey, leave me.

1731
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,492
Hey, what are you doing?
Karthik...

1732
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,428
- Leave me, Karthik...
- Let me show you what an animal is.

1733
01:40:34,806 --> 01:40:35,806
Karthik, leave me.

1734
01:40:37,192 --> 01:40:38,192
Hey, leave me.

1735
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:41,001
Leave me.

1736
01:40:42,381 --> 01:40:43,381
Hey, leave me. Please.

1737
01:40:44,174 --> 01:40:45,254
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1738
01:40:46,872 --> 01:40:47,872
Karthik...

1739
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:09,010
Oh man...

1740
01:41:13,845 --> 01:41:14,845
Huh!

1741
01:41:20,191 --> 01:41:26,134
"Bangaru Kodipetta song
from the movie Magadheera"

1742
01:41:30,146 --> 01:41:31,842
Where the hell are you going?

1743
01:41:32,362 --> 01:41:35,579
Then? I'm not your servant to be with you.

1744
01:41:35,829 --> 01:41:39,385
And I'm not even a sex worker to
come to your bed whenever you want.

1745
01:41:39,675 --> 01:41:40,291
Let me show you what I'm.

1746
01:41:40,528 --> 01:41:41,207
Would you show me?

1747
01:41:41,447 --> 01:41:43,127
- Then, let's go another round.
- Damn you!

1748
01:41:44,679 --> 01:41:47,834
Go now. Wherever you go, you'll have
to come here at the end of the day.

1749
01:41:48,337 --> 01:41:48,857
Go...

1750
01:41:49,232 --> 01:41:52,027
Hey, my golden hen!

1751
01:41:52,403 --> 01:41:53,003
Go...

1752
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:54,300
Muah!

1753
01:41:58,615 --> 01:42:01,274
Awe! Whom do you want?

1754
01:42:05,813 --> 01:42:06,858
I understood. Let's go.

1755
01:42:10,132 --> 01:42:13,268
You are well educated
and a software engineer,

1756
01:42:13,568 --> 01:42:16,247
Why did you go hard on her?

1757
01:42:16,523 --> 01:42:19,485
- What did I do, sir?
- Don't ask very innocently?

1758
01:42:19,881 --> 01:42:24,253
You'd be finished if anyone of the
cases that she filed gets proved.

1759
01:42:24,342 --> 01:42:28,347
Do you know you can be
sentenced for 14 years imprisonment?

1760
01:42:29,153 --> 01:42:32,653
Sir, plan to get me in the
jail for at least 40 years.

1761
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:33,285
Huh?

1762
01:42:33,571 --> 01:42:38,338
Do you think it as some kind of
hill station for you to take rest?

1763
01:42:38,638 --> 01:42:41,893
Jail! It is a jail.
You have to eat jail food.

1764
01:42:42,085 --> 01:42:43,085
I know sir.

1765
01:42:43,431 --> 01:42:45,541
For any problems,
the guys would be blamed.

1766
01:42:45,709 --> 01:42:46,709
They never blame girls.

1767
01:42:46,892 --> 01:42:48,914
Because everything
would be in their favour.

1768
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:51,722
They can just simply file a
rape case or a harassment case.

1769
01:42:51,951 --> 01:42:54,927
All the sections of law
would be written in their favour.

1770
01:42:55,247 --> 01:42:57,633
Suppose, if a guy comes
to the police station

1771
01:42:57,808 --> 01:43:00,593
and files a case that
a girl had raped him,

1772
01:43:00,832 --> 01:43:02,398
How will you react, sir?

1773
01:43:02,536 --> 01:43:03,021
Ah!

1774
01:43:03,036 --> 01:43:05,116
This is how you'd react.
There wouldn't be any sound.

1775
01:43:05,435 --> 01:43:06,512
You'd stay blind.

1776
01:43:07,437 --> 01:43:08,987
Do you think that it
wouldn't have happened?

1777
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:12,867
Do you think that there won't be any
girl in this world who raped a guy?

1778
01:43:13,418 --> 01:43:14,418
She might have raped.

1779
01:43:14,527 --> 01:43:17,127
But our male community is great
when it comes to this matter, sir.

1780
01:43:17,387 --> 01:43:19,307
They don't come out
thinking it to be an insult.

1781
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:21,150
They would grieve in their heart.

1782
01:43:21,314 --> 01:43:22,930
Let me tell you a proverb. Listen.

1783
01:43:22,966 --> 01:43:25,278
You know it but I'll anyway tell you.

1784
01:43:26,036 --> 01:43:29,432
Whether the leaf falls on the thorn,
or the thorn falls on the leaf

1785
01:43:29,864 --> 01:43:31,272
it is the leaf that suffers, sir.

1786
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:33,573
But people think a woman to be the leaf.

1787
01:43:33,765 --> 01:43:34,236
It's wrong.

1788
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,744
But in my view, it is the men who are
like leaves having the tender hearts.

1789
01:43:39,501 --> 01:43:41,260
There is a technique to kill houseflies.

1790
01:43:41,584 --> 01:43:44,688
If you put out a piece of jaggery,
the houseflies would gather on it.

1791
01:43:44,787 --> 01:43:47,156
Then, they can be killed
in whatever way we want.

1792
01:43:47,476 --> 01:43:49,484
Now, the guys are facing
the similar situation.

1793
01:43:49,851 --> 01:43:51,868
The girls are killing us
by exposing themselves.

1794
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,090
The situations out
there are very bad, sir.

1795
01:43:55,114 --> 01:43:57,910
That's why I want to spend
rest of my peacefully in jail.

1796
01:43:57,986 --> 01:43:59,545
Plese help me, sir. Please.

1797
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:02,076
You've narrated the
situation in a very good way but

1798
01:44:02,235 --> 01:44:03,911
why didn't narrate your chapter?

1799
01:44:04,121 --> 01:44:07,555
A girl wore a black
nightie exposing her thighs,

1800
01:44:07,926 --> 01:44:10,980
was lying on the bed in a sexy manner.

1801
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,888
Wouldn't any guy tempt?

1802
01:44:13,921 --> 01:44:15,842
Tell me, sir.
Wouldn't he get tempted?

1803
01:44:15,991 --> 01:44:17,370
Yes...
He would definitely get tempted.

1804
01:44:17,394 --> 01:44:17,809
Right?

1805
01:44:18,048 --> 01:44:23,038
She was almost involved with me
for 50 times when I was sleeping alone.

1806
01:44:24,121 --> 01:44:26,577
I don't know the actual count
but the number could be more.

1807
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:28,350
You mean 50 times.

1808
01:44:28,484 --> 01:44:29,841
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1809
01:44:31,273 --> 01:44:33,153
That's alright.
Well, where do both of you stay?

1810
01:44:33,311 --> 01:44:34,031
In the same flat, sir.

1811
01:44:34,193 --> 01:44:35,435
- Is she your wife?
- No, sir.

1812
01:44:35,511 --> 01:44:37,211
- Then, a lover?
- No... Not at all, sir.

1813
01:44:37,307 --> 01:44:38,307
Then, who is she?

1814
01:44:38,344 --> 01:44:39,603
- She just kept me, sir.
- What?

1815
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:47,341
Sir, now tell me.
Who is correct and who is wrong?

1816
01:44:47,397 --> 01:44:48,397
What should I say?

1817
01:44:48,863 --> 01:44:51,956
But this is not the place
to judge your situation.

1818
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:55,820
Your honour,

1819
01:44:56,335 --> 01:44:57,472
When he, Mr Karthik used to go
behind my client, Ms Keerthi daily

1820
01:44:57,482 --> 01:45:01,904
and proposed to have a
live-in relation with her,

1821
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:04,139
She trusted him to be a good
guy and accepted his proposal.

1822
01:45:04,163 --> 01:45:05,331
Objection, your honour.

1823
01:45:06,371 --> 01:45:09,962
She who is being called 'Ms' Keerthi
even after being in live-in relation,

1824
01:45:10,153 --> 01:45:14,370
has accepted his proposal only after
knowing my client's history, your honour.

1825
01:45:14,572 --> 01:45:15,949
Like the defence lawyer said,

1826
01:45:16,058 --> 01:45:19,410
he didn't try to convince her or force
her to accept his proposal, your honour.

1827
01:45:19,412 --> 01:45:21,679
Ms Keerthi, didn't he
ask you to marry him?

1828
01:45:21,863 --> 01:45:24,975
"I have a mobile in my
hand and car in my garage."

1829
01:45:25,231 --> 01:45:27,398
"There would be a wife in
my bedroom if I marry you."

1830
01:45:28,009 --> 01:45:29,449
"Except their usage"

1831
01:45:29,687 --> 01:45:32,126
"there won't be attention and
attachment" is what he said, sir.

1832
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:33,150
Yes, your honour.

1833
01:45:34,203 --> 01:45:38,236
He kept my client in delusion with
these words and got his needs met.

1834
01:45:38,354 --> 01:45:39,876
All these days he behaved very rashly,

1835
01:45:40,143 --> 01:45:43,247
and subjected her to
physical and mental torture.

1836
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,408
I request you to sentence this
accused with stringent punishment

1837
01:45:45,432 --> 01:45:47,306
and deliver justice to my client.

1838
01:45:47,403 --> 01:45:48,403
That's all, your honour.

1839
01:45:48,946 --> 01:45:49,441
Sir...

1840
01:45:49,965 --> 01:45:50,382
Um...

1841
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:53,123
Mr Murthy, let him speak.

1842
01:45:54,971 --> 01:45:57,515
Sir, the lawyer is
presenting me as a villain.

1843
01:45:58,166 --> 01:46:00,791
Did I ever came home
drunk and scold you vulgarly?

1844
01:46:00,877 --> 01:46:02,904
You didn't scold me.
But you have come home drunk, didn't you?

1845
01:46:02,928 --> 01:46:04,768
- Did I sever burn you with cigarettes?
- No...

1846
01:46:04,832 --> 01:46:05,832
Then, what did I do?

1847
01:46:05,881 --> 01:46:07,499
Is it wrong to kiss you when I get mood?

1848
01:46:10,241 --> 01:46:11,241
Order... Order.

1849
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:14,214
Yes, kissing another
woman is definitely wrong.

1850
01:46:14,462 --> 01:46:15,711
She's my ex-girlfriend.

1851
01:46:15,835 --> 01:46:16,835
She met me accidentally.

1852
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:19,276
Nothing happened between us on that day.

1853
01:46:19,484 --> 01:46:21,222
I'm done with you and your philosophy.

1854
01:46:21,343 --> 01:46:23,511
Enough now.
Leave me. Please.

1855
01:46:24,283 --> 01:46:25,483
You saw it, right your honour?

1856
01:46:25,986 --> 01:46:28,434
By showing an expected incident as reason

1857
01:46:28,974 --> 01:46:30,969
and projecting my client as guilty,

1858
01:46:31,759 --> 01:46:34,367
it is just an attempt to get
separated and gain alimony but

1859
01:46:34,558 --> 01:46:37,787
She doesn't have any intention to have
a live-in relation with my client.

1860
01:46:37,827 --> 01:46:39,305
As the defence lawyer accused,

1861
01:46:39,473 --> 01:46:43,025
my client didn't have any intentions or
mentality to get his sexual desires met

1862
01:46:43,233 --> 01:46:46,513
in the name of live-in relation
and simply get rid of her.

1863
01:46:47,113 --> 01:46:49,982
He still wants her to
live with him together.

1864
01:46:50,122 --> 01:46:52,799
Yes, sir. I assumed that she is
whining just like she did it every day.

1865
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:54,823
But I never expected her to go brazen.

1866
01:46:55,642 --> 01:46:58,113
Hey, it's my mistake to live together
with a guy like you all these days

1867
01:46:58,137 --> 01:47:00,766
who doesn't stick to his words.

1868
01:47:01,268 --> 01:47:04,022
Finally, you have even
humiliated me. Damn you!

1869
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:06,279
It is not your mistake.

1870
01:47:06,764 --> 01:47:08,325
By joining you in a baby
care center upon your birth,

1871
01:47:08,349 --> 01:47:09,845
By joining you in a play
school upon learning crawling,

1872
01:47:09,869 --> 01:47:12,965
By joining you in a boarding
school as soon as you learn to speak

1873
01:47:13,072 --> 01:47:16,272
It's the parents who made a mistake by
showing only their needs but not the bond.

1874
01:47:16,799 --> 01:47:20,814
On one side, your parents are being
pride about what you are earning,

1875
01:47:21,454 --> 01:47:23,425
You wouldn't take any
decisions by consulting them.

1876
01:47:23,449 --> 01:47:24,697
Because they know nothing.

1877
01:47:24,929 --> 01:47:26,049
It is due to generation gap.

1878
01:47:26,118 --> 01:47:27,118
Isn't it?

1879
01:47:28,313 --> 01:47:31,213
You don't have any affection on
humans as much as you give to things.

1880
01:47:31,637 --> 01:47:35,526
That's why you repair the things
and use them when they give trouble.

1881
01:47:36,303 --> 01:47:38,303
But in case of humans,
you want to get rid of them.

1882
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:39,540
Where are we going?

1883
01:47:40,499 --> 01:47:41,098
In this country

1884
01:47:41,395 --> 01:47:43,363
where we celebrate the marriage ceremony
of Lord Rama and Goddess Sita every year,

1885
01:47:43,387 --> 01:47:47,260
Is it what you learned from your education
to live together without getting married,

1886
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:49,773
Or is it your ignorance of
not knowing the family values?

1887
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:50,797
What should we assume?

1888
01:47:51,701 --> 01:47:53,781
Only those who know the
value of relation would love.

1889
01:47:54,072 --> 01:47:56,752
And only those who can share the
responsibilities would get married.

1890
01:47:56,869 --> 01:47:59,882
People of your generation aren't aware
of love and have no faith in a marriage.

1891
01:47:59,906 --> 01:48:00,986
How will you stay together?

1892
01:48:01,689 --> 01:48:04,569
In order to live together,
there shouldn't be suspicion but respect.

1893
01:48:04,759 --> 01:48:05,971
Even that is not there between you.

1894
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:09,200
We can give a divorce for a marriage and
a separation for a live-in relationship.

1895
01:48:09,523 --> 01:48:10,197
Instead,

1896
01:48:10,385 --> 01:48:11,278
What can be told to people like you

1897
01:48:11,338 --> 01:48:13,818
who wants to live together and
get separated whenever you wish?

1898
01:48:14,092 --> 01:48:15,532
In what way do I make you understand

1899
01:48:16,402 --> 01:48:18,764
that what you are leading is
not a family life but adultery.

1900
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:22,932
A wife is a person who knows the
way but doesn't know driving.

1901
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:26,570
A husband is a person who
knows driving but not the way.

1902
01:48:26,948 --> 01:48:30,712
That's why both of them
should start a new journey.

1903
01:48:31,352 --> 01:48:34,296
Only in that way,
the journey would go in a smooth manner.

1904
01:48:34,979 --> 01:48:37,144
And the relation would be in a happy way.

1905
01:48:37,763 --> 01:48:38,763
Not just you,

1906
01:48:38,856 --> 01:48:40,680
Even a lot of youth don't know this

1907
01:48:40,952 --> 01:48:43,400
and seek courts by
quarrelling for small matters.

1908
01:48:43,678 --> 01:48:45,644
Don't search on Google for the solution.

1909
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:48,174
Sit with your elders and discuss.

1910
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:51,368
The valuable court time would be
saved as well as your family honour.

1911
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:55,500
I recommend this case to be
solved in the family council

1912
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:57,760
And, as it is a crime to
subjugate a person's freedom,

1913
01:48:58,070 --> 01:49:01,997
I order Karthik not to

1914
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:06,142
interfere in Keerthi's
affairs without her consent.

1915
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:08,157
This court is adjourned.

1916
01:49:18,662 --> 01:49:22,463
- No guys would marry this kind of girls.
- No guys would marry this kind of girls.

1917
01:49:22,837 --> 01:49:25,917
This is how kids would become if they
aren't raised without proper monitoring.

1918
01:49:31,238 --> 01:49:34,120
You said that you'd
stay together for lifelong,

1919
01:49:34,192 --> 01:49:35,812
but did you get
bored within a year?

1920
01:49:36,005 --> 01:49:37,093
Mind your own business.

1921
01:49:37,194 --> 01:49:39,941
Hmm... People get enraged
when they hear the facts.

1922
01:49:40,845 --> 01:49:42,941
Why did you leave her within a short time?

1923
01:49:43,313 --> 01:49:44,972
You could have used
her for some years.

1924
01:49:46,056 --> 01:49:47,736
Her body is still in
good condition, right?

1925
01:49:48,424 --> 01:49:49,716
Shut up and get to your work.

1926
01:49:51,259 --> 01:49:52,347
What's wrong in his words?

1927
01:49:52,547 --> 01:49:53,787
You seem to be getting enraged.

1928
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,819
Ah! Don't you stare like that.

1929
01:49:56,075 --> 01:49:57,435
Seems like you don't have clarity.

1930
01:49:57,499 --> 01:49:59,787
Why did you let her stay in
your flat? To enjoy, isn't it?

1931
01:49:59,892 --> 01:50:01,852
There would be some
anger-rage in some situations.

1932
01:50:01,878 --> 01:50:03,229
You have to get adjusted to it.

1933
01:50:03,741 --> 01:50:06,043
Because, look at that girl over there.

1934
01:50:06,335 --> 01:50:08,893
I have to spend my card
whenever I try to flirt with her.

1935
01:50:08,985 --> 01:50:09,790
Didn't you understand?

1936
01:50:09,898 --> 01:50:11,449
By not taking any responsibility,

1937
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,041
She has been cooking her own food,

1938
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:14,506
buying her own clothes

1939
01:50:14,633 --> 01:50:16,193
and spending with you freely, isn't it?

1940
01:50:17,364 --> 01:50:19,590
There aren't any girls outside
who are coming for free.

1941
01:50:21,704 --> 01:50:22,704
Huh!

1942
01:50:33,253 --> 01:50:36,358
A woman is respected only if her
name is prefixed with Ms or Mrs.

1943
01:50:36,995 --> 01:50:39,587
You lost your respect the
moment you stepped into the court.

1944
01:50:40,665 --> 01:50:43,095
And if you lose your respect
with your meaningless obstinacy,

1945
01:50:43,743 --> 01:50:45,903
You'll have to live your rest
of your life facing risk.

1946
01:50:46,082 --> 01:50:46,699
Listen to me.

1947
01:50:46,883 --> 01:50:49,043
I'll even touch Karthik's
feet and try to convince him.

1948
01:50:49,132 --> 01:50:50,132
Marry him.

1949
01:50:50,785 --> 01:50:54,962
Does living risk-free means living in
fear like a slave to husband, Pavitra?

1950
01:50:55,677 --> 01:50:58,919
A man would become a husband if
we marry him but not a good husband.

1951
01:50:59,534 --> 01:51:01,454
A good husband should love his wife.

1952
01:51:01,787 --> 01:51:03,427
He should be affectionate and tolerating.

1953
01:51:03,955 --> 01:51:05,475
He should console me when I'm sad.

1954
01:51:05,775 --> 01:51:07,833
He should give assurance
that he's there for me.

1955
01:51:08,358 --> 01:51:09,878
Karthik doesn't know any of these.

1956
01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:12,875
Only a loving man can
become a good husband.

1957
01:51:14,462 --> 01:51:16,494
Karthik is just a guy. That's it.

1958
01:51:17,453 --> 01:51:19,215
Everyone asks me to attend court

1959
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:20,841
and counselling without
understanding any of these.

1960
01:51:20,865 --> 01:51:23,954
Everyone including you,
are giving me advices.

1961
01:51:24,183 --> 01:51:25,895
I'm not as clever as you, Keerthi.

1962
01:51:26,554 --> 01:51:29,234
I couldn't say that I wanted to
pursue PG instead of getting married

1963
01:51:29,348 --> 01:51:31,188
because it was my father
whom I have to oppose.

1964
01:51:31,329 --> 01:51:33,729
I was unable to speak against
Madhav when he was insulting me

1965
01:51:33,824 --> 01:51:35,038
because he's my husband
whom I have to oppose.

1966
01:51:35,062 --> 01:51:36,949
And now, you're telling me that
I have no right to suggest you,

1967
01:51:36,973 --> 01:51:37,973
what should I do Keerthi?

1968
01:51:38,312 --> 01:51:39,364
I'm your friend.

1969
01:51:40,076 --> 01:51:43,523
I have a small hope that you
would get justice if you get married.

1970
01:51:53,043 --> 01:51:55,091
Karthik doesn't have respect on marriage.

1971
01:51:56,275 --> 01:51:58,738
When he asked me why the
marriage is required to live together,

1972
01:51:58,762 --> 01:52:00,953
I agreed with him and been
into live-in relation with him.

1973
01:52:00,977 --> 01:52:04,753
But I'm unable to agree with you
when you're asking me to marry him.

1974
01:52:05,308 --> 01:52:07,919
It is not because I don't
have respect for marriage.

1975
01:52:08,422 --> 01:52:09,989
I don't have trust in Karthik.

1976
01:52:17,444 --> 01:52:18,444
Huh...

1977
01:52:18,678 --> 01:52:21,110
You are a good girl.
I'm not objecting it.

1978
01:52:22,109 --> 01:52:23,789
But you're obstinate.

1979
01:52:24,005 --> 01:52:27,777
Along with that, you have
madness, insanity and what not.

1980
01:52:28,765 --> 01:52:31,090
If we keep telling like this, there
would be a lot of negatives of yours.

1981
01:52:31,114 --> 01:52:32,114
Ahem

1982
01:52:33,718 --> 01:52:35,038
Oh! Hi

1983
01:52:35,254 --> 01:52:37,134
Didn't I tell you that
you'll have to come here?

1984
01:52:52,209 --> 01:52:54,689
What's up, you seem excited?

1985
01:52:54,724 --> 01:52:57,067
I have a surprise for you.
Guess what it is.

1986
01:52:58,247 --> 01:52:59,247
What would it be?

1987
01:52:59,961 --> 01:53:02,330
You would have bought a dress
as tomorrow is my birthday.

1988
01:53:02,774 --> 01:53:04,998
How did you guess so correctly?

1989
01:53:05,104 --> 01:53:06,104
Just wait.

1990
01:53:07,802 --> 01:53:08,802
Here is your dress.

1991
01:53:09,067 --> 01:53:10,255
It's your birthday, isn't it?

1992
01:53:10,763 --> 01:53:11,920
Why are you presenting a dress?

1993
01:53:11,944 --> 01:53:13,664
We would anyway give
and take things, right?

1994
01:53:13,798 --> 01:53:16,232
I expected you'd bring
me, so I too brought it.

1995
01:53:20,336 --> 01:53:21,831
Here, this is your dress.

1996
01:53:22,095 --> 01:53:23,095
How is it?

1997
01:53:23,347 --> 01:53:24,757
It's good. Thanks.

1998
01:54:04,768 --> 01:54:05,768
Huh!

1999
01:54:09,314 --> 01:54:10,372
Are you mad?

2000
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:26,137
Madhav, I want to resign my job.

2001
01:54:26,161 --> 01:54:27,201
Why is it all of a sudden?

2002
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,198
Don't ask me for the reasons, Madhav.

2003
01:54:29,587 --> 01:54:30,960
Please. Sorry.

2004
01:54:31,451 --> 01:54:34,129
Madhav, I wouldn't have got
this job without your reference.

2005
01:54:35,237 --> 01:54:37,917
You gave me this job despite having
heavy competition for this post.

2006
01:54:38,807 --> 01:54:40,807
But it is me who couldn't hold to it.

2007
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:43,666
I'm sorry and I'm
thankful to your help.

2008
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:45,976
I have sent my
resignation letter to your email.

2009
01:54:48,382 --> 01:54:49,382
Bye, Madhav.

2010
01:55:02,733 --> 01:55:03,733
Keerthi

2011
01:55:04,581 --> 01:55:06,598
Where are you going by resigning your job?

2012
01:55:06,769 --> 01:55:07,475
Somewhere far.

2013
01:55:07,584 --> 01:55:10,463
Are you going far away from
Karthik or the dirty comments?

2014
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,302
It is better to stay away
from the bad, isn't it?

2015
01:55:12,326 --> 01:55:14,646
Please Keerthi.
He has changed a lot now.

2016
01:55:15,057 --> 01:55:16,809
He's been thinking about every moment.

2017
01:55:17,353 --> 01:55:20,489
I'm scared about what would happen to
him if you leave him in this situation.

2018
01:55:20,634 --> 01:55:22,594
You're scared about what
would happen to him? Huh!

2019
01:55:23,219 --> 01:55:28,001
A lot of girls who would come at night and
leaves by morning are in touch with him.

2020
01:55:28,429 --> 01:55:31,029
I missed a lot of flavours due to
falling into her spell.

2021
01:55:35,766 --> 01:55:37,409
Hey, what a surprise?

2022
01:55:37,726 --> 01:55:39,167
Didn't you remember me all these days?

2023
01:55:39,191 --> 01:55:42,069
I called you many times but
you didn't pick up my call.

2024
01:55:42,301 --> 01:55:44,465
Didn't I pick?
Would I ignore your call?

2025
01:55:44,641 --> 01:55:46,086
- Hey, show me...
- Hey... Hey...

2026
01:55:46,172 --> 01:55:48,041
- Give me...
- Hey... No...

2027
01:55:49,092 --> 01:55:50,652
Didn't I tell you not
to open the phone?

2028
01:55:54,965 --> 01:55:55,965
Hey...

2029
01:55:57,738 --> 01:56:00,418
- Why do you need my phone?
- Who is Keerthi? Is she that beautiful?

2030
01:56:01,146 --> 01:56:03,914
That one?
Forget beauty, she is hot-headed.

2031
01:56:04,102 --> 01:56:05,350
Why do you bring her topic now?

2032
01:56:21,241 --> 01:56:22,241
Keerthi...

2033
01:56:22,287 --> 01:56:23,287
Huh!

2034
01:56:24,056 --> 01:56:28,189
- Keerthi? Huh!
- Oh no! I'm unable to forget her.

2035
01:58:00,316 --> 01:58:01,316
Hey...

2036
01:58:02,256 --> 01:58:04,144
Why are you grieving
like some devoted lover?

2037
01:58:04,359 --> 01:58:07,159
However, you're aren't the kind who
would care about love and marriage.

2038
01:58:07,651 --> 01:58:10,247
Don't keep that face.
Those feelings don't suit you.

2039
01:58:10,644 --> 01:58:11,644
One moment please.

2040
01:58:12,312 --> 01:58:13,352
Are they available or not?

2041
01:58:14,401 --> 01:58:15,646
At least there would be beer.

2042
01:58:21,606 --> 01:58:22,606
Have it I say.

2043
01:58:23,643 --> 01:58:24,643
Let's start.

2044
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:28,041
She is the one who made
a mess of the small issue

2045
01:58:28,065 --> 01:58:31,961
by dragging it to the court
and the police station, right?

2046
01:58:32,150 --> 01:58:33,286
Then, leave it.

2047
01:58:34,928 --> 01:58:36,178
I can't live, if I leave it.

2048
01:58:36,832 --> 01:58:37,832
I feel like crying.

2049
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,990
I feel like my life is going away.

2050
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,025
Everything is my fault.

2051
01:58:42,626 --> 01:58:44,946
The assurances made by me
before I brought her to the flat,

2052
01:58:45,285 --> 01:58:46,790
I didn't stick to them.

2053
01:58:47,222 --> 01:58:48,602
My selfishness grew.

2054
01:58:49,026 --> 01:58:51,249
I felt that I own Keerthi.

2055
01:58:52,785 --> 01:58:54,708
I told her as if I'm an intellect that

2056
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,558
I don't like owning a person
and treating them as a thing.

2057
01:58:59,534 --> 01:59:00,939
I was the one to tell her that there is no
difference in having a mobile in hand

2058
01:59:00,963 --> 01:59:03,705
and having a wife in my home!

2059
01:59:17,632 --> 01:59:19,220
Keerthi... Keerthi.

2060
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,262
- Keerthi...
- She isn't here to come to you...

2061
01:59:21,285 --> 01:59:22,483
immediately upon your calling.

2062
01:59:22,507 --> 01:59:23,638
She left this place long ago.

2063
01:59:23,662 --> 01:59:24,107
Where did she go?

2064
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:25,313
You've been with her all these days,

2065
01:59:25,337 --> 01:59:26,962
don't you know where she goes
when she gets into trouble

2066
01:59:26,986 --> 01:59:29,005
and gets consoled when she feels sad?

2067
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:33,234
Except her body, you know nothing
about her heart and her people.

2068
01:59:33,710 --> 01:59:34,451
Forget her, Karthik.

2069
01:59:34,607 --> 01:59:36,927
She can't take criticism
and you won't stick to your words.

2070
01:59:36,965 --> 01:59:39,692
I can't tolerate if I'm
insulted or scolded.

2071
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:43,009
I swear on this land and sky,
I won't get you in that situation.

2072
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,894
I will place you in my heart
and look after you, Keerthi.

2073
01:59:45,934 --> 01:59:49,054
I won't be coming here searching for her
if I'm really the guy who forgets her.

2074
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:53,736
However, it was my flat that
she vacated but not my heart.

2075
01:59:54,648 --> 01:59:55,648
Move...

2076
01:59:55,855 --> 01:59:57,674
Keerthi... Keerthi.

2077
01:59:57,697 --> 02:00:00,118
Keerthi... Keerthi.

2078
02:00:37,083 --> 02:00:39,681
Her bus is about to leave shortly.
Go now, Karthik.

2079
02:00:45,047 --> 02:00:46,047
Thank you.

2080
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:08,864
"I realised that it was my crime"

2081
02:01:09,329 --> 02:01:12,997
"I realised that it was a terrible thing"

2082
02:01:13,702 --> 02:01:17,245
"At least your heart knew that it is..."

2083
02:01:17,469 --> 02:01:20,045
"an injury"

2084
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:26,176
"The distance between us grew"

2085
02:01:26,715 --> 02:01:30,438
"I'm left with nothing"

2086
02:01:31,346 --> 02:01:34,814
"My heart is filled with unknown..."

2087
02:01:34,921 --> 02:01:38,108
"burden"

2088
02:01:39,778 --> 02:01:43,603
"The light is down and
surrounded by darkness"

2089
02:01:44,155 --> 02:01:47,771
"My boon is shattered and
the poison is scattered"

2090
02:01:48,507 --> 02:01:52,005
"The romance has become..."

2091
02:01:52,388 --> 02:01:55,689
"bitter"

2092
02:02:14,742 --> 02:02:18,215
"After the cloud scattered"

2093
02:02:19,047 --> 02:02:22,403
"I asked for the rain"

2094
02:02:23,395 --> 02:02:26,539
"it doesn't even rain a drop"

2095
02:02:27,031 --> 02:02:31,966
"What to do?
What to do?"

2096
02:02:32,206 --> 02:02:36,397
"After the love melted"

2097
02:02:36,573 --> 02:02:40,714
"What's the use in searching for it?"

2098
02:02:40,921 --> 02:02:44,621
"It became faded"

2099
02:02:44,697 --> 02:02:48,815
"What to do now?"

2100
02:03:07,103 --> 02:03:11,038
"I caused"

2101
02:03:11,486 --> 02:03:15,151
"the grief in your heart"

2102
02:03:15,899 --> 02:03:19,275
"It shattered everything"

2103
02:03:19,463 --> 02:03:23,715
"Every moment..."

2104
02:03:24,562 --> 02:03:28,779
"If you remember the distance between us"

2105
02:03:28,971 --> 02:03:33,051
"It is enough"

2106
02:03:33,251 --> 02:03:36,823
"Every moment is like death"

2107
02:03:37,051 --> 02:03:41,527
"And that's the truth"

2108
02:04:20,536 --> 02:04:25,881
I didn't know that I would face
this situation until I fell in love.

2109
02:04:26,888 --> 02:04:27,888
I have to go.

2110
02:04:28,849 --> 02:04:29,873
I have to go at any cost.

2111
02:04:30,693 --> 02:04:32,885
She's is looking as
delicious as a Kashmiri apple.

2112
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:38,603
I don't know who she would give
the opportunity this time. Oh man!

2113
02:04:38,843 --> 02:04:40,995
He'll awake every night.

2114
02:04:41,086 --> 02:04:42,115
Know her address, bro.

2115
02:04:42,215 --> 02:04:43,975
- I too would try to flirt with her.
- Is it?

2116
02:04:46,256 --> 02:04:48,405
There is no need of address
for a fortunate person.

2117
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:49,681
Look there guys.

2118
02:04:51,729 --> 02:04:53,969
The chick is looking better
in reality than on the phone.

2119
02:04:55,627 --> 02:04:56,719
I'll proceed.

2120
02:04:57,303 --> 02:05:03,219
"O girl, the life without you..."

2121
02:05:03,407 --> 02:05:04,407
- Uh!
- Ah!

2122
02:05:04,612 --> 02:05:05,975
- Hey!
- What?

2123
02:05:07,151 --> 02:05:08,151
Oh no!

2124
02:05:16,445 --> 02:05:19,143
How can go like that?
You saw everyone, didn't you?

2125
02:05:20,039 --> 02:05:22,768
What's up dear,
didn't you like no one from us?

2126
02:05:24,394 --> 02:05:27,234
Let us know if you fine with it.
We'll take better care of you than him.

2127
02:05:28,151 --> 02:05:30,664
Isn't your obstinacy down by a bit
even after getting into this situation?

2128
02:05:30,688 --> 02:05:31,688
Muah!

2129
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:33,940
What is that he has
and we don't have?

2130
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,108
Enough of your staring.
Come...

2131
02:05:37,484 --> 02:05:37,904
Hey!

2132
02:05:37,989 --> 02:05:40,093
- Hey...
- Hey, catch her.

2133
02:05:40,569 --> 02:05:41,569
Ouch!

2134
02:05:42,102 --> 02:05:44,903
Where would you go without kissing me?

2135
02:05:46,987 --> 02:05:48,772
- How obstinate you are!
- Oh no!

2136
02:05:53,096 --> 02:05:55,681
Why the hell did you come
for her who left you?

2137
02:05:55,708 --> 02:05:56,770
Is she your wife?

2138
02:05:57,729 --> 02:05:58,376
She is my life.

2139
02:05:58,576 --> 02:06:00,357
Life, my foot!

2140
02:06:01,021 --> 02:06:02,355
Now, she is like open wifi.

2141
02:06:02,783 --> 02:06:04,119
Anyone can connect to her.

2142
02:06:04,334 --> 02:06:05,415
Hey, move aside.

2143
02:06:05,507 --> 02:06:07,521
There is just litte
miscommunication between us.

2144
02:06:07,945 --> 02:06:09,265
Don't try to enter in the middle.

2145
02:06:09,405 --> 02:06:10,965
What the hell would you do if we enter?

2146
02:06:15,695 --> 02:06:16,847
Huh?

2147
02:06:18,241 --> 02:06:20,265
Keerthi, let's go home.

2148
02:06:20,373 --> 02:06:22,165
I won't come.
Forget me.

2149
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:24,276
There isn't any relation between us.

2150
02:06:24,373 --> 02:06:26,853
She is telling that she doesn't
want to come, right? Leave her.

2151
02:06:37,842 --> 02:06:40,469
What, isn't there any relation between us?

2152
02:06:40,481 --> 02:06:42,441
The one who shares
emotions is called as a friend.

2153
02:06:42,545 --> 02:06:44,294
The one who shares
feelings is called as a lover.

2154
02:06:44,318 --> 02:06:46,451
The one who shares relations
is called as a better half.

2155
02:06:46,475 --> 02:06:48,519
You don't have any clarity
in how you understood me.

2156
02:06:48,669 --> 02:06:50,029
How am I supposed to know it then?

2157
02:06:50,122 --> 02:06:51,122
- Bash him...
- Hey...

2158
02:06:54,928 --> 02:06:57,202
I'm just getting clarity on life.

2159
02:06:57,357 --> 02:06:58,825
If possible, try to cooperate.

2160
02:06:59,381 --> 02:07:00,890
Otherwise, bugger off silently.

2161
02:07:04,854 --> 02:07:06,004
- Hey...
- Hey...

2162
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:22,922
Sorry, Keerthi. I don't know about
emotions, relationships and bonding.

2163
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:25,811
I assumed life to be a
ride which goes happily.

2164
02:07:26,299 --> 02:07:28,379
I believed that life was
about living as per my wish.

2165
02:07:28,767 --> 02:07:31,153
I realised that love
doesn't mean living as we like

2166
02:07:31,253 --> 02:07:34,278
but living in a way that others
like only after you left me.

2167
02:07:34,449 --> 02:07:35,809
If you say that you don't love me,

2168
02:07:35,839 --> 02:07:37,146
it means that I have no life, Keerthi.

2169
02:07:37,153 --> 02:07:40,393
If a man cried,
it is either for her mother

2170
02:07:40,517 --> 02:07:43,149
or for the girl he loved.

2171
02:07:43,397 --> 02:07:45,710
My tears are for you, Keerthi.

2172
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:47,740
Hey...

2173
02:08:10,881 --> 02:08:12,333
Even in the office that we go every day,

2174
02:08:12,357 --> 02:08:14,469
they won't allow us if we
don't have an identity card.

2175
02:08:14,493 --> 02:08:17,043
Even in the ration shop
which we visit once in a month,

2176
02:08:17,183 --> 02:08:19,623
they won't give us the ration
if we don't have an Aadhar card.

2177
02:08:19,684 --> 02:08:21,996
When I want to drive my car or a bike,

2178
02:08:22,364 --> 02:08:24,277
the government asks for a
registration certificate.

2179
02:08:24,301 --> 02:08:27,111
Right from the bank accounts to the
mobile SIM cards that are given for free,

2180
02:08:27,135 --> 02:08:32,482
Living in a society where even a visible
handicap needs an entitling identity card.

2181
02:08:33,022 --> 02:08:36,838
I didn't realise that the identity of
husband, wife, children and family

2182
02:08:39,126 --> 02:08:41,053
are provided by this, Keerthi.

2183
02:08:43,113 --> 02:08:45,713
The way I proposed you for live-in
relationship in a silly manner,

2184
02:08:46,309 --> 02:08:47,309
it was my mistake.

2185
02:08:47,764 --> 02:08:48,548
It is a mistake of...

2186
02:08:48,656 --> 02:08:51,128
all those who questions why the
marriage is necessary to live together.

2187
02:08:51,152 --> 02:08:55,160
I realised that marriage is a permanent
bonding for those whose hearts are united.

2188
02:08:55,405 --> 02:08:59,026
In order to share my
happiness and to console me in grief,

2189
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:00,404
I want you, Keerthi.

2190
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:02,274
I will marry you.

2191
02:09:02,746 --> 02:09:04,085
Kindly accept his proposal, sister.

2192
02:09:04,109 --> 02:09:07,268
Otherwise, we'll have to face
our death percussions.

2193
02:09:20,871 --> 02:09:22,429
- Hey...
- Hey, congratulations dude.

2194
02:09:22,629 --> 02:09:24,170
- Thank you
- Happy married life.

2195
02:09:24,228 --> 02:09:25,428
Ultimately, you're reconciled.

2196
02:09:25,845 --> 02:09:27,405
- Congratulations, Keerthi.
- Thank you.

2197
02:09:28,815 --> 02:09:30,535
- Hey, pose for the camera.
- Give it to me.

2198
02:09:34,844 --> 02:09:35,844
Congratulations!

2199
02:09:36,365 --> 02:09:37,232
- Happy married life.
- Thank you.

2200
02:09:37,264 --> 02:09:39,232
- I'm very happy that you married.
- Thank you.

2201
02:09:39,566 --> 02:09:40,701
This is our Indian culture.

2202
02:09:40,926 --> 02:09:41,926
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

2203
02:09:42,257 --> 02:09:43,150
Keerthi, look here.

2204
02:09:43,242 --> 02:09:44,108
- Congratulations, sir!
- Hi!

2205
02:09:44,196 --> 02:09:44,746
Thank you.

2206
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:46,271
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing good, sir.

2207
02:09:46,295 --> 02:09:49,379
I wish you a
wonderful life with your kids.

2208
02:09:50,184 --> 02:09:51,444
I know that this day would come.

2209
02:09:51,468 --> 02:09:52,787
Anyway, all the best.

2210
02:09:52,979 --> 02:09:53,483
Congrats.

2211
02:09:53,674 --> 02:09:54,436
- Thank you.
- And a happy married life.

2212
02:09:54,486 --> 02:09:55,486
Let's get a photo.

2213
02:09:57,293 --> 02:09:58,293
- Happy...
- Hey...

2214
02:10:00,478 --> 02:10:01,785
- Happy married life.
- I'll see about this later...

2215
02:10:01,809 --> 02:10:03,298
- Ultimately, you've married.
- Thank you very much.

2216
02:10:03,322 --> 02:10:04,322
Congratulations.

2217
02:10:09,357 --> 02:10:10,357
Why don't you hug me too?

2218
02:10:11,945 --> 02:10:13,718
Oh! It is a habitual mistake.

2219
02:10:13,974 --> 02:10:15,674
This isn't called as a habitual mistake.

2220
02:10:15,866 --> 02:10:18,253
- It is called as a stupid habit.
- Hey, you got me again.

2221
02:10:18,330 --> 02:10:19,365
- Understood?
- Okay.

2222
02:10:19,573 --> 02:10:20,573
One snap.

2223
02:10:20,613 --> 02:10:21,813
- Come
- Understood.

2224
02:10:23,443 --> 02:10:24,411
Come, let's have a snap.

2225
02:10:24,423 --> 02:10:25,232
- Okay...
- Happy married life.

2226
02:10:25,288 --> 02:10:25,861
Thanks dear

2227
02:10:25,944 --> 02:10:27,349
- Hey, you came up with a gift?
- Congrats

2228
02:10:27,373 --> 02:10:28,373
