00:00:52,958 --> 00:01:02,958
CENSOR CERTFICATE

2
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,625
Get up…get up.

3
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,666
Come on, up…up…

4
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,916
Come on…get up

5
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,208
Get up…

6
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,291
Come..

7
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,333
Good morning , welcome to ‘Laser Live’

8
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,666
And today it’s on Breakfast’.

9
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,291
Let’s see, after a night of expectations…

10
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,333
here we’re on a session with marvels.

11
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,958
See…Appam.

12
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,000
We better don’t call it ‘Appam’,

13
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,625
more sort of a half-way point between

14
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,250
a dosa and a papad,

15
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,916
a half breed of mishap.

16
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,375
See…she is the sculptor.

17
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,875
...and leaving out all those, we have another

18
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,041
inevitable presence of no wonder… the Water’.

19
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,666
So, will be back with another program, ok?

20
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,166
Ma’am, you called for me?

21
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,625
What’s happening with France?

22
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,333
So naughty, all the more…

23
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
yesterday he got into fight.

24
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,875
What if this continues?

25
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,791
Parents are doing nothing!

26
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,208
‘France Laser, his name!

27
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,458
He couldn’t even write that with no mistakes.

28
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,375
What was it yesterday?  
What was the fight about?

29
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,041
Tejas stripped my trouser.

30
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,208
Tejas?

31
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,666
Tejas….?

32
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,291
Teacher…I was looking for the Spiderman thingy…

33
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,625
Come here…come here…

34
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,500
Checking to see…if he has the Spiderman underwear.

35
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,916
Playing with underwear? Don’t!

36
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,916
Ask your mother to give me a call.

37
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:24,750
Huh…

38
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,500
Spiderman, superman…really?  
Why are you guys in school?

39
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:29,916
To study…

40
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:32,750
See to it.

41
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,291
I’ll

42
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,708
Anyhow I’ll meet with Tejas’s parents.

43
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,125
Ok!

44
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,375
Again late…

45
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,500
They kicked-off from the morning,

46
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,791
one in instagram and the other tik tok.

47
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,833
Can’t we find a single reason to get them to work?

48
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,125
Life should have some fantasies…

49
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,333
…to boot life into our life.

50
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,708
Give a 100.

51
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,291
Sir…please check this design too.

52
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,875
Ok with this, we have the total to Rs 4550/.

53
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,625
After the sale of puzhakkal property, I’ll pay off.

54
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,416
Shall I leave?

55
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,833
Got any idea of how many 100s through…?

56
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,375
Aagh…

57
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,000
Huh, this was your pastime?  
Making as if you’re here for football.

58
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,041
Got a cancelled order, pizza!

59
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,166
Pizza?

60
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:31,458
Come on…

61
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,541
A classmate of mine is a Priest/ father,

62
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,166
principal in Deva Matha School.

63
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:36,833
They got a vacancy,

64
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,583
asked if I’m interested to take up the job?

65
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,541
Close to home  
Maybe we can get an admission for France.

66
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,375
Biju chetta...he is Anson.

67
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,291
Namaste Sir!

68
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,000
There is a minor mess of Rs 50,000/

69
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,750
Got anything to atop?

70
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,583
Who all got 5/5?

71
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,166
Ok, hands down.

72
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,708
France?

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,208
Show me your book?

74
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:06,708
Stand up.

75
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,750
I can’t…I can’t stand this anymore.

76
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,333
Ansa…got a design for the concept.

77
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,916
I had submitted a concept in a new company,

78
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,750
if it makes through, all will be good.

79
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,541
‘Learn to creep before you leap’

80
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,041
Even if the elephant lose weight,  
he cannot be kept in a corral.

81
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:27,666
Oh…if elephant shed a lot weight, not corral  
he can fit into even a toilet. Do you know that?

82
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,750
First you invested money like water  
for your own startup company,

83
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,875
Now you are trying to bend over backwards  
for branding another company.

84
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
Anson, why don’t you decide to stand up for one of your  
decision?

85
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,625
Your monthly rent can only be made on 6th? Great!

86
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:39,958
Hey old hag…

87
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,291
What…? Why are you babbling?

88
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,458
How long I have been asking you to cut that tree?

89
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,416
I won’t…

90
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,375
How many times you have been here?

91
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,875
Here is yesterday’s dictation…

92
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,916
Not that he got it wrong;

93
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,541
He also made it look like he got full marks 5 out of 5.

94
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,375
Exams are drawing closer.

95
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:01,583
Hello…

96
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,041
We gave a thought, looks like  
we’re not in need of an advertisement.

97
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,708
How about considering once more…?

98
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,000
What is it? Any hope?

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,375
What did they say?

100
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,250
France?

101
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,958
Come on, do your homework.

102
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,375
Go after we wrap up this game.

103
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,250
I have been calling him for a  
long time to finish homework.

104
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,250
He is still playing with his grandfather.

105
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,583
Grandfather already made enough  
wreck to the family with his playing.

106
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,000
Now he is not far behind ruining the child too.

107
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,666
Anson! Every day I can’t put  
up with the fight for rent.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,125
Whatever I say, he refuses to say a word.

109
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,875
Hey Ansa…add Apple and Microsoft too.

110
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,291
However you wrote all the brands  
with very little possibilities.

111
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,666
Our marketing is not right, that’s our issue.

112
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,791
It’s not an issue but a failure, that’s our failure.

113
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,541
Here comes another failure.

114
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,541
Joss chetta, having fun?

115
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,708
Do you need some fun?

116
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,291
Ah?

117
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:17,666
People want to nose around every matter,  
having or not having fun.

118
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,375
Jose chetta, it’s been two weeks. Where were you?

119
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,208
I went for a retreat.

120
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,791
Where? Potta?

121
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,583
Not Potta, in Attapadi.

122
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,875
But Jose chetan is a teetotaler and no smoking too.

123
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,416
I was not there for those but for to pray,  
to change my mother’s mind.

124
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,291
For what?

125
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,000
To get the puzhakkal property.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,708
If not, my 5 sisters will swallow up that too.

127
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,958
Hey, let me say what I came for,

128
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,000
I saw Shashi.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,958
Shashi from Idikulla agency?

130
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,250
A work proposed to them,  
they agreed to arrange the meeting.

131
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,708
C-guard Kochu Lona is the one.

132
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,916
Now it’s all up to you guys.

133
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:05,416
Actually once Kochu Lona’s marriage alliance  
was brought up for my niece, Linda.

134
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,833
He was a door to door salesman at those times.

135
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,625
But our pride never satisfied with the status of the family.

136
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,541
Now give a look. Where is C- guard and where is Linda lying?

137
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,916
Where is Linda lying?

138
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,000
You better take care of your things.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,583
This is our family’s curse.

140
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,541
What’s Kochu Lona’s product?

141
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,666
He studied something related to electronics.

142
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,000
To invent some power supply ideas into business,

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,416
he asked for a loan of Rs 50000/ to his father.

144
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,000
50,000/ was a huge amount in the past.

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,583
Huh…

146
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,541
He sold his house’s rear end property.

147
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:46,375
See how far he got, from 50 thousand  
he made 50 thousand cr.

148
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:52,291
Why can’t my mother give the Ten  
cent of the puzhakkal property?

149
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,750
Look as though the snake won’t die  
and the stick remains unbroken.

150
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,791
How come the snake is not dead?

151
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,458
Why don’t you ask your father?

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,416
Patience too got a breaking point.

153
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,541
Why can’t you keep your mouth shut?

154
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,958
Not just Attapadi, he won’t change  
even after a visit to Rome.

155
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,125
France... Dad’s wish is that  
you should play for India.

156
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,416
So…could I win?

157
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,000
Winning and losing should never matter,

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,208
what we do is play our best.

159
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:35,500
There are four rules to reap success in our life.

160
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,291
You know the first rule?

161
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,208
Nope…

162
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,041
Set a goal.

163
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,375
Kick a goal?

164
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,291
Not about kicking the ball,

165
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,875
We should have a clear determination, an aspiration.

166
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:53,500
Not the little dreams, dream big to  
become something out of life.

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,250
Hey…there is no world cup for card games. K’ay?

168
00:11:59,541 --> 00:11:59,916
Ok..

169
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,708
Don’t blow your time in the card games.  
Keep it there.

170
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,541
Da…, Superman is already here.

171
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,666
Da…play well, remember what I said.

172
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:33,500
Hello

173
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,083
Yes Job, go on…

174
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,125
Give the presentation.  
I’ll be back in office after the coaching.

175
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:51,791
What happened?

176
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,500
Nothing…

177
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,958
A minor cut on the head.

178
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,791
A scratch on the eyebrow hence the  
bleeding, just normal. Don’t worry.

179
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,125
May be I can come

180
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,375
He needs to get stitches, where should i…

181
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,250
What happened?

182
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,000
He fell down.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,625
Come…

184
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,166
Ok

185
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,625
That’s a nasty cut, come on…

186
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,625
You can wait outside.

187
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,125
I’ll be here.

188
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,083
Sir, you can pay the bill here.

189
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,208
How much is the bill?

190
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,708
How much should I pay?

191
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,750
There is normal stitch but a scar remains

192
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,791
Then surgical stitch which is clear.

193
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,916
What’s your prefer?

194
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,583
How much will that be?

195
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,041
Normal stitch Rs 450

196
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,250
The scar free surgical stitch will cost around Rs 6000.

197
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,541
You can choose.

198
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,875
Rs 6000/?

199
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,375
Hey what happened huh?

200
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,416
There is little trouble…give me some water.

201
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,583
Here, take it.

202
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,000
France had little accident.

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,750
Accident? How come?

204
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
During football he tripped,  
he got three stitches on head.

205
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,333
3?

206
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:26,833
Yeah.

207
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,583
I got no money.

208
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,708
How much is it?

209
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,791
It’s…Rs 6000/

210
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,625
How…much…?

211
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,416
Rs 6 thousand.

212
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,041
6 thousand?

213
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:38,708
Come

214
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,583
You know well…

215
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,541
Sister! How much?

216
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:46,916
6,000

217
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,041
Oh!

218
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,375
You take card?

219
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,000
hmm

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,666
Will you?

221
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,166
Yes.

222
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,291
Here…

223
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,083
There is no way I’m holding him back from playing due  
to a stitch and I’ll never think about it anytime soon.

224
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,208
Then why can’t you show the same concern in his studies?

225
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,708
We should take stern steps from  
time to time to improve his language.

226
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,166
He’s not in desperate situation for a rank.

227
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:12,875
At this young age what he need is some friends  
and the right social skills nothing else.

228
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,208
How could you impede my every action?

229
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:22,958
Dad…?

230
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,083
Yes…

231
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,166
I’ll become a scientist.

232
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,416
So that you can go to a prison,  
after falling into some secret conspiracy play.

233
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,416
The second rule to bring in success to your life…

234
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,625
Neglect naysayers

235
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,250
That means…keep the negative jaw chaps at arm’s length.

236
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,666
What you mean by negative jaw?

237
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,416
Didn’t you here what your granddad said,

238
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,833
that you may go to prison if you become a scientist.

239
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,000
The exact same thing.

240
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,750
Hello…how is he?

241
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,000
Just three stitches.

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,041
It’s a normal injury in the field, let him rest.

243
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,541
Day after tomorrow he’ll be in the game.

244
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,083
Hello

245
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,333
Hello, Anson?

246
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,125
Yes…

247
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,625
You should come to the south police station.

248
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,958
What happened sir?

249
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,125
We have your father here.

250
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,375
Why?

251
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,791
Come here and we can have the talk.

252
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,333
Yes, hello

253
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,583
Give the phone to dad.

254
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,666
Oh, sure…wait.

255
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,291
I think dad is in the bathroom.

256
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,083
In bathroom?

257
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:53,625
Yes.

258
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,125
Sir…

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,416
He was gambling.

260
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,125
Do you know how long we were trying  
to reach you? It’s your own father right?

261
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:09,875
Yes.

262
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,541
Card game betting on money is not a habit to follow

263
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,708
This is your last warning.

264
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,250
For now you can leave after paying the fine.

265
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,458
Don’t repeat it.

266
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:25,958
We can go.

267
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,708
Thank you sir.

268
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,583
Dad? You played alone?

269
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,375
No…others ran off, I couldn’t make it far…

270
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,125
Hop on…! Couldn’t make far…!

271
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,791
There is always another pain in the neck.

272
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,958
Don’t step out from the house, if not I can make sure.

273
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,833
Mathew and family will be here.

274
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,916
Sure, I’ll try.

275
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:07,583
You should come.

276
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,291
Ok, I’ll.

277
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:13,666
What?

278
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,666
What happened?

279
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,666
Where were you?

280
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,000
I was here.

281
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,541
What did you say when I asked about dad?

282
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:20,833
Dad?

283
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,583
Huh?

284
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,208
You told he was in bathroom.

285
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:24,666
Yes he was there…

286
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,833
Bathroom….huh? Dad in bathroom?

287
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,791
He was at the police station. Did you hear?

288
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,208
Police station?

289
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,666
Nothing like that.

290
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,625
What NOTHING?

291
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,250
Told you whatever bull you play,  
do it inside the house.

292
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,708
And what did I say to you?

293
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
Did I mention any other responsibility?

294
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,458
I asked you to take care of dad.

295
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,416
Didn’t I?

296
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,583
Open your mouth and say yes or no?

297
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,500
What other work you have here?

298
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,875
Did I ever ask you to do some other works?

299
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,541
Hello…hello dear…

300
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,208
Now what the bull you reading?

301
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,833
You got any idea how I’m trying  
to meet ends monthly?

302
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,708
Anson? Do you know how’s it going here?

303
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,916
I know enough, that’s what I’m speaking about.

304
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,375
What do you know? What is it?

305
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,791
I sold your flat, that’s it right?  
And I’ll make sure I return it.

306
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,416
Is that enough?

307
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,125
I’m working my guts out for you guys.

308
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,333
Where is my key?

309
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,208
Nah…I’m at casino, yeah…got something to deal.

310
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,166
Park the car over there.

311
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,416
Huh…all are here.

312
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,375
Hey you made it.

313
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,708
He is Shashi.

314
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,833
Namaste

315
00:19:55,833 --> 00:20:00,333
I apologize; I was caught up with the  
dispute between Swami and Menon.

316
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,541
Who else can iron out other than me?

317
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,458
How about we step in to restaurant,  
we can talk and grab a bite to eat.

318
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,166
Yes, sure.

319
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:14,041
You know…these things, this one. I would never touch it.

320
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,166
Why is that?

321
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,333
America or Europe, we’re always Indian.

322
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:23,583
Grab it. Take it like this… so we can savour every bit.

323
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,458
Varghese…chicken fried rice, ok?

324
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,458
Oh…no...We.

325
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Can we get a quick start to our plan of action?

326
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,875
I mean about meeting Kochu Lona.

327
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,833
I canasureee

328
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,083
Sorry I didn’t get it.

329
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,625
I can assure it, consider it done.

330
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,791
What’s your company’s name?

331
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,458
BRAND IT’

332
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,166
OK…brand it.

333
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,458
You know how Idikulla agencies thrive?

334
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,541
How did it thrive?

335
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,708
Ok, I can make plain.

336
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,875
Idik…ah l …u…

337
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,041
Ansa…did you figure out what he meant?

338
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,125
Salad…

339
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:58,916
Sir…how about fruits salad?

340
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,166
Ok, fruits salad.

341
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,125
Make it fast.

342
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:10,583
Hello…huh, ok…give me a minute.

343
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,333
Go...on eat, I’ll be back soon.

344
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,875
I’ll…I’ll be here.

345
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,083
Hello…huh, Vallarkavu? Hmm.

346
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:16,791
Wow…

347
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Sir, anything else?

348
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,375
No…nothing, that’s it. Huh?

349
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,041
Shall I bring the bill?

350
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:28,666
Ye…yeah.

351
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,166
Taste good.

352
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,208
Oh…not yet, Shashi will pay.

353
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,291
Shashi chetan already headed out.

354
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,500
We will…

355
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,166
Sure.

356
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,083
It’s Jose brother.

357
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,541
His number is switched off.

358
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,041
Is it?

359
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,833
I’ll just be back after washing hands.

360
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,500
Sir, its closing time.

361
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,416
Lemme see, how much is the bill?

362
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Rs 3500/

363
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,750
Three thousand five hundred?

364
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:45,541
Yes, Diana?

365
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,833
Anson…you swiped the card at restaurant.

366
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,916
Actually I was there for a meeting with the new client.

367
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,166
I never took that money even during more pressing situation, 
thought it’ll be better to maintain minimum balance.

368
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,666
It was an emergency, or else I won’t.

369
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,583
You ruined it…it’s not about the money. it’s the way you do  
things.

370
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,708
France? Mom looks as though she is on a short fuse.

371
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,541
Mom got nothing to do.

372
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,916
I can’t put up with you anymore, I’m done with everything.

373
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,500
You cut the call, I’ll home soon.

374
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,333
What’s this?

375
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,000
This is not coming.

376
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,375
Go…move.

377
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,208
France.

378
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,208
Where are they?

379
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,041
Ansa, she took her bags with her.

380
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,083
Her dad was here to take her.

381
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,208
When did they go?

382
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:18,125
Just some time….any problems?

383
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,291
No…no problems, she mentioned that she’ll be going.

384
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,291
These are your mom’s first communion photos.

385
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,375
What about this one?

386
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,916
That’s when we visited Singapore,

387
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:58,750
Singapore.

388
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,000
These photos?

389
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,208
Your mother was a school leader.

390
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,083
Why are you using these glasses?

391
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,916
You may go blind.

392
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,791
What’s that, giving to the mouth?

393
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,500
That’s first communion.

394
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,625
Straight into mouth?

395
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,166
Yes.

396
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,875
What’s it name?

397
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,125
Name is sacramental bread.

398
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,375
Want to learn?

399
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,750
Come…

400
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,083
France…

401
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:04,375
Get in.

402
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,458
France? Pull your boots up.

403
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,750
He won’t wear that.

404
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,250
What are you doing Diana?

405
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,708
I told you, it was an emergency, a meeting.

406
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,583
Is it really important than paying your house rent?

407
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:33,875
We can give the rent.

408
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,500
That was the only money left in my card.

409
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,125
If it comes with no choice,

410
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,833
I was prepared to toss that money into the old lady’s face.

411
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,125
You really need to take in a way to manage the teacher.

412
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:47,541
I’m busting my back to earn money,  
keep all your needs fulfilled.

413
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:51,291
Yet here, you accuse me as in lap of luxury.

414
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,166
Right…go on…

415
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,125
A reason for not paying the rent.

416
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,333
What is troubling you?

417
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,333
Nothing is working out.

418
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,500
Not working? What should I do more?  
I’m all in making it work.

419
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,625
We’re exhausted, we got fed up Anson.

420
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,750
We got fed up? Say you got tired.

421
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,291
We’re not fed up, ARE YOU?’

422
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,625
Now he is not talking.

423
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,083
Ask him? He is just fine.

424
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,208
You’re a big failure Anson.

425
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:16,875
Am I a failure? Me?

426
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:17,958
Yes you are…

427
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,833
I know better, a failure or not, not you.

428
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,250
Yes you’re, we don’t want you anymore in our life.

429
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,250
Our life? Whose life?

430
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,958
I and my son don’t need you anymore.

431
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,708
If you don’t want me any more just get out of my life.

432
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,750
France…come on.

433
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,250
Who the heck blaring the horn? Huh…?

434
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,666
Come..

435
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,375
If YOU want to go…you should.

436
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,208
I’m not leaving alone.

437
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:34,958
Get out…OUT

438
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:35,916
No, I won’t, not alone.

439
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:36,583
OUT…OUT right now.

440
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,291
Not alone, but with him.

441
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,250
You’re getting out or not?

442
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:39,916
GET OUT…

443
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,041
If I drag you out, it can be utter disgrace.

444
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,375
Close the door.

445
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
So get OUT I say…

446
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,166
We need a lawyer, that’s our only option.

447
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,375
I need my son.

448
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,541
That will be enough, for our own good

449
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,166
What are you doing?

450
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,041
I’m out of it.

451
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:00,750
Hmm?

452
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:02,875
I’m out of these…

453
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,000
For?

454
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:05,541
Playing.

455
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,083
Playing?

456
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:07,791
Huh!

457
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:08,958
You WANT TO PLAY NOW?

458
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,416
Is that what I’m talking about?

459
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,416
Your mother left because of it…

460
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,041
You got no attention in your studies.

461
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,708
Keep on playing...

462
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,041
Do you want to study?

463
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,291
What does the teacher said?

464
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:33,291
Do you know the spelling of any words?

465
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,083
No…

466
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:34,833
No…?

467
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:36,583
What game is this?

468
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,041
Monopoly

469
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,583
Do you know to spell it, you see it every day.

470
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,916
Go and study something.

471
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,083
What are you studying?

472
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:19,458
Is it me? That mom left?

473
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,458
Is it me? That mom left?

474
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,708
Let it go…ok?

475
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,750
Mom left because of dad.

476
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:58,208
Hey…

477
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,625
France?

478
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:11,250
We both are not the reason mom left us, right?

479
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:13,666
Is it?

480
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:26,166
Like the shore seeks the swell,

481
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:31,458
What are we questing along?

482
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:37,083
Like a saga coined by someone,

483
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:42,375
We’re going as the seethe sweeps.

484
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,083
Baby is a busy body

485
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,041
He is a boy.

486
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,291
Now a days girls too kind of busy body

487
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,791
Then a girl?

488
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,250
Wait outside. I’ll call

489
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:09,416
Once cast around for a crescent,

490
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:15,083
Lay the burning stars in darkness.

491
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:20,875
Like we waited for an endless rain,

492
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:26,916
In the name of Father, son and the Holy spirit 
France Laser’ shall be blessed

493
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:32,208
A beam blooming for the season to rise

494
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:37,625
We’re pulsing along

495
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,083
Look at the documents…single owner.

496
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,208
What about its condition.

497
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:01,291
Straight from the car porch.

498
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,500
A lady doctor was using it, not running.

499
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,416
Not running?

500
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,208
Not running means…she was not using it.

501
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,333
Anson, you sound like you don’t believe me.

502
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,916
Saved by the lord.

503
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:25,291
Like the shore seeks the swell,

504
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,916
France open house is today, take him there.

505
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:31,291
We’re questing along.

506
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:36,125
Like a saga coined by someone,

507
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,791
Aunty…I got a bike too

508
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,708
Don’t call me aunty, call me Teacher.

509
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:43,041
…and about the bike, you can park it over there.

510
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:47,833
Muscle is looking great.

511
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,000
Have breakfast

512
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,708
Dad, this is breakfast?

513
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,166
I’m not going to school today.

514
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:57,916
Why?

515
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,750
School is so boring.

516
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,875
Dad is bored to go to office, still I’m going.

517
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,708
Drink tea.

518
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,458
No taste and got a burned tongue.

519
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:15,750
During the walks through distances

520
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,416
We draw together…

521
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,041
What happened? Looks like trouble.

522
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:24,625
As days running out.

523
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:25,541
Oh!

524
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,916
You move away from it.

525
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,750
Ouch… son, give a push.

526
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,708
Brother how much is it?

527
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,291
Rs 20/

528
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:37,833
20?

529
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,875
Are we late?

530
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,583
Thank you.

531
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:50,583
Come..

532
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:52,500
Oh?

533
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,208
How are you ma’am?

534
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:55,958
I’m fine, take a seat.

535
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,875
About France Laser there is nothing different to point out.

536
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:01,708
Oh!

537
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,458
I have been saying the same things.

538
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:07,041
Other than both parents taking turns in coming here,

539
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,958
there is no improvement.

540
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,750
May be giving a special attention can do well.

541
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,250
Any how you guys proved, you’re not capable to taking care  
of the child.

542
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:19,875
No…Ma’am, I’ll give more care.

543
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,916
Same line repeating every time.

544
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,750
Hey ‘Joppa…’

545
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,458
Come on…be quick man..

546
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:32,500
Sorry got tad late…

547
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,291
Do you know what time is it?

548
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:33,875
My car got stalled man, total.

549
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:34,541
You know how long I was waiting?

550
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,166
What can i?

551
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,125
Gonna screw up?

552
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,708
We don’t need Kurian’

553
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,666
Look into that highway property’

554
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,666
Hmm, I’ll

555
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,416
Anson…

556
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,625
Good afternoon

557
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:47,500
Joseph..

558
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,041
Please…

559
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:48,958
Hello…

560
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,833
As yet we got a marketing company,

561
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,041
Based on Bangalore

562
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:06,250
As for now, it’s for a new product of our company.

563
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,375
Something started from my father’s time..

564
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,708
He had a ‘hair oil mix’,

565
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,750
And the people who used in the past now wish to re-launch  
it’

566
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,125
Way back marketing doesn’t exist.

567
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,291
About your former works?

568
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,916
Before we were working in a branding company.

569
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:27,583
Recently…

570
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,458
Together we debut a new company, ‘Brand it’

571
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:34,208
Shashi, if we’re going with a new company,  
isn’t it gonna be an elevated risk.

572
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:37,375
Sir, can you allow sixty seconds on me, can I tell a story?

573
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:43,166
A story happened about twenty years ago in a village.

574
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:46,791
a student of electronics designed a voltage regulator  
circuit.

575
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,291
He asked his father a loan of 50,000 to develop it into a  
business.

576
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,125
The father who was clueless about electronics

577
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:56,125
gave him money after selling his  
house’s back end property.

578
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:00,666
The son eventually turned out to be a king in 
electronics world, reaping crores of money.

579
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,625
We’re here before the same king.

580
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,958
The trust father entitled on his son”

581
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,833
Sir, can’t you please grant the same gesture?

582
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:13,833
Great…

583
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,875
Shashi…,Kids just pitched into the heart”

584
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:23,583
I was so touched, I got Goosebumps.

585
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,791
Franco? What’s your outlook?

586
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,208
I think we better not do it.

587
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,833
Shashi…let’s give them a shot.

588
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,250
You close that, just close it.

589
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,625
Sir, we will go all out for the best.

590
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,916
Emotional blackmailing!

591
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:45,625
Thank you sir.

592
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:46,041
Ok

593
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:46,833
See you sir.

594
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,208
Ok then.

595
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,416
Dad? How do airplanes fly?

596
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:58,375
You got troubles with spellings! Why?

597
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:03,583
Dad, you don’t know that I got a lousy memory?

598
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:09,458
Mind gleamed thousands of golden glimmer...

599
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:19,250
When life meets with troubles, a three round  
ride around Trissur circle can solve it in no time.

600
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,125
Flames swelled the furnace,

601
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,666
Settles the woe, today-

602
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:32,958
Pain thawed on its own

603
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:38,458
Pace into slow steps

604
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:42,000
Put behind the many

605
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,833
Go high to the steps

606
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:49,708
Go Fight to success

607
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,208
Hey woman? Sorry

608
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,083
I don’t need your stupid sorry or the oil cake.

609
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,250
I got no oil cake to share; I can do a sorry though.

610
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,458
I’ll proceed with the case till I see you behind bars.

611
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,416
You get lost.

612
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,666
Yes. i…o

613
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,458
Most frequently used alphabet in a dictionary is E’

614
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,750
i…o

615
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:54,750
Go on the journey through night and day

616
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,833
Got Stumbled, Rise again

617
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:05,958
Goes the tale we penned

618
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,625
Pace into slow steps

619
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:14,166
Put behind the many

620
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:17,791
Diana was brought up in a sound atmosphere

621
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:21,708
Her gold and money you used in your 
business was reduced to nothing.

622
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:26,166
If child wants to do well in his education 
he ought to stay with mother.

623
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:31,083
When both of you are at row,  
there is a child growing tangled between.

624
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,250
We want our child back.

625
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,083
You need the child’s custody, that’s it?

626
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:40,000
Nothing should hurt him, that’s all I want.

627
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:45,458
The thing is, the engine is totalled.

628
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,666
But parts are not a available for this one..

629
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,000
Where can I keep it?

630
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,041
You outta here…

631
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:53,375
What’s the next step?

632
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:59,166
We will soon go to Coimbatore, get a half engine,

633
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,000
Then fix it and good to go.

634
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:03,833
Hey son, alright

635
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,333
Bye…

636
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,875
Dad, what’s it that you are sitting here?

637
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:17,416
That woman threw us out, and changed the locks.

638
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,708
Grandpa, you should say teacher not woman.

639
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:21,416
Ok, teacher’

640
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:23,416
Anson, here is the key.

641
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:26,541
I need you out, right now with all your things.

642
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,541
Teacher I can pay the balance by tomorrow.

643
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,208
You don’t get a choice here, so…

644
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,875
How can I leave with them with no place to go?

645
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,541
No use in talking to me, what do I know?

646
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,458
Now take the key…

647
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,708
Pays no rent and an absolute pain in the neck.

648
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,291
Leave that here…

649
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:53,625
No?

650
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,375
No.

651
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,708
Bring the books.

652
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,416
You got your uniform?

653
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:06,916
Hmm

654
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,708
Dad, get moving.

655
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:20,000
It’s a danger curve, be careful…watch out!!!

656
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,708
Hey…

657
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,375
Dad will you stop talking?

658
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,833
Making distractions…

659
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:28,791
Dad, are we going to stay here…?

660
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,083
Yes, for now.

661
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:42,458
Dad…I’m hungryyyy

662
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,541
Dad…I’m…HUNGRYYYY

663
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:48,583
Heard the first time.

664
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,458
Dad, what you want?

665
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,458
Anything can do

666
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:55,791
Hey…man

667
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:59,291
That old hag threw us out.

668
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,458
What’s the scene?

669
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:01,916
Food?

670
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,083
Gravy would taste better with few more pieces.

671
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,416
Grandpa, eat faster, we gotta play cards.

672
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,166
Perfect time for playing cards

673
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,250
You are not playing? Go on…

674
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,416
It’s new type of cards.

675
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,250
What new?

676
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,250
Blast cards’

677
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,833
Blast cards? Right game for the messed up situation.

678
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,791
What game is this? Full of alphabets.

679
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:30,708
Jhommy Brother, this is like a card game ….

680
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,041
All the same it’s a card game too’

681
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:33,541
What?

682
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:39,083
We should make words…words, so the alphabets

683
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,333
My phone.

684
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,375
The person who get the right set,

685
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:48,125
Should keep the card upturned and say ‘blast’

686
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,833
Blast…’

687
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:54,333
What happened?

688
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:56,666
won

689
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:57,791
Oh? If one wins, should say like this.

690
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:58,500
Continue the game…

691
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,541
SOLUTIONS

692
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:02,291
Hey it’s school night, go to sleep

693
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,625
Don’t you want to get to work tomorrow? 
'Solutions'.

694
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,208
The only thing that’s not here.

695
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:26,250
Hmm…ok

696
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,916
Sir, France won’t be playing anymore.

697
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:33,958
Wound is not troubling right?

698
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,791
Oh no…nothing.

699
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,125
Ok, then.

700
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:37,875
France…let’s go?

701
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:40,833
Come on…

702
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,833
Mom said to stop playing when I got the stitches,

703
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,708
But we didn’t, why?

704
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:53,333
They would think you’re scared to play

705
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:55,750
But now dad is out of cash.

706
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,166
It’ll be fine.

707
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,000
Do you know the story….?

708
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,875
When dad start out for football selection…

709
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,625
Coach did a powerful kick…

710
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,666
I opened my eyes after someone  
splashed water on my face.

711
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,333
You know where the ball hit’

712
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,541
Right on dad’s face.

713
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,791
After that I was scared at the sight of ball

714
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,958
That stopped dad from going for football and others.

715
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,333
Granddad never allowed?

716
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,375
Granddad was in Mumbai.

717
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:36,750
Granddad once tried cycling

718
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,916
He fell down hard,

719
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:41,541
Well then he never ride a bicycle

720
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,458
Not rode a bike nor learn to drive a car.

721
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,958
Only thing he knows is the card game.

722
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:50,125
You better don’t learn all that.

723
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,166
Understand?

724
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:52,750
Ok

725
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:58,333
We can be back when we have the money. Ok?

726
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:12,875
Back off…

727
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,041
If you’re brave enough, try a game with us.

728
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,583
Show your game…

729
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,833

734
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,791
Huh- huh?

735
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,000
Playing cards?

736
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,708
Who brought it?

00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:22,583
France…, stand up. GET OUT’

740
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:24,625
Teacher, we didn’t play

741
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,833
Without your parents here,

742
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,208
you won’t be allowed inside the class

743
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,333
Get out…get out

744
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,375
Everyone take their textbooks

745
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:45,125

00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:54,125
Hey you had a crow bath? Did you clean well?

748
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:54,875
Yes

749
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:55,833
Dried off?

750
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:57,750
Did you use soap well?

751
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:58,916

752
00:47:58,916 --> 00:47:59,416

00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,750
Keep it there.

757
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,750
I have a feeling that I had seen this before.’

758
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:11,875

00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,583
We call it as a Déjà vu’ moment’

761
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,583
Déjà vu’? What does that mean?

762
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:22,416
When a situation occur It seems to spark our  
memory of a situation we have already been,

763
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,333
That is called Déjà vu’ moment.

764
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,541
What is the spelling of déjà vu’?

765
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:27,833

00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,541
V for victor, u for uniform

774
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,791
Get dressed into your uniform.

775
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,500
What about your suggestions in regards to the names.

776
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,541
These three names are the most sorted ones.

777
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,666
Samskriti, Kesha, Vedika

778
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,625
Kesha sounds interesting.

779
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,041
‘Kesha’! How is it?

780
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:03,083
Not the best.

781
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:07,333
To be honest, our personal choice too was same.

782
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,875
‘What about the remaining steps in the process?

783
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,375
How’s the planning coming up to forward the campaign?

784
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,958
Now the trend is social media

785
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:16,000
We’re thinking of a #tag campaign’

786
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,666
#tag V2’ campaign,

787
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:18,791
That’s a one liner…

788
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,250
Run this one liner for three days in different social media  
platforms.

789
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,583
Sir, our #tag campaign’s tag line will be,

00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:32,166
‘no other Kerala girl go under this predicament’

792
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,000
How is it?

793
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,625
Nearly fine, unlikely

794
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:45,833
I’ll give an amount…as a token

795
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,333

It’s not a line, they’re really smart.

This is Swami…a great man.

828
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,458
Nothing like that I’m just a normal…

829
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,041
Swami should give the new ads to them.

830
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:09,708
Oh sure.

831
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:11,458
Joy? What will you have?

832
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:12,833
Non-vegetarian.

833
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:15,375

Speaking from the experience…

845
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:56,250
A women leaves a man out of her life, always  
for the other man and she sure loves him.

846
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,750
Quit it already, a child is here.

847
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,375
I was giving the reality check’

848
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Hey, you don’t worry man.

849
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:07,000
Hey, another thing…your business is wreck and

You’re penniless, may be that shocked her.

She decided to send the notice.

852
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:12,416
Dad…?

853
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:13,208
Hmm

854
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:18,000
‘yesterday school principal called dad’

855
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,333
Principal calling…

856
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:29,416
Come..

857
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:41,375
Mr. Anson, do you know why you’re being asked to meet?

858
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,375
Any idea?

859
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:43,208
No

860
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:49,208
To discuss your son’s heroism in the class.

861
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,875
And you know what?

862
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,458
He played cards in the class’

863
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,125
Caught red hand by the Hindi teacher.

864
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,208
Home room teacher too present here

865
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,416
All have the same opinion.

866
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,125
Your boy is not at all having any discipline.

867
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,208
What you have to say about it?

868
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,125
Sir, I’ll make sure he never brings cards to the class.

869
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:36,833
Make sure he won’t bring the cards? That means…

870
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,666
Sir, one minute…let me take this call.

871
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:39,541
See

872
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,000
Sir, I’m in…

873
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:42,666
Where are you man?

874
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,291
Sir, I’m at my son’s school for a matter.

875
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:48,833
Have you ever heard of the kesha brand name before?

876
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:51,291
What happened?

877
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,375
Same brand name available in Calicut market.

878
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,875
How irresponsible work…

879
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:02,125
From the beginning I told you, this is not a  
project that a startup guys can stomach.

880
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:07,000
There is no brand in that name, 
We checked through the market.

881
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:10,000
Only two days left for the launch.

882
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,750
You guys gonna ruin my company’s reputation.

883
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,750
I cannot put up with it anymore…

884
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,583
Stop everything.

885
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:20,041
You do nothing regarding this project.

886
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:25,083
Sir, we’re halfway through the channel promotion.

887
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:27,958
No...No…channel, everything will hit the brake.

888
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:29,916
Meet me immediately in my office.

889
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:31,250
Do you get it?

890
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,583
Stop everything

891
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:38,833
Mr. Anson, now we know the real reason.

892
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:46,458
We were discussing seriously about your son  
and here you’re talking business on the phone.

893
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:48,041
I’m really sorry sir.

894
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,083
You see…this is the problem.

895
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:53,000
You know…you’re the role model to your son.

896
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,000
There is one more thing.

897
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:00,125
In the whole school three students are black listed,

898
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:02,541
…and one is your son.

899
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:09,083
Because of that reason he is  
expelled from the one day tour.

900
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:15,375
Sir, if he got expelled from the tour,  
what about his mental state.

901
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:19,000
What should we do? Find a spot in the front row?

902
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:23,625
We need to take the kids back home safely, Mr. Anson

903
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:24,083
See…

904
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,166
We are a well-respected school

905
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:30,125
The sole purpose of this meeting is…

906
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:34,208
To give you the final warning.

907
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,666
We have no other option except  
expel him from the school

908
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:44,791
Any how this is the last chance, last and final

909
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:45,916
Ok sir

910
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:46,541
Ok?

911
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:48,708
Come on. Let’s go

912
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:50,291
Please.

913
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,083
I reached Ukkadam'

914
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:08,166
You do one thing, just come back

915
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,583
We can take it some other time.

916
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,458
What about it?

917
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,250
See…

918
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:44,208
From the very beginning , I was crystal clear that

919
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:47,291
I’m launching this product as a tribute to my dad.

920
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:48,416
Kesha…

921
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:52,916
Some typical plain people using the brand name, what then?

922
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:56,333
There is no trademark printed on this brand name.

923
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,958
See when you are dealing with companies like us, 
you should have double checked every aspects.

924
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,708
Sir, we proffered each names at the  
presentation after double checking.

925
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:06,750
Sir

926
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:10,208
Every last detailing for the launch is set to go,

927
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:12,333
Hoardings, newspaper, online campaigns…

928
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:15,750
You got any clues how much money  
has been stumped up at each phase.

929
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:18,916
Sir, we will confirm the details after meeting them.

930
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:22,833
I won’t allow anything that may stain my father’s name.

931
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:23,541
Out…go….

932
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,208
Sir, we will take care of it.

933
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:28,458
Stop all payments until I say.

934
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:29,333
Yes sir.

935
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,958
What are you doing brother?

936
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,125
Beat him with the trump card

937
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,291
Hey…don’t give away the game’

938
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:45,916
Any donkey knows to strike with the trump card.

939
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:48,000
Oh…this boy….

940
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,833
Hey get going…

941
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,000
Now I’ll give a strike.

942
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:54,041
Did you reply for the lawyer’s notice?

943
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:54,500
No

944
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,541
If you fail to reply for such things, the court  
will favor them with the custody of the child.

945
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,166
They will take him.

946
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,083
I won’t give him.

947
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:02,791
What did you say?

948
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:03,875
I won’t allow…

949
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:05,875
You won’t give?

950
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:09,333
If you don’t then the cops can take the kid.

951
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,458
However you do one thing,

952
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:15,750
Meet with Thekkakara Lawyer Anthony’, I’ll give him a call

953
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:17,291
Sure.

954
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:20,625
He is the best one to handle such muddles.

955
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,458
Ok?

956
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:23,625
Take your dad with you.

957
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:25,458
Hmm

958
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:42,583
It is said here ‘You are not financially secure and 
you are incapable of taking care of the child’

959
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,791
Sir, all these years I was the one took care of everything.

960
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,958
May be…I’m saying what is said in the paper.

961
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,541
Since the child is 7 yrs.’ Old,

962
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:55,583
...the court will consider the child’s interest.

963
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,166
He will only stay with me.

964
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,916
Give the case files.

965
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:15,250
When we tackled an advertisement for Oil Company, 
the entire place is squeezed with oil companies.

966
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,791
Oh…that’s just…like…when we purchase a swift car, 
then the road will be crammed with swift cars.

967
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:19,250
Is it?

968
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:22,125
Looks as a local set up?

969
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,875
Yeah… 
Seems like that.

970
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,333
Brother, where is the owner?

971
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:26,416
Owner is inside…

972
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:26,916
Inside?

973
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,416
Eyappan brother, two guys are here to meet you.

974
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,333
Get in…

975
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:31,916
Come on…

976
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:35,250
I’ll make the talk, you keep up an attitude.

977
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,208
You better don’t mess up with your talks.

978
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:53,041
Who are you guys?

979
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:53,666
Joseph..

980
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:54,208
Anson…

981
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:55,333
Eyappan

982
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,083
You have a hair oil product?

983
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,625
Kesha…Kesha.

984
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:00,875
You didn’t ask for a permission to name it?

985
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,000
What you said your name was?

986
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,541
Joseph

987
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,875
And you asked whom for permission?

988
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:06,291
That…my father named me.

989
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,916
…and this is named by my father.

990
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:10,708
My forefathers too did the same thing.

991
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:11,416
Got the picture?

992
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:12,375
That’s not all of it…brother

993
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,083
With same names multiple products are not allowed.

994
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:19,875
If more people have the same name… 
then add some moniker.

995
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,416
For example…we have 5-6 Jose here…

996
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:26,750
One is one hand Jose, nosy Jose, sword Jose,

997
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:31,125
Squirrel Jose and Puthanpally Jose….several names.

998
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:31,916
But this is…

999
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,125
Listen… what I say…

1000
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:35,750
Now this…Eyappan’s Kesha’

1001
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,541
…and yours will be Joseph’s Kesha, works out fine.

1002
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:43,250
Brother, these should be registered and trademarked…

1003
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,416
Oh dear boy…you know Gandhi?

1004
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:46,750
The one who gave our freedom…?

1005
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,250
Yes.

1006
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:50,083
There are several others with the name Gandhi.

1007
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:53,250
Do they all register their names from Gandhi?

1008
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,375
Go off man…

1009
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,416
Brother, the other company is moving further with the case.

1010
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:58,875
Vasumathi…?

1011
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:03,041
Case…

1012
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:06,833
You got any idea how many case  
were filed against her by my wife?

1013
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,041
Don’t try to scare me with the case’

1014
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:09,875
Why on earth is he speaking?

1015
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,625
Whatever it takes, make compromise.

1016
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,875
Oh…I’m about to die of fits.

1017
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,375
What was it about the case?

1018
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:27,458
Other company is proceeding with the case against you.

1019
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:28,208
Hmm

1020
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:31,250
Ok…what’s in it for you guys?

1021
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,375
We’re trying to help you…

1022
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,000
To save you from it.

1023
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,791
You’re here to save me.

1024
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:38,541
Yes.

1025
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:42,958
Guys…Kerala state was created on November 1st of 1956,

1026
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:50,458
From that very day we don’t have a history of one 
helping the other without an eye on the prize.

1027
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,958
Now cut to the chase…

1028
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:55,250
What are you trying to reap out of it?

1029
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,250
Both parties can have the yields

1030
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,250
Now we’re talking…

1031
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,083
Don’t bother with other things.

1032
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,208
Not you guys…Eyappan come inside.

1033
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:24,916
See Mr. Eyappan.

1034
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:25,416
Oh.

1035
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:30,208
Your oil company can try, but it’s a long shot  
and probably won’t survive with this set up.

1036
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:34,833
Even if you set it to float on the selling value,

1037
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:39,041
In thirty years, can’t expect a profit more than 20lakhs.

1038
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,291
I can give you 25 lakhs.

1039
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:44,333
Take it, stop your company,

1040
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,958
…and sign the documents stating  
you’ll never produce the oil again.

1041
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,291
Sir…no offence.

1042
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,250
There is someone a ‘Dheeru bhai Ambani’.

1043
01:02:53,625 --> 01:03:00,750
He was working in a petrol bunk, later he turned  
out to be the king of Petroleum industries.

1044
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,291
May be you know about his both children.

1045
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:09,583
So, one day my Kesha oil may change  
the world and pave my way to

1046
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:13,083
..be a billionaire. That’s my dream.

1047
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,541
I don’t want to put myself in a situation..where my children 
accuse me of making a stupid assumption by signing it.

1048
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,500
So to dodge that question I need more money.

1049
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,333
How about…about…

1050
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,583
Thirty can’t do…Shashi.

1051
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,583
Don’t keep mulling over…

1052
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:35,875
Can I say something?

1053
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,041
How about a 40?

1054
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,875
Make it a round figure…

1055
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:44,916
What’s with your thump…?

1056
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:45,541
Nothing.

1057
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:48,583
Use it…now it became a round figure.

1058
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,166
50?

1059
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:52,375
Sign it.

1060
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:55,583
Money?

1061
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,000
That is…ready.

1062
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:01,500
Check? No check can do.

1063
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,333
Even though my dream is to be another Ambani,

1064
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,750
I can’t handle white money.

1065
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,875
I’m more inclined to black humor.

1066
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:09,916
I mean black.

1067
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:10,791
That can be arranged, will do

1068
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:12,375
Impossible...we got only white.

1069
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:13,583
We can manage.

1070
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,458
Sign it…

1071
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:15,333
I can assure.

1072
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,083
Oh.

1073
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,791
How long for the cash?

1074
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:26,500
Soon…

1075
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,208
Will be here by the time of drinking a tea.

1076
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,166
How about a tea?

1077
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:30,875
No, coffee please.

1078
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,000
Ok.

1079
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:34,208
I’ll be outside.

1080
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,750
Talk the rest with the manager.

1081
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,375
I’ll follow…

1082
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:45,708
Oh, this exactly like a dialogue I said in the past.

1083
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:49,416
Am I the nut case here or they went crazy?

1084
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,791
Full amount as said. Ok?

1085
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:12,041
Wait…let them leave.

1086
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,375
Oh…bye.

1087
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,291
Drop me at the casino.

1088
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:22,250
Look how much a name can worth?

1089
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
50 lakhs.

1090
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:28,583
I have to find another name, no more Kesha.

1091
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,416
Kesha' won't work out..

1092
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,250
Now, comes our tag line.

1093
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:46,416
No other Kerala girl go under the same predicament

1094
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,166
For no hair fall use Kesha hair care oil.

1095
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:53,833
Good.

1096
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,250
Thank you very much sir,

1097
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:56,208
Ok then, I’ll take a leave.

1098
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,583
About the payments…

1099
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:00,458
France, teacher is here. Wipe that faster.

1100
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:04,833
Good morning.

1101
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,041
Good morning teacher.

1102
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,416
Sit down …sit down

1103
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,500
What is it, France?

1104
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:14,000
France wrote dirty words on the board.

1105
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:15,666
France, what is this?

1106
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:17,708
That was not a bad word

1107
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:18,125
Then?

1108
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,041
Write…show me...what did you write.

1109
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:29,541
How can you write a word when you’re clueless of alphabets?

1110
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:35,500
Which chapter?

1111
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,791
A smile.

1112
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:40,666
Is this the word France?

1113
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:45,666
Arranging a string of alphabets on the  
board cannot be called a word.

1114
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,750
Or is it a new word created by France.

1115
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:52,333
Granddad taught me.

1116
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,666
Granddad told you this?

1117
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:54,666
Pronounce the word?

1118
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,416
Floccinaucinihilipilification’

1119
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,541
You’re saying this is a word.

1120
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:14,208
Write it again, let me see if you remember  
the word granddad taught you.

1121
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:49,125
Teacher? France not only wrote the  
word but also made fun of teacher.

1122
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,166
It can wait.

1123
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,041
Ok!

1124
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,166
Granddad taught you this word, right?

1125
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:03,458
How to read it?

1126
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:07,625
‘floccinaucinihilipilification’

1127
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,875
Ok, ok…go sit

1128
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:12,083
We can learn ‘a smile’

1129
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:16,500
France had improved a lot.

1130
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,541
I never expected this.

1131
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:20,750
He is really smart now.

1132
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:27,958
Anyway there is spell c competition for students, on 15th

1133
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:33,458
Parents should take them,  
if you’re interested to make him participate…

1134
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:37,041
It’ll be good.

1135
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:38,791
You will win the cup?

1136
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:42,375
Dad, how about we call mom too for spell c competition.

1137
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,916
Let her call if she needs.

1138
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,625
Yes teacher.

1139
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:01,375
Why can’t you clear out your stuffs?

1140
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:05,375
We will…we will clear it soon.

1141
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,083
You know how many people reached me for the house?

1142
01:09:08,416 --> 01:09:11,333
I’ll say one last thing; two days… 
you should clear off everything.

1143
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,166
Teacher…I’ll…soon.

1144
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:17,666
Or else I’ll hurl out every single thing.

1145
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,125
Ok.

1146
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:32,708
I called you because…at this situation it’ll be better

1147
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,291
If the kid is taken care by his mother. 
I’m not interested…

1148
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:40,625
Their lawyer is someone who will drag  
out three four cases from a single case.

1149
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:42,875
Is it because of a scare of losing?

1150
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,208
You had already read…How much trumped  
up story about you is written in the petition.

1151
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:49,708
Same way we will be forced to make-up stories.

1152
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:53,291
Your kid will be prone to learn all these stories.

1153
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:58,333
He will not able to trust you or your wife,

1154
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:01,541
…because I’ll be writing about your wife.

1155
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,666
Like insulting her...Understand?

1156
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:10,875
So for the better future of the kid,  
leave the kid with his mother.

1157
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,500
When you’re financially stable,  
take the kid with you.

1158
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,958
There will be more changes in the atmosphere.

1159
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:24,583
Take a seat.

1160
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:29,958
The show is full on’

1161
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,375
Perfect ad and great sale.

1162
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,333
The kids played well.

1163
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:39,541
Kids know the play but no ground.

1164
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:44,000
The kids scored well, but the ground was on my chest.

1165
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,583
Jose brother, what did you get out of this game?

1166
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,416
Come on…say it.

1167
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,333
I didn’t catch on to’

1168
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,750
There is no such Eyappan and no oil company.

1169
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,416
Kids pulled a clean conning,

1170
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:03,583
As it is cash deal, I can’t make a move legally.

1171
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:05,583
No problem…

1172
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:07,875
I can settle the scores well.

1173
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:10,416
Jose brother can go.

1174
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:14,666
Leave…

1175
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:25,041
Jose brother?

1176
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,458
If you got more pests like this…toss it to me.

1177
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,250
Ground is ready.

1178
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:38,708
Jose brother…take a seat.

1179
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:42,375
You better don’t make me sit.  
I was sitting in the dark for a long time.

1180
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,458
I’m no perfect even at this age,

1181
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:47,000
But I never gave a reason to tarnish my name.

1182
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,666
What happened?

1183
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:50,375
You don’t know anything?

1184
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:51,833
What did you think?

1185
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:53,166
…that you can feed on cheating.

1186
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:54,208
Jose brother?

1187
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:55,041
No!

1188
01:11:55,458 --> 01:12:00,791
I want to watch, how you gonna live  
peacefully in Trissur with the 50lakhs.

1189
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:04,291
Son, come here.

1190
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,583
Usually mother teaches the kids to become like their father,

1191
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:14,333
But you should never learn from him.

1192
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:20,041
He is a thief who builds a sumptuous life cheating others.

1193
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,625
If you learn from your father,

1194
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,625
One day you too will turn out to be a thief like him.

1195
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:28,625
Don’t say…

1196
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:29,583
Jose brother…

1197
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:52,625
Hello

1198
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:53,750
Hey, where are you?

1199
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,583
Hello, Anson.

1200
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,375
I was about to call you.

1201
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,958
No one will be aware of it.

1202
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,541
We both can benefit.

1203
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:03,541
Trust me.

1204
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:06,708
Fine, you send your account details

1205
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:07,541
I’ll transfer the amount.

1206
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:08,958
I don’t want that cash.

1207
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,250
Hello…hello Ansa…HELLO

1208
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:15,750
Hi sir…

1209
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,333
Check out.

1210
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:25,625
Hey…can we go to mom’s house.

1211
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,583
You can go to school from there.

1212
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,708
Any way you don’t have football coaching for now.

1213
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:42,541
Your mom can give more attention to your studies.

1214
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:52,166
You can come back after dad settles the business issues.

1215
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:52,916
hmm

1216
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:54,166
Got it?

1217
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,000
How about a game?

1218
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,833
His nonsense cards

1219
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:29,208
Sea is you,

1220
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:32,291
My bosom companion..

1221
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:34,250
Anson…Anson….

1222
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:37,833
Anson…please...don’t take him…

1223
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,208
You’re my world..

1224
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:41,708
France…

1225
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:44,791
Heart is you,

1226
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:46,666
Lay the cards dad…

1227
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:51,000
Always my, Life.

1228
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,166
Sea is you,

1229
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:57,250
My bosom companion..

1230
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,333
You’re day,

1231
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:03,458
Tagging along my shadow.

1232
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,500
You’re my world

1233
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,541
Heart is you,

1234
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:15,666
Always my, Life.

1235
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,208
Is Anson here?

1236
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:23,208
He is inside.

1237
01:15:23,416 --> 01:15:24,166
Anson…?

1238
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:25,958
Anson…?

1239
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:31,416
Anson…?

1240
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:31,958
Hmm

1241
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:37,708
You should come to the station.

1242
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,333
Why? What is the matter, sir?

1243
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:40,750
Officer will say what it is?

1244
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,000
Dad, I’ll be back.

1245
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:09,500
Come on…move.

1246
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,458
Anson Laser.

1247
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,541
We can take a tour later, sit now.

1248
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:31,541
Anson may be thinking… 
the purpose of this unofficial setting.

1249
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:38,500
You guys did a deal of 50 lakhs with Kochu Lona.

1250
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:45,541
So Anson…sign it here that you received that amount,

1251
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:47,416
..then you are free to go.

1252
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:50,833
Sir actually my partner took the cash.

1253
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,208
I got no further involvement with that deal.

1254
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,416
What can I say….?

1255
01:16:58,125 --> 01:16:59,791
He’s been missing for a few days.

1256
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,208
I’m trying to contact him.

1257
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:07,833
Anson…I’m none like the usual cop you have thought of.

1258
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:11,833
I’m not interested in violence.

1259
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:18,041
But these brothers are nothing like me… 
they’re into exceptional violence.

1260
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,750
So, please cooperate with us.

1261
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:24,750
I don’t have any part in that.

1262
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:26,625
I have no idea where is he?

1263
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,666
Why is he parroting?

1264
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:32,625
If Anson cannot understand what I say…

1265
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:36,666
I think there language can make more sense to you.

1266
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:37,625
Sir..

1267
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:46,916
Hey man, look over there…

1268
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:48,333
Don’t put your eyes here make my stomach sick.

1269
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:02,083
I asked to make him sign not knock him dead.

1270
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:05,458
Ridiculous…

1271
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:08,541
Button up…you look better.

1272
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,125
Now spill the truth to uncle.

1273
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:14,916
I didn’t take any money, please save me.

1274
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,291
Save you?

1275
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,416
It’s kind of a sticky situation,

1276
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:24,500
I had to save you, save Kochu Lona.

1277
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:28,708
You do one thing, give me 20 lakhs.

1278
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:31,541
…and save me, it sounds like a solid plan.

1279
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:31,958
Sir..

1280
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,416
Another thing…

1281
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:39,208
When I meet you tomorrow, make sure it is signed…

1282
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:45,291
If not…this action program will be replaced by another…

1283
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:47,291
…set of performance by me.

1284
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:48,250
Sir…i…

1285
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,416
I’m leaving…keep an eye.

1286
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,625
Granddad…granddad…

1287
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:25,375
Hmm?

1288
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,583
Where is dad?

1289
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:29,375
He is over there…somewhere…

1290
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:28,916
Anson…

1291
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:34,375
In my opinion…there is only one option left.

1292
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,708
You better Scoot’

1293
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,708
Understand?

1294
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,125
Wait out till you figure out ‘

1295
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:44,166
Hey..

1296
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:50,041
If money can settle your issue, we can meet Biju.

1297
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,333
What are you saying, Vineeth?

1298
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:06,041
Our business is murky for now, after GST, 
No one keeps liquid cash in the office.

1299
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:08,916
Cash deals are off’

1300
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:14,583
Please give it a try? We got no other choice.

1301
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:16,583
How much?

1302
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:18,625
20 lakhs.

1303
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:21,166
What…20 lakhs? What???

1304
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:27,583
Do one thing.

1305
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:33,333
There is another way…

1306
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:34,791
Hmm

1307
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:41,666
Actually a 5cr had arrived. 5 crores.

1308
01:22:45,791 --> 01:22:47,500
But I can’t get involved…

1309
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:49,416
I’ll give the number.

1310
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:51,208
Hold it for a few days…

1311
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:55,333
Then you can take your 20 lakhs from it.

1312
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:56,166
Ok?

1313
01:22:57,416 --> 01:23:00,166
Pay 2 or 3lac of it as interest.

1314
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:00,791
Hmm?

1315
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,958
I’ll…

1316
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:05,458
I’ll give vineeth’s number

1317
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,083
Will call on that.

1318
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,708
Can I think and let you know?

1319
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:15,125
Sure…I’ll ring Vineeth.

1320
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,666
Your number will be given to them.

1321
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:18,041
Okay

1322
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:19,875
Okay

1323
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:40,541
Dad? You were sitting here?

1324
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,541
Dad…, where was you yesterday?

1325
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,541
Ernakulam

1326
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,416
Meeting with few clients.

1327
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:50,916
Bring me my phone.

1328
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:51,666
Hmm..

1329
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:07,875
What?

1330
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:09,416
Hey it’s bed time,

1331
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:10,041
Hmm..

1332
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,083
Go on…sleep.

1333
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,000
Say prayer before…

1334
01:24:13,291 --> 01:24:13,625
Hmm

1335
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:22,333
I had given your number to the guy.

1336
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:24,166
He will call you…

1337
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,625
It’s…raini…,

1338
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,708
‘it’s raining’ is the code’

1339
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,375
Hmm

1340
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:36,458
No matter what don’t call Biju.

1341
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:37,208
Ok?

1342
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:39,375
So you’ll deal it accordingly?

1343
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,166
Hmm

1344
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:47,458
(reciting a tamil tune)

1345
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:48,875
What happened?

1346
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:49,375
Hey

1347
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:50,208
I need something

1348
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:50,625
Huh?

1349
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:52,875
8pm today some cash will be arriving.

1350
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:54,125
You take the car?

1351
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,000
Car?

1352
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,375
Hmm

1353
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:56,958
I’ll ride the bike…give the place.

1354
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:57,833
Actually it is 5’

1355
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:59,750
5 it is? No problem, I can bring it in bike.

1356
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:00,375
Where is it?

1357
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:01,708
5 crores

1358
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:02,375
How much?

1359
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:03,166
5crores

1360
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,333
5 crores?

1361
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:10,458
Hmm

1362
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:11,833
Why can’t you go then?

1363
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,250
They asked as to hold the money in office.

1364
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,583
I need to take dad and kid to somewhere else.

1365
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:18,416
What’s with this huge amount?

1366
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:19,291
I’ll explain it later.

1367
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:20,125
I’m out…

1368
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:22,250
I’m going.

1369
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:43,541
I’ll go…

1370
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,875
Got here?

1371
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:55,250
I was about it dump all stuffs into the fire.

1372
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,541
Teacher, I can pay back all the money in two weeks

1373
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:00,541
I had to go out of town for a business.

1374
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:05,166
Can you allow them to stay here for a few days?

1375
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:10,041
No one will set foot in my house without paying the rent.

1376
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:12,125
I’ll settle everything after i…

1377
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,541
Can you please leave?

1378
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:15,958
Disturbing at the dead of night’

1379
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:35,583
Thank you so much.

1380
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:37,958
Not this one.

1381
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:44,750
What about school?

1382
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,833
You can go after few days.

1383
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:48,375
What’s there to do in school?

1384
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:54,250
Thieves got our car.

1385
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:04,416
It’s taken to the garage for engine service.

1386
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:06,333
Where?

1387
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,125
Vineeth’s garage’

1388
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,083
Yes, brother.

1389
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,500
Cops towed your car.

1390
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:30,958
If something is assigned to you why the… 
why do you shove it on someone else.

1391
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:33,208
Did you mention Biju’s name?

1392
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:35,875
No there was no such talks.

1393
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:38,458
Will he spill everything after a few punches?

1394
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:40,625
No brother, he won’t talk.

1395
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:45,333
Remember that you can be bailed  
out only if there is someone outside.

1396
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,458
Brother…bro….

1397
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:52,500
What is it? What happened?

1398
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:57,500
Dad…didn’t I mention about the client meeting,

1399
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:00,208
For...two weeks.

1400
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:05,291
I was thinking about dad and his stay, a place?

1401
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,041
We’ll stay at the office.

1402
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,666
Why don’t you go?

1403
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:31,833
hello

1404
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:34,208
You should have done the job fixed for you.

1405
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:36,333
Why did you ask for someone else?

1406
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:37,125
Huh?

1407
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,625
Better scoot fast

1408
01:28:38,666 --> 01:28:39,291
Ok Brother

1409
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:42,083
Don’t drag around Trissur.

1410
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:42,958
Ok?

1411
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,500
Keep a low profile.

1412
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:49,625
Don’t let the cops get you. 
And then don’t call to this phone.

1413
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:56,583
Jhommy?

1414
01:28:56,583 --> 01:29:01,666
I’ll call…I’m at station, police station.

1415
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:03,541
Brother?

1416
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:05,625
I’m taking the register.

1417
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,750
Brother…we…

1418
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:10,666
Three of us…here

1419
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:11,583
Did you Book?

1420
01:30:11,583 --> 01:30:12,750
No…

1421
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,166
That’s not possible.

1422
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:18,250
Booking is already closed, two months ago. 
Only those booked can attend the retreat.

1423
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,541
We had travelled a long distance.

1424
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:22,333
Distance is not matter.

1425
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,333
We don’t have the facility to accommodate more people.

1426
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:28,125
You know the rules, how it is done.

1427
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:29,625
We…night…

1428
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:32,416
That’s why…sorry, please no offence.

1429
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:34,375
Brothers and sisters,

1430
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:38,458
We’re have come together in name of God in this evening’

1431
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,750
We can pray for the God’s grace.

1432
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:45,208
Pray together…

1433
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,625
Jesus…

1434
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,916
Praise the lord’

1435
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:59,250
Oh brother, you just left me in a pickle.

1436
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:00,750
You’re safe, right?

1437
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,291
Safe? Really?

1438
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:07,291
Your Dumbo screw up car broke down in the midst of city.

1439
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:09,625
What about the cash?

1440
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:11,416
I couldn’t collect it.

1441
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:16,041
After the car conked out, I got slammed  
by the people, the entire city in block.

1442
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,708
At last the cops got me and they took the car too.

1443
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:21,541
Ouch!

1444
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,916
Any I’ll come there.

1445
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:23,916
OK?

1446
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:24,625
Ok, come…

1447
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:29,583
Dad?

1448
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:30,875
We can head out.

1449
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:31,500
Hey…

1450
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:34,000
Father is calling…

1451
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,333
Just a minute..

1452
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:46,208
Praise to the Lord

1453
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:49,375
You came here with a heart to join the retreat, so you  
should.

1454
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:51,916
You’re in need of it.

1455
01:31:52,208 --> 01:31:54,458
No, father…we couldn’t register.

1456
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:58,125
No…no…you come inside.’

1457
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:05,750
I’m so happy to be here.

1458
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:18,333
‘How deep your thirst goes, in its depth God  
will shower you with the water of existence’

1459
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:02,416
hello

1460
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:05,208
how long I have been trying to reach you’

1461
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:07,416
Where were you yesterday?

1462
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,041
Car trouble.

1463
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:11,666
Ok, fine.

1464
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:15,250
Today at dawn,  
Down pour in Poonkunnam Bridge.

1465
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:15,833
Ok?

1466
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:19,083
Sir they’re having some loose talks about rain?

1467
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:19,666
Rain?

1468
01:33:19,666 --> 01:33:20,291
Yes

1469
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:21,291
Listen please.

1470
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:27,666
Today at dawn 3:00am, down pour in Poonkunnam bridge.

1471
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:57,458
Ramesh…

1472
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,208
Bring it…faster…

1473
01:33:59,208 --> 01:33:59,958
Bring the barrels…

1474
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:01,166
Stop…stop… 
Vehicles cannot pass by.

1475
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:02,125
What happened?

1476
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:03,625
Not this way, the bridge had collapsed.

1477
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:04,166
What is it?

1478
01:34:04,166 --> 01:34:05,875
Brother, I got an emergency.

1479
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,250
Didn’t I say…no vehicles can go

1480
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,375
There will be some shot cuts…

1481
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:09,291
No…no…turn back

1482
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:10,541
Brother…I have to go somewhere very important.

1483
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:12,125
Couldn’t get your head around?

1484
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:18,125
Ok…tug it..

1485
01:34:18,666 --> 01:34:19,333
Move it!

1486
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:42,333
Dad? Where did you go?

1487
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:44,125
Enjoying the rain outside.

1488
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:46,791
Then why did you change the dress?

1489
01:34:50,791 --> 01:34:55,291
#i was dependent on God’s grace

1490
01:34:55,291 --> 01:34:59,208
Came to know his will

1491
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:07,166
To Follow his steps

1492
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:11,041
#i was dependent on God’s grace

1493
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:13,125
Hallelujah…hallelujah….#

1494
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:14,625
Hallelujah….hallelujah….hallelujah…

1495
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:16,916
We got some news…

1496
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:19,416
Because of the heavy rain, there were

1497
01:35:19,416 --> 01:35:22,333
Several landslides at the dell.

1498
01:35:22,333 --> 01:35:25,166
Brothers who were supposed to arrive for the classes and

1499
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:30,166
Those for the health care, couldn’t reach.

1500
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:32,416
Whole place is having rainfall

1501
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:36,833
We should pray more, seek to God

1502
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:51,291
France.

1503
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:54,000
France…?

1504
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:55,833
Hey..?

1505
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,916
Dad, come here…

1506
01:35:57,916 --> 01:35:59,083
It’s a fantastic place…

1507
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:01,208
We can sit together with grandpa

1508
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:17,541
Dad?

1509
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:18,583
Hmm?

1510
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,166
This pond…

1511
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:25,375
In the pond I and mom got trapped.

1512
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:26,958
Then?

1513
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:33,916
Then dad came as a super hero, saved me 
But not mom.

1514
01:36:34,208 --> 01:36:36,416
Dad, why didn’t you save mom?

1515
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:43,416
It was your dream’ what can I do?

1516
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:54,083
Dad…can we be in the rain? Please…

1517
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:56,041
In the rain?

1518
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:57,166
Hmm..

1519
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:02,666
Give the plate; keep it on top of this plate.

1520
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:08,666
Dear…

1521
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:12,000
Sometime human life is like this…

1522
01:37:12,416 --> 01:37:15,666
Loneliness, pain fills through our travel

1523
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:20,333
We’re not aware of the destination of this journey

1524
01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:26,250
Sometimes our lives will have sleepless  
tearful nights along its path.

1525
01:37:27,125 --> 01:37:30,958
A look into the life history of St. Thomas’

1526
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:36,291
Clearly states, in the chest of Jesus…in his body

1527
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:41,541
Stabbed to wound, i won’t believe until the side can be  
touched,

1528
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:44,500
Said by the St. Thomas.

1529
01:37:45,375 --> 01:37:48,833
Jesus resurrected in the third day said,

1530
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:50,833
“Thomas, come here

1531
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:53,833
Here…you can touch my side.

1532
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,125
Dad…

1533
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:59,166
I still got the scar from the stitch.

1534
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:00,708
Hmm

1535
01:38:01,791 --> 01:38:02,791
They will fade.

1536
01:38:10,375 --> 01:38:13,416
Dad…I got a goal in my life.

1537
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:14,125
What is it?

1538
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:16,583
I want to be like ‘JESUS CHRIST’

1539
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:19,208
So that everyone can thrash you to death.

1540
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:21,958
Again with the negativity.

1541
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:25,041
Granddad is naysayer’

1542
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:27,250
N-A-Y

1543
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:29,291
S-A-Y-E-R

1544
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:31,333
Naysayer

1545
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:49,500
##Like the shore seeks the swell,

1546
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:55,583
What are we questing along?

1547
01:38:55,583 --> 01:39:00,458
Like a saga coined by some one

1548
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:06,583
We’re going as the seethe sweeps.

1549
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:12,000
During the walks of distance

1550
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,291
We draw together##

1551
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:15,375
“Two teas please…”

1552
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:21,708
As days running out.

1553
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:27,625
Where are you guys, now?

1554
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:29,333
Went for a retreat.

1555
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:31,166
So where are you staying at?

1556
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,458
At the office?

1557
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:34,458
Living in the office?

1558
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:36,416
Why don’t you do one thing, come here

1559
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:38,708
Don’t worry about the rent for now.

1560
01:39:38,708 --> 01:39:41,166
Will do, teacher…ok, then.

1561
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:13,208
Who is this grandma?

1562
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:17,291
You are?

1563
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:29,333
Jose brother…

1564
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:31,250
Huh?

1565
01:40:32,541 --> 01:40:36,083
We were not here, was at a retreat for few days.

1566
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:38,583
Peringavu’, whole place is flooded.

1567
01:40:38,583 --> 01:40:40,250
Houses swamped with water..

1568
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,708
Many lost their house…

1569
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:45,333
I didn’t have another place to turn in…

1570
01:40:45,333 --> 01:40:46,666
No trouble at all.

1571
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,541
You saw an old woman in the other room?

1572
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:51,833
Who is she?

1573
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:56,708
She is the one who won’t give me  
..the 10 cent Puzhakkal property, my mother!

1574
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,458
Huh.

1575
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:03,083
Our ground fully immersed in water, TV too lost.

1576
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:05,666
I had told him to keep it upstairs, he didn’t.

1577
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:09,208
Food was at refugee camp.

1578
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:12,750
Today morning as she got up, she said…

1579
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,125
Every morning I take Goat milk’, so I need 1 glass.

1580
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:19,333
Goats are floating away in water…

1581
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:22,916
How can I ask them… 
’wait can you give 1 glass of milk and drift away?’

1582
01:41:23,416 --> 01:41:24,666
Huh and now…

1583
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:31,791
Even if she promise me the 10 cent property

1584
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:33,666
I don’t want it…now….

1585
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:38,875
She can give me after the water streamed off completely.

1586
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:39,958
Enough?

1587
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,416
Where will I get some goat milk?

1588
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:48,000
Mother can you get adjusted with some mutton’ instead?

1589
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:50,625
I’ll get the lunch.

1590
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:51,708
Huh????

1591
01:41:52,583 --> 01:41:55,416
I’ll….get …the…LUNCH.

1592
01:41:56,458 --> 01:42:00,125
I won’t give you the Puzhakkal property’

1593
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:01,000
You won’t?

1594
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:04,916
My mother, dig a ditch in that place and jump in… 
Dad…let’s go?

1595
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:14,791
##once cast around for a crescent

1596
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:20,208
Lay the burning stars in darkness

1597
01:42:20,791 --> 01:42:22,000
Well, do you recognize me?

1598
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,958
Carpenter Thankappan’s sister?

1599
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:25,750
Yes…yes.

1600
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,166
Take this…

1601
01:42:26,166 --> 01:42:27,083
What is it?

1602
01:42:27,083 --> 01:42:28,833
Its ok, I don’t…

1603
01:42:28,833 --> 01:42:31,750
Please eat well…

1604
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:37,250
A beam blooming for the season to rise’

1605
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:42,500
We’re pulsing here along…’

1606
01:42:43,916 --> 01:42:44,791
You need something?

1607
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:45,833
Curry is not that tasty…

1608
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:48,583
Any how this is not your wife house, eat if you want it.

1609
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:52,583
However it is still good that something like this occurred,

1610
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:57,125
Many were missing; I thought that’s it…dead.

1611
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:01,458
But eventually when I reached  
here I understood they’re alive.

1612
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:17,333
##like the shore seeks the swell,

1613
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:17,958
France..?

1614
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,083
Dad, I’m coming.

1615
01:43:19,083 --> 01:43:20,250
Come on…let’s go.

1616
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:25,666
What are we questing along?

1617
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:31,125
Like a story coined by some one

1618
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:37,208
We’re going as the seethe sweeps’

1619
01:44:04,541 --> 01:44:10,000
During the walks through distances

1620
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,166
We draw together

1621
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:19,791
As days running out.

1622
01:44:21,375 --> 01:44:24,583
Kids…call me when you guys finish.

1623
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:25,166
Sure…

1624
01:44:25,166 --> 01:44:25,708
Ok, then…

1625
01:44:32,416 --> 01:44:33,500
You all got the whole work?

1626
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,208
Ha…Jo brother.

1627
01:44:37,333 --> 01:44:40,458
When the water started to move further in,  
the evacuation team gave the call…

1628
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:41,666
Like always she didn’t hear.

1629
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:44,708
Only if someone calls her teacher’ it can get through her  
ear.

1630
01:44:45,166 --> 01:44:47,375
The one tree she always asked to cut it down?

1631
01:44:47,375 --> 01:44:49,750
The tree saved her. She was struck on it…hanging.

1632
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,708
On the other she would have been drowned away in water.

1633
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:53,375
Can you please move to side?

1634
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,083
Arrogant woman

1635
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,750
Be careful, look out for snakes or something…

1636
01:44:56,958 --> 01:45:00,291
Keep in mind, not because of love… 
She asked you guys to stay here.

1637
01:45:00,916 --> 01:45:02,333
But to clean up this mess.

1638
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:04,833
After that she will throw you out..

1639
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:06,250
That old hag…

1640
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:12,083
Now she can hear if someone gives a voice.

1641
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:14,750
You don’t believe?

1642
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:15,791
See…

1643
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:17,708
Oy…oy…?

1644
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:20,750
Yes Joy?

1645
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:22,041
Just nothing…

1646
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,541
I called for you to call you Teacher’

1647
01:45:24,541 --> 01:45:26,375
You finished cleaning?

1648
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:27,125
Oh, yes…

1649
01:45:27,125 --> 01:45:27,791
Ok Joy.

1650
01:45:28,416 --> 01:45:29,125
Bye teacher…

1651
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:34,416
You know the third rule to success?

1652
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:36,291
No

1653
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:37,208
Hard work’

1654
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:38,833
Take this.

1655
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:41,791
Shove out…

1656
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:46,125
Zeena…dear, I want to meet you all so much, missed a lot 
When will you come back from America?

1657
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:47,666
Granddad…move a little.

1658
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:54,750
No:401

1659
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:57,166
‘CELEBRATE’

1660
01:46:00,125 --> 01:46:07,458
C-E-L-E-B-R-A-T-E

1661
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:08,458
Correct.

1662
01:46:11,833 --> 01:46:13,833
No:268

1663
01:46:18,041 --> 01:46:18,875
ENORMOUS’

1664
01:46:19,541 --> 01:46:20,375
ENORMOUS’

1665
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:21,291
E-

1666
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,500
SCARE CROW’

1667
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:29,708
S-C-U-C-R-O-W

1668
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:32,500
Your word is PIRATE’

1669
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:34,375
Uh…

1670
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:45,541
E-A-L

1671
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:47,333
That’s Incorrect.

1672
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:56,875
Now we’re going to the next round.

1673
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:57,291
Sir?

1674
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,625
You’re alive?

1675
01:47:00,125 --> 01:47:01,916
I had sent a location to you.

1676
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:04,791
You’ll come there or I have to send guys to pull you out.

1677
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:06,416
No sir, I’ll be there.

1678
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:11,208
Diana…I need to go outside..

1679
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:17,125
B-O-Q-U-E-T

1680
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:45,250
HA, Partner made it…

1681
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:50,625
The great partner in crime.

1682
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:56,625
Anson Laser’

1683
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:02,250
When the school kids get mischievous,

1684
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:04,375
Teachers will get them…

1685
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,333
Soon the kids will confuse teacher.

1686
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:09,916
One will say ‘other did it’

1687
01:48:10,041 --> 01:48:11,583
The other will accuse back ‘he did it’

1688
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:13,625
The poor teacher go into total confusion’

1689
01:48:14,166 --> 01:48:15,958
She will think ‘who should get the punishment?’

1690
01:48:17,125 --> 01:48:18,708
Then two of them get free.

1691
01:48:19,375 --> 01:48:20,250
But it’s that teacher

1692
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:22,625
This teacher is not like that

1693
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:23,916
This teacher will strike both of them.

1694
01:48:24,291 --> 01:48:25,583
But the need never came up.

1695
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:28,416
After the first bunch of punches,

1696
01:48:28,416 --> 01:48:29,583
He blurts the truth.

1697
01:48:31,416 --> 01:48:33,916
When you get a partner, you should watch it better

1698
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Not only the profit but the loss too  
will hit hard on the partner’s chest.

1699
01:48:40,666 --> 01:48:42,208
For what I’m yakking to you?

1700
01:48:43,166 --> 01:48:44,583
Are you his partner?

1701
01:48:46,416 --> 01:48:47,791
You can meet his partner.

1702
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:51,166
Hey…scoop up his partner’

1703
01:48:58,208 --> 01:48:58,916
Thank you..

1704
01:48:58,916 --> 01:48:59,833
Have a nice day, sir.

1705
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:11,250
Shashi Brother, Anson called me.

1706
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:12,958
Seriously doubts if Kochu Lona found out.

1707
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:13,958
You don’t have to worry about that.

1708
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:15,625
You enjoy your journey well.

1709
01:49:15,625 --> 01:49:16,208
We can do the talk after you’re back.

1710
01:49:16,208 --> 01:49:17,708
My confidence is only because you stand with me.

1711
01:49:18,708 --> 01:49:19,666
No trouble.

1712
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,958
Look man, this is the worst partner.

1713
01:49:29,833 --> 01:49:31,791
You ‘Vadakedath Shashidar!

1714
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:36,500
Do you know ‘Kelam Parambil Ulahannan’s son Varghese?

1715
01:49:36,833 --> 01:49:37,166
No.

1716
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:38,791
My father.

1717
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:42,500
Whatever he created was never worthless,

1718
01:49:42,791 --> 01:49:44,041
…including me.

1719
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:53,333
This scum bag’ played with my money

1720
01:49:54,833 --> 01:49:56,958
But he gambled with your life’

1721
01:49:59,041 --> 01:49:59,750
Come on…

1722
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:18,791
Your car was taken under my order.

1723
01:50:19,166 --> 01:50:21,666
Got wrecked in the flood.

1724
01:50:22,666 --> 01:50:25,666
Not a problem, the engine was already a lost case.

1725
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:29,166
I booked a new car for you,

1726
01:50:29,541 --> 01:50:30,833
You should collect.

1727
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:48,041
Hey…how much you get paid?

1728
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:49,458
Rs 1000 or 2000

1729
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:51,833
I can arrange a better set up for you.

1730
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,875
We can deal.

1731
01:50:59,125 --> 01:51:01,458
No:401

1732
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:11,291

1733
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:15,625
We will declare you as the 2018 Spell C winner’

1734
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,083
Your word is SURVEILLANCE

1735
01:51:25,041 --> 01:51:28,041
S-U-R….

1736
01:51:31,625 --> 01:51:47,250
S-U-R-V-E-I-L-L-A-N-C-E

1737
01:51:53,666 --> 01:51:55,291
That’s the correct answer.

1738
01:52:18,791 --> 01:52:21,375
Where did you get the inspiration from to learn English  
words?

1739
01:52:22,083 --> 01:52:24,750
I learned English to make my mom return.

1740
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:33,416
My dad created a card game for me, I learned from it.

1741
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:38,291
Sir, Namaste…

1742
01:52:40,041 --> 01:52:42,416
This game will be launched soon.

1743
01:52:42,833 --> 01:52:44,583
It’s called as IU’ Card game.

1744
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:04,291
Clear sky spouting as the sun shines,

1745
01:53:04,583 --> 01:53:08,958
Departing rain offshoot, painted by breeze.

1746
01:53:09,666 --> 01:53:14,541
Dreams keep coming back

1747
01:53:14,541 --> 01:53:19,666
Down the ray of sun.

1748
01:53:19,666 --> 01:53:29,500
Come back to me….as clouds

1749
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:37,916
Come back again….drops of mizzle.

1750
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:04,625
Mind gliding like the paper boat.

1751
01:54:04,625 --> 01:54:09,416
Way above the waves!

1752
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:14,208
Warmer honest world awaits you.

1753
01:54:14,208 --> 01:54:18,791
Without bounds live as one.

1754
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:28,583
Rush to farewell…stroked mind, many

1755
01:54:29,833 --> 01:54:35,583
No more replies ….to give voice

1756
01:54:39,375 --> 01:54:47,791
Seasons turning….days rolling in

1757
01:54:47,791 --> 01:54:55,291
Dreams rose sparkling….

1758
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:04,583
Mind gliding like the paper boat.

1759
01:55:04,583 --> 01:55:09,375
Way above the waves!

1760
01:55:28,625 --> 01:55:38,458
Come back to me….as clouds

1761
01:55:38,458 --> 01:55:46,875
Come back again….drops of mizzle.
