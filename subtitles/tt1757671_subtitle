what nonsense is this?

191
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,350
this anger was there when he came here.

192
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,552
wretch. when you came here,
l told you to live peacefully.

193

l have told you several times
that don`t disturb my boys.

204
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,397
this is not your mattanchery market.

205
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,628
lots of people are here to
finish you inside this.

206
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,972
there might be hundreds of people
there to kill me inside this.

207
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,437
don`t threaten me by saying that.

208
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,477
l also have at least five people
here who`d die for me.

00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,578

210

hand him over to us, sir.
we will handle him.

215
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,024
they should strike him on
the head with a hammer.

216
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,492
wretch.

217
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:40,094
people your age will do
any nonsense for money.

218
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,934
y oungsters should at least
have some goals in life.

219
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:45,834
but there`s nothing.

220
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,675
for whom did you carry
that `hawala` money?

221
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,685
l have promised them in the name of
god that l won`t say anything.

222
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:04,460
even if the court hangs me,
l won`t say it.

223
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,033
will that `hawala` dealer
take you out on bail?

224
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,229
no. l don`t have any expectation.

225
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,807
then you can live here happily.

226
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,803

they are siding with the
people who hit you.

233
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,566
lf they get an opportunity,
they will harm our own people.

234
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,241
all policemen are not hindus.

235
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,011
lt`s like how all muslims are terrorists.

236
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,583
are all muslims terrorists?

237
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,013

we carried out the case.
but nothing happened.

251
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,276

after that l went to mumbai.
from there to dubai.

00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,265
not treat. firing.
- oh!

351
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,544
no point roaming around in kochi.

352
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,779
hey, what`s up?
what are you thinking?

353
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,548
the bail application of babu sait and
his people have moved in the court.

354
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,318
lf the situation is like this,
they will come out absolutely free.

355
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:07,156
we can`t do anything.
- what to do?

356
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,127
they are living in a democratic country.

357
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,129
anyone can get bail anytime.

358
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,532
and moreover,
what do you know about him?

359
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,502
no clues. no evidence.
lt`s all incoherent.

360
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,505
sir, when people like babu sait
live freely outside.

361
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,473
lots of innocent people live inside.

362
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,079
otherwise, anyway everyone is
scared of touching high flying people.

363
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,078
big or small.

364
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,420
lt`s the law of nature.

365
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,418
we will get him.

366
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,751
cheer up, man.

367
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,868
hey. look, nokia.
- ls looking enough?

368
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,332
this is enough.
- okay.

369
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,872
hello.
- asharaf. hail allah.

370
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,136
same to you.

371
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,211
what is going on there?
- what, brother?

372
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,248
what is going on there?
- that`s the pig`s gang.

373
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,783
oh! they`ve started creating
problems again?

374
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:08,515
y ou are not here, that`s why that pig
shaji`s people are enjoying here.

375
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:12,388
ls anwar there?
- y es. he is sitting here.

376
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,961
give the phone to him.
- okay.

377
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,298
babu. babu.

378
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,561
greetings.
- greetings.

379
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:23,966
how`s your life there?

380
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,141
everything is okay, brother.

381
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,338
what is the matter?

382
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:30,069
there are some people creating problems.

383
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,544
lt`s that gang of pork shaji
who is in saudi.

384
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,641
they are dealing with drugs and all.

385
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,421
we might get bail next week.

386
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,988
l will solve that after coming there.
- ls it necessary to wait till then?

387
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,988
don`t be in a hurry.

388
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:07,039
ce

389
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,759
who is shaji?

390
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,176
what brother? what is the matter?

391
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,901
l will say that to shaji.

392
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,283
will you surely say that to shaji?

393
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,190
y es.

394
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:31,094
then you tell, my son. l am shaji.

395
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:01,143
y ou should leave this place with
your pork group immediately.

396
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:05,009
lf l see any of them here.

397
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,977
then you won`t even find
their dead bodies.

398
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:24,857
ce

399
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,845
greetings.
- greetings.

400
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,711
did his people leave the hospital?

401
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:49,119
no. lt takes time.
one person is very serious.

402
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,060
allah!

403
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,306
why are you standing there? come.

404
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:05,641
who is that, dear?

405
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,707
oh! mother, it`s he who was in jail.

406
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:11,439
what happened?
are the people who serve prison term bad?

407
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,479
nehru and gandhi were
also in jail.

408
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,446
those people went to jail
for the country.

409
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,244
and not by doing something
that went against the country.

410
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,048
allah! when will the police arrest
me and my mother?

411
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:25,193
what? are you shouting
without welcoming me?

412
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,990
women rule in valiyaveethil mohammed haji`s
house only when men won`t be alive.

413
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,666
hello, my dear son babu.
when did you come?

414
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,437
mother. are you fine, mother?
- y es, my son.

415
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,607
son, you are looking so tired.

416
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,072
but you are feeling tired, mother.
mother, you come.

417
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,679
did you eat anything, my son?
- y es, mother.

418
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:51,787
y our father always told me not
to send you anywhere alone.

419
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,853
times are very bad, my son.

420
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,760
l am feeling tense about you.

421
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,861
my mother, don`t you worry.

422
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:01,792
my god.
- nothing will happen.

423
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,091
l have come here to see you, mother.

424
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:09,470
okay, mother.

425
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,539
son, have these people eaten anything?

426
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,538
y es, mother.
mother, l`ll just be back.

427
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:14,839
salim.
- y es.

428
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:15,703
give it to me.

429
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:20,877
take the vehicle.

430
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,569
y ou too heard what my sister said, right?

431
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:42,230
l don`t know.

432
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,900
how fast they have forgotten everything.

433
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,803
our father was stabbed and
killed in front of us.

434
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,145
she considers everything as destiny.

435
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,011
destiny.

436
01:00:53,883 --> 01:01:01,983
destiny which helps people who kill muslims in
this country in the name of communal riots.

437
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:08,658
l can lead a life of a secular muslim
by eating and watching tv.

438
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:12,528
l have taken this decision
after thinking about it a lot.

439
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:13,993
lt`s not a joke.

440
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,766
l`ve seen you helping a person who
belongs to our community in the jail.

441
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:22,377
have you ever thought about how our
people outside the prison are living?

442
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:26,947
y ou are a muslim who prays
five times a day, right?

443
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:32,047
lf allah asks you what you`ve
done for your brother

444
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,688
what will you answer him?
y ou`ve worked for a `hawala` scam?

445
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,019
have you ever thought about
all these things?

446
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:42,794
lf you are a true believer,
then when your belief is in danger

447
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,365
y ou should readily sacrifice your life.

448
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,004
a true muslim will sacrifice
his life for his brothers.

449
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:58,977
the prayer mark on the forehead of the
muslims won`t be a target police guns.

450
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:12,986
l know, brother.

451
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,493
l understand what you are saying, brother.

452
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,937
either you can accept this.

453
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,243
or you can decide on any other option.

people who are alike will unite.

a fox will always join up with a fox.

484
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,458
babu sait has planned something.

485
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,129
strengthen the surveillance.

486
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:09,963
they should feel the itch.

487
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,467
they should think we`ve got
some message.

488
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:14,465
let`s go.

489
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:25,003
ce

490
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,030
his search.

491
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,677
they are arresting people who wear caps and
have a mustache without any reason.

492
01:06:55,845 --> 01:07:00,009
he is searching your houses and boats.

493
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,741
lf you ask something, the family members
including women and children get beaten.

494
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,853
we can`t tolerate this.

495
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,122
salim, what do you want to do?

496
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,484
let`s bomb the railway station
and the bus stand.

497
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,852
only then they`ll be scared.

498
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:15,019
let them do some other work
instead of coming behind us.

499
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,956
then let`s bomb the police headquarters.

500
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,299
that`d be better.
- what are you saying?

501
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:22,971
don`t say stuff like this.

502
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,636
lf you can bomb the railway station
and the collectorate

503
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:26,967
then why can`t we do the
same at the headquarters?

504
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,371
what if you keep one there?

505
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:32,709
won`t it break?

506
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,561
""silent shores``

507
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:51,489

01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,235

sir. cable repair, sir.

510
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:13,751
okay.

511
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:43,043
sir. ls the tv okay?
- y es. okay.

512
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:34,926
ce

513
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,441
anyway, it`s not a crude bomb.

514
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,440
the material which is usually used
in local bombs is not used in this.

515
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:48,173
the components of rdx and
ammonium nitrate are in it.

516
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,117
but surprisingly, there`s no trace
of the killer components.

517
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,888
lt might have been kept to scare us.

518
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,727
no one died because at that time
the commissioner had called a meeting.

519
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,300
but this is a strong message
for the police.

520
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:20,478
wait. wait. wait. wait.

521
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,412
just rewind that bit.

522
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,055
anything wrong, mr. manimaran?

523
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:31,985
nothing.

524
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,989
the lady there..
she resembles my batch mate.

525
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:53,509
well. l have arranged for the newspapers
and magazines which you read.

526
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,342
read all that.

527
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,349
l also have bad news for you.

528
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:04,457
y our section chief,
mr. venkatesh is no more.

529
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:08,026
he was hiding to avoid the police.

530
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,857
but he committed suicide when he came
to know that there is no other option.

531
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:15,529
lt`s sad but we`ve got some real stuff.

532
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:23,741
aisha. read about the bomb blast
in the police headquarters?

533
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,881
can l ask you a personal question?

534
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:37,056
are you...what do you say
in malayalam? a believer?

535
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,394
l don`t need to tell you that.

536
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,903
what about anwar?

537
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:57,906
ls he a true believer?

538
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,071
ls he a true believer?

539
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,599
greetings.

540
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,103
greetings.

541
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,002
brother basheer, this..

542
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,105
anwar.

543
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:35,509
greetings.
- greetings.

544
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:41,183
rana. meet our new hero.
brother anwar.

545
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:47,560
please be seated.

546
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,203
babu has told me everything.

547
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,938
anwar, you have proved that
you are a true believer..

548
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:04,870
..and warrior by conducting a blast
in the police headquarters.

549
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,444
a believer becomes a real man..

550
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:13,982
..when he doesn`t fear death.
a muslim.

551
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,560
the police is very alert.

552
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,563
the blast could happen
in unexpected places.

553
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:29,228
the public and police should become
more and more scared after each blast.

554
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,902
people will agitate to arrest the accused.

555
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,408
like we know, our innocent
brothers will be arrested.

556
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:47,180
like each riot creates a martyr, each
blast will create a `jihad` (holy war) for us.

557
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:49,588
very good.

558
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:55,362
when the police will arrest so many
people, our `jihad` recruitment..

559
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:58,600
..will also increase that much.

560
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:07,108
be careful about the fixed cell
not getting loose.

561
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:12,938
a magnet should be attached to the
ammonium nitrate on the other side.

562
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:22,450
after that, with an insulation tape, tighten
the magnet like this with cells and wire.

563
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:28,125
after that fix the timer.

564
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:38,971
next is the process of taking
this to the destination.

565
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,467
no one can instruct you about that.

566
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:47,638
y ou can take safety measures
in your own way.

567
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,546
when you get there,
put on the timer.

568
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,649
after putting on the timer,
fix the magnet bit somewhere..

569
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,662
..on an iron part in the
targeted place.

570
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:05,998
lf you make a small mistake,

571
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:12,100
you will remain only as a martyr
who sacrificed your life for muslims.

572
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:22,540
ce

573
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,896
are you mad or what?

574
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,069
how many times has he done this?

575
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,566
brother babu, l don`t think
he`ll be able to do this.

576
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:52,004
lf we give him this, he will burst
this here and kill us too.

577
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,146
y ou explain to him nicely.
he will do it.

578
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,676
y ou make him understand once more.

579
01:15:58,453 --> 01:15:59,249
abu.

580
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:07,929
tell me, sir.

581
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,607
they don`t know that it`s me, right?
okay, sir.

582
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:38,459
y ou try once more.

583
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,221
abu, did you mention this
to someone?

584
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,795
l didn`t say it like that, brother babu.

585
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,036
to my sister`s son.

586
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,469
l told him in the thrill of doing
a thing like this, brother.

587
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,477
he won`t tell this to anyone.

588
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,306
brother babu, promise in the
name of allah. he won`t tell.

589
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,146
he won`t tell anyone.

590
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,451
the police will reach your house now.

591
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,052
what foolishness is this?

592
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:11,153
l have told you several times
about how to keep secrets..

593
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,988
..and the danger thereof
if it gets leaked.

594
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,258
now l can`t save you, son.

595
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,239
salim.

596
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,074
salim. no.

597
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,939
salim. anwar.

598
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:18,558
brother babu. abu.
abu was our boy.

599
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:20,791
lf he made a mistake, then we..

600
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,793
the police is tracking abu.

601
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:27,192
lf they`d got him, then the police
would have got to you and me.

602
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:32,237
l have closed the route which they
could take. l have only done that.

603
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:39,636
l`ve told you several times that it`s
not possible for him to do that.

604
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,309
l know what to do.

605
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,585
l will do this alone.

606
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:47,914
leave that. the police has got
information about that

607
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,155
they`ve only informed you that
they`ve got information about it.

608
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:58,265
then it`ll be easier for us to do it.
l will manage this.

609
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:16,344
keep our surveillance strong
for the coming two days..

610
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:20,078
l`ve got information that a major bomb
blast will take place in fort kochi.

611
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:22,848
that is from a very reliable source.

612
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:26,523
so we should keep an eye on each
and every corner of the city.

613
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:28,362
l hope you don`t make any mistake.

614
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:38,963
ce

615
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:49,820
ce

616
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,470
three people were murdered
and 10 people were injured in..

617
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:07,214
..the bomb blast in ernakulam city.

618
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:10,651
no one has accepted the
responsibility for the blast.

619
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:15,983
the police suspects the international
outfit which has roots in kerala.

620
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:19,820
the bomb blast that killed three people
happened soon after the bomb blast..

621
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:23,657
..in the police headquarters
in ernakulam.

622
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,991
the police was not ready to divulge
information about the murdered people.

623
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:35,406
the continuous complaint against
the police is the reason behind this.

624
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:38,010
well done, my son.
very nice.

625
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,347
the police has blocked the
media people from taking..

626
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:44,006
..pictures of the place and the incident.
this has created a bad situation there.

627
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,278
what happened? ls there any problem?

628
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:53,522
we took so much risk,
but only three people were killed.

629
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:03,704
y ou come.

630
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:13,141
don`t think about the people who were killed.
create a wave in the heart of the public.

631
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:16,043
that`ll be our success.
society will respond in that way.

632
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:21,544
they will accept our need.
that`s why l said, it`s our success.

633
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:32,890
the bomb blast in coimbatore was one of
the successful blasts we`d in south lndia.

634
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:49,313
these people were behind that.
they`ve all come from outside.

635
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:50,914
trained beguines.

636
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,081
our people were there to help them.

637
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,153
the brain behind it and
planning was theirs.

638
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:56,254
one year of planning.

639
01:24:56,458 --> 01:25:00,417
these ten people will come again by crossing
the borders of bangladesh and nepal.

640
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:05,257
we are responsible for arranging
home-stay accommodation..

641
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,662
..in kochi for these people
who come as tourists.

642
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:13,436
they will go to mumbai in our fishing boat
which is filled with rdx and weapons.

643
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:19,941
a person who can face a complicated
case can only handle this.

644
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:23,780
brother basher suggested your name.

645
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:28,455
y ou have to take them
to mumbai safely.

646
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,057
y ou`ve only heard about
the coimbatore bomb blasts.

647
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,233
y ou haven`t seen them, right?

648
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:26,743
l didn`t know that you had come, master.

649
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,116
when did you come, anwar?
- two to three days ago.

650
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:31,342
will you get a transfer to palakkad soon?

651
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,186
lt`s not a governmentjob
that l`ll get a transfer.

652
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,618
master, did you have tea?
- y es. l have had. l am leaving.

653
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:39,020
anwar, give me the bike`s key.
- l will drop master and come.

654
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:40,694
okay.
- okay.

655
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,865
who is this sainaba?
why are you not playing?

656
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,899
greetings.
- greetings.

657
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:53,298
mother!
- hey. y ou came?

658
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,379
mother, don`t give me any other work.

659
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,707
this is the fourth time
l have gone to town.

660
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:03,315
nowadays all this can be done
through the phone.

661
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:07,045
then what is the need to send me
to get the chicken.

662
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:13,393
ls it right that l roam around in town instead
of being here as the bride`s only brother?

663
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:17,060
hey. have you done anything
for your sister?

664
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,665
y our father has even invited your friends.

665
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:25,430
y ou`ve at least come for her wedding
from bangalore which is close to america.

666
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,507
y ou at least run here and
there for her wedding.

667
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:29,734
let at least four people in
palakkad see your physique..

668
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,973
..which you made by going
to the gym.

669
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,581
mother. stop making these
kinds of comments.

670
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,411
y ourjokes are not good these days.

671
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,088
anyway l have stopped
the taxi service today.

672
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:41,914
anwar.

673
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:46,654
kunjuraman vaidyar is waiting in
the bus stand. go and pick him up.

674
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:51,328
that.. father that..jamal has taken
the bike to drop mr. vijayan.

675
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:54,660
vaidyar came here several times.
he knows this route very well.

676
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:58,700
even then if you take the car and go there
to receive him he will be very happy.

677
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,868
anwar, you get there fast.
- tell some lie.

678
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:04,943
l will send ramla`s shukur for that.

679
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:08,547
let him gloat as the
bride`s brother here.

680
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,615
say that, mother.

681
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:23,320
ce

682
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:35,739
""the flower which blossoms
in the east is red in color``

683
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:42,544
""how the bride blushed``

684
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:49,817
""a groom has come with
love in his heart``

685
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:56,486
""a friend has come with
many dreams in his eyes``

686
01:28:56,864 --> 01:29:10,335
""reach the heart, reach the heart``

ce

729
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,607
this is my house and village.

730
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,282
l was brought up here.

731
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:22,454
hasna knows that.
grade two onwards we were together.

732
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:26,782
now l stay in coimbatore near my office.
ln a working women`s hostel.

733
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,062
hasna made me stay in your house.

734
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:33,467
but whenever l shall come here,
l will stay here.

735
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:40,737
okay then. thank you for the drive.
- bye.

736
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:02,155
without knowing her, without speaking.
l don`t even know her.

737
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,597
..l started loving her.

738
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:10,999
brother, your decision is good.
aisha is very nice.

739
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:17,674
well educated. stubborn.
absolutely independent.

740
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,004
she was selected on campus
in our batch.

741
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:24,341
now she is working in a reputed
chemical company in coimbatore.

742
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:27,616
several boys were after her
when she was in college.

743
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,515
she didn`t care for anyone.

744
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:33,284
brother, don`t go in front of her
by saying you love her.

745
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,353
even he hasn`t gone behind any girl.

746
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:40,625
he likes aisha. he said that
to his father and mother.

747
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:44,794
what is less for him?
there`s little pride.

748
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:47,200
that is because of this age.
lt will go. right, son?

749
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,375
father, you..

750
01:35:49,343 --> 01:35:50,708
while discussing about life..

751
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,374
l told you everything.
one more thing.

752
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:58,116
she won`t like you showing sympathy about
the fact that she was born in an orphanage.

753
01:35:58,419 --> 01:35:59,886
l don`t have any sympathy for anyone.

754
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:05,491
giving food to hungry people and
caring for an orphan is a good deed.

755
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:09,462
we all like aisha.
then it`s about her decision.

756
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:11,062
let`s ask her about it.

757
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:15,732
my goal was to study, get a job..
..and live without depending on others.

758
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:23,733
ln this matter too,
l can tell you my decision.

759
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:29,405
even if it is right or wrong. l have taken
all decisions on my own till now.

760
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:33,416
l haven`t called anyone
father and mother.

761
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:39,185
l`d like to call hasna`s father
and mother the same.

762
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:58,835
ce

763
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:24,665
""l am very excited``

764
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:31,004
""when l see my love coming
with a smile on her face``

765
01:37:31,212 --> 01:37:37,014

""waves, please come``

767

""without the knowledge of the shore``

768
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:12,210

769
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:29,736

770
01:38:29,937 --> 01:38:35,898

music behind you``

ce

782
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:37,453
there was a festival in my house.

783
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:41,032
my daughter and son`s weddings
were to be held on the same day.

784
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:44,530
those were days of happiness
for my father and mother.

785
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:51,610
we left after aisha
and my engagement.

786
01:40:53,514 --> 01:40:55,880
bye.
- bye.

787
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,881
after dropping aisha at her office,

788
01:40:59,253 --> 01:41:04,213
we went to a textile shop in coimbatore
to take hasna`s wedding dress.

789
01:41:09,263 --> 01:41:10,730
how is it?
- nice.

790
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:13,063
that pink.. pink..this one..

791
01:41:19,206 --> 01:41:21,572
this is nice, isn`t it?
tell me which one is nice.- okay.

792
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,067
father. may l go downstairs?
- okay.

793
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:24,903
this one.

794
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:35,445
ce

795
01:42:38,785 --> 01:42:42,050
my world ended at the time.

796
01:42:42,856 --> 01:42:47,987
my father, mother and hasna..
our happy family is no more.

797
01:42:48,862 --> 01:42:53,925
l sat without a tear in my eyes.
within a second..

798
01:42:56,036 --> 01:43:00,837
..l had become an orphan
within a second.

799
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:47,784
brother.

800
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:39,695
l have told you all the details.

801
01:44:39,906 --> 01:44:44,605
where, when and how.
then how were people killed there?

802
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:47,108
now you have made me like them.

803
01:44:48,415 --> 01:44:50,440
the death of three people
won`t be news for you.

804
01:44:50,817 --> 01:44:51,943
but for me, it`s not like that.

805
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:57,617
l am praying to a god who says that we
should love others more than ourselves.

806
01:44:58,492 --> 01:45:00,221
he won`t forgive me.
- one minute.

807
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:01,223
just a minute.

808
01:45:02,162 --> 01:45:03,959
l have told you not to
meet me in public.

809
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:05,962
then why did you break that promise?

810
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:08,293
l haven`t broken the promise.
lt`s you.

811
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:10,966
how were those people killed..

812
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:12,635
..even after l had informed
you about everything?

813
01:45:12,839 --> 01:45:13,965
l want to know that.

814
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:17,638
y ou are responsible for saying that.
l have got the right to know that.

815
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:19,812
whatever you told me was right, anwar

816
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:25,816
can`t avoid people getting hurt in blast.
three people weren`t killed in blast..

817
01:45:26,019 --> 01:45:28,317
lt`s not true.
lt`s a cooked up story.

818
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:33,653
every photo in media was
morphed and planned.

819
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:35,559
lt happened without your knowledge.

820
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:38,490
they weren`t born at all.

821
01:45:38,865 --> 01:45:40,162
how can you fight them?

822
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,828
y ou got to believe me.

823
01:45:42,035 --> 01:45:43,093
l believe everything.

824
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:46,602
but tomorrow if you say that
aisha`s story is also a made-up story

825
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:48,731
then we have to believe that, right?

826
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:53,843
l want to see her.
- aisha is safe in my custody.

827
01:45:54,214 --> 01:45:55,511
l don`t trust you.

828
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:58,513
y ou haven`t even told me where aisha is.

829
01:45:58,952 --> 01:46:01,853
aisha has been in your custody for
more than one and a half years.

830
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:04,523
y ou haven`t even presented her
before the court yet.

831
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:09,025
l am not sure that she is alive.
l have to meet her.

832
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:11,697
not possible, anwar.
what do you think?

833
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:13,522
aisha is a terrorist suspect.

834
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:17,199
y ou nor l can save her at the moment
when we present her before the court.

835
01:46:17,404 --> 01:46:18,530
nobody can save her.

836
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:20,267
l am an ats officer.

837
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:24,136
lt`s a risk for me too,
to present her before the court.

838
01:46:24,511 --> 01:46:26,706
even you know that l am doing
all this for her safety.

839
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:29,382
till this mission gets completed,
you can`t meet her.

840
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:30,709
y ou won`t meet her.

841
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:33,812
y ou very well know the
circumstances that led you here.

842
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:35,885
ls it possible for you to
forget all that?

843
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:38,216
ls it possible for you to forget the
incident that took place in front of you?

844
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:41,053
ls it possible for you to forge
those days in the hospital?

845
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:43,888
tell me. how can you forget?

846
01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:58,003
sir, l am waiting here for
the last three hours.

847
01:46:58,445 --> 01:47:00,743
l have gone to all the
police stations in coimbatore.

848
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:03,245
at last l came to know that
aisha`s arrest warrant was registered here.

849
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:07,412
sir, l am talking to you.

850
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:09,851
why did you arrest her
without any reason?

851
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:12,583
who are you? what is your name?

852
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:14,423
sir, my name is anwar ahmed.

853
01:47:14,628 --> 01:47:20,589
anwar ahmed? how did you get the courage
to come and shout in a police station?

854
01:47:21,067 --> 01:47:24,036
mind your tongue.
- mind my tongue?

855
01:47:28,575 --> 01:47:32,102
from where did you get the courage
to raise your hand at me?

856
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:34,940
whom did you raise your hand on?
- hey. leave him.

857
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:39,445
bring him inside.

858
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,791
sir, l was waiting at the
mortuary to identify my..

859
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:49,791
..mother`s, father`s and
sister`s dead bodies..

860
01:47:49,996 --> 01:47:51,293
..in the hospital last evening.

861
01:47:51,832 --> 01:47:55,131
aisha was coming to the hospital..
..from her hospital after l called her.

862
01:47:57,337 --> 01:48:00,636
sir. please check her phone.
she called me last. please.

863
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:04,242
anwar, l feel sympathy for you.

864
01:48:04,678 --> 01:48:06,646
what you`re saying is
your personal matter.

865
01:48:07,347 --> 01:48:09,542
for me, witnesses and
evidences are important.

866
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:13,385
no one should face a situation
which you are facing.

867
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:17,318
aisha was my sister`s best friend.
our marriage was finalized.

868
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:19,918
y esterday she came to
coimbatore with my family.

869
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:23,152
how come she was involved in
the bomb blast that killed all of them.

870
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:24,887
have you lost yet?

871
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:29,829
the chemical used for the bomb blast came
from the factory where aisha is working.

872
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:31,999
we don`t know where the
boss of that factory is.

873
01:48:32,472 --> 01:48:36,169
the out-pass of that consignment
was signed by aisha.

874
01:48:36,376 --> 01:48:38,241
she had signed it.
l have enough proof.

875
01:48:38,445 --> 01:48:39,673
what do you expect me to do?

876
01:48:40,146 --> 01:48:43,172
sir, she might have signed so
many out-passes in the factory.

877
01:48:43,617 --> 01:48:46,677
that`s herjob. for that, how could
she become a terrorist?

878
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:48,855
how can you make her a suspect?

879
01:48:49,656 --> 01:48:51,089
do you know what she said?

880
01:48:51,725 --> 01:48:52,919
do you have proof?

881
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:57,687
y ou can`t see her easily.
lt`s not child`s play.

882
01:48:57,898 --> 01:48:59,092
y ou have to wait.

883
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:03,359
go. go and find out who
is behind that blast.

884
01:49:04,304 --> 01:49:06,534
y our family was destroyed, right?
so prove it.

885
01:49:06,907 --> 01:49:11,207
l will release aisha after that.
there`s no use crying.

886
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:18,409
sir, l don`t cry.
sir, l will never cry.

887
01:49:19,519 --> 01:49:24,388
lf l cry, l will forget everything.
l want to prove it, sir.

888
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:26,217
but how?

889
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:30,226
l am a common man who doesn`t
have rights or the power.

890
01:49:31,431 --> 01:49:33,331
my loss is only mine.

891
01:49:33,767 --> 01:49:36,998
my mother. father. sister.
my life. everything..

892
01:49:39,339 --> 01:49:43,002
nothing is left.
so l am not scared.

893
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:47,472
l won`t leave. l won`t leave anyone.

894
01:49:48,214 --> 01:49:52,810
whoever is behind this, l won`t spare
them so they can destroy another life.

895
01:49:53,453 --> 01:49:56,081
god has left me to do this work.

896
01:50:00,894 --> 01:50:06,264
when l said l didn`t know
what l was going to face..

897
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:11,597
l had become an answer for the lives
of thousands of people who were killed.

898
01:50:12,472 --> 01:50:17,876
l was only an instrument
for ats dlg manimaran.

899
01:50:18,712 --> 01:50:25,117
but l knew that the war he`s fighting..
..keeping me in front would be my revenge.

900
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:28,446
y es. l was waging a war
by keeping you in front.

901
01:50:29,322 --> 01:50:33,281
a human bomb to finish babu`s gang.

902
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:40,228
ln short, he was perfect.

903
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:45,300
that was my only option to
reach the people who killed..

904
01:50:45,905 --> 01:50:47,304
..my father, mother and sister
and to save aisha.

905
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:49,974
stalin manimaran had planned
everything including the..

906
01:50:50,977 --> 01:50:52,968
..the hawala case and the
bomb blast that happened in..

907
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:56,478
..the police headquarters
and fort kochi.

908
01:50:56,950 --> 01:51:01,649
l realized that l had almost
reached my target..

909
01:51:02,122 --> 01:51:10,154
when babu sait showed me the
pictures of the people l was looking for.

910
01:51:16,202 --> 01:51:22,903
only once..
l have to meet her only once.

911
01:51:25,712 --> 01:51:27,270
please don`t say no.

912
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:43,719
ce

913
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:28,070
this is not for getting anything
back or to save anyone, aisha.

914
01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:33,742
but l don`t have any other option before me.
that is fate. even you know that.

915
01:52:34,781 --> 01:52:39,582
ls it possible for you to live with me
thinking that everything is fate?

916
01:52:41,121 --> 01:52:42,418
no. l don`t know.

917
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:47,487
lf what l am doing is right,
then god will be with us.

918
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:50,429

y our belief was wrong, babu sait.

983
02:06:08,327 --> 02:06:11,125
l am the living example of that.

984
02:06:12,598 --> 02:06:15,931
when you conduct a war to destroy
the country in the name of lslam,

985
02:06:16,902 --> 02:06:21,396
do you even think how many people..
..including muslims are killed in that?

986
02:06:23,108 --> 02:06:29,513
what mistake did the people who you
killed in the name of your father make?

987
02:06:32,017 --> 02:06:35,475
when you celebrated the
bomb blast that happened in..

988
02:06:36,655 --> 02:06:39,488
..coimbatore as the biggest
success of `jihad`..

989
02:06:39,692 --> 02:06:41,159
..l lost my father who taught me
the duties of true lslam.

990
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:45,490
lt`s auspicious to give food to hungry
people and take care of orphans.

991
02:06:45,965 --> 02:06:47,990
my mother who loved
the entire world.

992
02:06:48,534 --> 02:06:51,833
and my sister who was dreaming
about her marriage.

993
02:06:54,873 --> 02:06:57,501
y ou`ve destroyed my family
without allowing me to..

994
02:06:57,710 --> 02:06:59,678
..perform the last rites for them
as per a muslim`s customs.

995
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:11,016
l was the weapon made to stand
against you because of you.

996
02:07:11,223 --> 02:07:13,191
l won`t let them destroy another life.

997
02:07:13,392 --> 02:07:16,020
god has left me for that.

998
02:07:18,163 --> 02:07:22,031
this is the revenge of a muslim
who was brought up..

999
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:24,361
..here and who wished
to live his life here.

1000
02:07:26,405 --> 02:07:27,599
y ou won`t find bliss.

1001
02:07:28,841 --> 02:07:36,270
muslims won`t pardon you.
y ou`ve failed, babu sait.

1002
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:48,287
y ou won`t even be eligible to die.

1003
02:07:50,262 --> 02:07:56,724
no believer will ever come
to take you for your cremation.

1004
02:08:39,411 --> 02:08:42,278
hello.
- l am anwar.

1005
02:08:51,323 --> 02:08:55,282
the police ats group has become
famous by killing international terrorists.

1006
02:08:55,494 --> 02:08:58,793
the media has run the brave story
of dsp sanjay ramakrishnan

1007
02:08:59,331 --> 02:09:02,300
and his troop for surrendering
the terrorists

1008

..stalin manimaran who died
after bravely fighting the terrorists.

1012
02:09:33,031 --> 02:09:35,829
no one has tried to look for aisha
because the police has found..

1013
02:09:36,135 --> 02:09:38,069
..the actual accused of
the coimbatore case.

1014
02:09:38,704 --> 02:09:43,607
people like asharaf came to know
about this incident through the media.

1015
02:09:44,376 --> 02:09:50,576
but no one came to know about
the struggling story of anwar.

1016
02:09:51,049 --> 02:09:53,415
