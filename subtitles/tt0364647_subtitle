1
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,143
Ready.

2
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,011
I am V.R. Krishna lyer,
that's my name.

3
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:08,089
I was a lawyer, later a Minister,

4
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,693
after that I was a Judge.
Now I am 88 years old.

5
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,998
Based on my experience,

6
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:20,328
I strongly support abolishing
the capital punishment.

7
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,768
This is not my personal view.

8
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,336
From time immemorial it has
been a part of our tradition.

9
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,738
Gandhi also used to say,

10
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,539
God has given this life,

11
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,817
only God has the right to take it.

12
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,748
Neither court nor the state has
any right on it.

13
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,622
Kindly note that death penalty
is another kind of,

14
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,191
judicially sanctioned murder.

15
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,191
<i>Thank you.</i>

16
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,593
My name is Munuswamy.

17
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,300
I have hanged 46 people till date.
- Do you feel guilty?

18
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,130
What?

19
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,103
<i>Do you feel guilty of taking</i>
<i>so many lives?</i>

20
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,333
Initially I had guilty feeling,

21
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,041
but now it has become
my profession.

22
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,440
I don't that feeling now.

23
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,378
This is special Manila rope noose.

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,911
Every time we change this.

25
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,181
As the face is covered
by a black mask.

26
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,518
Protruding of the tongue & popping out
of the eyes are not seen.

27
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,125
There is no need for
the witnesses to see them.

28
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,027
Marappan. - Death penalty.

29
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,933
I was a head master of a
school for 30 years.

30
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,562
One day some boys came & told me
that few boys were creating trouble.

31
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,400
When I went to check, I learnt that
the trouble maker was correspondent's son.

32
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,632
I warned him to stop,
but he didn't.

33
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,434
I beat him and he fell down dead.

34
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,305
I'm not obsessed of that sin.

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,409
God has destined me to do that.

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,542
Regretting the incident I went
home to commit suicide.

37
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,856
My wife said, "A teacher mustn't
set a bad precedent".

38
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,515
So, I went to the police station
and surrendered.

39
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,322
Later, they made me go from
pillar to post in courts,

40
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,054
Now, I am in the death row.

41
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,629
A mercy petition was filed, but
I don't know what happened to it.

42
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:59,600
I am now hanging, without a noose,
between life & death.

43
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:06,539
On the whole we arrange
a decent death for criminals.

44
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,941
I don't know what is decent
about this death.

45
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,116
If this is judgement and
this is justice,

46
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,547
I would hang myself.

47
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,887
My name is Angela Kathamuthu.

48
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,125
I am now in central prison.

49
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,361
I am involved in a research about
the validity of capital punishment.

50
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,488
We are abiding by the law,

51
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,797
not in the interest of this society,

52
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,903
but more out of fear of
the punishment, that is true.

53
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,500
To protect society & law,

54
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,574
there is an opinion which
says punishment in necessary.

55
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,304
There is another opinion which says
law has too many loop holes.

56
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,182
Like men, law too has
committed many mistakes.

57
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,512
There are many evidences
in the history.

58
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:53,955
Many times law has magnanimously
re-written it's judgements.

59
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:58,721
But there's one judgement which even
the law can't re-write.

60
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,455
That is death penalty.

61
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:05,999
Go inside.

62
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,675
My name is Peikaman.

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,169
I took examination in 2000 and
came here as Sub-jailer on promotion.

64
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,015
What's the problem, man?
- There's no screw in the door.

65
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,187
One minute.

66
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,858
Come with me man.
- I think today our given time is over.

67
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,187
We've got permission tomorrow also.
We'll come & take interviews.

68
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,033
<i>We've come here with permission.</i>

69
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,964
No problem... is camera running.
Switch it on quickly.

70
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,868
I'll finish it before
he comes back.

71
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,870
Narayanan, death penalty.

72
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,043
Anyway I am going to die, I will
tell you everything before that.

73
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,540
Too many irregularities are
happening in this jail.

74
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,713
Atrocities of Peikaman are unbearable.

75
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,883
Everything bad is happening here.

76
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,052
Cell phones, drugs are going
around the jail.

77
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,880
Jailer is a good man,
but this Peikaman is...

78
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,723
<i>Any problem?</i>

79
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,385
Did he say anything?

80
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,557
Prisoners in death row
are very moody people.

81
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,892
They'll laugh, cry and
whatever they say are lies.

82
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,569
You could've asked me.

83
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,064
Mr. Cameraman. - Sir.

84
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,566
You have left your lens cap here.

85
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:18,800
Thank you.

86
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,252
Will they telecast it bravely?
They'll not develop cold feet, will they?

87
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,586
Why? Definitely not.

88
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,429
We must be afraid only if
they are Government servants.

89
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,094
Tomorrow, I will come prepared
with 4 or 5 extra tapes.

90
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,763
What if a few more
Narayanan's talk to you.

91
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,436
Girish, you also deserve to be
in a jail. - Of course.

92
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,434
Do you know I was very nervous.

93
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,107
Madam, you've done doctorate
only in civil law.

94
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,505
I've done doctorate in cheating.
Watch me tomorrow.

95
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,507
Shall we add this shot or...?

96
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,778
Keep it inside as important.
Let's think about it later.

97
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,608
No need to invite trouble now.

98
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,284
Let's see what is in this jeep.

99
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,955
I am not able to recognize
who is in there.

100
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,636
Move... move.

101
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,408
Move away.

102
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,480
Bloody rascal! What do you think of
yourself? I will wipe all of you.

103
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,420
Shut up. Don't shout.

104
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,227
Inform Angela has come to
meet the Jailer.

105
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,558
They have come to meet the Jailer.

106
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,011
I want to clean up the whole mess
during my tenure here.

107
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,687
For that I want...
- Sir, that lady interviewer...

108
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,014
Ask her to come in.

109
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,524
Giving a ready made
explanation for everything.

110
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,120
Hello, good morning.

111
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,122
Morning, madam.
Please take your seat.

112
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,521
Any how it's not a good morning
for me, it's very bad.

113
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,358
Why?

114
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,196
Prisoners are fasting inside
and outside trouble & commotion.

115
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,929
Brother, please don't take out.
- Okay. - Leave it.

116
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,537
Any small issue is enough for them
...this time it's a death.

117
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,146
Our heads will roll if anyone
dies in our custody.

118
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,712
Okay, forget about it.

119
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,385
You will complete your interviews
today, won't you?

120
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,713
Please finish them. Don't take them at in
yesterday's place.

121
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,048
It's very sensitive.

122
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,555
I have allotted this block.
It will be convenient for you.

123
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,560
Try to finish it today
so that it will be...

124
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,888
Yes, just 2-3 interviews
are pending. - Okay.

125
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,894
We left an interview half way yesterday.
We've to continue it.

126
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,566
Okay. Who was he?

127
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,894
Was it teacher Marappa Gounder?
- No... no...

128
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,570
I think he was Narayanan.

129
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,732
Death sentence prisoner? - Yeah.

130
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,410
Any problem? - Nothing.

131
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:07,977
Please wait outside.

132
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,416
This place is in chaos.

133
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,746
We need help from committed
people like you.

134
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:21,760
Okay.

135
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,261
You can't interview Narayanan.
- Why?

136
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,766
He fell ill yesterday and died
on the way to the hospital.

137
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,596
<i>Don't kill the prisoners...</i>

138
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,935
Prisoners here are suspicious
about his death.

139
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,103
You can hear them, can't you?

140
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,280
<i>Sir, his relatives have come</i>
<i>to claim the body.</i>

141
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,677
Wait, I will come after
few minutes.

142
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,451
Narayanan was more dangerous
compared to other rowdies.

143
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,284
One minute.

144
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,624
A lady is coming, isn't it?
Open the main gate.

145
00:09:58,998 --> 00:09:59,794
You come in madam.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,467
For a rowdy's death,

147
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,303
They are resorting to fasting
as if he was a Mahatma.

148
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,636
Jailer is a good man.

149
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,806
That isn't enough here.
You need an iron fist.

150
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,138
IPS Officers will never have it.

151
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,315
Only officers like me who come
from the cadre, have it.

152
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,313
Or else... they will resort
to fasting like this.

153
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,380
Sir, I didn't commit anything wrong.
- Wait, I will come.

154
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,817
You come madam.

155
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,984
I think you are upset because you are
unable to interview Narayanan.

156
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:26,817
Oh no.

157
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,994
Don't worry, there is another
more interesting case than him.

158
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:29,991
The people we are going to meet now,

159
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,825
both of them together have massacred
24 people in Theni District.

160
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,161
They then tried to kill each other.
Now both of them are in jail.

161
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,163
One is going to gallows.
One is serving a life term.

162
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,166
You would have heard
about Virumaandi case.

163
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,940
I had investigated that case.

164
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,668
We are now going to meet second
accused, Virumaandi's sworn enemy.

165
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,078
Kothaala Thevar.

166
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:54,076
C. K... Chinnakolarpatti,
Theni District.

167
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:55,520
Life.

168
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,353
...Life term.

169
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,756
<i>Tell me fu</i>rt<i>her.</i>

170
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:07,859
Direct descendants of Sundara Pandi Thevar
who ruled before Thirumalai Naicker,

171
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,026
No, talk in your normal way.
I don't want your old history.

172
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,705
Don't you? - No.

173
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,371
Tell me your opinion
about death penalty.

174
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,872
Death penalty is a must.

175
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,871
I don't mind 10 innocents
like me dying,

176
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,207
but, blood thirsty criminals shouldn't
have a free run in the country.

177
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,976
But law insists that let 10 criminals escape

178
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,710
but not one innocent should be punished.

179
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,721
That is why we respect natural justice
and fate more than law.

180
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,222
According to justice, if he should die,
that's his fate.

181
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,553
That is what law also says.

182
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,122
What do you understand from this?

183
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,988
There is God.

184
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,998
Who the law is insisting to die?
- That man!

185
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,326
That's the point, who is he?

186
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,572
Virumaandi.

187
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,904
Did you see? It's difficult even
to utter his name.

188
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,906
Appearances are deceptive.

189
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,477
I may appear like a villain,
but actually he is the real villain.

190
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,249
He instigated people of 2
villages to fight & die.

191
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,746
Which 2 villages?

192
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,409
C.K. Patti... Chinnakolarpatti and
Nallama Naickenur.

193
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,918
Beautiful villages.

194
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,503
<i>It was</i> '<i>Jallikattu'(Taming of bull) in</i>
<i>Nallama Naickenur that year.</i>

195
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,102
<i>Nallama Naicker had killed my father.</i>
<i>He spent 4 years in jail for that.</i>

196
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,278
<i>Everyone in this village knows it.</i>

197
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,112
<i>We don't have cordial relationship.</i>

198
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,273
<i>Despite this, in the interest of</i>
<i>the village, forgetting the past,</i>

199
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,283
<i>I make it a point to attend</i>
<i>such public functions,</i>

200
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,615
<i>like a peace loving dove.</i>

201
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,618
<i>Ladies & gentlemen, who have come</i>
<i>here to attend this festival,</i>

202
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,458
<i>young courageous men,</i>
<i>affectionate young man,</i>

203
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,533
<i>taming of the bull is about</i>
<i>to sta</i>rt<i>. All of you be ready.</i>

204
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,129
<i>Temple bull is coming up first.</i>

205
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,306
If you want good to happen,
don't touch it.

206
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,134
There the temple bull is coming.

207
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,469
Offer prayers to it.
Temple bull is coming first.

208
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,803
It's coming, give way to it.

209
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,641
Temple bull is coming.

210
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,476
<i>Temple bull is coming.</i>

211
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,151
<i>Don't touch it, if you touch it,</i>
<i>you are finished.</i>

212
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:07,978
<i>Holy motherl</i>

213
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,150
<i>Offer camphor.</i>

214
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,482
<i>Hey, move man.</i>
<i>Don't touch it.</i>

215
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,658
<i>Worship the bull and</i>
<i>stay away from it.</i>

216
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,486
<i>Apply little sandalwood paste.</i>
<i>- Hey, don't fall on me man.</i>

217
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,162
<i>Bull is coming...</i>
<i>Give way to the bull.</i>

218
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,991
<i>Let it go...</i>

219
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:21,833
<i>Temple bull is coming...</i>

220
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,663
<i>Listen to me. Don't try to tame it.</i>

221
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:30,331
Next one will be
Nallama Naicker's bull.

222
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,001
Do you know it's name? Veerapandi.
Bull from Nallama Naickenur.

223
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,511
Everybody listen carefully.
Don't make noise.

224
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,182
<i>Hey, go & tell them.</i>

225
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,352
<i>Go & tell your people not to tame bulls</i>
<i>from their native village.</i>

226
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,011
<i>Natives shouldn't tame it.</i>
<i>Do you know the name? Veerapandi.</i>

227
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,351
<i>Who is Veerapandi? Is there any man</i>
<i>here to tame this bull?</i>

228
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,188
<i>Do you know who is Veerapandi?</i>
<i>He Legendary Veerapandi Kattabomman.</i>

229
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,854
<i>Skies provide rain, ea</i>rt<i>h produces.</i>
<i>Why should we pay you tax?</i>

230
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,864
<i>This bull comes from a place that</i>
<i>belonged to the great warrior.</i>

231
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,697
<i>If you consider yourself a man,</i>
<i>stand before it.</i>

232
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,038
<i>Hey, stand away...</i>
<i>don't touch it's tail.</i>

233
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,540
<i>If you consider yourself a man,</i>
<i>stand before it.</i>

234
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:18,387
<i>Hey, watch it... Catch it.</i>
<i>... Pin it down.</i>

235
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,058
<i>Don't leave it's tail.</i>

236
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,888
Hey, look there, they are pinning
down our bull... - Our bull...

237
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,234
Someone please come & save it.
- Pin it down.

238
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,233
It's Veerapandi, isn't it?
That's why they could pin it.

239
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,069
Naicker is looking at us.

240
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,400
What's this? Your bull got
tamed so easily.

241
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,907
Bull isn't well.
- It seems bull isn't well.

242
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,070
What's the problem with the bull?

243
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,247
Why are you announcing it?
It's fine.

244
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,240
It seems bull is fine.

245
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,575
Move... move.

246
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,910
You have tamed it, haven't you?
They'll give the money. Go & get it.

247
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,245
Hey, was money our only aim?

248
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,921
Are we doing it for money?
Taming the bull is game of valour.

249
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,920
Great warrior! Hey, why are you
biting the tail?

250
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,752
After biting sheep & cattle,
will you bite humans next?

251
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,258
Why are they still pinning the bull down?
Tell them to leave it.

252
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,921
Who had tamed the bull?
Come & collect the prize money.

253
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,760
Don't make noise.
Shall we give it sir?

254
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,267
Take it. Sit down... sit down.

255
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,598
There's a watch also.
Will you give watch also sir?

256
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,936
There's watch also. Sit down... Looks
like they will remove my 'Dhothi' also.

257
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:17,108
Release it... release it.

258
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,453
Heroes who have come to
tame the bull.

259
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,120
The bull you have been eagerly
waiting for is coming up now.

260
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:33,957
What is the name of bull?

261
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,633
Sorimuthu reared by Annalakshmi.

262
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,631
Annamuthu brought up by Sorilakshmi.

263
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,307
Hey, don't make noise...
They will hack you all.

264
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:48,307
It belongs to Annalakshmi, daughter of
Kothaala Thevar's late elder brother.

265
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,982
Why is he announcing my name?
He should be announcing bull's name.

266
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,481
Listen one thing... be careful,
all of you be ready.

267
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,153
It is no ordinary bull.

268
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,982
It had butted down 50 people
in Alanganallur 'Jallikattu'.

269
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,658
<i>It struck people at the gate itself.</i>
<i>- Hey, move...</i>

270
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,659
<i>In another place it injured many people.</i>
<i>Now, it has come here.</i>

271
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,161
<i>Men who dare can tame it or</i>
<i>else go & sleep safely at home.</i>

272
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,164
<i>Heroes who have come to tame bulls</i>
<i>listen carefully.</i>

273
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,338
No native of Chinnakolarpatti
must attempt to tame it.

274
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,006
That is the condition.

275
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,504
<i>A condition to be followed strictly.</i>
<i>- Hey... move man.</i>

276
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,176
<i>No one must defy it.</i>
<i>- Hey, don't touch it.</i>

277
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,675
<i>A bull brought up by Annalakshmi.</i>

278
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,848
<i>If any stranger nears it, it'll rip him</i>
<i>apa</i>rt <i>like Annalakshmi, be careful.</i>

279
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,681
<i>Courageous men, brave men.</i>
<i>- Don't know who's going to be ripped apa</i>rt<i>?</i>

280
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,353
Get on to the platform.

281
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:35,016
<i>Because the bull will tear</i>
<i>you apa</i>rt<i>, be careful.</i>

282
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,024
<i>Bull is coming.</i>
<i>Run to safety.</i>

283
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,529
<i>Bull is coming charging.</i>

284
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,528
Look back... turn back.

285
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,204
<i>You are going to get kicked by it.</i>

286
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,703
<i>Look there, don't stand in a corner,</i>
<i>you'll get kicked to death.</i>

287
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,034
<i>Please listen to me. That's it, throw them,</i>
<i>only then they will realize.</i>

288
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,540
That's it, pin them down.

289
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,873
<i>Yes, come aside...</i>
<i>it's attacking... turn.</i>

290
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,548
<i>Listen... catch it, don't leave.</i>

291
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,547
If you throw dust into it's eyes,
I will kill you.

292
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:04,385
<i>It's attacking. Clear away.</i>

293
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,723
<i>Why do you come to tame the bull</i>
<i>if you're afraid of death? Stay out.</i>

294
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,893
<i>Hey, don't go inside.</i>

295
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,224
Hold this.

296
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,396
Hey Sorimuthu... go out... go out.

297
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,406
There are cows in the house.
Hey, chase them out.

298
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,737
It must live.

299
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,412
Why are you embarrassing me?
- Go out.

300
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,913
Chase it out. Competitors are waiting,
aren't they? - Go out.

301
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,755
Chinnakolarpatti people shouldn't
tame it. Listen to me.

302
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,090
Why shouldn't we? We will tame it.
Tell us the reason.

303
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,765
Once I say no, I mean it.

304
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,433
People from your village
shouldn't tame it.

305
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,263
Can an outsider tame it, then?
- Outsider? Who is that?

306
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,098
Our Singapore brother-in-law.

307
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,773
He's grandson of Kupputhai.
Don't you know?

308
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,498
Oh! Singapore brother-in-law!

309
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,834
Kupputhai's grandson.
- Who's he?

310
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,606
He went to Singapore to do cloth business.
- Say that away from the microphone.

311
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,377
Singapore brother-in-law
will tame the bull.

312
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,386
Tame it, let us see.

313
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,058
Virumaandi come down.

314
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,302
Virumaandi, my dear son
tame the bull.

315
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,469
Come... come down.

316
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,304
May I? - Come.

317
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,085
He's Prince in taming bulls.

318
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:48,990
<i>Enemies don't come down from skies.</i>
<i>We create them ourselves.</i>

319
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,889
<i>It's rumoured that Virumaandi's father</i>
<i>and Nallama Naicker killed my father.</i>

320
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,328
<i>We didn't take the rumour seriously.</i>

321
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,331
Catch it.

322
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,004
Move... move... move... - Come.
- Be careful.

323
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,844
Be careful brother, it's coming.

324
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,512
Don't leave it. Pin it down.

325
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,852
<i>Don't leave it. Be careful.</i>

326
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,352
Virumaandi brother, don't leave it.

327
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,043
Are you hurt? - No.

328
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,741
Release Sorimuthu from them.

329
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,174
You said Singapore man will tame it,
but all have joined to pin it down.

330
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,909
Hey move... get up from it.
- Where's he?

331
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,981
Do you accept?

332
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,093
He has accepted. Leave it.

333
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,103

Can't you hear me calling you?

358
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,767
My mother has fondly named
me Virumaandi.

359
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,436
Will I respond if you
call me something else?

360

What did Nallama Naicker say?

363
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,274
It seems he had sent a message.
What did he ask you?

364
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,771
He asked me if I am
interested to sell my lands.

365
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,608
What was your reply? - I told him that
I'm going to talk to you.

366
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,280
I am asking
what was your reply?

367
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,453
In this entire area only my well
has water at 20 feet.

368
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,453
I told him respectfully.
I will not sell.

369
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,288
Goto hell man. I am asking about the land.

370
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,287
Where are you going?
- We are going to Theni.

371
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,962
Who told you we are going to Theni?

372
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:52,960
Brother, you only.

373
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,962
No, we are going else where.
You go there.

00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,643
Is the road his father's property?

378
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,145
Tell him to remove it.
- Sir, it's Kuppatha's cart.

379

Hey, what is that nonsense?
Remove it.

00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,285

I will bury her here only.
Inside the well?

424
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,974
It's not our tradition.
Is your grandmother, Lord Ganesha?

425
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:02,313
Don't talk, I will bury
her on my land.

Don't I know my well? Who are you?
- Okay, you know it well.

Nallama Naicker will pay a
good price for your lands.

432
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,737
If you bury your grandma there,
it will lose value.

Will you arrest me if
I bury my grandma here?

434
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,004
Will police dare to arrest me?

435
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,340
Talk in low voice.
It's between us only.

I will not arrest you.

437
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,847
I said your lands
will lose value.

438
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,187
I have high regard

439
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,856
I have no regard for
anyone or anything else.

440
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,356
I don't care if it is Nallama Naicker
or Kothaala Thevar.

441
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,686
They are all here only.

442

Uncle, come here.

443
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:50,364
I and my uncle are going to do
agriculture on all my lands.

Are you going to do agriculture?

445
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,872
Me? No way. All I have to do
is go to a doctor.

446
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,374
Madam, please come, brother is
creating a scene there.

447
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,374
He will listen to you only.

448
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,377
You have made him to get drunk and
now you complain he's creating a scene.

449
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,050
Why are you killing me?
Come man.

450
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:08,878
Look there.

451
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,385
Virumaandi, why are you creating
a scene after getting drunk?

452
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,717
Village elders have come,
please come, son.

453
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,228
You all worship 3 Gods.

454
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,393
My grandma taught me
to worship 5 Gods.

455
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:26,059
Earth, water, sky, air, fire.
We must worship all 5 Gods.

456
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,000
It's famine if we earn the
wrath of any one God.

457
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,568
Upper pod is for home,
middle stem is for cattle.

458
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,908
Roots are for earth,
only when they spread inside,

459
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,081
look, water at 15 feet
for that reason only.

460
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:41,574
Wealthy people have sucked up
all water like blood sucking devils.

461
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:46,086
It has made others to use 250 feet
deep bore wells to suck out water.

462
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,418
No son, don't talk disrespectfully
about others.

463
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,924
Okay, I will not talk in front of you.
- Oh my dear son.

464
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:56,089
Elderly people, forgive me, I didn't
mean to disrespect you.

465
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,759
I will do agriculture here only,
get lost. - Go away.

<i>the grave dug for grandma.</i>

468
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,606
Village elders come here.
Come here.

469
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,111
I have called village elders,
why are you coming, uncle?

470
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,442
There is no such elder
in our house.

471
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,446
Please come here.

472
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,783
My grandma is Goddess.
It's offering of God. - Listen to me.

473
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:17,955
<i>You must perform her last rites.</i>

474
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,284
<i>If you get drunk & create a scene.</i>
<i>- Virumaandi... please stop son.</i>

475
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,619
<i>You can see it later, please come.</i>

476
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,855
<i>Come, I say.</i>

477
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,802
Did you see?

478
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:38,135
This isn't water.
This is my grandma's blood.

479
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,978
This land has been developed with
the blood of my grandma.

480
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,645
This is not land.

481
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,485
This is my grandmother's land.

482
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,646
Are you trying to
put a price for it?

483
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,482
This is not for sale.
This is my grandma's body.

484
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,487
I will never give it to you.

485
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,319
Don't talk like this.

486
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,166
Go away. Why are you
staring at me?

487
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,494
Go away... go away.
- Please come sir.

488
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,338
Bloody policeman.

489
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,340
This is my grandma's body.
Go away.

490
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:23,510
My grandma's body.

491
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:30,354
Who's that? Leave me... leave me.
You don't tie the garlands.

492
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,964
Enemity with Nallama Naicker
isn't good for us.

493
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,194
He's good for namesake only.
He is like a king cobra.

494
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,104
Even if Naicker leaves him,
he will drink to his death.

495
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,968
That will be good.
His land will become heirless.

496
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,767
But, village council is there in
Nallama Naickenur, isn't it?

497
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,305
Will Nallama Naicker spare it?

498
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,704
Won't you hand over the land on a platter
to Nallama Naicker by hook or crook?

499
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,711
Brother.
- Didn't you speak to him?

500
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,214
I was speaking to him about something
else. - I know you very well.

501
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,886
You were a chameleon from
our school days.

502
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,555
Brother, my police station is
in Nallama Naickenur.

503
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,050
But, my heart is in Chinnakolarpatti.

504
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,553
Thevar sir, ask me anything you want.

505
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,723
Betraying my caste people,
will I become a broker to Naicker?

506
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,058
I will take him to task.
- What can you do?

507
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,393
By now, Nallama Naicker would have
fixed a time & rung the bell.

They attacked Virumaandi.

I had expected this when
Nallama Naicker turned into his enemy.

537
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,866
Yes sir, they were Naicker's men only.

538
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,640
I couldn't see them
clearly in the darkness.

539
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,139
Even Nallama Naicker was
there with a sickle.

540
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,641
Mad man, you are accusing a village
elder without seeing him clearly.

541
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,144
You just now saw them, didn't you?

542
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,475
Do you want us to fight and
go for each other's neck?

543
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:23,142
Go man... take him away from here.
Hey, take him to a hospital.

544
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,652
Come... come... quickly.

545
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:29,652
This side... this side only
...here only.

546
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,832
Who is that? - Hey, keep quiet.

547
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:40,662
Sir!

548
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,498
...come here.

549
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:53,415
Hey, who is that?
I am asking, who is that?

550
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,683
What happened?
- Don't venture out.

551
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,856
Trouble has erupted between
Virumaandi & Nallama Naicker.

552
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:02,025
Hey, no one must venture out.
Don't allow children to go out.

553
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,352
Don't peep out.

554
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,195
Hey, close the door quickly.

555
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,194
<i>Move man. - Hey come,</i>
<i>let's go with him.</i>

556
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,865
Move man...

557
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,407
No one should get into the vehicle.

558
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,373
Sir, the sickle used to
kill him is missing.

559
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,049
It is an evidence.

560
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,543
Is sickle more important now?

561
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:29,879
It is all god's grace.

562

<i>I wouldn't have ended up in jail.</i>

564
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,891
<i>I prayed to God with utmost devotion</i>
<i>to save his life.</i>

565
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,222
<i>He came back after spending</i>
2 <i>months in hospital.</i>

566
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,898
<i>Did he leave me after that?</i>

567
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,160
<i>No, he came to me as soon as</i>
<i>he got out of the hospital.</i>

568
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,396
Hey, door has opened.

569
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,733
Hey, you all stay here only.
Sir has asked only you to come in.

570
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,573
<i>It will go for the tank only.</i>

571
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:54,904
<i>Hey, what?</i>

572
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,248
<i>Come Virumaandi.</i>

573
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,916
Greetings sir.
Are you fine?

574
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,243
<i>You are the right man to ask that.</i>

575
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:02,752
Greetings.

576
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,246
You carry on.

577
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,987
It's god grace.
Do you understand?

578
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,583
What are you looking at?

579
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:12,088
You refused to sell your lands.
I can't beg from anyone.

580
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,930
Whether it is 200 or 300 feet,

581
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,656
it will be my house, my well.
I will get water.

582
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,094
You will not get water.

583
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,095
Take your hands off me.

584
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,864
Leave it man, spoiling my dress.

585
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,936
Why will you not laugh?
You would have known, if you were dead.

586
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,775
If I had died, I wouldn't
have known anything.

587
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,115
Now, you will make fun
and taunt others.

588
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,277
I and Nallama Naicker,
both had asked you.

589
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,611
Did you see its result?

590
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,788
I am digging a well and
he has attacked you.

591
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,617
This is the difference between
a gentleman & a rogue.

592
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:45,626
Hey, take it inside, making noise!
We are in a discussion, aren't we?

593
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,962
It seems you didn't tell
anyone's name to the Police.

594
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,636
I'm asking you, ain't I?

595
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,968
I was drunk, so I couldn't
recognize the killer.

596
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,970
Entire village claims to have seen
and you say you didn't see him.

597
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,977
You lodge a complaint
against Nallama Naicker.

598
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,474
I will manage the rest of the show.

599
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,977
Nallama Naicker's men will come
to buy your lands. - Yes... yes...

600
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,149
Don't sell to them,
lands are yours, got it?

601
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,642
Are you going to use a razor?
It's summer time, it will burn.

602
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:14,324
No, it will be irritating.
Apply powder, it's summer time.

603
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,589
Where did I leave it?
Powder is under your arms.

604
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,992
Hey, keep quiet man.

605
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,498
Where? - Lands...

606
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,167
Sell your lands and
settle down in Madras.

607
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,833
You were in Singapore.
This place will not suit you.

608
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,005
Do you get me?
What are you saying?

609
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,504
You don't know what brought me here.

610
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,844
I am indebted to your entire family.

611
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,673
Money is no problem to me.
I have Rs.10 lakhs staked in the bank.

612
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,178
They are paying me interest
every month.

613
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:42,178
I came here to tell you that
all my lands & water is yours...

614
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,516
You are asking me to go away.

615
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,016
I want to become your partner.

616
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:51,956
My partner?

617
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,865
Why? - Asking me why?

618
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,861
Annalakshmi saved my life.

619
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,033
Annalakshmi had packed me
in coconut leaf mat,

620
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,705
and sent me to
the police station safely.

621
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,546
What is it uncle? (Paternal uncle).

622
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,381
This is not for you.

623
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,708
Is it true? - What?

624
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,044
Go away from here.
Give this to that big dog.

625
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,549
I am asking you, am I not?
- What?

626
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,311
This one.

627
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:18,889
Didn't you tell them?

628
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:24,892
Whether it is a donkey, a pup or a man.
Can I watch them die?

629
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,896
That dog will not bite.
Don't make noise.

630
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,070
You said it will not bite,
but it has bitten him.

631
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:38,738
<i>Hey, move away. - Why are you</i>
<i>playing the fool here? Go away.</i>

632
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,468
<i>What's that noise?</i>
<i>Did you switch on the Pump Motor?</i>

633
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,742
<i>Oh Honey beesl</i>

634
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,574
Gone! They had disturbed
the honey comb.

635
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,477
Brother, tie it in the cattle shed.

636
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:48,410
Do you have a match box?

637
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,586
Take it.

638
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,414
Excuse me...

639
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,926
Will you please untie that dog?

640
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,258
Will you give me a 'Beedi' please?
- Take it.

641
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,090
Why are you making so much
fuss for few honey bees?

642
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,926
Oh, they are stinging.

643
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,770
Hold it...
they won't harm anyone.

644
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,772
What is this, you have
untied the bull?

645
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,283
How much time will you
spend in water?

646
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,291
Catch her... catch her.

647
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,300
Sorimuthu, don't go away.
I will beat you.

648
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,303
Uncle, don't over-react.

649
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,472
Brother, Virumaandi & Annalakshmi
are coming back.

650
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,406
They has stung me also,
a wealthy & a powerful man.

651
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,976
Why is your face swollen?

652
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,147
<i>Annalakshmi is an innocent girl.</i>
<i>Young agel</i>

653
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,978
<i>Don't know what made her</i>
<i>to get close to him.</i>

654
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,815
<i>A man who tames raging bulls,</i>
<i>has talked his way to trap her.</i>

655
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,488
<i>I should have cut the budding</i>
<i>relationship then itself. I missed the chance.</i>

656
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:14,837
Serve...

657
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,174
Serve some more.

658
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:23,839
Don't know where all the food
is getting deposited?

659
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,175
Hey, don't make fun of a man
who eats without inhibition.

660
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,350
I am not making fun of anyone.

661
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:30,179
He is eating which I generally
cook for 5 people.

662
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,845
Hey Annalakshmi, keep quiet.
- Let her say, she's telling the truth.

663
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,852
Your food intake depends
on the cook.

664
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,188
Dear, you scold but
don't stop cooking for me.

665
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,864
Oh, won't you wash your
hands before eating?

666
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,863
Roaming in filthy areas,
you are ready to eat straightaway!

667
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,194
Get up! Wash your hands.

668
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,699
I have washed my hands, haven't I?

669
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,031
Whatever it is,
she'll not relent.

670
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,538
Go & wash your hands.
We are hungry... go.

671
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:52,804
Quickly.

672
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,373
Aunt, serve here.

673
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,208
<i>He is not feeling well,</i>
<i>he will not eat much.</i>

674
00:41:59,416 --> 00:41:59,882
Pour.

675
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,055
<i>I think you are a cannibal.</i>

676
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,553
You have blinded both my eyes.

677
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,725
Yuck... uncle, my eyes...

678
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,560
Go away. Wash your hands again.

679
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,729
<i>He's a sweet talker.</i>

680
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,494
<i>I too got charmed with his talk</i>
<i>and made him my pa</i>rt<i>ner.</i>

681
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,236
<i>Annalakshmi fell into his trap</i>
<i>like a fly in a cobweb.</i>

682
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:25,568
On the Eastern bank,

683
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:31,980
Your parents are lying
dead...

684
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:36,408
if you go there,
they will spread their wings,

685
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:41,087
Are you going there?

686
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,427
We are searching them and
they are roaming here.

687
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,761
<i>They say after going for sheep & cattle,</i>
<i>they will come for humans.</i>

688
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,104
<i>Like that, he manipulated</i>
<i>to get close to me.</i>

689
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,103
<i>I ignored it for the sake of Annalakshmi...</i>

690
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:01,103
<i>When I asked, "What will society</i>
<i>say about this affair?"</i>

691
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,337
<i>He got drunk and</i>
<i>came to kill me.</i>

692
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:10,953
Have you gone mad?

693
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,122
You keep quiet, let him talk.

694
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,348
If you talk disrespectfully,
I will not spare you.

695
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:22,791
Leave him.

696
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,125
Dear!

697
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,230
Oh no! Please leave him.

698
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,973
<i>If I had killed him that day,</i>

699
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,146
2<i>4 people wouldn't</i>
<i>have lost their lives unnecessarily.</i>

700
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,379
<i>Annalakshmi & my wife took up</i>
<i>cudgels on his behalf.</i>

701
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,586
<i>He still had few years to live,</i>
<i>so he survived that day.</i>

702
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,580
Hey, leave me.

703
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,655
<i>If you do wrong & seek forgiveness,</i>
<i>will the wrong become right?</i>

704
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,593
<i>I was a mad man.</i>

705
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,997
<i>I loved my brother's</i>
<i>daughter very much.</i>

706
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:54,823
<i>So, I took him under my wings again.</i>

707
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,500
Let the case get solved.
...you and Virumaan...

708
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,603
You and Annalakshmi are getting married.
This is my decision.

709
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,339
I will announce this in
tomorrow's council meeting also.

710
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,007
Tomorrow we are going to council
meeting at Nallama Naickenur.

711
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,507
No one will dare to touch you.
I will protect you.

712
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:08,678
Me? Get scared?

713
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,010
I knocked down Chinese men
also in Singapore.

714
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,183
Anyone with Chinese eyes is
not a Bruce Lee.

715
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,847
Nallama Naicker has called
for a council meeting.

716
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,679
You are saying as if Tirumalai Naicker
has called a meeting.

717
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,081
<i>Hey, stop it boys.</i>

718
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:24,520
My son Peddarasu
is attending the court everyday,

719
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,089
because he is an advocate.

720
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,627
I went to court 18 years ago.

721
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,296
If your father had been alive,
he would've told you.

722
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,695
You see Kothaala Thevar sitting there.

723
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,372
I tried for a compromise between your
father & his father Thavasi Thevar,

724
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,767
but it ended in a big fight.

725
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,642
Thavasi Thevar was the first to take
out the sickle, I killed him.

726
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,879
When I came back from
jail after 4 years,

727
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,379
I made a vow never to touch weapon
or step into a court again.

728
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,050
I am still following it.

729
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,447
That's why, people have accepted
me as their leader.

730
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:55,714
Because of that vow you and
Kothaala Thevar are still alive.

731
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,054
Oh! If you say I am still alive
because of your mercy,

732
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,231
and my life is like the night soil,
I don't want it.

733
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,401
Come, let's settle it personally.
Is any one ready?

734
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,068
Don't throw challenges and...

735
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,899
Hey, my son will not touch
a weapon, if he does,

736
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:13,573
my son who had saved your
father will kill you.

737
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,242
Mother keep quiet.
Have you gone mad?

738
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,478
Don't incite people here
with your theatrics.

739
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,579
It's just a false case,
so withdraw your complaint.

740
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,915
Which case are you saying is false?

741
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,089
You tried to buy my lands,
I refused to sell.

742
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,262
You tried to kill me.

743
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:33,421
Hey, keep quiet.

744
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,262
Weapon as well as my mouth,
both will do the talking.

745
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,033
I am telling here, listen carefully.
- Go ahead son-in-law.

746
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,604
Even if you offer millions,
I will not sell my lands.

747
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,276
Look, Coimbatore Kondarasu
is sitting there.

748
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,603
Even his wells have plenty of water.

749
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,609
If you are so thirsty, why don't
you quench it from his wells?

750
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,505
He will sell anything.

751
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,951
Are you insinuating that I am ready
to sell anything?

752
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:59,119
The Poker faced Kothaala Thevar
who is sitting behind you,

753
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,052
will sell anything.

754
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,784
You will lose your honour.

755
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,460
Don't make a witness an enemy.

756
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,797
Kothaala, if you have guts,
fight directly.

757
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,466
Why are you attacking hiding
behind Virumaandi?

758
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,134
This is a council of gentlemen.

759
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,634
Hey, why are you talking to him?

760
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,802
I had lodged the complaint.
Talk to me.

761
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,975
What do you say
this is a council of gentlemen?

762
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:19,972
I am also a gentleman.

763
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,142
I am announcing in this
council meeting.

764
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,214
I will write off a part of the
property for public cause.

765
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,814
Ask Naicker also to
donate his property,

766
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:28,985
then I will accept him as a gentleman.

767
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,313
Hey Son-in-law, do you know
what you are talking? - Keep quiet.

768
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,489
You are talking about donating
for public cause.

769
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,817
No sweat. Will he take it with him
in the grave? He will donate.

770
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:36,822
I am announcing publicly,

771
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:40,656
a part of my land and the well which
has water at 15 feet,

772
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,764
I am bequeathing it to the
people of Chinnakolarpatti.

773
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,660
I will give it in writing,
will Naicker also do it?

774
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,428
What do you want him to donate?

775
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,168
Once upon a time when
'Zamindari' system was in vogue,

776
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,170
this entire village belonged to him.

777
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,842
He has already donated this village.

778
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,174
You are now speaking in anger.

779
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,512
You will back off when it actually
comes to writing on the paper.

780
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,511
For me, word given is paper and
decision is the pen.

781
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:03,515
Once said means it is a promise.

782
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,517
If Naicker doesn't want to donate,
forget about that.

783
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,691
Kondarasu, who is his sidekick,
tell him to donate the land.

784
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,856
You say Naicker had
donated this village.

785
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,359
You got it as charity.
Please return it to him.

786
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,691
He's thirsty for water, isn't he?
Dirty 'Dhothi' wearing landlord.

787
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,194
How are qualified to badmouth him?

788
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,870
What right do you have to
talk about him? Shut up.

789
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,536
If he is dirty 'Dhothi',
you are dirt.

790
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,539
Wait... wait... let him talk.

791
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,045
Are you talking about our father?

792
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,704
Didn't they kick you & throw you
out from Singapore?

793
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:36,374
I know everything about you.
I know every bit of you.

794
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:40,223
Great! It seems he knows
everything about me.

795
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:41,550
Okay, if you know everything about me,

796
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,726
I have an itch somewhere,
tell me where it is itching?

797
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,895
I don't know where you are
feeling the itch?

798
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,897
But, I know if Kothaala Thevar
feels the itch.

799
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,229
You are thing to scratch it with.
I know that very well.

800
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,406
I am not a thing,
I am a relative.

801
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,904
Let Naicker tell me,

802
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,076
I will give away my entire
property to anyone.

803
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,244
I will give away my property.

804
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,414
But, I will not discard my relatives
for property like Kothaala Thevar.

805
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,913
He wants your land, your well,

806
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,914
for that he handed over his
brother's daughter Annalakshmi.

807
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,917
He will hand over his wife also
for more property.

808
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,090
Hey Kondarasu, what is this?
- Wait, I will finish.

809
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,428
He says he'll give up his wife
also for other's property.

810
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,103
I am warning all of you.
Disperse peacefully.

811
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,107
I will kill you.

812
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,779
Put it down. Put it down.

813
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,274
You have a weapon.
My hands are empty.

814
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:42,350
I will rip you apart with bare hands.
I have iron hands.

815
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,122
Go... go...

816
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:48,347
Keep quiet.

817
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,293
Go... go man. Take him away.

818
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,803
<i>I don't know whether it is</i>
<i>true or false,</i>

819
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,310
<i>but fate had decided to play with me.</i>

820
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:11,811
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>bad times befell on me.</i>

821
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,483
Hey, get in...

822
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,315
Sir, no one has seen it.

823
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,390
<i>I took every insult in</i>
<i>my stride for him.</i>

824
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,820
Hey, go inside...

825
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:46,676
He abused me & you. We should have
ripped him apart there itself.

826
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,511
Why did you stop me?

827
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:53,014
Can he accuse you of becoming a
pimp to your wife?

828
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,349
Shouldn't you have killed him
then & there itself?

829
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,026
Do you know the meaning of his words?
- Hey, keep quiet man.

830
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:00,526
He said only once and he's
painting the village red with it.

831
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,368
Annam is coming.
Don't tell her anything.

832
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:06,695
She will scold me for
picking up a fight.

833
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,201
Look, I have to get scolded
by a young girl for you.

834
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:12,534
Uncle, did you go and
create trouble there?

835
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,538
No, I didn't do anything.
Tell her, son-in-law.

836
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,545
You now say tell her, earlier you
had accused me of having a loose tongue.

837
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,877
Okay, your aunty...
...his wife...

838
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,211
Oh God! - What oh God?

839
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,216
Don't touch it.

840
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,214
Who is that?

841
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:32,384
It's Lord Rama's slipper. Ponnarasu is
going to coronate it, right?

842
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,563
Will you please come aside?
- Where?

843
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:36,660
Why?

844
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,395
Why?

845
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,902
I am asking you why and
you are just walking away.

846
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,409
Look at her anger.
I will find out & come.

847
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,912
You keep the sickle ready.
That man.

848
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,912
You wanted to sacrifice a goat,
didn't you? - Yes.

849
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,752
I will give you Kondarasu.
- You will do it.

850
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:00,752
You will eat that also.

851
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:05,155
<i>Generally a man's anger must subside</i>
<i>after few words of wisdom.</i>

852
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:09,254
<i>He is like wild forest fire.</i>

853
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,596
Hey Virumaandi is missing.

854
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,103
Hey Kottasami... hey, Achi... get up.

855
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,274
Pick up your weapons.

856
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,942
Son-in-law has gone out.

857
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,946
Virumaandi has gone out alone.
We must rush to save his life.

858
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,444
<i>Before we could reach there.</i>

859
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,382
<i>Virumaandi sta</i>rt<i>ed to</i>
<i>hack & stab people.</i>

860
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,783
<i>We had no choice but</i>
<i>to join the fight with him.</i>

861
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,285
Hey come on boys.

862
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,123
Leave him sir, I will
take care of him.

863
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,526
Hey traitor!

864
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,302
Please save me.

865
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,969
Don't stand & watch the fun,
go & kill them.

866
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:51,640
Son-in-law!

867
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,641
<i>Before I could bat my eye,</i>
<i>he killed Kondarasu barbarously.</i>

868
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,479
<i>Don't spare anyone...</i>
<i>- Come... come.</i>

869
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,809
<i>In that enraged mood he couldn't</i>
<i>understand my sane advice.</i>

870
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,143
<i>He pounced on me.</i>

871
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,887
<i>Before I could control him, my men</i>
<i>killed everyone there.</i>

872
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,831
Don't spare anyone.
Kill everyone here.

873
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:16,991
Whom are you playing the fool with?

874
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,499
<i>Enraged Virumaandi lost the</i>
<i>sense of justice & fairness.</i>

875
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,001
Sir, it's infant... leave him.

876
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,834
Oh my child has fallen into
the well. Please save him.

877
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,840
<i>Before his anger calmed down,</i>
<i>many people had lost their lives.</i>

878
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,842
Get up. Why are you guys fighting?

879
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,674
<i>He has accepted in public</i>
<i>that he is my relative.</i>

880
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,684
<i>Now, we can't abandon him up even</i>
<i>if he's a murderer, can we?</i>

881
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,521
Go... go.

882
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,691
Go man. Has he gone mad?
- Go man.

883
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,359
He's beating me. - Go man.

884
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,857
We have come here to save you.

885
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,525
What the hell! Will you save my life?

886
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,858
Leave him, I will kill him.

887
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,465
Hey keep quiet.

888
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,370
Hey, look!

889
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,870
Hey, he is running. - Kill him.

890
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,268
Don't spare him.

891
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:04,377
Catch him... catch him.

892
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,210
You have helped a witness to run away.
Have you gone mad?

893
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,551
He's going that side.
- He's running... catch him.

894
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:13,890
I am coming.

895
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,386
Oh my grand son.

896
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,910
What did an innocent child do?

897
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,239
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

898
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:39,578
<i>You didn't do anything,</i>

899
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,308
<i>but some one else committed all these</i>
<i>murders in your name.</i>

900
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,745
I am telling you,
I didn't do anything.

901
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,582
Wait, you have accepted you
were with us, haven't you?

902
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,087
Why are you denying it now?

903
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,986
You mustn't lie.

904
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,427
Leave him... listen to me...

905
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,103
Look, he has picked up a spade.

906
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:07,609
Look here.

907
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:12,672
Hey Virumaa... come with me,
listen to me.

908
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,882
Go & see what's it.

909
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,290
Look, police have arrived.

910
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,619
Oh no, don't make me a widow,
say all this later.

911
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,963
Virumaan is innocent.
Nothing will happen to him.

912
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,797
Son-in-law, I will accept the crime
to prove your innocence, then?

913
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:32,634
I...

914
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:35,967
Greetings.

915
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:39,641
Sir.

916
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,642
What is it, Kottasami?
- Nothing sir.

917
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:44,814
Nothing?

918
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,811
Ridiculous. - I have brought the witness.

919
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,813
Shall I inquire here
or at police station?

920
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,156
Let it be here only.

921
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:56,716
Go. - Come... come.

922
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,824
Mr. Advocate, you too go inside.
You need to talk, don't you?

923
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,597
Virumaandi, don't get scared.
I will take care.

924
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,832
Eye-witness Ramarasu has
come here trusting us.

925
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,333
We must protect him.

926
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,693
You repeat the same what had been
tutored to you. Judge is a good man.

927
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:35,865
Witness Ramarasu...

928
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,031
Silence please.

929
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,035
Order... order.

930
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,707
Mr. Naicker, what is this?
Tell them to keep quiet.

931
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:46,876
Hey, what is this man?

932
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:51,373
You were with Kondarasu on the day
this incident took place, weren't you?

933
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,378
No sir, I had gone to
Madurai on that day.

934
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,882
Did you go to Madurai or
Kothaala Thevar's house to collect money?

935
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,720
I strongly object, your honour.

936
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,784
What are you objecting to?

937
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,786
Objection sustained.

938
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,919
You know about Nallama Naicker trying to
buy Virumaandi's lands, don't you?

939
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,099
No use of shaking head. Say yes.
- Yes sir.

940
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:15,564
It ended up in a fight,
do you know that? - Yes sir.

941
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:19,466
Regarding the same issue Nallama Naicker
attacked Virumaandi,

942
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,268
a case pertaining to it is
pending in the same court.

943
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,338
Do you know it? - Yes.
- Your Honour.

944
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,309
Both are different cases.

945
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,381
The line of examination is not
at all pertinent to this case.

946
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,576
No, your honour. It is very
pertinent.

947
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:31,744
Thank you.

948
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,252
What did he say? - He said pertinent.
- He says pertinent. - Finished!

949
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:36,985
God save him.

950
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:43,862
Do you know about Naicker trying to buy
back Kondarasu's lands donated by him?

951
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:44,959
Yes sir.

952
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,535
Did Kondarasu sell back his
lands to Nallama Naicker?

953
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,098
No.

954
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:54,807
The anger which Naicker showed on
Virumaandi for refusing to sell lands,

955
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,774
he could have shown the same anger
on Kondarasu also, couldn't he?

956
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:58,646
Answer me.

957
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,145
He could have, sir.

958
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,045
On the complaint of Nallama Naicker,

959
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,722
under section 302 persons arrested are,

960
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:10,789
Virumaandi Thevar,
Kothaala Thevar, Kottasami.

961
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:16,330
Rasikalai, Chinna Karuppu,
Kodangi and others.

962
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,593
There is no evidence to prove that
they are the culprits.

963
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,631
This court absolves them of the crime
and releases them,

964
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:29,968
and I order the police to investigate
and apprehend the real culprits.

965
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,306
The entire village spat on him.

966
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,142
But, I got him exonerated from the murder
charges as he was my partner.

967
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,618
I didn't expect him to be loyal,

968
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,754
but can he betray me? Tell me?
Forget about me.

969
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,150
Could he betray Annalakshmi?
He did.

970
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,049
If he had asked me, I would've
got her married to him.

971
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,727
He is happy in plundering anything.

972
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,663
If she was from a poor family,
she would've given in to him.

973
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,162
Annalakshmi is from a wealthy family.

974
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,059
She didn't give in to his lust,
so he kidnapped her.

975
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,032
I had brought her up fondly.

976
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,432
He tortured and beat her...

977
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,076
He tried to enact a
drama and escape.

978
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:07,341
It didn't materialize,

979
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,875
justice prevailed.

980
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,948
I shouldn't be saying all this.

981
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,583
Don't show it on T.V.

982
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:19,626
Girl's matter...

983
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,387
No... cut it, Girish.

984
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,459
Are you finished? - Yes.

985
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,694
Come, Kothaala.

986
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,700
They say our life will get shorter
if we get photographed.

987
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,570
I escaped from the gallows and
got a life-term.

988
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,009
Photograph nicely.

989
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,970
When will it be telecast?

990
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,907
I will tell you. You come with me.

991
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,612
Hey, after locking this man
in the cell, you open his cell.

992
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,520
If we allow both of them to face
each other... it will be trouble.

993
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,153
Dangerous criminals, madam.

994
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,826
I have heard that you are from Thanjavur.

995
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,492
Are you from Tanjore?

996
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,661
No Keezvenmani.

997
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:16,310
Sit down.

998
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,312
Sit down.

999
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,788
Behave properly.

1000
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,753
If you create any problem...

1001
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,155
Got it.

1002
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:29,763
Don't stare at me.

1003
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,223
We are all a kind of weapon.

1004
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:33,530
Interview.

1005
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:34,928
This is going to be
shown on T.V.

1006
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,996
Can we see what you have
recorded till now?

1007
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:40,601
Why?

1008
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:44,370
Not for me. He'll be executed within
2 weeks. That's why.

1009
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,784
I'll show it to him once I complete
the shooting. - Right.

1010
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,676
Now, if you don't mind...

1011
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,855
Even you are related to this case.

1012
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,047
So, if you can go out...

1013
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:08,432
You can see in this.

1014
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:11,964
Once I finish recording your statement,
I'll show it to you.

1015
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:14,641
Now, it might distract you.

1016
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,411
Can we start? Switch on.

1017
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:22,543
Roll...

1018
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:25,913
Ready.

1019
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,255
Tell me your opinion about
death penalty.

1020
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,658
Sorry madam.
Is everything alright?

1021
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,025
I've posted a warden outside.
- Okay, thank you.

1022
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:41,997
You had kidnapped Annalakshmi
and raped her.

1023
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,602
After that...

1024
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,006
Okay, leave it.

1025
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,866
There must be a reason for everything.

1026
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,841
What's the reason behind this?
- Can I ask you a question? - What?

1027
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,943
Can I ask you a question? - Yes.

1028
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,220
What is the size of your Bra?
- What?

1029
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,248
Size...

1030
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,516
Switch it off.

1031
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,256
Virumaandi, I've come here
on humanitarian grounds.

1032
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,097
I believe that death sentence is not
the right punishment for a murder.

1033
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,870
I'm not a rich woman to do
social service to pass time.

1034
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,006
I want death sentence
to be abolished.

1035
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,569
So, respect my views.

1036
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,845
Ask me some decent questions.

1037
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:29,207
Answer my question.
- Look, answer her questions.

1038
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:36,882
No. I can't answer your question.
- Why?

1039
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,020
When you go to a shop to buy Bra,

1040
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,220
won't you tell the size
to the shop keeper?

1041
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:43,960
I'll tell it to a shopkeeper.

1042
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,296
But to a rogue who had
raped a girl...

1043
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:47,728
Sorry.

1044
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,865
I won't tell a man
who had raped a girl.

1045
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:55,670
Similarly, I've told
everything in the court.

1046
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,813
I don't need to repeat all that to a
bitch who has come with a camera.

1047
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,916
Warden... - Don't get angry.
- I meant her & not you. - Warden...

1048
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,448
What's it, madam? - Nothing.

1049
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:07,646
I understand.

1050
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,519
What are you going to gain
if I answer such question?

1051
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:15,928
This will be a lesson to some
like you, that's why.

1052
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,896
Take your camera & get lost.

1053
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:19,761
Warden...

1054
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,798
If you call them, will they hang me?
I'll call them.

1055
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:25,098
Hey, you wardens...

1056
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,233
Hey, you Virumaandi...

1057
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,003
Tell the Inspector that I don't want
to talk to them.

1058
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,043
Put me back in the cell.

1059
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,407
Okay madam. Come let's go.

1060
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,110
Girish, will you just listen to me?
One minute, please wait...

1061
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:39,450
Why?

1062
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,447
Whom are you angry with?

1063
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,691
Why are you so angry even when
you are facing death?

1064
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,017
Is your anger a manifestation
of your fear of death?

1065
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,286
What do you know about death?

1066
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,394
Hey Virumaandi...

1067
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,969
Now I have understood that
you all are aware of fear.

1068
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:57,431
I don't know what it is.

1069
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:58,867
That was my crime.

1070
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,168
Switch off the light.
I told you not to record.

1071
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,777
Anger, justice, death penalty,

1072
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,545
Annalakshmi, myself, noose tightens
and I die.

1073
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:12,846
Do you know what these things are?

1074
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:13,851
If you read these things in books,

1075
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,148
you will not understand. You will not
know what they are. - I can understand.

1076
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,384
I know. - What do you know?
- Listen to what I say.

1077
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,559
My father was hanged
to death in this jail.

1078
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:26,467
His name is Kathamuthu.

1079
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,767
He toiled hard & educated me.

1080
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,405
He took loans & performed my marriage.

1081
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,735
I became Angela James.

1082
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:35,833
Later, to save me,

1083
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:40,078
he killed James, accepted his crime.
He came here & died.

1084
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:45,684
I again became Angela Kathamuthu.
Doctor Angela Kathamuthu.

1085
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,352
Doctorate in Civil law.

1086
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,857
I also know what is death penalty and
what happens when noose tightens.

1087
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:57,156
Madam...

1088
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,665
No. Please wait outside.

1089
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:05,200
Tell us if there is any trouble. The door
is open & we are waiting outside.

1090
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:18,383
Do you know what it is? - No.
- Tell me, do you know what it is?

1091
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,557
No. I don't. Tell me.

1092
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,655
My life line.

1093
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:25,560
My fate.

1094
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,354
It brings back memories of Annalakshmi.
Her nail.

1095
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,160
They would've said that
I had raped Annalakshmi.

1096
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,966
Do you know who is Annalakshmi?

1097
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:40,405
She is my wife.

1098
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,238
If she had been with me,
I wouldn't have been here.

1099
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,748
If she had given testimony,
all lies would have been defeated.

1100
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,513
Fate.

1101
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,651
I was ill fated.

1102
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,727
My mother died when I was 12,

1103
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,690
after that, my father
took me to Singapore.

1104
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,760
I was living happily there.

1105
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,296
He too died.

1106
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,110
I had some problems over there and
I was forced to come back here again.

1107
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,873
My grandmother brought me up.

1108
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:23,308
She brought me up like a bull.

1109
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:30,189
When man experiences happiness,
he doesn't know what it is?

1110
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,825
Only when it is lost...

1111
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:45,369
After winning many prizes in
'Taming the Bull' competitions.

1112
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,804
My friends & I got drunk,
and were returning home.

1113
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:48,635
Pour...

1114
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:51,142
Drink... drink.

1115
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,542
The bull had gored with it's horns...

1116
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:54,443
Is this good liquor?

1117
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:57,544
Oh grandma!

1118
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:01,147
If you want the bulls to gore you...

1119
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,619
If you want to die that way,
take it from me.

1120
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,559
Look at his face.

1121
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,093
Were you showing your back
for it to attack?

1122
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,492
Oh my God blood! - I have blood
that's why it is bleeding. Forget it.

1123
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,494
Fix pipes & give it to others.

1124
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,998
I caught the bull & turned back.
But it hit me. What to do?

1125
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:17,729
You would've turned back
and ogled at girls.

1126
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:20,841
Don't laugh.

1127
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,603
Don't scold a grown up boy.
Take this, Virumaandi.

1128
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,111
Priest, I don't care who you are...
Get lost.

1129
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:31,016
I told you to watch the amusement
standing on the electricity pole.

1130
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,017
Did I ask you to come here?

1131
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,019
Electricity pole!
To die of electric shock?

1132
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,521
To hell with your bloody mouth.

1133
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,853
If he dies, I must suffer all alone.

1134
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,291
Someday we all have to die.

1135
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,863
Hey mike! I'll pull that, be careful.

1136
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,693
You always pull things.
Come & take your prize.

1137
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:50,531
To hell with your bloody prize.
If he dies, can you bring him back to life?

1138
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,765
Tell me, can you bring him
back to life? We will give.

1139
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,067
We will give you lot of money.
We will get you money from our boss.

1140
01:06:56,345 --> 01:07:00,873
Sell your land to my boss.
Lets name our grandchildren & die.

1141
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:01,879
We?

1142
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:03,210
Will you accompany me?

1143
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:06,555
You ugly black dog.

1144
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,156
Should I sell my land to you?

1145
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:12,656
You will add western fertilizers
and ruin my lands.

1146
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,727
Our agriculture is different.

1147
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,889
Only my grandson must cultivate my land.

1148
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,899
Don't think he doesn't know anything.
I'll teach him.

1149
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:27,132
I taught his father too. Never underestimate
him & brand him as a wastrel.

1150
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,742
He is very clever.

1151
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:29,740
Like you...

1152
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,914
Hey you wastrel.
You useless fellow, let's go.

1153
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:34,378
Grandma, 3 of us.

1154
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,414
Can't your bike carry 3 persons?

1155
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,086
Why do you keep it with you then?

1156
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,084
Where's your chain?
- Here it is.

1157
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,416
She won't forget. Start...

1158
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:44,088
Shall we go?

1159
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,419
I am sitting in the middle. - Okay.

1160
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,255
Let this bull sit at the back.
- Okay.

1161
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,430
Have you sat? Let's go.

1162
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:52,089
Yes, grand mother.
I'm holding you.

1163
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:56,601
I'm coming with you.
Oh my grandmother! Go...

1164
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,433
Give it to him.

1165
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,602
<i>On top of the Banyan tree,</i>

1166
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:05,440
<i>There are beautiful birds.</i>

1167
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:09,277
<i>Males & females,</i>

1168
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:19,121
<i>to make love... come.</i>

1169
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,454
Let's go home.

1170
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:24,622
I'll kill you if you go home.
All of you come, eat & go.

1171
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:31,796
Don't shout. - Grandmother...
I tamed Kothaala Thevar's bull.

1172
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,471
They gave Rs.1000 as prize money.

1173
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,576
It is now fit only for milking.

1174
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,976
She is sleeping.

1175
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,977
Is she?

1176
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:48,251
Don't act as if you are sleeping.
I'll act as if it is true.

1177
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:52,291
Now I'm going to blow a
conch on your navel.

1178
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,826
Rs.1000 & Red bananas.

1179
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,498
We have won them.

1180
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,828
Look at her acting.
Are you trying to act smart with me?

1181
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:05,996
I'll pour water on your face.
- Don't do it. She might die.

1182
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,673
She's not getting up even
after pouring water on her.

1183
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:09,674
Check, what has happened to her?

1184
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:22,448
Keep quiet, don't cry.
Don't shake your hands.

1185
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:33,028
Let's take her to the hospital.

1186
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,037
Are you playing the fool,
you scoundrel?

1187
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:40,603
She has left me.
Can't you see?

1188
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:49,706
What did you say?

1189
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:53,048
What did you say when
my father died?

1190
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,154
You said you are keeping alive only to
perform this orphan's marriage.

1191
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,793
You said you will die only
after my marriage.

1192
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:05,795
My mother is also dead.
What am I to do now? Tell me.

1193
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:10,730
You lied to me that you'll
live for another 10, 15, 25 years.

1194
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,504
You said that you'll live till
my son goes to college,

1195
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,075
and die on the way to his college.

1196
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:19,247
She said all this, didn't she? She even
smiled. I believed her words.

1197
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:30,091
What am I to do now?
You old woman! Get up.

1198
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:41,100
My mother, what am I to do now?

1199
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,997
She left me... my mother.

1200
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:53,605
<i>Who lit the lamp in the street?</i>

1201
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:12,791
<i>Who tied the jasmine to the fence?</i>

1202
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,466
<i>When it thunders in the east,</i>

1203
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:22,975
<i>will it rain in the west? Oh my motherl</i>

1204
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:29,310
<i>You pampered me and now, is it</i>
<i>fair to leave me alone?</i>

1205
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,817
<i>You never got tired.</i>

1206
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:36,480
<i>Now, you are dead.</i>
<i>How can I bear this loss?</i>

1207
01:11:47,136 --> 01:12:24,705
<i>AYNGARAN DVD</i>

1208
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:31,804
<i>I'm a wastrel without a job.</i>

1209
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:38,544
<i>You toiled hard to bring me up</i>
<i>and it has all gone in vain.</i>

1210
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:49,057
<i>You flowed like a river.</i>
<i>I was a wastrel.</i>

1211
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:55,897
<i>Though I'm stone hea</i>rt<i>ed,</i>
<i>yet I'm crying.</i>

1212
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:06,070
<i>I've not repaid the debt I owe you.</i>
<i>You have left me as an Orphan.</i>

1213
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,580
<i>You never said a word</i>
<i>before you left me.</i>

1214
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,845
<i>I don't have anyone</i>
<i>to share my grief.</i>

1215
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:17,754
<i>O my motherl Tell me what</i>
<i>was in your mind.</i>

1216
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,088
<i>I've no peace of mind.</i>

1217
01:13:56,331 --> 01:14:00,461
<i>Our men fight for land & women.</i>

1218
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:05,636
<i>I was attacked for the land</i>
<i>and water in that land.</i>

1219
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:22,418
Who's that?

1220
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:31,999
Go.

1221
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,009
<i>He went this way. I saw him.</i>

1222
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,186
<i>Who unchained our dog?</i>

1223
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,854
Who is it? - What happened?

1224
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:57,855
<i>Don't come out.</i>

1225
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,857
<i>Fight between</i>
<i>Nallama Naicker & Virumaandi.</i>

1226
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:03,031
<i>Don't come out.</i>
<i>Don't let children come out.</i>

1227
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,029
<i>Close the door, quickly.</i>

1228
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:14,542
Wait...

1229
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,874
Hey Virumaandi...

1230
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:28,082
I had warned you earlier.
But you never listened to me.

1231
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:32,219
Who hacked you?
I must file an F.I.R.

1232
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:35,726
<i>As long as I was in the hospital,</i>

1233
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,559
<i>I felt that Annalakshmi</i>
<i>gave me my life back.</i>

1234
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,069
<i>I was on bed for couple of months.</i>

1235
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,897
You tamed the bull.

1236
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,903
But, were you able to
tame your heart?

1237
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,399
She's a nice girl...

1238
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:52,410
<i>I dreamt, that grandma & Annalakshmi</i>
<i>were taking care of me. - Give this to her,</i>

1239
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:57,415
and you keep the money which is
on my fore head. - You have it.

1240
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:02,579
Take this pill Virumaandi.
Your pain will reduce.

1241
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,589
Sister, give this pill.

1242
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,428
Open your mouth.

1243
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:10,689
Your friends have come
to see you. Come.

1244
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:14,932
Are you fine?
- Do you want anything?

1245
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:20,269
Annalakshmi...
- Wow! He wants Annalakshmi...

1246
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:23,604
<i>After getting discharged</i>
<i>from the hospital,</i>

1247
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,178
<i>I went straight to</i>
<i>Annalakshmi's house.</i>

1248
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,783
<i>My grandmother was right.</i>

1249
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:31,377
<i>I tamed the bull,</i>
<i>but could not tame my hea</i>rt.

1250
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,045
The bull has come under our control.
- Yes.

1251
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:37,622
The bull has come under our control.
But that girl...

1252
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,624
I'll hack you if the bull is hurt.

1253
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:43,297
She says she will cut you.
You are going to become 'Briyani'.

1254
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:45,625
I meant you & not the bull.

1255
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:47,866
Come here. - Yes, I'm.

1256
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,300
I called the bull.
- Bull?

1257
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:54,301
She is calling you, isn't she?
- Come... - Go.

1258
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:58,878
Wow! It is under his command.
- Yes, it is under his command. Stop.

1259
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,308
Wow! It is under my command.

1260
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,648
Tried to behave so wildly.
You donkey!

1261
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,320
Oh! She says it is a donkey.

1262
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,648
We thought that it was
a bull & it won prizes also.

1263
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:11,223
If you talk any more,
I'll cut your tongue.

1264
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,823
He is saying that he's dumb
and wants you to hack him.

1265
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,829
He wants you to spare him.
- Keep quiet.

1266
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,433
It's getting scared. - Which one?

1267
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,398
I meant the bull.

1268
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,168
Look, these guys are also using
double meaning words.

1269
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,170
What's all this?
The village is in bad state.

1270
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,501
Give me my pant. - Here.

1271
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:29,601
When a girl & a bull(man) are alone,

1272
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,006
villagers might talk bad about them.
- Yes, let's go.

1273
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,681
That's why I'm going with the bull.

1274
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:35,110
I must save her reputation.

1275
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,682
You must save the bull's
reputation also.

1276
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:38,682
You go.

1277
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:43,119
Wear the pant first.
Then we'll go peacefully. - Go away.

1278
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,857
Keep quiet. Let them unite...

1279
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,360
Take your hands off the bike.

1280
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:51,464
I tried to push because,
I found a hump on the road.

1281
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,531
You are getting angry.

1282
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,862
I came to thank you,
but you are shouting at me.

1283
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,538
Why are you talking
to me unnecessarily?

1284
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,707
You gave me life.
What's wrong in talking to you.

1285
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,876
No use of talking to me.
Go away.

1286
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,538
Where do you want me to go?
- My home is here.

1287
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,543
You've to cross the railway gate
to go to your house.

1288
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:12,710
What's it?

1289
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,885
Hey, what are you doing?
- I thought of repairing it.

1290
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,228
Rub the spark plug & it'll start.

1291
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,062
You'll come near me under the
pretext of repairing it.

1292
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,663
You'll rub against me in the
name of rubbing the spark plug,

1293
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,730
and you want me to fall
for you, don't you?

1294
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,895
I don't need anything.
I'll go like this.

1295
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,738
It's your wish.
- Don't get hacked again.

1296
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:34,238
Whom will you marry after hacking me?

1297
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,968
Look what he says!
As if I'm after you to marry me.

1298
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,578
I'm going to get married
in a rich family,

1299
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,906
and live like a queen.

1300
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,582
How can I marry a
reckless man like you?

1301
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:43,307
What's wrong if you
marry a reckless man?

1302
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,418
You'll give birth to tiger cubs.
- No thanks. Humans will be okay.

1303
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:49,583
Okay, no problem.
How many do you want?

1304
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,519
Looks like you will take care of my
delivery & name the children too.

1305
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:53,422
Why not?

1306
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,591
Pulliyeru Pandian. - What's that?

1307
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,094
My father's name... to our child.

1308
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:58,266
No one can utter that name.

1309
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,593
If you want it to be uttered,

1310
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:00,768
we can name our child as banana.

1311
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,937
Since it is going to be our child.
Shall we name him as Red banana?

1312
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,031
Look at her, she's laughing.

1313
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:07,435
Chandra Bose. - What?

1314
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:08,442
Name.

1315
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,209
Keep quiet, I'll name my
child Tendulkar.

1316
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:13,944
It doesn't sound a familiar name.

1317
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,208
Is Chandra Bose your neighbour's name?

1318
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,282
But, he's such a great man!

1319
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:18,544
What great man?

1320
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,881
Will he slam centuries?
Will he hit sixes?

1321
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:23,624
No. He could hit only the Britishers.

1322
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,622
Soorimuthu... - Take your hand off
the bull.

1323
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,621
The train is about to come and
it may get crushed under it.

1324
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:30,457
Yes, it's coming to hit my bull.

1325
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:33,065
You are right, you are always right.

1326
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,964
Okay. We will name him Tendulkar.

1327
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:40,301
If you accuse your husband of not
allowing you to name the child Tendulkar.

1328
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:41,305
It will be a disgrace to me.

1329
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,637
What's the nick name of Tendulkar?
Is it tent?

1330
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:45,472
Shit! - What's it?

1331
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,671
I must curse myself for discussing
my child's name with you.

1332
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,474
Wow! She has understood.
- I told you not to touch the bull.

1333
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,650
Let me atleast touch the bull.

1334
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,650
You shameless bull.
Why are you after him?

1335
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:57,984
Come home. I'll lash you.

1336
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,657
Shall I come home? Will there be
something for me too?

1337
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:02,159
What? - I'll come there often.

1338
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:05,993
Why? - I & your uncle have
become friends.

1339
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,327
I may have to come there often.

1340
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,162
You haven't yet reformed even
after God saved your life.

1341
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,734
Out of frying pan into the fire.

1342
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:13,837
You are one of those.

1343
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:18,502
Look, what she is saying!
Are others going to live for 1000 years?

1344
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,682

The goat has shaken it's head. Slaughter.

1375
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:12,072
They searched for you at the
place where goats are sacrificed.

1376
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:12,837
You were not available.

1377
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,072
Do you know that they sacrificed
it without you?

1378
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:14,873
I know.

1379
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:16,749
Then why are you sitting here?

1380
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:18,677
I don't like it.

1381
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:20,312
Sacrificing the goat?

1382
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:21,480
Yes.

1383
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:22,984
You cooked meat yesterday.

1384
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,590
Today, you say you don't like it.

1385
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,551
You can cook meat only
after killing the goat.

1386
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:27,489
That's different.

1387
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:30,359
When I see the scapegoat,
your face comes to my mind.

1388
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,429
My face must have come to your mind
when you see a tiger.

1389
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,070
Why did it happen on seeing a goat?
It shouldn't have happened.

1390
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:37,665
But it did.

1391
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,665
There is a medicine for it.
- I...

1392
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,039
Why are you wiping it?

1393
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:48,248
Don't you like me?
- Did I say that?

1394
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:53,145
Enough.

1395
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:57,350
How can I marry a girl
who doesn't like me?

1396
01:24:57,659 --> 01:24:58,421
No need.

1397
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:01,154
You mean this or our marriage.

1398
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:05,929
No need of anything.

1399
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:09,770
What happened?

1400
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,273
The one who is standing on top.
Is he my uncle?

1401
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,572
Don't turn immediately.

1402
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,188
How did you find that out?

1403
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,460
I'll tell you. - Tell me.

1404
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,827
I'll tell you once we go home.

1405
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:05,885
This is the sickle which
was used to hack you.

1406
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:07,688
It's from this house.

1407
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:09,662
Look at the initials.

1408
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:14,229
Is it Kottasami?

1409
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,804
This is "Koth" not "Kott".

1410
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:19,473
But it is the big bull.

1411
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,173
My uncle.

1412
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,565
Son-in-law... - Go inside.

1413
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,168
Where were you?
I've sent men to search you.

1414
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:52,633
Have you gone mad?

1415
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:55,268
Your initials are imprinted
on that sickle.

1416
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:57,705
It was used to kill me.

1417
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:00,742
Answer me.

1418
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,074
You mean to say that
he tried to kill you.

1419
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:06,085
You keep quiet. Let him talk.

1420
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:08,812
Mind your words or else...

1421
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:10,652
Wait... wait...

1422
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,017
I've understood.

1423
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:15,253
The same sickle.

1424
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,398
Kottasami. - Boss.

1425
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:20,623
Don't you remember this sickle?

1426
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,098
When our vehicle broke down,
we left it in Nallama Naickenur.

1427
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:28,775
We lodged a complaint to the Police
about a weapon stolen from it.

1428
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:32,107
They said that they were not aware of it
and stood like innocent persons.

1429
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:35,879
This sickle was also
in that vehicle.

1430
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:37,715
Look how cheap Nallama Naicker's
character is.

1431
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,211
Look at his treachery.

1432
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:43,856
They are jealous
about our friendship.

1433
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,126
What are you looking at?

1434
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,626
I don't care about anyone.
But I treated you as my brother.

1435
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,463
Are you suspecting me?

1436
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:56,365
My brother is suspecting me.

1437
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,165
I can't bear this disgrace.

1438
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:02,835
Was this the sickle which
was used to kill you?

1439
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:05,672
Boss, no... - Leave me...

1440
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:11,780
Listen to me, boss.

1441
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:14,655
Oh my god!

1442
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:18,417
Leave me.

1443
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:23,157
Leave him...
- Father... no...

1444
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,670
My son!

1445
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,104
Oh god, someone stop them.

1446
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,177
Hey Virumaandi, get up.

1447
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,507
Hey Virumaandi, leave him... get...

1448
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:48,286
Annalakshmi is not to be blamed.

1449
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,081
Anyone will do like that only.

1450
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,154
Though you had suspected me,
I'm not angry with you.

1451
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:55,225
Don't you believe me?

1452
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,759
Let the case come to an end.
You & Virumaandi...

1453
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:03,136
You and Annalakshmi are marrying.
I'm definite about that.

1454
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,828
I'll announce it in the
village council also.

1455
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:06,529
We all are going to council meeting
in Nallama Naickenur.

1456
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:10,074
No one will touch you. Don't be afraid.
We are there with you. - Afraid? Me?

1457
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,370
I smashed a Chinese guy in Singapore.

1458
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,514
Anyone with Chinese eyes
is not a Bruce Lee.

1459
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:15,910
Nallama Naicker has
called for the village council.

1460
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,880
You are talking as if Tirumalai Naicker
has called for it.

1461
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:18,984
I can beat them black & blue
single handedly.

1462
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,155
Do you really have to go to
that village council meet?

1463
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,220
If we don't go, they'll call
us cowards. We must go.

1464
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:30,553
Yes, we must go. Go.
But they'll try to provoke you.

1465
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:31,493
Don't get angry and
answer them properly.

1466
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:34,065
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1467
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:38,771
My goodness! Looks like she will
tie him to her apron strings.

1468
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:40,804
She has already tied him
to her apron strings.

1469
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:43,470
The bull has been tamed.

1470
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,414
<i>When Kondarasu said that</i>
<i>I'm Kothalan's tool used to scratch.</i>

1471
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:48,176
<i>I didn't understand.</i>

1472
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,577
<i>Instead, I got angry</i>
<i>and it ended up in violence.</i>

1473
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:01,058
Whether he insulted me & you,

1474
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,230
We should've hacked him
to death there itself.

1475
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:08,601
Will you please come here?
- Why?

1476
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:12,999
I'm asking you, why?

1477
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:15,140
You are simply walking away.

1478
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:19,036
Look how angry she is...
I'll ask her the reason.

1479
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:27,180
What's it?

1480
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,391
I'm asking you & you're simply...

1481
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:33,619
I can't talk to you.

1482
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:35,390
If you are a human,
I could've talked to you.

1483
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,828
Hey, move...

1484
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:40,223
There is no difference between
you & this bull.

1485
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:42,193
If the door is open.
You'll hit someone.

1486
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:43,469
You are similar to that cow.

1487
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:48,166
So, you mean that one.

1488
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:50,602
I thought you were making fun of me.

1489
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:51,938
No one is making fun of you.

1490
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:53,545
The entire village in
talking bad about you.

1491
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,807
Elders mustn't curse us.
They must only bless us.

1492
01:30:57,084 --> 01:31:00,542
Whom are you referring to?
Is it Nallamma Naicker?

1493
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:02,588
Do you know he hacked me?

1494
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,417
Neither you saw him nor did I.

1495
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:10,456
Did you see him? Leave that.

1496
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:11,962
Why did you beat Kondarasu?

1497
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:14,960
Kothaala stopped me.

1498
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:17,831
He spoke bad about your aunt.
- No...

1499
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,998
No, he spoke the truth about
my uncle. That's all.

1500
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:22,733
To differentiate you from a bull,

1501
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:24,775
You must behave like a human.
If not...

1502
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,344
Hey, what do you think of yourself?

1503
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:29,175
No woman should talk to me like
that other than my grandma.

1504
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:30,680
This woman will talk.

1505
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:32,915
Now, I've the responsibilities
of your grandma too.

1506
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:35,155
I'll not only be your wife...

1507
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:36,546
What do you say?

1508
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,722
What does that mean?

1509
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:41,762
What are you trying to say?

1510
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:45,227
Withdraw the case you filed
against Nallama Naicker.

1511
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:49,763
Looks like you'll ask me to
seek his forgiveness also.

1512
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,405
He who forgives is a human.

1513
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:54,698
He who seeks forgiveness
is a great human.

1514
01:31:57,545 --> 01:31:58,534
What do you want to say?

1515
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:01,711
You mean to say that
I am not a great human.

1516
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:08,253
You mean to say that
I'm not at all a human.

1517
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:10,383
You can't become a
human at my bidding.

1518
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:11,888
You must become a
human by yourself.

1519
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:15,155
What do you want me to do?
Say that and leave.

1520
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,524
Enough of drinking. Go.
Eat & sleep.

1521
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:37,249
Who's that? I say who's that?

1522
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:38,780
I'm Virumaandi.

1523
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,351
Wait Konda...

1524
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,450
I've not come here to fight.

1525
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:44,452
Then Why have you come?

1526
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:48,091
What's in your hand?
- You slippers.

1527
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:52,258
No one is with me.
I've come alone.

1528
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:55,097
That's what I'm asking you
why have you come? Stop...

1529
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:58,270
He is asking you to stop, isn't he?
Stop, go & eat.

1530
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:00,706
Mind your business.

1531
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:07,144
Look, as a human...

1532
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,546
No. She said something else.

1533
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:15,278
Who?

1534
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:19,288
He who can forgive is a human.

1535
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:22,961
He who seeks forgiveness
is a brave man.

1536
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:24,623
Okay.

1537
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:30,795
I'm a brave man.
Are you a human?

1538
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:34,797
Take your slipper.

1539
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:38,543
Will you limp wearing
one slipper?

1540
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:41,971
What's it?

1541
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:46,485
I'm a human. Come.

1542
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:47,779
Where?

1543
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:48,644
To sit.

1544
01:33:54,528 --> 01:33:55,654
Sit, you brave heart!

1545
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:03,736
Go & mind your mind.
Ramarasu, get up.

1546
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:05,004
Sir...

1547
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,938
The coffee shop would be open by now.
Bring 2 cups of coffee.

1548
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:11,670
Don't go to your favourite shop
if it is open.

1549
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:12,675
I'll kill you.

1550
01:34:13,114 --> 01:34:14,012
He's a drunkard.

1551
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:17,783
Look, the baby is crying.

1552
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:19,783
My wife.

1553
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:22,187
He is Virumaandi.

1554
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:24,682
Don't get scared.

1555
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:26,187
He has come seeking forgiveness.

1556
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:28,793
My slippers.

1557
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:35,701
Sir, Kottasami is coming
with men & sickles.

1558
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:40,198
Oh my God! - Oh no! Please come.

1559
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:43,767
You scoundrel! You've shown your
true colour. - Listen to me.

1560
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:47,714
Have you gone mad?

1561
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:52,385
Listen to me.

1562
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:55,555
Oh please, come here.
- I'll kill you.

1563
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:04,896
I will take care of them.
- Traitor.

1564
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:11,404
Son-in-law.

1565
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:20,742
How dare you throw
slippers at me?

1566
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:24,751
Please leave me...

1567
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:37,387
Have you gone mad?

1568
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:39,361
I came here for a compromise.

1569
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:42,533
The dog which threw the slipper is dead.
Forget it.

1570
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:46,499
Don't leave him, I'm coming...
Hack him.

1571
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:49,170
Don't leave any witness behind.

1572
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:50,176
Kill all of them.

1573
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:54,778
It's enough, come.

1574
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:58,379
No one should be left alive.

1575
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:12,191
Come in fast. - Lock the doors...

1576
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:15,865
Where is he?

1577
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:27,044
They are breaking the doors
go & hide elsewhere.

1578
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:40,358
Open the door man.
Ramarasu, open the door.

1579
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:43,223
Oh my God! Save me.

1580
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:49,561
Oh my God! - Go... go.
Don't kill me...

1581
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:00,075
My child... please spare it.

1582
01:37:22,403 --> 01:37:26,863
Have gone mad? He's trying to kill me.
I came to save you.

1583
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:28,875
You murderers.

1584
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:40,546
Don't spare him. He's running away...
Catch him... catch him.

1585
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:47,826
Have you gone mad to
save an eye-witness?

1586
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:51,861
There he is... go & catch him.

1587
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:54,596
He's going... Catch him...

1588
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:57,904
Catch him.

1589
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:07,073
O my child! My child is dead.

1590
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:10,239
Hey, come here. I'll kill you.

1591
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:15,745
Don't shout, don't shout.
- You slapped me, didn't you?

1592
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:18,584
There are 20 men with deadly weapons,
they'll also kill you. Keep quiet.

1593
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:21,418
Ask them to kill me.
My child is also dead.

1594
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:32,170
Son-in-law, where are you?

1595
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:35,269
This was destined by God.

1596
01:38:35,476 --> 01:38:36,272
What had to happen, has happened?

1597
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:37,466
Come, let's take bath & go.

1598
01:38:38,045 --> 01:38:40,707
Before the escapees brings
the police, let's run away.

1599
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:43,975
My hands are full of blood,
let's wash & go.

1600
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:46,445
I say let's go.
- Have you gone...

1601
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:49,020
He is telling you. Go.
I say go.

1602
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:50,783
No use in fighting amongst ourselves!

1603
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:09,108
Ask her to go. They have come.
Hey, go aside.

1604
01:39:11,845 --> 01:39:13,005
Hey go to the side.

1605
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:18,981
Greetings madam. Greetings sir.

1606
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:22,682
Please give some way, madam.

1607
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:28,693
They have killed my husband.

1608
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:31,156
Wait... wait.

1609
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:38,366
Please don't touch anything.
They are evidences.

1610
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:49,875
Oh my child... they left you on the road
like an orphan's corpse.

1611
01:39:51,919 --> 01:39:59,223
Mr. Naicker, return back my child to me.

1612
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:05,388
Oh my Goddess. I asked you save me,
did you only me, bloody?

1613
01:40:05,866 --> 01:40:07,891
Hey give back my child.

1614
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:09,729
Did you see? She's the only witness.

1615
01:40:09,937 --> 01:40:12,963
How can I file the case?
She has gone mad.

1616
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:16,068
...my husband will get up and...

1617
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:22,209
What are you doing here
without your shirt?

1618
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:24,077
It is very sultry, isn't it?
That's why I didn't wear. Go to school.

1619
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:27,412
Give my shirt. - First
I will send children to school.

1620
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:29,418
They haven't been going to school
for some days. - Why?

1621
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:32,687
School is in Nallama Naickenur,
we aren't in good terms with its people.

1622
01:40:32,893 --> 01:40:34,121
What will they do to our children?

1623
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:35,420
Other children are also going.

1624
01:40:36,063 --> 01:40:37,928
No child, will go from
Chinna Kolarpatti.

1625
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,095
Nothing will happen if they
don't study for 3-4 months.

1626
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:41,434
Come.

1627
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:59,518
Did it happen as
I had warned you?

1628
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:02,448
You've inflicted an unhealing wound on
the traditional enemity, haven't you?

1629
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:06,793
Are you happy now after
spoiling my life? Go away.

1630
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:08,962
Run... run for your life.

1631
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:11,454
Wherever you go,
your sin will remain your shadow.

1632
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:14,691
I didn't do anything.
- Yes you didn't.

1633
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:17,368
Someone else resembling you
did it, right? - What happened to you?

1634
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:23,300
I got what you people didn't.
My senses. Forget it.

1635
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:28,207
Nallama Naickenur people will kill
your husband because of him.

1636
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:30,409
Why did you give me hopes?

1637
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,044
You promised me, didn't you?

1638
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:35,215
Bloody rouge, why did you dash my
hopes of marriage before marrying?

1639
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:40,391
I didn't do... I didn't do.

1640
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:42,084
Didn't you come with us?
Now you are trying to escape.

1641
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:43,292
We went in a group.

1642
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:44,828
Whatever it is, we have
to fight together.

1643
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:48,926
No sir, if he blabbers something to
the police... Shouldn't lie.

1644
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:52,336
Virumaandi listen.

1645
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,344
Hey, why are you pushing me?
Hey leave.

1646
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:13,519
What I have been accused of
I am going to do it now, murder.

1647
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:17,989
You and Kothaalan are the killers.
Is it true or not?

1648
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:19,897
True... it's true...

1649
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:24,666
Which is true? - We... I... Kothaalan.

1650
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:29,206
Virumaandi, leave him.
- I have killed all of them.

1651
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:31,539
Hey Virmaa, leave him.
- You didn't do it.

1652
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:38,444
My Virumaa come, listen to me.

1653
01:42:42,022 --> 01:42:45,219
Did you hear what he said? It wasn't me.

1654
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:55,265
Cover with this cloth.
- Okay, go... go...

1655
01:42:57,471 --> 01:43:00,406
Silly, don't make me a widow
discuss about this later.

1656
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:03,739
Virumaan is innocent,
nothing will happen to him.

1657
01:43:04,745 --> 01:43:07,737
I will accept the crime to
prove your innocence, then?

1658
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:10,279
Why do you have to prove it?

1659
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:13,085
I am innocent, that's the truth.
You have killed them that's the truth.

1660
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:17,081
Greetings.

1661
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:23,755
Greetings.

1662
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:27,757
What is the news Kottaisamy? - Nothing sir.

1663
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:30,099
Nothing?

1664
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:40,435
I have brought the witness.

1665
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,473
Shall I enquire here or
at the Police station?

1666
01:43:44,651 --> 01:43:45,777
Better here.

1667
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:47,452
Mr. Lawyer you also go. - Go...

1668
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:48,951
You have to argue, go.

1669
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:51,284
Virumaandi, don't be afraid.

1670
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,957
Eye witness Ramaraj has
come here, trusting us.

1671
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:55,454
We have to take care of him.

1672
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:57,353
You have joined the winning party.

1673
01:43:57,564 --> 01:43:59,191
Nothing will happen to you.
I will take care of the rest.

1674
01:43:59,466 --> 01:44:01,627
Did you have your food? - No sir.
- Pechi, get the food ready.

1675
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:06,796
Peikaman come. Son-in-law, come.

1676
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:11,470
Naicker insulted me in public.

1677
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:12,144
What did he say?

1678
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:16,645
He accused me of taking bribe inspite
knowing the truth from Kothaala.

1679
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:18,813
What did you say?

1680
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:20,653
I said, I swear I didn't take any bribe.

1681
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:21,812
Did you see?

1682
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:23,990
It was good that I had asked you to
take bribe after doing the work.

1683
01:44:24,191 --> 01:44:25,749
Or else it would have been
a false promise.

1684
01:44:26,693 --> 01:44:28,160
Hey I didn't kill.

1685
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:31,129
Decision of the court will be
the same, won't it Peikaman?

1686
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:33,328
No. We have to force it
to give such a decision.

1687
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:34,758
Is it court or joke?

1688
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:37,861
I didn't any crime.
I can tell this to any court.

1689
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:40,733
Okay, if they ask who has done it? - He...

1690
01:44:46,146 --> 01:44:48,410
My husband and children
will get ruined.

1691
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:50,011
Don't identify him.

1692
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:53,345
I am requesting you and
considering you as my brother.

1693
01:45:01,995 --> 01:45:03,360
Please save my husband.

1694
01:45:03,563 --> 01:45:05,030
On the day of that incident,

1695
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:07,166
did you go to Ponnurasu's
fields to see him?

1696
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:09,869
Speak the truth.

1697
01:45:11,238 --> 01:45:14,207
No sir, I was in Kothaala
Thevar's house with him.

1698
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:22,042
Oh God... oh God! - It is a lie... he is lying.

1699
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,309
Order... Order

1700
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:26,818
<i>They have killed people.</i>
<i>I have killed the truth.</i>

1701
01:45:27,187 --> 01:45:29,087
<i>I lied and defeated truth.</i>

1702
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:31,557
<i>I was accounted for other's sins.</i>

1703
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:34,727
It is wrong... You were good when
you were in the well.

1704
01:45:34,961 --> 01:45:37,327
You have started lying after coming out
of it. It was wrong to bring you out.

1705
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,396
As per the complaint filed
by Nallama Naicker.

1706
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:42,065
Under sec.302, following
persons were arrested.

1707
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:46,932
Virumaandi Thevar, KothaalaThevar,
Kottaisamy, Rasukalai,

1708
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:50,641
Chinnakrupu, Kodangi and others.

1709
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:53,903
Since there is not sufficient
evidence to prove their crime,

1710
01:45:54,147 --> 01:45:57,173
this court finds them 'Not guilty'
and releases them.

1711
01:45:57,651 --> 01:46:03,749
I order the police to investigate
further & nab the real culprits.

1712
01:46:36,623 --> 01:46:39,820
Remember one thing.
Don't think falsehood has won.

1713
01:46:40,527 --> 01:46:42,461
Only truth will prevail in the end.

1714
01:46:43,196 --> 01:46:46,290
I can't sleep peacefully
till then, Can you?

1715
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:50,026
Our soul is the real court.
All this is secondary.

1716
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,295
Take the car.

1717
01:46:57,344 --> 01:47:01,474
<i>Burst this crackers let that</i>
<i>village resound with our celebration.</i>

1718
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:57,436
I allowed people to dirty my well.

1719
01:47:59,339 --> 01:48:01,864
I allowed people to dirty
my grand mother's well.

1720
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:07,878
I must get rid of this
burden of my sins.

1721
01:48:09,115 --> 01:48:13,051
Shall I will all my property to
this village as repentance?

1722
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:15,983
Oh no! Don't do like that.
- I have done it.

1723
01:48:16,289 --> 01:48:21,249
Secretly, I have willed my property to
people through Mr. Naicker's lawyer.

1724
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:22,323
What about you?

1725
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:24,721
I have money in the bank.

1726
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:25,955
You will spend it.

1727
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:27,393
Land will have everlasting value.

1728
01:48:28,101 --> 01:48:30,228
How could you will your entire
properties like a fool?

1729
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:34,072
I still have one property
with me? - Which one?

1730
01:48:44,217 --> 01:48:47,414
No... no, you don't have any
relationship with them.

1731
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:49,315
Go somewhere.

1732
01:48:49,856 --> 01:48:51,756
Run away as far as you can... run away.

1733
01:48:52,158 --> 01:48:53,090
Are you asking me to go alone?

1734
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,923
You said that you are
grandma & wife to me.

1735
01:48:59,966 --> 01:49:00,762
Was it a lie?

1736
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:08,767
Take me also with you.

1737
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:14,105
Now you are my wife.

1738
01:49:14,814 --> 01:49:19,979
Within 2-3 days, lets inform Kothaala.
- Oh God... without informing anybody,

1739
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,953
Today, right now.

1740
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:27,958
Now I'm not talking as your wife
but grandma.

1741
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:58,149
Lord Virumaandi & Goddess Pechi,
you must save your children.

1742
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:01,961
They haven't brought any offerings.

1743
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:04,153
Here... tie it... tie it...

1744
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:14,265
God, grant them long happy life
with children.

1745
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:19,002
Virumbu, please turn.
You didn't give me offerings.

1746
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:21,179
I'm going urgently.

1747
01:50:21,414 --> 01:50:22,506
I have deposited some
money in the bank?

1748
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:25,082
You are saying later!
I don't disbelieve you,

1749
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:28,245
but It's traditional to offer money to
the priest on happy occasions.

1750
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:31,353
You can offer whatever
you have with you now.

1751
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:33,518
Not money, but I am offering gold.

1752
01:50:34,227 --> 01:50:35,251
Oh... okay.

1753
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:41,867
Oh Lord Virumaandi.

I thought it was one of your jokes
when you said, "I am coming with my wife".

1780
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:26,317
Okay, she looks good.

1781
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,751
You are lucky to have married him.

It's rare to find such a good man.

01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:35,655
God didn't give me a son like him,
but gave me a rogue son.

What to do?

1785
01:55:38,898 --> 01:55:40,160
You will stay here for
few days, won't you?

We will be here for 2-3 days.

1787
01:55:44,203 --> 01:55:46,501
Why just 2-3 days?
Stay here permanently.

1788
01:55:46,739 --> 01:55:48,502
This is his house. Did he tell you?

1789
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:49,799
Hey, didn't you tell her?

1790
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:51,674
I will tell her. - You will not.

1791
01:55:51,878 --> 01:55:53,072
Give my keys, I will go.

1792
01:55:53,813 --> 01:55:54,905
Give me 2 Beedies and a match box.

1793
01:55:55,315 --> 01:55:56,213
Give 2 Beedies and a match box.

1794
01:55:57,116 --> 01:55:58,174
Hey give money and go.

1795
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:00,018
Go.

1796
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:02,018
Wait, I have to tell you something.

1797
01:56:02,689 --> 01:56:04,850
He took the blame for my son's
crime in Singapore.

1798
01:56:05,058 --> 01:56:06,923
He has come back losing his job.

1799
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,022
Okay leave it. - I have already left him.

1800
01:56:09,495 --> 01:56:11,690
He is enjoying in Singapore
after marrying a Chinese girl.

1801
01:56:11,898 --> 01:56:12,865
He isn't coming here
for any festival.

1802
01:56:13,066 --> 01:56:15,500
No letters also from him.
I don't bother about him anymore.

1803
01:56:15,702 --> 01:56:19,798
After my death, all my properties
will go to him only.

1804
01:56:20,006 --> 01:56:22,031
Then, it'll take 100 years for me to
get your properties. - Come here.

1805
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:26,709
I will go to a movie tonight.
You enjoy tonight.

1806
01:56:28,748 --> 01:56:29,373
Come brother.

1807
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:30,883
When have you come?

1808
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:33,878
Look, he has come here
after getting married.

1809
01:56:34,087 --> 01:56:36,282
Is it? - Yes, they are going to
enjoy here.

1810
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:37,547
They are on their honeymoon here.

1811
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:39,884
I am also going for the
night show of a movie.

1812
01:56:52,805 --> 01:56:54,204
What do you look so downcast?

1813
01:56:55,641 --> 01:56:57,131
How come you married a fool like me?

1814
01:56:57,643 --> 01:56:59,804
There is nothing lacking in my husband.
Why should I worry?

1815
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,576
I have came to a decision.

1816
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:06,918
What?

1817
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:15,254
No more Tendulkar. We will name
your father's name to our child.

1818
01:57:21,467 --> 01:57:22,092
Leave me.

1819
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:23,600
Don't... please listen...

1820
01:57:24,737 --> 01:57:26,261
What is this... like a beast?

1821
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:38,946
What is this, you obstinate man?
Did some one stab you?

1822
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:45,014
While taming the bull,
it's horns hurt me. - Oh god!

1823
01:57:46,759 --> 01:57:48,693
It's all part of the game.

1824
01:57:49,328 --> 01:57:49,794
How?

1825
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:51,453
Shall I tell you?

1826
01:57:52,932 --> 01:57:58,029
While grappling the bull, like this.

1827
01:57:59,505 --> 01:58:00,472
You will get hurt won't you?

1828
01:58:06,012 --> 01:58:06,478
What?

01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:10,307
I have a mark of hurt every time
I tamed a bull.

1830
01:58:11,651 --> 01:58:14,984
How's it, I didn't get hurt
taming an untamed bull?

1831
01:58:17,156 --> 01:58:17,713
Show me your hand.

1832
01:58:30,369 --> 01:58:32,303
Oh! What are you doing?

1833
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:35,063
Mark...

1834
01:58:37,243 --> 01:58:38,335
My life time...

1835
01:58:39,912 --> 01:58:43,507
I will get the medicine.
Don't you want me to apply medicine?

1836
01:58:45,885 --> 01:58:46,749
Shall I apply sacred ash?

1837
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:50,516
Only if you leave me.

1838
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:54,088
Please leave me.

1839
01:58:57,163 --> 01:58:58,357
I say leave me.

You have opened your shop
early in the morning?

1860
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:36,855
Why did you come here?

1861
02:01:37,523 --> 02:01:39,855
I thought you were sleeping.
So I came here to have coffee.

1862
02:01:40,092 --> 02:01:41,525
Brother, do you want Jaggery
coffee or black coffee?

1863
02:01:42,161 --> 02:01:43,492
Black coffee. - Okay brother.

1864
02:01:43,863 --> 02:01:45,353
Thinking that you both,
would be sleeping.

1865
02:01:45,564 --> 02:01:46,588
I came and opened the shop.

Kottaisamy & Rasukalai came
in search of you from the bank.

They asked for you.

1868
02:01:51,404 --> 02:01:52,428
I told them that you were sleeping.

1869
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:53,764
Did they meet you?

02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:56,207
Son Virumaandi, where are you going?

1871
02:02:15,928 --> 02:02:16,724
Come in.

1872
02:02:17,596 --> 02:02:20,064
Madam, finish your interview quickly
& leave the place. - Why?

1873
02:02:20,366 --> 02:02:21,890
We are expecting trouble in the jail.

1874
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:24,729
Pack up all these things.
Move.

1875
02:02:24,937 --> 02:02:27,064
Take him to main gate office and
handcuff him. Handcuffs them.

1876
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:28,240
Okay? - Okay sir.

1877
02:02:28,441 --> 02:02:29,237
Come in Arumugan.

1878
02:02:29,608 --> 02:02:32,406
I will bring the visitors
through main gate.

1879
02:02:32,945 --> 02:02:34,412
As soon as I cross
you lock the doors.

1880
02:02:35,114 --> 02:02:36,081
Move... move... quick.

1881
02:02:39,785 --> 02:02:40,410
Come.

1882
02:02:46,292 --> 02:02:48,419
You raided without
giving any intimation.

1883
02:02:48,627 --> 02:02:50,754
Don't think of enjoying alone by
spoiling our livelihood?

1884
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:52,260
This will not happen.
- What is it man?

1885
02:02:52,965 --> 02:02:54,762
Madam, you get going.
Hey take her.

1886
02:02:54,967 --> 02:02:55,592
Come madam, .

1887
02:02:56,469 --> 02:02:57,663
Why are you screaming
infront of outsiders.

1888
02:02:58,304 --> 02:02:59,236
Don't blabber without understanding
the facts.

1889
02:03:00,005 --> 02:03:02,530
This jailer will not enjoy
and will not allow others to enjoy.

1890
02:03:02,975 --> 02:03:04,101
He has conducted this raid.

1891
02:03:04,377 --> 02:03:05,776
I am not involved in this.

1892
02:03:05,978 --> 02:03:08,378
If he gets hold of the packets,
we'll lose Rs.30 lakhs.

1893
02:03:08,914 --> 02:03:10,108
Who will answer the persons
who provide it.

1894
02:03:10,516 --> 02:03:11,574
My family is outside.

1895
02:03:11,784 --> 02:03:12,944
Raid is going on in the kitchen.

1896
02:03:13,152 --> 02:03:15,347
If anybody blows the whistle fearing
beatings, we'll be in a fix.

1897
02:03:15,721 --> 02:03:19,179
I have 2 more years.
If anything happens... - Hey, go away...

1898
02:03:19,492 --> 02:03:20,356
Don't shout unnecessarily.

1899
02:03:20,826 --> 02:03:22,453
Ups and downs are
natural in business.

1900
02:03:22,962 --> 02:03:24,122
Think that our time
isn't good today.

1901
02:03:24,330 --> 02:03:25,228
Your time isn't good.

1902
02:03:25,598 --> 02:03:27,828
You took away 50o/o profit
without doing anything!

1903
02:03:28,033 --> 02:03:29,125
Hey... wait... wait...

1904
02:03:29,335 --> 02:03:31,963
Drugs are worth Rs.30 lakhs.

1905
02:03:32,171 --> 02:03:33,638
If anything happens to the lot,

1906
02:03:33,839 --> 02:03:35,466
Gone. - Gone, we will
create a riot in the jail.

1907
02:03:36,008 --> 02:03:40,240
Go and create a riot. I mean it.

1908
02:03:41,147 --> 02:03:43,411
There will be an inquiry only if Jailer
comes out & writes the report.

1909
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:46,648
If you allow the police men
to file the FIR, then we had it.

1910
02:03:47,953 --> 02:03:49,614
Did he commit 24 murders!?

1911
02:03:50,556 --> 02:03:51,989
Didn't I get him death sentence
by filing the FIR?

1912
02:03:53,058 --> 02:03:55,049
You will also face the same
fate if Jailer comes out.

1913
02:03:55,961 --> 02:03:56,985
Don't let him out.

1914
02:03:58,063 --> 02:04:00,861
Make sure Jailer gets
killed in the jail riot.

1915
02:04:01,801 --> 02:04:03,666
Reddy, go and start the riot.

1916
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:07,168
Hey call them.
Where are you going? - Come here

1917
02:04:08,073 --> 02:04:09,335
Do you have a cell phone? - No.

1918
02:04:09,775 --> 02:04:13,336
I will send it. - Go.

1919
02:04:13,546 --> 02:04:15,343
It will be authentic only when there are
loss of lives on both sides.

1920
02:04:15,548 --> 02:04:16,014
Got it?

1921
02:04:18,851 --> 02:04:20,842
Hey switch off the camera.
Switch it off man.

1922
02:04:21,053 --> 02:04:23,021
What are you watching man?
Go and snatch it.

1923
02:04:26,058 --> 02:04:30,654
Arumugan come in...
close the door.

1924
02:04:34,567 --> 02:04:35,363
Madam.

1925
02:04:37,636 --> 02:04:44,200
Sir, that lady and the cameraman are
running towards C-Block on the left.

1926
02:04:45,411 --> 02:04:47,538
Handcuff them.
- Hey close the gate & catch them.

1927
02:04:49,215 --> 02:04:50,580
Okay, over sir.

1928
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:51,544
What is happening there man?

1929
02:04:52,084 --> 02:04:53,711
Who is at the gate?

1930
02:05:05,431 --> 02:05:05,897
No.

1931
02:05:10,269 --> 02:05:11,793
Don't... I am warning you.

1932
02:05:57,449 --> 02:05:59,007
Sir, I am Peikaman speaking.

1933
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:01,185
Mr. Jailer is lying wounded
in the kitchen.

1934
02:06:02,154 --> 02:06:03,382
Large scale violence has broken out.

1935
02:06:04,423 --> 02:06:06,948
Hey if anything happens
to jailer, that's all.

1936
02:06:07,326 --> 02:06:09,055
Okay, is jailer near you?

1937
02:06:09,662 --> 02:06:14,463
Yes but he can't talk. He has been
stabbed. There is a huge loss of blood.

1938
02:06:14,667 --> 02:06:15,793
I don't think he will survive.

1939
02:06:16,101 --> 02:06:17,625
Hey, you don't touch anything.

1940
02:06:17,836 --> 02:06:20,202
You come to C'block immediately.
There is an important task for you there.

1941
02:06:20,506 --> 02:06:22,633
Throw away the walkie-talkie,
it'll have your finger prints.

1942
02:06:25,844 --> 02:06:28,278
Hey, Gopal. Hey come here.

1943
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:33,374
Sir, they have started writing.

1944
02:06:33,719 --> 02:06:34,481
Catch them and come.

1945
02:06:34,687 --> 02:06:37,247
Sir, is it easy to go in?
I can't go.

1946
02:06:38,991 --> 02:06:41,482
Sir, I have a family to support.

1947
02:07:03,549 --> 02:07:06,347
Hey, its here and you are shouting.

1948
02:07:07,219 --> 02:07:08,709
Throw this over the compound wall.

1949
02:07:09,488 --> 02:07:11,752
Ask our leader to collect it
from the jail compound. Go.

1950
02:07:12,157 --> 02:07:15,854
Hey, if you reveal this to anybody.
I will kill all of you.

1951
02:07:16,962 --> 02:07:20,261
Okay, you all have a job to do.
That Jailor's body...

1952
02:07:22,001 --> 02:07:22,695
Hey move.

1953
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:34,545
Hey what is this?

1954
02:07:34,747 --> 02:07:36,374
Why are you asking 'what'?
He is having a pistol.

1955
02:07:36,582 --> 02:07:37,549
Ask our people to come out.

1956
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:38,876
Let all the items which are kept inside,
go out. Take it.

1957
02:07:39,084 --> 02:07:41,052
Lets lock him inside and go out. Go.

1958
02:07:41,587 --> 02:07:45,045
Hey go. Hey lift it up.

1959
02:07:45,591 --> 02:07:49,220
If you catch them.
- What will you give me?

1960
02:07:51,096 --> 02:07:51,892
What do you want?

1961
02:07:53,265 --> 02:07:54,061
Annalakshmi.

1962
02:08:11,617 --> 02:08:13,744
I and Virumaandi got married.

1963
02:08:13,952 --> 02:08:18,582
Now, I don't belong to this house.

1964
02:08:19,458 --> 02:08:21,756
I don't want any properties.

1965
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:24,588
Hereafter, I will not come this side.

1966
02:08:26,965 --> 02:08:29,593
He has tied auspicious thread.
Leave me.

1967
02:08:29,802 --> 02:08:30,598
If I leave you,

1968
02:08:30,969 --> 02:08:32,596
then you will file a case
claiming your rights.

1969
02:08:32,805 --> 02:08:38,107
No... I swear on my auspicious thread.
I will not do such things.

1970
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:40,778
Leave me... I will go with him

1971
02:08:41,313 --> 02:08:43,941
If he comes to know about this,
then you are dead.

1972
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:44,615
Hey sit.

1973
02:08:46,485 --> 02:08:47,952
Are you threatening us by
showing the auspicious thread?

1974
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:49,617
I'll snatch it off and tie it again.

1975
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:50,947
Hold her hands.
. - Oh no, I will not...

1976
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:55,119
Tie it... - Oh no I'll not.

1977
02:08:55,994 --> 02:08:58,292
You tie it to her.

1978
02:09:05,671 --> 02:09:06,296
Tie.

1979
02:09:35,868 --> 02:09:37,495
No sir. She may die.

1980
02:09:38,036 --> 02:09:39,833
Kothaalan, what is it?

1981
02:09:43,876 --> 02:09:45,343
If she dies bury her.

1982
02:09:48,547 --> 02:09:49,844
Kothaalan, open the door.

1983
02:09:51,383 --> 02:09:52,680
If she is alive,
let her life as your wife.

1984
02:09:57,055 --> 02:09:57,521
Okay come.

1985
02:10:04,062 --> 02:10:05,859
Oh God! What did you do to her?

1986
02:10:06,231 --> 02:10:06,856
Why are you coming out?

1987
02:10:08,066 --> 02:10:10,364
You go inside, you are the groom.

1988
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:14,368
Hey go away.

1989
02:10:21,747 --> 02:10:23,044
Hey, take that bottle.

1990
02:10:42,267 --> 02:10:44,394
What happened?
- She is crying a lot.

1991
02:10:44,603 --> 02:10:45,729
She is very angry.

1992
02:10:45,938 --> 02:10:47,735
She is a poor girl.
Please leave her.

1993
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:50,909
Hey shit. I will slipper you. Go away.
- You keep quiet.

1994
02:10:51,109 --> 02:10:53,737
Hey go man. Go and have
your nuptials with her.

1995
02:10:56,782 --> 02:10:58,909
Sir, it's day time.
- Hey, go man.

1996
02:11:00,285 --> 02:11:01,912
Night Watchman's don't have
nuptials in the night,

1997
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:03,587
They will have it only
in the day time. Go...

1998
02:11:14,132 --> 02:11:16,930
Sir... - Hey, what happened?

1999
02:11:17,302 --> 02:11:18,269
What happened?

2000
02:11:19,805 --> 02:11:21,602
Annalakshmi, went inside
the kitchen & locked it.

2001
02:11:21,807 --> 02:11:28,610
Annalakshmi, hey Annalakshmi.

2002
02:11:29,314 --> 02:11:31,111
Hey, open the door.
- Break the door.

2003
02:11:33,485 --> 02:11:34,611
Muthu, break the door.

2004
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:42,956
Hey Annam... don't want,
listen to me. Hey.

2005
02:11:48,667 --> 02:11:50,294
Hey go man.

2006
02:11:54,673 --> 02:12:02,637
Hey Annam. - Oh God, Annalakshmi.

2007
02:12:03,849 --> 02:12:08,149
Oh god, Annalakshmi,
they have killed her.

2008
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:19,827
Ask what is possible. Money?

2009
02:12:20,198 --> 02:12:22,166
Can you commute my death sentence?

2010
02:12:30,042 --> 02:12:31,339
Oh, don't harm me.

2011
02:12:31,543 --> 02:12:32,840
I refused to tie
the auspicious thread.

2012
02:12:33,045 --> 02:12:34,842
All of them forced me.

2013
02:12:35,547 --> 02:12:38,675
Murder case will be filed against you
...go away... - Let's go.

2014
02:12:39,217 --> 02:12:40,013
Don't harm me.

2015
02:12:54,733 --> 02:12:56,701
Viruppa, I am not the one.

2016
02:12:57,235 --> 02:12:59,533
Kottaisamy, had tied
the auspicious thread?

2017
02:13:02,741 --> 02:13:04,538
Where is Kothaalan?
- He is in the house.

2018
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:08,038
Really? - I swear. - Show me.

2019
02:13:16,088 --> 02:13:17,555
Hey open the door.

2020
02:13:17,756 --> 02:13:19,724
Who is it? - Kodangi.

2021
02:13:20,258 --> 02:13:21,384
Are you not feeling well?

2022
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:23,387
Hey, open the door.

2023
02:13:29,434 --> 02:13:31,402
Brother, go away Virumaandi has come.

2024
02:13:35,607 --> 02:13:37,404
Brother, Virumaandi has come.

2025
02:13:53,125 --> 02:13:55,423
Who is it? What is the noise there?

2026
02:13:58,964 --> 02:14:04,766
Oh God! Oh God! He is killing him.

2027
02:14:08,807 --> 02:14:10,604
Oh, please leave them.

2028
02:14:10,976 --> 02:14:12,944
Oh God!

2029
02:14:18,650 --> 02:14:25,453
Sir please leave him.
Don't...

2030
02:14:25,657 --> 02:14:26,624
Brother, please leave my husband.

2031
02:14:27,659 --> 02:14:28,785
If you take another step,
I will throw him down.

2032
02:14:28,994 --> 02:14:29,790
Then, he will die.

2033
02:14:30,162 --> 02:14:36,465
Oh please save me.
Oh God, please save me.

2034
02:14:36,668 --> 02:14:38,966
Oh god, don't leave him.

2035
02:14:40,005 --> 02:14:41,802
Don't leave my child.

2036
02:14:42,174 --> 02:14:43,801
Virumaandi, save him.

2037
02:14:45,343 --> 02:14:47,971
Virumaandi, don't go.

2038
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:50,148
Virumaandi, kill my father.

2039
02:14:50,515 --> 02:14:52,983
Don't leave him kill him.

2040
02:15:20,378 --> 02:15:23,176
Hey Virumaandi, don't run... stop.

2041
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:27,351
Constables, catch him from that side.

2042
02:15:27,552 --> 02:15:28,348
Hey, start the vehicle.

2043
02:15:33,892 --> 02:15:35,826
Oh God. - What happend?

2044
02:15:37,229 --> 02:15:39,197
What happened? Where is he?

2045
02:15:39,364 --> 02:15:40,228
Virumaandi stabbed him
and went away.

2046
02:15:40,398 --> 02:15:41,194
Is he alive?

2047
02:15:42,067 --> 02:15:42,863
Hey, break the doors.

2048
02:15:43,235 --> 02:15:44,361
First admit him in hospital.

2049
02:15:44,569 --> 02:15:46,196
Sir, it's locked. - Hey move.

2050
02:15:46,571 --> 02:15:48,198
Go away. Go.

2051
02:15:48,406 --> 02:15:50,374
Hey Virumaandi, I know
that you are inside.

2052
02:15:50,575 --> 02:15:51,542
Come out.

2053
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:54,875
Come out man.

2054
02:16:04,589 --> 02:16:05,214
Hey, catch the bull.

2055
02:16:17,769 --> 02:16:18,394
Hey he is running away.

2056
02:16:19,104 --> 02:16:22,403
Catch him. - Sir, he is gone.

2057
02:16:22,607 --> 02:16:23,733
Sir, there is a power failure.

2058
02:16:30,782 --> 02:16:31,578
Hey, catch the bull.

2059
02:16:48,633 --> 02:16:49,258
Listen to me.

2060
02:16:49,634 --> 02:16:50,931
You can't escape by running
inside the forest.

2061
02:16:52,470 --> 02:16:53,437
Hey, switch off the light.

2062
02:16:59,978 --> 02:17:00,603
Look there.

2063
02:17:01,146 --> 02:17:03,114
Along with the police,
the entire village is coming.

2064
02:17:04,983 --> 02:17:06,109
Come, get into the vehicle.

2065
02:17:07,819 --> 02:17:08,285
Why?

2066
02:17:10,822 --> 02:17:12,289
Enemy's... enemy is a friend.

2067
02:17:12,657 --> 02:17:13,783
There is no time to talk further.

2068
02:17:18,663 --> 02:17:19,630
Come on...

2069
02:17:36,514 --> 02:17:37,981
Hey, go.

2070
02:17:47,525 --> 02:17:50,153
Greetings. You carry on.

2071
02:18:01,873 --> 02:18:03,500
You eat well and leave this place.

2072
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:04,834
Keep this cell phone.

2073
02:18:05,377 --> 02:18:06,674
First eat. Then I will give you.

2074
02:18:07,212 --> 02:18:08,338
Don't stay in one place.

2075
02:18:08,546 --> 02:18:10,343
You sleep in the running
bus during night time.

2076
02:18:10,548 --> 02:18:12,846
In the day time, don't
come out & stay in some place.

2077
02:18:13,218 --> 02:18:15,686
I will consult Vaidiyanadhan
& tell you about your surrender.

2078
02:18:15,887 --> 02:18:18,515
Serve him some more. - Okay.

2079
02:18:20,392 --> 02:18:22,690
Police has come. Inspector has come.

2080
02:18:23,228 --> 02:18:24,024
Has he also come here?

2081
02:18:24,229 --> 02:18:25,696
Who is it? Who is it?

2082
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:27,695
No one... you carry on.

2083
02:18:29,734 --> 02:18:30,860
Sir, you eat.

2084
02:18:31,069 --> 02:18:33,196
You carry on.
Goddess will protect you.

2085
02:18:33,405 --> 02:18:35,873
Good people will not face sorrow.
You eat.

2086
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:41,208
Virumaandi get up...
- Oh, let him eat.

2087
02:18:41,413 --> 02:18:43,210
There is no time for that.
Police has come.

2088
02:18:43,415 --> 02:18:45,212
You should send Virumaandi
out immediately.

2089
02:18:47,085 --> 02:18:48,052
Hey, get inside.

2090
02:18:48,253 --> 02:18:52,212
Sir, it seems Inspector wants
to search the house.

2091
02:18:52,424 --> 02:18:54,392
When I asked him for the search warrant,
he said that he doesn't have it.

2092
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:56,890
Naicker sir, I said it isn't
necessary if it's an emergency.

2093
02:18:57,095 --> 02:19:00,064
He is a murderer.
6 people have died.

2094
02:19:00,265 --> 02:19:01,562
It is a crime to help him.

2095
02:19:01,766 --> 02:19:02,733
I believe that you will not do it.

2096
02:19:02,934 --> 02:19:03,901
You believe me, don't you?

2097
02:19:04,102 --> 02:19:05,228
Then, why are you searching here?

2098
02:19:06,604 --> 02:19:09,072
Why are you unnecessarily standing here,
when we are wearing our saris?

2099
02:19:09,274 --> 02:19:10,901
Forgive me. - What is this sir?

2100
02:19:11,109 --> 02:19:12,736
Like a dog entering the house!

2101
02:19:12,944 --> 02:19:14,571
I will go out. - First you go man.

2102
02:19:15,113 --> 02:19:17,240
Mother, I will go and come.

2103
02:19:21,953 --> 02:19:23,079
Long live.

2104
02:19:26,791 --> 02:19:27,758
Oh goddess.

2105
02:19:36,634 --> 02:19:38,932
Sorry sir, I am doing my duty.

2106
02:19:39,137 --> 02:19:41,105
No problem, I'm not faulting you.
You can go.

2107
02:19:41,973 --> 02:19:43,270
Hey, stop that van.

2108
02:19:44,142 --> 02:19:47,270
What is that van? Hey stop
...stop the van.

2109
02:19:53,318 --> 02:19:55,286
Hey move away. Hey move.

2110
02:19:58,156 --> 02:20:00,954
Hey move. What are you looking at?

2111
02:20:10,168 --> 02:20:11,465
Why have you stopped?
Beat the drums.

2112
02:20:14,005 --> 02:20:15,472
Where is Virumaandi?
- He is under the van.

2113
02:20:27,852 --> 02:20:28,819
Move the van.

2114
02:20:31,689 --> 02:20:32,485
Hey move it.

2115
02:20:36,694 --> 02:20:37,991
Go without disturbing us.

2116
02:20:52,877 --> 02:20:53,673
See you, Naicker sir.

2117
02:21:31,249 --> 02:21:33,217
Is it Virumaandi? How are you?

2118
02:21:33,418 --> 02:21:36,387
I am okay. I don't know
whom to believe.

2119
02:21:36,588 --> 02:21:38,215
Don't worry, I will explain
everything to him.

2120
02:21:38,423 --> 02:21:39,720
Yes, I meant the lawyer.

2121
02:21:40,258 --> 02:21:41,725
You go to Madurai,
after I tell you.

2122
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:42,885
Till then.

2123
02:21:59,110 --> 02:22:02,409
We'll settle our enemity later.
I want Virumaandi.

2124
02:22:03,114 --> 02:22:04,240
Orelse I'll kill all of you.

2125
02:22:04,449 --> 02:22:05,575
Even your age will not be
a deterrent to me.

2126
02:22:06,117 --> 02:22:06,913
What do you say?

2127
02:22:08,953 --> 02:22:11,080
Aarthi. What should I say?

2128
02:22:11,623 --> 02:22:12,590
I am coming out of fear.

2129
02:22:25,136 --> 02:22:25,761
This side...

2130
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:38,949
Sir, Virumaandi speaking.
- Yes Virumaandi.

2131
02:22:39,484 --> 02:22:41,611
Yes, it got disconnected.

2132
02:22:44,489 --> 02:22:45,456
I am coming to see you only.

2133
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:48,458
Sir, I am in Chennai.

2134
02:22:49,327 --> 02:22:50,123
I am Chennai.

2135
02:22:50,328 --> 02:22:51,124
You stay there

2136
02:22:51,996 --> 02:22:53,122
I have come near you.

2137
02:23:50,054 --> 02:23:51,681
Hey, take that cell. - Sir.

2138
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:53,686
Take it man.

2139
02:23:56,894 --> 02:23:57,690
Move man.

2140
02:24:03,067 --> 02:24:05,365
No one has touched
anything, isn't it? Go.

2141
02:24:07,405 --> 02:24:11,205
Go man... go... Take it. Go...

2142
02:24:14,078 --> 02:24:15,204
Go.

2143
02:24:20,752 --> 02:24:22,879
Hello, yes, it is me only.

2144
02:24:23,421 --> 02:24:24,217
Hey shit.

2145
02:24:25,923 --> 02:24:27,720
Oh god, when?

2146
02:24:28,926 --> 02:24:29,551
Shall I come?

2147
02:24:30,428 --> 02:24:32,055
Okay you come here
I will be here only.

2148
02:24:32,263 --> 02:24:33,389
Yes, I will be here.

2149
02:24:38,603 --> 02:24:39,900
They have seen the body just now.

2150
02:24:40,772 --> 02:24:43,741
Hey shit, why are you shouting
like a wounded pig?

2151
02:24:44,108 --> 02:24:45,234
Take him to the hospital?

2152
02:24:46,444 --> 02:24:48,742
Say that his hand got caught
in the pump set.

2153
02:24:48,946 --> 02:24:51,244
Don't blabber gun... etc
You scoundrel, go.

2154
02:24:52,784 --> 02:24:54,411
You surrender in the Madurai court.

2155
02:24:55,119 --> 02:24:55,744
What?

2156
02:24:56,621 --> 02:24:58,589
It is prudent, that we shouldn't
believe police men.

2157
02:24:58,956 --> 02:25:00,253
You have been paid to protect us,

2158
02:25:00,458 --> 02:25:01,254
yet you are asking me to surrender?

2159
02:25:01,793 --> 02:25:02,418
Don't insinuate without knowing the law.

2160
02:25:02,627 --> 02:25:04,254
I am telling you to surrender
to save your life.

2161
02:25:04,462 --> 02:25:06,089
Before Virumaandi gives his statement...

2162
02:25:06,464 --> 02:25:07,761
Mr. Lawyer... explain to him.

2163
02:25:08,633 --> 02:25:11,431
After you give your statement,

2164
02:25:11,636 --> 02:25:13,433
it will be called
First Information Report.

2165
02:25:13,971 --> 02:25:14,938
Then, it will become second.

2166
02:25:15,139 --> 02:25:17,107
Sir, Naicker's people are
coming here.

2167
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:21,278
Hey move away. Hey go man.
Hey move man.

2168
02:25:26,984 --> 02:25:28,281
Don't simply watch, go that side.

2169
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:30,117
This is Naicker's cell phone.

2170
02:25:30,488 --> 02:25:31,785
Virumaandi number is stored in it.

2171
02:25:31,989 --> 02:25:33,786
It is very easy to find his place.

2172
02:25:33,991 --> 02:25:35,788
Before you surrender,
I will find him.

2173
02:25:35,993 --> 02:25:36,960
I know man.

2174
02:25:37,662 --> 02:25:39,789
Don't behead him foolishly and throw
his head in the river.

2175
02:25:40,331 --> 02:25:41,628
I am telling this for your own good.

2176
02:25:42,166 --> 02:25:44,964
Dig deeply... put more salt.

2177
02:25:45,336 --> 02:25:47,463
Police dog is very
dangerous. - I know man.

2178
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:49,807
My dear son.

2179
02:25:50,842 --> 02:25:55,973
My son who killed you?

2180
02:26:00,351 --> 02:26:02,649
Oh my dear son.

2181
02:26:07,859 --> 02:26:12,660
Son, who will look after me now?

2182
02:26:18,703 --> 02:26:21,171
He had tried to phone
someone before he died.

2183
02:26:24,375 --> 02:26:25,171
He would have tried you.

2184
02:26:26,711 --> 02:26:29,509
But he has a cell phone, didn't he?

2185
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:37,187
Definitely, it will be Virumaandi.

2186
02:26:37,722 --> 02:26:40,350
That's why, they say don't
feed milk to the snake.

2187
02:26:40,892 --> 02:26:43,190
You are also suspecting
Virumaandi, are you?

2188
02:26:43,561 --> 02:26:44,687
I should file an FIR.

2189
02:26:46,063 --> 02:26:48,691
Yes. We must find the
person who killed your father.

2190
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:51,198
You also know where
Virumaandi stays, don't you?

2191
02:26:52,069 --> 02:26:55,038
Mr. Palpandi, I may not be a
great lawyer like you,

2192
02:26:55,406 --> 02:26:57,704
but still I am a lawyer like you,
an honest lawyer.

2193
02:26:58,409 --> 02:27:00,206
My father had commanded
me to be one.

2194
02:27:01,245 --> 02:27:02,212
So if you don't mind.

2195
02:27:03,247 --> 02:27:04,214
Okay, you carry on.

2196
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:08,548
I know who has killed
my father? - Who?

2197
02:27:09,587 --> 02:27:10,383
You also know that.

2198
02:27:11,589 --> 02:27:13,716
My father had told me
that 'truth never hides its face'.

2199
02:27:13,925 --> 02:27:15,893
I am following that till now.

2200
02:27:16,427 --> 02:27:19,885
Not a single child will talk
against Virumaandi in this town.

2201
02:27:20,932 --> 02:27:22,900
They will know
what we are talking about.

2202
02:27:23,267 --> 02:27:25,895
I am telling you all this personally
because I respect you.

2203
02:27:26,604 --> 02:27:28,572
For beating the policemen
black and blue.

2204
02:27:28,773 --> 02:27:29,740
And for burning the police station,

2205
02:27:29,941 --> 02:27:31,568
we are all ready to surrender.

2206
02:27:32,944 --> 02:27:36,402
Since my father's procession
should proceed without any disturbance,

2207
02:27:36,614 --> 02:27:37,239
we aren't creating any problem.

2208
02:27:37,949 --> 02:27:38,574
Mind it.

2209
02:27:40,952 --> 02:27:41,577
I have told them.

2210
02:27:51,629 --> 02:27:56,430
D2 & D1 accused have come.
Will reach there in a short while.

2211
02:27:57,635 --> 02:28:01,093
Hey go that side.

2212
02:28:06,644 --> 02:28:08,612
Mr. Lawyer, no problem should crop up.

2213
02:28:09,313 --> 02:28:10,940
Otherwise there will be
law & order problem!

2214
02:28:11,315 --> 02:28:12,304
Did you hear?

2215
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:15,618
Hey, has 'PP' come?

2216
02:28:22,159 --> 02:28:22,625
Hey go that side.

2217
02:28:24,128 --> 02:28:25,095
Go... catch her.

2218
02:28:33,504 --> 02:28:34,630
Don't look at them. Go...

2219
02:28:42,513 --> 02:28:44,481
Vaidiyanadhan's car is coming.

2220
02:28:50,688 --> 02:28:52,155
You rascal, why are you stopping the car?

2221
02:28:53,024 --> 02:28:54,321
Greetings. - Greetings.

2222
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:56,826
You shouldn't support him sir.

2223
02:28:57,695 --> 02:28:59,663
Sir, I didn't come to work.

2224
02:28:59,864 --> 02:29:00,831
Did you see my face?

2225
02:29:01,198 --> 02:29:02,324
It has been 4 days
since I have shaved.

2226
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:03,997
Have you ever see me in the
court with an unshaved face?

2227
02:29:04,702 --> 02:29:05,498
Greetings madam. Greetings sir.

2228
02:29:05,703 --> 02:29:06,829
I am that old Govindarajan.

2229
02:29:07,038 --> 02:29:08,335
He is Govindarajan my old client.

2230
02:29:08,539 --> 02:29:10,336
He has murdered 2 people
by your grace.

2231
02:29:10,541 --> 02:29:12,338
Is it necessary for you?

2232
02:29:12,543 --> 02:29:14,670
I want to meet the
magistrate personally.

2233
02:29:14,879 --> 02:29:15,675
Shall I take leave?

2234
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:17,006
Why do you seek our permission?

2235
02:29:17,214 --> 02:29:19,011
Hey remove your hand.

2236
02:29:19,216 --> 02:29:19,841
But one thing.

2237
02:29:20,051 --> 02:29:22,349
That man won't come to
the court alive. That is for certain.

2238
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:24,347
I will most certainly pour
yellow water on him.

2239
02:29:24,889 --> 02:29:26,686
Why do you talk like this
in the court?

2240
02:29:26,891 --> 02:29:29,519
Go quickly. Why wriggling like a snail?

2241
02:29:31,228 --> 02:29:33,696
Didn't I ask you to prepare
a tea? Did you?

2242
02:29:44,075 --> 02:29:44,871
Quick.

2243
02:29:46,744 --> 02:29:47,711
Come on.

2244
02:29:50,748 --> 02:29:51,874
Get inside quickly.

2245
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:54,877
Madam, I don't know how to thank you.

2246
02:29:55,086 --> 02:29:55,882
Go man.

2247
02:30:00,424 --> 02:30:06,556
Hey, catch him... catch him...
Don't leave him.

2248
02:30:07,765 --> 02:30:09,392
Virumaandi is running. Catch him.

2249
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:10,567
In the case of Nallama Naicker,

2250
02:30:10,768 --> 02:30:12,736
no body has given
statement against Virumaandi.

2251
02:30:13,104 --> 02:30:14,731
Your honour, I don't care about it.

2252
02:30:19,443 --> 02:30:21,741
After investigating the
murder of Annalakshmi,

2253
02:30:21,946 --> 02:30:23,413
and murders committed earlier,

2254
02:30:23,614 --> 02:30:27,243
I can prove that Virumaandi is
linked with all those murders.

2255
02:30:31,288 --> 02:30:32,585
Repeat what I say. - Yes sir.

2256
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:35,258
I swear... - I swear.

2257
02:30:35,459 --> 02:30:36,926
Say loudly. - I swear.

2258
02:30:37,128 --> 02:30:38,925
I will speak the truth, .
- I will speak the truth,

2259
02:30:39,130 --> 02:30:41,428
nothing else but the truth.
- Nothing else but the truth.

2260
02:30:43,467 --> 02:30:45,765
Friend. - Shut up & keep quiet.

2261
02:30:47,138 --> 02:30:47,934
Oh lord!

2262
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:56,109
Was Annalakshmi alive, when you
saw her the last time.

2263
02:31:00,317 --> 02:31:01,113
Yes sir.

2264
02:31:01,819 --> 02:31:03,116
Is there any witness for that?

2265
02:31:03,487 --> 02:31:05,955
Greetings sir. He will not
commit any crime.

2266
02:31:06,323 --> 02:31:08,450
These 4 guys said that
they are coming from the bank.

2267
02:31:08,826 --> 02:31:10,123
I am a fool.

2268
02:31:10,327 --> 02:31:11,954
I showed her house to them.

2269
02:31:12,329 --> 02:31:14,957
I didn't know that they had
come to kidnap her.

2270
02:31:17,168 --> 02:31:18,635
Those who helped you
in committing the murder,

2271
02:31:18,836 --> 02:31:20,633
you killed them to destroy
the evidence.

2272
02:31:20,838 --> 02:31:23,306
We have found your hand print along
with the hand prints of those 4.

2273
02:31:23,507 --> 02:31:24,974
At the place of the incident.

2274
02:31:25,342 --> 02:31:27,810
There is evidence of
raping Annalakshmi.

2275
02:31:28,179 --> 02:31:28,975
What is this?

2276
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:31,148
Your honour forensic report stipulates,

2277
02:31:31,515 --> 02:31:33,312
that the semen of the accused Virumaandi,

2278
02:31:33,517 --> 02:31:35,144
matches with the semen, found in the
body of Annalakshmi.

2279
02:31:35,352 --> 02:31:37,149
Yes your honour. - Okay... Okay...

2280
02:31:37,521 --> 02:31:41,651
It has been proved that you had
sex with Annalakshmi by force.

2281
02:31:41,859 --> 02:31:42,655
Understood?

2282
02:31:43,027 --> 02:31:46,326
It is proved by the Post Mortem
report that you had raped her.

2283
02:31:46,697 --> 02:31:47,823
What? I raped her?

2284
02:31:48,365 --> 02:31:49,992
Then, are you denying it?

2285
02:31:50,201 --> 02:31:51,998
No, I didn't say 'no'.

2286
02:31:52,203 --> 02:31:54,000
Sir, it is true that
we brought that girl,

2287
02:31:54,205 --> 02:31:57,174
because we were afraid that Virumaandi
may kill us if we refused.

2288
02:31:57,374 --> 02:31:58,170
I swear.

2289
02:31:58,709 --> 02:32:00,836
Those people brought her
very roughly.

2290
02:32:01,045 --> 02:32:02,672
And made her as your sacrificial goat.

2291
02:32:03,214 --> 02:32:05,182
Your honour, that girl
struggled a lot,

2292
02:32:05,382 --> 02:32:06,849
and scratched you with her nail.

2293
02:32:07,218 --> 02:32:09,846
Your flesh has been found
in Annalakshmi nail.

2294
02:32:10,054 --> 02:32:11,851
You have a wound on your heart.

2295
02:32:12,056 --> 02:32:12,852
You have, haven't you?

2296
02:32:13,557 --> 02:32:14,023
Then?

2297
02:32:14,558 --> 02:32:15,855
After raping her, to destroy the evidences.

2298
02:32:16,060 --> 02:32:16,856
You killed that girl.

2299
02:32:17,061 --> 02:32:18,858
And you are asserting that
she committed suicide.

2300
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:20,527
Am I right?

2301
02:32:20,731 --> 02:32:24,030
Forensic report shows that
you had sex with that girl.

2302
02:32:24,568 --> 02:32:26,195
But you are saying that
you didn't rape that girl.

2303
02:32:26,403 --> 02:32:27,199
How is it possible?

2304
02:32:28,405 --> 02:32:30,202
Sir, there was no need
for me to rape her.

2305
02:32:30,908 --> 02:32:31,704
She was my wife.

2306
02:32:31,909 --> 02:32:32,876
Where did you get married?

2307
02:32:33,244 --> 02:32:38,546
I had performed
Virumaandi's parent's marriage.

2308
02:32:39,083 --> 02:32:43,042
I had only named him Virumaandi.

2309
02:32:43,587 --> 02:32:46,886
If he had told me, I would have
performed his marriage also.

2310
02:32:47,091 --> 02:32:48,388
He never told me.

2311
02:32:48,759 --> 02:32:52,058
So you mean to say that you didn't
perform his marriage in the temple?

2312
02:32:52,596 --> 02:32:55,895
Sir... what? I swear...
I didn't perform his marriage.

2313
02:32:56,600 --> 02:32:57,897
If it was performed,

2314
02:32:58,102 --> 02:33:00,730
then your statement will become false.

2315
02:33:00,938 --> 02:33:01,905
Okay, you go.

2316
02:33:02,106 --> 02:33:03,073
That's all, your honour.

2317
02:33:10,948 --> 02:33:14,247
Mr. Vaidiyanadhan, do you want to
re-examine accused No.1?

2318
02:33:15,286 --> 02:33:16,753
No, Not necessary your honour.

2319
02:33:16,954 --> 02:33:20,583
I want to re-examine A1.
I may be permitted please.

2320
02:33:20,791 --> 02:33:23,760
Permission granted.
- Thank you your honour.

2321
02:33:23,961 --> 02:33:26,429
Accused Virumaandi.

2322
02:33:30,801 --> 02:33:33,770
So, it is established that your marriage
wasn't performed in the temple.

2323
02:33:33,971 --> 02:33:37,099
Do you have any other record
of your marriage, like registration...

2324
02:33:38,142 --> 02:33:40,940
No sir, I don't have
that much knowledge.

2325
02:33:41,145 --> 02:33:42,942
I thought it was enough
if we inform the priest.

2326
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:45,948
You know how to registrar
your properties in the village,

2327
02:33:46,150 --> 02:33:47,617
how can I believe that
you didn't know this?

2328
02:33:48,152 --> 02:33:49,619
If you pretend to be good person
infront of people,

2329
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:51,617
you can't escape from the murder charge.

2330
02:33:51,822 --> 02:33:53,790
Sir, he hasn't committed any crime.

2331
02:33:53,991 --> 02:33:57,290
Those who are giving false
evidence such dogs will go to hell.

2332
02:33:57,661 --> 02:33:58,958
Kottalan Devan was behind this murder,

2333
02:33:59,163 --> 02:34:00,630
first call him to
the witness box.

2334
02:34:01,665 --> 02:34:05,795
Judge sir, give justice
to our brother.

2335
02:34:06,003 --> 02:34:07,630
Order...

2336
02:34:09,506 --> 02:34:10,632
Yes proceed.

2337
02:34:16,513 --> 02:34:17,309
Your honour,

2338
02:34:17,514 --> 02:34:21,143
Kottalan Devan, who has become an
approver & admitted his sins,

2339
02:34:21,352 --> 02:34:24,480
I humbly request you
to show mercy to him.

2340
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:31,828
There has been many murders
committed in 'kundarasu' garden.

2341
02:34:32,029 --> 02:34:33,826
Even though, Kottalan Devan is linked
with those murders,

2342
02:34:34,031 --> 02:34:36,158
since Virumaandi provoked him,

2343
02:34:36,367 --> 02:34:40,326
I humbly request you to give
him severe punishment.

2344
02:34:40,537 --> 02:34:41,663
In 'Theni' district.

2345
02:34:41,872 --> 02:34:48,835
Kottalan Devan, who helped
Virumaandi to commit 24 murders.

2346
02:34:49,213 --> 02:34:52,182
Under Sec. Act 302 of Indian Penal Code,

2347
02:34:52,383 --> 02:34:53,850
he has been given life imprisonment.

2348
02:34:54,218 --> 02:34:57,016
Under IPC Section 302,

2349
02:34:57,221 --> 02:35:01,521
accused no.1 Virumaandi
is sentenced to death.

2350
02:35:01,892 --> 02:35:05,350
Sir, why did you do like this?

2351
02:35:05,562 --> 02:35:09,020
Sir, please change the judgement.

2352
02:35:09,233 --> 02:35:10,530
Give sentence of death
to that rascal.

2353
02:35:12,069 --> 02:35:14,537
Sir, why did you give
him sentence to death.

2354
02:35:15,406 --> 02:35:16,373
After giving a deep thought.

2355
02:35:18,075 --> 02:35:19,542
After giving a deep thought.

2356
02:35:19,743 --> 02:35:21,210
Without any hesitation.

2357
02:35:21,412 --> 02:35:23,209
I am handing out this judgement to them.

2358
02:35:36,093 --> 02:35:38,220
<i>Come on, brother... Come on.</i>

2359
02:35:38,429 --> 02:35:39,225
<i>Hey catch him.</i>

2360
02:35:53,944 --> 02:35:55,411
<i>Break his hand and legs.</i>

2361
02:36:03,454 --> 02:36:03,920
<i>Even if you murders so many times,</i>

2362
02:36:04,121 --> 02:36:05,088
<i>you will be hanged only once.</i>

2363
02:36:09,293 --> 02:36:10,260
<i>Leave me.</i>

2364
02:36:10,461 --> 02:36:20,268
<i>Brother... Oh Godl</i>

2365
02:36:22,139 --> 02:36:24,107
Can you nullify my death sentence?

2366
02:36:25,309 --> 02:36:26,776
What can you give me? Man.

2367
02:36:26,977 --> 02:36:27,944
Hey talk respectfully.

2368
02:36:30,814 --> 02:36:31,940
Listen to me.

2369
02:36:32,649 --> 02:36:33,775
Anything that will make you happy,

2370
02:36:33,984 --> 02:36:34,780
I will make arrangements to get it for you.

2371
02:36:35,319 --> 02:36:37,617
I feel happy to see
you dying in this riot.

2372
02:36:37,821 --> 02:36:40,449
Come on... come on...
All of you come out.

2373
02:36:41,658 --> 02:36:43,285
Come... AII of you come out.

2374
02:36:48,999 --> 02:36:50,796
Kottalan?

2375
02:36:52,836 --> 02:36:53,461
What Kottalan?

2376
02:36:53,837 --> 02:36:55,304
I will give Kottalan
as the sacrificial goat.

2377
02:36:57,007 --> 02:36:58,804
You find that girl and the tape.

2378
02:36:59,176 --> 02:37:00,302
I will hand over Kottalan to you.

2379
02:37:01,345 --> 02:37:01,970
In this riot,

2380
02:37:02,179 --> 02:37:03,806
whatever you do, no one will
come to know about it.

2381
02:37:06,016 --> 02:37:07,142
How will you hand over Kottalan?

2382
02:37:07,518 --> 02:37:09,315
You find that girl and the camera.

2383
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:11,647
I will definitely hand him over to you.

2384
02:37:11,855 --> 02:37:14,483
Hey junior jailer sir
wants to talk to you.

2385
02:37:19,863 --> 02:37:24,664
What will I get in return?

2386
02:37:28,372 --> 02:37:29,339
Okay, I will do it?

2387
02:37:31,208 --> 02:37:32,175
Do you want that girl &
the tape?

2388
02:37:32,376 --> 02:37:34,003
2 persons? Okay.

2389
02:37:34,545 --> 02:37:36,513
Don't include 'Virumaandi in your list.
I will see to him,

2390
02:37:37,881 --> 02:37:39,178
Carry on. Okay.

2391
02:38:04,074 --> 02:38:05,200
Come on. - Come on...

2392
02:38:08,912 --> 02:38:10,038
Brother that lady...

2393
02:38:11,915 --> 02:38:14,713
She's running away along with that man.

2394
02:38:17,754 --> 02:38:18,220
Give me that.

2395
02:38:18,422 --> 02:38:19,548
What are you doing?

2396
02:38:21,425 --> 02:38:24,053
What is it? They may come here.
- Come on.

2397
02:38:49,119 --> 02:38:49,585
Brother.

2398
02:39:10,474 --> 02:39:11,941
Leave me.

2399
02:39:18,649 --> 02:39:19,115
Beat him.

2400
02:39:21,485 --> 02:39:22,110
Beat him again.

2401
02:39:22,486 --> 02:39:23,783
I had beaten him.
- Beat him again.

2402
02:39:30,494 --> 02:39:31,290
That's enough! Come.

2403
02:39:34,665 --> 02:39:36,132
Sir, where are you going?

2404
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,467
I want to meet Chennai jailer.
- Then?

2405
02:39:38,669 --> 02:39:40,637
I don't know anything. I have to
hand you over to Peikaman.

2406
02:39:47,010 --> 02:39:47,476
Stop.

2407
02:40:50,574 --> 02:40:51,040
Come.

2408
02:41:02,753 --> 02:41:03,219
Come...

2409
02:41:15,599 --> 02:41:16,566
Go... go...

2410
02:41:27,110 --> 02:41:28,407
Hey, where is the camera?

2411
02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:30,746
Hey, if you come near me,
I will kill her.

2412
02:41:31,948 --> 02:41:35,076
Hey, don't come. I will kill her.
- Kill her.

2413
02:42:04,314 --> 02:42:06,782
Hey, leave him. Catch him.

2414
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:10,964
Sir, we are all waiting for you.

2415
02:44:11,274 --> 02:44:12,241
Have you sent the Firing squad inside?

2416
02:44:12,442 --> 02:44:13,067
Yes sir.

2417
02:44:15,612 --> 02:44:16,237
I am telling the truth.

2418
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:19,578
Enquiry can start, only
if the jailer comes and gives the report.

2419
02:44:20,784 --> 02:44:23,252
If you allow policemen
to file FIR. That's all!

2420
02:44:24,788 --> 02:44:26,585
Did he murder 24 persons?

2421
02:44:27,624 --> 02:44:29,091
Didn't I file a FIR &
got him death sentence?

2422
02:44:30,460 --> 02:44:32,428
If jailer comes outside,
you will also face the same situation.

2423
02:44:33,463 --> 02:44:34,430
Don't allow him to come outside.

2424
02:44:34,965 --> 02:44:38,594
Oh No! My God!

2425
02:44:40,303 --> 02:44:42,601
This tape is an important evidence.

2426
02:44:44,641 --> 02:44:48,270
I believe you more than Peikaman.

2427
02:44:49,312 --> 02:44:52,110
We should immediately
take her and the tape outside.

2428
02:44:56,152 --> 02:44:57,119
They have given the shooting order.

2429
02:44:58,321 --> 02:45:01,119
Don't go in prisioner's dress.
They will shoot you.

2430
02:45:01,992 --> 02:45:03,789
You wear one of our men's dress
who is lying wounded.

2431
02:45:04,828 --> 02:45:06,125
Hereafter they don't need this.

2432
02:45:19,509 --> 02:45:22,478
Hey move away. Don't disturb.
- Can't you listen to me?

2433
02:45:22,679 --> 02:45:25,477
No comments.

2434
02:45:25,682 --> 02:45:26,979
Everything is in our control.

2435
02:45:28,184 --> 02:45:31,642
Please break the front door.

2436
02:45:39,029 --> 02:45:40,496
I should break the door.

2437
02:45:41,031 --> 02:45:42,498
Carry sir, let's take him.

2438
02:45:43,867 --> 02:45:45,164
No I am dead meat.

2439
02:45:45,535 --> 02:45:46,001
Sir.

2440
02:45:46,703 --> 02:45:47,829
Don't be lumbered with me unnecessarily.

2441
02:45:48,872 --> 02:45:50,169
You don't worry about me.

2442
02:45:50,874 --> 02:45:55,174
I want to safe guard
my honour, understood? - Yes sir.

2443
02:46:15,899 --> 02:46:17,696
No harm should come to our people.

2444
02:46:18,234 --> 02:46:21,362
If anything comes, shoot at sight.
You don't worry.

2445
02:46:23,239 --> 02:46:25,707
What is happening there?

2446
02:46:26,743 --> 02:46:28,040
There is a riot here.

2447
02:46:34,084 --> 02:46:36,211
He has escaped. I am searching for him.

2448
02:46:37,921 --> 02:46:44,724
He too has gone.
- Okay, I will come there.

2449
02:46:44,928 --> 02:46:45,895
If there's any danger,

2450
02:46:46,096 --> 02:46:47,563
He will take care of everything.
You don't worry.

2451
02:46:49,933 --> 02:46:51,230
Who? Who is going to leave?

2452
02:46:51,935 --> 02:46:54,733
Excuse me sir. If you permit,
I will go inside.

2453
02:46:56,439 --> 02:46:58,066
Virumaandi, I shouldn't be doing this.

2454
02:46:59,109 --> 02:47:01,407
I will give you this
trusting you. Take it.

2455
02:47:01,778 --> 02:47:03,746
Take this. Take this.

2456
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:07,075
Sir, no... I am not used to it.

2457
02:47:08,284 --> 02:47:11,412
Thank God. Don't learn also.

2458
02:47:11,788 --> 02:47:13,585

know all these things.

It won't work out...
It will not.

2462

Come on... man... come on.
Throw it down.

2463

Come on. Take.

2464
02:47:30,473 --> 02:47:32,441

file FIR. That's all!

him the death sentence?

he hadn't committed,

02:52:58,301 --> 02:52:59,768
If they forgive and release me.

2512
02:52:59,969 --> 02:53:01,266
I don't wish to live.

2513
02:53:01,471 --> 02:53:05,931
I will be grateful to them
& try to be a good person.

2514
02:53:07,477 --> 02:53:11,277
If you ask me, will I be happy?
No sir.

2515
02:53:12,982 --> 02:53:16,440
I would just count my days
in the absence of Annalakshmi.

2516
02:53:16,652 --> 02:53:17,118
That is it.

2517
02:53:17,820 --> 02:53:20,948
If they decide that
I am a bad person, a criminal,

2518
02:53:21,157 --> 02:53:22,954
and sentence me to death.

2519
02:53:24,327 --> 02:53:25,624
Sir, I'll accept that also.

2520
02:53:26,662 --> 02:53:28,289
As Annalakshmi died,

2521
02:53:29,332 --> 02:53:32,961
I will be happy thinking,
I am also dying like her.

2522
02:53:35,338 --> 02:53:37,306
Sir, Annalakshmi used to
tell one thing frequently,

2523
02:53:38,841 --> 02:53:40,308
Those who know to forgive,
are called 'human being',

2524
02:53:42,512 --> 02:53:44,980
and those who ask for forgiveness
are great persons.

2525
02:53:46,182 --> 02:53:47,149
Those who ask for forgiveness,

2526
02:53:47,683 --> 02:53:48,479
are great persons.

2527
02:53:49,185 --> 02:53:52,313
Sir, now I am trying to
become a great man.

2528
02:53:55,191 --> 02:53:59,821
Law will change and one day
it will give respect to human beings.

2529
02:54:00,029 --> 02:54:02,156
Instead of waiting for that.

2530
02:54:02,865 --> 02:54:08,667
I too support doctor Aanjala
who is struggling to initiate reforms in it.

2531
02:54:09,372 --> 02:54:10,839
But Doctor Aanjala.

2532
02:54:11,541 --> 02:54:13,338
If we abolish Death Sentence,

2533
02:54:13,876 --> 02:54:15,503
Murderer will lose the fear of
extreme punishment,

2534
02:54:16,045 --> 02:54:17,512
and won't the percentage
of crimes increase?

2535
02:54:18,381 --> 02:54:20,508
That is unsubstantiated hypothesis.

2536
02:54:21,551 --> 02:54:25,681
85 countries in the world have
abolished Death Sentence.

2537
02:54:26,222 --> 02:54:30,022
But India which supports Ahimsa
is still hesitating to do it.

2538
02:54:31,394 --> 02:54:32,691
According to me,

2539
02:54:32,895 --> 02:54:36,353
except natural death,

2540
02:54:36,566 --> 02:54:37,362
other deaths are murders!
