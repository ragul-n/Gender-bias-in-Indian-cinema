1
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:15,864
Have you ever loved? lf so you'll
understand what cinema has told us.

2
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,527
All the happy ending
tales of love are a lie!

3
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,003
ln life there is no happy endings.

4
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,004
A hero walking towards sunset
holding hand of heroine in slow motion.

5
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,682
Which you'll find only in a cinema.

6
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,411
ln real life what you see
is people like me.

7
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,020
Now l'll tell my story. The story
of hundred days in my life.

8
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,862
My 100 days of love.

9
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:53,704
The story is not starting
from here, this is climax.

10
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,103
The 100th day in this story.
Lets go to day one.

11
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,513
That day was also like today.

12
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:47,957
l'm BKN, don't think this is my
name. That's not our topic.

13
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,116
One topic is this girl. Pia Menon.

14
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,175
Rather than saying my ex girl friend...

15
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,118
...its more correct to
say l'm her ex boy friend.

16
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:53,658
This is not alcohol, this is
the 'fevicol' for heart break.

17
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:11,874
Pia!

18
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,070
There was something
between us earlier.

19
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,343
But all those things have ended. ls
it my fault that you became a loser?

20
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,578
ls this the balance ofthe bad words
that you showered previously?

21
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,681
Still you are thinking only about me,
which only you need to know, is it?

22
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,953
Why are you making it public?

23
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,131
What are you saying that l did?
lf you want to be ashamed, carry on.

24
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,269
But don't involve me into that one.

25
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,134
From now on don't come to my life.
l don't want to hear anything about you.

26
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:29,245
Now l'm viral, in total 638 comments.
ln all the abuses l'm being tagged.

27
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,754
For publically scolding ex girl
friend who has left after dumping.

28
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,329
ln 9 countries and more languages
it is being put on trend presently.

29
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:57,772
Alcohol not only for health, at certain
times it is injurious to respect also.

30
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:15,390
l'm sorry, to save you l tried my best.

31
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,327
But that editor is
really adamant to the core.

32
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:23,033
To tell the truth, l had to
set ready the termination letter.

33
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:31,142
There is no reason for you to be
upset. Just think we don't deserve you.

34
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,380
Tomorrow morning come to
the office and clearyour desk.

35
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:44,428
Till a week before, l was a smart
feature writer at The Times.

36
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:49,525
Certain creative differences with the
editor. He felt, l'm bit out spoken.

37
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,036
A small argument and
followed by that a suspension.

38
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,897
Within a week time, look,
now there is termination.

39
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,301
Everything is cheap politics.

40
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:11,012
This is the turning point ofthe story.
Ladies and gentle men, boys and girls.

41
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:18,753
ln the mist ofthis city lights, in this
rain my life is going to change forever.

42
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,416
That smile of hers.

43
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,282
All the sorrows on that
day vanished in that smile.

44
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,144
Everyone will have a
life changing moment.

45
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,110
My life changing moment was her!

46
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,642
One bag, one camera,
one adventure.

47
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,986
Biggest adventure in
my life was starting from there.

48
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,580
As usual along with
my best friend Ummer.

49
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,099
What was left behind me
was one AK 47 and a grenade.

50
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,295
And then?
On my left hand corner, behind the tree.

51
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,464
There was an enemy soldier.
l knew that.

52
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,575
After killing him only,
l can take his weapons.

53
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,410
But l can't move from that trench.

54
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,677
He and me into a cat mouse game!

55
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,986
For his assistance a big tank comes,
from it ten soldiers drives outjumping.

56
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,925
l throw the bomb, four people dead!

57
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,457
With the AK 47 with me l fire at the
rest of the men inside the trench.

58
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,092
My health is declined.
Only two people are left out.

59
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,500
With two bullets!

60
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,374
My aim did not go
wrong, both hit the target.

61
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,008
But!
What?

62
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,943
When l looked back, the
soldier behind the tree, gun fire!

63
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:03,696
Between the life and death,
only seconds left must be careful.

64
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,199
Level 14, there is no chance
that you reaching there.

65
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,533
Anyway play and see.

66
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:20,576
This is the life of Ummer. For those
who believe life is between Sofa and TV.

67
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,578
For them, a video game rental
store which is run by Ummer.

68
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,148
Ummer's Pad.
U Pad.

69
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,479
His biggest passion is to do the
gaming by sitting here for whole day.

70
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,451
Our U Pad is finished is it not?

71
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,721
Do you have only me as your client?
Hey man, man!

72
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,361
lfyou play more,
l'll finish you, go home man.

73
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,368
Bhai, do you have cheat code?
This is the problem with your generation.

74
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,304
Can't struggle, try to win
with a struggle.

75
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,208
A real gamer will never
use the cheat code.

76
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,275
Again if you come to my
store asking for cheat codes.

77
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,762
Ha! ls Face Book celebrity sitting
here by closing the door?.

78
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,106
Son, this l'll upload it
on Face Book and Twitter.

79
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,104
Bad! You could have thought
about my image at least.

80
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,615
How will l show up my face
outside telling you are my friend?

81
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,151
Too bad even the Zuckerberg,
might have read your comments.

82
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,246
Being your friend l also got lot of
verbally abusing messages.

83
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,684
Hey fellow! Has he gone mad
on hearing the bad words?

84
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,392
Hey fellow!

85
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,527
Ummer!
My god, what is next, fellow?

86
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,534
Today l saw her, man.

87
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,301
The one!
What one?

88
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,672
Yea, there is camera is it?

89
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,840
Now we can take some photos
and upload love failure albums.

90
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,115
How is it?

91
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,750
The incident happened
today evening.

92
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,285
She got inside the same
taxi that l waved to stop.

93
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,221
While getting inside this
camera fell down from her hands.

94
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,594
The vehicle went to somewhere.

95
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:29,438
But Ummachi, that smile
of hers, man.

96
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,215
The one!
Again, what a pity!

97
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:43,284
Your grudge to the race
offemales, is it only this much?

98
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,350
The one is not yet over,
then comes the next one.

99
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,254
l've brought the food,
ifyou want come and eat.

100
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,722
Otherwise no need, you sit
here holding this, l'll go and eat.

101
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,897
You just try to remember,
daily we are seeing lot of girls.

102
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,867
Does everyone attract us?
How many we will notice?

103
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,906
When l eat food
l don't notice anything.

104
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,377
Do not disturb, please.

105
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:17,852
Now a crowd, among the hundreds of
people we are catching only two eyes.

106
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,218
That very moment.
Everyone had such a thing.

107
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,694
ls it correct?
Yea, its correct. Really correct.

108
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,231
But once that moment is over.

109
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,630
They will drop their eyes
and they'll go their way.

110
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,374
Don't know, this is not like that.

111
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,411
A kind of gut feeling.

112
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,182
That smile of hers, a feeling, again
somewhere that smile is to be seen.

113
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,217
lts a good feeling to
go afterthese kind of dreams.

114
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,853
Ummer, don't you have
these kind of dreams?

115
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,918
Why not? Must develop a game
that will shock the entire world.

116
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,789
All the game lovers
should be chilled!

117
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,333
Again with super models
and infinite amount of dollars.

118
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,438
Must travel throughout this world.

119
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,339
There is no point in talking to you.
ln your mind there is only guns.

120
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,172
There are no roses.
Rose?

121
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,772
Go and sleep man, he
and his gun and crap!

122
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,654
Ummachi, why not we go
in search of her?.

123
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,757
This is all like playing a game, no?

124
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,727
Hey fellow!

125
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,981
What did you say man?
Like playing a game?

126
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,020
This is received from that bag of
the camera. They are negatives.

127
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,683
l didn't check the bag properly.

128
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,553
What you said is true,
its like playing a game.

129
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,991
This film roll is the clue which
we have. The clue in the hand.

130
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,322
The brain in the head,
if both are used properly.

131
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,593
Can easily complete any level.

132
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,995
Why don't we develop this film?

133
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,605
No, that is all a cheap thing is it?
What will she think?

134
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,837
She is not your aunty's
daughter is it?

135
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,279
But still no need of that.
Then no need, go man.

136
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,386
He and his camera, what over
here people have not seen camera?

137
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,286
Ummer!
What is it man?

138
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,554
Why don't we develop that photos?

139
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,631
That is all very cheap
thing, what will she think?

140
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,998
What will she think? She is
not my aunty's daughter, is it?

141
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,771
Like that we decided
to develop that film roll.

142
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,409
Saying as per Ummer's
language, level one.

143
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,011
Do you know what this one is?
Camera.

144
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,713
This is a work of art, this is a
SLR camera, during the 80's.

145
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,416
Like today, during those times
everyone could not do photography.

146
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,390
lts a film roll where only
12 photos can be taken.

147
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,999
Once it is taken, that is it
can't be deleted or replaced.

148
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,697
During the era of
lnstagram and selfies.

149
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,836
lf she has got a camera like this.

150
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,905
That means she has got
something to tell us.

151
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,105
Behind each ofthe photos
in this, there will be a story.

152
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,639
Why don't we go in
search of that story.

153
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,779
Not that, during this age when
there is camera even inside a pen.

154
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,441
Hats offto her for carrying
an old camera like this.

155
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,381
By the way, have you
seen any grandmothers?

156
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,382
Get inside the vehicle.

157
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,491
Here, will go home and check.

158
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:52,096
lts a film roll where 12 photos
can be taken, has taken only 7.

159
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,435
This two are gone, did you
see its blurred.

160
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,908
And the rest is five in the hand.

161
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,111
Dasa, which is this jerk, man?

162
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,453
Yea, good, has got a
villain's photo in the first place.

163
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,960
Anyway your one is there
and then one jerk, is there.

164
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,862
And lot of places which
we do not know.

165
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,071
What is the specialty
ofthese places?

166
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,402
lf it were the ordinary tourist spots
could have understood better.

167
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,512
When you told initially, l thought
its your usual romantic notion.

168
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,511
Now it looks all though its true.

169
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,640
There is some sort of connection
between these photos and places.

170
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,550
At first we'll find out these places.

171
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,850
All your adventure spirit, why don't
you limit that only on gaming?

172
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,529
Why not we have an adventure
in this boring life of ours?

173
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,094
What ifthis is an augury?

174
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,097
Like the dialogue
in our 'Casablanca'

175
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,172
Of all the towns in this world.
ln the mist of all taxi.

176
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,484
She came and got into yourtaxi.
Can it be an augury?

177
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,921
Okay, agreed.

178
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,859
Finding out the places in this photos.
After that, we reach to her.

179
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,685
And then?
Then you people fall in love.

180
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,122
Exchange the hearts.

181
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:33,471
As ifto envy others, you'll sing
and dance throughout this city.

182
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:06,731
''You are seen only in the dreams
without fading, eyes safe guards it''

183
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:14,745
''Foreverwill open the doors
ofthe heart for you, always''

184
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:23,244
''Like a whiff, on some day
you came in front of me''

185
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:31,087
''Why did you vanish
foreverto somewhere?''

186
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:41,199
''Always the music danced
within me, searched only for you''

187
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:14,906
''Overthe ears l'll pass it on to you
certain dear things very silently...''

188
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,135
''...from now on''

189
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:26,614
''As the blue skies spills
offto the shore''

190
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:34,690
''Shall adore you with
anklets that fizzles''

191
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:42,733
''All though covered by clouds
swings on the silence''

192
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:50,606
''Lovely star l search for you
within the bud ofthe heart''

193
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:58,213
''lfyou weren't in the dream
l would have been lonely''

194
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:06,982
''During the times when
you come, l become a spring''

195
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:17,195
''Always the music danced within
me, searched only for you''

196
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,235
This is the sub editor of
Times at Bangalore branch.

197
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:55,770
Marry Mariyam Mathew. Mid
30's hails from Pala a Christian.

198
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,898
The only well wisher
of mine in this office.

199
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,847
Yea, have you reached? Come, sit.

200
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,715
There is no reason
for you to be off, like this.

201
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,914
The world is not limited to this office,
no? You really have got lot of skills.

202
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,420
Everything will be fine.

203
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,424
Forthe last 20 to 25 years,
parents say the same thing.

204
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,733
The only difference, why fellow
are you not becoming settled?

205
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,834
Why don't you call? After all
they are your parents, aren't they?

206
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,939
Then shall l leave?
l'm not boring you, sitting here.

207
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,781
As l'm chucked out, he'll be
made permanent is it not?

208
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,186
That itching worm!

209
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,191
More than making him permanent,
as you were fired from job.

210
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,298
ln that happiness distributed
sweets to everyone in the morning.

211
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,957
Anyway don't be a prey
to his eyes, he is waiting.

212
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,434
Why man are you going
without meeting me? Sweety!

213
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,234
He is my enemy numbertwo.

214
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,001
Romanch(Goosebumps) Ramakrishnan.

215
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:42,479
Or else itching worm! After irritating
me at school and college.

216
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,975
We both jointly got appointed
forjob over here.

217
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,382
After 6 months of probation period.
The one who is smarter among us.

218
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,351
Will be made permanent that
was the management's condition.

219
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,390
You don't have any otherjob
after going is it? You come here.

220
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,822
Ha! Come.

221
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:01,262
You and l know very well, there
should be only me in this company.

222
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,866
Then right from olden times,
your fate is to fail before me.

223
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,404
Hey that is not your problem man,
god has designed some people like that.

224
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,797
Come.

225
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,869
Because ofthis you have an
advantage, ask what is that? Ask man.

226
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,975
Two months ofyours
didn't get wasted, no?

227
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,984
Not yet finished saying, come.

228
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:28,048
To share your sorrows, you
have got only me is it?

229
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,888
To share my happiness,
l've got you, is it not?

230
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,021
This happiness of mine
which is very popular.

231
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,565
After sharing with others,
this is the balance of it.

232
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:41,066
You take this. Don't stand,
lot more to say. Come, come.

233
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,871
What is this as if
without any affection? Come.

234
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,306
Sit.

235
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,276
We can sit and talk something.

236
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,984
l've made this 6 months back.

237
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,319
Will see you at the
coffee shop at evening.

238
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:09,295
Ha! Sit, one minute.
Can you leave empty handed?

239
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,311
ln an expensive city like Bangalore.
That too without a job.

240
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,071
ln the mist oftraffic lights.
l can't see you begging for food.

241
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,480
Man, l can't see that
sitting in my AC car.

242
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,621
Each time for Rs. 50
you can eat tummy full.

243
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,186
Once this is finished,
you come and see me, okay.

244
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,293
Again l'll give, here.

245
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:50,936
What is this?

246
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,271
Haven't you told this is
like playing a game?

247
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,175
Forthat should not be idle
like this, should play in full spirit.

248
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,311
You forget about the
rest ofthe two photos.

249
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,052
Only these two photos
are sufficient for us to find her.

250
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,483
The chance is this
must be a college lab.

251
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,649
And this one a cinema theater,
both must be in this city only.

252
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,329
This is easy to find
both ofthese, no?

253
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,155
But forthat there are lot
oftheaters in this city.

254
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,891
Hey fool, do you see only her?

255
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,002
Behind her, look close.

256
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,605
That is the poster of an
old Kannada movie of Raj Kumar.

257
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:24,598
That is correct.

258
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,405
Man, how many theaters will be
there showing the movies of Raj Kumar?

259
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,209
We found out that
lab and that theater.

260
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,249
Come man.
Are you Malayalees?

261
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,689
Yes.
Do you know?

262
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,350
Let me see that photo.

263
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,029
Will you give this photo to me?
For what?

264
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,563
After all she is a girl who
has come here, no?

265
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,793
Let this be with me, for
memories. Children!

266
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,602
What a wish of an old man?

267
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,201
Are you all an old man?

268
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,774
Yours...

269
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,682
Brother, take this.
Here.

270
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,551
Since forthe last 5 years all
the magazines are inside this.

271
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,655
Thanks brother.

272
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,059
Take a look fellow,

273
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,195
But our luck ended there.

274
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:17,139
Look, as we got inside the college,
missing our college days is it not?

275
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,850
l don't miss that much.

276
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,850
Do you remember that
day when we first met?

277
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:29,121
Even if forgets own father and
mother, l won't forget that day.

278
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,507
Hey fellow, stand straight.

279
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,162
You come here fellow.

What is your name?

282
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,379
Okay carry on being

284

Shake well and do it.

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,519
Go.
Stop there fellow.

286
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,761

00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,349
Tell the name you fat guy.

289
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,786
Umm..Ummer!

292
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,933
Move back l say.

What is your name?

294
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,412
Asking whats your name?

295
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,485
B.K.N
Are you any literary person?

296
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,353
Fellow, tell your full name.

297
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,485
Balan K Nair.

298
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,224
What?

299
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:57,563
What is this man? ls it Udaya studio?
Has the old villains joined together?

300
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,851
Okay start.
What?

301
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,897
My shirt!

302
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,442
Torn.

303
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,645
Leave it Ummer.

304
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,387
Just think everything
happened in a weak moment.

305
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,723
Looks like our parents have
not seen old Malayalam movies.

306
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,466
l should blame my grandfather.

307
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,662
Before l was born,
a month back he died.

308
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:05,342
As motherwas shocked.
She had put his name to me.

309
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,105
Along with father's name and name
of the caste, that became Balan K Nair.

310
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,064
Hey fellow, aren't you watching
the game? lndia will fail again.

311
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,361
Which game?
Why asking which game?

312
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,667
What are you scribbling?

313
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,814
lsn't this our Obama?

314
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,956
Your crazy madness of
drawing did it start again?

315
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,651
This is not like the old
one, this is a comic strip.

316
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,759
ln this there will be international
as well as lndian politics.

317
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:06,030
Barack Obama is the hero. Anyway
there is no otherjob, isn't it?

318
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,497
You play video games and l draw.

319
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,668
Then what? An international artist.

320
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:22,885
People are struck in the level two.
At that time Barack Obama.

321
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,081
Ummachi..l don't think
all this will work out.

322
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,054
Bangalore, is a city
where lakhs of people live.

323
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,562
We are the fools to search for
a girl, with two or three photos.

324
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,792
What is the surety
that she is in this city?

325
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,166
Hey fellow, a game is
never stopped in between.

326
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,464
We fail in a game, when
we don't use the clues.

327
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:47,738
What we've with us is living photos.
What if she is girl friend of someone?

328
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,881
Minimum must be
the sister of someone.

329
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,417
Whatever be the scenario
in this, its not good for us.

330
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,184
Even if she is found
out, what will l say to her?

331
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,154
Hey, we once had seen
on a rainy night.

332
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,996
You had gone in a taxi
which l showed the hand.

333
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,756
On that day, l got your
camera which was lost.

334
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:16,040
l've developed all the photos in it.
With that l traced you and found you.

335
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,235
As the things have reached
this far, why don't we love?

336
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,174
Good, marvelous.

337
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:29,516
So, this is how you talk to girls, is it?
No doubt why that girl dumped you.

338
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,956
First of all we'll find her. Then l'll tell
what to say, how to say and all.

339
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,926
This is what fellow, l say once
in a while must play a game.

340
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,158
Step by step, that is
the procedure of that.

341
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,265
On the matter of games
or on the matter of girls.

342
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,132
That is true, on the matter of girls...

343
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,076
...our Ummer, who is virgin is the
last word in this Bangalore city.

344
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,209
While delegated with a task.

345
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,517
Anyone will be startled, on
seeing Ummer's dedication.

346
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,521
The itching worm!

347
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,930
Simply a dream!

348
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,600
Why? Have you finished
all your food vouchers?

349
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,970
l came to see you Romanch
(Goosebumps).

350
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,840
During the times of a dire need,
only you were there to help me.

351
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,849
lfthose food vouchers
weren't there...

352
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,854
l'm l disturbing you?

353
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:49,290
Did you see this? ln the employee
ofthe month l'm also short listed.

354
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:55,863
To all those jerks who doesn't
vote for me, l was sending the spam.

355
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,344
For the help which you
did, l came to say one thanks.

356
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:18,152
ls this our Ummer?
ls he still alive?

357
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,123
Who is this?
Will tell all that.

358
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,168
To fail you, l've kept ready
a deadly idea.

359
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,130
To fail me?

360
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,302
This is a new feature,
it will be a sure shot hit.

361
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,234
An idea which can
impress the editor.

362
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,709
What is it?

363
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,108
Hidden Bangalore.

364
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,910
lts a contest which can
be started in our city supplement.

365
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,815
We are publishing some photos
of certain places at Bangalore.

366
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,114
Which are not famous.

367
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,088
From those readers who identify this
correctly, we'll announce one winner.

368
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,785
How is it?

369
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,164
Anyway you got my job, so
let this idea also be yours.

370
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,129
Can blurthe face ofthis person.

371
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,202
l'll send the mail regarding
the details of places.

372
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,705
Was this your deadly thought?
lnitially when you told. Not that.

373
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:07,708
As per your lQ level this
one is beyond the limit!

374
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:11,279
Doesn't matter, let me think over it.

375
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,245
l had told the matter to sub editor.
He has liked it also.

376
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,786
You convince the editor also.

377
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,384
Romanch, you are the
employee of the month.

378
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,991
So shall l take leave.
All the best.

379
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,802
A tom fool!

380
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,033
What a fool he is.

381
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:54,816
You sit here drawing him. One day
l'll take all this and send to Obama.

382
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:59,088
Obama, will give the
quotation to F.B.l, to kill you.

383
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,903
Which is this girl?

384
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,044
Who is this?
Let her be anyone. What is it to you?

385
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,111
The fellow who has come to play
the game, must play the game.

386
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,441
lsn't this that cafe which is
near our Pinky aunty's house?

387
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,879
What did you say? PinkyAunty.

388
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,145
Which Pinky Aunty?
Do you know the cafe?

389
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,855
Near to our college,
the owner is a tough guy.

390
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,345
Show it man.

391
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,085
Have you come to drink tea?

392
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,058
Finished drinking tea?
No.

393
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,490
Go, go, has come
with a photo, out, out!

394
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,498
Why is he saying like this?
Come man.

395
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,266
Otherwise, we'll...

396
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,308
Hey man, if she is
staying in this area.

397
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,110
No chance that she
won't see this notice board.

398
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,151
Why not we paste this photo's copy
along with our details, over here?

399
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,552
lf not her, someone knowing her
might see, will that be okay?

400
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,753
Hey smart boy at certain times
you are really a big thing, man.

401
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,156
ls it so?
Truly.

402
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,990
Only during certain times.

403
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:42,291
Mr. Nair are you a Malayalee?
As if l've heard Malayalam.

404
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,085
Hey fellow, says she is Malayalee.

405
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,925
Yes, child please say.
Can you return my bag?

406
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,827
At last has found you, is it?

407
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,564
Can't you be little more
careful on these things?

408
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,837
Thank you Chetta (brother).
For keeping it safe till now.

409
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,439
lf it was received in someone else's
hand, it can be never received.

410
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,237
That is sure, no?
Then no need to call me chetta, and all.

411
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,439
Go man! Anyway we'll meet.

412
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,586
To be sure of the person, can you
confirm what was inside that bag?

413
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,285
Sure, one lip stick, one nail polish
and one packet of care free.

414
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,354
Who are you, girl?
Not girl but a male.

415
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:25,301
A male!
Hang and go man, you psycho!

416
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:33,570
This unknown jerk, from now
on he'll be known as psycho!

417
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:38,476
On the matter of making me mad, he
was the father of our itching worm!

418
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,248
Chetta, will you return my thing?

419
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,486
He has become a big nuisance.
Has he called again?

420
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:51,023
He is calling from this number,
note it. 890 8911 111

421
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,496
lf l get him in my hand, l'll kill
him by chopping. l'll also kill!

422
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,394
He and his double..

423
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:02,100
Even if she gets grand children,
Ummer won't quit from the game.

424
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,173
Because ofthat l thought
of putting a full stop to this.

425
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,510
Hey fellow stop it.

426
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,382
Because of yourjumping...

427
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,350
...earth quake will happen at Mrs.
Chopra's place at down stairs.

428
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,952
Yea, next level.

429
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,264
That was not required.

430
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,138
Here it comes, jump.

431
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,044
Ummer!
Stopped, stopped!

432
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,379
Look at this one?

433
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,718
Take a look!

434
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,648
These pictures are blurred one, no?
Look closely.

435
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,756
Hey man, this is you is it not?

436
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,133
What if she knows you?

437
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,577
What if it is a game by her?

438
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,511
What if she is watching
you, by staying aloof?

439
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,748
Hey man this is a 50-50 photo.

440
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,259
Sometimes completely by random
l was imprinted on this somehow.

441
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:34,219
Exactly at the right time, exactly
at the right place. How?

442
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,330
Otherwise yourtheory
will be correct. l don't know.

443
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,762
Anyway must find an answerto this.

444
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,596
Only after finding her,
we'll get out of this.

445
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,675
Today is Friday, never mind if
this weekend is allotted forthis.

446
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,105
We'll find out till the
last clues in these photos.

447
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,311
Photos!
Here.

448
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,824
Clue!
Shut up! His last clues!

449
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,478
Where is that phone?

450
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,490
Your Romanchan got suspended.

451
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,566
That flop feature of hidden
Bangalore was published in the paper.

452
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,430
After convincing the editor. He had
written the feature in the paper.

453
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,705
Don't know is it due to
frustration ofthat or not?

454
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,438
There was office party being
held two days back isn't it?

455
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:58,442
After having two, the complaint is he
misbehaved with Nikitha, on sports.

456
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,079
Heard that got two slaps from her.

457
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,753
ln the morning from the head office
the suspension Email has reached.

458
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:09,757
By the by, your friend our editor
got transferred to Bombay office.

459
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:13,124
Till the new editorjoins,
l'm the stand by editor.

460
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:21,366
l've re- appointed you. You can
resume in your feature writer post.

461
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,864
How can l say thank you?

462
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:30,202
No need to say thanks and all when
new editorjoins, don't fight with him.

463
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:35,211
And by the way where is he now?
Poor one, is clearing the desk.

464
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,556
What was the name ofthe
girl that you told at sports?

465
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,122
Nikitha.

466
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,292
l'll replace this and give.

467
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,684
Why are you going without
seeing me, sweety?

468
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,692
You are not having
any job, do you? Come.

469
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,756
Come on!

470
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,668
l came to know the things
and all, never mind man.

471
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,230
But still you received
a slap from a girl, is it?

472
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,601
She has learned Judo.

473
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,812
Your old cabin is my new cabin.

474
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,642
While joining l'm putting
the name board and all.

475
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,979
l'm sad while thinking
about your case.

476
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:45,952
On learning that you were being
chucked out on a female issue.

477
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,757
Then its very tough to get a
placement in other places. ls it?

478
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,521
l was justjoking is it? You are
Romanch, is it? Master of all arts.

479
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,792
Even ifyou sit at home, won't you
invent next apple and face book?

480
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:01,399
Like someone has told..

481
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,741
l was the one!

482
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,741
Now if you have any
needs, you can call me.

483
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,279
From next week onwards when
l come to office in company car.

484
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,483
l can't bear to see you
begging under the traffic lights.

485
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:20,312
Because ofthat for
free, food vouchers!

486
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,515
No need.

487
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,298
Back to routine is it?

488
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:34,427
Actually missing him, as if
there is no competition.

489
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,431
Today evening at hotel Leela,
there is a product launch event.

490
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,477
You should cover that. l've
emailed two entry passes.

491
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,488
What is this man?

492
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,877
Umm..You thiefwhere is my thing?
Hang and go man.

493
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,773
lfyou have the guts
give me your address.

494
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:21,009
For what? ls it to courier it? Chetta,
that will be all trouble foryou, won't it?

495
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,287
Hey fellow come.
What?

496
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,890
Not what? Who? Come.

497
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,618
Look!

498
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,702
This is thatjerk in the photo, no?
The very same jerk.

499
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,997
But still all these days after
searching her, haven't thought of him.

500
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,841
What if she is in here?

501
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,310
Search!
No, this way.

502
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,427
Anyway she is not here.

503
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,570
But he is the lifeline given by god.

504
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:20,699
lfyou don't use this lifeline correctly,
you'll have to say bye to your one.

505
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:25,403
But how to go and talk,
what if he misunderstands us?

506
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:29,077
Even otherwise you don't have
the experience to handle these things.

507
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,120
For the time being you wait here.
l'll go and talk.

508
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,358
How many plays
had Ummer played?

509
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,893
Please don't ruin it.

510
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,827
Hey man, he is a Malayalee!

511
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,829
He is not like how we
thought, he is extremely decent.

512
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,559
He knows her and has also
told he'll help us.

513
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,504
Why are you not convinced?

514
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,442
Afterthe program has told that
will meet at the underground parking.

515
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,102
You believe at that time.

516
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,983
lts time for him to come.

517
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:41,788
As seen in movies and all, some hit
men coming out from here and there.

518
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,822
Will they whack us?
Go man.

519
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,157
The fast super cars in the world.

520
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,929
The price is one crore
and eighty lakhs.

521
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,716
From the choice oftransport among
us will tell the difference between us.

522
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,661
Behind good looking girls
hailing from good families.

523
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:29,155
There will be lot of losers
like you, l know that.

524
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,202
The girl which you
showed me, is my girl.

525
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:45,171
Whatever be your intention. Over
here. Stop it, at this very moment.

526
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,019
Don't you ever come in front of
me with that scrape vehicle.

527
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,722
Won't reach ifyou
run along with me.

528
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,305
lf hero lets free, there is a
common habit of going afterthem.

529
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,202
For we villains.

530
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:27,051
Your 430 BHP Malchan's
leather and all, keep it with you!

531
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,749
But her, at the climax
she'll be with me.

532
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,871
His kind of coming and on seeing
his car, l had quit from the game.

533
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,604
On what ground have
you challenged him?

534
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:51,873
Not by seeing anything.

535
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,607
But aftertelling dialogue on us he
mustn't return like a hero, like that.

536
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,016
Anyway one thing
is decided, game over.

537
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,619
For me its not that
one, he ridiculed our vehicle.

538
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,795
lt not that, there is nothing
in what he said.

539
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,398
Hey man, should
have gratitude, gratitude.

540
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,234
You have roamed all over
the world in this in search of her.

541
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,894
You tell, has she ever cheated us?

542
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,831
No, is it?

543
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,782
Good tongue, come
will get down and check.

544
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,766
Check who is it? lf its that
psycho, scold him nicely.

545
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:57,772
Hallo, itching..No, Romanch.
Bala, l had met with an accident.

546
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:02,309
Right now at the hospital,
can you come fast?

547
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:08,322
Thinks, l don't have much time.
Can you please come?

548
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,488
Who is it man?

549
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,361
lts that Choriyan, he had
met with an accident.

550
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:18,963
At the Sakara hospital, on hearing
seems serious, told you to come fast.

551
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,938
May be to say, before dying
l failed and you won, Bala.

552
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,734
But still.
l was justjoking.

553
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,974
Come, get in we'll see
how he is lying.

554
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,423
This is the one.

555
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:53,502
Come.

556
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,000
l want to see my mother.
Lie down without moving.

557
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,369
Get lost you sister.
This fellow is...

558
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,176
This will be over now.

559
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,886
For tying a band like this have
you cried like this, as if dying?

560
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,051
Romancha, don't l know
you right from olden days.

561
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,350
Saying not because
of anything else.

562
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,256
Never has seen a
timid guy like him in life.

563
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,761
Were you hit by some cycle?
No, its a car.

564
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,424
l was brought in that.

565
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,901
Hey man...

566
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,908
...something has happened.

567
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,976
For me something
like a, lack of brains.

568
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,944
When the vehicle had struck on
you, your brains started working man.

569
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,446
By the way, where is that
girl who had hit on you?

570
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,313
lts a girl, may be some
where in that corridor.

571
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:46,047
On your horoscope, at present
it must be dangers due to females.

572
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,213
Anyway l'll meet that girl and come.

573
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,855
Let her know there
are people on your side.

574
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,352
No, over here.

575
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,291
Like that once again
she came into my life.

576
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,223
Same like the first one.

577
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,282
No need to get tensed.
Nothing has happened to him.

578
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,585
Actually, for bringing him
here in this condition.

579
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,659
l don't know how
to say thanks.

580
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:09,596
Not that normally when an accident
occurs no one used to stop.

581
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,214
lf you want you may
go home, l'll be here only.

582
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,414
lf there is anything,
l'll let you know that.

583
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,653
l'll call.

584
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:49,172
l was about to ask, we..
We've met somewhere, is it?

585
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,638
Usually, that is how the
boys start a conversation.

586
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:59,314
l was justjoking, go on what
is that, what you wanted to ask?

587
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,685
That is the same what
is to be asked.

588
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,659
Haven't we met
before somewhere?

589
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:14,035
Last month we had met near the UB
city. You had offered me the taxi.

590
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,234
Now got recollected.

591
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:31,179
lts not that, some kind of a feeling.

592
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,618
Haven't we met
before that, somewhere?

593
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,218
l know Balan.

594
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:44,088
lts a bit old memory.

595
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:50,465
While saying old, summer of 99.

596
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:55,175
Dubai lnternational School.

597
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:01,583
All were for the final preparations
ofthe annual examination.

598
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,552
But in my mind,
there was only this plant.

599
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:10,455
For the science exhibition , this plant
which l cared for 3 months to grow it.

600
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:16,792
There was one person at the
school, who was not bothered of exams.

601
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,768
Aren't you ashamed to study after
coming to school? Hey fellow!

602
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,111
What is this, is this
a veg sandwich?

603
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,652
Doesn't your mummy know to
make chicken sandwich?

604
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:42,558
lfyou don't bring chicken sandwich
tomorrow, don't you know me?

605
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,456
Hold this.

606
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,196
Get lost girl, hey fellow are you
running and playing on the ground?

607
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:50,526
Get lost fellow!

608
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:05,409
Hey girl, where is your lunch box?

609
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:08,108
ln my house lunch is
made for me to eat.

610
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,283
What did you say?

611
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,549
My mother has told that
bullies like you are just losers.

612
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,656
What did you call me?

613
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,331
l'll show you, okay.

614
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,388
Without learning dialogue,
to manage l'll tell you a trick.

615
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,292
What trick?

616
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,523
This big dialogue is
the most toughest, is it?

617
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:33,568
On this stage of drama, l'm in
front, and Balan is behind me, no?

618
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,431
Yes.

619
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:35,468
l'm a tree, no?

620
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:39,371
On pasting this paper behind me
you can see that and read, no?

621
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,338
That is correct, no?

622
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,412
Good.

623
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:54,453
Balan...good luck Balan.
Thank you.

624
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,818
My goodness!

625
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,595
You turn!
Turn l say!

626
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,730
You turn!

627
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,665
Please turn, you turn please!

628
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,009
Eh? Loser!

629
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:05,460
Now do you remember me?
How did you recognize me?

630
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,559
Recently l read about a
restaurant review on Times.

631
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,461
The writers name striked me.

632
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,402
l know only two people
with the name Balan K Nair.

633
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,662
Just for a curiosity.
On the Times web site.

634
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,469
On seeing in your profile Dubai
lnternational School, l was sure.

635
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,369
Had seen the photo also.

636
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,508
Actually, on that night
before we had met.

637
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,850
l had seen Balan at
a mall in random.

638
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:34,753
But at that time
l didn't feel like saying hi.

639
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:02,382
Balan you are a loser!

640
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:07,045
With that call l fell from
Keerikadan Jose to Kalari Achu.

641
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,655
What's up man? What did she say?

642
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:15,864
Mother!

643
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,359
My god!

644
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,102
Allah!
Teeth!

645
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,742
That slap was pending
for years! She...ls a female!

646
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,082
Mother, l'll reach with
in half an hour.

647
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,023
lts from home. l must pick up
mother and take her for shopping.

648
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,322
Never thought we'll
ever meet again.

649
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,898
Thanks Balan for
offering to stay here.

650
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,664
l've your numberyea,
l'll come in the morning.

651
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,096
l've got some otherjob, it was
you who dropped him here, no?

652
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,100
So, you take care of him.

653
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,384
Sheela!

654
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,629
Balan K Nair and Sheela!

655
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,129
This is like saying a
young crocodile loving a stag.

656
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,494
A cheap combination.

657
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,158
Hey fellow! Are you calling me
again after changing the voice?

658
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,490
What? Hey fellow?
Balan this is Sheela.

659
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,836
Didn't you save my number?

660
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:16,712
You can't beat Chandu.
ln life Chandu has been out beaten.

661
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:20,820
Many. When love was
weighed against gold and money.

662
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,150
The loved girl also defeated me.

663
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,187
At last!

664
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:26,658
At last!

665
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,693
Mind blowing performance!

666
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,428
To accept the failure..

667
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,536
Chandu life is again kept aside.

668
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,807
lf that girl has busted you, what
did the poor Mammookka, do?

669
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:43,068
Right from morning will sit with the
laptop, looking and luring her.

670
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:47,515
Come son, we will play golf.

671
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,989
ls it Ummer?.
Knows my name.

672
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,491
Why not? Ummer is famous is it not?

673
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,893
l'm Sheela.
l know.

674
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,106
Hi.
Why are you here?

675
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:17,973
On calling not picking up the phone.
No reply fortext messages.

676
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,244
Then thought will
directly come and meet.

677
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,018
Still now haven't you done
with the anger towards me?

678
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,212
On thinking when we were
young did something...

679
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,581
...are you still keeping all
that in mind even now?

680
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,953
No there is no animosity,
this is a mood of failed lover.

681
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,857
Tomorrow is ex-girl friend's marriage.
Really.

682
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,567
Tomorrow for the wedding
we should also go.

683
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,899
Balan, while not going why
do you want to fail before her?

684
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,270
Myself and Ummerwill
come along for a company.

685
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:50,805
lsn't it Ummer?
Why not.

686
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:54,646
But there is a problem
in that sector he is a celebrity.

687
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,684
Publically on the FB
he has verbally abused her.

688
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:08,121
Even otherwise the Balan
whom l knew was a tough guy.

689
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,797
All this is an experience is it?

690
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,897
Going for ex-girl friend's wedding...

691
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,932
...should be there in all the boys
bucket list. ls it so Ummer?.

692
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:17,897
lf she fires, we'll put a bomb.

693
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:27,007
What did you think?
l'm totally sitting in sadness.

694
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:32,843
Then my plan was to go tomorrow.
lts not because you came and told.

695
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,619
l don't intend to fail like that.

696
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,122
Let herfind that l'm not at all in grief.

697
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:52,897
Are you BKN chettan in Face book?
Can l take one selfie?

698
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,164
When l told Choriyan
is my enemy number two...

699
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,702
...you might have thought
who is my enemy number one?

700
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:26,064
Meet Mr. Rocky K Nair,
the head boy at school.

701
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:29,209
Foot ball team captain,
heart throb, model student.

702
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:33,074

704
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,921
Are you fine, young brother?

705
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,281
Thinking what am
l doing here?

706
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,287
Did you see him Mithun?
He is close friend of mine.

707
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,255
Few years we were
together at Boston.

708
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,394
From you to him,
anyway she is intelligent.

709
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,408
l'm asking since l don't know.

710
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,675
So far never a girl has dumped
me and went to other person.

711
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,725
Leave l say!

712
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,898
How many years it has
been since l bullied you like this?

713
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,796
Will it be 4 to 5 years back?

714
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,993
Not that, no one is
missing you at home.

715
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:32,797
Anyway you'll be the second best
if you want make a visit and go.

716
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:40,707
Must be the friend. Nice
company where everyou go...

717
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,215
...will have loserfriends like
this, who doesn't come up.

718
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,119
She is good.

719
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:58,294
My...
My girl friend.

720
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:05,368
Your girl friend?
Something wrong with her head?

721
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,373
Let me go and talk.

722
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,503
Leave me fellow.

723
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,343
This idiot is saying you
are his girl friend. ls it so?

724
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:25,056
l'm his much better version.
His very own successful brother.

725
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,492
Leave him.
Come with me.

726
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:36,427
Didn't tell me you've
a brother like this.

727
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:41,174
lf l had a brother like
this l wouldn't have told.

728
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:49,875
Don't we've to meet newly weds?
l should meet this ex-girl friend.

729
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,356
Rocky brother, is it not?
Yes.

730
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,449
Balan has told lot about
you, l'm his best friend.

731
01:14:58,594 --> 01:14:59,390
Ummer!

732
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,364
Go man, fatty!

733
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:41,530
Right from childhood
hearing, learn from elder brother.

734
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,597
But still now, l've not seen what
is there for me to learn from him?

735
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:47,842
A very best brother, if she
weren't there, could have seen.

736
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,203
ln front of that ex-girl friend
of yours and that mad brother...

737
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,471
...we would be busted.

738
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,582
Now all those people who thought
you are depressed got shocked.

739
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,875
She is not bad, is it not?
Then what?

740
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,986
Hey man, she is our 'the one'.

741
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,083
But a fool like you,
l've not seen in life.

742
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,427
Thinking that long back you
had a dislike, what a pity!

743
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:10,091
Hey man, why can't you love her?

744
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:14,429
Balan K Nair and Sheela.
You are the only one who ruins me.

745
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:18,128
Not that, after all we've taken lot
of efforts to find her is it not?

746
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,240
Now that girl, is this girl.

747
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,640
Son, what all plays of god.

748
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:27,247
Hey man, its true that
for fun tried to find her.

749
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:30,883
But that won't go well.
But anyway you've got a good friend.

750
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,453
You call her and tell will meet.

751
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,425
Art gallery, didn't find
any other place to meet?

752
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,394
No!

753
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:47,627
You come.
Over here what to do with me?

754
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,468
Hey man, we will walk and
see all the paintings and all.

755
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:52,003
What to walk? l'm not there.

756
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:53,232
Go and see it and come.
Then go!

757
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:54,375
l'll be somewhere over there.

758
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,148
Did the brother go?

759
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:07,515
Who knows.

760
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,528
So where are Balan's
parents and all?

761
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,525
They all are still in Dubai.
Atypical doctorfamily.

762
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,602
Father, mother, elder
brother everyone.

763
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,171
ls Balan not interested in all this?

764
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,540
Elder brother was everyone's
pet, a good son.

765
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,909
l was not talented in anything,
not interested in medicine.

766
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,175
An average student.

767
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,117
Leave all that, when did
you return from Dubai?

768
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:45,458
The life out there, my parents
were not interested in that.

769
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,927
But Bangalore, its in this
city where their nostalgia is.

770
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:55,627
lts over here where they first met.
Fell in love and married.

771
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,631
Where Sheela studied and all?

772
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,737
School and college
was all at Shimla.

773
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,672
So during vacations
used to come here and return.

774
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,380
Because of that, there aren't
many friends over here.

775
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:29,260
The common man, the comic strip
of R.K Lakshman, in Times of lndia.

776
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:32,066
From 1950 onwards for
about half a century.

777
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,639
That person was my childhood
hero total genius.

778
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:39,213
Truly l joined Times
to become a cartoonist.

779
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:46,713
l told parents that l met
Balan, they rememberyou.

780
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:50,082
They really rememberthat old duck.

781
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:53,150
Told to bring you home one day.

782
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,558
Anyway, shall l leave?

783
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,271
Day aftertomorrow what is
the plan? lts New Year's eve, is it?

784
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:11,638
There is no big plan, like that.

785
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:15,107
Just with some friends
a small new year's party.

786
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:18,781
At 12 O'clock, l just want
to scream my lungs out.

787
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:23,785
Why not before the party,
a dinner at my place?

788
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,094
After the dinner l'll
drop you immediately.

789
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,626
l'll come.
l'll see you there.

790
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,573
Any..Do you want any help?

791
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,421
Just 5 minutes, l'll set this now.

792
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,360
Shall l..

793
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,741
This is Ummer's father's house,
purchased from some French lady.

794
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,976
But for the time being we don't
intend to move out from here.

795
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:40,213
And then where is Ummer?
Ummer, is not like me.

796
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,256
Very busy.

797
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,493
Shall we dine?

798
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,875
That bully during
those times, cooked all this?

799
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:07,538
What was it for? A dinner like
this after taking this much effort.

800
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:11,345
Just take it as an
apology, l was bit rude.

801
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,991
You were saying a
break while studying.

802
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:24,387
Didn't l say Balan, l love this city.

803
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:27,692
So, our Bangalore, one gap here.

804
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:33,072
Marriage, boy friend.
What are you taking interview?

805
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:33,864
Yes.

806
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,577
Well, l've not thought
of marriage and all.

807
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,988
He is the son offather's client.

808
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,887
l don't know whether
to call as a boy friend.

809
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:54,886
So far, we've not
spend much time together.

810
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,662
When l was in Shimla,
Rahul was over here.

811
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,098
When l returned, Rahul
went to London.

812
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:04,928
For the last month
vacation, was here.

813
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:08,564
Rahul, nice name.

814
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,604
How is the person?

815
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,386
Rahul's, father is a
big builder over here.

816
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,318
All in all an ideal husband material.

817
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:28,960
Really a journalist!
Again how many questions are left?

818
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,830
l'm not that kind of
a typical girl Balan.

819
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,661
l don't believe in this
romance and love.

820
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:38,466
Has seen lot of love
stories at college and all.

821
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,939
The endings of all that was tragedy.
Why simply?

822
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,974
All the girls within themselves
they are romantics, is it not?

823
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:55,384
Todays love is practical. lfthere is
no boy friend, while choosing a husband.

824
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,082
Should look into hundred things.

825
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,827
Education, family, bank balance,
prospectus, is he bald?

826
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:10,064
See, for our generation our
parents have given lot offreedom.

827
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:13,869
ln my case, l can
choose my life partner.

828
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,009
So while getting a freedom like that.

829
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:18,975
Naturally, we children
will become more responsible.

830
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:23,541
This pulp love and things
were all during my parents time.

831
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:33,821
l've never experienced
this thing, love, so far.

832
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:53,408
Shall l leave?
Before leaving, shall we take a photo?

833
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:20,666
This was lost on that night.
All these days it was with me.

834
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:24,501
Should have returned
earlier, l'm sorry.

835
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,841
Somehow, didn't feel like returning.

836
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:44,963
Balan, doesn't know
the importance ofthis camera.

837
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:55,138
l was thinking to ask?
Why do you need such a camera?

838
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:59,280
Will tell that some other time.

839
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:09,146
ln fact why don't you join me Balan?

840
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:37,807
Where is Ummer?
l've send the text telling to come.

841
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:39,144
Will call and see.

842
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,520
Where are you? We've reached.

843
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,060
Have you reached?
l'm 5 minutes away, will reach now.

844
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,351
lts food poison.

845
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:52,760
lts New Year, no?
While dining out must be careful.

846
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,193
No doctor it was not dining out side,
it was due to eating from inside.

847
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:57,695
Look, this guy was the cook.

848
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,833
You go and buy
medicine from Pharmacy.

849
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,909
The new editor was
a Bombay Malayalee.

850
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:45,910
JP Varma, young and dynamic.

851
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:49,241
Many have thought that
he was the future oftimes.

852
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:52,011
l had decided to
impress him somehow.

853
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,889
To work with sir,
we are all very excited.

854
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,723
This is an idea on which l'm
working. lts a comic strip.

855
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,404
Sir, any time when sir is free.

856
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:26,043
To indulge in your
hobby, l don't have time.

857
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,448
Even ifthere is time,
this five columns each.

858
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:32,216
Do you think anyone will read?

859
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:57,144
This was my parents first
house. Earlier it was on rent.

860
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:59,182
Laterthey purchased this one.

861
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:07,154
At first it was a small house,
later they extended this one.

862
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:14,993
For my father and mother its a sort
of craze, their olden times and romance.

863
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:20,363
To escape from busyness of
outside world, very often come here.

864
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:25,505
l very much love spaces like these.

865
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:29,816
All these photos and all?
Taken by father.

866
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:37,814
Balan, haven't you asked on that
day about back story ofthat camera?

867
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:47,998
My father, purchased this camera
for the first time on saving money.

868
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:54,099
He very much like photography, this
camera was father's prized possession.

869
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:58,503
As a gift to their
25 th wedding anniversary.

870
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:03,010
Through their love
story, a travel of daughter.

871
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:07,310
That was the idea. On their love
story all these were important places.

872
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,216
Today many are just a relics.

873
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:13,856
They first met at this chemistry lab.

874
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:17,428
lt was in this restaurant they
used to hang out after college.

875
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:19,327
lt was in this movie theater.

876
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:21,799
They used to watch
Hindi movies during those times.

877
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:24,904
lt was in this park,
father proposed to mother.

878
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:29,574
All these five photos were my gift.
Five photos?

879
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,072
One photo was left out to take.

880
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:34,272
lt was during that time
the camera was lost.

881
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:39,544
Which is that place?
Not the place, this scooter.

882
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:43,249
The scooter was the fifth photo.
All theirjourney was on this one.

883
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:48,587
When we went to Dubai, father sold
this, till now was the search forthis.

884
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:25,393
What?
Will find it in two days.

885
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,862
Will find in two days.

886
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:39,913
Are you busy? Then get ready fast.
Ummer will come to pick you up.

887
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:43,413
We'll go to a place.
That is all there.

888
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:45,074
When you come take
that camera also.

889
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:30,520
''Close by, like a rain that showers''

890
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:40,131
''ln that rain, gets drenched
like a flower''

891
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:50,006
''When someone is slowly
murmuring the tunes within me''

892
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:58,949
''When joined in the hand of breeze
we are like feathers, on these paths''

893
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:08,400
''As you fill the hearts
l become like a wave''

894
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:19,104
''As you brightens in the eyes
l become a star at night''

895
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:28,176
''The memories flows on the paths
we both flows along with it''

896
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:38,284
''Without knowing a song is
spreading in the inner most heart''

897
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:46,695
''ln that in certain dear most lines
only about your face is highlighted''

898
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:56,334
''As you fill the hearts
l become like a wave''

899
01:36:56,510 --> 01:37:07,250
''As you brightens in the eyes
l become a star at night''

900
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:16,352
''Close by, like a rain that showers''

901
01:37:16,597 --> 01:37:25,869
''ln that rain, gets
drenched like a flower''

902
01:37:26,574 --> 01:37:35,846
''When someone is slowly
murmuring the tunes within me''

''As you brightens in the eyes

906
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:17,351
Let the camera be with me,
after developing these photos.

907
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,320

forthe anniversary.

908
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:24,459
So, shall l go?
Any way came till here, no?

Meet my parents and go, get down.

910
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:37,335
Looks like there is no one at the
house. All the lights are turned off.

911
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:39,303
l'll take a look and come.

912
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:51,484
Amma!

How did you get inside? Why
suddenly? Told will come next month.

915
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:05,466
Didn't you wait for the graduation?

916
01:39:09,677 --> 01:39:11,941
Graduation is only a
formality, is it not?

917
01:39:12,413 --> 01:39:14,779
When there are certain things
which are more important than that.

918
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:18,975
Thought will come bit early.

919
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:23,753
l'm very much here, is it not? Could
have waited for graduation.

920
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:33,400
Would you marry me?

921
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:01,657
Sorry daughter, it was Rahul's idea.

922
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:06,799
Actually engagement should
be conducted next week...

923
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,663
...that's what Rahul's
parents are saying.

924
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:12,339
There is no difference
of opinion is it not?

925
01:41:26,613 --> 01:41:29,707
Whom are you looking?
No one.

926
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:31,847

When l came out and
looked there was no person!

933
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:37,542
Not that, Ummer
called me immediately.

934
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,853
Rahul, came back
and he has proposed me.

935
01:42:49,029 --> 01:42:52,157
Okay, l'll call afterwards,

936
01:43:40,614 --> 01:43:42,172
Yea, have you come again?

937
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:45,584
The last meeting with
sir was really helpful.

938
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:49,287
l took it as a challenge, the
readers will definitely like it.

939
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,922
l'm sure about that, sir
must read this and see.

940
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:55,989
What do you intend?
On drawing this cartoon.

941
01:43:57,297 --> 01:44:01,597
lf you like to draw that much, go to the
street and draw the caricature oftourists.

942
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:05,931
Because ofthis you are not
going to have any future.

943
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:09,540
Sir, without even looking at
this, judging me and my talent.

944
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:13,172
lf at least once after reading
this, and ifyou say like this.

945
01:44:13,313 --> 01:44:15,781
l promise you l'll never
disturb sir again, with this.

946
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:19,183
Hmm..Okay leave that here
and Balan you may leave.

947
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:24,786

01:44:25,058 --> 01:44:26,992
Thank you sir, that is enough.

949

Good going man, he'll like it.

951
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:47,009
What happened to you? Right from
morning noticing, a sort of mood out.

952
01:44:49,316 --> 01:44:50,180
No need of that.

953
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:53,845
Any way to correct your mood there
is an office party, today evening.

954
01:44:54,054 --> 01:44:57,717
Don't you know its a costume party,
must come as a movie character.

955
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:00,586
On the house party,
call Ummer also.

956
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:10,996
Any way we are villains,
then will go as villains.

957
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:28,785
l'm Bat Man's enemy joker.
And Ummer in his own opinion.

958
01:45:29,022 --> 01:45:31,286
All around the world, the
weakness of entire females.

959
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:35,589
Became the 'Prince Draculla'
who is the king of darkness!

960
01:46:19,072 --> 01:46:23,031
Hey son Ummer, what
you told is true.

961
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:33,414

964
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,807

Okay.

965
01:47:30,177 --> 01:47:31,838

01:48:55,495 --> 01:48:58,225
How?
Why at this time, at the house?

972
01:48:58,431 --> 01:48:59,329
Don't worry.

973
01:49:01,101 --> 01:49:04,832
No one has seen, came to say
one thing, will say that and go.

974
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:07,897
Where is that?
Why Balan, like this at the house?

975
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:26,118
Right from the moment when
that camera was obtained.

976
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:29,126
To find you, what all
things l and Ummer did.

977
01:49:31,965 --> 01:49:36,265
At first it was a time pass
and later met you unexpectedly.

01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:39,531
Became close, l can't,
without seeing you.

We have started okay as

Orchids, white orchids.
Nice.

Don't you want chapatti?
One will do.

994
01:51:51,104 --> 01:51:54,699
The time l've spend
with Balan, l've enjoyed it.

995
01:51:58,611 --> 01:52:05,414
l've not thought anything else. The
girl who is going to live with Balan...

996
01:52:11,524 --> 01:52:14,220
No girl who has got
a bit of kindness...

997
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,454
...will never say doesn't
like him, looking at his face.

998
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:21,293
On the contrary will say only
this, likes to hang out with you.

999
01:52:21,434 --> 01:52:24,995
Likes your sense of humor.
Likes the way you care.

1000
01:52:25,138 --> 01:52:27,402
But only you doesn't like!

1001
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:32,169
lfyou marry anyone, she will be
lucky, all sorts ofthings like that.

1002
01:52:32,345 --> 01:52:35,075
Then ifthat is the case, why
can't you be that lucky girl?

1003
01:52:35,215 --> 01:52:38,514
Why is that? Don't you
like luck coming to life?

1004
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:44,022
Balan, l've given word to Rahul.

1005
01:52:44,357 --> 01:52:47,520
Don't belittle me by
calling Balan, Balan!

1006
01:52:48,228 --> 01:52:50,696
What is that l lack?
Don't l've brains?

1007
01:52:51,064 --> 01:52:53,191
Am l not handsome?

1008
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:57,392
Education..
Balan, what is required in life is stability.

1009
01:52:58,404 --> 01:52:59,735
With Rahul, l get that.

1010
01:53:00,073 --> 01:53:05,773
But l believe in you, Balan will get
a girl as you wish in your mind.

1011
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:19,190
All this love is complicated,
it has got an ugly side.

1012
01:53:22,562 --> 01:53:27,795
Jealousy, ego,
possessiveness, fighting.

1013
01:53:29,869 --> 01:53:32,235
Let all that be seen by Rahul.

1014
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:40,242
Enough!
Ours is a finest relationship.

1015
01:53:40,547 --> 01:53:44,643
Friendship, so we'll
continue as good friends.

1016
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:47,353
That is my decision.

1017
01:53:48,254 --> 01:53:50,848
Balan, do you res..
Boring!

1018
01:53:53,726 --> 01:53:54,590
Balan!

1019
01:54:06,673 --> 01:54:08,800
How much space is there?

1020
01:54:16,716 --> 01:54:19,844
Hey wait, wait, wait!

1021
01:54:22,555 --> 01:54:27,219
So, there is no history, Bala
K Nair returning empty handed.

1022
01:54:39,505 --> 01:54:40,369
Come!

1023
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:46,345
What is this?
ls it gate way of lndia?

1024
01:55:32,659 --> 01:55:35,253
So, you are Balan K Nair, no?

1025
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:38,563
lndeed a villain!

1026
01:55:39,499 --> 01:55:40,397
That is..

1027
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,561
Give that tea, let his hang
over get reduced.

1028
01:56:22,909 --> 01:56:26,276
At night, we'll discuss why you
had come byjumping the gate.

1029
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:28,710
Anyway haven't you come
home for the first time?

1030
01:56:28,848 --> 01:56:31,681
After having breakfast,
will do it, is it so?

1031
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:53,700
Looks like Balan is a silent person.

1032
01:56:55,942 --> 01:56:58,570
That is because of
meeting Rahul, forthe first time.

1033
01:56:59,445 --> 01:57:01,777
Working in Times, is it not?

1034
01:57:02,415 --> 01:57:05,441
Actually, Balan's ambition
is to become a cartoonist.

1035
01:57:09,822 --> 01:57:12,086
Who doesn't like
comics and cartoons?

1036
01:57:19,432 --> 01:57:20,922
Hallo, Mother.

1037
01:57:24,637 --> 01:57:25,865
Don't keep anything in mind.

1038
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:29,008
l've not informed Sheela
anything. Honestly speaking.

1039
01:57:29,442 --> 01:57:31,706
When she told she will
introduce her friend.

1040
01:57:32,145 --> 01:57:34,909
l never expected that it will be you.

1041
01:57:36,983 --> 01:57:38,951
l never used to keep any grudges.

1042
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:46,482
On that day itself, l've
told you, haven't l?

1043
01:57:46,692 --> 01:57:51,959
The competition is held between
the equals. The people like you.

1044
01:57:52,498 --> 01:57:55,331
Are not even listed in
the friend's bracket.

1045
01:57:56,536 --> 01:58:00,404
Thinking will get a girl like
Sheela, that is your naivete.

1046
01:58:00,606 --> 01:58:04,702
l've considered only like that.
And on that day challenging me.

1047
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:18,980
Honey moon is planned overthere.
No chance Balan might know.

1048
01:58:19,592 --> 01:58:23,494
The sun set beside the Aaron River
at Florence, is the most romantic.

1049
01:58:27,834 --> 01:58:28,960
ls it not?

1050
01:58:31,671 --> 01:58:33,571
Will go?
Okay.

1051
01:58:36,509 --> 01:58:38,136
Will see you for engagement.

1052
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:51,012
Rahul, one minute.

1053
01:59:00,967 --> 01:59:06,428
Rahul, there are more romantic sun
sets at Florence than Aaron River.

1054
01:59:09,642 --> 01:59:11,576
No chance Rahul
might be knowing it.

1055
01:59:11,777 --> 01:59:14,211
lts a square in the name
of Michel Angelo.

1056
01:59:14,714 --> 01:59:19,742
South ofthe city. One of the most
boutiques of Florence is from there.

1057
01:59:23,256 --> 01:59:26,157
At Florence, everything
else is lagged behind it.

1058
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:27,610
Like that you are also
going to be practical.

1059
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:28,776
ls it not Ummachi?

1060
02:01:28,981 --> 02:01:31,973
After a stage everyone
should be practical.

1061
02:01:32,218 --> 02:01:34,209
How long to live like this?

1062
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:39,550
lt has been very long, father
saying to do MBA on going to U.S.

1063
02:01:39,692 --> 02:01:42,183
Should fulfill one wish of his.

1064
02:01:42,361 --> 02:01:44,625
Yesterday offer letter
has come from U.S.

1065
02:01:44,797 --> 02:01:48,995
lf l don't go for visa interview
tomorrow, within 2 days will come back.

1066
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:52,601
Then till going to U.S,
at the native home.

1067
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:57,568
True, if its California, that is
good for your gaming.

1068
02:01:58,844 --> 02:02:04,282
Gaming? What gaming?
Even l don't know what l want.

1069
02:02:04,650 --> 02:02:08,086
Every time some other madness,
today gaming, tomorrow something else.

1070
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:11,712
l go after that also. But your
case is not like that.

1071
02:02:12,024 --> 02:02:16,222
You know what you want.
ls there life without hurdles?

1072
02:02:16,429 --> 02:02:20,297
God will put hurdles only those
which can be overcome by us.

1073
02:02:20,766 --> 02:02:24,361
Ummer, this is not your video
game to overcome the hurdles.

1074
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:27,002
lts life.

1075
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:29,199
l'm also saying regarding
the matter of life.

1076
02:02:29,375 --> 02:02:32,833
Haven't you asked? Why,
doesn't my father know to smile?

1077
02:02:33,079 --> 02:02:34,239
There is always anger on the face.

1078
02:02:34,313 --> 02:02:38,079
As you think that's not due to
tension on thinking about me.

1079
02:02:38,451 --> 02:02:41,079
Hey man, the name ofthat is love.

1080
02:02:42,355 --> 02:02:46,223
During our age he also had a love.

1081
02:02:46,692 --> 02:02:51,186
When the girl's family members
threatened, father didn't have the guts.

1082
02:02:51,297 --> 02:02:55,233
He was a coward, that girl got
married and she had gone.

1083
02:02:55,434 --> 02:02:57,732
Later father lived in
a sort of sternness.

1084
02:02:57,870 --> 02:03:00,361
Went to Bombay
and made lot of money.

1085
02:03:00,473 --> 02:03:04,409
Came back and started a business
in the native, married my mother.

1086
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:07,873
But that girl did not
depart from his memory.

1087
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:11,245
No matter how much he tried,
father couldn't adjust with mother.

1088
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:12,408
They got separated.

1089
02:03:12,785 --> 02:03:16,186
All these stories when mother
was telling me, l've thought.

1090
02:03:16,355 --> 02:03:18,118
lffather had shown some
guts during that time.

1091
02:03:18,324 --> 02:03:20,792
Today how many people
would have lived happily.

1092
02:03:21,327 --> 02:03:24,023
Today, in the position
of my father, its you.

1093
02:03:24,296 --> 02:03:28,665
Now ifyou don't show guts, like father
throughout life you'll be in grief.

1094
02:03:29,335 --> 02:03:32,463
Like what you said, we
see several girls daily.

1095
02:03:32,805 --> 02:03:36,434
But the correct companion, that
will happen only once in life.

1096
02:03:36,776 --> 02:03:40,143
Sheela's only engagement
is over, wedding is not finished.

1097
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:44,444
Again time is there, all though you
have one chance in thousand!

1098
02:03:44,784 --> 02:03:46,775
You must fight for her.

1099
02:03:48,988 --> 02:03:52,014
This emotion and all, is
not meant for me, man.

1100
02:04:02,168 --> 02:04:05,797
l've seen a Ummer on that day
which l haven't seen till then.

1101
02:04:06,005 --> 02:04:10,442
ln the previous birth he must be a
army chief in some Roman army.

1102
02:04:40,005 --> 02:04:42,371
Afterthe visa interview day after
tomorrow l'll come over to here.

1103
02:04:42,575 --> 02:04:44,338
And then to Kozhikode.

1104
02:04:46,512 --> 02:04:48,810
Go and tune the English
ladies in the embassy.

1105
02:05:19,345 --> 02:05:22,109
Sir, is a person who is
handling responsible post.

1106
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:23,375
l had respected you.

1107
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:26,540
The place where it belongs
is at the waste bin.

1108
02:05:26,886 --> 02:05:28,183
To say that looking at my face.
You have the authority to say that.

1109
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:30,447
But doing like that without even
opening it and seeing, that is bad.

1110
02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:36,886
You must start the
next sentence with a sorry.

1111
02:05:39,431 --> 02:05:43,231
l won't give you the
satisfaction on firing me, l quit!

1112
02:05:45,437 --> 02:05:48,531
No one is going to hire
you and l'll see to it.

1113
02:06:50,502 --> 02:06:57,169
Ho! Finally. So irresponsible.
Balan l called you a hundred times.

1114
02:06:58,143 --> 02:07:00,577
Without calling me all these
days, suddenly to talk like this.

1115
02:07:00,913 --> 02:07:01,902
What mistake did l do?

1116
02:07:02,081 --> 02:07:05,312
Balan, had given me the word,
l expected you to keep it.

1117
02:07:05,517 --> 02:07:07,951
Today is the wedding
anniversary, did you forget it?

1118
02:07:08,087 --> 02:07:11,147
Where are the photos?
l'm sorry, l forgot.

1119
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:12,955
l'll come now.

1120
02:07:21,967 --> 02:07:26,336
Like everybody knows.
lts our 25th wedding anniversary.

1121
02:07:28,273 --> 02:07:30,901
But this time its a special occasion.

1122
02:07:31,043 --> 02:07:35,070
This is not arranged by
us, but by our daughter Sheela.

1123
02:07:35,247 --> 02:07:37,545
The treasure in our life.

1124
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:40,241
Our Molu, Sheela.

1125
02:07:55,134 --> 02:07:57,500
Definitely its an official invite.

1126
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:08,569
l know got late, all the
photos are on this pen drive.

1127
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:31,269
Anyway, to speak few
words to all ofyou.

1128
02:08:32,071 --> 02:08:36,371
The event host, l invite our
darling daughter Sheela.

1129
02:08:50,155 --> 02:08:54,592
So while thinking what gift to give
on their 25th wedding anniversary.

1130
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:57,351
A playfulness which l've felt.

1131
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:02,218
Genius idea Molu.

1132
02:10:03,362 --> 02:10:08,664
l can't accept the entire credit.
Balan is the one who did all this.

1133
02:10:09,868 --> 02:10:14,396
When he was bit late to
turn up, l spoke a bit rudely.

1134
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:17,441
Now on calling, can't get him.
The phone is switched off.

1135
02:10:19,912 --> 02:10:23,313
Poorfellow, he might have felt sad.

1136
02:10:24,383 --> 02:10:27,511
Molu, go and see and
come after telling a sorry.

1137
02:10:28,387 --> 02:10:30,514
Yes daughter, go.

1138
02:10:45,671 --> 02:10:49,368
l had gone to the house.
Saw no one overthere.

1139
02:10:49,942 --> 02:10:52,672
Then figured out, must be here.

1140
02:10:53,545 --> 02:10:57,413
Where is Ummer?
Gone. To where?

1141
02:11:06,925 --> 02:11:12,329
Those photos..No one
has done like that for me.

1142
02:11:18,270 --> 02:11:21,865
Not only father and
mother l was also surprised.

1143
02:11:22,207 --> 02:11:26,337
Not only for yourfather and mother,
for me also this day is special.

1144
02:11:26,912 --> 02:11:28,504
Today is my birth day.

1145
02:11:34,586 --> 02:11:38,352
On this day l realize l'm
alone on this earth.

1146
02:11:38,557 --> 02:11:42,391
Own family members haven't called,
usually Ummer will be there at least.

1147
02:11:44,563 --> 02:11:47,657
l'm there, no?
How long?

1148
02:11:50,002 --> 02:11:52,698
Once yourwedding is over, you
will be also busy, won't you?

1149
02:11:52,871 --> 02:11:57,171
Few days we all spends some time
together, then will part to theirways.

1150
02:12:11,356 --> 02:12:14,621
Will go home, come l'll drop you.

1151
02:12:20,666 --> 02:12:23,191
That fellow is there, no?
That Rahul.

1152
02:12:23,869 --> 02:12:26,633
Has he evertried to
understand you?

1153
02:12:27,005 --> 02:12:31,533
Your likes, passions
has he ever tried to know?

1154
02:12:33,378 --> 02:12:37,838
Like everyone, you also
thought of a secured future.

1155
02:12:39,751 --> 02:12:42,447
What girls want is stability.

1156
02:12:46,625 --> 02:12:49,890
How easy it is for me
to become like Rahul.

1157
02:12:50,395 --> 02:12:53,660
At any time.
Even now!

1158
02:12:54,066 --> 02:12:57,433
Along with father
justjoin family business.

1159
02:12:57,602 --> 02:13:00,036
But l was firm on my convictions.

1160
02:13:02,074 --> 02:13:05,475
Then l became a
loser in front ofyou.

1161
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:24,861
Didn't you say on that day, there is
no pulp love like your parents, now?

1162
02:13:25,063 --> 02:13:27,588
Sheela, love is pulp at
that time and now.

1163
02:13:27,733 --> 02:13:29,633
Since there is a romantic within you.

1164
02:13:29,735 --> 02:13:32,363
That is the reason why you
gave a gift like that to parents.

1165
02:13:33,405 --> 02:13:36,602
You askto them,
in a breeze like this.

1166
02:13:36,942 --> 02:13:40,275
That pleasure while going
in that old scooter sitting close.

1167
02:13:40,412 --> 02:13:42,744
Can it be gained while sitting
in Rahul's sports car?.

1168
02:13:44,349 --> 02:13:48,752
Rahul, his very name is a cliche!

1169
02:13:50,088 --> 02:13:53,387
ln all the Hindi movies, same
is Shah Rukh Khan's name .

1170
02:13:53,558 --> 02:13:56,049
ln the climax the heroine
will go along with Rahul also.

1171
02:13:56,361 --> 02:14:00,092
As of now, no heroine has
gone with Balan K Nair.

1172
02:14:00,599 --> 02:14:02,931
Tomorrow morning
exactly at 10 O'clock.

1173
02:14:03,101 --> 02:14:06,730
l'll be there in front ofyour
house with that old scooter.

1174
02:14:06,938 --> 02:14:12,774
lf you have the guts. To be original.
Come along with villain.

1175
02:14:13,779 --> 02:14:16,577
Should come along
with this Balan K Nair.

1176
02:15:21,213 --> 02:15:29,985
''Like the color of heart, like the
petal of love fill like a rose flower''

1177
02:15:30,222 --> 02:15:39,722
''Come like a tender love, the breeze
of love, give an embrace to this night''

1178
02:15:40,632 --> 02:15:49,939
''The sky will showerthe cluster of
stars, you come along like a cloud''

1179
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:52,201
''Swimming river of memories...''

1180
02:15:52,544 --> 02:15:58,972
''...renders chill in heart,
today sang the silence''

1181
02:15:59,117 --> 02:16:07,684
''Like the color of heart, like the
petal of love fill like a rose flower''

1182
02:16:08,059 --> 02:16:18,526
''Come like a tender love, the breeze
of love give an embrace to this night''

1183
02:16:47,265 --> 02:16:56,230
''The setting sun like a bunch of
flowers, you come in my lonely paths''

1184
02:16:56,508 --> 02:16:58,874
''Comes wafting in the wind...''

1185
02:16:59,077 --> 02:17:04,777
''...you come like a fragrance
settling in the cage of my heart''

1186
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:14,154
''With out saying there are certain
things in the corner of the heart''

1187
02:17:14,759 --> 02:17:24,725
''There are certain things which
withers away, without saying beloved''

1188
02:17:52,831 --> 02:18:02,172
''Long back you had nested
in my heart without saying''

1189
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:10,941
''Perhaps unknowingly had taken it,
when you brought the honey of love''

1190
02:18:11,383 --> 02:18:16,548
''Unknowingly, by my side
won't you come as a wave?''

1191
02:18:16,721 --> 02:18:20,782
''l'll dissolve like a form in it''

1192
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:26,020
''Like an ember, like a tale you come
to deliver the heart filled with love''

1193
02:18:26,197 --> 02:18:30,293
''We both shall continue like that''

1194
02:18:30,368 --> 02:18:39,003
''Like the color of heart, like the
petal of love fill like a rose flower''

1195
02:18:39,311 --> 02:18:48,879
''Come like a tender love, the breeze
of love give a embrace to this night''

1196
02:18:49,321 --> 02:18:58,696
''The sky will showerthe cluster of
stars, you come along like a cloud''

1197
02:18:58,897 --> 02:19:01,365
''By swimming river of memories...''

1198
02:19:01,666 --> 02:19:08,629
''...renders chill in heart
today sang the silence''

1199
02:19:46,311 --> 02:19:49,439
Hey, how was the visa interview?

1200
02:19:50,682 --> 02:19:54,140
Where are you going? Hey man,
you don't have to shift the house.

1201
02:19:54,285 --> 02:19:56,378
As long as you are here,
not going to sell this house.

1202
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:01,921
Ummachi, l'm going man.
To where?

1203
02:20:02,293 --> 02:20:04,420
There is no fixed destination.

1204
02:20:04,996 --> 02:20:07,658
Will board on any ofthe
trains going to North.

1205
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:11,968
Just goes like that.
l know its an eloping.

1206
02:20:13,138 --> 02:20:16,665
But feels like a journey is inevitable.
What about yourjob?

1207
02:20:20,245 --> 02:20:24,272
Without mobile and internet,
must live freely for some time.

1208
02:20:25,417 --> 02:20:28,386
From this city, l've
obtained only you.

1209
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:33,381
ln the mist ofyour hectic schedule
at California, l'll call one day.

1210
02:20:34,759 --> 02:20:36,784
Till then, good luck.

1211
02:20:39,864 --> 02:20:42,958
My Ummachi, will have all the
success and happiness.

1212
02:20:45,503 --> 02:20:49,166
And infinite amount of
dollars and lot of super models.

1213
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:04,184
l'll drop.
No, l'll go.

1214
02:21:09,894 --> 02:21:14,228
You must do a help for me.
Must hand over the scooter to her.

1215
02:21:29,848 --> 02:21:35,081
Sheela, without thinking you haven't
taken any decision so far, impulsively.

1216
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:37,518
This one, should not be
a first decision ofyours.

1217
02:21:37,789 --> 02:21:39,416
Like that, that's what
we have to say.

1218
02:21:40,592 --> 02:21:41,820
Daughter then where is he?

1219
02:21:41,993 --> 02:21:45,190
Hasn't he told that he'll come and
meet you today morning at 10 O'clock?

1220
02:21:51,035 --> 02:21:53,560
Phone is switched off.

1221
02:22:10,221 --> 02:22:12,052
Balan, told to hand
over the vehicle, over here.

1222
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:13,817
Where is Balan?
He has gone.

1223
02:22:13,992 --> 02:22:14,856
To where?

1224
02:22:15,426 --> 02:22:16,552
Somewhere to North.

1225
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:19,227
Will go in a train that heads a
long way, that's what he told.

1226
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:21,796
Let him go anywhere what
does it matterto Sheela?

1227
02:22:21,933 --> 02:22:24,231
Sheela, only has to take care
of Rahul's matters, is it not?

1228
02:22:38,249 --> 02:22:40,410
l've decided to be original.

1229
02:22:51,095 --> 02:22:53,154
Morning at 10 O'clock will
be here, with the scooter.

1230
02:22:53,298 --> 02:22:55,425
Yesterday he has told
to come with him.

1231
02:22:55,567 --> 02:22:58,559
Where is he?
Was he drunk, when he told this?

1232
02:22:59,070 --> 02:22:59,627
Yea.

1233
02:22:59,971 --> 02:23:02,132
Then he doesn't remember
what he told yesterday.

1234
02:23:02,307 --> 02:23:03,968
He has left.
What?

1235
02:23:05,276 --> 02:23:07,073
Ummer, take the vehicle.

1236
02:23:07,278 --> 02:23:09,542
Daughter where are you going?

1237
02:23:11,115 --> 02:23:13,106
This is that, old scooter
of mine, is it not?

1238
02:23:13,318 --> 02:23:15,309
Yea, that's true.
Father, will look at the vehicle later.

1239
02:23:16,321 --> 02:23:18,619
Hey Molu.
Sheela.

1240
02:23:27,098 --> 02:23:30,590
ln most ofthe love stories the
climax will be at the railway station.

1241
02:23:31,135 --> 02:23:33,126
Before that, no matter
how much time is there.

1242
02:23:33,338 --> 02:23:36,637
When hero boards the train to leave,
at that time only heroine will enter.

1243
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:41,467
Unfortunately, the climax of my love
story was not this much cinematic.

1244
02:25:08,599 --> 02:25:10,260
Are you a mallu?

1245
02:25:11,102 --> 02:25:12,364
A Malayalee?

1246
02:25:14,105 --> 02:25:18,269
Till Goa got a company. Otherwise by
sitting with old men, must get busted.

1247
02:25:19,444 --> 02:25:21,036
Buddy, where to?

1248
02:25:23,314 --> 02:25:26,181
l'm going to Goa,
Dude there is party.

1249
02:25:26,284 --> 02:25:29,344
Full moon party, can
chill out with good chicks.

1250
02:25:29,487 --> 02:25:32,650
Simply come buddy.
What is this buddy?

1251
02:25:33,424 --> 02:25:34,584
As ifwithout...

1252
02:25:38,196 --> 02:25:42,599
Hallo buddy, l've boarded,
when will you come?

1253
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:47,697
No, no need ofthis number.
Roaming is on the other number.

1254
02:25:48,573 --> 02:25:49,437
l'll say...

1255
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:53,406
890 8911 111.

1256
02:25:54,278 --> 02:25:55,302
Yea, fancy.

1257
02:25:58,216 --> 02:25:59,114
Okay buddy.

1258
02:26:01,419 --> 02:26:06,356
Now he is calling from this
number. Note this. 890 8911 111 .

1259
02:26:13,731 --> 02:26:16,791
While seeing getting up and going
l thought you withdrew from it.

1260
02:26:17,168 --> 02:26:23,129
The name is Mr. Nair. Phone
number, 8089 2122 00

1261
02:26:26,310 --> 02:26:28,175
Girl, don't you want your thing?

1262
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:30,711
Stop there fellow!

1263
02:27:45,756 --> 02:27:47,724
He is not in here, he has left.

1264
02:27:50,161 --> 02:27:52,755
Hey psycho, stop there!

1265
02:27:54,398 --> 02:27:55,160
Look!

1266
02:27:57,935 --> 02:28:00,369
Bala!
Stop, fellow!

1267
02:28:00,905 --> 02:28:03,271
Balan!
You'll call, no?

1268
02:28:04,909 --> 02:28:07,878
Hey man, Bala!
Bala!

1269
02:28:10,648 --> 02:28:12,275
l'll kill you, fellow!

1270
02:28:12,483 --> 02:28:14,280
Stop there, fellow!
Balan!

1271
02:28:14,585 --> 02:28:15,574
Hey you fellow!

1272
02:28:25,897 --> 02:28:27,296
l won't use mobile again.
Call, fellow!

1273
02:28:27,465 --> 02:28:28,363
Honestly!

1274
02:28:28,566 --> 02:28:30,796
True, upon Mohammed Ali.
Who is he?

1275
02:28:31,302 --> 02:28:32,963
He is that psycho.
ls he that psycho?

1276
02:28:33,371 --> 02:28:34,838
Chetta, must go for the party.

1277
02:28:35,006 --> 02:28:36,598
You'll call for girl's things, no?

1278
02:28:55,793 --> 02:28:58,728
Let me say.

1279
02:29:00,298 --> 02:29:04,792
l know all this love is complicated
and it has got an ugly side.

1280
02:29:04,936 --> 02:29:08,303
l've told, today's love
is practical, that all.

1281
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:13,008
l've also told, l don't trust in pulp
love during the time of my parents.

1282
02:29:14,412 --> 02:29:20,476
But till now l've not
experienced the thing called love.

1283
02:29:33,431 --> 02:29:36,889
l, need to go with villain.

1284
02:29:57,888 --> 02:30:01,847
Didn't l say?
During climax she will be with me.

1285
02:30:06,931 --> 02:30:07,761
Hold.
Fellow, start this.

1286
02:30:07,898 --> 02:30:08,728
Kick, man.

1287
02:30:11,969 --> 02:30:13,436
Kick, kick.

1288
02:30:16,607 --> 02:30:17,801
Hey fellow!

1289
02:30:18,109 --> 02:30:19,633
Hey fellow!
Fatty!

1290
02:30:51,776 --> 02:30:55,610
Balan's friend Ummer
is with us at the studio.

1291
02:30:55,913 --> 02:30:58,381
What was those stories
behind that incident?

1292
02:30:58,516 --> 02:31:01,451
l never expected such
a recognition for him.

1293
02:31:01,752 --> 02:31:05,711
Just for fun only l've send his
sketches to Obama, through twitter.

1294
02:31:06,090 --> 02:31:09,719
Last week, very unexpected
Obama tweeted me back.

1295
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:12,658
Balan's sketches are
viral on internet, now.

1296
02:31:12,963 --> 02:31:15,932
At present lot of publishers are
calling from London and New York.

1297
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:18,500
Demanding Balan's comic strip.

1298
02:31:34,185 --> 02:31:35,982
Where is Balan, now?

1299
02:31:36,821 --> 02:31:37,981
Balan...
