Indivisible, Equal to All

9
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:52,522
Soul of a moment and eternity

10
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,237
Lost in his own trance

11
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:55,857

There is nothing but you.

55
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:04,087
Blow the Ash

56
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,442
Make the fire an eternal pyre

If you hadn't got us there on time...

70
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,031
the enemy would have
taken over our post.

71
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,271
Our success is indebted
to your skill...

72
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,880
I'm going to recommend your
name for the Army Men Honorary Rank...

73
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,567
Shivaay is far from
all ranks Colonel...

74
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:12,409
two kinds of people
come to these mountains...

75
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,057
the kind who are
searching for themselves...

76
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:19,744
and those who are seeking Him...

77
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,739
I am happy showing them the way...

78
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:26,417
I will be here whenever I am needed.

79
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:31,573
We won't be needing
your help from now.

80
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:41,212
People living down here
always need help from up there.

81
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,971
Call out Loud
Har Har Har

82
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,324
Hey Kancha... this is for you...

83
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:15,468
Don't give me what I want,
when are you taking me on a trek.

84
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:16,583
lamaa...

85
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,532
First grow up...You're still a kid.

86
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:23,867
I've been asking for
this since I was eight,

87
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,003
and for eight years
I've been called a kid.

88
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,375
How much is eight plus eight?

89
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,292
yengchen...

90
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:31,481
How much has your son grown?

91
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:35,206
His behaviour is of an eight year
old... but he is sixteen years old...

92
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,165
It's his birthday today.

93
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,199
Then you must get a birthday gift...

94
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,976
have you been...on this trek before...?

95
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:04,624
Alright...

96
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,007
How many times?

97
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:14,600
I heard... last year four Japanese
tourists died... with the avalanche

98
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,491
Where had it happened...?

99
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,948
On the same route...
where we are headed now.

100
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,751
On the same route!?

101
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,708
Why, are you scared...?

102
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:28,128
yes...no... just...

103
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:32,698
These are mountains of
snow... can fall apart anytime.

104
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:33,889
Then...?

105
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,770
Tell you?

106
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,837
Budham Sharnam Gachchhami...
...Sangam sharnam gachchhami...!

107
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:46,178
He's a wimp.

108
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:47,522
Very big one.

109
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,633
He's a wimp, and you are shrewd.

110
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,479
Why?

111
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:53,665
all the crowds behind
you and a bomb next to you?

112
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:56,930
She came and sat herself...Didn't
hold her hand and make her...

113
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,035
she is quite pretty though...!!

114
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:03,382
Excuse me... What are you
two talking about? May I know?

115
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,110
Just simply... praising the beauty.

116
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,609
Of what?
- Of the weather...!

117
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,560
Beautiful weather madam... fresh
air, no pollution, pure oxygen.

118
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,055
Oxygen...is less up there...

119
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:18,513
Is less here,
there isn't any up there.

120
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,512
Oh...

121
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:26,620
Shivaay... her eyes are so pretty man.

122
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:30,460
With the colour of the sky in her eyes...
a fairy from distant lands is seen.

123
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:33,245
As melts the snow...

124
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:38,525
the heart of a saint melts too...
bit by bit.

125
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:43,864
Or is it that the blinded in the
spring can only see green everywhere.

126
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:51,122
Haven't had this kind
of flattery before...

127
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:56,076
I've been here for five years.
I've studied in DU.

128
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,997
That means you are rich...

129
00:10:58,301 --> 00:10:59,994
Father's money or your own...?

130
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:04,717
Scholarship... and I
am not rich...but want to be...

131
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,215
- I have my own business.
- Olga...

132
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,559
Do you mind...

133
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,862
Where will you setup business?

134
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:12,475
Your Bulgaria is not in good shape.

135
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:14,933
That's exactly why
I am needed there the most.

136
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,050
That means madam is heading back.

137
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:19,812
I would've gone already...
these guys stopped me...

138
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:20,847
Pippa...

139
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,072
By the way...what
do you want to be...?

140
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,683
Never asked for any
more than I need...

141
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:28,834
He's never given
me lesser than I need...

142
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:30,024
Meaning...?

143
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,632
That means...those one with Shiva... don't
need to become anything else madam

144
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:38,934
...but hearing a local language
from a foreigner's mouth...

145
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:41,853
sounds like,
a pebble rattling in a glass.

146
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:45,271
Excuse me! My Hindi is very good.

147
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:48,036
Not sure how good...but
it's sweet for sure.

148
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,302
Oh...he is so hot...and sexy.

149
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,453
- Definitely.
- Oh rubbish...

150
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,593
cheers.
- Cheers...

151
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:03,590
everyone is done.
Can you please sign this.

152
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:04,973
What is this?

153
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:05,933
That man...

154
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,815
you mean Shivaay...
- yes...

155
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,082
Before hitting the mountains...

156
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,428
he gets everybody to sign
this paper... please sign now.

157
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:12,850
Nice... What does it say?

158
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,729
It says that during the
trek if someone breaks an arm...

159
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,948
or breaks a leg... or dies...
or gets eaten up by a wild animal...

160
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,848
This man is not responsible for any
of it...You are. You will have to.

161
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,023
No way I'm signing that...
I am not going to do it.

162
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,025
Hey! Kancha!

163
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,283
What rubbish

164
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:18,558
You have a strange name...
Shiva with the 'Y'. Why?

165
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:20,747
Why not?

166
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,781
Just the name is Shivaay...

167
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,657
What else of Shiva do you have...?

168
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:32,000
Everything.

169
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:37,415
Alright... The long hair... like Shiva...

170
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:38,797
where is it?

171
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:02,723
And his three-speared weapon?

172
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,276
And Trishul his weapon?

173
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:04,056
Call out loud...

174
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,125
You all are at a height of 16,300
feet, The summit we have to reach...

175
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:13,273
is at a height of 20,000 feet.

176
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:16,307
We will complete this
trek in four phases.

177
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:35,813
Never thought about it...Didn't
want it at all...it just happened...

178
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,235
That was my version.

179
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:41,797
Oh really...and what
is my version then...?

180
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:46,071
You thought about it...
wanted it ... and you got it.

181
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:50,948
Well...are you complaining...!

182
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:54,942
No complaints...! But I am thinking,
now what...?

183
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,435
Now, nothing... just
the last four days to go...

184
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:03,947
four days of moonlit nights
then for me there will be more...

185
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,234
And then the moonless dark nights,
for me and...

186
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:09,958
Me?...

187
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:15,681
you know what... you no I think very,
very differently...

188
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,369
Move!

189
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,666
wow!

190
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:39,668
(In Bulgarian)... Beautiful...

191
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,620
(In Bulgarian)... Awesome...

192
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:50,574
It's so beautiful!

193
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,263
Do you have mountains
like these in your country...

194
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,911
Well, there are many mountains....
But none like these... No!

195
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,521
Will there be colours
like these when the sun sets?

196
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:03,783
There will be sunsets everyday there...
But yes...

197
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:06,394
...there won't be colours like these.

198
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,812
Will you find someone ...

199
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:11,041
Like Shivaay...!

200
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:23,594
Even if I find someone he
won't be like Shivaay... I know that.

201
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,441
And yet...

202
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,434
Look Shivaay,
I have plans for my life.

203
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,920
Who are we to make plans.

204
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:40,264
Yungchan...!!

205
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,223
Yes, Shivaay!

206
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:00,000
Shivaay!

207
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,413
Plans are made by the one,
hidden deep in the mountains.

208
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,256
Come on...Come on
- Go....go.

209
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,476
Wait! There is someone! Look there...

210
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:11,386
Om Namh shivaay....om
namah shivaay......shivaaay......

211
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:12,653
Shivaay quick.......

212
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:14,688
Om Namh shivaay....om
namah shivaay......shivaaay...

213
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,356
Hurry up!

214
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:19,872
Leave me! God save

215
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:22,598
No way!

216
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:24,979
Just go!

217
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,048
God help me!

218
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:33,811
Go, go, go! Just Move!

219
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,536
Go, go, go! Just Move!

220
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,870
Please save me.

221
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:47,788
Save me! God Save me!

222
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,290
Your leg has broken...

223
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:23,980
I've given you a pain killer.

224
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,903
I'm very scared... Oh God!

225
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:29,548
I'm scared! I cannot die.... Oh my god!

226
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,853
Scared of dying...?

227
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,581
I am not scared of dying...

228
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:36,537
I'm scared for those who
won't be able to live if I die.

229
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:40,031
My mother has a heart condition,
my sister is just twelve...

230
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:43,571
I can't afford to die....
I can't afford

231
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:46,444
to die... I cannot die! I cannot die

232
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:53,970
I cannot die! I cannot die!...
- Olga...Olga...Olga...

233
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:57,580
You know what...

234
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,805
You and I think very very differently...

235
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,757
Nothing will happen
to you... I wont let you die.

236
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:45,813
Love me ever so passionately

237
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:53,839
So I may never forget

238
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:02,517
Life has brought us to this juncture

239
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:09,352
Am sure there must be a plan

240
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:14,805
I beseech you

241
00:23:15,112 --> 00:23:19,259
Just for this one night

242
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:27,016
Forget the world in my arms

243
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:31,547
These Moments Between us

244
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:35,810
Are truly special

245
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:44,676
Forget the world in my Arms

246
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:04,456
I beseech you

247
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:08,910
Just for this one night

248
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:16,667
Forget the world in my arms

249
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:20,929
These Moments Between us

250
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:25,460
Are truly special

251
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:33,793
Forget the world in my Arms

252
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:55,105
Come walk with me, the path

253
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:59,214
Hand in Hand

254
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:03,361
No matter what little
time we may have

255
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:07,465
Spend each moment with me

256
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:11,382
No matter what little time we may have

257
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,068
Spend each moment with me

258
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,446
It is my only wish

259
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:25,134
My life's dream

260
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:32,698
Forget the world in my arms

261
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:36,999
These Moments Between us

262
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:42,155
Are truly special

263
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:48,315
Forget the world in my Arms

264
00:25:57,274 --> 00:26:01,498
If, someone were to
follow these mountains...

265
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:03,656
...they will go from here to Pakistan,

266
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:08,730
Afghanistan... Kyrgyzstan,
Kazakistan and then through Russia...

267
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,821
will reach that small
village in Bulgaria...

268
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:18,199
where a girl named Olga has her home.

269
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,381
Come with me... to Bulgaria...?

270
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:32,941
Apart from the Himalayas,
Shivaay cant survive anywhere ...

271
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,745
So this is the moment of truth!

272
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:41,429
You can't come to Bulgaria, and I...

273
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,311
...can't stay here.

274
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,948
Why is time together
counted in days and weeks...

275
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:56,328
Why not in breaths...

276
00:26:57,173 --> 00:26:59,016
If we count the breaths,
it will feel like...

277
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:04,776
what a long life...
this short relationship has.

278
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:14,799
Lets decorate these
moments on our bodies

279
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:18,370
Not even rains may wash them away

280
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,325
Forget the world in my arms

281
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,235
Lets etch each Moment

282
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:34,807
Not even eternity may erase them

283
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:39,722
Forget the world in my arms

284
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:47,632
I am most aware of you

285
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:51,626
How can I love you, I am a traveler

286
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,734
What is this moist Happiness?

287
00:27:55,907 --> 00:28:01,341
Are you as aware of it as I am

288
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:06,691
These emotions

289
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:11,670
Are the purest

290
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,928
Forget the world in my arms

291
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:23,114
These Moments Between us

292
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:28,297
Are truly special

293
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:34,864
Forget the world in my arms

294
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,545
Forget the world in my Arms

295
00:28:41,622 --> 00:28:44,579
Forget Forget Forget

296
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:49,864
Forget the world in my Arms

297
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,027
Forget Forget Forget

298
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:12,112
I beseech you

299
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,836
Just for this one night

300
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:23,241
Forget the world

301
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,495
in my arms

302
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:36,035
kancha... What?

303
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,569
Sister is inside.

304
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,988
This your first... you
must be very careful...

305
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,212
Shivaay.... Congratulations!

306
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:47,940
You're going to be a father now!

307
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:52,011
The first three months,
you'll have to be very careful.

308
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:56,235
And anxiety is not good for you,
and not for the baby either.

309
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,806
I'm prescribing some vitamins,
make sure you take them.

310
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:38,706
Go inside...

311
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,530
go inside...

312
00:30:58,287 --> 00:30:59,439
GO INSIDE! ...

313
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,519
I am not asking you
to spend your life here...

314
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,090
I am only asking you for nine months!

315
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,506
To be a mother is not
just a nine month thing...

316
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:55,885
And I don't want to
be a mother right now.

317
00:31:57,037 --> 00:31:59,610
That means you don't
want me to be a father either!

318
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:04,448
Oh please! You are forcing
a life on me I don't want...

319
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,494
Shivaay... We met,

320
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,558
we fell in love.

321
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:14,931
But this baby... is an accident.

322
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,735
Not for me.

323
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:21,767
These few days that
we have spent together...

324
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,531
are the reason for me
to live the rest of my life.

325
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:32,098
Please give me this child... and you go.

326
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,437
I won't stop you.

327
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:41,390
Don't make me ... Don't
make me hate you... Please.

328
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,989
Someone who has no one, seeks out...

329
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:58,747
..only one thing all
his life... Family!!...

330
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:07,195
A complete family is
something I can't get...

331
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:12,417
but this half family that
has come my way unexpectedly...

332
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:14,765
...please don't take it away from me.

333
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,864
Enough of this emotional
blackmail Shivaay! For god's sake.

334
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,318
And what family...?...hmm...

335
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:29,928
I know you can't raise a kid...

336
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,142
I have raised myself...

337
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:54,427
The life that you want...
in order to get it...

338
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:58,113
there is no need to
take the life of this baby...

339
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,300
I already have several lives...

340
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:03,297
that I must take care of...

341
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:10,823
Not one more... Please!

342
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:21,268
I know its not easy for you...
But how difficult will it be for me...

343
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:27,182
if I don't have you and lose this too.

344
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,051
I am not forcing you.

345
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,543
I only want that...

346
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:47,802
No matter how short the
life of our relationship is...

347
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:53,255
...this baby's should be longer.

348
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:59,514
The evil eye that has
affected our relationship...

349
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,932
...should not touch our baby...

350
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,931
Gaura... Gaura listen!

351
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:51,254
Easy, easy!

352
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:56,332
Gaura... Gaura ... Be careful,

353
00:35:57,149 --> 00:35:58,128
Easy Gaura! ...

354
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:04,158
Come on, stop.
Listen. Hey, Gaura listen!

355
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:05,963
Please stop!

356
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:08,731
hu...hu...

357
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:18,678
Hey, You cant beat me. Cheater! Stop!

358
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:34,151
Don't go down and
say that Shivaay lost.

359
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:37,724
Ok, Ok!

360
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:39,491
Say that you won.

361
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:58,808
Not on that mountain...

362
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,189
That's where the storm had hit.

363
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,928
Nights by your Pillow

364
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,807
Excuses of Nightmares

365
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:30,260
Spent awake

366
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:35,445
Silent Conversations

367
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:38,747
Knit in Memories

368
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:44,239
Shared between us

369
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:48,732
Look at this world

370
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:52,262
Of Frozen Frames from our life

371
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:57,603
Its only You and only Me here

372
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:17,805
Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya

373
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,412
Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey

374
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,958
Lost Sleep

375
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:48,067
Fingers of your thoughts

376
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:53,521
Tickling me Softly

377
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,628
I read your silences

378
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,123
Bejeweled in me

379
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:07,423
Your silent explanations

380
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:12,300
Look at this world

381
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:15,833
Of Frozen Frames from our life

382
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,941
It's only You and only Me here

383
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:28,468
Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya

384
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,419
Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey ya Hey

385
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:40,989
Jigsaws of Darkness

386
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:44,522
Vanish in your sunlight

387
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,478
All colours emanate from you

388
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:51,742
Your being is my being

389
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,947
Look at this world

390
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:12,365
Of Frozen Frames from our life

391
00:40:12,902 --> 00:40:17,818
It's only You and only Me here

392
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,828
Har har Great God...

393
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,438
You are still young...

394
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:41,357
...I'll explain when you're older.

395
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:53,262
Give me a hand, come on. Pick this up.

396
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:15,728
Yes...I lied to you...

397
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:22,487
She is in Bulgaria,
alive, but not for us...

398
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:26,404
she didn't even want
to see your face...

399
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:31,968
She does not love you.

400
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:36,384
Gaura....... Gaura...

401
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,264
Gaura...

402
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,761
Gaura... Listen! Stop!

403
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,334
Gaura ...Stop!

404
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:47,484
Gaura... Listen!

405
00:44:48,905 --> 00:44:50,825
Gaura ...Please

406
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:51,978
Please...Gaura...

407
00:44:53,706 --> 00:44:54,560
Gaura...

408
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,314
No...Gaura...

409
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:09,413
Gaura... Gaura.... Gaura...

410
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,497
That's it, Gaura my child.
All done. See...It won't hurt.

411
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:28,763
Done, done. Brave girl!

412
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,057
Shivaay Gaura is not fine...

413
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:39,438
She got seven stiches...!

414
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,045
To say that there
was no love between us...

415
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:39,155
will be wrong. And also a lie.

416
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:42,653
But this is what was
to become of this love...

417
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:47,223
Whatever you asked of me...
I have given...

418
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:50,641
Now what I want from my life...

419
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:53,216
have the right to seek out. I

420
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:59,552
so wished to see our daughter once...

421
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:01,473
But didn't...

422
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,503
If I did, I won't be able to leave.

423
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,227
And if I don't leave, I will live
the rest of my life in bitterness.

424
00:47:12,149 --> 00:47:14,223
This won't be good
for the three of us.

425
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,989
I am going back to Bulgaria.

426
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:19,525
I will never come back.

427
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:23,635
I have many names in
mind for our daughter...

428
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:26,513
...but I am not going to name her.

429
00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:29,928
I don't want... another name

430
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:33,308
apart from yours to miss,
all my life.

431
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:37,071
You give her a nice name.

432
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:41,065
And one more thing...

433
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:44,637
Tell her that her mother died.

434
00:47:45,673 --> 00:47:48,285
If she finds out that
I'm alive and I deserted her...

435
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:52,317
...she will never
be able to forgive me...

436
00:47:54,814 --> 00:48:00,033
I am leaving a lovely doll...
for my lovely doll...

437
00:48:01,688 --> 00:48:06,027
Instead of me she will watch
over my daughter as she grows older.

438
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,532
Gaura...!!!...Gau...!

439
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:49,271
What...?

440
00:48:57,336 --> 00:48:58,527
Don't want to live with your father?

441
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,621
Hey babub....
Tell your friend to promise,

442
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:08,538
...that she'll come back with me...
and not stay back with her mother.

443
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,660
(Men talking in Bulgarian)...
There it is!...

444
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:01,535
(Men talking in Bulgarian)...Hotel...
Mister...

445
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,579
(Men talking in Bulgarian)...
Thank you...Here you go...

446
00:51:48,656 --> 00:51:51,459
(Men talking in Bulgarian)...Go in...
Come on let's go...

447
00:53:03,962 --> 00:53:05,421
(In Russian)...Yes Mister?

448
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:06,996
The boy...

449
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:08,801
Get out...

450
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,094
Thank you so much...
I'm sergeant Nikolai

451
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,284
Thank you.

452
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,729
Maa...aa...aa...aa...

453
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:36,791
Hey, tell me...

454
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:39,901
what will you ask your mother...?

455
00:54:55,912 --> 00:54:59,304
Hello! I'm Shivaay.
This is my daughter.

456
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:02,665
We're from India. We're looking for
Olga Baranowski.

457
00:55:03,835 --> 00:55:06,287
Olga... Olga Baranowski?
She lives here...

458
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:09,855
( Mumbling in (In Bulgarian)...)
No live here. Gone.

459
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,929
She doesn't live here anymore.
But we'll look for her.

460
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:20,171
We'll find her.
Let's go to the embassy.

461
00:55:20,248 --> 00:55:21,225
Come on!

462
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:39,266
Anu, what's the problem?...

463
00:55:39,395 --> 00:55:41,406
See, even your father approves of me ...

464
00:55:41,483 --> 00:55:43,806
Atleast tell me,
what kind of a boy you want.

465
00:55:43,896 --> 00:55:45,686
I don't know the kind I want...

466
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:49,166
but the kind I don't want,
I know for sure...

467
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:53,045
I mean a Geek?... who is obsessed
with his computer 24/7...

468
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,403
It's really not happening.

469
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,785
I will never date a hacker.

470
00:55:57,154 --> 00:56:00,844
I am not a hacker... I mean... I
am one... But I am not one in reality.

471
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:02,119
(Greeting in (In Bulgarian)...)
- Hi!

472
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:04,189
Look... All the Corporates,
Government agencies...

473
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:06,515
Even the...
Police are fans of my skills...

474
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:10,174
They hire me...
because I bust hackers for them.

475
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:13,760
Madame, I am an ethical Hacker!

476
00:56:15,156 --> 00:56:19,191
I make good money. The name commands
respect in the Hacking Community...

477
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:22,804
Maybe... But... Hacking means... theft!

478
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:25,998
And... you maybe the
worlds biggest hacker...

479
00:56:26,323 --> 00:56:27,826
Daniel!
- Daniel?

480
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:31,546
But you will never be
able to hack into my heart...

481
00:56:33,209 --> 00:56:35,894
Anu... It's a beautiful
evening let's do something!

482
00:56:35,944 --> 00:56:37,512
Why waste it?... Madame...
- Just go...

483
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:42,638
Anu... Hey okay listen,
just text me dinner or movie...

484
00:56:42,714 --> 00:56:43,713
(In (In Bulgarian)...)...
Not again wahab. You wont get her.

485
00:56:43,803 --> 00:56:45,410
Daniel, Sam damn good to see you.

486
00:56:59,444 --> 00:57:01,987
This daughter of yours...

487
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:06,046
...is she your biological daughter?

488
00:57:06,163 --> 00:57:09,557
Yes...
- Interesting... Very interesting...

489
00:57:10,142 --> 00:57:11,852
so that means her mother...

490
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,029
She was (In Bulgarian)...

491
00:57:14,276 --> 00:57:15,178
Was...?

492
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:18,602
I mean 'is'... Olga
Baranowski is her name.

493
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:20,846
This is the address she gave
but she doesn't live here anymore...

494
00:57:21,282 --> 00:57:22,431
this is her photograph

495
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:32,423
This child...

496
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,635
Yes...But she can hear fine...

497
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:38,357
Ya... what was she asking?...

498
00:57:38,884 --> 00:57:42,502
She was asking,
"Uncle will you find my Mummy?"

499
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:47,959
Okay child tell me one thing...

500
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:53,089
if I find you your Mummy,
what will I get...

501
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:04,805
This confirms one thing,
the girl may look (In Bulgarian)...

502
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:06,643
...but her heart is Indian.

503
00:58:07,094 --> 00:58:10,532
She knows the art of bribing well...

504
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:17,798
Has Anu come?
Please send her to my room, alright?...

505
00:58:20,696 --> 00:58:25,757
Shivaay, the thing is,
that I am from Bihar...

506
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:30,456
Motihari district, and this creation
of nature called the Bihari...

507
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,621
...is an amazing creature.

508
00:58:32,897 --> 00:58:36,795
The curiosity levels
of Biharis is always high.

509
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:40,815
Now you can call it
a manufacturing defect...

510
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,904
...or blame it on some
biological composition...

511
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,070
...but I am a Bihari too.

512
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,452
So I suffer the same!

513
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:53,008
So, there is a question
bouncing in my mind for a while...

514
00:58:53,365 --> 00:58:57,614
It's a personal question...
If you don't mind will you answer it?

515
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:58,972
Yes sure.

516
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:03,584
What happened? Meaning.... Divorce?

517
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:07,434
No, divorce can only
happen if there is a marriage.

518
00:59:09,606 --> 00:59:10,617
Really....

519
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:14,613
That means natural mating,
no Wedlock but Lovelock!

520
00:59:14,933 --> 00:59:17,398
You are an amazing man Mr. Shivaay!

521
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:22,413
Amazing... I think you have
a way with the fair sex.

522
00:59:24,234 --> 00:59:26,120
Sir?
- Come. Come.

523
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:31,063
On a serious note,
she is like my daughter...

524
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,056
Anushka my child this is Shivaay...

525
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:37,614
...he was sitting on Mount
Kailash and meditating...

526
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:39,353
when a beautiful (In Bulgarian)...
fairy dropped in...

527
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:43,104
...disrupted his life and disappeared.

528
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,403
Since then he has
been searching for her...

529
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:51,781
Have I made a mistake?

530
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:58,033
Sorry my child,
I am not joking around!

531
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,562
I... One minute,
Anushka my dear, come this way,

532
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:04,499
Gaura... Shshsh!

533
01:00:07,825 --> 01:00:10,004
Help them please, as much as you can.

534
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,128
Shivaay, Anushka here
will help you through it all.

535
01:00:15,703 --> 01:00:17,514
Come. Here, this is my card.

536
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:18,463
Thank you.

537
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:21,136
Hi! Gaura, Come.

538
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:30,530
If you want to find your mother you
will have to make friends with me. Ok?!

539
01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:36,969
Gaura...

540
01:01:57,754 --> 01:01:59,435
(In Bulgarian)...Take a right Quicky.

541
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:12,107
(In Bulgarian)...
Hold the girl. Keep her at the back...

542
01:09:06,512 --> 01:09:08,820
Gaura...Gaura...

543
01:09:10,717 --> 01:09:11,842
My Daughter...

544
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,350
My Daughter...

545
01:09:16,564 --> 01:09:17,543
My Daughter...

546
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,286
They've got my Daughter...

547
01:09:25,214 --> 01:09:27,921
(In Bulgarian) What proof does he have
that she is his daughter?

548
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:30,274
(In Bulgarian) She's a blonde kid.

549
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,517
Man, I have told them
a thousand times...

550
01:09:34,607 --> 01:09:35,803
...but they refuse to believe it..

551
01:09:36,602 --> 01:09:38,766
They don't believe
she's your daughter.

552
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,760
hey think you have picked
her up from somewhere and...

553
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:44,027
They think you have picked
her up from somewhere...

554
01:09:44,103 --> 01:09:47,915
want to sell her to traffickers

555
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:50,488
and make money yourself...

556
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:11,622
(In Bulgarian)...Arrest him,
don't let him go?

557
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:12,954
Surrender yourself!

558
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:18,576
Catch him! He's dangerous!

559
01:10:18,652 --> 01:10:21,349
If they lose it, you won't
even get a chance to appear in court!

560
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,990
Hit him! Hit him! Don't let him go!

561
01:10:33,278 --> 01:10:35,828
(In Bulgarian)...Leave him... Leave him...
He is innocent... Don't hit him....

562
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,116
Don't...

563
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,579
Little girl!

564
01:11:14,974 --> 01:11:16,805
Premium Price!!....

565
01:11:23,056 --> 01:11:26,048
Uncle Ustinov..ok

566
01:11:26,876 --> 01:11:27,926
and You?

567
01:11:37,247 --> 01:11:38,630
White Girl!

568
01:11:40,313 --> 01:11:42,407
Indian Passport?

569
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:51,062
Ga... Ga... uuu... Raa!

570
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:57,954
No....no Liliya.. now

571
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:00,466
Liliya!!

572
01:12:00,545 --> 01:12:04,373
You Liliya Now okay...

573
01:12:04,781 --> 01:12:09,121
Liliya...aa...Liliya...Liliya...

574
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:14,224
Liliya there my princess you...

575
01:12:14,301 --> 01:12:20,737
Liliya, Liliya Liliya princess okay...

576
01:12:27,378 --> 01:12:28,614
Father..?

577
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,552
ya father...

578
01:12:31,883 --> 01:12:34,996
shivaau...

579
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:38,550
shivaave...

580
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,249
Sh... Sh..ai... vaey. Why?

581
01:12:57,919 --> 01:12:59,155
Yes! Yes? Yes?

582
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:05,160
9Liliya... Liliya there my princess...

583
01:13:20,078 --> 01:13:22,206
(In Bulgarian)...Changez!
My friend.

584
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:39,050
Shivaay, You have jumped
into the lion's den... you won't survive

585
01:13:39,944 --> 01:13:41,861
They have charged you
on three accounts...

586
01:13:42,608 --> 01:13:46,803
child trafficking,
murder and assaulting the police...

587
01:13:48,514 --> 01:13:50,591
This isint just happeing to you...

588
01:13:51,724 --> 01:13:55,099
many kids disappear
here... and are never found...

589
01:13:55,608 --> 01:13:58,239
Because nobody knows
who took the children...

590
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,867
The kidnappers are different
from the buyers and sellers.

591
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:06,044
The human traffickers are
different from the organ traffickers.

592
01:14:06,436 --> 01:14:08,568
This is a faceless industry...

593
01:14:08,865 --> 01:14:12,785
Within seventy two hours
either their organs are removed...

594
01:14:13,752 --> 01:14:15,834
...or they are transported
outside the country...

595
01:14:16,862 --> 01:14:19,819
...and sold off into the
flesh trade in different countries

596
01:14:20,704 --> 01:14:24,061
This business is huge, worth
millions and trillions of dollars.

597
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:28,125
With so much money at stake,
how dangerous must these people be?

598
01:14:28,894 --> 01:14:32,244
This is the Russian mafia,
You won't be able to take them on...!

599
01:14:33,242 --> 01:14:37,716
How do I say this to a father,
but you won't find your daughter.

600
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:40,337
Forget that you were a father once.

601
01:15:14,107 --> 01:15:16,668
(In Bulgarian)...Convict out of control...

602

(In Bulgarian)...Convict out of control...
We need backup...Send to Krechim Dam...

603
01:15:48,825 --> 01:15:50,928
(In Bulgarian)...Convict out of control...
We need backup...Send to Krechim Dam...

604
01:15:54,152 --> 01:15:55,856
(In Bulgarian)...Convict out of control...
We need backup...Send to Krechim Dam...

01:18:01,674 --> 01:18:03,247

01:18:03,323 --> 01:18:04,904

(Spiritual Chanting in Sanskrit)

618
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,193
Leaving work early everyday for me...
is not right...

619
01:18:55,037 --> 01:18:56,633
you are neglecting your work,

620
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,533
and the reason for that is,
I'm getting old.

621
01:19:01,563 --> 01:19:03,293
My being young was also a reason, when
you refused the post of international

622
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:07,440
...when you refused the post of international
correspondent for the BBC...

623
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:10,666
...and chose instead
to be a college professor!

624
01:19:12,163 --> 01:19:15,811
Won't a father do that
much for his only daughter?

625
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:18,231
Well, by the same logic...

626
01:19:18,576 --> 01:19:22,339
...won't a daughter do
that much for her only father?

627
01:19:25,104 --> 01:19:28,061
Oh.... please not again.

628
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:31,977
Now, no making a fuss.
This is the diet given by the doctor.

629
01:19:32,054 --> 01:19:33,744
Please eat it quietly like a good boy.

630
01:19:34,589 --> 01:19:37,392
At least sometimes
behave like my daughter!

631
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:40,387
Always firing me... like a grandmother!

632
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:43,113
Well, thank your stars,
that I don't spank

633
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:44,726
you....aaa....wait....wait...

634
01:19:46,223 --> 01:19:47,644
First the medicines.

635
01:19:51,715 --> 01:19:52,943
Must be Wahab's.

636
01:19:53,366 --> 01:19:56,668
I told him not to...
No phone calls after 6 pm.

637
01:19:58,242 --> 01:20:00,239
He is a good boy.

638
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:04,425
Please adopt him then, I will
instantly make him my brother...

639
01:20:05,116 --> 01:20:09,685
The India- Pakistan problem
will be solved, it's not him....

640
01:20:10,415 --> 01:20:11,304
Hello...

641
01:20:13,026 --> 01:20:14,255
...yes Anushka here.

642
01:20:24,554 --> 01:20:25,698
Oh my god!

643
01:21:11,316 --> 01:21:15,194
Of course I want to help you,
why else would I risk meeting you?

644
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:19,764
That's why I am saying,
please surrender.

645
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:23,412
First Gaura... then surrender.

646
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:26,215
And until then...

647
01:21:26,906 --> 01:21:28,826
Will you just keep killing people?

648
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:31,091
I haven't killed anyone yet...

649
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,547
...but whoever tries
to stop me now... will die.

650
01:21:37,658 --> 01:21:41,536
Look... I understand your state of mind...

651
01:21:42,534 --> 01:21:45,337
But the fact is, your daughter
being kidnapped is one thing...

652
01:21:45,837 --> 01:21:48,678
and a father becoming a fugitive
and committing crime after crime...

653
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:51,097
...cannot be justified.

654
01:21:53,363 --> 01:21:56,588
Is this what the Indian
embassy has to say to an Indian?

655
01:21:56,665 --> 01:22:00,889
Yes... To the Indian who
had come as a tourist...

656
01:22:01,352 --> 01:22:03,727
...and has become a criminal.

657
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:13,868
Do I look like a criminal to you?

658
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:21,394
Look...

659
01:22:22,469 --> 01:22:24,658
We really want to help you...

660
01:22:25,349 --> 01:22:27,385
to prove that you are innocent.

661
01:22:29,151 --> 01:22:32,453
In seventy two hours th kidnapped
children are shipped out of the country.

662
01:22:32,837 --> 01:22:35,487
Should a father spend these
hours looking for his daughter...

663
01:22:36,024 --> 01:22:38,136
...or lose time trying
to prove his innocence?

664
01:22:42,783 --> 01:22:44,933
It's very essential
for you to surrender...

665
01:22:45,317 --> 01:22:48,197
only then can we put any
diplomatic pressure on the police...

666
01:22:48,389 --> 01:22:50,194
...to prove that you're innocent

667
01:22:51,115 --> 01:22:53,649
See, the embassy must
follow a procedure...

668
01:22:53,726 --> 01:22:56,030
...and, diplomacy has protocols.

669
01:23:18,571 --> 01:23:19,530
Stop!

670
01:23:20,183 --> 01:23:21,758
Leave me! - Stop! Or I'll kill her!

671
01:23:22,986 --> 01:23:24,177
Tell them or I'll kill you!

672
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:25,367
Please stop!

673
01:23:25,444 --> 01:23:28,055
Tell them... Tell them
I'm not a trafficker!

674
01:23:28,209 --> 01:23:29,553
(In Bulgarian)...He
is not a Trafficker...

675
01:23:29,668 --> 01:23:32,087
Tell them you've seen our passports.

676
01:23:32,164 --> 01:23:34,122
Leave me. - Tell them

677
01:23:34,698 --> 01:23:36,157
(In Bulgarian)...
I 've seen his passport...

678
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:38,807
I say Stop.

679
01:23:38,884 --> 01:23:39,882
Stop. Please Stop.

680
01:23:39,959 --> 01:23:41,495
I say stop right now!

681
01:23:44,989 --> 01:23:45,949
Leave me.

682
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:47,388
Hey come!

683
01:24:51,112 --> 01:24:52,533
(In Bulgarian)...Looking
for something?...

684
01:24:55,183 --> 01:24:57,333
(In Bulgarian)...Hey,
want something?....

685
01:24:58,216 --> 01:24:59,637
Just go!

686
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,856
(In Bulgarian)...Hey Mister...
You are handsome.

687
01:25:07,317 --> 01:25:11,694

Only four thousand rupees.
Lots of fun!

01:25:30,318 --> 01:25:31,969
This...Gaura

691
01:25:34,119 --> 01:25:36,423
Have you seen her?... 8 year old...

692
01:25:37,153 --> 01:25:38,958
Gaura... have you seen her?

693
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:45,946
(In Bulgarian)...You her father?

694
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:48,749
Are you her father?

695
01:25:49,786 --> 01:25:50,708
Yes...

696
01:25:58,349 --> 01:26:01,421
My father... Matthew.

697
01:26:02,343 --> 01:26:03,456
He never came.

698
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,067
(In Bulgarian)...I am from...
Belgrade...

699
01:26:06,259 --> 01:26:10,214
Serbia, Belgrade. Can you find him?

700
01:26:11,405 --> 01:26:13,056
Tell him Lauren's here...

701
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:17,971
Tell him I wait...
Tell him to take me home please...

702
01:26:18,585 --> 01:26:21,427
I want to go home. Home!

703
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,616
I want to go home...

704
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:28,684
Hey mister I'll give you

705
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:31,257

I'll make you happy.

706
01:26:31,334 --> 01:26:33,062
(In Bulgarian)...You will
get anything you want... anything...

707
01:26:33,139 --> 01:26:34,099
Nice room.

708
01:26:34,176 --> 01:26:36,095
(In Bulgarian)...What's
going on bitch?...

709
01:26:36,364 --> 01:26:39,551
Bargaining. He doesn't have money.

710
01:26:39,935 --> 01:26:41,318
(In Bulgarian)...He
doesn't have money...

711
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,353
No money. No fun.

712
01:26:43,468 --> 01:26:44,543
(In Bulgarian)...Fuck off...

713
01:26:45,503 --> 01:26:46,847
Get lost.

714
01:26:55,409 --> 01:26:56,255
(In Bulgarian)...No wasting her time.
She is working...

715
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:58,597
(In Bulgarian)...I'll
do whatever you say...

716
01:26:58,674 --> 01:26:59,865
I'll get you money.

717
01:26:59,941 --> 01:27:01,900
(In Bulgarian)...No Money... No Fun...

718
01:27:01,976 --> 01:27:02,855
(In Bulgarian)...He
doesn't have money...

719
01:27:02,895 --> 01:27:04,835
I'll get you money!
I'll get customers...

720
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:06,200
I'll do everything you want!

721
01:27:06,277 --> 01:27:07,160
(In Bulgarian)...Don't
hit me please...

722
01:27:07,237 --> 01:27:09,503
(In Bulgarian)... You bloody Bitch...

723
01:28:02,801 --> 01:28:08,061
(In Bulgarian)

724
01:28:08,906 --> 01:28:11,978
(In Bulgarian)

725
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:15,703
(In Bulgarian)....Changez...

726
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,709
(In Bulgarian)...Send Ivanovich
to the police station...

727
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:27,399
(In Bulgarian)...
Delete all the records...

728
01:28:38,223 --> 01:28:43,344
(In Bulgarian)...We are fucked.
Some fucking Asian man...

729
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:48,327
Ivanovich Get up..

730
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:15,876
..get up! Go! Go! Go Now!

731
01:30:22,343 --> 01:30:25,453
Move. Go! Go!

732
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:19,980
(In Bulgarian)... Who did this?...

733
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,014
(In Bulgarian)... One man...

734
01:31:37,172 --> 01:31:40,934
I think your embassy must intervene.

735
01:31:41,014 --> 01:31:42,364
What's wrong with you papa?

736
01:31:42,858 --> 01:31:45,250
After what this man
has done with me today...

737
01:31:45,365 --> 01:31:47,451
you are still advocating for him?

738
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:50,586
He is a first rate criminal.

739
01:31:51,449 --> 01:31:55,497
Unpredictable and...
very dangerous too...

740
01:31:56,433 --> 01:32:00,215
And.... a father too! That's him right?

741
01:32:09,352 --> 01:32:10,443
Look...

742
01:32:12,204 --> 01:32:16,759
90% of us won't get
into a mess like this...

743
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,152
But he's different....

744
01:32:19,573 --> 01:32:23,385
He is an extraordinary man
in extraordinary circumstances.

745
01:32:23,561 --> 01:32:24,742
If I may say so...

746
01:32:29,511 --> 01:32:35,078
My child.. He is only following
a father's natural instinct...

747
01:32:36,788 --> 01:32:40,105
And I wouldn't hesitate either,
before killing someone...

748
01:32:40,323 --> 01:32:42,293
...if they were to kidnap you...

749
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:52,167
Who will that be?...Wait let me check.

750
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:54,858
No, No!

751
01:33:20,114 --> 01:33:24,365
So you won't help a
father... to find his daughter...

752
01:33:25,794 --> 01:33:29,327
but atleast you can help a
daughter reach her father?

753
01:33:35,466 --> 01:33:37,499
...and I will find my Gaura ...

754
01:33:39,471 --> 01:33:41,190
I don't need anyone's help...

755
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,475
Let her in, Anu my child.

756
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:03,370
Anushka!

757
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:26,691
No! Papa!

758
01:34:28,149 --> 01:34:29,303
papa...

759
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:36,860
Someone will have to stand up...

760
01:34:38,008 --> 01:34:40,166
...for the sake of
these missing children...

761
01:34:42,951 --> 01:34:45,692
How else will they return home?

762
01:34:45,786 --> 01:34:49,738
The truth is that this man has
saved the child from a paedophile....

763
01:34:50,497 --> 01:34:54,153
As a matter of fact he has
saved many girls from flesh trade.

764
01:34:54,631 --> 01:34:56,811
How can he be a human trafficker?

765
01:34:57,404 --> 01:35:00,164
He's a human trafficker that's
what we think and it's a mistake.

766
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:02,407
In the news is an Indian
tourist Shivaay in Sofia...

767
01:35:02,484 --> 01:35:05,542
...has rescued many

768
01:35:05,592 --> 01:35:08,972
women and children...

769
01:35:09,652 --> 01:35:12,404
We're getting all the
documents from MEA in India...

770
01:35:12,481 --> 01:35:14,485
...to prove his credentials
and his innocence.

771
01:35:14,887 --> 01:35:17,978
Lastly, I would request the
police authorities in Sofia to stop...

772
01:35:18,055 --> 01:35:20,223
...hunting this man,
and instead hunt...

773
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:22,271
...those who have actually
kidnapped his daughter!

774
01:35:22,471 --> 01:35:25,293
The Indian Tourist Shivaay
who arrived in Sofia to get...

775
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:27,889
...his daughter to see her mother,
is still at large.

776
01:35:28,032 --> 01:35:29,938
Although he doesn't
seem to be a criminal...

777
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:31,984
...he has so far considered to be one.

778
01:35:32,135 --> 01:35:34,218
The Indian man Shivaay's
daughter went...

779
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,344
...missing soon after
they arrived in Sofia.

780
01:35:36,421 --> 01:35:39,057
She is eight years old.
And she happens to be mute.

781
01:35:39,134 --> 01:35:41,378
Her name is Gaura and apparently...

782
01:35:41,455 --> 01:35:42,373
(In Bulgarian)... Go...

783
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,218
...she has a Bulgarian mother
whose whereabouts are still unknown.

784
01:35:47,099 --> 01:35:48,788
All clear. Thank you.... Thank you....

785
01:35:48,865 --> 01:35:50,157
Thank you very much... Gentleman.

786
01:35:56,924 --> 01:35:57,823
Anu...

787
01:36:02,845 --> 01:36:04,705
...you heard what these people said...

788
01:36:05,919 --> 01:36:08,430
...there is no such thing
called diplomatic immunity...

789
01:36:09,968 --> 01:36:11,938
...they will just throw
you out of the country...

790
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:16,112
...you will not meet
Shivaay and that's final.

791
01:36:16,189 --> 01:36:17,966
Sir, what the police
was not able to do for years...

792
01:36:18,043 --> 01:36:20,056
...this man has done in hours.

793
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:23,910
Yes he is Superman,
Batman... Spiderman...

794
01:36:24,713 --> 01:36:26,548
I forget that you are
from the generation...

795
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:28,303
...that has grown up reading comics...

796
01:36:32,237 --> 01:36:37,575
Listen child... life is
not a thirty page comic book...

797
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,774
You are the one who
asked me to help him.

798
01:36:39,851 --> 01:36:42,601
Yes I did say that... because
he was just a tourist then

799
01:36:43,698 --> 01:36:46,515
...and now he is a criminal
in this country...

800
01:36:48,065 --> 01:36:51,157
And till the time all
is not clarified or proven,

801
01:36:51,236 --> 01:36:53,045
that he is not involved
in any criminal activity....

802
01:36:53,122 --> 01:36:54,943
...but actually doing social good...

803
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,599
Do you even understand the difference?

804
01:36:57,676 --> 01:36:58,765
I do sir...

805
01:36:58,998 --> 01:36:59,838
Good.

806
01:37:01,025 --> 01:37:02,800
So till all this is not proven...

807
01:37:03,159 --> 01:37:06,926
...you will not help this
man in your official capacity.

808
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:10,419
I can help in my individual capacity,
Right sir?

809
01:37:15,866 --> 01:37:16,811
Yes you can...

810
01:37:18,633 --> 01:37:20,651
But there will be dire consequences...

811
01:37:24,105 --> 01:37:24,965
Anu...

812
01:37:28,289 --> 01:37:29,773
Why are you doing this...

813
01:37:31,273 --> 01:37:33,537
Why are you taking this
case so personally my dear?

814
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:37,275
Because outside the world of comics,
superheroes are hard to find, sir.

815
01:37:42,646 --> 01:37:44,055
Anushka someone is here to meet you.

816
01:38:28,258 --> 01:38:29,271
Yes Changez...

817
01:39:14,358 --> 01:39:15,436
Why is she here?

818
01:39:17,047 --> 01:39:18,412
For my daughter.

819
01:39:19,337 --> 01:39:20,389
After nine years?

820
01:39:25,673 --> 01:39:29,245
I thought...everything was over.

821
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:33,371
...That was a life I left behind.

822
01:39:34,857 --> 01:39:36,088
And I've moved on!

823
01:39:37,779 --> 01:39:42,317
But seeing the news on
TV today I suddenly felt that...

824
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:47,401
...there is still a mother inside me.

825
01:39:49,394 --> 01:39:51,265
A daughter needs to
get kidnapped for a...

826
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:56,508
...mother to realise
that she is still a mother!

827
01:39:58,653 --> 01:40:00,883
Her, Have you seen her?

828
01:40:01,358 --> 01:40:02,241
She is my daughter.

829
01:40:02,745 --> 01:40:05,524
She came to meet her mother
to find out if she loves her or not!

830
01:40:05,601 --> 01:40:06,642
Have you seen her?

831
01:40:15,547 --> 01:40:16,620
She's eight.

832
01:40:19,006 --> 01:40:20,292
She even looks like her mother...

833
01:40:21,185 --> 01:40:22,045
Have you seen her?

834
01:40:27,547 --> 01:40:30,480
But now... I want to see her.

835
01:40:38,194 --> 01:40:40,342
The first time I had
to save my baby from you...

836
01:40:42,597 --> 01:40:44,380
...this time I have
to save her because of you.

837
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:48,239
Do you even know her name?
Have you ever seen her?

838
01:40:48,315 --> 01:40:50,434
I haven't seen her!

839
01:40:51,327 --> 01:40:53,108
I didn't even know her name!

840
01:40:54,205 --> 01:40:55,822
I didn't even want to know it!

841
01:40:56,439 --> 01:41:02,006
All I knew was that I have a
daughter, who I had left with you.

842
01:41:02,865 --> 01:41:05,011
I thought you could take care of her.

843
01:41:05,912 --> 01:41:07,001
But I was wrong.

844
01:41:08,632 --> 01:41:10,029
Find her and bring her back.

845
01:41:11,382 --> 01:41:12,608
I want my daughter back.

846
01:41:13,463 --> 01:41:14,702
I want her back!

847
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,736
And I want to see her and
I want to see if she's fine!

848
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,781
And I want to see if she's ok.

849
01:41:25,726 --> 01:41:27,531
I want my child back!

850
01:41:27,608 --> 01:41:28,599
I want my child back!

851
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:30,563
I just want her back!

852
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:37,771
Hello... You aren't familiar with
the way the police functions here...

853
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:40,723
If they find out,
they will take my balls...

854
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,886
...and fry them for breakfast
with tabasco sauce...

855
01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:44,650
...and not even stop to say yummy!

856
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:47,221
Sorry Madam!

857
01:41:48,214 --> 01:41:49,371
Here you go sir!

858
01:41:50,022 --> 01:41:51,670
Is this the Bridge.

859
01:41:54,431 --> 01:41:55,329
Welcome.

860
01:41:55,738 --> 01:41:58,052
'Uncle' Google can only
help you till this point.

861
01:41:58,532 --> 01:42:01,839
To go any further... you need Wahab...

862
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:07,804
For what you need I'll have
to access the CCTV footage...

863
01:42:08,595 --> 01:42:11,262
...for which I'll need to
get into the Pathna Police's...

864
01:42:11,352 --> 01:42:13,450
...main server and hack it.

865
01:42:14,174 --> 01:42:15,226
No, no no no...

866
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:17,282
So? Let's do it Wahab!

867
01:42:18,493 --> 01:42:19,327
What?

868
01:42:19,404 --> 01:42:20,525
Ya, do it!

869
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:24,669
Everyday, Anushka coffee? "No Wahab."

870
01:42:24,758 --> 01:42:26,474
Anushka Dinner? "No Wahab."

871
01:42:26,551 --> 01:42:29,909
Now I'm about to commit the
first crime of my hacking career

872
01:42:29,985 --> 01:42:31,812
"Hey Wahab, let's do it!"

873
01:42:33,665 --> 01:42:36,955
Behind the downfall of every
great hacker is a woman he loves!

874
01:42:37,463 --> 01:42:38,403
Too Much.

875
01:42:41,164 --> 01:42:45,235
Ready, set, GO!

876
01:42:45,477 --> 01:42:47,379
Now don't ask what's going on!

877
01:42:47,456 --> 01:42:49,799
Until I don't get the
source code of their OS...

878
01:42:49,876 --> 01:42:53,890
...I won't be able to find
where to track them from. Coffee?

879
01:43:05,692 --> 01:43:08,660
This is the man. Find out who he is.

880
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:17,507
I'll have to download the footage
first then commit another crime.

881
01:43:18,033 --> 01:43:21,247
I'll have to hack into the main server
of the Police Headquarters and...

882
01:43:21,324 --> 01:43:26,011
...then match this image with the
images in their criminal database...

883
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:29,978
...and then if he has a criminal
record then we'll find him.

884
01:43:31,389 --> 01:43:33,620
Then do it.
- How long will it take?

885
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:37,479
If you keep asking
questions then I don't know!

886
01:43:39,522 --> 01:43:42,834
Sorry, but if we can maintain
some silence for the...

887
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:45,474
...sake of the spirit
of the dead, then...

888
01:43:45,524 --> 01:43:48,305
Then?
Ten Minutes, Max!

889
01:43:49,091 --> 01:43:50,033
Do it!

890
01:43:53,179 --> 01:43:57,947
My beloved, the Bulgarian
police will kill me!

891
01:43:59,896 --> 01:44:02,804
If you don't, he'll do the same.

892
01:44:25,624 --> 01:44:26,929
(In Bulgarian)...Delete...

893
01:44:29,777 --> 01:44:31,143
Delete

894
01:44:33,502 --> 01:44:36,504
One minute, Look at this!

895
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:39,220
You said this is an accident.

896
01:44:39,297 --> 01:44:41,264
he man was run over by a truck.
Can't you see?

897
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:42,905
No. I can see something else!

898
01:44:44,065 --> 01:44:45,008
Look at this.

899
01:44:45,783 --> 01:44:48,710
This truck purposely
tried to run you over.

900
01:44:49,984 --> 01:44:52,134
You moved. He couldn't.

901
01:44:53,698 --> 01:44:54,627
It's a murder.

902
01:44:57,376 --> 01:45:00,062
This is your man.
Stop searching for the dead...

903
01:45:00,358 --> 01:45:01,794
You need to catch him.

904
01:45:02,424 --> 01:45:04,053
He'll tell you where your daughter is.

905
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:07,364
(In Bulgarian)...What the hell...

906
01:45:07,579 --> 01:45:08,957
...file is in use...

907
01:45:16,622 --> 01:45:19,432
Download begins, Pizza?

908
01:45:20,467 --> 01:45:21,717
What happened?

909
01:45:25,169 --> 01:45:27,482
Shit! Shit! Shit!

910
01:45:27,945 --> 01:45:30,089
They are tracing us...I'm
being double hacked!

911
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:31,415
Meaning?

912
01:45:31,495 --> 01:45:34,079
Meaning, this file won't be downloaded.
The bastards have stopped it.

913
01:45:34,894 --> 01:45:35,989
I want this file.

914
01:45:40,333 --> 01:45:42,083
(In Bulgarian)...
let them download...

915
01:45:47,755 --> 01:45:49,193
It's downloading again! Relax...

916
01:45:49,273 --> 01:45:51,646
No! They're letting it download!
They're definitely tracing us!

917
01:45:51,932 --> 01:45:53,426
Sir- I'm stopping this download,
alright?

918
01:45:54,069 --> 01:45:56,621
No! Please!
I'll have to rot in jail all my life!

919
01:45:56,697 --> 01:45:58,018
And what about my daughter?

920
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:00,395
You have no idea how
dangerous these bastards are!

921
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:02,621
They will reach straight here now!

922
01:46:02,698 --> 01:46:07,315
No one is safe, not you nor us.
We need to run. Now!

923
01:46:08,342 --> 01:46:09,622
Who will come here?

924
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,300
Papa....
- Anu... Where are you my child?

925
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,020
Are you alright.....

926
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:15,340
I am heading somewhere... on the way.

927
01:50:15,748 --> 01:50:19,242
You have chosen the right way...
That's all I wanted to say...

928
01:50:19,785 --> 01:50:21,667
Take care... Love you papa!

929
01:50:49,617 --> 01:50:51,024
Yes...

930
01:51:35,456 --> 01:51:38,050
(In Bulgarian)...Changez...
my friend...

931
01:53:23,435 --> 01:53:24,982
Shivaay...

932
01:56:49,102 --> 01:56:50,947
Where is my daughter...
Where is my daughter ...

933
01:56:51,027 --> 01:56:52,102
(In Bulgarian)...
Where is his daughter?...

934
01:56:52,294 --> 01:56:53,162
(In Bulgarian)...
The girl with this doll...

935
01:56:53,202 --> 01:56:54,596
Tell me where is my daughter....

936
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:55,964
(In Bulgarian)...Where is she...
- Tell me...

937
01:56:56,179 --> 01:56:57,487
Changez...!

938
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:00,140
Changez?......
- Yes...

939
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:03,620
apart from the three of us only Ivanovich
knew about where we were going.

940
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,740
That's why before we got
here he finished off Ustinov.

941
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:09,700
But Ivanovich is in police
custody... the safest place.

942
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:12,138
We must find out from
him... who is Changez...?

943
01:57:13,994 --> 01:57:18,288
Don't worry, Sir! I got it- understood.
Ivanovich is our last hope.

944
01:58:27,284 --> 01:58:29,244
Even Ivanovich has
been killed in custody...

945
01:58:30,296 --> 01:58:32,956
There isn't anyone left
who can lead us to Changez.

946
01:58:53,026 --> 01:58:56,103
But Ivanovich is in police
custody... the safest place!

947
01:58:57,676 --> 01:58:59,393
Changez is someone in the police.

948
01:59:36,594 --> 01:59:37,707
(In Bulgarian)...It's
an in custody death...

949
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:42,917
...Before the media hunts me down,
I need to know who it is....

950
01:59:43,007 --> 01:59:45,188
(In Bulgarian)...All
the officers working...

951
01:59:45,395 --> 01:59:48,325
...under me are present here...

952
01:59:48,904 --> 01:59:51,211
(In Bulgarian)...Thirty
of us...All here..

953
01:59:51,277 --> 01:59:53,403
(In Bulgarian)...One
of us has killed this man...

954
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:55,163
Changez....

955
02:00:32,798 --> 02:00:34,309
Sgt. Nikolai.

956
02:00:34,346 --> 02:00:36,330
Nikolai... Nikolai... Nikolai...

957
02:00:37,304 --> 02:00:38,672
Nikolai ... Found him.

958
02:00:41,927 --> 02:00:43,339
(In Bulgarian)...Who is it?...

959
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:56,129
Got him

960
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:26,162
Sgt. Nkolai....tracing mobile.

961
02:02:31,999 --> 02:02:33,705
(In Bulgarian)

962
02:02:33,745 --> 02:02:35,796
(In Bulgarian)

963
02:02:35,876 --> 02:02:37,711
(In Bulgarian)

964
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:41,277
(In Bulgarian)

965
02:02:41,529 --> 02:02:42,662
Got him...

966
02:02:44,833 --> 02:02:47,308
okay listen...
stop following changez...

967
02:02:47,392 --> 02:02:49,952
Gaura is in a van, that van is
headed towards the Romanian border...

968
02:02:50,181 --> 02:02:52,530
...follow that van now... go.
- Take a right.

969
02:03:27,956 --> 02:03:30,320
By the time the van gets
to the speed of 50 kmph...

970
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:33,644
...you must be at 70... Drive fast... Go!

971
02:03:38,152 --> 02:03:41,076
Listen to me- the van
is 27 kms away from the border.

972
02:03:41,344 --> 02:03:43,102
And we...
- 42 kilometers away...

973
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:59,180
Ok New plan, Short cut...

974
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:00,620
Sharp left now!

975
02:04:18,052 --> 02:04:21,046
Where are you? Come on, come on...

976
02:04:22,825 --> 02:04:26,005
Come on the van is only eight
kilometres away from the border...

977
02:04:28,505 --> 02:04:32,173
come on... come on... come on... You can
do it. Drive like Schumacher man.

978
02:04:50,427 --> 02:04:51,780
Yes!...

979
02:04:58,448 --> 02:05:01,109
Yes! Going, going going keep going.

980
02:05:03,506 --> 02:05:06,804
Guys the van is almost at the border,
Where are you guys...

981
02:05:08,574 --> 02:05:11,506
Hurry up,
hurry up... we don't have time.

982
02:05:34,017 --> 02:05:36,469
The van is just two kilometres
away from the border...

983
02:05:38,926 --> 02:05:41,247
and you're five kilometres away...

984
02:05:47,249 --> 02:05:51,831
if the van crosses the border...
you daughter is gone... remember that...

985
02:06:02,807 --> 02:06:04,710
In Bulgarian

986
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:06,735
In Bulgarian

987
02:06:07,924 --> 02:06:10,719
Sorry Sir, we lost her!

988
02:06:11,555 --> 02:06:12,926
In Bulgarian

989
02:06:33,877 --> 02:06:35,681
In Bulgarian... Changez...

990
02:06:37,266 --> 02:06:39,335
In Bulgarian

991
02:07:07,709 --> 02:07:09,179

992
02:07:09,259 --> 02:07:11,814
(In Bulgarian)...Get the gun...

993
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,501
Gaura...

994
02:08:30,171 --> 02:08:31,639
Gaura...

995
02:08:32,506 --> 02:08:33,661
Gaura...

996
02:08:34,076 --> 02:08:35,070
Gaura...

997
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:39,751
Gaura...shshshsh...

998
02:08:39,928 --> 02:08:44,165
Gaura...

999
02:08:46,604 --> 02:08:50,602
Nights by your Pillow...

1000
02:08:51,235 --> 02:08:54,265
Excuses of Nightmares...

1001
02:08:56,070 --> 02:09:00,270
Spent awake... Gaura...

1002
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,196
shshshshsh...

1003
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:08,270
Silent Conversations ...

1004
02:09:08,421 --> 02:09:12,050
Knit in Memories...

1005
02:09:13,262 --> 02:09:15,861
Shared between us...

1006
02:09:18,928 --> 02:09:23,185
Look at this world...

1007
02:09:23,889 --> 02:09:27,394
Of Frozen Frames from our life ...

1008
02:09:29,132 --> 02:09:34,262
It's only You and only Me here ...

1009
02:09:34,731 --> 02:09:36,302
It's only we both.

1010
02:09:37,908 --> 02:09:40,676
Gaura...
It's me...

1011
02:09:41,153 --> 02:09:44,904
Gaura...Yes...

1012
02:14:00,679 --> 02:14:04,866
Any fears
I may have

1013
02:14:05,539 --> 02:14:09,454
Deep with in you

1014
02:14:10,261 --> 02:14:15,278
My cold shivering hands

1015
02:14:15,358 --> 02:14:19,720
Warmed by your breath

1016
02:14:20,419 --> 02:14:25,656
If I woke in my sleep

1017
02:14:29,796 --> 02:14:35,400
You lay awake with me

1018
02:14:39,421 --> 02:14:45,204
My worries are not worried

1019
02:14:49,103 --> 02:14:54,568
Because you are with me

1020
02:15:17,701 --> 02:15:21,338
Look at this world

1021
02:15:22,228 --> 02:15:26,260
Of Frozen Frames from our life

1022
02:15:27,328 --> 02:15:33,478
It's only You and only Me here

1023
02:15:41,628 --> 02:15:43,589
