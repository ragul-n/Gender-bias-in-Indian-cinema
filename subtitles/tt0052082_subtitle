1
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,572
-Madame, take care of your things.
- No need to bother about me.

2
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,246
- What do you mean?
- Take the hint.

3
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,918
You don't know how I've lived
these past 10 years.

4
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,922
Look at me, son;
I'm your mother.

5
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:39,754
My mother died 10 years ago,
and I too.

6
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,937
Only Chiranjilal, Banarasi and
Bindiya are the one who are alive.

7
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:53,276
I'm alive only for you,
to see you being released from jail.

8
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,449
Mother, now you must
go home.

9
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,949
- Or a crowd will gather.
- Let a crowd gather.

10
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,613
I want the crowd to gather so
that I can tell them,...

11
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:13,125
to take a look at my son who never
abused or cheated anyone.

12
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,294
But who was falsely
implicated for murder,...

13
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,963
and sentenced to
life imprisonment.

14
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,466
Hurry up and finish your
conversation with your son.

15
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:31,982
I'm meeting my son after 10 years
and you want me to hurry up.

16
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,148
Move, mother.
Let's leave.

17
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,982
I'm sorry. Mrs Lal has
sent me to receive you.

18
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,996
But a rogue delayed me.

19
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,491
Dear, I can't accompany you as my
brother has come to receive me.

20
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,495
So I'm going with him and
give my regards to Mrs Lal.

21
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,004
Also tell her that I'll
call up in the morning.

22
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:05,006
Dear, take this with you.

23
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,349
- Where are you going?
- To Aham village.

24
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,523
I stay with my employers.

25
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,689
I got news that my son,....

26
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,023
was being transferred to Mirzapur
jail from the Lucknow jail.

27
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:25,527
I was staying at the guest
house for 5 days.

28
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:32,375
And all the while I was anxious to
meet him and today I met him.

29
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,040
- Greetings!
- Dear, he is the accountant.

30
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,385
- He manages my employer's accounts.
- I was looking for you.

31
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,718
The boss has replaced you
with another servant.

32
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:56,228
What? You know how much this
job means to me.

33
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,900
I know but this is
God's will.

34
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,576
Here is your belongings.
I couldn't take the risk any longer.

35
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:12,175
I knew I'd meet you here.

36
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,412
May God bless you!

37
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:22,083
With people like you still around
good will always exists.

38
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,587
Mother, I came here without
informing the boss.

39
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:34,101
You know that if I don't reach by
morning he'll sack me also.

40
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,100
- I've to fend for my family.
- Son, you must leave.

41
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:44,776
- But where will you go?
- Wherever destiny takes me.

42
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,116
I'll have to begin life anew.

43
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:54,286
I'm skeptical about finding
another job.

44
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,129
- Greetings!
- God bless you!

45
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,967
- Keep your belongings safely.
- I will.

46
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,474
- Where will you go now?
- I don't know.

47
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,811
Stay the night with me and I'll
try to fix a job for you.

48
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,645
You can stay with me till you
find a place of your own.

49
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,482
Really?

50
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,162
Madame, only Re 1 for a ride
to the mansion.

51
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,396
- You are charging more.
- There's no other transport.

52
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,568
It's upto you if you
want to take it.

53
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,834
Okay. But who's in the
front seat?

54
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,682
He'll get down on the way
at Ram temple.

55
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:57,519
- Come, Madame.
- Mother, we'll hire another coach.

56
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,523
Madame, you may not find
another coach, so get in.

57
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:05,193
- It's okay.
- Okay, I'll make way for you.

58
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:14,196
- Driver, take the Madame.
- Get in, Madame.

59
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,709
But I'll have to find
another traveller.

60
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,707
- I'll pay you for that.
- Okay.

61
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:26,875
- Madame, is this your key?
- Yeah, it is mine.

62
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,552
This gentleman is so nice.
Madame, allow him to travel.

63
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,551
- You mind your business.
- Okay.

64
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,225
- We'll meet again.
- You drive.

65
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,567
Come, son.

66
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,583
'The separated will meet again'.

67
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,486
I had to close shop and you
can think about poetry.

68
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:09,417
I'm right, everything
will again come back.

69
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:14,262
- Take this.
- Vikas, you take everything easy.

70
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,258
This is fate.

71
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:24,273
God is a magician and decides
all our joys and sorrows.

72
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:33,615
Are you hurt? Eat some
almonds to improve your health.

73
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,790
You are again upto
your pranks.

74
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,289
If you think yourself to be so
clever transform these in

75
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,788
I can but they won't
serve any purpose.

76
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,294
- We aren't fated for good things.
- I know that.

77
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,699
What news have you got for
the next issue?

78
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,635
- For the next issue?
- I'm not deaf.

79
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,537
Take this.

80
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,543
God willing the separated
will be re-united.

81
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,817
The intelligent only
needs a hint.

82
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,817
The girl's handbag is like
a match-box.

83
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,325
- This will hardly make an item.
- This will make an entire story.

84
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,655
A love story? And that no
longer interests people.

85
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,989
They want films.

86
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:24,333
We need spicy and juicy
stories for our newspaper.

87
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,330
Like a beautiful girl fell
in a heated wok.

88
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:31,001
Or a horse smelt his
lost master.

89
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,011
Or 20 people were murdered
by a single bullet.

90
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,846
And later it was found that
it was a fake bullet.

91
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,672
Now, you got it!

92
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,352
You yourself fabricate and
publish such news. Goodbye!

93
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,754
- Then what shall I do?
- We must wait for sensational news.

94
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,527
- lt'll be an eternal wait.
- What are you saying?

95
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,523
It doesn't take long for
things to happen.

96
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,701
Whoever proves my son innocent
and releases him from jail,...

97
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,706
will be rewarded Rs10,000.
Address P.O.Box 999.

98
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,539
- Mr Karamveer, this sounds good.
- What nonsense?

99
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:15,384
You are right. 

100
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,552
The mother thinks her son
to be innocent.

101
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,897
This ad was published 5
years ago also.

102
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,732
It is only a mother's plea.

103
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,736
That time the reward was Rs 5,000
and today it's doubled.

104
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,901
So let's wait for the reward to
reach Rs 1 5,000 and then try.

105
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,913
Right; so let's discard it.

106
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,415
Vikas, I think this will
work in our favour.

107
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,763
I feel we're slated
for better things.

108
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:07,098
So, let's hurry.
Vikas, you must leave immediately

109
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:14,776
Ready to leave, but...
I haven't received 6 months salary.

110
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,781
I'll pay you the entire amount
on completion of the job.

111
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,455
- Can I meet Neelima devi?- Why?

112
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,961
I've come in answer to the ad about Mohan.

113
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,127
- Do come in.- I'd placed that ad. Sit down.

114
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,800
- Thanks.- I was telling Mrs Das,..

115
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,974
about the lack of response to the ad.

116
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,643
- I've come.- I'm very happy.

117
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,141
Before you ask anything...

118
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,811
I want to tell you everything
about my dear Mohan.

119
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:57,818
That'll be better.

120
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,995
Mohan was very pampered.

121
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:12,903
I was very attached to him
and he always ate with me.

122
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:20,009
If I ever woke up late he'd himself come to me.

123
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,841
And would wake me up in his melodious voice.

124
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:33,850
He had a voice that was loud and clear.

125
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,861
- Why did you stop writing?- I am writing.

126
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:48,438
Mohan's eyes would fill with love
on seeing my friend's leave.

127
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,537
And if someone tried to be rude to me,...

128
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,877
he'd dart a glare. Continue writing.

129
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,541
- I'm writing.- Mrs. Das, what else can I write?

130
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,555
There's nothing else. Show his photographs.

131
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:11,791
- You must be having his pictures?
- I've innumerable.

132
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,226
The photographer clicked innumerable
pictures on every birthday ofhis.

133
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:24,065
And he also readily posed.

134
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,569
- What else?- Don't impose; she gets emotional.

135
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,814
- I'm sorry.- Everything about him was good.

136
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:43,988
Except that,... People felt so but
I thought that was his highlight.

137
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:51,925
- What was that?- His tail was cut.

138
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:58,269
- What do you mean?- I mean his tail was cut.

139
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,948
- What's wrong with you?
- I've a headache.

140
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:11,783
- Can I get a glass of water?
- Neelima, fetch a glass of water.

141
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,952
- Write further.
- I want a glass of water first.

142
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,128
Okay.

143
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,295
Give it to him not me.

144
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:48,158
I want to know the crime for
which Mohan was arrested?

145
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:54,655
Why would he be jailed?
He only barked never bit.

146
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,669
I'm sorry but there's some
problem somewhere.

147
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,670
Madame, I know this man
very well.

148
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:08,169
- He's good at juggling things.
- You take me to be a thief?

149
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,012
I know you are one.

150
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,687
There were two roses and
now one is missing.

151
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,191
- Search him.- What?

152
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,693
- Look.- Thief!

153
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,937
What will I gain by stealing a flower?

154
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,038
- Force of habit.
- Neelima, call the police.

155
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:42,203
Madame, forget it but ask him
never to step here again.

156
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,715
- Go.- Didn't you hear?

157
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,717
- But,...- No ifs and buts.

158
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,890
- Madame, will you have tea?
- No, get a cold drink instead.

159
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,729
- What is it?- Wait.

160
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,068
- I've not flicked anything.
- I know.

161
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,066
- But,...- You had your revenge.

162
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,074
You think only you are
good at juggling?

163
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,080
That's why I applaud you.

164
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,414
Aren't you ashamed to chase
me on flimsy excuses?

165
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,918
Who followed you?
What's so great about you?

166
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,089
- Then why did you come?
- In response to this ad.

167
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,102
But I wasn't aware that l'd
counter crazy people here.

168
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:46,108
Nobody is crazy here. My Madame
lost her dog and so had put an ad.

169
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,111
- But this is not that ad.
- Then whose is it?

170
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,114
- The address is the same.
- Follow me.

171
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,454
Don't trap me because
I don't trust you.

172
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:03,291
I too don't trust you yet I'll
introduce you to her.

173
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,959
She's a poor and hapless woman so
don't try your tricks with her.

174
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,136
Because you know my
prowess too.

175
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,037
Don't worry and lead the way.

176
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:26,314
Mother, this man has come
in response to your ad.

177
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,151
- Madame's waiting for me.
- The separated,...

178
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,989
Talk to him from a distance
or he may flick something.

179
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,159
He's not trustworthy. He's the same
fellow we met at the station.

180
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:48,829
Though she's praised me enough yet
I'll try to be of some help to you.

181
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,969
Give honest replies to
my questions.

182
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,175
- Ask.
- Is your son's name Mohan?

183
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:59,180
- Yes.
- He's serving life imprisonment?

184
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,846
- Yes.
- 10 years have already passed?

185
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:08,189
- Yes.
- You had placed this ad?

186
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,852
I'll reward Rs 10,000 to the person
who proves my son innocent.

187
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:18,199
You'll give the money?
Where is the exit?

188
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,202
- Why?
- I think I'm in a mental asylum.

189
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,040
How will you be able to
pay the reward money?

190
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,883
Why are you trying to fool
yourself and others too?

191
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:39,053
Son, I've Rs 300 less to 10,000.

192
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,890
But I'm not trying to cheat anyone.

193
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,556
I'll show it to you.

194
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,894
See, these are not counterfeit notes.

195
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:59,234
- Where did you get it from?
- This is my hard earned money.

196
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:05,075
I've saved every penny to
prove my son's innocence.

197
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:15,257
I've slogged day and night.

198
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:21,592
I could only see my son's innocent face.

199
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,095
Which goaded me to work.

200
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:38,439
Don't go by my appearance.
I'm a hapless mother,...

201
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:43,117
who's feelings can't be gauged by money.

202
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,451
I can understand your feelings, mother.

203
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,122
But how are you confident about
your son's innocence?

204
00:23:53,999 --> 00:24:00,131
I can rely on my instincts.

205
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,300
Get out!

206
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,978
The accountant had come to
return this only.

207
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:16,309
Last night you were anxious to know
as to how I'd arrange for the money?

208
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,985
I evaded your question
but this is that money.

209
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:27,158
It is less than Rs 1 0,000
and so I wanted a job,....

210
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,331
to earn more money.

211
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:36,333
You don't know how I've slogged
to save this money.

212
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:44,012
I starved and slogged to save.

213
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:52,684
I can understand your feelings for your son.

214
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,023
While placing the ad I thought you,...

215
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:02,028
wanted to lure someone into doing your work.

216
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:10,371
Please forgive me for misunderstanding you.

217
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,711
I've saved every penny to get
my innocent son released.

218
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,213
I've Rs 300 less to Rs 10,000.

219
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:33,394
I've slogged day and night.

220
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:41,394
I only visualised my innocent son's face.

221
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:50,411
Take a look at a mother's
feelings which is invaluable.

222
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,420
Greetings, Mr Karamveer!
Didn't you sleep well at night?

223
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,091
No.

224
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,599
Last night I had a beautiful dream.

225
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,429
But what about the job I'd assigned?

226
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,337
I was coming to that.

227
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,443
- You were mentioning your dream?
- Yes.

228
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,449
And one day my dream will come true.

229
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:32,513
That old lady, who feels the
anguish of her son's separation,...

230
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:39,625
was right. Mr Karamveer, I think she's right.

231
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,632
Her son is innocent.

232
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,135
You'll have to help me.

233
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,136
After all it involves Rs 10,000.

234
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,134
- I can even lay my life.
- Promise?

235
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,804
I'll keep my commitment.

236
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,370
Then issue the following headline,...

237
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,376
that a innocent man was sentenced to
life imprisonment 10 years ago.

238
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,812
This is not possible.

239
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,645
- I'll have to close shop.
- It's as good that even now.

240
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,819
But this is inviting trouble
and I can't do it.

241
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:15,493
- What about your promises?
- Whatever but I can't do this.

242
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,329
- This is a golden opportunity.
- No!

243
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,170
Once this news is published
all doors will open.

244
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,671
Whatever but I won't publish this.

245
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:34,182
- Won't you?- No.

246
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,521
An innocent man serves jail
sentence since 10 years.

247
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,521
Mother, a news has been
published about your son Mohan.

248
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:52,425
They've appealed to the police dept
to investigate this matter.

249
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,200
Who is responsible for this, dear?

250
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:04,211
The editor is Mr Karamveer.

251
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,717
This is in answer to the ad we'd published.

252
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:12,212
- Yet I must thank him.
- Yes.

253
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:19,219
- But you must accompany me.
- l?

254
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,734
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

255
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,737
- Did anyone come asking for Mohan?
- No.

256
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:32,403
One man did call up saying
that he's found a dog.

257
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,746
And asked to check it.
If you want I can go.

258
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:40,744
Certainly and if needed
take my car also.

259
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,920
- Okay.
- Shall I too join you?

260
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:47,657
No need. If it is Mohan then
I'll call you up to come over.

261
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,753
I'll bring nice biscuits
for Mohan.

262
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,774
God willing the separated
will again be united.

263
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,679
- You?
- Yes. Greetings!

264
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,345
- I was going to your place.
- So you won't stop following me?

265
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,956
- You are mistaken.
- I am not.

266
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,282
Only time will prove that.
Can I help you?

267
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,528
- The ones who help are different.
- How are they?

268
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,460
Despite being strangers
they've published a headline.

269
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,637
- So you're going to thank him?
- Yes.

270
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,800
- You can thank me here itself.
- You?

271
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,309
- Yes.
- Take a good look at yourself.

272
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:47,648
I've taken a look at myself
in your beautiful eyes.

273
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:52,813
- The person you're going to meet,..
- I'll know on meeting him.

274
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,720
Let's go, mother.

275
00:29:56,361 --> 00:30:00,991
You want to know how could
I be so courageous?

276
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,567
For how long can you keep
the truth hidden?

277
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:11,570
I won't withdraw.Goodbye!

278
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:20,012
- What can I do for you?
- Are you Mr Karamveer?

279
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,845
- Yes.
- She's Smt Gangadevi.

280
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,351
It was her son about whom you
had published that headline.

281
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,592
Oh, so you are the one who had
announced a reward of Rs 10,000?

282
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,363
- Yes.
- We'll try our best,...

283
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:38,759
to awaken the public who'll appeal
to the government for justice.

284
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:45,866
- I'm grateful to you.
- Don't be grateful to me.

285
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:51,871
This is my reporter's doing and
I too am grateful to him.

286
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:57,044
By publishing this news
he's revived my paper.

287
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:58,889
Greetings, Mr Karamveer!

288
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:07,393
- Vikas, she's Mohan's mother.
- Greetings!

289
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:14,067
- Do you recognise me?
- Yes.

290
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:21,810
- Now you can thank me.
- Don't embarrass me further.

291
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,914
If you've any important information
you can contact me on this no.

292
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:35,415
And if you want to contact
me do so on 4004.

293
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,091
Thanks.
Mother, let's go.

294
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,963
What is the matter?

295
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,460
I'm speaking from Prakash's office.
What did you say?

296
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:27,467
The commissioner... with our editor.
Okay.

297
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,639
I know that you are childless.

298
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:37,477
And you pray fervently for a child.

299
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,153
Priest, please come in.

300
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,993
Please come in and be seated.

301
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:05,505
- This is my modest house.
- That was 10 years ago.

302
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,848
Now this is a mansion.

303
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,745
You are right. 10 years ago we
lived in a modest house.

304
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:35,035
10 years ago you were thinking
of the approaching diwali.

305
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,878
And that you don't have enough
money to celebrate it.

306
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,050
But you came into this house
precisely on diwali day.

307
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,881
You are right.

308
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,893
On the eve of diwali we had no money.

309
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,734
That night my husband got lot of
money and later bought this house.

310
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,571
He bought me jewellery. I wonder
how he came across so much money.

311
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:12,905
But your husband has earned
this money from unfair means.

312
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,086
- And that's the reason,...
- I'm childless?

313
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,752
Can you tell me the source
of his wealth?

314
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,096
I can but it will take time.

315
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,099
You'll have to perform a
prayer for that.

316
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:33,769
I'll do your bidding but please tell
me the source of his wealth.

317
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,937
You'll know everything when
the time is ripe.

318
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:49,781
- I must leave now.
- Priest, you forgot this.

319
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:56,016
- When will you come again?
- I can't confirm that.

320
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:02,125
- But yet wait for me. Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

321
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,644
He was omniscient.
He even told me my name.

322
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:14,978
He even told me that I'm childless.

323
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,148
He even told about our poverty 10
years ago and good fortune now.

324
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,979
I'd forbidden you from doing
idle talk with people.

325
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:27,818
- But this is not idle chatter.
- You are very naive.

326
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,333
Tell me how did you amass
all this wealth?

327
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,327
You should've asked the
priest about it.

328
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:44,668
- He said it.
- What did he say?

329
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,839
That you've earned this wealth
through unfair means.

330
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:55,681
- Did he really say that?
- What's happened to you?

331
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,067
In the evening when people
blew money on dancers,...

332
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:55,235
Shama would lock her doors and
would sing and wait for me.

333
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,979
I'm an ordinary man but yet
she preferred me to wealth.

334
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,987
So, how could
I've killed her?

335
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,762
Then do you suspect Banarasilal?

336
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,755
I don't know. The murder
took place at his house,...

337
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,759
but he was not present there.

338
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,268
- Why was Shama there?
- Banarasilal had invited her.

339
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,775
But she sent me a message asking
her to meet me there.

340
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:27,778
Through whom did she
send the message?

341
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,107
Through Bindiya who was her friend.

342
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,117
Bindiya was there but she testified
against me that I'd killed Shama.

343
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,448
- Where is Bindiya?
- I don't know.

344
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,190
People feel she's dead
but I don't think so.

345
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,129
- Who is this Charanjilal?
- I don't know anybody,....

346
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:51,029
not even my mother.

347
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,971
I only know Bindiya who was
present at that time.

348
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:00,807
When I left Shama in the room
I heard a gun shot.

349
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:08,809
And Shama's shrieks. Only Bindiya
knows about the gun shot,...

350
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:15,986
Or God knows. I only know
that I'm innocent.

351
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,829
Why didn't you say all this
in the court?

352
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:24,164
I did speak but the court
believes only in evidences.

353
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,496
I don't deny that the
court's decision is wrong.

354
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:32,832
Had I been in their shoes I too
would've made a similar decision.

355
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,346
I've nothing against the law
nor against the decision.

356
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,247
My grudge is only against Bindiya.

357
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,184
Bindiya, this is your way to take
revenge on me for spurning your love.

358
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,191
Bindiya, you'll pay for this.

359
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,210
Bindiya can solve this case.

360
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:16,546
Only Banarasilal knows if
she's alive or dead.

361
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,050
Please dial 3003.

362
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,053
Do it yourself as I'm scared.

363
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,407
- Who's that?
- I'm Mrs Lal speaking.

364
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:42,071
Greetings!
Please call Neelima.

365
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,576
- What did you say?
- This is regarding Mohan.

366
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,420
I've traced him and he's
here with me.

367
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,929
Okay, just hold on.

368
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,926
Mr Karamveer, please bark.

369
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,602
He's missing you.

370
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,345
This is my Mohan's voice.

371
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:23,442
- Please bring him on the line.
- Again? Okay.

372
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:35,321
Neelima, Mohan is found and
is talking to me.

373
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,468
- Neelima is here.
- You too hear him.

374
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:44,970
I'm Vikas here.
Come here immediately.

375
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,481
We won't come there.
You bring him here.

376
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,982
- Mr Karamveer, I'll have to go.
- Then go.

377
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,985
I'll be there with Mohan.

378
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,326
- Find a tailless dog.
- What?

379
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,529
You are very well
aware that,..

380
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:38,697
the headline given by you is a
challenge to the government.

381
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:46,547
Can I know on the basis of which
evidence you took this step?

382
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,449
- You speak.
- We've no such evidences.

383
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,882
But I met the criminal's
mother.

384
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,726
And she is sure of her
son's innocence.

385
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,560
My sympathies are with
Mohan's mother.

386
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,564
But being a government servant
I've other considerations also.

387
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,231
So you'll have to set
a time limit.

388
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,574
- Give us a month's time.
- Vikas, that's too little.

389
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:17,737
- Sir, give us a year's time.
- I'll give you 2 months time.

390
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,580
If you fail to prove
yourselves by then,....

391
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,414
then legal action will be
taken against you. Okay?

392
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,924
But that's too little.

393
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,586
He's immature and doesn't realise
the gravity of the situation.

394
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,923
I can't give you more time.
You can leave now.

395
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:39,599
- Let's leave, Mr Karamveer.
- Come.

396
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,945
I'm Karamveer, the editor.

397
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,282
If you won't discontinue
writing about Mohan,...

398
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,292
then we'll kill you.

399
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:13,966
What is the matter?

400
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,311
They've disconnected.
What is the matter?

401
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:27,306
- They've give a death threat.
- What?!

402
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,818
- That's great!
- What?

403
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,994
Didn't I tell you that once it gets
published all doors will open.

404
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:43,822
I'm scared and you are
worried about the case.

405
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,829
It's a matter of time when
we get Rs 1 0,000.

406
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,675
Mr Vikas, I feel this is a
waste of time.

407
00:46:56,547 --> 00:47:01,849
The case is old and the decision
made by the judge and jury,...

408
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:03,853
must've been made with
great thought.

409
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:09,848
That's fine but his mother is
confident of her son's innocence.

410
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,862
Every mother feels
similarly.

411
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:21,702
I felt the same but after meeting
his mother I was convinced otherwise.

412
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:27,374
- Here are the files.
- I want to go through them.

413
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,704
And I also want to find out who
were the witnesses against Mohan.

414
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,382
- Fine.
- Thanks.

415
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:42,382
- Sir, I think he's mad.
- We're concerned with our money.

416
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,393
I'll give you that
right away.

417
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,730
I wish we get such
threats daily.

418
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,568
I was with the lawyer going
through Mohan's files.

419
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,404
He's saying he was going
through the files.

420
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,414
- God bless him.
- Mother has blessed you.

421
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,749
- And you?
- Neelima, any news about Mohan?

422
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:15,414
- You didn't answer me.
- That's what I was discussing.

423
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:22,932
You didn't answer me.

424
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:29,428
Tell mother tomorrow I've find out
about Bindiya and Charanjilal.

425
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,939
First I'll go to hotel
Dilbahar

426
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,938
There's no need to go there
as I know its owner.

427
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,444
You must visit the names
you've mentioned.

428
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,121
- It's the dog's mistress.
- And remember,...

429
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,083
that Mohan's tail was cut.

430
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,856
- The murderer is someone else.
- Quite possible.

431
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:59,632
The judge and jury can
go wrong. Everything is possible.

432
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,470
This is what I'm
trying to prove.

433
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:03,806
May god help you.

434
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,976
- Let me know if you need my help.
- Certainly.

435
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,138
I can't resolve this
without your help.

436
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:17,814
- Who is Chiranjilal?
- Who Chiranjilal?

437
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,483
I don't know any Chiranjilal.

438
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:26,993
- And Bindiya?
- She was Shama's friend.

439
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:31,000
I've not seen her since
the case was over.

440
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,167
I'd heard that she had returned
to her native place.

441
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:37,833
And Shama's grief killed
her also.

442
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,845
- I'm sorry to take your time.
- It's okay.

443
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,864
Do you know anyone
called Chiranjilal?

444
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:14,203
Yes. 10 years ago he lived in this
chawl and in this very room.

445
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:20,877
- Where does he stay now?
- He stays in a bungalow now.

446
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:26,887
I think he's earned money
from gambling.

447
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,049
Overnight his fortunes changed
for the better.

448
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,897
It's a matter of luck.

449
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:43,062
I am Chiranjilal.
You go and perform your prayers.

450
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,905
I asked you to leave.

451
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:00,590
What is the matter?

452
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,926
I've got a headache since I've
come from the police station.

453
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,594
Remove this.
- Why?

454
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,430
- We've made it.
- Well done!

455
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,092
- Who's the culprit?
- It's too early to say that.

456
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,933
- Then what is it?
- I met Charanjilal today.

457
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,607
On hearing my first question
he went pale.

458
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:22,100
10 years ago he was an ordinary
man but today he's a rich man.

459
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,114
- I'll inform the commissioner.
- Not now.

460
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:29,277
- Why?
- We've to find how he grew rich.

461
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,953
- But how will we know that?
- That's my worry too.

462
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,956
- We can know from his wife.
- Then go and meet her.

463
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,966
How do I meet her?

464
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:55,133
- His wife is very religious.
- So?

465
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,156
- You'll have to do something.
- What is it?

466
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,659
- Publish a headline.
- What?

467
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,325
That how did Chiranjilal
amass so much wealth?

468
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:16,154
- No.
- No?

469
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:52,023
- I'm doing my prayers.
- You are only doing prayers.

470
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,934
- Come here.
- What is it?

471
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:02,702
Don't talk much with
strangers.

472
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,274
- But, Madame,..
- I don't want to hear a word more.

473
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,942
So you want to place an ad
for an old woman,...

474
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,456
who can take care of
your bird sanctuary?

475
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:11,119
- Yes.
- I know of someone.

476
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:15,624
My reporter Vikas has gone
to find her a job.

477
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,297
- Please take a seat.
- Thankyou!

478
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:24,136
Mother, he's dumb.
I hardly sit at the shop.

479
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,972
He takes care and
he's mute.

480
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:33,972
- Take care of him also.
- Pay her for that as well.

481
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:40,650
All this is hers now and he too
is like a little bird.

482
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:45,218
So it'll be generous of her to take
care of him who is a mute.

483
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,005
- Goodbye, mother!
- Goodbye!

484
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:02,500
I too shall leave. Let's see what
happens at hotel Gul Bahar.

485
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:10,344
- Son, take care.
- Don't worry. Come, Neelima.

486
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:34,373
I'm Papa Khan and she's
Madame Bilbilan.

487
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:41,050
I'm a world renowned
magician.

488
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:44,382
But who's the magician?
You or Madame?

489
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:48,285
- I'm the magician.
- I thought it is her.

490
00:58:54,097 --> 00:59:00,058
Her magic works on the heart while
my magic works on the mind.

491
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:03,071
We've heard about a grand
celebration at your hotel,...

492
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,734
so we want to perform.

493
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,748
- What are your rates?
- We'll discuss that later.

494
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,414
- First you must see our tricks.
- Fine.

495
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:20,083
If you can make our patrons happy
we'll make you happy.

496
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:21,757
Okay.

497
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:27,085
How can I please you when
you'd hurt my beloved?

498
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:33,433
- What did I do?
- You pocketed her kerchief.

499
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,435
I pocketed her kerchief!

500
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:45,603
Wonderful!

501
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,617
- What if I don't return?
- No problem.

502
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,781
- We'll make preparations.
- Fine.

503
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,454
Come, Madame Bilbilan.

504
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,478
Amazing!

505
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,628
I think this is also one
of your tricks.

506
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,405
You've a good sense of
humour, Mr Papa Khan.

507
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:45,403
- Let's leave now.
- Madame wants to leave.

508
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,416
I won't let you leave.

509
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,915
You'll have to perform
here every week.

510
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,084
And I've made arrangements
for your stay also.

511
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,090
- Let's go, Madame.
- Okay, Papa Khan.

512
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:09,764
This is the drawing hall.

513
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,938
This is also converted
as a dancing hall.

514
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,123
He's trying to say
something.

515
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:47,806
- What is this parrot saying?
- Nothing, he only blabbers.

516
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:52,140
- Madame, he's only blabbering.
- Oh!

517
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:58,476
- Take a look at your bedrooms now.
- Madame, please come.

518
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,495
He's our new guest so
take proper care of them.

519
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:10,495
- Fine.
- Follow me.

520
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:28,506
Madame, this is your room and
Papa Khan, that is your room.

521
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:33,852
Did you like the place?

522
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,189
I'll take your leave now.

523
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:48,033
Madame, shake hands and
wish him good-night.

524
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:19,796
That chandelier was
deliberately dropped on us.

525
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,798
But why?

526
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:29,909
To kill us because they know
our true identity.

527
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:35,243
- But how did they know?
- I too can't understand that.

528
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,579
Only Karamveer and mother
knew about it.

529
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:48,819
Anyway, take care as l
worry for you.

530
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:50,826
- You worry for me?
- Yes.

531
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:56,764
- Why?
- What if something happens to you.

532
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,599
- So what?
- Then what'll happen to me?

533
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:53,390
This parrot incessantly mentions
Bindiya's name.

534
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,127
Bindiya must be in some way
connected with this house.

535
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,067
Now it's clear that
Banarasi,...

536
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:07,410
Excuse me for being romantic
with Madame Bilbilan.

537
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,581
- I want to seek your permission.
- For what?

538
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:18,250
I want to take her out.

539
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:22,931
Certainly but be punctual
for the show.

540
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:30,594
- Sir, your cigarette holder.
- My cigarette holder?

541
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,451
- Greetings, mother.
- You've come?

542
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:49,947
I was worried for you both.
Your editor friend had come.

543
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:52,953
- He's my boss not my friend.
- He looked tensed.

544
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,295
He's gone to the police station
and asked you also to join him.

545
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,195
So you must leave.
Neelima will be here with me.

546
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,301
Before I leave I'll leave
some job for you to do.

547
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,974
What is it?

548
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:07,100
We'll prove Mohan's innocence.

549
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:15,308
Mr Karamveer, I heard everything.
I'm sorry but he's hard of hearing.

550
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:22,150
You're on time, Vikas.
The date is fixed for the 1 1th.

551
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,652
And the case will be re-opened
in the court on that day.

552
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:30,124
And if you fail to prove your case,
this case shall be closed forever.

553
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:35,231
Commissioner, I'm confident in
collecting all evidences by then.

554
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,998
Well done, son!

555
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:43,235
I'm again reminding you
about the date.

556
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,338
I'll leave now.

557
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:12,031
- The parrot is missing.
- This is a ploy.

558
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:23,718
- Sir, the food is ready.
- Is it?

559
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:30,050
We won't eat. You can relax.
Come, Madame.

560
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,567
Vikas, I'm scared.

561
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:52,580
How did the parrot die all
of a sudden?

562
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:56,413
- He was fine in the morning.
- I too am thinking the same.

563
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,754
Even our behaviour couldn't
have raised any doubts.

564
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,485
- We didn't even utter her name.
- Then?

565
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:10,087
Our coming here in disguise, the
parrot blabbering Bindiya's name,...

566
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,767
all this we'd confided
only in mother.

567
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,433
- Perhaps there,...
- You're right, Neelima.

568
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:23,438
That's where we had mentioned her
name. Perhaps that man is not mute.

569
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,444
- And perhaps he's their spy.
- Right.

570
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:30,342
- We must be careful of him.
- And must guard our tongue.

571
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,510
Your life is in danger.
We must leave immediately.

572
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:38,679
No. I'll see my
mission to its end.

573
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,197
What happened?

574
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:53,195
Last night on returning from the
show, I found the parrot dead.

575
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:57,432
I too noticed it now.
But he was old and got freedom.

576
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:02,537
Everything else is fine?
- I too escaped death.

577
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:07,204
I saw a cobra on my bed.

578
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:13,548
He'as about to strike me but Madame
Bilbilan saw him and saved my life.

579
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,551
Don't worry, as this is a forest
area he must've just come.

580
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,219
But we must celebrate your
escape from death.

581
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:28,566
And also a dance from
Madame Bilbilan.

582
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:34,238
But promise me that there'll
be no more snakes.

583
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,745
I'll ask Peshori to be
more cautious.

584
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:05,783
Neelima, you were simply great.

585
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,122
- You too were nothing less.
- l?

586
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:14,792
- I was actually drinking.
- All lies.

587
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,963
No, I was drunk on
your beauty.

588
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,629
Stop this poetry and confide
in me tonight's plan.

589
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,473
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

590
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:30,818
- That's that! Where is Bindiya?
- I don't know.

591
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:32,159
You know it.

592
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:39,326
- Where is Bindiya?
- I'll tell you.

593
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:47,664
After Mohan was framed Bindiya
was handed over to Shamsher.

594
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,769
Shamsher took her away and since
then we haven't heard about her.

595
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:52,171
- Who is Shamsher?
- I don't know.

596
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:53,908
- Where does he stay?
- I don't know,...

597
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,843
so how can I tell you.
Now leave me.

598
01:25:58,219 --> 01:26:03,680
If the boss comes to know that I've
disclosed this to you he'll kill me.

599
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:06,193
Please spare me.

600
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:12,026
- If you act smart I'll kill you.
- I won't act smart.

601
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,039
- Any news?
- I've traced Bindiya.

602
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:24,879
- But it's not definite.
- What do you mean?

603
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:26,713
Bindiya was handed over
to Shamsher.

604
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:30,217
- Now?
- We've to trace Shamshersingh now.

605
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:34,719
How will we do it?
We've only 2 more days.

606
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,885
But we've to do something.
We must leave immediately.

607
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:06,243
Tomorrow is the case, son.
Now what will happen?

608
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:10,925
Even this parrot doesn't
parrot Bindiya's name.

609
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:19,266
It's okay, mother.
We've succeeded in tracing Bindiya.

610
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,765
- Really?
- If we can trace Shamsher,...

611
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,771
- we can find her too.
- But we haven't found Shamsher.

612
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:30,938
You're not aware of it. I'll
be meeting him at 7 in the evening.

613
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:36,280
Mother, we'll meet in court tomorrow
and I'll prove Mohan's innocence.

614
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:38,945
- So, don't worry.
- God bless you.

615
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:40,454
Come, Neelima.

616
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,793
- What did you say?
- Yes,..

617
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:49,023
today at 7 in the evening Vikas
will be meeting Shamsher.

618
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:53,130
- How did he get his address?
- I don't know that.

619
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,867
Shamsher, I want to know if you
really had killed Bindiya?

620
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:14,871
Why are you staring at me?
Answer me.

621
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,544
Your silence is dangerous.

622
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:23,888
Don't you trust me?

623
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:32,055
Now I no longer trust
anyone not even myself.

624
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:41,239
You don't trust me?
Get out of here.

625
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:43,236
I don't want to hear
a word.

626
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:51,909
I killed that innocent girl on your
bidding and have guarded your secret.

627
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,080
And you don't trust me.

628
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:57,083
You are unnecessarily
getting upset.

629
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,427
Some people feel that Bindiya
is still alive.

630
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:04,260
And they have your address
and can come here anytime.

631
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:07,434
Let them come,
I know to deal with them.

632
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:10,938
Well done!

633
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,958
Who are you?
Have you lost your way?

634
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,972
No, I've reached my destination.

635
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:51,308
- What can I do for you?
- Are you Shamsher singh?

636
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:56,313
- Yes; what can I do for you?
- I want to ask you something.

637
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,482
- About whom?
- About Bindiya.

638
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:05,481
You know the purpose of my visit.
Banarasilal paid you a visit now.

639
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:12,227
- Where is Bindiya?
- I can't disclose.

640
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:17,403
Why did Banarasilal hand
over Bindiya to you?

641
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:20,507
- To kill her.
- And did you?

642
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:24,500
- I killed her.
- Did she tell you anything?

643
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:32,016
She did try to say
something.

644
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:34,521
But the greed for money
drove me crazy.

645
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:37,024
And I killed that
innocent girl.

646
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:54,371
- Who's that?
- There's a rumor that ghosts exist.

647
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:56,210
And that he sometimes shrieks.

648
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:03,050
Come, Neelima.

649
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:28,405
- What was that?
- Ghosts.

650
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:15,281
Neelima, wait here for me.
And don't get scared.

651
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:46,025
- Don't you utter a word more.
- You are feeling remorse.

652
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:56,892
Kill me.

653
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:03,577
Get lost!

654
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:18,414
- Kill me.
- Your manner held me back then.

655
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:24,590
And even now though my hand
is shaking my mind is not.

656
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:28,594
- Then finish the story.
- That's the tragedy,...

657
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:35,431
that I can't kill my
beloved with my own hands.

658
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:48,945
10 years ago I fell in
love with you.

659
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:54,449
And since then I've risked my
life to keep you alive.

660
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:58,124
Only because I love you.

661
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:04,460
But now I must kill you as the
truth can't be kept hidden for long.

662
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:09,973
Leave her.

663
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:17,981
Surrender your knife.

664
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:52,906
Please don't get scared of
me and release me.

665
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:02,577
Release me.

666
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:18,599
They've taken everything from me.
I won't spare those rogues.

667
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,604
Now Bindiya can't go anywhere.

668
01:41:29,983 --> 01:41:31,951
- What is this you're doing?
- What I ought to be doing.

669
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:34,780
Your companion has gone
with Bindiya.

670
01:41:35,656 --> 01:41:37,783
You can't leave until she returns.

671
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:41,954
- Is she alive?
- Yes.

672
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:48,627
Scream louder.

673
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:53,799
- I'll be back soon.
- Scream louder.

674
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:59,137
Louder!

675
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:04,640
Vikas, you leave as we are
hard pressed for time.

676
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:11,655
Today is the case hearing. Remember
that song that we'll meet again.

677
01:42:15,195 --> 01:42:18,323
Shamsher singh, I'll kill you.

678
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:22,836
You've only two options now.

679
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:26,673
Either Bindiya or this beautiful
girl stays with me.

680
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:31,007
- I accept your condition.
- Neelima, what are you saying?

681
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:37,339
Vikas, I know that you love me
and so are sacrificing your duty.

682
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,678
I too reciprocate your love and
can sacrifice my life for you.

683
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:45,358
Shamsher, the deal is struck.

684
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:48,862
Let Bindiya go with Vikas,
I'll stay here with you.

685
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:52,358
What will I tell Banarasilal?

686
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:55,360
Once Bindiya reaches court that
matter will settle.

687
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:59,103
He'll be arrested and
you'll be free.

688
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:15,221
- So, Mr Karamveer,..
- Address me as Shri Karamveer.

689
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:21,383
You claim that the culprit
Mohanlal is innocent.

690
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:24,727
This is my reporter Vikas'
claim not mine.

691
01:43:24,998 --> 01:43:29,958
But you've printed it in your paper
and have challenged to prove it also.

692
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:31,396
I still maintain that.

693
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:35,397
It means 10 years ago the court
made a wrong decision.

694
01:43:36,009 --> 01:43:41,242
By doing so you've challenged the
court that 10 years ago it was blind.

695
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:46,913
The truth was hidden from
the court then.

696
01:43:47,955 --> 01:43:50,253
Permit me to present a
key eye-witness.

697
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:52,258
Shama was my well-wisher and
true friend.

698
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:56,421
She loved Mohan immensely.

699
01:43:57,965 --> 01:44:01,765
The day she was killed that day
at Banarasilal's bungalow,...

700
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:05,766
at around 6.25 she and Mohan,...

701
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,100
It's 6.30 now. Banarasilal will be
coming so you must leave now.

702
01:44:11,311 --> 01:44:14,280
- How long will this go on?
- It's a matter of a few days more.

703
01:44:15,315 --> 01:44:18,773
I'll leave Banarasilal to
be with you.

704
01:44:20,988 --> 01:44:27,120
- Shama, I can't live without you.
- Nor can l.

705
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:34,289
- But now you must leave.
- Okay.

706
01:44:56,356 --> 01:45:00,816
Keep shut or you'll meet the
same fate as Shama.

707
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:08,324
Mohan is the murderer
not l. Understand?

708
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:11,504
10 years ago you said that Mohan
was the murderer.

709
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,337
- Yes.
- So you had lied?

710
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:16,843
Yes.

711
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:18,841
Also that you were
kidnapped to be killed?

712
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:21,510
- Yes.
- But you are alive.

713
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:26,019
- So you had lied?
- No.

714
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:29,852
He didn't kill me but
kept me captive.

715
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:35,020
- Why?
- He was in love with me.

716
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:43,526
- How did you suddenly become rich?
- Laxmi favoured me.

717
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:49,034
- You mean your wife?
- No, I mean Goddess Laxmi.

718
01:45:49,409 --> 01:45:54,108
- You mean luck favoured you?
- You can say so.

719
01:45:54,581 --> 01:45:57,550
- Did you find some hidden wealth?
- No.

720
01:45:58,151 --> 01:46:02,053
- Then?
- I gambled on horses.

721
01:46:03,924 --> 01:46:07,223
Mr Banarasilal, you've been
accused of murdering Shama.

722
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:10,226
As per the statement given by
Bindiya and other witnesses,...

723
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:13,228
the murder took place at 6.30
in the evening.

724
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:16,067
Were you present there when
the murder took place?

725
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:17,904
- No.
- Then where were you?

726
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:21,908
I was at the club playing
cards with my friends.

727
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:24,910
- You remember their names?
- Yes.

728
01:46:25,946 --> 01:46:31,407
It means at 6.30 you were
playing cards?

729
01:46:40,961 --> 01:46:45,921
Doctor, where was Banarasilal
when Shama was murdered?

730
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:47,933
He was with us playing cards.

731
01:46:48,468 --> 01:46:50,095
- Are you sure?
- Certainly.

732
01:46:51,138 --> 01:46:55,268
- Who else was with you at the club?
- Dr. Dinanath,...

733
01:46:55,976 --> 01:46:57,944
Mr. Khanna and Mr Banarasilal
were with me.

734
01:46:58,712 --> 01:47:03,274
Are you sure that Banarasilal was
with you till 6.30 in the evening?

735
01:47:03,984 --> 01:47:04,951
- Yes.
- Are you certain?

736
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:06,344
- Yes.
- That's all.

737
01:47:07,654 --> 01:47:11,283
Was it 6.30 when you were playing
cards with Banarasilal?

738
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:12,955
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

739
01:47:13,326 --> 01:47:14,554
- Very much.
- That's all, your honour.

740
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:23,466
Banarasilal was at the
club at 6.30.

741
01:47:25,238 --> 01:47:29,470
And Shama was also killed at 6.30.
How is that possible?

742
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:35,311
This is intriguing
Bindiya, shed some light on this.

743
01:47:36,183 --> 01:47:40,984
I'm sure you know it.
We've made a mistake somewhere.

744
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:45,386
Bindiya, think it over
carefully and say,...

745
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:47,993
for how many days were
you at Banarasilal's place?

746
01:47:49,696 --> 01:47:52,324
Shama and I were
there since 15 days.

747
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:57,162
What was he doing on the day
this incident occurred?

748
01:47:58,038 --> 01:48:03,169
I'm sure Mohan is the culprit.

749
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:06,012
Mr Karamveer, keep shut and
go and sit there.

750
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:11,346
So, Bindiya, what did he do
the entire day?

751
01:48:14,554 --> 01:48:18,513
As usual he had his morning
tea, then came home for lunch.

752
01:48:20,227 --> 01:48:24,357
He seemed pleased at lunch but
was tensed in the morning.

753
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:26,532
Perhaps he was upset in
the morning,...

754
01:48:28,068 --> 01:48:31,697
Because he knew that while
he's at the club,...

755
01:48:33,073 --> 01:48:35,268
- Mohan would come to meet Shama. - Then?

756
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:43,209
After lunch he'd walk in his room
and before leaving for the club,...

757
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:46,211
Perhaps he was aware that Mohan
discreetly met Shama.

758
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:51,222
While he was upset did you find any
noticeable traits about him?

759
01:48:52,092 --> 01:48:54,219
I saw him rectifying the
watch in the hall.

760
01:48:55,262 --> 01:48:58,060
- What time would Mohan come?
- At 6.00.

761
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:04,400
You said that Banarasilal was
with you at 6.30?

762
01:49:05,105 --> 01:49:06,732
- Yes
- Can you say,...

763
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:10,400
if he left for a while
at around 6.05 or 6.10?

764
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:16,078
Yes, I do think he did leave at
around that time for a while.

765
01:49:16,616 --> 01:49:23,078
- Do you think or are you sure?
- I'm sure.

766
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:28,424
But at 6.30 when the murder took
place he was playing cards with us.

767
01:49:29,462 --> 01:49:34,422
- How far's his house from the club?
- Around 5 mins.

768
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:40,505
Mr Khanna, I agree that at 6.30
he was playing cards with you.

769
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:46,101
Did he leave for a while at
around 6.05 or 6.10?

770
01:49:47,647 --> 01:49:50,275
- Yes.
- That's all.

771
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:53,779
Did he leave for a while
at 6.05 or 6.10?

772
01:49:54,387 --> 01:49:56,617
- I think he did go.
- Aren't you sure?

773
01:49:57,324 --> 01:49:58,450
I'm sure.

774
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:00,524
Mr Banarasilal, on the day
of the murder,...

775
01:50:01,494 --> 01:50:05,453
at 6.30 you were at the club playing
cards with your friends.

776
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:09,362
You went out for a while at
around 6.05 or 6.10?

777
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:13,799
- I can't re-collect.
- Try to re-collect.

778
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:17,467
- I think I did go.
- Where did you go?

779
01:50:19,179 --> 01:50:21,545
- I don't remember.
- Think as it is crucial.

780
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:28,481
I think I went to have tea.
I can't re-collect.

781
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:30,652
- Perhaps you went home?
- No!

782
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:32,385
I remember vividly
that I didn't go home.

783
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:36,488
You claimed not to
remember anything.

784
01:50:37,197 --> 01:50:38,494
Then how did you remember that
you hadn't gone home?

785
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:45,828
- How far's your house from the club?
- About 4-5 mins.

786
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:52,406
Can I go to your house and return
to the club within 10 mins?

787
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:56,842
I fail to comprehend this.

788
01:50:57,217 --> 01:50:59,685
I want to know if I can return
within 10 mins or no?

789
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:04,189
Yes.

790
01:51:05,725 --> 01:51:08,523
How did your husband
become so rich?

791
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:11,193
I don't know.
Ask him only.

792
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:15,690
- Did you husband indulge in racing?
- Never.

793
01:51:17,237 --> 01:51:21,537
- Where did you bet on the horses?
- Naturally at the race-course.

794
01:51:22,242 --> 01:51:25,541
- I mean in which city?
- At Lucknow.

795
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:27,709
My Lord, he's lying.

796
01:51:28,415 --> 01:51:30,212
Because there was no racing at
Lucknow in those days.

797
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:33,218
- Did you really do racing?
- No.

798
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:34,553
- Did you steal?
- No.

799
01:51:35,255 --> 01:51:43,458
Then how did you become so rich?
It's a question of an innocent life.

800
01:51:44,264 --> 01:51:46,232
- Banarasilal gave it to me.
- Why?

801
01:51:47,767 --> 01:51:50,235
My lord, on the day of
the murder,...

802
01:51:51,271 --> 01:51:57,403
at around 6.10 or 6.15, I was
walking past Banarasilal's bungalow.

803
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:01,742
Suddenly I heard a gun shot
from the bungalow.

804
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:03,749
I failed to understand
anything.

805
01:52:04,617 --> 01:52:09,247
After a while I saw Banarasilal
running out of the house.

806
01:52:09,956 --> 01:52:11,423
In panic he banged
against me.

807
01:52:12,525 --> 01:52:16,586
He took an assurance from me
that if I kept shut,...

808
01:52:17,297 --> 01:52:22,257
and helped him he'd
make me rich.

809
01:52:23,303 --> 01:52:28,764
And so, the day Mohan was
arrested he made me rich.

810
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:32,278
My lord and the jury members,...

811
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,778
I'll remind you Bindiya's statement.

812
01:52:37,317 --> 01:52:42,448
She said Banarasilal was repairing
his residence watch.

813
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:50,291
He was actually making the watch
run fast by 15-20 mins.

814
01:52:51,664 --> 01:52:53,791
So that when his residence
watch shows 6.30,...

815
01:52:54,667 --> 01:53:00,799
the actual time would be
6.15 or 6.20.

816
01:53:01,841 --> 01:53:06,471
So he could claim that at 6.30
when the murder took place,...

817
01:53:06,846 --> 01:53:09,815
he was at the club with his
friends playing cards.

818
01:53:11,351 --> 01:53:16,653
Banarasilal is the murderer and the
murder took place at around 6.15.

819
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:22,487
Members of the jury,
give us your verdict.

820
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:48,009
My and the jury member's
verdict is that,...

821
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:51,852
Mohanlal is innocent.
And Banarasilal,...

822
01:53:56,896 --> 01:53:59,524
should be punished for making
Chiranjilal make a false statement.

823
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,868
And the police should properly
investigate this case.

824
01:54:32,665 --> 01:54:37,398
Son, didn't I tell you that you're
innocent and will be acquitted?

825
01:54:45,945 --> 01:54:49,073
I'm sorry,
please forgive me, Mohan.
