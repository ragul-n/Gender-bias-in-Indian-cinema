1
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,183
GODAVARI

2
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:56,085
Godavari is Iike a sea.
Everybody IoudIy haiI Lord Ram!

3
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,284
Since hundreds of years,
the marriage of Sita and Rama has. . ..

4
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,120
. . .been performed in BhadrachaIam.

5
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,230
Among aII the Ram tempIes
BhadrachaIam has some speciaIty

6
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,165
Because the Iegend has it that,
Sita and Ram spent their time. . .

7
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,430
. . .in Papi hiIIs and surrounding
woods when they were in exiIe

8
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,504
Now we are traveIing there.

9
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:20,678
To ensure our journey
caIm, joyfuI and pIeasurabIe. . .

10
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,883
. . .everybody haiI Lord Ram once more!
HAIL LORD RAM!

11
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:30,588
Why are we coming to BhadrachaIam
to see the HoIy wedding of Sita and Ram?

12
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,988
So that my girI's marriage
wouId get fixed quickIy

13
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:40,530
-What eIse? -To get
transferred to the city.

14
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,667
Have anybody endured the
sufferings Iike Sita and Ram?

15
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,804
Has Ram enjoyed
the royaI Iuxuries ever?

16
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,839
Has any other Goddess faced
the troubIes Iike Sita?

17
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,605
Then why we pray them
to reIieve our troubIes?

18
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,012
Because. . . the moraI of
the Ram's story says that. . .

19
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,688
. . .its not that there shouId be
onIy happiness and not hardships

20
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,525
Whatever the hardships we face
we need to have a companion

21
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,284
Just Iike Sita to Ram
and Ram to Sita.

22
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,521
We shouId face the hardships happiIy. . .

23
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,360
. . .and Iead an ideaI Iife

24
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,870
Now Captain Chinthamani foIIows. . .

25
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:34,049
Are you the full moon
or a sweet dream?

26
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,049
One moment,
shaII we taIk for sometime?

27
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,391
I want to teII a few things to you.

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,549
What?
Any Iove affair?

29
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,527
No, I and my younger sister
are everything for my dad

30
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,892
So shouId I conduct
your sister's marriage?

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,331
No. Though we are girIs,
but our dad brought us up weII. . .

32
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,075
. . .giving us education,
job, seIf confidence and everything

33
00:02:56,242 --> 00:03:01,009
So what? -So I want to be
cIose to them even after marriage

34
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,239
Do you want me to stay in your home?

35
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,940
-No, I mean cIose to home
-Ok, you can. No probIem.

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,087
-I want to Iook after them weII
-Take care. Who prevents?

37
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,290
Do they have any heaIth probIems?

38
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,590
PIease Iisten to me.

39
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,031
-Ok, Iet us see
-Don't say aII these to dad..

40
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,139
Let us think of it Iater.
Why do you dodge?

41
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,042
Come on.
Leave me pIease.

42
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,473
Oh gosh! It's onIy a dream!

43
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,572
It's aIready dawn for her!

44
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,781
Are you reading or shouting?

45
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:40,942
ShouId I sIeep or not?

46
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,449
Mom, sister says that I shouIdn't read.

47
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:49,189
Sita, have you aIready got up?
No, mom, not yet

48
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,125
I am just, waIking. That's aII.

49
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,991
Don't act. Take out the vehicIe.
Let us go to tempIe.

50
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,968
Mom, pIease Ieave me today at Ieast.

51
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,997
Aren't you ashamed?
DaiIy, your father drops me.

52
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,808
At Ieast Iet him sIeep today

53
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,811
Sita, get up.
Go take the bath.

54
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,985
She said bath then says that
it's a Dhanurmasam(TeIugu month)

55
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,482
She wiII say siIk skirt and haIf sari

56
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,686
Its aIready coId.
I can't, it's dangerous.

57
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,823
Must escape!

58
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,923
Mom, I won't take you
if you ask me to take bath etc.,

59
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,659
I woke up earIy in the
morning for the sake of dad

60
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,669
But you are Iaying ruIes!

61
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,036
TeII me, do you want Iift or not?

62
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,635
Sita, today is 1st
Do you know that?

63
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,176
You may have some needs, think about it?

64
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,909
Damn it! DeviI!

65
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,076
Move on.

66
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,860
Be modest!

67
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,029
Mom, wiII you give me Rs.4000?

68
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,425
4000? Why do you
bother about business?

69
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,191
Why don't you marry?

70
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,895
If I ask money, you starts a Iesson.
This is too much, mom.

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,704
One fine day my coIIection

72
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,870
Then I wiII teII you.
-Ok, I wiII give.

76

No need. It's too much.

77
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,221
Rs.3000 for Lakshmi,
Rs.1000 for gateman and . . .

78
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,885
. . .Rs.12000 rent for the shop
Give me that much. That is enough, ok!

79
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,735
I did my Engineering in Kakinada.

80
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,973
And did my MS in US.
In our America?

81
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,075
Sir, I need an appointment with CM.
-Why an appointment?

82
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,266

Its not Iike that, brother
You need an appointment, I understood.

00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,617
But, I don't know how to start.

89
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,757
My idea is to join any party.

90
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,821
That's why I want to taIk to CM

91
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,964
You are Iooking funny.

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,461
Are aII these certificates true?

93
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,664
After studying so much,
you wish to join poIitics..

94
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,066

95
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,435

Do you know to shout Iouder?

98

Can you haiI the Ieader IoudIy?

99
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,747
You have to behave Iike a

100
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:31,116
ShouId organize strikes and bundhs,

00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,289
Give two cup of tea.

I don't do aII these things
Why you make fun of yourseIf?

105
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,793
How can you join the party without knowing

106
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,969
TeII me, how much

Go. Have you informed your parents?

00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,535
Why don't you do software job?

Do you need 200?

If you taIk to the

The probIem is onIy
with the new commissioner

165
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,103
Ramu, come here.

166
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,342
-He is Ramu, my nephew
-Cousin to Raji.

167
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,716
-Let's go
-We wiII meet again.

168
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,601
How was your meeting?

169
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,131
AIright, they've asked me
to come after 2 months.

170
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,937
Where do you want me to join?
I wiII teII you when they caII

171
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,140
Why did you throw my doII in a corner?

172
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,808
I thought they may enter the
room suddenIy, so I kept aside

173
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,142
I haven't thrown it, dear.

174
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,724
That's true some Iikings
do keep changing with time.

175
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,392
StiII this is my favorite. Give it

176
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,054
You need not feeI that much.

177
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,361
You are. . .!

178
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,570
How is the hero?
Have you seen him?

179
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,732
How is he?
AIright!

180
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,908
Did you Iike him?
Father Iiked him very much.

181
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,182
Did you Iike him?
Ignore it. He has come just now.

182
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,177
I don't know.
I don't feeI anything

183
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,253
Why are you tensed?

184
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,060
Did you give the ceII number?

185
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,530
ShaII we have tea?
Now? I don't have mood.

186
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,267
I too don't have mood, that's why I asked

187
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,111
I'II change the dress
and come in 2 minutes. You go.

188
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,456
Did you Iike me, Madam?

189
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,161
Let me see, Mister!

190
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,297
What do your grandma says?
She didn't come to function!

191
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,169
It wiII cause anger.
Ravindra is an I.P.S.recruited

192
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,241
He is a nice boy. Nice famiIy.

193
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,577
They are of Kommireddy Iineage
They are affIuent

194
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,646
TeII her not to see me as a viIIain.

195
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,779
I am not forcing anything
without her Iiking

196
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,649
You don't force.
But, you do taIk against me.

197
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,811
You hurt her feeIing

198
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,819
Isn't it a father's duty to get her
daughter married to a right person?

199
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:39,922
How much needed, uncIe?

200
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,120
How much needed to
Iook after your daughter weII?

201
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,320
Did you ask what needed?
ShouId have a good job.

202
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,459
ShouId have infIuence in the society.

203
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,857
ShouId have property

204
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,834
What do you have actuaIIy?

205
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,936
I never saw such a
confused person Iike you tiII today

206
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,166
You are just Iike your father

207
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,943
If you have money,
you start donating it

208
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,446
Come, Raji
Do you've at Ieast a Iakh bank baIance?

209
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,480
Wait a minute.

210
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,683
See uncIe, you shouId see for
bank baIance from one who doesn't earn

211
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,556
I don't mind it

212
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,024
If needed, I wiII earn
one Iakh rupees now.

213
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,854
WiII you give Raji's hand to me?

214
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,032
Don't taIk Iike a mad. Go away

215
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,691
Dear, come on.

216
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,700
Mom, we wiII go out and come.

217
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,569
What is it, dear?

218
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,372
You want to Iook after her weII.

219
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,210
But, I say I wiII Iook after
her Iike the fIower

220
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,212
First bring her home safeIy.
We wiII be happy.

221
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,216
Why are you so angry?

222
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,486
Ignore about your dad
Don't you Iike me?

223
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,588
Then how did you agree to see the groom?

224
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,597
Do you Iike me?

225
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,396
Have you Iiked him?

226
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,601
I don't know. It's ok because
I got used to it from the chiIdhood

227
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,472
But I am aIways confused in this matter

228
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,078
That means, you don't Iike me!

229
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,682
You wouId never see me Iike a girI.

230
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,286
Does anybody bring a girI to such cafe?

231
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,019
TeII me.

232
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,423
The tea wiII be nice here. That's why.

233
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,923
If you asked, I wouId've taken
you to a star hoteI instead!

234
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,289
You don't understand tiII I say.

235
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,929
That worries me.

236
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,230
There is no VaIentines day,
no greeting card.

237
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,301
AIways dirty poIitics.

238
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,431
You aIways bIabber
about serving the Nation.

239
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,174
Or you roam saying about music programs

240
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,036
Everybody says poIitics is dirty

241
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,037
But we have the
responsibiIity to cIean it

242
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,505
I wiII do something
for this country on some day.

243
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,507
Keep watching
It's aII Iike the cinema diaIogues!

244
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,650
You don't say one usefuI thing.
That's why father doubts you.

245
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,618
Come, Iet us go.

246
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,324
See, I am a girI! But it doesn't
occurs you to take bags from me

247
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,466
WiII you do it, if I say this too?
Not needed.

248
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,295
Come on

249
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,739
-Raji, what is that message
in the morning? -I won't say.

250
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,869
Is it a secret?
I won't say.

251
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,407
-TeII me. - If you force,
I'II get down from the vehicIe.

252
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,674
Ok, Ieave aII that. ShaII we
go some where and get married?

253
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,744
Aren't you ashamed to taIk Iike that?

254
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:30,358
Be carefuI. -What happened?
It seems petroI is over.

255
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,769
Don't caII the driver.
We wiII go in an auto.

256
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,368
Your father wiII think that
I haven't taken care of you weII

257
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,576
This is my doubt. If I be with you,
you don't want my dad's earnings

258
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,779
And you don't earn either.

259
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,342
I wiII earn and show. Just for you.

260
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,014
What did you say?
Nothing.

261
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,758
Not this, not that
Everyday is yours!

262
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,498
Like a tide that fall and rise
You are the right choice.

263
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,565
Your country's order is for you!

264
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,235
Get spirited to open the war cry!

265
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,236
You are the 'Today and Tomorrow'!

266
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:58,576
Oh mind, the victory is yours!

267
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,920
Like a real human fill
the world with brilliance!

268
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,189
Among the stars bright
in the streams of light

269
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,360
lf there is a will there is a way!

270
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,290
Know it now!

271
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,734
The aimless arrow will not...

272
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,502
...reach any target, you know!

273
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,139
Everyday is a lesson for you!

274
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,977
Keep reading while on the move!

275
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,845
But, if you cheat yourself then...

276
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,846
...everything will be waste!

277
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,506
With spring, all the branches...

278
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,716
...will be like singing larks!

279
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,650
lf the lady advances for you
Then it'll be evergreen love!

280
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:28,325
Even the God became
Rama only for love!

281
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:35,802
Every life is filled with
puppetry of light and shade!

282
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,095
He is shaking hand deceitfuIIy!

283
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,277
May be tonight!

284
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,345
How come this bIood?
Mom!

285
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:49,811
I've been observing since you came.

286
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,012
You are duII
What happened to you?

287
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,476
Mom, don't shout
There was nothing serious

288
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:59,146
When I was coming
after packing the dresses. . .

289
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,688
. . .a scoundreI heId my hand to stop me

290
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,151
BangIes got broken. That's aII.

291
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,828
You need not do any business
anymore. Be at home quietIy. Its enough.

292
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,357
Over and done.
Have you understood?

293
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,362
I toId you to get married
and you go out to ruIe the pIaces!

294
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,172
Why do we need this aII?
Am I not earning? Why more?

295
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,105
-You be quiet.
You've aIready got BP. -You shut up.

296
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,844
I wiII go and Iock that shop tomorrow

297
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,781
I wiII okay the groom
who saw you a few days back

298
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,377
Understood?
Don't dare to say any word! Be carefuI!

299
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,846
She gets so angry!

300
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,653
It is onIy our mistake.

301
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,390
We provided whatever she asked

302
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,385
We shouId've sIapped and
warned when she wore the pant and shirt

303
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,462
I'II okay that aIIiance.
The probIem wiII be over.

304
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,201
Ok, first come and have food.
You sit and have your food.

305
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,993
Let her say ok, then I wiII eat.

306
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,671
Why you're aIso adamant Iike her?

307
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,479
Does she onIy gets anger, not me.

308
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,339
I won't eat tiII she says ok

309
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,955
Yes, ok. Go and eat.

310
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,121
I must teII you a deadIy news
What is it?

311
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,989
If I say, you wiII faII down immediateIy
TeII, what it is!

312
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,893
-If your dad hears, he wiII
do a somersauIt. -Say it immediateIy.

313
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,699
First you sit down.
Come on, sit down.

314
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,229
Ok, teII me -CIose your eyes.
-What? CIose your eyes

315
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,070
Ok, teII me

316
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,118
Take it afterwards.
What I say wiII take onIy one minute.

317
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,518
Just a minute, I wiII come soon.

318
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,059
I wiII caII you again.

319
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,402
Now teII me.

320
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,445
In aII these years,
at Ieast for a moment. . ..

321
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,178
. . .did you ever imagine me as your husband?

322
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,011
Is this what you wanted to teII?

323
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,285
Now, Ieave it.
There is no use taIking about it anymore

324
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,794
Engagement got fixed.
Marriage chores aIso started.

325
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,459
Marriage shouId be heId in BhadrachaIam.

326
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,298
What shouId I do
to make you change your decision?

327
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,803
Is it ok if I earn one Iakh rupees?

328
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,134
You think, but you won't do it

329
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,311
It is true.

330
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,448
It is true.

331
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,848
Sita, you may feeI angry.

332
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,582
But, you aIso think
about our responsibiIities

333
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,318
Say something, dear.

334
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,494
First switch off the TV

335
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,497
I am onIy asking you

336
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,663
I don't get fun in scoIding you!

337
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,999
Mom, ask him first to say sorry.
He scoIded me unnecessariIy.

338
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,543
What my pant and shirts did to him?

339
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,012
Ok, I am sorry. Is it aIright?

340
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,175
Why do you shout at me
if somebody does something?

341
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,620
Whatever happens, why do you
Iink my shop with my marriage?

342
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,288
Its not Iike that, Sita. The parents
wiII be with you for sometime in Iife.

343
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,552
Afterwards, that companion
shouId come from outside.

344
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,692
That is from the husband.

345
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,490
He is aIso a maIe!
Who knows if he supports or kiIIs!

346
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,365
Its not Iike that

347
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,365
I am not at aII angry with you, dad.

348
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,205
But, after being born on this
earth, Iived freeIy. . .

349
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,544
. . .did aII the things Iike others. . .

350
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,905
. . .today I had to Iock the
shop because of a maIe!

351
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,248
I am forced to change my career.
That is my worry. That's aII.

352
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,889
May be you can come up
in your career because of another maIe

353
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,248
Why can't you think Iike that?

354
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,223
Thanks. I'II agree when
it happens Iike that.

355
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,254
You have to marry, before it happens!

356
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,267
I don't Iike those at aII,
who does a standard job.

357
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:08,739
A job, smaII pIace,
chiIdren, retirement pIan etc.,

358
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,405
ShaII I say that we are considering?

359
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,002
It doesn't Iook good
if we didn't repIy anything

360
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,244
Get Iost.

361
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,676
Sita, my dear.
Just think once about Venkat

362
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,252
Sita, think once about Venkat. Think it.

363
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,625
SmiIe is aIright.

364
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,042
FinaI test, If I kiss him,

365
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,847
Its somewhat ok.
Not that much bad!

366
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,790
AII may not get a husband Iike Nagarjuna.

367
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,191
Ok.

368
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,863
Where is their phone number?

369
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,296
They want the marriage
to be heId in BhadrachaIam.

370
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,794
They have some pIedge to god.

371
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,266
Mom, you went up to
marriage itseIf. Many thanks.

372
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,338
OnIy if everything works out.

373
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,869
Then aII of us traveI in the boat.

374
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,304
Rajamundry to BhadrachaIam.
My friend said, it wiII be beautifuI.

375
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,308
Papi hiIIs! Even yesterday's daiIy

376
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,149

00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,134

00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,678
Damn it! PIaying cards, cigarette butts!

383
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,140
Do they think it as
Godavari or a dust bin!

384
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,043
Everything must be
cIeaned in 2 minutes.

385
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,351
EIse, I'II get disgraced
before the tourists, you fooIs

386
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,080
Is the boat washed?
Yes sir.

387
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:42,159
BuIIabbai, has PuIIamma come?
Not yet. Don't know if she comes or not

388
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,416
GODAVARI

389
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,228
Madam, rickshaw!

390
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,237
Give me your Iuggage

391
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,118
The groom didn't Iike our Sita.

392
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,587
They say that the girI is very fast.

393
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,328
Why are you Iaughing Iike a monkey?

394
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,261
Why do you question me aIone?

395
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,993
You shouIdn't Iaugh. That's it.

396
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,459
Fathers don't have that right.

397
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,596
Say sorry.
Its aII because of you.

398
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,604
You've Iearned a good Iesson now.

399
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,401
I'II just ask you,
shouId everybody Iike after seeing you?

400
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,945
You simpIy imagine
yourseIf as Queen Victoria!

401
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,137
Yes, I am Queen Victoria.

402
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,013
How can anyone reject this beauty

403
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,075
Did he see me properIy?

404
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,816
I thought I can go to BhadrachaIam
happiIy in boat if your marriage is fixed

405
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,456
ShouId one go after marrying?

406
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,454
Mom, I am going to BhadrachaIam.

407
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,897

00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,232
What are you taIking?
Are you mad?

409
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,125
Let her go.
You go.

410
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,969
May be after seeing deities Sita and
Ram your marriage wiII be heId quickIy

411
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,234
This is not for marriage.
But for me.

412
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,639
OnIy me.
I am going just to escape your annoyance.

413
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,141

Don't annoy me.

00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,030
Idiots, tied in the way!

430
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:12,969
Hey, my baIIoons!

431
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,444

432
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,717

What a damn Iife?

440
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,282
Dog that can not bark.

441
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,025
Why the practice?
Why rats get afraid?

442
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,251
AII the girIs are
in Iine to woo, damn it!

443
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,490
If I go to BhadrachaIam,
far from these feIIows. . .

444
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,762
I may bark again,
after seeing mother Sita.

445
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,961
Have you seen a red shirt cIad man?
No, I haven't.

446
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,373
What did your parrot say?
It said I wiII face a big Ioss.

447
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,607
Damn your horoscope and Ioss!

00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,779
Sir, Iet me get in at Ieast
to know what that Ioss is?

449
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,107
I don't have sentiments.
Ask him if you want.

450
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,715
-No.
-BuIIabbai, pIease teII.

451
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,179
Has PuIIamma come?

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,615

Sit down. You are Iike a dame!

454
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,697
Hi sister, are you fine?

00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,824
How dare he touch me?

456
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,560
No, how dare he carry?

457
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,493
I wiII teach him a Iesson.

458
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:25,172
WhiIe you bath in Godavari,
not as you take bath in the home. . ...

459
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,836
Are you going for Godavari, sir?

460
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,241

461
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,254

I toId you many times that I can't.

466
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,962
ShouId I cry seeing her marriage?

467
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,809
-It wiII be peacefuI
if I go away from here. -Ok, then

468
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,542
You can't go.
Why shouId I stay here?

469
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:05,813
Ok, bye

470
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,681
Take food at right times, ok?

471
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,785
If you take your medicines correctIy,
then I wiII have my food correctIy

472
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,083
-Take care
-You take care.-Take care

473
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,461
I am caIIing you onIy

474
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:24,090
Why did you carry me
without my permission?

475
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,406
I couIdn't see you do disco
on the pIank, so I just heIped you

476
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,701
HeIp! Do you think I am a fooI?

477
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,573
You just did it to
woo this beautifuI girI!

478
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:39,583
WiII you carry her?

479
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,419
I won't.

480
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,093
Whatever it may be
What you did was wrong.

481
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,818
I may faII down or faII in Godavari.

482
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,657
That's my wish.
Why do you bother?

483
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,090
So what shouId I do now?
Say sorry.

484
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:59,599
-Ramu, adieu your aunt once,
eIse she may feeI bad. -Ok

485
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,766
What is your probIem?
If I say sorry, wiII you be happy?

486
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,604
He thinks himseIf as Megastar!

487
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,946
Thank god, he hasn't boarded the boat!

488
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,546
Ramu, are you mad?
It seems you said you won't come!

489
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,651
She is getting married.
He has settIed it.

490
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,655
How can you be absent
from Raji's marriage for that?

491
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,952
-Aunt, I don't have mood.
I feeI pained. -I too feeI so.

492
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,291
I am coming.ShouId we

493
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,794
Room is nice.
Let me see the toiIet.

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,132
ToiIet is aIso neat.
Ok mom, teII me if anybody caIIs.

00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,649
Move on man.

497
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,161
We might've started
in a short time, do you know?

498
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,998
WiII the Godavari

499
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,996
Why did you deIay so much?

500
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,560
Is it so easy to come Iike you,
without any burdens?

501
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,801
What have you decided about me?
Say something, sir.

502
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,339
How many times I shouId say?
Damn it! Get down.

PIease, sir.

If you say, I wiII do anything.

00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:24,351
Why you didn't want to come?
Let's go.

507
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:29,857
Dear, if you do Iike this,

00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,699
I won't marry at aII.

511
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,204
I am teIIing for sure.

512
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,055
Ok, Iet's go.

513
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,234
-Madam, have you seen a
red shirt cIad man? -No, chiId.

514
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,896
If I get in Godavari?
If they catch, it wiII be horribIe.

515
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,739
If I won't get caught,
then I wiII become a hero.

516
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,076
AII these femaIes depend on me
They obey my orders.

517
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:36,919

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,678
Rama won't faII.
OnIy we go up and down in Iife.

This traveI may give a Iot of

00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,472

548
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,275
The Godavari is flowing gushingly!

549
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,786
The paddy field is moving gently!

550
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,447
The blue sky reflected in Godavari!

551
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,050
lts like a silk robe to our land!

552
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,719
She, a goddess who clear our woes!

553
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,263
She, a personification of Vedas!

554
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,924
She met with Sabari and paved...

555
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,469
...the flowery way
to the story of Rama!

556
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,163
Lift up the sail,
Push the oars fast!

557
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,536
Make a straight and sure way!

558
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,440
Like the sharpened look...

559
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,047
Life is nothing but a swim upstream!

560
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,458
Friendships, wedding life chores!

561
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,823
The parrot predicts the future!

562
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,697

563
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,027
...the business brisk and profitable!

564
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,992
As if the houses turned as boats!

565
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,196
The enchanting scenes of a home!

566
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,840
The beauty in the locale is being...

567
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,671
...demanded by the watery mirror!

568
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,438
Nothing became short of luxury...

569
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,639
...of our Rama here, in this spot!

570
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,513
ln the procession on the river!

571
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,816
As the lord arrives in the boat!

572
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:47,726
Mother Godavari's vermillion
come from the shades of chilies!

573
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:52,975
Lanka's lord Ravana,
gnaws saying he can't tolerate anymore!

574
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:58,112
The looks convey the
information to the lady, Sita!

575
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:03,580
The clouds of dubiousness stop
the truth from reaching the eyes

576
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:08,588
ln the world that's imaginary
the friendly isolations unite!

577
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:14,096
As the Papi hills dark shades
Which can't be cleansed,!

578
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,699
The smile came on her face!

579
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,803
She, a goddess who clear our woes!

580
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,448
She, a personification of Vedas!

581
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,050
She met with Sabari and paved...

582
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,653
..the flowery way to the story of Rama!

583
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,289
Lift up the sail,
Push the oars fast!

584
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,619
Make a straight and sure way!

585
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,455
Like the sharpened look...

586
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,131
Life is nothing but a swim upstream!

587
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:13,653
Its him! He Iooks rich,
then why craves for my chips?

588
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,819
He can get it for just Rs.10
Damn it!

589
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,680
He seems Iike a mad?
ShaII I scoId him?

590
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,212
My packet is here onIy!

591
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,147
Mom asked to get Mehindi, PIantains
and coconuts etc. . .

592
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,053
. . .as per this Iist in the next stop.

593
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,055
Why did you purchase again?
Here is the Iist.

594
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,421
A girI ate aII my chips.

595
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,558
She used to take the twice what I take
finaIIy she took the entire packet.

596
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,068
Is she a beggar?

597
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:36,564
Then, you shouId have scoIded her.

598
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,736
I thought that she might be hungry.

599
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,248
I thought that was my packet.
I actuaIIy feIt you were grabbing

600
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:51,252
I became very angry.
A smaII communication gap, that's aII.

601
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,588
You might have toId me

602
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,921
I won't take risk with girIs.

603
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,462
It is better if I shut my mouth.
I experienced with her.

604
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,767
She is Raji, my uncIe's daughter.
My name is Sita MahaIakshmi.

605
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,270
She is sharp Iike a knife, isn't it?

606
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,452
If hero is Megastar,
then I am Queen Victoria!

607
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,836
BeautifuI river Godavari

608
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,134
The surroundings are more beautifuI.

609
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:48,476
Nice boat. A trip must be
taken by aII in a Iife time.

610
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:53,811
In that an amazing person!
I offered hand to shake and said, Sita.

611
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,315
But he saIuted Iike Chiranjeevi
and said Ram, Sri Ram!

612
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:02,815
Though I grabbed his chips,
he sat simpIy smiIing

613
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,990
I don't know why? Just as with father,
I asked him to say sorry.

614
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:21,166
-Here it is not avaiIabIe.
-When did he give? -Just now.

615
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,343
There in the rare pIace of the boat!

616
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,022
Take it man

617
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:40,056
He is teIIing aII about poIice.
He reguIarIy speaks to CM.

618
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,189
Whatever you need in this state. . ..

619
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:49,371
Raji, even if I ask,
don't teII about him. I get tense.

620
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,371
Sorry, dear!

621
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:59,575
He is coming. Is it ok for you
if I stay here or shaII I go?

622
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,876
Are you mad? Stay if you Iike.
You need not sacrifice anything for me

623
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,583
Be seated.
Bring the chair.

624
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,063
Not yet opened?

625
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,063
Because I said costIy,
are you saving it?

626
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,067
Many Iike this.
If you Iike. . .

627
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,006
What is it?

628
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,582
You keep taIking. I wiII go.

629
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,429
Brother, I am not a beggar.

630
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,599
Keep it. No probIem.

631
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,939
My baIIoons worth 500 rupees!
I went aside for toiIet.

632
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,907
-That man came
and cut them off. -Who?

633
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,810
I too don't know.
He is cIad with a red shirt.

634
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,544
He is in this boat.
So I just jumped in without a thought

635
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,813
I haven't eaten anything since morning.
The captain is chasing me. . .

636
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,116
. . .because I didn't buy a ticket.

637
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,284
Get down in next stop and go home.
Your parents may be worried.

638
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:22,956
Mother is innocent. Father boozes
and beats her Iike an animaI.

639
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,328
If he knows that
I Iost Rs.500, he wiII kiII me.

640
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,963
I wiII give you
I won't take aIms, brother.

641
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,141
Swearing on deities Sita and Ram
if that red shirt cIad man is caught. . .

642
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,937
. . .can you teach him a Iesson
and see that my money is returned?

643
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:39,475
Don't cry. Take this.

644
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,483
...made a habit this swing

645
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:50,149

your name in our breath. . .

646
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,158
Everybody take Aarti(camphor fire)

647
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,661

648
00:48:55,866 --> 00:49:02,328
Swing, swing, the holy swing!

00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:09,501
Swing, swing, the holy swing!

650
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:15,852
Oh heart, the victory is yours!

651
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:20,690
Like a real human fill
the world with brilliance!

652
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,365
Come.

653
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,711
Srinu give them chutney.
Ok.

654
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,272
What do you want?

655
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,715
-Two pIates of pancakes.
-What PuIIamma? -The cake is sourer.

656
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,481
-Are you finding fauIt with
this PuIIamma's cakes? -Just for fun.

657
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,557
Sour cakes wiII be sour onIy.
Bring one butter cake for me.

658
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,092
Are you foIIowing me?

Why do you bother?
Mind your own business.

00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,108
Though you are of high breed,

707
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,681
ShouIdn't we speak. Go man.

He aIways used to refer my notes.
We were in same coIIege even in US

715
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,649
He became fatter there.
By the way, how do you know him?

716
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,590

719
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,666
Is it a joke?

720
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,469
Is it to earn weaIth?
No,

721
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,305
I wish to serve the peopIe.

722
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:07,806
Just now you did. But you got scoIded!
PoIitics is aIso the same.

723
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:11,139
Even if you
do nice things you'II get brick bats!

724
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,142
Raji aIso says the same.

725
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,343
May be that's why
she is marrying Ravindra.

726
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:24,149
Do you Iove Raji?
Don't know.

727
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,330
Don't know?
Then why you wanted to marry her?

728
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,327
Its a personaI issue.
Is it ok if I don't say?

729
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:32,433
You are eating my cakes.
Is it not my personaI one?

730
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,496
Ok, I don't know

731
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,836
whether it is
Iove or not, but I wanted to marry her

732
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:44,046
See, right from my chiIdhood,
I never thought of marriage.

733
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:48,514
Because Raji was there.
GirI means Raji onIy for me.

734
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,522
Whether she wears
skirt and haIf sari or a sari

735
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,354
Or writing an exam, or sIeeping or

736
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,357
even if she is angry, I Iike her.

737
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:02,027
I thought she wiII be
my Iife companion.

738
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,398
You can do some
other job just for her.

739
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,206
If I change for everyone,
then what is my identity?

740
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:17,076
Won't it be pain-fuII to
see her with Ravindra?

741
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,038
Yes it wiII be.
But, I have to manage it.

742
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,887
She is happy, that's enough.

743
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:30,215
What are you doing here?
Grandma caIIing. Come fast.

00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,229
-Sour cakes.

00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,634
The drippings and the pores of veil!

750
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,799
Blaring cool gales brings rain!

751
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:55,970
The fish in the lake are like...

752
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,643
...cute babies playing on hands!

753
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,815
Sprinkling around water drops!

754
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,377
The rain, like the small showers
with fancy sounds...

755
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,915
...makes us completely drenched!

756
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:09,317
The lightening moving from
cloud to cloud is flirting!

757
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,922
With the blinking eyes!

758
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,495
Like the heat in the forest
and mild scorching flame!

759
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:56,364
The showers and breeze came
together to sway us gently!

760
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,100
As the children and grown ups
frolic and fun in the down pour!

761
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:07,981
ln the house boat and hiding
the youth share tender love!

762
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:13,920
During the tiny stops, secret,
coquetting calls form damsels!

763
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,722
The comings and goings are
controlled by the lord himself!

764
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:29,861
When stream become Godavari
Then life is upstream fight only!

765
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:35,793
Sunshine, rain , hillocks and
valleys became a difficult game!

766
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:41,970
The swelling waters and soft
moving breeze came pleasantly!

767
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:47,807
She, who gave tasted fruits
that ripened lady is Sabari

768
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,484
ln the rain, in the shower,
it's a perpetual swaying!

769
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,315
The drippings and the pores of veil!

Come out. Don't behave fooIishIy.

823
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,790
Why are you shouting Iike that?
Go and mind your business.

824
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,788
Don't taIk Iike a mad. First come out.

825
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,966
I am having a nice swim.
Why do you foIIow and annoy me?

826
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:07,795
Am I foIIowing you?
Are you swimming happiIy?

827
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:11,804
Aren't you ashamed? WouId anyone
jump in river at night and swim?

828
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,140
Again you are shameIess

829
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:18,142
You're showing your muscIes
before a girI, wear your shirt.

830
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:23,650
I was very shaken, do you know?

831
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,580
I wanted to caII aII
and stop the boat itseIf.

832
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,156
Thanks, you didn't do that.

833
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,155
Why do you create probIems unnecessariIy?

834
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,158
You seemed heartbroken the restaurant

835
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,490
Seeing it anybody wiII get disturbed.

836
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,829
Many peopIe reject in Iife

837
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,664
Some join and some get separated.

838
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,841
But we don't keep on
worrying about those gone

839
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,510
I know aII this.
WiII you stop now?

840
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:51,507
There are so many
girIs better than Raji

841
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:52,844
And you wiII meet them aIso

842
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:55,847
One minute.

843
01:05:58,688 --> 01:05:59,518
Now, teII me.

844
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:00,856
Nothing.
I wont teII you.

845
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,790
Are you feeIing
simiIarIy about your Iean Venkat?

846
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:09,020
That is not the topic.
Its my personaI matter.

847
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,456
I got it now.

848
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,795
Why don't you feeI
this as my personaI thing?

849
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:18,536
So pIease stop it
and mind your business.

850
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,705
Whatever it may be.
You were drowning in Godavari and. . .

851
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,215
. . .I rescued you.
What?

852
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,146
You must thank me.

853
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,897
Why shouId I say?
You onIy came and shouted.

854
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,895
Made a nuisance.
I never asked you

855
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,837
You must teII.
I won't teII

856
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,400
You must teII.

857
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:59,647
Yesterday sorry, now thanks!
Am I here for your service?

858
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,408
It became a big joke
to this girI. Go and cry.

859
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,748
WiII you say go and cry?

860
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,594
Oh, god I can't understand girIs.

861
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,090
I won't move at aII tiII
that monkey comes. Is he coming?

862
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:21,767
Won't he?

863
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:24,535
What if he doesn't come?

864
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,939
Coming Iike a thief.
Now he wiII say thanks.

865
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:39,684
Won't you move from here?

866
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,158
I forgot what and why to say?

867
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:51,789
WiII you have a tea, my treat.

868
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,467
Does he think that I just
accompany him wagging my taiI!

869
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,134
I am Sita MahaIakshmi.

870
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,809
Does anyone caII you as
stubborn fooI in your home?

871
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,310
How do you know?
Some inteIIigent guess. That's aII.

872
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:09,741
Then what? I caIIed for tea
because you are standing in coId

873
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:10,817
But you are haughty!

874
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,045
Yes I am .

875
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:17,382
Because I don't Iike your
damn face, tea and invitation!

876
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:18,723
That's aII. Ok.

877
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,469
Why sister Sita didn't come so far?
I don't know.

878
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,503
Not pIanned anything for breakfast.
It wiII be nice if she comes soon.

879
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:37,542
Don't know when she wiII come!

880
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,743
-Wait here.
I wiII come soon. -Ok, brother.

881
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:43,847
They might have fought
because they are human.

882
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,286
Master doesn't have any
PubIic ReIations skiIIs

883
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,180
He beIieves that useIess feIIow Ramu.

884
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,357
He can't even get the
sour cakes in the boat.

885
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:51,751
If he foIIows such a man. . .

886
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,019
. . .then what about a foIIower Iike me?

887
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,886
This is caIIed dog's Iife. Damn it!

888
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,432
Please give me some food, if you have

889
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,895
lt will be the best to
have fish soup or prawn fry.

890
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,501
Who is this?
Parrot!

891
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:12,039
Why are you duII? Haven't had
breakfast? -Master didn't give.

892
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,215
Why? What happened to him?

893
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:16,713
I predicted his future.
He is angry because it is not happening

894
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,914
He is tensed. It shouId
happen before we reach Iord Rama.

895
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,923
ReaIIy do you have confidence?

896
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,053
Are you a cheat or genuine predictor?

897
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,266
100o/o correct. ShaII I teII yours?
No, not needed.

898
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,925
Wait I wiII see if any
fruits are there in the waste bin.

899
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,072
AppIe ok, or do you need onIy guava?

900
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,471
There is no choice for
you as you are in a cage.

901
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:43,574
My Iife is better.

902
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,341
Sita, open the door.

903
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,290
What happened, Sita?
What happened?

904
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:03,694
Be carefuI.

905
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:07,264
She is having fever.

906
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,303
I don't Iike your. . .

907
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,315
. . .damn face, tea and invitation

908
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:31,987
Yesterday we fought.
Then why did you enter my room?

909
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:39,629
Yesterday we fought.
Then, why did you enter my room?

910
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:43,530
Get out. PIease get out.

911
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:49,076
You have fever. You feII down.
I Iifted you up. That's aII.

912
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,145
I wiII take Ieave
Sit here without moving.

913
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,920
I don't want. -Are you mad?
Eat quietIy and have the medicine

914
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:04,486
I won't take what you brought,
I wiII get them again. Go away

915
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:10,153
No, I won't go untiI you
eat and take medicine

916
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,328
Do whatever you Iike

917
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:13,827
Ok, be seated

918
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,011
I shouId go to bathroom.

919
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,118
You aIways repair it,
working it since 10 years.

920
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:35,990
What sir, what is the probIem?

921
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,722
Motor shouId be repaired
There is no water.

922
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,122
TiII I say, don't go to bathroom etc.,

923
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:52,596
Do you need heIp?
No, I need water.

924
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:54,737
Is it ok if I bring?

925
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:57,975
Then,. . .

926
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:09,216
Sita, I must appreciate
your parents for enduring you.

927
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:16,961
How do you feeI?

928
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:19,897
WiII you have tea?

929
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:22,834
Has your anger subsided?

930
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,831
My father never
refuses anything we ask for.

931
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,175
That's why, I became a bit stubborn.

932
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,648
I get over angery
But I become normaI soon.

933
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,249
A bit stubborn?

934
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:41,120
Thank god, I just remembered
and came to you. . .

935
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,085
. . .eIse you might had
stayed the whoIe night there.

936
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:46,758
You Iook nice whiIe in anger, Sita.

937
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:48,994
Biting those naiIs, cursing. . .

938
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,199
I came to thank you
after remembering that

939
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,463
Let me see if any of your naiIs Ieft?

940
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,199
Big danger is averted
Its because of you onIy

941
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,206
She was wearing sari
bit Iow and appeared sexiIy

942
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,809
You became fIat and
turned into a broken heart Iike Devadas

943
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,281
I onIy toId her the combination
and how to wear.

944
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,485
Don't feeI too much

945
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:15,685
Might be. But a sari
gets beauty from who wears it

946
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:24,761
You are a girI onIy. You don't
Iike it if I praise another girI

947
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,503
I've seen 100s Iike her.
My profession is Iike that.

948
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,397
If I wear that sari
you need not jump into Godavari.

949
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,507
You die of heart attack.

950
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,478
Leave it.
You are a waste feIIow. Go away.
