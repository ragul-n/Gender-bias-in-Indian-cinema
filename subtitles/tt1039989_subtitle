00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,655
There is restlessness
in my heart all the time.

2
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:54,785
What will happen now?

3
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,226
What's going to happen?

4
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:05,268
There is
restlessness all the time.

5
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,840
There is restlessness
in my heart all the time.

6
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:12,970
What will happen now?

7
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,308
What's going to happen?

8
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:23,654
There is
restlessness all the time.

9
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,988
We are searching for one day.

10
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:34,525
The missing Sunday. Sunday.

11
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:36,667
Sunday.
- Come on.

12
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,702
I don't know what has happened?

13
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:47,004
Every Sunday.

14
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:49,982
I don't know what has happened?

15
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,779
The missing Sunday.

16
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,353
There is restlessness
in my heart all the time.

17
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,482
What will happen now?

18
00:02:58,558 --> 00:02:59,855
What's going to happen?

19
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:08,961
There is
restlessness all the time.

20
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:15,539
We are searching for one day.

21
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:19,743
The missing Sunday. Sunday

22
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:24,715
We are searching for one day.

23
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:29,016
The missing Sunday. Sunday

24
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:30,989
Sunday... Sunday

25
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,924
We are searching for one day.

26
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:38,328
The missing Sunday. Sunday

27
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,349
Why have you brought
me to your farm house?

28
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,478
Do you love me?

29
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:02,646
What kind of question is this?

30
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:06,920
Tell me, Suhasini, do you
love me? Well, leave it.

31
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:12,087
I have brought a gift for you.
Shall we? - Really?

32
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:36,987
I had loved you, Suhasini.
But you had betrayed me.

33
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,116
But...

34
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:46,494
Yellow. Yellow.
Painful heart. Painful liver.

35
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,424
I gave my heart and took pain.

36
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:51,927
My heart is filled
with painful disco.

37
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,735
These songs don't
affect me at all. Why?

38
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,972
Why? Because I am the
pain killer, Chakki.

39
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,149
You all are flies
in front of me. Why?

40
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:13,051
Because I know karate. You
should learn karate too. Why?

41
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:16,027
Because in the city of
Delhi men is still helpless.

42
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,897
They may be attacked at any time.

43
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:24,434
Jimmy! Jimmy! Where are you going?

44
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:28,007
Jimmy! Jimmy!

45
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,000
God. Jimmy!

46
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,525
Jimmy. Is there anyone? Help!

47
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,178
Suspect coming towards Masjid lane.

48
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,523
Suspect coming towards Masjid lane.

49
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,521
Anwar calling sir.

50
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,086
Waiting for your order sir.

51
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,858
On course, Anwar calling sir.

52
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,260
Anwar calling sir.

53
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,571
Anwar calling sir. Sir, come now.

54
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,199
Otherwise our suspect will slip.

55
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,003
Anwar calling, sir.

56
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,269
Sir, come now.

57
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,037
Waiting for your order sir.

00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,624
It is good stuff.

59
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,792
The stuff seems excellent.

60
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,711
Sir, we have
reached near the suspect.

61
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:57,647

62
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,711
I want my way.

63
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:08,911
Its Sunday.

64
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,389
Sunday.

65
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:21,095
Come with me, I want my way.

66
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,464
Sunday.

67
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,869
Sunday.

68
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:32,844
Sunday.

69
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:47,984
Sunday.

70
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:04,866
Drugs, opium, brown sugar, heroin.

71
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:10,174
Fool, have you started
a supermarket? What?

72
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:14,943
Tell sir that I will pay 30,000.

73
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:23,151
Sir, he is offering 30,000
to get out of this mess.

74
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:43,145
What is name? - P.O.K. Sir.
- Pakistan occupied Kashmir?

75
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:47,484
No, sir, P.O.K. Prabhuram Om Kumar.

76
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:52,882
You are bribing me.

77
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,466
That also of 30,000.
- If you say so, sir.

78
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,028
My offer was of 30,000.
You tell me yours.

79
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,395
Dance.

80
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,836
Sir, why are you taking the stuff?

81
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:22,215
What are you doing, sir?
- Your stuff was bad.

82
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:28,249
Sir, you have ruined all my plans.
- Do one thing.

83
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,595
Stop dealing in poison
and become a politician.

84
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,025
You will earn money
and respect from me too.

85
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,459
But sir...

86
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:48,871
I don't like too much babbling.
What? - Babbling.

87
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:09,364
I have called this meeting today...

88
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:17,240
...because I want to discuss
something important with you.

89
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:23,206
And the topic is Global warming.

90
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:32,918
Men have even stopped
thinking about Global Warming.

91
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:39,023
That's why we animals
have to do something.

92
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:40,925
You are right, your majesty.

93
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:47,300
Nowadays, I don't need to
plunge into water to bathe.

94
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,936
I bath in my sweat. It stinks.

95
00:13:54,347 --> 00:14:00,377
I have the solution to
your problem. Use deodorant.

96
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,579
Deodorant won't help.

97
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:07,388
We will have to
plant trees everywhere.

98
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,685
So that the world becomes cooler.

99
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:16,702
Big brother, if there are plants
everywhere where will we stay?

100
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:19,027
Tell me, dear.
- In the city.

101
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:23,371
All of us will go to
the city. Let's go.

102
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:33,716
It was good take, Sehar.
- Thanks.

103
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,085
By the way, we've also got the
contract for 'Little Stuart in China'

104
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,986
Okay. - So start practicing. -
Dub bing will begin next week.

105
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,556
Okay.
- Don't forget. - Why will I forget?

106
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:43,720
Madam you had forgotten your mobile.

107
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:56,367
Karate is the martial arts which
can bring 3 things to your life.

108
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,404
Hey gang, what's happening?

109
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,741
Hey! Nothing much.

110
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,538
We are just watching Jackie
Chan's martial arts training.

111
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,014
What are steps? What are steps?

112
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:10,221
Even the participants of a
dance competition learn steps.

113
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:16,117
But pain. Learn to
control pain. For example.

114
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,225
Did I experience pain?
No, I didn't it?

115
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,691
See this.

116
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:25,100
Did I experience pain?
Did I experience pain?

117
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,463
Did I experience pain?
Did I experience pain?

118
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:35,705
Guys, come.

119
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:43,153
Chakki, are you okay? Are you
coming to the movie with us?

120
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,583
He will have to come. He
is paying for the tickets.

121
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:49,618
From where did you learn Chinese?

122
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:53,059
I was searching for such
a Chinese mouse voice...

123
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:55,726
...for 'Stuart
Little in China'. Speak.

124
00:15:58,471 --> 00:15:59,529
Superb.

125
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:04,440
Thank you, Chakki. You are too good.

126
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,273
We will meet the day after
tomorrow for the movie. Bye.

127
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,538
He is so funny.

128
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:32,097
Right now police has
assured the Delhi people that...

129
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,629
...Suhasini Pradhan's
murderer will be caught soon.

130
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,399
But the important question is when.

131
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:40,678
Or the murderer may strike
again in the time being.

132
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:43,104
It is obvious that
Suhasini's Pradhan's murderer...

133
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,377
...is still roaming a
round freely in Delhi.

134
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,385
Sehar?
- Not Sehar, Shamsher.

135
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,222
Shamsher Singh
Bahadur Singh. Who is this?

136
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,294
This is Sehar's mother.
- Mother. Very good.

137
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:05,132
We were talking about you.
You are still reading.

138
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,630
I don't learn I teach. I am teacher

139
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:12,267
Give the phone to Sehar.
- Oh yes. Madam. Your mother.

140
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,847
Yes, mother, tell me.
- Who was it?

141
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:20,152
It was Sehar, mother.
- You have started again.

142
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,577
All right tell me, are you
coming for the holidays?

143
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,857
Yes, I will come as soon
as the exams are over.

144
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,323
And we have to think
about your wedding too.

145
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:33,190
Oh God. Stupid! Mom. Mom,
you should work for TV serials.

146
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,794
After that go on saying, get
married dear. Get married.

147
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,497
Hello. Aunt.
- Who is this? - Ritu. - Ritu.

148
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:43,575
You can find a boy for me.
I am dying to get married.

149
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,166
Is it?
- The one you marry will die!

150
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:46,302
What nonsense?

151
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,904
But Ritu your company
is not affecting Sehar.

152
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:53,816
Aunt, find a boy with a brother.
Both of us will get settled.

153
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,821
Isn't it? Great idea. Right.
- Mom, she will bore you now.

154
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,915
Bye mom.
- Bye aunt. How mean. Take this.

155
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,888
The bracelet will look
great with dress I gave you.

156
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,861
You are looking gorgeous.
Where are you going?

157
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:10,595
Sehar. - Yes. - We both
are going together. - Where?

158
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:12,662
Disco, Sehar.

159
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,751
Hi, Danny.
- Hi, ma'am. - My drink please.

160
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:32,381
The usual, ma'am.
- Yes. - Okay. Right away, ma'am.

161
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:34,617
And for your friend?
- She will drink milk.

162
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,954
Than shall I order your usual?
Breezer. - Whatever.

163
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,227
Hi, baby. - One Breezer and
one blue Lagoon. - Duffers!

164
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,224
What? What did she say?

165
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:44,927
Okay, listen.

166
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:46,596
I have fixed an appointment
with the doctor this Tuesday.

167
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:49,641
Please don't forget it this time.
- I won't. - Good.

168
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,242
Dhawal, I have a dream. A wish.
- What?

169
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,276
I wish I was an airplane.
- Why an airplane.

170
00:18:56,682 --> 00:19:00,516
To enter between the twin
towers standing in front.

171
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:04,714
Brother, they are calling.

172
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:07,750
Hi.

173
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:10,720
Hi, Sexy.

174
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:13,663
Have fun.
- Let's run. - Stupid.

Your mother!

349
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:00,935
Girls and boys. Come here everybody.

350
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:05,309
You have a gang.
- Everybody come on.

351
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:08,409
Excuse me, what's your problem?
- Cheat.

352
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,348
What?
- One moment you are there.

353
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:13,152
The next moment you vanish.
Take out my 420. Take it out.

354
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,652
Move! - Who are you? -
Who am I? I am Mr. India.

355
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:20,323
Can't you see me? Wear red glasses.
You lie and tell tales.

356
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,665
Come on, give me my 420.
- Enough now.

357
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,498
What is happening here?
What is happening?

358
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:37,209
I will fix you with
martial arts. Got it.

359
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:42,486
I will fix you,
you half sized bread.

360
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:43,949
I'll give you one tight slap.

361
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,683
Once I am done with you
will be rattling. Got it.

362
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,959
Fool, dare to touch me.

363
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:00,462
Brother, shall I?

364
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:04,032
Fire.

365
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,386
Blood. Blood.

366
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:25,719
The blood has come out.
But the bullet is inside.

367
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:28,996
Bullet? - Bullet. - I
have been shot. - Correct.

368
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:36,005
I have been shot. I am dead.
Save me. I have been shot.

369
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:37,599
Save me.

370
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,075
Save me, I am going to die.

371
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:43,544
I am dying. Save me. I am dead.

372
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:50,519
How do I look?
- Oh my God, Mrs. Goel. Look at you.

373
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:54,423
It seems this dress has
been made only for you. Hi.

374
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:55,684
Hi.

375
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,222
I think you are
looking out of the world.

376
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:00,396
This is real you, Mrs. Goel.

377
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,161
Ritu, why do you
need to flatter so much?

378
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:08,101
I am right. She is
looking out of this world.

379
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:11,070
She looks like an alien, isn't it?
- Very mean.

380
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:15,342
Listen, yesterday night
from the disco... - 1 minute.

381
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:18,207
What happened here?
- What?

382
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:20,045
What kind of marks
are there in your neck?

383
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,323
When? How?

384
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:28,218
Look, you have forgotten again.

385
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:31,054
And you were unsure to
go to the doctor. Come.

386
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:42,070
Who has done all this?
- Do I have eyes behind me?

387
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:44,439
Who did this? How
would I know who did this?

388
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,672
I don't know who and
why it was being done.

389
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:53,079
But I can't forget where the
fool did it. - Ballu. - Kumar.

390
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:57,819
Ballu, I heard you met with
an accident. What happened?

391
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:01,222
Friend, I am robed, ruined. I
am not fit to face anyone now.

392
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:04,594
Nothing has happened. The
bullet just touched him.

393
00:33:04,663 --> 00:33:07,154
Touched me? Was the bullet
flirting with me to touch me?

394
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:11,102
It has torn me. It has
shaken my entire foundation.

395
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,104
Look at the positive side, Ballu.
- Yes.

396
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:15,639
If the bullet stayed inside
there might have been blockage.

397
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:18,405
Are you scaring me? Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, sir.

398
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:22,310
From which court are you?
- I am from Palm court.

399
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:26,845
I mean to say what coat are you?
- I am in a black coat.

400
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:31,413
Are you a lawyer? - No, I am
an actor going for an audition.

401
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,548
I have worn a lawyer's coat.
He is my customer.

402
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,354
Clear what customer are you
otherwise he will misunderstand.

403
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:39,864
I mean I am his customer.
I always ride in car.

404
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,156
Why didn't you tell me
before that you are not a lawyer?

405
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:44,526
You didn't ask me.

406
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,798
You wear a lawyer's clothes and...

407
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:48,230
...you don't say that
you are not a lawyer.

408
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,398
Do you say you are a policeman...

409
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:50,532
...after wearing
police man's clothes?

410
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:52,508
But I am a policeman.
- I didn't say you are not.

411
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:55,345
Come on, get out.
Out. Shut up. Get out.

412
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,144
Despite being a policeman
he talks like a watchman.

413
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:24,232
Ghost.

414
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:25,734
Ghost.

415
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,177
Is it a lunatic asylum?
- He looks totally mad. Let's go.

416
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:30,305
Ghost.
- Ghost.

417
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:33,546
Ballu, the 420 ghost is here.

418
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:34,676
She is there.

419
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:37,185
She was even there,
where I was shot.

420
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,928
Where is the ghost?
- Where is the girl?

421
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,669
I can't see anyone here.

422
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,203
We are looking for ghost
and he is looking for girls.

423
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:57,532
He is a policeman.

424
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:58,934
Hello, doctor.

425
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:02,944
Come. Come.

426
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:07,909
Dr. Waliya, I am
following your prescription.

427
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,949
2 spoonfuls every morning
and evening. But this cough...

428
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,285
Will it get cured? Sorry.
Hi, Ritu, how are you? - Fine.

429
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:20,220
This is Sehar. I told
you over the phone. - Yes.

430
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:23,262
Sorry. Sorry. What is your problem?

431
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:27,761
Actually, I don't
remember thing. I forget.

432
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:29,967
Like I forget my way
to the studio from home.

433
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:31,969
And then I forget my
mobile in the studio.

434
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,905
And then I call up a person
and forget what to talk about.

435
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:38,972
You forget to switch off the
gas after warming milk. - Yes.

436
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,708
You sign the voucher but
forget to take money. - Yes.

437
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,779
And you lock the house
and forget the keys inside.

438
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,849
Yes, how did you know that?

439
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:49,584
Because the same happens to me.

440
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:55,693
What is your problem?
- I am Ritu.

441
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,495
I have brought Sehar here.

442
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:00,997
Oh yes. Look, I
have forgotten again.

443
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,738
I don't believe it.

444
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:14,750
I didn't know Sehar, I
am so sorry he was so big.

445
00:36:14,953 --> 00:36:16,011
Yes, you are right.

446
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:19,022
I can forget everything in life
but not this antique of yours.

447
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:21,283
I don't know why. Anyways, listen...

448
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,554
...you leave. I have
to go to aunt Rama.

449
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:26,388
We were about to lunch together.
- Not today, please.

450
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:28,993
Okay. - Okay. - I will
see you. Bye. - See you.

451
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:54,316
Can't you see? You have
hit my car? Pay the damage.

452
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,485
Otherwise I will call the police.
Is your father's road?

453
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:57,653
Move.
- You have hit my car.

454
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:02,055
Sir, the one who has hit the
car is minister Khurana's son.

455
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,325
Pay the damage.
Otherwise I will call the police.

456
00:37:05,537 --> 00:37:07,334
You will call the police.
- Yes, I will. - Call them.

457
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,705
What do you think?
- Call them. Call them.

458
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:12,000
You.
- Hey.

459
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,570
Hi. I am Rajvir Randhawa.

460
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:19,340
Serve them ice-cream on my behalf.

461
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,965
The ice cream is finished. Move.
- Listen. Come here.

462
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:52,679
Indians today drink aerated
drinks and have forgotten lime water.

463
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:54,715
Still my heart is Indian.

464
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:03,583
FTV, MTV, VTV and you
have forgotten Aakashvani.

465
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:06,027
Still my heart is Indian.

466
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:12,764
Reserve Bank is empty while the
Swiss bank holds all the money.

467
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:15,395
Still my heart is Indian.

468
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:21,043
Look, you don't know whose
son I am. Who my father is?

469
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:24,140
Why? Don't you know
whose son you are?

470
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:56,504
Hello.
- Hello.

471
00:38:56,848 --> 00:38:58,440
Sir, this is ACP
(Assistant Commissioner of Police)...

472
00:38:58,516 --> 00:38:59,608
...Rajvir speaking.
- Yes, Rajvir. Tell me.

473
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:03,176
Sir, your son hit a
car and I slapped him.

474
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,448
He didn't tell me that
he is your son, sir.

475
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:06,683
He has no sense of timing.

476
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:09,025
Has something happened?
Shall I do something?

477
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,827
No, sir. I have handled everything.
Okay, sir. Okay.

478
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:17,192
When will he become good?

479
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:21,800
What? You should have told
me before? Are you hurt?

480
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:26,603
No. - Do you want first aid?
- No. - Go. You go.

481
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:33,708
The matter is over. Sir,
you did the right thing.

482
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:38,183
When things don't come easily
then you should try the tricks.

483
00:39:38,823 --> 00:39:40,757
Sir.
- Save me.

484
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:44,120
Someone is trying to
kill me. He is following me.

485
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:47,822
He will kill me. Do something.
- Sir, this is our personal case.

486
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:48,957
Let's go.

487
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:58,501
Maybe he has come
to steal your purse.

488
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,507
Then he would have stolen the purse.

489
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:01,670
Why would he try to kill me?

490
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,239
The thugs today are
very advanced, madam.

491
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:10,051
A few days ago... What was her name?

492
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,245
Suhasini Pradhan.
- Yes, Suhasini Pradhan.

493
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:17,253
She was murdered.
- Are you scaring me?

494
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:19,654
I am not scaring you.

495
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:22,198
I am telling you about
the crimes in Delhi.

496
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:28,603
Come with me. - Where? - To
the police station. - Why?

497
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:30,604
It has become a police case now.

498
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,537
We have to take your statement.

499
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,674
Anwar, Madam's
Scooter mirror has broken.

500
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:43,245
Repair it nicely.
- Nicely, sir.

501
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:45,920
Dance.

502
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,292
Nicely.
- Come.

503
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:02,197
He has come again.

504
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:05,300
Where have you brought me?

505
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:08,311
I am human first
and then a policeman.

506
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:11,581
I thought it doesn't seem good for...

507
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:14,641
...a respectable girl to
come to a police station.

508
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:18,019
Give me your statement here.
I will manage.

509
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,817
Anyways the buttermilk is very nice.

510
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,656
I, you and buttermilk.

511
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:29,057
Tell me more Sehar Thapar.

512
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:32,158
How do you know my name?

513
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:36,231
Delhi police. Our
network is amazing.

514
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,966
You are from Chandigarh, sector 18.

515
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:40,903
How do you know?

516
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:43,071
Delhi police.

517
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:48,214
Actually we have many informers.

518
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:54,020
Your sun sign is Taurus, right?
- Yes. - 5 feet 7 inches. - Yes.

519
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:58,023
And you work with cartoon
characters doing their...

520
00:41:58,095 --> 00:42:00,359
Dubbing.
- Yes. Dubbing. Dubbing.

521
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,262
I can't believe it.
How do you know all this?

522
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:05,199
Same answer. Delhi police.

523
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:11,870
Actually we are very different.
We love. Love.

524
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:18,375
Our uniform, country and loyalty.

525
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,379
Sir, this is your
payment for the week.

526
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,355
Master has sent 3,000 for you.

527
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:32,220
You are bribing me.

528
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:37,895
You are bribing a loyal
policeman in uniform and on duty.

529
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:39,732
When does your duty end, sir?

530
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:41,062
Run from here.

531
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:49,745
People defame all the good people.
But what can we do?

532
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:54,809
The phone is ringing.

533
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:00,415
Hello.
- Dear Sehar. Yes

534
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:02,754
Mother, I was about to call you.

535
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:07,259
Actually, when I was today...
- First listen to me, Sehar.

536
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:08,857
Do you remember aunt Sadhana?

537
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:13,397
I have sent her son your photo,
horoscope and bio-data. - Mother...

538
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:17,772
The son is from Delhi working
for the police at a good post.

539
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:20,772
What is his name?
- Rajvir Randhawa.

540
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,788
He is a very decent,
nice and loyal boy.

541
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:39,354
Take this, sir. A thousand more.

542
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,125
We won't be able to
pay more than this.

543
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:56,740
ACP Rajvir Randhawa, right?

544
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:00,076
Mother's name Sadhana Randhawa.

545
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:03,413
How did you know?

546
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:05,049
Delhi girls.

547
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:09,924
Even our network is good.
You are in Delhi since 3 years.

548
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:12,888
How did you know?

549
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:17,492
Delhi girls. 5 feet 11 inches.
You are Leo.

550
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:19,302
And the biggest thing

551
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:20,828
What?

552
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:23,999
You are the
biggest bribe taker. Bye.

553
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:27,904
I am not corrupt but the
correct police officer.

554
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:33,277
I drink the milk with the cream.
At least drink the buttermilk.

555
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:39,122
I hate cops. Keys. Get lost.
- What have I done? - Get lost.

556
00:44:39,323 --> 00:44:44,522
Sir, here is 5,000. Finish it.
Otherwise I will get finished.

557
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:55,338
Ramy, listen. Give me the cream.

558
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:04,537
Anwar, for the first time
I like someone's babbling.

559
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:11,879
Sir, isn't she too small?
- She is 25 years old.

560
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,355
I was talking about her height.

561
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,012
Delhi is not a good city.
Don't stay out late.

562
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:41,544
Anything may happen at anytime.

563
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:00,563
Good morning, DVD.

564
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:04,465
Pinky, you come so early.
- What do I do, madam?

565
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:05,600
I came 2 days before yesterday.

566
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:08,611
I rang the bell but
there was no response.

567
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:10,072
I came to the shop the
day before yesterday.

568
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:11,608
What do I do, if it was closed?

569
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,880
Madam, I think you have
forgotten the shop's address.

570
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:17,409
Shut up, I will bring the money.
- Bring 400 rupees.

571
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:19,613
Why 400. It's only 3 days.

572
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:22,619
Not 3 but 4 days. 400 for 4 days.

573
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:25,627
400 for 4 days. 300 for 3 days.

574
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,396
I am giving you 300 rupees.
I will talk to Mr. Sharma.

575
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:32,629
Madam. Police.

576
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:35,330
Pinky you have brought
the police for 100 rupees.

577
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:38,569
Pinky? Who is Pinky?
- Me.

578
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,241
His name is Pinky.
You look like Pappu.

579
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:47,576
You were yesterday...

580
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:51,109
Madam, I had repaired your
scooter yesterday. - Yes.

581
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:53,986
Madam, shall I wait or leave?
You are alone.

582
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:57,659
You can't trust these people
nowadays the TV people said.

583
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,589
Why have you come here?

584
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:01,927
Because the ACP has
called you to the station.

585
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:04,192
Why?

586
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:05,997
Because I have called
so many people for you.

587
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:14,001
Who was he? Recognize them.
I will kill them.

588
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:15,136
Recognize them.

589
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:21,348
I have seen him somewhere.

590
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:31,254
Him? No, it cannot be him.

591
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:33,120
He is local MLA (member of
Legislative Assembly) of our sector.

592
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:34,323
You have elected him.

593
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:38,697
He is arrested since the
last 2 months. It cannot be him.

594
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:46,702
This has been done
against our wishes, madam.

595
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:48,636
I am a banned journalist
from 'Jaago India' newspaper.

596
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,441
I will write about
it in the newspaper.

597
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:52,482
He has made me stand here.

598
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,042
Since then I've been hearing the same
thing. - He is eating our brains.

599
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,680
Shut up. Shut up.

600
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:01,251
So this is Delhi police.

601
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:07,229
If you call me here again or send
your wrestler friend to my home.

602
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:09,724
Then just watch what will happen.

603
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:13,697
It will be very bad.

604
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:21,204
This girl seems crazy.
You worked so hard and...

605
00:48:21,278 --> 00:48:25,305
She really seems crazy.
She called you a wrestler.

606
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:30,076
You are from 'Jaago India'.
Come I will wake you up.

607
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:33,749
Let me go. I will
call a press conference.

608
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:36,088
He isn't listening to me.

609
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,422
I will hold the press
conference for you today.

610
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:03,119
Are you driving a rickshaw
or a taxi? Sit straight.

611
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,112
At least I am sitting.

612
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:07,554
You know what has
happened to my bottom.

613
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,650
Rajkumar Santoshi has
come to make Ramayan.

614
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:11,319
I thought I should
audition for Ravan.

615
00:49:13,464 --> 00:49:15,056
I will play such a Ravan,
that they...

616
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:17,191
...will forget all
other movie villains.

617
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:20,399
Autograph. Photograph. Everything.

618
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:23,401
I will have such bank balance that
the bank won't be able to balance.

619
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:24,532
Believe it or not?

620
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:28,469
Yes, madam.

621
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:32,140
Where are you?
- Madam, I am at Rajgura road.

622
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:34,081
Then come to my place.

623
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:36,642
I have to send Kamini
to Janpath road house.

624
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,416
I can't trust anyone besides you.
- All right.

625
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,524
Kamini. Kumar. Brother Ballu,
the combination is nice.

626
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,823
Ballu, tell her to sit behind.
This face will touch her then.

627
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:02,236
Kamini.

628
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:05,373
Hi.

629
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:19,391
Come. - Bye, Kamini. -
This bitch is Kamini.

630
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:22,364
Shut up, you fool, Ravan.
Beware if you call her bitch.

631
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:24,726
She is dearer to me
than my younger sister.

632
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:28,535
The poor girl looks
so scared and nervous.

633
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:30,197
But why have you tied her mouth?

634
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:33,869
She is a bit
aggressive so she gets angry.

635
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:36,876
But Ballu take care of my Kamini.

636
00:50:36,947 --> 00:50:38,141
Yes, don't worry.

637
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:40,206
Bye Kamini. See you.

638
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:46,881
Do you like Kamini?

639
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,883
Fool, fool,
inauspicious, bitch Kamini.

640
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:53,890
Men are sleeping on footpath and
you are sitting inside the car.

641
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:58,225
If I tell Dharam brother he will
drink your blood as whisky, bitch.

642
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:05,566
What happened?

643
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:07,166
Why has your
villainous Laughter stopped?

644
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:09,506
Celebrate Dusshera today, Ballu.

645
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,241
Today Ravan is going
to be killed by a dog.

646
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:12,573
Stop the car.

647
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:16,412
What happened?

648
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,617
Have you bitten the bitch?

649
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:22,316
Hey move!

650
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:24,721
She is behind me.

651
00:51:26,663 --> 00:51:27,925
Why is the bitch after me?

652
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:29,794
Lord Ram will target me.

653
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:30,925
She is love with Ravan.

654
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:32,934
Hail Hanuman.

655
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:35,629
Hail Kapish.

656
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:40,472
Ballu. - You are ahead
with the bitch following.

657
00:51:42,546 --> 00:51:46,209
KK. Kumar and Kamini.
What a couple, friend?

658
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:48,479
She was running so
affectionately after you.

659
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:53,755
And you dumped her.
- Dear. Every dog has its day.

660
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:56,389
Your day will come too,
Ballu. Don't make fun of me.

661
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:01,889
Kumar, look.

662
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:06,961
The fraud. I won't spare her today.

663
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:09,730
Madam.

664
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,298
Not again.

665
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,969
You have crossed all limits.
You are great.

666
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:16,376
Give me my 420 rupees.
- What? - What?

667
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,310
See this Ravan. He is
my witness. Tell her.

668
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:22,752
You are the one who was
shouting ghost at the hospital.

669
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,446
I swear on you, I
won't call you ghost.

670
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:26,546
Tell me, if you are ghost or not?
- Just shut up.

671
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,851
I neither know you nor you.

672
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,620
Go from here, otherwise
I will call the police.

673
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:32,321
Call them. - What happened, madam?
- Who spoke?

674
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:34,261
These 2 were following me.

675
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,391
You girl...

676
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:38,932
Kiss?

677
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:40,629
Lick?

678
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:41,762
You tease girls.

679
00:52:42,673 --> 00:52:45,335
Will I tease girls in this dress?
Look at my condition, thug.

680
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,439
You are abusing me.

681
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:52,607
Thug is not an abuse.
- He is not abusing you.

682
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:54,412
His Hindi is weak so he
is not able to understand.

683
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:58,452
Weak?
- Your Hindi is weak. Not you.

684
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,825
We don't want money.
Come Ballu. Come Ballu.

685
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:09,023
Thank you, brother.
- Quietly come with us.

686
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:12,359
Loss!

687
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:15,304
He has changed the
direction of the dagger.

688
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,032
Catch her.

689
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,043
Hey, stop!

690
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:28,948
Hey, nab her!

691
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:36,459
Hey, stop!

692
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:01,579
Hello.
- Greetings.

693
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:09,619
Is this your father's shop
to close? What are you doing?

694
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:13,895
You will take this key
out from my wrapper, son.

695
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,959
They will beat you badly and
make hanky out of your wrapper.

696
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:21,630
What are you doing? We
had to escape from here.

697
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:22,831
Catch the fools.

698
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,765
Who had hit me?
- I am sorry.

699
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:25,597
You hit me.
- I was trying to save you.

700
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,739
But I am trying to save
you and you hit me. - Sorry.

701
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:32,172
I am sweating here
fighting to thugs and you hit me.

702
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,808
Look, I am fighting for
her and she is hitting me.

703
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:53,194
Never be a superman.

704
00:55:57,668 --> 00:55:58,726
Where is land?

705
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:03,097
What are you doing? It
is too high. Too high.

706
00:56:03,707 --> 00:56:05,698
If I fall from here I
will die. Definitely.

707
00:56:05,776 --> 00:56:07,073
Why are you fidgeting?

708
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:13,943
Move. Move. Fool, I will
cut your hair. Dirty man.

709
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:16,109
Hey you near dumb person.

710
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:18,177
Isn't this enough
that you are hitting us.

711
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:21,853
Call my mummy. I won't be
able to come home today.

712
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:23,217
Tell her I will visit
the hospital on the way.

713
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:25,557
Why did you quarrel with him?
- When did I quarrel?

714
00:56:26,129 --> 00:56:27,687
Is the girl related to you, fool?

715
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:30,232
Even you came after the girl.
- I just came to see.

716
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:33,560
Let us talk.

717
00:56:34,638 --> 00:56:35,764
And you shut the door
as soon as we entered.

718
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,897
Was that your shop?

719
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,673
We are swinging? What are you doing?

720
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:50,178
Catch me. I will die. Save.

721
00:56:53,924 --> 00:56:55,585
I don't know what
is happening to me.

722
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:00,529
That taxi driver is
always asking money from me.

723
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:05,090
His companion is scared
of me. He says I am ghost.

724
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:11,006
And when you left the hospital that
day I was attacked at the basement.

725
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:15,109
And today was the limit.
Some people wanted to kill me.

726
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:17,271
What? Oh my God.

727
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:25,280
If it was like that then why
didn't you tell the police?

728
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:28,256
No, don't approach the police.
They are just tension.

729
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,685
Don't worry. As it is aunt
is coming after the exams.

730
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:34,287
By the way, have you
prepared for your auditions?

731
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:38,624
I have recorded an interesting
voice. - Then practice it.

732
00:57:38,702 --> 00:57:39,964
Come on, guys. Pack up time.

733
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:59,815
'I am hot. You are hot.
It's really hot.'

734
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:04,321
'You take of your shirt while
I take off my jacket. Okay.'

735
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:16,968
Drive the car. I will follow.'
- 'Drive the car, friend. Driver.'

736
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:21,171
'She doesn't want you, friend.

737
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,878
'Right, I don't want you.'

738
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,187
'I want your heart.'

739
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:35,049
'You take of your shirt
while I take off my jacket.'

740
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:39,957
'I am hot. You are hot.
It's really hot.'

741
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,622
'You take of your shirt
while I take off my jacket.'

742
00:58:57,714 --> 00:59:00,774
'You take of your shirt while
I take off my jacket. Okay.'

743
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:10,385
Whose voice is this?
- Master's.

744
00:59:23,874 --> 00:59:25,034
Why were you making such a sound?

745
00:59:25,242 --> 00:59:27,972
I wasn't. It was coming out.

746
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:35,142
Are you a South Indian?

747
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:47,963
Where did you go after that? You.

748
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:50,699
I went home after that.

749
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:53,201
And then we went to
disco together on Saturday.

750
00:59:53,904 --> 00:59:56,873
Yes.
- After that.

751
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:01,704
After that the next
morning I went to the library...

752
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:07,080
...to return DVDs but it was closed.
- Then?

753
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:11,350
Then I returned to the society
and we went to watch movies.

754
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:14,788
There I met that taxi driver.
- One minute.

755
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:18,716
We went to movies on
Monday and not Sunday.

756
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:24,162
Monday. Maybe we went on Monday.

757
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:33,138
This means you went to disco
with Ritu on Sunday night.

758
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:35,473
No, sir. We went to the
disco on Saturday night.

759
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:40,308
And the movie.

760
01:00:40,817 --> 01:00:41,875
On Monday.

761
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:50,815
Then what did you do on Sunday?

762
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:54,495
Sunday. Sunday.

763
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:57,157
Sunday.

764
01:00:58,835 --> 01:00:59,893
I can't remember.

765
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:03,830
Sorry.

766
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:27,861
This means a day is
missing from your life. Sunday.

767
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:34,393
2 packets of milk.

768
01:01:39,009 --> 01:01:41,136
What kind of marks
are there on your neck?

769
01:01:44,881 --> 01:01:47,145
I was tired of ringing
the bell 3 days ago.

770
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:48,878
There was no response.

771
01:01:52,155 --> 01:01:53,554
We are going today.

772
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:57,155
'Not 3, 4 days. 400 for 4 days.'

773
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:52,609
Anwar!
- Sir!

774
01:02:52,949 --> 01:02:55,509
We need another photograph
to put up on this board!

775
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:57,010
Whose?

776
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:00,946
That stupid Sunday!

777
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,952
Sir, there are other
voices too besides madam's.

778
01:03:07,464 --> 01:03:09,625
This tape could be the
first link of this case, sir.

779
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:15,337
Not link... the reason to
begin the investigation.

780
01:03:16,573 --> 01:03:17,631
Send her in!

781
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:18,965
Okay, sir!

782
01:03:25,482 --> 01:03:29,418
Rajvir! I am helpless!

783
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:32,315
I don't remember anything.

784
01:03:34,324 --> 01:03:35,382
How could I forget?

785
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:43,922
In recent times have
you met somebody...

786
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,264
...whose behaviour is strange?

787
01:03:50,073 --> 01:03:51,131
Besides me.

788
01:03:57,013 --> 01:04:01,541
No, I mean... who claims to know you.

789
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:04,018
And you don't recognise him.

790
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:10,089
Yes. That cab driver and his friend.

791
01:04:15,965 --> 01:04:17,023
Cab driver!

792
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,234
Don Don Don Don 3!

793
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:28,510
Why? Shahrukh Khan is retiring?

794
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:30,979
No, he will be my papa
and I will be his son!

795
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:32,173
Don!

796
01:04:40,323 --> 01:04:41,984
This time if I am
cast for the film...

797
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:44,219
...then the mission of my
life will be achieved.

798
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:48,664
Your mission is not only difficult,
it's impossible!

799
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,061
You just drive! Don't talk!

800
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,003
Don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop!

801
01:04:55,338 --> 01:04:56,396
He will ask for my autograph!

802
01:04:56,472 --> 01:04:57,700
Where do you want to go?

803
01:04:58,341 --> 01:04:59,638
I thought the cab is empty!

804
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:03,008
It is! He holds no value! Come!
The seat is vacant!

805
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,445
Barah Khamba! Yes!
I will go anywhere!

806
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:37,103
Ballu!

807
01:05:38,248 --> 01:05:39,306
Yes! What happened?
- Hello!

808
01:05:40,717 --> 01:05:43,618
I think he is a gangster.
Tell him to get down.

809
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:45,111
What are you saying?

810
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:47,515
What?

811
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:50,791
No! We both are just talking! We
are just talking about good things!

812
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:52,617
It's good to talk sweetly.

813
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:54,795
He is dying of good talks!

814
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:56,797
What's the time?
- Time...

815
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:59,463
My watch is not working.
- Okay.

816
01:06:03,273 --> 01:06:04,570
Your time too is bad.

817
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:06,807
Strange! How do you know?

818
01:06:07,477 --> 01:06:08,535
I will just tell you!

819
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,150
Sir! Fare! You didn't pay the fare!

820
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:24,150
Inside!

821
01:06:27,664 --> 01:06:28,722
Come and take it!

822
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:30,357
Take it!
- Take it!

823
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:31,791
He is saying take it!

824
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,494
I think he is very harmful,
Ballu! Don't take it!

825
01:06:34,637 --> 01:06:37,162
Don't take it! Let it be!
We will go back!

826
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,171
No, Kumar! It's my fare! I need
money! I will have to take it!

827
01:06:41,244 --> 01:06:42,302
Ballu!

828
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:43,743
I will have to take the chance!

829
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:46,309
You are going inside alone?

830
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:49,107
Look, if I yell,
then Come to save me!

831
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:50,311
Fine. You whistle.

832
01:06:51,454 --> 01:06:54,855
Sir! Sir, my fare! Where are you?

833
01:06:58,461 --> 01:06:59,519
What?

834
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:01,458
You are wearing goggles and begging!

835
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:02,589
You are a hale and hearty man!

836
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:04,132
Go ahead! I am tense! Go ahead!

837
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:10,530
What are you doing?

838
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:11,865
I don't want to see!

839
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:14,267
Is somebody at home?

840
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:17,873
Who is it? It's you!
- It's me!

841
01:07:18,214 --> 01:07:19,704
I was just calling sir!
I didn't yell!

842
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:21,750
I didn't come willingly!
He brought me at gunpoint!

843
01:07:21,818 --> 01:07:23,217
Look! It's their gang!

844
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:27,280
Why did you close the door?

845
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:30,488
Don't come ahead! I will scream!

846
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,720
You will scream!
- I will scream!

847
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:32,852
I will scream!

848
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:34,897
Sir, rape is a
graver sin than murder!

849
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:36,425
It's a serious crime!

850
01:07:36,499 --> 01:07:38,660
I lovingly dropped you home!

851
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:40,293
And you are going to disgrace me!

852
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,167
Sir, I have to go for
Superman's audition.

853
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:44,468
Sir, it will spoil my reputation.
Talk from a distance.

854
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,598
Look, sir.

855
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:48,644
A man should stay
within his limits and work!

856
01:07:49,746 --> 01:07:51,714
I stay in my limits and work!
- Police! Ballu!

857
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:54,774
What police! This man is raping me!

858
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:55,909
From where do I bring the police?

859
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:57,452
Sir, ice-cream!
- To hell with the police!

860
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,578
Police! Police!

861
01:08:00,757 --> 01:08:03,191
Hey, see! This is called a true man!

862
01:08:03,526 --> 01:08:05,391
He is still standing!
Nothing has happened to him!

863
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:06,820
Sorry, sir!

864
01:08:07,263 --> 01:08:08,321
What is he made up of!

865
01:08:09,732 --> 01:08:11,700
I will shoot both
of you! Don't move!

866
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:13,531
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!
Look after the officer!

867
01:08:13,603 --> 01:08:14,661
Look after the officer!
Look after the officer!

868
01:08:14,737 --> 01:08:15,795
He is a policeman!

869
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:22,836
Say something!

870
01:08:25,548 --> 01:08:27,948
You... don't walk so much!
You will get tired!

871
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:31,213
If you had told us
that you are a policeman...

872
01:08:31,287 --> 01:08:32,811
...then this wouldn't have happened.
- Am I right?

873
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:35,621
We respect policeman a lot! I swear!

874
01:08:36,726 --> 01:08:38,887
My favourite game is police-thief!

875
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,853
My favourite song too
is based on the police!

876
01:08:41,297 --> 01:08:42,423
The horse went to the station.

877
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:43,556
There was a barber at the station.

878
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:44,861
The barber cut the horse's tail.

879
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:47,792
But Ballu, where is
the police in this?

880
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,235
The police was in the
guise of the barber.

881
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:54,710
I don't like chattering!
- Okay!

882
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:58,438
What I don't like?
- Chattering!

883
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:01,441
Do you know Sehar (City)?

884
01:09:01,584 --> 01:09:03,518
Very well! I know each street!

885
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,854
Go to Connaught Place, Bahar Khamba!

886
01:09:05,922 --> 01:09:07,583
I know each and every place!
- Shut up!

887
01:09:08,724 --> 01:09:09,816
I am talking about the girl.

888
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:12,521
You ask 420 rupees from her.

889
01:09:13,696 --> 01:09:14,822
She is a ghost! She is a ghost!

890
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:17,265
Sir, she has to pay me
my fare of 420 rupees!

891
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:18,732
She doesn't give it
to me! Now tell him!

892
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:20,268
How can I forget that night?

893
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:21,598
I had my play on that night.

894
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:22,729
The bat and the witch's roof!

895
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:31,008
Ballu, did you like my drama?

896
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:34,883
Your play is a hit!
It's a hit play! Great!

897
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:36,009
What are you saying?

898
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:38,616
Didn't you see
people laughing madly!

899
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:42,021
After a long time I
have laughed so much!

900
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:45,025
But this was a serious horror play!

901
01:09:47,964 --> 01:09:49,022
Really?
- Yes!

902
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,425
You know that! But
people don't know it!

903
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,735
Ballu!
- Yes! - Don't tell anybody!

904
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:57,966
No! Are you mad? You are my friend!

905
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,707
A girl!
- Don't stop!

906
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:05,307
She will run and catch it!
Is it a local train?

907
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:06,439
I will have to stop!

908
01:10:11,888 --> 01:10:13,549
Ma'am, where do you want to go?

909
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:14,988
Wherever you want to go!

910
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:17,826
Ma'am, seriously tell me!
Where do you want to go?

911
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:18,986
Straight!

912
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:21,723
Fine! Sit! We will go straight!

913
01:10:27,336 --> 01:10:30,931
Ma'am! Ma'am! You shouldn't
roam so late in the night!

914
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:33,669
It's Delhi! Where should I drop you?

915
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,469
Dance with delight!

916
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:37,604
Dance with delight!

917
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,806
Nice song! Dance with delight!

918
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:40,505
Dance with delight!
Dance with delight!

919
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,585
Dance with delight!

920
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:45,346
Dance with delight!

921
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,093
Dance with delight!

922
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:56,056
Ma'am, where do you want to go?

923
01:10:58,034 --> 01:10:59,092
Straight!

924
01:10:59,168 --> 01:11:01,500
That's what I am asking you!
Where do you want to go?

925
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:04,371
Straight! Right!

926
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:09,569
Left!

927
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:16,382
Sunday!

928
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:19,445
Straight!

929
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:20,614
Do one thing! Bite her!

930
01:11:25,394 --> 01:11:26,452
Sunday!

931
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:30,391
Sunday!
- Sunday!

932
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:35,461
Look, ma'am!

933
01:11:35,738 --> 01:11:37,399
For the past half an hour,
you have been...

934
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:38,872
...making me roam here and there!

935
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:43,636
My fare is 420! Where are you going?

936
01:11:45,414 --> 01:11:47,405
Ma'am!

937
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:48,875
Pay my fare!

938
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:52,409
Fool! Forget it! This girl is
goin g to give a current! Look!

939
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,141
Fair...

940
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:24,447
These fair cheeks.

941
01:12:27,456 --> 01:12:30,016
God...

942
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:31,457
God, it's great!

943
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:36,863
Fair...

944
01:12:36,932 --> 01:12:38,456
These fair cheeks.

945
01:12:41,203 --> 01:12:43,694
God...

946
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:45,001
God, it's great!

947
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:51,009
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

948
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,072
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

949
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:57,850
What did I do? What did I do?

950
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,481
What did I do? What did I do?

951
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:04,492
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

952
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:11,193
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

953
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:32,516
I got fooled by you.

954
01:13:32,722 --> 01:13:35,156
Such was your drama.

955
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:39,156
The jamboree begins at 12 o'clock.

956
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:42,119
There will be thrill.

957
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,663
Girl, stop it.

958
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:48,932
Otherwise I will
hang you on the noose.

959
01:13:49,872 --> 01:13:52,534
Fair...

960
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:53,734
These fair cheeks.

961
01:13:56,712 --> 01:13:59,237
God...

962
01:13:59,315 --> 01:14:00,543
God, it's great!

963
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:06,552
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

964
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:09,614
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

965
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:13,556
What did I do? What did I do?

966
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:16,894
What did I do? What did I do?

967
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:19,867
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

968
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:26,701
You have robbed me!
You have robbed me!

969
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,278
Come on! Come on!

970
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,814
How? First pay my fare!

971
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,683
First drop me!
- Again!

972
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:45,985
Where do you want to go?

973
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:48,628
This girl won't spare us!

974
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:01,599
Tell me where do you want to go?

975
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:04,345
And don't say out of Delhi!
Where do you want to go?

976
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:06,240
Drop me outside Delhi!

977
01:15:06,615 --> 01:15:07,877
What trouble is this!

978
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:09,611
Fool! Enough of her drama!

979
01:15:10,186 --> 01:15:11,244
Now it's your turn! Stop the car!

980
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:17,887
Look, girl! Do you know who we are?

981
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:23,621
In this locality...
recently a girl was murdered.

982
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,192
Suhasini Pradhan!

983
01:15:27,636 --> 01:15:29,365
We murdered that girl!

984
01:15:30,372 --> 01:15:32,636
Whether you believe or you don't.

985
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:44,984
We strangulated her until...
she writhe and died.

986
01:15:48,123 --> 01:15:50,648
Now do you know who we are?

987
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:57,655
Since when I was
searching for you both.

988
01:15:58,901 --> 01:15:59,959
Why?

989
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:02,669
Because I am that girl.

990
01:16:03,873 --> 01:16:05,170
Who?
- Suhasini Pradhan!

991
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,172
Whether you believe or you don't.

992
01:16:15,684 --> 01:16:16,742
You are scared, Ballu?

993
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:19,219
I am not scared! This is
how my face is at night!

994
01:16:20,322 --> 01:16:22,984
I have never noticed
it before. Let's leave!

995
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:28,695
Look... why are you joking with us?

996
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:34,293
Only humans joke!

997
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:38,237
Look... we will drop you
wherever you want to go.

998
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:41,306
Free of cost. Okay.
Where do you want to go?

999
01:16:43,946 --> 01:16:46,414
My favourite
weekend spot. Graveyard.

1000
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:51,013
Graveyard!
- It happened recently. - What?

1001
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,278
A girl's post-mortem.

1002
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:56,722
My soul entered her body.

1003
01:16:58,093 --> 01:17:02,052
The poor doctor... I
stabbed him with the scissor.

1004
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:05,999
And I strangulated him till
the time... - Till the time...

1005
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:07,763
Till the time his eyes
didn't pop out! - Ouch!

1006
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:09,895
Ouch!

1007
01:17:09,972 --> 01:17:12,133
Why is she making the noises twice?

1008
01:17:12,474 --> 01:17:16,001
Fool! We have two eyes!
- Yes! She has a point!

1009
01:17:16,145 --> 01:17:17,737
The doctor was covered with blood.

1010
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:18,871
I put him in the washing machine.

1011
01:17:18,948 --> 01:17:21,143
And I switched it on.
- God! God! God!

1012
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:26,749
Don't be scared, Ballu.

1013
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:30,816
Someday everybody has to die.
No need to be scared.

1014
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:34,757
I am scared. And you
are giving me discourses.

1015
01:17:35,764 --> 01:17:39,256
Look at me. My family.
My wife and children.

1016
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:42,236
I have nobody. I
have to start my family.

1017
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:45,869
Save me from this
washing machine ghost.

1018
01:17:45,941 --> 01:17:47,306
I don't want to die
a bachelor, Ballu.

1019
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:50,768
Yes. I too have to make my life.

1020
01:17:50,913 --> 01:17:51,971
Do something.

1021
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:55,783
Cross!
- What are you doing?

1022
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:57,785
In an English movie I
saw that a witch doctor...

1023
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:00,219
...scared away the
ghost with the cross.

1024
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:01,946
He was a witch doctor.
You are a driver.

1025
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:03,849
But the cross is the same.

1026
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:14,960
She ran away seeing the cross!

1027
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:18,500
Ghost, come in front of me!

1028
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:19,899
Why are you calling her?

1029
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:21,966
Am I scared of you!
I have the cross!

1030
01:18:22,144 --> 01:18:23,202
We will handle her later!

1031
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:26,176
Leave me! I will give her a slap!
- Get in!

1032
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:28,009
So what if she is a ghost?
I am not scared of her!

1033
01:18:28,183 --> 01:18:29,810
We will handle her later!
Don't worry, Ballu!

1034
01:18:32,054 --> 01:18:33,282
This is what happened that night.

1035
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:36,290
After that we saw her 2-3 times.

1036
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:38,019
We found out that
she is not a ghost.

1037
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,822
She was just fooling us!

1038
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:47,062
It means... everything happened.

1039
01:18:49,338 --> 01:18:50,396
And still nothing happened.

1040
01:18:50,839 --> 01:18:53,831
Sir, let us go. Catch that girl.

1041
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:54,967
That girl is very cunning.

1042
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:56,911
15-20 goons were after her.

1043
01:18:56,979 --> 01:19:00,847
Then we... got beaten
and somehow saved her.

1044
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:13,293
How do I believe... that you
both are speaking the truth?

1045
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:16,862
Sir, how can anybody
think of such a story?

1046
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:18,424
We are telling the truth.

1047
01:19:25,874 --> 01:19:29,241
Every morning at 8:30...
Dariyaganj police station.

1048
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:31,036
What?

1049
01:19:31,113 --> 01:19:32,273
Sir, 8:30 is the
time of my business.

1050
01:19:32,347 --> 01:19:33,871
Dariyaganj is far away.
It's a long distance.

1051
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:35,506
What are you doing?
Sir, let's do one thing.

1052
01:19:35,884 --> 01:19:37,545
We will lock both of
them in Dariyaganj prison.

1053
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,885
We will be there
by 8:30. No problem.

1054
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:41,888
Good.
- Okay.

1055
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,518
Dariyaganj!

1056
01:19:47,896 --> 01:19:50,330
Right!
- We will be there!

1057
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:52,427
If you won't leave,
then how will you come?

1058
01:19:52,901 --> 01:19:53,959
Correct!

1059
01:20:02,478 --> 01:20:05,914
So this is called the Red Fort!
- Yes, yes! Red Fort!

1060
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:10,008
This was built by... Jahangir,
Shah Jahan, Akbar, who built it?

1061
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:13,451
Workers! Workers and labourers!
Very good!

1062
01:20:13,655 --> 01:20:14,917
So why is it called the Red Fort!

1063
01:20:16,325 --> 01:20:17,917
Can't he see the colour red?

1064
01:20:18,327 --> 01:20:19,919
You know, in India
we love red colour!

1065
01:20:19,995 --> 01:20:21,053
Everything is red colour!

1066
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,188
Wedding, red colour!
Sari, red colour!

1067
01:20:22,264 --> 01:20:24,198
And red colour light!
Red King made it!

1068
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:25,528
You know! Very good King!
- Red King!

1069
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:28,195
Yeah! Tall, dark, handsome!
Red King!

1070
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:32,402
Whatever! So tell me, what's
so special about this place?

1071
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:34,233
Special?

1072
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:35,941
I will tell you! I will tell you!
Come here! Come here!

1073
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,069
You come this side! You come here!

1074
01:20:37,146 --> 01:20:38,545
You please don't do anything!
Thank you very much!

1075
01:20:38,614 --> 01:20:41,344
Come here! Thank you!
Don't move! Thank you! Yes.

1076
01:20:41,517 --> 01:20:42,677
Okay! Now shake hands!

1077
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:46,545
Exactly! Exactly like this!

1078
01:20:46,622 --> 01:20:48,089
Exactly like they shook hands...

1079
01:20:48,157 --> 01:20:49,624
...when they met here
for the first time!

1080
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:51,989
Who?
- Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi!

1081
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:56,656
But Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia
Gandhi met when they were abroad!

1082
01:20:56,965 --> 01:20:58,227
You know? You know?

1083
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,301
Who is the guide? You are
the guide or I am the guide?

1084
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:01,563
Who is right?
- No, no, no!

1085
01:21:01,637 --> 01:21:03,104
You are a strange man!

1086
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:06,269
You said Shah Jahan
built Kutub Minar!

1087
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:07,600
He did build it!

1088
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,268
Now if the
location's price increases...

1089
01:21:09,344 --> 01:21:10,402
...then the person has to sell it.

1090
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:12,708
I gave you the inside information.
And you are arguing with me.

1091
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:15,347
Fine! Today we will roam here.
- Fine.

1092
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:16,675
Then we will go.

1093
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:19,550
But tomorrow where will we go?

1094
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:21,979
Dariyaganj police station!
- Police station! Why?

1095
01:21:22,324 --> 01:21:23,985
Do you know Anarkali?
- Yes.

1096
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:26,483
Do you know her mother?
- No.

1097
01:21:27,563 --> 01:21:32,057
Anarkali's mother had filed the
first FIR against Akbar there!

1098
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:33,495
Wow! Honey, did you hear that?

1099
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:35,626
I heard that! Don't
call me honey! Money!

1100
01:21:36,004 --> 01:21:38,131
Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Let's go, honey!

1101
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:40,004
What tomorrow?
- Tomorrow!

1102
01:21:40,075 --> 01:21:41,133
You will eat today! And
you will pay tomorrow!

1103
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:43,402
Bhagat Singh did the right thing!

1104
01:21:43,545 --> 01:21:45,172
He beat them and made them flee!

1105
01:21:46,648 --> 01:21:47,706
They are also my source of business!

1106
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:56,317
Wow, ma'am! Now you
bring policemen too!

1107
01:21:57,593 --> 01:22:00,118
What you told Rajbir, is it true?

1108
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:02,087
It's absolutely true!

1109
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:05,223
I am sorry! Because of me,
you were troubled!

1110
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:09,026
I was not troubled!
I lost 420 rupees!

1111
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:10,629
I was beaten by the police!

1112
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,298
Every morning I have to go and...

1113
01:22:12,374 --> 01:22:13,432
...record my presence
at the police station!

1114
01:22:14,042 --> 01:22:15,771
I have to sit there for 2-3 hours.

1115
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:19,306
My work is suffering. It's
difficult to make both the ends meet.

1116
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:22,045
This is not a problem. I
am not troubled at all!

1117
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:24,051
I am sorry. But it's not my fault.

1118
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:27,054
So is it my fault? Do
I look like a thief?

1119
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:29,056
This is not so! But I
keep forgetting things!

1120
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:31,784
You forgot to pay my fare!

1121
01:22:33,295 --> 01:22:34,353
Keep forgetting!

1122
01:22:36,732 --> 01:22:37,790
Do you see this file?

1123
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:40,261
I have kidney problem!

1124
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:44,402
5 years ago I came
here from my village.

1125
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:48,576
My family thinks that I am
leading a comfortable life here.

1126
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:51,773
I have no problem! They
don't even know of this!

1127
01:22:53,749 --> 01:22:59,244
I have to gather each penny!
I need 4 lakhs! 4 lakhs!

1128
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:05,090
After every 15 days I
have to go for dialysis!

1129
01:23:06,094 --> 01:23:07,356
And I can't miss that!

1130
01:23:12,634 --> 01:23:16,627
Ma'am, my life has become cheap.

1131
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,468
And my survival
has become expensive!

1132
01:23:30,252 --> 01:23:32,117
I not only hope, but I know that...

1133
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:35,156
...all your problems
will be alleviated.

1134
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,183
Here is your money.

1135
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:42,287
Thank you.

1136
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:05,811
Hero!

1137
01:24:06,621 --> 01:24:07,679
The bar is close, sir!

1138
01:24:07,889 --> 01:24:11,154
But your mouth is open!
Did you see her?

1139
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:13,419
I don't do this business, sir!

1140
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:18,159
Shut up! He is our ACP,
sir. And she is sister-in-law.

1141
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:21,158
She is my sister-in-law!
Did you see her?

1142
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:25,598
Yes, sir! She had
come on Saturday night!

1143
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:28,171
She dances so well, sir!

1144
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:32,237
Go!

1145
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:39,185
Next time if you
closely observed a girl...

1146
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:43,190
...then from a bartender, I
will make you a bar dancer!

1147
01:24:45,193 --> 01:24:46,387
Answer what is asked from you!

1148
01:24:47,929 --> 01:24:49,191
Who was with her?

1149
01:24:50,332 --> 01:24:54,860
Ritu ma'am! And Hiren and
Dhaval sir too were with her!

1150
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:56,198
Hiren and Dhaval who?

1151
01:24:57,205 --> 01:25:00,197
Hiren and Dhaval... she went
out with both of them, sir.

1152
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:02,467
Where will we find them?

1153
01:25:02,544 --> 01:25:03,875
Sir, in our discotheque!

1154
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:05,873
They daily come at
around 11:00-11:30!

1155
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:27,861
Are you dancing or you
have a gun shot in your leg?

1156
01:25:28,303 --> 01:25:29,634
Sir, I am dancing!

1157
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:31,296
Sir!

1158
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:44,309
Dhaval!
- What?

1159
01:25:44,753 --> 01:25:45,845
Don't you think nowadays many...

1160
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:47,513
...weird people have
started visiting the disco?

1161
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:48,647
Yes, Hiren!

1162
01:25:48,723 --> 01:25:50,850
It's the fashion! Baywatch at home!

1163
01:25:50,926 --> 01:25:51,950
And gay watch at discos!

1164
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:58,258
Sir, they think we are gays!

1165
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:02,259
It's becoming our trademark! You...

1166
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:05,330
Leave!

1167
01:26:05,407 --> 01:26:06,465
We are not such kind of men!

1168
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:10,272
Don't touch me! What are you doing?

1169
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:13,270
This is the sin which
I commit every time!

1170
01:26:13,982 --> 01:26:16,280
I am a man. I love men.
- Come on!

1171
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:18,942
Help! Help!

1172
01:26:19,488 --> 01:26:22,389
Forgive me, sir.
- Forgive me.

1173
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:29,355
Sir, we will tell you everything!
We will tell you everything!

1174
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:30,931
Shut up!
- Quiet!

1175
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:34,298
So what have you thought,
Anwar? Tell me.

1176
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:36,633
I have never thought, sir!
- Why?

1177
01:26:37,873 --> 01:26:41,309
I don't want to progress
in this direction, sir!

1178
01:26:41,843 --> 01:26:44,710
Sir! Sir, I will tell
you everything clearly!

1179
01:26:44,913 --> 01:26:48,041
I will tell you everything, sir!
We belong to nice families, sir!

1180
01:26:48,483 --> 01:26:52,010
Sir, that night that girl...
that girl humiliated me, sir!

1181
01:26:52,454 --> 01:26:53,512
Hi, sexy!

1182
01:26:54,956 --> 01:26:56,014
You!

1183
01:26:59,628 --> 01:27:00,686
Destination!

1184
01:27:01,863 --> 01:27:02,921
Destination!

1185
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:06,333
I want you people
to get on the floor.

1186
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:08,335
Destination!

1187
01:27:08,403 --> 01:27:10,496
Destination!
- Get the party on!

1188
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,868
Come on! Come on!

1189
01:27:13,575 --> 01:27:14,769
People, listen to me.

1190
01:27:15,377 --> 01:27:16,901
This is the place to be.

1191
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:19,341
I gave 500 rupees to the bartender.

1192
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:21,549
And I mixed Raphtrol
drug in her drink!

1193
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:34,351
Excuse me!
- Okay! - Ma'am, your purse!

1194
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:36,396
Thank you!
- Ma'am, enjoy the party!

1195
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:38,023
- Thank you!

1196
01:27:41,369 --> 01:27:42,666
Sir, the drug was yielding effect.

1197
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,029
She started feeling dizzy.

1198
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:47,032
We took advantage of
it and took her with us.

1199
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:50,639
But as soon as we
reached the lobby...

1200
01:27:50,712 --> 01:27:51,872
...her uncle arrived there.

1201
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:53,870
Her uncle is a flirt, sir.

1202
01:27:54,382 --> 01:27:56,373
We were afraid that
leaving his two girls...

1203
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:57,748
...he might come after her.

1204
01:27:58,486 --> 01:28:00,852
So we left her there.
And we ran away, sir.

1205
01:28:02,424 --> 01:28:04,654
And when we returned, we
saw that nobody was there.

1206
01:28:05,393 --> 01:28:06,860
Sir, that girl disappeared.

1207
01:28:08,563 --> 01:28:10,656
And after that day we
never saw her again, sir.

1208
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:12,957
We gave that bartender some money.

1209
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:15,400
And he told her friend
that she has left for home.

1210
01:28:32,654 --> 01:28:34,485
Ma'am, where do you want to go?

1211
01:28:34,556 --> 01:28:35,614
Straight!

1212
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:37,419
Fine! Sit! We will go straight!

1213
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:48,493
Anwar!

1214
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:51,735
Ritu brought Sehar to the disco.

1215
01:28:53,174 --> 01:28:54,801
And she left with Hiren and Dhaval.

1216
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:59,441
And from here she
went in Ballu's cab.

1217
01:29:02,651 --> 01:29:07,054
I understand the story
till here. After that...

1218
01:29:07,188 --> 01:29:08,450
We will have to find out, sir!

1219
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:18,459
When you told me about
Hiren and Dhaval on the phone...

1220
01:29:18,533 --> 01:29:19,932
...I felt like killing them!

1221
01:29:21,469 --> 01:29:23,733
Nothing happened to you!
That is more important.

1222
01:29:25,874 --> 01:29:27,205
Now we have reached till here.

1223
01:29:28,476 --> 01:29:29,568
We will find out the later part too.

1224
01:29:39,854 --> 01:29:42,948
What do you do? What's its called...
cartoon character's...

1225
01:29:43,491 --> 01:29:44,788
Dubbing!
- Yes! Dubbing!

1226
01:29:46,961 --> 01:29:48,019
Mimic something for me.

1227
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:51,093
I have the script. Right
now I don't have the lines.

1228
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,895
I will give you the lines.
Repeat what I say! What to say?

1229
01:29:54,536 --> 01:29:56,936
What to say?
- What to say?

1230
01:29:58,206 --> 01:30:00,504
I mean...
- I mean!

1231
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:02,634
Let me think!
- Let me think!

1232
01:30:03,178 --> 01:30:04,509
Stop it!
- Stop it!

1233
01:30:05,714 --> 01:30:09,115
Look, I don't like chattering!
- Look, I don't like chattering!

1234
01:30:10,251 --> 01:30:12,879
I only like you!
- I only like you!

1235
01:30:13,755 --> 01:30:15,950
I love you!
- I love you!

1236
01:30:16,524 --> 01:30:17,582
I love you too!

1237
01:30:26,634 --> 01:30:27,692
What are you looking at me?

1238
01:30:44,652 --> 01:30:49,817
Don't hide what
lies in your heart.

1239
01:30:52,694 --> 01:30:57,290
Today let somebody
touch this heart.

1240
01:30:57,365 --> 01:31:00,562
Touch it.

1241
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:05,572
Dance in this merry ambience.

1242
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:06,698
Dance.

1243
01:31:08,676 --> 01:31:13,579
Kiss this earth and the sky.

1244
01:31:13,648 --> 01:31:16,116
Kiss it.

1245
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:22,917
You have to fall in love.
Let it happen.

1246
01:31:24,692 --> 01:31:29,595
We are not in our senses.
Let us lose ourselves.

1247
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:36,728
We are not in our senses.
Let us lose ourselves.

1248
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:38,602
Let us lose ourselves.

1249
01:31:40,742 --> 01:31:44,906
You have to fall in love.
Let it happen.

1250
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:48,312
Let it happen.

1251
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:09,933
Know the spoken
and unspoken words.

1252
01:32:13,174 --> 01:32:18,134
There is some dearth. Know it.

1253
01:32:21,149 --> 01:32:25,711
The one whom you call a stranger.

1254
01:32:25,787 --> 01:32:28,984
...A stranger.

1255
01:32:29,157 --> 01:32:34,823
He is your life partner. Hold him.

1256
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:42,668
You have to fall in love.
Let it happen.

1257
01:32:44,405 --> 01:32:48,671
We are not in our senses.
Let us lose ourselves.

1258
01:32:48,743 --> 01:32:50,938
Let us lose ourselves.

1259
01:32:52,780 --> 01:33:00,414
You have to fall in love.
Let it happen.

1260
01:33:10,732 --> 01:33:11,790
Sister-in-law has come?

1261
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:16,328
Had any work?

1262
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:18,863
I have found something
special in this tape, sir!

1263
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:21,703
Yes, POK.

1264
01:33:21,776 --> 01:33:22,970
When will I get the goods?

1265
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:24,769
The stock is getting over!

1266
01:33:27,715 --> 01:33:29,444
Who is this POK? I
have heard this name!

1267
01:33:29,517 --> 01:33:31,314
POK is the drug dealer!

1268
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:34,187
Ma'am, this is the
best quality drug!

1269
01:33:34,389 --> 01:33:37,153
You will go crazy!
It's out of this world!

1270
01:33:37,425 --> 01:33:39,950
Sniff it! Its one time great stuff!

1271
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:43,095
It looks okay! But the police
are quite strict these days!

1272
01:33:43,731 --> 01:33:48,100
Police! ACP here! DCP here!

1273
01:33:48,403 --> 01:33:49,734
I carry the police in my pockets!

1274
01:33:49,804 --> 01:33:50,862
Do you think we are pennies!

1275
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:54,834
What a nice co-incidence, POK!

1276
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:59,040
Your pocket and my gun.
Both are full.

1277
01:34:03,985 --> 01:34:05,043
Who is he?

1278
01:34:05,253 --> 01:34:08,848
Hi. I am ACP Rajvir Randhava!
- ACP!

1279
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:11,182
Assistant Computer Programmer.

1280
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:13,758
We sell goods through the internet!

1281
01:34:13,828 --> 01:34:14,886
Worldwide! International!

1282
01:34:15,129 --> 01:34:16,494
I will just talk to him. Excuse me.
- Okay.

1283
01:34:17,498 --> 01:34:21,457
Sir, last time too you
interfered in my illegal business.

1284
01:34:22,103 --> 01:34:24,071
Now let me sell my
goods to this foreigner.

1285
01:34:24,505 --> 01:34:25,767
I will pay you money.

1286
01:34:27,175 --> 01:34:29,405
I don't want money.
I want information.

1287
01:34:29,477 --> 01:34:30,774
What information?

1288
01:34:30,845 --> 01:34:34,246
Look, POK. For God,
we both are sinners.

1289
01:34:35,383 --> 01:34:38,079
Let's do one good deed.
It might reduce our sins.

1290
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:43,248
Yes, POK.

1291
01:34:43,324 --> 01:34:44,791
When will I get the goods?

1292
01:34:45,293 --> 01:34:46,988
The stock is getting over!
- Whose voice is this?

1293
01:34:47,395 --> 01:34:52,196
No! Tonight I have
hotter stuff than your goods!

1294
01:34:54,035 --> 01:34:55,093
Yes, POK.

1295
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:56,500
When will I get the goods?

1296
01:34:57,372 --> 01:34:58,430
The stock is getting over!

1297
01:34:59,273 --> 01:35:01,798
No! Tonight I have
hotter stuff than your goods!

1298
01:35:01,876 --> 01:35:02,934
He is Vatsal!

1299
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:05,470
What is your connection to him?

1300
01:35:05,546 --> 01:35:08,276
Of demand and supply! I
sell drugs and he buys it!

1301
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:10,213
He is famous
cardiologist Mr. Dilip's son.

1302
01:35:11,819 --> 01:35:13,878
ACP, I am cardiologist Mr. Dilip!

1303
01:35:13,955 --> 01:35:15,149
Vatsal is my son!

1304
01:35:15,356 --> 01:35:16,823
Nowadays more than the clinic...

1305
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:17,949
...I am making the rounds
of the police station.

1306
01:35:18,026 --> 01:35:20,426
How long will you
policemen harass us?

1307
01:35:23,831 --> 01:35:25,025
You are mistaken!

1308
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,232
This is the first time
that sir has called him.

1309
01:35:29,037 --> 01:35:32,029
Do you know this girl?
She is our sister-in-law!

1310
01:35:33,374 --> 01:35:34,432
My sister-in-law!

1311
01:35:36,177 --> 01:35:37,235
No!

1312
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:40,041
I am not asking you!
I am asking your son!

1313
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,247
No! I don't know her!

1314
01:35:45,853 --> 01:35:46,911
Sunday!

1315
01:35:52,393 --> 01:35:53,587
Tell us clearly.

1316
01:35:53,995 --> 01:35:56,862
Otherwise sir will thrash
you so badly that your father...

1317
01:35:56,931 --> 01:35:58,865
...will have to perform your
open heart surgery here itself!

1318
01:35:58,933 --> 01:36:00,059
Tell us!

1319
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:02,260
Sunday!

1320
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:10,268
Yes. I know this girl.

1321
01:36:12,013 --> 01:36:13,071
Sunday!

1322
01:36:14,215 --> 01:36:16,615
I have told you so many
times not to mess with girls!

1323
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:18,616
Do you remember what
happened last time!

1324
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,081
Her boyfriend is
still searching for you!

1325
01:36:22,223 --> 01:36:26,159
Forget it! If anything happens,
I will handle it!

1326
01:36:26,894 --> 01:36:27,952
Ghost, come in front of me!

1327
01:36:28,029 --> 01:36:29,087
Why are you calling her?

1328
01:36:29,163 --> 01:36:32,963
Am I scared of you! I
have the cross! - Get in!

1329
01:36:33,034 --> 01:36:35,628
Leave me! I will give her a slap!
- Get in!

1330
01:36:35,903 --> 01:36:39,430
So what if she is a ghost?
I am not scared of her!

1331
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:47,976
Stop! Stop!
- Now what happened?

1332
01:36:48,049 --> 01:36:49,107
Look there!

1333
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,115
Excuse me! Hello!

1334
01:36:55,923 --> 01:36:57,515
Want a lift?
- Lift!

1335
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:03,123
Where do you want to go?
- Wherever you want to go!

1336
01:37:03,197 --> 01:37:07,133
What's your name?
- My name? Sehar! S for Sehar!

1337
01:37:07,935 --> 01:37:10,927
She seems to be a
call girl. Do one thing.

1338
01:37:11,005 --> 01:37:13,940
Park the car in a lonely spot.
- Are you mad?

1339
01:37:14,008 --> 01:37:15,339
Did you forget what
happened last time?

1340
01:37:15,476 --> 01:37:17,000
We had to face the police too!

1341
01:37:17,078 --> 01:37:19,342
Will you do it
while driving the car?

1342
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:25,347
Yes! Let's make a programme!
Good idea!

1343
01:37:25,419 --> 01:37:26,681
Can I come behind?
- Yeah!

1344
01:37:33,294 --> 01:37:34,693
She is hot, man!

1345
01:37:35,096 --> 01:37:37,223
I am hot! You are hot!

1346
01:37:37,298 --> 01:37:40,358
It's really hot!
Isn't it really hot?

1347
01:37:40,434 --> 01:37:41,492
Hello!

1348
01:37:41,969 --> 01:37:43,027
Yes, POK.

1349
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:45,163
When will I get the goods?

1350
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:46,433
The stock is getting over!

1351
01:37:46,507 --> 01:37:49,169
You remove your shirt. I
will remove my jacket. Okay.

1352
01:37:49,243 --> 01:37:53,509
Tonight I have hotter
stuff than your goods!

1353
01:37:56,984 --> 01:37:59,452
Hey! You drive! I
will sit in the back!

1354
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,249
You drive! I will begin!

1355
01:38:01,589 --> 01:38:04,387
You drive, man!
- She doesn't want you!

1356
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:07,188
Right! I don't want you! Driver!

1357
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:08,319
Hey!

1358
01:38:09,063 --> 01:38:10,530
What do you think of yourself?

1359
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:14,259
Get out!

1360
01:38:14,535 --> 01:38:15,593
What are you doing?

1361
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:18,400
Hey! You don't praise her!
Sit in the car! Come on!

1362
01:38:18,472 --> 01:38:19,530
You too!

1363
01:38:22,009 --> 01:38:23,408
You are so short-tempered!

1364
01:38:24,412 --> 01:38:25,743
We don't get such chances everyday!

1365
01:38:26,414 --> 01:38:28,348
So? You should understand!

1366
01:38:30,084 --> 01:38:35,351
Fine! I understood!
First you! Now come on!

1367
01:38:35,423 --> 01:38:36,481
Take a U-turn! Please!

1368
01:38:37,558 --> 01:38:38,616
Okay!
- Yes!

1369
01:38:45,233 --> 01:38:46,427
She is nowhere to be seen!

1370
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,226
Where did she go?

1371
01:38:49,237 --> 01:38:51,034
Do one thing! You look there!
I will look here! Fine?

1372
01:38:51,105 --> 01:38:52,231
Okay!

1373
01:38:55,042 --> 01:38:57,442
After that I didn't
see that girl again!

1374
01:38:57,511 --> 01:39:00,105
And your friend... what about him?

1375
01:39:01,249 --> 01:39:03,240
His body was found the next morning!

1376
01:39:09,257 --> 01:39:10,315
Yes, ACP.

1377
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:12,449
The police are after him
for the past one week!

1378
01:39:13,127 --> 01:39:14,253
To interrogate him!

1379
01:39:14,328 --> 01:39:15,795
Who did it? When it happened?

1380
01:39:16,597 --> 01:39:18,258
My son is trapped in this, ACP.

1381
01:39:19,133 --> 01:39:21,067
Please! Please help us out!

1382
01:39:23,337 --> 01:39:25,271
Where did this incident occur?

1383
01:39:26,407 --> 01:39:27,465
South Avenue!

1384
01:40:10,117 --> 01:40:14,520
That night... the two
guys who gave you a lift...

1385
01:40:15,523 --> 01:40:17,320
...one of them was
murdered that same night!

1386
01:40:18,326 --> 01:40:19,384
What!

1387
01:40:21,662 --> 01:40:26,122
The police think that
some girl has murdered him!

1388
01:40:31,138 --> 01:40:35,268
The police think so.
But I don't think so.

1389
01:40:39,146 --> 01:40:41,671
Why do the police think
that a girl has murdered him?

1390
01:40:44,151 --> 01:40:47,416
Because near the dead body...
a bracelet has been found.

1391
01:40:49,156 --> 01:40:50,748
That's why... but...

1392
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,217
The police think so.

1393
01:40:56,163 --> 01:40:57,221
I...

1394
01:40:58,165 --> 01:41:02,295
As it is you don't
wear bracelet! Do you?

1395
01:41:07,174 --> 01:41:09,233
This... can't be yours!

1396
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:14,511
'This bracelet will match
perfectly with the dress.'

1397
01:41:20,187 --> 01:41:21,779
This... is mine.

1398
01:41:24,725 --> 01:41:26,192
It means I have
committed the murder...

1399
01:41:27,728 --> 01:41:28,786
How can I?

1400
01:41:30,197 --> 01:41:31,528
If I have committed the murder...

1401
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:34,193
...then I will be punished, Rajvir.

1402
01:41:35,202 --> 01:41:38,729
Don't worry, Sehar.
Nothing will happen to you.

1403
01:41:40,341 --> 01:41:41,535
I am scared, Rajvir!

1404
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:53,616
Don't worry. This is
what the police think.

1405
01:41:57,224 --> 01:41:58,282
But not me.

1406
01:42:10,571 --> 01:42:16,237
Till the time God exists...

1407
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:21,304
...my name will exists in your heart.

1408
01:42:22,716 --> 01:42:24,775
Allah wills!

1409
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:27,652
Allah wills you keep quiet!

1410
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:29,313
Otherwise there will be an
accident! What are you doing?

1411
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:30,652
Now I won't keep quiet, Ballu!

1412
01:42:31,325 --> 01:42:32,849
After a long time I
have found a formula.

1413
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:34,318
I have found my principle!

1414
01:42:34,862 --> 01:42:37,330
Now I will myself compose
the song, and sing it myself!

1415
01:42:37,398 --> 01:42:38,990
I will myself act. I
will be on the screen!

1416
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:40,858
You only watch the movie!
Nobody else will watch it!

1417
01:42:42,269 --> 01:42:43,668
Let's rock! Hail Goddess!

1418
01:42:44,271 --> 01:42:46,330
Let's rock! You will
be beaten with rocks!

1419
01:42:46,407 --> 01:42:47,465
I and other people will beat you!

1420
01:42:48,342 --> 01:42:50,003
God's play is so strange!

1421
01:42:51,278 --> 01:42:54,338
The one who acts... he
doesn't get the chance to act.

1422
01:42:54,415 --> 01:42:56,007
And the one who has
good body, he gets to act.

1423
01:42:56,283 --> 01:42:58,342
The one who composes songs,
he gets to act.

1424
01:42:59,286 --> 01:43:01,345
I can't build my body now.
But I will sing.

1425
01:43:01,822 --> 01:43:04,347
I will come on the screen.
And I will become a hero.

1426
01:43:04,825 --> 01:43:05,883
Watch this!

1427
01:43:06,894 --> 01:43:11,354
Loneliness!

1428
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,827
Loneliness!

1429
01:43:14,902 --> 01:43:16,028
Shut up!

1430
01:43:16,303 --> 01:43:17,361
Get out!
- Okay!

1431
01:43:17,438 --> 01:43:19,838
Come out! I will take you
to a mental asylum! Get out!

1432
01:43:21,709 --> 01:43:24,371
Your fare, your paper and your car!
You can keep everything!

1433
01:43:24,445 --> 01:43:25,503
I don't even want your friendship.

1434
01:43:26,714 --> 01:43:29,512
Even after selling your car, I
can't become a Bhojpuri pop star!

1435
01:43:31,318 --> 01:43:32,376
What is this?
- Is this a fight?

1436
01:43:32,453 --> 01:43:33,715
Is it about you?
- No!

1437
01:43:33,787 --> 01:43:34,845
Get lost!

1438
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:38,858
First you decide! Do you
want to be an actor or a singer?

1439
01:43:38,926 --> 01:43:40,393
I want to be a singing actor!

1440
01:43:40,461 --> 01:43:42,395
What is this? Singer is a singer!

1441
01:43:42,463 --> 01:43:43,521
And an actor is an actor!

1442
01:43:43,597 --> 01:43:44,655
I will sing and act too!

1443
01:43:44,732 --> 01:43:45,790
To become an actor,
you have to be an actor!

1444
01:43:45,866 --> 01:43:46,924
To become a singer, you
have to be a singer! And you!

1445
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:48,733
The one who is on the screen,
he is an actor!

1446
01:43:48,802 --> 01:43:50,861
How is that possible?
Even monkeys come on screen!

1447
01:43:50,938 --> 01:43:53,406
Look! We both are discussing this!

1448
01:43:56,343 --> 01:43:57,401
Who is he?

1449
01:43:59,747 --> 01:44:01,738
His face seems familiar!

1450
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,875
He is the same man
whose speech is weird!

1451
01:44:05,953 --> 01:44:07,079
Good that he is quiet!

1452
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:12,415
Don't mind! Run! Hurry up!

1453
01:44:12,493 --> 01:44:13,551
Greetings!

1454
01:44:13,894 --> 01:44:15,885
Greetings!

1455
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:18,364
Greetings!

1456
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,490
These 20-21 people will beat you!

1457
01:44:19,567 --> 01:44:20,761
I too will beat you! Sit in the car!

1458
01:44:20,834 --> 01:44:21,892
Hang on!

1459
01:44:22,369 --> 01:44:23,427
Sit!

1460
01:44:23,771 --> 01:44:25,762
Greetings!

1461
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:30,434
Brother! They ran away!

1462
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:34,438
Car!

1463
01:44:34,515 --> 01:44:35,777
Come on!
- Catch the car!

1464
01:44:35,849 --> 01:44:36,907
Car!

1465
01:44:38,385 --> 01:44:39,443
Lift! Lift!

1466
01:44:40,387 --> 01:44:41,786
You!
- You!

1467
01:44:41,855 --> 01:44:43,379
Will you go to Chandni Chowk?

1468
01:44:43,457 --> 01:44:44,583
I will go! Do you also want to come?

1469
01:44:44,658 --> 01:44:46,455
Yes!
- Get in! Get in! Get in!

1470
01:44:46,527 --> 01:44:48,461
O my God! O my God! O my God!

1471
01:44:48,529 --> 01:44:49,791
Give me smile! Give me smile!

1472
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,459
Quickly! Quickly! Hold this!

1473
01:44:55,803 --> 01:44:58,601
Why do you drive like this,
left and right?

1474
01:44:58,672 --> 01:45:00,469
Fool! Look behind! Look behind!

1475
01:45:04,411 --> 01:45:05,605
Is this a race?

1476
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,943
It's not a race!
They want to beat us!

1477
01:45:08,015 --> 01:45:12,543
Beat? O my God! They are
catching on! Drive fast!

1478
01:45:15,422 --> 01:45:16,480
Sunday!

1479
01:45:20,427 --> 01:45:21,485
Sunday!

1480
01:45:25,566 --> 01:45:26,624
Sunday!

1481
01:45:30,571 --> 01:45:34,769
Rajvir, look! Goons are
after us! Please save us!

1482
01:46:03,937 --> 01:46:04,995
Sunday!

1483
01:46:10,611 --> 01:46:12,078
Sunday!

1484
01:46:41,642 --> 01:46:42,700
Sunday!

1485
01:47:29,623 --> 01:47:30,749
Run! Run! Run!

1486
01:47:34,027 --> 01:47:35,085
Hey, wait for me.

1487
01:47:37,097 --> 01:47:38,621
Nab them!
- Come on!

1488
01:47:43,971 --> 01:47:45,563
You fools. Nab them.

1489
01:47:45,639 --> 01:47:47,766
Nab them. They
shouldn't escape. Nab them.

1490
01:47:56,116 --> 01:47:58,641
Brother! Why is he laughing?

1491
01:48:01,588 --> 01:48:03,317
The shock has made him insane!

1492
01:48:03,924 --> 01:48:05,323
I am not mad! You are mad!

1493
01:48:05,592 --> 01:48:08,322
The music director here! And
the inspector behind! Look!

1494
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:18,729
Run!

1495
01:48:18,806 --> 01:48:19,864
Sunday.

1496
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:21,669
Sunday.

1497
01:49:36,216 --> 01:49:37,274
Name?

1498
01:49:39,019 --> 01:49:40,077
Asim Bajaj!

1499
01:49:41,154 --> 01:49:42,212
Father's name?

1500
01:49:44,691 --> 01:49:46,886
Not mother's name! Father's name!

1501
01:49:47,694 --> 01:49:51,221
Exactly! Pastor Bajaj!
He is a school teacher!

1502
01:49:53,166 --> 01:49:54,224
From where?

1503
01:49:55,836 --> 01:49:56,894
Darjeeling!

1504
01:49:58,772 --> 01:49:59,830
Door!

1505
01:50:00,707 --> 01:50:01,765
Darbanga! Bihar!

1506
01:50:01,842 --> 01:50:03,104
So say that, fool!

1507
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:05,439
Now quickly adjust your speech!

1508
01:50:05,846 --> 01:50:08,974
And quickly tell me! Why do
you want to kill the girl?

1509
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:15,454
A guy gave me 5 lakhs!
With the girl's photo.

1510
01:50:16,256 --> 01:50:18,918
On the phone he said...
to kill the girl.

1511
01:50:19,927 --> 01:50:20,985
Who is that guy?

1512
01:50:22,930 --> 01:50:24,454
I never saw him, sir!

1513
01:50:25,999 --> 01:50:28,126
He calls from the PCO!

1514
01:50:29,937 --> 01:50:31,131
I think it is his call.

1515
01:50:35,275 --> 01:50:37,800
Say what I say!

1516
01:50:42,082 --> 01:50:45,279
Tonight the girl is going
to come to Caravan disco.

1517
01:50:46,153 --> 01:50:51,955
We will abduct her from there.
You too come there.

1518
01:50:56,029 --> 01:50:59,157
Raphtrol. It's
famously known as date rape.

1519
01:51:00,767 --> 01:51:02,758
After taking this you
don't remember anything...

1520
01:51:02,836 --> 01:51:03,962
...for 10-15 hours.

1521
01:51:05,772 --> 01:51:08,172
Because of this drug,
many girls have been raped.

1522
01:51:09,843 --> 01:51:12,778
That's why our government and
the police always give the warning.

1523
01:51:13,914 --> 01:51:15,779
Never take a drink from a stranger.

1524
01:51:17,784 --> 01:51:19,376
Hiren and Dhaval gave you this drug.

1525
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,788
And in the intoxication of
this drug, I committed a murder.

1526
01:51:24,791 --> 01:51:25,849
A murder has been committed.

1527
01:51:26,994 --> 01:51:29,519
But not you, somebody
else has committed it.

1528
01:51:31,798 --> 01:51:33,527
And maybe you are the witness.

1529
01:51:34,334 --> 01:51:35,858
That's why you are been attacked.

1530
01:51:37,137 --> 01:51:38,866
But Rajvir, I don't
remember anything!

1531
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:41,533
You know this. He doesn't.

1532
01:51:43,076 --> 01:51:46,807
Tonight he will come to
Caravan disco. To kill you.

1533
01:51:52,819 --> 01:51:55,549
No need to fear. We will catch him.

1534
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,822
No need to fear.

1535
01:52:04,965 --> 01:52:06,023
Go.

1536
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,432
It's dangerous to take
sister-in-law there, sir.

1537
01:52:17,244 --> 01:52:20,975
I know, Anwar. But we
don't have any other option.

1538
01:52:22,849 --> 01:52:26,046
Now we have to see...
Who comes there.

1539
01:53:01,088 --> 01:53:04,080
There are so many faces.

1540
01:53:05,158 --> 01:53:08,491
The secrets are deep.

1541
01:53:09,496 --> 01:53:12,624
The twilight is dark.

1542
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:17,097
Doubts are many.

1543
01:53:18,038 --> 01:53:21,098
There are moving shadows.

1544
01:53:22,442 --> 01:53:25,172
Steps are still.

1545
01:53:26,179 --> 01:53:30,309
Steps are still.

1546
01:53:31,918 --> 01:53:33,442
What dilemma is this!

1547
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,454
What dilemma is this!

1548
01:53:35,922 --> 01:53:37,981
What dilemma is this!

1549
01:53:38,058 --> 01:53:39,923
What dilemma is this!

1550
01:53:40,327 --> 01:53:41,988
What dilemma is this!

1551
01:53:42,262 --> 01:53:44,127
What dilemma is this!

1552
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:46,523
What dilemma is this!

1553
01:53:46,933 --> 01:53:49,265
What...

1554
01:53:58,945 --> 01:54:01,470
There are so many faces.

1555
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:05,550
The secrets are deep.

1556
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:10,355
The twilight is dark.

1557
01:54:11,558 --> 01:54:14,356
Doubts are many.

1558
01:54:16,163 --> 01:54:18,563
There are moving shadows.

1559
01:54:20,167 --> 01:54:23,159
Steps are still.

1560
01:54:24,104 --> 01:54:28,097
Steps are still.

1561
01:54:29,976 --> 01:54:31,170
What dilemma is this!

1562
01:54:31,311 --> 01:54:33,370
What dilemma is this!

1563
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,379
What dilemma is this!

1564
01:54:35,982 --> 01:54:37,574
What dilemma is this!

1565
01:54:38,251 --> 01:54:39,718
What dilemma is this!

1566
01:54:40,187 --> 01:54:42,052
What dilemma is this!

1567
01:54:42,522 --> 01:54:44,183
What dilemma is this!

1568
01:54:44,591 --> 01:54:46,718
What...

1569
01:55:31,238 --> 01:55:35,106
Desires are careless, aimless.

1570
01:55:35,642 --> 01:55:39,169
The heart is young
with nameless desires.

1571
01:55:40,046 --> 01:55:43,641
Uncontrollable,
impatient, nameless.

1572
01:55:44,317 --> 01:55:48,048
Where will the
killer's gaze go still?

1573
01:55:48,388 --> 01:55:52,188
God knows who is so careless.

1574
01:55:53,059 --> 01:55:56,654
Listen, o ignorant.
This night is long.

1575
01:55:59,132 --> 01:56:00,656
What dilemma is this!

1576
01:56:01,067 --> 01:56:02,796
What dilemma is this!

1577
01:56:03,336 --> 01:56:05,133
What dilemma is this!

1578
01:56:05,205 --> 01:56:07,264
What dilemma is this!

1579
01:56:08,074 --> 01:56:09,336
What dilemma is this!

1580
01:56:09,609 --> 01:56:11,474
What dilemma is this!

1581
01:56:11,544 --> 01:56:12,602
What...

1582
01:56:14,214 --> 01:56:15,272
Rajvir!

1583
01:56:23,223 --> 01:56:24,281
Rajvir!

1584
01:56:31,631 --> 01:56:33,098
Why do you want to kill me?

1585
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:35,158
What dilemma is this!

1586
01:56:35,235 --> 01:56:37,169
What dilemma is this!

1587
01:56:37,637 --> 01:56:39,104
What dilemma is this!

1588
01:56:39,172 --> 01:56:41,106
What dilemma is this!

1589
01:56:41,441 --> 01:56:42,840
What dilemma is this!

1590
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:44,701
What dilemma is this!

1591
01:56:45,178 --> 01:56:46,509
What dilemma is this!

1592
01:56:47,113 --> 01:56:50,514
What...

1593
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:55,511
There are so many faces.

1594
01:56:55,588 --> 01:56:56,646
Leave me!

1595
01:56:57,324 --> 01:56:59,383
The secrets are deep.

1596
01:57:01,261 --> 01:57:03,320
The twilight is dark.

1597
01:57:05,131 --> 01:57:07,326
Doubts are many.

1598
01:57:08,735 --> 01:57:11,397
There are moving shadows.

1599
01:57:12,472 --> 01:57:14,736
Steps are still.

1600
01:57:15,742 --> 01:57:18,734
Steps are still.

1601
01:57:30,357 --> 01:57:31,688
What dilemma is this!

1602
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:33,682
What dilemma is this!

1603
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:35,422
What dilemma is this!

1604
01:57:35,695 --> 01:57:37,356
What dilemma is this!

1605
01:57:38,164 --> 01:57:39,358
What dilemma is this!

1606
01:57:39,566 --> 01:57:41,363
What dilemma is this!

1607
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:43,225
What dilemma is this!

1608
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:47,363
What...

1609
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,381
Rajvir! Rajvir!

1610
01:58:29,416 --> 01:58:34,410
ACP Rajvir! What is...
what is going on?

1611
01:58:59,779 --> 01:59:05,775
Minister's son! Illegal work!
Still you claim to be an Indian!

1612
01:59:11,724 --> 01:59:14,249
The murder which was
committed at South Avenue...

1613
01:59:14,327 --> 01:59:16,261
...your son committed it!

1614
01:59:20,266 --> 01:59:24,327
What nonsense! Why
will I murder anybody?

1615
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:26,329
I didn't commit any murder!

1616
01:59:26,406 --> 01:59:30,866
Fine! If you won't speak up,
then this girl will say it!

1617
01:59:35,815 --> 01:59:40,548
What rubbish! Dad!
Dad, what's happening?

1618
01:59:41,287 --> 01:59:43,346
What is going on? I
don't know anything, dad!

1619
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:46,349
Who is she? I don't know this girl!

1620
01:59:46,426 --> 01:59:50,692
Sir... this girl saw your
son committing the murder!

1621
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:57,295
Did you really... really see...

1622
01:59:57,370 --> 02:00:01,306
...him committing the murder?

1623
02:00:07,914 --> 02:00:10,508
Yes! He murdered Sanjay!

1624
02:00:16,456 --> 02:00:17,514
What do you say now?

1625
02:00:18,525 --> 02:00:21,323
If you confessed in
front of the media...

1626
02:00:21,394 --> 02:00:23,328
...then your
sentence might be reduced.

1627
02:00:25,331 --> 02:00:27,856
Otherwise I have other ways
to make you spill the truth!

1628
02:00:33,873 --> 02:00:34,931
Yes!

1629
02:00:36,743 --> 02:00:39,541
Yes! Yes! I committed the murder!

1630
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:45,411
I murdered Sanjay!

1631
02:00:49,355 --> 02:00:50,754
And Suhasini Pradhan too!

1632
02:00:57,897 --> 02:01:03,426
Suhasini... loved my money, not me!

1633
02:01:05,772 --> 02:01:07,706
She had an affair with Sanjay!

1634
02:01:17,717 --> 02:01:18,775
But...

1635
02:01:27,527 --> 02:01:31,520
And that night...
that night I saw Sanjay.

1636
02:01:32,732 --> 02:01:37,726
He... he was with this girl.

1637
02:01:40,473 --> 02:01:43,465
You see there. I will
see here. Okay. - Fine!

1638
02:01:47,013 --> 02:01:53,009
Twinkle twinkle little star!

1639
02:01:55,421 --> 02:01:57,821
Hi!
- Hi!

1640
02:01:58,424 --> 02:02:02,622
Twinkle twinkle little star!

1641
02:02:03,763 --> 02:02:09,963
Twinkle
- Twinkle little star!

1642
02:02:10,637 --> 02:02:16,041
How I wonder what...
- Where you are!

1643
02:02:26,786 --> 02:02:27,844
You won't reform!

1644
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,515
What to do? Delhi
girls don't leave me!

1645
02:02:32,659 --> 02:02:35,856
One was your girlfriend.
Now this girl.

1646
02:02:37,997 --> 02:02:40,522
Why did you and
Suhasini do this with me?

1647
02:02:42,001 --> 02:02:43,525
Because you couldn't do anything!

1648
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:45,528
So I did it! Move!

1649
02:03:32,518 --> 02:03:36,648
I didn't leave behind
any witness or evidence.

1650
02:03:38,991 --> 02:03:40,049
Besides her.

1651
02:03:42,528 --> 02:03:45,122
I didn't have any
personal enmity with her.

1652
02:03:47,867 --> 02:03:50,062
But it was important to kill her.

1653
02:03:51,671 --> 02:03:56,074
Yes! Yes! I killed Sanjay!

1654
02:03:57,143 --> 02:04:00,271
I killed... I killed Suhasini!

1655
02:04:18,564 --> 02:04:23,160
ACP Rajvir... arrest him!

1656
02:04:25,037 --> 02:04:26,095
Dad!

1657
02:04:36,582 --> 02:04:38,777
I am sorry. Because
of me you people...

1658
02:04:38,851 --> 02:04:39,977
You are great, ma'am!

1659
02:04:40,052 --> 02:04:41,986
In the car, you made
such strange noises.

1660
02:04:42,054 --> 02:04:44,113
That hearing it even Ram
Gopal Verma will get scared.

1661
02:04:45,858 --> 02:04:48,793
Why are you so sad? What happened?

1662
02:04:49,662 --> 02:04:50,720
What to tell you, sir?

1663
02:04:52,131 --> 02:04:54,656
From Connaught place I
drove to Chanakyapuri.

1664
02:04:54,734 --> 02:04:56,668
I wasted my petrol.
My heart is heavy.

1665
02:04:56,736 --> 02:04:58,601
I don't know what all
things I have to endure.

1666
02:04:58,671 --> 02:05:00,605
I won't get the money. Let it be.

1667
02:05:00,673 --> 02:05:02,140
Don't worry.

1668
02:05:02,809 --> 02:05:04,606
The police, pleased
with both of your work...

1669
02:05:04,677 --> 02:05:06,338
...have given a reward of 5 lakhs.

1670
02:05:06,612 --> 02:05:08,603
What are you saying, sir? Great!

1671
02:05:08,681 --> 02:05:10,672
Just joking! Just joking!

1672
02:05:15,021 --> 02:05:16,352
Raj, a murder was committed.

1673
02:05:16,956 --> 02:05:19,015
We found out who did it and how.

1674
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:22,684
But... how did I
reach home that night?

1675
02:05:23,629 --> 02:05:24,687
Sister-in-law!

1676
02:05:26,966 --> 02:05:28,627
He will answer your question.

1677
02:06:08,207 --> 02:06:10,869
That's why I used to tell you
not to roam out late in the night.

1678
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:14,938
Take care.

1679
02:06:17,817 --> 02:06:19,682
And because of that
intoxicating drink...

1680
02:06:19,752 --> 02:06:21,413
...you slept the whole
day and the whole night.

1681
02:06:22,221 --> 02:06:25,088
That's why... your
Sunday was missing.

1682
02:06:26,292 --> 02:06:29,284
O my God! So many
incidents together!

1683
02:06:30,229 --> 02:06:31,890
You know, Raj! I
have taken the decision!

1684
02:06:32,698 --> 02:06:34,689
Instead of making rounds of
the police station everyday...

1685
02:06:34,767 --> 02:06:36,758
...I will marry a policeman.

1686
02:06:36,836 --> 02:06:39,100
One is sitting near you.

1687
02:06:40,106 --> 02:06:43,098
But there is a problem, Anwar.
- What?

1688
02:06:44,043 --> 02:06:45,101
He takes bribe!

1689
02:06:46,712 --> 02:06:50,910
I used to take it. Now I am
a simple, sweet, sober man.

1690
02:06:51,717 --> 02:06:52,775
I am a policeman later.

1691
02:06:53,252 --> 02:06:54,719
First I am a human being. Remember?

1692
02:06:55,254 --> 02:06:59,782
Now only you, me... and honesty.

1693
02:06:59,859 --> 02:07:01,724
Sir, it's the
double of what you said!

1694
02:07:06,732 --> 02:07:07,790
You give me bribe!

1695
02:07:08,935 --> 02:07:10,800
You bribe a policeman!
- But you take bribe!

1696
02:07:10,870 --> 02:07:11,928
Do you know it's a big crime!

1697
02:07:12,271 --> 02:07:14,136
Rajvir!
- You came at the wrong time!

1698
02:07:14,206 --> 02:07:15,730
They don't let a
person live honestly...

1699
02:07:17,743 --> 02:07:21,941
I don't like chattering!
What I don't like?

1700
02:07:24,216 --> 02:07:26,343
Chattering!

1701
02:07:27,153 --> 02:07:30,816
You don't like it?
- No.

1702
02:07:31,891 --> 02:07:32,949
Let's go!

1703
02:07:33,025 --> 02:07:34,822
'ACP Rajvir Gandava married Sehar.'

1704
02:07:34,894 --> 02:07:35,952
'That too on a Sunday.'

1705
02:07:36,162 --> 02:07:39,757
And yes, he has...
stopped taking bribe.'

1706
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:43,029
'Ballu's life too
is going smoothly.'

1707
02:07:43,769 --> 02:07:45,498
'His kidney
operation was a success.'

1708
02:07:46,172 --> 02:07:49,767
And Ballu, who used to take
20 passengers in his car...

1709
02:07:49,842 --> 02:07:51,776
...he now owns 20 cars.'

1710
02:07:55,781 --> 02:07:58,773
And I Kumar, Kumar Mangat,
I became a star.'

1711
02:07:58,851 --> 02:08:01,183
'A super star... of Bhojpuri movies.'

1712
02:08:01,787 --> 02:08:02,981
Take 84!

1713
02:08:03,055 --> 02:08:05,523
Kiss! Kiss!

1714
02:08:05,791 --> 02:08:09,852
Give me a kiss!

1715
02:08:09,929 --> 02:08:12,329
And make me yours.

1716
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:16,134
Give me a kiss!

1717
02:08:16,802 --> 02:08:19,396
And make me yours.

1718
02:08:34,353 --> 02:08:35,820
My T-shirt, fool!

1719
02:08:41,827 --> 02:08:44,352
Along with your mouth, all the
gaps in your body! One more take!

1720
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:47,092
It's a new story.
And a new story! O no!

1721
02:08:47,166 --> 02:08:48,224
Throw the idiotic script!

1722
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:56,899
You know what she says?

1723
02:08:58,978 --> 02:09:00,036
Sunday!

1724
02:09:02,314 --> 02:09:03,372
Sunday!

1725
02:09:05,451 --> 02:09:07,919
Blood! I think a
