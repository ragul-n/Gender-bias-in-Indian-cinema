1
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,362
Pimmi, please bring the phone.

2
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,931
<i>Darling, you want something else?
Tea? Nimbu pani?</i>

3
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,340
No, no. That bloody bastard Dubey
hasn't come yet.

4
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:43,062
Alice?

5
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:50,034
Pimmi, I'm sorry to say,
but Lalit takes on too much tension.

6
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,765
It’s not good.

7
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,933
<i>You see all these young men
getting heart attacks these days.</i>

8
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,907
<i>And Lalit is doing everything
single-handedly.</i>

9
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,879
Left, left, you idiot!
You want to spoil-

10
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,652
Stop the car!

11
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:48,353
You'll spoil the decorations also.

12
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:51,022
Don't you even know how to drive?
I've only got one hand to drive with.

13
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:54,430
Who told you to break your hand
at this time, idiot? Where were you?

14
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,195
I went to the airport to get
your sister and her husband.

15
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,634
Where are they?
I didn't see them.

16
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,305
What do you mean, you didn't see them?

17
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:06,936
Hold up a placard:
"Mr. and Mrs. Tej Puri from USA."

18
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:09,311
<i>They could have seen you.</i>

19
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,714
<i>Why are you yawning so much?
I've hardly slept.</i>

20
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:14,014
Not to mention I got back
from Australia just yesterday.

21
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,453
You young people!

22
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:19,116
What do you need
to sleep so much for?

23
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,353
What time is the flight coming?
About 9:00.

24
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:24,260
Make sure you're there on time.
And take this car, okay?

25
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,730
And only run the AC
when you've received them.

26
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,427
And park this car somewhere else!
Chill.

27
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:32,561
<i>And take off that stupid topi.</i>

28
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:37,272
Where the hell
are those girls?

29
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,310
Oh, God, Varun,
what are you doing with that?

30
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:45,680
Why haven't you got ready?
Didn't you hear Papa?

31
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:50,882
<i>- He's getting so angry.
- It’s the last step. Coconut curry, Ma.</i>

32
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:54,586
No, no. Now, hurry up.
Don't give me a hard time.

33
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,322
And this TV. I'm so sick of it!
Take this off. Hurry up.

34
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,863
Ma, what are you doing?
I'll do it myself.

35
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,922
What "wear it yourself"?
I'll wear it myself.

36
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,161
The guests are on their way.

37
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,397
Did you change your underwear?
Ma!

38
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,632
What "Ma"? Did you?

39
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:11,107
Out with the truth! Are you wearing
dirty ones from yesterday?

40
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:15,579
- I just hope they're not smelling.
You're such a silly little boy.

41
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:18,411
"Little"?
Oh, God!

42
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,550
Just because India has gone global...

43
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,287
should we embrace everything?

44
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:31,454
<i>What about our ancient culture?</i>

45
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,363
<i>Our tradition? Our values?</i>

46
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,798
<i>You are saying
censorship is unnecessary.</i>

47
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:39,962
- Absolutely unnecessary.
- What is your response, Mr. Bhatt?

48
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,700
Let's take the example of America.

49
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:45,265
<i>This is not America.
This is India.</i>

50
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,949
You think just because you wear
handloom and speak in Hindi...

51
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,420
<i>that you represent the common man?</i>

52
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:58,716
Well, you don't.

53
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,984
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

54
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:04,926
one of our top dubbists in Delhi,
Shivani Tanakiya.

55
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,439
- This is what the common man hears.
- So, somebody enjoying sex.

56
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,779
So what's the problem?

57
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,876
We have to take a short break,
ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:06,218
<i>but please stay tuned to Delhi dot com.</i>

59
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:24,470
Hi.
Hi.

60
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:34,041
How have you been?
Fine.

61
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,646
Are you happy?

62
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,754
Yeah.

63
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,694
I miss you.

64
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:55,034
Oh, hi, Aditi. I'm sorry.

65
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:58,369
- We're starting in 20 seconds.
- I'll be right there.

66
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,136
Sorry.

67
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:05,073
I have to go.

68
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:15,152
Call me.

69
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,566
<i>Aditi, why are you doing this?
What? What am I doing?</i>

70
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,568
I don't think
you're ready for marriage.

71
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:28,103
<i>I just want to settle down.
So what do you do?</i>

72
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,435
Get married to some guy
selected by Mummy and Daddy?

73
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,303
<i>You've known him
for a couple of weeks!</i>

74
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,935
You are so mature, Aditi.

75
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:38,640
I can't wait around to see if Vikram's
wife will agree to divorce him.

76
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:42,481
I've read too many magazines, Ria.
I know it may never happen.

77
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:45,146
<i>Do you get all your life directions
from fucking Cosmopolitan?</i>

78
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,745
Don't get superior with me.

79
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:49,883
We're family, and I can tell you
what I think, and I will.

80
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,654
That's right.

81
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:53,719
My older, unmarried cousin Ria.

82
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:57,291
What would she know about passion?

83
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:03,829
I didn't mean that, Didi.

84
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:08,002
For all this talk of passion,
how about marrying for love, Aditi?

85
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:13,399
There's a Tempo in the middle
of the driveway.

86
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:18,978
We had to go to the tailor and then-

87
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:21,880
But people are about to arrive
and you're not dressed yet!

88
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,817
Come on, hurry up.
You're looking very handsome today.

89
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,249
Hurry up and get ready.

90
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:33,317
Take it easy.

91
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:35,363
What are you doing here?
Just chillin'.

92
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,364
Just chilling.
Idiot.

93
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,295
Hi, Mom. I'm back.

94
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:42,648
Aliya? God, what are you doing here?

95
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,522
You're so disgusting.
Get out now! Out!

96
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,968
Out!
What does this word mean?

97
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,833
- How come you're so irritating?
- How come you're still unmarried?

98
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,656
Hello, sweetie.

99
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,563
What does this word mean?

100
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,667
It’s "uxorious. "

101
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,469
It’s "uxorious. "
Uxorious?

102
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,092
So you are facing this way as barman?

103
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,364
I'm the barman, facing this way,
and this acts as a roof.

104
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,371
No need to be happy
about being the barman.

105
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,169
You're not supposed to touch
one drop of the stuff. Understand?

106
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,233
A barman should be absolutely sober.

107
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,575
Keep this list, and make sure
the servants don't swipe anything...

108
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:18,310
and make small drinks for everybody,
not too large.

109
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,251
The whiskey hasn't come yet!
Uday was supposed to bring it.

110
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,778
<i>Here he comes.
My unpunctual brother.</i>

111
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,621
<i>Good morning.</i>

112
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,060
<i>What do you think?</i>

113
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,427
We got real scotch from Uday's client.

114
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:36,160
- Thank you, Sona.
- Hi, Lalo Uncle.

115
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:38,600
<i>- Why aren't you staying with us?
- I have to study for my exams.</i>

116
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,104
I hope my little Aliya
didn't trouble you.

117
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,074
<i>No, she's such a little delight.</i>

118
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,508
<i>Pick it up and take it in.</i>

119
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,052
This is no time
for family members to arrive.

120
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,419
It’s only 4:00.

121
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,616
<i>Just relax!</i>

122
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:02,717
Ayesha, this is C.L. Uncle
and Shashi Auntie's son Rahul.

123
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,955
They live in Dubai.
Muscat, actually.

124
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,520
Yeah, Muscat, okay.

125
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,160
You have a tattoo.
Yeah.

126
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,519
Okay, bye.

127
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:45,832
I think your cousin Rahul
would really like it.

128
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,733
You have to know this.

129
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,742
I heard your mother tell him and sister
your bra size was 36C.

130
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,177
<i>- Why would she do that?
- Sorry, but it's 32A.</i>

131
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,579
I know that,
but we can't tell them.

132
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:03,551
<i>Pimmi, come on!</i>

133
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:08,388
The groom's here!

134
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,321
Oh, shit.

135
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,832
Welcome, welcome.

136
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,538
Thank you, thank you.

137
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,072
This is Pimmi's brother from Muscat.

138
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:28,907
Rahul, come here!

139
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:36,245
It’s okay, it's okay.

140
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:46,118
Hello, young man. How are you?

141
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:48,427
Have you got the blue box?

142
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:59,002
So, excited?
Soon to be in family way!

143
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:06,548
So, you like India?
Yeah.

144
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:09,676
Better than Houston, no?

145
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,415
Good, good, good.
India needs young men like you.

146
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:18,052
<i>Yes, computer engineers
are India's biggest export.</i>

147
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:22,123
Am I a coolie or what?

148
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,127
<i>Bhai-sahab,
what would you like to drink?</i>

149
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,363
Scotch, please on the "rockiolis. "

150
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:31,430
"Rockiolis" means ice?
Two lumps, exactly.

151
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:33,168
Exactly.

152
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,109
I'll have the same, thanks.

153
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,204
Uh "rockioli. "

154
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,183
Rahul, two whiskies here.

155
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,685
<i>Two cubes of ice exactly.</i>

156
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,916
Oh, my goodness. Look at you!

157
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:50,758
How lovely you look.

158
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,327
Rockioli, rockioli.
Mrs. Rai over there.

159
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,468
Hi. Congratulations.
Hi.

160
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,199
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

161
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,030
Fine.

162
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:46,748
I must have another drink.

163
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:56,885
<i>Rahul, idiot, come here.</i>

164
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,859
<i>Come here and hold
the camera. Listen.</i>

165
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,862
Look at them.
How handsome Hemant is.

166
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,801
Come on, put it on.
Camera on!

167
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,436
On the ring!

168
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,386
Thank you.

169
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,888
Just in time!

170
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:40,232
This is Varun?
He's almost a young man.

171
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,265
How did you manage? I sent Rahul
to airport, told me flight was late.

172
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:50,142
No, it was not late. Nobody was there
at the airport, so we took a cab.

173
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:53,011
- You had to take a cab?
- It’s okay.

174
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:55,277
Rahul, you idiot, I sent you
to the airport to receive them.

175
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:57,319
<i>You come back and tell me
the flight was late?</i>

176
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,890
He's been working day and night.
He doesn't know India.

177
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,256
But he's number one
most stupid duffer.

178
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:07,625
I'm sorry to say,
but I don't like this!

179
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:19,838
<i>Bhai-sahab, this is Mr. Tej Puri,
married to my sister Vijaya.</i>

180
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:22,775
<i>After my older brother
Surinder bhai-sahab passed away...</i>

181
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:25,871
<i>Tej bhai has been
the hero of the family.</i>

182
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:29,610
He has really looked after us.
Come and meet Hemant.

183
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:31,879
Yes. Excuse me.

184
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:33,784
Excuse me.

185
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:42,389
You know how difficult it was
to get tickets at this time of the year?

186
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:45,228
Difficult or not, we would have brought
you here first-class if we had to.

187
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,098
<i>We couldn't have had the shadi
without you, my darling sister.</i>

188
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,697
Nothing would have stopped us.

189
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:59,479
Ria!

190
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:02,107
<i>Is that you? Come here.</i>

191
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:05,879
<i>Come here, come here.</i>

192
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,060
God bless. Very good.

193
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:15,247
<i>- Paaji, would you like a cigar?
- I quit.</i>

194
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:32,788
<i>Tej bhai-sahab, I wanted
to talk to you about Ria's plans.</i>

195
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:36,357
Ria, come here a minute, please.

196
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,339
<i>- Ria wants to study in America.
- Is that so?</i>

197
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:42,135
<i>We're hoping you could give us
some advice.</i>

198
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,334
What do you want to do?

199
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:45,877
I'm applying
for creative writing programs.

200
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:48,004
- She wants to be a writer.
- Very good.

201
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,982
Have you thought of the budget?
Where will the money will come from?

202
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,213
<i>My teacher's salary?</i>

203
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:57,085
<i>Why can't she be like Aditi and do
the right thing at the right time?</i>

204
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:09,724
Absolutely! Just one book.
Who knows? It might happen.

205
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:11,167
<i>You must go to the States.</i>

206
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:13,899
<i>You know saada Umang
is also there.</i>

207
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:17,101
- You must give us his phone number.
- He's coming here tonight.

208
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,474
We're hoping Ria and Umang
will like each other.

209
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:23,711
What are the chances
of getting hooked?

210
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:26,183
Bad.

211
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:35,252
<i>Save the jokes for the sangeet.
He'll be the MC at the sangeet.</i>

212
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:40,458
Varun, out!

213
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:43,157
What's your problem anyway?

214
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:54,931
Varun, what happened to you?

215
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,566
Mrs. Mehta speaking. Who's this?

216
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:02,840
<i>Okay, okay, I have
an announcement to make.</i>

217
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,644
I'm thinking that if Ria wants
to study in America...

218
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:08,811
I will fund her entire education.

219
00:27:10,188 --> 00:27:12,622
<i>No, no arguments.</i>

220
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:15,023
This is my family.

221
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:21,024
You see, Lalit,
Ria is a sensible girl.

222
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:24,125
<i>If she wants to write,
we must encourage her.</i>

223
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:27,467
I can still work.

224
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:31,201
This is final!
We'll talk about it later, okay?

225
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,300
Now you tell us what needs
to be done for the wedding.

226
00:27:33,377 --> 00:27:36,540
<i>Absolutely. Now you don't have
to worry about anything.</i>

227
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:41,215
Anything.

228
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,189
My God, I don't know what to say.

229
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,493
This is enough for me
that we are all here together.

230
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:56,693
My God! Pimmi, it's wonderful, no?
After so many years.

231
00:27:56,768 --> 00:27:59,497
<i>After Surinder bhai-sahab passed away...</i>

232
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:05,008
<i>I think this is the first time
the whole family's here together.</i>

233
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:10,002
Ria, Ria, Ria.

234
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,542
Don't cry.
I know you are missing him.

235
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:18,315
<i>We are all missing your father.</i>

236
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:35,500
Dubey!

237
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,248
<i>Rahul, go start the generator.</i>

238
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:48,683
- I don't even know where it is.
- Behind the house, idiot!

239
00:28:48,752 --> 00:28:50,344
Come, I'll show you.

240
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:53,515
Umang?
Yeah, just hold on a sec.

241
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:56,355
It’s very unclear.
Hello?

242
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:59,725
When are you arriving?

243
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,630
Hello, hello?

244
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:40,694
Think you can handle it?
Yeah, sure.

245
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,889
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,758
<i>I'm glad I got some exercise.</i>

247
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:03,770
All I've been doing is
eating and eating and eating.

248
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:08,173
I'm sorry I had to
wake you up this early...

249
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:12,702
but this is the only time
we're gonna have on our own.

250
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,340
<i>There's just so many ceremonies.</i>

251
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:18,010
<i>And I don't even know
who's who half the time.</i>

252
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,746
I know what you mean.

253
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,914
I wanted to talk to you about our-
Here's the coffee, ma'am.

254
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,050
Thank you.
Do you want something?

255
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:29,095
<i>I'll have a salt lassi, please.
Sure, I'll get it.</i>

256
00:33:35,102 --> 00:33:37,502
<i>I want to know what's on your mind.</i>

257
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:41,166
Sleep! That's all
that's on my mind right now.

258
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:46,639
I saw you with your family yesterday.

259
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:51,211
<i>You guys are so close.</i>

260
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:53,515
<i>Sometimes...</i>

261
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:57,387
<i>I worry about how it will be
for you in America.</i>

262
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,857
You might just feel so alone.

263
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:01,689
I'm sure I can handle it.

264
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:04,889
It'll be really nice to get away
from this damned place.

265
00:34:04,964 --> 00:34:06,727
Why? You don't like Delhi?

266
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,132
No, I love India.

267
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:12,831
<i>I mean, I don't care. America's
gonna be new for me anyway.</i>

268
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:15,500
My fiancée.

269
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:18,807
<i>Sorry, I'm just not a morning person.</i>

270
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,913
Vicky, is it okay
if I join the four-ball today?

271
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,643
No, no, I'll be there 100%.

272
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,780
I'll be there. Don't worry. Okay, bye.

273
00:34:32,926 --> 00:34:34,655
Pimmi.

274
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:38,828
<i>Pimmi.</i>

275
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:41,924
<i>What are you doing inside?
Nothing.</i>

276
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:44,367
Nothing.
I know very well what you're doing.

277
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:47,769
<i>Open up. I have to get ready.
Just a minute.</i>

278
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,581
If you must hide and smoke,
at least use a better air freshener.

279
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:58,206
I was a little tense.

280
00:34:58,283 --> 00:35:01,720
<i>Tense? You're going shopping!
I'm the one who should be tense.</i>

281
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:05,554
I'm doing it for our darling daughter.
You saw how much they gave us.

282
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,718
We can't look bad
in front of our in-laws.

283
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:09,762
We'll look good with you
smoking in front of them.

284
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:12,855
Well, doesn't Saroj drink?

285
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:15,230
Anyway, just let me go
and do it, okay?

286
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:17,826
<i>Well, Pimmi goes shopping again.</i>

287
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:20,395
And I'm telling you,
it's gonna cost us.

288
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:23,271
<i>So what? I'll arrange the money like
I've been organizing everything else.</i>

289
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:28,502
<i>You've organized everything else?</i>

290
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,038
Who's been nonstop on her toes
for days? Just tell me that.

291
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:41,289
Thank you so much
for working so hard.

292
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,795
<i>Take off your curlers at least!</i>

293
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:32,141
Alice.
Alice.

294
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,522
Email?

295
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:52,902
Shit! Dubey!

296
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:00,174
Yes, sir?

297
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:06,277
<i>Yes, sir?
Dubey.</i>

298
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:10,087
Yes sir.
What's this "yes sir"?

299
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:30,370
Okay.

300
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:55,062
Advance? What for?

301
00:40:55,138 --> 00:40:57,003
Waterproofing, meaning more money.

302
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,295
Five thousand dollars.
Exactly and approximately.

303
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:07,539
Thank God it's air-conditioned.

304
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,474
<i>Mom, I'm just going to have a chuski.</i>

305
00:42:09,544 --> 00:42:14,106
Just one.

306
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:37,834
By God, it's fabulous!

307
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,019
Aditi.

308
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:57,016
What are you doing? They're
waiting for your approval inside.

309
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,190
I don't really know how Hemant thinks,
what he expects of me.

310
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,095
So call him instead of Vikram.

311
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,624
Now go inside before those aunties come
and dance on our head.

312
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,667
Thank you.

313
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:20,212
Hey, you want a lift, baby?

314
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,254
Aliya, go and sit.

315
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:46,398
<i>We can try the sitting step,
and then the chunri khenchna step.</i>

316
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,256
Hi, sexy.

317
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,593
So, Sydney boy, can you move to this?

318
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:25,009
What's going on, guys?

319
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:31,510
<i>Come on, didi. That's enough.</i>

320
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,513
God.

321
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,885
Not more interruptions!
We'll never get this right.

322
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,327
<i>What is it, Rahul? We're rehearsing
for the sangeet. What do you want?</i>

323
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:41,032
Lalit and Sam are partners,
and Vicky and me.

324
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:43,039
<i>Let's take them on, partner.</i>

325
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:47,410
<i>That's a great shot, partner.</i>

326
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:50,811
<i>Thanks, Rajeev.
Great shot there. Good shooting.</i>

327
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,146
Thank God we're partners.

328
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:55,413
I have to talk to you
about something, Rajeev.

329
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:04,656
Rajeev, I was wondering if-
How's Pimmi?

330
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:06,822
She's fine.
How are the preparations going?

331
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:09,024
Preparations? First-class.

332
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,128
<i>But, Sam, I'm having
a cash-flow problem.</i>

333
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:17,606
I was hoping to borrow some money
just to tide over this wedding expense.

334
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:23,179
When do you think you'll be able
to return it, partner?

335
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:26,580
Next month. I have a huge shipment
going to Macy's next month.

336
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:31,553
Hey, guys, Mr. Verma here has got
some serious cash-flow problems.

337
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:37,117
Thank God I don't have any
daughters

338
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:41,324
<i>- You've got a high-maintenance wife.
- But she's a self-financed Maharani.</i>

339
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:47,262
<i>O women of the house</i>

340
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,306
Decorate me with henna

341
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:52,326
Hey, idiot, come on!
Let's enter the harem!

342
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:56,092
<i>Arre, ladies!</i>

343
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:05,165
C.L. has an item which is
most suitable for ladies. Please!

344
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:19,086
So, Varun, enjoying yourself
among all the women?

345
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:36,029
<i>Be a good girl. Don't say no.</i>

346
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:39,403
<i>Open your mouth.
Do you like it?</i>

347
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:42,409
<i>Be a good girl
and open your mouth.</i>

348
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,411
<i>There's only this much left.</i>

349
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:48,306
Hi.
Hi. What?

350
00:51:48,383 --> 00:51:50,578
<i>Hi. Nice mehndi, Ria.</i>

351
00:51:54,723 --> 00:51:56,748
She's angry, eh?

352
00:51:59,694 --> 00:52:02,891
<i>Okay. Ria didi will give you
samosa, okay?</i>

353
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:09,028
<i>- What were you doing here?
- Eating a big samosa.</i>

354
00:52:09,104 --> 00:52:10,594
<i>Why?
Because I'm hungry.</i>

355
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:13,766
<i>- No, why are you eating it here?
- Because the samosas were in here.</i>

356
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,707
<i>Why was he with you, Aliya?
Who?</i>

357
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:16,937
<i>Tej Uncle.</i>

358
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:19,981
<i>Alice said the samosas
were on the top shelf...</i>

359
00:52:20,048 --> 00:52:23,814
and Tej Uncle came
to get the box down for me.

360
00:52:25,921 --> 00:52:28,855
<i>Okay, let's do a nakkushi.</i>

361
00:52:28,923 --> 00:52:32,654
<i>I love you, Ria didi.
I love you too, my baby.</i>

362
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:56,373
Alice.

363
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:04,113
Alice.

364
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:07,769
You know, Pimmi...

365
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:10,509
sometimes when I look at them...

366
00:55:12,752 --> 00:55:18,657
I feel love which I almost cannot bear.

367
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:34,567
And when did we grow old?

368
00:56:04,603 --> 00:56:07,299
If only their lives are happy.

369
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:16,604
For that I'm willing to take on every
trouble, every sorrow, in the world.

370
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:47,574
<i>- Need anything, beta?
- I'm all right, thanks.</i>

371
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:49,637
Good night.

372
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,443
Good night, idiot.

373
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:02,022
I thought you weren't staying here.

374
00:57:02,093 --> 00:57:04,926
I changed my mind.

375
00:57:04,996 --> 00:57:06,896
Really?

376
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:09,662
How come you're not asleep as yet?

377
00:57:11,503 --> 00:57:13,596
Just thinking.

378
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:16,163
About what?

379
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,403
About good Indian girls.

380
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:36,624
Is this a scorpion?
Yeah. It’s my sign.

381
00:57:49,874 --> 00:57:53,003
I should go.
It’s okay.

382
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:26,134
I should really go.
Don't go.

383
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,143
Please don't.

384
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,756
Idiot.

385
00:59:12,188 --> 00:59:14,179
Where would you like to go?

386
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:19,186
I just want to drive
and drive and drive.

387
00:59:56,299 --> 00:59:58,232
Why did you come to see me?

388
00:59:59,468 --> 01:00:01,528
I...

389
01:00:02,772 --> 01:00:06,640
wanted to be reminded
why I broke up with you.

390
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,798
Somehow...

391
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,804
I can't remember.

392
01:00:51,855 --> 01:00:55,120
<i>What is it?</i>

393
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,450
What is it?

394
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:10,104
Take me to the police station?
On what basis?

395
01:01:10,172 --> 01:01:14,404
Indecent exposure.
Obscenity.

396
01:01:17,012 --> 01:01:19,640
<i>Don't be ridiculous!
Do we look like terrorists?</i>

397
01:01:39,902 --> 01:01:41,927
Hello, darling.

398
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:48,937
Yes, I know that.
I'll be home soon.

399
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:57,943
There was an emergency. Yes.

400
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:01,079
No, don't worry. That's just
a television show in the background.

401
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:03,487
Vikram, don't leave me with them.

402
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:24,846
What are you doing?

403
01:03:03,885 --> 01:03:05,614
Lalit.

404
01:03:12,226 --> 01:03:14,421
Let me sleep, will you?

405
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:46,814
So what are you
going to say to Hemant?

406
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:49,616
- Everything.
- Oh, God. Then?

407
01:04:49,689 --> 01:04:52,783
He's gonna tell me I'm a slut
and that I should get lost.

408
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:54,986
<i>Adu.</i>

409
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:57,325
How could I have been so stupid?

410
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:59,455
Are you sure you want
to tell Hemant everything?

411
01:04:59,531 --> 01:05:02,000
<i>Everything's over
between you and Vikram now.</i>

412
01:05:03,136 --> 01:05:06,731
Ria, I don't want to lie.

413
01:05:06,806 --> 01:05:11,175
I don't want to start something new
based on lies and deceit.

414
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:14,441
It’s just so wrong.

415
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:18,109
You liked Hemant, no?
Yeah.

416
01:05:18,184 --> 01:05:20,015
He's nice.

417
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:22,350
He's good for you.

418
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:25,016
I can't do this to him.

419
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:29,993
I'm going mad!
What is this music?

420
01:05:30,062 --> 01:05:32,963
<i>It’s Ayesha practicing
for the sangeet tonight.</i>

421
01:05:33,966 --> 01:05:36,526
Maybe she shouldn't bother.
What?

422
01:05:36,602 --> 01:05:40,299
<i>- Maybe she shouldn't bother.
- Adu!</i>

423
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,711
I'm really glad you called...

424
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:52,581
because I was gonna
call you myself this morning.

425
01:05:52,652 --> 01:05:55,382
Why? What happened?
Nothing happened.

426
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,922
It was great
to see you alone yesterday...

427
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:00,584
so I thought I'd try my luck again.

428
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,561
You look really nice when you laugh.
Oh, yeah?

429
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,832
I need to tell you something.

430
01:06:10,903 --> 01:06:12,996
You'll probably hate me
by the end of it...

431
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:18,840
but I really need you to know.

432
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:22,677
It’s okay.
I'm not gonna hate you.

433
01:06:26,286 --> 01:06:29,015
This used to be my favorite haunt
during my IIT days.

434
01:06:29,088 --> 01:06:31,022
<i>Best chai in the world.</i>

435
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:34,150
It’s nice.
Yeah? I was hoping you'd like it.

436
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:11,192
So, what was so important?

437
01:07:11,263 --> 01:07:13,458
You don't want to marry me anymore?

438
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:19,704
Just look at these.

439
01:07:19,772 --> 01:07:21,637
Mama gave these to me
when I got married.

440
01:07:21,707 --> 01:07:24,437
Still so shiny and beautiful.

441
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,070
I never used them once.

442
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:29,079
I just hope Aditi will use them.

443
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:31,240
<i>Pimmi, what have you spread all over?</i>

444
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:33,715
I have to do my accounts
and I can't even find my papers.

445
01:07:33,785 --> 01:07:36,652
- Please don't keep this stuff here.
- Then get a computer.

446
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,416
You won't need any paper.

447
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:40,480
Computers can do everything
for you these days.

448
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:42,822
I'm too old to learn
all this computer nonsense.

449
01:07:42,894 --> 01:07:46,022
<i>And you know how much money
has already got spent?</i>

450
01:07:46,097 --> 01:07:48,327
You know how long it will take me
to repay all this?

451
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:50,299
Don't worry so much, Lalit.

452
01:07:50,368 --> 01:07:52,428
Our only daughter's getting married.

453
01:07:52,504 --> 01:07:54,768
<i>Nothing's a waste.</i>

454
01:07:55,774 --> 01:07:57,604
Look at these saris.

455
01:07:57,675 --> 01:08:00,701
You know I bought this one
in Madras 22 years ago?

456
01:08:01,646 --> 01:08:04,877
I've been collecting these
since the day Aditi was born.

457
01:08:06,384 --> 01:08:09,012
This one is lovely.

458
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:15,524
And tomorrow she'll be gone.

459
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:18,187
Just like that, in one day.

460
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:31,501
I'm sorry.

461
01:08:36,848 --> 01:08:39,749
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

462
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:49,713
Couldn't help yourself, huh?

463
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:53,187
You had to drag me into your mess
as well. What am I supposed to do now?

464
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:58,325
Mr. Verma, your daughter's
such a rosebud.

465
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,863
We'll have a wonderful family
in Houston, Texas...

466
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:03,331
<i>be friends,
take our kids to Disneyland...</i>

467
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,197
<i>send you tickets every year.</i>

468
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:06,895
It'll be lovely!

469
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,528
But, hey, wait a minute.

470
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,971
You didn't tell me she's still
screwing her ex-boyfriend...

471
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:14,135
while you were fixing
her marriage.

472
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,577
But that shouldn't be a problem.
I'm from America. We'll fit right in.

473
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,984
I've been thinking, Lalit.

474
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,487
I don't want to send Varun
to boarding school.

475
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,250
- Don't start again.
- I don't want to lose both my children.

476
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,815
Don't start over again, huh?
We've been through all this.

477
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,521
He's going to boarding school,
and that's final.

478
01:10:33,595 --> 01:10:36,257
He's wasting his life, staying here
watching TV the whole day.

479
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,931
<i>There's no one here to discipline him.</i>

480
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,799
I don't know what to do.

481
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,601
He also needs love and affection.

482
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:47,108
He's such a sensitive boy...

483
01:10:47,177 --> 01:10:50,510
and he's so wonderful
with all these creative things.

484
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:53,844
Creative things like
singing and dancing.

485
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,147
cooking sesame chicken.

486
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,185
Don't say that. Why do you always
look at everything like that?

487
01:11:01,256 --> 01:11:04,123
<i>You know what he told Tej bhai-sahab
he wants to be when he grows up?</i>

488
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,627
What?
He said he wants to be a chef.

489
01:11:07,629 --> 01:11:10,792
I tell you.

490
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:14,826
<i>A cook!</i>

491
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:18,361
It doesn't mean anything.

492
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,873
He's a fool.

493
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,910
My son will be a man
when he grows up, understand?

494
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,537
He'll be an educated professional.

495
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,673
<i>He won't be singing and dancing
in people's shadis.</i>

496
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,377
Mama.

497
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,045
<i>Can you do this for me?
Make a mucchi and on my eyes?</i>

498
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,681
<i>Why, beta?
For my dance with Ayesha tonight.</i>

499
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,349
<i>Okay.</i>

500
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:41,054
<i>Why can't you do something useful?</i>

501
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,827
Like some exercise or reading
your schoolbooks for a change.

502
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,561
Look at you, a big huge hulk.

503
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,762
<i>Can't spend your whole life
singing and dancing.</i>

504
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:51,897
- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

505
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,977
You don't do any exercise.
You don't even play cricket.

506
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,707
You don't read a book. Just sleeping
all day and watching TV...

507
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:01,681
and now this new nonsense, dancing!

508
01:12:01,749 --> 01:12:05,241
<i>Why? You also took Mama's dupatta
and danced the night.</i>

509
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:07,082
Don't compare yourself with me.
You're just a kid.

510
01:12:07,155 --> 01:12:09,056
But right now
you said I'm big now.

511
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,683
That's it. You're going
to boarding school. Decided!

512
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:13,785
Since when?

513
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,092
<i>Beta, Papa and I
are only talking about it.</i>

514
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,531
No, I have made up my mind.
We are not-

515
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,397
Let me talk to him.

516
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,027
<i>It’s going to be good for you.</i>

517
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:25,596
Soon Aditi's going away.
You'll be so lonely at home.

518
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:29,074
So we thought you'd go to boarding
school. You'll have so much fun.

519
01:12:29,143 --> 01:12:31,907
You also have been trying
to send me away to boarding school.

520
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:34,106
<i>No, beta.</i>

521
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:39,078
That school is much better
than this school.

522
01:12:39,153 --> 01:12:41,280
We thought you'll go there and
there'll be so many boys your age.

523
01:12:41,355 --> 01:12:43,619
- You'll really enjoy yourself.
- No, I don't want to go.

524
01:12:43,691 --> 01:12:45,784
I won't go.
You do what you want.

525
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,828
<i>We're just doing this
for your own good.</i>

526
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:50,625
It'll make you a bit tougher.
It'll be good for you.

527
01:12:50,698 --> 01:12:53,031
I hate you!
I hate you both!

528
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,229
You don't even understand
one thing about me.

529
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,272
Don't you talk to me like that!

530
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,568
Fine! I just won't talk to you at all.

531
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,267
Varun.
No.

532
01:13:01,342 --> 01:13:04,675
<i>Please, son,
Leave me alone.</i>

533
01:13:08,349 --> 01:13:10,977
Happy now?
Happy with what you've done?

534
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:13,486
I didn't mean
to upset him like that.

535
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:17,155
Why couldn't you say something?

536
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:20,456
Don't talk to me, okay?
Just don't talk to me.

537
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:28,619
Aditi.

538
01:14:31,398 --> 01:14:33,332
I'm sorry I lost it out there.

539
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,392
I didn't have any right
to talk to you like that.

540
01:14:36,469 --> 01:14:39,063
You had every reason to be angry.

541
01:14:40,407 --> 01:14:42,898
Someone broke my heart too
a few years ago.

542
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:47,845
I know how hard
and confusing it can be.

543
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:53,211
I really appreciate
your telling me about Vikram.

544
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:56,346
You didn't have to but you did.

545
01:14:56,423 --> 01:14:59,186
That honesty means a lot to me.

546
01:14:59,258 --> 01:15:02,820
I know it's a risk,
but what marriage isn't a risk?

547
01:15:02,896 --> 01:15:05,262
Whether our parents introduce us
or we meet in a club...

548
01:15:05,332 --> 01:15:07,857
what difference does it make?

549
01:15:18,612 --> 01:15:20,603
I know we can put this behind us.

550
01:15:22,015 --> 01:15:23,778
I really do.

551
01:15:25,218 --> 01:15:27,845
I believe this can work.

552
01:15:29,188 --> 01:15:31,782
I believe we can be happy.

553
01:15:31,857 --> 01:15:35,258
As for the question of whether
we should get married or not...

554
01:15:36,862 --> 01:15:39,126
it's really for you to answer.

555
01:19:01,064 --> 01:19:04,090
Here's yours.
Especially my mom.

556
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:07,466
Yeah, exactly. Sure.

557
01:19:07,537 --> 01:19:10,267
How are you?
Very well. How are you doing?

558
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:15,539
Ladies and gentlemen,
attention, please.

559
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:17,513
Welcome...

560
01:19:17,582 --> 01:19:21,018
beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful ladies...

561
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:22,609
and gentlemen...

562
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:26,248
and, of course, lovely children.

563
01:19:26,324 --> 01:19:30,555
<i>Today's sangeet
for our beloved Aditi...</i>

564
01:19:30,627 --> 01:19:35,064
<i>and our dear son.
Son-in-law!</i>

565
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:39,499
and marriage will
take place tomorrow.

566
01:19:39,569 --> 01:19:43,505
Rahul, Rahul.

567
01:19:43,573 --> 01:19:45,541
Are you the only bartender here?

568
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:47,668
I ordered a Bacardi Coke
20 minutes ago.

569
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:49,575
- Just a second.
- Rahul.

570
01:19:49,646 --> 01:19:53,343
<i>- Gin and tonic, no ice, lots of gin.
- Make that two.</i>

571
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:54,542
Sure.

572
01:20:05,228 --> 01:20:09,858
Move, man.
Sorry. Chill.

573
01:20:12,769 --> 01:20:16,671
Welcome.

574
01:20:23,613 --> 01:20:25,706
Who's that clown?

575
01:20:25,782 --> 01:20:27,681
That's my dad.

576
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:31,242
Varun, you can't say no now.
Please, Varun!

577
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:35,017
Listen,

578
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:36,751
Varun, please.

579
01:20:36,825 --> 01:20:39,259
I told you, I don't care
about anything anymore.

580
01:20:39,328 --> 01:20:42,525
I don't care, and that's decided.

581
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:54,638
In my opinion, you Punjabis
are way too ostentatious.

582
01:20:54,711 --> 01:20:58,305
In my opinion, you Bengalis
are way too pretentious.

583
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,940
Touche, Ria.
This is Jibesh, Vandana.

584
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:03,644
This is Mrs. Rai,
Aditi's ma-in-law to be.

585
01:21:11,193 --> 01:21:14,162
- Ria, get me a rum and Coke.
- Please go get it yourself.

586
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:18,290
Please. I would, but I know
so many people who know my parents.

587
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:20,927
<i>Please, just get it.</i>

588
01:21:21,003 --> 01:21:24,063
<i>- We will start this evening...
- Okay.</i>

589
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:28,335
with a spectacular item...

590
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,847
by our own beloved Ayesha.

591
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:38,077
What's the matter?
Varun won't do the dance anymore.

592
01:21:38,153 --> 01:21:42,522
Shit. I'm so sorry to hear that.
I don't know what to do-

593
01:21:42,591 --> 01:21:45,958
Rahul, you can do it. You've seen us
rehearse the steps so many times.

594
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:48,360
- You're crazy!
- You can make up the steps as we go.

595
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:49,920
You said you love to dance.

596
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:51,967
Please, I'm begging you.
I need your help.

597
01:21:52,034 --> 01:21:54,969
I can dance, but it's not
a nightclub in Melbourne, you know.

598
01:21:55,037 --> 01:21:57,301
I can't dance to this music.

599
01:21:57,373 --> 01:21:59,499
You're such a

600
01:22:03,077 --> 01:22:04,669
I just fell from grace.

601
01:22:04,746 --> 01:22:07,613
Darling, you have to be standing up
in order to be able to fall.

602
01:22:07,682 --> 01:22:11,642
If you keep sitting on your ass,
nothing's gonna happen.

603
01:22:22,798 --> 01:22:26,029
Meaning, sweetheart,
the main thing is...

604
01:22:26,769 --> 01:22:28,565
you have to fight the battle.

605
01:23:34,936 --> 01:23:37,234
Come on, girl, that's it!

606
01:25:29,782 --> 01:25:33,183
Nobody is to sit.
Everybody come and dance!

607
01:26:12,191 --> 01:26:14,216
Come on.

608
01:27:37,108 --> 01:27:39,099
Let's stay up all night together.

609
01:27:41,579 --> 01:27:44,912
Really. Let's talk.

610
01:27:44,983 --> 01:27:48,146
Talk?
Why would you want to talk?

611
01:28:24,122 --> 01:28:26,090
Alice.

612
01:29:04,828 --> 01:29:07,092
<i>Here comes my kissing cousin, Aditi.</i>

613
01:29:09,433 --> 01:29:12,129
<i>Hi, lovebirds.
Okay, okay.</i>

614
01:29:12,202 --> 01:29:14,727
I can only handle
one woman at a time.

615
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:16,272
Oh, really?

616
01:29:17,742 --> 01:29:20,404
<i>Don't tire yourself out.
Tomorrow's the big night.</i>

617
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:23,106
And don't corrupt
my elder sister, huh?

618
01:29:38,361 --> 01:29:40,659
I don't like kissing.

619
01:29:40,730 --> 01:29:44,461
Typical man.

620
01:29:44,534 --> 01:29:47,833
No, I get so confused about what to do.
Does your tongue go right in?

621
01:29:47,904 --> 01:29:50,099
<i>Does it move around?
Does it stay still?</i>

622
01:29:50,173 --> 01:29:54,166
<i>- Makes me too nervous.
- Don't think. Just go with the flow.</i>

623
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:58,503
<i>Don't think?
I wish I could do that.</i>

624
01:29:58,581 --> 01:30:00,641
<i>Kissing could be great...</i>

625
01:30:00,717 --> 01:30:03,185
but my mind starts whizzing
with the weirdest thoughts...

626
01:30:03,253 --> 01:30:07,656
<i>and suddenly I'm thinking of some banal,
practical thing to take care of.</i>

627
01:30:07,724 --> 01:30:10,784
I don't know what the big deal is.
I know all about kissing.

628
01:30:10,861 --> 01:30:13,659
<i>- Really, baby?
- Accha. Everything?</i>

629
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:15,595
Yeah, what's the big deal?

630
01:30:15,665 --> 01:30:16,859
No big deal.
It’s gross.

631
01:30:16,933 --> 01:30:19,800
You open your mouth
and he sticks his tongue in.

632
01:30:21,872 --> 01:30:24,363
Don't you know?
That's how older people kiss.

633
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:31,370
<i>Let's go. I feel exhausted.</i>

634
01:30:35,151 --> 01:30:37,779
Bye.
See you, Varun.

635
01:30:53,904 --> 01:30:56,839
Mama, I want to sleep.

636
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,681
Yeah, Mr. Culkin, one moment.

637
01:31:20,062 --> 01:31:21,893
I'll go help, huh?

638
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:29,928
She's so sleepy.

639
01:31:30,005 --> 01:31:32,872
I'll take her out for a drive, okay?

640
01:31:37,313 --> 01:31:39,213
<i>I don't want ice cream.</i>

641
01:31:44,053 --> 01:31:46,248
<i>Strawberry ice cream?</i>

642
01:31:47,656 --> 01:31:50,648
She's tired and cranky.
I thought I'd take her out for a drive.

643
01:31:52,761 --> 01:31:54,695
Yeah, sorry.

644
01:31:55,998 --> 01:31:59,160
Ria?
Ria, what's happening?

645
01:32:16,652 --> 01:32:19,212
- What's the matter, Ria?
- Just let her go.

646
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:25,889
Let her go from what?
From you, you bastard!

647
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:30,158
- Ria, have you gone mad?
- Maybe she's had too much to drink.

648
01:32:31,799 --> 01:32:33,858
What happened?

649
01:32:33,935 --> 01:32:37,302
It wasn't enough that he touched me
when I was a girl?

650
01:32:37,372 --> 01:32:39,067
You had to teach Aliya
how older people kiss?

651
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,608
- Ria, stop this nonsense.
- What did you get out of it?

652
01:32:41,676 --> 01:32:44,577
I didn't even have breasts,
you sick man!

653
01:32:47,649 --> 01:32:49,446
Seven afternoons.

654
01:32:49,517 --> 01:32:52,248
Seven afternoons
of how older people kiss?

655
01:32:52,321 --> 01:32:54,152
<i>Ria.
You took my clothes off.</i>

656
01:32:54,223 --> 01:32:55,850
Ria stop!
Open your mouth Ria.

657
01:32:55,924 --> 01:32:57,686
Will you stop it?
Don't touch me!

658
01:32:57,759 --> 01:32:59,852
Don't touch me!

659
01:33:00,928 --> 01:33:02,657
Now he's doing it
all over again to Aliya.

660
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:04,630
She's lying, Lalit. She's lying.

661
01:33:06,234 --> 01:33:08,099
<i>You don't want to believe me?</i>

662
01:33:08,169 --> 01:33:11,263
Then fine.
I'm not a part of this.

663
01:33:13,508 --> 01:33:15,442
I'm not a part of you.

664
01:33:17,011 --> 01:33:20,708
<i>Say something, Lalit.
She's lying!</i>

665
01:33:20,782 --> 01:33:22,511
<i>You know I don't lie, chachu.</i>

666
01:33:22,583 --> 01:33:25,711
<i>You know it!
You know I don't lie!</i>

667
01:33:27,021 --> 01:33:28,749
<i>She's lying, Lalit.</i>

668
01:33:28,822 --> 01:33:31,382
Unmarried girls like Ria,
they make up all these fantasies.

669
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:33,187
Ria, Ria.

670
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,024
Ria.

671
01:33:35,096 --> 01:33:37,621
Ria, you can't go away like this.
Please.

672
01:33:45,073 --> 01:33:47,667
She's mad!

673
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:53,804
The girl's going crazy!

674
01:33:58,919 --> 01:34:00,853
Lalit.

675
01:34:30,183 --> 01:34:33,050
Please, Mama.

676
01:37:18,517 --> 01:37:20,451
Ria?

677
01:37:23,455 --> 01:37:25,286
Ria?

678
01:37:29,527 --> 01:37:31,586
<i>Ria.</i>

679
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,470
<i>Come. I want you to come home
with me just now...</i>

680
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:45,031
<i>and I don't want to listen
to anything, please.</i>

681
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,043
Just change your clothes
and come home with me.

682
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:50,808
- I'll wait for you in the other room.
- Don't pretend like nothing happened.

683
01:37:50,882 --> 01:37:52,748
Ria, I'm not pretending.
You are, you are!

684
01:37:52,818 --> 01:37:55,378
I don't even know how to console you.

685
01:37:57,423 --> 01:37:59,788
What you have gone through,
I can't even imagine it.

686
01:38:06,731 --> 01:38:08,892
Ria, if you don't come home...

687
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:16,069
<i>Come home, Ria.</i>

688
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:20,406
I don't even know what to do.

689
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,740
I don't know what to do, Ria.

690
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:26,750
My hands are tied.

691
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:31,015
<i>Tej bhai-sahab and our family
goes back a very long way.</i>

692
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,127
Then why are you punishing me?

693
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:44,566
<i>I'm not.
And your sister and your mother?</i>

694
01:38:44,636 --> 01:38:48,663
<i>Listen to me.
I cannot break up my family.</i>

695
01:38:49,741 --> 01:38:51,538
<i>I cannot.</i>

696
01:38:51,609 --> 01:38:54,100
<i>Please don't ask me
to make that choice.</i>

697
01:38:55,179 --> 01:39:00,445
<i>I don't know what Surinder bhai-sahab
would have done in my position.</i>

698
01:39:00,517 --> 01:39:03,008
I know I can never
replace your father...

699
01:39:03,086 --> 01:39:05,486
but you're my child now.

700
01:39:09,926 --> 01:39:12,918
My family means everything to me.

701
01:39:14,564 --> 01:39:16,395
Please don't leave us.

702
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,295
Please.

703
01:39:23,107 --> 01:39:25,098
Ria, if you go...

704
01:39:52,803 --> 01:39:55,363
- What's your name, little girl?
- Aliya.

705
01:39:59,743 --> 01:40:03,008
<i>Very nice.
Look up. Smile.</i>

706
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,071
Okay, smile.

707
01:40:06,116 --> 01:40:09,415
<i>Very nice. Beautiful.
What a lovely family.</i>

708
01:40:10,487 --> 01:40:12,955
<i>What's your name, please?</i>

709
01:40:13,023 --> 01:40:15,753
Ria.

710
01:40:15,826 --> 01:40:18,192
Come in front.

711
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,632
Hold it.

712
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:34,505
<i>Eyes wide open...</i>

713
01:40:34,577 --> 01:40:36,602
<i>and one, two-</i>

714
01:40:36,679 --> 01:40:39,773
Everybody now, smile together,
and watch the birdie.

715
01:40:41,684 --> 01:40:44,153
<i>And three. Very good.</i>

716
01:40:44,221 --> 01:40:46,985
<i>Okay, last picture.
Big smile, please.</i>

717
01:40:48,592 --> 01:40:50,423
Okay, thank you.

718
01:41:05,508 --> 01:41:07,908
I miss you so much, Papa.

719
01:42:25,821 --> 01:42:27,720
<i>I'll go out and receive the guests.
No.</i>

720
01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:36,995
I can't do this.

721
01:42:37,065 --> 01:42:38,760
I can't. I'm sorry.

722
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:43,270
Lalit.
I don't even want you here. Please.

723
01:42:43,338 --> 01:42:47,399
<i>I cannot allow this, bhai.</i>

724
01:42:47,475 --> 01:42:49,272
I cannot.

725
01:42:50,278 --> 01:42:54,079
Both of you just leave my home
and my family and go.

726
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:57,175
- Lalit, what are you say-
- I don't want to say any more.

727
01:42:57,253 --> 01:42:58,947
<i>Please don't make it worse.</i>

728
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:03,753
No, I don't want to say anything.
Please don't make it worse.

729
01:43:06,794 --> 01:43:08,455
<i>These are my children, raji...</i>

730
01:43:09,464 --> 01:43:12,433
and I will protect them
from myself even if I have to.

731
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,229
Please go.
