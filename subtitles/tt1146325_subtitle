1
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:41,872
'Only those who do great things...

2
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,347
...make a name for themselves.'

3
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:47,611
There are sharp-shooters,
goons and gangsters...

4
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:49,917
...but the King is above all.

5
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,363
Happy birthday, King!
- Thank you.

6
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,873
This contains my show reel as
well as my film directory.

7
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,637
This will keep you entertained
at night...

8
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,275
...as well as give me
a break in Bollywood.

9
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:21,650
Call any of the producers
or directors...

10
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,383
...to cast me as their heroine.

11
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:29,024
I'll give the top actresses
a run for their money!

12
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,824
What's wrong, Udaas? (Udaas
means 'sad' in Hindi)

13
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,029
Call me Pankaj, Raftaar!

14
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,961
Okay Pankaj, why are you sad?

15
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:42,739
You should be happy as it's
King's birthday today!

16
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:46,268
I'd once celebrated my birthday
at the Niagara falls.

17
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:52,151
My three friends got drunk
and fell in the Niagara.

18
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,678
I remember the day of
their mourning...

19
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:59,418
...each time there's
someone's birthday.

20
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,695
I can never forget that day...
- Is there any tragedy...

21
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,060
...in this world that's still
not inflicted on you?

22
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,733
Drink up!
- Okay! Cheers!

23
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,431
Lucky! We'll have to
take care of Mika.

24
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,136
He's mistaking
the lamp for a woman!

25
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,106
Raftaar, look what he's up to!

26
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:19,710
Mika! You must be crazy
to dance with a lamp...

27
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,907
...when there are so many
live women present!

28
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,107
All's well?

29
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,244
Oh no!

30
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,823
Dilbaug, all the women present
here have a loose character.

31
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,459
My lamp-woman is much
better than them!

32
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:40,458
What happened?
- Mika!

33
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:42,735
For how long shall I hide
the fact from the world...

34
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:44,827
...that my brother's blind?
- What?

35
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:49,942
And also deaf in his left ear.

36
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,275
He puts the eye-drops in
his eyes and vice-versa.

37
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,838
Why don't you wear glasses?

38
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,843
Ever seen a don wearing glasses?

39
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,748
People may say what they want...

40
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,309
...but King loves Mika.

41
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,050
Mika loves him no less.

42
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:04,746
He took six bullets on his chest...

43
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:06,348
...meant for King.

44
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:11,027
Guru, why does Mika
always stare at me?

45
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,495
I wonder what script plays in
his head when he's staring.

46
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:46,294
Get up!
- Guru! Who's it this time?

47
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,457
Come with me.

48
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:11,984
Where's he gone?

49
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:14,551
There he is!

50
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,199
No!

51
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,015
Raftaar, hurry!

52
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:44,920
That fool shouldn't escape today!

53
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:48,861
How can he escape? Raftaar
is behind him...

54
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:51,260
...while above him, is the
King of the crime world!

55
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:59,030
Today, we'll chop him into pieces!

56
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,506
Stuff him in this bag.
I'll bury it in the ground.

57
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,600
No one will know
where he disappeared!

58
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,444
Didn't you find a smaller bag?

59
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,482
We have to stuff a man inside,
not chicken lollipops!

60
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,878
Fool, of what use is a big bag?

61
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:17,421
All we have to do is hide a corpse.

62
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:31,894
Raftaar, look to your left!
Did you see him?

63
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,905
Mika's eyes are
as sharp as a hawk's!

64
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,065
Of course, I see him!

65
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,001
Hey! What are you doing?

66
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,168
Where exactly are you aiming?

67
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,369
You could've shot me!

68
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:52,382
Oh my God!

69
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,166
Today, I realize why
King's name is Lucky.

70
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,928
It's because death fears him...

71
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,974
...as much as the film
industry fears piracy!

72
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:13,370
Good bye!

73
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,704
Today, I won't spare you!

74
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,980
You lousy woman! How long...

75
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:53,485
...will you be able to preserve
your voluptuous youth?

76
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:57,619
You've turned the entire
village against me!

77
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:01,987
Today, Happy Singh will
not show any mercy...

78
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,723
...to set a woman like you straight!

79
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,123
Are you coming up or
should I come down?

80
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:10,563
I see, you want me to come down!

81
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,001
Happy, talk less and catch the hen...

82
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:16,030
...or else my son Tinku
will remain a bachelor!

83
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,642
The girl's family is coming
to see me today.

84
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:20,007
And my mother will impress them...

85
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,274
...by feeding them butter chicken!

86
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:24,748
I'll make sure you get
butter chicken today!

87
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,078
Where did she go?

88
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:31,481
Bravo!

89
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:34,220
Happy!

90
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:39,028
Sister-in-law, of all the
people in this village...

91
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:43,398
...you found this idiot
to catch the hen?!

92
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,261
You useless chap!

93
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:47,032
You can't catch a hen...

94
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,630
...and you're all set to get married?!

95
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:52,074
I thought I should take Happy's help
for menial chores like these.

96
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:54,772
Yes, but you'll soon regret it.

97
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,245
Watch how Happy makes the
entire village unhappy!

98
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,149
Go ahead, attend nature's call.

99
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,259
Stop!

100
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:21,797
Happy! Are you planning
to break our skulls open?

101
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:38,523
You're glued to the news all day!

102
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,616
Please let me watch some soaps.

103
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,558
Sure, anything for you!

104
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:53,165
What the hell, Happy!

105
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:56,306
What rescue mission
are you on this time?

106
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,671
Get aside!

107
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:06,676
What's going on?

108
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:14,123
Happy, stop!

109
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:25,365
Happy!

110
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:29,271
It is on your back. - He'll never
improve! - He's gone mad!

111
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:38,609
Move.
- Happy! Come down!

112
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,246
Have mercy, sir!

113
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:47,254
I can't afford to pay the damages.

114
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,794
Why not? Happy is solely
responsible for them.

115
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:53,263
How selfish can you get?

116
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,526
Blame me for everything!

117
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:55,726
I'm not saying anything to him.

118
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,267
I was only trying to help!

119
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,894
What kind of help, son?

120
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:00,899
You've rendered half
the village homeless!

121
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,402
At least the other half
is still intact!

122
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,169
So what if half the village
is unsettled...

123
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:05,733
...at least Tinku is
about to settle down.

124
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:06,903
Mother!

125
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:09,909
Son, you speak so well!

126
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,581
That's because I speak the truth.

127
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:12,742
Hence, people endear to it.

128
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:14,342
But who'll pay the damages?

129
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,245
The one who's always paid.

130
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:20,222
The headman and my grandfather,
Sir Gurucharan.

131
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,817
Grandpa, throw the money
in their faces!

132
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,262
One day, I'll be thrown out
of the village! - Grandpa!

133
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,659
What's the damage?

134
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,393
We haven't decided the punishment
for the offender yet.

135
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:33,198
This fool broke into our house...

136
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,206
...and destroyed our T. V...

137
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:36,400
...furniture etc.

138
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:37,935
He broke our bones too!
- Yes!

139
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,846
Some thieves broke into
their house last night.

140
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,246
Scared, they hid themselves
under the bed.

141
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:46,215
How would I know that they're

142
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,343
...not thieves?

143
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,614
I trampled all over them!

144
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,211
'I trampled all over them! '

145
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,754
Are you a cop that you'd
gone to nab the thieves?

146
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,223
In the process of helping others...

147
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:55,487
...you destroy them!

148
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,492
Rangeela, he's your best friend.

149
00:11:58,731 --> 00:11:59,959
What harm has he done to you?

150
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,494
That girl in the yellow
suit deeply interests me.

151
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,498
Look, she just nudged me.

152
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:07,964
Is she not younger to you?

153
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,799
So what? At least, she'll
be under control.

154
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,968
Do something, my friend!

155
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,403
Send three wrestlers in
the guise of goons.

156
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,482
Fight them and win the
girl's heart over.

157
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:30,926
You idiots! Aren't you
ashamed of eve-teasing?

158
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:33,858
C'mon scoot!

159
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,758
This is the height of shamelessness!

160
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:40,703
Prito, Rangeela had hired
goons to trouble you.

161
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,374
That idiot!

162
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:48,011
Sir, he's not my friend!
He's my worst enemy!

163
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:52,547
You've insulted me!
I can't bear it anymore!

164
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,016
Stop the court proceedings!

165
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,379
Goodness is no longer appreciated!

166
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,013
Happy has broken my T.V. Too.

167
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,352
The one that I'd bought on loan.

168
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,893
Just looking at the remote
brings tears to my eyes.

169
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,290
But Happy is good at heart...

170
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:06,297
...isn't he?
- Yes, he is...

171
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:09,766
Doesn't he help everyone
in the village? - Yes.

172
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:11,769
Say yes!

173
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:15,034
Aunt, your son is getting
married after 4 days.

174
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:19,036
If Happy doesn't come, who
will entertain the guests?

175
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,412
Mother, that idiot has come!

176
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,455
Today's a day of celebration!

177
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,586
The time is auspicious, too.

178
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:41,599
He who was in rags until
yesterday... - Oh great!

179
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:44,335
He who was in rags
until yesterday...

180
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,894
...is now a groom wearing a suit!

181
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:51,871
Don't talk about the family.
- Oh great!

182
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:55,812
Don't talk about the family,
it'll scare the kids away!

183
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:57,406
They'll moan in dismay.

184
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,580
They'll slap their
chests in agony.

185
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,680
They'll slap their
chests in agony.

186
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:07,089
They'll slap their
chests in agony.

187
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,492
They'll slap their
chests in agony.

188
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:13,054
They'll slap their
chests in agony.

189
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,091
C'mon, start the music!

190
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,579
Your brother...
- What the hell! - Oh great!

191
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,381
Is so notorious!
- What the hell! - Oh great!

192
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,119
While your sister- Oh great!

193
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,082
...is squint-eyed. - Oh great!

194
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,954
Your dad is a drunkard.
- Oh great!

195
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,789
While your mother's penniless!
- Oh great!

196
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,658
Your uncle's a limp.
- Oh great!

197
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:45,560
But he dances to Bhangra!
- Oh great!

198
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:47,394
They call you...
- Oh great!

199
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,457
...a shameless fellow!
- Oh great!

200
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,400
You dance to get attention...

201
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,461
...wearing perfume,
donning a groom's turban.

202
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:58,405
You dance to get attention...

203
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,468
...wearing perfume, donning
a groom's turban.

204
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,413
You wear rented suit,
hire your boots!

205
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:07,145
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

206
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,020
Whoever made you a groom,
you idiot!

207
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,617
You idiot...

208
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:18,425
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

209
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:22,490
Whoever made you a groom,
you idiot!

210
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:37,179
Oh great!

211
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,917
I was everyone's favourite.

212
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:40,714
I've been a bachelor for eons!

213
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,454
I'm still single...

214
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,648
...while you've readily mingled!

215
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,191
You've betrayed your friend.

216
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,720
Consider our friendship broken.

217
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,455
May you feel ashamed...

218
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,053
...each time you look at me.

219
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,530
Jeet! Harjeet!

220
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,460
Are you listening, Manjeet?

221
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:59,202
I'm left high and
dry while he becomes a groom!

222
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,598
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

223
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:06,475
Whoever made you a groom,
you idiot!

224
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:10,040
You idiot...

225
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:13,847
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

226
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,787
Whoever made you a groom,
you idiot!

227
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:31,159
Oh great!

228
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:36,499
Oh great!

229
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:38,133
Why repent now?

230
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,837
Let bygones be bygones.

231
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,513
Thank your stars...

232
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,173
...you have me as your friend.

233
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,581
You're a selfish fellow.

234
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,676
But your wife's beautiful.
- Oh great!

235
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:51,086
I'll stare at her
for hours together.

236
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:52,749
Teeti! Tony!

237
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,588
Who can alter destiny?

238
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,819
What's the point in
harassing him now?

239
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:05,598
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

240
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:09,265
Whoever made you a groom,
you idiot!

241
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,907
You idiot...

242
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:16,607
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

243
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:20,618
Whoever made you a groom,
you idiot!

244
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,293
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

245
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:34,925
Whoever made you a groom,
you idiot!

246
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,935
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

247
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:41,962
Whoever got you married,
you idiot!

248
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,840
'Life threatening attack on Punjabi
Singh from Australia.'

249
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:51,015
This fool has disgraced our
village and Punjab at large!

250
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:55,117
Poor fellow had gone to Australia
to earn a few bucks.

251
00:17:55,821 --> 00:18:00,190
But someone slipped drugs
in his bag at the airport.

252
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:01,685
He got jailed.

253
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,888
Hot blooded that he was,
he had to take revenge.

254
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:06,157
Killed everybody on being released
and earned the name 'King.'

255
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:09,324
He gifted a mansion to his family.

256
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:12,599
Uncle's health has worsened!

257
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,729
Someone fetch a trolley!

258
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:16,171
Come on, hurry up!

259
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,334
Carefully.
- Hurry up!

260
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,247
Looks like uncle just got the
news of the attack on his son.

261
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,117
He must've had a heart stroke.

262
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,982
He had an asthma attack!

263
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:32,352
He'll be fine after getting
a shot at the hospital.

264
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,924
Let's call the asthma attack,
a heart attack!

265
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:40,732
There can't be a better way to
drive Happy out of the village!

266
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:44,835
He's tormented the entire village!
- That's a good idea.

267
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,631
Why don't you just admit that as
long as Happy's in the village...

268
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,175
...he won't let you marry Prito?

269
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,744
My marriage's already
fixed, my friend!

270
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,678
I'm more concerned about
the villagers.

271
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:59,041
Lets' send Happy to Australia
to fetch Lucky.

272
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,050
Lucky will never come back.

273
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:02,211
Happy will have no choice
but to stay put.

274
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:03,946
But how will we send him?

275
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:07,057
He's an emotional fellow.
Let's get him emotional.

276
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,184
When we grow up...

277
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,319
Did you read the papers?

278
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:13,763
It landed Lakhan's dad straight
into the hospital!

279
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,668
Yes! Although it was the
son who was shot...

280
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:22,298
...the father landed up in the
hospital! He got a heart attack!

281
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:23,900
That's sad!

282
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:28,176
What's sad is that Punjab
is earning a bad name.

283
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,976
All the newspapers read,
'Lakhan of Punjab.'

284
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:36,412
True. The entire state gets
the blame for his bad deeds.

285
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,282
Yes. Chhotu, let's go to
the tube well.

286
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,257
It's very sad, friend.
- What is?

287
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:45,762
Uncle's in the hospital, counting
his last breaths.

288
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,794
He remembers just two
people in that state.

289
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,797
Lucky and Happy.

290
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,129
Happy and Lucky.

291
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:58,274
Where are these blokes going after
closing down their shops?

292
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,804
To the hospital, to
see Lucky's father.

293
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,446
He's such a good human being.

294
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,150
Only a fool wouldn't visit uncle.

295
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:07,376
Absolutely.

296
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,212
Happy. - Yes, uncle. - The entire
village has gone to the hospital.

297
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,348
Why aren't you going?

298
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,018
I am going, have patience!

299
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,458
Hopefully, I won't have
to take you along.

300
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,320
Hold the cow-dung for me.
I'm going to the hospital.

301
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:19,465
Don't eat it thinking
its chocolate cake.

302
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:22,298
Brother, if the old man doesn't
howl on seeing him...

303
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,700
...our plan will flop!
- Don't worry.

304
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,363
I've taken care of everything.

305
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,368
I've shown him his son's
photo in the newspaper.

306
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,433
Just watch how he wails now!

307
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:35,809
He's come!
- Happy!

308
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,509
How's uncle?
- He's in a bad shape.

309
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:42,776
He won't give up until
he sees his son.

310
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:46,619
That fool has turned the
entire world against him!

311
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:51,392
The more we try to forget him,
the more we miss him.

312
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:55,331
We threw him out of
our lives long ago.

313
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,334
Yet, we miss him.

314
00:20:57,402 --> 00:21:00,838
It's a matter of the heart after all.

315
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,473
He's got a heart attack. His
heart is bound to ache.

316
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:12,339
Happy, there's no one educated
in our village...

317
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:16,353
...who can make these old
folks meet their sons...

318
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,413
...and restore the village's honour.

319
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:20,549
Shame on us!

320
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:25,021
What did you say? You'll go
to Australia to fetch Lucky?!

321
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:29,966
It's not easy to be the most
sought after gangster.

322
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,427
Somebody will kill him
in that foreign land.

323
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:35,435
His old parents won't
even find his corpse.

324
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:38,441
Forget it! You're talking
like a saint today.

325
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,410
Tomorrow, you'll go back
to your old ways.

326
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,447
Mind your tongue, Rangeela!

327
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:48,048
I, Happy Singh, promise you...

328
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,714
...that until I don't bring
Lucky back home...

329
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,450
...I won't step into
this village again.

330
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,786
The fish is hooked on to the bait!

331
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:54,917
Cheer him!

332
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:56,460
Happy!
- Long live!

333
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:57,995
Happy!
- Long live!

334
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,553
Happy!
- Long live!

335
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:03,465
Happy! Happy! Enough!
- Long live!

336
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:05,560
Stop shouting slogans! Long live!

337
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,974
Happy, how will you go abroad?

338
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,544
You don't even have a passport.

339
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:16,070
Sir, I take that responsibility.

340
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,073
I have many contacts in
the passport department.

341
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,812
But one needs a lot of
money to go abroad.

342
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,081
I've already sold all my property.

343
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:24,417
Whenever the village has
faced any problem...

344
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,821
...the villagers collect donations
from the people. - Right.

345
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,156
And then, he's the biggest problem
of the village! - Hey!

346
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,964
I mean, he's about to solve the
village's biggest problem! Yes.

347
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,022
The villagers will arrange
for the money.

348
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,834
But he's never set foot
outside the village!

349
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,667
How will he go abroad?

350
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:45,465
Sir, why not send another
villager along with him?

351
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:47,512
Yes, that'll be fine.
- Yes.

352
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:51,505
Who's the most idle person
in the village?

353
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,483
Most idle...

354
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,577
Rangeela!

355
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,522
He knows English too!

356
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,526
I... I know... no English! I won't go!

357
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,518
What about your wedding now?

358
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,621
C'mon! Go, Rangeela.

359
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:08,063
What are you talking about?
- I'm not going!

360
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:16,099
Don't be so melodramatic.
You're not going forever!

361
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:22,541
They are gone! Why worry now?

362
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,479
Sing and dance along!

363
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:26,483
Dance to the beat of Bhangra!

364
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,143
Celebrate the end of nuisance!

365
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:32,551
'Welcome to Delhi airport.'

366
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:35,092
Stop fooling around!

367
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,686
Ma'am, where's gate number 2?

368
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,091
We're not strolling in the fields.

369
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:43,968
We're going abroad.

370
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:45,561
Walk straight.

371
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:46,695
Don't look at the ceiling and walk.

372
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,236
Sir, watch out!

373
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:51,700
Where's my passport?

374
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:53,902
You stupid!

375
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,173
You're stupid, your father's stupid...

376
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:56,509
...and moreover, your sister's stupid!

377
00:23:56,581 --> 00:23:59,516
I just want to go to
my beloved's house.

378
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,677
I just want to go to
my beloved's house.

379
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:02,981
Sir, you're boarding the wrong flight.

380
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,613
You're supposed to go
through gate number 7.

381
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:07,815
Your staff directed
us to gate number 2.

382
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:08,951
And now you say gate number 7!

383
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:10,585
Sir, leave or you'll miss the flight.

384
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:11,720
Yes, we're going.
- Hurry up!

385
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,959
Gate number 7 is over there.

386
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:18,699
Number 7...

387
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,603
Where are you going?
- Here's the boarding card. - Sorry!

388
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:23,038
C'mon! Hurry up!
- Thank you.

389
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,645
'Welcome to Egypt.'

390
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:31,046
Please, enjoy yourselves.

391
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,550
Why do they keep saying 'Egypt? '

392
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:34,676
Nothing to worry.

393
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,653
It's fashionable to change
the names of places.

394
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:39,618
Bombay has become Mumbai,
Madras is Chennai.

395
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:41,124
Lakhanpal has become Lucky!

396
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:44,756
Exactly! Similarly, Australia
has become Egypt!

397
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:56,630
We're surrounded by cops
and you're laughing?!

398
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:00,701
I'm laughing thinking
what just happened.

399
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,579
The one who had to go to Egypt,
has reached Australia!

400
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:05,911
What must he be going through?
Just imagine!

401
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:07,713
Now stop joking and get away!
- Alright! Okay!

402
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:12,714
Rangeela!

403
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,658
It's such a lovely city,
such wonderful people!

404
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:18,592
They're not only arranging for
our tickets to Australia...

405
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:20,790
...but also arranging
for our one day visa.

406
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,925
C'mon, let's go sight-seeing.

407
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,093
You must be out of your mind.

408
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,195
For the past 10 hours, our knees
were stuffed into our mouths.

409
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:29,870
If we don't stretch them now,
we'll be paralyzed for life!

410
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:32,671
You too lie down.
- You never listen to me!

411
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:36,606
Stretch your legs. Spread them nicely.

412
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:37,739
Oh God!

413
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:39,808
I can't sleep. I'm going sight-seeing.

414
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:42,620
He's never set foot
outside a village...

415
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:44,678
...and wants to go sight-seeing
in Egypt!

416
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:45,814
Go to sleep quietly.

417
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,026
Oh wonderful!

418
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:53,123
Happy!

419
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,224
Just look at the idiot
stretching himself!

420
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:05,708
Where's he gone?

421
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:07,634
If this idiot gets lost...

422
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:10,738
...I'll belong neither to
Australia nor Punjab!

423
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,074
Happy!

424
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,378
What a beautiful mosque! Hey!

425
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:19,315
Hey! Stop! Somebody stop him!

426
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,325
Thief!
- Somebody stop!

427
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:22,917
Thief?!
- Thief! - Catch him!

428
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:25,120
Move!

429
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,768
Move!

430
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:52,052
Get out of the way!

431
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:04,198
Move! Get out!

432
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,873
Get away! Move!

433
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,849
Stop there!

434
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:35,859
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

435
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,231
God has given you two hands
and legs to work...

436
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:38,394
...and not to steal.

437
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,062
Give me the purse.

438
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:41,833
Here, take this.

439
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:01,283
By God!

440
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,459
Here's your thief.

441
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:10,292
She'll kill him!

442
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,094
Stop him! His nose is bleeding.

443
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:17,164
What are you doing? Have mercy.
- Have mercy on a criminal?!

444
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:19,233
What are you doing?
- I'll call the police.

445
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,844
Wait, my bag!

446
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,077
Sir, please save me! She's
going to kill me!

447
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,341
Run for your life!

448
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:28,785
Hey! Where are you going?

449
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:32,846
Where are you doing? Let him go.
- Come back here!

450
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:34,858
I'll kill you!

451
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,190
O mighty hulk!

452
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,896
I'm not ready to run another
10 kilometers! Calm down.

453
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,292
Thanks for your help.
- Yes.

454
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,860
You're really nice.

455
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:48,803
You had to go through so much
trouble because of me.

456
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:50,864
No problem.

457
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:53,467
It's a Sikh's duty to help people.

458
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:55,979
Well, I must say, you're
a fabulous runner.

459
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,015
And you, a fabulous hitter!
- Really?

460
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,110
Anyway, nice to meet you.

461
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,881
Deep inside.
- Okay, miss you.

462
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,891
Now that's like my lady-Iove!

463
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:12,454
Innocent looks, aggressive nature...

464
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,966
By Lord! She's set my heart on fire.

465
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:20,903
Oh no, he messed the place. - Oh no!

466
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,701
He should be around here.

467
00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:27,034
Sir! English!

468
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:30,405
Turban man?
- No!

469
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,416
Green... Tall...
- No!

470
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:38,421
My friend, turban!
- Your friend?

471
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:40,423
Catch him!
- Get out of here! - What happened?

472
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:44,427
Catch him! - Run for your life!
- Don't let him escape.

473
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,140
God has made you so beautiful!

474
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:08,446
God has made you so beautiful!

475
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,448
All I want is to stare at you...

476
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:13,780
Oh Careful!
- Don't push! - What's the matter?

477
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:15,455
Oh! It's you.
- It's nothing.

478
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:18,794
The earth shook, I became
giddy and fell down.

479
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,095
The earth shook?!
- Yes.

480
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:23,059
Nothing of that sort happened.

481
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,464
No, it did. You must've not realized...

482
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:27,470
Anyway, forget it. What
are you doing here?

483
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:30,135
You too want to get a tattoo done?
- Tattoo?!

484
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:33,904
Photo. I mean, a picture. See?

485
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,639
Yes, I too want a tattoo.

486
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:39,114
Get a nice tattoo done.

487
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:40,480
Okay? - Okay.

488
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:47,150
Did you say something?
- There he is! Get him! - Nab him.

489
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:50,990
I was asking in Arabic,
if there was a boutique nearby.

490
00:30:51,061 --> 00:30:52,653
Oh I see. - I want to buy a dress.

491
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:54,989
It's my friend's party today.

492
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:57,226
Anyway, nice to meet you again!

493
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:02,502
Good bye.
- Good bye.

494
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:09,644
O shopkeeper, tattoo
her beautiful face all over me!

495
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:10,771
Taxi!

496
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:17,512
Taxi! Taxi!

497
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:20,854
Strange country!

498
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:22,992
The taxis here don't seem to halt!

499
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:25,087
In my country...

500
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:29,027
...people would've fought tooth
and nail to give you a lift.

501
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,532
You're interesting.

502
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:31,795
That's because I speak the truth.

503
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:33,232
Hence, people endear to it.

504
00:31:34,671 --> 00:31:35,968
I'm running late.

505
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,031
I'm hungry too, but these lousy taxis!

506
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,702
Will you sit in that red Impala?

507
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:43,204
Whose car is it?

508
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:45,976
How does that matter
to you? Come with me.

509
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:48,209
Okay.
- Careful.

510
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,281
What are you doing?
- Quiet! Hey!

511
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:54,557
This will spoil the car's engine.
- How's that?

512
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,616
Go and tell them that I'm a very
good mechanic from India.

513
00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:58,786
If he fixes the car,
they'll have to give you a lift.

514
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,565
Go, hurry up!
- Isn't it working?

515
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,108
Excuse me? Do you have
a problem with the car?

516
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:13,643
This mechanic is from India.

517
00:32:14,578 --> 00:32:15,772
Should he see? Check?

518
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,609
Yes, yes.
- Okay.

519
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:20,241
Greetings!
- Greetings!

520
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:22,308
I'm a mechanic from 'Guru
Nanak' garage in India.

521
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,917
It's not the bonnet,
the problem lies inside.

522
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,927
Searching for the problem.

523
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:37,925
Okay?

524
00:32:40,737 --> 00:32:43,968
Ask him to start the car.
- Try and start the car.

525
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:47,334
Just try. - Wow! - That's it.

526
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:49,812
It's all God's grace!

527
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:51,278
India is great!
- Yes!

528
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:52,747
Can we go?
- Yes, sure!

529
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:00,288
Happy!

530
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,623
This idiot will never improve!

531
00:33:04,128 --> 00:33:05,186
Do you want to drink?

532
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:06,687
Now, that's like it!

533
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,092
Have some?

534
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:16,870
Yes, thanks. I see, you like
to drink like us men.

535
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:18,232
Give me some as well.

536
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:25,877
Do check your bag, to see
if anything's missing.

537
00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:28,782
Not needed. The bag is empty.

538
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:31,712
The bag is empty?!

539
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:33,655
You harassed the poor
fellow for nothing!

540
00:33:34,658 --> 00:33:35,716
Poor fellow?!

541
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:38,693
He is a criminal! And for
your kind information...

542
00:33:38,795 --> 00:33:39,989
...I'm studying law!

543
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,696
I see, you're becoming a liar!

544
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:47,363
Not liar, a lawyer!

545
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:51,664
I'm doing research on criminology.
- I see! I'm writing a book on...

546
00:33:51,742 --> 00:33:54,677
...how to wipe out the criminals
from the society.

547
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:56,004
Must I say something?

548
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:59,215
Don't hate the criminals.

549
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,885
One can reform them. Hello!

550
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,943
One can never reform them!

551
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:07,680
The criminals are a disgrace
to the society...

552
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:10,955
...and any punishment meted
out to them is less.

553
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:19,158
These criminals should be...

554
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:28,968
I'm a kind of girl who
likes a little fun.

555
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,377
And loves the game I want to play.

556
00:34:30,781 --> 00:34:32,942
I think naughty is nice
and sugar is spice.

557
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,711
Are you listening to what I say?

558
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,946
We have nothing to
fear or worry about.

559
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,954
So c'mon baby, get down!

560
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:40,990
C'mon everybody, say it loud.

561
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:42,787
I'll tell you what it's all about.

562
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:44,724
Hey man! C'mon!

563
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,729
Let's get down, get to it.

564
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:48,822
Hey man! Have a little fun.

565
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,799
There's really nothing to it.

566
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:52,835
Life's a party, why
are you so stuck up?

567
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:55,872
Get a move on boy and you'll see.
- Hey man!

568
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:58,908
On your mark, be steady. Are
you ready to play with me?

569
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:00,807
All the ladies...

570
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:02,970
...are going crazy with the rhythm.

571
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,741
The music is speeding.

572
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:06,840
Yes, it's heating up the night.

573
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:08,746
Life's a party.

574
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:10,946
Live it to the fullest.

575
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:14,923
Who cares about what
will happen tomorrow?

576
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:16,755
It's my wish...

577
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:18,988
...to make you sit beside me.

578
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,757
It's my wish...

579
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,197
...to make you sit beside me.

580
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:32,769
It's my wish...

581
00:35:32,843 --> 00:35:34,936
...to make you sit beside me.

582
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:36,775
It's my wish...

583
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:38,781
...to make you sit beside me.

584
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:39,907
Just one time...

585
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,441
Just one time...

586
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,852
Just one time...

587
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:49,050
Embrace me...

588
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:53,852
Embrace me, my lady.

589
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,798
Embrace me, my lady.

590
00:35:57,868 --> 00:36:02,134
Embrace me, my lady.

591
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:04,807
I'm a holler to my ladies,
to my divas, to my girls.

592
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:05,933
We're just looking for some fun...

593
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:07,067
...not diamonds or pearls.

594
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:08,805
Say you want to come along, we're
going to have a lot of fun.

595
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,813
We're going to party all night
till the sun comes up.

596
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:12,872
In the morning, a new day
is dawning, so say...

597
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,814
In the morning...

598
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:16,819
You're ready for some fun,
step into my car.

599
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:17,945
We're going to take you for a ride.

600
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:19,079
Let me hear you say.

601
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:23,092
All the ladies are going
crazy with the rhythm.

602
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,821
The music is speeding.

603
00:36:24,895 --> 00:36:26,886
Yes, it's heating up the night.

604
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:28,825
Life's a party!

605
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:30,992
Live it to the fullest.

606
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:34,834
Who cares about what
will happen tomorrow?

607
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:38,500
Just one time, take
my name with love.

608
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:42,511
Just one time, ask for my love
and you shall receive.

609
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:46,845
I don't want anything else...

610
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:50,910
...except this, if it's God's will.

611
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:54,388
God, you're so kind.

612
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:56,849
God, you're so kind.

613
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:58,952
Answer my prayers for once.

614
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:00,860
All I want...

615
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:02,990
...is to run away with you.

616
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:04,863
All I want...

617
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:06,869
...is to run away with you.

618
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:13,866
Run away with you...

619
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:17,311
I don't care about that.

620
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:20,345
Then I won't care if anyone
comes in my way.

621
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:24,477
Hey lady, hold my hand.

622
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:28,551
Then I won't care who
comes in my way.

623
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:32,623
Hey lady, hold my hand.

624
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:36,423
Then I won't care who
comes in my way.

625
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:41,462
Hey lady, hold my hand.

626
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:42,903
Life's a party!

627
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:45,032
Live it to the fullest.

628
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:49,135
Who cares about what
will happen tomorrow?

629
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:50,907
Life's a party!

630
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:53,040
Live it to the fullest.

631
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:57,280
Who cares about what
will happen tomorrow?

632
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:03,017
Dear fellow, what are
you punishing me for?

633
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:05,927
I've toured entire Egypt just
trying to get hold of you.

634
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:07,221
Where the hell were you?

635
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:11,459
Where I was, and where I am now!

636
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,563
Am I dreaming? Or is this reality?

637
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:17,096
Where has my lady-Iove disappeared?

638
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:20,337
Forget about your lady-Iove!
Listen to me carefully!

639
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:23,469
If we didn't have to bring
Lucky back from Australia...

640
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,142
...I swear by God, I wouldn't
have budged from here.

641
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:27,945
Do you know why we landed up here?

642
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:29,212
It was our bad luck!

643
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:33,086
No! It's because I was destined
to meet my lady-Iove!

644
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:35,191
Do you know why I'm still unmarried?

645
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:36,316
You're a fool, that's why!

646
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:37,960
No, I'm not a fool!

647
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:39,493
It's because my lady-Iove
was in Egypt...

648
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,030
...and I was looking for her in Punjab!

649
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:43,462
I'll have to come here again.

650
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,093
First, I have to make
grandpa meet her.

651
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:49,366
Then I have to marry her,
produce kids. After that...

652
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:53,307
Listen to me, you fool! First
find a way to produce money.

653
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:54,468
After that, you may produce kids.

654
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:55,704
C'mon, we have to go to Australia!

655
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:13,324
The luggage should've
been here a day ago.

656
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:14,454
How did it get misplaced?

657
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:18,992
You fool! You should've let the
wallet and Lakhan's address...

658
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:22,527
...remain in my bag! What
are we going to do now?

659
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:27,009
All day, all night, all you do is
complain! - 'AII I do is complain! '

660
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:29,011
The luggage will be traced. They've
asked us to come in the evening.

661
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,579
We have to find Lakhan. Follow me!

662
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:36,247
I am Happy!
- Good for you.

663
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:40,089
My name is Happy Singh,
a friend of King.

664
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,719
King! He is not happy!

665
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,030
Rangeela, see how I managed
to hitch a ride!

666
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:52,025
Of what use are the cops...

667
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:54,570
...if they don't know the whereabouts
of the criminals?

668
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:56,697
Don't mess with the white cops!

669
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,172
They'll throw you into the sea!

670
00:39:58,241 --> 00:39:59,469
Am I their father's property?

671
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:05,571
What a big house!

672
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:07,378
It's not a house, but a mansion!

673
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,214
That's Raftaar!
- Raftaar!

674
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:12,554
Look, he's bowing to welcome us!

675
00:40:12,622 --> 00:40:16,058
Bless you, dear!

676
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:20,421
I'm not asking for charity.

677
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:24,090
Just tell me the price of your casino.

678
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:26,059
It's my bread and butter, King.

679
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:29,436
Yes, everyone needs bread and butter.

680
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,070
But only when they're alive.

681
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,642
King, Happy has come from the village.

682
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:38,205
He's accompanied by Rangeela.

683
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:39,806
Happy!

684
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,607
Where are you, my friend?

685
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:45,213
Who's that hiding his face?

686
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:49,751
He's Sheru's brother, Pankaj Singh!

687
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:52,152
Hey, Happy!

688
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:55,430
Dilbaug!

689
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,259
Look, how he's bowing with respect.

690
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,100
'It's commonplace to hear
on every street...

691
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:05,164
...that brother Lakhan is a thief! '

692
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:07,100
'It's commonplace to hear
on every street...

693
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:09,645
...that brother Lakhan is a thief! '

694
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,638
Have you forgotten how you
stole pencils as a kid?

695
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:16,117
Today, you're a big gangster!

696
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:17,244
Hello, sister-in-law!

697
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:21,255
Should I salute you or hug you?

698
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:23,189
Happy, what are you up to?

699
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:31,531
Happy, come here.
Have you come alone?

700
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:33,795
No, brother Rangeela has come along.

701
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,633
Touch his feet.
- Never mind.

702
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,231
Greetings, brother Lucky!

703
00:41:38,141 --> 00:41:39,199
Greetings, sister-in-law!

704
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:40,400
He's also addressing
me as sister-in-law?!

705
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:43,209
How did a romantic track
begin in an action film?

706
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:44,805
Happy and Rangeela!

707
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:47,148
What are they doing here?

708
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:50,151
Remember how your parents...

709
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,278
...raised you...

710
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:54,849
The time has come for you
to become their strength.

711
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,151
You've started to speak well.

712
00:41:58,428 --> 00:41:59,759
That's because I speak the truth.

713
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:02,154
Hence, people endear to it.

714
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:04,156
Now c'mon, come back to the village.

715
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:05,459
I can't.

716
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:09,430
How can you do such criminal
deeds being a Sikh?

717
00:42:10,173 --> 00:42:13,165
People swear by our community's
trust and honesty!

718
00:42:13,243 --> 00:42:16,178
C'mon, don't create a fuss!

719
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:17,304
Happy!

720
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:20,215
Have you forgotten what
our guru taught us?

721
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:23,414
He'd named our community 'Khalsa.'

722
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:25,451
'Khalsa' means pure.

723
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:27,183
You should become true 'Khalsa.'
- Happy!

724
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,284
Shun dishonesty and quietly
return to the village with me.

725
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,520
Strive to become a true 'Sikh.'

726
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:33,729
Happy! - Hey!

727
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,930
Well done! Only this was
left to see now.

728
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,535
Now you're a threatening
a fellow villager!

729
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:43,867
Mika, they're standing
to your right.

730
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,370
Happy! What's wrong
with your brother?

731
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:47,705
Who are you aiming the gun at?

732
00:42:47,777 --> 00:42:51,577
I removed the gun out of
respect towards my brother.

733
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:53,473
But these two belong to our village.

734
00:42:53,817 --> 00:42:55,216
How can I possibly pull
the gun at them?

735
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:57,218
He's a saint, despite being a sinner!

736
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:58,345
Rangeela!
- Yes, brother.

737
00:42:58,421 --> 00:43:00,218
Go back to your country with your
friend in the next flight.

738
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:01,515
C'mon!

739
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:03,889
Make sure I don't have
to tell you again.

740
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:06,218
I understood the first time.

741
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:08,230
What did you understand?

742
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:12,667
I used to carry you around
on my shoulders!

743
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:16,729
And now, you're throwing me out?

744
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:17,864
Thank your stars I'm
only pushing you...

745
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:19,841
...or I would've shot you by now!

746
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:23,709
You'll regret it!
You will rot in hell.

747
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,247
Don't you have any manners?

748
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:27,249
Is this how you behave with guests?

749
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:28,375
Rogues!

750
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,444
It took us 3 days to get to Lucky...

751
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,548
...but he threw us out
in less than 3 minutes!

752
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:37,256
He won't come back.

753
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:38,817
So, let's return.

754
00:43:39,662 --> 00:43:40,890
With defeat written all over my face?

755
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:43,260
I'd promised in front of everyone...

756
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,925
...that I'll return only with Lucky.

757
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:46,360
I'm not going anywhere.

758
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,262
Look, we had lied to you about
the asthma attack...

759
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,834
...being a heart attack
to get rid of you.

760
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,006
What about Lucky's parents?

761
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:01,275
Were their tears false as well?

762
00:44:02,552 --> 00:44:05,282
They must've reached the airport
even before our flight took off...

763
00:44:05,355 --> 00:44:07,346
...awaiting their son
to come back home.

764
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:09,950
I won't return without him!

765
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,891
Anyway, you're about to get married.

766
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:13,292
Go ahead, become a groom!

767
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:15,354
But I want you to be there, you fool!

768
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:20,297
If Prito has to become mine...

769
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,564
...she'll have to wait.

770
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:24,300
I can't leave you alone.

771
00:44:32,715 --> 00:44:35,309
C'mon, let's go to the airport
and fetch the luggage.

772
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:37,580
Forget the airport!
I can't walk anymore.

773
00:44:37,654 --> 00:44:39,053
Let's fetch the luggage.

774
00:44:39,322 --> 00:44:40,789
Our underwear's are three days' old.

775
00:44:40,857 --> 00:44:42,848
Never mind. Old is gold.

776
00:44:42,926 --> 00:44:43,984
I'm fine.

777
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,891
You're stinking, you fool! Listen.

778
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:48,328
My dear fellow, stay put.

779
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:50,332
Because even if you don't get lost
in this foreign land...

780
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,458
...I surely will.

781
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:54,997
Hey you Englishman!

782
00:44:55,071 --> 00:44:57,335
Your people said in the morning
to come in the evening.

783
00:44:57,407 --> 00:45:00,342
Now its evening, but my
luggage is still missing.

784
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:03,073
Why trouble a poor man?

785
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:05,472
Sir, this is a counter
for ticket booking.

786
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,515
Go there if your luggage is missing.

787
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:10,715
Oh no! I'll have to speak
in English once again!

788
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:13,354
What's wrong with him?

789
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,965
Hey! Who's it?

790
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:32,371
Hello! What are you doing here?

791
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,576
I've been observing you
from my shop all day.

792
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:35,872
What are your intentions?

793
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:37,437
My shop has a security siren...

794
00:45:37,513 --> 00:45:38,912
...as well as a camera installed.

795
00:45:38,982 --> 00:45:41,382
Try anything, and the cops
will catch you immediately!

796
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:44,784
Hey cop woman! What cops
are you talking about?

797
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:46,719
Who do you think I am?

798
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:47,949
You look like a thief to me.

799
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:54,122
I... I'm not a thief!

800
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:57,457
Why are you laughing?

801
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:01,402
When a poor man is hungry,
he looks like a thief.

802
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:06,408
I've lost my baggage at the airport.

803
00:46:06,476 --> 00:46:08,944
I was kicked out of the house
I was supposed to visit.

804
00:46:09,012 --> 00:46:11,674
I'm hungry and have caught
a cold since morning.

805
00:46:12,015 --> 00:46:13,915
I'm not a thief. I only look like one.

806
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:16,714
Sorry. It's just that I'm all alone.

807
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,412
My shop neither has a security
siren nor a camera.

808
00:46:20,657 --> 00:46:21,851
So, you lied to me.

809
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:23,925
Hence, I panicked.

810
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:27,463
These forsaken agents
put you on the flight.

811
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:29,656
And you readily come here
to starve yourselves!

812
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:31,461
Lousy losers!

813
00:46:31,534 --> 00:46:32,933
Shut up!

814
00:46:33,002 --> 00:46:34,936
Rose!
- Hi!

815
00:46:35,038 --> 00:46:37,438
I'll have another one
of your special roses!

816
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:41,035
It's the only place in the world
I pay 100 dollars for a rose!

817
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:43,706
Thank you. It's lucky for you.

818
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,838
Yes, it is.

819
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:48,713
Stop eating grass!

820
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,009
Come here, I'll give you food.

821
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:53,450
No, my friend's going to meet me here.

822
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:55,088
My house is right here.

823
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:57,723
If your friend comes back,
you'll be able to see him.

824
00:46:58,728 --> 00:46:59,786
C'mon!

825
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,730
If you remain hungry, you'll look
like a thief cum gangster!

826
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:08,469
Oh... no!

827
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:10,104
Careful, you nut!

828
00:47:10,473 --> 00:47:12,464
His hair is like a dog's!
How on earth will he see?

829
00:47:13,076 --> 00:47:14,475
Who did that to me?
- I'm feeling very odd...

830
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:19,481
...to eat at a complete
strangers house!

831
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:21,483
You were distressed,
while I was panicking!

832
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:22,945
There, we know each other now.

833
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:24,485
You are poor, so am I.

834
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:25,612
Now, we have something
in common as well!

835
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:26,746
Which village are you from?

836
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:29,155
I'm from the actor Dharmendra's
village.

837
00:47:29,225 --> 00:47:30,487
From Sanewaal? Yes.

838
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,788
- Then we're neighbours!

839
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:39,730
I heard father had a heart attack.

840
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:42,230
When did you hear?
- What?

841
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:44,505
From whom did you hear?

842
00:47:45,074 --> 00:47:46,132
Guru told me.

843
00:47:49,112 --> 00:47:50,704
Lucky, you were father's favourite.

844
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,513
You must return to the village.

845
00:47:53,516 --> 00:47:55,848
I'll look after the affairs
of this place. Don't worry.

846
00:47:56,252 --> 00:47:58,516
Mika, who doesn't want to
return to the village?

847
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,524
I still remember how father
used to hold my finger...

848
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:05,186
...and take me for a
walk into the fields.

849
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,525
But with the number of
bad deeds to my name...

850
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:11,533
...even if I do double the
number of good deeds...

851
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:12,659
...I can never return to the village.

852
00:48:14,103 --> 00:48:15,536
Seeing Happy over here, has
brought back memories...

853
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:18,165
...of my village and family.

854
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:22,534
I've heard that the cops of 11
nations are out to get King.

855
00:48:22,612 --> 00:48:24,204
Not King, they're out to get Don!

856
00:48:24,547 --> 00:48:25,605
Don!

857
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:29,273
But there are 11 such dons
who are out to get King!

858
00:48:29,886 --> 00:48:33,117
And you've come to take these
notorious people back?!

859
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:34,554
It's not the people who're notorious...

860
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:35,921
...it's their deeds.

861
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:37,684
If we separate these two...

862
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,660
...the same people can
become good like us.

863
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,729
You're very interesting.

864
00:48:41,798 --> 00:48:43,789
That's because I speak the truth.

865
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:45,900
Hence, people endear to it.

866
00:48:48,037 --> 00:48:49,095
Want to hear another truth?

867
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:51,564
I've never seen my mother.

868
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:53,570
But after meeting you...

869
00:48:53,643 --> 00:48:55,133
...I feel that she must've
been just like you.

870
00:48:57,847 --> 00:49:00,077
He's disappeared again!

871
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,908
Happy!

872
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:05,787
Where have you disappeared, you fool?

873
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:09,689
Happy! - Hey you, shouting there!

874
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,218
Do you want me to call the police?

875
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:15,264
No! No police please!

876
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:16,593
Get off from here! Get off!

877
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,232
The old man's asked me not to scream!

878
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:20,599
How do I find him now?

879
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:24,601
Happy!

880
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:30,810
Dear! What happened?

881
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:32,980
What happened?
- You come here.

882
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:34,742
You idiot!
- Why are you chasing me?

883
00:49:35,218 --> 00:49:38,517
What happened? - I had to sleep
all night on this wooden bench.

884
00:49:38,588 --> 00:49:39,919
My bottom's become sore!

885
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,047
But, I didn't tell you
to sleep on this.

886
00:49:41,123 --> 00:49:42,181
Where were you all night?

887
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:43,850
I was in that house waiting for you.

888
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,188
Couldn't you see me waiting for you?

889
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:46,785
How am I...

890
00:49:46,863 --> 00:49:49,889
Here comes a customer! Here
comes a customer! One minute.

891
00:49:49,966 --> 00:49:54,699
Ma'am, this bouquet costs 10 dollars.
- Yes, there you go.

892
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:55,929
Thank you.

893
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:00,908
Whose shop did you take
over overnight?

894
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:02,604
That...
- Happy! - One minute!

895
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:04,646
Son!
- Yes? - I wanted to know...

896
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:05,772
Who is this idiot?

897
00:50:05,848 --> 00:50:07,816
Hey!
- She's the owner.

898
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:09,945
This is my friend, Rangeela!

899
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:11,077
Friend, friend.

900
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:12,882
Friend?! Looks more like
your friend's father!

901
00:50:12,955 --> 00:50:14,149
Old lady, watch your tongue!

902
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:15,884
Whom did you call an old lady?!

903
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,926
Where were you all night?
Poor fellow was so worried!

904
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:19,120
Did you settle base at the airport?

905
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:22,059
This is a classic case of
thief accusing the cop!

906
00:50:22,198 --> 00:50:25,634
Back there, the 'missing luggage'
counter itself was missing!

907
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:28,663
On top of that, I'd have to explain
it to them in English!

908
00:50:29,105 --> 00:50:30,834
I... manage.
- Manage.

909
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:31,965
To hell with your manage.

910
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:34,066
Had you really gone to the
airport or someplace else?

911
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:35,872
No, he...
- She's very suspicious.

912
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,913
No, she's not. She's
very good at heart.

913
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,574
She just makes a mountain that's all.

914
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,742
Happy!
- You take rest. - Yes?

915
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:46,754
Dear, this is a yacht. You have to
decorate it with flowers. - Ok.

916
00:50:46,822 --> 00:50:49,154
I've written the address
behind. Okay? - Okay.

917
00:50:49,225 --> 00:50:50,920
Come, Mr. Rangeela.
- Get lost!

918
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:55,597
I didn't sleep last night,
didn't eat...

919
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:57,724
...and now you ask me to
come along with you!

920
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,959
We've to go to the airport
again in 2 hours.

921
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:04,897
Our trains are better
than their flights!

922
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,032
At least, it's mentioned that...

923
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:07,837
...the passengers solely are
responsible for their luggage.

924
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,277
Right? - Right. But Rangeela
is too grumpy for your age.

925
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:12,746
Your blood pressure may rise.

926
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:15,010
I've prepared lunch at home.

927
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:17,119
Go, eat and rest for a while.

928
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,679
See that house with the
window? That's mine.

929
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:21,984
Yes, I can see it.
- Take the keys. Yes.

930
00:51:22,091 --> 00:51:23,615
Go. Don't go to a wrong house.

931
00:51:23,693 --> 00:51:24,751
We won't. Thank you.

932
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:26,690
Happy!
- Yes? - Yes?

933
00:51:27,363 --> 00:51:28,625
People say that whosoever I pray for...

934
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:32,759
...God showers His blessings
upon him. Yes.

935
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:37,703
Take this. Today, you'll succeed
at everything you do.

936
00:51:38,374 --> 00:51:39,739
Go, dear. May God be with you.

937
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:41,174
I'm bound to succeed...

938
00:51:41,243 --> 00:51:42,767
...now that I look like Pandit Nehru.

939
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:44,704
Good luck.

940
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:50,778
Everything looks fine on the outside...

941
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:52,753
...but what do I do about
the mess I created inside?

942
00:51:53,122 --> 00:51:56,717
Oh Lord Waheguru, help me.

943
00:51:57,326 --> 00:52:00,762
Hurry up, Udaas!
- Okay, just relax.

944
00:52:01,964 --> 00:52:03,022
Welcome!

945
00:52:03,733 --> 00:52:04,791
Mika! Mika!

946
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:08,027
Actually, I've bought a
yacht for the first time.

947
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,662
Whether it's your first
love or your first boat...

948
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,004
...it's the same feeling. Oh!

949
00:52:13,676 --> 00:52:14,734
I love you! I love you!

950
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,278
I'd once bought a boat in the village.

951
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:20,179
I went fishing with my uncle in it.

952
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:25,410
A crocodile got hooked on to the
bait and swallowed my uncle.

953
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:29,749
Ever since, mother has not
cooked fish in the house.

954
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,696
In the entire village...
- Enough Udaas! Enough

955
00:52:34,764 --> 00:52:36,163
Why didn't the crocodile
swallow you instead?

956
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:38,828
Who's it? Hands up!

957
00:52:38,934 --> 00:52:40,765
It's me, Happy!

958
00:52:40,836 --> 00:52:42,167
Not again!

959
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:44,297
This idiot's come back!

960
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:46,265
What do we do with him?

961
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:48,434
You've still not gone back?!

962
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:50,842
He won't go so easily.

963
00:52:50,913 --> 00:52:54,713
King, you don't know him. He
sticks like a chewing gum!

964
00:52:54,784 --> 00:52:57,844
What do you mean? Enough! Happy,
this is not Punjab.

965
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,781
Over here, people do as I say.

966
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:03,214
That's what I'm telling you,
this is not Punjab!

967
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:05,120
Let's all return to the village.

968
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:09,926
I'm begging you! I've
met your parents.

969
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,392
I've seen the tears in their eyes.

970
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:15,794
They have expectations from you,
ever thought about that?

971
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:17,168
It's their wish to see you married...

972
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,942
...to see you become
a groom, you idiot!

973
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:25,038
Friends and relatives dancing
at your wedding...

974
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:27,810
The entire village rejoicing,
fireworks in the sky...

975
00:53:29,151 --> 00:53:30,948
Hey! Why are you bursting them now?

976
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:41,895
Who's that? Who's it? Where's
it? Why is this happening?

977
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:51,871
Lucky!
- Uncle, c'mon!

978
00:53:57,346 --> 00:53:58,836
Don't panic! It's me!

979
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:07,513
Oh no!

980
00:55:00,943 --> 00:55:02,410
Who is this man?

981
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:05,575
I've been swimming for so long!

982
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:07,143
Why am I not reaching the shore?

983
00:55:07,483 --> 00:55:09,508
Am I swimming in the wrong direction?

984
00:55:23,332 --> 00:55:24,390
What's wrong with King?

985
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:25,925
What happened to Lucky?

986
00:55:26,468 --> 00:55:27,935
They've extracted the bullet...

987
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,999
...but he has a serious head injury.

988
00:55:30,472 --> 00:55:34,033
Thank God for his turban, or
he wouldn't have been alive.

989
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:36,942
But he's contracted a strange
disease due to his injuries.

990
00:55:37,012 --> 00:55:38,877
What's it called, Hema...
- Haemoplasia.

991
00:55:38,948 --> 00:55:40,939
Yes, Hema. Yes, Hema.
- What?

992
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:42,074
Semi-paralysis.

993
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:43,242
The one from Parel.

994
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:45,419
From Parel? What's that?

995
00:55:45,621 --> 00:55:49,057
In this disease, one can see
everything, hear everything...

996
00:55:49,124 --> 00:55:50,955
...but can't speak or move.

997
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:53,358
In the movie 'Anjaam', Shahrukh
Khan had this disease.

998
00:55:53,429 --> 00:55:55,624
I've watched all of Shahrukh
Khan's films.

999
00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:57,557
But which one was 'Anjaam'?

1000
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,391
Wasn't it the one with Chandrachur
and Sanjay Dutt in it?

1001
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:02,437
How the hell did Chandrachur
come into the picture?

1002
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:03,562
All you movie buffs...

1003
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:05,903
Shahrukh never acted in 'movie buff! '

1004
00:56:05,975 --> 00:56:07,135
Have you gone mad?

1005
00:56:07,209 --> 00:56:08,540
Shut up, you idiots!

1006
00:56:09,979 --> 00:56:11,344
This is not a cinema hall!

1007
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:14,040
I can't figure out how
he got a head injury...

1008
00:56:14,116 --> 00:56:16,209
...despite me being so cautious
in carrying him.

1009
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:17,544
'You buffoon! '

1010
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,911
'You were bashing the goons with
me strung around your neck...

1011
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:22,048
...and you're surprised
at my head injuries? '

1012
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:27,384
Look! King's blood is boiling!

1013
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:31,159
The point is...

1014
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,994
...who'll shoulder the responsibility...

1015
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:36,465
...of such a huge business vampire?

1016
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,033
Who'll ascend the King's throne?

1017
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:43,002
Tell me...
- 'Who's King's elder brother?

1018
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:48,448
Happy?! As King?!
- 'No! Kill that idiot! '

1019
00:56:48,517 --> 00:56:49,575
'Kill Happy! '

1020
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:52,017
How can I become King?
- I can never become King.

1021
00:56:52,154 --> 00:56:53,348
Happy?
- Happy?

1022
00:56:53,422 --> 00:56:54,582
Of course, I'm happy!

1023
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,624
But King's pointing towards Happy.

1024
00:56:56,692 --> 00:56:58,182
Don't point at me!

1025
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,557
It's bad manners to point at someone.

1026
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:03,187
He's pointing at the right person.
Happy has saved King's life!

1027
00:57:03,265 --> 00:57:04,459
'No, he's not! '

1028
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:05,966
He's right. If it wasn't for Happy...

1029
00:57:06,035 --> 00:57:08,435
...King wouldn't have been alive today.

1030
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:10,301
'Shut up, you sad sack! '

1031
00:57:11,106 --> 00:57:13,131
I... can't become King.

1032
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,035
King's blood is boiling
even more! Look!

1033
00:57:16,412 --> 00:57:17,470
Guru!
- Of course, his blood will boil!

1034
00:57:17,546 --> 00:57:19,377
After all, our blood is same to same!

1035
00:57:19,448 --> 00:57:21,643
Nonsense person!
His elder brother should be King.

1036
00:57:22,051 --> 00:57:25,043
Guru. - Don't make his blood boil.

1037
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,313
Lucky, we've understood what you want.

1038
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:28,714
'Bravo, Guru! '

1039
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,050
You want Happy to take, right?

1040
00:57:31,126 --> 00:57:34,220
'Have you gone senile? '
- No, I can't become King.

1041
00:57:34,296 --> 00:57:36,730
Until Lucky recovers,
happy will be our king.

1042
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:38,364
Okay?
- Yes, that's okay.

1043
00:57:38,434 --> 00:57:40,061
How can I become King, Lucky?

1044
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:41,727
'You fool! '

1045
00:57:43,238 --> 00:57:46,537
Even America must've not progressed
as fast! - Hear me...

1046
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:49,509
Had you gone to fetch King
or become King yourself?

1047
00:57:49,578 --> 00:57:51,739
Listen to me!
- What do I listen to? - Listen to me.

1048
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:53,472
Lakhan is lying in the hospital.

1049
00:57:53,549 --> 00:57:55,278
If I take him home in this condition...

1050
00:57:55,584 --> 00:57:57,745
...his father will get a heart-attack.
- Get lost.

1051
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,082
I'm a follower of Guru Govind
Singh. He's my King.

1052
00:58:01,256 --> 00:58:05,693
Oh shut up!
- God helps those who do good deeds.

1053
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:08,696
Are you saying that all
Kings are bad people?

1054
00:58:09,098 --> 00:58:10,565
Until he recovers...

1055
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:12,497
...what's the harm in taking
a glimpse into his world?

1056
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:14,092
Fine, do what you want.

1057
00:58:14,236 --> 00:58:15,396
I'm not interested in
seeing his world.

1058
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:17,102
You're on your own now.

1059
00:58:17,172 --> 00:58:20,141
Guards! Catch!
- Go, catch!

1060
00:58:20,442 --> 00:58:22,171
He's inviting nothing but trouble!

1061
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:31,644
You better put your
fist up, right now!

1062
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:35,654
One for the treble,
two for the base.

1063
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:38,249
King is in the place, you
better watch this space.

1064
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:41,052
One for the treble,
two for the base.

1065
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,462
King is in the place, you
better watch this space.

1066
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:58,808
13 cards of the same colour,
they contain but one King.

1067
00:58:59,148 --> 00:59:01,514
We're the ace, as well as the base...

1068
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,484
We are also daring! Right now!

1069
00:59:09,324 --> 00:59:14,352
13 cards of the same colour,
they contain but one King.

1070
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,092
We're the ace, as well as the base...

1071
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:19,498
We're also daring!

1072
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,601
We do as we please.

1073
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:25,206
We're not scared to
cross boundaries.

1074
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:29,174
If your intentions are true,
God does the setting.

1075
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:33,715
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1076
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:39,179
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1077
00:59:39,688 --> 00:59:44,421
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1078
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:47,791
You know we bring the
rockers in the place.

1079
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:50,627
Don't be messing with me, punk,
because I hit you in the face.

1080
00:59:50,866 --> 00:59:53,198
You know, you better
salute to the King.

1081
00:59:53,435 --> 00:59:55,733
You know, you better
bow down to the Singh!

1082
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:58,465
Go for it, because
we are the greatest.

1083
00:59:58,607 --> 01:00:01,201
We're fearless, we are the bravest!

1084
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:03,477
Sing and dance, bad as hell!

1085
01:00:03,545 --> 01:00:06,309
Punjabis in the house, you
better watch yourself.

1086
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:08,143
Not once, not twice...

1087
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:11,448
...take over the world 10 times!

1088
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,152
And if you can still
win someone's heart...

1089
01:00:14,223 --> 01:00:16,555
...there's nothing like it!

1090
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:20,157
If after listening to the
machine gun rattle...

1091
01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:24,165
...you can still appreciate
a cuckoo's chirp...

1092
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:26,724
...there's nothing like it!

1093
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:30,761
Come on, sing a song that
touches the heart.

1094
01:00:31,907 --> 01:00:36,435
Sing and dance, from
morning to evening!

1095
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:40,812
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1096
01:00:41,617 --> 01:00:46,247
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1097
01:00:46,822 --> 01:00:51,725
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1098
01:00:52,928 --> 01:00:55,260
Yes, you better pump it up!

1099
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:57,594
Singh is in the house.
You better turn it up!

1100
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:00,260
When I say Singh, you say King!

1101
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:02,860
Singh is King. Singh is King.

1102
01:01:02,938 --> 01:01:05,463
When I say Singh, you say King!

1103
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:08,408
Singh is King. Singh is King.

1104
01:01:08,677 --> 01:01:10,736
We neither had pride nor plume.

1105
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,443
We were living like paupers.

1106
01:01:13,782 --> 01:01:18,583
When suddenly, our fortunes
changed overnight.

1107
01:01:18,954 --> 01:01:21,218
I neither owned anything yesterday...

1108
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,758
...nor do I own anything today.

1109
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:28,794
I only had my heart as mine. Now,
I've lost that as well.

1110
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:38,398
What's life without love? What's
life without high thinking?

1111
01:01:38,473 --> 01:01:42,842
Singh is King! Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1112
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:48,378
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1113
01:01:51,787 --> 01:01:57,316
13 cards of the same colour.
They contain but one King.

1114
01:01:57,392 --> 01:01:59,724
We're the ace, as well as the base...

1115
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:02,389
We do as we please.

1116
01:02:02,464 --> 01:02:07,959
We're not scared to
cross boundaries.

1117
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:12,001
If your intentions are true,
God does the setting.

1118
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:16,472
Singh is King! Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1119
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:21,646
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1120
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:26,788
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1121
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:32,617
Singh is King. Singh is
King. Singh is King.

1122
01:02:34,563 --> 01:02:36,428
Yes!
- What happened?

1123
01:02:36,565 --> 01:02:39,534
Did you find anything? Her
house is locked even today.

1124
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:43,470
They say she's not opened
her shop in 2-3 days now.

1125
01:02:43,905 --> 01:02:46,601
And her neighbour said
that she's sick.

1126
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:50,403
She cries all day and
roams like a vagabond.

1127
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:55,607
I don't know what's wrong.
We'll have to find her.

1128
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:11,657
What happened?

1129
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:14,834
Happy, what's wrong with you?

1130
01:03:15,604 --> 01:03:16,935
Why have you become Aladdin?

1131
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,337
Not Aladdin, I've become King!

1132
01:03:19,574 --> 01:03:22,338
King?! You're not even a Singh!

1133
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:26,344
Singh's don't chop their hair, they'd
rather chop their heads off. And you.

1134
01:03:26,748 --> 01:03:28,716
I admit I've made a grave mistake.

1135
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,911
I'll adopt a Sikh's appearance,
soon as I return to my village.

1136
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:33,946
I'm doing all this because...

1137
01:03:35,957 --> 01:03:37,447
I'll tell you my story later.

1138
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:39,391
First tell me, what's wrong with you?

1139
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:41,019
Why are you so sad?

1140
01:03:41,096 --> 01:03:42,358
Nothing's wrong.

1141
01:03:42,431 --> 01:03:43,489
Sit down.

1142
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,693
If anybody cries, I
too feel like crying.

1143
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:53,366
You'd fed a complete stranger
in a foreign land.

1144
01:03:53,775 --> 01:03:54,935
I can never forget that.

1145
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:57,072
I can lay down my life for you.

1146
01:03:58,046 --> 01:04:01,641
I can do anything for you!
Please tell me, tell me.

1147
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:04,049
I won't rest until,, you tell me.

1148
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:05,814
Oh! Shut up!

1149
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:09,380
Hey! She's my mother, don't shoot
her! Put your guns back in.

1150
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:15,490
My daughter's coming back
tomorrow after three years.

1151
01:04:15,797 --> 01:04:16,855
So?

1152
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:18,763
So That's good news, isn't it?

1153
01:04:18,934 --> 01:04:22,392
No way! She thinks that
we're still rich.

1154
01:04:23,672 --> 01:04:24,730
Rich?!

1155
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,065
We were once amongst the
richest families here...

1156
01:04:29,978 --> 01:04:32,469
...when suddenly, my
husband passed away.

1157
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:37,483
Fool! Left me in knee deep debt.

1158
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:40,985
I lost everything Happy.

1159
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:45,484
But I always hid this
fact from my daughter.

1160
01:04:46,128 --> 01:04:49,529
If she came to know, she'd leave
her studies and come here.

1161
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:54,091
But do you know something? I never
deprived her of anything.

1162
01:04:54,169 --> 01:04:58,765
Fulfilled all her needs in
the past three years. Yes.

1163
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:01,498
Just that I didn't let her come home.

1164
01:05:03,512 --> 01:05:07,710
But now she's coming tomorrow
with the man she loves.

1165
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:11,578
I've heard he's from
a very rich family.

1166
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:14,945
How will I ever face them?

1167
01:05:15,757 --> 01:05:17,452
I'll be exposed when she discovers...

1168
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:20,620
...that her mom sells flowers
by the roadside?

1169
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:25,900
How will I accommodate them
in such a small house?

1170
01:05:27,602 --> 01:05:29,536
I'm really tense!

1171
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:32,867
He'll never accept her!

1172
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:38,538
Her life will be ruined, Happy!

1173
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:45,544
That florist will become
this mansion's owner...

1174
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:47,748
Yes, bring it.
- Are we her servants?!

1175
01:05:48,557 --> 01:05:52,550
Careful! Come upstairs...
- I'd become a servant once.

1176
01:05:53,562 --> 01:05:56,156
Served the guests with phenyl
in place of buttermilk.

1177
01:05:56,565 --> 01:05:58,795
All the 25 guests died of diarrhea.

1178
01:06:00,202 --> 01:06:03,694
My master was hanged,
while I lost my job.

1179
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:07,073
That day...
- Enough! Stop it! Please...

1180
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:08,567
You seem to have verbal diarrhea!

1181
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:14,238
Come on. Brothers, the old King
crowned me the new King.

1182
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:18,149
Now, it's my job to appoint
a King amongst you all.

1183
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:25,925
What do you say? What do
we have to do? - What?

1184
01:06:26,261 --> 01:06:28,627
Should I tell him about the scheme,
or you too want to hear?

1185
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,597
No, tell us!

1186
01:06:30,665 --> 01:06:33,532
Yes, let's hear. What's the
harm in hearing it once?

1187
01:06:33,602 --> 01:06:35,593
Yes... Come closer. It's very simple.

1188
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,729
You all have to do as
you've been doing.

1189
01:06:37,939 --> 01:06:40,533
Just like Guru clears the crime
scene of the evidences...

1190
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:43,077
...he'll have to clear the garden.
- What?!

1191
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:44,603
Will Guru become a gardener?

1192
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:45,737
And you'll become a driver!

1193
01:06:47,616 --> 01:06:49,607
Am I supposed to chop
vegetables with this?

1194
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:51,982
That's a good idea! He's very smart.

1195
01:06:52,053 --> 01:06:53,111
Let him be the cook.

1196
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:58,557
And you better stay far from the
house! - Why? - We can't trust you.

1197
01:06:58,627 --> 01:07:00,561
You may kill us by mixing
phenyl with buttermilk!

1198
01:07:00,629 --> 01:07:03,689
Place him outside as a security
guard. - Perfect!

1199
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:05,027
Hey!
- Don't fuss!

1200
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:06,659
What role am I playing?

1201
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:08,100
What do we do about
this wannabe actress?

1202
01:07:09,304 --> 01:07:11,568
Since I used to be King's
personal secretary...

1203
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,699
...should I become ma'am Rose's now?

1204
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:15,774
Yes, that'll be fine.

1205
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:18,136
What do we do about Mika?

1206
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,639
He's blind and deaf, cleaning
the gun's barrel.

1207
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,643
I bet he's listening to our
conversation from there.

1208
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:27,244
I've never seen him work.

1209
01:07:27,322 --> 01:07:29,153
What role do we assign him?
Whoever said he doesn't work.

1210
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:33,686
Look. He stares at me all the time!

1211
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:37,664
He's risked his life several
times to save our King.

1212
01:07:37,732 --> 01:07:39,324
Great! Make him the bodyguard.

1213
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:41,793
Just tell me. What role will you play?

1214
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:44,868
Since I'm managing everyone, let
me be the manager. - Here.

1215
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,339
Fine, then I'll be your assistant.

1216
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,957
Good clothes go a long way
in making man presentable.

1217
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,284
Also, a woman!

1218
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:26,238
Servants, you're about to
do a great deed today.

1219
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:30,182
You're supposed to serve. Okay?

1220
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,382
Hide all your weapons.

1221
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:35,122
They shouldn't be seen. Get it.

1222
01:08:38,393 --> 01:08:39,917
There, the plane has arrived!

1223
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:42,727
Shut up, you fool! Everybody
can see that!

1224
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:48,264
My daughter's here.

1225
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:17,831
Mom!
- Sonia!

1226
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:21,766
I missed you so much!

1227
01:09:21,836 --> 01:09:23,428
Let me look at you.

1228
01:09:25,206 --> 01:09:27,697
Mom, this is Puneet.
- Hello aunt!

1229
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:29,004
Hello!
- This is for you.

1230
01:09:29,077 --> 01:09:30,772
Thank you.
- My pleasure. - Thank you.

1231
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:34,239
Happy!

1232
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,011
Oh my God! Happy!

1233
01:09:38,186 --> 01:09:39,710
What are you doing here?

1234
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:42,086
Just like that.
- What a surprise!

1235
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:45,817
You look different and nice!

1236
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:47,786
Puneet!

1237
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:52,992
This is Happy. I'd told you remember?

1238
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:55,726
Yes, of course! Hello Happy!
- Greeting.

1239
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:56,998
This is Puneet, my boy friend!

1240
01:09:57,405 --> 01:09:58,463
Hi!
- Hi.

1241
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,884
I'm really scared, Julie!

1242
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,357
There's no such scene.

1243
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,223
Had I gotten your, Sonia's
and my roles...

1244
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:10,230
...I would've done them
in a single take.

1245
01:10:10,298 --> 01:10:11,629
Watch out!
- You're a good actress.

1246
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:14,292
But the criminals of which
this house is full of...

1247
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:15,700
...are hardly actors!

1248
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,304
I'm scared, we'll be unmasked.

1249
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,564
Cheers!

1250
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,971
Look in front! Start acting!

1251
01:10:22,243 --> 01:10:24,973
Hey, behave yourself!
- Sorry!

1252
01:10:25,613 --> 01:10:27,240
You're supposed to look respectable,
not like a goon.

1253
01:10:27,315 --> 01:10:29,476
Close your buttons.
- Sorry!

1254
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:32,249
Julie, please don't leave me and go.
- Let's go ma'am!

1255
01:10:33,254 --> 01:10:35,313
She's a knock-out!

1256
01:10:35,456 --> 01:10:37,549
You're the epitome of sacrifice.

1257
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:41,387
Don't try to hide your feelings by
plastering a smile on your face.

1258
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:43,759
Go and propose to Sonia...

1259
01:10:43,831 --> 01:10:47,323
Sonia is not the sorts to
cheat on her partner.

1260
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:48,927
If I propose to her...

1261
01:10:49,003 --> 01:10:50,265
...I'll ruin my chances
of friendship as well!

1262
01:10:51,272 --> 01:10:54,332
And then, I have to fulfill
the promise I made to ma'am.

1263
01:10:54,475 --> 01:10:55,635
I'll shoot you!

1264
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,768
You'll shoot me?! You fool!

1265
01:10:56,844 --> 01:10:57,936
What's going on at my party?

1266
01:10:58,012 --> 01:10:59,343
Please concentrate on your character.

1267
01:10:59,414 --> 01:11:01,006
What's happening at my party?

1268
01:11:01,282 --> 01:11:02,613
Oh no! They're fighting again!

1269
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,878
I see such weapons everyday,
you idiot!

1270
01:11:05,953 --> 01:11:07,011
Have you gone mad?

1271
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:08,448
There's a party going on over here.

1272
01:11:08,589 --> 01:11:09,749
I'll give you one tight slap!

1273
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:11,622
Am I your dad's servant?

1274
01:11:11,692 --> 01:11:12,750
Then am I your dad's servant?

1275
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:13,952
You're all servants over here!

1276
01:11:14,028 --> 01:11:16,496
Who all are carrying guns in
an elite party such as this?

1277
01:11:17,632 --> 01:11:21,898
Who else but these fools carry
guns in a party like this!

1278
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:23,027
That's true.

1279
01:11:24,038 --> 01:11:25,699
Don't shoot!

1280
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,007
Brother Mika!
- Yes?

1281
01:11:32,313 --> 01:11:33,371
Wrong number.

1282
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:40,786
You idiots! Have you come to a
party or to deal in weapons?

1283
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:42,353
Lay down your guns.

1284
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:45,551
Not there in your safe deposit.
Over here! Not there!

1285
01:11:47,528 --> 01:11:49,928
Mika, what's that in your sleeve?

1286
01:11:51,999 --> 01:11:54,559
The other sleeve as well.
- You give your gun.

1287
01:11:54,635 --> 01:11:58,002
From the waistband as well.
Remove everything!

1288
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,398
Give here.

1289
01:12:09,684 --> 01:12:11,413
He has a good collection of guns!

1290
01:12:12,086 --> 01:12:13,553
Better safe than sorry.

1291
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:17,688
Go to hell! They've ruined
my party Happy!

1292
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:21,957
Happy!
- What happened?

1293
01:12:22,096 --> 01:12:24,963
Happy! Sonia! Puneet! Puneet! Sonia!

1294
01:12:25,032 --> 01:12:26,897
Hey! Cover the artillery!

1295
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,026
Hurry up!

1296
01:12:28,102 --> 01:12:29,831
Fast! Fast!

1297
01:12:31,372 --> 01:12:34,705
That's it. You've decked up the table.

1298
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:36,441
That's it. Please, come.

1299
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:38,001
You're welcome in a 'no entry' zone.
- Hi, how are you?

1300
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:39,979
Aunt, you've thrown such a big party
to welcome us. - Thank you!

1301
01:12:40,047 --> 01:12:41,105
Thank you so much.

1302
01:12:41,382 --> 01:12:42,440
The pleasure is mine, dear.

1303
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:43,848
Really! So many people...

1304
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:45,545
I mean, I was really surprised.

1305
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,110
There's something here...
- Flowers!

1306
01:12:47,388 --> 01:12:48,719
You forgot to mention thorns!

1307
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:53,656
Wow! The diamond studded in your
turban looks magnificent!

1308
01:12:54,395 --> 01:12:56,590
You look more like a
king than a manager!

1309
01:12:57,131 --> 01:12:58,393
Mr. Happy, Sonia was telling
how much you spoilt her...

1310
01:12:58,466 --> 01:13:00,934
...in just one day!

1311
01:13:01,402 --> 01:13:02,994
It's because you weren't there.

1312
01:13:03,137 --> 01:13:04,399
Well, actually I would've been there.

1313
01:13:04,472 --> 01:13:06,531
But my boarding pass got
exchanged with an idiot...

1314
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:08,598
...at the Delhi airport.

1315
01:13:11,546 --> 01:13:13,878
'Can't you see and walk? '
- 'Stupid villagers! '

1316
01:13:14,415 --> 01:13:15,473
Hey.

1317
01:13:15,616 --> 01:13:16,810
People are such fools, I tell you!

1318
01:13:17,151 --> 01:13:19,085
There's something...
- Flowers!

1319
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:22,082
It's an arrangement of
wild flowers, dear.

1320
01:13:22,823 --> 01:13:25,485
Ma'am, may I take Sir Puneet to meet
the other guests? - Sure!

1321
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,851
Hey! So do you.

1322
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:33,833
Use your guns as much as
you want after 2-4 days.

1323
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:37,035
Just wait till my daughter
gets married.

1324
01:13:39,473 --> 01:13:42,169
Please try and be calm until then.

1325
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:44,509
You lech at her so much so...

1326
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:47,446
...that even the mirror
has developed cracks!

1327
01:13:48,182 --> 01:13:49,444
Hi!
- That's Rachel. - Hi!

1328
01:13:49,584 --> 01:13:52,109
Nice to meet you.
- So, you're having fun? - Yes.

1329
01:13:52,186 --> 01:13:53,676
Great party, isn't it?
- Enjoy yourselves!

1330
01:13:56,457 --> 01:13:57,617
Enough now.

1331
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:05,860
Ladies and gentlemen!
Everybody... Guys.

1332
01:14:05,933 --> 01:14:07,127
Sonia, can you come and join me?

1333
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:10,465
What is it, Puneet?

1334
01:14:11,138 --> 01:14:15,802
Guys, I'd come here essentially
to meet Sonia's mother.

1335
01:14:15,943 --> 01:14:17,467
But now I'm thinking of leaving...

1336
01:14:17,545 --> 01:14:20,946
...only after getting married to Sonia.

1337
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:23,540
Sonia, will you marry me?

1338
01:14:24,652 --> 01:14:26,620
I don't believe that you'II...

1339
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,745
Will you marry me?

1340
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,488
When?
- Yes!

1341
01:14:43,504 --> 01:14:45,904
I can't see my friend so upset.

1342
01:14:46,707 --> 01:14:49,505
Get me a whisky!
- Get you Lucky?!

1343
01:14:50,244 --> 01:14:51,711
Now, is he planning to
put him on display?

1344
01:14:51,846 --> 01:14:53,006
What are you muttering?

1345
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,112
I'll get you one.
- What?!

1346
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:57,743
Idiot!

1347
01:14:57,818 --> 01:14:58,876
Lucky!

1348
01:14:59,854 --> 01:15:02,721
So, you're sitting here comfortably!

1349
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:07,523
That idiot has become King...

1350
01:15:07,595 --> 01:15:10,120
...and is treating us like servants!

1351
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,666
Sorry! Where are you?

1352
01:15:16,003 --> 01:15:17,061
C'mon!

1353
01:15:25,913 --> 01:15:27,608
Who put this table in the centre?

1354
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:29,546
Not me, .
- This... - Who is this, mom?

1355
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:31,278
He's our real King!
- The real king?!

1356
01:15:31,552 --> 01:15:33,679
Yes, he's the king amongst kings!

1357
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,618
Everything belongs to him, dear.

1358
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:37,749
What?!
- She means...

1359
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:40,089
...that it's all because
of his blessings.

1360
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,287
He's a saint.

1361
01:15:41,762 --> 01:15:43,821
He's Saint Divine Finger!
- Everybody seek his blessings.

1362
01:15:43,898 --> 01:15:46,731
Hail Saint Divine Finger!

1363
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:48,098
Bless me, priest.

1364
01:15:48,302 --> 01:15:50,566
But who's he pointing at?

1365
01:15:51,305 --> 01:15:53,773
His finger... Watch carefully.

1366
01:15:53,908 --> 01:15:55,569
Watch carefully. He's
pointing upwards.

1367
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,304
It indicates that God is above all.

1368
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:00,638
He's observing a vow of
silence since many years.

1369
01:16:00,715 --> 01:16:03,115
Ma'am doesn't do a thing
without his permission.

1370
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:04,579
Aunty, then why don't we
ask the divine saint...

1371
01:16:04,652 --> 01:16:07,177
...to fix the wedding date?

1372
01:16:07,588 --> 01:16:08,748
Will he tell us?

1373
01:16:09,123 --> 01:16:10,181
Yes!

1374
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:13,017
And he's already told us!

1375
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:15,060
Look, it is third.

1376
01:16:15,129 --> 01:16:17,256
The third of next month!
It's confirmed!

1377
01:16:17,331 --> 01:16:19,231
Oh God! Only 13 days left!

1378
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,631
There are so many
preparations to be done.

1379
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,828
Manager! - We'll manage.

1380
01:16:22,903 --> 01:16:24,268
We need to talk to you.

1381
01:16:24,338 --> 01:16:26,602
I'll be back!
- Come on, move! - Ask him.

1382
01:16:26,674 --> 01:16:27,936
What nonsense is this! - Yes.

1383
01:16:28,609 --> 01:16:29,667
We'd spoken about 3 days!

1384
01:16:29,744 --> 01:16:31,268
You don't expect us to be
servants for 13 days!

1385
01:16:31,345 --> 01:16:33,210
Are you mad?
- Shut up! Ramlal!

1386
01:16:34,081 --> 01:16:35,241
Stage actors!

1387
01:16:35,349 --> 01:16:36,611
How was I supposed to
know that the villain...

1388
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:37,742
...had come to marry the heroine?

1389
01:16:37,818 --> 01:16:39,683
Why don't you ask him about
the future as well?

1390
01:16:39,754 --> 01:16:41,915
All you know, he'll tell us the
dates of their baby's delivery!

1391
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:44,856
And we'll be reduced to baby-sitters!
- You idiot.

1392
01:16:46,627 --> 01:16:48,822
Sonia, do you know I jog
every morning at 7?

1393
01:16:48,963 --> 01:16:51,761
Swim at 8, do yoga by 9
and have breakfast at 10.

1394
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:54,699
Keep it here.
- These idiots are late by 2 hours!

1395
01:16:55,636 --> 01:16:57,695
Madam.
- Look, the breakfast's ready.

1396
01:16:57,838 --> 01:16:59,237
What are you looking at?
Lay the table!

1397
01:16:59,306 --> 01:17:01,103
Sir Puneet is very jovial
in the mornings.

1398
01:17:01,175 --> 01:17:02,642
Good morning!
- Thank you! - Good morning!

1399
01:17:13,654 --> 01:17:15,178
He looks so much like my dad!

1400
01:17:15,656 --> 01:17:18,784
Say that you love me...
- Amazing!

1401
01:17:20,127 --> 01:17:22,095
Say that you love me...
- Of course!

1402
01:17:22,163 --> 01:17:23,994
What's this? Bread stuffed
with potatoes?

1403
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:28,262
Also, bread stuffed with
radish and egg-plant?!

1404
01:17:28,335 --> 01:17:30,064
Son, there's plain bread as well.

1405
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,663
Hey you! Just because your
face looks stuffed...

1406
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:35,675
...doesn't mean you'll prepare
only stuffed bread?

1407
01:17:37,077 --> 01:17:39,136
Happy! Knife!
- Knife?!

1408
01:17:39,346 --> 01:17:40,404
Relax, its okay.

1409
01:17:40,481 --> 01:17:43,678
Knife! - Happy! - Here it is.

1410
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:45,184
Happy, knife...
- Knife. - Here, take his knife.

1411
01:17:45,252 --> 01:17:47,743
Dear, I need to spread
the butter on the bread.

1412
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:50,147
Such a big knife to spread butter?

1413
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:53,682
Big people live life king-size!

1414
01:17:53,894 --> 01:17:55,794
Here's your cold-drink.
- Give it to me.

1415
01:17:55,863 --> 01:18:00,766
Hey Devdas!
- Udaas! My name is Pankaj Udaas.

1416
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:02,198
I don't care what your name is.

1417
01:18:02,436 --> 01:18:04,427
What are you doing here
leaving a guard's duty?

1418
01:18:04,705 --> 01:18:05,831
Have you asked Chunnilal
to take over?

1419
01:18:09,109 --> 01:18:10,269
Please sit. Sit down!

1420
01:18:10,444 --> 01:18:11,877
It was only a glass.

1421
01:18:11,946 --> 01:18:13,243
Of course! Practice!

1422
01:18:13,714 --> 01:18:17,844
Aunty, sack this senior citizen
right away! - Madam!

1423
01:18:17,918 --> 01:18:18,976
Had he been working in
a government's office...

1424
01:18:19,053 --> 01:18:20,714
...he would've retired thrice by now.

1425
01:18:21,121 --> 01:18:22,179
He's doomed!

1426
01:18:22,256 --> 01:18:23,382
Aren't you the gardener?

1427
01:18:23,724 --> 01:18:27,057
We got late today. So, we're
helping each other out.

1428
01:18:27,194 --> 01:18:29,856
Manage with stuffed bread. It's
Punjab's national breakfast.

1429
01:18:30,464 --> 01:18:32,796
From tomorrow, we'll serve
you an English breakfast.

1430
01:18:32,867 --> 01:18:35,199
Milk with wafers!
- Corn flakes! - Yes, that's what.

1431
01:18:35,269 --> 01:18:36,327
You can make scrambled
eggs as well, right?

1432
01:18:36,403 --> 01:18:37,734
You don't bother about it.

1433
01:18:41,742 --> 01:18:48,011
Wow! It's beautiful!
- Wow! I'm impressed!

1434
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:49,813
This is absolutely amazing!

1435
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:53,415
I can't believe mom owns
this five star hotel!

1436
01:18:53,754 --> 01:18:56,279
God knows what all she's
keeping from me!

1437
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:58,753
There's a casino as well!

1438
01:18:59,393 --> 01:19:00,985
Sonia, let's go!
- I don't know how to gamble.

1439
01:19:01,061 --> 01:19:02,153
Neither do I! Come!

1440
01:19:09,904 --> 01:19:11,303
Mika, can't you see?

1441
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,304
I'd won a gold medal last
week in rifle shooting.

1442
01:19:15,843 --> 01:19:17,367
The target was 500 kilometers away.

1443
01:19:18,512 --> 01:19:20,241
I don't carry the medal around
or I would've showed you.

1444
01:19:20,514 --> 01:19:22,106
The Olympics wasn't last week.

1445
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:24,842
Go to the casino and tell the owner...

1446
01:19:24,919 --> 01:19:26,978
...that our two guests who've
gone inside should win...

1447
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:30,785
...in all the games, understood?

1448
01:19:30,925 --> 01:19:33,325
The casino is this way.

1449
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:35,987
Yes!

1450
01:19:37,865 --> 01:19:40,459
Puneet, you'd told me that
you don't know how to play.

1451
01:19:40,801 --> 01:19:42,268
Actually, I'm an expert.

1452
01:19:42,536 --> 01:19:44,970
But I don't like to praise myself.

1453
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:48,332
All the casino owners of Las
Vegas were begging me...

1454
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,877
...not to come and play
in their casinos.

1455
01:19:51,211 --> 01:19:53,111
Puneet, you're simply great!

1456
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,909
Sonia, let's go party!

1457
01:19:55,149 --> 01:19:56,946
Doesn't your mom own a disco?

1458
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:58,813
She does! How do you know?

1459
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,144
Really?

1460
01:20:09,063 --> 01:20:10,928
He's drunk, he's drunk...

1461
01:20:10,998 --> 01:20:13,023
Look, my friend's drunk!

1462
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,091
He's falling here,
he's falling there.

1463
01:20:15,169 --> 01:20:17,228
Look, he's falling everywhere!

1464
01:20:17,304 --> 01:20:19,295
He's drunk, he's drunk...

1465
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:21,341
Look, my friend's drunk!

1466
01:20:21,408 --> 01:20:23,467
He's falling here,
he's falling there.

1467
01:20:23,544 --> 01:20:25,569
Look, he's falling everywhere!

1468
01:20:25,846 --> 01:20:29,907
Pal, open the bottle
and give me a sip.

1469
01:20:29,984 --> 01:20:34,148
Pal, mix some soda and
make me a 'Patiala peg.

1470
01:20:34,855 --> 01:20:38,256
We're full of life and zest.

1471
01:20:38,325 --> 01:20:42,523
So get me all the rum you can,
for the sake of friendship.

1472
01:20:48,936 --> 01:20:50,870
C'mon, let's all drink
to friendship!

1473
01:20:50,938 --> 01:20:52,872
He's drunk, he's drunk...

1474
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,601
Look, my friend's drunk!

1475
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:57,002
He's falling here,
he's falling there.

1476
01:20:57,077 --> 01:20:59,068
Look, he's falling everywhere!

1477
01:21:07,554 --> 01:21:08,885
Hell will break loose...

1478
01:21:08,956 --> 01:21:11,356
...if my friend gets drunk.

1479
01:21:11,558 --> 01:21:12,889
Hell will break loose...

1480
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,622
...if my friend gets drunk.

1481
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:22,162
Life is so short.

1482
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:24,202
So why drink sparingly?

1483
01:21:24,271 --> 01:21:26,239
Drink to your heart's content.

1484
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,305
Sorry, sorry, very sorry!

1485
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:30,570
I'm intoxicated with alcohol.

1486
01:21:30,644 --> 01:21:32,578
On top of that, there
are beauties galore.

1487
01:21:32,646 --> 01:21:34,580
We walk with a confident gait.

1488
01:21:34,915 --> 01:21:36,974
Sorry, sorry, very sorry!

1489
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:41,078
Sorry, I'm intoxicated and
I'm having a lot of fun.

1490
01:21:41,155 --> 01:21:44,989
Please forgive me and give me a hug.

1491
01:21:51,598 --> 01:21:53,532
C'mon, let's all drink
to friendship!

1492
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,500
He's drunk, he's drunk...

1493
01:21:55,569 --> 01:21:57,469
Look, my friend's drunk!

1494
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,597
He's falling here,
he's falling there.

1495
01:21:59,673 --> 01:22:01,664
Look, he's falling everywhere!

1496
01:22:01,942 --> 01:22:06,003
Pal, open the bottle
and give me a sip.

1497
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:10,138
Pal, mix some soda and
make me a 'Patiala peg.

1498
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:14,318
We're full of life and zest.

1499
01:22:15,155 --> 01:22:18,682
So get me all the rum you can,
for the sake of friendship.

1500
01:22:25,032 --> 01:22:26,966
C'mon, let's all drink
to friendship!

1501
01:22:27,034 --> 01:22:28,968
Look my friend's drunk!

1502
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:30,970
Look my friend's drunk!

1503
01:22:31,038 --> 01:22:33,097
He's falling here,
he's falling there.

1504
01:22:33,173 --> 01:22:35,164
He's falling here,
he's falling there.

1505
01:22:36,343 --> 01:22:37,970
Ever since, your photo's been
printed in the newspaper...

1506
01:22:38,045 --> 01:22:40,172
...he's been staring at it.

1507
01:22:40,314 --> 01:22:42,111
That's how his health has improved.

1508
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:44,041
Even the doctor has said...

1509
01:22:44,118 --> 01:22:46,177
...that his health will
improve drastically...

1510
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,050
...if you're around him.

1511
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:49,519
King, come forward.

1512
01:22:49,656 --> 01:22:51,283
I too am not getting
a break as a heroine.

1513
01:22:51,358 --> 01:22:53,121
Come on, hurry up. Fill it up.

1514
01:22:54,995 --> 01:22:57,327
You love me so much, friend?

1515
01:22:57,731 --> 01:22:59,995
Now, I'll constantly be around you.

1516
01:23:00,534 --> 01:23:03,401
Just wait till you get
off this wheel chair.

1517
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,198
'The day I get off the chair,
I'll make sure you occupy it.'

1518
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:07,735
Today's a big day.

1519
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,073
I'm going to distribute money
amongst the poor Australians.

1520
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:13,074
I'm proud of you, Rangeela!

1521
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:16,011
From now on, distribute
money amongst the poor...

1522
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,244
...each time there's an improvement
in Lucky's health.

1523
01:23:18,485 --> 01:23:20,510
Absolutely! I can't be miserly today.

1524
01:23:21,021 --> 01:23:23,353
'Fools! Throwing away
my hard-earned money! '

1525
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:26,017
Lucky, what's wrong? Tell me!

1526
01:23:26,093 --> 01:23:28,755
Doctor has said that Lucky's
tense about his work.

1527
01:23:29,663 --> 01:23:31,756
What tension? You tell me,
I'll solve it for you.

1528
01:23:32,032 --> 01:23:34,296
There's a hot dog seller's truck
parked at Coolangatta.

1529
01:23:34,768 --> 01:23:36,099
He wanted to get rid of it.

1530
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,428
Such a measly job!

1531
01:23:37,504 --> 01:23:39,028
Ever heard of a King towing trucks?

1532
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:42,640
Brother, there are two big
restaurants in front of the truck.

1533
01:23:43,043 --> 01:23:45,705
Their business is suffering a lot.

1534
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:48,043
The restaurant owners are
King's good friends.

1535
01:23:48,382 --> 01:23:50,043
King had promised them.

1536
01:23:51,051 --> 01:23:53,110
Then fulfill his promise!

1537
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,617
Go and get rid of the truck!

1538
01:23:54,688 --> 01:23:57,122
'For once, he spoke like a King! '

1539
01:23:57,191 --> 01:23:58,249
Do one thing.

1540
01:23:59,059 --> 01:24:00,253
Don't leave the truck anywhere.

1541
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:05,458
Leave it at his place and give
him some money as well.

1542
01:24:06,366 --> 01:24:08,334
'Fool finally showed
his true colours! '

1543
01:24:09,069 --> 01:24:10,127
What happened?

1544
01:24:10,204 --> 01:24:12,069
King needs your blessings.

1545
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,156
Why are you doing this to me?

1546
01:24:31,091 --> 01:24:35,152
Where are you taking me? Stop
it! Please let me go.

1547
01:24:37,164 --> 01:24:40,156
Tell your son not to go there
ever again to do business.

1548
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,359
If he puts his van there,
we'll kill him.

1549
01:24:42,436 --> 01:24:44,427
Is there a circus happening here? Go!

1550
01:24:45,839 --> 01:24:47,704
We are a family of 7 people.

1551
01:24:48,842 --> 01:24:50,104
One more is to come.

1552
01:24:51,111 --> 01:24:52,169
What's wrong?

1553
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:53,537
Isn't he agreeing?

1554
01:24:54,248 --> 01:24:55,772
Aren't we? The fool...

1555
01:24:56,316 --> 01:25:01,253
Udaas, this truck is their
source of livelihood.

1556
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,115
He's asking us what price we can pay...

1557
01:25:05,192 --> 01:25:08,457
...for seven people going hungry
for the rest of their lives.

1558
01:25:09,529 --> 01:25:12,123
If you can calculate the exact
amount, we'll accept it...

1559
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:14,793
...without even counting it.

1560
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:18,136
If we can estimate the cost...

1561
01:25:18,205 --> 01:25:20,867
...he'll accept it without counting.

1562
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:52,632
Any fool says anything
then come to us. Okay?

1563
01:25:57,911 --> 01:26:01,176
If any problem, call me.

1564
01:26:08,221 --> 01:26:09,711
You are like God to me.

1565
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:10,916
God to me!

1566
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:19,796
Gardener, what flower is this?

1567
01:26:21,668 --> 01:26:22,794
Don't you know this much?

1568
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:25,199
Whoever made you a gardener!

1569
01:26:26,373 --> 01:26:28,568
Now a servant will glare at me?!

1570
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:31,404
Listen to me, you...
- Dear!

1571
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,939
Forgive him. He's your father's age.

1572
01:26:34,848 --> 01:26:37,681
No, he's my grandfather's age.

1573
01:26:38,218 --> 01:26:40,277
The candles on his birthday cake...

1574
01:26:40,354 --> 01:26:41,412
...must cost more than the cake.

1575
01:26:41,888 --> 01:26:43,219
Lousy senior citizens!

1576
01:26:47,694 --> 01:26:51,687
Hey Devdas! Who are you
day dreaming about?

1577
01:26:52,299 --> 01:26:53,891
Watchman, I'm talking to you!

1578
01:26:55,902 --> 01:26:58,769
I've been watching you day
dream about women all day!

1579
01:26:58,972 --> 01:27:00,234
Why don't you do your duty?

1580
01:27:00,707 --> 01:27:01,969
Go, do your job.

1581
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:04,906
Go! Please?

1582
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:07,241
Please!

1583
01:27:07,914 --> 01:27:09,711
One has to pamper old servants.

1584
01:27:09,983 --> 01:27:12,247
Why is your mood spoilt?

1585
01:27:12,986 --> 01:27:15,250
Leave the poor servants alone.

1586
01:27:15,422 --> 01:27:16,480
The gardener knows nothing
about flowers...

1587
01:27:16,556 --> 01:27:19,252
...the watchman's day dreaming
about girls...

1588
01:27:19,326 --> 01:27:20,384
...the front page of the newspaper
is always missing...

1589
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,985
...including the news channel on T.V.

1590
01:27:23,263 --> 01:27:24,594
What's going on this house?

1591
01:27:24,731 --> 01:27:25,789
I can't take it!

1592
01:27:26,266 --> 01:27:30,862
Listen idiots! Finish
all of Lucky's chores.

1593
01:27:31,004 --> 01:27:32,562
He's not improved a
tad since yesterday.

1594
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:36,333
'Lf I move a finger, you all will
give me a loss worth millions! '

1595
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:39,004
King had an unfinished job.
- What's that?

1596
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:41,338
'May you rot in hell, Julie! '

1597
01:27:41,415 --> 01:27:44,509
An officer from Indian navy
has seized King's booty.

1598
01:27:44,584 --> 01:27:48,611
He's a nobody!
An honest Indian chap.

1599
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:50,280
He had threatened King...

1600
01:27:50,357 --> 01:27:52,552
...so we had made plans to kidnap
his blind daughter.

1601
01:27:52,626 --> 01:27:54,560
Kidnap her? Why aren't you
kidnapping her?

1602
01:27:54,628 --> 01:27:55,686
Go! Go!

1603
01:27:56,296 --> 01:27:57,524
'He'll surely change his mind now.'

1604
01:27:57,597 --> 01:27:58,757
One minute.

1605
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,963
Did you just say that she's blind?
- Yes. Blind child.

1606
01:28:04,037 --> 01:28:05,299
In that case, kidnap her,
take her to the hospital...

1607
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:07,636
...and get her treated.

1608
01:28:07,707 --> 01:28:08,901
There he goes again!

1609
01:28:08,975 --> 01:28:10,909
What do you mean?

1610
01:28:11,545 --> 01:28:12,978
Who's our enemy? - Her father.

1611
01:28:13,046 --> 01:28:15,537
Exactly. Not the girl.

1612
01:28:15,782 --> 01:28:17,306
We'll get blessings.

1613
01:28:17,551 --> 01:28:21,317
Look! His finger is moving!
- Improvement!

1614
01:28:21,388 --> 01:28:22,446
He moved his finger.

1615
01:28:22,522 --> 01:28:24,387
Slowly, he will start
moving everything.

1616
01:28:25,325 --> 01:28:27,384
What a mess I am in.

1617
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,952
It's a critical case of
cortical blindness.

1618
01:28:30,297 --> 01:28:32,697
But I'm sure,
I can make her eyes fine.

1619
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:35,691
Fantastic!
- Excuse me?

1620
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:38,228
He's a good doctor.

1621
01:28:38,705 --> 01:28:39,899
Foreign education
makes a difference.

1622
01:28:39,973 --> 01:28:42,840
You deposit the fee and I'll
take care of the rest.

1623
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:44,972
Excuse me, doctor!

1624
01:28:45,178 --> 01:28:46,236
Listen!

1625
01:28:52,919 --> 01:28:56,719
I know you,
but I'm a little confused.

1626
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:00,723
Before my mother died,
I'd asked her...

1627
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:05,254
...when I'll be able to see again.

1628
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:09,727
She said that
she's going to meet God.

1629
01:29:09,936 --> 01:29:15,738
There she'll request Him to come
down to earth to fix my eyes.

1630
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:20,207
I asked her if God will
have any time for me.

1631
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:22,738
She said, why not?

1632
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:28,755
And if he's very busy, he'll
send his friend instead.

1633
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:33,225
Hence, I'm confused whether
you are God or his friend.

1634
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,226
Uncle, tell me, are you
God or his friend?

1635
01:29:47,907 --> 01:29:50,171
This is the Indian market
of this country. - Really?

1636
01:29:50,243 --> 01:29:53,770
It's the best place
for wedding shopping. - Happy.

1637
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:56,243
Yes, mom!
- Sorry! - What happened?

1638
01:29:56,449 --> 01:29:57,780
No, the wedding date
can't be changed as...

1639
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,443
...Saint Divine Finger
has fixed it.

1640
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:01,043
What could I do?
It was very slippery.

1641
01:30:01,121 --> 01:30:02,179
Yes, that's right.

1642
01:30:02,255 --> 01:30:05,918
Even now I'm with your
future daughter-in-law.

1643
01:30:07,394 --> 01:30:08,452
Hold on for a minute.

1644
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,791
You all carry on, I'll join you.

1645
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:12,189
Come soon.

1646
01:30:12,799 --> 01:30:13,857
Yes, mom.

1647
01:30:13,933 --> 01:30:17,130
Dear, your dad's refused
to come for the wedding.

1648
01:30:17,337 --> 01:30:22,468
Tell him that aunt Rose can
help him in his business.

1649
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:23,804
Tell him to think about that.

1650
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,811
Really?
- Bye.

1651
01:30:39,025 --> 01:30:40,151
Oh no!
- What happened?

1652
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,955
You're too funny!

1653
01:30:42,362 --> 01:30:43,829
C'mon Anjali, hurry up!

1654
01:30:48,835 --> 01:30:50,826
Tanya!
- Raftaar!

1655
01:30:52,505 --> 01:30:53,836
I'm seeing you after 6 years!

1656
01:30:54,374 --> 01:30:56,842
How've you been?
- I'm fine. And you?

1657
01:30:58,445 --> 01:30:59,503
I'm fine.

1658
01:30:59,846 --> 01:31:02,440
Driver, where's ma'am Sonia?

1659
01:31:02,982 --> 01:31:04,449
She must be around, sir.

1660
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:05,976
These servants are such brats!

1661
01:31:06,052 --> 01:31:07,314
All seem to be hanging around girls.

1662
01:31:08,121 --> 01:31:10,055
I'm glad to see you like this.

1663
01:31:10,457 --> 01:31:12,448
So, you've finally changed your ways.

1664
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:19,262
You left without informing...
- What could I say?

1665
01:31:19,532 --> 01:31:21,261
Mom, let's go!

1666
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:25,132
Is she your daughter?
- Yes.

1667
01:31:25,205 --> 01:31:26,263
How old is she?

1668
01:31:27,006 --> 01:31:28,064
She's 5 years old.

1669
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:31,343
I'll get going. Let's go, Anjali.

1670
01:31:31,878 --> 01:31:35,006
Why did you lie to uncle?

1671
01:31:35,415 --> 01:31:36,882
I'm 6 years old.

1672
01:31:41,888 --> 01:31:44,880
Oh Lord.

1673
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:49,953
Mom!
- Let's go. Father is waiting.

1674
01:31:57,904 --> 01:31:59,428
Happy!
- Yes?

1675
01:31:59,506 --> 01:32:02,634
How's this? - Your kids will be
born after 1 year.

1676
01:32:02,909 --> 01:32:03,967
Why shop for them now?

1677
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:07,108
These are for me!

1678
01:32:08,047 --> 01:32:11,642
Look, even the mannequins are
blushing. Have some shame!

1679
01:32:11,918 --> 01:32:13,044
Let's try another store.

1680
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:15,986
Come, I'll buy you good
Indian clothes.

1681
01:32:19,592 --> 01:32:21,651
If you wear Indian clothes
in the wedding...

1682
01:32:22,462 --> 01:32:23,520
Hey!

1683
01:32:25,932 --> 01:32:27,456
I'll kill you, you criminal!

1684
01:32:29,269 --> 01:32:31,066
Let's get out of here, Sonia! Come.

1685
01:32:34,941 --> 01:32:35,999
Sonia!

1686
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:39,269
Happy! What's going on?
Who are these people?

1687
01:32:39,946 --> 01:32:41,004
Happy.

1688
01:32:42,615 --> 01:32:46,278
Happy, be careful!

1689
01:32:46,953 --> 01:32:49,353
Hey!
- Sonia!

1690
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:54,358
Leave me, criminals! Happy!

1691
01:33:02,168 --> 01:33:05,569
Mom!
- Hey!

1692
01:33:11,644 --> 01:33:14,704
Anjali!
- Come, my dear. - Dear. - Mummy.

1693
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:16,642
A person like you can never change!
- Tanya, listen to me!

1694
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:19,048
Let go off my daughter!
- Tanya, listen to me!

1695
01:33:19,986 --> 01:33:21,044
What happened?
- Happy!

1696
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,179
That's my daughter...

1697
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:26,117
Who are you talking about?

1698
01:33:26,526 --> 01:33:28,653
Ever thought of how many
kids you've orphaned?

1699
01:33:28,995 --> 01:33:35,992
Oh Lord.

1700
01:33:40,273 --> 01:33:41,331
Leave me, I'll kill you!

1701
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:54,019
You better watch yourselves.

1702
01:34:01,628 --> 01:34:02,686
Happy!

1703
01:34:06,032 --> 01:34:07,090
Happy!

1704
01:34:20,713 --> 01:34:24,046
Singh is king.

1705
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:26,051
Singh is king.

1706
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:31,116
Singh is king.

1707
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,248
Happy!

1708
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:39,731
Sonia!
- Happy!

1709
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:41,528
They want to kill you!

1710
01:34:46,205 --> 01:34:47,263
Stop you!

1711
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,138
Happy!

1712
01:35:13,232 --> 01:35:15,700
Why do they want to kill you? Happy!

1713
01:35:16,235 --> 01:35:18,430
I'd sent a criminal to jail last week.

1714
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,096
They're probably here to take revenge.

1715
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:23,433
What do we do now?

1716
01:35:24,577 --> 01:35:25,635
Ever flown a helicopter?

1717
01:35:25,712 --> 01:35:26,770
No Happy!

1718
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,438
Do you know how to fly?
- Shut up!

1719
01:35:28,715 --> 01:35:30,114
But I'm sure you know how to swim!

1720
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:31,241
C'mon Sonia!
- Oh my God!

1721
01:35:31,317 --> 01:35:36,311
Jump!
- Hail Guru Nanak Singh!

1722
01:35:46,265 --> 01:35:48,130
Are we still alive?
- Yes, we are.

1723
01:35:49,135 --> 01:35:50,602
Are you sure?
- Come, Ms Sonia.

1724
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,202
Slow. Thank you.
- Careful.

1725
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,267
Thank you. We're almost there.
- Thank you.

1726
01:35:57,276 --> 01:35:58,334
Any improvement?

1727
01:35:58,411 --> 01:36:00,140
Tremendous improvement!

1728
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:03,410
Great! Distribute money
amongst the poor.

1729
01:36:03,483 --> 01:36:04,677
They'll bless us.

1730
01:36:04,751 --> 01:36:06,685
But we have a problem.
- What's that?

1731
01:36:06,753 --> 01:36:08,414
From where do we find poor people?

1732
01:36:08,488 --> 01:36:11,150
India is full of them.

1733
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:13,624
Suitcases filled with money are
being dispatched every day.

1734
01:36:14,293 --> 01:36:15,555
Mom, they're robbing you!

1735
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:17,890
Why would anyone rob me?

1736
01:36:18,498 --> 01:36:20,489
What would they find except flowers?

1737
01:36:21,501 --> 01:36:22,559
Flowers?!

1738
01:36:25,705 --> 01:36:29,163
I mean, flowers should be watered.
Or they wither.

1739
01:36:29,509 --> 01:36:30,771
C'mon, water them!

1740
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:35,177
You seem to know a lot about flowers!

1741
01:36:36,182 --> 01:36:37,240
Of course!

1742
01:36:37,316 --> 01:36:38,374
She's Phoolan Devi! ('Phool'
means flower)

1743
01:36:40,653 --> 01:36:43,588
C'mon, scoot! Go!

1744
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:45,316
It's almost evening.

1745
01:36:45,391 --> 01:36:46,449
I've been asking you since morning...

1746
01:36:46,526 --> 01:36:47,720
...but nobody seems to know anything!

1747
01:36:47,794 --> 01:36:51,594
Sonia!
- Where've you been all morning?

1748
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:55,531
Where were you?
- I was...

1749
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,193
Why weren't you taking my calls?

1750
01:36:57,336 --> 01:37:00,464
Oh! 13 missed calls.

1751
01:37:01,207 --> 01:37:02,868
It was on silent, that's why...

1752
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,204
But where were you?

1753
01:37:04,343 --> 01:37:05,935
You didn't even inform anyone!

1754
01:37:06,212 --> 01:37:07,873
I'd gone to purchase
your wedding cards.

1755
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:13,750
Come here.
- Careful! I'm wearing new shoes.

1756
01:37:14,554 --> 01:37:16,613
Why did you have to take Julie along?

1757
01:37:16,689 --> 01:37:19,681
Because she knew where exactly
one would get wedding cards!

1758
01:37:21,227 --> 01:37:22,353
What's the problem?

1759
01:37:22,895 --> 01:37:24,760
I think it's a shoe problem.

1760
01:37:24,831 --> 01:37:27,231
Happy, you're different.

1761
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:28,758
She's different.

1762
01:37:29,235 --> 01:37:30,566
She's not your type.

1763
01:37:31,437 --> 01:37:35,567
Since I'm a manager, only a typist
would qualify as my type.

1764
01:37:36,709 --> 01:37:38,836
All right, my job was to
warn you and so I did.

1765
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,912
Now, it's up to you and your typist.

1766
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:49,587
Why are you smiling? What happened?

1767
01:37:53,259 --> 01:37:58,458
No, it's not a shoe problem!
- You've fallen in love!

1768
01:37:58,798 --> 01:38:01,323
I'd once fallen in love.

1769
01:38:03,269 --> 01:38:06,261
I was leaving my girlfriend's house...

1770
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:08,807
...when my wife caught me red-handed.

1771
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:12,004
I lost both the women on the same day!

1772
01:38:12,278 --> 01:38:14,405
Udaas, drink up!

1773
01:38:15,748 --> 01:38:18,273
Julie, how come we didn't realize...

1774
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:20,546
...that Sonia is in love with Happy?

1775
01:38:20,953 --> 01:38:22,011
Black. - What?

1776
01:38:22,288 --> 01:38:24,017
It's because you all are
blind and deaf!

1777
01:38:24,957 --> 01:38:27,357
I've seen the love she feels
for Happy in her eyes.

1778
01:38:27,426 --> 01:38:29,758
Hello Ms. Roppad!
- I'm from Patiala!

1779
01:38:29,829 --> 01:38:31,353
Yes, that's what.

1780
01:38:31,898 --> 01:38:36,301
You've seen the love in her eyes,
now look at her wedding invitation.

1781
01:38:37,303 --> 01:38:40,898
Why's she marrying that idiot,
when she's in love with Happy?

1782
01:38:40,973 --> 01:38:43,032
She herself doesn't
know she loves him.

1783
01:38:43,309 --> 01:38:44,970
How's that possible?

1784
01:38:45,311 --> 01:38:46,972
It happens at times, Guru.

1785
01:38:47,313 --> 01:38:50,771
She gets restless if Happy leaves
her for a little while.

1786
01:38:52,318 --> 01:38:56,049
She feels jealous if he's
talking to another girl.

1787
01:38:56,322 --> 01:38:57,914
If this is not love, then what is it?

1788
01:38:58,324 --> 01:38:59,382
Foolishness!

1789
01:38:59,659 --> 01:39:01,320
Mika, empty glass?!

1790
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,586
But my heart's filled with grief!

1791
01:39:03,996 --> 01:39:08,330
I won't drink a single peg until
Happy and Sonia are united.

1792
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:12,599
But first let's find out whether
Happy loves Sonia or not.

1793
01:39:12,672 --> 01:39:16,802
He's crazy about her!
He misses her all day.

1794
01:39:17,476 --> 01:39:20,343
He had planned his marital
and family life...

1795
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:22,540
...the minute he saw her in Egypt!

1796
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:28,349
It's because of ma'am Rose, he's
getting her married to that idiot.

1797
01:39:28,621 --> 01:39:33,354
I think my best friend Happy will
remain a bachelor for life.

1798
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:38,763
Idiots, do something about Happy!

1799
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:41,960
Hats off to you, sir!

1800
01:39:42,368 --> 01:39:47,362
You sleep at 3 a.m. And wake up
early to go jogging! Strange!

1801
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,498
How do you manage it.

1802
01:39:48,574 --> 01:39:50,838
3 a. M? You fool! I sleep
at 10 every night.

1803
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:54,505
What are you saying? Weren't you
talking to ma'am Sonia till 3...

1804
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:57,715
That wasn't you?

1805
01:39:57,850 --> 01:40:01,047
Oh! It must be Sir Happy.

1806
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:05,386
He doesn't sleep all night and
wakes up late in the morning.

1807
01:40:05,925 --> 01:40:07,654
I guess they were discussing
your wedding details.

1808
01:40:07,727 --> 01:40:10,525
Udaas!
- Yes. - Hurry up!

1809
01:40:10,596 --> 01:40:11,722
Coming!
- You may go.

1810
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,867
Thank you.
- Sir, juice for you.

1811
01:40:16,402 --> 01:40:18,393
Sir, Sonia ma'am is not to be seen.

1812
01:40:18,671 --> 01:40:19,933
Have you gone crazy?
- Why?

1813
01:40:20,006 --> 01:40:21,405
Why would she be here?

1814
01:40:21,874 --> 01:40:24,069
Go to Sir Happy, if
you want to find her.

1815
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:25,934
They are always together.

1816
01:40:26,412 --> 01:40:27,470
Drink your juice, sir?

1817
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:33,415
The names of these flowers
are very complicated.

1818
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:34,680
I can never remember them.

1819
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,088
Hence, I've named them myself.

1820
01:40:37,757 --> 01:40:39,486
Good, let's hear their names.

1821
01:40:39,759 --> 01:40:43,422
These two flowers with
their heads together...

1822
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:48,024
...are Sonia ma'am and Happy
sir. Forever blossoming!

1823
01:40:48,567 --> 01:40:53,027
The withered flower over
there is Puneet sir.

1824
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:55,703
Remains withered, no matter
how much you water it!

1825
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:04,841
Mr. Pooh, listen to me.
I'll tell you a secret.

1826
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:06,646
Please Mika, I can't take it.

1827
01:41:06,986 --> 01:41:08,044
I don't want to hear a word.

1828
01:41:09,455 --> 01:41:14,654
Then listen, all the servants
are fooling you.

1829
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:16,718
They are making dumb-bells of you!

1830
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:20,727
They are trying to break
you and Sonia up.

1831
01:41:21,133 --> 01:41:23,601
Don't be fooled by them. Bewares!

1832
01:41:28,007 --> 01:41:32,068
Have you lost it? Why are
you talking to yourself?

1833
01:41:32,478 --> 01:41:33,536
Talking to myself?!

1834
01:41:36,816 --> 01:41:38,750
Well, one prays to God when alone.

1835
01:41:39,151 --> 01:41:42,018
God! Save my brother Lucky.

1836
01:41:42,822 --> 01:41:45,017
That depends on his luck. You
look after yourself first.

1837
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:47,891
He'll be fine soon, you'll see!

1838
01:41:49,829 --> 01:41:55,028
See? She just added
insult to my injury.

1839
01:42:04,643 --> 01:42:05,701
I got it!

1840
01:42:09,648 --> 01:42:11,172
Are you hurt?

1841
01:42:11,517 --> 01:42:12,575
Show me.

1842
01:42:14,653 --> 01:42:17,588
It's your fault!
- No, it's your fault.

1843
01:42:31,137 --> 01:42:34,538
Wow! Just another of mom's
varied businesses!

1844
01:42:34,874 --> 01:42:37,206
This show is so amazing,
don't you think?

1845
01:42:37,877 --> 01:42:40,209
You enjoy, if you're liking it.

1846
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,280
I've been noticing since two
days that you aren't happy.

1847
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,878
That's right, Sonia. I'm
not Happy. I'm Puneet.

1848
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:51,889
But now I think I too should
be Happy. Know why?

1849
01:42:52,558 --> 01:42:55,288
Because Happy is really happy,
but Puneet isn't.

1850
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:01,227
What are you talking about?

1851
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:05,100
You're marrying me but talk
to Happy all night!

1852
01:43:06,172 --> 01:43:08,970
You are always with him.

1853
01:43:09,241 --> 01:43:10,299
What is this, Sonia?

1854
01:43:12,244 --> 01:43:14,838
You think there's something going
on between Happy and me?

1855
01:43:14,914 --> 01:43:16,711
Yes, I do.

1856
01:43:19,251 --> 01:43:22,186
I'm not as rich as you but that
doesn't mean I'll tolerate all this.

1857
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:23,583
I can't take it!

1858
01:43:24,256 --> 01:43:26,781
You're so shallow and cheap!

1859
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:29,327
You're doubting me?!

1860
01:43:29,595 --> 01:43:32,587
Listen, if you're having second
thoughts about the wedding...

1861
01:43:32,665 --> 01:43:33,859
...let me know beforehand.

1862
01:43:33,933 --> 01:43:34,991
Enough Puneet!

1863
01:43:35,067 --> 01:43:37,592
Another word and I'll forget
all about my book...

1864
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:40,002
...and commit a crime right here!

1865
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:09,363
Puneet, did you manage
to catch any fish?

1866
01:44:09,768 --> 01:44:11,235
Why are you upset?

1867
01:44:18,777 --> 01:44:21,177
You are a manager, stay
in your limits.

1868
01:44:21,647 --> 01:44:23,638
Don't try to get friendly with me.

1869
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:26,317
It's wrong.

1870
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:31,652
Not what you did right now,
but what you're doing to her.

1871
01:44:32,258 --> 01:44:36,126
You love her, don't you? Then
why can't you see her happy?

1872
01:44:36,729 --> 01:44:40,062
You can't stand her laughter!
What kind of a love is this?

1873
01:44:42,668 --> 01:44:44,397
I said, shut up!

1874
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:47,332
Why are you asking me to shut up?

1875
01:44:48,941 --> 01:44:50,408
Is it because she laughs with me?

1876
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:54,743
Don't people laugh looking
at a joker in a circus?

1877
01:44:55,681 --> 01:44:57,672
I'm a joker in ma'am Sonia's life.

1878
01:45:00,352 --> 01:45:05,949
Do I seem so intelligent to you,
that I can impress a writer?

1879
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:13,354
Sonia is one in a million,
and she loves you!

1880
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:15,297
And that makes you one in a billion!

1881
01:45:16,969 --> 01:45:23,238
I'm just an illiterate fool! A
'villager' like you say in English.

1882
01:45:23,709 --> 01:45:24,767
I am everything.

1883
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:33,043
I can only make people laugh,
not win their hearts.

1884
01:45:35,721 --> 01:45:37,188
Come with me for a minute.

1885
01:45:40,059 --> 01:45:42,459
What's wrong with the two of you?

1886
01:45:42,728 --> 01:45:44,719
You are getting married in two days...

1887
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:46,731
...and are doubting your
love for each other?!

1888
01:45:47,333 --> 01:45:51,861
Come on, shake hands. Come on.
Sonia, get your hand.

1889
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:58,744
Very good. Now hug each other.
Come on. Very good.

1890
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:01,143
Very good. Now that's how
it should be! Very good.

1891
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:40,776
I've lost my heart to someone.

1892
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:46,189
I've found my happiness.

1893
01:46:46,258 --> 01:46:51,992
I'm dreaming about someone.

1894
01:46:52,064 --> 01:46:57,798
I've found my happiness.

1895
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:03,001
A bond that has touched my heart.

1896
01:47:03,542 --> 01:47:07,945
It's drawing me towards you.

1897
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:11,148
Closer towards you...

1898
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:13,878
Closer towards you, God.

1899
01:47:13,952 --> 01:47:16,546
Closer towards you...

1900
01:47:16,822 --> 01:47:19,154
Closer towards you, God.

1901
01:47:19,825 --> 01:47:22,555
Closer towards you...

1902
01:47:22,828 --> 01:47:25,353
Closer towards you, God.

1903
01:47:25,431 --> 01:47:28,161
Closer towards you...

1904
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,168
Closer towards you...

1905
01:47:43,849 --> 01:47:46,249
The intoxicating ambience...

1906
01:47:46,518 --> 01:47:49,851
The dark clouds giving way...

1907
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:53,858
...to a whole new world above me.

1908
01:47:55,127 --> 01:47:57,857
Nature is rejoicing.

1909
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,398
It's calling out my name.

1910
01:48:00,866 --> 01:48:04,859
Why is the universe being so kind?

1911
01:48:05,404 --> 01:48:07,872
God, all I know is that...

1912
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,874
...there's no denying...

1913
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:11,876
...my feelings for you.

1914
01:48:12,077 --> 01:48:16,605
I'm being drawn towards you.

1915
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:19,611
Closer towards you...

1916
01:48:19,885 --> 01:48:22,615
Closer towards you, God.

1917
01:48:22,888 --> 01:48:27,882
Closer towards you...

1918
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:31,158
Closer towards you...

1919
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:33,960
Closer towards you, God.

1920
01:48:34,032 --> 01:48:40,096
Closer towards you...

1921
01:49:13,372 --> 01:49:15,704
I'm a black belt champion!

1922
01:49:15,774 --> 01:49:17,173
I'll break your bones
if you come near me!

1923
01:49:36,595 --> 01:49:38,722
Let's dump him in the car
and chop him into pieces!

1924
01:49:38,797 --> 01:49:40,264
No gang has harassed
us as much as he has!

1925
01:49:40,566 --> 01:49:43,057
I'm neither connected to
any of the gang groups...

1926
01:49:43,135 --> 01:49:45,330
...nor do I mess with the underworld.

1927
01:49:45,404 --> 01:49:47,133
You're definitely misunderstood.

1928
01:49:47,206 --> 01:49:48,468
No, we've got the right person.

1929
01:49:49,675 --> 01:49:54,112
You're definitely mistaken.
I'm just a tourist!

1930
01:49:54,179 --> 01:49:55,669
You aren't a tourist, but a terrorist!

1931
01:49:56,181 --> 01:49:58,149
You've terrorized the servants!

1932
01:49:58,217 --> 01:49:59,741
You bit me so hard, you dog!

1933
01:49:59,818 --> 01:50:02,616
Your voices sound very familiar.

1934
01:50:02,688 --> 01:50:04,747
Our faces too are very familiar!

1935
01:50:04,823 --> 01:50:06,757
Look!
- You fools!

1936
01:50:06,825 --> 01:50:09,089
You called me Devdas.
- All of you...

1937
01:50:09,161 --> 01:50:10,685
You idiot!

1938
01:50:11,597 --> 01:50:13,258
The wedding should take
place smoothly.

1939
01:50:13,332 --> 01:50:15,163
I'll call the priest. Okay.

1940
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:16,360
King!
- Stop panting!

1941
01:50:16,435 --> 01:50:17,493
King.
- Tell me.

1942
01:50:17,803 --> 01:50:22,706
Yes, go ahead. - King, the heroes
masks from my room are missing.

1943
01:50:22,774 --> 01:50:24,207
I think Puneet's life is in danger.

1944
01:50:24,276 --> 01:50:26,506
What?! - Yes, come along.
- I'll explain everything.

1945
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:32,508
Bring him out!

1946
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:35,280
C'mon step out! Come on, move!
- Move!

1947
01:50:36,188 --> 01:50:38,213
How dare you, you fools!

1948
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,148
Get home, I'll fire each one of you!

1949
01:50:40,225 --> 01:50:45,253
Fire us later, let me chop
your insides first.

1950
01:50:47,532 --> 01:50:50,194
You idiots! Is this the
time to cut vegetables?

1951
01:50:50,269 --> 01:50:52,237
This is the first time we've used
the knife to cut vegetables.

1952
01:50:52,471 --> 01:50:55,338
Show him what all we've cut before.

1953
01:50:58,210 --> 01:50:59,268
Look here.

1954
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:05,307
This is the front page
of the newspaper.

1955
01:51:05,651 --> 01:51:07,585
This gardener used to
hide it every morning.

1956
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,780
Devdas!

1957
01:51:11,189 --> 01:51:13,248
My face looks stuffed
to you, doesn't it?

1958
01:51:14,426 --> 01:51:17,589
And I'm the driver who blocked
the news telecast in your room.

1959
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:20,197
I'm in trouble. I can't take it!

1960
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:22,257
Where are you off to?

1961
01:51:25,337 --> 01:51:27,362
Today, I'll stuff your insides!

1962
01:51:27,439 --> 01:51:30,237
Please listen to me, what's
your good name?

1963
01:51:30,309 --> 01:51:35,372
Is it Potato Singh or Stuffed Knife?
Please don't mind... - Shut up!

1964
01:51:35,447 --> 01:51:36,846
Hey!
- No!

1965
01:51:43,255 --> 01:51:45,314
What are you doing?
- Happy!

1966
01:51:48,794 --> 01:51:51,285
No matter how hard one tries,
you people won't change.

1967
01:51:52,698 --> 01:51:54,598
He's getting married to
ma'am Sonia tomorrow.

1968
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,293
If you kill him, who will marry her?

1969
01:51:57,369 --> 01:52:00,600
You will. You too are in love
with her, aren't you?

1970
01:52:04,276 --> 01:52:06,267
Wonder from where this
guy came in between!

1971
01:52:08,246 --> 01:52:10,714
He didn't come in between, I did.

1972
01:52:12,584 --> 01:52:14,279
If you want to kill someone, kill me!

1973
01:52:14,653 --> 01:52:17,315
Rangeela got drunk and spoke nonsense.

1974
01:52:17,889 --> 01:52:18,947
And you all believed him?!

1975
01:52:19,224 --> 01:52:20,316
How could you?

1976
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:24,723
Guru, you are sensible. You
should've stopped them.

1977
01:52:29,301 --> 01:52:31,394
Hey!
- He escaped, that fool!

1978
01:52:35,307 --> 01:52:38,299
He'll tell everything to Sonia.
What now, King?

1979
01:52:47,352 --> 01:52:50,788
You've helped my mother
a lot. Thank you, Happy.

1980
01:52:52,324 --> 01:52:53,985
I mean, thank you King.

1981
01:52:56,261 --> 01:52:57,319
Sonia!

1982
01:52:57,929 --> 01:52:59,294
I'm just telling the truth.

1983
01:52:59,564 --> 01:53:02,658
But it sounds bitter this
time, doesn't it King?

1984
01:53:05,303 --> 01:53:07,464
You addressed him correctly this time.

1985
01:53:07,939 --> 01:53:11,375
He indeed is our King.

1986
01:53:11,943 --> 01:53:13,934
But do you know why he became King?

1987
01:53:14,346 --> 01:53:20,342
So that he can keep us criminals
from committing more crimes!

1988
01:53:22,354 --> 01:53:25,289
Yes, so that we come to our senses...

1989
01:53:25,357 --> 01:53:30,351
...and think why we're
doing what we're doing.

1990
01:53:31,463 --> 01:53:34,296
Sonia, you believe that
the death of criminals...

1991
01:53:34,366 --> 01:53:36,891
...would mark the end of crime.

1992
01:53:37,636 --> 01:53:41,697
But our King believes that only
love can conquer hatred.

1993
01:53:42,007 --> 01:53:47,343
Without firing a single bullet, he's
put an end to the evil in us.

1994
01:53:47,412 --> 01:53:51,371
He didn't become King to
enjoy the perks of it.

1995
01:53:51,917 --> 01:53:55,409
He did it in order to take our
real King back to his village.

1996
01:53:55,654 --> 01:53:57,485
To make him realize his mistakes...

1997
01:53:57,556 --> 01:53:59,387
...to show him the correct path...

1998
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:01,756
...and to reunite him with his parents.

1999
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:10,396
Sonia, I've spent my entire
life In the world of crime.

2000
01:54:11,837 --> 01:54:16,001
But I've never seen such a King
In the entire history of crime.

2001
01:54:17,843 --> 01:54:22,337
Ma'am, my friend is no King. He's
just a Singh, Happy Singh...

2002
01:54:22,414 --> 01:54:25,008
...who wants to see everyone happy.

2003
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:29,076
And especially me, who he
considers his mother.

2004
01:54:31,089 --> 01:54:34,024
I once happened to give him
food when he was hungry.

2005
01:54:34,092 --> 01:54:36,424
Ever since, he considers
all my troubles as his.

2006
01:54:38,697 --> 01:54:43,100
You fool, no one returns such a
huge favour for a slice of bread.

2007
01:54:44,035 --> 01:54:46,936
He did all this so you
could get married.

2008
01:54:49,374 --> 01:54:51,467
But will I get married now?

2009
01:54:54,446 --> 01:54:58,473
Will Puneet marry me after
knowing the truth?

2010
01:54:59,551 --> 01:55:00,609
Of course, I will!

2011
01:55:09,427 --> 01:55:13,386
I would've accepted you even
if they had killed me...

2012
01:55:13,465 --> 01:55:15,490
...instead of kidnapping me.

2013
01:55:16,902 --> 01:55:18,893
You being rich or poor makes
no difference to me.

2014
01:55:20,739 --> 01:55:22,570
I love you not for your money.

2015
01:55:28,446 --> 01:55:29,606
We'll get married tomorrow.

2016
01:55:29,848 --> 01:55:32,544
Towards you.
- Let's go.

2017
01:55:32,617 --> 01:55:34,744
Towards you.

2018
01:55:35,487 --> 01:55:39,514
Towards you.

2019
01:55:39,591 --> 01:55:40,853
Puneet, one minute.

2020
01:55:43,094 --> 01:55:45,961
All of you please come
to my wedding tomorrow.

2021
01:55:49,901 --> 01:55:52,096
Happy, you too.

2022
01:56:03,114 --> 01:56:04,172
Sonia, let's go.

2023
01:56:07,786 --> 01:56:09,811
This boy needs a psychiatrist!

2024
01:56:10,488 --> 01:56:13,514
He's marrying the girl
King is in love with!

2025
01:56:14,059 --> 01:56:15,720
He'll put our lives in danger too!

2026
01:56:15,794 --> 01:56:17,455
Mom, dad, you're worried
about your lives...

2027
01:56:17,529 --> 01:56:19,997
...here my wedding is in danger!
- Don't worry, dad.

2028
01:56:20,065 --> 01:56:22,465
This man standing behind me
is taking me to a person...

2029
01:56:22,534 --> 01:56:24,798
...who'll get rid of
this danger for good.

2030
01:56:26,504 --> 01:56:28,768
For the past 30 years, this boy
has been giving me headaches!

2031
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:31,700
30? But he's only 29.

2032
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:33,175
You were carrying him
for a year, remember?

2033
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:13,911
I can see everything.

2034
01:57:13,985 --> 01:57:18,581
Everything in this
world has a price.

2035
01:57:20,592 --> 01:57:22,753
Nobody stays here forever.

2036
01:57:22,827 --> 01:57:24,658
I'm the winning horse. Don't
take me to be a loser.

2037
01:57:24,729 --> 01:57:26,697
I'll be the King, my name is Mika.

2038
01:57:26,765 --> 01:57:27,823
Mika.

2039
01:57:30,535 --> 01:57:31,627
Mika.

2040
01:57:32,604 --> 01:57:33,730
Mika.

2041
01:57:34,673 --> 01:57:35,833
Mika.

2042
01:57:36,908 --> 01:57:37,966
Alright, stop!

2043
01:57:38,043 --> 01:57:39,601
Now, give me your attention.

2044
01:57:39,678 --> 01:57:42,613
I'm the best, so do as I say.

2045
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:43,739
Money is the name of the game.

2046
01:57:43,815 --> 01:57:44,873
North, south, east or west...

2047
01:57:44,949 --> 01:57:46,007
The language of money is the same.

2048
01:57:46,084 --> 01:57:47,881
It's an old story, you better know.

2049
01:57:47,952 --> 01:57:49,943
If you give one hand,
take two in return.

2050
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:52,216
Listen up, this is the greatest
lesson in the world.

2051
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:54,622
All the great people have
learnt this lesson.

2052
01:57:56,561 --> 01:57:59,724
That's me, Mika.

2053
01:58:01,633 --> 01:58:02,691
Mika!

2054
01:58:03,601 --> 01:58:05,626
I'd never imagined I'd see you here.

2055
01:58:06,638 --> 01:58:09,630
I like to surprise people,
keep them in the dark.

2056
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:11,198
That's Mika for you.

2057
01:58:11,276 --> 01:58:14,109
I thought that you couldn't
see or hear properly.

2058
01:58:14,846 --> 01:58:19,579
It's not just you. I've convinced
many people including...

2059
01:58:19,651 --> 01:58:25,317
...my brother and Guru, into
believing I'm blind and deaf.

2060
01:58:26,024 --> 01:58:27,889
What will you gain out of this?
- Sympathy.

2061
01:58:28,927 --> 01:58:31,054
Mind game!
- Mika.

2062
01:58:31,129 --> 01:58:34,656
My only concern is whether you'll
be able to kill Happy or not.

2063
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:37,660
Happy is my enemy first
and then he's yours.

2064
01:58:42,107 --> 01:58:44,769
I've tried to kill him
many times in the past.

2065
01:58:45,944 --> 01:58:51,348
You love Sonia while I love
the King's throne! - Mika.

2066
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:54,013
Then see you at the wedding!

2067
01:58:59,124 --> 01:59:01,285
Mika.
- Brother Mika!

2068
01:59:01,893 --> 01:59:03,622
What a performance! I bet
he never suspected...

2069
01:59:03,695 --> 01:59:06,220
...that you can't see!

2070
01:59:07,065 --> 01:59:10,125
You fool! This is my den.

2071
01:59:11,302 --> 01:59:13,736
I've personally measured
every inch of this place.

2072
01:59:13,805 --> 01:59:16,035
I won't be fit to be called King
had I let anyone suspect me here.

2073
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:17,768
I can't understand one thing.

2074
01:59:17,842 --> 01:59:20,037
How were you able to listen
to him so clearly?

2075
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:24,138
Idiot, I didn't wear this
hearing aid to show off!

2076
01:59:24,215 --> 01:59:26,706
If I don't wear it in my den,
then where will I?

2077
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:33,657
Now, I'm just waiting for the
latest hearing aid and shades...

2078
01:59:33,725 --> 01:59:37,388
...that I've ordered from Japan.

2079
01:59:38,129 --> 01:59:45,763
Once I get them, I'll be able to
see and hear everything clearly.

2080
01:59:57,248 --> 02:00:01,878
Rangeela, don't make my grief
an excuse for your drinking.

2081
02:00:02,253 --> 02:00:04,244
You should've been here with me today.

2082
02:00:04,756 --> 02:00:06,781
Instead, you're at home getting drunk.

2083
02:00:06,858 --> 02:00:10,055
It's you and not that idiot
who deserves to be the groom!

2084
02:00:10,995 --> 02:00:12,792
I'm really depressed!

2085
02:00:12,864 --> 02:00:17,358
If Sonia gets married to that idiot,
Happy will be heartbroken.

2086
02:00:17,735 --> 02:00:19,100
Sardar!
- Yes.

2087
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:21,161
You've bought everything, but
have forgotten the vermillion.

2088
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:23,707
He's been given so much
responsibility...

2089
02:00:23,775 --> 02:00:25,766
...that he's completely caught up.

2090
02:00:25,844 --> 02:00:28,711
We should help him get the
girl in such a way...

2091
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,112
...that nobody suspects a thing.

2092
02:00:31,182 --> 02:00:36,745
Enjoy! - Dilbaug! The groom
seems to be very brave.

2093
02:00:36,821 --> 02:00:38,220
Why do you say that?

2094
02:00:38,289 --> 02:00:39,722
Only a brave father's son...

2095
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:42,783
...would marry the girl
King is in love with.

2096
02:00:44,329 --> 02:00:46,763
His bravery will soon fizzle out.
- Why?

2097
02:00:46,831 --> 02:00:48,321
Look at King!
- Where?

2098
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,030
Idiot! Why are you looking around?
He's right in front of you.

2099
02:00:51,102 --> 02:00:55,471
I see him now! King's calling
his sharp-shooter.

2100
02:00:55,807 --> 02:00:57,069
Why is it taking so long?

2101
02:00:57,742 --> 02:00:58,800
Hurry up!

2102
02:00:58,877 --> 02:01:04,247
Did you see that? I think that the
groom's first night will be his last.

2103
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:08,208
The night is still far away.

2104
02:01:08,419 --> 02:01:10,284
I don't think he'll make
it even through the day.

2105
02:01:10,421 --> 02:01:15,256
King is angry! He'll cut him
into at least a 100 pieces.

2106
02:01:17,428 --> 02:01:19,419
I don't have to spend
an eternity with her.

2107
02:01:19,497 --> 02:01:21,021
So, don't take an eternity
to recite the mantras.

2108
02:01:21,266 --> 02:01:24,827
Yes.
- Complete the rituals within an hour.

2109
02:01:24,903 --> 02:01:28,339
Once you start with them,
don't stop, come what may.

2110
02:01:28,406 --> 02:01:29,873
I should've been the one to stop.

2111
02:01:29,941 --> 02:01:31,431
Had I stopped on time...

2112
02:01:31,509 --> 02:01:33,204
...we wouldn't have had a dumb son
like you. What's the matter?

2113
02:01:33,278 --> 02:01:34,768
Sharpshooters have arrived
to kill you...

2114
02:01:34,846 --> 02:01:37,110
...on your wedding day!

2115
02:01:37,181 --> 02:01:38,239
Oh my God!

2116
02:01:41,886 --> 02:01:44,081
What is the 'Chicken Manchurian'
gang doing here?

2117
02:01:47,191 --> 02:01:48,249
And these 'Men in Black'?

2118
02:01:50,828 --> 02:01:53,296
Something's fishy. We
must do something.

2119
02:01:53,464 --> 02:01:56,297
Listen, think before doing anything.

2120
02:01:56,801 --> 02:02:00,498
Worry not, Guru! What am I here for?

2121
02:02:05,276 --> 02:02:10,475
Nice suit! Armani? No, Gucci.
- Oh really! I like Gucci.

2122
02:02:10,882 --> 02:02:13,442
So, are you having fun?
- I am.

2123
02:02:14,852 --> 02:02:15,944
You know, I like men in black.

2124
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:18,215
And I like women in white! Bye!
- Meet you at night, baby!

2125
02:02:18,289 --> 02:02:20,553
Happy has made me really unhappy!

2126
02:02:20,825 --> 02:02:22,224
He must die.

2127
02:02:23,094 --> 02:02:26,552
Even if you can't kill him,
at least bring Sonia to me.

2128
02:02:26,831 --> 02:02:27,923
I'll marry her someplace else.

2129
02:02:38,876 --> 02:02:40,935
Good job!
- They are at least 15 to 20, right?

2130
02:02:41,012 --> 02:02:42,104
Yes.
- Take this.

2131
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,238
I'll get some more.

2132
02:02:43,314 --> 02:02:45,908
Kill everyone if there's
even a single gunshot.

2133
02:02:46,484 --> 02:02:48,384
Turn the wedding into a funeral.

2134
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,917
And kidnap the bride!

2135
02:02:53,191 --> 02:02:55,056
But how? Somebody stole all our guns!

2136
02:02:55,927 --> 02:02:56,985
What?!

2137
02:02:57,895 --> 02:03:00,989
Oh no! My sharp-shooters are so sharp!

2138
02:03:15,713 --> 02:03:18,876
You're getting married today.
But you don't look happy.

2139
02:03:20,184 --> 02:03:21,549
Of course, I'm happy.

2140
02:03:22,754 --> 02:03:24,153
Despite knowing everything...

2141
02:03:24,222 --> 02:03:25,280
...Puneet is still marrying me.

2142
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:28,688
All the guests and his
parents have arrived.

2143
02:03:30,828 --> 02:03:34,229
He'll be heart-broken if the
wedding doesn't take place.

2144
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:36,894
Why won't the wedding
take place? God forbid.

2145
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:38,600
Why are you talking like this?

2146
02:03:40,805 --> 02:03:43,899
Yes, Mr. Rangeela.
- Hello ma'am!

2147
02:03:44,175 --> 02:03:45,233
You're drunk, aren't you?

2148
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:48,172
You've been telling me for
the longest time that...

2149
02:03:48,246 --> 02:03:50,714
...you want to say something.
Why don't you tell me?

2150
02:03:52,784 --> 02:03:56,686
Towards you.

2151
02:03:56,754 --> 02:03:58,187
Happy! Talk to him.

2152
02:03:58,256 --> 02:03:59,484
God knows what's on his mind.

2153
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:05,426
Towards you.

2154
02:04:05,563 --> 02:04:09,465
Ma'am, he loves your daughter!

2155
02:04:14,205 --> 02:04:15,263
She hung up?!

2156
02:04:15,707 --> 02:04:17,937
Ma'am is just not interested!

2157
02:04:18,643 --> 02:04:20,941
Lord, help me!

2158
02:04:25,349 --> 02:04:26,577
What are you waiting for?

2159
02:04:26,718 --> 02:04:27,776
Throw him down!

2160
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:36,792
Sorry, Lucky!

2161
02:04:36,894 --> 02:04:38,953
Your time's up!

2162
02:04:57,648 --> 02:04:58,706
Hands up!

2163
02:05:03,921 --> 02:05:04,979
Now, shoot!

2164
02:05:05,456 --> 02:05:11,361
I didn't do anything.
Mika had sent me to kill you.

2165
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:26,003
It's me.
- Happy looks so depressed.

2166
02:05:42,326 --> 02:05:44,021
Oh no! - Who fired!

2167
02:05:47,365 --> 02:05:54,396
What happened? - Puneet! - Run!
Puneet! - Where's my gun?

2168
02:05:54,806 --> 02:05:56,034
Puneet!

2169
02:05:57,809 --> 02:05:58,935
What is going on here?

2170
02:06:01,512 --> 02:06:02,672
Where are you going?

2171
02:06:02,914 --> 02:06:04,973
Fools! Idiots!

2172
02:06:23,768 --> 02:06:24,826
Sonia, careful.

2173
02:06:24,936 --> 02:06:26,426
Happy! Who are these people?

2174
02:06:35,613 --> 02:06:37,843
Come!
- You fools!

2175
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:45,546
It's my daughter's wedding today!

2176
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:49,082
I'll set you right, sharp-shooter!

2177
02:06:51,996 --> 02:06:53,725
Happy! Where's Puneet?

2178
02:06:57,368 --> 02:06:58,528
Have you seen him around?

2179
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,974
Idiots!

2180
02:07:23,728 --> 02:07:24,786
Wait.

2181
02:07:39,944 --> 02:07:41,002
Okay?

2182
02:07:41,078 --> 02:07:42,136
Wait over here.

2183
02:07:42,413 --> 02:07:43,607
Don't go anywhere. Is that clear?

2184
02:07:52,423 --> 02:07:53,481
You!

2185
02:07:57,962 --> 02:07:59,020
What?!

2186
02:08:00,431 --> 02:08:01,489
What?!

2187
02:08:02,166 --> 02:08:05,795
Have the hearing aid and glasses
from Japan arrived?

2188
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:08,732
Mika. - That's my boy!

2189
02:08:10,608 --> 02:08:12,007
This marks the end of
the wedding rituals.

2190
02:08:12,076 --> 02:08:13,873
From today, you're husband and wife.

2191
02:08:15,746 --> 02:08:17,509
But you weren't the groom...

2192
02:08:17,815 --> 02:08:21,945
The wedding's over. Take
your fees and scoot!

2193
02:08:22,019 --> 02:08:23,179
Hari Om.

2194
02:08:31,195 --> 02:08:33,095
Puneet, I didn't do...

2195
02:08:34,465 --> 02:08:35,523
Sonia...

2196
02:08:36,867 --> 02:08:38,459
I was so scared of losing you...

2197
02:08:38,536 --> 02:08:40,936
...that I did everything
I could to make you mine.

2198
02:08:41,839 --> 02:08:45,673
But who can fight destiny?

2199
02:08:46,477 --> 02:08:47,876
Happy will keep you happy.

2200
02:08:52,483 --> 02:08:53,541
Wish you a happy married life!

2201
02:08:53,985 --> 02:08:55,782
He's already got a turban!

2202
02:08:58,489 --> 02:08:59,786
King, the bride is yours.

2203
02:09:00,157 --> 02:09:01,488
Congratulations!

2204
02:09:04,228 --> 02:09:06,093
Sonia, I didn't do it purposely...

2205
02:09:06,163 --> 02:09:09,064
How is it that you mess up each time?

2206
02:09:09,166 --> 02:09:10,599
Now it is done.

2207
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:12,999
You have ruined so much
in such little time.

2208
02:09:13,104 --> 02:09:14,537
Please don't be upset.

2209
02:09:14,772 --> 02:09:16,501
You may have not realized...

2210
02:09:16,574 --> 02:09:19,805
...but for the first time you've
done something right.

2211
02:09:19,877 --> 02:09:22,573
No, Sonia. I haven't done anything...

2212
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:24,680
Happy! She's agreed.

2213
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:30,978
I love you!

2214
02:09:41,732 --> 02:09:43,962
Mika! What's got into you?

2215
02:09:44,068 --> 02:09:47,265
I won't be able to become
King till you're alive.

2216
02:09:47,571 --> 02:09:49,562
Mika! Have you gone mad?
- Are you out of your mind?

2217
02:09:51,275 --> 02:09:53,641
Nobody dare stop me
from becoming King!

2218
02:09:59,683 --> 02:10:02,550
You?! - Lucky! Lucky?

2219
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:03,978
C'mon shoot!

2220
02:10:04,088 --> 02:10:06,955
Why send others
to shoot your brother?

2221
02:10:07,024 --> 02:10:08,082
Do it yourself.

2222
02:10:08,959 --> 02:10:10,756
Mika tried to kill you?!

2223
02:10:11,562 --> 02:10:12,654
Forget it.

2224
02:10:13,664 --> 02:10:16,792
It was my fault. I created a monster.

2225
02:10:17,234 --> 02:10:19,293
I was the one who gave
him his first gun.

2226
02:10:19,937 --> 02:10:21,302
God's punishing me for it.

2227
02:10:21,972 --> 02:10:25,203
He's changed everyone's
lives around you.

2228
02:10:25,309 --> 02:10:26,674
But he couldn't change you.

2229
02:10:26,777 --> 02:10:28,574
That's because neither could
you see any good...

2230
02:10:28,646 --> 02:10:30,238
...nor hear any good.

2231
02:10:30,614 --> 02:10:33,208
But you could very well see and hear!

2232
02:10:33,918 --> 02:10:36,011
Did you ever see your
blind brother's misery?

2233
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:38,611
Did you ever hear his cries for help?

2234
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:41,651
All you did, was make Guru my crutch.

2235
02:10:41,959 --> 02:10:44,120
I kept falling, groping...
like a blind man.

2236
02:10:47,198 --> 02:10:48,995
Today, even you can't stop
me from becoming King!

2237
02:10:49,333 --> 02:10:51,324
What will you gain from becoming King?

2238
02:10:51,635 --> 02:10:52,727
What will you do?

2239
02:10:53,337 --> 02:10:54,668
Look at your brother.

2240
02:10:54,939 --> 02:10:57,703
What did he ever get except hatred?

2241
02:10:57,942 --> 02:11:01,241
So much hatred, that his own
blood wants to kill him!

2242
02:11:03,347 --> 02:11:07,807
He who fights for the
poor is the real King!

2243
02:11:07,952 --> 02:11:10,352
Brave is he who strives for the poor.

2244
02:11:10,621 --> 02:11:13,715
Who suffers greatly but
never abandons the cause.

2245
02:11:13,991 --> 02:11:16,255
Go ahead and become King.

2246
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:18,988
But how will you answer the real King?

2247
02:11:19,096 --> 02:11:20,358
How will you answer God?

2248
02:11:20,898 --> 02:11:24,834
You fool, try and become a true Sikh.

2249
02:11:25,302 --> 02:11:27,361
Remember God's words.

2250
02:11:28,839 --> 02:11:31,637
Think about it, if your parents
came to know that...

2251
02:11:31,709 --> 02:11:33,643
...their one son killed the other...

2252
02:11:33,711 --> 02:11:36,373
...what will they go through?

2253
02:11:37,982 --> 02:11:40,849
Forgive me. Come here.

2254
02:11:41,018 --> 02:11:42,212
Come and hug me.

2255
02:11:44,989 --> 02:11:46,047
These glasses are like
magnifying glasses.

2256
02:11:46,257 --> 02:11:47,315
I don't need them!

2257
02:11:48,659 --> 02:11:49,956
I'm happy the way I am.

2258
02:11:53,097 --> 02:11:57,124
Let's go to Punjab and
be with our family.

2259
02:11:59,670 --> 02:12:00,728
Let's go.

2260
02:12:02,706 --> 02:12:06,335
He was blind and I used to
think he's staring at me!

2261
02:12:07,411 --> 02:12:08,673
I'm such a fool.

2262
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,738
What happened to this ear?

2263
02:12:11,782 --> 02:12:13,306
He can't even hear anything.

2264
02:12:14,418 --> 02:12:15,680
And I kept blabbering away!

2265
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:19,116
Why don't you come to Punjab as well?

2266
02:12:23,227 --> 02:12:24,285
Yo, what up?

2267
02:12:24,361 --> 02:12:25,419
This is big Snoop Dogg.

2268
02:12:25,729 --> 02:12:27,253
Represent that Punjabi.

2269
02:12:27,898 --> 02:12:30,890
Aye, hit them with this!

2270
02:12:34,071 --> 02:12:37,939
RDB, DPGC.

2271
02:12:38,709 --> 02:12:42,736
Akshay and Snoop D O double G.

2272
02:12:43,347 --> 02:12:44,712
Oh yeah, Singh is King...

2273
02:12:44,782 --> 02:12:46,181
...this is the thing.

2274
02:12:46,383 --> 02:12:47,975
Do you know what I mean? Follow me!

2275
02:12:48,052 --> 02:12:50,077
Listen to me for a second, check it!

2276
02:12:50,454 --> 02:12:51,716
Singh in the King.

2277
02:12:51,855 --> 02:12:52,913
Check the record.

2278
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:55,115
Friendship means the life to us.

Our pride is extraordinary.

2280
02:12:57,795 --> 02:12:59,990
Laughter is our identity.

2281
02:13:00,231 --> 02:13:02,461
That's why, everybody says...

2282
02:13:02,733 --> 02:13:04,792
Friendship means the life to us.

02:13:05,069 --> 02:13:07,128
Our pride is extraordinary.

2284
02:13:07,338 --> 02:13:09,329
Laughter is our identity.

2285

C'mon everybody, say!

2286
02:13:11,842 --> 02:13:15,278

Snoop D O double G, the
life of the party.

2296
02:13:35,899 --> 02:13:38,197
Lay back, stay back,
I'm in the Mayback.

2297
02:13:38,302 --> 02:13:40,862
This isn't James Brown, but
it's the big payback.

2298
02:13:40,971 --> 02:13:42,939
Watch me zoom by, make it boom by.

2299
02:13:43,274 --> 02:13:45,367
What's up? To all the ladies
hanging out in Mumbai!

2300
02:13:45,509 --> 02:13:47,773
Cheese make dollars, East-west
masala (spice).

Singh is the King, so you
all have to follow.

What's up, what's up, what's up.

2303
02:13:53,784 --> 02:13:55,843
I'm trying to stack my butter.

2304
02:13:56,153 --> 02:13:58,178
What's up, what's up, what's up.

2305

The Singhs hold their bravery
in high-esteem.

02:14:59,917 --> 02:15:02,317
They're willing to lay down
their lives for the same.

2330
02:15:02,419 --> 02:15:04,580
The Kings and the emperors
salute their bravery.

2331
02:15:04,855 --> 02:15:07,119
The Singhs' pride lies
in their turbans.

The Singhs who've laid
down their lives...

2345
02:15:51,568 --> 02:15:53,160

02:16:00,544 --> 02:16:03,206
Diamonds on my fingers,
