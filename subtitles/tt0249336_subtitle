1
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,804
Emperor of comedy who gave comedy
to the world like nectar,

2
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:33,311
your memory is imbibed forever
in the smiles of Telugu people,

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,814
this film 'Aha Naa Pellanta'
is dedicated to you with love.

4
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,331
Though prices are
shooting up every day,

5
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,598
l'm offering you coconut
every day without fail,

6
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,703
but you're unfair to me,

7
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:40,870
today if you show a proposal
which l will like,

8
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:43,038
only then l'll offer you a coconut,

9
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:45,874
if not l'll use it for making chutney,

10
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:47,713
is this deal okay to you, God?

11
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:54,220
Name of this man who has a deal
with God himself is Ananda Rao,

12
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:56,385
He's very famous in the
twin districts of Godavari.

13
00:01:56,563 --> 00:02:00,522
Not as a doctor but after seeing over
200 marriage proposals for his nephew,

14
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,861
he has a different style in
assessing marriage proposals,

15
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:03,866
watch it now!

16
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:06,733
What would you like to
have, brother-in-law?

17
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:08,033
lf everything is okay,
he'll have betel leaves,

18
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,903
if not he'll take all expenses.

19
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:12,567
He's Narayana Pantulu,

20
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:14,907
if Ananda Rao is famous
for seeing so many proposals,

21
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:17,072
Narayana is famous for showing
him so many proposals,

22
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,911
he's the main character of this story.

23
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:21,076
She's my wife and she'll greet you now.

24
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,582
Greetings.
- He's my brother.- Greetings.

25
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,418
She's his wife.
- Greetings.

26
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,253
And she is...
- You shut up!

27
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:30,585
Please call my driver standing outside.
- Why?

28
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:32,561
l want to introduce him.

29
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,895
l didn't get you.
- l got it. Bring the girl.

30
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:42,405
l'm not saying because she's my daughter,

31
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:44,236
though she looks like Simran,

32
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:45,935
but she's Savithri in traditions.

33
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:50,105
He named her as Gayathri
and that's their history.- Well said.

34
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:52,778
She's good.

35
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:55,945
She'll become Goddess of wealth
if you say okay.- That's my worry.

36
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:56,781
What's this brother-in-law?

37
00:02:56,957 --> 00:03:01,291
She's a angel, l can't ruin her life by
fixing her marriage with a rogue.

38
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:02,951
What are you saying, brother-in-law?

39
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,587
l'll tell you about my boy in short.

40
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:10,429
He brushes teeth with Beer,
and takes bath in bar,

41
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:14,262
entire day he's with goons
and with girls at night,

42
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:19,435
recently dating come here,
he said he's trying that too.

43
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:23,639
l can't fix your daughter
for him and ruin her life.

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,811
You must forgive me.

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,812
lf you're so open,
it won't be nice if l'm don't open.

46
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,482
You said about your family in short.

47
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,993
l want to tell you about
my family shorter than you.

48
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:40,297
l've two sons along with a daughter.

49
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:43,459
They come home once in
a while for festivals.

50
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,138
Are they working and living in city?

51
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:49,833
No, they murder people
and live in jails.

52
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:57,673
To tell you the truth they can't sleep
in 5 star hotel too except in jail.

53
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,351
Next to tell about my daughter,

54
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:04,513
if your boy smokes,
my daughter drinks rum,

55
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:08,691
if your boy roams with goon,
my daughter roams with boys,

56
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:13,329
maintaining accounts with
Orkut, Twitter, Facebook,

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,991
trust me she's always chatting,

58
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,698
may l tell you another thing
which can make you feel proud,

59
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:25,877
that my daughter will drink
two pegs more than your boy,

60
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,310
l assure you as her father.

61
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,372
But she's sitting like
an innocent wax doll.

62
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,040
lt's all set up!

63
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:45,354
Did you see how stylish she's like
Mumaith Khan removing the veil?

64
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:47,526
Good!

65
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,032
l think it's better to stay out.

66
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:51,367
Astrologer!

67
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,071
l asked for a Seetha for
my Lord Rama like boy,

68
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:01,577
how dare you show me a Silk Smitha!
l'll kill you!

69
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:07,243
Family of my boy's wife must have any
connection to goons for seven generations.

70
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,081
What do you think of my nephew? Come!

71
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:13,021
Wear the sari...we're making her
wear sari, she'll look beautiful.

72
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,576
So using this software,

73
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:34,941
we can stop pirated software, CD's
and DVD's reaching market.

74
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:51,362
Subbu, you're doing the wrong thing.
- What did l do sir?

75
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:53,756
lf you sell the same product
to any American company,

76
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:54,797
you can become a millionaire.

77
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:58,802
l like my product to be made in lndia
than becoming a millionaire.

78
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,436
His name is Balaraju,

79
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,807
he's manager of the company
in which our hero works,

80
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,812
he's so busy that...

81
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,473
l don't have the time to
tell you my phone number,

82
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:13,812
l'll give my peon's number
if you want, note it down,

83
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,648
call him and get my number.

84
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:21,984
What's it? l don't have time
to talk to you, l'm not free.

85
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:24,289
Your land is also not free,
somebody has occupied it.

86
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,465
Let him occupy it.
No time to talk to him also.

87
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,628
lf it's necessary, ask him to come here.
You know l'm very busy.

88
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:35,168
Our busy Balaraju is throwing
a party to entire office staff,

89
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,002
make a guess.

90
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,478
You come to office an hour late,

91
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,511
but you came two hours
early to the party, why?

92
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:45,507
What will we have if we come early?
- Drinks.

93
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,347
What will we have if come late?
- Same drinks.

94
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,187
He's already finished.

95
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:53,522
Who is he?
- My friend.

96
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,355
Your friend?- Who is he then?
- His friend.

97
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,186
Your friend?

98
00:06:58,331 --> 00:06:58,990
One who gave party is finished.

99
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,655
Then who is he?
- By the way who are you man?

100
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,665
Who am l? Tell him...

101
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:04,666
He's the man who is
throwing this party.

102
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:07,169
ls it you?
You please sit here sir.

103
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,867
Please come and sit here sir.

104
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:14,536
How dare you ask me who am l
one who is giving the party!

105
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:20,216
Who is he drinking,
eating and faltering? Your friend?

106
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,219
Why did you call your friends only,
why not your entire colony?

107
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,880
Good idea.
- l tried sir, no time.

108
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,549
Few people went out of
station without information.

109
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,890
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
l would've postponed the party.

110
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:34,591
Entire colony would've descended
here and cleaned the bar.

111
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:37,696
They missed it sir. Do you know why
l'm giving this party?- For drinks!

112
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:38,898
Shut up!

113
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:39,902
l don't know sir.
- Do you know?

114
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,234
Who wants to know it?
- Do you at least know it?

115
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,468
What?
- You too don't know.

116
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:50,910
lt's better to offer Subbu a Pepsi
instead of giving you a party.

117
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:58,413
Subbu is here!
He's coming great like a full bottle.

118
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:08,723
Though l'm very busy, nobody here
knows why l'm giving this party.

119
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,232
You at least tell them.

120
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:14,733
Balaraju is leaving his 40 year old
bachelor's life to this bar.

121
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,408
ls he giving up worldly life?

122
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,443
No, he's going to marry.
- Who is giving him a bride?

123
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:23,446
Though somebody is giving him bride,
he's giving us a party, right?

124
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,451
You too have a peg.
- No sir.

125
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,782
Please come here.
- No sir...

126
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:33,619
lf you don't drink, it's sworn on me.
- Take it, Subbu.

127
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,319
Saturday evening gathering in pub...

128
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:18,558
Monday to Friday we worked hard
and turned mad...

129
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:31,568
Let's relax and get recharged...

130
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:43,586
Let anyone say anything,
the world is ours...

131
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:46,088
Culture which shows the right path...

132
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,819
lf not you'll face the heat...

133
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,439
Everything is open...

134
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:26,090
Let's rock it...

135
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,938
Oh l'm getting married...

136
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,633
Not their marriage...

137
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:06,358
Who are you?
- Who are you?

138
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:27,741
Leave it!

139
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,393
That's my pant!

140
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,891
Who the hell are you?

141
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,561
You're in my flat
so l should ask you that.

142
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,070
By the way, who are you?

143
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,265
How could l come to your flat
without knowing you?

144
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,608
Why did you kidnap me and
what have you done with me?

145
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:54,769
Kidnap? l'm not worth that much.

146
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:56,946
Where is my dress?

147
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:59,277
Try to remember, were you
wearing clothes last night?

148
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:00,441
l'll beat you with slippers.

149
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,781
Look there! l think that's your dress.

150
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,756
How did it get tear?
- How did it happen?

151
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:13,861
You did something with me.

152
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:21,096
Don't cry...please don't dry.

153
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:25,107
l too don't know what had
happened last night. Trust me.

154
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:29,312
Excuse me...please don't cry.

155
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,812
Why is she coming at me like
Aghora of film 'Arundhati'?

156
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:41,157
Please trust me.

157
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,158
l don't know how your clothes got tear,

158
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,288
if you want, l'll mend it.
lf you insist, l'll buy you new dress.

159
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,799
But please don't manhandle me.
l beg you.

160
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:01,170
Father, please forgive me.
l committed a sin!

161
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,508
What's this madness!
Stop!

162
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,839
Please listen to me.

163
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:10,344
Stop l say! lf you die committing sin,
l'll get lynched by police.

164
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,616
Come...come l say!

165
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,169
What?

166
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:35,039
My visiting card.
- Why?

167
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:36,203
l like!

168
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:37,709
Are you crazy?

169
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,048
l like this dress very much
and sentimental about it too.

170
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,208
To return it to me.

171
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:44,719
What again now?

172
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,381
Can you give me your phone number?
- Why?

173
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,391
lf you forget about the dress,
l'll call to remind you.

174
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:51,553
l'll not give.
- No please...

175
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,202
Where did you vanish from
last night's party?

176
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:01,570
Who is she?

177
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,034
Some crazy girl.

178
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:09,005
l mean building a mental hospital,
seeking donation.

179
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,243
Did you give?
- l did.

180
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,908
Then, why are you still talking
to her on road?

181
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:18,420
Useless lazy people are living happily
by collecting donations.

182
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:27,995
lsn't the girl beautiful?
- Yes.

183
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:30,224
No...no...

184
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:32,597
What's the confusion?
What happened to you?

185
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:34,433
That's what l'm also confused about!

186
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:36,768
Something is wrong with you.

187
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,771
l've to go for shopping.

188
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:45,606
Good morning sir.

189
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:52,785
Who dropped me home last night?
- Didn't you drop me home then?

190
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,621
Not yet out of hangover!
- Why should one drink then?

191
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,468
Why don't you answer me? Gone deaf!
- Mind blocked!

192
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,469
What happened?
- Nothing.

193
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,108
Your nothing says something had happened,
tell me what had happened?

194
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:11,971
Nothing happened, sir? Trust me.

195
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:16,480
l can make cock to lay eggs,
can't l make you sing the truth?

196
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:20,983
Always speaks about chicken and eggs,
were you working in poultry farm earlier?

197
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,814
One slap and you'll end up
as chicken 65.

198
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:25,479
Why are you arguing with him?
He's still in hangover. Come with me.

199
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:30,489
Nothing sir, last night a girl...
- Did you hook up with any girl?

200
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:31,652
She came.

201
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:33,625
Did she? What did you do with her?

202
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,630
l don't remember sir.
- What did the girl do with you then?

203
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,132
l don't remember that too, sir.

204
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,136
Neither you remember what you did
nor what she did with you.

205
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:44,003
Did you enjoy so much then, boy?
You're very lucky!

206
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:46,304
Till now l saw only comedy angle in you,

207
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:48,844
l'm seeing the romantic angle
in you for the first time.

208
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:51,847
l shouldn't say this but
you're very lucky.

209
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,507
l wish l too had it.

210
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,677
l would be saved from wearing
these lousy wigs.

211
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,749
Baby girl or baby boy?
- lt's boy!

212
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:34,048
Whose features he has?
- His dad's!

213
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:37,890
What are you saying?
- About what you were talking to me.

214
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:38,893
Nothing of that sort.

215
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:41,864
Are you testing for pregnancy
without anything happened?

216
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:42,864
Don't shout!

217
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:45,560
How long this affair is going on,
and how and when did it happen?

218
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,365
Please tell me, how did it happen?

219
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:53,067
lt happened last night!
- Last night?

220
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:55,244
l'm tensed.

221
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:00,241
Would l get pregnant in
one night stand?

222
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,747
l've been asking you leave for two days,
why not grant me sir?

223
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:05,516
No time, am l sitting free here?

224
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,421
Sir, he's the man who has
occupied your land.

225
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,395
Will you occupy my land
because l'm busy?

226
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,057
l don't have time to forgive you also,
leave my land immediately.

227
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,896
l too don't have time
to leave your land.

228
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,403
Are you busier than me?

229
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:25,167
Stop for a moment!

230
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:28,212
Where are you going now?
- Your dad's place!

231
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,439
lt's Miyapur not your dad's place.

232
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:34,279
l don't have time to lodge complaint
against you with police,

233
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,945
there's police station on your way,
lodge a complaint against yourself.

234
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:42,624
Sir, l forgot to tell you,

235
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,285
there's someone here to meet you.
Wants to meet you.

236
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,761
l don't have time,
tell them l'm very busy.

237
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:50,265
Not for you but for our Subrahmanyam.

238
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:52,426
For me?
- Yes sir.

239
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:53,434
Who is it?

240
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:54,628
lt seems you know them.

241
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:55,967
Waiting on terrace,
wants you to come there.

242
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,097
Shall l also join you?

243
00:19:57,276 --> 00:20:00,439
You're busy, aren't you sir?
So be busy.

244
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,598
You said l know you in reception,
but l don't know who you are!

245
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,343
Will you beat me for saying
l don't know you are?

246
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,852
Why are you beating a single man?

247
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,358
l beg you sir, please leave me.

248
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,375
You please tell them sir,
you appear to be a good man.

249
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:18,216
Am l hanging any bill board
on face that l'm a good man?

250
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:22,386
He's the right man!

251
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,320
Start the discussion.

252
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,023
What do you mean by discussion, sir?

253
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,737
Will you beat anyone for failing
to recognise you?

254
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,205
Why are you getting serious?

255
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,537
How could you see seriousness
in this comic face?

256
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:41,576
Sir, at least you tell me.

257
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:43,738
We'll leave you, if you play a game.

258
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,248
That too only if you win.
- l can play dice game very well.

259
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:49,410
Am l running any eunuch
company to play dice game?

260
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:50,748
My company is different.

261
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,754
Do you know to play
singing song with last word?- l know sir.

262
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:55,587
Then start!
- That is...that is...- Sing l say!

263
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,422
Pain...pain...heart is in pain...

264
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,725
She pinches me all over...

265
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:05,761
She squeezes my nerves...
and makes me fall in love...

266
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,064
Sir last word is 'Tha'.

267
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:12,267
Thillana...thillana...
my innocent eyed beauty...

268
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,773
There's a super singer in you sir.
- Shut up!

269
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,115
Sing the next song.
- What was the last word sir?

270
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:22,446
Boys, scratch his memory.

271
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:26,955
Na'...l was born...this world laughed...

272
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,959
l laughed...this world cried...

273
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:33,257
Who the hell bothers about this world?

274
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:41,103
You're a flower that withers,
why do you want to sing songs?

275
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:46,301
The gardener is not with you...

276
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:52,475
Oh falling night sky,
why do you need colourful horizon?

277
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:58,146
The world has turned dark long back...

278
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:03,158
This night will never break into a dawn...

279
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:05,296
This is wrong game,
how can l sing from middle?

280
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:08,295
Shut up! Start from where ever l end.

281
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:17,466
lf you want the world to change,
it's you who must change...

282
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:19,167
Brother! Shall l finish him?

283
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:22,006
ls it any film song?
- Yes. Song from new film.

284
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,014
We didn't watch it.
- ls it my mistake sir?

285
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,014
l got it sir.

286
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:27,345
You're not beating me
for not knowing you sir,

287
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,851
you're beating me to know
something from me. What's it sir?

288
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:33,185
You're very smart boy! Come!

289
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,997
Take it out!

290
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:42,489
Oh God, knife!
Please don't kill me, sir.

291
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:54,145
Do you know him?

292
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:55,706
Who is he, sir?

293
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:59,373
My father, Godfather to 100 villages!

294
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:02,384
Great man! Appears to be living!

295
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:04,715
But l'm sorry he's no more with us.

296
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,881
The photo is effusing life, sir.

297
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:11,488
l'll wring your neck!
My father is still alive!

298
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,195
Do you know who they are?

299
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,203
Great! As if showing senior NTR's
photo and asking who is he?

300
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:24,536
Are you praising me?
Tell me clearly who they are?

301
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,604
You three, sir.

302
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,743
Do you know who she is?

303
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,410
l don't know sir.
- Bloody rogue!

304
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:40,414
Tell me.- Know her but don't know
how l know her.

305
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:42,753
She's our sister.

306
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:45,726
l didn't do anything with her.
l swear on you, sir.

307
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,946
lt's not wrong to fall
in love with girls.

308
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,778
But cheating them with
your sweet talk is wrong.

309
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:11,116
You know your mistake very well.
Marry my sister!

310
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,781
Please listen to me, sir
l haven't done any mistake.

311
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:18,625
Start reverse discussion with him.

312
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:31,607
Pull me up sir.
Please leave me sir.

313
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:33,975
Leave me sir!

314
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:36,706
lt seems he'll go down to buy
chocolates, leave him boys.

315
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:38,813
Leave me doesn't drop me down.

316
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:42,818
l beg you sir, please don't leave my legs.
Don't leave me sir.

317
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:45,479
l'll be at your feet only.
l'll do whatever you say.

318
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:49,991
You've been seeing everything straight,
why not see upside down for change?

319
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:53,620
l beg all three of you,
please pull me up sir.

320
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,996
l'm feeling giddy.
- Feeling giddy? Pull him up!

321
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:00,168
Go!

322
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,000
Bloody front benchers!

323
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:13,010
Why isn't anyone answering me?
l'm a very busy man.

324
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:18,020
lt seems he's very busy man,
start discussion, he'll leave quickly.

325
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:43,878
Brother, you read it.

326
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,374
What it says...

327
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:53,388
l told them to study while in school
but they spent time fighting others, fools.

328
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:57,217
Both are illiterates!

329
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:00,030
Hey short man! You read it.

330
00:27:00,198 --> 00:27:02,063
l'm Balaraju not short man!

331
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,361
Are you pumpkin Balaraju?
- How do you know it sir?

332
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:08,233
Your face is like pumpkin
with eyes, ears and nose.

333
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:11,069
That's why you called me like that sir.
- Read it!

334
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,471
Were you trying to read it like this?

335
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,414
Due to the circumstances,

336
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:22,576
September 2, 2010, within the police
station limits of Madhapur,

337
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,585
that night l, known as Subbu,

338
00:27:26,591 --> 00:27:28,422
because l'm blamed for a mistake,

339
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:31,426
according to the amended
lndian penal code...- Stop it!

340
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,732
Are you reading it like
supreme court judgement?

341
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,095
Give the paper to him.
Write whatever l say.

342
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:39,726
For the mistake committed on my sister,

343
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:43,432
and accepting you're entirely
responsible for it, and sign it.

344
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:44,906
l didn't commit any mistake, sir.

345
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,101
Shall we start again the song game?

346
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:49,111
Song game...no please.

347
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,280
Why are you laughing pumpkin?

348
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:58,446
l feel like laughing looking
at your innocence, sir.

349
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,784
Signature on stamped paper is
not valid without witness signature.

350
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,290
Days are changed.

351
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:06,256
You've good experience.
- Yes.

352
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,127
You sign as witness.
- Me?

353
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:11,758
Why did you give him an idea?
Can't you keep shut?

354
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:16,465
Sign it!- My mother said to stand guaranty
but never sign any paper.

355
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,633
Give me a gun!
- Give me a pen!

356
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:22,311
From now onwards Subbu is our man,

357
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:25,814
if he steps outside without
our permission.
- You'll cut the legs!

358
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,317
You're very sharp!
- Your discussion was that good!

359
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:36,658
You want us to take your head?

360
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,461
What's this sir?
Have you become their covert?

361
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:47,628
What to do? l got angry
seeing them beating you.

362
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:48,465
Later l got scared.

363
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,336
Then l was astonished.
- l feel pity seeing you.

364
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:52,871
My fate!

365
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,781
Why are you like a dressed chicken?

366
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:04,849
How long were you here?
- Just now an hour back.

367
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,520
So, you've seen the entire scene.

368
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,524
l didn't see anything, you going
inside and falling on their feet,

369
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:11,992
and they kicking you,
and dressing you up,

370
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:13,755
l didn't see anything sir.

371
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,159
So, you've seen everything.

372
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:20,498
You'll not tell anyone about this, right?
- lf l don't you may feel bad, right?

373
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:21,995
Have you decided like that?

374
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:25,199
l think you requested for leave, right?
- Tomorrow would be better.

375
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:29,036
Not just tomorrow, take four days off.
Take it.

376
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,879
That's him!

377
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:43,053
Who?

378
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:44,558
l told you about, right?

379
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:53,026
He looks like Andhra Amitabh
but little comical face.

380
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:03,242
Your brothers are huge but have no brains.
- What happened?

381
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:05,747
Though i said nothing happened,
they flogged me like a dog.

382
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,908
l may need few weeks
for the wounds to heal.

383
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,577
Then they're not my brothers.
- What makes you so confident?

384
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:14,748
lf my brothers beat you need
few months to heal not just weeks.

385
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:17,254
lf they had beat you...

386
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,898
l'm not here to know from you,
if l'm lucky or not.

387
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,057
He said they'll talk to your
father about our marriage.

388
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:24,257
With father?!

389
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:39,447
She fell in love with a man
and got cheated, sir.

390
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:45,614
When l asked him to marry her,
he refuses and tells me to go to hell.

391
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,950
Who is he?

392
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,950
Sl of the neighbouring police station.

393
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:53,321
You want marriage or life.
- Marriage sir.

394
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,229
Sir, tell me sir.

395
00:30:56,935 --> 00:31:03,636
l must see fear of death in the
eyes of Sl if he refuses to marry.- Okay sir.

396
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:05,102
Bye sir.

397
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,654
Durga, let's play a game.
- Okay father.

398
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:36,964
When you play chess, your mind should
also be alert along with your hands.

399
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:38,507
What happened to you?

400
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:41,835
Father, l don't know how to
break the news to you.

401
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,004
What happened?

402
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:47,181
That is...it seems someone loves sister.

403
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:49,843
You're telling me about this
after killing him, right?

404
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:51,181
Sir!

405
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:52,687
Take the vehicle.

406
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:57,851
l did go to kill him, father.
But l came to know sister too loves him.

407
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:03,657
l wanted to celebrate her marriage
so grandly to rock entire district.

408
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:05,166
How did this happen?

409
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,168
What has happened now?
- What the hell are you saying son?

410
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:13,538
Yes father, you promised then to get married
to the man who cheated her,

411
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:16,704
but when l said sister loves him,
you're ordering to kill him,

412
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:18,781
is it justice, father?

413
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:23,051
Father, you always said one thing,
do you remember it?

414
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:29,554
No woman in land of Warangal must
shed a tear till we're alive.

415
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:34,028
lf you say no to this marriage,
it'll happen in our home.

416
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,690
The boy is very good,
we too like him, father.

417
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,734
l must approve him first!
bring him here, l'll talk to him.

418
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,402
lf anything goes wrong,
you'll not only lose our family honour,

419
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,741
but your father's life too.

420
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:17,071
Looks like he's putting on weight behind,
he's cutting our calls.

421
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:20,605
Call Balaraju, you can get hold of him.
- You're right!

422
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:38,126
l'm busy Balaraju here,
who are you?

423
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:41,754
Are you a beast from jungle?
Can't even say a hello properly.

424
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:44,265
ls it you sir? Greetings sir.

425
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:46,266
l lifted it stylishly
without knowing it was you sir.

426
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:49,406
Style? lt won't suit your face.

427
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:50,805
You're right sir.

428
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:54,469
Why is your friend cutting my phone calls?

429
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:56,307
l mean i don't know sir.

430
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:59,211
lt's okay if he answers my call now,

431
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:03,644
if not your pumpkin will get
a good stylish discussion.

432
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:07,485
No need of discussion for such a small thing.
He's in office only.

433
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,820
Give the phone to him.

434
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,964
Tell him l'm not here.
- Take it.

435
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,128
Why are you not answering my calls?

436
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,668
That is...l lost my phone.

437
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:23,968
lf you lie to me like this,
you'll get lost not your phone.

438
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:25,234
Stop acting smart with me.

439
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:30,671
l told about you to my father,
he ordered to kill you,

440
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:35,847
don't worry,
l managed to change his mind,

441
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:40,513
my father wants to meet you,
come to Warangal.

442
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,521
l'll come sir.
- Okay, bye.

443
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,831
What did he say?
- He wants me to come to Warangal.

444
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:48,329
Go, it'll be over.

445
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,831
lf l go, they'll force marriage on me sir.

446
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:51,532
Marriage?

447
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:53,997
Will you marry her if they ask you?

448
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:56,163
Come, let's go to the police station.
Let's lodge a complaint.

449
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,332
No use.
- Why?

450
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:00,875
Not just policemen, if necessary
they'll buy police station too.

451
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:02,171
Sorry, they'll occupy it.

452
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,543
Are you here?
l've been searching for you.

453
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:06,547
They called again for you.

454
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:09,050
Can't you tell them l'm not
here if they call you?

455
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,380
They threatened to kill me.

456
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:13,387
They've hooked on to me
like computer virus.

457
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:14,718
Aren't hooked up with their sister?

458
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,892
They were not with me,
but you know me very well, right?

459
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,360
l wasn't with you then.

460
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:22,693
The situation synced like that.

461
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,567
Will Osama keep quiet
he gets hold of a bomb?

462
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,728
lf you give your tuft in his hands,
won't he pull it?

463
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,568
You've to endure the pain.
- Can't we do anything about it?

464
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,901
You can have as many hairstyles
as possible if you've thick hair.

465
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:37,411
lf you've a plan,
you can escape at any cost.

466
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,739
What's it?

467
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:44,252
Vanish for week to somewhere,
come back after everything settles down.

468
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:38,037
You had great time last night, right?

469
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:42,644
Look there!

470
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:47,811
Aren't they like angels?
l suspect l'm the King of heaven.

471
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,313
No doubt it's him.

472
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:53,981
By any chance he knows we're here.
- Why are you afraid?

473
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:57,650
ls it Hyderabad? This is Goa,
what the hell can he do here?

474
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:00,798
He can't even pluck a hair strand from wig.
Give me the phone.

475
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:08,135
Why are they so helpful?

476
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:13,007
Talk to him, bloody.
- l'm not bloody but Bala.

477
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:16,844
Talk to him.

478
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,674
ls there any new Warangal in Goa?

479
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:22,342
l asked you to come here
but you've gone to Goa.

480
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,011
l mean Goa has a beach, right?

481
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:31,219
Wherever you may on this earth,
my shadow will reach there before you.

482
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:36,493
Take away from your mind
of escaping from me.

483
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:38,760
Did you see the African before you?

484
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:45,506
He'll cut you into pieces
and feed it to fishes.

485
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,874
Give the phone to pumpkin Balaraju.

486
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:52,038
lt seems he wants to talk to you.
- With me?

487
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:52,545
Talk to him.

488
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,888
l told you the style will
not suit your face.

489
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:04,718
Pumpkin, looks like you're
great time in Goa.

490
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:09,291
There's a white woman before
you in the beach,

491
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,527
do you like her?
- l like her very much.

492
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:17,367
l'm sure she would also like me.
She's staring at me.

493
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,908
Wear a loincloth, you're not that worth,

494
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:22,740
she's my henchwoman.
- Your henchwoman?

495
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,747
Shall l kill him, boss?
Shall l kill him?

496
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:32,412
Pack them to Hyderabad.

497
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,922
Okay, l've booked a flight.

498
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:38,927
Come, if not they may kill us.

499
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:41,395
l expected this African would help
but he's threatening us.

500
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:45,058
lf you say African, l'll kill you, go.
- Come sir.

501
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:53,567
What ever it is, l'm happy flying
in a private flight for the first time.

502
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,114
Why are you flying the plane
in drunken state?

503
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:04,948
Are we driving car on Hyderabad roads?
Flying a plane.

504
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,956
Just taking off and landing,
it'll do the rest on it's own.

505
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:10,959
You're right sir,
to tell you the truth,

506
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:15,490
flight journey is fantastic
compared to bus or train.

507
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,098
l've a doubt.

508
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,430
How long it'll take to reach Hyderabad?

509
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:24,268
Nothing much, before we get introduce
ourselves, we'll be in Hyderabad.

510
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:25,306
ls it?
- That's all.

511
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:28,310
l'm Subbu and he's Balaraju.
- l'm busy Balaraju.

512
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,141
My name is lyer.
- lyer?

513
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:54,628
Little long but fantastic!

514
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,636
No, still there!
- Still there?

515
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:06,180
Your name is great!

516
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:10,852
Not just Hyderabad, we can go to America
before you tell your full name.

517
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:15,186
Sir, this is not full name,
it's just my pet name.

518
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:19,026
Pet name? Full name is different?

519
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,095
What's your name sir?

520
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,157
Don't worry, l'll manage.

521
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:28,669
You're always flying in sky, right?
Did you ever see the Sun?

522
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:30,500
Many a times, you can find it
somewhere here only.

523
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:31,505
What about moon then?

524
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:36,204
Moon...moon...
- What happened sir?

525
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,541
Don't ask me about the moon sir?
- Why?

526
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:43,710
While l was a toddler,
my mother fed me showing moon,

527
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:46,880
and called the moon,
but it never came,

528
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:51,222
my mother felt bad and l was hurt,
and then l became a pilot,

529
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:53,863
l've been searching for
20 long years now,

530
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,898
but l do meet the Sun every day,

531
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,832
if l see the moon...
- Calm down sir.

532
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:04,371
Calm down sir.- l'll manage him.
- How?

533
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:05,903
l'll divert him with music.

534
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:12,744
Come moon...
- He'll never come.

535
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:15,408
l've been waiting here for 20 years,
he'll not come.

536
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:21,248
Come moon...come lunar...

537
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:22,756
Sir, you please don't get excited.

538
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,919
Why are only moon songs being played?
Change the channel.

539
00:41:26,097 --> 00:41:28,224
We are running bad time,
today is full moon day.

540
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,060
You try this time.
- Me?

541
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:38,569
You're a crescent moon...
- He'll never come sir.

542
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:41,940
Call him in any language Hindi, Tamil,
or Malayalam, he'll not come.

543
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:43,944
You come here.
- Where?

544
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:48,449
Keep this.
- How can you fly the plane?- l'm hurt sir..

545
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:55,448
Why are you holding it like
an experienced pilot?

546
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:57,457
He told me hold it.
- Will you if he says so?

547
00:41:57,628 --> 00:41:59,118
You shouldn't hold whatever he says.

548
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,428
Oh no! He's drinking again.
- Shall we ask few pegs?

549
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:08,264
We're heading towards hills,
what shall we do now?00 42

550
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:11,772
We'll go over it in seconds.
- You're responsible for it.

551
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:17,645
Don't hit...

552
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:22,145
He got drunk and fell down.
What shall we do now?

553
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:25,486
We're hitting the hills,
l'll turn this!

554
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:30,816
Wait...wait...

555
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,624
ls there anybody there?
Can you hear our plight?

556
00:42:37,802 --> 00:42:39,633
l can hear it.
- Not you...

557
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:44,505
Nobody is hearing us.

558
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,670
Anybody there?
- Anybody there?

559
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:55,683
Greetings, my name is DK Bose.

560
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:58,014
People call me as Bose DK too.

561
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:02,853
Welcome to Hyderabad flying club!
- What bloody welcome?

562
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:04,517
We're dying here.

563
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:07,823
Your voice is good.
- Good voice? Shall l sing a song?

564
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,160
No need, just tell me your problem.

565
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:11,494
Give me.

566
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:16,037
We're in a private plane and
pilot got drunk and fell down.

567
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:18,198
Who is flying the flight now?

568
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:19,206
lt's me!

569
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:21,675
Who is this me?

570
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:23,040
l'm Subbu!

571
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:26,547
Look, Subbu Subbu Subbu.
- Just one Subbu only sir.

572
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:28,548
Look just one Subbu only!

573
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,882
Do you've any experience
of flying a flight?

574
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:33,546
What bloody experience!

575
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:36,386
He doesn't know anything,
pilot fell down getting drunk.

576
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,221
Please get us down, l beg you sir.

577
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:44,057
Before you get down, you must know
few important things,

578
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:49,229
to know how to land the flight,
you must know how it takes off,

579
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:52,706
and then you must know
how to fly after it takes off,

580
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:56,404
before that you must know
what a flight really is!

581
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,916
Generally this private plane
weighs 20 tons and 200 grams.

582
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:08,419
it has two engines,
two propellers, and two fans.

583
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:12,688
Bloody rogue! l think you'll kill us.
Just tell us how to land it.

584
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:16,897
To land the flight,
there are two emergency doors,

585
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:21,401
the third is in the cockpit,
l'm here to tell you this.

586
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:26,604
Now you watch ahead!

587
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:32,108
Tell me what do you see?

588
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:33,614
We can see death!

589
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:41,850
No, before your death,
can you see a round thing?

590
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:44,625
Yes, there is.

591
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:49,255
There's red button next to it.
- l've pressed it.

592
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,503
You mustn't press it, if you do,
the main engine will stop.

593
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:57,130
Why did you press it without
hearing him fully?

594
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:58,605
How dare you hit the manager!

595
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:01,643
We're dying in minutes now,
who bothers about manager or employee.

596
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:05,638
Though main engine stops,
the second engine will start.

597
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:09,642
Start is the name of the company.

598
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:12,983
Very good company.

599
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:18,322
But not even the company can
guaranty when it'll shut down.

600
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:22,398
But we'll die surely.
- Look sir, a hoarding!

601
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,469
l beg you, please guide us to land.

602
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:36,507
Please tell me where the needle
is in your petrol indication meter.

603
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,514
lt's showing red signal sir.

604
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:46,019
lt means you're running out of petrol.
- No petrol?

605
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,353
Shouldn't you check the petrol?
- Why are you beating your employee?

606
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:51,518
We're dying now, who bothers about that!

607
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:53,822
You wait, what should we do now sir?

608
00:45:53,998 --> 00:45:57,195
Which direction you're heading?
- Without any direction.

609
00:45:57,334 --> 00:46:00,667
Then repeat whatever l say
without missing any word.

610
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:01,770
Go ahead.

611
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:04,538
O God!
- O God!

612
00:46:04,675 --> 00:46:07,542
Hail Lord Venkatesha!
- Hail Lord Venkatesha!

613
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:12,546
lf we had committed any sin,
please forgive us.

614
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:15,207
lf we had committed any sin,
please forgive us.

615
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:18,378
Please show mercy and take us to you.

616
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:22,048
Please show mercy and take us to you.
We don't want to die!

617
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:29,359
Whether you agree or nor,
death is inevitable to all men.

618
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:35,233
Because death is the ultimate truth,
nobody can escape from it.

619
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:39,035
l'm not saying this, many epics tell us.

620
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:44,579
Humans can't know how death
nears them step by step.

621
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:45,908
lt hits you suddenly.

622
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,244
Sir, death is coming at us!

623
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:56,420
Bloody rogues!
Were you asking my help or my life?

624
00:46:56,594 --> 00:47:00,826
Never in my life l sought
any help from anyone till now.

625
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:19,006
We've reached...sit tight!

626
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:29,623
We've reached sir.
- Why are you walking like on main road?

627
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:34,753
You'll die, move away.
- Why are you leaving me?

628
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:04,658
How is Goa?
- l'm in Hyderabad not in Goa.

629
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:05,988
How come?

630
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:10,327
Those rowdy brothers threatened me
with men and brought back here.

631
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:14,335
Now they want me to come to Warangal
in two days later with their sister.

632
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:16,132
l'm scared.

633
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:18,668
Don't get scared, just do as l say.

634
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:20,401
Meet the girl directly...

635
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:28,674
To escape from your brothers' torture,
you must help me.

636
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:30,183
What help?

637
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:35,417
That is...get a virginity test done.

638
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,489
l know one mustn't ask a girl this,
but l'm disturbed by this problem,

639
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,498
l really don't know what l'm doing.

640
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:10,720
Why is she here at this hour?

641
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:16,195
Why are you coming to my house
at dusk like Chandramukhi?

642
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,198
By any chance is this your home
in your previous birth?

643
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:19,695
This is your dress.

644
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:23,738
You said you're sentimental about it, right?
That's why l brought it.

645
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:27,036
l need to talk to you.

646
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:32,745
Please sit down.

647
00:49:38,255 --> 00:49:42,089
l thought about what you said.
- What's it about?

648
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:44,750
ls it about my home?
This is my only possession.

649
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:46,259
Not about it.

650
00:49:46,597 --> 00:49:49,225
l want to go for the medical checkup.

651
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,597
Thanks you understood my problem.

652
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:57,896
Would you like to have some juice?

653
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:25,934
Song books, cook books,
design books, joke books...

654
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:31,803
l can't walk anymore.
l can't.

655
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:34,103
Didn't eat anything since yesterday.

656
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:36,809
l'm damn tired.

657
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:43,817
Give me two biscuit packets please.

658
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:50,483
Please hold on, l'll sell at least
one book and buy you food.

659
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,824
Story books...songs book...

660
00:50:53,964 --> 00:50:56,125
Cook books...
- Careful madam.

661
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:01,135
Design books, joke books...
- How much is the cost of each book?

662
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:03,773
Rs.20 each.
- Give me 5 books.

663
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,004
Take it sir.

664
00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:18,678
Won't you read it?
- l don't read books.

665
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:23,516
He would be happy if you'd given him
money instead of buying books.

666
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:25,355
He wouldn't take money.

667
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:28,156
Eat!

668
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:32,329
Though visually impaired he's determined
to earn decent living.

669
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:33,833
He has no idea to beg.

670
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:37,462
l can't give charity and
hurt his self respect.

671
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:58,387
Oh God! Bombs!

672
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,359
What's that for?

673
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:24,577
Hail son-in-law!...

674
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:29,124
Welcome to Bomb like son-in-law!
Fans of son-in-law Subrahmanyam

675
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,250
Don't bow your head, son-in-law sir.

676
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:33,093
Hey come here!

677
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:35,554
That's good!

678
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:44,240
Long live...long live...

679
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:48,108
Who is this Warangal Vinayakudu?

680
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,270
Local MLA, brother-in-law!

681
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:53,013
Oh knife!

682
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:56,783
What for this blood donation?

683
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:16,271
Hail future son-in-law!

684
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,806
Don't cry, l promise yourjob
is done, go.

685
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:20,967
Why are you sitting here like
waiting for biryani? Go.

686
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:23,806
Sir, l don't have anyone, you must help...
- Take him away.

687
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:26,973
Brother, keep me in mind.

688
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,244
Why is your home like the location
of Ramgopal Varma's film 'Rathri'?

689
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:44,957
How are the arrangements?
Aren't they tightly secured?

690
00:53:45,135 --> 00:53:48,468
lt's like festival outside
and l look like a scapegoat,

691
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:49,832
it looks like a sacrifice.

692
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:52,305
How can you think we'll sacrifice you
after inviting for marriage?

693
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:55,468
l'm here to avoid this
sacrificial marriage. l'm with this.

694
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:56,668
What's that?

695
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:59,680
lt's like power to politician,
gun to the police,

696
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,181
camera to the TV9.

697
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:04,514
People you mentioned now
wet their pants on seeing us.

698
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:07,521
lf you don't get what l said now,
you'll never whatever l may say.

699
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:10,023
This is the doctor's report that
nothing happened between us that night.

700
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:14,819
We know about our sister,
she's pure like gold.

701
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:17,698
lf she's gold make jewellary
or pledge it with Manapuram.

702
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:19,165
Please don't torture me.

703
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,865
Why are you leaving the place?

704
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:25,031
ls it public garden to enter
and go at your will?

705
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:28,201
You must meet my father.
- l said nothing happened between us.

706
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:31,542
We announced you both are getting
married to entire town.

707
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:33,372
l said nothing happened,
why don't you listen to me?

708
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,041
You should've told us yesterday,
you're late by one day.

709
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:37,709
Why did you rush if l got late?

710
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:40,379
We thought you rushed before marriage,
so we rushed for the marriage.

711
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:43,048
No use in talking to you,
l'll talk to your father.

712
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,057
No need to meet father, brother-in-law.

713
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:48,197
Don't call me brother-in-law.
l feel like you're abusing me.

714
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:50,356
l've come so far,
can't l meet your father?

715
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:52,525
Will you? Go!

716
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:57,730
You'll get dumbstruck on seeing my father.
Next you'll wet your pant.

717
00:54:57,908 --> 00:54:59,739
You'll get straightened up! Go!

718
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,243
Are you threatening me?
l'm not here in fear but with proof.

719
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:06,576
Sir, l beg you sir.

720
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,241
l beg you sir,
l haven't done any mistake.

721
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:12,911
Please leave me sir.
Please trust me sir.

722
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:20,420
Please tell me what's my mistake,
l'll go away sir.

723
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,765
l thought he's Godfather
but he's a bad father.

724
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:27,563
How am l to tell him?

725
00:55:28,238 --> 00:55:29,569
Who is that?

726
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:34,943
Father, we told you about him,
he's Subbu.

727
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:41,110
Bash him till he agrees to marry.

728
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:46,111
You look tired from journey, take rest.

729
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:48,450
You don't worry brother-in-law,
everything will go on smoothly.

730
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,286
Brother is calling you.

731
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:59,098
Take bath, let's have lunch.

732
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,100
Am l new son-in-law visiting
your home for festival?

733
00:56:01,271 --> 00:56:02,431
What did you promise in Hyderabad?

734
00:56:02,606 --> 00:56:03,800
You said you'll tell
your father and help me.

735
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,805
Now you're giving towel and
asking me to take bath.

736
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,869
l'm talking seriously,
is it comedy to you?

737
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:12,642
You've a tail!
- Tail?

738
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,642
Elders do violence here and
kids are nuisance. Take it.

739
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:20,649
l'll talk to father tomorrow morning.

740
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:29,625
Please forgive me father.

741
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:36,466
l'm sad for whatever had happened.

742
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:42,471
Actually, what really had happened was...

743
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:46,173
You needn't have to tell me,
l know everything.

744
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:47,839
No, father.

745
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:51,784
What has to happen will happen,
l'll ensure it.

746
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:05,324
Did you talk to your father?
- l did.

747
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:06,161
Did you tell him everything
that had happened?

748
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:07,860
He never gave me that opportunity.

749
00:57:08,038 --> 00:57:10,165
Didn't give? What were you talking
all the while then?

750
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,798
l tried to tell him but
he didn't listen to me.

751
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:18,879
Entire family lives without
listening to anyone.

752
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:22,212
l'm six feet and good looking young man,
l'm not a fish to catch.

753
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:24,216
l'm a shark, if necessary,
l'll chew you all.

754
00:57:24,888 --> 00:57:27,550
Such big dialogues won't suit
your personality,

755
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:28,713
tell me what should we do now?

756
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:30,883
What can you do if bad luck
is playing with me?

757
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:33,052
My condition is like Sehwag
hitting the last ball.

758
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,358
l'll talk to your father,
l mean l'll fight and settle it.

759
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,537
Make your move fast.

760
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:06,593
ln politics l stun opposition
with my deft moves,

761
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:09,561
but l'm getting beaten
by you here always.

762
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:11,064
lt has become routine to me.

763
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:13,566
lf you'd moved your minister
here earlier,

764
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:14,931
you would've won the game.

765
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,866
lt's very easy to advice.

766
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:22,344
You'll know victory or defeat
if you play a game.

767
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,440
Come and play.

768
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:27,438
Brother...

769
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,996
Just knowing game will
not give you victory,

770
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:28,804
you must have the intelligence
to anticipate opponent's move.

771
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:31,845
ls there any man here to win
over you, brother-in-law?

772
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:34,847
The game is not yet finished!

773
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:49,321
You said you can anticipate ten moves,

774
00:59:49,499 --> 00:59:50,966
l planned the eleventh move.

775
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,328
You said there's no man to
win over me, right?

776
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:09,383
See, he won over me anticipating
my moves from my words.

777
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:11,315
Can l find any better man than him?

778
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:17,716
Dear, not only you,
l too like him very much.

779
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:23,862
l wanted my son-in-law to be like me,

780
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:26,194
but now l found one who is
greater than me.

781
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:33,566
Durga, l'm fixing the marriage.

782
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:36,235
Have a blast!

783
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:45,244
What for this marriage, Ramanamma?

784
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:50,420
No life for me,
why extra baggage of wife to me?

785
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:52,758
Stop it!

786
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:55,727
Who is he like a drunken monkey?

787
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:58,390
lnstead of singing happy song,
he's singing useless song.

788
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:00,900
Take him and check his body.

789
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,743
Don't say no to marriage, my boy...

790
01:01:09,913 --> 01:01:12,939
Wife will be your only support
in the end...

791
01:01:13,116 --> 01:01:16,108
lf you marry, you will have children...

792
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:19,278
They'll fondly call you as father...

793
01:01:19,456 --> 01:01:22,289
lf you tie the knot, it's a bond of love...

794
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:25,451
lsn't this bond of love
the centre of procreation?

795
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:29,086
marriage is where
Gods descend to bless...

796
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:38,465
Agree to marry without
troubling us, Subrahmanyam...

797
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:44,644
Why do you trouble us?
Agree to marry Subrahmanyam...

798
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,982
lf you marry, life will be happy...

799
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,993
Life will rock with the
arrival of wife...

800
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:02,961
How long will you be solo, Subrahmanyam...

801
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:09,163
Don't delay, say yes immediately,
the girl is fantastic, Subrahmanyam...

802
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:15,505
Don't ponder...don't trouble...
agree...life will rock, Subrahmanyam...

803
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:34,190
She'll fall at your feet at dawn...

804
01:02:34,364 --> 01:02:37,162
She'll make your tea and serve you...

805
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:40,200
She'll kiss and
come before you with smile...

806
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:43,362
And take good care of you lovingly...

807
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:46,532
Where do you find such good ln-laws?

808
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:50,008
Why are you showing off
if we come on our own to offer you?

809
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:53,205
You'll get two salaries,
marry her Subrahmanyam...

810
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:14,534
No need to go to the mess,
she'll serve you food...

811
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:17,571
She'll arrange home and
wash your clothes...

812
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:20,733
lf you come home late,
she'll worry about you...

813
01:03:20,877 --> 01:03:23,869
She'll love you so much
to give her life too...

814
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,913
Why are you travelling alone in the car?

815
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:30,416
lf wife sits next you,
you'll hit jackpot...

816
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:33,852
Why are you delaying?
Tie the knot, Subrahmanyam...

817
01:03:58,448 --> 01:04:00,279
They say there's a woman behind
every successful man,

818
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:03,214
but you and your entire family
is there behind all my troubles.

819
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:07,449
Where are you?
- Just left Warangal.

820
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:10,122
Then listen carefully.

821
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:12,454
l've found a route to
save you from them.

822
01:04:13,296 --> 01:04:14,092
What's it?

823
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:18,093
l've a friend there,
his name is Khan,

824
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:19,598
he's my fan since childhood days,

825
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:23,296
two eggs laid by one hen,
if one ends up as omelette,

826
01:04:23,473 --> 01:04:26,465
another hatches into a chick,
we studied together in the same school,

827
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:28,634
l became an engineer and
he became a rowdy sheeter,

828
01:04:28,811 --> 01:04:31,473
if you go to him,
these brothers will not come to you.

829
01:04:43,493 --> 01:04:49,955
lf you're my Balaraju's friend,
you're my friend too!

830
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:53,799
Give me a hug!

831
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:55,798
He smells horrible and
wants me to hug him.

832
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:59,339
Tell me, what would you like to have?

833
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:03,843
Pepsi, Thums Up, or Coca-cola?

834
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,175
l don't want anything.
Just listen to my plight, that's enough.

835
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:09,682
l'll hear, yourjob is done.

836
01:05:09,852 --> 01:05:13,015
Tell me about Balaraju first.

837
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:15,521
ls he any world beauty to tell about him?

838
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:25,357
l know sir. lf he hatched into a chick,
you ended up as omelette.

839
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:27,162
He too said the same thing.

840
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:32,000
lf l send him Halim for my festival,
he'll send Halwa for his festival.

841
01:05:32,175 --> 01:05:36,009
That's the relationship,
why did he send you to me?

842
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:37,703
You've to warn a man.

843
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,874
No need to warn, l'll finish him.

844
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:48,217
l'll kill him and repay
my gratitude to Balaraju.

845
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:49,551
No need sir, just warning is enough.

846
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:52,058
No...no...

847
01:05:52,228 --> 01:05:58,030
l'll kill him for Balaraju,
l'll dedicate it to our friendship.

848
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:00,567
Hats off to your friendship,
but a warning is enough.

849
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:03,695
Okay, l'll just warn him,
who is that man?

850
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:07,036
That is...
- Who is he?

851
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:10,739
Come again.

852
01:06:10,913 --> 01:06:13,143
The man people call as JJ in Warangal.

853
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:20,579
Brother!

854
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:22,418
Why have you fallen at my feet?

855
01:06:23,593 --> 01:06:28,553
Nobody planned and
sent you to kill me, right?

856
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:29,720
What's this, bhai?

857
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:33,665
l'm shivering his name.

858
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:36,629
Do you know who JJ is?

859
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:46,776
Only one man to stand against the
atrocities of Rudra Reddy is Janakiramaiah,

860
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:50,783
JJ went to jail after killing
Rudra Reddy's rogue elder son,

861
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:51,942
and that day he came out ofjail.

862
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:54,612
Come Janakiramaiah,

863
01:06:54,791 --> 01:07:00,457
l've been waiting for this day
for year to kill you,

864
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:16,101
where were you hiding all
these days fearing me?

865
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:20,147
They're not your children to hide in fear,

866
01:07:20,316 --> 01:07:21,977
they're my children.

867
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:26,315
l think they're here
to see your death.

868
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:31,093
lt seems he'll kill you, father,
kill that bastard.

869
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:02,187
Rudra Reddy's son who begged
for life from JJ,

870
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:07,921
and went away, nobody knows
where is he till today.

871
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:17,003
Don't tell you came to me,
if they know it, l'll be dead.

872
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:20,874
Small favour, brother.

873
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:28,712
l'm no more friend of Balaraju,
if he calls me, l'll behead him.

874
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,484
You don't worry, Subbu.
- What happened to him?

875
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:40,555
Who is he to threaten us?

876
01:08:41,898 --> 01:08:43,695
You come out of the sheets first,

877
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:48,196
if you cover face it means
covering our history.

878
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:52,196
Look into my eyes,
can't you see a lion in me?

879
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:53,364
l see fox.

880
01:08:54,076 --> 01:08:56,909
l've done 500 operations with right hand.

881
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:00,242
Can't l kill one man with my left hand?

882
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:03,908
lf you can kill for your nephew,
they'll kill for their sister.

883
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:05,417
There are 2 idiots.

884
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:08,921
lf he knows hooliganism,
l know to play politics,

885
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:11,924
if he's famous in Warangal,
l'm famous all over the state.

886
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:13,584
What does he think?

887
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:17,893
l had knocked out a bear with one hand.
Why don't you tell him?

888
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:23,232
Yes, he used to eat like gargantuan.
You know that?

889
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:27,103
l told you to tell about my bravery,
why do you tell about food?

890
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:30,406
Arrange a meeting with them,
l'll fix them.

891
01:09:30,613 --> 01:09:33,776
l didn't know we are also brave
people till you said that.

892
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:37,943
They should fear us,
why are you on bed fearing them?

893
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:43,786
l'll show them what fear is
and give them a taste of it, come.

894
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:52,324
Why fatigues as if going to war?

895
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,267
Just to show our power.

896
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:58,566
l've called Home Minister
to show our reach.

897
01:09:59,442 --> 01:10:01,433
Uncle, they're here.

898
01:10:08,484 --> 01:10:10,315
You said goons,

899
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:12,647
l expected them with
guns but they're here with roses.

900
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:15,814
They'll appear soft like roses
but later hiss like snakes.

901
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,491
l've the snake charmer to charm them.

902
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,078
Hello brother-in-law.

903
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:41,012
Greetings.

904
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:46,348
Why are you holding my hand
like a gun in army?

905
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:49,855
Don't know how many Pakistani soldiers
he would've killed in the desert?

906
01:10:50,026 --> 01:10:52,859
He's squeezing my hand
and says l'm powerful.

907
01:10:54,196 --> 01:10:55,026
Please sit down.

908
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:57,658
Brother!

909
01:11:01,871 --> 01:11:02,997
Your suit is excellent, brother-in-law.

910
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:06,164
Why have you come like new heroine
opening a Kalamandir showroom?

911
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:09,208
Moreover blushing shy.

912
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,543
Don't your family have
basic civic sense too?

913
01:11:19,055 --> 01:11:21,717
How is your medical practice?
- Good.

914
01:11:21,891 --> 01:11:26,555
You've done 500 operations with right hand,
do l need to ask you?

915
01:11:27,897 --> 01:11:32,357
l wanted to greet you personally
on your birthday,

916
01:11:32,535 --> 01:11:35,368
but didn't come because it won't be
nice to come before marriage,

917
01:11:36,372 --> 01:11:39,535
you've raised your nephew very well,

918
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,243
they keep knives where we've to eat
with hands and are not sharp too,

919
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:50,810
Father!

920
01:11:54,924 --> 01:11:56,255
Much better!

921
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,423
You don't lose heart, uncle.
- l'm scared.

922
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:03,395
This is fine.

923
01:12:04,233 --> 01:12:07,066
Unable to cut it.
Do you also want this?

924
01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:11,032
He's an army man, he'll manage,
you carry on father.

925
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,169
Welcome Home Minister!

926
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:17,108
Minister is very close to me.

927
01:12:18,948 --> 01:12:21,610
l called him for my build up
but he's kissing their hands.

928
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:22,443
Greetings sir.

929
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:24,108
What brings you here, Minister?

930
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:27,119
He called me for a meeting.
- Nothing, just for fun.

931
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:28,950
No, tell him if you've anything.

932
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,286
Nothing, my job is over.

933
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,791
Who do you think he is?
- Who is he?

934
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:35,590
My political mentor!
Bye sir.

935
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:37,421
You came to right time, have food and go.

936
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,592
Your invitation is humbling me, sir.
l'll take leave sir.

937
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:42,794
Okay bye.
- You don't lose heart, uncle.

938
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:47,306
You've not only earned well
but have good reach in power too.

939
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:51,143
Tell me, when shall we fix the marriage?

940
01:12:51,313 --> 01:12:54,146
Why haste in fixing the marriage?
She's yet to finish studies.

941
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:58,150
Didn't you marry Ananda Rao
when you were just 14 years old?

942
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,810
How did he come to know
about our marriage?

943
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:02,480
may be he knows my name
is Chinna before marriage.

944
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:06,822
They both like each other, it's good
if we fix their marriage quickly.

945
01:13:06,996 --> 01:13:07,985
Not that...

946
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:12,123
Look, you're the only lady
in our two homes,

947
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:15,293
it would be good if you
conduct the marriage.

948
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:19,297
Let's fix a good auspicious
date for marriage.

949
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:22,842
What do you say Ananda Rao?
- As you say!

950
01:13:23,646 --> 01:13:26,911
You don't lose heart, uncle!
- What lose? Already lost it!

951
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:32,180
You said daring and dashing,
made challenges like Thandra Paparayudu,

952
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:33,514
and threatened to behead them,

953
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:35,179
and fell at their feet like a coward,

954
01:13:35,357 --> 01:13:36,187
and finished me once for all.

955
01:13:36,358 --> 01:13:39,850
They said my date of birth
on seeing me.

956
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:43,157
lf l say anything, l think
they'll tell my date of death.

957
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,495
tell me what should l do now?
- Don't tell me anything.

958
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:53,669
Your parents left you in our care,
now our lives are in your hands,

959
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:58,210
if you don't agree to this marriage,
all three of us would die.

960
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:02,874
Let them be goons,
but the girl is like an angel.

961
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:07,386
l think she's the girl whom your uncle
was searching for you all these days.

962
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:10,055
Uncle, l wanted to tell you
a thing for long time.

963
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:12,387
l love Madhu, l'll marry her only.

964
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:14,222
You never told me this.

965
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:16,694
l thought of telling you, but this
damned family entered my life.

966
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:24,370
Why are you speeding away?
Police may catch us.

967
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:30,910
There are cameras in the signals,
go slow...

968
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:42,520
l want the CD of recording of your
pub's CC camera on September 2nd night.

969
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:45,257
My life depends on it, sir.

970
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:51,564
l'm very happy for fixing
sister's marriage date.

971
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:53,065
Yes, we too are happy, brother.

972
01:14:53,235 --> 01:14:56,932
My sister's marriage must be
celebrated all over the district.

973
01:14:57,106 --> 01:14:59,097
lt must be remembered for
at least 10 generations.

974
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:03,936
Even Gods must hail marriage
in JJ's home.

975
01:15:06,782 --> 01:15:09,273
Come, brother-in-law
- Who is your brother-in-law?

976
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:11,612
You thought of black mailing me
into this marriage,

977
01:15:11,787 --> 01:15:13,277
your master plan is entirely
recorded in this CD.

978
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:14,444
Watch and enjoy it!

979
01:15:15,457 --> 01:15:16,446
What are you saying?

980
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,287
When l say only l must say!

981
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:22,294
lf you stop me, this CD will go
to every TV news channel,

982
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:25,423
to your sister, your people,
and your father too,

983
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:26,962
sorry your elderly man!

984
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:28,660
CD will reach him with
the same effect.

985
01:15:35,778 --> 01:15:37,370
l'll not marry your sister.

986
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:41,977
Do what so ever...
Decide yourselves!

987
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:56,453
Father!

988
01:15:56,632 --> 01:15:59,465
How far the marriage
arrangements have reached?

989
01:15:59,635 --> 01:16:02,001
l'm very eager to see
my daughter's marriage!

990
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:06,801
Okay father!

991
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:36,202
l've sent Rs.25 crores cheque
to GVK foundations,

992
01:16:36,338 --> 01:16:39,364
likewise you come to Switzerland
after the meeting with Nagarjuna,

993
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:42,204
l've contacted fashion designers
for exporting garments,

994
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,040
your flight is at 2 pm.

995
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,233
Are you searching for anything?

996
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:11,362
ls this your phone?

997
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:34,892
Did l act well sir?

998
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:40,092
Still there are two more scenes,
if you do it well,

999
01:17:40,235 --> 01:17:41,600
l'm sure you'll become a hero.

1000
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:47,436
Our plan is block buster!
Our man is rocking her.

1001
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:50,609
What a great idea!

1002
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:59,618
Brother, father is coming
here tomorrow.

1003
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:01,449
He wants to meet brother-in-law.

1004
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:05,283
We're unable to bring
brother-in-law here.

1005
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:07,189
You must do something.

1006
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:08,926
Get him on phone.

1007
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,433
Where are you, brother-in-law?
- Who are you man?

1008
01:18:15,604 --> 01:18:18,129
Raising your voice on me!
l'm Durga!

1009
01:18:19,308 --> 01:18:20,935
Durga? So what?

1010
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:23,304
My father is coming here tomorrow.

1011
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:26,312
Go and receive him in bus stand,
if you want l'll send a car.

1012
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:53,171
Look brother-in-law!

1013
01:18:53,342 --> 01:18:55,810
Printing mistake,
don't call me like that.

1014
01:18:55,978 --> 01:18:57,809
l want to talk to you little.

1015
01:18:58,013 --> 01:19:00,504
You always talk too much,
why little this time?

1016
01:19:00,682 --> 01:19:02,172
Okay, tell me what's the matter?

1017
01:19:20,669 --> 01:19:23,001
lt seems my father will not live
for more than a month,

1018
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:29,376
doctors said warned another heart attack
if we do anything against his wish,

1019
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:33,709
father wants to meet you,
please try to understand us.

1020
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:40,382
l've read that helping another
is good thing, that's why l'm coming.

1021
01:19:51,033 --> 01:19:53,024
Why did you bring me
to your pacifying trip?

1022
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:55,135
l'll be brave if you're with me.

1023
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:58,032
Sir, elderly man!

1024
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:02,567
ls he the heart attack man?
- Yes

1025
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:04,735
He looks fit, how can he have
heart attack?

1026
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:07,078
How are you doing, son-in-law?

1027
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:09,907
He's fine, you sit down.

1028
01:20:14,756 --> 01:20:16,417
Shall we start the discussion?

1029
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:18,256
No sir, l beg you sir.

1030
01:20:18,427 --> 01:20:21,260
Father loves discussion.
- We hate it.

1031
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:24,058
Father, no need to discuss
with brother-in-law,

1032
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:25,894
let's discuss with Balaraju.

1033
01:20:26,068 --> 01:20:29,560
Why do you want to discuss
with me sir?

1034
01:20:29,738 --> 01:20:32,070
Did you bring me here to fix me?

1035
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:35,437
came here for heart attack,
didn't expect this attack?

1036
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:36,771
My fate.

1037
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:44,449
ls this your discussion?

1038
01:20:46,788 --> 01:20:49,279
Such a large peg!
Will you have it in one gulp?

1039
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,618
lt may not be good for heart.

1040
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:52,623
What's wrong with my heart, son-in-law?

1041
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:55,092
lt's strong like rock!

1042
01:20:56,098 --> 01:20:58,259
Please don't beat like that,
it's hurting my heart.

1043
01:20:58,433 --> 01:21:00,594
First let's raise the glasses!

1044
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:11,469
l feel like in heaven having
drinks with you, son-in-law.

1045
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:13,638
You'll reach there in few days anyway.

1046
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:18,309
You said you'll go to our place
which is heaven to you.- That!

1047
01:21:18,487 --> 01:21:20,819
What's this? Doctor said he'll
be here for few more days.

1048
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:25,315
Dr.Ranganadham said he'll meet
you in a month.

1049
01:21:25,494 --> 01:21:28,895
He has lot of respect for me,
would l wait till he comes?

1050
01:21:30,132 --> 01:21:32,623
Though you know you're going,
you're still smiling,

1051
01:21:32,801 --> 01:21:34,325
you're really great sir.

1052
01:21:34,503 --> 01:21:37,961
Tell me one thing,
tell me correctly,

1053
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:39,505
when are you leaving sir?

1054
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:43,968
l've met my son-in-law, l'll go in
two days with that happiness.

1055
01:21:44,146 --> 01:21:48,674
l must tell you something before that.

1056
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:53,344
Shut up, why don't you let me talk?
l must tell him something.

1057
01:21:57,526 --> 01:22:02,486
Subbu doesn't love your daughter.

1058
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:05,655
l know!

1059
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:10,664
My daughter loves son-in-law!

1060
01:22:13,175 --> 01:22:15,075
How nicely you crack jokes!

1061
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:18,206
l must tell you something now.

1062
01:22:19,047 --> 01:22:21,538
This is your daughter,
this is Subbu.

1063
01:22:21,717 --> 01:22:23,048
Come here.
- What?

1064
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:27,719
How dare you compare my golden
son-in-law with a brandy bottle!

1065
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,190
You shut it down!
Wait sir, he's not feeling well.

1066
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:41,699
l'm her only sir.

1067
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,394
Power cut, right?

1068
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:49,739
Till now they played with us,
now l'll play Twenty 20 with them.

1069
01:22:49,911 --> 01:22:51,742
ls it necessary to play cricket in dark?

1070
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:55,747
Not really cricket,
l'll rap Durga's head.

1071
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:05,757
Where are you going man?

1072
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:08,896
l'll take care, you don't worry.

1073
01:23:15,904 --> 01:23:18,429
Why did you stretch so much?
- To say good morning.

1074
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:22,239
Good morning at night?

1075
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:25,444
Not good morning but good night.
l wanted to say good evening.

1076
01:23:25,947 --> 01:23:28,040
l'm sleepy, l'll go to sleep.

1077
01:23:29,284 --> 01:23:30,444
Come, l'll sing lullaby.
- Lullaby?

1078
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:32,450
Come, l'll sing very well.
- Why take that trouble sir?

1079
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:34,452
Come.
- l'll go to sleep.

1080
01:23:35,957 --> 01:23:39,120
What are you looking for?
- My friend is inside.

1081
01:23:39,628 --> 01:23:41,789
But you're here, son-in-law.

1082
01:23:41,963 --> 01:23:44,591
l beg you, please don't beat
on your chest.

1083
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:53,801
What did he do, brother?

1084
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:56,470
Sir!

1085
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:59,140
You came to beat me, right?

1086
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:00,474
Did he think of beating you?

1087
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:05,642
l swear!
- Tell me the truth.

1088
01:24:07,489 --> 01:24:09,320
To tell the truth, l did think.

1089
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:12,816
How did you plan to beat? Do it.

1090
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:17,131
lt won't be nice.
- Beat me.

1091
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:21,800
How l thought was...like this.

1092
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:25,572
Am l any milk suckling infant?

1093
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:28,499
Tell me the truth,
how did you plan to beat me?

1094
01:24:33,014 --> 01:24:35,676
But you stretched your and so far!

1095
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:39,685
Did l stretch so long? l would have!

1096
01:24:40,021 --> 01:24:45,357
Did you get the idea of beating me
or someone else suggested it?

1097
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:48,989
l didn't the idea on my own.

1098
01:24:49,197 --> 01:24:52,530
There's an unknown stranger inside me.
He comes out when l drink.

1099
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:53,998
Unknown stranger?

1100
01:24:56,538 --> 01:24:58,870
ls it any children's film?

1101
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:01,339
l swear l'm telling truth, sir.
Trust me sir.

1102
01:25:01,543 --> 01:25:03,340
Who else would l trust if not you?

1103
01:25:03,545 --> 01:25:07,538
Looks like Balaraju is very tired!
Give him a peg!

1104
01:25:08,049 --> 01:25:13,885
Not only my daughter, this family is
also your responsibility, son-in-law.

1105
01:25:15,056 --> 01:25:19,049
My sons are murderers
but very good people.

1106
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:23,854
l called you to tell this.
l'll go happily now.

1107
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:28,726
Father!

1108
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,735
Father!
- Don't get up, please lie down.

1109
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:32,563
You get the iron box.

01:25:33,742 --> 01:25:36,074
Nothing will happen to you,

01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,912
Please call him outside.
- Who?

1113
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:49,579
That man!
- Who is he?

1114
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:51,589
Unknown stranger!
- Stranger?

1115
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,421
Call him out.
- Who is he?

1116
01:25:53,595 --> 01:25:54,926
Call him l say!

1117
01:25:56,064 --> 01:25:58,555
Call him...call him...

1118
01:25:59,401 --> 01:26:00,390
Don't cry.

1119
01:26:01,236 --> 01:26:04,603
l'm not beating you, Balaraju.
- Who are you beating then?

1120
01:26:04,773 --> 01:26:06,070
Unknown stranger.

1121
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:07,606
lf you beat him, l'm getting hurt.

1122
01:26:07,776 --> 01:26:10,108
What bothers you if l beat him?

1123
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:12,110
Save me, please come...

1124
01:26:15,116 --> 01:26:16,481
Please call him out.

1125
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:18,946
call him out!

1126
01:26:19,788 --> 01:26:22,279
Call that stranger out.

1127
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:25,954
Why are you watching him kill me?

1128
01:26:27,128 --> 01:26:30,757
You stretched so far!
- Did l stretch like that?

1129
01:26:30,932 --> 01:26:33,924
Why did you stretch so much?

1130
01:26:34,102 --> 01:26:36,627
Call him...call him l say...
- Who?

1131
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:38,796
That man!
- He'll not come.

1132
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:42,808
Elderly man is dead!

1133
01:26:44,813 --> 01:26:47,179
What happened to father?
What are you doing? Stop!

1134
01:26:47,482 --> 01:26:49,313
He had a heart attack
and fell down.

1135
01:26:49,484 --> 01:26:51,816
l told him not to get emotional.

1136
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:54,979
But still he got emotional.
l'm trying to revive him.

1137
01:26:57,492 --> 01:26:59,824
Father is fine, brother-in-law.
- Did you see?

1138
01:26:59,995 --> 01:27:01,986
l was here at right time,
so your father survived.

1139
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:03,630
lf not your father...
- Take it.

1140
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:05,129
Why did you bring this?

1141
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,461
That's why l say watch more films.

1142
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:12,129
Generally doctors keep hot iron box
on chest to revive patients.

1143
01:27:12,307 --> 01:27:14,673
Will you iron him now?
Father is fine.

1144
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:15,673
You go dear.

1145
01:27:16,845 --> 01:27:18,836
You saved him like God.

1146
01:27:23,184 --> 01:27:24,344
Aren't you ashamed?

1147
01:27:24,686 --> 01:27:27,177
Situation is so serious.
Are you drinking here happily?

1148
01:27:27,355 --> 01:27:28,014
What happened?

1149
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:29,679
Your elder brother is better
than you guys.

1150
01:27:29,858 --> 01:27:35,353
Though your brother is goon, he was
worried about your father's heart...

1151
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:41,863
Stop it!
Tell me what's the matter?

1152
01:27:42,003 --> 01:27:44,062
Your father had an heart attack.

1153
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:57,547
King...you're an Emperor...

1154
01:27:59,554 --> 01:28:02,216
Brother, you're a God!
- You're really a God!

1155
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,220
What happened?

1156
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:08,226
Hiding the secret in your heart
that father has heart trouble,

1157
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:12,355
enduring the pain in your heart
fearing it may hurt our hearts,

1158
01:28:12,534 --> 01:28:14,365
keeping entire thing in your heart,

1159
01:28:14,536 --> 01:28:16,197
Stop your heart nonsense.

1160
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:19,738
l lied to him about father having
heart attack to bring him here.

1161
01:28:19,908 --> 01:28:23,366
He thinks it's true and giving
all of us an heart attack.

1162
01:28:23,545 --> 01:28:25,911
Where is Balaraju?

1163
01:28:28,249 --> 01:28:29,079
Sir!

1164
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:33,743
Call him out!
- Who?

1165
01:28:33,922 --> 01:28:35,082
Unknown stranger!

1166
01:28:35,256 --> 01:28:36,951
No need of stranger, brother.

1167
01:28:37,592 --> 01:28:41,926
l came here to play Twenty20 but
you played test match with me,

1168
01:28:42,897 --> 01:28:44,057
please declare the innings.

1169

Don't charge extra by placing

1203
01:30:44,385 --> 01:30:46,216
You're doing extra by having
extra drinks.

lt seems you refuse to

Who dared to beat my brother-in-law?

1222
01:31:43,444 --> 01:31:44,274
Why did you call them sir?

1223
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:45,571
They're the right men to deal them.

1224
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,270
Who are you and who the hell
is your brother-in-law?

1225
01:31:49,117 --> 01:31:50,015

Forgot to take the bottles.

1230
01:32:09,137 --> 01:32:11,128
Beat our men?
Who was it?

1231
01:32:11,272 --> 01:32:14,537
Some JJ's sons!
- What? JJ's sons?

1232
01:32:19,647 --> 01:32:25,313
After losing my father, l'm living
for 20 years away from home,

1233
01:32:25,486 --> 01:32:27,977

Bloody! lt's my sister
who got kidnapped.

1240
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:15,325
No sir, use this as an opportunity.

1241
01:33:15,503 --> 01:33:17,494
No use in getting emotional.

1242
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,667
Tell me clearly.

1243
01:33:20,842 --> 01:33:24,369
lf you take brother-in-law with you,
sentiment will work out.

1244
01:33:24,545 --> 01:33:27,036
After that it'll be love!

1245
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:38,051
Pick him up!

1246
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:41,559

1247
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:44,861
What sign? Telugu or English?

1248
01:33:45,033 --> 01:33:46,057
Give me the pen.

1249
01:33:47,869 --> 01:33:49,427
lf sign doesn't match,
come to my home.

1250
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:52,699
l don't know to fight sir.

1251
01:33:52,874 --> 01:33:55,240
You've brought me,
it's dark here.

1252
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:57,401
Didn't pay the bill so power got cut.

1253
01:33:57,578 --> 01:34:02,072
Who so ever may have
kidnapped my sister, l swear,

01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:04,241
l'll leave this place only
after killing him.

1255
01:34:04,419 --> 01:34:05,818
Who are you telling that
in darkness?

1256
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:11,748
l think they've paid the current bill.
- Shut up!

1257
01:34:28,276 --> 01:34:30,039
Are you still alive?

1258
01:34:31,913 --> 01:34:35,440
Though you know about us,
you still dared to take on us.

1259
01:34:35,616 --> 01:34:41,612

to wait so many years to avenge.

1260

Where is my sister?

1261
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:45,284

Bloody! Broke my head!

1264
01:35:10,318 --> 01:35:10,977
Don't shout, if your men hear,
they may kill me.

1265
01:35:11,152 --> 01:35:12,312
l'm new to this field.

1266
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:18,653
lf you had hair, you wouldn't have
got so seriously injured.

1267
01:35:23,798 --> 01:35:24,787
Use hair oil, hair will grow fast.

1268
01:35:25,133 --> 01:35:26,464
One more skinhead.
Goons are always skinheads.

1269
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:28,158
Let him come, l'll break his head.

1270
01:35:30,338 --> 01:35:32,169
l expected skinhead but he came.

1271
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,969
Who hit him and ran away!
Get up...get up...

1272
01:35:36,677 --> 01:35:37,974
Somebody hit you and ran away.

1273
01:35:38,346 --> 01:35:39,506
Look, that man!

1276
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:51,021
Why are you hitting my legs,
brother-in-law?

1277
01:35:51,192 --> 01:35:52,682
This time l'll not miss.

1278

1279
01:35:54,695 --> 01:35:55,855
Hit him, that's it.

He escaped nicely!
- Are you here to beat them or us?

1281
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:10,700
Hit him again.

1282
01:36:18,052 --> 01:36:18,711
Come.

01:36:36,537 --> 01:36:37,868
Go away with my sister.

is my father's mercy.

1285
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:04,557
lf not l would've buried you alive.

1286
01:37:17,778 --> 01:37:18,904
Why did you call at this hour?

1287
01:37:19,113 --> 01:37:23,015
Small fight, got hurt in an accident.

1288
01:37:23,284 --> 01:37:24,114
Accident?

1289
01:37:24,452 --> 01:37:25,942

1336
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:34,481
You? Hit and kill me!

1337
01:43:34,655 --> 01:43:37,647
The day l met you, l'm in troubles.

1338
01:43:37,825 --> 01:43:39,656
No Subbu...
- Go away!

1339
01:44:04,518 --> 01:44:05,678
ls there anyone here by chance?

1340
01:44:08,188 --> 01:44:10,019
How did l reach home last night?

1341
01:44:11,525 --> 01:44:12,685
A girl brought you home.

1342
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:16,352
She was awake all the night,
left just now.

1343
01:44:57,738 --> 01:45:00,070
Didn't get hurt, right?
- No.

1344
01:45:01,208 --> 01:45:03,369
Why?
- For beating you last night.

1345
01:45:05,245 --> 01:45:07,076
You haven't taken it to
your heart, right?

1346
01:45:07,247 --> 01:45:10,410
To feel l wasn't beaten
by someone else, right?

1347
01:45:12,419 --> 01:45:14,080
Then thanks.
- Why thanks?

1348
01:45:14,254 --> 01:45:17,746
For taking me to home and
keeping watch on me all the night.

1349
01:45:17,925 --> 01:45:21,088
Mustn't thank for being
a responsible friend.

1350
01:45:21,261 --> 01:45:23,092
Correct but...

1351
01:45:27,067 --> 01:45:29,058
What? Don't you want my friendship?

1352
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:30,400
l like...

1353
01:45:30,571 --> 01:45:33,233
Why are then hesitating
to shake hands?

1354
01:45:33,407 --> 01:45:35,568
l'll give a party to celebrate
our friendship.

1355
01:45:35,776 --> 01:45:38,574
First shake hands,
then let's think about party.

1356
01:45:39,113 --> 01:45:41,104
l think you'll not leave
till l shake hands.

1357
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:42,441
Promise not to feel bad later.

1358
01:45:42,616 --> 01:45:44,777
l wouldn't feel bad even
if you hadn't said sorry.

1359
01:45:44,952 --> 01:45:47,443
But l'll feel if you don't shake hands.

1360
01:45:48,956 --> 01:45:49,945
What happened?

1361
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:52,724
Fell into dirt just now.

1362
01:45:58,432 --> 01:46:00,593
They've moved many paces up
in friendship.

1363
01:46:01,268 --> 01:46:05,432
Let's do something and unite them.

1364
01:46:08,442 --> 01:46:12,139
Subbu will come to the shopping
as per Balaraju's information.

1365
01:46:12,312 --> 01:46:15,804
Ensure your sister too reaches
there using her friend's help.

1366
01:46:15,983 --> 01:46:17,814
Your sister must get into
the lift in second floor,

1367
01:46:17,985 --> 01:46:21,648
Balaraju will call Subbu from
third floor to fifth floor.,

1368
01:46:21,822 --> 01:46:25,155
as soon as lift reaches third floor,
switch off the lift lights,

1369
01:46:25,325 --> 01:46:29,318
as soon as Subbu enters and door
closes, lights must be switched on,

1370
01:46:29,997 --> 01:46:33,125
both of them see each other
and get shocked,

1371
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,632
they're in dilemma to speak
or not to speak,

1372
01:46:35,836 --> 01:46:40,000
here comes the turning point,
lift must stop suddenly,

1373
01:46:40,307 --> 01:46:42,832
it must take at least an hour
to open the door,

1374
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:45,638
they'll talk to each other
without knowing what had happened,

1375
01:46:45,846 --> 01:46:50,510
as soon as they talk, lift must start
and hit the ground floor suddenly.

1376
01:46:53,187 --> 01:46:57,521
as the lift reaches ground floor,
they'll be in each other's arms.

1377
01:46:57,691 --> 01:47:01,855
in the one hour we give them,
chemistry between them starts working,

1378
01:47:02,029 --> 01:47:06,329
you needn't get surprized if they
go to Arya Samaj from there.

1379
01:47:06,867 --> 01:47:07,663
Brother!

1380
01:47:10,337 --> 01:47:11,668
Sister is there!

1381
01:47:11,872 --> 01:47:13,806
Who is inside then?

1382
01:47:34,394 --> 01:47:36,954
Fragrance is good, what's the scent?

1383
01:47:37,865 --> 01:47:39,526
Do you love anyone?

1384
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:41,463
Why do you want to know
my personal matters?

1385
01:47:42,202 --> 01:47:44,693
You appear to have not yet
fallen in love with anyone.

1386
01:47:44,905 --> 01:47:46,896
What sort of a girl are
you waiting for?

1387
01:47:47,074 --> 01:47:49,542
Must be slim, fair and beautiful.

1388
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:51,075
Must be well educated too.

1389
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:56,573
Bloody life!
l don't have even one quality.

1390
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:59,749
What do you eat?
- Nothing.

1391
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,582
That's why, are you so thin?

1392
01:48:02,756 --> 01:48:06,248
Don't touch!
- Please listen to me.

1393
01:48:06,426 --> 01:48:09,259
Don't harm me, l'm still a bachelor.

1394
01:48:09,429 --> 01:48:11,727
Please don't ruin my life.
- Please listen to me.

1395
01:48:11,899 --> 01:48:13,924
Oh my God! She's terrible!

1396
01:48:17,404 --> 01:48:22,569
She was inside, did that Love Guru
scene happen with her?

1397
01:48:25,445 --> 01:48:27,106
What a nasty plan!

1398
01:48:27,281 --> 01:48:31,615
Trust me sir, l didn't know
about escalators there.

1399
01:48:33,787 --> 01:48:36,620
l don't know if Love Guru's
ideas work or not.- Yes brother.

1400
01:48:40,794 --> 01:48:42,284
Who rang the bell?

1401
01:49:01,481 --> 01:49:04,644
ls this puppy worth Rs.1 lakh?

1402
01:49:04,818 --> 01:49:07,309
Dogs are expensive than humans.

1403
01:49:07,487 --> 01:49:08,818
Yes brother.
- Keep it inside.

1404
01:49:28,475 --> 01:49:30,340
What's the costliest item here?

1405
01:49:37,184 --> 01:49:38,344
Subbu is very good.

1406
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:43,079
Very cute too.

1407
01:49:43,857 --> 01:49:45,518
That's why that name.

1408
01:49:49,029 --> 01:49:52,829
l'm little uneasy with
lot of sounds at night.

1409
01:49:55,836 --> 01:49:57,497
l don't snore.

1410
01:50:00,674 --> 01:50:04,667
But very sweet while angry
and biting teeth.

1411
01:50:06,213 --> 01:50:07,202
Biting teeth?

1412
01:50:07,881 --> 01:50:09,371
May be remembered your brothers.

1413
01:50:16,223 --> 01:50:20,887
Pumpkin gravy was great!
l didn't like it earlier.

1414
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:25,198
Are you attending cooking classes?
- Why are you asking that?

1415
01:50:25,699 --> 01:50:29,066
Off late girls have started
cooking, that's why.

1416
01:50:29,202 --> 01:50:31,067
l know to cook.

1417
01:50:36,243 --> 01:50:36,868
Where are you going?

1418
01:50:37,077 --> 01:50:41,070
l'll not think about lover like you,
l'm going to propose my love.

1419
01:50:41,248 --> 01:50:43,079
You'll never understand my problem.

1420
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:44,740
That's the problem with girls,

1421
01:50:44,918 --> 01:50:48,410
we'll fall in love deeply
and yet fear to express it.

1422
01:50:48,588 --> 01:50:50,249
lt's common with girls.

1423
01:50:50,424 --> 01:50:55,919
How can l propose without knowing
whether he likes me or not.

1424
01:50:57,097 --> 01:50:58,394
l'm scared.

1425
01:50:58,565 --> 01:51:01,728
Why should you be scared to express
love with someone you love?

1426
01:51:01,902 --> 01:51:05,895
You may think before falling in love,
but don't delay to express your love.

1427
01:51:06,106 --> 01:51:09,735
You propose your love,
l'm sure he'll accept.

1428
01:51:14,281 --> 01:51:15,771
Are you sentimental about this place?

1429
01:51:15,949 --> 01:51:19,612
l always plan and take important
decisions in my life here only.

1430
01:51:22,456 --> 01:51:25,619
l think you don't mingle
with other much.- Yes.

1431
01:51:25,792 --> 01:51:29,125
l don't know why but l can't get
along with people easily.

1432
01:51:30,464 --> 01:51:34,127
l can talk only with someone
l really feel very close.

1433
01:51:36,603 --> 01:51:40,471
We've a singing competition
to celebrate Valentine's day.

1434
01:51:40,607 --> 01:51:44,304
We'll arrange all expenses paid
marriage of the winning couple,

1435
01:51:44,478 --> 01:51:46,343
why not try your luck?

1436
01:51:47,481 --> 01:51:49,142
Are you going to sing?

1437
01:51:49,316 --> 01:51:51,147
No, if l sing nobody here will marry,

1438
01:51:51,318 --> 01:51:52,478
l'm going to the rest room.

1439
01:52:09,469 --> 01:52:11,460
For you only...

1440
01:52:26,686 --> 01:52:31,680
l like you like love...

1441
01:52:31,858 --> 01:52:37,194
Become part of me like my shadow...

1442
01:52:48,375 --> 01:52:53,210
You're the words that never
crossed the boundary of silence...

1443
01:52:53,380 --> 01:53:01,378
You're the union that eyes
never united with...

1444
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:15,031
Look there, a rocket is flying!

1445
01:53:16,236 --> 01:53:18,227
lt's a falling star not a rocket.

1446
01:53:18,405 --> 01:53:22,239
People who watch it falling
are very fortunate.

1447
01:53:22,409 --> 01:53:25,401
So, your life will hit
a purple patch from now.

1448
01:53:28,415 --> 01:53:30,246
l would've fallen down.

1449
01:53:30,417 --> 01:53:32,408
How can you fall down
when l'm with you?

1450
01:53:33,086 --> 01:53:38,251
lmaginations are flying...
Finding many new things...

1451
01:53:38,425 --> 01:53:48,733
l'm thrilled...

1452
01:53:48,902 --> 01:53:54,067
Hearing the rhythm of heart...
sleeping eyes wide open...

1453
01:53:54,274 --> 01:54:03,945
l say this is wonderful pleasure...

1454
01:54:04,117 --> 01:54:06,779
Like the music of the flute...

1455
01:54:06,953 --> 01:54:09,285
Like the waves of happiness...

1456
01:54:09,456 --> 01:54:15,122
Like the blossomed flower...
Like a star in the sky...

1457
01:54:15,295 --> 01:54:20,426
l can see your friendship...

1458
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:24,934
l feel like that...

1459
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:32,107
You? Why did you come back?

1460
01:54:32,312 --> 01:54:37,147
For you. l missed a lot in my life
by missing you.

1461
01:54:37,317 --> 01:54:40,980
l want to talk to you.
- Leave me.

1462
01:54:52,632 --> 01:54:53,792
Are you fine?

1463
01:55:01,975 --> 01:55:02,737
Okay, come.

1464
01:55:48,555 --> 01:55:51,718
You're not in a condition to listen,
let's talk tomorrow.

1465
01:56:00,533 --> 01:56:02,398
You've forgotten your phone.

1466
01:56:04,571 --> 01:56:06,562
Hello Subbu, l'm Sanjana here.

1467
01:56:06,706 --> 01:56:09,573
What do you've to do with my Subbu?

1468
01:56:11,044 --> 01:56:14,070
Don't you know you shouldn't
disturb calling at this hour?

1469
01:56:14,914 --> 01:56:17,906
No use in getting educated,
learn manners.

1470
01:56:30,597 --> 01:56:31,894
Where did l keep my cell phone?

1471
01:56:34,734 --> 01:56:36,725
Madam who was with you left it here.

1472
01:56:51,117 --> 01:56:54,450
She went away to home,
she left this letter for you.

1473
01:57:01,127 --> 01:57:05,427
You faced a lot of problems
because of me and my family.

1474
01:57:05,598 --> 01:57:07,759
l must thank you also.

1475
01:57:07,934 --> 01:57:12,769
For accepting me as your friend
at least for few days.

1476
01:57:12,939 --> 01:57:17,808
The days l spent with you will
be my cherished memories of life.

1477
01:57:17,977 --> 01:57:19,638
One more request.

1478
01:57:19,813 --> 01:57:22,646
Please don't see my brothers negatively.

1479
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:26,308
l'll meet my father and
tell him everything.

1480
01:57:26,486 --> 01:57:28,818
They'll never again disturb you in life.

1481
01:57:28,988 --> 01:57:33,322
l think you'll get the girl you like.

1482
01:57:58,017 --> 01:58:00,679
Janakiramaiah is busy with
his daughter's marriage.

1483
01:58:00,854 --> 01:58:02,344
Why are you still pondering?

1484
01:58:04,023 --> 01:58:05,684
This is the best time to kill them.

1485
01:58:05,859 --> 01:58:07,850
Not kill them, we must stop the marriage.

1486
01:58:08,027 --> 01:58:10,860
They must die in humiliation
with the marriage cancellation.

1487
01:58:15,001 --> 01:58:16,696
l want to talk to you.

1488
01:58:32,051 --> 01:58:35,885
Brother-in-law, we wanted you to
become son-in-law to our family,

1489
01:58:36,055 --> 01:58:38,216
we made few mistakes
to fix this match,

1490
01:58:38,391 --> 01:58:40,882
you must forgive us, brother-in-law.

1491
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:43,551
lf match is fixed in cricket,
it's bad name to playing countries,

1492
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:46,358
but your match fixing has
united two hearts.

1493
01:58:47,033 --> 01:58:48,694
While l was in honeymoon,

1494
01:58:48,868 --> 01:58:51,200
Durga blackmailed Subbu into
accepting this marriage,

1495
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:52,360
this marriage mustn't happen.

1496
01:58:52,572 --> 01:58:56,201
lt mustn't happen and
we'll not let it happen.

1497
01:58:56,376 --> 01:58:59,903
You must stop the marriage at any cost.
- We must stop.

1498
01:59:00,079 --> 01:59:01,410
Why are you repeating my words?

1499
01:59:01,581 --> 01:59:04,072
That's all.

1500
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,080
Where are you going?

1501
01:59:05,251 --> 01:59:08,914
l'll kidnap the bride.
- Will you kidnap the bride?

1502
01:59:10,089 --> 01:59:13,252
lf you kidnap the bride,
Subbu will be the loser.

1503
01:59:13,426 --> 01:59:17,260
Not the bride, Durga is the kingpin.

1504
01:59:17,397 --> 01:59:20,560
Where ever he may be, pack him
in a gunny bag and bring here.

1505
01:59:20,733 --> 01:59:22,724
When you're doing so much for friend...

1506
01:59:22,902 --> 01:59:24,893
You're a not man at all!

1507
01:59:25,772 --> 01:59:27,171
You're a great man!

1508
01:59:33,246 --> 01:59:34,440
About turn!

1509
01:59:38,785 --> 01:59:41,777
Greetings sir...greetings sir...

1510
01:59:41,955 --> 01:59:46,790
To tell you the truth, Pakistan soldiers
were eager to die in my hands.

1511
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:49,121
l too killed them easily.

1512
01:59:49,963 --> 01:59:52,431
Finding Subbu has no support or body,

1513
01:59:52,599 --> 01:59:56,933
in my absence,
will you force marriage on him?

1514
01:59:57,103 --> 01:59:59,435
My mother named me fondly
as Balaraju,

1515
01:59:59,639 --> 02:00:05,271
will you call me as pumpkin Balaraju?

1516
02:00:05,445 --> 02:00:09,814
l'll not beat easily...you...

1517
02:00:10,817 --> 02:00:11,806
Why is my hand not coming down?

1518
02:00:11,985 --> 02:00:14,317
lt's a different team, see yourself.

1519
02:00:21,995 --> 02:00:24,987
Why did you stretch it so far?
To say good morning.

1520
02:00:26,132 --> 02:00:29,966
l'll do one thing, you're stretching
because you've hand,

1521
02:00:30,136 --> 02:00:31,228
l'll cut it.

1522
02:00:31,471 --> 02:00:35,669
How can you cut his hand?
We've planned to kill Durga.

1523
02:00:36,309 --> 02:00:38,174
Why are you scared? What was our plan?

1524
02:00:38,311 --> 02:00:41,178
We must kill Durga,
our plan was to kill Durga.

1525
02:00:41,347 --> 02:00:44,339
He's scared because of you.
Why are you afraid? Kill Durga.

1526
02:00:44,517 --> 02:00:46,007
Will you kill Durga?
- Yes.

1527
02:00:46,185 --> 02:00:47,174
We'll kill him.

1528
02:00:48,187 --> 02:00:52,624
Why are you winking at me?
We had planned to kill Durga, right?

1529
02:00:55,361 --> 02:00:59,161
Who do you think Durga is?
He's Durga!

1530
02:00:59,332 --> 02:01:00,663
We're dead!

1531
02:01:00,833 --> 02:01:02,494
Are you Durga?

1532
02:01:02,835 --> 02:01:06,999
You look like a gentleman.
This mad man ordered to kill you.

1533
02:01:07,173 --> 02:01:12,201
Are you a man?
You're a great man! No doubt!

1534
02:01:13,046 --> 02:01:14,707
You're our team leader.

1535
02:01:15,882 --> 02:01:17,713
That's all, have a go!

1536
02:01:17,884 --> 02:01:21,877
Don't show any mercy.
Have a go.

1537
02:01:25,558 --> 02:01:29,050
Are you still in the same thoughts?
- No...no...

1538
02:01:29,228 --> 02:01:31,696
That drunkard is blabbering.

1539
02:01:31,864 --> 02:01:34,355
l've great respect for you, sir.
l've great devotion on you, sir.

1540
02:01:34,534 --> 02:01:36,195
l beg you sir.

1541
02:01:37,537 --> 02:01:40,370
You stretched your hand so far!
- No brother.

1542
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:44,533
l didn't feel bad.
- Looks like he's drunk.

1543
02:01:44,744 --> 02:01:48,236
Whose marriage is this?
Friend's friend's marriage.

1544
02:01:48,414 --> 02:01:52,407
Am l mad to get drunk in
a friend's marriage?

1545
02:01:52,585 --> 02:01:54,746
That's why l got drunk two days earlier.

1546
02:01:54,921 --> 02:01:57,913
Aren't you Subbu's maternal uncle?

1547
02:01:58,091 --> 02:01:59,422
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1548
02:01:59,592 --> 02:02:02,925
l'm not Subbu's maternal uncle.
- But still greetings.- Why?

1549
02:02:03,262 --> 02:02:06,561
l heard Subbu's uncle is
very worst fellow.

1550
02:02:06,733 --> 02:02:08,564
He's Subbu's maternal uncle.

1551
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:11,566
Just now l heard you're a very good man.

1552
02:02:11,771 --> 02:02:16,572
On this happy occasion, l'll manage,
you watch the marriage.

1553
02:02:35,461 --> 02:02:41,263
Mother, sister is getting married
in few minutes,

1554
02:02:42,101 --> 02:02:45,730
as you wished, well educated,

1555
02:02:45,972 --> 02:02:49,601
more than it found a man with
golden heart for our sister,

1556
02:02:50,443 --> 02:02:52,604
l've kept the promise made to you,

1557
02:02:52,979 --> 02:02:55,311
but l can feel your absence,

1558
02:02:57,483 --> 02:03:02,819
any girl's surname would
change with marriage,

1559
02:03:05,658 --> 02:03:07,091
with this marriage,

1560
02:03:08,995 --> 02:03:13,295
not only her surname but this
entire family will change,

1561
02:03:14,834 --> 02:03:23,299
to make sister his wife,
we committed many mistakes,

1562
02:03:25,178 --> 02:03:26,475
please forgive us,

1563
02:03:33,019 --> 02:03:34,452

1564
02:03:36,355 --> 02:03:37,014
Brother!

1565
02:03:50,169 --> 02:03:51,431
Where are my brothers?

1566
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:03,436
Durga, the ritual of marriage starts
with cumin seeds and jaggery,

1567
02:05:03,576 --> 02:05:05,441
and ends with tying the knot,

1568
02:05:05,578 --> 02:05:10,106
any problem in the canopy before
that is inauspicious, son.

1569
02:05:10,283 --> 02:05:13,275
l want to see this marriage
happen peacefully.

1570
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,120
Brother!

1571
02:05:33,773 --> 02:05:35,297
Take cumin seeds and jaggery.

1572
02:06:14,013 --> 02:06:18,507
any problem in the canopy before
that is inauspicious, son.

1573
02:06:20,519 --> 02:06:23,852
My sister is getting married inside.

1574
02:06:24,190 --> 02:06:27,353
Please don't create trouble here,
l beg you.

1575
02:06:27,526 --> 02:06:31,826
l'm not here to see your
sister's marriage, to stop it.

1576
02:06:40,506 --> 02:06:42,406
lt you want take my life.

1577
02:06:42,675 --> 02:06:45,041
But you mustn't stop
my sister's marriage.

1578
02:07:01,894 --> 02:07:03,555
Brother...brother...

1579
02:07:33,426 --> 02:07:34,757
Brother!

1580
02:07:35,261 --> 02:07:36,421
What's this problem?

1581
02:07:37,596 --> 02:07:39,894
ls the marriage over?
- Over.

1582
02:07:42,234 --> 02:07:44,566
lt means my sister is your wife from now.

1583
02:07:45,738 --> 02:07:48,263
Why should we wait now?

1584
02:07:55,114 --> 02:07:58,106
Who dared to beat my sons?
l'll kill you!

1585
02:07:58,284 --> 02:08:01,117
Not only your sons,
l'll kill you also.

1586
02:08:01,287 --> 02:08:03,949
Dare touch my family, l'll hack you!

1587
02:08:04,623 --> 02:08:09,287
Like that software Subbu became
hardware Subbu with family support.

1588
02:08:10,296 --> 02:08:15,131
lf they all join together,
it's discussion all the way!

1589
02:08:40,493 --> 02:08:41,152
Sit in.

1590
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:43,753
You look great in red clothes.

1591
02:08:44,497 --> 02:08:45,964
Enough of watching me,
watch the road and drive.

1592
02:08:46,132 --> 02:08:48,794
Got invitation from JJ,
must reach in time.

1593
02:08:48,968 --> 02:08:51,801
You don't worry sir,
l was pilot earlier.

1594
02:08:51,971 --> 02:08:53,461
l'll drive faster than a flight.

1595
02:08:53,639 --> 02:08:56,164
Pilot? Quit getting bored?

1596
02:08:56,342 --> 02:08:59,334
They got angry and fired me.
- Fired? Why?

1597
02:08:59,512 --> 02:09:00,672
l told them my name only.

1598
02:09:01,347 --> 02:09:03,508
Wil they fire for telling your name?
Why did you keep quiet?

1599
02:09:03,682 --> 02:09:05,172
There's a thing called as social justice.

1600
02:09:05,351 --> 02:09:08,013
Let's fight together.
Tell me what's your name?

1601
02:09:09,188 --> 02:09:10,678
So what?

1602
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:33,542
What's this?
He fainted hearing my name.

1603
02:09:48,727 --> 02:09:51,560
l can say how many feathers a chicken
has and how many eggs it lays,

1604
02:09:51,697 --> 02:09:53,688
how many chicks each egg has,

1605
02:09:53,866 --> 02:09:56,858
l can touch a hen and tell
whether it country or broiler,

1606
02:09:57,036 --> 02:09:58,025
don't act smart with me,

1607
02:09:58,237 --> 02:10:02,401
what would happen if a chicken
challenges before a hotel?

1608
02:10:15,421 --> 02:10:19,084
You kept your word,
you arranged my sister's marriage.

1609
02:10:20,759 --> 02:10:22,249
l can't repay the gratitude.

1610
02:10:22,428 --> 02:10:26,057
No need of gratitude between us,
l'm also a member of your family,

1611
02:10:26,232 --> 02:10:27,563
your sister is my sister.

1612
02:10:35,441 --> 02:10:36,601
Sing a song please.

1613
02:10:36,742 --> 02:10:42,271
l don't know to sing sir.
- Can't sing?

1614
02:10:42,448 --> 02:10:44,006
How can you not sing?

1615
02:10:49,788 --> 02:10:51,949
On behalf of the people
of my constituency,

1616
02:10:52,124 --> 02:10:54,615
to Janakiramaiah...

1617
02:11:00,432 --> 02:11:04,459
Can't produce enough paddy to feed
you in the entire Warangal.

1618
02:11:05,104 --> 02:11:06,867
You want all that with this gift?
