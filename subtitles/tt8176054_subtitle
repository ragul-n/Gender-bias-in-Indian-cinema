"Siruvaikundam Taluk

"Siruvaikundam Taluk
of Thoothukudi District"

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,400
"Near Karungulam is the
beautiful Puliankulam"

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,800
"The village we were born
Where our dreams live on"

6
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,320
"The village we were born
Where our dreams live on"

7
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,360
"Hello, welcome!
Endearing guests"

8
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,600

"Our Dear Elders
Uncomplaining Mothers!"

00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,800
"We welcome you
With a thousand respects!"

12
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Karuppi...!

13
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,200
"My name is Kannan
My teacher is RKR"

14
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
"My name is Kannan
My teacher is RKR"

15
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,640
Karuppi...

16
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,400
(singing continues)

17
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,640
Where did you go?

18
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,840
Come!
Let's bathe.

19
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
"We speak what we see
We hope you agree!"

20
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,360
(singing continues)

21
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,800
Enough! Let's go.
It's too hot.

22
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,840
- Enough? Sure?
- Yes, Brother.

23
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,880
(chattering)

24
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,400
These people are coming too.

25
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,480
Listen!

26
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
It's getting late.
Shall we leave?

27
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,880
Why are you in a hurry?

28
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
It's almost an hour.
We haven't got anything.

29
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Shut up and sit.

30
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,880
Anyway we didn't get anything, right?

31
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,440
They are coming too!

32
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,520
So, what if they come?

33
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,360
Why are you getting scared?
Wimp!

34
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't talk too much uncle!

35
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,960
They don't like us
hunting with our dogs, anyway

36
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,520
They are waiting to pick up a fight

37
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,080
So what?

38
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,960
If they come,
we should get scared. Is it!

39
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,200
Be quiet!

40
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,720
Why are you screaming your head off?

41
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,960
- Sit I said
- Alright!

42
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,160
It's ok if you are not scared

43
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,720
Tomorrow is my first day in College

44
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,720
I will leave

45
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,680
What are you going to achieve,
studying law?

46
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,160
Here we are depending on you!

47
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Is it our fate?

48
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,600
Why are you constantly pulling his leg?

49
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,720
Look at him

50
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,600
- He is starting to cry!
- Look!

51
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,520
- Come, let's all go study law with him
- Ey Muruga!

52
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I am leaving.
Are you coming?

53
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
I will.
My stomach is grumbling in hunger.

54
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
Taking him?
He will finish the food

55
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Karuppi...

56
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Where is Karuppi?

57
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,800
- Karuppi!
- Look at their arrogance

58
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,120
- Come on
- We should just face them!

59
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Quiet I said.

60
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,800
Saying something or the other!

61
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,280
Look! We have to
be scared of these people

62
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,400
Ey! Won't you shut up?

63
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,040
'Karuppi!'

64
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,880
How dare!
Hunting with their dogs here

65
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,520
Arrogant people!

66
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
We can't let it go on

67
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
We have to do something

68
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,960
Let us put an end to this today

69
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,160
Why get scared
listening to a small boy?

70
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,400
Then?

71
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,040
Do you want us to face police action?

72
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,520
Only we will, is it?

73
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,320
Won't they also?

74
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
They have everything

75
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
What do they have?

76
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,760
What do you mean!
Our fields and farms are with them.

77
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
We have only our empty stomachs

78
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,600
- So?
- So, we have to shut up

79
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,520
For how long?

80
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,400
Until the day your father and mine
stop working in their fields

81
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,280
Alright

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,560
Listen!

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,840
You want to create
unnecessary issues or what?

84
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,480
Shut up!
I warn you

85
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560
Keep shutting me up like this

86
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,200
Brother, where is Karuppi?

87
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Look closely.

88
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,000
She might be sniffing
around in some corner

89
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,680
See for yourself!
I can't find the dog

90
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
You think she is lost?

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,160
Hey!

92
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,320
You think my Karuppi will lose her way?
Shut up!

93
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,000
Karuppi!

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,600
Pariya, I doubt those guys

95
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,840
What are you saying?

96
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,520
Ey! I can hear the train
Run! Run!

97
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,240
RUN...Pariya!

98
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,560
(voices in distance shouting)

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,240
The train is close!
Looks like she will die

100
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
RUN!

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,960
KARUPPI!

102
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,040
(woman laments)

103
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Pariyerum Perumal
(Horse laden deity)

104
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
"Dear Karuppi
My Karuppi"

105
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,520
"Your paw scrapes
Are my trails"

106
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,160
"In the wilderness without you
How will I find my way!"

107
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,440
"Dear Karuppi
My Karuppi"

108
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,960
"Your paw scrapes
Are my trails"

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
"In the wilderness without you
How will I find my way!"

110
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,520
"Karuppi!
My Karuppi!"

111
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,920
"Can you hear my call?"

112
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,680
"Can you hear me cry!"

113
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,280
"Can you hear my heart
Under the train, tearing apart?"

114
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,440
"I need to see you, right now"

115
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
"I want to cuddle you now"

116
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,600
"I want your tongue
to lick my dirt clean"

117
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,560
"Where do I see you now?"

118
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
"Who is it lying broken in the forest?"

119
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,200
"Is it you or me"

120
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,960
"Is it me or you"

121
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,720
"You...me..."

122
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
"Me...you..."

123
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
"Karuppi!"

124
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,680
"You are dead, Am I alive!"

125
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,880
"Are you alive, Am I dead?"

126
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
"I know who killed us"

127
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,520
"Who died there, only he understands!"

128
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,720
"Is it you who was wiped out?"

129
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,480
"Is it me who is crying out!"

130
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
"Is it you who is weeping?"

131
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,080
"Is it me who is dying!"

132
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,480
"Dear Karuppi
My Karuppi"

133
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,800
"Your paw scrapes
Are my trails"

134
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,400
"In the wilderness without you
How will I find my way!"

135
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,080
"Dear Karuppi
My Karuppi"

136
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,360
"Your paw scrapes
Are my trails"

137
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,160
"In the wilderness without you
How will I find my way!"

138
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,360
(woman laments)

139
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,240
"Karuppi, wake up!
Mom is calling you!"

140
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,480
"We need to have a bath
Get up!"

141
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,720
"Why aren't you talking,
my darling!"

142
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,240
"What happened there,
my darling!"

143
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,680
"Did you languish in pain?"

144
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,840
"Did you think of me,
while dying?"

145
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,280
"Did he laugh,
when he killed you?"

146
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,840
"Did he glare,
when you barked?"

147
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,000
"Dear Karuppi
My Karuppi"

148
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,320
"Your paw scrapes
Are my trails"

"In the wilderness without you
How will I find my way!"

150
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,240
"I told you a million times,
why didn't you listen?"

151
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,640
"Who called you,
that you went away"

152
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,040
"How many times have I told you!"

153
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,880
"All humans are not the same here"

154
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,040
"They pamper and kill"

155
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,240
"They choke you to death"

156
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,480
"They caress your eyes"

157
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,640
"They break your leg"

158
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,800
"They kill you and laugh"

159
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
"They stand with you and cry"

160
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
"The black
The White"

161
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
"The God
The Devil"

162
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,520
"The slave
The Lord"

163
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,720
"The cheapskate
The ruthless"

164
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,480
"I told you there are many kinds of people"

165
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,080
"Why didn't you listen to me!"

166
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,680
"Now I want to see
you Right away!"

167
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000

"Dear Karuppi
My Karuppi"

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
"Your paw scrapes
Are my trails"

175
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,560
"Dad will ask for you tomorrow"

176
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,120
"What will I tell him!"

177
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,320
"Where do I tell him you are!"

178
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400

180
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,840
"Get up, Karuppi!"

181
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,120
"Look at me!"

182
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,640
"Wake up, Karuppi"

183
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,160
"Dear Karuppi
My Karuppi"

184
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
"Your paw scrapes
Are my trails"

185
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,120
"In the wilderness without you
How will I find my way!"

186
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,320
"To roam this world
in two limbs or four"

187
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,240
"You are not just a dog
Aren't you me? ?"

188
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,400
(woman laments)

189
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,680
'City of Tirunelveli'

190
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,480
PARIYERUM PERUMAL.

191
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
What does your father do?

192
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,000
- Father...
- His Dad...

193
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,840
Dad owns a load cart.

194
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,320
Load cart!
Very good.

195
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,280
A boy like you getting a seat here
is a big deal.

196
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
- Concentrate on your studies. Ok?
-  Ok Sir!

197
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,440
He says all the mathematical tables
very well

198
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,280
Just a little playful.

199
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,320
This is no place to play around!
This is a Law College.

200
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,080
There are many issues related to
caste, religion and politics here

201
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,080
Don't get involved in all this!
Study well. Ok?

202
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
Yes, Sir

203
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Only if you study well
you can make it big

204
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,480
OK Sir.

205
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,520
Ok. Your admission is done.

206
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,680
You remember everything I said?

207
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,040
Only if you study well,
you will become a what?

208
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,480
A Doctor, Sir

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,680
Ok! Your admission is done.
You can leave.

210
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,440
Let your mother go.
You stay for a minute.

211
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
Go on, Ma!

212
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Listen...

213
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
This is a Law College

214
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,840
If you study here,
you won't become a Doctor.

215
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,240
You can only
become an Advocate

216
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,880
I didn't mean the doctor
who gives injections

217
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,640
I meant Dr. B.R. Ambedkar

218
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh! Dr. Ambedkar is it!

219
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,960
Super. You can leave.

220
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,960
Ok Sir!

221
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,200
Here!

222
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,080
He says he will become
Dr. Ambedkar

223
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,360
Note this down

224
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,640
Why, Sir?

225
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,560
Boys like him
will soon get into some conflict.

226
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,080
Then he will come and stand here.

227
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,920
We should remember this then.
That's why.

228
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,280
Hey! Stop!
Someone's getting in!

229
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,080
Grandpa, buses won't wait for you.
Jump!

230
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,680
- Thanks!
- It's ok grandpa!

231
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,040
(Song from 'Vanna Vanna Pookal')

232
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,040
Move aside
See, who has fallen down?

233
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,320
Call the ambulance

234
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,160
Grandpa! Do you know him?
Did he come with you?

235
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
No! I don't know who he is.

236
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,040
He saved me when I slipped.
Now he is dead!

237
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,120
'College student accidentally
falls off a moving bus. Dies'

238
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,600
What is your name?

239
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
Pariyerum Perumal

240
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720

241
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,520
No, Bro.
Pariyerum Perumal

242
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,920
Oh! What does it mean?

243
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
- 'Pari' means horse
- Ok!

244
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,520
He who rides on horse- back.
A God's name!

245
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,520
Hey...!

246
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,440
Come!

247
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,400
Come on!

248
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
Where are you from?

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,160
Puliankulam

250
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Take that cigarette

251
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,640
Puliankulam

252
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,680
Who could he be in Puliankulam?

253
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,240
Don't you know who lives there?

254
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh yeah!

255
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,000
Puliankulam?

256
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,080
Do you know R.K.R Raja?

257
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Yeah. He is my grandfather.

258
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,720
He is my granddad too.

259
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,480
What did they ask you to do?

260
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,440
They asked me to smoke and
do the Law College salute

261
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,200
Put the cigarette in your mouth

262
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,440
Do you know what is
a Law College salute ?

263
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,320
Look there!

264
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,440
Jump high with your hand saluting &
your legs touching your buttocks

265
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,480
That's how you do it!

266
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,080
Why do you have a cigarette in your mouth?

267
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,480
Seniors were ragging me!

268
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,920
- We are five. Salute each of us twice
- Hey, I want 3

269
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
He wants 3.

270
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,920
Salute 11 times and you can go.

271
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,120
Did they rag after you
mentioned your village?

272
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,400
Who is it?
Show me!

273
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,360
No. It's ok

274
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,360
Salute! What are you looking at?

275
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
You are so much better!

276
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,320
They asked me to get drunk and cycle

277
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,600
My name is Pushpaleela.

278
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,800

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,040
Pariyerum Perumal is fine.

309
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,840
What is that BA BL, with a line on top?

310
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,360
I am pursuing the course, right!
That's why Teacher

311
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,920
(Students giggle)

312
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,120
Make the line as long as you want

313
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,920
Make sure it doesn't last life- long

314
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Ok, Teacher

315
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,880
This is a College.

316
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,080
You shouldn't call me 'Teacher'
Address me as Madam', Ok?

317
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,200
Sit down!

318
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,520
You look innocent.

319
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,800
But managed to
become a hero on Day 1

320
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,600
One has to be careful with you!

321
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,960
Bro, not like that.

322
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,440
Can I trust you?

323
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,680

Ok, students

Today we are going to look into
the Trial of Raja Nandakumar

327
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,040
The case stands in a
class by itself

328
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,400
And Raja Nandakumar was
a very influential man back then

329
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,600
Do you understand anything?

330
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,440
Does she consult me before teaching?

331
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,520
Bro, ask him!

332
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,440
What is she teaching!

333
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
(whispers in English)
History of Courts

334
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,480
History of 'Kotche', it seems

335
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,160
What does it mean?

336
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,400
Ask this one time, please

337
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,640
Meaning?

338
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,480
It is the History of Courts.

339
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,520
History of Courts, it seems.

340
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,880
What is that?

341
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,760
Do you understand?

342
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,720
If I did,
why would I pick my tooth?

343
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,880
What to do now?

344
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,120
You pick your teeth too.

345
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,760
Pick tooth?
For how long?

346
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,120
Until we understand this
stupid English.

347
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
Yeah Right!

348
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,720
Bro! Won't they teach in Tamil?

349
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,480
Tamil?

350
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,560
Are you kidding me?

351
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
Quiet!

352
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,920
I am going to ask her
to teach in Tamil

353
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,440
What?

354
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,360
If they know you can't
speak English...

355
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,000
they will treat you like shit.
Please listen to me.

356
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,440
Teacher!

357
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,440
Teacher?
What is your problem?

358
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,360
No! I am unable to understand.

359
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,120
Can you please teach in Tamil?

360
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,240
What?!

361
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,280
Are you sitting in a law college...

362
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
...or studying 5th standard
in some Government School?

363
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,760
Now I understand absolutely nothing

364
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,600
Ey! This is a Law College
Are you aware of it?

365
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,360
Why are you torturing me
on the first day?

366
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,200
I can't teach in Tamil
just because you don't understand.

367
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Sit if you understand
Leave if you can't

368
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,400
Not just me.

369
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,920
Lot of people here can't understand.
Ask them.

370
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
What do you mean?

371
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,080
Those who don't understand
please raise your hands

372
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,440
Ok! Raise your hands
if you understood me!

373
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,600
Everyone's raising their hand!

374
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,240
Thank You!

375
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,640
Everyone has understood.
Including the guy next to you.

376
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,280
If you don't understand, just leave
Go learn Tamil literature.

377
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
Go!

378
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,320
We were talking about the case of
Raja Nandakumar

379
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,160
Sit.

380
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,080
I told you to stay quiet!

381
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
Everyone's gone.
Come.

382
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,480
Come.

383
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,680
Hello...
One minute

384
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,640
Why are you calling her?

385
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,400
What did she teach now?

386
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,640
History of Courts class.

387
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,040
I know that!
What specifically?

388
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,480
Nandakumar Murder Case

389
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,080
Meaning?

390
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,120
The judgment of a murder case
during Warren Hastings time.

391
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,600
Why?
Didn't you understand anything?

392
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,880
Absolutely nothing

393
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,920
If you can't understand
buy Tamil books to study

394
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,080
Are there books in Tamil?

395
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,800
You can even write the exams in Tamil

396
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,840
Mother Promise?

397
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,760
Mother Promise!

398
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,480
Superb! This is enough.
I will teach a 1000 people.

399
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,680
Oh! Alright

400
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,360
Thanks a lot.

401
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,120
Your name?

402
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,360
I said it earlier.
Jothi Mahalakshmi.

403
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,760
You have two names then?

404
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,560
3 in total.
I am 'Jo' at home

405
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840

Here English is
very very important

441
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,920
- Here
- Why?

442
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
You see what class he is taking?

443
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,440
What?

444
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,800
'ENGLISH!'

445
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Even God can't teach this in Tamil

446
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,760
Here

447
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,480

Let's start

451
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,960
- Sir
- 'Yes!'

452
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,360
What is this, Sir?

453
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,840
We are Law College students

454
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,360
How can you insult us like this?

455
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,160
Oh! Like that!
Come here

456
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,040
Come

457
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,480
Write your name and address...

458
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,400
...in English for everyone to see

459
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,800
It is not 'Coolny'

460
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,120
It's Colony

461
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,360
Negar?!

462
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,600
NAGAR!

463
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,520
Isn't this your address?

464
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,920
-Hey!
- Hmmm?

465
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,760
Actually you should have been the one.

466
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,280
Some girl is bearing the brunt.

467
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,440
If it was you he would have
pulled your pants down.

468
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,760
Keep quite

469
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
Who is laughing there?

470
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
Last bench

471
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,720
Get up, now

472
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
OK, sir!

473
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,160
I asked you to get up

474
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,840
Oh! Is it?

475
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Red colour shirt

476
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,600
What is your name?

477
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,560
Pariyerum Perumal

478
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
BA BL with a line on top!

479
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,880
Is it?

480
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,400
I know why you laughed.

481
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,200
Let's see what you know!

482
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,920
Nothing.

483
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,240
Just tell me 10 words
that start with A.

484
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,320
Sir...

485
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,520
I am asking you.

486
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,680
Answer!

487
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
A for Anand

488
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,680
A for Ambika

489
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,880
A for Annalakshmi

490
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,120
STOP IT!

491
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,440
OUT!

492
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,760
Sir, I gave you the right answers

493
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,800
I am also saying the right thing. OUT

494
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,320
Idiot
That's not how it is.

495
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
Idiot!

496
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,840
You tell me 5 words
that start with C

497
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,240
Small 'C' or Big "C' sir?

498
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,440
Silence.

499
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,840
What is he saying?

500
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,280
He is asking if it is a
Capital letter or small

501
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
Correct Sir

502
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,920
My father is a Councillor

503
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,640
Should I go out for sure?

504
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,000
Long live India!

505
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,360
(Teacher speaks in the background)

506
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,920
One is saying A for Anand

507
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,440
Another one is asking C or c

508
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,920
Is he a professor or a postman?

509
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,160
Asking everybody's address
on Day 1.

510
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,480
Forget that Bro.

511
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,680
You are Anand

512
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,720
Starts with an 'A' right?

513
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,640
Yes! But Capital 'A'
I think you got that wrong.

514
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,400
Those who have to be in
KG classes are here.

515
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,960
Tomorrow, you write 100 words
that start with 'A'

516
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,520
And you 100 words
that start with 'C'

517
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,440
Only then you can enter my class.

518
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,240
Why is this idiot giving
all this as punishment?

519
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,400
See, they are definitely
going to make fun of us

520
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,440
Put your head down

521
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,720
You too

522
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Councillor!

523
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,320
- Small 'c' or big 'C'?
- Shut up!

524
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,320
Hey, BA BL!
Pariyerum Perumal!

525
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,640
What a shame!

526
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,360
All the English people have left!

527
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,480
Look up

528
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,520
Look up!

529
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,240
- Nothing
- Where did she come from?

530
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,040
I want to ask you something

531
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,840
Were you serious or joking?

532
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,680
About what?

533
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,920
A for Anand
A for Ambika

534
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,520
Why? I was serious.

535
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,160
No!

536
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,480
You shouldn't say that.

537
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,640
Why?

538
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,680
A for Apple, B for Ball
That's what you should say

539
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,760
Apple also starts with an A, right?

540
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,200
I am saying things.
You are saying names.

541
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,680
Why shouldn't I say names!

542
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,040
I don't know why
But from now on don't say that

543
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,640
Everyone will look down on you

544
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,000
- Ok?
- Ok!

545
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,800
Hey!

546
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,640
Leave this aside

547
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,680
Will you help me?

548
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,080
With what?

549
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,280
Can you write those 100 words
that start with A?

550
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,960
- Okay
- Thanks

551
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,120
- Jothi
- Yes, Anna

552
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,920
Will you also write 100 words
that start with "c"?

553
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,680
Small c or Big C

554
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,920
Oh I see!
How do I know that?

555
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,160
We should use her to clear English exams

556
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,520
You do that.
I will just use my father

557
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,000
Ey! Stop!

558
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,640
First year student, right?

559
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,800
Yes

560
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Why are you wearing
such colourful bangles?

561
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,560
Are you here for classes or
your bangle ceremony?

562
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,200
No! I like it.
That's why

563
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,880
Will you do everything you like?

564
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
You have to do only
what the seniors like.

565
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,160
I don't like it.
Remove it!

566
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,600
Ey!

567
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,440
Why are you behaving like an idiot!

568
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,640
'Akka!'

569
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
Are you mad?

570
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,000
She is our girl.
Can't you tell by her looks?

571
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,880
- Won't you mention this earlier?
- Sorry

572
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,040
Take her away

573
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,880
Why don't you say who you are?

574
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,160
Go

575
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,560
So much anger!

576
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,040
You think he is related to her?

577
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,560
I don't know

578
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,080
Look how angry she gets

579
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,760
Must be an adamant girl

580
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,480
Damn! Her hand is bleeding

581
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,400
You think she will be able to write?

582
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,200
That's all you worry about!

583
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,160
What happened?

584
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,400
I warned her many times

585
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Not to roam around with him

586
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,240
Yesterday she has gone
to the temple with him.

587
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,160
People are talking about this now.

588
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,520
I slapped her in anger

589
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,200
She hit the wall and died...

590
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,000
Anna!

591
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,920
He is the one who did it!

592
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,120
(crying in a low voice)

593
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,920
My daughter is gone!

594
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,600
Where is my daughter?

595
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,480
Kausalya!

596
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,520
Open the door!

597
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,720
Open the door, dear!

598
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,880
Don't do anything to yourself

599
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,440
I didn't say an angry word.

600
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,840
'Young girl kills self in Tirunelveli'

601
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,600
Ey! It's tails again.

602
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,920
She wouldn't have written it for sure

603
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,040
Damn! Then should we copy from a book?

604
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,320
- Come!
- Us?

605
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,480
Which book will you copy from?
I am going to the theatres.

606
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,720
She is here.

607
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,400
You thought I wouldn't write it!

608
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,080
We were tossing the coin to foretell.

609
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,040
What did you get?

610
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
That you won't write

611
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,520
But I did!

612
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,560
Is it!

613
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
Hey, this is yours.

614
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,440
What is this wound?

615
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,360
This!

616
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,080
Those seniors were ragging me yesterday

617
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
So, I broke my bangles in anger.

618
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,520
How did you write this?

619
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,400
I didn't write this.

620
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,360
Who then?

621
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,600
My niece

622
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,360
- What is she studying?
- Grade 3

623
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,960
Third grade it seems!

624
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,360
Jesus!

625
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,000
I was kidding
I wrote it.

626
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,880
Is it ok?

627
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,200
Ey, Sir!

628
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,360
Oh him!

629
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,560
Come, sit!

630
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,640
Sit down

631
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,080
- What?
- Let's give it now

632
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,040
That's right!
What do we do with this!

633
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,120
Sir

634
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,240
What is this?

635
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,080
The homework you gave yesterday

636
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,040
This too

637
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,480
- Nonsense
- Same to you, Sir

638
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,840
- Go and sit
- Ok!

639
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,040
Carry on!

640
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,200
This is college

641
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,440
Not a school.

642
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,680
I can't write the notes
on the board.

643
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,800
So, I will tell.
You have to write it

644
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,000
Origins of Equity

645
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,320
The term equity...

646
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,560
...can also be...

647
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,160
From the 13th century...

648
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,920
...all appeals against
the decision of the Royal judges

649
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Bro, what are you writing?

650
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,080
You want to get caught with him?

651
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,600
Write something

652
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,480
Bro...what do I write?

653
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,920
Copy this, may be!

654
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,240
How do I write this?

655
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,040
Ey!

656
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,760
Can't you draw eggs?

657
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,400
- Eggs?
- Do it.

658
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,920
Try at least

659
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,040
Forced the kings...

660
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,840
to pass these appeals...

661
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,400
to the Principal...

662
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,960
Royal official...

663
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,880
the Chancellor...

664
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,160
The Lord Chancellor was both...

665
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,480
One...

666
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,440
The Kings of Secretary...

667
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,800
Damn!

668
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,760
- Hey! Look
- What?

669
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,720
Give me your notebook

670
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,640
Give it

671
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,960
Hand it over!

672
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,360
- Sir
- He has written what I dictated.

673
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Read it aloud for
everyone to hear.

674
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,880
Sir, how do I read this?

675
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,480
Read what he has written

676
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,920
Sir...

677
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,160
He has written, right...

678
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,400
Egg, Egg, Egg...
Egg, Egg, Egg...

679
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,000
Egg, Egg, Egg...
Egg, Egg, Egg...

680
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,880
Hasn't he drawn it?

681
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,120
Read that.

682
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,440
Egg, Egg, Egg...
Egg, Egg, Egg...

683
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,040
Read aloud!

684
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,720
Egg, Egg, Egg...
Egg, Egg, Egg...

685
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,040
Silence!

686
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,760
What are these eggs?

687
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
Are you a chicken?

688
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,880
Have you come here
to lay eggs?

689
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,280
Egg, Egg...

690
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,000
Someone like you has got
a law college seat!

691
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,920
Egg, Egg...

692
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,040
What are you going to do studying law?

693
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,200
Are you going to herd cows in a suit?

694
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,400
Idiot!

695
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,680
Why have you all stopped laughing?
Laugh!

696
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,200
What?

697
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,520
Glaring at me?

698
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
What?

699
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,880
Chicken shit who got in through quota

700
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,560
Ey! What are you doing?

701
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,720
Stop it
Stop it, I said!

702
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,240
Read this, Sir

703
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,160
-Read
-What are you doing?

704
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,840
Read this

705
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,760
- Sir, read
- Get out!

706
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Read it once!

707
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
You called me a chicken, right!

708
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,200
Just see how many chickens
are there in this class

709
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,360
Sir, just read it once

710
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,080
- Please sir...You read this first Sir
- Rowdyism, eh?

711
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,320
- Read it
- Out!

712
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,320
You read this first Sir

713
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,800
Get out
Are you a thug?

714
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,680
Thuggery eh?

715
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,480
What happened?

716
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,120
- Hey, come
- Drag him out

717
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,720
Read it once sir!

718
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,520
- Come out and we will talk
- Just once Sir

719
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,520
Please Sir

720
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,600
Just once sir

721
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,720
Read it once, Sir

722
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,360
- Come
- Sir

723
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,280
Listen to me
Come out and lets talk.

724
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,040
Your notebook.

725
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,880
Are you still angry?

726
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,200
Why?

727
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,120
Can we talk a bit?

728
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Sit

729
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,440
Why did you get so angry?

730
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
If you don't like English
you should stay quiet.

731
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,760
Who said I don't like English?

732
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,080
That is how you behaved

733
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,720
I didn't behave like that.

734
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,560
Everybody treats me like that

735
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,760
Can I ask you something?

736
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,160
You cleared English in
grade 10 and 12 right?

737
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,800
Then what is the problem?

738
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,720
How much did you score
in grade 10?

739
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,840
360

740
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,080
How much is it?

741
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,960
(In Tamil)
Three Hundred and Sixty

742
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,880
How much do you think I scored?

743
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
Sorry...
200, may be!

744
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,680
- What?
- (In Tamil) Two Hundred

745
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,920
Three Hundred and Ninety

746
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,320
Three Hundred and Ninety!

747
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,760
Yes. But I failed.

748
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,160
How is that possible
after scoring so high?

749
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,640
How come?

750
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,920
All because of
your rotten English.

751
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,880
Teachers did not know the language!

752
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,440
I didn't get it too.

753
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,120
If it was only English...

754
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,480
...couldn't you have copied?

755
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,800
I did!

756
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,600
Even then I failed.

757
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,760
How?

758
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,360
How do I say that!

759
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,760
I hide small chits
when I go for English exams

760
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,760
When I see the question paper...

761
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,200
...I won't know which chit to copy from

762
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,720
Only if the guy next to me helps...

763
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,760
...I can figure out which chit to use.

764
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,640
That day they asked an essay
I hid under my foot

765
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,320
I struggled so much
to write

766
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
You got caught?

767
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,640
No way!

768
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,320
Then how did you fail?

769
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,760
How do I say this?

770
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,920
It took me 3 hours
to copy that essay

771
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,680
I got 7 marks for that

772
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,800
That is all I scored!

773
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,000
7 marks?!

774
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,840
How did you pass at all?

775
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,640
An Akka took pity on me
during the re-examination

776
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,200
What?

777
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,280
Time is running out!

778
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,800
And you are just sitting,
staring out the window.

779
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,440
I don't know anything, Akka

780
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,680
Sister?

781
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,280
You are appearing for re-examination
and still don't know anything?

782
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,200
How many ever times I try
I won't clear English

783
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,960
English is the only
difficult subject for Sir?

784
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,120
Alright!

785
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,440
Tell me how many subjects
did you fail in?

786
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,800
Only this, Akka

787
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,520
390 is my total score

788
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,760
Oh wow!

789
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,400
You scored 390?

790
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,640
Yes, Akka

791
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,760
Do you have anything
to copy from?

792
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,120
Take that and write

793
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,920
Everyone's doing it

794
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,920
You write too

795
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,000
Somebody like this!

796
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,440
Not just Akka.

797
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,400
She is the first angel I saw

798
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,520
I asked you to write
What are you doing?

799
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,400
I don't know which one to copy from

800
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,280
What do you mean...?

801
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,920
How many chits have you carried?

802
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,200
Lots!

803
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
Take it all out!

804
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,040
Hey! Why are you laughing
at everything?

805
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,240
Then I won't continue my story

806
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,640
Let me get the correct chit

807
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,160
This is why she
is your angel, is it?

808
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,640
Tell me what her name is!

809
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,840
I don't know her name

810
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,920
But she had a beautiful
mole above her eyebrow

811
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,000
She looks very pretty

812
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,360
Honestly

813
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,280
She is an angel to me

814
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,000
Hello...
That's enough!

815
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,960
So many stories in Grade 10?
How about Grade 12, then?

816
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,400
A fatso, who knew nothing in Tamil

817
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,160
Tortured me asking for my
Tamil answer sheet

818
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,800
I was happy that a girl
was asking for MY paper

819
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,200
I gave it too

820
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,840
I understand you helped
But why did you follow her?

821
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,800
She asked the same question too

822
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,360
Why are you following me?

823
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,320
I don't know Tamil at all
That's why I copied from you

824
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,200
If someone sees now
what will they think?

825
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,200
Hey! No!

826
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,280
You don't know Tamil
I know nothing in English

827
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,520
Tomorrow we have English exam right.

828
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,360
If you let me copy, I will come

829
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,840
If you won't, there is
no point turning up

830
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,800
That's why...

831
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,640
Is this why you followed me?

832
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,480
Come tomorrow without any worry

833
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,800
I will definitely help you

834
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,640
Mother Promise?

835
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,880
You started this Mother Promise trend
back then?

836
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,880
So!

837
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,080
When English is such a big hurdle

838
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,000
Why did you to come join Law?

839
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,000
Grandpa RKR Raja is the reason

840
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,160
Grandpa Raja!

841
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,080
Who is that?

842
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
Who you ask!

843
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,640
He is the spring of our village

844
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,120
Grandpa RKR Raja

845
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,280
He is our everything!

846
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,120
Two donation boxes yesterday

847
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,640
Today 3 donation boxes!

848
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,080
These dogs run around
with their dogs right!

849
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,920
- Why couldn't they have done it?
- Possible Sir

850
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,640
It is them!

851
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,040
You stay quiet.

852
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,120
- Hello Sir
- Hello

853
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,560
Why are you enquiring them?
They were just hunting!

854
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,520
Who are you?
Tell me that first.

855
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,920
It's me Sir.
RKR Raja.

856
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
So, what if you are RKR Raja?

857
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,320
Are you a big deal?

858
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,800
Why are you being rude?

859
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,640
Why are you enquiring them
is all I want to know

860
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,320
In the name of hunting
they are stealing donation boxes

861
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,680
Should I coddle them?

862
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,120
Did you see them stealing?

863
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,280
Why? Did you see who stole?

864
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,080
Only our boys go for hunt, is it?

865
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,040
How many people go!

866
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,360
Why do you only call
our boys and enquire?

867
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,880
Do they look like thieves?

868
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,280
I will slipper you!

869
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,840
How dare...!

870
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,640
You won't survive my kick.
You old dog!

871
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,320
How dare you question me like a lawyer!

872
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,120
Come, sir

873
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,800
I will throw you in jail
and tear you apart

874
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,600
Leave now!

875
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,480
Say all this nonsense in the Court

876
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,520
Sir, sit

877
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,440
Sir, why did you hit him!

878
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,240
Hey! Who is he?

879
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,480
Is he a Lawyer?

880
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,240
How dare he talk to a policeman like that?

881
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,000
He can beg and plead

882
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,560
How can he talk back?

883
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,960
If we let these nobody's talk

884
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,440
Then petty lawyers
will start talking like Judges.

885
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,720
Understand?

886
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,280
Forgive us, Grandpa!

887
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,200
We won't go for hunts anymore.

888
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,320
Not that.
We will hit back one day too!

889
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,800
Leave that.

890
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,560
Don't tell anyone
that I was beaten up

891
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,040
They believe that
I can talk on their behalf.

892
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,760
If others know this
they won't respect our people.

893
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,920
Then there won't be a soul
to talk for this village.

894
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,880
For you all to study well, get
a job and live bravely...

895
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,680
...I will get beaten up
how many ever times

896
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,840
Why are you talking like this?

897
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,480
What else to do!

898
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,600
Even if one of you realises my dream
I will be happy

899
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,160
What now!
You want us to study.

900
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,640
Right!
I will do it.

901
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,440
Tell me what to study

902
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,640
LAW!

903
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,440
Only then, you can talk for
the village proud and loud

904
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,800
From now on,
I am a Lawyer

905
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,960
PARIYERUM PERUMAL. BABL
with a line on top

906
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,960
Ok?

907
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,240
- Mother Promise?
- Mother Promise!

908
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,040
Wow! How many stories!

909
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,080
I went to school...

910
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,400
...cleared exams

911
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,960
Dad asked me to join Law
I did!

912
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,320
But you?!

913
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,080
Look

914
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,040
We have two English papers
this year

915
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,000
Only if you pass
you can become a Lawyer

916
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,960
What are you going to do?

917
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,920
I don't know

918
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,560
I have to struggle, break my head
and somehow crack it

919
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,320
If someone teaches you
will you learn?

920
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,160
I will sit at their feet and learn

921
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,160
Don't worry then

922
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,320
I will teach you English

923
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,120
Truly?

924
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,200
Mother Promise!

925
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,320
You want to become a Lawyer

926
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,520
I want to become an Angel

927
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,440
Angel?

928
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,120
Yes

929
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,280
The girls who taught you English
are your angels, right?

930
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,640
Then am I not one too?

931
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,160
You are an angel
From this minute on

932
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,240
Shall we go?

933
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,040
"She grew wings
To gather the sky"

934
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,400
"I exclaimed
Had no reason why!"

935
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,520
"You don't have to stand aside
A flower by the river will never dry"

936
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:35,280
"The rumble of the wind
Grows slowly, right now"

937
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:41,880
"I am not here on this shore
There is no way to get ashore"

938
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:47,280
"You are the one to take care of me"

939
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

940
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,160
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

941
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,200
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

942
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,240
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

943
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,280
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

944
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,440
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

945
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,600
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

946
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,080
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

947
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,640
"Look, how I have to hide my love"

948
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,880
"No other facade I have
to hide behind"

949
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,280
"My idiot brain
Wouldn't pause"

950
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,400
"I am threatening you
Why don't you hear!"

951
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,280
"One more beat!
My little heart will get caught"

952
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,680
"I am not here on this shore
There is no way to get ashore"

953
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,000
"You are the one
to take care of me"

954
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,760
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

955
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,840
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

956
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,000
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

957
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,000
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

958
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,920
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

959
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,040
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

960
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,280
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

961
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,960
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

962
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,160
Are we all there in your
list of angels?

963
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,760
Why do you look at her
for everything?

964
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,680
I am asking you, tell me

965
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,720
You are teacher

966
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,840
You are the 4th angel

967
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,000
Are you saying the truth?

968
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,320
Mother promise!

969
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,320
Yeah right!

970
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,880
Are there only 4 angels, or
will the 5th one also come?

971
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,200
If they do, then good

972
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,680
You wait and watch

973
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,600
10,000 angels will come for you

974
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,800
"The rain that stopped
Leaves behind a drop or two"

975
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,000
"Even after I left him
He drizzled into my thoughts"

976
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:09,080
"Like the hen who hesitates
As you open the coop out"

977
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:15,320
"Even if my mind is changed
He kept my heart with him"

978
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:21,160
"Words that I want to utter
Stuck in the pit of my throat"

979
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,800
"He has drawn the magic curtain
I am locked in him, forever"

980
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,520
"She grew wings
To gather the sky"

981
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,240
"I exclaimed
Had no reason why!"

982
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:46,520
"I am not here on this shore
There is no way to get ashore"

983
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,800
"You are the one
to take care of me"

984
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,640
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

985
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,640
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

986
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,840
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

987
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,920
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

988
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,800
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

989
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,920
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

990
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,040
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

991
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,520
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

992
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,200
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

993
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,400
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

994
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,400
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

995
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,680
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

996
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,560
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,480
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

998
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,600
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

999
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,600
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

1000
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,800
"Aroma of a flower in parched land"

1001
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,920
"The familiarity of this sweet girl"

1002
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,960
"Yours is the love that will protect me"

1003
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,160
"Little piece of cloud on a grass blade"

1004
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,280
"He has drawn those magic curtains"

1005
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,040
"Locking me up in his trance"

1006
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,440
"He has drawn those magic curtains"

1007
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,480
"Locking me up in his trance"

1008
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,680
"He has drawn those magic curtains"

1009
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,600
"Locking me up in his trance"

1010
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,800
"He has drawn those magic curtains"

1011
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,560
"Locking me up in his trance"

1012
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,040
Hey! What are you writing?

1013
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,640
I am writing 'Shlokas'

1014
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,680
For what?

1015
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,680
You have to pass your exams
at least this time, right?

1016
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,800
If you write 'Shlokas'
you will pass the exams, is it!

1017
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,160
That's my belief

1018
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,520
Ya right!

1019
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,000
Jo!

1020
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,280
JO!

1021
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,280
You look beautiful in this saree

1022
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,400
Wow!

1023
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,280
It took you so long to say this?

1024
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,640
I thought this long back

1025
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,000
But I was preparing seriously, right?

1026
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,800
Forgot to mention

1027
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,200
Yeah yeah!
I trust you

1028
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,560
Mother promise!

1029
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,160
Don't laugh. I have to study

1030
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,360
Ok! Study!

1031
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,360
Hey, it's time

1032
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,400
Enough
Go write the exam

1033
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,440
Alright

1034
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,080
- Bye. Hey!
- See you

1035
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,560
How tired your face looks!
Here

1036
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,120
Wash your face

1037
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,480
Karunkulam, RAMALAKSHMI!

1038
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,680
Your husband is calling

1039
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,360
(boys argue)

1040
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,880
Ey Meenakshi!

1041
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,160
Now you see how I felt?

1042
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,560
Aren't you angry?

1043
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,440
It's getting late to go to school
We need to take a bath, you guys come out

1044
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,320
Stop hurting me!

1045
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,040
Look there
The grandpa is drowning

1046
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,800
'School student drowns
trying to help an old man.'

1047
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,760
'People emotional'

1048
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,880
Hey! Kiddo!

1049
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,280
How many invitations do you want?

1050
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,440
Just one

1051
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,400
Just one?

1052
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,240
So many years in College
You have only one girl as your friend?

1053
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,680
Not a girl, a boy!
I talk about him often, remember?

1054
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,680
Pariyerum Perumal
Only for him

1055
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,640
Why only him?

1056
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,800
Invite all your friends
Let them all come

1057
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,840
No dad

1058
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,720
He is the only one I like a lot

1059
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,960
If he comes

1060
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,720
I can spend a lot of time with him

1061
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,520
I can introduce him to each of you
That's why

1062
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,200
Write down

1063
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,080
What is his name?

1064
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,640
PARIYERUM PERUMAL

1065
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,480
BABL with a line on top

1066
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,040
That's how he likes it

1067
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,280
An accent for an accent

1068
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,080
A 'ma' for a 'ma'

1069
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,400
However you do it
it doesn't tally

1070
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,760
Why didn't Jo come?

1071
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,880
Hey! Quiet!

1072
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,840
'La' for 'la'

1073
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,560
Bro, what are you doing?

1074
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,640
I am finding out what
relationship you and Jothi have

1075
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,080
Won't you understand?

1076
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,160
Why are you constantly doing this?

1077
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,480
Hey, why are you shouting?

1078
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,600
Did I say you guys are in love?

1079
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,840
I am just seeing

1080
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,320
What are the options
you have in this game?

1081
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,240
Friend, Love, Sister, Enemy

1082
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,120
- That's it no
- Yes

1083
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,360
My Jo is much more than all this

1084
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,040
Yeah! So, let's see what that is

1085
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,400
Will a game tell you that?

1086
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,080
Yes!

1087
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,080
Spell my name and hers let's see

1088
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,640
Spelling, right?
I will!

00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,480
I asked you to say it in English

1096
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,600
Hey! But I am writing it in Tamil

1097
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,160
Why are you so anti- Tamil?

1098
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,600
Don't do this anymore

1099
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,600
- Hey Pariya

1100
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,720

JO?

1102
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,880
Yes. She is waiting out

1103
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,280
Why is he running like this?

1104
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,760
Karthick, where are you going?

1105
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,640
Selvam, come here

1106
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,840
How come you have worn a silk saree?

1107
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,800
Hey, Idiot!

1108
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,800
This is silk cotton

1109
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,120
Looks like silk!

1110
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,000
I am telling you, right?

1111
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Ok, why didn't you come to class?

1112
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,240
Forget that
This is my cousin Selvi

1113
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,440
She insisted on seeing you
So I brought her here

1114
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,160
- Oh?
- Yes!

1115
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,240
- Hello, then!
- Hello!

1116
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,640
So, why didn't you come to class?

1117
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,720
Wait

1118
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,840
Talking non-stop

1119
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,760
I have things to say too

1120
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,080
Let me speak

1121
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,440
Alright! Speak

00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,160
My elder sister is getting married

1124
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,400
Your sister is that old?

1125
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:43,760
Listen!

1126
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,720
I have invited only you
in this whole college

1127
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,080
I haven't told my friends even

1128
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:48,760
Because...

1129
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,080
...I want you to be the
only surprise for my family

1130
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,560
You must come

1131
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,960
If you give any reasons
for not turning up

1132
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,160
That's it!

1133
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,920
Ok, I will leave now
Dad is waiting at the junction

1134
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,480
Okay!

Give me a good pant and shirt

1142
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,480
Pant and shirt?
Why?

1143
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,320
I need to attend
an important wedding

1144
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,680
Important wedding! Where?

Bro, I am going for
Jo's sister's wedding

1155
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,120
Why don't you come along?

1156
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Are you kidding me?

1157
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,480
She didn't even invite me

1158
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,240
I am not going with you

1159
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,360
Bro! Please!!

1160
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,800

Come Bro!

1162
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,360

1163
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,400

- Cut the call

1164
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,200
Hello!

1167
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,840
Come here

1168
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,480
Go home first

1169
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,360
Why, Pa?

1170
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,080
Your aunt is looking for her necklace

1171
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,200
Just go and check what happened

1172
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,600
Pa, Pariyan will come now

He will look for me

1177
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,080
Your aunt's 10 sovereign
gold chain is missing

1178
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,440
She is so worried

1179
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,120
You are my sweetheart, right?

1180
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:13,840
Listen to me

1181
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:14,800
I will take care of him

1182
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,800

- I will be with him. You go!
- Fine!

1184
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,960
Bring it safe

1185
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,760
Son,
You are?

1186
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,640
I am Jo's college friend

1187
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,560
Oh!

1188
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,600
You are that Pariyerum Perumal
BABL with a line on top?

1189
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,560
Yes!

1190
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,880
Jo has mentioned a lot about you

1191
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,320
I am Jo's father

1192
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,560
Oh! Ok, Pa

1193
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,240
We are all waiting for you
Why are you sitting here alone?

1194
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,800
No, Pa

1195
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,880

1196
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,160
Come, let's go

1197
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,480

Come

1199
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,680
Pa, where is the groom from?

1200
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,160
Right here, the next village

1201
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,280
He is our relative

1202
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,720
Oh! Where has Jo gone?

1203
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,160
She has gone home on an errand

1204
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,160
She will come

1205
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,240
She will come soon, right?

1206
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,600
She will!

1207
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,040
Don't be worried

1208
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,400
We are all here, right?

1209
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,760
When will she come?

1210
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,160
She will come!

1211
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,640
We own this marriage hall
Do you know?

1212
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,400
Yes!

1213
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,880
Jo has mentioned many times

1214
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,400
The loudmouth has said it all?

1215
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,600
Come!

1216
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,480
Pa...!

1217
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,000
Why are you scared?
Come in

1218
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,680
Sit

1219
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
What are you thinking about?
She will come!

1220
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,520
What an important guest you are!

1221
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,440
How could you be so shy?

1222
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,400
Gift is it?

1223
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,400
Give!

1224
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,640
Where are you from?

1225
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,040
Puliyankulam

1226
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,280
Puliyankulam?

1227
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,320
Where is it?

1228
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,720
On the Tirunelveli - Thiruchendur road
Right after Karunkulam

1229
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,320
Alright!

1230
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,520
What does your father do?

1231
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,520
Dad?

1232
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,800
Dad is...

1233
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,920
What?
Why are you struggling?

1234
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,080
Do you have a father at all?

1235
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,120
Yes!

1236
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,440
He owns a load cart

1237
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,360
- Is it?
- Yes

1238
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,080
Jo keeps saying your name so often

1239
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,520
Do you like her so much?

1240
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,920
Yeah. I do

1241
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,240
How much?

1242
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,120
A lot

1243
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,080
Lot meaning?!

1244
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,400

1246
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,640
Or THISSS much?

1247
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,240
Lots, Pa

1248
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,680
Open your hands and show me how much

1249
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,880
Filthy Dog!

1250
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,440
Hey!
Let him go!

1251
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,520
Don't beat him!

1252
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,600
Don't beat him!

1253
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,920
I will talk to him

1254
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,000
Let him go!

1255
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:37,960
DIE

1256
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,360
Uncle!
Let us go

1257
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,320
How dare he come here!

1258
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,120
Listen to me!

1259
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,440
He might die!

1260
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Stop it!

1261
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,920
Enough!

1262
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,960
Stop it!

1263
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,960
How dare you come to my house!

1264
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,440
Get out!

1265
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,920
I am going to kill you first!

1266
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,200
Die!

1267
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,520
What are you doing?

1268
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,280
How dare you!

1269
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,160
Drink my urine

1270
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,480
Drink it

1271
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,240
Drink it

1272
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:05,960
You came here, right?!

1273
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,040
Drink!

1274
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,080
Ey! Bose!

1275
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,160
What are you doing?!

1276
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:09,520
Pa!

1277
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,240
This isn't right!

1278
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,080
Let go off me

1279
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:11,720
Get out!

1280
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,880
I must do something
I must kill him

1281
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,720
Hey!

1282
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,760
Listen!

1283
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,080
Do you need all this?

1284
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,400
She is a kid!

1285
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,920
Will you come, if she asks you to?

1286
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,240
Who you are
Where you are from...

1287
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,800
...we know it all

1288
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,560
You both study together

1289
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,640
Does that make you equal?

1290
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,280
What is this?

1291
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,840
Can you have any kind of
relationship with her?

1292
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,280
From today, you don't
know my daughter!

1293
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,920
Otherwise they will slit your throat

1294
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,600
They will kill you and my daughter too

1295
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,440
I beg you!

1296
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,080
Please don't talk to my daughter anymore

1297
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,040
That is the only good option

1298
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,080
You...!

1299
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,800
Don't come out, immediately

1300
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,360
All my relatives are waiting outside

1301
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,920
If you come out now
they will chop you up!

1302
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,600
When the event is over,
after everybody goes home

1303
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,080
Runaway quietly
Just the way you came in

1304
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,720
Let him step out,
I will kill him

1305
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,680
Hey Bose Paandi

1306
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,800
We shouldn't let him go

1307
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,240
Look,
He has come

1308
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,920
- Hey
- What now?

1309
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,320
Go I said

1310
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,360
Let me go

1311
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,600
Let me go!

1312
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,400
We must do something to him

1313
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,600
We must kill him

1314
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,040
Go, I said

1315
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,080
Go

1316
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:49,760
What are you looking at?

1317
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,080
Leave

1318
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,600
Ey, why are you standing here?

1319
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,720
This is all because of you

1320
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,440
Thug!

1321
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,120
Go!

1322
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,000
Why are you hitting to them?

1323
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,440
It's nothing
Leave

1324
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,600
Intermission

1325
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,400
Hello!

1326
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,160
Do you recognise me?

1327
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,080
Tell me

1328
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,640
What happened?

1329
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,240
Where did you
go hurt yourself?

1330
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,600
Kabadi Tournament in my village.
Got hurt there.

1331
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,160
So, Sir didn't turn up
for the wedding

1332
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,040
Because he was busy playing

1333
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,400
Right?

1334
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,160
What arrogance!

1335
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,640
How many times I insisted
that you must come!

1336
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,600
None of that mattered to you!

1337
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,560
Now you tell me
you were playing?

1338
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,280
Look up at me!

1339
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,080
I invited only you in
this whole college

1340
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,400
To my father, brother, sister...

1341
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,840
...I had said so many
things about you

1342
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,800
We were all expecting you
You know that?

1343
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,280
Forget all that.
How many surprises I had for you!

1344
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,800
You tell me casually that
you were playing a tournament

1345
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,680
It's not like I didn't want to
But I couldn't come

1346
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,760
I beg you!

1347
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,960
Stop sounding so careless

1348
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,640
It didn't occur to you
that you ought to come

1349
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,760
Don't ever talk about this

1350
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,240
You took off for 10 days
without even informing!

1351
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,280
I am telling you now.

1352
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,200
I will talk to you
only when I feel like it

1353
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,480
I will also take off
without telling you

1354
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,240
Bye

1355
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,400
Ok!

1356
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,360
What do you mean?

1357
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,680
Ok?

1358
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,600
You have decided
to make me cry.

1359
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,600
Bye

1360
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,000
"A life breaking down
within closed doors"

1361
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,080
"A life charred down
As the sun comes out"

1362
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,440
"A life hunted down
By birds that chase"

1363
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,640
"A life trampled upon
Even on fertile land"

1364
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,840
"A life burning down
Even when it rains"

1365
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,920
"A life pressed down
By the happy people"

1366
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,080
"A life taken down
By the God himself"

1367
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,680
"A life that accepts its death"

1368
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,280
"WHO?"

1369
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,280
"AM I?"

1370
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,880
"WHAT..."

1371
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,120
"...AM I?"

1372
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,440
"You are light!"

1373
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,600
"What might I be?"

1374
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,360
"You are rain!"

1375
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:16,000
"What am I then?"

1376
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,880
"Who am I?"

1377
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:28,520
"Who am I?"

1378
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,520
"Who am I that trains chase
to mow down?"

1379
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,920
"Who am I that hangs dead from
blossoming trees?"

1380
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,280
"Who am I that floats up
dead in rivers?"

1381
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,680
"Who am I that died burning
inside my hut?"

1382
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,640
"The God your chariots refuse
Who am I?"

1383
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,640
"I drink water without touching you
Who am I?"

1384
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,680
"A village keeps me away with a wall
Who am I?"

1385
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,480
"I breathe my last in a shithole
Who am I?"

1386
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,960
"Who Am I?"

1387
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:56,640
"Who Am I?"

1388
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,920
"Some say I ruled..."

1389
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,160
"Some think I slaved"

1390
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,320
"Our hands that ploughed..."

1391
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,640
"Are the same that warred!"

1392
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:46,920
"In death, I turn blue
Who am I?"

1393
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,200
"Bury me. I float in blue sea
Who am I?"

1394
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,600
"In death, I turn blue
Who am I?"

1395
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:00,240
"Bury me and I float in blue sea
Who am I?"

1396
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:04,560
"In death, I turn blue
Who am I?"

1397
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,960
"Bury me. I float in blue sea
Who am I?"

1398
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,160
"In death, I turn blue
Who am I?"

1399
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:18,000
"Bury me. I float in blue sea
Who am I?"

1400
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,800
Hey! What is the problem?

1401
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,160
Why are you sitting here?

1402
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,320
Only because you asked I am
getting you this nonsense.

1403
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,520
Drink it and tell me what
problems you and Jo have. Ok?

1404
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,880
Hey!

1405
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,800
What happened to him?

1406
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,240
Let me ask!

1407
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,720
You drank, right?

1408
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,720
Now tell me why you didn't
attend the wedding.

1409
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,800
Bottle is empty!

1410
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,520
Tell me, why?

1411
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,040
Nothing happened!

1412
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,760
You just drank it

1413
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,040
It will take some time

1414
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:46,880
Tell me

1415
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,680
No!

1416
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,400
My head has to swirl like a
giant wheel

1417
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,200
Get me a drink like that

1418
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,480
Like a giant wheel?

1419
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,520
Yes!

1420
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,040
A drink like that?

1421
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,200
Soft drink is all he drank

1422
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,200
Now he wants more!

1423
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,640
Son, what is your problem!

1424
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,160
He got me this

1425
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,760
I drank it.
Why am I not feeling anything?

1426
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,200
How will this shit work?

1427
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,280
Drink this, you will get super high

1428
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,920
Look at me.
High in heaven!

1429
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,120
Son!

1430
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,040
Enough! I want some!

1431
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,880
Looks like the poor boy
is drinking for the first time!

1432
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,120
Why is he choking on water!

1433
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,800
Here, the giant wheel
you asked for.

1434
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,440
Ey!

1435
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,920
No!

1436
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,880
My head is swirling already

1437
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,880
What?

1438
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,320
Will you put me in a
bus to my village?

1439
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,200
You are high, is it?

1440
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,800
Come to class.
Give your attendance and then go.

1441
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,080
Not to the College

1442
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,760
I am high

1443
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,520
Put me in a town bus

1444
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,880
Oh, sir is high is it?

1445
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,920
Don't go around telling anyone.

1446
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,600
I will take care of everything
Let's go!

1447
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,520
Hey!

1448
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,600
You and Jo have some problem.

1449
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,440
You are hiding it from me!

1450
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,560
Let me see when you
will talk about it

1451
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,240
Hey, come here

1452
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,880
So...

1453
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,920
You think what you
drank is liquor?

1454
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,920
Huh?

1455
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,560
For a drop of liquor

1456
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,320
I had mixed a bottle
of soft drink

1457
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,240
You drink that and
act like a hero of pathos!

1458
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,800
- Soft drink?
- Yes!

1459
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:58,160
But my head is reeling!
I am feeling giddy

1460
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,240
If you keep irritating me...

1461
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,560
...I will tear open your mouth

1462
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,360
Mother Promise bro!

1463
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,960
Mother Promise?!

1464
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,200
Or is it because what the
guy next to me gave

1465
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,920
What?
That guy gave you something?

1466
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,120
Hmmm

1467
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,280
And you drank that?

1468
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,320
Hmmm

1469
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,800
Blow, let's see!

1470
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,320
(blows)

1471
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,680
Damn! Cheap liquor.

1472
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,480
Someone has given you
the 60 rupees liquor

1473
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,520
Why did you drink that?

1474
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,240
Why didn't you tell me this?

1475
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,880
How much did he give you?

1476
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,880
- Anto
- 4 or 5?

1477
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,400
Idiot, will you drink anything
anyone gives!

1478
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,200
ANAND

1479
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,240
I am right here, Teacher!

1480
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,120
Pariyerum Perumal....

1481
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,720
(mumbles)
I am here!

1482
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,920
Pariyerum Perumal!

1483
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,520
Teacher, he hasn't come today

1484
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,760
He hasn't?

1485
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,720
Kalaivaanan

1486
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,760
Yes, Madam

1487
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,400
Saravanan

1488
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,720
I have told her
you are absent!

1489
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,520
Please stay down

1490
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,720
If you get up,
I will get caught

1491
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,440
What did you say?

1492
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,920
I told her you are absent.
Just lie down!

1493
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,760
Sankaralingam

1494
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,960
Why did you say that?

1495
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,200
Ey! Don't irritate me.
Just lie down like that

1496
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,480
Why, shouldn't I come?

1497
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,400
He is here Madam

1498
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,560
Is it wrong if I do?

1499
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,360
I am here!

1500
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,120
You tell me, bro
Is it wrong, if I come?

1501
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,120
What is that noise there?

1502
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:09,720
Nothing teacher!

1503
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,280
Pariyerum Perumal!

1504
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,520
Hey!

1505
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,320
He said you didn't come!

1506
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,520
Why?

1507
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,000
Is it wrong if I come?

1508
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,280
Why is he talking like this?

1509
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,280
He is drunk, Madam.

1510
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,080
- I must ask this!
- Are you drunk?

1511
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,720
Please someone answer...!
Shouldn't I come?

1512
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,920
Take him out!

1513
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,040
They are saying
it is wrong for me to come

1514
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,120
They are saying that!

1515
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:33,720
Get out with him

1516
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,920
Hey
Who said that?

1517
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,040
I am telling you now!

1518
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,640
You can be anywhere, anytime

1519
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,960
Come!

1520
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,280
Right away, Teacher!

1521
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,680
Get out of the class

1522
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:43,960
Get out!

1523
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,800
Shouldn't I go there?

1524
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,680
Get out, I said!

1525
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,000
Teacher, why are you screaming?
I am taking him out!

1526
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,600
IS IT WRONG FOR ME TO GO THERE?

1527
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,040
How much ever you scream
no one will understand you

1528
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,200
Don't shout Teacher!
I will break your head open

1529
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,000
Come

1530
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:56,520
GET OUT

1531
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,120
- Good Jo didn't come today
- That's why he is doing this

1532
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,480
He said he will become
Dr. Ambedkar

1533
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,280
Did you say that?

1534
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,600
What is the complaint
against you?

1535
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,920
I am asking you!

1536
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,640
He came drunk to class sir.

1537
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,720
He came drunk to class

1538
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,440
Did you come drunk?

1539
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,160
Out!

1540
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,040
I want to meet his
father tomorrow

1541
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,120
I will tell him, sir.

1542
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,280
Who is that?

1543
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:56,960
I don't know

1544
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,800
- Go see!
- Let me go.

1545
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,080
This old man looks interesting

1546
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,880
Should we take him?

1547
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,600
Who do you want to meet?

1548
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,280
We want to meet Sivaji Sankar Sir!

1549
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,560
For the college?
To act?

1550
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,760
Yes Sir!

1551
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,240
- Hey, Sivaji
- Ya!

1552
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,280
See you have a booking!

1553
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,360
Come take your advance.

1554
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,000
Yes, coming!

1555
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,960
Advance?

1556
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,440
Looks like they are going
to fleece us

1557
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,360
You suggested this right!
Pay up.

1558
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,520
What?

1559
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,400
Here comes the King of acting!

1560
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,680
Which college?

1561
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,480
Law College

1562
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,000
- Law College?
- Yes

1563
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,200
Son, I can't do it

1564
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,640
They ask tricky questions.

1565
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,520
No! They won't, Sir

1566
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,000
He came drunk to class

1567
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,000
That's the problem

1568
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,800
If you come...

1569
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,080
...they will yell at him in front of you
That's all.

1570
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,000
Look here, mason!

1571
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,440
The shame that drunkards
like we have to carry

1572
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,440
Exactly Sir!

1573
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,400
Son!

1574
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,240
If you had called me for love or fight
I wouldn't have come

1575
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,840
Because it is about drinking
I am going with you

1576
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,200
Two bottles of alcohol is the fee

1577
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:46,920
Is that ok?

1578
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,000
Two bottles?

1579
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,160
For one person?

1580
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,800
The head mason is sending me with you!

1581
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,280
So?

1582
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,480
I have to give him a bottle.

1583
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,240
Isn't it the 'dharma' of drinking?

1584
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,800
Two bottles for us to be onboard!

1585
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,920
If not walk on.

1586
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,800
- Sir, I will get you two bottles
- Ok!

1587
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,560
I will put on my shirt!

1588
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,960
Come soon

1589
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,600
Son!

1590
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,960
You never mentioned your
father's name to me.

1591
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,040
Selvaraj

1592
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,120
From Puliyankulam village

1593
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,880
Oh! Selvaraj

1594
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,200
What does he do?

1595
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,880
He owns a load cart

1596
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,400
What kind of a person is he?

1597
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,960
Is he an angry man?

1598
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,120
Or an innocent one?

1599
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,720
Or is he a cheapskate?

1600
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,880
Also, does he beat you up?

1601
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,800
Only if you give this information
I can act, right?

1602
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:31,840
Dad...

1603
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,440
...is a very angry man

1604
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,840
If he knows that I have done
something wrong, that's it!

1605
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,240
He will beat me to pulp

1606
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,760
He looks very majestic

1607
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,480
Like the character from
'Thanga Pathakkam'

1608
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,800
This is enough

1609
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,840
Wait and watch my performance!

1610
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,240
Sit please!

1611
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,080
Are you his father?

1612
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:00,920
Yes, Sir!

1613
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,960
What do you do?

1614
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,160
I own load carts

1615
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,520
Did he tell you anything?

1616
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,600
No sir.
He said you sent for me

1617
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,280
How will he say anything?

1618
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,320
He has come drunk
to the class.

1619
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,480
What is it, Sir?

1620
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,760
He has come to the
College drunk.

1621
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,320
Liquor! Liquor!

1622
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,160
Hey...Hey...

1623
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,280
Stop! Don't beat him

1624
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,960
Is it for you
I am making you educate?

1625
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,640
Is this how you beat
up a boy this age?

1626
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,360
What kind of a father are you?

1627
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,080
Who?

1628
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,560
Who told you I am his dad?

1629
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,320
He is not my son

1630
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,240
From the moment
his tongue touched liquor...

1631
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,160
...he has ceased to be my son

1632
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,240
He is an orphan now.

1633
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,200
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

1634
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,560
I don't even tolerate
the word "liquor"

1635
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,960
How could he be my son?

1636
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,040
No way, Sir

1637
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,360
Why are you hitting him so hard?

1638
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:44,880
Sir!

1639
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:45,800
Do me a favour

1640
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,560
Throw him out of the
institution now

1641
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,120
Wait...!

1642
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,840
You can even burn him

1643
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,080
Burn him!

1644
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,640
I don't have any problem

1645
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,600
Don't ever send for me again

1646
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,080
Sir...

1647
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,160
Come here for a minute
Let's talk

1648
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,320
What is there to talk?

1649
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,080
I should just hang myself
for having a son like this

1650
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,720
Let me hang myself

1651
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,800
Let me!

1652
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,280
Just, let me.

1653
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,680
So much rage!

1654
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,440
A son like you
for a father like that

1655
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,120
I forgive you because of his anger

1656
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,680
Go

1657
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,480
Sign the apology letter

1658
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,000
What's up?

1659
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,400
Did I beat him up badly?

1660
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,520
Why is he sulking?

1661
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,880
Nothing like that

1662
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,600
Don't mistake me.

1663
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:38,920
Only if you exaggerate
they will quit bothering you

1664
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,960
That's why

1665
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,720
See!

1666
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,400
Doesn't it feel wonderful to hear?

1667
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,800
That's our greatness!

1668
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,640
Why are you pouring
only two glasses?

1669
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,160
Anna, he will never
drink after this.

1670
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,960
The whole problem was
because he drank right?

1671
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,560
That is his first...

1672
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,320
...and will be his last time
to touch liquor

1673
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,120
Let us drink.
Here

1674
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,320
That's why he got scared

1675
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,400
Yes!

1676
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,880
Anna, cheers!

1677
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,320
CHEERS!

1678
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,800
Listen, Pariya

1679
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,080
I forgot to tell you something

1680
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,200
After I finished my performance...

1681
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,560
...a girl pleaded with me for you

1682
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,120
Her name is a...single syllable...

1683
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,760
- Single syllable?
- Yes!

1684
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,480
JO?

1685
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,080
Yes

1686
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:21,560
I thought so

1687
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,200
Jo?

1688
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:22,800
Ya!

1689
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,920
What did she say?

1690
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,240
Pa! Pa!

1691
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,280
You are Pariyan's dad, right?

1692
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,680
Yes

1693
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,720
I am Jo, pa

1694
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,800
Pariyan's friend

1695
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,040
So?

1696
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,960
Pa, Pariyan wouldn't
have done anything wrong

1697
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,520
Someone has wrongly accused him

1698
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,040
Please pa
Don't beat him.

1699
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,960
Pa

1700
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,600
I take your word.

1701
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,760
I will take care

1702
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,440
I promise on my god 'Sudalai'

1703
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,400
She had tears filled in
her eyes when she spoke

1704
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,680
I think…

1705
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,440
...she likes you a lot

1706
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,680
Get up and go

1707
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,240
Why did he get so tensed?

1708
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,520
So it is love, is it?

1709
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,200
He'll break your head

1710
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,440
He is going somewhere
Go with him

1711
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,440
Let him go!

1712
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,640
I always hang out with them
I still don't understand

1713
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,200
If I ask him he yells at me

1714
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,160
She just breaks down and weeps

1715
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,520
What can I do?

1716
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,160
Why are you sitting on my bench?

1717
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,400
Get up and go back

1718
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,880
Why argue over a bench?

1719
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,240
There are so many seats empty
Go sit there

1720
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,520
Should I obey you?

1721
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,440
Get up and go back

1722
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,720
Why are you ordering me around?

1723
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,640
Is your name written on this bench?

1724
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,600
Hey!

1725
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,440
Yes, it is written!
Look!

1726
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,680
Sword

1727
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,840
KSL

1728
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,040
Now go!

1729
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,240
I won't go

1730
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,400
If you need to,
go sit at the back

1731
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,840
You won't get up?

1732
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,160
NO!

1733
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,520
When you were caught alone
that day

1734
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,640
I should have just slit your throat

1735
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,960
I sympathised and let you go

1736
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,760
That's why you are arrogant

1737
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:47,840
What did you say?

1738
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,280
Why, couldn't you hear?

1739
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,800
They shut you up in a room
and peed on your face right?

1740
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,480
I was talking about that

1741
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,280
Get up, will you?

1742
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,760
Or should I also pee on you?

1743
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,760
Leave him

1744
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,480
Come

1745
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,640
Leave me

1746
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,640
Lingu, stop this!

1747
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,320
You are doing unnecessary things now

1748
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,800
Who are you to send me back?

1749
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,320
Why should I go back?

1750
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,600
I will be in the front from now on

1751
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,200
How dare you touch him!

1752
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,880
I will kick you!

1753
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,760
Why are you beating him?

1754
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,880
Why are you doing this?

1755
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,240
Move away!

1756
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,280
You are always doing this
I would have to get involved then

1757
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,080
Go

1758
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,840
Come, let's see
who is up?

1759
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,960
Won't you listen to me?
Move along!

1760
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,960
Bro, let's complain to the Principal

1761
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,320
Why should I complain?

1762
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,680
What happens to my pride then?

1763
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,520
I know...

1764
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,320
...what to do with him

1765
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,560
I will take care of it

1766
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,240
What happened to you?

1767
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,400
What do you mean?

1768
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,040
Why did you beat him up?

1769
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,440
I am asking YOU!

1770
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,360
Isn't he your caste too?
Go ask him

1771
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,600
My caste?!

1772
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,600
I will break open your head

1773
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,640
Do I care what caste
you belong to?

1774
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,080
Tell me why you beat him up

1775
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,640
I will beat him up too

1776
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,280
Why are you losing
your energy over him?

1777
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,080
Why would he tell us anything?

1778
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,520
He has become a big man!

1779
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,880
Big thug!

1780
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,440
That's why he is doing all this

1781
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,120
How would he tell us anything!

1782
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,920
You didn't answer me right.

1783
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,200
She is asking you
now, answer her

1784
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,520
Bro, there is no need to
tell everybody everything.

1785
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,160
Who are you referring to?

1786
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,000
She is going

1787
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:54,600
Let her go

1788
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,920
Go, you idiot!

1789
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,680
JO

1790
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,200
Who is it whistling
in the middle of nowhere?

1791
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,400
Will you stop the bus
or should I jump out?

1792
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,120
Give way
Step down for a second

1793
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,640
Take him!

1794
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,240
Who are you?

1795
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,400
Hold his legs
Don't let it go

1796
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,840
Don't leave him

1797
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,960
Bring him

1798
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,560
- Let go of me
- Come on

1799
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,520
Don't let go of him

1800
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,360
(Indistinct chatter)

1801
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,880
Look, he is running away
Go and catch him

1802
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,640
Hey, my chain is missing

1803
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,160
Go, look for it

1804
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,240
Where did you miss it?

1805
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,600
Punch on his mouth

1806
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,280
Don't let him go

1807
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,440
Come on

1808
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,040
Why did you let him enter the village?

1809
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,680
He has escaped

1810
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,480
"So many thrashings
you threw on our backs!"

1811
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:15,280
"You will receive it in leaps and bounds
That is our pay-back!"

1812
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:19,200
"We are the people of "Nandhan"
We will take over your throne"

1813
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:22,960
"That day
Is not far away!"

1814
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:27,040
"We are the people of "Nandhan"
We will take over your throne"

1815
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:30,720
"That day
Is not far away!"

1816
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,480
"Our cry of victory will be heard
Our light will fill up this world!"

1817
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,080
"We the proletariats will fight back"

1818
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,160
Hello Lawyer, coming from this side?

1819
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,600
"Do the waves ever tire!"

1820
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,480
What?
They hit you?

1821
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,600
Why didn't you
tell me earlier, idiot!

1822
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,000
Which village are they from?

1823
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,720
I don't know
They got in from the west.

1824
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,040
Why did they beat you up?

1825
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,280
I got into a fight in College

1826
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,720
Maybe he sent these guys

1827
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,040
Where is he from?

1828
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:56,440
Near Ambasamudram

1829
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,600
Ambasamudram?

1830
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,320
Then he must have sent these
people to threaten you.

1831
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,080
Aren't some of our boys
studying with you?

1832
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,480
Yeah yeah...
Many, actually.

1833
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,280
Then, you take their support

1834
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,200
If they refuse...

1835
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,920
...I will get
some people from here

1836
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,280
No!

1837
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,920
I will take care of it

1838
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,160
Son...

1839
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:35,960
Son...

1840
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,520
Come here

1841
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,720
Grandpa!

1842
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,440
Are you going to college?

1843
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,400
Yes

1844
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,600
What are you doing here?

1845
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,240
I came till Siruvaikundam

1846
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,120
Are you from here?

1847
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,640
Yes. Puliankulam

1848
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,040
- I thought you were from Siruvaikundam
- No

1849
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,840
- Puliyankulam boy is it!
- Yes!

1850
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,240
Ok

1851
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,680
Why are you getting up?

1852
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,200
I have been sitting for too long...

1853
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,240
...my knees hurt

1854
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,640
- You sit.
- Ok

1855
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,960
Sending henchmen...
They have become that audacious

1856
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,680
We shouldn't let this go

1857
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,320
We should make them
run for their lives

1858
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,840
Just show me who they are

1859
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,760
I will take care of the rest

1860
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,800
What?

1861
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,200
Okay

1862
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:25,640
Hey, Pariya!

1863
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,280
Aren't you coming to the class?

1864
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,280
Go on now!
He will come

1865
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,760
I wasn't talking to you

1866
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,800
Bro! You go ahead
I will come.

1867
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,120
I have my doubts
about this guy

1868
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:40,200
Bro, don't say that.

1869
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:41,640
He is my good friend

1870
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:49,320
Ok, I will leave.

1871
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,280
Where are you going?

1872
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,760
We are all sitting here for you
You are running away

1873
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,600
No Bro.

1874
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,160
I don't remember who exactly it was

1875
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,320
I will tell you when I remember

1876
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:56,960
Ok?

1877
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,280
Ok
Take care.

1878
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,800
Looks like he is scared!

1879
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:00,720
Hey!

1880
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,120
He is from Puliyankulam

1881
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,560
Don't under-estimate him

1882
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,720
Wait and watch

1883
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,840
He might stand alone and fight

1884
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,240
- "Pariyan"
- Tell me now bro!

1885
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,720
Should I put an atom bomb or a knife?

1886
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,360
Put a rock on my head

1887
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,720
- Did you come running to write this?
- Yes!

1888
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,840
Hey!
Move it

1889
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,840
Pariya!

1890
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,240
How come you are sitting
on the second bench?

1891
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,840
I will be ahead from now on!

1892
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,000
All that's fine.

1893
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,800
Why do I hear so many
complaints about you?

1894
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,760
What happened to you?

1895
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:06,960
You were very well-behaved

1896
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:07,480
OK!

1897
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,880
Come to the staff room after class.

1898
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,880
I need to talk to you.
Ok?

1899
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,120
Sit now.

1900
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,280
What's up?

1901
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,360
PARIYERUM PERUMAL BABL
with a line on top

1902
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,520
Nowhere to be seen?

1903
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,680
Nothing like that, Teacher

1904
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,440
Nothing is it.

1905
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,240
You come drunk to class!

1906
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,200
That was meant for fun...
Turned out like this

1907
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,320
Sorry

1908
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,120
Why do I need your sorry?

1909
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,200
It's ok, just keep it

1910
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,640
Enough of this sarcasm

1911
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,960
What is the problem
between you and her?

1912
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,040
I don't see you both together at all

1913
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,040
Nothing like that!

1914
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,040
Aren't we sitting together now?

1915
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:35,880
Hello!

1916
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,640
Are you kidding me?
Be careful

1917
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,840
You went to a kabadi match
instead of her sister's wedding?

1918
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,200
Why are you glaring at her?

1919
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,600
I didn't hear about it from her.

1920
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,800
Out of all of us
she invited only you

1921
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,760
That's why I am asking

1922
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,480
That's what I want to know too
Why was I alone invited?

1923
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,720
She must have thought
you are enough

1924
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,400
That's what
Why only me?

1925
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,600
Hey!

1926
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,040
Are you dumb?

1927
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,920
Don't you understand
that she loves you?

1928
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,960
Why don't you like Jo?

1929
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,400
Teacher!

1930
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,480
She is MY Jo!

1931
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,240
What is your problem then?

1932
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,160
You pretend like you are
ignorant of her love

1933
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,600
Why?
Should this only mean romantic love?

1934
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,200
Can't she be my good friend?

1935
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,360
Can't she be my dead dog Karuppi?

1936
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,280
Ok, leave all this aside

1937
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,720
Can't she be the
tiny ray of hope that remains for me!

1938
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,360
Does it mean you don't love her?

1939
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,560
After all that I said, if
you can't understand it

1940
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:37,680
No one here will understand

1941
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,040
Let it go

1942
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,360
Hey!

1943
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,800
Open the door

1944
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:11,120
Open the door
Who has locked the door?

1945
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,800
Have you gone mad?

1946
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,240
YES SIR!
I have gone mad

1947
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,600
What happened to you?

1948
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,640
You are behaving oddly

1949
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,480
They have sent for your dad again

1950
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:37,840
Where will I go look for that actor?

1951
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,120
You don't have to go in search of anyone

1952
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,320
I will bring my own father

1953
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,280
Your dad?

1954
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,400
You didn't want to bring him!

1955
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,400
I want to now!

1956
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,880
I want my father

1957
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,480
I will bring him

1958
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,840
Really!

1959
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,280
Really. I need my father from now

1960
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:56,680
"With our praise spreading all over"

1961
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,480
"Say it...Say it loud!"

1962
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:03,640
"As I start singing here"

1963
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:09,880
"My mother, you beauty, you wise one!"

1964
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:14,480
"We let her fly and searching now
Where is our dear angel?"

1965
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,520
"With our praise spreading all over
As I start singing here"

1966
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:42,320
"With our praise spreading all over
As I start singing here"

1967
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:46,040
"My mother, you beauty, you wise one!"

1968
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,760
"We let her fly and searching now
Where is our dear angel?"

1969
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,360
"My mother, you beauty, you wise one!"

1970
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:57,160
"We let her fly and searching now
Where is our dear angel?"

1971
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,920
"You came to study in school
You even looked cool"

1972
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,720
"You came to study in school
You even looked cool"

1973
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,280
"Before you could graduate
My precious wise one"

1974
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:12,080
"You flew away, midway
My gem, my dear one"

1975
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:15,880
"Before you could graduate
My precious wise one"

1976
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,880
"You flew away, midway
My gem, my dear one"

1977
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,520
"You held my hand
Narrating a million stories"

1978
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:47,280
"You held my hand
Narrating a million stories"

1979
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:50,720
"Before you could complete them
My precious wise one"

1980
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,720
"You dissolved in the ocean of tears
My gem, my dear one"

1981
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:58,120
"Before you could complete them
My precious wise one"

1982
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:02,640
"You dissolved in the ocean of tears
My gem, my dear one"

1983
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,560
"With the anklets 'koochie kooing'"

1984
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,200
"Jingle! Jangle!
Jingle! Jangle!"

1985
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,800
"With the anklets 'koochie kooing'
You called me like a child"

1986
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,560
"With the anklets 'koochie kooing'
You called me like a child"

1987
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,160
"Before I could embrace your warmth
My precious wise one"

1988
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:32,040
"You disappeared like a mirage
My gem, my dear one"

1989
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,680
"Before I could embrace your warmth
My precious wise one"

1990
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,600
"You disappeared like a mirage
My gem, my dear one"

1991
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:02,440
"Washing your hands, after food
Saying you would go to the fair"

1992
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:06,120
"Washing your hands, after food
Saying you would go to the fair"

1993
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,880
"You went my precious one"

1994
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:13,600
"Why haven't you returned?
My gem, my dear one"

1995
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:17,360
"You went my precious one"

1996
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:21,080
"Why haven't you returned?
My gem, my dear one"

1997
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:24,600
"Why haven't you returned?
My gem, my dear one"

1998
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:28,680
"Why haven't you returned?
My gem, my dear one"

1999
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:57,120
"Puliyankulam Selvarasu is
no less to anyone"

2000
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,640
"Look at that walk!"

2001
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:22,760
Dad...

2002
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,960
Pa...

2003
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:26,800
What happened Son?

2004
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,560
Why have you come here?

2005
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,760
To see you

2006
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,080
About what?

2007
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,240
They sent for you in my College

2008
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:33,160
That's why

2009
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,200
To the College?
Why take me there?

2010
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,560
Take your mother, Son

2011
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,960
They sent for the father.
You come with me

2012
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,320
- What is this?
- Come, Pa

2013
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,920
My dad

2014
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,040
We want to meet the principal

2015
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,280
Dad?

2016
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:11,200
Let me ask him

2017
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,600
They want to meet your dad first

2018
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:20,480
Dad...

2019
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,960
You go in first.
I will wait here.

2020
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:22,640
Son...

2021
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,040
I can talk without fear right?

2022
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,640
That's how you must talk.

2023
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,080
- Go
- Alright.

2024
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,440
Have you enquired all the students?

2025
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,640
Yes, sir.

2026
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,720
Take care

2027
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,240
Hello Sir!

2028
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,440
Hello

2029
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,560
Sir, who are you?

2030
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,880
I am Pariyerum Perumal's father

2031
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,000
Pariyerum Perumal's father!

2032
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,760
Just last week,
another man came and beat him up

2033
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,960
Who is he then?

2034
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,440
Sir, I don female roles and dance

2035
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,840
He must have felt ashamed to say this
and brought someone else

2036
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,560
Is that wrong?

2037
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,200
He commits bigger mistakes than this.

2038
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,800
Can I tear his admission slip?

2039
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,880
Sir, you tear what you have to

2040
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,280
Whatever it is...

2041
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:06,640
...just have a word with him
before you do

2042
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:08,840
Sir

2043
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,960
He is not going to get what we say

2044
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,120
That's why...

2045
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:13,400
...he has changed his father.

2046
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,200
Let us call him and enquire

2047
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,720
Ok Sir!

2048
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:17,640
You can leave

2049
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,360
We will talk to your son

2050
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,560
Is this why you called me
all the way here?

2051
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:24,080
I was worried

2052
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,360
Alright!
I will leave then

2053
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,240
I will ask my son to come

2054
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,440
What happened, Pa?

2055
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,760
They got scared of me

2056
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,600
They want you to come

2057
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:39,640
Ok. You go

2058
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,440
Anand is waiting out.
You be with him

2059
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,560
- Sir!
- Come in

2060
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:50,000
Pariyerum Perumal BABL
with a line on top

2061
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:51,120
What are you looking at?

2062
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,800
I have told everything about you

2063
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,360
Is this your father?

2064
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:55,840
Yes, Sir

2065
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,080
You have such an innocent dad

2066
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,280
Why did you bring someone else then?

2067
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,040
Why are you asking him all that?

2068
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,400
Just suspend him

2069
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,840
Gopal Sir

2070
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,920
Wait out for sometime

2071
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,920
Do you know something?

2072
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:17,440
My father mends shoes on the road

2073
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,560
I am his son

2074
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,120
Your Principal!

2075
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,760
Never! Ever...

2076
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,280
...change your father

2077
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,200
We know you didn't enter
the women's toilet

2078
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:31,800
We also know who pushed you in

2079
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,400
I knew too!

2080
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:37,640
They chased me around
like a pig

2081
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,560
Did I run and hide?

2082
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:43,880
I understood what was important
and studied like a maniac

2083
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,160
Those who wanted to silence me then...

2084
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,280
...are folding their hands in respect now

2085
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,520
I say this after meeting your father

2086
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,800
In spite of everything
happening around you...

2087
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,120
...you will win one day
Just like I did!

2088
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,160
Bear this in mind

2089
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:01,680
And do whatever you want to

2090
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,600
Go

2091
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,840
Go

2092
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,280
Go

2093
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,960
Why are you saying this to him?

2094
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,440
He is going to pick up a fight now

2095
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:12,920
Let him!

2096
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,600
At least he won't hang himself.
Let him die fighting!

2097
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,280
You think we can change those guys?

2098
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,480
- We can't sir
- Then?

2099
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,480
Why are you silencing this guy?

2100
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,360
Hey!

2101
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,520
Who is that sitting there
like a **?

2102
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,880
Don't you know?

2103
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,400
He is Pariyan's real father

2104
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,200
Father?

2105
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,040
Daddy?

2106
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:41,920
Are you serious?

2107
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,320
Ya...Don't you know?

2108
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:47,000
A ** father!
He still has so much pride, eh?

2109
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:48,640
Where are you guys going?

2110
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,800
Hey folks where are you going?

2111
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:50,600
We will just take a look and come

2112
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,560
Picking up a fight eh?

2113
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,520
They will pick up a brawl with Pariyan!

2114
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:54,880
By the way, where is he?

2115
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,880
Saw his bun?

2116
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,720
Oye!

2117
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:05,760
Who are you?
Why are you sitting here?

2118
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,320
I am...
Pariyan's dad

2119
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,640
Dad...?

2120
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:11,880
- What happened?
- No problem.

2121
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,000
It's all done

2122
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,080
Where is dad?

2123
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,000
Why are you asking me?

2124
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,080
Didn't he come with you?

2125
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,000
Bro! I sent him
because you were here

2126
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,880
I went to take a leak

2127
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,040
Why did you leave him alone?

2128
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:21,680
Look at his hair

2129
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,920
I am Pariyan's father, truly

2130
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,520
Yeah, yeah!
Let's see if you are the father or mother

2131
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,120
Don't touch me

2132
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:25,640
Show me

2133
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,720
Don't touch me

2134
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,800
Let me go

2135
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:28,600
Leave me

2136
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,200
Lift this

2137
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:31,600
Let go off my dhoti

2138
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,400
Raising your hand

2139
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:33,120
Leave me

2140
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:34,400
Raising your hand is it...

2141
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:35,760
Show me

2142
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:39,160
Seems he is getting angry

2143
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,280
Why are you getting worked up?
He must be standing here somewhere

2144
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,200
Hey! Look!

2145
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,520
I beg you!

2146
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:47,880
Do it

2147
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,840
APPAAAA...

2148
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:52,400
Dai!

2149
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,640
Let him go!

2150
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,800
DAI!

2151
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,040
What happened in college yesterday?

2152
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,880
Nothing

2153
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:44,880
Nothing happened is it?

2154
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:47,280
Nothing is it?
Nothing?

2155
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:48,080
You idiot!

2156
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:49,200
Don't you have any sense?

2157
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,200
How many times to tell you!

2158
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:51,640
Why are you beating him?

2159
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,840
What do you mean why?

2160
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,240
He is creating unnecessary problems

2161
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:54,960
Idiot!

2162
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,440
What do you mean?

2163
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,120
That boy who came for
the wedding, remember?

2164
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,440
We chased him away, right?

2165
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,480
After that, he didn't come in our way

2166
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,120
He keeps picking up fights with him

2167
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,760
If he picks up a fight,
you will hit our boy, is it?

2168
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,000
What do you want me to do?

2169
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,600
He didn't just stop with him

2170
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:14,080
Yesterday, his father had come to college

2171
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:17,400
He has removed his dhoti, shamed him
and made him run naked

2172
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:18,600
What did you do?

2173
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,720
Why are you asking him?
Ask me!

2174
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,720
My daughter says
They beat up his father.

2175
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,040
Come let's go visit him

2176
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:27,760
He is going to make her do things
that she doesn't want to do

2177
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:28,880
She knows everything

2178
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,000
She is just pretending

2179
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,200
Nonsense

2180
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,920
She told me clearly

2181
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,840
Sankaralingam has mistaken that boy
and is picking a fight with him every day

2182
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,080
She cried

2183
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,400
She cried?

2184
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,040
Huh!
Why did she cry?

2185
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:42,400
Why did she cry?

2186
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,520
She thinks the world of him!

2187
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,080
That's why she cried!

2188
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,840
Do you all know something?

2189
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,080
Do you?

2190
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:50,840
She follows him like a dog

2191
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,160
Like a dog!

2192
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,240
Someday...

2193
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,600
...she is going to take him and elope

2194
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:58,640
That day all your pride will go
down the drain

2195
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,960
We all just have to hang ourselves

2196
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,200
Then you will know
if I was right or wrong

2197
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:07,040
Wait!

2198
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,240
Sit

2199
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,480
I said sit!

2200
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,560
Sit, let's talk

2201
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:20,960
Hey!

2202
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:22,840
Come

2203
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,440
Uncle's calling you, right?

2204
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,400
Come

2205
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:28,360
Sit

2206
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:33,640
Hey!

2207
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,800
What is this you are talking about?

2208
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:39,880
That boy is keeping away from her

2209
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,640
But she is following him
like a mad woman

2210
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:45,160
Today she is saying
she wants to go see his father

2211
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:47,480
I have a feeling
we are going to lose her

2212
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:53,160
Is that why she cried so much?

2213
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,680
She has ruined us!

2214
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,760
What do we do now?

2215
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:08,960
Let's finish him off.

2216
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,320
Hey

2217
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,520
What if we do something in haste
and it goes wrong?

2218
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,040
What will go wrong?

2219
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,480
Nothing will.

2220
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:20,320
We have someone who
will do this secretly

2221
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:22,880
Who is it?

2222
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,640
Mastry Nittam's grandson

2223
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,800
Your dad is unwell.
That's why we are shaving your head

2224
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,120
Don't cry

2225
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,400
Is this the street?

2226
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:51,280
Yes

2227
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:52,960
Turn at the end of the street

2228
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:53,920
Uncle!

2229
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,680
We can trust that old man right?

2230
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:56,440
Hey

2231
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,960
If he misses his target,
he will end his own life.

2232
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,080
She won't go with that guy anymore, right?

2233
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:09,240
No she won't

2234
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,480
I shaved her head

2235
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,160
So don't be scared

2236
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,760
Hey! Big man!

2237
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:17,520
So long huh?
Are you good?

2238
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,480
I am good.

2239
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:19,480
You?

2240
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:22,160
My trowels and squares
are taking care of me, just fine

2241
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:23,040
Then?

2242
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:24,640
After a long time...
Tell me!

2243
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:25,800
We need to kill a rooster

2244
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:26,760
- Rooster?
-Yes

2245
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,480
- Whose hen is it?
- Ours.

2246
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:30,000
- This is my nephew
- Hello!

2247
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,360
He has come for his sister

2248
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,400
Where is the boy from?

2249
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:33,920
From the east

2250
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:36,200
You have to finish the task
at the right time

2251
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,400
My pal has come

2252
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,400
Won't I do it for him?

2253
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:42,920
Brother, do it as early as you can.
Please

2254
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,560
Why?

2255
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,680
The hen is refusing to stay home, is it?

2256
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,360
Do you have his picture?

2257
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,320
This is him

2258
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:53,400
Him?

2259
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,320
What is his name?

2260
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,800
Pariyerum Perumal

2261
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:58,760
I know him.

2262
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,240
He is studying in Law College, right?

2263
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:01,400
Exactly

2264
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,680
Hey!
He is a good boy

2265
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,040
Should I have a word with him?

2266
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,360
We tried all that
We even beat him up

2267
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:07,800
He isn't budging

2268
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,000
Brother! Let's finish him off

2269
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,000
Ok!

2270
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,360
- Please accept this
- Hey, put it back

2271
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,720
Keep it with you

2272
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,840
I murder for the honor of our women

2273
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:19,120
It is my offering to god!

2274
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:22,560
In case something goes wrong
and I end up in jail

2275
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,680
Use this to take me out

2276
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,480
Ok?

2277
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:25,640
Now keep this

2278
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,160
We will take care of all that

2279
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:28,520
No one should know

2280
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:29,880
We trust you!

2281
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,200
We will do it smoothly

2282
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:33,840
Where is the rooster?

2283
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:36,040
In the hospital!

2284
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,800
Hey

2285
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,320
What are you doing?

2286
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,240
What is this?
Where did you get this from?

2287
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:23,040
Give it to me

2288
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:24,080
Why?

2289
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:26,520
Ma, please...
Give it to me

2290
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,280
They made him run

2291
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,840
They made him run naked
in front of my eyes

2292
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:35,320
Give it to me

2293
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,840
I want to tear at least
one of them apart

2294
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:38,920
Give!

2295
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:41,040
What are you saying?

2296
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,280
Who taught you all this?

2297
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,880
Is this the first time
your father is facing this?

2298
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:47,640
How many times...

2299
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:50,280
He had been mistaken
for a woman and kidnapped

2300
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,560
They would remove his skirt

2301
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,200
When they realise
he is a man

2302
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:56,720
They would leave him naked
and run away

2303
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:58,560
I wasn't there for him then

2304
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,680
You weren't there then

2305
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,040
Now, you are all we have!

2306
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:06,080
Don't leave us alone

2307
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:08,320
You don't have to go
to college anymore

2308
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:09,880
Ok?

2309
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,520
Just be with us

2310
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,120
No, Ma!

2311
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,560
I have to go to college

2312
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,000
I have to study

2313
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

2314
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:37,840
Pariya...

2315
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,560
Semester results are out it seems

2316
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:40,840
You have passed both
the English papers

2317
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:41,720
Who told you this?

2318
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:42,120
Jo!

2319
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,720
- Congrats, Darling!
- She is waiting downstairs

2320
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,720
It's so sad to see her
Go talk to her

2321
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:46,800
Go
Talk to her

2322
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:47,760
Just go

2323
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:06,760
Thanks a lot

2324
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:11,040
Thanks?

2325
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:16,360
Have we become that distant?

2326
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:17,520
Hey, sorry

2327
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,720
I didn't mean it like that!

2328
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:20,800
I passed English exams
only because of you

2329
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,280
That's why I thanked you

2330
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,960
I really don't know why
he is behaving like this!

2331
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:28,320
That's why I spoke to my dad

2332
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,280
Dad beat him up nicely

2333
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:35,720
He will not disturb you anymore

2334
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,120
I shouldn't have invited you alone
for my sister's wedding

2335
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:47,520
So many people...

2336
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:51,520
...must have troubled you
with so many questions!

2337
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:55,360
Couldn't you have told me
what you told them?

2338
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:58,120
That you didn't like
to come for the wedding

2339
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:00,640
I thought you would believe
a lie easily than the truth

2340
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:01,520
This is a lie

2341
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:04,080
I like the truth more than a lie

2342
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:10,200
Today, I have to
tell you a truth

2343
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:11,960
Hey, why are you
closing your eyes now?

2344
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:12,920
Wait, wait!

2345
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,120
Jo!

2346
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,920
Please let me speak

2347
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:17,400
Ok

2348
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:22,560
I don't have the courage
to say this to your face

2349
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,680
So, I will speak with my eyes closed

2350
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:29,360
You listen to it quietly

2351
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:31,440
Ok. Go on!

2352
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:41,400
I told my dad, mom, brother
how much I like you

2353
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:44,560
I don't know what they feel

2354
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,760
But I feel...

2355
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,040
...that I should be with you

2356
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:57,720
That I should come
and live with your family

2357
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:04,520
I shouldn't be thinking all this
about you, without your permission

2358
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:06,080
I know

2359
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:08,560
But I should tell you
this someday, right?

2360
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:11,520
That's why I told you today,
with my eyes shut

2361
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:13,920
You don't have to respond
to any of this

2362
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:21,120
I only want to go back
to being the way we were

2363
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:23,080
The first time I saw you...

2364
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:25,160
...sitting in the last bench

2365
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:29,240
Introducing yourself as
Pariyerum Perumal BABL with a line on top

2366
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,200
Will you be that Pariyan?

2367
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,720
Only then I will open my eyes

2368
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:38,720
Ok!
Open your eyes, first

2369
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,880
Mother promise?

2370
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,080
- Open your eyes, Jo
- Promise I said

2371
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,040
Mother Promise!

2372
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:50,680
When I turn to look at you
in the last bench...

2373
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,360
...I want to see you smiling

2374
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,360
Will you?

2375
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,160
Ok.
Open your eyes

2376
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:56,200
Ok!

2377
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:00,000
I am going to open my eyes now
Smile for me

2378
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:02,560
Can I?

2379
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,160
What happened?

2380
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:18,360
Listen, you can ask me anything.
Can tell me anything.

2381
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:21,440
You have all the right and
freedom for that

2382
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:26,800
You just said we could go
back to our old selves, right?

2383
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,600
That's enough!
That's superb!

2384
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:33,040
I am not confused anymore.
You?

2385
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:34,640
Neither am I

2386
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:36,600
I am ok!

2387
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,640
See...Happy!

2388
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:41,160
- Super, Jo
- I have even brought you a chocolate

2389
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:42,880
Chocolate?
What?

2390
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,720
Here

2391
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:45,760
Why?

2392
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:48,520
Hey idiot!
For clearing your English papers

2393
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:49,840
Right!

2394
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:54,480
You speak so much
but can't open a wrapper

2395
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,320
Give

2396
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,120
Here, take it

2397
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,920
I got through because of you
So you go first!

2398
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:11,440
Shall I leave then?

2399
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:12,920
Yes!
It's late

2400
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:13,680
Dad?

2401
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:15,120
He is good

2402
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,760
Okay

2403
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:30,440
Grandpa...!

2404
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,360
What happened to your leg?

2405
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,440
Nothing

2406
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:34,960
I was having tea at the shop

2407
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,760
An idiot on a bike hit me!

2408
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:39,480
My bone is broken
I am unable to walk

2409
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:41,200
Should I call an auto?

2410
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:42,320
I have my cycle

2411
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:43,080
Do me a favor?

2412
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:45,800
My house is in Shanthi Nagar
Will you come drop me?

2413
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:47,280
Alright

2414
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,360
Careful!

2415
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:15,880
GRANDPA!

2416
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:22,200
The train is close!
Looks like she will die

2417
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:24,280
RUN!

2418
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:27,560
Pariya...RUN!

2419
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:29,640
KARUPPI!

2420
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:20,560
GRANDPA!

2421
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:21,880
NO!

2422
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:31,440
Aren't you dead yet?

2423
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:33,040
I am finishing you off today!

2424
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:35,240
Don't let him go
Kill him

2425
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,080
Die man

2426
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,640
Lingu, hold him down
I will be back

2427
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:43,520
Beat him to death!

2428
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:45,520
Lift him

2429
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:47,600
Beat him to death

2430
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:48,920
You are a loafer

2431
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,240
You want our girl, is it?

2432
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,320
Arrogant ass!

2433
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:56,360
Don't leave him

2434
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,640
Kill him

2435
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:59,400
Don't leave him

2436
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:02,600
Come on Bose

2437
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:21,480
Give my dhothi

2438
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,680
Leave me

2439
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:58,840
Don't kill me

2440
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,440
Welcome, Sir!

2441
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:15,320
Welcome!

2442
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:18,640
Have you come to see
if I am dead?

2443
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:23,240
Are you even human?

2444
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,520
I came to your house
because she invited me

2445
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:29,560
You lock me up, beat me,
urinate on me!

2446
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:31,160
Hasn't your rage settled down?

2447
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:34,000
You have sent an old man to kill me!

2448
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,760
Is this your valor?

2449
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,840
Hey, remember how your daughter
smiled at you today!

2450
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,640
How fondly she called you "dad"!

2451
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:46,320
That affection is the pittance
I doled out to you

2452
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:53,360
You think you are the protectors
of your pride, honour and shit like that!

2453
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:55,720
I have protected it!

2454
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:58,200
Had I told your daughter all this...

2455
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:01,600
...she would have spat on your face
and hung herself

2456
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:03,760
That's why I put up with everything

2457
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:05,600
What now?

2458
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:07,960
If you think only in my death
you will be the father...

2459
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:09,880
...she believes you are!

2460
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:11,960
Come. Kill me!

2461
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:12,720
COME

2462
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:13,880
KILL ME

2463
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,040
After killing me

2464
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:16,760
If you still don't
trust your daughter

2465
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:19,240
Go kill her too!

2466
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:26,040
What is your problem?

2467
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:28,080
How am I inferior to you?

2468
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:29,760
I tell you now...

2469
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:32,520
My hands held the plough
But it also wielded swords!

2470
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:36,480
That's exactly why
I will stay right here!

2471
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:38,320
I will study what I like!

2472
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:40,120
Do what you can!

2473
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:41,200
Leave!

2474
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:11,200
'Old man commits suicide
jumping in front of train in Tirunelveli'

2475
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:13,000
- Hello, Son
- Hello Sir!

2476
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:14,800
- Sit
- How many times I called you home!

2477
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:15,680
You didn't turn up

2478
02:19:15,720 --> 02:19:17,360
So, dad decided to come see you

2479
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:20,160
- Are you well?
- Yes!

2480
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,560
Why is your face wounded?

2481
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:23,520
Pa!
Sir is a kabadi player

2482
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:25,640
Keeps getting hurt like this

2483
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:29,360
Oh! She keeps talking
about you at home

2484
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:31,520
That's why I thought
I should meet you

2485
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,120
Looks like you have cleared
your English papers?

2486
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:36,280
Yes Sir
Jo trained me!

2487
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:37,680
Nice

2488
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:40,320
It's nice to help each other, right?

2489
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:41,840
She has taught you
what she knows

2490
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:43,520
You do the same too

2491
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:44,480
What say, Jo?

2492
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:50,160
Also, she complains that
Sankaralingam keeps troubling you

2493
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:52,600
He is my brother's son

2494
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:55,720
He must be doing this out of love
for his sister

2495
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,080
Don't mind!

2496
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:58,720
Ok?

2497
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,560
Shake hands with him!

2498
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:03,880
Do it!

2499
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,240
Don't mind

2500
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,040
Ok

2501
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:16,120
You be in the car
I will come now

2502
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:18,320
Pa, you both talk

2503
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:19,560
I will get something to eat

2504
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,760
Pa, tea or coffee?

2505
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:21,800
Anything

2506
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:22,520
You?

2507
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:23,480
I know

2508
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:37,920
Son, I am going to ask you something

2509
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:39,160
Answer me frankly

2510
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,280
Yes sir!

2511
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:44,400
We did all that to you

2512
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:46,920
Why didn't you talk
about it to my daughter?

2513
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,560
Do you know something?

2514
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:53,000
Your daughter likes you more than me

2515
02:20:54,320 --> 02:21:00,080
'Nobody has a father as good as mine'
She says

2516
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:03,920
That's why!

2517
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:07,920
Thanks!

2518
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:11,520
I know...

2519
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:16,080
My daughter likes you
as much as she likes me

2520
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:22,400
I also know that
she wants to be with you

2521
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:27,040
Son

2522
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,920
My daughter is so obsessed with you

2523
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:33,400
Don't you feel the same about her?

2524
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:38,600
I don't know

2525
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:45,720
Before I could understand it,
you tore me to pieces

2526
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,560
But your daughter is very lucky

2527
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,360
She can say what she
feels openly, anywhere

2528
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,200
Look at me

2529
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,760
I have to die so many times,
before I can say what I feel

2530
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,040
Sorry!

2531
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:08,680
You are a good person

2532
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:12,240
You will become all
that you wish to be

2533
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:14,160
Study well

2534
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:15,280
Ok?

2535
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:18,240
I can only say this for now

2536
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,120
What else can I say?

2537
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:23,320
Let's see

2538
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:26,440
Things can change tomorrow, right?

2539
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:27,480
Who knows!

2540
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:29,960
I know Sir!

2541

"Why do you stand aside
and look at me?"

2569
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:12,280
