1
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,570
It's okay. It's a gassy mine so the ventilation arrangement..

2
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,390
..should be proper.

3
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,670
Okay, sir.

4
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,790
There shouldn't be gas accumulation.

5
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,200
I'll personally come after a couple of days to check.

6
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
Okay, sir.

7
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,400
Okay. - Bye.

8
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,200
Hello!

9
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,010
Janki di, did the manager come? He didn't even come home for lunch.

10
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,130
I hope he didn't go out for hunting.

11
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,050
Calm down and eat.

12
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,830
He didn't go to hunt.

13
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,990
His seniors have come from Kolkata to visit the coal mines.

14
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,869
He is busy with them there.

15
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,930
He has come.

16
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,930
Calm down and eat everything. - Keep quiet.

17
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,190
I've complaints against you.

18
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,050
You never come home on time and she also doesn't eat if you don't come.

19
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,950
How do I keep her alive?

20
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,010
Leave her to me.

21
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,830
Go and get a cup of coffee for me and save me first.

22
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,270
I'll get it right now.

23
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,030
Why do you behave immaturely?

24
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,890
Why didn't you eat?

25
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,810
Why should you bother?

26
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,030
Why didn't you come home for lunch?

27
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,969
You're always busty with work.

28
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,870
I had to go for inspection to the colliery.

29
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,190
So, I didn't get.. - Time to come. Right?

30
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,030
You're always busy with work or hunting.

31
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,890
Shree, hunting is an obsession.

32
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,049
I can't live without hunting.

33
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,810
What's the use of killing animals?

34
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,270
Hunting is an ancient obsession and profession.

35
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,250
This obsession helped me hunt you down from Jhansi.

36
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,050
What gift do you want for anniversary this year?

37
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,830
Just four days left for it.

38
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,130
Why are you asking me?

39
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,130
Gift me whatever you wish. - Okay.

40
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,990
I'll go an meet Chander da.

41
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,830
Let me check if all the invitations have been sent out.

42
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,190
Relax for some time. You're always in hurry.

43
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,270
I won't let you go anywhere until you eat something.

44
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,890
No. No. I don't want any explanations.

45
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,910
I want to know why we've 100 rupees less from the payment cash.

46
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,050
Sir, I told you that my eyesight has become weak.

47
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,270
I may have paid someone extra.

48
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,070
I know very well that you won't give more money to anyone.

49
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,190
Shame! Shame! Will you never change?

50
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,250
How can I change?

51
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,050
I've become like coal after staying in the coal mine all the time.

52
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,109
There's a saying that you can't make the coal appear bright...

53
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,010
..even if you wash it several times.. - Shut up!

54
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,909
Deep Narayan has spoilt you.

55
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,990
I would've sent you to jail for the previous theft.

56
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,270
No sir, you couldn't have done it.

57
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,909
You also love me a lot.

58
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,950
Great! You know mu weakness.

59
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,830
You'll make me crazy.

60
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,010
You've drunk again. - No.. no..

61
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,110
No sir, I don't drink now.

62
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,070
I didn't drink.

63
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,950
Oh! There must be another possibility.

64
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,090
I drank alcohol for many years so I must be smelling of it and..

65
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,270
I smelt it. Right?

66
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,210
Who named you Sridhar? - My grandma.

67
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,190
She raised me.

68
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,090
She didn't raise you well.

69
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,050
You've grown up to be a rogue.

70
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,230
She should've named you Gunadhar (talented one) instead of Sridhar.

71
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,210
Forget it. What about 100 rupees? - 100 rupees?

72
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,150
Which 100 rupees are you talking about Chander da?

73
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,030
Don't ask me. This great fellow will make me crazy.

74
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,010
We're short of 100 rupees again.

75
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,270
What's the matter, Mr. Sridhar?

76
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,830
I always give you 10-120 rupees extra whenever you ask me.

77
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,250
Why do you steal? - Well..

78
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,230
Sridhar, you may go now.

79
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,010
Put down the 100 rupees as my personal expense.

80
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,110
No. No. It's too much.

81
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,910
Sridhar should be fired. - No. No. Forget it.

82
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,210
You don't understand what I mean.

83
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,970
But Chander da, he maybe an alcoholic and a thief..

84
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,250
..but he took care of the workers when cholera broke out.

85
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,150
I know it.

86
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,030
He kept drinking day and night and cleaned the garbage.

87
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,830
I wonder how can the same person do something so vile.

88
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,190
Addiction and gambling can ruin a man.

89
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,050
Have you sent the invitations?

90
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,850
Yes, I've sent almost all the invites.

91
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,050
I'll send the remaining tomorrow as we don't have time.

92
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,870
Mr. Chander, why was my slip returned by the cash department?

93
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,089
No.. I mean.. send it after 10 am tomorrow.

94
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,830
It's not important if I send it tomorrow.

95
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,989
Why did you return it today?

96
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,970
Do I have to answer you right now? - Of course.

97
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,110
Since I've questioned you.. - I'm bound to answer..

98
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,850
..as I'm your employee. Okay, listen to me.

99
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,830
I'm not doing it for you.

100
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,870
Is it?

101
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,990
Then for what are you doing all this?

102
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,050
Are you doing a favor? - No.

103
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,270
I'm doing it because it's like a challenge for me.

104
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:54,810
If you can bowl out an expert batsmen with a good in-swing ball..

105
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,930
..it is great fun.

106
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,990
If I can use some tricks and help you become the owner of the property..

107
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,970
..I'll be similarly happy but..

108
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,050
To hell with you.

109
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,830
I can't wait any longer.

110
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,970
It's been long.

111
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,870
What's the use of getting money at the age of 50?

112
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,069
It's doubtful whether you'll get anything.

113
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,230
It's clearly mentioned in the will that..

114
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,910
..if Deep Narayan didn't marry till the age of 40..

115
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,830
..you would've got half of the property.

116
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,970
That didn't happen.

117
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,109
I kept him bust with alcohol and hunting for 38 years.

118
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,230
He suddenly went to Jhansi and married this middle aged woman.

119
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,110
Forget it.

120
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,150
Let me tell you why I've called you here today.

121
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,990
They've been married for seven years.

122
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,930
They don't have any child.

123
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,910
Isn't there some clause in the will?

124
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,089
Go through it properly.

125
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,270
There's nothing to go through.

126
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,090
I've to catch the 9:52 train. - No.

127
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,110
Take this. Keep this.

128
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,829
Have dinner and then go.

129
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,870
I'll help you board the Bombay Mail.

130
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,190
Go through the will properly and do something.

131
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,890
Do something?

132
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,069
There's only one solution.

133
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,030
I mentioned it to you many times.

134
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,270
If Deep Narayan dies a childless man..

135
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,230
..only then you can be the owner of the property.

136
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,990
If he dies? How?

137
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,130
Accident. - Accident?

138
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,130
No on e can avoid accidents. - Accident.

139
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,010
Do you've confirmed information? - Of course.

140
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,930
We wouldn't have come here if we didn't have confirmed information.

141
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,930
The sambar deer was killed in the evening. - Yes.

142
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,270
Fresh blood is still oozing out.

143
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,070
We went and saw the incident with our eyes.

144
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,250
Okay.

145
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,030
Go and speak in the manner I taught you. Okay?

146
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,890
We'll do it but what about our payment? - Payment?

147
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,930
You'll get it. You'll get it.

148
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,970
I'll give you such a generous tip that you won't have any regrets in life.

149
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,870
Wait, I'll be back soon.

150
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,010
Younger sister-in-law, son-in-law has gifted her this necklace this year.

151
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,210
It's beautiful.

152
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,270
The design is really nice.

153
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,050
Sister, you didn't say how it is.

154
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,050
It's beautiful.

155
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,990
Brother really has good taste.

156
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,810
My dear, don't be angry today.

157
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,070
Listen to me.

158
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,010
I promise you that I won't go out for a month after tonight.

159
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,990
Will you remember your promise?

160
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,930
Try to come home tonight. Okay?

161
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,230
I promise that I'll come home tonight.

162
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,869
You better stay here.

163
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,189
Don't leave him alone. - Okay.

164
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,990
You go there.

165
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,850
Try my new rifle.

166
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,870
Anu!

167
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,089
Beware!

168
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,910
Janki!

169
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,270
Janki!

170
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,950
What happened? what happened?

171
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,090
Janki.. - Are you scared?

172
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,250
I saw a nightmare.

173
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,150
I'm still nervous.

174
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,169
Don't worry.

175
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,210
Take the name of lord.

176
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,970
Shree! Shree!

177
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,190
Shree! Wake up.

178
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,190
What happened?

179
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,050
Why are you quiet? Tell me what has happened.

180
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,970
We're ruined. We're ruined.

181
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,830
Why are you quiet?

182
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,909
Tell me. What has happened? Tell me.

183
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,830
Has he come back?

184
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,830
Son-in-law has been badly injured by a tiger.

185
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,229
What did you say? A tiger has injured him?

186
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,230
He's admitted in the hospital.

187
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,129
He's admitted in the hospital? Who? Who told you?

188
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,030
Young master. Mr. Chander. Everybody else is there.

189
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,170
What have you done, my lord?

190
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,090
What have you done?

191
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,030
Deep.. Deep Narayan.. Deep..

192
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,170
Chander da!

193
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,970
Lie down.

194
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,910
Do you want to tell me something, Deep Narayan?

195
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,970
Yes.

196
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,050
Tell me. I'm here. Tell me.

197
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,130
Tell them to go out.

198
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,830
Please go out. - But..

199
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,810
I'm with him. - Okay.

200
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,990
Deep?

201
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,130
Chander da.. - Yes, tell me.

202
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,230
Tell me what you want to say.

203
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:52,190
I want to say that.. this is a disgrace to our family.

204
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,150
People should treat this as an accident.

205
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,850
But actually.. actually.. it is murder. - Murder?

206
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,169
Yes, murder.

207
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:14,070
Anu.. Anu.. Anu has murdered me.

208
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:24,250
He had taken out the firing pin of my rifle..

209
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,970
..or I never miss the target.

210
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,270
It was his plan.

211
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,990
He even killed Mumru.

212
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,910
Evil man.

213
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,830
Don't tell anyone about it.

214
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,230
Promise that you'll take care of Shree.

215
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:05,110
His evil intentions should never be fulfilled.

216
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,129
Promise me.

217
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:14,010
I promise that I won't let anyone harm her as long as I'm alive.

218
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,950
But.. - But what?

219
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,130
Deep Narayan you know everything mentioned in the will.

220
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,909
You don't have a successor after you.

221
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,050
I'm helpless. - No.. no..

222
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,850
Listen.. I'll tell you something which no one knows.

223
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,909
Are you sure?

224
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,090
Glory to Radha Govinda! Glory to Radha-Govinda!

225
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,090
I promise you Deep Narayan that until Chandrakanata Chakroborty..

226
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,930
..is alive, his wishes will never be fulfilled.

227
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,250
Chander da.. Chander da..

228
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,990
Deep! Deep! Dr. Mitra! Dr. Mitra!

229
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,010
Glory to Lord Narayana!

230
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,990
Glory to Lord Narayana!

231
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,950
Like the way we discard old clothes for new ones..

232
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,870
..the soul discards the old body for a new one.

233
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:35,850
If he has a daughter then my second son Late Joy Narayan Choudhury's son..

234
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,950
..Anugraha Narayan will get half of my movable and immovable assets.

235
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,909
But if Deep Narayan dies childless..

236
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:57,090
..then my entire property will go to Anugraha Narayan or his son.

237
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:05,850
Mr. Chandrakanta and Mr. Mitra, as per the present circumstances..

238
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,050
..Mr. Anugraha Narayan is the sole owner of the property.

239
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,050
According to the will Mr. Deep Narayan's wife will not only..

240
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,209
..get money for all her expenses but will also get..

241
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,190
..a monthly allowance of thousand rupees from the state.

242
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,050
I'll apply for a petition to execute the will.

243
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,930
Do any of you have any objection?

244
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,230
What? Objection?

245
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,970
If anyone has any objection, let him come to the proper court.

246
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,270
I think we should scrutiny it properly. - Of course Of course.

247
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,990
You've a legal responsibility, Mr. Mitra.

248
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,250
But it is crystal clear that Mr. Anugraha Narayan is..

249
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,130
..the only successor of all this property.

250
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,930
By all means.

251
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,950
Stop discussing about going to court.

252
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,270
I take over the charge of the business sand property right now.

253
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,110
Mr. Bose.. - Yes sir, what shall I do for you?

254
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,210
Don't show or hand over anyone the papers..

255
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,270
..without my written permission. - Okay, sir.

256
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,149
Mr. Das.. - Yes, sir.

257
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,210
..get all the books of accounts to me tomorrow.

258
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,050
I'll scrutinize everything.

259
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,969
Mr. Suresh, take up the responsibility of cash.

260
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,890
Don't pay anyone a single penny without my permission.

261
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,250
Is that clear?

262
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,250
You can check the cash any time.

263
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,950
But I need a proper order in matters of cash.

264
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,230
Oh!

265
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,190
So, you're trying to teach me law?

266
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,970
Okay. I'll take legal help to throw you out first.

267
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,010
And..

268
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,989
Mr. Chandrakanta.. - Yes?

269
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,090
Do you want to say something to me?

270
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:32,810
Surrender your power of attorney to Mr. Mallick right now.

271
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,090
Do I need to surrender it right now?

272
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,010
It's better to surrender.

273
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,270
Why are you taking unnecessary risk and responsibility?

274
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,890
I don't understand what risk you're talking about.

275
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,850
You're the ones taking the risk.

276
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,210
What do you mean?

277
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,110
I didn't wish to reveal the truth before everybody.

278
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,090
But since you're forcing me, let me tell you.

279
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,910
I think you must've known that Deep Narayan didn't die childless.

280
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,810
He didn't die childless?

281
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,110
What? What do you want to say?

282
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,209
I want to say that his wife is already pregnant with his child.

283
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,170
Stop your nonsense. What's the proof?

284
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,890
Proof? Shame on you!

285
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,929
It is a matter of your family prestige.

286
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,129
You know how Deep Narayan died only a month back.

287
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,850
Don't you feel ashamed to ask for proof?

288
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,250
I know how he died? What do you mean?

289
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,210
You were the only one present with him during the accident.

290
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,270
Don't you know that he died under mysterious circumstances?

291
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:10,209
Well, you've shared good news.

292
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,250
Good.

293
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,030
Of course. Of course. It's a good news.

294
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,030
You should've revealed this earlier.

295
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,830
I would've been saved from unnecessary troubles.

296
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:34,870
But, you took the right decision to diplomatically suppress the information.

297
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,970
Goodbye. I'll leave now.

298
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,250
You all may leave now.

299
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,970
Anugraha, what are you doing?

300
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,889
Are you going mad?

301
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,130
It's really strange that I haven't gone mad yet. - Be quiet.

302
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,990
The game is still not out of our hands. - No..

303
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,070
What do you want to say?

304
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,129
Close the door.

305
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,050
What do you want to say?

306
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:31,130
Well, Deep Narayan's child may not see the light of the world..

307
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,950
..and his wife may also..

308
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,970
After all we've blood ties.

309
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,129
Have you given up?

310
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,970
No, I haven't.

311
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,030
I'm going through this mess.

312
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:55,070
The poet has said that blood is a sweeter juice

313
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,990
We've drank that.

314
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,010
You've to see the end.

315
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,910
Yes. I'll.

316
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,930
I'll definitely do it.

317
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,130
I won't bear such an insult.

318
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,990
What do I have to do? Tell me.

319
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,050
I'll write letter to Dr. Rudra.

320
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,030
Give him 5000 rupees and he'll arrange everything.

321
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,170
I must teach a lesson to that swine Chandrakanta.

322
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,030
Yes! We must.

323
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,270
Come on. Have another drink.

324
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:41,110
Murder? He has been murdered? - Yes.

325
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,050
Mr. Choudhury, this isn't enough.

326
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,950
I'll take all the risk and do it.

327
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:02,110
And you won't even offer a microscopic portion of your profit?

328
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,110
No! No! This is not done.

329
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,090
No.. I mean.. I don't mean it.

330
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,070
You know that right now I don't have enough money with me..

331
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,010
You may not have money with you right now.

332
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,930
But you've money in your bank account.

333
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,870
Look, I don't do these jobs nowadays.

334
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,850
I've agreed to do this on Kritanta's insistence.

335
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,010
But, I must have at least 10,000.

336
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,110
Where will we go at this hour?

337
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,110
We'll set out tomorrow morning. - No.

338
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,250
We must go there tonight.

339
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,270
I've been telling Chandrakanta about a doctor for a month.

340
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,010
Chandrakanta? Who is that devil?

341
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,229
He is actually a devil. A dangerous man.

342
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,110
He handles everything in our state.

343
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,210
He won't allow any of the doctors recommended by me..

344
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,250
..to check her.

345
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,090
He got scared today and has finally agreed to me.

346
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,810
Her condition isn't good and he wants an experienced doctor to check her.

347
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,890
I must take advantage of this opportunity.

348
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,070
Please come with me right now.

349
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,250
Okay, let's go.

350
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,270
I must get the remaining payment after I reach there.

351
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,030
Only then I'll start my work. Agreed?

352
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,070
Why are you so worried?

353
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,190
It's a simple case.

354
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:29,050
The case which is very simple to you is the most complicated one for me.

355
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,070
I'll explain everything to you later on. - Okay.

356
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,830
Bye. Greetings.

357
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,090
I assure that I shall perform my duty honestly.

358
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,169
Manager. Manager.

359
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,209
What's wrong. Sridhar? What brings you here on this stormy night?

360
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,930
Manager.. I'm ruined. - You're ruined.

361
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,970
What do you mean?

362
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:13,850
Minati's infection has become serious.

363
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,270
She is very restless.

364
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,110
I don't think she'll survive.

365
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,010
If Mrs. Sen could come right now with me..

366
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,870
..that's why I'm here.

367
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,190
But he can't go right now..

368
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,150
..because I think she'll deliver tonight.

369
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,870
Tonight? Then?

370
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,169
Okay, I'll send Mrs. Sen to you as soon as possible.

371
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,929
You may go now. - Okay.

372
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,010
I'll go. I'll go.

373
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,230
She'll deliver tonight?

374
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,970
But sir.. - Go now.

375
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,190
I'll send Mrs. Sen to you as soon as possible.

376
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,850
God forbid, if anything serious happens, I'll go there.

377
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,250
Minati! Minati!

378
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,250
Why are you late?

379
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:44,090
I went to Dr. Mrs. Sen so that she comes here.

380
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:54,270
I got everything but I'm going to lose everything now.

381
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,870
Where's my son? - He's here.

382
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,890
Where is he? - He's here.

383
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,170
Why can't I see?

384
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,170
Why can't I see you?

385
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,870
Where are you? Where are you? - I'm here.

386
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,270
My son.. where's my son.. - He is here.

387
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:17,030
Take him. - Son..

388
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,889
Minati! Minati!

389
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,109
Come in. Come in.

390
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,030
How is she now? - She's fine.

391
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,910
She's fine now.

392
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,130
He is Dr. Rudra.

393
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,009
He's the manager of our state Chandrakanta Chakroborty.

394
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,109
Greetings.

395
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:25,090
Anugrahaha, madam has given birth to a male child..

396
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,070
..at 3:17 am. - What?

397
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,210
What happened? What did you say?

398
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,009
What happened? - She has given birth to a male child. - Oh!

399
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,990
Is it? That's great news.

400
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,030
Yes. By the grace of lord it's great news.

401
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,930
Dr. Rudra, sorry for the trouble. Take my car and go back.

402
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:51,110
Why don't I check the patient now that I'm here?

403
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,130
Of course. of course.

404
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,890
Since you've come, you can go and check madam and her child.

405
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,870
Dr. Mrs. Sen is attending them.

406
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,009
Come, I'll take you there. Come.

407
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,070
Please have sweets.

408
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,109
Madam, you must be very angry with me. - Why?

409
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,170
I didn't allow you to invite guest for Pradip's birthday. - No. No.

410
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,009
I knew that you did it for Pradip's well-being.

411
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,270
Yes, you're right.

412
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,890
I'm always occupied with the thought of Pradip's well-being.

413
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,029
I'm always scared that a mishap can happen any moment.

414
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,009
Pradip. Anup.

415
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,190
Bless him. He needs your blessings on this day.

416
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,210
Bless you, Pradip. Live long.

417
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:36,209
I bless you that you grow-up to be a good human being.

418
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,029
Madam, Mr. Deep Narayan wasn't an ordinary man,

419
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,270
He was our god.

420
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,230
His son will definitely be a king. - Of course.

421
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,250
Of course, he'll be a king. - Sridhar, come and bless Pradip.

422
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,049
Bless him? My blessing are always with him, manager.

423
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,230
Come to me. Come to me.

424
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,830
Madam, the cashier is absolutely right.

425
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,890
Mr. Deep Narayan was our god..

426
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:08,149
..so his son will grow up to be a king.

427
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,190
He'll definitely be a king. Definitely.

428
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,190
Look what I have brought for you.

429
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,190
Anup, come with me. See what I've brought.

430
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,230
I'll show you everything. Sit here. Sit here.

431
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,270
Sit next to me. Sit next to me.

432
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,190
Yes. Sit here.

433
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,850
Anup, this is for you.

434
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,890
And this one is for you.

435
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,930
Look! What's this? - Aeroplane.

436
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,830
Yes. it's an aeroplane.

437
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,930
Where will you go in this aeroplane?

438
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,129
You'll go abroad. You'll go to Germany.

439
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,049
You'll be a highly educated man.

440
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,950
Mr. Gosai sent me.

441
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,009
Anup da, chotoma (aunt) didn't come?

442
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,130
The treatments Anugrahaha went through didn't bear any result.

443
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,270
He's bed-ridden with paralysis.

444
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,090
Sister can't leave him alone.

445
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,009
Where's granny?

446
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,850
Janki can't walk up and down the stairs.

447
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,890
She's upstairs.

448
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,250
She's eager to meet you.

449
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,270
Come upstairs. Come, Anup.

450
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,009
Why are you carrying the luggage?

451
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,150
So what? You've just returned from Germany.

452
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,910
I'm so happy today.

453
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,010
Pradip, come and seek your father's blessings first.

454
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,930
What this oblation for?

455
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,950
There's a reason.

456
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,010
Come on, take it.

457
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,150
I want to know the reason.

458
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,830
Don't you remember anything?

459
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,970
Pradip has returned home from Germany today.

460
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,010
Throw it.

461
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,130
I dislike this nonsense.

462
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,870
You threw it away? - Yes, I did.

463
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,830
You and your son are free to run after them for their money..

464
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,049
Don't take their name before me.

465
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,850
You've ruined your son's life too.

466
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,130
God has blessed me in one aspect.

467
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,070
Anup is not like you.

468
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,830
How can he be?

469
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,970
A tiger doesn't give birth to a fox.

470
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,030
Sometimes I feel that he is not my son. - Shut up!

471
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,810
You don't feel ashamed to say anything.

472
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,950
God has punished you.

473
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,009
You're bed-ridden with paralysis.

474
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,210
Yet you haven't given up your evil ways.

475
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,950
It'll end.. it'll end the day Pradip..

476
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,170
Get out.

477
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,109
Get out. Get out of my room.

478
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,030
Never come to my room. Get out.

479
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,930
Come in. come in. Sit on this chair.

480
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,830
No, uncle. You deserve to sit on that chair.

481
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,250
No.. I won't sit on that chair anymore.

482
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,910
You'll sit on it. Mr. Dasgupta, all the departmental heads..

483
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,830
..with whom we interact all the time and..

484
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,029
..introduce them to Pradip. - Okay.

485
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:57,990
Mr. Mukherjee, get the summary balance sheet and..

486
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,230
..inventory files of the last seven years of Choudhury company..

487
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,950
..and explain it to Pardip.

488
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,070
Why do you want me to take charge when you're here?

489
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,030
You need to handle them when I'm not here.

490
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,090
So, I want to explain everything to you.

491
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:16,010
Come, I'll introduce you to all the departments. Come.

492
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,110
Taxi! Taxi!

493
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,130
It went away.

494
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,950
Taxi! Taxi! I'll note down your number.

495
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,970
Taxi! Taxi!

496
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,130
Murder.

497
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,930
Attempt to murder. Why are they given license?

498
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,230
Excuse me. I'm extremely sorry.

499
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,870
Please forgive me. - I won't forgive you.

500
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,210
Ms. Shikha, wait here, I'll get a taxi. - No. No.

501
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,210
Please listen to me. - Shut up!

502
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,050
No.. I mean.. it was an accident.

503
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,010
But, you've ruined me.

504
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,090
Listen to me. Listen to me.

505
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,830
How did I ruin you?

506
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,970
You couldn't go where you were scheduled to go. Right?

507
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,830
I can drop you there in my car. - You don't have to.

508
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,870
You may leave.

509
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,069
Who is it?

510
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:44,250
You? - Yes.. It's me.

511
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,950
You? What do you want? - What do I want?

512
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,070
I'm waiting for someone.

513
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,270
Who are you waiting for? - Well.. I don't know her name.

514
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,050
Oh! So, you don't know her name and yet you're waiting for her?

515
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:13,090
Great! - Yes. no.. I mean.. it's not my matter, it's ours..

516
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:17,830
Oh! But, you can't impress anybody with your car.

517
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,089
No. No. I'm not trying to impress anybody with my car.

518
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,270
What are you saying?

519
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,090
You understood what I mean.

520
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,210
No, I don't.

521
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,890
You don't know her name and yet you're waiting for her.

522
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,950
You've entered the house and are peeping around.

523
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,109
What's your intention? - Intention? What do you mean?

524
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,150
Why are you quiet? Tell me.

525
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:15,830
&quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot;

526
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:23,270
&quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot;

527
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:30,870
&quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot;

528
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:37,270
&quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot;

529
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:44,870
&quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot;

530
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:07,210
&quot;If the clouds thunder and the lightening scares.&quot;

531
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:16,970
&quot;If the clouds thunder and the lightening scares.&quot;

532
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:24,010
&quot;Oh rains, why does your eyes glow with the lightening?&quot;

533
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:30,950
&quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot;

534
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:38,130
&quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot;

535
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:52,830
&quot;You create melodies a you shower down.&quot;

536
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,930
&quot;Why do you whisper in my ears?&quot;

537
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:01,910
&quot;You create melodies a you shower down.&quot;

538
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:08,129
&quot;Why do you whisper in my ears, oh rains?&quot;

539
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:13,170
&quot;You've desires to get lost.&quot;

540
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,830
&quot;You lose everything in the storm.&quot;

541
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:22,850
&quot;You've desires to get lost.&quot;

542
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,270
&quot;You lose everything in the storm.&quot;

543
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:33,850
&quot;Why do you touch me with your hands, oh rains?&quot;

544
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:40,209
&quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot;

545
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:47,910
&quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot;

546
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:54,210
&quot;Oh rains, why do you make my heart jubilant?&quot;

547
00:48:54,250 --> 00:49:02,950
&quot;Oh rains, you spread across the sky and then shower down.&quot;

548
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,150
Sunanda.. - Yes.

549
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,990
..the gentleman drives really well. Isn't it?

550
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,890
Is it written in your book? You're reading it so attentively.

551
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,970
No. it's not written in my book. But, suddenly the thought struck me.

552
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,270
I was feeling very scared.

553
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,910
He drives so fast.

554
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,110
I was also scared.

555
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,970
But his handsome visage assured me.

556
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:37,190
He's very smart. Isn't it? - Yes, right.

557
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:45,930
But more than his appearance his way of speaking is smarter.

558
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,930
The young boys speak with such attitude with girls.

559
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,850
I can't tolerate them.

560
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,990
Look.. look, I'm very sick.

561
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,850
Don't call me whenever you want to.. who?

562
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:03,970
Who is speaking?

563
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:09,170
Well.. I can't reveal my name.

564
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,890
I've met you for the first time today.

565
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,870
Who are you talking to for such a long time?

566
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:17,210
It's the fellow with mart appearance. - Oh!

567
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,089
How did you get my telephone number?

568
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:22,890
People are going to the moon and I can't even get a telephone number?

569
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,130
Well, I loved your song.

570
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,170
He's very smart.

571
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,210
All boys are the same.

572
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,010
Why are you shouting? He'll hear you.

573
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,970
You don't have any sense.

574
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:38,890
Look.. I sing so that I can entertain people.

575
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,070
I feel blessed if people like my song.

576
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,810
Just listening to the song isn't enough.

577
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,890
Our eyes and ears go hand in hand.

578
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:49,190
The entire effort fails if one of the senses are deprived.

579
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,850
How can I satisfy you? - Shall I tell you? Okay, I'll tell you.

580
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,250
But don't get angry like your friend.

581
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,950
Oh! No. No. I won't get angry.

582
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,089
That's enough.

583
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,090
I just wanted you to assure me that I wouldn't be handed over..

584
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,870
..to the police if I visit you.

585
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,250
I'm going out of station day after tomorrow.

586
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,129
I'll come back and meet you.

587
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,150
Yes, do that.

588
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:19,270
Thank you.

589
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,910
Good night. Good night.

590
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,009
Whose music will gratify your eyes and ears?

591
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,190
Well Anu da.. - You can speak from there.

592
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,250
An interesting incident happened today.

593
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:30,250
What happened?

594
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,029
It was like a drama scene. - Drama?

595
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,010
Yes, I can understand.

596
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,910
The hero is right before me.

597
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,110
Who is the heroine?

598
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,810
Well.. - Brother, let me tell you something.

599
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,110
You can't start a drama anywhere you want. - Why?

600
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,150
You must follow some rules.

601
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,230
For example, she should be of the same caste, proper gotra,

602
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,970
..the horoscopes should match. - To hell with your horoscope.

603
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,150
Listen to my story first. - Yes. yes. Tell me.

604
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,270
I must listen to your story.

605
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,250
I'll hear your story.

606
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,049
After all I've to arrange everything.

607
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,150
You've to manage everything.

608
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,250
Manage what?

609
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:04,850
If my family finds out, they will..

610
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,069
I've already invited him home. - So what?

611
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,250
I'm feeling really bad.

612
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,910
He spoke so smartly that I couldn't refuse him.

613
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,050
You've invited him home but you didn't even ask his name.

614
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,250
How could I ask his name?

615
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,970
He said that he can't reveal his name.

616
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,050
Strange! What's the problem in revealing your name?

617
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,170
We told our names when you asked us.

618
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,970
He has no problem in telling his name.

619
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,150
We'll be in problem if he tells his name.

620
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,069
What's the problem in telling a name?

621
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,890
What are you so scared of?

622
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,109
No. that's right. That's right.

623
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,010
The matter is that.. the matter is that..

624
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,170
..like that earth that has three portions of water and one portion of land..

625
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:52,029
..similarly a man should have little fear amidst courage.

626
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,950
That's because it helps in mental development.

627
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,029
It makes a man smart.

628
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,230
Well, let me tell my name.

629
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:57,850
You want to say your name? Go ahead.

630
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,170
Look.. my name is Pradip (lamp) and your name is Shikha (flame).

631
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,810
Don't you think that the two names match each other?

632
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,109
Your short-tempered sister might think that..

633
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,050
..I've made up the name. That's all.

634
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:09,050
Why are you blaming me?

635
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,910
You splashed mud on both of them.

636
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:14,970
You entered our house without permission and were peeping inside.

637
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,210
Did I do anything wrong if I called the police?

638
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,850
The incident that day was a blessing in disguise.

639
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,950
I wasn't getting a cab.

640
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,990
I wouldn't have reached there on time without your help.

641
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,030
But, we don't know his name yet.

642
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,250
Sorry. It's my mistake.

643
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,049
You heard my name. Pradip. Pradip Narayan Choudhury.

644
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,930
he's my elder brother Anup Narayan Choudhury.

645
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,010
Madam, Mr. Rahu is here.

646
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,930
Oh god! Bad omen (Rahu) on the first day of meeting?

647
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:51,109
Well, it's not rahu, it's Rahul..

648
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,070
What? - Rahul.

649
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,270
He has added a 'l' to his ominous name.

650
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,910
Oh god! Look how parents spoil their children's fate..

651
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,049
..by giving them such weird names.

652
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,070
Why did they name me Rahul?

653
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:09,090
Everybody calls me Rahu.

654
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,990
You? Who are you?

655
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,210
You? - How did I come here?

656
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,009
Accidentally.

657
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,150
It was a mere accident.

658
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:25,070
You ruined my day.. I had to take bath after that and..

659
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,830
I took bath and contracted flu.

660
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,250
Don't be angry.

661
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:38,009
The Rahu's evil eye can destroy anything.

662
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,190
Who are you?

663
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,090
I never met you before.

664
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:45,910
How dare you make fun of me?

665
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:46,990
Forget it.

666
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:49,030
Let me introduce him.

667
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,130
His name is Rahul Khasnobis.

668
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,850
What? You also called me Rahu?

669
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,109
Why will I call you Rahu?

670
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,170
Listen carefully.

671
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,990
Didn't I say that his name is Rahul?

672
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,990
Yes, she said Rahul.

673
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,910
I've done all the official formalities.

674
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:11,210
Henceforth, Mr. Dasgupta will consult you before taking..

675
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,810
..any decision regarding the head office.

676
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:17,930
Please don't involve me in these matters anymore.

677
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,850
But, how will I manage without your help?

678
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,210
Why can't you? It's not difficult.

679
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,170
You've raised in a manner so that you're efficient for this work.

680
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:32,950
Mr. Dasgupta, I want to discuss certain things with Pradip.

681
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,109
Please leave.

682
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:49,240
Pradip, my son, when your father died he didn't have faith..

683
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,860
..in anyone except me.

684
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,820
He called me to the hospital before his death and..

685
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,820
..entrusted me with great responsibility.

686
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,100
I've been fulfilling it with dedication till date.

687
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,120
I've raised you.

688
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,240
Please take charge of everything.

689
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,120
Set me free.

690
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:18,240
Uncle, I want to be with you for at least 2 years and learn the business from you.

691
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,100
Okay, as you wish.

692
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,879
One more thing.

693
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,040
After my death respect Mr. Sridhar and take care of him.

694
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,120
You don't have a well-wisher like him.

695
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,780
Mr. Sridhar? - Yes.

696
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,840
Sridhar and I are going to Chandrapura day after tomorrow.

697
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,180
Come there the very next day because..

698
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,140
..the place will be inspected that day.

699
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,020
I want you to be present there at that time.

700
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,140
You can go where you wish to now.

701
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,060
What next?

702
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,939
Serve the rich fellow with such expectations.

703
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,880
Listen.. a rich man pampers his dog and his flatterer..

704
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,880
..even before they can demand anything.

705
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,220
Supporting my younger brother..

706
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,180
..doesn't mean that I'm trying to flatter him.

707
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,240
Oh! Is it?

708
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:24,020
A person without self-respect has a reason to support everything.

709
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,040
Forget it.

710
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,140
Have you brought my money? - No.

711
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,220
I'll get it very soon.

712
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,060
From where will you get the money?

713
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,000
By begging before Pradip?

714
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,940
What other option do I have?

715
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,000
We've to follow the clauses mentioned in the will.

716
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,240
Shut up! will? Don't mention the will before me.

717
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,860
The will is the curse of my life.

718
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:56,900
I've lost my honor and it didn't satisfy my desires.

719
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:04,240
Perhaps.. perhaps I'm going through this punishment because of it.

720
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,240
Father, if we expect things that don't belong to us.

721
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,860
We'll be disheartened.

722
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,920
Oh! Fantastic!

723
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,919
You mean to say I don't deserve a share in this property?

724
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,820
Well.. will you never follow what I say?

725
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,180
You've grown up but you haven't changed a bit.

726
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,820
How can I change?

727
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,860
I'm an animal like you.

728
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,980
Human being change but not animals.

729
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,220
Swine! get out.

730
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,120
I don't want to see your face.

731
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,240
I also don't wish to show you my face.

732
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,860
Get out, I say.

733
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:09,140
Lakhua! Keep working.

734
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,240
Can we go now? - Yes, you may go.

735
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,900
Meet me after lunch.

736
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,120
Okay.

737
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,060
I'll go back to office and submit the report tomorrow.

738
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,120
Well, you're soon going to get good news from our department.

739
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,899
Okay, bye.

740
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,240
How do you think the inspection went?

741
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,800
It's potentially a gassy mine.

742
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,980
He has minutely scrutinized everything.

743
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,080
He couldn't remark anything after checking the efficient..

744
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,040
..ventilation arrangement that we have.

745
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,000
Our mine is going to be first in mine safety week.

746
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,160
Great! In that case the entire credit goes to you.

747
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,940
Where are you going?

748
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,820
I'm going to meet uncle.

749
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,900
Why do you want to go there?

750
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,120
I've no work there.

751
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,960
But, it's my duty. - Okay, you may go there later.

752
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,920
You've an invitation at Sridhar's place today.

753
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,020
I'll go with you.

754
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,060
What's this sudden invitation for?

755
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,000
No.. no.. it's not a sudden invitation. I.. I..

756
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,020
I can't go there today.

757
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,839
Srivastava has invited me for lunch today. - No.. no..

758
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,980
You must come to my place today. You must come to my place today.

759
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,240
Please pardon me, I can't accept your invitation.

760
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,180
But.. what shall I do?

761
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,900
It's okay, Sridhar. It's okay.

762
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,900
Pradip, today is his wife' death anniversary.

763
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,040
His wife died suddenly.

764
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,240
His son also didn't survive.

765
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,240
We must visit him.

766
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,940
You know how crazy he is.

767
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,180
Okay Sridhar, Pradip and I'll be there within an hour.

768
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,080
Come on, hurry up.

769
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,980
We toiled hard for eight hours.

770
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,140
Our blood has become water.

771
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,080
Sir thinks that we're animals.

772
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,820
Yes. yes.

773
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,140
What are you saying?

774
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,859
Who is it?

775
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,020
Oh!

776
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,040
No use seeking my blessings.

777
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,920
I'm a paralyzed man.

778
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,860
But, your heart is not paralyzed.

779
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,820
Bless me from heart.

780
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,240
But, my heart is poisoned now.

781
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,080
Please don't mind my words, uncle.

782
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,819
I didn't understand till date what has been troubling you.

783
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,860
I've always heard that you have been suffering.

784
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:35,220
Oh! Is it? Okay. I'll beg before you.

785
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,220
Ah! Why are you talking like this?

786
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,800
Pradip, don't speak to him.

787
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,100
Come. - Oh! So, you think I talk nonsense.

788
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,980
You're a vile woman.

789
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,240
You're right. But I'm not vile, my fate is vile.

790
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,180
Come son, have sweets.

791
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,899
No Chotoma, I can't eat anything.

792
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,100
I was invited by Mr. Sridhar for lunch.

793
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,839
I've over-eaten.

794
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,020
Who? Sridhar?

795
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,240
He's an alcoholic. he's a mere clerk working under us.

796
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,180
How could you have lunch at his place?

797
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:16,919
Shame! Shame! You've ruined the reputation of your family.

798
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,020
If people shouldn't accept invitation from Mr. Sridhar..

799
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,200
..just because he's an alcoholic then no one should enter your house.

800
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,180
What do you mean? That I am.. I am..

801
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,140
You've brought snacks for Pradip?

802
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,160
He won't eat anything here.

803
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,040
Don't you know that Chandrakanta has forbidden him?

804
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,980
I detest being purposely insulted.

805
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,859
No.. no.. that's not true.

806
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,240
Chotoma, give me, I'll eat it. - No, it's okay.

807
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,940
You don't have to eat anything here.

808
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,860
Come with me. - Yes. yes. take him with you.

809
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,080
Serve him.

810
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,040
You and your son can't stay without flattering the rich.

811
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,799
A mother always pampers her son.

812
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,120
Why are you getting angry, uncle?

813
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,919
Pradip, sent a couple of thousand rupees for me..

814
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,200
..after you go back to Kolkata. Only if you want to.

815
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,799
I will give you.

816
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,240
You asked the money, Chotoma didn't.

817
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,100
Let's go, chotoma.

818
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,839
Where are you?

819
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,840
Here you are. Listen to me.

820
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,040
Good! How do you know that I need money?

821
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,000
What's the matter?

822
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,880
Come on, give me some money quickly.

823
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,980
Why are you in such hurry today?

824
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,839
Don't ask me.

825
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,140
I'm in trouble since the past few days. - Is it?

826
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:51,859
What kind of problem?

827
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Give me the money.

828
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,880
What will you do with money? - I need the money for.. sick..

829
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,920
Sick? - Yes.

830
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,200
Who is sick? - My friend is sick.

831
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,000
What is he suffering from? - He's seriously sick.

832
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,980
Well, he's seriously sick. But what is he suffering from?

833
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,120
Well the serious ailment is.. thrombosis.

834
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,860
Your friend is suffering from Thrombosis? - Yes.

835
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,940
How old is he? - I can't explain so much.

836
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,860
Won't you let me meet my friend for the last time?

837
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,880
I may not be able to meet him.

838
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,940
Come on give me some money quickly. - Okay.

839
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,240
Give me some more. - I also need money.

840
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,160
Take it from elsewhere.

841
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,819
Brother.. - Yes.

842
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,779
Are you going to meet? - Whom?

843
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,800
Your friend for the last time. - Idiot!

844
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,120
I'll tell her.

845
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,060
Here is Boroma.

846
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,200
Boroma, Pradip is there.

847
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,040
Go and meet her. - Yes.

848
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,240
Where are you going? - I'm going out.

849
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,220
You came home a little while ago..

850
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,919
..and you're going out again?

851
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,140
I've been noticing lately that you don't stay at home.

852
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,180
I'm caught in lot of work. - I know.

853
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,220
Come and sit here. I want to talk to you. Come.

854
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,200
Hello Sunanda!

855
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,000
Why are you late? - I'm not late. I'm not late.

856
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,240
What's the time? We still have time.

857
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,860
Don't be angry. Come with me.

858
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,799
I feel lost when you're angry.

859
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,180
Don't be angry.

860
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,880
I feel lost when you're angry. - Enough!

861
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,180
Do you know how much trouble I had to go through to get the taxi?

862
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,980
I kicked a fellow down and then go in the taxi.

863
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,180
The daughter of the Mukherjees from Bhawanipur.. - Yes.

864
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,080
Chandra Mukherjee.. - Oh!

865
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,060
..I've fixed your marriage with her.

866
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,140
The girl is very beautiful. - Awesome!

867
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,980
She's very beautiful.

868
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,940
Did Anup tell you about her? - Yes.

869
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,820
She knows music.

870
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:31,020
Well, the amount of ornaments she was wearing..

871
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,980
..is enough to create music.

872
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,160
Are you pulling my leg?

873
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,900
You'll be surprised to hear the amount of dowry they're offering.

874
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,900
Mother, please spare me.

875
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:44,060
The day Anup da showed me the girl I was already shocked.

876
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,900
Don't shock me further.

877
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,000
I'll leave now.

878
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,100
Hey! Sit down. - No. No.

879
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,100
Why are you in such hurry?

880
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,040
What important work do you have?

881
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,200
Sick.. sick.. - Sick?

882
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,240
Serious ailment.

883
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,020
My friend is on death-bed. - Who?

884
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,819
You don't know him.

885
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,240
I don't know him?

886
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,220
What is he suffering from?

887
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,240
Stroke.. stroke.. he has suffered a stroke.

888
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,220
Thrombosis. Didn't you hear Anu da speaking about him?

889
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,220
Thrombosis has become very common these days.

890
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,240
Thrombosis? - Yes. Thrombosis.

891
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,899
His mother must be in great pain. Lord, save him.

892
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,000
Pray to lord so that he saves him.

893
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,960
I'll go now. - Listen to me.

894
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,800
His condition is serious.

895
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:29,080
Anything can happen any moment.

896
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,180
I'll leave now. - Okay. Go. Go. - Yes.

897
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,120
I've been speaking all this while to a deaf man.

898
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,840
No.. no.. I've a lock.

899
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:42,000
I can't lock the door unless you leave.

900
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,220
You don't have to lock the door.

901
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,100
Your ears have been locked by god.

902
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,820
Kanai? Kanai?

903
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,040
No one named Kanai came here.

904
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:57,080
Yes! he had come. He had come. - Who?

905
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,099
Mr. Pradip. - He is the one who comes.

906
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,240
He is the curse of my life.

907
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,860
Sin? Who has committed sin? - No one.

908
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,200
I've sinned. I have.

909
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,920
Oh god! One must be a great sinner if he confronts a deaf man like you.

910
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,800
When did I commit a sin?

911
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:17,139
Why do you want to slap me?

912
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,220
You won't be slapped.

913
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,080
I'll slap myself. I'll slap myself. - What?

914
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,920
What did you say? I'll slap myself? Why?

915
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,980
I didn't tell you.

916
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,840
Why shall I slap myself?

917
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:29,899
What have I done? - Is he going to beat me?

918
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,219
You want me to slap myself? - Nibaran..

919
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,040
You want me to slap myself? - Nibaran.. no, Nibaran. Don't come forward.

920
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,080
How dare you?

921
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,160
Please don't come forward.

922
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,819
Why won't I come forward? I'll definitely come forward.

923
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:40,839
I didn't say anything to you.

924
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:46,040
Okay. Henceforth be careful of what you speak.

925
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,860
Let me warn you. - Okay.

926
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:53,799
I'll think before I act.

927
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,180
Don't delay. Wake up, Rahul.

928
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:04,180
I have to gather courage and express my feelings by any means.

929
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,220
I want to say something important.

930
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,820
What of Shikha comes?

931
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,020
Go and check if Shikha has come.

932
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,960
But you must listen to me or we'll be in trouble.

933
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,980
I've managed all this while.

934
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,900
I hope you understand. I won't take much time.

935
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,060
How much?

936
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,840
It's okay. Keep the change.

937
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,040
Has Seema returned? - No, she hasn't. - Good god!

938
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,019
I don't know what's going to happen.

939
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,000
Nothing is going to happen, it has already happened.

940
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,220
Why are you so worried?

941
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,120
Why are you worried when I'm with you?

942
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,019
Strange !

943
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,960
Pradip will definitely manage everything.

944
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,860
If Pradip says that he wants to marry boroma will be elated.

945
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,040
She'll agree instantly.

946
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,940
I'm not sure. I feel scared.

947
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,240
You worry too much.

948
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,160
What's the problem? Why do you worry so much?

949
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,040
I'm assuring you. Why don't you understand my plan?

950
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:14,780
I'll stay behind Pradip and get approval to our relationship.

951
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,120
Do you understand?

952
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,160
Well, remember something.

953
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:22,080
Until I get the permission the affair between us.. - No!

954
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,120
We're having an affair.

955
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:27,799
You can't deny it. We're already in a relationship.

956
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:32,920
Don't reveal anything about our affair to anyone, not even Shikha. Okay?

957
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,000
I won't say anything to her.. - Very good.

958
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,040
..but, it's very difficult to keep secrets from Shikha.

959
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,900
Why is it difficult? She won't find out if you don't tell her.

960
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,139
Why should I keep our relation a secret?

961
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,980
Well, you need to keep it a secret because..

962
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:45,080
I haven't committed any crime that I must hide it. - That's right.

963
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,019
But the matter is.. you're a coward.. - Coward?

964
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,019
You can't even keep a secret?

965
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,040
Am I a coward? Or are you a coward? - Yes.

966
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,160
Yes, but the matter is..

967
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,000
You're Pradip's elder brother.

968
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,000
Why don't you gather courage and say it before he does?

969
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,840
Actually courage.. - No.. I don't wish to listen to you.

970
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,200
Please don't go away, listen to me. - No.

971
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,900
Listen to me. I can say it right now.

972
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:02,919
I've no problem in talking about our relationship.

973
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,100
But, I can't because of a fundamental problem.

974
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,200
What is it? - What?

975
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,900
You don't know how mischievous Pradip is.

976
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,980
If he finds out about our relationship he'll place us..

977
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,800
..in the foreground and hide behind us.

978
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,179
I'll have to manage everything.

979
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,800
That's why I was telling you .

980
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,960
Why are you so unreasonable?

981
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,220
Please promise me.

982
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,840
I'll try. - That's enough.

983
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,140
But, I can't promise you.

984
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,940
You don't have to promise anything else.

985
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:38,920
&quot;You create melodies a you shower down.&quot;

986
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:51,160
&quot;Why do you whisper in my ears?&quot;

987
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,920
&quot;Oh rains..&quot;

988
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:19,650
You? When did you come?

989
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:23,530
A little while ago.

990
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:28,290
Well you.. didn't you go out today?

991
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,350
How can I go out?

992
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:32,430
I'm very busy as my exams are knocking on the doors.

993
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:36,470
Slow down, madam. Why are you in such hurry? - No..

994
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,270
Were you studying throughout the day?

995
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,290
I've no other option.

996
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:43,490
I've to prepare for the exams. - You're right.

997
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,590
But after seeing your make-up and attire I think..

998
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,310
..the preparations are going on really well.

999
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,250
No.. I mean..

1000
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:52,470
You don't have to explain anything.

1001
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,630
What's this? - This?

1002
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:58,270
Do they distribute the film schedules in every home?

1003
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:02,469
Schedule? - Yes. This is it. Look.

1004
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:05,670
Look at it carefully. - Yes. I mean no..

1005
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:08,690
Pradip, what do you think?

1006
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,350
You told the cook that you won't have dinner tonight?

1007
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:12,610
What can I do?

1008
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,450
What shall I do if I'm not hungry?

1009
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,330
Why are you never hungry? What's wrong with you?

1010
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,570
You don't even talk to e properly nowadays.

1011
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:23,250
Why are you troubling me like this? - Okay.

1012
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,330
I'll leave for Chandrapura on Tuesday.

1013
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:26,690
I won't trouble you anymore.

1014
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,590
Pradip, what sort of craziness is this?

1015
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,370
Don't hurt your mother, Pradip.

1016
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:40,450
Anup.. what's wrong with Pradip? - Boroma..

1017
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,430
Why does he look so restless?

1018
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:45,650
Why is he restless?

1019
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,670
People who are land in this condition go mad.

1020
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:50,570
He's at least sane. - Why?

1021
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,550
Please explain what's wrong with him.

1022
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:57,310
How many times should I explain you?

1023
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:58,610
You don't try to understand.

1024
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:00,630
Didn't I tell you about him?

1025
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,450
Well, that one..

1026
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:07,670
Don't you understand? - Oh!

1027
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,349
It's because of it.

1028
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:14,670
I'm ready to do anything for Pradip's happiness.

1029
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,310
But, how can I give my consent to this relationship?

1030
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:21,610
I don't have the right to ruin the reputation of your family.

1031
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,670
Okay, then take care of your reputation.

1032
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,490
You don't have to worry about your son.

1033
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:28,510
You'll regret if he take some wrong step. - What? - Yes.

1034
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,690
What will he do?

1035
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,470
Anu, did he say anything to you?

1036
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,430
What can he say?

1037
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,290
People don't announce before they take such decisions.

1038
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:37,430
I witnessed a incident recently. - What?

1039
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:39,630
Day before yesterday.. he applied for a job..

1040
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,450
..in some bloody strange country.

1041
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:43,370
What? - Yes.

1042
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:47,510
Bloody.. bloody.. which place is this?

1043
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,610
It's a dangerous place if he goes there then..

1044
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,530
What a problem!

1045
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,650
What shall I do, Anu?

1046
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:56,570
I'm trying to convince you since the past few days.

1047
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:59,450
Give your consent. Yes.

1048
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,530
But.. - Boroma..

1049
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,310
..government has legally ruled out all caste discrimination.

1050
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,470
But you still believe in the caste system.

1051
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:13,250
But, she's from a completely different caste.

1052
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:14,530
Boroma, let me warn you the last time.

1053
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,389
If you still stick to your prejudice..

1054
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,530
..then I'll also marry a girl from a different caste.

1055
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:21,509
Let me see who stays with you. - Listen.. - No.. no..

1056
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,349
Anu, listen to me. Listen to me. - What?

1057
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:25,690
What can do if you choose someone?

1058
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,390
I'll have to accept it.

1059
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:29,410
But, I can't live without both of you.

1060
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,349
That's why I've been telling you to give your consent.

1061
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,350
You know how sentimental he is.

1062
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,450
He won't stay here. - No. No. I don't want that.

1063
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,450
Let him do what he wishes.

1064
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:40,690
Let's go and discuss the matter with Janki. Come.

1065
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,410
You can consult with her but it's just a formality. - Yes.

1066
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:44,670
Don't hurt him.

1067
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:52,250
Stop reading the magazine.

1068
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,510
Shake hands with me. - Why?

1069
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:55,310
All round success.

1070
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:56,370
We've won the semi-finals.

1071
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,490
Just waiting for the finals.

1072
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:00,509
That's the most difficult one. - Of course it is.

1073
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,630
He is a very serious man of strict principles.

1074
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:05,370
But, I'll handle him and get his consent.

1075
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:10,550
Well.. well. What about my treat?

1076
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:12,290
Hey! Don't act smart.

1077
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:14,650
I won't talk to you again if you repeat this.

1078
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:20,650
What's wrong in it?

1079
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:26,290
It's the oldest and the latest custom in the civilized society.

1080
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:28,230
Will you please stop? - Why shall I stop?

1081
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:34,330
You won't get a kiss unless we get married as per rituals.

1082
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:38,470
As per the rituals.. what about going to the register office..

1083
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:43,430
..and signing the marriage document? - Sign?

1084
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,370
No, I won't do that.

1085
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,430
You can leave me few days after a registry marriage.

1086
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:52,410
I wanted to get married as per the rituals of Hinduism.

1087
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,450
Okay, as you wish.

1088
01:17:54,590 --> 01:18:02,230
I'll try to suppress my desires until I get married as per rituals.

1089
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,550
Yes, you have to.

1090
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:06,490
When are you going to Chandrapura?

1091
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:08,390
On Friday.

1092
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:12,650
In the mean time write a letter to your mother and inform her.

1093
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:14,610
Mother is coming on Sunday.

1094
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:16,509
You talk to her.

1095
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:44,690
Oh no! you've high fever.

1096
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:49,490
Shree.. come and sit next to me.

1097
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:52,450
How come you contracted such high fever?

1098
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:54,550
The herbal medicines aren't working.

1099
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,670
I'll go and call Dr. Majumdar. - No dear.

1100
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,469
Sit next to me, don't go anywhere.

1101
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:07,650
Here.. on this spot. Gas is accumulating in these places.

1102
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:09,630
No. no. It's not a serious problem.

1103
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:12,530
I think there may be a leakage in a couple of places.

1104
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:16,450
Maybe a leakage? I suspect that the ventilation arrangement..

1105
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,309
..has been completely disrupted.

1106
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,470
Mr. Mitra, the wiring is so old.

1107
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:23,490
Why didn't you change them? - No. actually it was working so..

1108
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:25,250
You've taken a risk.

1109
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:28,630
Don't you know that a leakage can lead to an annotation and a terrible accident?

1110
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,250
Well, I'll complete the drawings.

1111
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:34,349
I'll get down into the mines and supervise the work.

1112
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:37,670
No! No! Why do you want to risk your life?

1113
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:46,670
Manager has said that he's going to stop the work.

1114
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,670
We can stop the work in the pit at that time.

1115
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,390
No. No. we can't stop the work.

1116
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:55,290
We must fulfill our commitment or we'll have to incur huge loss.

1117
01:19:57,310 --> 01:20:00,590
I think it won't be wise to take such a huge risk.

1118
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:04,250
What if any accident happens?

1119
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,350
Keep quiet. You don't have to interfere in all the matters.

1120
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:10,630
I'll complete the drawing tonight.

1121
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:13,570
I want all of you to be ready near the pit at 7 in the morning.

1122
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,390
You're still standing here? Go!

1123
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:18,290
Aster.. - Who?

1124
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:20,309
Oh Sridhar!

1125
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:24,430
Do you want to say something?

1126
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:33,330
Well, I want to say.. please don't let him go down pit number three.

1127
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:48,429
But Sridhar, Pradip doesn't listen to me at all.

1128
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:57,310
How can I stand quietly and watch him face dangers?

1129
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:02,530
Please stop him, sir. Please stop him.

1130
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:06,429
Sridhar! Sridhar! Get up. get up.

1131
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:14,650
Sir, for the past 25 years I have..

1132
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,349
Pradip! Pradip!

1133
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:46,230
I told you that I'll stop the work in this pit.

1134
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,690
Why do you've to go down to check?

1135
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,550
I must visit the pit.

1136
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:53,410
He wants to say that.. - Why do you interfere in everything?

1137
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:55,490
He has already told you that he'll stop the work there..

1138
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,370
..and it's dangerous to..

1139
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:59,390
Do you want me to explain what I do?

1140
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,690
Go back to your work.

1141
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,250
You don't have any feelings for me?

1142
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,610
You spent seven days working in the middle of poisonous gas.

1143
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:41,250
What if an accident happened?

1144
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,690
I've made arrangements to avoid any kind of accident.

1145
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:45,630
Why did you have to do the work.

1146
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,490
We have employed engineers for the job.

1147
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:49,570
What are they for? Just for show?

1148
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:53,290
You spent a lot of money to make your son a mining engineer.

1149
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:55,350
What was that for? Just for show?

1150
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,430
I can't win an argument against you.

1151
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,290
I want to say something very clearly.

1152
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:01,290
You were the only one I had with me when I became a widow.

1153
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:03,450
I've no one except you in my life.

1154
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,310
I can't allow you to take any kind of risk.

1155
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:08,469
But tell me something, mother.

1156
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:12,250
How can I risk the lives of so many people?

1157
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,469
You are worried for me.

1158
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:17,270
Similarly, their families are worried for them.

1159
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,650
Why did you want me to come back home?

1160
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:24,690
Janki isn't well. She wants to see you. So.. - Oh!

1161
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:28,330
Why don't you consult a good doctor?

1162
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:32,230
What's the use of consulting a doctor?

1163
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,450
She's n great pain.

1164
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,310
I just pray that god gives her relief.

1165
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:44,550
Pradip, bring the girl home some day.

1166
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,570
Which girl? Who are you talking about?

1167
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:53,570
I'm ready to give my consent to anything that makes you happy.

1168
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:55,610
Janki has also given her consent.

1169
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:58,250
Bring her home some day.

1170
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:00,590
I also want to see whom you've chosen.

1171
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:03,590
Mother, I don't want anything else.

1172
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:06,230
I just wish I get a mother like you in every life.

1173
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:11,349
My son, leave me. Enough. Leave me.

1174
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:12,690
Come quickly. There's a trunk call for you.

1175
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:13,550
Who is it?

1176
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,550
A gentleman has called from aunt's hospital.

1177
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:18,290
Bring it forward.

1178
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:20,490
Hello. Who is speaking?

1179
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,330
Yes. Yes. Shikha speaking.

1180
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,470
I'm Dr. Roy from Selco hospital.

1181
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,269
From the hospital where your mother works.

1182
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,510
Come here immediately.

1183
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:31,309
Why? What has happened to mother?

1184
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,269
Why are you silent?

1185
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:34,490
Please tell me what has happened to her.

1186
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:37,610
Your mother lost consciousness this morning.

1187
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:40,630
I suspect she has suffered a stroke. - Stroke?

1188
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,490
Stroke? Who has suffered a stroke?

1189
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,670
How is she now?

1190
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:46,509
Has she regained consciousness? No?

1191
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,570
Yes. yes. I'll start right now. Yes, immediately.

1192
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:52,429
Shikha, why are you silent?

1193
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,269
Sikha!

1194
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:55,630
What happened, Shikha?

1195
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:57,330
Why aren't you speaking?

1196
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,610
What has happened? Tell me.

1197
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:01,509
Well.. I'm ruined. - What happened?

1198
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,590
Mother has suffered a stroke again this morning.

1199
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:06,290
I think mother won't survive.

1200
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:14,490
Mother! Mother!

1201
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,470
Mother..

1202
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:39,590
Did she suffer a stroke earlier? - Yes.

1203
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:42,250
She suffered a stroke ten years back.

1204
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,670
I also expected this answer.

1205
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,570
Didn't she regain consciousness after the incident?

1206
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:49,310
No.

1207
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:56,630
Mother.. mother..

1208
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:03,370
Mother.. mother.. speak to me.

1209
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:05,450
Mother.. mother.. speak to me.

1210
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:06,570
What are you doing?

1211
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:09,230
It's not right to break down like this. Come here.

1212
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:12,570
No doctor don't ask me to leave mother and go.

1213
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,389
I'll stay next to her.

1214
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:16,390
Mother.. mother..

1215
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,550
Mother.. mother..

1216
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,650
Mother.. - Who is it? - It's me.

1217
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:43,390
I'm Shikha, mother, Shikha.

1218
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,269
Your daughter Shikha.

1219
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:48,310
Can't you recognize me? - Shikha!

1220
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,450
So, you've come?

1221
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:53,330
You've come, my daughter?

1222
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:57,690
Mother.. mother..

1223
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:07,450
Shikha.. Shikha..

1224
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:10,610
I've always cheated you all my life.

1225
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:18,250
I can't die without telling you the truth.

1226
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,230
Why are you so restless, mother ?

1227
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,550
Who have you cheated?

1228
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:26,570
Keep quiet, mother. Keep quite. - No.. no..

1229
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,690
I won't get time in future.

1230
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:39,509
Listen.. the identity that you've grown up with isn't your real identity.

1231
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:42,510
What do you mean?

1232
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:45,470
What do you want to say?

1233
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:57,270
Aren't you my real.. - No.. no.. I'm not your mother.

1234
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,670
Mother!

1235
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:04,490
What are you saying?

1236
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:09,570
You aren't y mother? - No.. no..

1237
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:18,570
Actually.. we don't even share a blood relation.

1238
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:23,589
I've no relation with you?

1239
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:26,330
What's my real identity?

1240
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:29,610
You come from a very reputed and noble family.

1241
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:33,350
You were born into a rich and aristocratic family.

1242
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:38,550
But.. but.. - But what? What is it?

1243
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,450
Tell me everything, mother.

1244
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:41,610
Tell me everything.

1245
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:45,470
Why can't I see you, Shikha?

1246
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:52,410
What's this? Why do I feel breathless? - Mother!

1247
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:59,530
Shikha.. Shikha.. I've written down everything in my diary.

1248
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:03,590
I.. - Mother!

1249
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:07,550
I can't see anything. Everything looks dark.

1250
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:10,550
Shikha! - Mother!

1251
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:12,389
Shikha! - Mother!

1252
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:14,250
Shikha! - Mother!

1253
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:19,550
Mother, get up.

1254
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,690
What have you done, mother?

1255
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:24,230
I feel lost.

1256
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:28,410
I can't keep any relation with you after this.

1257
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:39,550
That's because when you get this letter I would've gone far away.

1258
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:12,309
Shikha..

1259
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:17,150
You?

1260
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:27,490
If you had planned to betray me then why did you come in my life?

1261
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:34,290
You're mistaken, Pradip.

1262
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:39,209
I can't cheat you, so I'm going away.

1263
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:40,450
Shikha..

1264
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:46,230
..we're standing at a juncture in our life..

1265
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:49,250
..from where we can't go back.

1266
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,370
I didn't wish to go back.

1267
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:59,290
But.. but.. fate has forced me to go back.

1268
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:06,330
Even a couple of days back I thought that I was very lucky.

1269
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:11,270
But today.. - Parents don't stay with us forever.

1270
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:17,230
But what has happened that you've decided to go away from everybody?

1271
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:21,290
Mother's death has definitely hurt me.

1272
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:27,330
But, before death she ruined my life forever.

1273
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:32,310
Shikha, if you believe me then please share everything with me.

1274
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:35,490
You are the only person I can trust, Pradip.

1275
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:41,370
But.. but.. after hearing the truth you may detest me.

1276
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,170
Tell me.. please tell me what has happened.

1277
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:49,070
Lie. Everything in my life is a lie, Pradip.

1278
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:54,510
The identity that I've grown up with isn't my real identity.

1279
01:33:55,330 --> 01:34:00,210
The person whom I knew was my mother isn't my mother.

1280
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:04,269
I don't even have any blood relation with her.

1281
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:06,470
What do you mean?

1282
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:14,390
I've lost my identity not only before you but before everybody.

1283
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,090
Who told you?

1284
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:21,130
Mother.. she told me everything.

1285
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:23,330
She couldn't reveal everything to me.

1286
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:25,410
She died after saying only this much.

1287
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:30,490
Pradip, how do I face you now?

1288
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:34,230
I don't have an identity.

1289
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:46,290
Shikha.. even if your mother's words are true..

1290
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:51,190
..you'll live with just one identity..

1291
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,330
..that you are my wife.

1292
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:57,230
Who are you? From where have you come?

1293
01:34:57,310 --> 01:34:59,470
What's your identity I don't want to know anything.

1294
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:05,190
I can never forget the honor you've given me today.

1295
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:09,230
But Pradip, your mother would like to know who I am..

1296
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:11,210
..and what's my identity.

1297
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:14,350
No.. no.. No, Pradip.

1298
01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:17,370
I can't ruin your reputation.

1299
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:20,530
Forget me, Pradip. Forget me.

1300
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:27,350
Shikha, listen to me. Give me a week's time.

1301
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:30,330
If mother doesn't accept you within this time..

1302
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,110
..and if you have to leave this place..

1303
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:35,410
..then we'll go away from here together.

1304
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:44,450
Listen.. all of you know that son-in-law..

1305
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:49,210
..that son-in-law was killed by a tiger.

1306
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:56,130
No.. it was a lie.

1307
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:05,350
Actually.. actually.. he was murdered. - Murdered?

1308
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:09,210
Yes, he was murdered.

1309
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:12,410
He was murdered.

1310
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:15,210
What? What did you say?

1311
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,310
He was murdered?

1312
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,190
Who? Who told you?

1313
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:23,170
Son-in-law told me.

1314
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:27,370
He said these words to the manager before he died.

1315
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:30,210
Who? Who killed him?

1316
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:33,309
Speak out. Who killed him? - Anugrahaha.

1317
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:42,230
That evil man killed him for his property.

1318
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:52,150
He didn't know that you were pregnant. - What happened after that?

1319
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:59,389
I had decided that I won't let that evil man be happy.

1320
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:05,170
I was ready to kill him if I had to.

1321
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:09,290
Why didn't you kill me instead?

1322
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:12,530
All problems would've ended.

1323
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:18,250
People don't get justice these days.

1324
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:23,130
So, the evil wins.

1325
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:32,170
You gave birth to a daughter.

1326
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:35,490
What? What did you say?

1327
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:40,450
I gave birth to a daughter? - Yes.

1328
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:47,150
You gave birth to a daughter. - No. No.

1329
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:53,170
What are you saying? - Yes..

1330
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:57,510
Listen to me.

1331
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:03,269
Pradip isn't your son.

1332
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:06,349
Pradip is not my son?

1333
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,350
No, daughter.

1334
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:12,170
You don't have blood ties with him.

1335
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:18,250
Then who is Pradip? - I don't know.

1336
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:22,470
You were unconscious.

1337
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:30,530
The manager brought him here and took away the girl.

1338
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:43,309
The lady doctor laid the boy beside you.

1339
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:46,490
Janki, I always treated you as my mother.

1340
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:49,390
How could you ruin my life like this?

1341
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:55,190
I can't even imagine that Pradip isn't my son and..

1342
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:58,290
..that I've no blood relation with him.

1343
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:03,150
I can understand what you're going through.

1344
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:12,429
Believe me, I had no other option at that time.

1345
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,530
Please forgive me if you can.

1346
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:32,090
Listen.. I don't want to listen to anything.

1347
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:34,450
I don't want to know where my daughter is.

1348
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:39,429
Pradip is my son. Pradip is my life.

1349
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:42,070
I want to live with him.

1350
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:45,330
Never reveal this truth to anybody.

1351
01:39:45,490 --> 01:39:48,230
Come on, swear on me.

1352
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:57,150
But.. but.. I want to tell Pradip about his real identity before I die.

1353
01:39:57,190 --> 01:40:00,110
Die. Die. I want the truth to end with you.

1354
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:02,210
Die, die right now.

1355
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:13,490
Mother.. why did you ruin my life?

1356
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:17,150
Believe me Pradip, I didn't know anything about this.

1357
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:21,510
I only know that I carried you in my womb and you're my son.

1358
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:25,130
You've cheated everybody all your life.

1359
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:28,210
You want to cheat yourself now? - Pradeep..

1360
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:31,450
Mother, will you tell me the truth?

1361
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,450
From where did you bring me?

1362
01:40:35,110 --> 01:40:36,349
What's my identity?

1363
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:39,330
Don't I've any identity?

1364
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:44,410
Am I a.. am I a.. - Pradip!

1365
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:50,070
Pradip.. come..

1366
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:05,190
Pradip, please forgive me.

1367
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:11,190
Granny, please tell me who brought me here.

1368
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:13,410
What's my identity?

1369
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,170
I don't know.

1370
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:19,430
The manager knows everything.

1371
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,530
What about the girl?

1372
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:27,270
What happened to her?

1373
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:33,470
The lady doctor took her away.

1374
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:36,330
Who? Who took her away?

1375
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:38,470
The lady doctor.

1376
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:44,290
Lady doctor?

1377
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:47,250
I'll be back soon.

1378
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:49,530
I'll be back soon. - Don't go. Don't go, Pradip.

1379
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:51,370
Please don't stop me.

1380
01:41:53,130 --> 01:41:55,290
I've to leave everything to help you.

1381
01:42:01,170 --> 01:42:02,290
What happened, Pradip?

1382
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:05,450
I don't understand what you want to say.

1383
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:12,090
Strange things happen in life which we fail to understand.

1384
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:19,070
I'm confused, how do I explain it to you?

1385
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:29,290
Pradip. - Forget it.

1386
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:33,490
Shikha, what has your mother said about your identity?

1387
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:36,090
Please share the details with me.

1388
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:39,190
Why do you want to know it?

1389
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:42,490
It has become the most important thing in my life, Shikha.

1390
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:47,070
Or I wouldn't have come and met you.

1391
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:58,490
She said that I was born in a very reputed family.

1392
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:02,450
I was born in a rich nobleman's family.

1393
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:07,290
She couldn't say anything more.

1394
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:11,210
I found certain things written in her old diary.

1395
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:15,210
The other things weren't legible.

1396
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:18,230
She mentioned 10,000 rupees.

1397
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:22,150
Colliery. Chandrakanta Chakraborty.

1398
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:26,309
What did you say? Chandra Kanta Chakraborty?

1399
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:30,389
Chandrakanta?

1400
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:42,530
Well.. now I've understood.

1401
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:46,490
I've understood everything.

1402
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:57,310
Shikha, mother had told me to take you home.

1403
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:03,169
Why didn't you tell me earlier that mother wants to meet me?

1404
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:09,290
As one part of earth gets destroyed..

1405
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:10,490
The other part is built up.

1406
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,210
This fact needs no mention.

1407
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:16,410
Let's go, Shikha. - But..

1408
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:18,090
Don't hesitate.

1409
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:19,190
Come.

1410
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:29,150
Look at her.

1411
01:44:30,370 --> 01:44:32,110
Who is she?

1412
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:40,469
I don't recognize her.

1413
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:45,410
How can you? You never saw her.

1414
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:49,210
She is your daughter.

1415
01:44:57,150 --> 01:45:02,070
She.. she is my daughter?

1416
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:13,150
Mother, you had deprived her from everything.

1417
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:18,210
Today she is standing right before you.

1418
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:24,450
Can't you accept her? - Yes. Yes.

1419
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:46,330
Who is it?

1420
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:54,090
Mother.. - Pradip..

1421
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:08,330
You didn't come close to me after that.

1422
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:14,290
You've distanced me in a day.

1423
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:40,270
Pradip.. - Please let me go now.

1424
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:43,530
You know that I'm your mother.

1425
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:46,150
Why do you want to go away?

1426
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:49,130
What right do I have to stay here?

1427
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:52,350
What's my identity? - Why?

1428
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:55,270
I'm your mother and you're my son.

1429
01:47:55,450 --> 01:47:58,410
Don't I have any right on you just because I didn't give birth to you?

1430
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:01,330
You definitely have right over me.

1431
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:04,169
I don't know my identity.

1432
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:09,390
Whatever my identity and wherever I stay, mother..

1433
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:13,370
..you'll always remain my mother.

1434
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,450
You'll always remain my mother.

1435
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:18,509
Then why do you want to go away?

1436
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:21,350
Why?

1437
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:32,530
I've enjoyed somebody else's wealth like a thief all this while.

1438
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:39,490
If I stay back, nothing van be more disgraceful.

1439
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:43,370
I have to go.

1440
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:49,090
But Shikha.. what about Shikha?

1441
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:52,290
Can't you stay back for her? - No.

1442
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:57,089
I've to go away from here for her, mother.

1443
01:48:58,110 --> 01:49:00,190
I can't keep any relation with her.

1444
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:02,330
But, you love her.

1445
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:04,430
She also loves you.

1446
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:10,510
Marry her and stay here with me. - No, mother.

1447
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:13,530
That's not possible.

1448
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:18,389
It's not only wrong but it's a sin even to think of marrying a girl..

1449
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:21,430
..after knowing the truth of my identity.

1450
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:27,450
Moreover, I don't have the right to ruin your family's reputation.

1451
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:30,250
Whatever, I won't let you go.

1452
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:32,330
Mother.. please let me go, mother.

1453
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:34,490
How can I live without you, Pradip?

1454
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:41,330
How can I survive without you, Pradip? - Mother.. don't get restless.

1455
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:45,130
Mother.. don't get restless.

1456
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:50,130
Mother.. think about me.

1457
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:54,430
I had everything yesterday but I've nothing today.

1458
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:58,330
I don't even have an identity. - Pradip..

1459
01:49:58,370 --> 01:50:03,110
Mother.. mother.. calm down. Mother..

1460
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:09,510
It may hurt us a lot but we've no other option but to accept it.

1461
01:50:17,330 --> 01:50:23,070
Okay. Promise me that you won't go anywhere without telling me.

1462
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:25,469
Mother.. - I don't want to hear any excuses.

1463
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:29,510
Promise me or I won't go away from here.

1464
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:37,170
Okay. As you wish.

1465
01:51:59,210 --> 01:52:00,090
Pradip..

1466
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:21,269
Pradip..

1467
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:23,530
Pradip..

1468
01:52:35,190 --> 01:52:38,349
Mother, I'm going away despite promising you..

1469
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:41,230
..because I'm very weak.

1470
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:45,090
What if I forget my resolutions when I see you?

1471
01:52:45,330 --> 01:52:48,530
So, accept my regards as I stealthily go away like a thief.

1472
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:55,130
I hope your blessing always stay with me wherever I am.

1473
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:58,349
Pradip.. Pradip!

1474
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:02,510
Pradip!

1475
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:05,070
Pradip!

1476
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:16,290
He promised me and yet he went away without taking anything.

1477
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:18,090
What shall we do now, mother?

1478
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:20,110
He'll never come back.

1479
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:24,150
He gave me back everything that I deserved.

1480
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:25,429
And now he went away forever.

1481
01:53:26,230 --> 01:53:27,389
Mother, bring him back.

1482
01:53:28,090 --> 01:53:29,190
Bring him back.

1483
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:33,410
Yes, I'll definitely bring him back.

1484
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:35,110
I'll definitely bring him back.

1485
01:53:35,150 --> 01:53:38,129
I'm sure that he has gone to Chandrapura.

1486
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:40,530
Only the manager knows his identity.

1487
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:44,090
He won't go away without meeting him.

1488
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:48,269
But.. if he goes away from Chandrapura..

1489
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:52,170
..I'll never get him back. Never.

1490
01:53:52,210 --> 01:53:53,410
Let's go.

1491
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:46,170
What's the matter?

1492
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:47,510
What brings you here in this condition at this hour?

1493
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:49,389
Sit down. - No, I'm fine.

1494
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:53,390
If it was something urgent, you could've called me.

1495
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:55,230
I didn't have the time to do so.

1496
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:59,130
Moreover, I don't have the right to call you.

1497
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:02,170
So, I came here.

1498
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:04,389
What do you want to say?

1499
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:08,309
I want to know why you ruined my life to fulfill your selfish needs.

1500
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:13,510
No.. I had nothing to gain.

1501
01:55:14,410 --> 01:55:16,330
I was forced to do it.

1502
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:23,170
Who forced you? - Dev Narayan.

1503
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:26,530
He made me promise when he died..

1504
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:56,210
Mr. Pathak. Mr. Mitra. Come with me.

1505
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:57,290
I'll go down right now.

1506
01:55:57,310 --> 01:56:00,190
Explosions are still going on. How will you go there?

1507
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:04,290
The way I've forced so many people to risk their lives.

1508
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:34,110
Water.

1509
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:41,450
Why did you stop? Let's go. - Don't go ahead, sir.

1510
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:48,470
So many people are waiting for us to rescues their lives..

1511
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:50,250
..and you want me to stay here?

1512
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:52,430
If you're scared you can stay back. I'm going ahead.

1513
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:59,490
Water.. water..

1514
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:02,070
Who is around?

1515
01:57:06,170 --> 01:57:07,210
Water..

1516
01:58:12,530 --> 01:58:15,210
He has gone down. He has gone down.

1517
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:16,530
Please send me there. Please send me there.

1518
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:19,410
Please send me there. - Calm down.

1519
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:23,290
Water..

1520
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:48,530
Water..

1521
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:15,349
Sir.. sir, please get my son out.

1522
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:16,530
Please get my son out.

1523
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:18,430
He has three children.

1524
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:21,130
Please get my son back.

1525
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:23,250
Ah! Calm down, Kamal.

1526
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:28,150
Why just your Bhiku? I'll get everybody trapped inside.

1527
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:30,430
If I can't do that then I too won't come back.

1528
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:33,530
I'll go down with you. I'll go.

1529
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:35,510
I'll go with you. I'll also go.

1530
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:06,269
Sir, there danger ahead.

1531
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:09,150
Don't go forward. Don't go.

1532
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:12,269
Go there, I'll go down and try once. - No.

1533
02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:13,350
I won't let you go down.

1534
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:16,130
What are you saying? So many lives are at risk.

1535
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:18,349
I can't sit idle. - No.. you can't go.

1536
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:21,350
I won't let you go. You can't go. I'll go.

1537
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:28,090
Pradip!

1538
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:30,390
Pradip!

1539
02:00:32,090 --> 02:00:33,130
Pradip!

1540
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:34,250
Pradip!

1541
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:45,530
No! No!

1542
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:48,410
No! Pradip! Pradip!

1543
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:54,429
Who is around? Help! Help me!

1544
02:00:54,530 --> 02:00:59,210
Who is around? Help! Me! Help!

1545
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:04,150
Don't be scared. Don't be scared. I'm coming.

1546
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:08,330
I'm coming. - Help! Help!

1547
02:01:08,410 --> 02:01:10,330
Help! Help!

1548
02:01:10,410 --> 02:01:12,389
Pradip! Pradip!

1549
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:14,230
No, Pradip!

1550
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:17,230
No, Pradip!

1551
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:32,490
Mr. Pathak!

1552
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:35,349
Mr. Banerjee!

1553
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:27,190
Water..

1554
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:29,290
Give me water.

1555
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:31,170
Give me water.

1556
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:35,290
Water.. - Get water for him. Water.

1557
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:38,410
Water..

1558
02:02:42,310 --> 02:02:43,430
Water.

1559
02:02:46,410 --> 02:02:48,150
Help him drink water, Pardip.

1560
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:51,410
Only you've the right to give him water on his death-bed.

1561
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:57,330
I? What do you mean?

1562
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:07,110
Is he my.. - Yes. Give him water.

1563
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:13,170
