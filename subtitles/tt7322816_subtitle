1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,971
The times when all of them get drunk,
leaving me sober to bear with their torture

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,973
And that you like?

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,978
When just I get drunk and
leave them to bear with my torture

6
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,981
Trends might change, but friends don’t

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,984
The sound within our hearts is friendship

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:27,986
What is the difference between a friend
and a best friend?

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,989
A friend is one
who listens to your stories

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,991
but the one in every single story, is the best friend.

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,959
And between one’s best friend and a lover?

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
The one you want beside you to be happy,
is your best friend

13
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,965
And the one we can’t imagine being without,
is your lover

14
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:55,972
The heart took flight, landing back in its own nest

15
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,980
What do you expect from someone who loves you?

16
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,982
To cry

17
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:06,983
What?

18
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,959
Have you ever cried?

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,961
Haven’t been that lucky yet.

20
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,962
Don’t worry

21
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:29,964
I’m sure you’ll cry soon.
