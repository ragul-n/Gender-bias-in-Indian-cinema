I can't hit you, huh?

I didn't steal!

17
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,898
Then what's this?
Take out the money!

18
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,999

20
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:15,772

00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:29,784
Why arrest school kids like so?

27

Hold on, my boy. I'm here!

28
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,618
-This guy's your boss, huh?
-Yes.

29
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:35,952

-Oh, God!
-I've seen it all, man!

33

I said no such thing to him, sir!

34
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:49,958
Your boy's giving me orders
not to lay hands on him!

35
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:53,370
How much you must've have
hyped yourself up for him to talk like so?

36
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,272
-Some boss, you are!
-Don't beat me.

37
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:57,916
-Boss, huh?
-I never said I was the boss!

Damn mongrels!

40
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:05,333
When asked, he says he has a license!

41
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:08,374
It's been two weeks
since you renewed that!

42
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:10,823

-For safety. Knew you'd ask.

Damn loose change!
You can keep this, too!

00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:31,888
Don't always speak highly of yourself.

53

-No sir.
-Hype up the cops, too!

54
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,437
Alright, sir.

What did you tell him?
He hit me so hard!

60
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,017
I said you're big boss,

61
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:52,249
but you get whacked
and give him all the cash?

62
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,873
-Rather than whacking him...
-Voice down! He might hear us!

63
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:58,038
Was what we got not enough?
-Why? Won't strike back?

65
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:01,913

Expect me to hit a cop?

00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,035
We toil hard and steal from others!

68
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,749
Without moving an inch,
they stole from us!

69
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:10,085
What's the difference?

70
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:12,083
The uniform, dear boy!
The police uniform!

71
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,874
Wear it and you can do anything!

72
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:16,433
We do it, it's stealing.
They do it, it's levying fine!

73
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,579
He's watching me count money!
Might do something to get me in trouble!

74
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,124
Then settle my dues.
I'm leaving!

75
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:25,431
What dues are you talking about?

76
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,148
Thought you were a big shot
and I could become like you

77
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:32,499
but I realize what my future would be
if I stick with you.

78
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,083
I've decided
what job I'm going to take up!

00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:36,494
Which is?

80
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,097
I'll put on a police uniform!

81
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,666
I'll become a cop!

<i>Since that day,
I have been a cop in my own head.</i>

89
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:12,916
<i>I decided that if I wanted to steal,
I'd do so only as a cop!</i>

90
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,999
<i>I needed to study to become a cop.</i>

91
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,791
<i>I had no parents
who could send me to school.</i>

92
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,291
<i>So, I worked
whatever job I got during the day.</i>

93
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:22,499
<i>I studied at night,
but had a hard time learning.</i>

94
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:23,624
<i>It was very difficult!</i>

95
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:27,106
<i>But it kept ringing in my head
that I wanted to become a cop!</i>

96
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:30,708
<i>I kept watching around me
what luxury a cop's life would be!</i>

97
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:33,788
<i>Take a wrong route? Fine of 50 rupees.
No license? Fine of 100 rupees.</i>

98
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:37,166
<i>In case of an accident,
money comes from both parties!</i>

99
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:40,208
<i>Money from the thief
as well from the victim of theft!</i>

100
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:43,541
<i>Anyone comes with any problem,
it'd be money for me!</i>

101
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:46,499
<i>I spent sleepless nights
yearning to become a cop!</i>

102
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,249
<i>Not just that.
I began watching a lot of cop movies!</i>

<i>What, Mr. Minor?</i>

107
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:10,796
<i>You asked for my head.
Here I am! Come take it!</i>

<i>With great difficulty,
I passed tenth grade.</i>

121
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:47,499
<i>By that, I don't mean
first in school or the state.</i>

122
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,438
<i>I just barely passed!</i>

123
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,994
<i>At one point,
I figured I couldn't study anymore</i>

124

<i>and couldn't become a cop.</i>

125
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:57,909
<i>But every robbery and act of corruption
in the country left me sleepless!</i>

126
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:01,697
<i>My heart would wince at the fact
that I wasn't there where it happened!</i>

127

It'll take another five years for me
to graduate, bro!

128
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,916
I can't study anymore, bro!

129
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,041
So let it go!

130
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:11,181
I must become a cop!
Must I study to become one?

Yes, man!

132
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,023
Clearly spell it out.

133
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:18,017
To become a cop,
must I study, or do I need certificates?

134

-You'll need certificates.
-In that case

135
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:23,766
.must I study to get it,
or is there another way?

136
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,672
You can buy it with money.

137
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:31,502
<i>So I bought all education certificates
needed for the job of a cop!</i>

138
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:34,267
<i>My respect for money increased!</i>

139

<i>I genuinely passed
only in the physical test.</i>

Hello, Mr. Minister.

157
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,155
Hi! How come this month's collection
hasn't come in yet?

158
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:07,284
Is it wrong to catch fish in the sea?

159
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:08,666
No.

160
00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:11,624
-Is it wrong to run a club?
-Who the hell said it was?

161
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,176
As we were fishing, we snuck in cocaine
and heroine and sold it in the club.

162
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:17,639
What's wrong with that?

163
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,470
Why do your cops call it <i>smuggling</i>
and arrest my brothers?

164
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,593
I'll take care of it.

165
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:26,874
It'll take me less than four minutes
to kill that inspector.

166
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,663
Then, another upright man like him
would take his place.

167
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:33,499
He'll also disturb my business
in the name of truth and justice!

168
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,465
Then, we'd kill him.
This will go on and on!

00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,008
You let them slip away
like it's nothing!

339
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:04,012
How can I rely upon you all
and run this station?

340
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:07,073
When higher authorities ask about
the smuggling suspects,

341
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:08,791
what will you say?

342
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:09,916
Answer me!

343
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:12,773
-The new inspector opened...
-<i>New inspector?</i>

344
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,373
I haven't finished any formalities
and haven't taken charge!

345
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:17,888
My goodness!

346
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:23,512
All of your jobs are at risk!

347
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,659
Tell me! What are you going to do?

348
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:30,189
How do you intend to file this? Tell me!

349
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:32,483
You answer that, too!

350
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:35,568
Must I answer that, too? Alright.

351
00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:38,779
You folks didn't arrest them
nor put them in the cell.

352
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:42,158
You didn't open the cell now
and they didn't escape. That's it!

353
00:21:42,238 --> 00:21:44,554
But the First Information Report
has been filed!

354
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,091
If the report burns up
due to short circuit,

355
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:53,260
what can you do?

356
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,454
Sir! What are you doing, sir?

357
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,874
Said your hand was hurt
and you couldn't raise it.

358
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:05,875
You're putting it out
like a fire engine!

359
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:08,291
Can you lie on Gandhi Jayanthi?

360
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:11,260
Isn't it wrong, Khader? Salute!

361
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,050
Salute me!

362
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:18,876
Sir, after knowing
the kind of man you are,

363
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:21,791
my hand will not raise and salute you.

364
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:28,391
# Are you well? Are you well? #

365
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:32,539
# Are the body and mind doing well? #

366
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:35,151
-Where is Kalirajan's house, Khader?
-Sir?

367
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,783
You heard me right!
And what you thought was right, too!

368
00:22:38,863 --> 00:22:41,361
Where is Kalirajan's house
on East Coast Road?

369
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,740
<i>[vehicle approaching]</i>

370
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:53,571
Welcome sir.

371
00:22:57,865 --> 00:23:00,324
Brother, the new inspector is here, sir!

372
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,596

373
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:05,051
What's wrong with him?

374
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,065
Inspector Karnan!

375
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:17,410
I did have a bath.

376
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,236
Your scent will tell me

377
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:24,282
how loyal you'll be
and how well we'll gel together.

378
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,178
-Did it tell you?
-Yes!

379
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:29,646
No scent of a cop in you.
You're one of us!

380
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:34,910
Thank you very much for releasing
my brothers, like we discussed.

381
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,707
Every town chases me away.

382
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:39,799
You're the first one to invite me over.

383
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:43,091
Anyway, where are your brothers?

384
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:46,665
They got a new birdie
and they're playing with it.

385
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:49,341
Must sow their wild oats, right?

386
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,280
Do you want any chicks?

387
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:55,639
Not at the moment.
If I need any later, I'll let you know.

388
00:23:57,552 --> 00:24:00,024
Alright, then. What'll you drink, kid?

389
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,511
Tell me, kid. What'll you drink?

390
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:08,920
I don't need it, old man!

391
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,628
I need nothing, old man!

392
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,239
That good enough for you?

393
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:16,701
Get pissed when you're called that, right?

394
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:18,116
The same goes here!

395
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:19,760
Your ego is within.

396
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:22,821
But mine surrounds me like Wi-Fi!

397
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:24,566
It'll get in my head!

398
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:28,994
And when that happens,
I'll lose control! That's all!

399
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:31,091
There won't be any trouble
to your business.

400
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,552
I assure you.

401
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:34,994
But don't ever call me <i>kid</i>!

402
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,375
I'm fine with <i>buddy</i>
or <i>Karnan</i> and <i>brother</i>.

403
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:44,875
Are you cool with <i>bro</i>?

404
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:50,640
What'll you drink, bro?
<i>Bro</i>-ndy or whiskey?

405
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:55,225
For freeing my brothers
and to welcome you to the city,

406
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:56,535
you get a surprise party!

-The one you like the most!
-Who?

409
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,075
Sunny Leone!

410
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:04,192
-Sunny?
-Yes.

411
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:05,583
-In Chennai?
-Yes.

412
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,785
-She's Sunny?
-Nope!

413

00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:09,155
Who are you?

508
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,596
What?

509
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:16,260
Nothing.
Just that I saw plenty of parrots.

510
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,977
Wanted to get a closer look.

511
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:21,966
Wow! Free breakfast!

512
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,482
Service, huh?

513
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:25,538
Why? Does that concern you?

514
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:27,333
Who are you? What do you want?

515
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:29,140
I'm Karnan, the inspector of this area!

516
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:33,833
Alright! How much does this all cost?

517
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:36,458
Twenty kilos in the morning.
Twenty in the evening.

518
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:39,029
So approximately 600 to 700 rupees.

519
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:42,548
So if it's 600 rupees per day
for thirty days

520
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:45,038
it's 18,000 rupees a month!

521
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,457
So much money for just parrots!

522
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:49,060
What do you gain from it?

523
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:52,867
Compared to the happiness you get from
keeping that 18,000 rupees in the bank

524
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,684
I get a little bit more!

525
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:56,564
You don't worry!

526
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:59,180
Can I take a picture? Okay?

527
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:04,201
<i>[shutter clicks]</i>

528
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:17,973
Okay.

529
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:20,621
What is this really large parrot?

530
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,207
This isn't a parrot. It's a macaw!

531
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,630
Macaw?

532
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:26,926
Does he know he's called a macaw?

533
00:34:27,307 --> 00:34:29,861
How can that be?
That's not a he, but a she.

534
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,183
So that's the problem!

535
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:34,850
A parrot doesn't know
it's called a parrot!

536
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,437
Ditto for a dog!

537
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:39,290
Only we have named all of them, right?

538
00:34:40,008 --> 00:34:41,109
What's your name?

539
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:42,470
Sindhu!

540
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,690
Sindhu?

541
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,261
Nice name. I'm Karnan!

542
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:46,621
You already told me!

543
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:48,334
Okay, Sindhu!

544
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:50,399
Let's meet up often!

545
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,326
I'll send the pictures on WhatsApp.

546
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:53,754
What's your phone number?

547
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:55,080
It's alright. Thanks.

548
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,496
I have plenty of pictures!

549
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:01,740
For any other issue,
you may need the help of police.

550
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,666
There is no such issue.

551
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:07,940
Okay. Good! Good!

552
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:10,950
See you. Bye.

553
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,786
Let's trap this parrot!

554
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:18,916
Khader, I really like that parrot!

555
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:22,192
What skin! What complexion!

556
00:35:22,272 --> 00:35:24,181
Hey, get her details!

557
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,660
She's a really good girl, sir.

558
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,041
-Won't suit you.
-I know that.

559
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:28,229
Why is that?

560
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:30,484
She's into a pet care.
An animal lover!

561
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:31,708
An animal lover?

562
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:33,286
Then she's perfect for me!

563
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:35,810
Is there a bigger animal than I?

564
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,007
Fix us up, man!

565
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:39,608
I'm not that kind of man, sir!

566
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:41,373
I am that kind of man, Khader!

567
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:42,978
Utterly despicable!

568
00:35:43,211 --> 00:35:44,549
What the hell, man?

569
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:47,194
You neither salute me
nor fix me up with a girl!

570
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:49,565
Alright, have them bring those

571
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:51,487
who often get caught for theft,
to the station.

572
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:55,344
Watch how this parrot flies over to me!

<i>[vehicle approaching]</i>

574
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:07,790
My daughter's been missing for two days,
sir.

575
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:09,619
-Two days, huh?
-Yes.

576
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,502
-Which area?
-Kumaran Colony. Third Avenue.

577
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,623
-Khader!
-Sir!

578
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:16,628
Order two mutton biryanis
from <i>Thalapakatti</i>.

579
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:18,534
<i>Thala</i> curry, too!

580
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:21,994
-What were you saying?
-Sir, my daughter is missing!

581
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:23,625
-How old is she?
-Nineteen!

582
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:25,041
She's doing her undergrad.
<i>[phone ringing]</i>

583
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:26,708
-Got a photo of her?
-Yes!

584
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:28,750
Hey! What became of that real estate case?

585
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,016
It's a lake area.
They fear there'll be problems.

586
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:33,090
-Tell them I'll finish it for them.
-Sir! Sir!

587
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,573
15% for us!

588
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:38,018
-No problem will arise! Arrange a sitting!
-Alright, sir!

589
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:39,436
Photo!

590
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:43,552
-Have you given a written complaint?
-No, sir.

591
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:44,664
You must do that!

592
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,472
You should have given a written complaint?
Right?

593
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:50,413
Provide the phone number, contact details,
info about her friends and go!

594
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:52,125
-Alright, sir.
-Get it from her!

595
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:53,416
Alright, sir. Madam.

596
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:54,669
Greetings, cop!

597
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:55,855
Refer to him, as 'sir'!

598
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:58,092
Sarath Kumar will deal with him.
Cool with it?

599
00:36:58,172 --> 00:36:59,916
-Come sir.
-Best thieves in the area, sir.

600
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:01,445
He is to thank for that, sir!

601
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:04,143
Instead of catching us
in the many places we steal,

602
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,285
he just salutes at us!

603
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:07,641
We even robbed his house once!
He just let us go!

604
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:09,288
-When asked, he said he's a cop!
-You!

605
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,185
Don't beat me.

606
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:12,547
Why hit me, sir?

607
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:15,150
Sir, my grandmother was not well!

608
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,723
Had no money to buy medicine!

609
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:18,370
So I began to steal from a young age.

610
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,702
I continued doing so
and the job's going well!

611
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,231
Now she's feeling much better
and posts videos on TikTok!

612
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:25,323
-Why you...
-What can I do about that?

613
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:27,894
Don't hit me, sir!
I won't steal anymore!

614
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:30,268
Only from now, must you steal!

615
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:33,153
You must steal big, man!

616
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,280
Grandpa!
He got us into his team, too!

617
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,528
You?

618
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:39,916
Alright, who is this damn thing?

619
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:41,742
<i>Gramps</i> Rahul!

620
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:43,271
He's my boss!

621
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:46,059
Hey, why the hell are you like this?

622
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,573
Attire isn't good! Hair isn't cut!

623
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:50,475
On seeing you, I feel sorry!

624
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:53,036
Have the two of you eaten?

625
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:57,129
Sir, you're the first cop

626
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:59,513
to ever ask me that in my entire life!

627
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,185
I'm proud of you, sir!

628
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:02,991
I am very proud.

629
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:05,803
Don't cry, guys!

630
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,549
I came up the ranks just like you did!

631
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:10,587
-But you didn't have proper guidance!
-Indeed!

632
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:13,142
Order two more biryanis to go!

633
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:15,975
-That'll do?
-Order two more!

634
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,736
Order two more and have them delivered
to the guest house!

635
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:21,320
-Come along, my dears!
-Super, sir.

636
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,725
What great food! Wonderfully tasty!

637
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,030
You're no cop, sir! You're a God!

638
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,083
This'll do, sir!

639
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:31,459
This is enough for us!

640
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,244
Not just for today.
Hereon in, you can eat here every day!

641
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:36,689
Stay here, too!

642
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:38,698
Conduct your business well!

643
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,737
But in terms of the loot,
a 60-40 share!

644
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:42,352
-Alright?
-Super!

645
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,386
-A small request, sir.
-What is it?

646
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:46,514
Can I bathe in this swimming pool
every day?

647
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:49,391
-What about me?
-You jump in that sea and die!

648
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:53,020
You can bathe here.
You can bathe there!

649
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,506
Do whatever you want!
But you must steal!

650
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:58,217
O Lord Almighty! Deity Supreme!

651
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:00,777
You have all the qualities needed
to enter politics!

652
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:02,062
-Really?
-Indeed!

653
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,617
Good! Good!

654
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:07,278
If you enter politics with that attitude,
and make me minister of education

655
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,666
-Me?
-and him for finance before he dies

656
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:12,635
we'll be inside the office
and never come out!

657
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:14,104
-Minister of Education?
-Of course.

658
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:15,781
-You?
-Yes.

659
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,374
What have you studied?

660
00:39:17,454 --> 00:39:18,901
Second grade! Isn't that enough?

661
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,163
Then you're definitely qualified!

662
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:22,278
-Hey!
-Yes?

663
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:23,952
Know 'Pet Care' Sindhu's house?

664
00:39:24,032 --> 00:39:27,492
Sindhu's 'house'?
That's not a house, sir! It's a zoo!

665
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:30,510
What's the most expensive thing in there?

666
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,616
That girl, sir!

667
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:33,556
-Hey!
-It's not that, sir!

668
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,333
She looks like a milky sweet!

669
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:38,214
So we went into her compound,
thinking it's Sethji's house

670
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,696
we found her rearing dogs!
There's more!

671
00:39:40,776 --> 00:39:43,906
One, a street dog like us.
Another, fine like her!

672
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:45,402
Another, dangerous like you!

673
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:48,045
She had them all bathed,
powdered and cradled!

674
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,798
Know how annoying it is to see that?

675
00:39:49,878 --> 00:39:51,846
Then that is what you must steal!

676
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,280
Oh, be quiet, sir!

677
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,615
We barely made it out of there alive!

678
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:57,119
-Hey, tell him!
-Yes, sir!

679
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,617
We are in trouble sir.

680
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,166
I ask you to steal
and you just don't listen!

681
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:04,475
Sir!

682
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,587
-We're ready to do it, sir!
-I am ready.

683
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,296
-Good! Good!
-Please lower that!

684
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:10,471
Excuse me, Inspector.

685
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,344
The parrot is here!

686
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:15,935
-Hold on, ma'am!
-Hello!

687
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:17,199
- Inspector!
-Hey! Let them through!

688
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:18,746
-Okay sir.
-Oh, Inspector sir.

689
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:21,678
What is it, Sindhu? How is the macaw?

690
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:24,415
Last night, someone stole our babies!

691
00:40:24,495 --> 00:40:25,731
- Wretches!
-Babies?

692
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:28,292
- Little babies, sir!
-<i>Little babies?</i>

693
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:31,232
Our dogs! 52 dogs are missing, sir!

694
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:33,716
Oh! They went missing, huh?

695
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,726
Alright! Who is this?

696
00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:38,481
-Your sister?
-She's my mother!

697
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,307
-I like this boy!
-Mother?

698
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:42,117
You mustn't hide the truth!

699
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:43,648
When did you last see them?

700
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:44,925
Did you scold them?

701
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:48,232
Nothing like that, sir!
Someone did it on purpose!

702
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,646
Yes, Sindhu! They did it on purpose!

703
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:51,974
Why simply take the risk?

704
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:54,147
There's a big market for them!
Don't you know?

705
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:55,259
A market?

706
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,394
There's a huge godown in Royapettah!

707
00:40:57,474 --> 00:41:00,367
They bring well-built stolen dogs there

708
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:02,542
kill them, slice them up

709
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:04,849
and supply the meat
to all the shops nearby!

710
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,302
What? Dog meat?

711
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:09,272
How would the buyers or eaters
know it's dog meat?

712
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:11,975
A pity! Who knows which stove
it's being fried on?

713
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,469
Don't say that, sir!

714
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:15,390
My babies can't bear the heat!

715
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,414
I raised them in an A/C environment!

716
00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:20,125
Despite knowing all this,
why haven't you taken action?

717
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,367
Didn't you just file a complaint?

718
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,385
I'll take them out today!

719
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:25,608
-Hey, Shekhar.
-Sir.

720
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:27,291
Get their phone number
and contact details!

721
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:28,575
-Okay, sir.
-Get going.

722
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,827
-Thanks, Inspector.
-Thank you.

723
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:33,941
Officers, load the guns!

724
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:36,336
-Get ready for the operation!
<i>-My babies...</i>

725
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:39,090
Ready the helicopter, Khader!
We must conduct an encounter!

726
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,440
Helicopters and encounters
are too over the top for this!

727
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,268
The girl left ten minutes ago!

728
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:48,675
Oh! She left, huh?

729
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:51,452
-Yo, 'stache?
-Yes, sir?

730
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:53,364
-Get me a tea and chicken 'pakoda'!
-Okay, sir.

731
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:57,140
Speaking in a high pitch
has left me hot in the head!

732
00:41:58,179 --> 00:41:59,209
Ready, sir.

733
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:00,570
-Hey, 'stache!
-Sir?

734
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,735
-Buy a mirror for the station!
-Will do!

735
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:06,991
# Arrived, did the golden belle!
Gave a plenty, she did! #

736
00:42:07,632 --> 00:42:09,611
-Hello!
-Where's the bro now?

737
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:12,221
-Heading to an encounter!
-An encounter? What's up?

738
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:14,530
-Girlfriend's up!
-A girlfriend so soon?

739
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,243
-Who is that princess?
-I'll tell you. Where are you now?

740
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:19,962
I'm in depression, bro!

741
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:22,157
Why? Did they seize some of our stuff?

742
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:23,684
I miss you, bro!

743
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:27,230
Don't you get how much respect
I have for our friendship?

744
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,137
You give respect for our friendship!

745
00:42:29,217 --> 00:42:30,751
But I'll give up my life for it!

746
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:33,856
For so many years,
I awaited to give up my life for someone.

747
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:36,426
It took me 33 years to meet you!

748
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:39,360
I'll finish the encounter
and then give you my life!

749
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,817
I'm hanging up, now!

750
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:48,726
-He's a lot worse than we thought!
-Yes, sir.

751
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:50,180
-Nod your head again!
-Yes, sir!

752
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,111
A bunch of you stick around
just to nod like that!

753
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:57,170
Our babies don't even eat meat!

754
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,172
My goodness! Do they even sell dog meat?

755
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,351
To hell with them!

756
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:07,951
Come on, Raghavan!

757
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:09,404
Stand back before you let them loose!

758
00:43:09,484 --> 00:43:11,438
They'll bite!
No bones will be left behind!

759
00:43:11,518 --> 00:43:15,772
Pull that hard! Let them jump! Come on.

760
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:18,680
My babies...

761
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:21,291
My babies...

762
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:23,791
Come on.

763
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:25,856
My babies...

764
00:43:30,794 --> 00:43:32,095
Remo!

765
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,205
Thank you, sir. Thank you, so much!

766
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,343
On their way to the stove!
Barely escaped!

767
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:46,778
Thank you.

768
00:43:47,742 --> 00:43:48,931
Who is that?

769
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:52,285
He's the inspector!
He found our babies!

770
00:43:55,124 --> 00:43:58,837
Within four hours of filing a complaint,
he found them? So many dogs, even!

771
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:02,630
I've never seen the cops find something
so quickly, until now!

772
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,697
Granny! If we do it quick,
you ask us how so!

773
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,918
If we take our time,
you claim the cops are always late!

774
00:44:09,998 --> 00:44:12,047
What can a cop do?

775
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:15,345
Do you really like dogs a lot?

776
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:16,675
Do I like dogs?

777
00:44:17,418 --> 00:44:19,231
I grew up alongside dogs!

778
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,646
Dog is great!

779
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:24,950
Dogs are the only creatures in the world
who love unconditionally!

780
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:28,729
They like us people a lot more
than they do other dogs!

781
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:30,529
Or hell!

782
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:34,654
If you ask me, the best creatures
in the world are dogs! Not humans!

783
00:44:34,734 --> 00:44:35,750
Then what?

784
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,758
So, if there's any problem, call me.

785
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:41,013
Bye.

786
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:42,873
Been two days since I filed a complaint!

787
00:44:42,953 --> 00:44:44,836
You don't seem to have found anything.

788
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,024
Why are you so irresponsible, sir?

789
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:48,663
Who is Kaushik?

790
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:51,330
My daughter's friend.

791
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,912
They study together.

792
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:54,060
Where is he?

793
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,724
He lives near Adyar.

794
00:44:56,036 --> 00:45:00,016
His hostel is behind fourth street
near Madhya Kailash in Adyar.

795
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:03,626
He's also been missing from the same day
as your daughter!

796
00:45:04,154 --> 00:45:05,951
Do you get it?

797
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:08,674
He and your daughter have eloped!

798
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:12,549
My daughter is not that kind of girl, sir!

799
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:14,963
We get ten such complaints every day!

800
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,500
All parents who file them
say the same thing!

801
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,841
When your daughter's jewelry
and money run out

802
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:22,870
and he has had his fill,
they'll come back.

803
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:26,234
Don't order us around
or tell us how to do our job!

804
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:28,963
Don't spread word
that your daughter's missing!

805
00:45:29,043 --> 00:45:32,021
If we find out anything,
we'll let you know! Get going!

806
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:35,485
Needlessly nagging me
early in the morning!

807
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:37,979
-What a damn headache!
-Sir!

808
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:39,103
Sit down!

809
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:40,721
-Khader!
-Sir!

810
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:42,742
I'm a little bummed!
Start the vehicle!

811
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:44,123
-Let's chill out!
-Okay, sir.

812
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,696
<i>[vehicle approaching]</i>

813
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:57,260
Khader!

814
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,030
What's going on there?

815
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,425
So damn close!

816
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:03,319
What the hell is going on there?
Who is he?

817
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:06,253
He touches my music while talking to her!
Why I ought to...

818
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,545
What are you doing, sir?

819
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,129
Why pull out a gun?
That too, in the middle of the road?

820
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:13,419
Khader, she's my music, Khader! My music!

821
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:15,154
No one else gets a chance!

822
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,622
She is just for me!

823
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:18,878
What's this side of you, sir? Seems new!

824
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,240
I am like that, Khader!

825
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,355
-Why I ought to...
-Hey, sir...

826
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:26,435
Sir, don't do it!
Think it's some kind of special event.

827
00:46:26,515 --> 00:46:30,897
Judging by the guy's attire,
think it's the girl's engagement.

828
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:33,225
Engagement?
Whose permission did she take?

829
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:38,058
She's a good girl. The guy seems nice.
They make a handsome couple.

830
00:46:38,138 --> 00:46:40,425
Really?
They make a handsome couple, huh?

831
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:42,683
He looks like a damn porn star!

832
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,988
Come!
I'll match them up! Come along!

833
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:48,944
Sir! Hold on, sir!

834
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:51,933
What is this?

835
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:55,274
Hey, who is he?
Who is this guy, Sindhu?

836
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:56,961
Why's he feeding you ice cream?

837
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,697
He doesn't suit you at all!

838
00:46:58,777 --> 00:46:59,858
What's wrong, dear boy?

839
00:46:59,938 --> 00:47:01,456
Who is this guy, Aunty?

840
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:04,448
He's hitting on her! Who is he?

841
00:47:04,528 --> 00:47:06,160
Dear boy!

842
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,980
Granny! Who is he?

843
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,037
This guy? For Sindhu?

844
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:12,371
They won't suit each other at all!

845
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,327
Khader, who is he?
They won't suit each other, right?

846
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:17,585
-It won't, right?
-No, sir.

847
00:47:17,665 --> 00:47:18,807
That's what I'm saying!

848
00:47:19,434 --> 00:47:20,719
Who the hell are you?

849
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:23,175
This girl won't suit you at all!

850
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:24,329
Who are you?

851
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:25,766
-Who is he?
-My cousin!

852
00:47:26,575 --> 00:47:27,869
-Your cousin?
-Yes.

853

The honesty in your money
isn't there in mine!

They're both money! That's all!

to every injustice in this nation?

1027

Right here! This man!

1028

It is he!

1029
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,458
It's the man in this photograph!

It isn't wrong!

How much more, sir?
When will your thirst for money end?

I don't know, Khader!
I don't know!

It will come, sir! It will!

00:58:50,341 --> 00:58:51,836
It will swallow you whole!

1053
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:54,973
If it comes,
it won't just come for me!

1054
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,852
If it does, it'll kill me, you, Kalirajan,
the old man, his grandchild

1055

good people and bad people!
It'll devour them all!

about who is good and who is bad!

Tsunami, he says!

1058

I'm still here, right? Call your tsunami!

Your father cannot arrange
that much money, dear.

1073

Why must we wait
for them to expel you?

1074
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:06,841
You just stop going to college.

Once I raise that much money next year,

Sorry, bro. Sorry.

1194
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:59,853
I told you this was an accident!
Why were you on the bike?

1195
01:05:59,933 --> 01:06:01,601
Despite all I said,
how dare you touch her?

1196
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:03,929
Sorry. Sorry. Apologize, man!

1197
01:06:05,258 --> 01:06:06,678
Sorry, my foot!

1198
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:10,118
Sorry. I said I am sorry!
I'm really sorry, sis!

1199
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:13,050
Come to the guest house
in the evening. We'll talk then!

1200
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:18,163
She must be here somewhere!
Quickly find her! Come along!

What's this blood on your hand?

1203
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,329
-I'm alright!
-Let's go to the hospital!

1204
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:30,176
-I'm fine!
-Listen to me! Let's go!

You'll be fine!
The doctor's over there!

-I'm fine!
-Come!

1208
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:40,166
-Doctor. Doctor.
-The scan report of that patient.

1209
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,872
Her hand is hurt, doctor!
She's bleeding! Have a look!

1210
01:06:43,952 --> 01:06:45,347
-Relax!
-Look at this!

1211
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,890
On her forehead!

1212
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,580
It's nothing! Just a small wound!

1213
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,378
<i>Nothing?</i> She's bleeding, doctor!

1214
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,412
Do something! X-rays or scans...

We'll take care. You wait there.

1216
01:06:55,246 --> 01:06:56,790
-Doctor! You come along.
-Go on!

1217
01:06:57,287 --> 01:06:59,822
-It's nothing, Sindhu!
-He's acting like a newlywed!

1218
01:07:04,005 --> 01:07:05,537
It's nothing, Sindhu!

1219
01:07:10,132 --> 01:07:12,507
Sindhu! Everything fine?

1220
01:07:12,912 --> 01:07:14,229
It was nothing, right?

1221
01:07:14,881 --> 01:07:16,596
Have some rest here, Sindhu!

1222
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,269
We can leave later!

1223
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:21,624
Nothing happened, right?

1224
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,985
What if it had?

1225
01:07:23,466 --> 01:07:26,619
For one second,
I thought I'd never see my family, you,

01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:29,124
my house, or my pets again!

1227
01:07:29,204 --> 01:07:30,478
That's it!

1228
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:32,429
I thought my life was over!

1229
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:34,816
The sound of bullets
keep ringing in my ears!

1230
01:07:35,745 --> 01:07:38,048
Forget about it!
Nothing happened, right?

1231
01:07:38,128 --> 01:07:39,291
Nothing happened to me.

1232
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:42,165
But they thought I was another girl
and tried to kill me!

1233
01:07:42,245 --> 01:07:44,906
If they find the girl they sought,
will they kill her?

1234
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,247
She'd have a family, too!

1235
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:51,240
She'd also have bid her mother goodbye
as she stepped out, right?

1236
01:07:51,892 --> 01:07:54,582
In a little while,
they're about to kill a life!

1237
01:07:54,662 --> 01:07:56,291
Knowing it, how can I let it happen?

1238
01:07:56,371 --> 01:07:59,266
All lives are equal.
They only take different forms.

1239
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:01,832
I know you really like me.

1240
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:04,111
I'll tell you right now. I feel the same!

1241
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:07,041
You were scared for my wellbeing, right?

1242
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:08,272
If that's true...

1243
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:10,826
I don't know a damn thing about that girl!

1244
01:08:10,906 --> 01:08:12,532
But she mustn't die!

1245
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:14,886
You asked me what I wanted as a gift,
right?

1246
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,338
I want that girl.

1247
01:08:16,745 --> 01:08:19,975
That girl
will be my birthday gift from you!

1248
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:38,392
Catch her!

Somehow, you guys got the right girl!

What are you doing here, bro?

1255
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,249
I told you to come
to the guest house at dusk!

1256
01:10:11,329 --> 01:10:12,374
Let go of the girl.

1257
01:10:12,454 --> 01:10:13,791
Why must I do that?

1258
01:10:13,871 --> 01:10:15,791
Let her go, brother!

1259
01:10:15,871 --> 01:10:17,621
Why must I do that?

1260
01:10:17,701 --> 01:10:20,663
Is she your girlfriend, too?
How many do you have?

1261
01:10:20,743 --> 01:10:23,324
If anything happens to her,
my love life will be at risk, bro!

1262
01:10:23,404 --> 01:10:25,916
Least it's just your love life
that is at risk!

1263
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:28,414
If she remains alive,
my whole life is at risk!

1264
01:10:28,494 --> 01:10:31,366
-Try to understand! Send her over!
-Can't oblige a brother, huh?

1265
01:10:31,446 --> 01:10:32,943
Brother says he wants her, yes?

1266
01:10:33,023 --> 01:10:34,520
No need! Let it go!

1267
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,797
I said I want her!

1268
01:10:35,877 --> 01:10:37,445
When I tell you to let it go, do it!

1269
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:43,749
He won't listen to reason.

1270
01:10:43,829 --> 01:10:45,163
You go and get the girl!

01:10:46,328 --> 01:10:49,846
Let my brothers know!
Have them come to the fishing wharf now!

What new angle is this, Karna?

1273
01:11:24,537 --> 01:11:26,562
I told you to let the girl go!

1274
01:11:26,642 --> 01:11:29,189
To protect her, you'll even hit our boys?

1275
01:11:29,269 --> 01:11:31,421

'East or West, friendship is the best!'

'It means that I, Karna,
am your blood brother. I love you.'

Threatened the young lad, huh?

You're not taking his calls, eh?

1376
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,792
Not replying to his texts either,

-Know what he told me?

The young lad feels bad!
I'm here to call a truce!

01:18:20,858 --> 01:18:22,288
-Young lad?
-Yes!

What must I do now?

Tell him to hug me, sir!
Else I won't talk!

Just hug him, man!

1399

Yes! Go there!

01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:34,418
Go! Get over there!

Don't sniff me! I hate it!

1402
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,963
You asked me to hug him
and he bit me, sir!

His teeth may've accidentally grazed you.

Where is that girl?

For whom did I come here
from another city?

For you!

Tell me where the girl is!

Before you,
I've never addressed anyone as <i>brother</i>.

1417
01:19:13,233 --> 01:19:15,081
You pick a fight with your own brother?

1418
01:19:15,433 --> 01:19:17,362
Who started it? You or me?

1419
01:19:17,442 --> 01:19:18,569
You must've started it!

Who? Him? He's a tot?

1422
01:19:22,088 --> 01:19:24,733
He told me that he'd give his life
for our friendship!

Didn't I give it?

1424
01:19:26,564 --> 01:19:28,979
Didn't I shoot at the sky?
Did I shoot at your heart?

1425

What does that mean?

01:19:30,316 --> 01:19:31,841
Tell me what it means, sir!

Your bald head won't understand

Stop confusing!

01:19:37,795 --> 01:19:39,551
Tell me where that girl is!

1431
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:42,671
Why look at me like that?

1432
01:19:42,751 --> 01:19:43,962
Why glare like that?

1433
01:19:44,042 --> 01:19:45,731
Are only the five of you brothers?

1434
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:46,814
Am I not one, too?

1435
01:19:46,894 --> 01:19:48,002
Look how he confuses them!

1436
01:19:48,082 --> 01:19:50,812
-What'll you drink?
-What am I saying? And what is he asking?

1437
01:19:50,892 --> 01:19:52,694
I asked what you'll drink, old man!

1438
01:19:52,774 --> 01:19:54,528
You dare call me 'old man'?

1439
01:19:54,608 --> 01:19:56,814
Why? Can I not say so?

1440
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,778
Can't brothers talk to each other
that way?

1441
01:19:59,196 --> 01:20:00,665
Aren't you my brother?

1442
01:20:00,745 --> 01:20:02,695
Oh! Must I refer to my brother
only as 'sir'?

1443
01:20:02,775 --> 01:20:04,570
Why has he turned so, sir?

1444
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:05,997
Why does he show so much ego?

1445
01:20:06,077 --> 01:20:07,705
Why is he getting angry?

-Yes!

We can booze later!
Ask him where the girl is!

We'll discuss that later!
First, let's booze! Sit!

after saying your punch lines!

-Oh! Her name is Sandhya, huh?
-You don't even know her name?

I don't!

so I obliged!

Who does your girlfriend think she is?

you'd give it to her?

What do I look like to you?
What do I look?

1462
01:20:49,483 --> 01:20:53,224
Did I see her because I came to meet you?
Or did I come to this city just for her?

1463
01:20:54,122 --> 01:20:55,637
Are you and her the same?

what happens to Sandhya?

If I'm important, give me Sandhya!

1468
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,817
Despite a truce, he asks for the girl!

01:24:08,483 --> 01:24:10,440
No, sir! Don't do a wrong deed!

1533
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,733
This is a betrayal!
Don't deceive that girl!

1534
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:15,247
Don't preach to me, Khader!
Just do as I say!

1535
01:24:17,369 --> 01:24:18,845
Is the fear gone?

1536
01:24:18,925 --> 01:24:20,866
You've been crying
since you got here.

1537
01:24:21,094 --> 01:24:23,536
But you won't say what happened.
What was it?

1538
01:24:23,616 --> 01:24:24,996
Why are they after you?

1539
01:24:25,816 --> 01:24:28,500
If you believe I can solve your problem

1540
01:24:28,691 --> 01:24:30,111
tell me all about it.

1541
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:31,191
Tell me!

1542
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:33,211
I work in New York.

1543
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:36,102
My mother and sister live here.

1544
01:24:37,223 --> 01:24:39,281
I came to India to meet them.

1545
01:24:39,361 --> 01:24:42,147
My sister's semester holidays
was just a week away!

1546
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:45,403
So, they both planned to come along
with me, next week!

1547
01:24:45,483 --> 01:24:47,971
My sister said she'd come to the airport
to pick me up.

1548
01:24:48,884 --> 01:24:51,486
But she didn't.
We didn't know what happened.

1549
01:24:51,566 --> 01:24:53,486
My mother and I searched all over for her.

1550
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:55,611
But we couldn't find out where she was.

1551
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:57,380
That's when I got a call!

1552
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,108
I don't know if I'll be alive
when you find me!

1553
01:25:00,188 --> 01:25:02,307
What are you saying, Bhavani?
Where are you?

1554
01:25:02,387 --> 01:25:03,399
I don't know, sis!

1555
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:05,109
I was coming to pick you up
at the airport.

1556
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:07,684
<i>Kalirajan's brothers abducted me!</i>

1557
01:25:07,764 --> 01:25:09,441
They're talking about killing me today!

1558
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,776
They're going to kill you?
Nothing will happen to you, Bhavani!

1559
01:25:12,856 --> 01:25:14,587
I can't take it anymore, sis!

1560
01:25:15,024 --> 01:25:17,410
For all their torture,
I'll be better off dead!

1561
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:19,069
Nothing will happen to you!

1562
01:25:19,149 --> 01:25:21,550
They've maimed my entire body, sis!

1563
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:22,944
Bhavani!

1564
01:25:23,024 --> 01:25:26,345
A girl in my position, before she dies,

1565
01:25:26,425 --> 01:25:29,694
would pray
no other girl faces this horror!

1566
01:25:29,774 --> 01:25:31,494
Let it end with me!

1567
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:36,022
Those four mongrels must not live!

1568
01:25:36,102 --> 01:25:37,884
They must be hanged!

1569
01:25:38,519 --> 01:25:42,377
They record everything on camera
and watch it over and over again!

1570
01:25:42,734 --> 01:25:44,692
The phone I'm using now, is theirs!

1571
01:25:48,983 --> 01:25:51,392
I've tossed that camera
under a cupboard!

1572
01:25:51,732 --> 01:25:53,283
They've come, sis!

1573
01:25:53,363 --> 01:25:54,740
Take care of mom!

1574
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,888
Don't spare them!

1575
01:25:55,968 --> 01:25:58,566
-Bhavani! Bhavani!
-Get up, guys!

1576
01:25:58,646 --> 01:26:00,168
Everything's ready! Lift her up!

1577
01:26:00,248 --> 01:26:03,293
<i>Then, I went to the location
that my sister sent on the phone.</i>

1578
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,667
<i>[chains clanking]</i>

1579
01:26:14,321 --> 01:26:15,660
Bhavani!

1580
01:26:29,449 --> 01:26:31,926
They killed my sister, sir!

1581
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:38,762
Kalirajan's brothers raped
and murdered my sister, sir!

1582
01:26:40,579 --> 01:26:44,083
Trusting him as a media person,
I told a guy about the camera.

1583
01:26:44,276 --> 01:26:46,536
Turns out he was Kalirajan's stooge, too!

1584
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:48,138
He deceived me!

1585
01:26:48,387 --> 01:26:50,094
I didn't know who to trust!

1586
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,918
I was so scared.
That was when you saved me!

1587
01:26:58,195 --> 01:27:00,953
-Does your mother have an American visa?
-Yes.

1588
01:27:01,033 --> 01:27:04,113
Give me the camera
and the two of you go to America!

1589
01:27:05,478 --> 01:27:07,754
Do you have faith in me?

1590
01:27:08,907 --> 01:27:10,203
Do you trust me?

1591
01:27:10,774 --> 01:27:12,610
You're the only one I trust!

1592
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:14,636
Alright. Let's go home.

1593
01:27:18,086 --> 01:27:19,106
<i>[vehicle approaching]
[approaching sirens wailing]</i>

1594
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:31,161
Sir, my mother doesn't know any of this.

1595
01:27:31,241 --> 01:27:33,648
She told the cops
that Bhavani's run away.

1596
01:27:33,728 --> 01:27:34,920
She believes that.

1597
01:27:35,796 --> 01:27:38,948
I convinced her that my sister
would return home soon.

1598
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:40,974
Come along.

1599
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:57,280
'My daughter's been missing for two days,
sir.'

1600
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,878
-'Two days, huh?
-Yes.'

1601
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:02,129
-'Which area?
-Kumaran Colony. Third Avenue.'

1602
01:28:02,846 --> 01:28:05,370
Did you get any information
about her, sir?

1603
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,200
Has Bhavani been found?

1604
01:28:07,626 --> 01:28:09,328
Sandhya, take your mother inside.

1605
01:28:09,408 --> 01:28:12,403
Come, mom.
Got an urgent call from the office!

1606
01:28:12,483 --> 01:28:14,539
-We must go to America right away!
-What?

1607
01:28:14,619 --> 01:28:16,450
-We'll be back in fifteen days.
-Right away?

1608
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:19,653
Did you get it?

1609
01:28:19,733 --> 01:28:22,380
Book two business class tickets
to America right now!

1610
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:24,501
I'm sending them both to America!

1611
01:28:24,581 --> 01:28:26,578
Tickets to America?

1612
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:28,486
What about the camera?

1613
01:28:28,566 --> 01:28:29,986
Book the tickets, first!

1614
01:28:30,066 --> 01:28:32,348
You'll get the camera!
<i>[phone keypad]</i>

1615
01:28:39,051 --> 01:28:40,897
Why are you looking at me like that?

1616
01:28:41,704 --> 01:28:43,750
Why throw me such a nasty look?

1617
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:47,270
Yes! I'm sending them to America
for their safety!

1618
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,339
I'll give up the camera to Kalirajan!

1619
01:28:49,419 --> 01:28:50,845
And I'll get paid for it!

1620
01:28:51,645 --> 01:28:53,079
That is what will happen!

1621
01:28:53,714 --> 01:28:56,294
There is no better solution
to this problem!

1622
01:29:00,715 --> 01:29:01,771
Look!

1623
01:29:01,944 --> 01:29:03,046
Don't look at me like that!

1624
01:29:03,266 --> 01:29:04,983
Don't look at me like that, I say!

1625
01:29:05,063 --> 01:29:07,411
Can't you hear me?
Don't look at me like that!

1626
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:09,380
Get going! Get going!

1627
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:11,995
Go to the station!
Get out of my sight! Go!

1628
01:29:12,763 --> 01:29:15,946
You will pay for this sin, sir.

1629

<i>[vehicle approaching]</i>

1630
01:29:30,077 --> 01:29:32,986
No problem at all, Sindhu.
I'll take care of everything.

1631
01:29:33,066 --> 01:29:35,723
Sandhya and her mom
are ready to go to the US.

1632
01:29:35,919 --> 01:29:37,284
Yes. Okay.

1633
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:38,888
Pass the phone to Sandhya.

1634
01:29:38,968 --> 01:29:40,948
Sandhya! Sindhu!

1635
01:29:41,028 --> 01:29:42,049
Hello!

1636
01:29:42,129 --> 01:29:43,275
Hi, Sandhya!

1637
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:46,330
Call me as soon as you land, okay?

1638
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:47,459
Thank you.

1639
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:50,330
And don't worry,
he will take care of everything.

1640
01:29:54,666 --> 01:29:56,700
-What?
-Did you get the camera?

1641
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:57,962
Not yet!

1642
01:29:58,042 --> 01:29:59,950
Quickly get it
and come to the guest house!

1643
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,289
Fine! Have the money ready!

1644
01:30:02,369 --> 01:30:04,277
Always on and on about money!

1645
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:10,012
-Sandhya!
-Yes.

1646
01:30:10,354 --> 01:30:12,472
Call me after you land in New York.

1647
01:30:13,511 --> 01:30:14,624
And then...

1648
01:30:14,704 --> 01:30:16,719
-You said you'd give me a camera.
-Yes.

1649
01:30:30,178 --> 01:30:31,209
Dear!

1650
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,078
My daughter will surely be back!

1651
01:30:34,488 --> 01:30:36,634
When that happens

1652
01:30:36,714 --> 01:30:39,672
please tell her
that I'm not angry with her.

1653
01:30:40,341 --> 01:30:42,801
Alright, ma'am.
It's time. Get going.

1654
01:30:45,635 --> 01:30:46,684
Come along.

01:31:33,023 --> 01:31:36,248
Brother!

Fourteen days!

1657
01:31:51,161 --> 01:31:52,216
For fourteen days,

1658
01:31:52,296 --> 01:31:54,879
they assaulted my sister
and then killed her!

1659
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:58,589
This isn't just rape and murder!

1660
01:31:59,317 --> 01:32:02,037
They burned her with acid!

1661
01:32:04,112 --> 01:32:05,241
In Gandhi's nation,

1662
01:32:05,321 --> 01:32:08,482
does a woman deserve this fate
on Gandhi Jayanthi Day?

1663
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:22,406
You'll understand when you watch it!

1664
01:32:22,486 --> 01:32:24,581
They've desecrated a young woman!

1665
01:32:24,661 --> 01:32:27,331
None of them must be spared!

1666
01:32:27,411 --> 01:32:29,951
They must be punished by law!

1667
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:31,781
They must be hanged!

1668
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:34,428
The entire nation must see it!

1669
01:32:34,574 --> 01:32:37,427
One must be afraid of getting hanged

1670
01:32:37,507 --> 01:32:40,842
if he even thinks about defiling a woman!

1671
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:46,984
Who gave these mongrels the freedom
to joyfully roam about the streets?

1672
01:32:53,927 --> 01:32:59,042
Every girl will then believe this atrocity
will never befall any other woman!

1673
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,159
That's what my sister said
before she died!

1674
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:03,760
Let this end with her!

1675
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,809
My heart thunders
that I can get justice only through you!

1676
01:33:07,889 --> 01:33:10,197
Don't spare anyone, brother!

1677
01:33:10,489 --> 01:33:13,218
When that happens, I'll come back!

1678

But the camera is here!

Your friend Kalirajan is calling!
Talk to him!

-Nothing happened!
-Nothing happened?

1695
01:34:53,292 --> 01:34:57,848
If that were true, instead of going there,
why did you drive back here?

1696
01:34:58,466 --> 01:35:02,296
If nothing happened, why is the camera
here, instead of with him?

1697
01:35:02,588 --> 01:35:05,838
If nothing happened,
why didn't you take his call?

Something's not right, sir!

1699
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,159
I suspect something's amiss!

01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:11,807
You're not the same man
that I've seen so far!

1701
01:35:12,127 --> 01:35:13,671
You've changed!

I am the eye witness.

2217
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:53,738
<i>Eye witness?</i>

2218
02:11:54,584 --> 02:11:57,549
So you're the eye witness
to the rape and murder of Bhavani

2219
02:11:57,629 --> 02:11:58,868
by these four people?

2220
02:11:58,948 --> 02:12:00,827
Not four people, Your Honor!

2221
02:12:00,907 --> 02:12:03,618
It wasn't four people
who defiled and killed Bhavani!

2222
02:12:03,698 --> 02:12:05,049
It was five people!

2223
02:12:05,129 --> 02:12:06,546
Five people, Your Honor!

2224
02:12:10,571 --> 02:12:13,410
The fifth person is none other than me!

2225
02:12:21,208 --> 02:12:23,368
The five of us abducted
that girl together!

2226
02:12:23,448 --> 02:12:24,615
-You idiot!
-He's lying!

2227
02:12:24,695 --> 02:12:27,687
The five of us sexually assaulted
that girl together!

2228
02:12:27,767 --> 02:12:29,579
He's blabbering, sir!

2229
02:12:29,659 --> 02:12:32,464
We punctured her entire body with needles!

2230
02:12:32,742 --> 02:12:35,227
Not just for one or two days, Your Honor.

2231
02:12:35,307 --> 02:12:36,852
For fourteen days!

2232
02:12:36,932 --> 02:12:40,073
For fourteen days,
we put that girl through hell!

2233
02:12:41,263 --> 02:12:42,691
She fought us!

2234
02:12:42,954 --> 02:12:43,990
To no avail!

2235
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:45,240
She pleaded with us!

2236
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:46,696
We didn't spare her!

2237
02:12:47,312 --> 02:12:49,448
She even beseeched us with folded hands!

2238
02:12:49,749 --> 02:12:51,283
<i>Let me go! I can't take it anymore!</i>

2239
02:12:51,363 --> 02:12:53,443
<i>Just kill me,</i> she cried to us!

2240
02:12:55,662 --> 02:12:57,285
But we didn't spare her.

2241
02:12:57,365 --> 02:12:58,926
We're sadists, right?

2242
02:12:59,006 --> 02:13:02,660
The more she begged,
the more aggressive we got!

2243
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:04,036
We began to torture her even more!

2244
02:13:04,116 --> 02:13:05,493
Hey, Psychopath.

2245
02:13:05,573 --> 02:13:06,865
Psychopaths, right?

2246
02:13:06,945 --> 02:13:08,443
-Am I right?
-All lies!

2247
02:13:08,523 --> 02:13:09,877
He's lying, Your Honor!

2248
02:13:11,648 --> 02:13:13,452
If you're one of them

2249
02:13:13,949 --> 02:13:15,964
-why file a lawsuit?
-For the money!

2250
02:13:16,438 --> 02:13:18,868
I asked for money, sir!
They didn't give me!

2251
02:13:18,948 --> 02:13:20,206
We got into a dispute!

2252
02:13:20,286 --> 02:13:22,716
I blackmailed them
about having evidence in the camera!

2253
02:13:23,064 --> 02:13:24,115
I lied!

2254
02:13:24,493 --> 02:13:25,644
They still didn't budge!

2255
02:13:25,724 --> 02:13:27,869
After I filed a suit,
they ran away in fear!

2256
02:13:28,637 --> 02:13:31,229
Yesterday, when you all found
that the camera had nothing

2257
02:13:31,309 --> 02:13:33,454
I lied about having more evidence!

2258
02:13:34,671 --> 02:13:35,871
I didn't take their money!

2259
02:13:36,338 --> 02:13:38,684
So they tried to kill me last night, sir!

2260
02:13:39,403 --> 02:13:41,043
They smashed me up!

2261
02:13:41,926 --> 02:13:43,427
I was bleeding all over!

2262
02:13:44,197 --> 02:13:46,721
My life was slipping away!
I couldn't bear the pain!

2263
02:13:46,904 --> 02:13:48,471
I felt I was going to die!

2264
02:13:48,551 --> 02:13:49,572
It was then

2265
02:13:49,652 --> 02:13:51,032
at that moment

2266
02:13:51,345 --> 02:13:54,055
I understood the torture
that girl must have gone through!

2267
02:13:56,563 --> 02:13:58,240
What brutality!

2268
02:13:58,320 --> 02:13:59,868
It was hell, sir!

2269
02:13:59,948 --> 02:14:02,430
I felt death would be better!

2270
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:03,867
It was then...

2271
02:14:03,947 --> 02:14:05,532
To so many people...

2272
02:14:05,612 --> 02:14:07,373
To this holy haven of a court...

2273
02:14:07,453 --> 02:14:08,689
To Gods like you...

2274
02:14:08,769 --> 02:14:12,858
I realized that I live to tell you
all of the brutality Bhavani went through.

2275
02:14:12,938 --> 02:14:15,334
They even tried to buy me out just now!

2276
02:14:15,895 --> 02:14:17,531
I don't want money!

2277
02:14:17,611 --> 02:14:19,875
I've done enough
for the sake of the money!

2278
02:14:20,769 --> 02:14:23,239
Every moment,
I keep hearing that girl's screams!

2279
02:14:26,579 --> 02:14:29,430
We gave a brutal death to Bhavani.

2280
02:14:29,667 --> 02:14:31,135
Do not spare us, sir!

2281
02:14:31,456 --> 02:14:32,618
Objection, Your Honor.

2282
02:14:32,698 --> 02:14:34,503
So he'll file a lawsuit himself

2283
02:14:34,923 --> 02:14:36,407
and then claim he's guilty, too!

2284
02:14:36,693 --> 02:14:38,253
How do we believe any of this?

2285
02:14:38,413 --> 02:14:41,632
Actually, the one meant to be abducted
that day, wasn't Bhavani.

2286
02:14:42,021 --> 02:14:44,063
It was your granddaughter, Chitra!

2287
02:14:47,684 --> 02:14:49,464
What are you saying?

2288
02:14:50,314 --> 02:14:52,483
What is it, sir? Don't believe me?

2289
02:14:52,563 --> 02:14:53,785
Chitra, sir!

2290
02:14:53,865 --> 02:14:56,316
She's studying
Visual Communications at MCC College.

2291
02:14:56,396 --> 02:14:58,563
Her house is in Thoraipakkam, too!

2292
02:14:59,342 --> 02:15:03,203
We had arranged a spot
to abduct your granddaughter Chitra!

2293
02:15:03,283 --> 02:15:06,900
On the day of the abduction,
Chitra did not turn up!

2294
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:08,857
We chanced to see Bhavani!

2295
02:15:09,117 --> 02:15:12,358
Your granddaughter got lucky!
Bhavani did not!

2296
02:15:12,438 --> 02:15:14,871
I didn't want to abduct her!
Sabari didn't agree!

2297
02:15:14,951 --> 02:15:16,770
-It wasn't me, sir!
-Silence!

2298
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:21,567
<i>It's alright! What does it matter
if it's Bhavani or Chitra?</i>

2299
02:15:21,647 --> 02:15:23,160
<i>Just any girl, right?</i> He asked!

2300
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:26,044
Sabari said that we'd get Chitra later!

2301
02:15:26,124 --> 02:15:27,974
He's lying!

2302
02:15:28,054 --> 02:15:29,326
Order!

2303
02:15:29,765 --> 02:15:32,482
Sir, I think...
It may have been a Thursday or a Friday...

2304
02:15:32,562 --> 02:15:33,824
We went there again.

2305
02:15:33,904 --> 02:15:35,049
For Chitra!

2306
02:15:35,129 --> 02:15:36,597
But Chitra didn't turn up!

2307
02:15:37,095 --> 02:15:38,698
Think she went to Coimbatore.

2308
02:15:38,778 --> 02:15:41,141
Isn't your brother's house over there?

2309
02:15:43,573 --> 02:15:45,865
Do you feel no fear
for committing such a big crime?

2310
02:15:45,945 --> 02:15:47,514
Why must I be afraid, ma'am?

2311
02:15:47,736 --> 02:15:49,567
What can you people do to us?

2312
02:15:49,647 --> 02:15:51,892
If not this court, there's another court!

2313
02:15:51,972 --> 02:15:55,535
Hundreds of sections in the penal code
and as many loopholes for us to escape!

2314
02:15:55,718 --> 02:15:57,052
First, we'd be out on bail.

2315
02:15:57,132 --> 02:15:59,155
Then, we'd destroy the evidence.

2316
02:15:59,235 --> 02:16:00,958
Next, the case would be dismissed.

2317
02:16:01,184 --> 02:16:02,295
That's all!

2318
02:16:02,375 --> 02:16:07,824
After that, there's another Bhavani,
Nirbhaya, Jyothi, Geetha, Madhura...

2319
02:16:07,904 --> 02:16:09,797
It'll just go on and on!

2320
02:16:12,196 --> 02:16:13,664
We have the guts to abduct

2321
02:16:13,744 --> 02:16:16,072
and rape a girl
in the very moment we see her!

2322
02:16:16,152 --> 02:16:17,926
If that is a crime

2323
02:16:18,516 --> 02:16:22,609
can you sentence us right now?
At this very moment?

2324
02:16:23,841 --> 02:16:26,572
Can you? Can your law

2325
02:16:26,652 --> 02:16:30,488
hang us to death within a day or two?

2326
02:16:30,568 --> 02:16:32,137
Can it be done?

2327
02:16:33,781 --> 02:16:35,478
It can't be done, sir!

2328
02:16:35,558 --> 02:16:37,910
You'd claim
this has never happened in India!

2329
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:39,954
You'd say the law doesn't permit it!

2330
02:16:40,034 --> 02:16:42,415
You'd say a hanging
can't happen within two days!

2331
02:16:42,495 --> 02:16:44,369
Never mind all that, sir!

2332
02:16:44,723 --> 02:16:49,339
You ask me so many questions,
even after I admitted my complicity!

2333
02:16:49,578 --> 02:16:50,657
This is why!

2334
02:16:50,737 --> 02:16:52,072
This is why, sir!

2335
02:16:52,325 --> 02:16:55,202
This is why people like me
really love this country!

2336
02:16:55,282 --> 02:16:58,035
Tell me which other nation
offers this kind of freedom?

2337
02:16:58,115 --> 02:17:01,056
My India is great!
I am proud to be an Indian!

2338
02:17:02,355 --> 02:17:07,855
We have the guts to admit our crime
before so many people and so many judges!

2339
02:17:07,935 --> 02:17:12,396
In the same vein, do you have the guts
to have us hanged to death, tomorrow?

2340
02:17:22,408 --> 02:17:23,708
I'll kill you!

2341
02:17:23,788 --> 02:17:25,355
-Control them!
-You're dead meat!

2342
02:17:25,435 --> 02:17:27,309
Control them! Get back, you four! Order!

2343
02:17:27,389 --> 02:17:28,663
-Stand back!
-I won't spare you!

2344
02:17:28,743 --> 02:17:31,209
-Order! Order!
-Catch them.

2345
02:17:55,919 --> 02:18:00,671
The confession statement of Mr. Karnan,
who has committed the crime

2346
02:18:00,751 --> 02:18:04,969
has proven without any doubt,
the brutality meted out to Bhavani.

2347
02:18:06,193 --> 02:18:10,664
The Indian ethos
and India's constitution considers

2348
02:18:10,744 --> 02:18:13,577
the progress of women,
to signify the progress of the nation.

2349
02:18:13,657 --> 02:18:15,930
In a country that believes in said notion

2350
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:19,535
such incidents of gang rape

2351
02:18:19,615 --> 02:18:22,827
shakes up the conscience of the society.

2352
02:18:22,907 --> 02:18:28,577
Such inhumane people who pose a threat
to the safety and the freedom of women

2353
02:18:28,657 --> 02:18:31,753
.are not fit to live in this society!

2354
02:18:31,833 --> 02:18:32,998
Therefore.

2355
02:18:33,078 --> 02:18:34,844
Inspector Karnan

2356
02:18:35,011 --> 02:18:37,144
and the four other criminals

2357
02:18:37,224 --> 02:18:42,873
This court orders they be hanged to death
within the next twenty four hours!

2358
02:18:46,430 --> 02:18:48,867
Oh, God! Damn!

2359
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:59,282
<i>What will happen if you kill him?</i>

2360
02:18:59,362 --> 02:19:00,870
<i>They'll hang you to death!</i>

2361
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:02,548
<i>Go and die!</i>

2362
02:19:02,628 --> 02:19:05,511
<i>The high justice you believe in
will live on, won't it?</i>

2363
02:19:05,591 --> 02:19:08,231
<i>Either be on this side,
or be on that side!</i>

2364
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:17,785
Justice for Bhavani! Justice for Bhavani!

2365
02:19:20,576 --> 02:19:22,189
Why did you do this?

2366
02:19:22,704 --> 02:19:24,547
Why did you take the blame?

2367
02:19:24,627 --> 02:19:26,515
How can I live without you?

2368
02:19:26,595 --> 02:19:29,550
They mustn't easily escape
after ruining a girl, right?

2369
02:19:30,039 --> 02:19:32,508
From now, when a guy even thinks about
defiling a girl

2370
02:19:32,588 --> 02:19:34,939
he'd fear an immediate death sentence,
right?

2371
02:19:36,483 --> 02:19:39,837
They should be killed.

2372
02:19:40,715 --> 02:19:45,037
You sinner! You ruined that poor girl!
Think you'll have it easy in life?

2373
02:19:47,179 --> 02:19:48,949
You call yourself a policeman?

2374
02:19:49,029 --> 02:19:51,395
All of you ruined that poor girl!

2375
02:19:51,781 --> 02:19:53,982
-Weren't you born to a woman, too?
-Unhand him, ma'am!

2376
02:19:54,062 --> 02:19:57,680
-Kill him right here and now!
-You're mistaken, ma'am!

2377
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:59,411
Why? Why the hell, man?

2378
02:19:59,491 --> 02:20:01,323
You can't let women live in peace!

2379
02:20:01,403 --> 02:20:03,553
-Why do all this? Die and go to hell!
-Stop it, ma'am!

2380
02:20:03,633 --> 02:20:06,240
-Let go of him, ma'am!
-Why the hell were you born? Go die!

2381
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:08,223
-Die!
-Come along, ma'am!

2382
02:20:08,303 --> 02:20:10,989
You are not nice person.

2383
02:20:11,069 --> 02:20:12,111
Hey, leave me.

2384
02:20:12,191 --> 02:20:15,289
I swear to you, that you will be damned!

Please, sir!

<i>to the Bhavani rape and murder case</i>

2395
02:20:48,153 --> 02:20:52,515
<i>the High Court decreed that the guilty
be hanged to death within a day!</i>

2396
02:20:58,866 --> 02:21:01,365
In all these years,
I've seen many criminals.

2397
02:21:01,445 --> 02:21:03,808
You neither raped that girl
nor did you kill her.

2398
02:21:03,888 --> 02:21:05,922
Then why do this? For what reason?

2399
02:21:06,409 --> 02:21:08,338
It's really easy to beat them to death.

2400
02:21:08,552 --> 02:21:10,321
But it would end with them.

2401
02:21:10,703 --> 02:21:14,238
For the torture inflicted on that girl,
they must be sentenced to death!

2402
02:21:14,318 --> 02:21:16,050
If I must die for that to happen

2403
02:21:16,692 --> 02:21:17,838
so be it.

02:21:17,918 --> 02:21:20,695
Is there anyone you want to talk to?
Anything you want to say?

2405
02:21:21,994 --> 02:21:23,895
Through Bhavani's case,

2406
02:21:23,975 --> 02:21:26,865
the law has shown what will happen,
if a girl is preyed upon.

2407
02:21:26,945 --> 02:21:29,847
This verdict is not just for Bhavani.

2408
02:21:29,927 --> 02:21:32,263
It's for every woman across the nation...

2409
02:21:32,343 --> 02:21:35,647

an immediate death sentence?
