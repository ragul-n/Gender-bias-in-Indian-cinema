1
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:47,885
I linger no more

2
00:01:49,322 --> 00:02:00,426
I linger no more

3
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:11,533
those tears

4
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:24,554
I linger no more

5
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:45,742
my lord

6
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,713
o glorious king..

7
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,726
since you've built
this mausoleum

8
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:03,954
your slave is ready
to die for you..

9
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:12,069
the army is off on a
holiday, my queen

10
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:20,070
an entire army to kill
an unarmed queen?

11
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:27,315
I want to die at the
hands of my emperor

12
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:32,649
really?

13
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:37,627
not a chance.

14
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,527
why?

15
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:42,757
because..

16
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:48,163
I have promised my new queen.

17
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,666
who? -hey, what the!

18
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,538
my new queen in the city.

19
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:56,540
and this..

20
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,843
mausoleum is hers too

21
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,117
here..

22
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,389
jealous, are we?

23
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:07,522
go for it.

24
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,118
come..

25
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:11,657
here..

26
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:50,430
surrender.

27
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:52,532
what?

28
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:55,867
surrender.

29
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,345
they have no witnesses for
your earlier crimes

30
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:09,053
and section 396 will
get you only 4 years

31
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,624
you spoke to the cops?

32
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:17,192
krishna!

33
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:20,965
you hear me? did
you? -yes I did!

34
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:25,329
three days in three years that's
all the time I've spent with you

35
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:30,474
lonely nights kill me each day.

36
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,815
we lie on the bed
like dead body.

37
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,059
I can't take it anymore..

38
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,798
now I get it.

39
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,404
I'm such a fool..

40
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,308
what do you mean?

41
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,347
It seems like

42
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:17,111
my krishna has found
another lover.

43
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,173
look, I'll do as you say

44
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:40,110
If we don't come to power
in the next 3 months..

45
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,477
I'll cylinder for sure.

46
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,215
not 'cylinder' you
idiot, 'surrender'

47
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:48,479
yes.

48
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:50,386
smiIe..

49
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,451
you worry for nothing

50
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,687
so, can I go now?

51
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,359
what a strange tale this is

52
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,838
where does it begin,
how does it end?

53
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,909
what are these destinations?

54
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,144
neither of us can comprehend

55
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,276
why bro! -what bro!

56
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:31,187
this gentle breeze!
-and the hued skies!

57
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:33,548
my heart soars!

58
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:37,087
and my life too!

59
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,389
so lets fly!

60
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:42,294
where to? -to the
heavens above..!

61
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,254
do I Iook like a bog?

62
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,327
a eunuch then?

63
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,296
or maybe your?

64
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:21,931
brother-in-law.. please
forgive us

65
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:25,970
desperate measures
in desperate times

66
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,381
all your money is still here

67
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:35,112
2 million -all of it. count
it if you like..

68
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:41,392
you think I have the balls
to doubt your honesty?

69
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:47,462
I lost ice worth rs.15000
in my cold storage

70
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,133
15 grand!

71
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:53,005
If you wanted to steal the money

72
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,496
why did you blow the light fuse?

73
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,043
we would be caught in
the bright light!

74
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:02,212
anyway, the cold storage
is to freeze your money

75
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,511
not the bloody ice. -It's
3-feet-deep now, boss!

76
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:05,914
dig another 2 feet..

77
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,478
the deeper the better..

78
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,918
..for this rotten
uncle and nephew

79
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,753
they'll start stinking
in no time

80
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,383
show some mercy..

81
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:15,624
forgive!

82
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,762
I'm like a brother to your wife

83
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:20,958
so, I am like family!

84
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,331
please spare us in
the name of god!

85
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:24,896
yes, my love

86
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:28,366
save us sister!

87
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,500
only you can save us!

88
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:35,414
It's just some family feud
on the street, darling

89
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,544
you're back from your prayers?

90
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,350
allah be praised!

91
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:47,954
any last wishes?

92
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,064
wanna hear a joke?

93
00:10:57,036 --> 00:11:00,369
a priest was fed up with
his female parrot

94
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,200
she was ruining the piety
of his household

95
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,975
even I would be ashamed with the
abuses this parrot spurted out..

96
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,447
he consulted his friend, a judge

97
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:18,615
he advised him to bring the
parrot over to his place

98
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:21,817
he owned 2 parrots.

99
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:25,057
what better cure than
good company?

100
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:30,996
these parrots sang praises
of allah all day long

101
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,998
overjoyed with this offer,

102
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:39,107
the priest brought his parrot
over to the judge's house

103
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:42,610
as she was locked in the same
cage as the other two..

104
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:46,149
the two maIe parrots stopped
reciting the prayers

105
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:50,022
one smiled and turned to the
other and whispered..

106
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:53,655
what did he say?

107
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,725
how do I say it?

108
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,387
what?

109
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,931
khalu you tell him.. -what
the hell did he say?

110
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,697
whisper it to him..

111
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,833
can I say it in your
ear? -come..

112
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,371
sorry, brother-in-law

113
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,314
lets go..

114
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:21,885
khalu..

115
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,189
I think we should kill him.

116
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:28,621
how can I shatter my
sister's home?

117
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,491
I consider him my
brother-in-Iaw..

118
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:37,400
even if he doesn't

119
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,164
I hope the ropes are
not too tight..

120
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:42,799
I forgive you. now set me free..

121
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:49,103
maybe we erred a little
too early,

122
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,483
but it's too late
to turn back now.

123
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,785
next time, you'll dig
your own grave.

124
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,190
get a priest along for
a proper buriaI.

125
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:17,073
Ibn-e -batuta

126
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,504
carrying his shoes

127
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,071
Ibn-e -batuta

128
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:24,375
carrying his shoes

129
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:28,012
slips 'em on, and
it goes.. churrrr..

130
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,216
flies in, picks on
scattered grain

131
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:37,829
flies in, picks on
scattered grain

132
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:40,222
and the bird takes
flight again

133
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,357
furrrr..

134
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,965
Ibn-e -batuta

135
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,428
furrrr..

136
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,439
death waits around the corner

137
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:51,771
greetings, o holy one

138
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,742
oh! what's the rush instead?

139
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,084
sound the horn,
enter my garden

140
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:07,416
better late than dead

141
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:10,927
come.. let's fly
away.. furrrr..

142
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:13,996
Ibn-e -batuta

143
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,397
carrying his shoes

144
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,862
slips 'em on, and
it goes.. churrrr..

145
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,468

148
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:27,973
don't even dream to come here

149
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,909
what are you saying?
where will I go?

150
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:34,075

bhopal down to find you guys

00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:35,619

162
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,508
I helped you last year..

163
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:09,514
and your nephew made
my girl pregnant

164
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:13,684
wha.. what! -and you have the
gall to call me for help?!

165
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,656

166
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:25,003
Is there any other number left?

167
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,560
not in my list..

168
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:29,202
now what do we do?

169
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:34,078

186
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,630
I want a light

187
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:03,964
but why?

188
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,300
because I'm thirsty, you fool!

189
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,431
how do I light this torch
without a match!

190
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:12,073
fool!

191
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:17,274
krishna! o krishna! have
you burnt yourself dead?

192
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,783
you have guests

193
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:25,717
who the hell are you? bandits?

194
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,447
no. -then?

195
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:29,451
thieves? -no, no..

196
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:30,556
then?

197
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,919
fool!

198
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,644
a gift for mr. verma

199
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:01,624
his favourite brand
-from my town

200
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,492
power horse rum

201
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:08,024
according to myth, 5 pegs down

202
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:11,125
and you'll snigger
like a racehorse!

203
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,975
we had become like brothers
in just 3 months

204
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:27,143
he had taken shelter with us
after killing that politician

205
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,879
so is he in the unclothed
or behind the veil?

206
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:36,550
I mean, is he behind
bars or on the run?

207
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,461
I'll make some tea.

208
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,925
but its time for rum

209
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:43,830
he's just a funny guy

210
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:47,199
the bathroom's behind,
the towels are here

211
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,038
I'll fetch some ice
for your drinks..

212
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:53,938
food is on the plates inside..

213
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,606
that can wait till
mr. verma arrives

214
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,948
when is he getting back though?

215
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,017
never.

216
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:37,507
the night burns ever so slowly

217
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,117
the haze seeps into my eyes

218
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:55,331
the night burns ever so slowly

219
00:20:56,435 --> 00:21:02,396
the haze seeps into my eyes

220
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:10,039
through the nights, bit by bit

221
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:14,046
I've unraveled each new dawn

222
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:18,947
my eyes have, bit by bit

223
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:24,328
seen the break of a new day

224
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:29,457
moist eyes hold

225
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:35,473
the mist no more

226
00:21:38,443 --> 00:21:44,006
the night burns ever so slowly

227
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:49,978
the haze seeps into my eyes

228
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:03,264
my vision holds the
fire of my dreams

229
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,861
and with this fire

230
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:20,784
I've illumined these eyes

231
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,388
what the hell is going on here?

232
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,053
what happened nandu? -khalu?

233
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:32,789
I hope you haven't ruined
the jaggery again..

234
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:34,785
taste it for yourself ma'm.

235
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:37,461
have you tasted it?

236
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,563
I was fine with it
the last time too.

237
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,859
can you please taste it for
me? -of course, why not!

238
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:53,942
allah be praised!

239
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,612
can I have some more? -sure!

240
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:01,044
what about you?

241
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,416
I don't like sweets.

242
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:07,157
then how do you sing so sweet?

243
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:19,604
sorry, I ruined your plant in
the morning. -doesn't matter

244
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,433
ma'm please check the sugarcane

245
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:24,468
I will

246
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:29,377
I'm so sorry about mr. verma

247
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,874
we thought it will
be sorted by now

248
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,145
then, what happened?

249
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,828
but he was always there
for his friends..

250
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,500
the house is witness
to his friendships

251
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:54,463
If you're friends with fire,
you can't escape death.

252
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:02,536
you guys are as apart
as chalk and cheese

253
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:05,708
worse. as apart as a
hindu and a muslim

254
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,850
I wouId be ashamed to be friends
with such a person

255
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:12,887
he's my nephew.

256
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,652
who the hell are you?
put that gun away!

257
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:21,156
not a gun, a pistol

258
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:24,597
a screwed pistol

259
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,661
fire and you'll blow your
face. give it to me!

260
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:30,900
how old are you?

261
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:32,067
20 minus 5

262
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,406
you know a lot about guns

263
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:40,179
In our village, we fire a gun
before we learn to wash our ..

264
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:42,979
It's badly screwed. give it to
me when I go to the jungle

265
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:44,688
my father will fix it.

266
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,151
later

267
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,201
hey, listen, listen.. wait!

268
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:00,896
what is it?

269
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,167
what is your name? -nandu.

270
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:08,238
you wanna ride with
me to the city?

271
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:10,007
after I'm finished cleaning.

272
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:18,013
you know the way to
the red light area?

273
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:20,256
It'll cost you

274
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:22,519
obviously I won't go
to a brother to beg

275
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:25,725
I'm talking about my money.

276
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:29,566
but I'm not doing it with you

277
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,028
bye.

278
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:38,109
one look at you

279
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:43,509
and I feel this way

280
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:48,313
that I've known you forever

281
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:55,591
only you

282
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:58,229
I'm sorry?

283
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:00,993
It's from the film 'only you'

284
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:06,233
composed by jaidev

285
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:10,797
beautifully sung by
lata mangeshkar

286
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,507
you seem to know a
lot about music

287
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:14,776
yeah!

288
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:19,677
my uncle was a tabla player

289
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:23,817
from the Indore school of music.

290
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:25,612
then how come you?

291
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:28,590
destiny

292
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,294
even so, I can play
a little bit too.

293
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:41,872
pIease keep humming, lest the
food become too spicy.

294
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,410
can you peel garlic?
-yes, of course!

295
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:57,954
we need to cross the
border, into nepal

296
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,258
now, without mr. verma's help,

297
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:07,087
It will take two four day
to find new house.

298
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:10,866
Is there a safe house where
we can lie Iow until then?

299
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,762
you can stay here if you like.

300
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:21,970
but? -and the safe house will
have no music to hear,

301
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:24,306
nor any plants to ruin..

302
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,143
the garIic, pIease..

303
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:35,615
that's my village,
across the jungIe

304
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:38,262
and across that lake,
the landlords'

305
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,394
we earned 6 of them last month

306
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:42,433
earned?

307
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:44,460
whoa!

308
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,930
a caste war has been
on for decades..

309
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:48,937
each caste has its own army..

310
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:51,071
even I will join very soon

311
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:58,111
you owe me 92 rupees

312
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:07,222
here's 500

313
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:10,357
tell me..

314
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,487
what will you do in
your caste army?

315
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:14,525
go down this road and
take a right..

316
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,861
..and return here
when you're done

317
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:17,697
got it?

318
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:19,827
I'll give you 100 rupees daily..

319
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:21,831
work for us

320
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:23,966
why don't you do what
you came for?

321
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:19,580
brother-in-law, do forgive us!

322
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:20,991
do what?

323
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:23,950
forgive..

324
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,560
just do what he's saying

325
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:30,996
where's the money?

326
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:32,430
Inside -spent

327
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:48,813
It was here! where did it go?

328
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:52,588
what! I took 500 from
it just this morning

329
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:24,111
and you are?

330
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:30,421
how about an introduction?
shaII I go first?

331
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:32,056
brother-in-law!

332
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:35,932
leave her out of this..

333
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:40,264
If you like I could
bury her with you

334
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:55,613
but with us dead your
money is buried too..

335
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,649
forever.

336
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:03,927
one last chance..

337
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:05,262
please..

338
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:24,878
sister! -hello? who?

339
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:26,014

340
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,777
yes brother, tell me..

341
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,716
we are in big trouble

342
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:34,054
one little goof-up and he
wants to bury us alive!

343
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:38,154
what do you want from me?

344
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:41,023
It's brothers' day next
month please save me!

345
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:44,067
for god's sake.. -give
the phone to him

346
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,201
give the phone to
him -here, here..

347
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,471
yes, my love -look..

348
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:54,706
he's my brother after all

349
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,774
but, he's also wronged you

350
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,151
If you like, you can
Iet them live

351
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:03,584
or just kill them

352
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:06,218
whatever you feel like..

353
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,623
allah be praised!

354
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:19,231
I..

355
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:22,202
want my money back.

356
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:29,578
before brothers' day next month.

357
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:31,775
with interest.

358
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:36,015
you can run if you want..

359
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:38,216
but where will you go?

360
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:40,781
dubai? qatar?

361
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,954
kuala lumpur?

362
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,758
nepal?

363
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,261
I'll get you anywhere..

364
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,304
but not before I bury
one half of her..

365
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:05,441
in each of your graves.

366
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,887
don't worry. It's
just a small bruise

367
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:22,363
I'll just get you some
turmeric milk

368
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:26,801
where is the bag?

369
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:29,439
don't act innocent.

370
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:31,774
where have you hidden the money?

371
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,673
babban, have you lost it?
-you're the one who's lost it!

372
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,637
where could the bag disappear?

373
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:38,409
It was here yesterday..

374
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:40,709
there's no one here except us

375
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:42,644
there is..

376
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:44,049
nandu

377
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:46,949
when?

378
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,726
when you were busy
enjoying yourself

379
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,823
he was busy cleaning your room.

380
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:54,281
and they rape our daughters
and sisters

381
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:57,287
but, we are not impotent
anymore.

382
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,089
these guns are not merely

383
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:04,601
to hang lifelessly
on our shouIders

384
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:06,836
but for us to drag them
out of their holes

385
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:08,496
and make them pay
with their lives

386
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:12,001
If we have the courage..

387
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:26,682
which one is.. nandu's house?

388
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:29,391
get him over here

389
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,189
c'mon, stand here

390
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:33,263
who the hell are you?

391
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:34,963
I'm from haliya village..

392
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:37,262
hey, that's very close to
the Iandlords' village!

393
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:40,466
who told you the way here?

394
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:41,903
what's your name?

395
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:43,901
razzaq hussain

396
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:46,568
muslim, huh?

397
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,540
spill your reaI name and village

398
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:52,973
I'm originally from bhopal..

399
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:57,978
staying as a guest in haliya..
at mr. verma's house

400
00:37:58,523 --> 00:37:59,581
honestly..

401
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,457
so, what's this mr. guest?

402
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,727
my pistol was damaged

403
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:11,101
nandu said he'd have it fixed..

404
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:15,463
listen, boy..

405
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,469
nandu has joined the army

406
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:22,703
get it? -yes, sir

407
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:26,045
don't even try looking for him

408
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,475
okay? -yes, sir

409
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:32,746
so, how's mr. verma doing?

410
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:34,458
he's no more.

411
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:37,421
don't you know?

412
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,133
have you run away?

413
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,713
hey, old man.. have
you gone deaf?

414
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:00,941
can't you hear me shouting?
-what happened?

415
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:02,684
what happened? ..happened!

416
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,512
let's pack up and
get out of here

417
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:07,049
this place is very dangerous

418
00:39:07,592 --> 00:39:08,923
we only have shias and sunnis

419
00:39:09,227 --> 00:39:13,095
but here, every bloody caste
has its own army!

420
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:14,691
and mushtaq?

421
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:20,595
we'll slip away so quietly that
he'll grow oId looking for us

422
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:22,938
and we'll grow old running!

423
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,540
so, you plan to lay a golden
egg sitting here?

424
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:31,344
mushtaq has to be
killed this time.

425
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:32,974
let him come!

426
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,676
wonderful, my heroic solier!

427
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:38,146
mr. Iftekhar

428
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:39,780
move your..

429
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,484
switch to top gear and
Iet's get out of here

430
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:45,261
you go, I'm not coming

431
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:48,395
why? what's the matter?

432
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:54,328
I can't have an innocent
killed because of me

433
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:55,666
Innocent, who?

434
00:39:59,777 --> 00:40:01,870
love is really in the air..

435
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:06,446
stop trying to be a hero

436
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:08,614
why be a martyr when
there's no country?

437
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:13,423
you taught me. save your
own.. first, remember?

438
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,919
let the chick die if she has to

439
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:19,696
why care? -you may
not, but I do!

440
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:11,240
I didn't give you shelter
to put my life at stake

441
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:17,410
nobody is running, fighting
or doing anything eIse

442
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:21,218
without my consent.

443
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:26,128
aIways knew that you were a..

444
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,562
but you seemed smarter

445
00:41:31,802 --> 00:41:34,794
as it turns out, you
are fool no.1

446
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:49,085
Innocent, ain't she?

447
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,402
why do you need firewood..

448
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:15,275
when there are gas cylinders
in the house?

449
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:27,190
where did you Iearn
to shoot like that?

450
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:32,227
not very talkative, are we?

451
00:42:41,705 --> 00:42:45,141
I thought you stole my money..
sorry about that.

452
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,678
let's stop fighting for..

453
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:57,284
look..

454
00:42:58,222 --> 00:42:59,917
my tongue ain't quite poetic..

455
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:11,901
so what's a good tongue
to make you understand?

456
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:36,955
so, whose idea is this?

457
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:41,856
why care about the tree?
tell me how's the fruit?

458
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:46,500
you may choke to death

459
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:48,429
you're pissed khalu

460
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,105
you're no fool just because
she called you one

461
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:56,975
and khalu, this chick's nothing
like what you think she is

462
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:01,650
nothing like what?

463
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:06,086
like candy floss, rose petal..

464
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:07,719
fairy queen..

465
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:11,320
khalu, she's a bloody
firecracker!

466
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,327
thanks to verma, she knows all
the tricks of the trade

467
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,334
trust me khalu..

468
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:21,996
she has a brilliant plan!

469
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:30,111
much obliged, madam!

470
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,915
thank you so much!

471
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,213
losers like us in your gang?

472
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:46,120
but, we're small fry

473
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:52,392
laptop, mobile phone..
or at best, a car

474
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,936
we dare not abduct the
neighbour's cat

475
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:02,505
and she wants us to kidnap
a bloody millionaire!

476
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:05,848
why all the generosity?

477
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:16,149
we're fool, aren't we?

478
00:45:18,028 --> 00:45:19,461
are you listening?

479
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:38,713
fool!

480
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:47,920
sorry

481
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:50,521
he's had a bit too much

482
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:55,998
this night, the weather
by the river

483
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,396
this lively breeze

484
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:00,695
said two hearts in one voice

485
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:05,633
that once we meet,
we will never part

486
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:13,549
you're upset with me..

487
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:15,975
then why punish yourself?

488
00:46:18,555 --> 00:46:21,456
just go away!

489
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,127
go where?

490
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:29,528
fine..

491
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:33,665
you don't have to listen to me..

492
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:38,602
but next time don't beg for
mercy at mushtaq's feet

493
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:41,938
It's not a pretty sight.

494
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:57,183
with mr. verma, my will to live
was also reduced to ashes

495
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:02,258
a Ione woman Iike me..

496
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:05,597
is easy prey for lecherous men

497
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,197
add to that, the emptiness
of this house..

498
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:15,907
I've often thought
of killing myself.

499
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:20,078
but somehow, it never
bothered me

500
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,523
that all I actually have
are two old saris

501
00:47:28,258 --> 00:47:30,123
one bracelet and a few bindis

502
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:32,761
but since you've come

503
00:47:33,897 --> 00:47:36,229
these things have
begun to matter

504
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,933
once again, I've found
the desire to live.

505
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:09,024
why didn't you share
the plan with me?

506
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:28,017
I linger no more

507
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:38,591
I linger no more

508
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:47,700
those tears hold sway no more

509
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:59,407
I linger no more

510
00:49:12,696 --> 00:49:17,531
In the pools of my eyes

511
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:22,736
dreams swirled in at night

512
00:49:23,373 --> 00:49:27,639
with a touch, they flowed

513
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:32,945
with a whisper, they said

514
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:41,922
trust not such flights
of fancy

515
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:51,865
so.. I Iinger no more

516
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:27,960
target is the plan.. the target
will tell us what to do.

517
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,174
mr. verma used his contacts
in the Income tax dept.

518
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:33,971
and put together this
list of targets

519
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:37,413
he was a true artist, mr. verma

520
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:40,316
but who among these?
-what's the ransom?

521
00:50:40,651 --> 00:50:41,845
50 million -5 million

522
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:44,613
why 50 million?

523
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:47,916
2.5 for mushtaq. Isn't the
rest enough for us?

524
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:51,659
you think small khalu. It's
time for the big kill

525
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:54,296
Is 50 enough? not too little?

526
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:02,430
there's no dearth of rich
people in gorakhpur

527
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,337
ram prasad gupta

528
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:06,270
din dayal trivedi

529
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:07,775
prakash maroo

530
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:09,939
jaikishen kedia

531
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:12,209
or dr. aggarwal

532
00:51:15,385 --> 00:51:18,013
they say, 'throw a
stone in the air..

533
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:19,885
and it will land on a
millionaire's head'

534
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:26,119
but the bigger the catch,
the greater the danger.

535
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:35,402
no no..

536
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:41,102
greed will kill us all.

537
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:47,446
let's try something smaller

538
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:51,879
so we get the money, without
risking our lives

539
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:54,389
okay, 50 cancel, let's
make it 20.

540
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:57,589
Is there a smaller
fish in the ocean?

541
00:51:58,261 --> 00:51:59,853
what happened? -nothing

542
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:03,325
I said let's fish for
somebody smaller..

543
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:05,857
what do you think?

544
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,362
kamal kant kakkar

545
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:10,935
the smaII fish we
are looking for..

546
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:15,875
he'll want to eat dal and
rice, even in new york.

547
00:52:17,647 --> 00:52:20,138
I toId him, we've got a 10
year visa, learn to eat pizza.

548
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:24,954
somehow, he's gone unnoticed
by the kidnapping mafia

549
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:27,951
but mr. verma was sharper
than that.

550
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:33,659
and we will do what
he had once planned

551
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,461
kukku! kukku!

552
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,665
your ad is playing on tv

553
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:45,537
so why wait! what's the deal?

554
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:48,640
because there is none
like kk steel

555
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,518
my steel

556
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,081
your steel

557
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:00,052
our steel

558
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:01,388
k.k. steel!

559
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:15,735
these bloody trade unions..

560
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:20,306
weapons

561
00:53:20,876 --> 00:53:21,604
phone

562
00:53:21,744 --> 00:53:22,540
cash.

563
00:53:23,846 --> 00:53:25,143
and the right time..

564
00:53:26,148 --> 00:53:29,208
where kakkar was,
is and will be..

565
00:53:29,952 --> 00:53:33,683
we study every move he makes

566
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:45,762
all I've earned till date..

567
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:48,665
will be enough to
buy a used car.

568
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:51,900
we won't need that

569
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:55,734
we'll be tracked down
if we buy a car

570
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,237
we will steal one.

571
00:53:59,348 --> 00:54:00,975
I'II Iift one tomorrow morning

572
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:03,879
I'll lift one tomorrow
morning no way!

573
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:08,388
If we steal tomorrow, we'll
be arrested day after

574
00:54:08,858 --> 00:54:12,021
we'll swipe the car a day
before the kidnapping

575
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:16,755
and we'll steal it from
faizabad, not gorakhpur.

576
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:17,960
why?

577
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:21,232
so that we mislead the cops..

578
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,898
by placing hotel and petrol
bills from faizabad in the car.

579
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:28,603
so they'll keep Iooking for us
in faizabad while we get away

580
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:35,347
some tea for you?

581
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:41,287
why bro?

582
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:43,421
what bro?

583
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:45,090
flying too high, are we?

584
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:47,558
time to land, dear brother

585
00:54:49,064 --> 00:54:50,326
we've only 12 days left

586
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:56,770
'monday'

587
00:55:11,987 --> 00:55:12,954
'tuesday'

588
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:17,958
he's here

589
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:20,961
now tell me the car number

590
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:27,260
'wednesday'

591
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:33,537
'thursday'

592
00:55:42,418 --> 00:55:44,079
four days left

593
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:49,257
but brother's day is 6 days away

594
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:51,223
but your funeral is 4 days away

595
00:55:52,428 --> 00:55:55,295
my niece gets married
day after in lucknow

596
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:59,625
I'll look you up right
after. -but, sir..

597
00:56:11,814 --> 00:56:12,678
'friday'

598
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:15,750
the chinese have taken
over the market

599
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:40,063
'saturday'

600
00:56:44,246 --> 00:56:45,804
we should've just run away

601
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:48,709
but your common sense
was on a stroll

602
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:54,820
doesn't look like we'll
ever find kakkar aIone.

603
00:56:56,425 --> 00:56:59,223
and your brother-in-law is
dying to give us a funeral

604
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:06,461
kakkar goes to the temple at 8
and reaches the factory by 11..

605
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:11,466
considering it's just
a half hour drive

606
00:57:11,874 --> 00:57:17,039
what keeps him in the
temple for so long?

607
00:58:01,557 --> 00:58:02,785
hello babban? hey!

608
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:07,552
sir.. sir, my phone fallen down.

609
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:09,458
one minute, stop.

610
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:14,347
who's that?

611
01:00:14,456 --> 01:00:15,753
who the hell is this?

612
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:19,385
where're you mamta?

613
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:27,991
come my beloved.

614
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:37,441
I have reached the
prime of youth.

615
01:00:37,713 --> 01:00:43,652
I'm waiting for you come soon.

616
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:45,514
say something please

617
01:00:46,922 --> 01:00:52,861
come my beloved.

618
01:00:55,197 --> 01:01:01,898
I have reached the
prime of youth.

619
01:01:02,337 --> 01:01:04,464
you're my sIave.

620
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:10,474
let's put your strength to test!

621
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:16,781
so, can you quench my thirst?

622
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:19,319
no, no

623
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:22,021
I can't be unfaithful to mamta

624
01:01:24,826 --> 01:01:27,556
what about now? -no way.

625
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:32,088
now? now? now? -no, no, no.

626
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:42,704
mamta, it's you!

627
01:01:44,446 --> 01:01:45,435
you win..

628
01:01:47,049 --> 01:01:47,777
I lose

629
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:51,916
your love for me is eternal

630
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:57,748
now will you quench my thirst?

631
01:01:57,793 --> 01:01:59,522
sweetheart!

632
01:01:59,728 --> 01:02:01,059
my darling!

633
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:09,801
this feels good.

634
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:22,776
the world thinks he
visits the temple

635
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:26,516
but the rituals take place
in the beauty parlour

636
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:33,551
we couldn't have found a
better place for our job

637
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:39,165
let's head to faizabad
tomorrow for the car.

638
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,370
was there anyone else there?

639
01:02:45,374 --> 01:02:45,999
who?

640
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:48,802
the lady with the whip

641
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:51,503
lady who?

642
01:02:52,714 --> 01:02:53,612
what happened!

643
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:55,244
what's so funny?

644
01:02:56,451 --> 01:02:57,645
what happened?

645
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:04,751
I can't be unfaithful
to mamta -mamta who?

646
01:03:05,794 --> 01:03:10,822
hey uncle, is this your
phone? yes it is

647
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:17,167
it fell down inside. thanks
a lot It's been an hour.

648
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:19,273
thank you very much.

649
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:38,317
baban!

650
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:42,655
It's been an hour. are you
laying eggs in there?

651
01:03:42,764 --> 01:03:44,095
counting chikens.

652
01:03:44,966 --> 01:03:46,160
khalujaan, breakfast

653
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:54,131
please don't call me khalujaan

654
01:03:55,077 --> 01:03:57,011
why not? It's such a nice name

655
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:02,307
khalu means uncle

656
01:04:03,952 --> 01:04:07,080
I feel old every time you say it.

657
01:04:08,857 --> 01:04:10,484
my name is Iftekhar

658
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:12,918
that sounds even older

659
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:18,230
so then..

660
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:22,469
let's cut out the khalu

661
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,972
and stick with the
jaan (beloved)

662
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:27,604
what?

663
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:33,741
khalu I can't go

664
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:34,975
why?

665
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:37,247
my tummy's all screwed up

666
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,010
this was the 4th time already

667
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:43,217
you're an expert in
stealing cars anyway

668
01:04:43,492 --> 01:04:46,359
Its too risky alone

669
01:04:47,696 --> 01:04:49,027
shouId I come along then?

670
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:55,365
I'll be ready in a minute

671
01:04:58,507 --> 01:05:00,566
I'll give you a pill
and you'll be fine.

672
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:04,042
feeling any better?

673
01:05:04,146 --> 01:05:05,807
you'll soon be better

674
01:05:07,215 --> 01:05:10,742
If krishna has said
it, it will be true

675
01:05:15,957 --> 01:05:18,152
just a few more days..

676
01:05:20,662 --> 01:05:22,994
and we'll be back home..

677
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:29,194
with the sun shining out of
our.. by the riverside

678
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:32,204
It's so cool out here.

679
01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:36,736
shouId we ask krishna
to come along?

680
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:38,137
to the riverside?

681
01:05:38,246 --> 01:05:40,407
no, to the village

682
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:44,382
better than being aIone here

683
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:46,982
there she'll have me and you

684
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:50,792
and soon you'll be married too

685
01:05:52,994 --> 01:05:55,758
we'll tell her, live with us

686
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,930
live with me

687
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:01,833
are you alright?

688
01:06:02,704 --> 01:06:05,673
It hurts too much! -where
are you off to?

689
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,573
can't heIp it

690
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:09,701
we'll miss the bus

691
01:06:14,115 --> 01:06:16,345
we don't have time for this

692
01:06:16,418 --> 01:06:17,942
our bus is about to leave

693
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,481
things are way beyond my control

694
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:22,683
hang on to it..

695
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,315
you can continue in faizabad

696
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:25,792
come out.

697
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:27,988
hey uncle, time to go!

698
01:06:28,096 --> 01:06:29,825
hang on, just a minute

699
01:06:30,098 --> 01:06:32,123
our bus is leaving you idiot!

700
01:06:34,669 --> 01:06:36,500
come on. -I'm coming.

701
01:06:36,605 --> 01:06:37,799
come and sit.

702
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:56,115
the sight of her binds me
and I can't look away

703
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:04,131
this silky strand I
can't tear away

704
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,930
It's been years since
I've turned grey

705
01:07:12,007 --> 01:07:16,341
yet the color of youth
refuses to fade away

706
01:07:16,678 --> 01:07:20,637
oh! and now my heart
beats faster

707
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:24,784
my face is losing its colour

708
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,788
I fear those lonely nights

709
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:32,552
my heart is but a child

710
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:38,892
my heart is but a child

711
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:43,066
Innocent but naive

712
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:47,137
my heart is but a child

713
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:52,836
the sight of her binds me
and I can't look away

714
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:56,907
this silky strand I
can't tear away

715
01:07:56,952 --> 01:08:01,082
It's been years since
I've turned grey

716
01:08:01,156 --> 01:08:05,149
yet the color of youth
refuses to fade away

717
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:42,529
who knew I'd given shelter

718
01:08:42,797 --> 01:08:46,096
to such a roguish heart

719
01:08:46,868 --> 01:08:50,634
forever I imagined it would be

720
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:54,238
as virtuous as me

721
01:08:54,476 --> 01:08:56,307
oh! and it pulls at me

722
01:08:56,444 --> 01:08:58,275
It makes such a racket

723
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:02,973
It gives undue importance
to trivial things

724
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:10,185
nothing's more devious
than the heart

725
01:09:11,393 --> 01:09:13,122
someone stop me

726
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:15,122
someone hold me

727
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,293
or eIse at this age

728
01:09:17,599 --> 01:09:19,328
I will be deceived

729
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:22,970
and now I fear I'll
fall in love

730

my heart is but a child

731
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:31,604
my heart is but a child

732
01:09:33,214 --> 01:09:35,375
Innocent but naive

733
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:39,814
my heart is but a child

734
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,514
how do I look?

735
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:17,988
like a fool..

736
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:31,769
you like this better?

737
01:11:52,387 --> 01:11:55,220
my heart is but a child

738
01:11:56,558 --> 01:11:59,220
my heart is but a child

739
01:12:00,662 --> 01:12:03,062
Innocent but naive

740
01:12:04,732 --> 01:12:07,530
my heart is but a child

741
01:12:53,615 --> 01:12:54,809
get dressed..

742
01:12:56,818 --> 01:12:58,308

743
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:01,147
screw that..

744
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:03,590
I'm not going anywhere

745
01:13:06,794 --> 01:13:08,125
you will have to

746
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:11,590
I'm staying right here

747
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:15,064
here?

748
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:17,433
forever?

749
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:23,641
and what will you do here?

750
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:36,720
marry you

751
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:42,061
marry me?

752
01:13:43,798 --> 01:13:45,698
no, the lady with the torch

753
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:37,346
I saw you girl and played
my heart's guitar

754
01:14:40,722 --> 01:14:44,180
I saw you girl and played
my heart's guitar

755
01:14:44,258 --> 01:14:45,919
love-drops from your eyes

756
01:14:45,994 --> 01:14:47,689
and played my heart's guitar

757
01:14:47,795 --> 01:14:50,662
drunkenness is all around

758
01:14:51,232 --> 01:14:53,894
life is fun fun fun

759
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,798
hey hey here i go

760
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:58,532

01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,774
and my heart goes with me

763
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:43,173
when will you be back?

764
01:15:43,484 --> 01:15:45,475
In a couple of days

765
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:53,588
didn't realize when you
got back last night.

766
01:15:53,628 --> 01:15:54,890
you should've woken me up.

767
01:15:56,097 --> 01:15:59,157
no body can dare to entering
in your dream.

768
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:01,866

769

775
01:16:47,849 --> 01:16:48,645

776
01:17:29,457 --> 01:17:31,584

777
01:17:36,764 --> 01:17:38,197

778
01:17:39,934 --> 01:17:41,196

hemant kumar..

783
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:04,786

sulking all morning?

784
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:08,856
what happened? -nothing,

785
01:18:11,432 --> 01:18:13,764
you're such a bad liar

786
01:18:14,869 --> 01:18:16,200
because I'm a man.

787
01:18:16,938 --> 01:18:17,734
yes!

788
01:18:18,773 --> 01:18:20,172
and if you were a woman?

789
01:18:21,342 --> 01:18:23,572
then you would never know
if I was an angel..

790
01:18:23,678 --> 01:18:24,770
or a whore

791
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,232
yes.

792
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:13,854
what gives you the
right to abuse me?

793
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:18,688
are you my husband?

794
01:19:21,502 --> 01:19:22,696
my lover then?

795
01:19:25,206 --> 01:19:26,230
or my pimp?

796
01:19:57,738 --> 01:20:00,400
where are you coming from?

797
01:20:01,142 --> 01:20:02,302
license?

798
01:20:02,777 --> 01:20:03,869
not bad..

799
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:05,334
thank you.

800
01:20:05,813 --> 01:20:07,508
what about the license?

801
01:20:08,516 --> 01:20:10,609
what precinct are you from?

802
01:20:13,587 --> 01:20:14,918
kavva bagh colony

803
01:20:16,057 --> 01:20:17,285

804
01:20:23,331 --> 01:20:26,323

807
01:20:53,994 --> 01:20:55,461
there's an accident there

808
01:20:55,529 --> 01:20:57,394
let's check it out

809
01:21:01,702 --> 01:21:03,363
have you lost it?

810
01:21:03,604 --> 01:21:05,697
we were to kidnap, not kill him

811
01:21:06,807 --> 01:21:09,275
crowd will gather soon. let's
put him in our car

812
01:21:13,814 --> 01:21:15,839
what went wrong? did
the tyre burst?

813
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:18,644
Is he dead? -the brakes
must have failed

814
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:20,812
tyre is stuck in the drainage.

815
01:21:21,021 --> 01:21:22,579
what's going on here?

816
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:23,921
back off!

817
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:26,319
give the man some air..

818
01:21:29,163 --> 01:21:30,095
mr. gulati?

819
01:21:30,698 --> 01:21:31,722
I know him well

820
01:21:31,932 --> 01:21:33,524
he does this quite often.
nothing to worry

821
01:21:33,634 --> 01:21:35,033
Is there a hospital nearby?

822
01:21:35,102 --> 01:21:36,694
let's get him out!

823
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:38,635
come on, give me a hand

824
01:21:44,345 --> 01:21:46,745
come, come out..

825
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,540
stop braying like
a donkey -no way!

826
01:22:19,113 --> 01:22:20,944
you're part of my life.

827
01:22:21,649 --> 01:22:23,742
what's wrong with you khalu?

828
01:22:24,952 --> 01:22:28,046
truth is a bitter pill.
takes time to swallow

829
01:22:28,789 --> 01:22:29,949
what truth?

830
01:22:38,332 --> 01:22:39,321
sorry khalu

831
01:22:41,168 --> 01:22:45,696
by the time I knew
of your intentions

832
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:49,373
I had already slipped

833
01:22:50,778 --> 01:22:52,643
I was wondering whether
to tell you or not

834
01:22:53,347 --> 01:22:54,780
In a way its good you know

835
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,077
fate has sorted it out.

836
01:22:58,752 --> 01:23:00,720
now just get us married

837
01:23:02,089 --> 01:23:04,182
If not krishna, you can atleast
play with her kids

838
01:23:04,492 --> 01:23:05,720
what are you doing?

839
01:23:07,828 --> 01:23:09,159
don't annoy me

840
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:10,255
hey!

841
01:23:18,005 --> 01:23:19,529
Is it hurting a lot? so sorry

842
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,473
you piece of! you deserve
to be in the gutters

843
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:25,406
your father had eloped with
the priest's daughter

844
01:23:25,613 --> 01:23:27,604
If I hadn't raised you

845
01:23:27,815 --> 01:23:30,716
you'd still be a dog in
the bylanes of aligarh

846
01:23:32,152 --> 01:23:33,244
and you?

847
01:23:33,521 --> 01:23:34,613
If not for me

848
01:23:34,755 --> 01:23:37,724
you'd still be licking
mushtaq's feet

849
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,067
I've raised you like
my own son, you!

850
01:23:49,136 --> 01:23:52,230
like your own son? you couIdn't
even get me married

851
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,301
couldn't raise enough
for the priest

852
01:23:54,408 --> 01:23:55,932
the wedding party
had to turn back

853
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:59,741
nobody wanted a whoring
..for a son-in-law

854
01:24:00,915 --> 01:24:03,543
they figured both of
you out quite earIy

855
01:24:05,486 --> 01:24:06,145
both who?

856
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:07,152
you

857
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:09,483
and?

858
01:24:09,657 --> 01:24:11,318
and your mother

859
01:24:13,527 --> 01:24:14,824
I warn you khalu

860
01:24:15,296 --> 01:24:16,820
don't drag my mother into this
-I'm dragging nobody..

861
01:24:16,897 --> 01:24:18,592
the whole world says it.

862
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,698
says what?

863
01:24:21,268 --> 01:24:24,601
the whoring son of a
flirtatious mother

864
01:25:12,453 --> 01:25:13,647
where's vidya?

865
01:25:14,888 --> 01:25:16,014
who?

866
01:25:19,493 --> 01:25:21,017
my beloved husband

867
01:25:21,495 --> 01:25:22,757
vidyadhar verma

868
01:25:29,503 --> 01:25:30,401
krishna!

869
01:25:37,845 --> 01:25:40,336
you immersed his ashes
in the ganges yourself

870
01:25:45,986 --> 01:25:47,783
I've told you before
that he's dead

871
01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:49,883
you are delusional.

872
01:25:50,491 --> 01:25:51,389
call him

873
01:25:54,395 --> 01:25:55,225
come on

874
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,859
have you gone mad?

875
01:26:30,698 --> 01:26:34,532
'dreaded criminal verma dies in
gas cylinder explosion at home'

876
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,633
you're free to go

877
01:27:09,603 --> 01:27:12,834
you can catch the evening
train to bhopal

878
01:27:15,309 --> 01:27:16,537
where's kakkar?

879
01:27:19,046 --> 01:27:20,673
It's about 2.5 million

880
01:27:21,882 --> 01:27:23,679
perhaps not enough for you

881
01:27:24,685 --> 01:27:26,983
but enough to repay your debt

882
01:27:28,989 --> 01:27:30,047
please count it

883
01:27:30,157 --> 01:27:31,419
we used to count it

884
01:27:33,127 --> 01:27:35,891
everyday before it was stolen

885
01:27:37,164 --> 01:27:40,497
that's all we did day and night

886
01:27:44,004 --> 01:27:46,472
I could've run away
with the money

887
01:27:47,474 --> 01:27:49,101
you would've never found me

888
01:27:51,145 --> 01:27:53,773
but I don't want the money
-you want more money

889
01:27:55,516 --> 01:27:57,347
she's turned out to be
the mother of all

890
01:27:58,986 --> 01:28:00,715
still wanna marry her?

891
01:28:01,588 --> 01:28:03,556
and have your kids
play in my lap?

892
01:28:09,229 --> 01:28:10,958
the sooner you leave
this place..

893
01:28:11,398 --> 01:28:12,990
..the better -better!

894
01:28:16,804 --> 01:28:18,271
before we leave

895
01:28:19,807 --> 01:28:22,332
may we know your reason
for doing this?

896
01:28:24,311 --> 01:28:26,176
love has no reasons.

897
01:28:28,749 --> 01:28:30,046
this bag is torn

898
01:28:31,752 --> 01:28:32,980
Is there another one?

899
01:28:37,257 --> 01:28:38,224
that one?

900
01:28:47,835 --> 01:28:48,859
where's kakkar?

901
01:28:51,338 --> 01:28:52,430
where is he?

902
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,608
where the hell is he?

903
01:29:09,389 --> 01:29:11,323
must be in the house somewhere.
let's go look

904
01:29:12,559 --> 01:29:13,651
you go khalu

905
01:29:14,461 --> 01:29:15,951
you're making a big mistake

906
01:29:17,764 --> 01:29:19,595
kakkar is a dangerous man

907
01:29:21,101 --> 01:29:22,625
his steel business is a cover

908
01:29:23,737 --> 01:29:25,762
to smuggle arms from nepal

909
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,304
really?

910
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:33,277
kakkar is verma's right
hand man -'Is'?

911
01:29:34,214 --> 01:29:35,511
you mean verma is alive?

912
01:29:39,987 --> 01:29:40,612
yes

913
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:45,248
and they tried to kill me.

914
01:29:47,227 --> 01:29:48,524
and they failed?

915
01:29:49,463 --> 01:29:51,624
awesome!

916
01:30:05,913 --> 01:30:07,039
there's very little time left

917
01:30:07,147 --> 01:30:09,707
leave with the money or you'll
get killed with me

918
01:30:10,517 --> 01:30:12,109
verma will be here soon

919
01:30:14,187 --> 01:30:16,382
and why have you
called him here?

920
01:30:21,762 --> 01:30:23,457
last night, as you slept

921
01:30:25,966 --> 01:30:27,900
I sat watching you all night

922
01:30:31,838 --> 01:30:33,806
you're the first
woman I've loved

923
01:30:35,108 --> 01:30:36,769
and you!

924
01:30:38,478 --> 01:30:39,843
you were playing games with me?

925
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:42,881
baban!

926
01:30:43,817 --> 01:30:46,650
don't know where the
..has hidden him..

927
01:31:07,874 --> 01:31:08,704
baban!

928
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:18,884
I knew her husband rather well

929
01:31:19,753 --> 01:31:21,380
he was a big time crook

930
01:31:23,023 --> 01:31:24,786
he would try to extort
money from me too

931
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,149
but sir..

932
01:31:29,262 --> 01:31:32,231
even he never asked for so much

933
01:31:33,467 --> 01:31:35,628
I mean, I have money

934
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:41,034
but I can't just snap my fingers

935
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,641
and get 40 million

936
01:31:42,709 --> 01:31:43,767
40 million?

937
01:31:45,045 --> 01:31:46,307
didn't we fix on 20?

938
01:31:46,713 --> 01:31:49,307
but I've offered 25 myself

939
01:31:49,883 --> 01:31:51,976
verma was your business partner?

940
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,387
business?

941
01:31:57,591 --> 01:31:59,252
what business sir?

942
01:31:59,659 --> 01:32:01,684
arms smuggling from nepal?

943
01:32:05,766 --> 01:32:06,562
sir..

944
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:11,435
I don't know what relationship
you all share

945
01:32:13,707 --> 01:32:16,801
I've nothing more to
say in my defense

946
01:32:18,078 --> 01:32:18,806
sir..

947
01:32:19,613 --> 01:32:22,377
just tell me what you
want me to do..

948
01:32:22,849 --> 01:32:25,147
how long to arrange 25 million?

949
01:32:35,328 --> 01:32:36,955
hello -mamta?

950
01:32:38,632 --> 01:32:39,530
but I..

951
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,168
her hands were busy, so I..

952
01:32:42,235 --> 01:32:43,793
put it on speaker -ok

953
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,462
no, no mamta, don't!

954
01:32:45,739 --> 01:32:46,637
yes kukku?

955
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,702
I need some cash urgently

956
01:32:49,776 --> 01:32:51,835
why? you've been kidnapped?

957
01:32:51,912 --> 01:32:54,278
no, no! Income tax

958
01:32:54,347 --> 01:32:55,177
understand!

959
01:32:55,248 --> 01:32:56,272
listen carefully

960
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:58,475
take 15 million from the fridge

961
01:32:58,618 --> 01:33:00,415
and 10 from the microwave..

962
01:33:00,587 --> 01:33:01,918
and get to the factory quickly

963
01:33:02,122 --> 01:33:06,081
men from the Income tax dept.
will come in an hour

964
01:33:06,293 --> 01:33:06,987
kuku, you're..

965
01:33:07,094 --> 01:33:08,618
oh! don't worry about me

966
01:33:08,762 --> 01:33:09,888
I'll be home by evening

967
01:33:19,606 --> 01:33:20,470
let's go

968
01:33:21,141 --> 01:33:22,073
and kakkar?

969
01:33:22,142 --> 01:33:24,133
have locked him in the temple.
they'll find him.

970
01:33:28,381 --> 01:33:29,279
khaIu..

971
01:33:30,283 --> 01:33:32,046
she knows everything about us

972
01:33:32,953 --> 01:33:34,215
she might tell the cops..

973
01:33:35,122 --> 01:33:36,350
what do we do?

974
01:33:37,057 --> 01:33:38,046
what else?

975
01:33:40,026 --> 01:33:40,924
kill her

976
01:34:14,294 --> 01:34:15,784
khaIu, you kill her.. -why?

977
01:34:16,496 --> 01:34:17,554
what why? kill her!

978
01:34:18,098 --> 01:34:19,497
but why don't you kill her?

979
01:34:19,733 --> 01:34:20,995
why don't you?

980
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:26,601
because I've fallen
in love with the..

981
01:34:29,342 --> 01:34:30,309
this is great

982
01:34:31,344 --> 01:34:32,709
when you do it, it's love

983
01:34:33,547 --> 01:34:34,775
when I do it, it's sex

984
01:35:18,692 --> 01:35:19,454
nandu!

985
01:35:31,371 --> 01:35:32,497
at least count it

986
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:34,131
no it's fine

987
01:35:35,008 --> 01:35:36,168
you're just like family

988
01:35:38,878 --> 01:35:39,810
It's fine

989
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:32,321
mr. verma -I'm no longer verma

01:36:37,604 --> 01:36:39,697
I swear to god, mr. verma.. er..

992
01:36:40,707 --> 01:36:41,765
I mean mr. kulshreshtha

993
01:36:41,808 --> 01:36:45,039
If we had any idea we would
not get involved

994
01:36:46,413 --> 01:36:49,780
If it wasn't for mushtaq's
sword hanging over us

995
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:52,608
we would've left long ago

996
01:36:53,086 --> 01:36:54,144
right babban? -yes.

997
01:37:01,561 --> 01:37:04,325
all right.. I'll go
meet her myself

998
01:37:04,631 --> 01:37:06,656
so we'II take your leave? -why?

999
01:37:07,934 --> 01:37:09,834
don't wanna see her
one last time?

1000
01:37:12,305 --> 01:37:13,169
let's go

1001
01:37:13,807 --> 01:37:14,637
come..

1002
01:37:34,694 --> 01:37:36,321
where are you taking us?

1003
01:37:37,864 --> 01:37:38,558
huh?

1004
01:37:41,968 --> 01:37:43,265
have we reached?

1005
01:37:43,837 --> 01:37:46,897
yes, yes.. please..

1006
01:37:47,107 --> 01:37:48,802
where are you taking us?

1007
01:37:48,842 --> 01:37:50,400
come out here

1008
01:37:54,314 --> 01:37:55,872
where have you brought us?

1009
01:37:56,983 --> 01:37:58,382
hey! not another word from you!

1010
01:38:01,388 --> 01:38:02,821
bro, you're here, right?

1011
01:38:02,922 --> 01:38:03,889
I'm right here

1012
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:06,152
It's time we start praying..

1013
01:38:07,527 --> 01:38:09,358
hey! how far is it?

1014
01:38:09,629 --> 01:38:11,961
you want to kill us
by making us waIk?

1015
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:14,158
sorry for raising my hand on you

1016
01:38:14,801 --> 01:38:16,166
no.. no.. It's ok

1017
01:38:16,269 --> 01:38:17,327
I just wanted to say..

1018
01:38:17,404 --> 01:38:21,101
hey! what are you doing?
-stop pushing!

1019
01:38:39,325 --> 01:38:40,519
you wanted to know

1020
01:38:41,094 --> 01:38:42,721
what I would do in the army

1021
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,224
check this out

1022
01:38:45,765 --> 01:38:46,959
chinese pistol

1023
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:51,969
verma sent you to kill us?

1024
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,974
I was to dump your bodies
in this river

1025
01:38:56,743 --> 01:38:58,108
was my first solo job

1026
01:39:01,915 --> 01:39:04,816
you always knew that
verma is alive?

1027
01:39:05,618 --> 01:39:07,813
no saw him when I went to the
jungle to meet my father

1028
01:39:08,721 --> 01:39:11,554
thought I'd seen a ghost

1029
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:13,956
then later, people told
me the whole story

1030
01:39:14,427 --> 01:39:15,724
what did they tell you?

1031
01:39:26,673 --> 01:39:27,901
when they got married..

1032
01:39:28,174 --> 01:39:29,835
varma had promised krishna..

1033
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:32,139
that he'll leave his
criminal ways..

1034
01:39:33,813 --> 01:39:34,802
forever..

1035
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,073
but he didn't

1036
01:39:42,055 --> 01:39:43,750
he loved her for sure..

1037
01:39:44,591 --> 01:39:46,115
but not more than his weapons

1038
01:39:47,994 --> 01:39:51,225
her stubbornness began
getting in his way

1039
01:39:52,932 --> 01:39:54,331
he wanted to be free..

1040
01:39:54,968 --> 01:39:57,835
..from the police and krishna

1041
01:40:02,842 --> 01:40:07,336
and for his rebirth, varma
orchestrated his own death

1042
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:26,755
varma did a lot for our caste..

1043
01:40:28,234 --> 01:40:30,998
..but for what he
did to krishna,

1044
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:33,402
I can never forgive him

1045
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:36,299
that's why I'm letting you go

1046
01:40:39,712 --> 01:40:43,546
no conflict is deeper than the
one between husband and wife

1047
01:40:44,717 --> 01:40:46,981
It's by god's grace
that she survived

1048
01:40:49,155 --> 01:40:50,782
will he help her again?

1049
01:40:51,524 --> 01:40:55,119
she's alone against
verma and his goons

1050
01:40:58,932 --> 01:41:02,891
you have her all tied up.
she can't even escape

1051
01:41:07,206 --> 01:41:09,868
screw it. what's it to us?

1052
01:41:55,955 --> 01:41:58,287
kukku, kukku!

1053
01:41:59,292 --> 01:42:00,520
kukku!

1054
01:42:04,163 --> 01:42:05,095
where are you?

1055
01:42:06,599 --> 01:42:07,588
kukku!

1056
01:42:18,611 --> 01:42:20,306
kukku!

1057
01:42:24,984 --> 01:42:27,782
kukku!

1058
01:42:36,095 --> 01:42:37,687
and I slapped her twice!

1059
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:40,495
you are a woman, behave
like one..

1060
01:42:40,633 --> 01:42:43,534
else go sit on your
father's head..

1061
01:42:43,603 --> 01:42:45,969
we've to put them in their place

1062
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:50,304
hey you, stop! you
dare attack cops?

1063
01:44:13,159 --> 01:44:14,183
I..

1064
01:44:16,362 --> 01:44:20,526
was happy to hear that..

1065
01:44:22,301 --> 01:44:25,270
that night.. you survived.

1066
01:44:36,516 --> 01:44:38,074
how did you find out?

1067
01:44:42,688 --> 01:44:43,620
moustache?

1068
01:44:46,826 --> 01:44:48,953
you ook like a chick

1069
01:44:51,397 --> 01:44:53,160
how did you find out?

1070
01:45:00,072 --> 01:45:02,165
you stubborn girl

1071
01:45:05,044 --> 01:45:06,944
you never understood..

1072
01:45:08,748 --> 01:45:12,275
the army depended on me, no?

1073
01:45:13,753 --> 01:45:16,278
I couIdn't have run
away like a coward

1074
01:45:16,689 --> 01:45:17,747
for your sake..

1075
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:19,822
and you?

1076
01:45:20,526 --> 01:45:22,357
surrender, surrender

1077
01:45:22,395 --> 01:45:25,626
not 'surrender', 'cylinder'

1078
01:45:32,438 --> 01:45:34,804
that night the gas cyIinder
was empty..

1079
01:45:40,513 --> 01:45:44,415
the cops insisted
that I'm mistaken

1080
01:45:46,652 --> 01:45:48,552
but when I searched the corpse..

1081
01:45:48,988 --> 01:45:50,046
your corpse

1082
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:52,951
then I was certain

1083
01:45:57,196 --> 01:45:58,163
ask me how

1084
01:46:12,278 --> 01:46:14,610
you hated me so much?

1085
01:46:16,482 --> 01:46:18,074
I hated you?

1086
01:46:20,753 --> 01:46:23,085
so you think whatever
I did that night..

1087
01:46:23,189 --> 01:46:25,054
was because I hated you?

1088
01:46:28,127 --> 01:46:31,290
I couldn't live with
you or without you

1089
01:46:35,868 --> 01:46:38,666
you could've taken me along -as
if you wouId've come happily?

1090
01:46:41,107 --> 01:46:42,404
you could've abducted me..

1091
01:46:42,775 --> 01:46:43,901
abducted you?

1092
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:46,869
you're my wife, godammit!

1093
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,841
you should've come
along on your own

1094
01:46:52,251 --> 01:46:53,741
come on now, let's go..

1095
01:46:53,853 --> 01:46:56,083
we'll go, we'll go together

1096
01:46:59,392 --> 01:47:01,087
my emperor and his queen

1097
01:47:01,661 --> 01:47:03,925
will be buried in this
