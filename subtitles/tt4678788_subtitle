00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,371
Greetings doctor
MBRHDRG

3
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,246
- Park the car
- Okay

4
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,577
- Vijayan, what happened?
- Priya, flat is locked

5
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:37,375
I enquired with all the neighbouring
flat people about Jai Mohan

6
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,310
No one knows anything about him

7
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,970
One minute
I'll come just now

8
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,741
The surprising thing is that
not even the next neighbour...

9
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,076
...has been informed
about the marriage

10
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,204
The flat is locked
No one is there

11
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,547
- What happened, Priya?
- He is not in the flat

12
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,408
I got Vijayan to enquire in the flat

13
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,002
When he asked
the neighbouring flat lady...

14
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,206
...they don't even know
about such a marriage

15
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,043
Watchman saw him going
out late in the night

16
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,211
Did you call him?

17
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,473
It is switched off
or else not reachable

18
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:18,206
- I don't know, Priya
- May be some accident-

19
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,543
In that case someone next to
him is sure to pick up the call

20
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,242
You try to contact one more time

21
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,971
'The number you have
called is currently switched off'

22
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,210
Dear, did this Jai Mohan of yours
duck out at the last moment?

23
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:53,147
No, my Jai is not
that type of a person

24
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,479
Listen! I didn't order anything
Do you understand?

25
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,546
Bad! Now also you
expect him to arrive, isn't it?

26
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,273
If there had been any marks on
my face, I would have torn...

27
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:26,608
...your face to pieces and grinded it

28
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,446
After bath he is taking rest

29
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,171
Seize all the belongings in the room

30
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,243
Go and get ready soon
You are getting late for marriage

31
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:27,147
Dr Menon pampered and
spoilt his only daughter

32
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,238
I agreed to whatever you asked
Including this marriage

33
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,246
That is how everyone is
making fun of this daddy

34
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,213
You selected him yourself
It was not that I liked him

35
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,773
But I thought let
your wish get fulfilled

36
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,975
I also had choices!

37
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,537
To run my chain of hospitals
a capable doctor

38
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,705
Or else a business man who
has the capacity to run that

39
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,249
But my daughter's
choice was Jai Mohan

40
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,602
For whom it is
a second marriage

41
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,179
A divorcee

42
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,709
No family and friends

43
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,713
On asking about his occupation...

44
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,338
...in a lousy exporting company
he is an executive manager

45
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:13,376
I always felt that you
are making a mistake

46
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,580
Yes, a very big mistake
Again the same mistake

47
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,340
Now you have repeated it

48
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,443
I was felt happy when your first wife
took divorce from you...

49
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,604
...within 6 months of
the marriage and left you

50
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,182
I was that much happy
Jai, marriage won't work for you

51
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,303
Sir, what is this?

52
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,244
You are not a marriage material

53
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,975
Jai, you are my best agent, that is it

54
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,444
That is the only thing

55
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:48,678
If wife asks about husband's job,
you have to only lie

56
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:53,580
You'll have to always lie
That is what your fate is

57
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:58,137
Yes, dad
I thought well and decided

58
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:01,237
As you all think I didn't want
a husband with an high level job...

59
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,710
...too many ambitions

60
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,680
I have not thought about
a person like that even in my heart

61
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,771
I want to live with a man
of my liking, that's all

62
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,274
Then where is he now?

63
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:15,112
Dad, Jai will come
I'm sure about it

64
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,573
If you go quickly, you can reach
for your marriage on time

65
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,341
How much ever strongly you may say,
I'm unable to believe it

66
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,279
When the invitees mock at me
I don't know what I should tell them

67
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,606
You put me to such a shame

68
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,547
Now I'll go and tell everyone

69
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:47,739
The groom has ducked out
The marriage has been cancelled

70
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,107
For the shame I brought over,
I'll say sorry to everyone

71
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,542
Am I a bit late?

72
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,701
Actually...

73
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,004
It is a big story

74
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,104
Tell me what happened

75
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,374
As today is our marriage
I was really excited

76
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,413
I couldn't sleep a wink
yesterday night

77
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,339
I phoned you
so many times

78
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,642
You didn't attend even a single call
when you say you didn't sleep a wink

79
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,507
I'll tell you

80
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,341
Maybe I left my phone
in silent mode

81
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,143
You!

82
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,371
Do you need only him?

83
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,435

your life with

00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,507
Promise?

actually happened?

86
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,207
Yesterday night in sleep
I saw a dream

87
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,644
In that dream the minute
when we saw for the first time

88

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,375
Are you still in close
terms with your wife?

177
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,674
I'll hit you

178
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:24,374
Do you still love
Nafeesa Thatha?

179
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,537
Yes

180
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:30,606
Still after 31 years of our marriage
I love my wife a lot

181
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:44,680
In these 31 years have you
told your wife the truth?

182
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:47,772
This searching for terrorists,
searching them and shooting them

183
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:51,743
Have you told your loving
wife about your true profession?

184
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,302
How can I tell her?

185
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:56,780
When the marriage took place I was
working in Delhi in Raw special unit

186
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,980
How can I tell about
my job that time?

187
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,206
I must not tell also

188
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,306
In my family everybody thinks that in
this export company I'm a senior manager

189
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,378
Workaholic

190
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:08,777
My wife will go
and tell everyone that

191
00:29:09,034 --> 00:29:12,504
...God in the name of work,
here a man will die

192
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:16,140
Now it is 31 years to our marriage

193
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:22,147
So yourself conscience
is pricking you from inside...

194
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,235
...for not telling
the truth to your wife

195
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,142
Yes, Jai

196
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,511
In life if there is a law that says
till the end we can't tell anyone outside...

197
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,978
...it can't be erased at all

198
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:31,569
But in your matter
it is not like that

199
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:34,512
Because your first wife
divorced you and went away

200
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:40,473
For her money, career, life
style and looks were more important

201
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:45,073
Yes, sir! Money, career,
life style, that's all

202
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,180
That is what was
needed to Ramya

203
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,472
- Don't stop me
- Please

204
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:57,605
I don't know what you are
expecting from this life of ours

205
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:02,047
Whatever it may be, but
what I'm expecting is surely not that

206
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,606
In our case you are still the same
There is no change at all

207
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,579
The job in your export
company is your first wife

208
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,307
I was the one who was a fool
I was, but not now

209
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,505
Jai, this day when I'm going
away from your life is...

210
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,613
...the most beautiful day of my life

211
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,770
Bye and take care

212
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,035
We lived together for 6 months

213
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:38,206
And then she left me
and migrated to Canada

214
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,272
But Anjali is not like Ramya

215
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:45,678
Anjali is a sweet girl and
madly in love with you

216
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,472
But at the same time you are
going to get both good luck...

217
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:56,777
...and bad luck, MrJai Mohan
by your second wife-

218
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,708
Sir, please
Let me come to the matter

219
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:18,245
In the many terror attacks that took
place in India, he was prime suspect

220
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:23,511
If such a suspect has been caught in
Bangalore, it is not a coincidence

221
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,138
That too when important events
are going to take place here

222
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:30,371
Prime Minister's visit
Islamic peace conference

223
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:34,677
India vs England cricket match
Rana has planned something

224
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,540
Sir, did Rana say something?

225
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,771
Till now Rana has not said anything

226
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,473
Wish you a happy married life, sir!

227
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,069
No...no

228
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,547
How to say in Malayalam?

229
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,681
My good wishes for
your married life, right?

230
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,644
I know 9 languages

231
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:43,543
Didn't you like this Malayalam, sir?

232
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:47,014
When two Malayalee's
meet it can be seen

233
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,408
How do we know?

234
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,348
Asking whether he is a Malayalee
you come running and hug

235
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,277
All you Mallu people

236
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,410
Victor Rana, bloody beggar

237
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:59,037
After this not only in Malayalam...

238
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,138
...even if you catch hold of someone
in capital, no one will come here

239
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,304
Do you understand?

240
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:07,008
So the 9 languages that you
have studied is of no use here

241
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,143
No one will come to know that you
are caught and put in this cage here

242
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,076
Not even the Prime
Minister of this country

243
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:17,047
Even if you die and rotten here,
no one will come to know

244
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:20,510
No one can save you
Unless some miracle saves you

245
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,273
I have planned something

246
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,609
If they have got to be
stopped from happening...

247
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,304
...only miracle has to take place

248
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:30,345
Do you understand?

249
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:53,010
I called you to ask what I
should cook for dinner

250
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:57,782
I have got with me
mother's recipe book

251
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,277
Whatever special dish
you need, tell me

252
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:04,109
Nothing like that
Anything will do

253
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,171
- Do you like veg roll, Jai?
-Yes...yes

254
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:11,044
- Bengun bhanha?
- Okay

255
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:15,542
What about Bengun Masala?

256
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,638
- By mixing masala in brinjal
-Anything, sweety

257
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,374
Whatever you prepare
is good for me

258
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,374
Okay, listen
I'm busy in work at present

259
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:27,539
I'll call you later on
Okay? Okay

260
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:38,782
You have put me in prison here
This Victor Rana

261
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:42,776
But it is not me who is going
through the torture, it is you

262
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,044
- Are you a Malayali?
-Yes

263
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,670
- Are you new here?
-Yes

264
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,543
- In which flat?
-306

265
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,342
- Jai's...?
-Yes, I'm Jai's wife

266
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,641
That is good
When did this take place?

267
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,274
Did Jai get married for the second time?
Without any of our knowledge?

268
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,074
Everything was quick

269
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,377
Sir, this was what
collected from Rana's room

270
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:59,037
Apart from his bag and cloths

271
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,240
No, sir

272
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,248
As we know no one here
uses cellphone and laptop

273
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,304
That will lead to their
boss across the border

274
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,971
If we have to get the root
of the net used by him...

275
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:17,574
...see if there is any net cafe
near by the hotel where he stayed

276
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,045
We must sniff there

277
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:25,378
Your cellphone has just
received a text from your wife

278
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,241
From wife
Message

279
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:32,404
Go ahead

280
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:51,579
This is going to be your life
most dangerous under cover mission

281
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,975
Yes, sir
Rana

282
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:54,980
Not Rana
Rani (Queen)

283
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:57,412
YourAnjali
Your marriage

284
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:12,580
If you open this door,
I'll come inside and tell you in detail

285
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,576
- Is it for me?
-Come

286
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:22,514
I moved the couch
from here to guest room

287
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,569
Then dining to this side

288
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:26,770
Then our TV

289
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:30,504
I set that to that corner
Then some of your awful paintings

290
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:33,343
I gave that to
the sweeper to get rid

291
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,310
if you continue like this,
you'll discard me also...

292
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:40,075
...and make that old sweeper
in the downstairs stay here

293
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,205
- Okay, I'll see
- Let me see

294
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,542
Listen, now you are not
single and a bachelor

295
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,238
There is one more
person with you

296
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,109
- I got used to be single
- Come...come

297
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,040
I prayed and prepared all this thinking
this fat guy should be really hungry

298
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:18,307
Really? Else I'll bite and eat you

299
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,540
- How is it?
- Super, fantastic, amazing

300
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,376
But you didn't taste at all
Are you making fun of me?

301
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:28,969
Then I'll eat and
tell you, come

302
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:31,674
No, you are so mean
I made all this with so much love

303
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:33,680
And you are just
making fun of me

304
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,710
What happened?
Didn't you like?

305
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:45,207
It can be good
If you wish, it can be better

306
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,210
What?

307
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:49,077
Let me taste and
see all these

308
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,479
What happened, Jai?
Didn't you like my cooking?

309
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:06,710
If you ask me whether I have eaten
such a tasty food before this, no

310
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:09,375
Haven't you heard?

311
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:14,713
I wish to kiss those fingers
which cooked such wonderful food

312
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:20,072
No need for Hollywood style love

313
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,408
Today it'll be Hollywood style

314
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,178
- Hello!
-Jai, what are you doing?

315
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:39,274
I have not done
anything till now, sir

316
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:42,075
Okay, you need not do anything
You come immediately

317
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,248
We have found the internet cafe
which used by Rana

318
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:49,439
You come here immediately

319
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,381
There is an emergency in office

320
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,041
I'll go soon and
come back soon

321
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:12,209
Jai, in export company what
emergency is there at night?

322
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:15,714
One of the company's ships was
picked and dropped by crow in the sea

323
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,677
I'll swim, find that and come

324
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:43,106
This is Rana's ID proof
Copy of the passport

325
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,505
In this the name is JameerAhmed

326
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,775
Then the details of his net log
in which he has done many days

327
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:52,674
That is the computer which was
used by Rana on the last day

328
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,173
Interestingly he used
the same terminal every time

329
00:40:57,634 --> 00:41:00,114
He won't have left
anything to crash and enter

330
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,508
He must have wiped out everything

331
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:04,980
You are absolutely right, sir
Everything has been wiped out

332
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:08,480
Browsers, cash files, book marks,
history and everything

333
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:12,613
Afile that was attached to e-mail and
sent by Rana, I managed to track that, sir

334
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,202
But it is password protected

335
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:18,079
With your database experience
we must try something

336
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,338
Let me check it out

337
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:12,645
What is this?

338
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,306
Now did you see
that small boy pissing?

339
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,710
A visually innocent photo

340
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,646
When we open the cover and remove
the knots of that photo we'll know

341
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,445
The secret message to kill whom
all is hidden in that by Rana

342
00:42:24,534 --> 00:42:25,444
- Christy!
- Sir

343
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,480
Try to decode this code

344
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,509
Cupid's arrow

345
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,611
What is the love God
called in 5 letters?

346
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,701
Lover

347
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,009
You are too good, baby

348
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:26,740
- I know
- Lover

349
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:34,440
Jai, shall I ask you one thing?

350
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:35,706
Ask me

351
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:39,109
What does it mean by
export executive?

352
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,639
What is your real job?

353
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,507
Before this you have not asked
anything to me like this

354
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:52,171
Now what happened suddenly?

355
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:56,238
Shouldn't wives know
about husband's job?

356
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,677
What do you mean by wives?

357
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:59,611
Do I have another
wife other than you?

358
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:01,442
Jai, tell me

359
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,104
If I must say correctly,
it is a bit complicated

360
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,703
Jai, tell me please

361
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:09,179
lfl say it simplicatedly

362
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:10,769
okay

363
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,278
In this Indian country there
are lying many unwanted things

364
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:16,745
Useless commodities

365
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,604
I must enquire and find that

366
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,442
And then to export that is my job

367
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,239
What do you mean by
useless commodities?

368
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:25,507
Is it our dirty politicians?

369
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:32,380
At night when everything is
over and we are lying awake...

370
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:34,539
...I'll tell in your ears in detail

371
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:42,281
'For you good luck and
bad luck is going to come...'

372
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:45,110
'...at the same time due
to your second wife'

373
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:11,439
On decoding that image
the message that I got is this, sir

374
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,411
It seems to be meaningless

375
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,637
I think I know what it means

376
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:19,441
Sir, this is a simple Chinese grid

377
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,710
It'll rearrange itself
and you'll read like this

378
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,472
AYES HA?

379
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,145
- Do you have any idea, Jai?
- Sir, birthday candles

380
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:02,440
Candles can mean weapons

381
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,673
AYESHA...who the hell is she?

382
00:46:04,734 --> 00:46:07,010
She might be a terrorist
contact in the city, sir

383
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,446
Otherwise it could be the person who
takes delivery of the weapons here

384
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:17,775
- You pick up the call please
- Thank you, sir

385
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,408
We are all talking
about National Security

386
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,777
I think sir must be having
a bigger problem at home

387
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,638
Please go ahead

388
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,071
- Sir, my wife-
- Please

389
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,373
Thank you

390
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,702
- Hello!
- Hi, Jai!

391
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:40,072
While coming from office
can you get me some Zucchini?

392
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:41,575
What was that?

393
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,705
Zucchini yaar
Zucchini

394
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:51,040
Sir, can we continue the meeting?

395
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,179
Whoever or wherever
this Ayesha might be

396
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:00,407
Ourmainjob is to
trace her out

397
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,342
Zucchini

398
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,779
But it is not an easy thing
Our first move should be

399
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,479
- Zucchini
-What?

400
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:10,778
- Zucchini any idea?
- No, sir I don't know

401
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:15,240
Leave your Zucchini
Look at Ayesha

402
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:17,411
Sorry, sir

403
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,535
AVesha!

404
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:19,704
Yes, Ayes ha

405
00:47:20,334 --> 00:47:22,075
Yes, of course

406
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:26,274
I knowAyesha
I have a crush over her

407
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,344
I have seen all her movies

408
00:47:29,434 --> 00:47:32,347
But I didn't get

409
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,038
She got married
and went away

410
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,271
Don't screw on me, Rana

411
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:40,280
It is not Ayesha Takia
It is Ayesha

412
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:41,108
No

413
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:42,578
I'll kill you

414
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:44,613
You are wasting
your time with me

415
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:45,771
Okay boss

416
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,104
Christy, from his hotel room
the evidences that we seized

417
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,702
I want to see one more time

418
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,775
What are you
searching inside that?

419
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,104
I don't know, sir

420
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,077
May be this thing
This might help

421
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,773
This is not one but the bill
of two people having coffee

422
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:28,605
Rana met somebody
in this coffee shop

423
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:34,608
Have you not seen?

424
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:48,212
This man...he was not glamorous
enough to keep in memory, sir

425
00:48:48,267 --> 00:48:52,545
But the girl who used to
come with him here regularly

426
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:59,308
if shejust looks at us, we won't-

427
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,472
We won't know what we should do

428
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:02,307
Sir!

429
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:03,675
I think he knows something

430
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:08,978
If she goes from our front,
we can't take off our eyes

431
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,238
- From her back, isn't it?
-Yes, we can't

432
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,606
Come, talk to sir

433
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:17,043
Have you also seen with him?

434
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:20,047
Yes, sir I have also seen

435
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:21,205
Then?

436
00:49:21,267 --> 00:49:25,113
When I used to see her with him,
I used to be really jealous of him

437
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:29,411
That is why I have kept him in
my mind without forgetting him

438
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:34,348
Zulfi, you go to the room
and have bath in cold water

439
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,080
There are three CCTV cameras here

440
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,302
- Yes, sir
- Take the visuals and check it

441
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,105
Yes sir

442
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:51,547
That friend of Rana who is hotter than
the coffee here, shouldn't we see her?

443
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,772
Yes sir, sure

444
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:35,538
- Is this Ayesha?
-I can't say for sure

445
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:50,605
Zucchini is not needed

446
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,113
I was about to go to
the shop to get Zucchini for you

447
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,647
- Are you sure you don't want it?
- Today's cooking is cancelled here

448
00:50:57,734 --> 00:51:00,237
Is it only cooking or...

449
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:03,606
Jai, do you remember
Nambiyar uncle?

450
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:04,668
Daddy's close friend

451
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,044
Is he daddy's close friend?
Surely he must be a big bore

452
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,471
Jai, listen me

453
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,605
Today evening there is
a party from Nam biyar's side

454
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:13,737
We have to go

455
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:16,439
Very bad

456
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,175
Couldn't you have told me
earlier about Nambiyar uncle?

457
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:22,440
Jai, please
Don't say as no

458
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,640
Meena, that Patel's dealing
Why there is a delay?

459
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,179
Have you done with it?

460
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:29,305
To who else I must
tell in this office?

461
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:33,707
Dear, sorry

462
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,078
I'm very busy in the office

463
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:43,379
But even if I don't come, you must
go for Nambiyar uncle's party

464
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,038
Now itself people are asking...

465
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,240
Why we couldn't go even for
a honey moon that you are so busy?

466
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,109
That too in that
lousy export company

467
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:54,610
Jai, please

468
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,112
Don't put me to shame
in front of others at least today

469
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:00,637
You do one thing
You go directly to the party

470
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:02,543
I'll try my maximum to come

471
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:04,613
If by chancel don't come...

472
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:10,242
You stay with daddy today and tell
daddy to drop you early morning

473
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:11,335
What do you say?

474
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,638
Nonsense

475
00:52:18,267 --> 00:52:19,712
What happened, sir?

476
00:52:21,434 --> 00:52:22,538
Nonsense

477
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:48,468
Dear!

478
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,274
Didn't you go to the party?

479
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,507
If I had gone, would I be
standing here like a tree?

480
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,103
Why didn't you Q0?

481
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,202
Nam biyar uncle must have
really felt bad

482
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,077
Then your daddy
He must have expected you a lot

483
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:02,169
How concerned you
are about them?

484
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:04,611
It is your Nambiyar uncle
and our daddy

485
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:05,975
Stop this drama, Jai

486
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:08,013
If you had wanted, you
could have come earlier

487
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:10,547
Actually what happened
today is a story

488
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,273
Stop these false stories, Jai

489
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:13,779
It is not just like that I didn't go

490
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,344
Who'll understand about my
husband's busy schedule there?

491
00:53:16,434 --> 00:53:18,209
Is this export executive

492
00:53:18,267 --> 00:53:21,077
American President to keep
this whole world on his head?

493
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:22,340
Dear...!

494
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:26,074
On showing white flag
you shouldn't lift weapon

495
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:28,679
Even Pakistan people
won't do that

496
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,578
After this even if we are invited to
Nam biyar sir's dog's birthday, we'll go

497
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:36,677
okay

498
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:39,145
- Fine what is the plan?
- Plan?

499
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,304
Plan what?

500
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:44,611
- We'll go out and have dinner
- That is not a concession

501
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,373
- There is no other alternative
-Why?

502
00:53:46,434 --> 00:53:48,539
Becausel have not
prepared any food here

503
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,206
I'll become fresh and
come immediately

504
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:08,675
"On the sand of the back
water bed when sunsets"

505
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:10,510
Enough
Stop it

506
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,137
I'm fed up of this song

507
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,645
Have you not left that till now?

508
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,475
I told you that I didn't do
it purposely it happened

509
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:19,035
For that should I hold your feet?

510
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,044
No need

511
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,081
But when you say sorry,
don't say it as a charity

512
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,204
What do you want now?
I'll do that

513
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:27,110
You drive fast
I want to eat

514
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:37,374
What do you want to eat?

515
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:44,437
There is not an item
called 'Anything' here

516
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:45,704
What?

517
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:47,371
I'll go to rest room and come

518
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:49,413
When I come,
the food should be here

519
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:50,969
Do you understand?

520
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:58,140
- Bearer!
-Yes, sir

521
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,706
As soon as that sister comes,
you serve the food

522
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,411
- As soon as she arrives
- Sir

523
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,411
- Swing into action
- Sure, sir-

524
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:27,678
With love, Jai

525
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,070
Perfect

526
00:55:35,434 --> 00:55:36,606
Hi, Jai Mohan!

527
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,338
How come you are here?

528
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,346
- I thought you are in Canada
-I was in Canada

529
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,539
Day before yesterday
onlyl reached Bangalore

530
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,242
What is all this?

531
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:02,976
Candles Roses
What is this, Jai Mohan?

532
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:05,542
Who is in company
with you for dinner?

533
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:06,339
Nothing

534
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,006
- Shall I take the seat?
- She will be

535
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:21,409
"Every night in my dreams
I see you I feel you"

536
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:22,707
How sweet!

537
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:26,343
I never expected that
you'll remember me all these while

538
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:28,209
Ramya, actually

539
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:29,302
No, Jai

540
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:30,573
Come on

541
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,408
I can't believe this

542
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:34,611
I'm so excited

543
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,473
What?

544
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:47,508
This is Ramya

545
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:53,205
I am Jai's

546
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:54,975
I know

547
00:56:56,433 --> 00:56:58,106
You can introduce me to her

548
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,147
Anjali, my wife

549
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,233
Jai, did you get married again?

550
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:08,114
Is there any rule that
Jai can't marry again?

551
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,440
Not that

552
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:11,110
Jai Mohan

553
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:14,104
Doesn't he have
the eligibility for that?

554
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,042
- If you ask like that, yes
- Ramya, come on

555
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,045
Ramya, was it only my mistake?

556
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,512
You could have given me
some more time

557
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,611
I didn't mean like that

558
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,671
Both of you have lot of
time still for compromise

559
00:57:30,734 --> 00:57:33,078
- Bye, Ramya
- Dear, please

560
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:35,647
You can compromise on all
your old problems and then come

561
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,476
I don't know anything
She appeared suddenly

562
00:57:38,534 --> 00:57:39,740
Enjoy your dinner

563
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,976
In future never enter
my life like this

564
00:57:53,734 --> 00:57:57,011
Dear please listen

565
00:57:57,067 --> 00:57:59,069
- Regret Gateway
- Okay, mad am

566
00:58:26,033 --> 00:58:29,776
- Why are you taking this route?
- This is short cut, madam

567
00:58:42,534 --> 00:58:44,036
Shiva, come here

568
00:58:46,267 --> 00:58:47,541
One minute, madam

569
00:58:47,634 --> 00:58:51,241
Driver, take me fast
Else I'll call police

570
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,405
You can call the police

571
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,535
See here

572
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,774
Here no police will come
It is our place

573
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,202
Where are you going?

574
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,404
Catch hold of her

575
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,443
Don't let her go

576
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:10,041
Heymstop

577
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,537
Our car has been parked
in that corner

578
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,341
Quietly you go and sit in that

579
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,639
I don't like anyone else
other than me chasing my wife

580
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:01,705
I'm going to ask them
decently to return my wife's purse

581
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,007
Instead of that I'm not
going to hurt them

582
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:06,308
They will hurt you,
They are bad people

583
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,149
You go and sit in the car
Count slowly till 15

584
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,338
- Even after that if I don't come
- If you don't come?

585
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,347
You drive the car fast
and call the police

586
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,712
If you want to remain alive,
run away from here

587
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:57,713
Else I'll chop you to pieces

588
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,373
Kill him

589
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,006
Here

590
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,769
- After today
-Yes, sir

591
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,504
If you trouble any
lonely girl on the way

592
01:02:30,733 --> 01:02:32,974
I'll become your problem

593
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:34,137
Yes, sir

594
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:36,339
Do you understand?

595
01:02:47,634 --> 01:02:50,171
How did you get this?
What did you tell them?

596
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:54,546
I told them that she is my wife
Anjali, it is her purse

597
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:58,410
Give it back to me as
I have to make her happy

598
01:03:33,033 --> 01:03:36,173
What is yourJai saying?
Where did you go for honeymoon?

599
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:37,007
Nowhere

600
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:39,479
Jai is very busy, so we thought
we'll go next month

601
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,241
What busy?

602
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:43,678
That too in an
ordinary export company

603
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:47,307
We know that earth is not rotating
on the nose tip of Deccan Exports

604
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:51,747
But the way Jai behaves you'll feel
as if he is in intensive care unit

605
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,710
I agree

606
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:54,644
Are you happy?
That is enough

607
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:58,107
But there is only one problem

608
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,443
As soon as he returns from
office he'll see whether...

609
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,003
...all the TV remote
buttons are working properly?

610
01:04:03,067 --> 01:04:04,045
Why?

611
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:05,312
Dumb girl!

612
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:09,008
Without minding me he'll change
and keep seeing all the news channels

613
01:04:10,367 --> 01:04:13,314
But I really love this, Priya
This role of a wife

614
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:17,247
Cooking food forJai
washing and ironing Jai's clothes

615
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:19,280
Then in-between fighting with him

616
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,074
I'm happy TOT V°u

617
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,774
But it is not enough if you remain at
home washing clothes and cooking food

618
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:26,672
Come back to work
Seriously

619
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:29,180
In your daddy's office
we all miss you

620
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:36,710
Is this Ayesha?

621
01:04:38,034 --> 01:04:39,206
This is not Ayesha

622
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:40,571
It is Laila

623
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,669
- That is what her name is
- Laila

624
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,276
Here in the 'Chacha' club
she is performing now

625
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:50,179
Recently she has done an
item number in a Tamil movie

626
01:04:50,467 --> 01:04:54,176
But she didn't succeed Laila
didn't have any flex and licks

627
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:55,304
sorry

628
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,404
No luck in flex

629
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:01,543
But Laila knows Tamil
Little bit

630
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:03,645
Does she know Tamil?

631
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,307
How does she look, sir?

632
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:16,715
Even if I behave naughtily with her and
my wife comes to know, it is not wrong

633
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,508
- Shall I put inside?
-What?

634
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,637
I meant shall I arrest her

635
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,475
We can do the interrogation in jail

636
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:24,238
Fool!

637
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,770
We can't put her in lock up
just like that for questioning

638
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:33,216
Laila is the only clue between
this terror plan and us

639
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,412
Look here, no mistake
must take place

640
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,303
We must handle her with utmost care

641
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:40,710
- Do you understand?
- Sir

642
01:05:43,034 --> 01:05:46,072
If we arrest her now and
come to know later...

643
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,647
...there is no connection between
that girl and terror plan

644
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,704
...that'll become a big
controversy in media and public

645
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,606
This was sent by your wife to
the office through a boy in the flat

646
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,978
'From today bye bye
to junk foods'

647
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:17,547
'Without failing I'll send
daily lunch box in the afternoon'

648
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,637
'With lots of love'

649
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:25,507
Jai, after marriage
everyone becomes fat

650
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,273
But bachelors are not like that

651
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,573
Do you know why?

652
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:41,177
"Oh Kindness Oh kindness"

653
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,474
"Laila Oh Laila"

654
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,474
"The poet called Majnu
is doing poetry on me"

655
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:58,511
"Oh Laila"

656

"Who is my special man he
has written in the diary"

657
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:07,710
"Laila Oh Laila
Laila Oh Laila"

658
01:07:08,134 --> 01:07:13,015
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

659
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:22,484
"Oh Kindness
Oh kindness"

660
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:27,867


661
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,746
"I'm brighter than stars and moon"

662
01:07:53,134 --> 01:07:59,244
"I'm the most desirable
woman in this world"

663
01:07:59,334 --> 01:08:04,306
"My beauty is one that
can create ecstasy"

664
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:11,443
"I'm such a Laila who
troubles all the men around"

665
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:18,144
"Oh my man, you are
the craziest lover of mine"

666
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:26,278
"Oh Kindness
Oh kindness"

667
01:08:30,633 --> 01:08:35,776
"The poet called Majnu
is doing poetry on me"

668
01:08:36,034 --> 01:08:36,739
"Oh Laila"

669
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:42,045
"Who is my special man he
has written in the diary"

670
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,378
"Laila Oh Laila
Laila Oh Laila"

671
01:08:48,567 --> 01:08:52,572
"Laila Oh Laila"

672
01:08:52,767 --> 01:09:00,242


673
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:02,974
Hey!
That flower is mine

674
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:07,706
- Excuse me!
-Yes

675
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:13,379
- Who are you?
- Laila, for you

676
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,981
Are you returning
my own flower to me?

677
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:22,546
You are smart

678
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,137
When Victor told me,
I didn't think that you'll be so superb

679
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,511
You know little bit Tamil
That is what Victor told me about you

680
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:30,569
- Are you Victor's friend?
- Victor's friend!

681
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:31,407
No...no

682
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:32,537
Not at all

683
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,412
He is not my friend
He is like my brother

684
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,410
See this

685
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,705
That is my name

686
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:44,543
- Deccan Exports
- My company's name

687
01:09:45,234 --> 01:09:46,611
We are in the exports

688
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:50,513
But now we want to
get into film production

689
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,170
- Really?
-Yes, really

690
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:54,646
Hindi, Tamil,
bilingual film

691
01:09:55,134 --> 01:09:56,738
The name of
the movie is 'Devi'

692
01:09:57,001 --> 01:09:59,140
A very strong lady character

693
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,440
Devika

694
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,210
You were famous for sex talk,
exposure, you know

695
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:10,308
Who is doing the title
role of Devika?

696
01:10:10,634 --> 01:10:12,136
We were searching

697
01:10:12,234 --> 01:10:17,047
But after meeting you, Laila

698
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:19,410
Didn't Victor tell you
anything about me?

699
01:10:19,467 --> 01:10:21,674
You know Victor
He is like that only

700
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:23,680
He is full of secrets
and surprises

701
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:28,978
But you are so beautiful
You must act in films

702
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:30,705
You must act

703
01:10:34,634 --> 01:10:36,511
This is my address

704
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,613
Shobha Lavender

705
01:10:48,067 --> 01:10:51,139
We'll discuss about movies there

706
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:17,177
After searching all over Deccan Exports
you couldn't get a pen

707
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:19,674
But you got lip stick easily, isn't it?

708
01:11:20,634 --> 01:11:21,635
TRUE

709
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:23,474
This is what I also thought

710
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:26,776
On searching urgently, I didn't
get pen, but I got lipstick

711
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:28,605
That is the joke

712
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:30,044
- Here
-Yes

713
01:11:30,467 --> 01:11:31,969
Whose address is this?

714
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:33,308
That is Lai-

715
01:11:34,434 --> 01:11:37,506
It is a client's address
Shipping line client

716
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:43,408
Why your client
drawn heart in this?

717
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,413
It is simple

718
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,311
That client must
be a heart patient

719
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,071
What?

720
01:11:49,134 --> 01:11:50,374
May be he is

721
01:11:50,467 --> 01:11:53,607
We will believe that
client is a heart patient

722
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:30,074
Why did you come late today?

723
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:34,344
Where were you today evening?

724
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:36,436
I had gone to zoo Zoo

725
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:38,012
God!

726
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:39,239
Tell the truth, Jai

727
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:41,747
Today evening when I called
your office, your receptionist...

728
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,604
...told me that you had left early

729
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:46,071
Did she say like that?
She is crazy

730
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:50,146
Do you employ crazy
people in Deccan Exports?

731
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:52,180
Not all are crazy
But she is crazy

732
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,737
The day we got married
her craziness started

733
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,671
- Are you having an affair?
-Yes, I do have

734
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:00,974
With whom?

735
01:13:01,134 --> 01:13:02,078
Tell me

736
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,180
- Who is she?
- Shall I tell you?

737
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:08,307
With this Anjali

738
01:13:18,434 --> 01:13:21,074
I thought it is lady servant

739
01:13:21,134 --> 01:13:21,703
No

740
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:29,246
You sit down

741
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,780
For a minute
I'll change and come

742
01:13:32,034 --> 01:13:32,978
okay

743
01:13:52,734 --> 01:13:53,735
God!

744
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,242
Will it be too long?
Your story narration

745
01:14:04,067 --> 01:14:05,740
Yes!
It depends

746
01:14:11,234 --> 01:14:17,617
Don't you know how difficult it
is to be such a beautiful woman?

747
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:19,112
Don't you know?

748
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:22,546
How can I remain quiet after
seeing such a beautiful girl like you?

749
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:26,276
You don't know how much
trouble you are giving to a man

750
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:27,744
Is it so?

751
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,340
I feel hungry

752
01:14:30,434 --> 01:14:32,710
- I'm hungry
- I'm married

753
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:35,304
If you are married,
won't you feel hungry?

754
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:42,480
If I tell that now,
the story will get changed

755
01:14:45,201 --> 01:14:46,578
That is my servant

756
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:49,511
If I don't open the door,
she'll come later on

757
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:50,739
I have to leave

758
01:14:52,267 --> 01:14:55,544
How sad!
And what about the story?

759
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,637
Shall I narrate
the story tomorrow?

760
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,771
- Tomorrow we'll meet for lunch
- Okay

761
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:02,139
Venue you decide

762
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:05,004
Menu I'll tell

763
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,504
Then...

764
01:15:09,467 --> 01:15:11,378
Okay, bye
Enough

765
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:32,575
Jai, what did your Laila say?

766
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,704
She didn't bite and
tear me, that's all

767
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,610
- My BP shooted up
- Tell me what happened

768
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:40,341
Nothing happened, sir
But it would have happened

769
01:15:40,434 --> 01:15:42,277
I got saved as the servant came

770
01:15:47,701 --> 01:15:51,547
In this kind of situations you are sure
to feel regretted for getting married

771
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,671
- No, I won't regret
-You'll regret

772
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:55,178
Even if not now

773
01:15:55,234 --> 01:15:58,374
All the married men
do regret in the future

774
01:15:58,434 --> 01:16:00,573
It is only future
We'll see later on

775
01:16:00,634 --> 01:16:02,705
Jai, shall we eat
something on the way?

776
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,074
Okay, we'll

777
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:18,073
- Didn't you eat lunch today?
- God! I forgot

778
01:16:18,134 --> 01:16:21,411
- How can you forget lunch?
-As I had lot of work, I forgot

779
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,776
I'll become fresh and come
We'll have dinner together

780
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,310
I also prepared lunch
taking lot of trouble

781
01:16:26,367 --> 01:16:29,314
Today I'll heat up only that
lunch and give you for dinner

782
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:31,677
If you had given without telling,
I would have eaten it

783
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:32,542
You spoilt it

784
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,740
Go

785
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,171
Ladies perfume smell

786
01:17:01,467 --> 01:17:06,382
Two chickens, two fried rice

787
01:17:08,534 --> 01:17:10,172
Sprite

788
01:17:12,434 --> 01:17:13,572
Liar!

789
01:17:34,434 --> 01:17:38,041
I need a word
A process against natural law

790
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,707
A process against natural law
It is a seven letter word

791
01:17:41,801 --> 01:17:43,371
Is that it?

792
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:45,174
What is there to
think so much in that?

793
01:17:45,267 --> 01:17:46,405
- Husband
- Oh no!

794
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:50,472
Okay, I got it
It is miracle

795
01:17:50,567 --> 01:17:51,705
Miracle

796
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,773
Lunch today

797
01:18:08,034 --> 01:18:09,604
Sweety

798
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:15,274
I'll show you the lunch

799
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,539
Driver, follow that blue car

800
01:18:29,634 --> 01:18:31,136
Quick Fast

801
01:18:31,334 --> 01:18:35,282
Madam, that is BMW
This auto

802
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:37,644
On stepping over the gear
that'll fly like flight

803
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:40,578
How m uch ever I d rive fast,
I can't catch that, mad am

804
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:41,374
God!

805
01:18:41,434 --> 01:18:43,175
I'll give you as much
cash as you want

806
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:44,212
Go fast

807
01:18:44,534 --> 01:18:45,274
Is it so?

808
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:48,314
I'll go without giving
side on the road

809
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:49,345
Move

810
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:53,644
Madam, is that person
going in car your husband?

811
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:57,708
Is he weak in
ladies matter, madam?

812
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:59,269
Hey, no

813
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:01,673
You just drive fast

814
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:02,542
Go

815
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,410
I'll drive fast, madam
You be careful

816
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,504
Madam, what do you know?

817
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,776
So many wives are
following their husband

818
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,312
This is happening daily
I have seen so many like this

819
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,178
Water

820
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,480
Sir, we have a situation
in interrogation room

821
01:21:34,401 --> 01:21:36,039
Oh, no!

822
01:21:50,467 --> 01:21:52,970
- Christy, inform their families
-Yes, sir

823
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:56,537
In autopsy report the reason for
the death shouldn't come out

824
01:22:00,601 --> 01:22:02,137
Get down

825
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,302
Why are you covering
your face, madam?

826
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,343
Laila, it is lunchtime

827
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,504
See, madam

828
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,275
Nowa girl will
come out of that building

829
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:34,712
She'll go and stand in
front of your husband

830
01:22:34,767 --> 01:22:38,408
He'll pick her up in car and go
This is what will happen

831
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,770
Where are you?

832
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,105
See there
Didn't I say correctly?

833
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,779
I can't find you

834
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:53,472
Are you there?

835
01:22:53,534 --> 01:22:55,445
- Come...come
- I'm coming

836
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:59,573
Did you see, madam?
We'll follow them and go

837
01:22:59,667 --> 01:23:03,979
Already they must have
booked a room in a cheap lodge

838
01:23:04,034 --> 01:23:05,604
Shut up, idiot!

839
01:23:05,701 --> 01:23:09,046
I said only what will happen

840
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:33,610
As Laila has link with Rana...

841
01:23:33,734 --> 01:23:37,375
...he'll come straightly
only there for shelter

842
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:39,539
On seeing you there he'll escape

843
01:23:39,634 --> 01:23:41,409
You leave from there immediately

844
01:24:11,067 --> 01:24:12,774
- I had a small accident
- Oh my God!

845
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,240
Twist in the story

846
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,178
Come on

847
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,070
Oh my God!

848
01:25:34,534 --> 01:25:35,706
Who is he, Victor?

849
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,774
Lie down

850
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,570
Else your head
will get blown off

851
01:28:33,734 --> 01:28:34,542
Stop...stop

852
01:28:41,534 --> 01:28:43,673
Till now we have not got
both the bodies, sir

853
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:46,578
- There is lot of under current
- Search the entire area

854
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:49,706
Till you find the body
don't confirm the demise

855
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:16,343
Anjali, I don't know what to tell you
It is not as you are thinking

856
01:29:16,401 --> 01:29:17,641
What should I think?

857
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:21,581
With a lady and
that too with a gun in hand

858
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:27,174
Listen to me, Anjali

859
01:29:30,101 --> 01:29:31,546
Please, don't go

860
01:29:31,601 --> 01:29:33,581
lfl go, will you shoot me too?

861
01:29:33,767 --> 01:29:37,510
- You are my wife
- But you shot at that lady's husband

862
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:41,647
That is not her husband
He is no one

863
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,043
It is he

864
01:29:43,101 --> 01:29:45,581
It is he who started to shoot first

865
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:49,204
Don't talk like children childishly

866
01:29:49,267 --> 01:29:51,440
- Anjali, I want to tell you a truth
-What truth?

867
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,276
You are a rowdy
A gangster, isn't it that?

868
01:29:54,334 --> 01:29:57,315
If I go and ask in a police station,
I'll get that truth

869
01:29:57,367 --> 01:29:59,074
I'm not a gangster

870
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:03,479
I'm an idiot wife who came to
know very late that husband...

871
01:30:03,534 --> 01:30:05,241
...is a criminal who carries along gun

872
01:30:05,301 --> 01:30:06,575
Isn't that what I'm, Jai?

873
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:11,148
- What were you doing there?
- Is that a crime now?

874
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,646
This is a free country
Anyone can appear anywhere

875
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,704
Hey, tell me
How did you reach there?

876
01:30:16,767 --> 01:30:21,182
I followed you and came there
I was spying on you

877
01:30:28,467 --> 01:30:30,413
What my father told was right

878
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:34,441
This was a mistake
Our marriage

879
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:55,408
- Here

What?

914
01:36:06,001 --> 01:36:08,003
Did your wife leave you?

915
01:36:08,067 --> 01:36:10,308
The biggest problem is divorce...

916
01:36:10,367 --> 01:36:12,472
...is that we have to give
half the property, that's all

917
01:36:12,534 --> 01:36:14,275
She is my only property, sir

918
01:36:38,267 --> 01:36:40,338
We got both these
bodies yesterday night

919
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,113
Keeping the face
we couldn't identify anything

920
01:36:48,067 --> 01:36:51,276
Sir, send both the bodies
for DNA test

921
01:36:51,334 --> 01:36:55,077
We can't believe blindly
Rana is too clever, sir

922
01:37:03,334 --> 01:37:05,974
Sir, we got Laila's phone from the car

923
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:09,379
As it fell in water, the data recovery
is slightly difficult from that

924
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,744
Laila, without you I won't
keep this party on 23rd

925
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:28,345
Don't betray me, Please

926
01:37:34,667 --> 01:37:37,773
What important work you have
that you can't change the date?

927
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:41,512
Date, with whom?

928
01:37:42,734 --> 01:37:44,680
- Who?
-Ayesha

929
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:45,678
Ayes ha?

930
01:37:59,467 --> 01:38:01,640
Why not search Laila's flat, sir?

931
01:38:28,167 --> 01:38:31,705
- Jai, did you get anything?
- This is the clue

932
01:38:32,734 --> 01:38:35,681
The flashy lifestyle is only a show off

933
01:38:35,767 --> 01:38:39,305
After this got over she has mixed
water and has washed hair with this

934
01:38:39,367 --> 01:38:41,369
<i>See how much she has
squeezed 'Ms and used</i>

935
01:38:41,467 --> 01:38:43,140
Laila was only that much

936
01:39:22,033 --> 01:39:24,104
A concise life history

937
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,579
Sorry, an autobiography
on a day to day basis

938
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:38,540
On 23rd night a special programme
arranged by Rana for Laila

939
01:39:39,467 --> 01:39:44,974
College band friends of Rana who are
unknown to her are coming from Mumbai

940
01:39:45,067 --> 01:39:47,570
Then they will take
Laila to the venue

941
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:56,617
Rana has made her believe that
the special event will change her life

942
01:40:13,567 --> 01:40:15,569
Both the voices felt familiar

943
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:17,510
So we did a voice sample match

944
01:40:25,601 --> 01:40:27,774
Where did bloody Rana vanish?

945
01:40:28,001 --> 01:40:30,311
What is new about it?

946
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:33,507
It is his habit to vanish
like this for weeks together

947
01:40:33,567 --> 01:40:36,707
But it is he who did the arrangements
for the birthday party

948
01:40:36,767 --> 01:40:40,738
Why do you worry, brother?
Whether Rana comes or not...

949
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:44,078
...binhday will be surely celebrated
And the cake will also be cut

950
01:40:44,368 --> 01:40:47,747
Okay, I'll get the candles
You bring matches

951
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,138
Okay, brother

952
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,736
This is Dilawar and Dhara

953
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:53,743
The key players of
many of Rana's missions

954
01:40:57,667 --> 01:41:01,774
From this phone call it is clear that
Dhara is somewhere near this city

955
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,981
Sir, but we still don't know
what their plan of action is

956
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:07,780
23rd Prime Minister's visit

957
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,741
The cricket match is
also on the same day

958
01:41:09,801 --> 01:41:14,045
From previous day till 3 days
Islamic peace conference

959
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:16,704
There is no threatening
for Prime Minister's visit

960
01:41:17,434 --> 01:41:21,974
But cricket match and Islamic
peace conference can be targeted

961
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:24,207
...according to intelligence repon

962
01:41:24,334 --> 01:41:26,712
After Rana and
Laila are dead

963
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,179
Dilawar and Dhara must
have taken over this plan

964
01:41:33,267 --> 01:41:36,976
Among these three events on
whichever the attack may be...

965
01:41:37,067 --> 01:41:38,603
...our country will
have to feel sorry

966
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:41,307
...and be put to shame
in front of Global community

967
01:41:41,367 --> 01:41:43,472
But Ayesha
Who the hell is she?

968
01:42:26,367 --> 01:42:29,143
I don't know what the problem
between you and my daughter is

969
01:42:30,067 --> 01:42:31,740
On asking she is not
saying anything

970
01:42:47,734 --> 01:42:50,237
Don't tell anyone
Don't put me to shame

971
01:43:29,767 --> 01:43:32,509
Are you not asking
where I'm taking you to?

972
01:43:32,567 --> 01:43:33,602
It must be to kill me

973
01:43:35,467 --> 01:43:37,777
May be you must have
forgotten your gun

974
01:43:38,001 --> 01:43:40,038
Then you can bang
the car and kill me

975
01:43:40,101 --> 01:43:42,138
It is not a long time
since we have got married

976
01:43:42,201 --> 01:43:44,374
It is not time to
feel like killing you

977
01:43:44,467 --> 01:43:47,607
Are you doing all
this act to impress me?

978
01:43:47,701 --> 01:43:50,147
I'm starting that only now

979
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:08,775
What do you have to
prove now, Jai?

980
01:44:09,001 --> 01:44:11,140
Is it that you are a big
stunt man like in cinema?

981
01:44:11,234 --> 01:44:12,770
No, I'm a trained man for all this

982
01:44:13,034 --> 01:44:13,739
I'm an agent

983
01:44:14,201 --> 01:44:15,236
Agent?

984
01:44:15,334 --> 01:44:17,780
Is it an insurance agent
or travel agent?

985
01:44:18,734 --> 01:44:22,682
Okay, you must be
the goon of the agency...

986
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,371
You'll shoot those
who don't take policy

987
01:44:25,434 --> 01:44:27,436
Else you'll drive over
the car and kill them

988
01:44:27,534 --> 01:44:29,104
Have you got training for that?

989
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,073
Mumbai 26/11

990
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:42,410
Do you remember
a terrorist attack like that?

991
01:44:43,467 --> 01:44:49,474
After one year to that shameful
act our country took a decision

992
01:44:49,601 --> 01:44:53,572
If we have to fight face to
face with terrorists...

993
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:57,512
We need an intelligence
agency in our country

994
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:04,080
In that no one or no agent should
reveal his identity to even his wife

995
01:45:04,167 --> 01:45:07,171
He shouldn't tell who he
is and what his job is

996
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:11,579
Among those men who don't have
the rights to reveal their true identity...

997
01:45:11,634 --> 01:45:14,342
...I'm also one, that's me

998
01:45:17,267 --> 01:45:21,716
Our Deccan Exports company
which you and your father...

999
01:45:21,767 --> 01:45:25,715
...call as lousy is an
outer cover for that

1000
01:45:28,034 --> 01:45:30,412
Now also you don't believe, isn't it?

1001
01:46:09,067 --> 01:46:10,205
See there

1002
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,443
Sitting in this export company
we find out the terrorists...

1003
01:46:18,534 --> 01:46:21,276
...who are imported here
by our enemy countries

1004
01:46:21,334 --> 01:46:23,712
See monitoring terror activities

1005
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:26,506
Phone tapping

1006
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,141
Spy work
Like that many things

1007
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,771
They are the team
members working with me

1008
01:46:45,534 --> 01:46:48,310
ls your wife back?

1009
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,680
So now do you understand that
this is not an export company?

1010
01:46:55,801 --> 01:47:00,614
- We both are not-
- Sir, she can't understand Tamil

1011
01:47:01,001 --> 01:47:04,414
- Is it so?
- Okay, look Anjali

1012
01:47:05,334 --> 01:47:09,180
Do you know now what the commodities
that are traded in Deccan Exports are?

1013
01:47:10,734 --> 01:47:15,240
Anjali, whatever you saw and heard here,
don't tell anyone outside

1014
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,076
What is my job? Who are they?
Not a word, okay?

1015
01:47:20,067 --> 01:47:26,541
Sir, this innocent executive of
mine is a commando of this country

1016
01:47:27,167 --> 01:47:29,477
I don't think anyone
will believe that after this

1017
01:47:29,534 --> 01:47:32,538
What about you?
Do you believe me?

1018
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:56,046
Thanks you
Greetings

1019
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:59,376
- Where are you escaping?
- I'm not going anywhere

1020
01:47:59,467 --> 01:48:04,473
Fool! In this agency even if a small
hint goes out, it is like a virus

1021
01:48:04,534 --> 01:48:06,673
- Don't you have sense?
-What virus?

1022
01:48:06,734 --> 01:48:08,645
Is it a joke for you?

1023
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,574
I'll shoot and put in fire
You and your wife

1024
01:48:14,134 --> 01:48:16,546
- Go, man
- Thank you, sir

1025
01:48:18,467 --> 01:48:19,969
Oh Prophet!

1026
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:24,206
In the room
why did your chief...

1027
01:48:24,267 --> 01:48:27,407
...c:atch hold of your collar
and pointed gun at you?

1028
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:29,037
Is it for telling
everything to me?

1029
01:48:29,134 --> 01:48:31,671
After bringing
your wife to my office...

1030
01:48:31,734 --> 01:48:35,739
...why you didn't get her
even a tea, he asked

1031
01:48:42,667 --> 01:48:44,738
- Is it that female?
- Come

1032
01:48:48,067 --> 01:48:49,637
Jai, tell me the truth

1033
01:48:49,734 --> 01:48:52,544
Has she really gone crazy
after you married me?

1034
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,342
After marrying you it is not her
but me who has gone crazy

1035
01:48:58,434 --> 01:48:59,469
It is paining

1036
01:48:59,534 --> 01:49:01,480
For that the chief caught
hold of your neck

1037
01:49:01,534 --> 01:49:04,014
- Your father slapped me
-What? When?

1038
01:49:04,067 --> 01:49:05,341
I don't remember
the correct time

1039
01:49:05,434 --> 01:49:06,242
Did it really pain?

1040
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:08,439
For two hours there was
ringing sound in my ears

1041
01:49:08,501 --> 01:49:12,108
It is good, the doctor had kept that
from many days for his son-in-law

1042
01:49:12,533 --> 01:49:15,480
Jai, shall I say
sorry to son-in-law?

1043
01:49:15,534 --> 01:49:17,980
- How?
- Like this

1044
01:49:44,001 --> 01:49:46,072
Jai, have you murdered anyone?

1045
01:49:46,167 --> 01:49:49,410
Yes, that was for the country...enemies

1046
01:49:53,667 --> 01:49:54,645
I will see

1047
01:50:00,601 --> 01:50:03,639
Jai, see who has come
Sir, please come inside

1048
01:50:04,767 --> 01:50:05,575
Here

1049
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:23,648
I came here to talk about
a serious matter to you

1050
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:26,341
I know that you didn't
come here to drink tea

1051
01:50:27,501 --> 01:50:29,777
That is...with you...

1052
01:51:00,468 --> 01:51:05,076
For few hours you have
to become Laila, Anjali

1053
01:51:07,267 --> 01:51:10,510
What is it?
One night...only night

1054
01:51:10,567 --> 01:51:15,073
She must dress up like Laila
and sing and dance on stage

1055
01:51:15,167 --> 01:51:18,444
Then the three musicians who
are going to come from Mumbai

1056
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:22,642
Those friends of Rana
Thinking as Laila they'll meet Anjali

1057
01:51:30,634 --> 01:51:33,581
Sir, there are so many agents
and trained people in our team

1058
01:51:34,634 --> 01:51:37,478
No one else can do
what she can

1059
01:51:41,301 --> 01:51:44,510
None among our agents
have this much talent

1060
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,511
- Jai, this man-
- This man!

1061
01:51:46,567 --> 01:51:50,413
Sorry, how does sir know
that I can sing and dance?

1062
01:51:50,467 --> 01:51:53,448
See how nicely she is
talking Tamil like Laila

1063
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:00,609
Anjali has danced and
sung in college band

1064
01:52:00,667 --> 01:52:04,410
Then in your Malayalee
Samajam she has performed

1065
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:07,140
I enquired everything about her

1066
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:10,409
I have put a detailed dossier
about her in this laptop

1067
01:52:10,467 --> 01:52:11,241
See this

1068
01:52:25,467 --> 01:52:28,141
Madam, your fate
is like that

1069
01:52:28,234 --> 01:52:30,578
That is why you have got
such an opportunity

1070
01:52:31,734 --> 01:52:35,204
Where and in what way there is a
resemblance between her and Laila?

1071
01:52:35,267 --> 01:52:38,680
Now there is no resemblance but
resemblance will come with attitude

1072
01:52:38,734 --> 01:52:40,771
- After she is trained
- Sir, she'll get nonsense

1073
01:52:41,001 --> 01:52:42,207
Nonsense if you train her

1074
01:52:42,267 --> 01:52:45,271
Now in any pan of my body if you
keep egg, it'll become bulls eye

1075
01:52:45,334 --> 01:52:48,076
- Do you know that?
-I don't know and I don't care

1076
01:52:53,401 --> 01:52:56,644
Now in this city a new terrorist
attack is going to take place

1077
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:59,704
Where? How? And when? It is not known

1078
01:52:59,767 --> 01:53:02,247
We have no clue
But you know one thing?

1079
01:53:02,334 --> 01:53:06,282
Whatever that Rana
planned is sure to take place

1080
01:53:08,634 --> 01:53:12,707
- What other option is there?
- Sir, she is my wife

1081
01:53:15,301 --> 01:53:17,110
What to do if there is
another attack?

1082
01:53:17,167 --> 01:53:19,704
What to do? Tell me
They'll spit on the face

1083
01:53:20,034 --> 01:53:23,038
On your face and on my face
Can we bear it?

1084
01:53:23,167 --> 01:53:27,343
It'll be such a big shame?
Make her a pan of your team

1085
01:53:27,434 --> 01:53:30,608
Include her in the operation
Include her too

1086
01:53:31,068 --> 01:53:32,638
I'm asking this
for our Mother land

1087
01:53:32,734 --> 01:53:33,769
Let's do this

1088
01:53:43,301 --> 01:53:46,009
- Sir, I'll do this
-Anjali

1089
01:53:47,701 --> 01:53:51,171
Let's do this, Jai
For our country's sake

1090
01:53:51,568 --> 01:53:54,276
For my Jai's sake
I'll do it, sir

1091
01:54:05,134 --> 01:54:09,708
"I'm the girl beautiful
who has come to charm you"

1092
01:54:09,767 --> 01:54:14,273
"There is no one on this
earth to compete with me..."

1093
01:54:32,501 --> 01:54:36,643
"I'm the girl beautiful
who has come to charm you"

1094
01:54:36,701 --> 01:54:40,649
Jai, I can't behave like her
It is not possible for me

1095
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:45,675
Did you see, sir?
She saw Laila only once

1096
01:54:45,734 --> 01:54:47,543
It is over
inferiority complex

1097
01:54:47,634 --> 01:54:51,514
What? To whom? What complex

1098
01:54:51,567 --> 01:54:53,672
To shake butt in front of men?

1099
01:54:53,734 --> 01:54:54,439
Move

1100
01:54:54,501 --> 01:54:57,209
Sir, girls like me who are born
into decent family can't do this

1101
01:54:57,268 --> 01:54:59,612
That is the reason
Except that I have no complex

1102
01:54:59,667 --> 01:55:02,739
It is not so easy to shake butt, Anjali

1103
01:55:03,201 --> 01:55:04,009
That...

1104
01:55:05,467 --> 01:55:08,311
You are the right person
to change her

1105
01:55:22,167 --> 01:55:23,737
What happened?
Didn't you like it?

1106
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:26,280
From the back it looks
like an elephant is walking

1107
01:55:26,334 --> 01:55:27,608
It is that good

1108
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:32,207
On Ramp you should
walk like models

1109
01:55:32,267 --> 01:55:35,612
You must flow like feather
You must not look down

1110
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,711
You stop there
I'll show you

1111
01:56:00,701 --> 01:56:05,047
Laila walk means the whole
action is in buttocks

1112
01:56:06,034 --> 01:56:09,481
Chee! That means when
she walks, you stare only there

1113
01:56:09,534 --> 01:56:10,342
Idiot!

1114
01:56:12,334 --> 01:56:13,404
It is not possible for me

1115
01:56:13,467 --> 01:56:15,310
Walk like that
Shake the buttocks like this

1116
01:56:15,367 --> 01:56:18,075
You must be the first husband
in this world to be teaching...

1117
01:56:18,134 --> 01:56:20,205
...your own wife to
shake buttocks like this

1118
01:56:20,634 --> 01:56:24,741
The way you are ordering it sounds
as if a military man is teaching march past

1119
01:56:26,034 --> 01:56:29,277
Look here, from tomorrow
I won't be teaching you

1120
01:56:29,334 --> 01:56:31,473
I have found
an apt person to teach you

1121
01:56:31,534 --> 01:56:32,444
Who is that?

1122
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:36,346

Bollywood movies and beauty contest

1123
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:42,144
Orignal name Kuppu Samy
from Chennai

1124

What joke is this?

1125
01:56:55,567 --> 01:56:59,777
Should I make this girl
like that girl? No way

1126
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:04,313
Can this cuckoo be made
like that peacock? Impossible

1127
01:57:04,401 --> 01:57:08,008
Hey! Do I look like
cuckoo to you?

1128
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:10,513
You are talking too much
Do you know who I'm?

1129
01:57:10,567 --> 01:57:11,739
Get lost

1130
01:57:15,334 --> 01:57:18,577
You have 2 days time
to change her

1131
01:57:18,634 --> 01:57:21,046
I'm telling you, sir

1132
01:57:21,134 --> 01:57:24,707
Not two days, even if you give me 2 years,
this girl can't be made beautiful

1133
01:57:24,801 --> 01:57:28,146
What am I telling you?
Can't you do it, Kuppu Samy?

1134
01:57:28,234 --> 01:57:32,546
Sir, even if you beat me, hit me or
put me in jail, this can't be done

1135
01:57:33,267 --> 01:57:35,042
Put him in lock up

1136

Put me down

02:07:01,567 --> 02:07:02,477
Brilliant

1218
02:07:02,534 --> 02:07:05,174
Jai, I'm a bit nervous

1219
02:07:05,267 --> 02:07:08,043
You are not nervous
You are Laila, okay?

1220
02:07:08,267 --> 02:07:09,712
Jai, come on

1221
02:07:10,268 --> 02:07:11,542
I'm outside the club

1222
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:12,442
Don't worry

1223
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,674
It is more than "'0 an hour
No one has come till now

1224
02:07:15,734 --> 02:07:19,648
You wait for 10 more minutes
Even after that if nobody arrives

1225
02:07:19,734 --> 02:07:23,341
<i>You come down m
the basement park and go to HA</i>

1226
02:07:23,801 --> 02:07:26,714
Laila's Mercedes car
is there with key

1227
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:30,106
You take the car and
go to her flat directly

1228
02:07:30,201 --> 02:07:33,205
I'm following you in
a safe distance, okay?

1229
02:07:33,301 --> 02:07:34,371
Okay

1230
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:39,509
- Vicky, try Anjali's phone
-Yes, sir

1231
02:07:39,601 --> 02:07:41,012
And make it fast

1232
02:08:46,134 --> 02:08:47,477
Come on
Get in the cab

1233
02:08:47,568 --> 02:08:48,376
Yes

1234
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,275
- Let me get my phone
-We are getting late

1235
02:08:50,367 --> 02:08:51,505
Laila, come fast

1236
02:08:51,567 --> 02:08:53,012
- Hey!
-What?

1237
02:08:53,067 --> 02:08:54,273
What is it?

1238
02:08:54,701 --> 02:08:56,510
Leave my hand

1239
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:58,273
- Let me take my phone
- Laila

1240
02:08:58,334 --> 02:09:00,007
- Just a second
- Leave that

1241
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:01,545
Come on
We'll drop you back

1242
02:09:01,601 --> 02:09:02,671
- Get in Fast
- Okay

1243
02:09:02,767 --> 02:09:03,768
Come

1244
02:09:04,101 --> 02:09:05,637
Come
Get in quickly

1245
02:09:05,734 --> 02:09:07,611
Give me space, Laila

1246
02:09:56,201 --> 02:09:58,340
- Sir, they have got Anjali
-Who?

1247
02:09:58,434 --> 02:10:00,243
What do you mean by
they have got Anjali?

1248
02:10:00,301 --> 02:10:01,541
Sir, I'll get back to you

1249
02:10:05,667 --> 02:10:07,476
Jai, where are you now?

1250
02:10:07,534 --> 02:10:10,105
- I'm tracking her, sir
- Okay

1251
02:10:10,601 --> 02:10:13,241
Sir, Rana's DNA test reports

1252
02:10:13,734 --> 02:10:16,044
Jai sir's suspicion was correct, sir

1253
02:10:20,067 --> 02:10:21,045
My God!

1254
02:10:29,401 --> 02:10:31,472
- DNA results have come
- Okay

1255
02:10:31,534 --> 02:10:35,346
That day the girl who died in
the accident was Laila only

1256
02:10:35,534 --> 02:10:36,535
It is positive

1257
02:10:36,634 --> 02:10:39,342
But the other body
is not Victor Rana

1258
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:43,009
DNA result is negative

1259
02:10:43,401 --> 02:10:46,143
- Rana is alive, Jai
-I knew it

1260
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:47,474
He knows that

1261
02:10:48,101 --> 02:10:49,739
Anjali is not Laila

1262
02:10:50,001 --> 02:10:51,776
I told you that time itself

1263
02:10:52,734 --> 02:10:54,714
if something
happens to her, I'll bloody-

1264
02:10:54,767 --> 02:10:56,212
Jai, please calm down

1265
02:10:56,267 --> 02:10:57,974
Nothing will happen to Anjali

1266
02:11:13,301 --> 02:11:15,975
Now where are we going, Laila?

1267
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:21,543
- Don't you know?
- What do we know?

1268
02:11:21,634 --> 02:11:24,672
You were about to
take us there, isn't it?

1269
02:11:25,467 --> 02:11:26,639
Tell us, Laila

1270
02:11:26,701 --> 02:11:29,341
Where do we have to go? Tell us

1271
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,276
Hey, who is this Ayesha?

1272
02:11:37,034 --> 02:11:40,140
Look I don't have time
for your stupid questions

1273
02:11:40,234 --> 02:11:41,645
Shut up and drive

1274
02:11:41,734 --> 02:11:43,407
Else you stop
I'm leaving

1275
02:11:43,467 --> 02:11:45,777
You act very well, Laila

1276
02:11:47,734 --> 02:11:48,974
Go

1277
02:11:55,334 --> 02:11:56,677
Mount Street

1278
02:13:14,467 --> 02:13:16,071
Ay es ha <i>s</i> potted

1279
02:13:18,334 --> 02:13:22,646
It is not a person's name
It is a villa on Mount street

1280
02:13:22,768 --> 02:13:24,975
Mount Street 10 kms
away from the city

1281
02:13:25,301 --> 02:13:26,712
Please take the details

1282
02:13:26,767 --> 02:13:29,270
I want all the details
including who is the owner

1283
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:49,510
The villa's owner is Ratan Mittal

1284
02:13:49,601 --> 02:13:50,671
Ratan Mittal!

1285
02:13:50,767 --> 02:13:53,611
Business tycoon Power broker,
but an animal

1286
02:13:53,667 --> 02:13:55,772
His birthday is about to take place

1287
02:13:56,034 --> 02:14:00,380
Inside the house only VIP's,
Businessmen, Politicians and Bureaucrats

1288
02:14:00,467 --> 02:14:02,640
But sir, there is nothing
particular here

1289
02:14:02,701 --> 02:14:03,611
No celebrations

1290
02:14:03,667 --> 02:14:06,773
That means he must have cancelled
the celebration at the last moment

1291
02:14:08,767 --> 02:14:10,644
Sir it seems Anjali is inside

1292
02:14:11,134 --> 02:14:12,204
Sir, I'm going in

1293
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:13,370
Listen, Jai

1294
02:14:13,467 --> 02:14:15,413
You take care
and be careful

1295
02:15:49,734 --> 02:15:51,213
Ratan Mittal

1296
02:16:20,367 --> 02:16:22,074
Drop your gun down

1297
02:16:53,534 --> 02:16:55,480
Sir, Ratan Mittal is dead

1298
02:16:57,067 --> 02:16:59,377
Even nowl don't know
where is Anjali

1299
02:17:00,534 --> 02:17:03,071
Sir, they are ahead of us by one step

1300
02:17:03,367 --> 02:17:06,177
They know,
that we are tracking them

1301
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,411
Welcome, MrJai Mohan

1302
02:17:14,267 --> 02:17:16,770
Ratan Mittal changed his plan

1303
02:17:17,034 --> 02:17:20,208
No birthday party and
no Laila performance

1304
02:17:20,301 --> 02:17:22,577
So we punished him

1305
02:17:23,368 --> 02:17:26,144
We improvised our plan a bit

1306
02:17:26,201 --> 02:17:28,442
But we were expecting you

1307
02:17:29,534 --> 02:17:31,275
Drop your gun down

1308
02:17:31,367 --> 02:17:32,277
I said...

1309
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,202
Where is my wife?

1310
02:17:43,634 --> 02:17:44,704
- Tell me
-No

1311
02:17:44,767 --> 02:17:46,212
Where is my wife?

1312
02:18:10,467 --> 02:18:12,777
Anjali, are you okay?

1313
02:18:25,234 --> 02:18:28,977
- Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay, Jai

1314
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:31,105
To have brought you in this mission

1315
02:18:31,167 --> 02:18:31,736
Let's go

1316
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:32,710
No

1317
02:18:32,801 --> 02:18:34,712
- It is not that easy
-Why?

1318
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:49,470
My God!

1319
02:19:00,201 --> 02:19:01,976
Sir, I found Anjali

1320
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,744
But

1321
02:19:06,634 --> 02:19:07,738
What?

1322
02:19:09,234 --> 02:19:10,212
Bomb!

1323
02:19:10,301 --> 02:19:16,775
Sir, it is a acetone peroxide liquid
explosive, a simple cell phone detonator

1324
02:19:17,367 --> 02:19:21,042
Asingle phone call is enough for
everything to explode and become ash

1325
02:19:21,367 --> 02:19:23,711
With a number
programmed cellphone

1326
02:19:24,034 --> 02:19:25,672
Someone somewhere is...

1327
02:19:27,634 --> 02:19:29,443
What will we do now?

1328
02:20:37,167 --> 02:20:40,239
Sahil, don't cut the cake
till we light the candles

1329
02:20:40,334 --> 02:20:42,712
There is a delay
Just wait for my call

1330
02:20:58,434 --> 02:21:01,005
The last call to this number

1331
02:21:01,167 --> 02:21:04,307
Track the location of that number

1332
02:21:06,334 --> 02:21:08,678
Track the last incoming
call to this number

1333
02:21:12,334 --> 02:21:14,109
This may not be their target

1334
02:21:14,201 --> 02:21:17,114
Laila and Ayesha
All are smoke screens

1335
02:21:17,201 --> 02:21:21,115
To divert our
intelligence network's attention

1336
02:21:21,334 --> 02:21:24,577
Mittal's birthday party
A hostage situation

1337
02:21:24,634 --> 02:21:26,113
A bomb blast

1338
02:21:27,034 --> 02:21:30,641
When all the attentions are
on this side, somewhere else...

1339
02:21:30,734 --> 02:21:34,739
...a big trap will be created to
bring about a bigger disaster

1340
02:21:35,034 --> 02:21:37,344
They must be making
the move for that

1341
02:21:52,034 --> 02:21:54,173
How many people came
with you to this place?

1342
02:21:55,534 --> 02:21:57,138
Four of them

1343
02:21:57,234 --> 02:21:58,338
My God!

1344
02:21:58,601 --> 02:21:59,636
Four?

1345
02:22:01,034 --> 02:22:02,445
Then where is the 4th one?

1346
02:22:14,401 --> 02:22:16,210
Come out

1347
02:22:20,767 --> 02:22:22,178
- Security
- Sir

1348
02:22:22,267 --> 02:22:24,042
ls sir in the house
or has he gone out?

1349
02:22:24,134 --> 02:22:25,613
- Sir is inside
- Okay

1350
02:22:29,234 --> 02:22:31,180
You are an excellent performer

1351
02:22:36,067 --> 02:22:38,377
- Dilawar!
- Hi!

1352
02:22:39,767 --> 02:22:41,644
- Come
- How are you?

1353
02:22:44,534 --> 02:22:47,743
Dilawar, that Mittal spoilt everything

1354
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:52,003
Listen, try to make
him understand

1355
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:54,444
If he agrees, it is okay
Else you shoot him

1356
02:22:55,667 --> 02:22:57,374
And kill the security guy too

1357
02:22:57,434 --> 02:22:58,378
- Okay
- Go

1358
02:22:58,433 --> 02:22:59,275
We'll meet

1359
02:22:59,367 --> 02:23:00,539
Come inside

1360
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,412
- Laila, come
-Yes, I'm coming

1361
02:23:03,567 --> 02:23:05,171
Come...come

1362
02:23:07,733 --> 02:23:09,041
Come on

1363
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,677
Sir, Anjali is with me

1364
02:23:15,767 --> 02:23:17,110
She is safe

1365
02:23:17,734 --> 02:23:21,113
Dilawar was there in
the van in which Anjali came

1366
02:23:21,167 --> 02:23:23,704
He got down from that van
and boarded another car

1367
02:23:23,767 --> 02:23:27,180
- Dhara is the driver of that car
- Dhara came in which car, Jai?

1368
02:23:27,267 --> 02:23:30,612
Sir, that is a white
color Ford Ecos fort

1369
02:23:30,734 --> 02:23:32,645
Any idea about the number?

1370
02:23:33,134 --> 02:23:34,670
I'm sorry, sir
Anjali didn't notice...

1371
02:23:34,767 --> 02:23:37,338
KA01 X83132

1372
02:23:38,067 --> 02:23:41,207
- Sir, it is KA01 X83132
- Okay

1373
02:23:41,267 --> 02:23:43,770
- Good
- Thank you

1374
02:23:52,367 --> 02:23:53,971
Jai, that car has been spotted

1375
02:23:54,067 --> 02:23:56,206
We have traced the incoming call too

1376
02:23:56,301 --> 02:24:00,681
The phone call to that number came
from the mobile tower near the Airport

1377
02:24:00,767 --> 02:24:03,976
The car in which Dhara came has
also been located only there

1378
02:24:04,167 --> 02:24:06,647
In the industrial site near the runway

1379
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:10,304
And now even the local
police is searching there

1380
02:24:12,067 --> 02:24:13,546
And one more thing, Jai

1381
02:24:14,034 --> 02:24:17,140
We have identified the body
that was with Laila in that car

1382
02:24:17,634 --> 02:24:19,773
A missing CISF officer

1383
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,139
Ram Singh, Airport security wing

1384
02:24:22,234 --> 02:24:25,113
Sir, I think I know what their plan is

1385
02:24:29,367 --> 02:24:30,744
Anjali, come here

1386
02:24:33,667 --> 02:24:35,738
Here, Anjali
Just open it

1387
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:39,278
You'll find an item in that
National VIP movement tracker

1388
02:24:39,334 --> 02:24:41,075
- Click it
- Okay

1389
02:24:43,134 --> 02:24:46,547
- Jai, password
-Your name Anjali

1390
02:24:56,367 --> 02:24:58,472
It is a security system showing...

1391
02:24:58,534 --> 02:25:01,481
...National and foreign VIP's
programme and travel plans

1392
02:25:01,534 --> 02:25:02,342
Check it

1393
02:25:02,401 --> 02:25:04,108
On updating airport log in...

02:25:04,167 --> 02:25:07,307
...you'll get change of plan
rescheduling, delays, anything

1395
02:25:22,334 --> 02:25:24,678
The flight of the former
US President who is coming...

1396
02:25:24,733 --> 02:25:27,339

But who'll be benefited by

High profile causality
