1
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:09,568
Vishnu, Smell this.

2
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,100
This is your future.

3
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,000
A drop of Atma Hair potion...

4
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,700
Your hair springs into motion,

5
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,566
Everything else is an illusion.

6
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:35,868
Vishnu, easy!

7
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:44,267
The future is in dandrum.

8
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,734
The future is hair loss.

9
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,568
The future is dry scalps.

10
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,567
The future is now.

11
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:55,666
We need to embrace it.

12
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,700
With new ideas... and new products.

13
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,733
Like the Chinese.

14
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:03,668
Forget about the past.
The past was another country.

15
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:05,667
That India is dead.

16
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:08,967
I hereby inaugurate...
the 10th annual convention...

17
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:13,736
for beauty products and cosmetics.
Welcome, everyone!

18
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,767
Vishnu, I have an idea.

19
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,769
Let's sell two bottles
for the price of one.

20
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:29,267
You know what?
Make it three for one!

21
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,367
We'll sell it to college kids.

22
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:35,767
It's cool!

23
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:38,900
It relaxes the mind.

24
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,799
Makes you virile.

25
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:44,969
Prevents hair loss.

26
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:48,100
The perfect antidote to aging.

27
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:50,600
Anything is possible
with Atma Hair Oil!

28
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,968
Don't forget our mantra...

29
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:58,700
Heart to Heart...

30
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:01,200
Door to Door.

31
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,934
Your hair oil, Uncle.

32
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:41,999
Where are you going?

33
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:47,000
The Samudrabad Museum.

34
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:49,633
Why don't you get a driver?

35
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:56,566
I'm not that old.

36
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,767
I miss driving this truck.

37
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,734
The open road.
Stopping for bitter tea.

38
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:06,100
The cool breeze at night.

39
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:10,133
It's a very old truck.

40
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:13,999
Why don't you junk it?

41
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,332
What do you know?

42
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,667
It's a 1942 Chevy.

43
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:20,868
I put in two Italian
Victoria projectors,

44
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:23,634
turned it into a traveling cinema.

45
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:25,934
Wide screen... Great sound.

46
00:05:26,565 --> 00:05:29,000
The ultimate mobile theater.

47
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:37,633
Can I deliver this truck for you?

48
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,333
Trust me, I can do it.

49
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,633
Stay and help your father.

50
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:46,700
He needs you.

51
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,133
Focus on that.

52
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,099
I don't want to
sell hair oil anymore.

53
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,667
Stop!

54
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:20,067
Don't make fun of tradition.

55
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:23,100
They're as much yours as mine.

56
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,132
I don't know how long
he'll be gone.

57
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,600
Don't be dramatic.
It's only six days, Ma.

58
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:35,000
Bite your tongue.

59
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:46,768
Here are twelve bottles of water.

60
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,866
Conserve it!

61
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:54,566
What are you doing?

62
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,866
Everyone's gone mad.

63
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,799
Hey, Vishnu!

64
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:07,800
If you can't sell
hair oil on the road...

65
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,936
mark my word, you won't be
able sell water in a desert.

66
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,166
Give me the keys.

67
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,700
Put the oil in the back.

68
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:27,001
Remember, what we say?

69
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:30,567
A drop of Atma Hair potion...

70
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,900
your hair springs into motion...

71
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:35,133
Everything else is an illusion!

72
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:44,167
Drive carefully or
the bottles will break!

73
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:17,866
What can I get you, Driver?

74
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,800
Tea, biscuits, lunch.

75
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,967
I'm not a driver.

76
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,866
Wasn't that you driving?

77
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,569
What should I call you then?
Doctor?

78
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:30,699
Get me tea.

79
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,800
Got any cookies? Got Glucose?

80
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,134
Tiger. Better than Glucose.

81
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:39,368
It's sweeter...
and cheaper too. Driver!

82
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,366
It's my truck.

83
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,199
You're still a driver, aren't you?

84
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,268
What did you expect, Starbucks?

85
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:20,901
Don't stop because of me.

86
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,367
Don't tell me what to do. Piss off.

87
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:27,167
Can I get a ride to town?

88
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,367
I'm not going there.

89
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,700
I want to get out of here.

90
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:35,701
Didn't you hear me?
I'm not going there.

91
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:40,068
I'm looking for another job.

92
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:46,133
Any smart ass stunt,
I'll throw you out.

93
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,967
From the moving truck. Got it?

94
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, I get it.

95
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:54,666
Promise.

96
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:00,700
It stinks!

97
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:03,100
Out, out.

98
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:28,066
What kind of truck is this?

99
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,733
I can walk faster.

100
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:36,734
Why don't you drive a Toyota?
Can't afford one?

101
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:07,167
It's all your fault.

102
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,369
I should never have
stopped at your tea shop.

103
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,733
Blame the truck, not me.

104
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:17,601
It should be in a museum,
not on the road.

105
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,367
Oh yeah?

106
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,801
And how do you plan to
get out of here... Fly?

107
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:28,600
Go get someone to fix this.

108
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:31,333
Or it's back to your Starbucks.

109
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:18,701
Hey! Boy!

110
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:22,000
Driver. Wake up.

111
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:23,800
I found him.

112
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,166
Wake up.

113
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,566
I found him.

114
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:32,668
Who?
- Mechanic.

115
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,300
You're a mechanic?

116
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:50,133
What do you know about trucks?

117
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:53,066
It's old, huh.

118
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,600
Where did you find this guy?

119
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,802
It was tough. Don't ask.
He said he could fix it.

120
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,733
You grabbed the
first person you saw.

121
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:20,669
Alright!
Just fix this piece of junk.

122
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:24,768
I've lost half a day already.

123
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,766
Open the hood.

124
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:45,600
1942.

125
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,966
Told you it's old.

126
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:51,635
They don't make them
like this anymore.

127
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:54,900
What would you know?

128
00:16:57,964 --> 00:16:59,999
Get me two wires, now!

129
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,801
What are you looking at?

130
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,166
Under the seat.

131
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,668
What are you staring at?
Give me a hand.

132
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:42,667
Hey, this isn't a bus service!

133
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:45,067
The kid and I have a deal.

134
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,936
I fix your truck...
you drop me at the fair.

135
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:53,634
What fair? I'm not
driving to any fair.

136
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,567
Coat. Bag. Cap.

137
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,800
Hit the clutch firmly.

138
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:23,667
Now the gas.

139
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,800
Easy...

140
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,633
Keep it running.

141
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:35,767
Now slowly ease off.

142
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:41,668
Don't worry. I don't bite.

143
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:15,366
They're searching for water.

144
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,667
They walk for days
until they find it.

145
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:25,902
You think you're
the king of the road?

146
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:29,367
Papers? License?

147
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:42,667
Is this a truck or a motorcycle?
- Truck.

148
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:46,200
This license is for a motorcycle.

149
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,333
Papers! For the Truck.

150
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,801
Officer! -Papers...?

151
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:54,067
It's a piece of junk.

152
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:57,701
I barely got it running.

153
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,601
Does this old jalopy
really need papers?

154
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:05,103
It's my duty to check
every suspicious vehicle...

155
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,901
that travels through
my jurisdiction.

156
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:09,999
This... Suspicious?

157
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,802
We got word that...
Veeru the Waterlord is smuggling...

158
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,268
large quantities of
water on this road.

159
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:19,300
You've got to be joking.

160
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:24,136
You think a Waterlord...
would use this truck?

161
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:29,066
Open the back.

162
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,633
Come on...

163
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,766
What's all this?

164
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:01,067
Stolen?

165
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:03,700
Does he look like a thief?

166
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:08,168
Never mind. Aren't there
other people to stop today?

167
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,267
Then what's this?

168
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:25,136
You clever bastard!
So that's what you're up to.

169
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:27,100
You know what that is?

170
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:30,635
It's scrap.
It's been lying in a garage.

171
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:33,066
It's not scrap.

172
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:35,867
It's a bloody cinema on wheels.

173
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:37,699
A traveling cinema!

174
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:40,167
Are you going to show movies?

175
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:42,100
Got a license for that?

176
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:44,133
I've got a long journey.

177
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,166
It's just junk.
I'm helping out a friend.

178
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,768
You don't have a license.
No papers.

179
00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:52,100
Everything inside is stolen.

180
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:54,901
And you're
transporting film in the open.

181
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,933
If it caught fire?

182
00:22:57,065 --> 00:23:00,201
And this kid? You're
trafficking children?

183
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,734
Follow me.

184
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:43,566
Got any porn?

185
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,867
Yes, yes, sir.

186
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:50,001
Horror, Thriller...

187
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:53,334
Romance, Comedy, Tragedy.
Loads of them in the truck.

188
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:02,801
Tell the villagers we're
showing a film tonight.

189
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:05,267
And if it's boring...

190
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:08,066
hang the three.

191
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:31,166
Are you crazy?

192
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:33,734
You want to get us killed?

193
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:38,001
Stand up! Idiot!

194
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:40,967
Your plan's not going to work.

195
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:43,600
Do you have another plan?

196
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,734
I've lost an entire day.

197
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:50,734
Where are you going, anyway?

198
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:58,668
Fine. Don't tell me.

199
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,667
Rot here forever!

200
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:05,668
It's your truck...
do what you want.

201
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,266
I'm out of here.

202
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,099
Hey, are you coming?

203
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:12,600
Or do you want
a lashing from the cop?

204
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,366
Samudrabad.

205
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:29,101
The city by the sea.

206
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:46,366
Do you know the way?

207
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,199
I'll pay you.

208
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:58,667
Stop fighting!

209
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:01,800
Get this thing going.

210
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:29,302
You don't think I can do it?

211
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,166
Ah, got it.

212
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:35,869
It goes from here...
through this...

213
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:38,800
You've done this before?

214
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,199
I've seen it at the fair.

215
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:45,734
So what's with
the city by the sea?

216
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm helping a friend.

217
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:53,799
Friend?

218
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:56,100
Help?

219
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,566
You?

220
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:03,667
Bloody cops. They're thieves.

221
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:05,733
Let's show them the
worst movie we've got.

222
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,701
That's foolish.

223
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,733
Don't you remember the
story of Scheherazade?

224
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:17,702
Once upon a time... a King
questioned his Queen's fidelity.

225
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:22,302
He was so angry with
his Queen that he...

226
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:30,134
He married a new Queen everyday...

227
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:32,567
and the new morning he would...

228
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:36,300
After killing
three thousand Queens...

229
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:38,666
it was Scheherazade's turn.

230
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:43,668
We need one more thing...
- What?

231
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,967
So you know what
Scheherazade did?

232
00:27:52,365 --> 00:27:55,568
She began telling
the King a story...

233
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:59,301
a never-ending story...

234
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,366
Look outside.

235
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:10,003
Steal? - Hey, kid...
We're in a police station.

236
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:12,867
Let's do what the
cops do every day.

237
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:14,999
Come on.

238
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,934
Go. Hook them up.

239
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:19,866
Hurry up!

240
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,368
The King would stay
awake all night...

241
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:25,301
captivated by Scheherazade's story.

242
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:33,670
Be careful, it's a live wire!
You'll get a shock!

243
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:39,334
He kept Scheherazade alive...

244
00:28:39,365 --> 00:28:42,735
so that he could hear
her tale every night.

245
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,000
What happened?

246
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,266
How did it get stuck?

247
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:06,803
Is there any... Motor oil... Diesel?

248
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:09,132
Some kind of oil?

249
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:23,599
Hey, what's this?

250
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:27,002
Hey, don't touch that.
- Yuck!

251
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:32,334
Awesome! It stinks!

252
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,300
You want to spend the rest
of your life with the cops?

253
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,100
Let go!

254
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:38,567
Go left... Shoot!

255
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:07,899
I want a woman.

256
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,901
Get up!

257
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:35,899
Let's get out of here.

258
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:38,366
Stupid junkie.

259
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:47,700
I'm not touching him.

260
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:51,300
He saved your life.

261
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,734
He smells.

262
00:35:47,998 --> 00:35:49,799
Stop!

263
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:55,166
Stop, please!

264
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,566
Hey!

265
00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:07,102
Please, stop.

266
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:10,900
Listen to me.

267
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:13,099
Please, sir.

268
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:22,667
Come on, fix the truck.

269
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:29,801
Ok. You win. Anything you want.

270
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:32,300
Just fix the truck.

271
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:36,268
Anything?
- Yes.

272
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:39,701
Food, water, money, anything...

273
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:43,567
You learn quick.

274
00:39:43,765 --> 00:39:45,867
But I don't trust you.

275
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:48,066
I won't leave you again.

276
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:51,667
I swear.

277
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:53,800
On my mother!

278
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,166
Here's the deal.

279
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,999
You're going to drop me at the fair.

280
00:40:08,298 --> 00:40:12,168
Not halfway... not on-the-way.

281
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,368
Right in the heart of the fair.

282
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:36,267
There. That's the way to the fair.

283
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,968
But, there's no road there.
- That's the way to the fair.

284
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:46,201
And a short cut to the sea.

285
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:53,601
Short cuts aren't printed
on maps. So, stop arguing.

286
00:40:58,565 --> 00:40:59,899
There.

287
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,901
We're lost. I know it.

288
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:48,367
We are all lost, aren't we?

289
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:52,900
Just keep moving...

290
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:55,666
Straight ahead...

291
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:58,967
No detours...

292
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:02,101
Just dead ahead.

293
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:43,567
Bastard!

294
00:43:10,565 --> 00:43:13,134
You're heartless.

295
00:43:48,665 --> 00:43:53,603
Water, water.

296
00:45:05,265 --> 00:45:07,333
Do you have some water?

297
00:45:08,298 --> 00:45:12,135
Listen!

298
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:15,367
Do you have any water?

299
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:30,067
Some water?

300
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:05,800
You gave him water and not me?

301
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:08,600
Learn to live with less.

302
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:15,304
If you grab like that...
you'll lose whatever little we have.

303
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:22,902
Can you help us find
some water? I've got money.

304
00:46:22,964 --> 00:46:25,800
You're embarrassing.

305
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:32,133
Are you lost too?

306
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,700
I'm looking for water.

307
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:38,666
Where are you going?

308
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:42,633
Wherever she can find water.

309
00:46:44,565 --> 00:46:46,867
Didn't you hear her?

310
00:46:54,298 --> 00:46:56,333
Get in the back.

311
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:07,568
How can you trust her?
What if she steals something?

312
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:09,933
We're not carrying gold.

313
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:13,101
She's a gypsy. You never know.

314
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,367
Why can't she sit in front...
with us?

315
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:19,934
If she sits with us...

316
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:25,269
how would our Driver...
keep his eyes on the road?

317
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:27,933
Don't trust strangers.

318
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:30,066
What about you?

319
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:35,266
Sit in front.

320
00:47:37,098 --> 00:47:38,799
You too.

321
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:46,966
A woman.

322
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:51,634
That's all we needed.

323
00:47:54,765 --> 00:47:57,067
But I have to hand it to you.

324
00:47:59,298 --> 00:48:01,700
I can see you have a heart...

325
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,901
and it's between your legs.

326
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:33,933
You have no idea where the fair is.

327
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:35,899
You're wrong.

328
00:48:36,565 --> 00:48:39,267
This is the way.

329
00:48:40,098 --> 00:48:42,567
We will find the fair.

330
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:44,967
People will come.

331
00:48:45,865 --> 00:48:48,167
We'll get food...

332
00:48:48,632 --> 00:48:50,567
water...

333
00:48:57,298 --> 00:48:59,166
Short cut!

334
00:48:59,665 --> 00:49:02,267
They ate all my food.

335
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,967
He promised to show me a short cut.

336
00:49:06,065 --> 00:49:07,766
See, this city kid...

337
00:49:07,899 --> 00:49:11,869
is getting rid of
this traveling cinema.

338
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:16,302
I've never seen a movie...

339
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:18,199
In your entire life?

340
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:23,669
Ah, the magic of cinema...

341
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:31,204
Lets you forget...

342
00:49:32,265 --> 00:49:34,800
the pain... the worry.

343
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:36,700
Takes you far away...

344
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,567
into a world of dreams.

345
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:44,101
Kid... when I was your age,

346
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:47,200
I used to wait
for this truck to come.

347
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:50,001
Kids could go for free.

348
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:52,133
Alam Ara...

349
00:49:52,265 --> 00:49:54,200
Raja Harishchandra...

350
00:49:54,565 --> 00:49:57,267
Tansen, Baiju Bawra

351
00:49:57,732 --> 00:49:59,633
Buster Keaton...

352
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:01,367
Harold Lloyd!

353
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:04,933
How amazing it was...

354
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:10,703
to see him hanging from
the hand of a giant clock.

355
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:16,268
I wish I could forget...

356
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,967
We should keep an eye out.

357
00:51:02,964 --> 00:51:04,632
Someone might see us.

358
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,167
Who?

359
00:51:06,765 --> 00:51:08,933
The Waterlord and his men.

360
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:14,002
City Kid, haven't you
seen a bandit before?

361
00:51:14,765 --> 00:51:16,700
Where have you seen one?

362
00:51:16,765 --> 00:51:18,900
They're like the cops.

363
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:22,600
Show them a movie
and everything's fine.

364
00:51:23,565 --> 00:51:26,701
He killed my husband.

365
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:31,899
When?

366
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,132
Two years ago.

367
00:51:35,765 --> 00:51:37,967
They caught him breaking
into a well.

368
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:14,900
Turn off the headlights, stupid...

369
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,666
you'll run down the battery...

370
00:54:02,565 --> 00:54:04,700
It's a well!

371
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:06,766
Stop!

372
00:54:07,198 --> 00:54:10,000
Don't do it!

373
00:54:10,198 --> 00:54:13,167
If they find out, they'll kill us!

374
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:51,700
Why are you getting
involved in all this, Vishnu?

375
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:54,967
Don't you want to
get back on the road?

376
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:02,201
I know that feeling...

377
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:06,168
But, where will it get you?

378
00:55:12,565 --> 00:55:14,900
You're from different worlds.

379
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:33,634
It's your truck, you fix it.

380
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,333
What about our deal?

381
00:55:41,065 --> 00:55:43,300
She wasn't part of our deal.

382
00:55:47,198 --> 00:55:49,199
Passion...

383
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:54,566
Passion.

384
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:58,367
It's destroyed us all, hasn't it?

385
00:56:01,165 --> 00:56:03,934
Don't just think about yourself.

386
00:56:06,065 --> 00:56:08,600
Think about her too.

387
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:01,566
The heat has gone to your head.

388
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:09,735
A fair here? I've never seen one.

389
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:13,967
It was somewhere here...

390
00:57:18,198 --> 00:57:20,667
Anyone out there?

391
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:31,266
Water.

392
00:57:57,665 --> 00:57:59,666
We're going to die.

393
00:58:00,565 --> 00:58:02,700
Shut up, will you.

394
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:06,667
Didn't I tell you?

395
00:58:08,298 --> 00:58:10,933
Set up the cinema,
and the fair will appear.

396
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:14,968
We will get food and water.
People will come.

397
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:17,000
And what if no one comes?

398
00:58:17,665 --> 00:58:20,100
Well then...
at least we have ganja.

399
00:59:42,565 --> 00:59:44,700
One...

400
00:59:44,765 --> 00:59:46,733
Two...

401
00:59:46,765 --> 00:59:48,733
Three!

402
00:59:53,998 --> 00:59:56,567
Hey kid, tie it firmly.

403
00:59:56,665 --> 00:59:59,200
You too, Vishnu!

404
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,001
What did I tell you?

405
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:47,100
Wait a minute.

406
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:57,133
Use my cell phone.

407
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:16,666
I'll cover this side.

408
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:18,567
You get Ten Rupees from the adults.

409
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:20,133
Kids are free.

410
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:28,667
Where's my lucky charm?

411
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:30,700
Hurry up.

412
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,667
Oh God.

413
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:36,567
This is a really boring scene.

414
01:05:36,665 --> 01:05:38,800
Let me cut it out.

415
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,667
Hey, start the film!

416
01:05:59,899 --> 01:06:02,701
Don't screw up this time.

417
01:06:34,565 --> 01:06:38,368
Massage! Hair oil massage?

418
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,099
6 rupees, sir. Only 6.

419
01:06:46,065 --> 01:06:47,633
No! Leave me alone.

420
01:06:58,165 --> 01:06:59,766
Parijat leaves.

421
01:06:59,899 --> 01:07:02,635
Yup. Organic.

422
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:04,734
Here, another lot of 500.

423
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:07,700
That's a total of 45,000 Rupees.

424
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:12,567
So Vishnu, still
want to sell the truck?

425
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:16,700
Are you thieves?

426
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:22,001
Running from the police?

427
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:23,966
Ask him...

428
01:07:24,598 --> 01:07:26,599
I'm not a thief.

429
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:30,333
It's my father's.

430
01:07:30,565 --> 01:07:31,699
This cinema?

431
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:34,101
-No. -Then it is stolen?

432
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:38,268
The hair oil.
- What?

433
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:43,099
My father makes hair oil.

434
01:07:43,131 --> 01:07:46,267
So you sell hair oil?
You're a salesman?

435
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:49,067
No. I don't sell oil.
I'm not a salesman!

436
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:54,870
Oh, I get it...

437
01:07:55,165 --> 01:07:57,000
I'm just driving the truck.

438
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:02,568
Yeah... Driver.

439
01:08:06,964 --> 01:08:09,566
Let's show movies
and sell hair oil!

440
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:12,067
We'll make a ton of money.

441
01:08:12,765 --> 01:08:16,668
Massage. Hair oil massage?

442
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,766
Vishnu, stop.

443
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:19,100
Vishnu, stop!

444
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:20,766
Are you crazy? They'll kill us.

445
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:24,368
You're crazy. Run and
they'll kill us for sure.

446
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,300
Stand up and confront them.

447
01:12:26,732 --> 01:12:28,133
Vishnu, stop!

448
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:51,169
Why did you break into my property?

449
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:56,566
Speak up!

450
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,133
Look...

451
01:13:58,198 --> 01:13:59,666
Look there...

452
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:02,100
In front of you, And there.

453
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:04,567
All around you!

454
01:14:04,598 --> 01:14:08,702
As far as your eye can see...

455
01:14:08,765 --> 01:14:10,967
and beyond.

456
01:14:11,065 --> 01:14:13,333
All this is mine.

457
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:15,700
I own it.

458
01:14:15,765 --> 01:14:18,067
Every single drop...

459
01:14:18,632 --> 01:14:21,101
that falls from the sky...

460
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:23,666
is mine.

461
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:28,701
Now I'm going to
teach you a lesson.

462
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,633
Take them away.

463
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:34,066
Burn the well...

464
01:14:34,565 --> 01:14:36,600
Let it be a warning to others.

465
01:14:44,998 --> 01:14:48,167
It's the world's best
water distribution system.

466
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:51,133
And I run it,

467
01:14:52,165 --> 01:14:54,100
Single-handedly.

468
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:01,101
If I bottled this water...

469
01:15:01,131 --> 01:15:05,702
and gave it a fancy name...

470
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:09,301
would you still call me a criminal?

471
01:15:09,365 --> 01:15:10,966
No!

472
01:15:11,765 --> 01:15:13,700
You know what you'd call me?

473
01:15:14,131 --> 01:15:16,600
A ''new company.''

474
01:15:17,265 --> 01:15:19,367
A ''corporation.''

475
01:15:21,665 --> 01:15:25,568
You'd give me medals and awards.

476
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:33,303
And you'd beg me
for interviews on TV.

477
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:42,736
But I'm better than any
blood-sucking corporation.

478
01:15:44,964 --> 01:15:47,666
Everyone gets my water...

479
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:53,703
From the richest to the poorest.

480
01:16:10,865 --> 01:16:14,101
He steals our water
and sells it back to us.

481
01:16:18,598 --> 01:16:20,299
Is that right?

482
01:16:23,298 --> 01:16:24,899
Well now...

483
01:16:31,165 --> 01:16:33,567
I'm stealing you.

484
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:35,666
From now on, you're mine.

485
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:37,666
For free.

486
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:41,633
Who gives you the right...?

487
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:45,966
I take what I want.

488
01:16:46,065 --> 01:16:48,634
When I want.

489
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:51,366
I have that power.

490
01:16:51,699 --> 01:16:55,702
You steal our water
and sell it back to us.

491
01:16:55,799 --> 01:16:58,568
You're telling me
how to run my business?

492
01:16:58,899 --> 01:17:00,934
You're no different
from those corporations.

493
01:17:00,998 --> 01:17:02,933
You pick on the weakest.

494
01:17:03,065 --> 01:17:05,367
What can she do? Or the old man?

495
01:17:05,665 --> 01:17:08,601
You're just a kid.

496
01:17:08,998 --> 01:17:11,066
And you're a man?

497
01:17:13,598 --> 01:17:17,101
I'll show you how to be a man.

498
01:17:37,665 --> 01:17:39,266
Smell this.

499
01:17:45,665 --> 01:17:47,733
Relaxes the mind.

500
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:50,266
Prevents hair loss.

501
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:52,566
Makes you virile.

502
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:56,302
Anything is possible
with Atma Hair Oil.

503
01:18:13,098 --> 01:18:17,101
C'mon, oil your hair, become a man.

504
01:18:42,265 --> 01:18:44,734
The comb.

505
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:48,334
How many bottles has he got?
- Two boxes.

506
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:51,566
Get them out.
- It's not free.

507
01:19:54,298 --> 01:19:56,366
No such thing as free oil.

508
01:19:56,565 --> 01:19:58,566
What'd you say?

509
01:19:58,865 --> 01:20:00,967
Everything has a price.

510
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:05,768
One bottle of oil,
for one liter of water.

511
01:20:09,165 --> 01:20:12,735
No one's gotten
water from me for free.

512
01:20:13,098 --> 01:20:15,266
I made you a man.

513
01:20:17,931 --> 01:20:19,565
A real man.

514
01:21:47,598 --> 01:21:49,366
Kid...

515
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:55,669
Give them the water in the back.

516
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:01,167
It's theirs anyway.

517
01:22:24,365 --> 01:22:26,133
Let me see.

518
01:22:36,699 --> 01:22:38,901
Vishnu, it's time to go.

519
01:22:39,598 --> 01:22:41,900
You have to deliver your truck.

520
01:22:44,632 --> 01:22:50,637
See the river bed? follow it...
till you meet the road.

521
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:00,567
Let's show them a movie.

522
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:06,203
Look, Vishnu... this is
not the time for a movie.

523
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,568
And it's not what you're here for.

524
01:23:10,298 --> 01:23:13,634
It's time to move on.

525
01:23:13,665 --> 01:23:15,566
C'mon old man...

526
01:23:15,964 --> 01:23:20,368
Forget about today, until tomorrow.

527
01:23:45,632 --> 01:23:50,269
Oil your hair, be a man.

528
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:54,167
I'm a man!

529
01:24:22,598 --> 01:24:24,199
What are we going to show?

530
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:29,100
This one.

531
01:25:19,565 --> 01:25:23,001
I've never seen them laugh so much.

532
01:25:46,799 --> 01:25:50,335
Go see what's wrong.

533
01:26:28,765 --> 01:26:30,967
Wrap him in this.

534
01:26:33,665 --> 01:26:35,967
But that's our screen.

535
01:26:36,998 --> 01:26:38,966
It's his now.

536
01:26:52,998 --> 01:26:55,367
We could show movies...

537
01:26:58,699 --> 01:27:00,700
He's got to sell his oil.

538
01:27:00,931 --> 01:27:02,599
We could do that too.

539
01:27:02,865 --> 01:27:04,700
Vishnu Talkies...

540
01:27:04,765 --> 01:27:06,566
Vishnu Hair Oil...

541
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:08,899
He has to go home.

542
01:27:09,931 --> 01:27:12,166
This could be our home.

543
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:17,666
We have our lives.

544
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,734
Our destinies.

545
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:27,567
Come on. It's time to go.

546
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:42,134
Hair oil massage.

547
01:29:50,865 --> 01:29:52,766
Try it once.

548
01:29:53,632 --> 01:29:55,667
Your life will begin.

549
01:29:55,899 --> 01:29:57,333
Go ahead.
