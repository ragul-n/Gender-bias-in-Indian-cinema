00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,850
My youth is a fireball,
my youth, my youth

4
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,590
Whoever comes to destroy it,
they will burn

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,290
Give me your heart unhesitatingly.
I'm not afraid of anyone

6
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,170
Those who clash with me
will repent

7
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,990
My youth is a fireball,
my youth, my youth

8
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,150
Whoever comes to destroy it,
they will burn

9
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,940
Raju!

10
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,760
Hey, Kalu!

11
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey, Raju!

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,720
Brother Raju, hey!

13
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,800
What is it, damn you?

14
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,970
Raju, see. Raju, see.

15
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,780
Have you seen that?

16
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,130
Shyama's.

17
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,670
- What?
- I say Shyama's coming.

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Wow, brother!

19
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,180
Am I some watchman of your sister?

20
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,410
- Shyama!
- Hey!

21
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,366
She's gone home, son.

22
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,660
- Home?
- Yes.

23
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,920
- But let me know after all what...
- Hey, wait! Listen to me!

24
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,520
Where is Nagesh?

25
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,010
Shyama!

26
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
Hey, Shyama!

27
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,770
Shyama!

28
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,500
Take a look.
See it with your own eyes.

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,170
The cheat you love will
be someone else's tomorrow.

30
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,860
Tomorrow your Kishore
is getting engaged.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,540
To a rich man's daughter.

32
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,340
I tried to reason with you
but you didn't understand.

33
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,460
After all,
this rascal deceived you.

34
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,720
Brother!

35
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,490
You know, people don't value
compassion any longer.

36
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,100
They only recognize money.
Wealth.

37
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,420
What do you have?

38
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,760
It's said this girl's father
is the wealthiest in the city.

39
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,310
He has millions, huge houses...

40
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,340
and has everything
money can buy.

41
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,550
You don't like this either?

42
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,160
But I'm asking you what's the
reason for this, Kamla?

43
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,530
Three times this joke
has been played out.

44
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,530
Any boy I choose,
you refuse him!

45
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,250
Have you chosen someone else?

46
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,820
What? No, papa.

47
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,520
Uncle, the thing is,
you take this as a game.

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,536
- A game?
- I mean, you don't even give her a chance.

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,860
- Chance?
- Yes, chance.

50
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,686
After all, she's human, too.

51
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,580
She wants that two hearts
should first meet...

52
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,950
and have some happy
and sad moments.

53
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,290
- Meaning, some romance and love should develop.
- What?

54
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,390
But dad, I, too, am a human.
I, too, have a heart within me.

55
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,960
I want that one should be
in love before marriage.

56
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Idiot, has your father ever loved,
that you'll have that?

57
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,566
But, dad, what I say, too, is...

58
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,200
I don't want to hear anything.

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,770
Diwan Bahadur Ramcharan Das
isn't such a fool, Bimla...

60
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,020
that he'll hand over his daughter
and wealth to any damn fellow.

61
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,190
Idiot, it's property worth millions.

62
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,060
- Oh yes, but is wealth everything...
- Look...

63
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,120
if you do otherwise...

64
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,870
I'll skin you.

65
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,290
Do you understand?

66
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,230
Lala Shobharam!

67
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,230
Sir!

68
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,720
I'm making that idiot of a son of yours,
my resident-son-in-law...

69
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,060
because your family
background is good.

70
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,180
And in my eyes, a high family
is a big consideration.

71
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,970
Though I am aware...

72
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
that you are especially greedy...

73
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,430
and are ready to sell your son
just for a few pieces of silver.

74
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,390
- No, sir...
- Keep quiet!

75
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,550
Listen to me first.

76
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,240
Yes, sir. Of course.

77
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,890
You are aware that Kamla
is my only daughter.

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,280
And after me she will become the heiress.

79
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,050
This is not only her good fortune...

80
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,900
but also her misfortune.

81
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,030
That's why I want to repeat
a few of my conditions again.

82
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,400
Yes, sir, you can of course...

83
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,230
I recognize you very well.

84
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,810
Yes, the first condition is...

85
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,760
that after the engagement you'll
not have any right over my property...

86
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,500
or on your foolish son.

87
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,190
You are selling him and
I am buying him.

88
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,230
- But, sir, how could...
- If and but won't do Lala.

89
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,450
Say either yes or no.

90
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,930
Yes, sir, but...

91
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,800
Again the same 'but'?
I'm not used to such nonsense.

92
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,080
If the terms aren't acceptable,
then take away your son.

93
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,190
Sir, how can this be?

94
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,770
I agree to every term.
I accept.

95
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,380
Wedding rituals

96
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,150
Uncle!

97
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,230
Uncle, come immediately!

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,646
Kamla has suddenly
taken seriously ill!

99
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,756
What?

100
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,060
And even after it you snatch my
husband on the strength of money...

101
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,940
remember you will suffer
all your life.

102
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,270
You won't lose him even
for a day...

103
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,730
not even a moment. A moment!

104
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,650
I'm asking what happened
to her so suddenly?

105
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,510
She was perfectly fine
till this morning.

106
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,980
Kamla. Dear Kamla!

107
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,320
You don't know.

108
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,370
You always calling to Lalaji.

109
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,040
He came here.

110
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,910
That's why I didn't
understand anything...

111
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,910
and when I understood,
then I saw that...

112
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,840
that's why I called you
on some pretext.

113
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,240
There were so many people
sitting there, tell us...

114
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,870
why are you throwing him
a in dark well knowingly.

115
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,160
- Tell us!
- Kamla!

116
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,530
First, tell me his name.

117
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,330
- Name?
- Name.

118
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,730
Name?

119
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,190
- Yes, name.
- I haven't asked his name yet.

120
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,620
After all who is he?
Where does he stay?

121
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,890
Where did he come from
and when he came, why run?

122
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,460
I didn't ask anything, papa.

123
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,820
I didn't ask anything, papa!

124
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,510
Don't make excuses, Kamla.

125
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,449
I know you don't like Kishore.

126
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,170
But now I wonder
if something else isn't going on.

127
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,610
- No, papa. that man was really...
- Tell me the truth Kamla.

128
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,230
Have you promised
to marry someone else?

129
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,220
- No, papa.
- You're exactly right, uncle.

130
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,050
Actually, she loves a
handsome man.

131
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,000
And both have committed
to marry.

132
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,920
No, papa. No.
What are you saying?

133
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,260
You shut up.

134
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,566
And this young man isn't
interested in your wealth.

135
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,760
He didn't even know
she was your daughter.

136
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,316
No, papa.
This a white lie.

137
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
Don't lie!

138
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,470
- Sunder!
- Sir!

139
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,280
Ask Lala to meet me tomorrow.

140
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,880
But sir, this auspicious time...

141
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,780
Let it go to hell!

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,570
I don't understand how
you could tell such a big lie.

143
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,270
The time is such, sister...

144
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,650
that the truth pours water
into the home of lies.

145
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,820
But now think of some name.

146
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,110
- Name?
- Yes, name, address, everything.

147
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,430
If he asks who he is,
where he's from, then what?

148
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,770
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

149
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,940
Perhaps you don't know...

150
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,730
that during the time
of your grandfather...

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,340
if anyone had said
such a shameless thing...

152
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,120
his tongue would have
been pulled out.

153
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,210
And I, too, don't expect this
from my own child.

154
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,580
I'm surprised...

155
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,270
that despite being my daughter
and the education I gave you...

156
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,100
- How long have you known him?
- Rajkumar Saxena.

157
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,780
What?

158
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,300
That's his name, uncle.
Rajkumar Saxena.

159
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,060
Rajkumar Saxena.

160
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,120
- His family?
- What's to say about his family?

161
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,120
He's rich, of royal ancestry.

162
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
Right, Kamla?

163
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,630
- Age?
- That would be hardly 24-25.

164
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
Right, Kamla?

165
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay, I wish to meet that young man.

166
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,750
- This very day.
- Today?

167
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,700
Actually, presently he's in Burma.

168
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,230
- Burma?
- Burma.

169
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,140
He has his father's business there.
Right, Bimla?

170
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,316
- When does he return?
- After four or five...

171
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,610
- After a month.
- One month?

172
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,460
I can't wait more than
fifteen days.

173
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,680
Wire him immediately...

174
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,680
that he should return within
fifteen days and meet me.

175
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,080
Okay, grandpa. Okay.

176
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,610
But keep in mind...

177
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,840
this Rajkumar Saxena...

178
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,910
if he doesn't return in fifteen days,
I won't wait a day longer.

179
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,590
Got it?

180
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,240
- Sunder!
- Sir.

181
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,870
Call Lala soon.

182
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,590
And ask the priest...

183
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,660
to find another date
for the engagement.

184
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,310
- Got it?
- Yes.

185
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,046
Now tell me.

186
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,206
What's there? Come with me to
the club. You'll find everything.

187
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,630
Everything will be fine.

188
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,150
Let everything be right.

189
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,130
There are a thousand young men
in the city and you can't find anyone?

190
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,870
The man you're looking for...

191
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,620
he'll show up at the very place.

192
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,490
Just you wait.

193
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,460
No!

194
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:36,110
Oh, my love, my love

195
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,320
Oh, my darling, my darling

196
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,950
Darling, oh my darling

197
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,570
Oh, my darling

198
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,280
- I and you.
- My darling

199
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,690
- You and I.
- My darling

200
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,400
I and you, let's both be together

201
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,720
With eyes in eyes
and hands entwined

202
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,170
I and you

203
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,730
My darling

204
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,640
You and I

205
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,240
My darling

206
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,710
I and you, let's both be together

207
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,170
With eyes in eyes
and hands entwined

208
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,660
Let the envious be jealous,
whoever they are

209
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,690
I and you, let's both be together

210
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,910
Come my dashing darling, come

211
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,770
Pour the nectar from your eyes,
darling come

212
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,940
The atmosphere is alluring,
the night is intoxicating

213
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,566
And the youth, too, is at its peak,
come

214
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,760
My darling, oh my darling

215
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,470
Let the envious be jealous,
whoever they are

216
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,260
I and you, let's both be together

217
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,730
With eyes in eyes
and hands entwined

218
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,350
Let the envious be jealous,
whoever they are

219
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,190
The heart is full of romance

220
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,020
I am yours and you are mine

221
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,580
The heart is full of romance

222
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,990
Because you are mine
and I am yours

223
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:04,830
My inviting eyes, silky arms
invite you, come my love

224
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,130
- Oh my darling.
- Oh my darling

225
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,610
Let the envious be jealous,
whoever they are

226
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,470
I and you,
let's both be together

227
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,840
With eyes in eyes
and hands entwined

228
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,280
Let the envious be jealous,
whoever they are

229
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,480
- My darling.
- My darling

230
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,460
But running won't do.

231
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,266
Do you know how many days
are left?

232
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,130
I told you I can't do this.
Can't do it.

233
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,570
How won't it happen?

234
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,840
Just take a good look at this.

235
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,690
- Who's he?
- Mathur.

236
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,360
- Mathur?
He's a very honest man.

237
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,830
If you say, I'll make the offer.

238
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,690
Damn you!

239
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,459
- Hey, Sunder?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,700
I'll tell papa tomorrow.

241
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,150
Oh?

242
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,670
Yes, I'll tell him.

243
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,030
You're a liar.

244
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,380
Lies?

245
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,360
Now you dare accuse me of lying?

246
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,679
- Sir, I mean...
- I understand what you mean.

247
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,960
My daughter, if she lies to me
I'll shoot her.

248
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,616
Got it?

249
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,310
That's young man's name
is Rajkumar Saxena.

250
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,650
When he's here,
take a good look at him.

251
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,416
But I'm sure...

252
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,080
that he'll be better than
your idiot son.

253
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,300
He's staying at the Hotel Empire.

254
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,290
Pay him a lot of money
to act a prince.

255
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,990
And suppose papa
really marries me off to him?

256
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,640
If it comes to that,
then we'll see.

257
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,010
We'll see...

258
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,200
If he isn't approved, then pay
a thousand rupees more...

259
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,220
to make him go away.
Then you're free.

260
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,700
He'll go away?

261
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,490
People will do anything for money.

262
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,676
But look...

263
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,400
first, don't give him your real name.

264
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,310
Tell him Sushila or something.

265
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,930
Sushila?

266
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,200
My dear, one should be careful
in such matters.

267
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,890
I don't like such matters.
Not at all.

268
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,240
Kamla, have you had a reply
from the Burma man?

269
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,710
Yes! Yes papa, don't worry.

270
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,490
He'll be here at the last moment.
What say you, Kamla?

271
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,810
Yes.

272
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,770
You heard?

273
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,380
Look, the new deadline is the 24th.

274
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,360
If Rajkumar isn't here,
then it's Kishori Singh.

275
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,230
But this date won't be postponed.
Got it?

276
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,830
Come.

277
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Now what will happen, Sushila?

278
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,400
Okay, explain.
What will I do in Burma?

279
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,630
Not Burma.
The work is right here in Bombay

280
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,886
Really?

281
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,090
You see,
the job isn't difficult...

282
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,826
but you have to promise
one thing.

283
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,950
Promise?

284
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,150
Yes.

285
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,060
- Whatever I say...
- Yes.

286
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,100
No one should know.

287
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,590
I see.

288
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,310
- Look, Mr. Mathur...
- Madam, I understand completely.

289
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,610
But...

290
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,400
Money?

291
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,750
Don't worry about the money.

292
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,830
Here, a thousand bucks.
An advance, right now.

293
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,920
But...

294
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,540
First the job, then the money.

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,690
Oh, wonderful.

296
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,630
Okay, tell me, what's the job?

297
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,690
Job? Oh, job!
You see...

298
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,970
I am...

299
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,130
- I mean you are...
- Of course, me.

300
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,630
- Mr. Mathur.
- Yes.

301
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,620
Can you lie?

302
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,060
Lie?

303
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,440
Yes, the thing is, Mr. Mathur...

304
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,930
Rani!

305
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,300
But I say it from the heart...

306
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,390
I don't like it so cheap.

307
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,610
Johnny?

308
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,370
Mathur isn't found anywhere
but here.

309
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,020
Of course, no place.

310
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,350
- Boy!
- Boy!

311
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,230
Won't you have something to eat?

312
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,596
No, I am...

313
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,820
- Please!
- Please!

314
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,070
Johnny!

315
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,560
Hey, boy!

316
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,310
Boy, bring four meals.

317
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,746
Make it quick.

318
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,966
But mister...

319
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,906
Madam, I was here first...

320
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,550
so you're my guests.

321
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,390
- What would you like?
- What?

322
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,080
- Of course, but...
- Well, how nice.

323
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,820
- I love to meet new people.
- Yeah, love to.

324
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,210
Johnny?

325
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,660
Meet myself, Gwen Fernandez.

326
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,630
How do you do?

327
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,630
I just remembered something
from long ago.

328
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,830
When I met Johnny
for the first time...

329
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,370
In a Chinese hotel.

330
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,080
Someone took my purse.

331
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,110
- Hello!
- I'm very sorry, very sorry.

332
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,140
You'd better take care of your purse,
lest it gets lost.

333
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,520
I'll be back in few minutes.

334
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,610
- Wait, listen to me...
Let's sit here. He'll be back.

335
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,580
Johnny. Johnny?

336
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,966
Johnny, my money!

337
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,366
- Five hundred rupees!
- Rupees?

338
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,290
Where is that man?
Where that rascal gone?

339
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,100
Rascal!
Hey, Mr. Rascal!

340
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,630
Johnny!

341
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,180
Johnny, you...

342
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,960
- Call the manager.
- What, manager?

343
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,950
Manager!
Hey, manager! Manager!

344
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,360
What, some pebble in the food?

345
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,400
- No.
- What happened?

346
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,990
No, please, no sir.
Just I was...

347
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,380
I don't want anything. I want
my money. 500 rupees.

348
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,590
- Will you listen to me?
- I won't listen to anyone.

349
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,016
I'll go to police.

350
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,110
No, I don't know her.
I don't know him at all.

351
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,420
- He stole my thousand rupees too.
- You're lying.

352
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,250
You're his partner. You know him.
I'll hand you over to the polics.

353
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,400
Police!

354
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,580
Yes, Ms. Sushila?

355
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,930
To start with, I doubt
your real name is Sushila.

356
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,830
Secondly, you don't want
even to reveal your father's name.

357
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,960
What's this have to do
with my father?

358
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,300
Look, if you don't believe me,
here are my ornaments.

359
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,560
My necklace, my bracelets.

360
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,300
- My necklace is worth five thousand.
- Five thousand?

361
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,340
I don't want your necklace.

362
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,270
I want my money, you know.

363
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,870
- Then you don't get your money. Look...
- Why not?

364
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,030
Quiet.

365
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,400
I have told you...
I told you I don't know the man.

366
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,030
- Quite, please.
- I don't know the man.

367
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,500
Please, Miss, don't...

368
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,130
- What do you think of yourself?
- Sushila!

369
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,100
See, if you don't give the name
and address of your father...

370
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,640
we'll have to put you in lock up.

371
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,710
Lock up?

372
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,390
- Constable!
- Sir.

373
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,410
Inspector, my father...

374
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,000
- My father would kill me.
- Madam, please.

375
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,900
Don't cry. Sushila!

376
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,580
Hey, bring water quickly.

377
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,860
Bring water.

378
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,990
Inspector, sir...

379
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,640
my papa's name is...

380
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,780
Sushila?

381
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,400
Sushila, I told you many times...

382
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,760
to keep your distance
from gentlemen cheats.

383
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,580
Inspector, this poor girl is
unnecessarily implicated.

384
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,990
I'll compensate the loss.

385
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,630
How much is it, madam?

386
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,110
Five hundred rupees.

387
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,470
Speak softly. I'm not deaf.

388
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,820
Five hundred rupees!

389
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,230
- Here's your money.
- But first tell me who you are.

390
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,160
Me? I'm Sushila's uncle.

391
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,850
- Uncle?
- Yes, dear.

392
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,010
Don't worry.
I'll get you released right now.

393
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,566
Here, take it.

394
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,770
Count it, one, two...

395
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,040
Three, four, five.

396
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,270
Here you are.
Are you happy now?

397
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,300
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

398
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,690
- Uncle?
Come dear. Let's go home.

399
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,420
Uncle?

400
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,450
Yeah, uncle.

401
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,340
No, Sushila.
It was my duty.

402
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,200
If a man doesn't come to
assist a man, will a demon come?

403
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,190
Come, I'll drop you at home.

404
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,580
- Where do you live?
Me? I stay at...

405
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,190
- Where do you stay?
- Empire Hotel.

406
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,960
Okay, then I'll return
your money tomorrow.

407
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,380
- Bye.
- How will you get home?

408
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,810
- I'll make it.
- Sushila.

409
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,936
Don't you worry,
my home is close by.

410
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,460
Yes, but listen to me.

411
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,570
Go carefully, Sushila.
Want to give your life?

412
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,980
See you.

413
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,620
Uncle.

414
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,830
You saved me twice.

415
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,600
I won't forget you
for as long as I live.

416
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,390
Uncle!

417
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,500
Have you ever been to Burma?

418
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,190
- Burma?
- Actually, the thing is I'm...

419
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,120
Okay, I'll tell you tomorrow,
at your hotel.

420
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,390
Very well. I will wait.

421
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,850
Okay? Ta ta.

422
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,540
Ta ta.

423
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,200
Hello!

424
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,930
Library.

425
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,320
Vimla!

426
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,960
Do you know why Kamla
is so sad these days?

427
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,390
Sad?

428
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,440
I notice recently
you two are up to something.

429
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,710
Will Rajkumar Saxena not come?

430
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,320
Of course, why won't he come?

431
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,536
- Why won't he come?
- Then what's the matter?

432
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,340
The thing is...

433
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,600
we are afraid, when he comes...

434
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,590
you might not like him.

435
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,400
- Like?
- Yes.

436
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,650
Dear, instead I'm very happy...

437
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,770
that man really likes my child...

438
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,460
and not merely my wealth.

439
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,860
Vimla!

440
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,930
I'm very eager to meet that
man from Burma.

441
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,320
I, too, am very anxious to meet him.

442
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,130
Will every man
turn out to be bad?

443
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,910
What's to worry about in this?

444
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,780
If I were you, I would have
chosen instantly.

445
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,210
Look at him.

446
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,620
Preetam Pande. How is he?

447
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
Hey, Kamla!

448
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Hey, listen!
What are you doing?

449
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,570
Preetam Pande...

450
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,100
Right now I'll go
and tell papa everything.

451
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,990
Kamla!

452
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,130
Oh my God!

453
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,750
- Papa, that guy from Burma...
- Has he come?

454
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,660
Is he here from Burma?

455
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,840
No. Not yet.

456
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,340
But he'll be here soon. Certainly.

457
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,200
He'll be here before the date.

458
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,910
- Payal?
- Yes, sir?

459
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,770
I'm asking, is Kamla well?

460
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,070
She is fine, sir.

461
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,360
Why are you so scared?

462
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,450
In this guise even his
father won't recognize him.

463
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,930
Remember, you're my maid.
Got it?

464
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,650
- Maid.
- Bravo.

465
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,720
Okay, take a good look.
He's coming.

466
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,830
Is he the Preetam Pande?

467
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,120
And he's willing?

468
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,100
If I ask him to jump in a river,
he would and die.

469
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,330
- But first ask him?
- 'But' won't do. You agree?

470
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,470
Okay, fine!

471
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,260
Bravo, maid! Well done.

472
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,730
Here's 100 rupees tip.
I'll be back.

473
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,160
But, maid...

474
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,780
Beware of loafers.

475
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,610
Here's some roasted nuts.

476
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,700
Okay. Here's the money.

477
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,400
100 rupees?
Give me change.

478
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,170
- But I don't have...
- Take this one anna and get going.

479
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,980
- What are you staring at?
- You?

480
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,570
- Me?
- I've seen you many times.

481
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,010
- Where?
- Right here.

482
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,260
I often come here.

483
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,170
And when I come I fall asleep.

484
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,770
And when I sleep I have a dream.

485
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,750
Always the same dream.

486
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,316
You know who comes in
that dream?

487
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,436
Who?

488
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,660
- You.
- Me?

489
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,680
The same eyes.

490
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,600
The same features.

491
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,530
Same voice.

492
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,956
Are you married?

493
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,440
What? No.

494
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,500
Thank god.

495
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,840
I, too, am still a bachelor.

496
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,360
- But...
- But I've been dreaming of you for a year.

497
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,420
Waiting for you for a year.

498
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,960
And now you're here.

499
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,950
Haven't you ever seen me
in your dreams?

500
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,090
No. Never.

501
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,240
I don't want to.
Understand?

502
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,540
Just that.

503
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,880
Hey, wait, listen to me.

504
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,090
Hey, what's your name?

505
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,910
Hey, mister!
See, she's leaving.

506
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,940
What do you want?

507
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,720
One anna coin.

508
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,900
Here, take it.

509
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,020
But stop following me.

510
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,190
Now what?
Why are you after me?

511
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,070
Can't you find any other place?

512
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,980
Here, 99 rupees 15 annas.

513
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,190
And this place isn't
that of your father. Got it?

514
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,820
Ramdulari. Did you see the maid?

515
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,160
Considers herself a fairy angel.

516
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,130
Mister, I don't want
to talk to you. Got it?

517
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,720
Hey, I'm talking to this monkey.

518
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,580
Because we're old friends.

519
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,240
Any objection?

520
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,250
Wow, what a killing walk!

521
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,530
If had such a beloved,
it would be wonderful

522
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,770
Heard it Dulari?

523
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,440
If had such a beloved,
it would be wonderful

524
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,510
I'm attracted by your enmity

525
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,720
Okay, Dulari, let's go.

526
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,500
We'll meet tomorrow.
Same place.

527
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,590
I told this to the monkey.
Not you.

528
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:06,370
Where will you go,
where will you?

529
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,870
How do I forget?

530
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,120
Cool breezes blow in gusts

531
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:54,170
The ambiance is young,
you are here, how do I forget?

532
00:34:54,310 --> 00:35:00,820
Cool breeze, come and soothe

533
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:07,390
The ambiance is young,
you are here, how do I forget?

534
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,760
Cool breezes

535
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,240
How do I forget?

536
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,510
The moon and stars,
beautiful scenes

537
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,380
They all create magic
in my heart

538
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,940
Cool breeze, come and soothe

539
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:02,860
The ambiance is young,
you are here, how do I forget?

540
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,980
Cool breezes

541
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,530
How do I forget?

542
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,990
I can't even say it.
I can't stay without saying, either

543
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,810
When your eyes meet mine,
I blush

544
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:51,350
Cool breeze, come and soothe

545
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:58,170
The ambiance is young,
you are here, how do I forget?

546
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,780
Cool breezes

547
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,710
How do I forget?

548
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:31,410
Even the heart doesn't know
its own tale

549
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:38,090
How do I let you know
what my heart feels for you?

550
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:44,270
Cool breeze, come and soothe

551
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:51,580
The ambiance is young,
you are here, how do I forget?

552
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,490
Cool breeze...

553
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,200
How do I forget?

554
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,230
Perhaps the guy from Burma is here.

555
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,930
I say, what's his name?

556
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,400
- I don't know.
- Don't know?

557
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,100
But who is he?
Where's he from?

558
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,280
I didn't ask anything.

559
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,680
Then this man must be
very dangerous, Kamla.

560
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,200
Yes, the man does seem very dangerous.

561
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,580
Oh, so the desire to meet
has brought you here?

562
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,380
I'm not here to meet you.
Get it?

563
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,060
I see.

564
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,390
Then, good bye.

565
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,340
- Hey, wait! Wait.
- Speak.

566
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,260
I... I want to ask you something.

567
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,240
But... Okay, what's your name?

568
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,340
My name?
Rajkumar Saxena.

569
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,990
Rajkumar Saxena?

570
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,980
You mean you're afraid
of my name, too?

571
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,860
No. No, wait.

572
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,620
Have you come from Burma somehow?

573
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,400
Yeah, I was in Burma for four years.
Four years.

574
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,730
No. No!

575
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,506
A very strange girl!

576
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,550
Hey, why do you keep saying no?
Hey!

577
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,470
Hey! Get out of the water!
C'mon!

578
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,940
Give me your hand and come out.

579
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,240
Hey! Hey!

580
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,030
No, sir. He is in town.

581
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,576
Bimla was telling me...

582
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,470
he'll be here to see you
today or tomorrow.

583
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,110
Bimla!

584
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,120
I'm asking, has the man
from Burma arrived?

585
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,320
Sure. What else?

586
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,650
Okay, where has Kamla gone today?

587
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,410
What... She's gone to fetch him.

588
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,836
Oh.

589
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,490
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps? Where?

590
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,216
You mean where?

591
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,120
Hey, I want to know where
she's gone to get him.

592
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,050
Oh! Where!

593
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,480
She must have gone to
bring him somewhere...

594
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,530
In some village...

595
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,930
Shaila! Oh Shaila!

596
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,090
Nobody here!

597
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,030
Come on, it's only us here.

598
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,940
Come.

599
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,030
Come on.

600
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,010
Go in. Take off your clothes
and hide.

601
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,560
I mean, change into something else.

602
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,670
Listen!

603
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,240
Will anyone come here?

604
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,260
No, madam.
Who'd be so unfortunate?

605
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,520
Wait, listen.

606
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,220
You... I...

607
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,170
Look, you have to change
clothes on your own.

608
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,310
I can't help you with that..
Got it?

609
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,390
Where will you take me?

610
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,136
Hey, what are watching?

611
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,240
Haven't you ever seen a girl?
Come on, get going.

612
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,560
Go. Go.

613
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,340
Ok, Vimla.
How is that man?

614
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,880
Have you seen him?

615
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,410
Yeah, a glimpse.

616
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,060
Glimpse?

617
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,900
I mean, from a distance.

618
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,570
Oh.

619
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,790
Okay, how does he look?

620
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,960
Good, tall and well built...

621
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,500
a real manly type.

622
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,530
Where will you take me?

623
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,500
Where will you take me?

624
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:07,600
O my tormentor darling,
where will you take me

625
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,400
Wow! What a change!

626
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,330
Like the female monkey has
covered herself with pajamas.

627
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,470
Why, you said nobody
will come here?

628
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,510
Who said I wouldn't come, too?

629
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,810
- But who was that man?
- Which man?

630
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,420
How would I know?

631
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,940
Must be some loafer like you.

632
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,080
Like me?
Oh, that fellow!

633
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,670
Look, things here will be
this way.

634
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,850
Leave if you don't like it.

635
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,140
The door is that way.

636
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,740
And if you like...

637
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,670
have some tea.

638
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,470
Here take this, flowers.

639
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,700
Why the flowers?

640
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,000
Flowers?

641
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,280
For no reason.

642
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,870
No specific reason.

643
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,300
Hey, these clothes,
why are they scattered?

644
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,680
You're a maid.

645
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,850
You can't even do your own work?
How'd you work for a lady?

646
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,516
Come, get to work.

647
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,040
- But I had...
- Come on!

648
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,690
Don't worry.
This man is our landlord.

649
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,260
- What?
- Yes.

650
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,040
He's very wealthy.

651
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,470
But has only one offspring.
That, too, a girl.

652
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,210
- Yeah?
- Yes.

653
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,340
Has a place to stay in...

654
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,390
where three hundred could stay
but only three...

655
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,376
at the moment.

656
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,360
Do you know him?

657
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,070
Me?

658
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,110
This picture is cut from a
newspaper and pasted here.

659
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,810
Every morning and evening
I take a look at him.

660
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,070
And tell myself, "Raju"...

661
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,000
"do whatever you like but never
become loathful like him."

662
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,400
Such people have ruined
the nation.

663
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,190
- Do you know him?
- Me?

664
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,340
No.

665
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,430
As he is here, and you
have seen him...

666
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,790
Kamla has gone to receive him.
So, where is staying?

667
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,990
He might not have arrived yet.

668
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,260
Hasn't come?

669
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,880
What?

670
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,620
Actually, he keeps coming and going.

671
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,380
He has no particular
place to stay.

672
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,220
But the man is excellent.

673
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,900
- What?
- Kamla becomes docile with him.

674
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,830
Okay, tell me.
Where do you stay?

675
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,540
What? In my house.

676
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,800
Really? Your parents are alive?

677
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,470
- Have no mother.
- Father?

678
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,896
- Father is there.
- What's he do?

679
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,930
- What?
- I asked what your father does.

680
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,510
Does?

681
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,050
He doesn't do anything.

682
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,040
So, he's jobless?

683
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,190
Of course, the country
is facing lots of joblessness.

684
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,400
That's why you have to work, right?

685
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,040
Yes.

686
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,290
When I returned from Burma,
I was jobless royally.

687
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,510
I had no meals,
or even a shelter overhead.

688
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,940
I went to roaming the streets
on an empty stomach.

689
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,780
I had water for dinner and slept.

690
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,370
Know where?

691
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,360
On the footpath.

692
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,860
Have you ever sleep on the footpath?

693
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,040
Hey!

694
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,040
What? No, not yet.

695
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,280
Are you crying?

696
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,996
No.

697
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,420
- What's your name?
- Kamla.

698
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,860
Kamla?

699
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,110
- Yes... no...
- Wow, strange!

700
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,480
It's strange, sir.

701
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,420
You don't know when he left,
when he returned...

702
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,470
or where he's lodging?
Okay, where do his parents live?

703
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:29,210
Actually...
he's alone in this world.

704
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,510
He's alone...

705
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,890
- Alone?
- Yes.

706
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,250
Is he totally alone?

707
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,390
Yes.

708
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,410
And this outfit, I wear it.

709
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,810
Any objections?

710
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,430
Whose clothes are these?

711
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,090
- Shama's.
- Who is Shama?

712
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,720
A girl.

713
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,190
- Quite beautiful.
- What's she to you?

714
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,980
Who is she to you?

715
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,690
Why do you care?

716
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,550
No reason.

717
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,550
- Just like that.
- Now don't hide, tell me.

718
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,820
- Yes?
- Yes.

719
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,190
What do you think?

720
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,430
Ask from your heart.

721
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,930
Have you asked?

722
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,700
- What does it say?
- It says...

723
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,680
I'll tell you tomorrow.

724
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,610
Where, at the Rani Baug zoo?

725
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,790
I'll come here.

726
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,700
- May I?
- Oh!

727
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,790
So, now you're inviting yourself over?

728
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,320
Come on, come on.

729
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,410
Bimla!

730
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,740
I doubt that whatever
you've told me, everything is...

731
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,280
But uncle, I never said anything.

732
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,020
All this was my guess.

733
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,310
What? Just a guess?

734
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,870
Hey, where will you take me,
my tormentor?

735
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,530
Where will you take me...

736
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,406
Are you leaving?

737
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:15,536
Yes.

738
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,690
Your clothes are drying
and I'm going to work.

739
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,440
Apart from that, today I'm...
afraid of you.

740
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,700
Where will you take me...

741
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,070
Hey, are your intentions good?

742
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,456
Intentions?

743
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,030
I said, if you like something
tell me so.

744
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,120
Or it may happen you
flee with Shyama's clothes.

745
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,260
You think I'm a thief?

746
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,220
No, ma'am.
The fault is with my heart.

747
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:46,870
Bye.

748
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,070
Hey, I said bye.

749
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,180
Bye.

750
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,360
Yes. What a beautiful voice.

751
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,000
Bye.

752
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,330
Where will you take me,
my tormentor?

753
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,910
Where will you take me,
my tormentor?

754
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,220
Let your Rajkumar Saxena
go to hell!

755
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,540
I just want to know
where Kamla has gone!

756
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,410
Ooh! Kamla?

757
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,730
Don't panic uncle.
Don't worry at all.

758
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,580
In the end, everything
will turn out alright.

759
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:31,390
Alright? My foot!

760
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:43,830
At the watering place
it's our time to meet

761
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,246
The lass came swaying on the sly

762
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,970
Oh yes, yes, yes

763
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,916
Asking where her beloved was hiding

764
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,750
Oh yes, yes, yes

765
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,806
Oh, upon seeing him
she was beside herself

766
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,450
Oh yes, yes, yes

767
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,716
My heart has gone crazy.
It does not hold

768
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:19,800
At the watering place
it's our time to meet

769
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:01,810
Whose look has taken
my heart, my friends

770
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:14,620
Who is he who dwells in my heart
in such vivid colors?

771
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:23,220
I sing silently

772
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,610
He mingles in my heart silently

773
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,996
My heart has gone crazy
and won't be controlled

774
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:42,740
At the watering place
it's our time to meet

775
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:20,120
Today I am drowning
in someone's eyes

776
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:33,090
I am lost and have become
a part of someone

777
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,840
My anklets jingle

778
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,010
I have come to meet with
my beloved on the sly

779
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:03,136
My heart has gone crazy
and won't be controlled

780
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:10,130
At the watering place
it's our time to meet

781
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,300
Hey!

782
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,710
Look, whatever you think I am,
I'm not that.

783
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,840
- No?
- No.

784
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:24,400
And what I really am,
you won't understand.

785
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,780
Oh! But what I am...

786
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,680
not only you but your
grandparents, also, won't understand.

787
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,746
Hey, take off these clothes.

788
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,446
But I've made Shyama
understand everything.

789
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,570
Go.

790
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,030
Everyone...

791
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,650
Hey! Hey, stop!

792
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,170
Get hold of her. Catch her!

793
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,420
Hey, get hold of her!

794
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,070
Hey!

795
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,850
Hey, taxi!

796
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,890
Hey!

797
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,390
Hello!

798
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,036
Hello.

799
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,150
Hello.

800
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,570
Kamla?

801
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,050
It's me, Lala Shobhram.

802
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,660
When should we come tomorrow, sir?

803
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,520
You're a mule!

804
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,730
Yes, I'm a mule,
and so's your father.

805
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,360
What are you gawking at?

806
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,550
Hey, hold on!

807
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,750
Damn you, stop!

808
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,780
You taxi fellow!
Damn you stop!

809
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,280
She's taken my clothes.

810
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,000
Step on it.

811
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:03,510
If you would be my friend
then what will be wrong?

812
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,920
Drive faster.

813
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,530
Taxi driver, stop!

814
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,870
Hey, stop!

815
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,340
Better stop.

816
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,070
Sunder?

817
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,780
- Hey, Sunder!
- Coming, sir.

818
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,140
Have they arrived yet?

819
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,190
No, uncle, she didn't go anywhere.

820
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,760
Never went out?

821
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,760
Actually she's asleep
in her room upstairs.

822
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,160
Oh, so she's sleeping!

823
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,650
Yes.

824
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,220
Come.

825
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,420
She won't go with you.

826
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,940
Hello, who are you?

827
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,490
Yes, it's me, Diwan Bahdur.

828
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,300
Who are you?

829
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,090
What? lnspector?

830
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,270
You mean the police?

831
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,520
What did you say?

832
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,490
No, this can't happen.

833
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,280
My daughter behaved like this?

834
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,490
You are mistaken, mister!

835
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,680
No, sir. It's no mistake.

836
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,240
The jeweler says she's your daughter.

837
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:07,670
Recently she was brought
to my police station...

838
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,510
accused of theft.

839
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,460
What?

840
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,330
Yes, your daughter Sushila.

841
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,380
My daughter's name isn't Sushila.

842
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,820
Her name is Kamla.

843
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,550
Yes, Kamla, Kamla, Kamla!

844
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,390
Oh, so that damned maid
is your daughter?

845
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,946
- Sunder.
- Sir?

846
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,290
Who's that sage that showed up?

847
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,436
Who are you?

848
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,610
I am the one that
perhaps you are not.

849
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,150
I'm a human being.

850
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,280
Human!

851
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,060
Bring my specs. Let me see
this damned son of a human.

852
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,820
Don't bother, sir. Please don't.

853
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,150
I'm here to just say
something very normal.

854
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,430
And it is that you daughter
is a number one liar.

855
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,290
Cheater.

856
00:58:58,790 --> 00:58:59,876
Thief.

857
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,440
- She robbed my house.
- What? Robbed?

858
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,340
Sir, your specs.

859
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,970
What nonsense is this?

860
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,910
It can never happen.

861
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,946
You give your name first.

862
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:12,210
Ask your daughter.
She knows everything.

863
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,570
But you'd better be quick,
or else I'll go to the police.

864
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,560
- Sir, he seems to be some loafer.
- Shut up.

865
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,070
Bimla! Call Kamla immediately.

866
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,620
- Hello.
- Hello, hospital?

867
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,810
I say, are you speaking
from the hospital?

868
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,940
I happen to have lost
a friend of mine.

869
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:42,110
No, I'm speaking from the mad house.

870
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,080
Okay. What?

871
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,820
Hey, is she the same girl?

872
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,190
It's the same girl,
but she looks different.

873
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,140
- Is she the thief?
- Sir.

874
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,840
What did she steal?

875
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,920
Though she stole plenty,
but now what to tell you?

876
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,320
There's one most valuable thing...

877
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:06,100
that I must get back, madam.

878
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,170
- Right now.
- What is it?

879
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,380
My heart.

880
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,530
Shut up, or
I'll pull out your tongue.

881
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,080
Ask her, sir.

882
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,270
Kamla, do you know this man?

883
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,950
Kamla, I'm asking
if you've ever seen this man before.

884
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:29,930
No, papa.

885
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,350
- Sunder!
- Sir.

886
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,490
Kick this fellow out.

887
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,250
Liar, cheater, deceiver!

888
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,316
Get hold of this hooligan.
Throw him out. Grab him!

889
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,236
If you ever return,
I'll hand you over to the police.

890
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,660
Take him. Take him.

891
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,000
Nab him.

892
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,360
Never dare again!

893
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,490
Get him out.

894
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,950
Sir, today is the last day.

895
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:38,040
Yes, I'm also aware of it.

896
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,420
Yet I'm Kamla's father.

897
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:42,350
Got it?

898
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:43,810
Not her enemy.

899
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,540
Yes, sir. But if today...

900
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,400
I've given them till nine this evening.

901
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:51,286
Today till nine?

902
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:52,410
Yes.

903
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,150
These girls aren't fooling everyone.

904
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,870
But I want to see what
she does after all.

905
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,950
Listen.

906
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,430
Preetam Pande!

907
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,540
Hey.

908
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,900
I say forget it.
It won't work.

909
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:18,130
If your uncle comes to know
he's Rajkumar, he'll shoot.

910
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,490
You and me both.

911
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,220
Hey, why are you scared?

912
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,496
There's still
the rest of the day left.

913
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,150
Okay, I'll try
to figure something out.

914
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,590
But you stay put here.
Got it?

915
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,520
Bye, bye.

916
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:32,090
Hey, listen, listen and have fun

917
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:36,450
Have fun. It's time of youth.
Sway

918
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:58,330
This life is like waves.
The world is an affair of just a few days

919
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,610
What has anyone gained
if he hasn't played the game of love?

920
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:21,570
Have fun. It's time of youth.
Sway

921
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:49,020
However, the time
that's gone by never returns

922
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,930
However hard you wish

923
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:06,440
The present is ours dear.
Who knows what will be tomorrow?

924
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,350
Have fun. It's time of youth.
Sway

925
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:39,860
My days are golden, my love,
and the nights are silvery

926
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:58,820
Lest this alluring atmosphere pass,
so my love hears my heart throb

927
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:07,740
Have fun. It's time of youth.
Sway

928
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,470
Kamla, listen!

929
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:48,260
Hey, Kamla?

930
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,670
Kamla, where are you going?

931
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,840
Hey, where are you going,
listen to me.

932
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,880
Look who I've brought along.
Kamla!

933
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,680
Everyone knows, madam,
parking charges are five annas.

934
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,830
Where will you take me...

935
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,460
oh my tormentor's eyes?

936
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,360
Hey, push. Push.

937
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,130
Halt. Here it is.

938
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,860
Madam is here.

939
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:18,950
Hey, mechanic!
Mechanic!

940
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:21,180
- Is someone here?
- Nobody is here, madam.

941
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,460
He must have gone for tea.

942
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,139
Yes, must have gone for tea.

943
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:27,679
Look, do one thing.

944
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,510
Go and call the mechanic.

945
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:32,469
And here's the money.

946
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:36,670
Hey, it's mine...

947
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,550
These garage guy is strange.

948
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:43,229
He hasn't provided
even a place to sit.

949
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:45,809
Oh!

950
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,320
Such a dirty place.

951
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:56,840
Hey.

952
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:00,589
Hey, you're hiding here?

953
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,030
Mechanic!

954
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:07,340
I want you to slide out.
I have no time.

955
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,100
I've been yelling for you for so long.
Haven't you heard?

956
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,810
Are you deaf? You beast!

957
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,370
Look, my car's engine
has stalled. You take a look.

958
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:23,800
So, you need repairs, madam?

959
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,390
Come.

960
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:31,169
What?

961
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:33,460
Hey, listen.

962
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,180
And if you don't believe,
then take this.

963
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:42,819
Here take this.
I was coming to you. To your home.

964
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,980
To your house.

965
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,510
Whatever happened yesterday
wasn't mine but your fault.

966
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,930
I had explained
everything to Shyama.

967
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,010
And I... I personally wanted
to introduce you to my papa.

968
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,640
But you, like a crazy man,
entered my house.

969
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,850
I'm asking, what was the hurry?

970
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,076
And if you had to come...

971
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,940
you should have groomed
yourself first.

972
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:28,470
Two rupees eight annas, madam.

973
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,200
Yes.

974
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,860
I...

975
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:45,030
This... can I give you this?

976
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,720
Two rupees eight annas.

977
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,780
I have nothing but this.

978
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,860
That's the problem.

979
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,580
You have nothing but that.

980
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,880
But that doesn't work, madam.

981
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,396
- Can you eat it?
- No.

982
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,920
- Can you wear it?
- No.

983
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:21,086
You can throw it and
make a man an animal...

984
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,870
but can paste it and
drive your father's car?

985
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:25,970
- No.
- No.

986
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,480
You need a laborer for it.

987
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,150
But a laborer, with money.

988
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,340
A laborer too is a human being.
Madam...

989
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,430
not an animal.

990
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:47,180
Now, go and ask your father
what all this means.

991
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,660
Where will you take me...

992
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,540
oh tormenting eyes?

993
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:04,260
Where will you take me
oh tormenting eyes?

994
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,630
Is it my fault my papa is wealthy?

995
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,370
Am I not a human being?

996
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,360
- My pain, my sorrows, are they nothing?
- Enough!

997
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:37,680
Who hasn't a problem
in this world, madam?

998
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,450
Look at me.

999
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,380
Look at this.

1000
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,120
This beautiful roof...

1001
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,420
which leaks when it rains.

1002
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,590
I haven't paid the grocery bill
for three months.

1003
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,120
I want to buy a machine...

1004
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,560
but have no money.

1005
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,936
Mother is in Burma
but I can't bring her home.

1006
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,440
Brother's in a mental asylum,
but I can'tpay for the treatment.

1007
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:05,300
Yet I didn't go to you or your father.

1008
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,210
So why have you come to me?

1009
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,060
I...

1010
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:16,400
You...
Didn't Shyama tell you anything?

1011
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,980
Yes, she did.

1012
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,170
She told me everything.

1013
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,710
You wanted me
to deceive your father?

1014
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,196
Yeah, just because you're in trouble...

1015
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,420
and my name is Rajkumar
Saxena, that was my use.

1016
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,221
But, for how long would this drama
have carried on, madam?

1017
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,740
Four days?

1018
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:43,970
Or eight days?

1019
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:49,410
As long...
As long as you could dare.

1020
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:54,410
Oh, I see.

1021
01:13:57,170 --> 01:14:00,470
And... my remuneration?

1022
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,210
Whatever...

1023
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,990
Whatever you wanted.

1024
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,790
I don't trust cowards, got it?

1025
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,580
And how could you imagine
I'd agree to this foolishness?

1026
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,840
Do you think I've
fallen in love with you?

1027
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:40,920
Or am I some guy who'd paste on a
mustache and agree for few rupees?

1028
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,320
So, ultimately you're a laborer.

1029
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:46,840
Just a laborer.

1030
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,520
Here, take it.

1031
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,300
Two and half rupees.
Your labor charges.

1032
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:52,910
The rest is the tip.

1033
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,350
I salute you, madam.

1034
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,890
This is how you've valued me?

1035
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:06,030
I would have let you go. But,
you said you'd give whatever I asked?

1036
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,150
Damn! Take this, take this. I...

1037
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:13,100
Keep away from me!

1038
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:18,180
Now I'll never have
to see your face ever again.

1039
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,670
Man, who is this girl?

1040
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,960
Wherever I go, there she is.

1041
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:42,910
Bro! Brother!

1042
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:47,200
Raju! Raju!

1043
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,850
Raju.

1044
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:56,670
- Where's Shyama?
- What?

1045
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,480
I'm asking where Shyama is?

1046
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:02,090
Wow! Am I some detective?

1047
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,200
I say, it's 35 minutes to 9...

1048
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,800
and the Burma guy is nowhere?

1049
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,650
He'll be here in five minutes.

1050
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,080
- Oh.
- Yes didn't Kamla tell you?

1051
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,220
He'll be here.

1052
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,690
Bimla, when he comes,
you two stay put here.

1053
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:26,850
Yes.
I want to talk to him alone.

1054
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,490
- Got it?
- Okay, uncle.

1055
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,290
Preetam!

1056
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,930
Hey! What's there
to be nervous about?

1057
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,430
Okay, what's your name?

1058
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,026
Preetam Pande...
No, Rajkumar Saxena.

1059
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,650
- And yes.
- Where are you from?

1060
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,800
- From Burma.
- What do you want?

1061
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:58,200
- To marry you.
- Not me, to Kamla.

1062
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,180
Yes, with Kamla, Kamla.

1063
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,490
Papa, I have something
to say to you.

1064
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:06,680
Don't worry, dear. If that boy
is good, I'll approve of him.

1065
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,220
But the thing is, papa...

1066
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:09,460
Look, Kamla...

1067
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,580
I'm your father, not your enemy.

1068
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,920
Yes, yet...

1069
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,310
When is he coming, Preetam?

1070
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,360
He might be here.

1071
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:28,020
Kamla, until I call you,
don't come down.

1072
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:29,650
Got it, dear?

1073
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,340
Sunder!

1074
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,060
He's here.

1075
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,550
Hurry.

1076
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,150
- Sir?
- Damn you...

1077
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,740
Go there. Quick.

1078
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,950
Who called you?

1079
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,390
You're such strange man!

1080
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:18,450
Whenever you come,
it's with your version of a son.

1081
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,720
Is it my house or a zoo?

1082
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,370
Sir, I thought...

1083
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,480
Thinking isn't your job.
Sit down.

1084
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,080
I'm asking you to sit there!

1085
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,680
Don't move an inch from there.

1086
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,816
Who are you, prince?

1087
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,180
I... I... I mean, I am...

1088
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,480
Yes, you.

1089
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,597
- From where have

1090
01:18:44,621 --> 01:18:45,730
- you come?
- From there.

1091
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,540
- From there?
- I mean...

1092
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:50,630
Bimla knows everything.

1093
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,680
Oh! You are that young man?

1094
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,240
Young man... No, no.

1095
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:58,400
Young man? Yes.

1096
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:01,070
Young man.

1097
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,700
Your good self?

1098
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:19,310
Hey, I heard you're a tall strong man...

1099
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:22,750
but what I see
is worse than a woman.

1100
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,350
Is your mustache real
or did you paste it on?

1101
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,230
- What work do you do?
- What?

1102
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:32,540
- I'm asking what you do.
- Work?

1103
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,830
- That my father does.
- Wow, so your father works.

1104
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:39,620
And you just go seducing girls?

1105
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:46,720
Who are you, mister?

1106
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,720
Guess. After all,
who else I can be?

1107
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,710
Who is that person
you are so eager to meet and...

1108
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:58,230
with whom your
daughter is in love?

1109
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,830
Look mister!
I don't like such bad manners.

1110
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,360
Speak softly. I'm not deaf.

1111
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,276
- Sunder!
- Yes, sir.

1112
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,500
Call Kamla.

1113
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:08,340
I want to know
what's going on here!

1114
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,070
- Fine, sir.
- Look here...

1115
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:12,166
if you're the young man,
then who his he?

1116
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,490
Better ask him.

1117
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:15,930
- What's your name, son?
- Preetam Pande.

1118
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,206
What? Preetam Pande!
Why didn't you say so before?

1119
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,830
But you never asked.

1120
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,060
Damn you!

1121
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:33,150
Is he the same young man?

1122
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,670
Hello, madam!

1123
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:40,090
You! Why are you here?

1124
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,640
To marry you.

1125
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:43,220
I'm asking his name.

1126
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:46,780
Name...? Rajkumar Saxena.

1127
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:49,820
- You mean the Burma man?
- Yes, from Burma.

1128
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,790
- Then, why are you so scared?
- Scared?

1129
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,330
She's not scared, sir.

1130
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:55,560
It's just the difference
of the mustache.

1131
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,510
- Mustache?
- Yes, the fact is...

1132
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,200
earlier this man was clean shaven.

1133
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,986
Like you.

1134
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,980
But, now I've had this new fad
for a few days now.

1135
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:05,790
- Tell me, should I remove the mustache, Kamla?
- No!

1136
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:10,776
But I mean, it looks fine.
The mustache.

1137
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,200
Thank you very much.

1138
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,140
Now your acceptance, sir.

1139
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,460
I still have many things
to ask you.

1140
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,410
Of course, go ahead.

1141
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:22,070
Whatever you wish you may ask.

1142
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,600
This man's style is that
he never lies.

1143
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,046
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1144
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:28,540
This is a good thing.

1145
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,290
But first, tell me...

1146
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,210
- what's your profession?
- Profession?

1147
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:36,810
Just as I asked, sir.

1148
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:38,870
Kamla, didn't you tell papa?

1149
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,940
Anyway, I'll tell him.

1150
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,940
Don't worry, whatever I say
will be the truth.

1151
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,040
So sir, my profession is...

1152
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,590
of hard labor.

1153
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:52,240
- Yeah?
- Yes. I work so hard, how to say it?

1154
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,210
Not one of you sitting here
can do it.

1155
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:56,350
Meaning not even Kishore?

1156
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:59,160
Sir, not just Kishore
but even his father can't.

1157
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,780
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1158
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,510
Because we eat honest meals,
no free lunches.

1159
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:16,816
But sir, ask him his income?

1160
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,816
Yes.

1161
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,380
- By income you mean earnings?
- Yes, earnings.

1162
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:23,690
- This question is certainly tricky.
- You heard?

1163
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:26,790
As far as my earnings go...

1164
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,880
Should I say, Kamla?

1165
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,530
You know I never lie.

1166
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,280
- Then why ask me?
- Kamla!

1167
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:34,320
No problem, sir.
Such squabbles are normal.

1168
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,860
Otherwise, what's the fun in life?

1169
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:38,830
Don't worry.
I'll tell everything gradually.

1170
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:41,516
So, sir. Nothing is definite
about the income right now.

1171
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,340
- Sometimes something or other...
- Even then?

1172
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:46,390
For example, today's income...

1173
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:48,320
- 1800 rupees.
- In one day?

1174
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,190
- Oh, no. In five minutes.
- In Five?

1175
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,410
You heard, Lalaji?

1176
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:56,880
And some days people throw
bundles of notes at my home.

1177
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:58,470
- Oh!
- Ask her.

1178
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:02,050
Now the situation is,
I have no respect for money.

1179
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:04,130
I just need your daughter.

1180
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,570
Right, Kamla?

1181
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:07,190
Did you hear, Lalaji?

1182
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:09,880
Yes, sir, but what's your
order for us?

1183
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:13,120
In my opinion, your stuff
won't be of use here.

1184
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,340
Why don't you find some
other customer, sir?

1185
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,080
You girl, why are you
so nervous?

1186
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,326
After all, that poor fellow
loves you.

1187
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:35,630
Not love. He's here to
avenge the insult.

1188
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:37,030
Is that so?

1189
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,480
Yes?

1190
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:42,470
I don't know what things
he might tell papa.

1191
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,960
This man seems
to be very dangerous, Kamla.

1192
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:52,140
And tomorrow is the auspicious
date of your engagement.

1193
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,690
Hey, you seem to be very
interesting man!

1194
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,880
Sir, this humble man has many
qualities you'll get to know gradually.

1195
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,540
- You see this mustache?
- Yes.

1196
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,090
- It's only for Kamla.
- Only for Kamla?

1197
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,310
It irritates her, that's why.

1198
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,950
- Will you tell Kamla?
- No.

1199
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,360
It's fake.

1200
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,860
I won't marry you.

1201
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,016
Not at any cost. Never...

1202
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,520
Not only you,
your forefathers will.

1203
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:06,310
Look, get out of here.

1204
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,740
Or what?

1205
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:09,810
Or I'll inform papa
about everything.

1206
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,550
- Everything?
- Everything.

1207
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,470
- Even that the man you love is a laborer?
- Yes.

1208
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:16,690
Who say...

1209
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:18,350
Who says that I...

1210
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,510
Hey!

1211
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,310
Have you ever seen yourself
in the mirror?

1212
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,900
Now I'm seeing my face...

1213
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,540
in your eyes.

1214
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:48,400
You...

1215
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:51,270
You are a dangerous man.

1216
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:24,430
Now go and tell your father,
the man you fell in love with...

1217
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,510
is a manual laborer.

1218
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,800
Go! I, too, would see your courage!

1219
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:40,790
Coward.

1220
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,260
Where will you take me...

1221
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:44,300
Where will you take me,
oh tormentor eyes?

1222
01:27:56,780 --> 01:28:02,790
Hey, look and see. Whatever you do,
victory is mine

1223
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,580
Oh tormentor eyes,
however hard you avoid it...

1224
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:43,150
it's hard to escape me.
Make your eyes understand that

1225
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:52,320
Wherever you go I will come
with you as your shadow

1226
01:28:54,860 --> 01:29:00,840
Hey, look and see. Whatever you do,
victory is mine

1227
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:24,180
You were so lucky
to get a man like me

1228
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:35,820
And I am such a lucky man
that you called on me yourself

1229
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:44,240
Look at God's power
that you found a diamond on the street

1230
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:53,370
Hey, look and see. Whatever you do,
victory is mine

1231
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:55,620
Where will you take me...

1232
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:04,470
Where will you take me, my beloved,
oh tormentor eyes?

1233
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:18,190
These tormenting eyes of yours
are crazy after your eyes

1234
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:23,440
Slowly this heart became yours,
my love, without being close

1235
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:36,490
What's lost, what's gained,
only hearts are exchanged

1236
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:45,720
Hey, look and see. Whatever you do,
victory is ours

1237
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,120
Hey, look, see

1238
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:51,000
Hey, what it is, look, look

1239
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:56,970
Hey, look and see. Whatever you do,
victory is mine

1240
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:11,380
Only five minutes are left
for the auspicious time, sir.

1241
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:14,050
- Sunder!
- Yes, sir?

1242
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:16,440
Go quickly, call Rajkumar here.

1243
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:18,030
Okay sir.

1244
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:20,480
Keep watching with open eyes...

1245
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,620
at the wonderful boy
I've chosen for my Kamla.

1246
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:28,930
He's a gentleman,
young and hard working.

1247
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:32,870
And I can't express what
wonderful company he is.

1248
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:36,810
And when you see him,
I'm sure you'll be amazed.

1249
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:52,250
Don't worry, sir. Don't worry.
It's the same man, but with a difference.

1250
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,066
Now if you don't like it,
that I am here...

1251
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:57,290
and if you don't like the clothes,
then here they are.

1252
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:01,750
Marry your daughter off to these trousers.

1253
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,880
Sunder! Ram Singh!

1254
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:11,320
- Where the hell are you?
- Sir! Sir!

1255
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:14,100
Don't just stand there.
Kick him out.

1256
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,050
Hold on. Hold on.

1257
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,130
First, put this girl under lock and key.

1258
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:23,190
Because every rich father
must do this.

1259
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,850
- Mister!
- But keep in mind...

1260
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:30,166
one day this girl will break
every shackle and come to me.

1261
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:32,550
And she'll never leave my side
until the end of the world...

1262
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:34,680
or I'll consider her a coward...

1263
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,840
in whose veins water flows,
instead of blood.

1264
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,510
- Sir, did you like this drama?
- Drama?

1265
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,100
Yes, a drama.

1266
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,410
What are you people looking at?
Give a clap.

1267
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,520
Yes.

1268
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:48,980
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

1269
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,630
Enough, enough.

1270
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,630
And here, look at this.

1271
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:56,210
I was paid 1800 rupees for
this drama, got it?

1272
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:58,700
Much more than my annual income.

1273
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:01,310
Thank you, madam.

1274
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,706
But, mind you, not just you,
but even your father can't buy me.

1275
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:06,390
Because my price is your heart.

1276
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:11,530
Not these currency notes.

1277
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:28,090
Such a lie! Such deception!
Such craftiness!

1278
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:35,600
How could I know this is how
my daughter would repay my love?

1279
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:39,630
- Now, let it be, sir.
- Keep out of it, Lalaji.

1280
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:43,110
Kamla, how dare you?

1281
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:46,730
- Sir, inspector Tandon is here.
- Who's here?

1282
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:51,270
Sorry, I came to
return this necklace.

1283
01:33:52,850 --> 01:33:57,540
And if she's your daughter then
she's the Sushila who was caught stealing.

1284
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,420
- Kamla?
- Yes, it's true.

1285
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,540
Whatever your heard,
everything is true.

1286
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,690
And what you didn't hear is also true.

1287
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:21,300
- Lalaji?
- Yes, sir

1288
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,290
Bring Kishore immediately.

1289
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,380
- Right now, sir?
- Yes, right now!

1290
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,460
Kamla's engagement shall
take place today.

1291
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:35,810
Very good, sir.
I'll bring him in ten minutes.

1292
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:40,530
One day this girl will break
every shackle and come to me.

1293
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:42,796
And she'll never leave my side
until the end of the world...

1294
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,730
or I'll consider her a coward.

1295
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:46,990
A coward.

1296
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,370
Kamla, what are you doing?
Listen to me.

1297
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,020
For God's sake don't do this.
Kamla.

1298
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:57,760
Kamla!

1299
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,790
Kamla, I won't let you do it.

1300
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,250
Not at all.

1301
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,370
Sir, I am ruined. I am damned.

1302
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,000
I am totally ruined.

1303
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:06,910
This is all that
rascal's doing, sir.

1304
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,390
You shut up, Lalaji.

1305
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:10,646
What's the matter, Sunder?

1306
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:14,310
Rajkumar had made Kishore
run off with some girl.

1307
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:16,830
He had them elope, sir.
Made them run off somewhere.

1308
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,220
What?

1309
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,390
Perhaps that cheat doesn't know...

1310
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:37,400
the best young men are dying
to become my son-in-law

1311
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:43,480
And maybe both of you think I'll
have to bow to that Rajkumar?

1312
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:47,416
I've found a new boy today.

1313
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,530
Uncle!

1314
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:51,120
Tomorrow morning at eight,
Kamla will be married.

1315
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,670
- Sunder!
- Sir?

1316
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,190
If either of them even step
out of the house...

1317
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,520
then I'll break your bones.

1318
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:28,380
Sir, it's not my fault.

1319
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,060
I'm not at fault at all.

1320
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,150
I was watching all night, sir.

1321
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,010
- Perhaps from the rear door...
- Shut up!

1322
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,990
Bimla, do you know where she went?

1323
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:19,326
Raju.

1324
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:20,750
I said it's morning.

1325
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,980
Dear.

1326
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:27,510
Oh tormentor eyes.

1327
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:29,010
Raju!

1328
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,540
Is someone else with you?

1329
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:35,340
- No, no. No, I'm telling the truth.
- I don't believe you.

1330
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,100
Tell me where that
rascal has taken her?

1331
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,946
But make it quick.

1332
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:41,780
We have no time, Raju.

1333
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,690
Why are you sitting?
Go get a taxi immediately.

1334
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:46,490
- Taxi?
- Yes, we have to leave.

1335
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:47,640
Kamla!

1336
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:50,190
You have come on the sly.

1337
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:53,730
Haven't you told anyone?

1338
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,000
You came running like a coward?

1339
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,790
Can't you understand that to
escape from papa's golden cage...

1340
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:23,770
- I had to...
- Cowards have no right to be free.

1341
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:29,040
Freedom is born here, Kamla.

1342
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,740
In the heart.

1343
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,200
But you, you've brought
your chains with you.

1344
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,740
Don't you understand...

1345
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:41,840
that these chains will take you back
from where you're trying to escape?

1346
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,600
But...

1347
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,210
But, this is my mother's jewelry.

1348
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,440
My mother left it to me
for my marriage.

1349
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,260
These are mine.

1350
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:05,370
Not papa's. Go it?

1351
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:09,930
- They are all mine.
- Without work nothing can be yours.

1352
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,810
Kamla, make a decision.

1353
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:15,820
You love me or these chains.

1354
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,060
No, Raju...

1355
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,220
Do you love me or these chains?

1356
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,710
Papa.

1357
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:50,190
Where is he?

1358
01:39:50,230 --> 01:39:52,870
- Where is that human child?
- Papa!

1359
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,526
- Papa!
- Move aside!

1360
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:56,046
You've no right to be here.

1361
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:57,570
You go away from me.

1362
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:00,890
- Or else I'll shoot each of you.
- Do it.

1363
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:02,850
Shoot.

1364
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:04,926
Riddle us with bullets.

1365
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:07,670
But, now I won't return
to your golden cage.

1366
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:09,620
I shall not. Will not.

1367
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:12,380
Golden cage?

1368
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:19,750
I see this human child
has taught you a lot.

1369
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,580
Stealing jewelry from home...

1370
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,980
rebelling against your father.

1371
01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:29,690
You have really taken up
a wonderful profession.

1372
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:32,690
- But have you ever known my name...
- Papa!

1373
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,020
Here's your jewelry.

1374
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:37,846
What nonsense?

1375
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:41,260
Take away your jewelry.
From today I'm not your daughter.

1376
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,960
And you...

1377
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:49,450
aren't my father.

1378
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:54,230
Now I shall live with him...

1379
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,480
and die with him.

1380
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:01,070
Dear, are you angry now?

1381
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:40,730
You know these ornaments
belonged to your mother.

1382
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:46,330
Yes.

1383
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:52,780
But he doesn't want anything but me.

1384
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:56,220
- How can you say that this man...
- Papa!

1385
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,850
Dear. Kamla.

1386
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:03,870
Are you sure, confident...

1387
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:08,910
that he only loves you,
not my wealth.

1388
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,870
Yes. I am confident.

1389
01:42:14,490 --> 01:42:17,150
Then... the decision is made.

1390
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:19,570
Then what was the need to run?

1391
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:23,240
Come with me.
I'll arrange for your marriage.

1392
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,820
- Papa!
- My child.

1393
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:28,190
My child, I'm your father.

1394
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,770
Not your enemy.

1395
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,020
Raju.

1396
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,630
Raju! Did you hear?

1397
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:36,080
Raju! Papa is willing.

1398
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,240
Raju! I'll go now.

1399
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:41,010
Papa.

1400
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:43,880
- Dear.
- I'm ready to come.

1401
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:45,696
Papa.

1402
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,260
I'll do whatever you say.

1403
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:49,980
I'll do whatever you ask.

1404
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:09,180
Papa! No, you can't do this.
You can't deceive me.

1405
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:11,120
Papa, papa!

1406
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,600
You won't get anything
by deceiving me.

1407
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,180
Nothing.

1408
01:43:15,470 --> 01:43:16,570
Papa!

1409
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:18,286
Now I'm not scared of you.

1410
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:19,910
Now I'm not scared of anyone.

1411
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:22,010
Papa! No, papa, no!

1412
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,630
No.

1413
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:26,090
For god's sake,
don't oppress me like this.

1414
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:30,930
Papa, you promised.
You'll have to fulfill it.

1415
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,430
Papa!

1416
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,740
Papa...

1417
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:36,870
If my mother was alive today,
would she have done this to me?

1418
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,670
Papa, papa!

1419
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:45,530
Papa!

1420
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:48,750
You are not my father.
You're my enemy.

1421
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:51,640
Yet you can't separate us.

1422
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,890
No power on earth can make us part.

1423
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,810
Papa, papa!

1424
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,280
Papa!

1425
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:14,450
My heart calls you,
my love, come to me

1426
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:53,800
The world knows nothing
but how to antagonize the heart

1427
01:44:54,490 --> 01:45:01,550
The world has become the enemy
of the four-letter word

1428
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:05,890
The world has become the enemy

1429
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:14,380
The world knows nothing
but how to antagonize the heart

1430
01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:31,430
My hopes have been shredded

1431
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:35,920
In exchange for the heart,
I have found separation

1432
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:40,450
I have yearning for you
and desolation within me

1433
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:47,300
I didn't know it earlier

1434
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:58,650
That falling in love is so painful

1435
01:45:59,850 --> 01:46:03,080
The world has become the enemy

1436
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:11,720
The world knows nothing
but how to antagonize the heart

1437
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:19,540
The world has become the enemy
of the four-letter word

1438
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:23,910
The world has become the enemy

1439
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:45,000
The tears which come to the eyes,
they'll show your image

1440
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:49,520
I shall just keep waiting

1441
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:57,540
I didn't know it earlier

1442
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:07,220
That falling in love is so painful

1443
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:11,860
The world has become the enemy

1444
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:20,040
The world knows nothing
but how to antagonize the heart

1445
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:27,730
The world has become the enemy
of the four-letter word

1446
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:32,090
The world has become the enemy

1447
01:47:33,010 --> 01:47:40,470
The world has become the enemy
of the four-letter word

1448
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:54,240
My heart is calling for you.
Darling come back

1449
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:17,030
Hello, madam.

1450
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:20,540
Raju! Raju!

1451
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:23,210
Good that you've come.

1452
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:25,580
Want to declare
it to the entire family?

1453
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:31,040
No. I want to let the world
know that you have come.

1454
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:33,720
But why did you come like this?

1455
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,600
- If Papa comes to know then...
- I've come to tell you something.

1456
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:38,390
But everyone is awake.

1457
01:48:38,690 --> 01:48:40,760
And if papa sees us, he'll shoot.

1458
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:42,490
- For God's sake you...
- Coward.

1459
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:46,450
Does one face trouble like this?

1460
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:49,460
- No but, Raju...
- I'm here to say something, Kamla.

1461
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,560
Something was within my heart...

1462
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:56,390
but I forgot to say it.

1463
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:58,200
What it is?

1464
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,150
There was never anyone
as beautiful as you...

1465
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:08,180
not now, not ever.

1466
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:11,410
Alas, I've fallen
in love with you...

1467
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:14,250
and I can't live without you.

1468
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:20,060
Raju! Raju, please leave from here.

1469
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:23,970
Raju! Raju!

1470
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,320
For God's sake pity me.
Raju!

1471
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:31,490
Shoot me, sir.

1472
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:35,290
But what I've come to say,
I won't leave without saying it.

1473
01:49:36,590 --> 01:49:38,600
It's clear you don't want
a son-in-law like me.

1474
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:41,480
I, myself, hate the very sight of you.

1475
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:44,350
But, alas, you're her father.

1476
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,340
Perhaps you think by separating
us this story will end.

1477
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:52,736
But I'd say even in ten years
it won't happen...

1478
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,730
because we're both willing
to wait a lifetime

1479
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,350
Today...

1480
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:06,510
tomorrow...

1481
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:08,710
even in a year...

1482
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,800
or after ten years, whenever
she gets a chance, she'll elope.

1483
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,920
And then, would that save
your family's prestige, sir?

1484
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,220
Maybe, you've thought
of something else.

1485
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:22,400
- Perhaps you want to forcibly marry her...
- lmpossible!

1486
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:26,680
I'll give up my life before
seeing anyone else's face.

1487
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,480
Heard, sir?

1488
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:31,346
Now, either you'll have
to accept our marriage...

1489
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:34,520
or you'll have to guard your
daughter day and night.

1490
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:38,840
And if you love to be a jailor,
then congratulations on your appointment.

1491
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:41,130
I have no objection.

1492
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:46,550
But I feel, by morning
you'll come your senses.

1493
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:52,080
And you and your grandparents
will take pride in this alliance.

1494
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:55,630
I only came to say this...

1495
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:59,020
but you can't say
I didn't give you a chance to fire.

1496
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:02,240
Bye, madam.
Bye, rich man.

1497
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,710
Where will you take me...

1498
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:11,170
Where will you take me?
Where will you...

1499
01:51:11,310 --> 01:51:14,570
Where will you take me...

1500
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:18,070
Young man, what do you
want to forget Kamla?

1501
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:20,410
Meaning money?

1502
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,300
Whatever you say.

1503
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,920
Don't you see anything here you'd like?

1504
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:27,910
Of course there is.

1505
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:30,040
Then, tell me and it's yours.

1506
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,580
Now and right here.

1507
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,740
Your daughter Kamla.

1508
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,310
I don't believe...

1509
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:50,980
there's any man in this world
who can't be bought.

1510
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:56,020
And you think he loves you?

1511
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,390
But if I put you in one hand...

1512
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:01,280
and half a million rupees
in the other hand...

1513
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,350
will he choose you?

1514
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:07,420
Yes. He will choose me.

1515
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,040
You're crazy.

1516
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:11,050
Totally mad.

1517
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,650
I'll prove that human child...

1518
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,170
doesn't love you, but my wealth.

1519
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,090
Kamla! Kamla tell me...

1520
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,350
Bimla!

1521
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:36,190
Where's the key?

1522
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,300
Hurry, tell me.

1523
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:53,040
Ramsingh!

1524
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:54,730
Sir.

1525
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:00,640
- Sir?
- Stand guard at the gate.

1526
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:03,660
If anyone enters this room today...

1527
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,600
then you are fired. Got it?

1528
01:53:27,650 --> 01:53:30,280
Mister! Mister!
I am Bimla.

1529
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:34,480
I said, come out quick.
I have some private work for you.

1530
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:37,440
Hey, come out right away.
Someone will come.

1531
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,630
Look, the letter Kamla has sent...

1532
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,710
remember no one should
learn of it.

1533
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:10,940
- Is it to be done today?
- Yes, this evening.

1534
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:12,920
- Then consider it done.
- First, listen to me.

1535
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:15,860
Don't worry. I've understood.

1536
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:17,790
Now begins the real show.

1537
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:20,166
But today...

1538
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:21,680
Raju, get aside...

1539
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:23,330
Hey, Raju I'm dead.

1540
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:25,980
Hey, Raju, what are you doing?

1541
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:38,040
Where will you take me

1542
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:44,610
Where will you take me,
oh tormentor eyes?

1543
01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:48,060
Where will you take me

1544
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:55,940
Sir's been waiting for you
for a long time.

1545
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:01,170
It's my good luck, sir.

1546
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:04,810
But, where is that
gun of yours today?

1547
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:07,950
I've come to apologize to you.

1548
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:13,170
I assent to your and Kamla's marriage.

1549
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,260
You said the same thing earlier.

1550
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,780
Forget the past, son.

1551
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:30,710
Today I've come
to give you everything I own.

1552
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:36,110
My wealth,
my property, my daughter...

1553
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:38,960
- and everything else in this world.
- Hold on a moment.

1554
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,700
To start with, you must understand
I only want your daughter.

1555
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,620
Not those chains.

1556
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:46,940
But I'm giving it of my own will.

1557
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:49,260
You don't want to give,
but only to buy me.

1558
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:50,590
Raju!

1559
01:55:50,930 --> 01:55:52,730
You want to make me
your son-in-law?

1560
01:55:53,450 --> 01:55:54,550
Me?

1561
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:57,770
- But I was...
- Sorry, no human is sold here.

1562
01:55:58,410 --> 01:55:59,810
Find some other shop.

1563
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:02,410
Your daughter will come
to my house.

1564
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:04,680
- You mean here?
- Yes, meaning here.

1565
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:06,730
In this house.

1566
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:10,100
But son, how can she live here?

1567
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:11,950
As we live.

1568
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:15,680
My wife won't be a doll, rich man.

1569
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,940
She'll live like a human being.

1570
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:20,666
Got it?

1571
01:56:20,690 --> 01:56:25,330
Do you think my daughter...
will she agree?

1572
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:28,860
You can ask her.

1573
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,270
Look. It's a quarter past three.

1574
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:35,080
She'll arrive at four.

1575
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:36,310
- Kamla?
- Yes.

1576
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,150
Today she'll escape from the jail.

1577
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:40,416
Sunder!

1578
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,750
Hey, let's go. Let them come.

1579
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:47,880
Until she arrives, you're my guest.

1580
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:49,410
Raju!

1581
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:51,530
But remember...

1582
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:53,830
the moment she enters
this house, Kamla is mine.

1583
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:57,210
And you'll have to step over
my body to take her back.

1584
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,030
See, I can give you everything...

1585
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:31,050
but just leave this city.

1586
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:33,110
I'll give you whatever you ask.

1587
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:34,650
Here, take this check.

1588
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:37,260
Blank check.

1589
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:40,200
Look, I've already signed it.

1590
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:42,130
Fill in any amount you like.

1591
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:45,630
Raju, take all my wealth...

1592
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,700
but let my child go.

1593
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:51,720
For God's sake, let my daughter go.

1594
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,540
You couldn't kill me
with the gun, sir.

1595
01:57:58,340 --> 01:58:00,340
Now do you think you can
kill me with money?

1596
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,980
Please have mercy on me.

1597
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:08,430
Kindly have mercy on this old man.

1598
01:58:09,850 --> 01:58:12,250
If my daughter is destitute...

1599
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:14,830
what's the good of having this wealth.

1600
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:20,000
Will I carry this wealth
to my grave?

1601
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,100
I promise...

1602
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:30,790
I shall keep your daughter
like a flower.

1603
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,070
But what kind of love is this...

1604
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:37,340
that she, the poor child,
leaving her luxuries...

1605
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:41,440
will sacrifice her life for you?

1606
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:43,430
And you?

1607
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:47,170
You won't even move from
your principles a bit?

1608
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,550
- Raju...
- You see, I love Kamla more than my own life.

1609
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,260
Before giving up
what I think is right...

1610
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:02,390
I will choose death.

1611
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:16,400
No Bimla,
today I want to go to him alone.

1612
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:18,490
All alone.

1613
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:31,990
So now my daughter...

1614
01:59:33,710 --> 01:59:34,970
will leave me.

1615
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:44,840
Will leave me and live here!

1616
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:52,440
The ancestors of whom never
even drank water by thermselves...

1617
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,640
will she wash dishes
in your house?

1618
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:57,930
Will she wash your dirty clothes?

1619
01:59:58,910 --> 02:00:00,690
Will she fetch water for your house?

1620
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:23,470
Impossible.

1621
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:26,560
I say, she won't bear it.

1622
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:30,640
For a month or two, maybe...

1623
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:34,060
but all her life?

1624
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:38,730
You cruel fellow, all her life?

1625
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:49,960
Sir, she is here.

1626
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:38,890
Dear, why do they stare at me?

1627
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,780
Have you informed the entire world?

1628
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:46,070
- Kamla, me...
- No matter.

1629
02:01:46,970 --> 02:01:48,700
Now I'm not afraid of the world.

1630
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:53,600
When you're with me,
I'm not bothered about anyone.

1631
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:56,440
Oh!

1632
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,920
- Who brought these flowers?
- Kamla, you go back.

1633
02:02:06,670 --> 02:02:08,630
Your papa is right.
Our marriage is impossible.

1634
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:13,290
And I'm sorry I couldn't
understand it before now.

1635
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:17,110
Papa, came here?

1636
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:22,390
Yes.

1637
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:26,130
Raju, did you do anything to...

1638
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:30,000
No, it's not possible.

1639
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,720
Papa can't buy you.

1640
02:02:34,710 --> 02:02:36,770
What is it, dear?
Won't you tell me?

1641
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:40,530
- Don't know I can face death...
- It's not matter of death, Kamla.

1642
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:42,830
It's matter of life.

1643
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:45,270
I know you can die for me.

1644
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:47,860
But can you live with me?

1645
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:50,380
Here? In this house?

1646
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:55,670
Not for a few days, for a few months,
and even not for a year...

1647
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:57,890
but for all your life?

1648
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:59,580
You still don't trust me?

1649
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:02,820
Kamla, life doesn't
always have a happy ending.

1650
02:03:03,490 --> 02:03:05,490
Do you know what
it means to live in this house?

1651
02:03:06,190 --> 02:03:08,080
- I'll have to work...
- Work?

1652
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:10,980
Such work that will break
your back within a year.

1653
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:13,090
Such a work which...

1654
02:03:14,210 --> 02:03:15,970
Come. Come with me.

1655
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:30,670
Look! For food, for clothes...

1656
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:34,940
for everything you need
you have to toil hard.

1657
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:37,270
And you'll have to bake the bread.

1658
02:03:37,630 --> 02:03:39,280
You'll have to wash
piles of dishes.

1659
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,070
You'll to work like an animal.

1660
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:42,310
Water.

1661
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:46,230
You'll have to fight for water
like cats and dogs.

1662
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:48,980
And when you finally
get a pot or two...

1663
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:51,790
your back will be broken
climbing stairs, madam!

1664
02:03:52,230 --> 02:03:55,690
Look here. Your children.
Grandchildren of your papa...

1665
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:58,560
will crawl like vermin
in dirty drains.

1666
02:03:58,860 --> 02:04:00,860
And possibly they'll drown in them, too.

1667
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:04,180
Within six months you'll
be in such a condition...

1668
02:04:04,490 --> 02:04:06,130
even your enemies will pity you.

1669
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,456
There won't be any doctor.

1670
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:11,400
Not even a native healer. And if you die,
there'll be no one to mourn you.

1671
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,990
Also, you'll spend
your entire life in these two rooms.

1672
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:18,960
Entire life.

1673
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:20,830
Millionaire's daughter!

1674
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,100
There'll be no car here.

1675
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:24,920
No radio here.

1676
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:26,750
Or any cinema here.

1677
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:28,890
What will be here,
is work alone.

1678
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:30,560
Work, work, work!

1679
02:04:31,290 --> 02:04:33,340
And you know what you'll get in return?

1680
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:35,970
Clothing and food.

1681
02:04:36,910 --> 02:04:38,610
Food which your servants
won't even eat.

1682
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:40,850
And the clothes, which you'll...

1683
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:43,610
You think I'll go back?

1684
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:45,040
Kamla!

1685
02:04:45,530 --> 02:04:47,470
I know how difficult it will be.

1686
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:50,710
As I'm not used to working.

1687
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:52,770
- But, I'll learn.
- No, Kamla!

1688
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:55,220
It can't be. This can't happen.

1689
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:58,120
It can't happen, because...

1690
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:02,920
Because I've sold myself.

1691
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:05,780
Look at this.

1692
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:07,870
It's a signed check.
A blank check!

1693
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:10,530
I can fill in any amount I want,
understand?

1694
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:12,380
I can take the entire wealth
of your papa.

1695
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:16,380
So, now I have no right over you.

1696
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,900
No right whatsoever.

1697
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,490
Kamla.

1698
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:26,220
Come, let's go home.

1699
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:09,380
Raju, I don't know
how to thank you.

1700
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:12,430
I hope now your daughter
will live happily.

1701
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:14,370
But don't forget me
on her marriage.

1702
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:16,610
But why are you returning this?

1703
02:06:17,390 --> 02:06:19,550
Don't you really want anything?

1704
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:21,120
Yes, I do want.

1705
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:23,510
I want you to get out of here.

1706
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,560
Go immediately, rich man.

1707
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:29,480
Now I don't want to show
my face to anyone.

1708
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:52,610
I was waiting for you, papa.

1709
02:06:54,070 --> 02:06:56,110
Now you can marry me off
to anyone you like.

1710
02:06:58,100 --> 02:06:59,400
I am ready.

1711
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:13,710
Congratulations, uncle!

1712
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:16,580
Somehow the prestige
of the family has been saved.

1713
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:35,590
One day you ancestors will
look down upon me with pride.

1714
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:44,970
Perhaps you don't know that
during my grandpa's times...

1715
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:50,400
if anyone even mentioned
such a ridiculous thing...

1716
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:52,340
You're not my papa.
You're my enemy.

1717
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:56,400
- But you can't separate us like this.
- Shut up!

1718
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:58,980
If my mother were alive today...

1719
02:08:00,930 --> 02:08:03,780
If my mother were alive today,
would she do the same?

1720
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:06,090
Silence, Kamla. Silence.

1721
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:10,730
You aren't my papa,
you're my enemy.

1722
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:13,750
You're not my papa,
you're my enemy.

1723
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:21,220
I don't believe there's
anyone in this world...

1724
02:08:21,530 --> 02:08:23,550
who can't be purchased
with money.

1725
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:26,070
You couldn't kill me with the gun, sir.

1726
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:28,010
How will you be able
to kill me with money?

1727
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:30,780
- Enemy!
- Enemy!

1728
02:08:31,730 --> 02:08:35,020
Enemy, enemy, enemy!

1729
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:36,450
Sunder!

1730
02:08:38,690 --> 02:08:42,460
Sunder, say it.
Say it...

1731
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:47,050
that the young man has
passed my test.

1732
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,460
Papa!

1733
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:01,940
- My child!
- Papa!

1734
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:05,060
My child!

1735
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:07,180
The only question is, my child...

1736
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:12,040
will you be able to live
happily with him?

1737
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:43,390
Hey, you're back?

1738
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:46,610
Look dear,
I forgot to tell you something.

1739
02:09:47,690 --> 02:09:50,350
Is anything left?
I have brought everything.

1740
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:53,810
All the vegetables and
other groceries you asked for.

1741
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:55,336
But, listen...

1742
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:57,180
I told you I won't go, won't go.

1743
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:59,220
After all, I'm the man
of your house. Got it?

1744
02:09:59,310 --> 02:10:00,710
Not your father's servant.

1745
02:10:01,230 --> 02:10:02,830
Oof! I was saying something else.

1746
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:05,830
- Oh! You were saying something else?
- Yes.

1747
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:08,530
Speak.

1748
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:11,060
Go, I won't say now.

1749
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,600
God!

1750
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:17,240
Hey, dear tormenting eyes!

1751
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:21,690
Where will you take me

1752
02:10:22,150 --> 02:10:24,820
- Oh tormenting eyes
- What childishness!

1753
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:26,560

1754
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:30,260

1755

my youth, my youth

1756
02:10:46,590 --> 02:10:50,280
Whoever comes to destroy it,
they will burn
