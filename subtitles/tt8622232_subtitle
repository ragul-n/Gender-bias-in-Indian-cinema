1
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,920
Hey, Savio! It's Rishabh.

2
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Can we have one more sliced
avocado and some red wine

3
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,600
-for table number seven please?
-You like India?

4
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,920
You like Hindi?

5
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
-I do.
-Wow!

6
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm pleasing to… mix with you.

7
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Your name?

8
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,280
Sada!

9
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,720
-Sada?
-It means "Always".

10
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,440
-Always! Okay.
-Yes. Right.

11
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
Sada, okay.

12
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,360
I know… some Hindi as well.

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,520
-Taj Mahal…
-Taj Mahal, yes.

14
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
-Banaras?
-Banaras! Banaras!

15
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,640
I have been from--

16
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,240
No, no, I have been to Banaras.

17
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,680
Wow!

18
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,480
Taj Mahal! Banaras!

19
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Kanpur, Lucknow, Allahabad, Sangam!

20
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
They're all mine.

21
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,440
In fact, the Taj Mahal is my house!

22
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm from UP.

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,720
Okay.

24
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,840
You pee.

25
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,440
-Is this drink from the state of UP?
-Yes, please.

26
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,320
-No! How do I explain myself?
-It's just-- It's a--

27
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,560
No!

28
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,040
-You…
-Yeah?

29
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,360
pee. Drink.

30
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,040
UP, I also "You pee"?

31
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,520
Yes, drink it all.

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
Good evening, everyone.

33
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I welcome you all to my Bailamos!

34
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,480
The ballroom dancing café!

35
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,280
Why is Pablo standing at
the city square with a microphone?

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,440
What the hell is he doing?

37
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,440
Do you remember we got a
50-pound tip in the morning?

38
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Yes, what about it?

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,680
Bailamos will be hosting the
dance championship qualifiers.

40
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
-That'll ruin my weekend!
-Yeah, Savio! Yeah, on my way.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
I wanted to get my laundry done!

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
Our very important guest tonight…

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,280
the honorable commissioner
of The Great Bradford Dance Championship,

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,320
Lady Harriet Cottenham!

45
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,839
Thank you.

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
academy instructors,

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,200
and our dancers,

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
my council has unanimously chosen

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
this venue to host the qualifiers

51
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,200
of the Great Bradford
Ballroom and Latin Championship

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,160
yet again this year.

53
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,920
And our motto…

54
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,240
"May the best dancers win"

55
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,880
shall again be the criteria
for our judgment.

56
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,000
-William! William!
-William! William!

57
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,920
Okay, here we go!

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,760
The reigning two-time champion…

59
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,400
William!

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,320
-William! William!
-William! William!

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
William's a really talented man!

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,520
He has been blessed
with a rubber-like body.

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,720
You're right. I'm sure he
will win this time as well.

64
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,480
He'll be scoring a hat trick.

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Thank you.

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,920
Darling, your designated seat
must be over there.

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,800
There's a protocol, don't mind.

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,720
But we have some royal
guests coming in here.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
-Mother!
-Son!

70
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
She is such an
understanding and sweet girl.

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,160
I know what I'm doing.

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,160
It's fine.

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,280
-I don't wanna upset protocol.
-Isha, you will sit here with me.

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,320
-No, Willy, I don't mind.
-Isha--

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,880
Honestly, you'll sit with me.

76
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,520
Well, I'm excited.

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,040
You have a straight hat trick
chance this year, William.

78
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,000
And that has never happened in our
long-drawn history of the championship.

79
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,240
Don't say that, Timothy.

80
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,560
I reckon Isha is just a novice dancer.

81
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
And William's got it all wrong this year.

82
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,520
Exactly my point too.

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,320
You've won twice with the previous one.

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,440
Jessica!

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,120
Then why change your partner now?

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,640
That's exactly my strategy.

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,200
When my fellow competitors
see me dancing with a new partner,

88
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,200
they're gonna be really confused--

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,040
Your new partner will need a lot more
rehearsal even to catch up to your level.

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,040
Have you given that a thought?

91
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
Mother, I'd rather dance with somebody
who's hungry to win,

92
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,160
than with Jessica,

93
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
who's bored and tired
of winning every year.

94
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,240
It will not be easy.

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,080
But I'm sure Isha will manage.

96
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,480
She's a very strong girl.

97
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,680
Here's your British <i>Pav bhaji.</i>

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,280
Thank you.

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
-May I ask you something?
-Yes?

100
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,920
That guy, the champion, William,

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
is his new partner, Isha, your sister?

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
-Yes.
-Really?

103
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,040
We'll finally see an Indian
win this British championship!

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
Can I get you anything?

105
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
No, we're fine. Thank you.

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,840
-I'll be around if you need me.
-Thank you.

107
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm here to entertain you all night!

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
He's really funny!

109
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

110
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,720
Everyone here at Bailamos thinks
you're going to win this year as well.

111
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
-Thank you so much. Rishabh?
-Sir.

112
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,440
I also saw you dancing,
and I thought you're very good.

114
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,760
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
-Ma'am, for you--
-Oh, no, no, I don't drink. Thanks.

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,960
I had seen you perform last year.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,160
And the way you've stormed into the
top ten from being in the 22nd position,

118
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,440
I just want to say that
you're an amazing dancer.

119
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,600
-See you, guys!
-Bye. See you!

121
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,920
That was impressive, Guru!

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,680
Your <i>Banarasi</i> punch
knocked William's mother out!

123
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,320
You taught her a great lesson.

124
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,800
You wiped the grin off her face.

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,520
Hey, I have a question for you.

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,320
Isha smiled when she
looked at you, right?

127
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,320
I saw it! Don't lie!

128
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,480
Yeah, I guess.

129
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,160
-But that was normal.
-No!

130
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,960
It was abnormal!

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,720
Do you know what a smile
meant at my university?

132
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
What?

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,280
I appreciate you and I love you!

134
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,560
Go away, man!

135
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,200
I only speak the truth!

136
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
Thanks for saving me.

137
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,360
I appreciate you standing by me when
everyone thought a new partner was

138
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,760
a bad idea.

139
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,320
Listen…

140
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,640
dancing is to win in the mind first.

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
Later comes the dance floor.

142
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,120
And in you, I can see you're already
imagining yourself winning it,

143
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,560
which makes my choice simple.

144
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,440
I won't let you down.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
I know you won't, sweetheart.

146
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Isha is happy with William anyway.

147
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
So, what does it matter if I like her?

148
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,160
I like her.

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,120
-That's all.
-Really? That's all?

150
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,880
One of my friends at BHU was from
the town of Ishwariganj, in Bithoor.

151
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,280
Bithoor?

152
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,960
Yeah, it's just 23 kilometers
away from Kanpur.

153
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,880
UP-78.

154
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,360
He had a flashy red motorcycle.

155
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,080
He was going through the same problem.

156
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
I like her… but that's all.

157
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,120
I sat him down and told him,
"Son…

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,840
why are you giving up before you try?

159
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,480
Just post a status update on Facebook!

160
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
A beautiful girl smiled at me.

161
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,240
What am I supposed to do?
Please advise."

162
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
He did it.

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,400
He was flooded with
ideas and pieces of advice.

164
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,320
But do you know which was
the best piece of advice?

165
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
-Wait!
-Yeah, Sada! That's alright.

166
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
My life's fine.
Please let me be.

167
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Guru! Listen…

168
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,320
Have you ever sat on the bank
of the holy Ganges to count its waves?

169
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,200
No.

170
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,600
You might stop counting,
but the waves will never stop.

171
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,520
He alone attains salvation,
who denounces the bank of Ganges

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,040
and takes the holy plunge.

173
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,760
So, stop counting these
waves of "That's all."

174
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,320
-Come on!
-Take the plunge!

175
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,000
Or you'll miss the boat
and it'll never come back!

176
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,000
William, why are we here?

177
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
These are the most precious,
handcrafted collection.

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,360
Each necklace,
the only piece in the world.

179
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,440
These are perfect.

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,240
It's exactly what I had
in mind for her birthday.

181
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,600
Rishabh, William is gonna
propose to Isha soon.

182
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,760
My gut says that he'll do it today.

183
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,720
Isha.

184
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Go ahead, choose one.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
-This one's nice.
-Yes, ma'am.

186
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,920
These are the most precious Antwerp
gems I've ever got into my shop.

187
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,960
Thank you.

188
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,760
You're going to miss the boat!

189
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,200
You'll be sitting alone on the riverbank!

190
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
William, what are you doing?

191
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,280
Wasn't this for your mother's birthday?

192
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
No, not really.

193
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,080
She needs something much more treasurable.

194
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,200
And that really depends on you, Isha.

195
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
Am I about to give that to her?

196
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
Yes?

197
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
You mean the championship trophy, right?

198
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,280
Your mom will get it.

199
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,000
But I can't accept this.
It's just way too much.

200
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,040
No, it's really just a small gift to
show how much you mean to me.

201
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,360
No, Sada, that's not gonna happen.

202
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,920
I always speak the truth!

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
That's different.
This is not gonna happen.

204
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,320
Mr. Romeo's really confident!

205
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,600
I can see the sparkle
of love in your eyes!

206
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,160
I can't.

207
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,080
Look, my focus will always
be on the championship…

208
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,720
whether or not your mom
likes me, doesn't matter.

209
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,360
Are you really sure
that nothing's gonna happen?

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
Here's the cash for the
flash mob we had organized.

212
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,840
Cash?

213
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,560
Guru, answer me.

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,080
How are we gonna redeem your love story?

215
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,880
We need to have a plan.

216
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
I'll tell you my plan tomorrow.

217
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,320
-Can we sleep?
-What? Why?

218
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,960
-Come on!
-Hey! Go away.

219
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,840
I can see the "I'm in love"
smile today, Guru!

220
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,240
Will you be able to sleep?

221
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
I will.

222
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,040
Come on!

223
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,360
I thought we were having
an interesting parley.

224
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,960
It would've been refreshing.

225
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,040
But you wish to sleep.

226
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,440
But hear me out, Guru!

227
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,000
You snooze, you lose!

228
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,760
Good night.

229
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,880
Thank you.

230
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,880
Wait a minute, ma'am.

231
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,120
-Your flowers.
-No, thank you.

232
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,160
They've been paid for.

233
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,480
But I didn't--

234
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,120
Not you, he paid for these.

235
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,680
Excuse me, I think you forgot these.

236
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,240
No, ma'am, those are for you.

237
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,200
Sorry, but…

238
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,560
I don't even know you.

239
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,640
That's all right, ma'am.

240
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,000
-You don't need to know me.
-What?

241
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
It was just a kind gesture.

242
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,800
-I think you really liked these.
-Really?

243
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,800
-And?
-But perhaps you ran out of cash.

244
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,320
-Really?
-I just thought it will make you happy.

245
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
Are you trying to hit on me or something?

246
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,440
-I swear, I didn't mean to hit on you.
-What?

247
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
You were the one who stopped me.

248
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,240
-Really?
-I was leaving.

249
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,040
Hey, wait!

250
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,840
Why the hell did you do it?

251
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,920
Why don't you mind your own business?

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,040
Ma'am, there's no space
for kindness in my business.

253
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
And Besides, my spiritual masters say…

254
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,160
"Be kind, but don't expect to be thanked.

255
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,160
Being generous shouldn't be a business."

256
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,080
I'll take your leave, ma'am.
Goodbye.

257
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,000
Emily?

258
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,600
No, Isha, the bank will
not stop the foreclosure.

259
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,280
It will seal the
academy on Friday.

260
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,440
Wait! One minute! The bank's
gonna seal the academy on Friday.

261
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,440
-I have been calling! What is the--
-If you get inside,

262
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,760
I will explain myself.

263
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,760
-What are we gonna do?
-Isha!

264
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,000
You should be at the dance
academy before the students get there.

265
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,560
Please, if you leave--
Let me handle this.

266
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,520
-Come on!
-Okay.

267
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,200
Your dance academy is in serious trouble!

268
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,600
-I will explain.
-I really cannot find a way…

269
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,000
Bye.

270
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,720
<i>Isha, don't stop!</i>

271
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
<i>Keep dancing, baby.</i>

272
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,600
<i>Yes, Mom, I'm trying.</i>

273
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,360
What's wrong?

274
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,680
Nothing.

275
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,640
I… could ask William to help us--

276
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,080
Don't! Please!

277
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,520
I've requested the bank for a month's
extension. This is our last chance.

278
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,840
Emily's gonna try to
get us an extension.

279
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,840
Okay.

280
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,240
Come on, my new champ!

281
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,800
You have to win everyone
over with your dance, right?

282
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,800
Yeah.

283
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Come here.

284
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,320
Don't worry about this.

285
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,280
Focus on your dream.

286
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,960
-You better get going.
-Okay.

287
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,280
Sweetheart!

288
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,320
Why do you look so hassled today?

289
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,200
Mrs. Cottenham, you know I teach
the beginner's class every morning

290
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,120
and today there was--

291
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Oh, those classes at
your sister's academy!

292
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,040
My darling!

293
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,720
You shouldn't be working so hard

294
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,600
that you can't give time to
what's going to be imperative

295
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,040
and what's going to
be a futile effort in your life.

296
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Cottenham.

297
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,400
-Actually, today the bank's lawyer--
-No, please don't apologize, sweetheart.

298
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,040
That's absolutely fine.

299
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,560
But do remember that with only
two months to go to registration,

300
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,160
you are still pretty much removable.

301
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,720
I can kick you out of the competition.

302
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,240
You'll no longer be
William's dance partner.

303
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,119
Was that correct Hindi, Navin Singh?

304
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,880
Impeccable, your ladyship.

305
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,200
Good.

306
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,280
Come on!

307
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
You're so funny!

308
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,400
No, don't go.

309
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,760
Say one more line in Hindi for me.

310
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
-Please!
-What the hell is wrong with this idiot?

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,960
Sir!

312
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,280
"Edible cannabis seeks milk and cream

313
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,440
and weed needs some ghee.

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,840
But alcohol could get you thrashed,
so be responsible while you drink."

315
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,160
-You pee! You pee!
-You pee!

316
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,520
-Meaning?
-It means…

317
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,200
-just remember to be careful when you pee!
-You pee!

318
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,320
Oh, yes.

319
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,120
Idiot!

320
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
Your friend is really funny.

321
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,560
Indeed.

322
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
-Thank you.
-Are you from India?

323
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,400
No, Berkshire.

324
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,320
Berkshire.

325
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,160
-Yes, Hayat Sikandar.
-Hi, Rishabh.

326
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,160
Actually, Mom and
Dad are from Pakistan,

327
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,680
-from the city of Peshawar.
-Okay.

328
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,640
But my grandma is from Aligarh.

329
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,880
-Aligarh?
-Yes, from the Indian state of UP.

330
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,720
-These are my friends.
-Hello.

331
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,600
They're all British.

332
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,920
-Shawn McKennedy. How's it going?
-Hi.

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,920
He can't speak Hindi or Urdu,
but he loves Hindi songs.

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
-Really?
-He's a really good singer as well.

335
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,360
-Where's your other friend?
-Who?

336
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,800
The girl who's a champion dancer?

337
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,360
-You mean Isha?
-Yes.

338
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,360
Yeah, she's here but

339
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,840
-I think she's outside
-Okay.

340
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,160
-answering a phone call or something.
-Okay.

341
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,000
I could give her your message.

342
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,400
No, not really--

343
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,880
-Anyway…
-Okay.

344
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,360
-enjoy, guys.
-Thank you.

345
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,360
Cheers, bye!

346
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,840
Okay, I'm gonna be back.

347
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
Okay.

348
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,480
Hey, Hayat, what's up?

349
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,840
Bailamos?

350
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,000
Right now?

351
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,160
No, I can't.

352
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,160
For heaven's sake,
you're on your way home, right?

353
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,600
So, just get down at Covent Garden.

354
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,880
There's a problem, Hayat.

355
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
Try to understand.
I'm not in the mood today.

356
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,800
Okay, I know you and
your mood swings really well.

357
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,960
-Babe, I can't!
<i>-Just do as I say</i>

358
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,320
and I'll take care of your mood!

359
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,160
-This morning--
-I don't care!

360
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
Just come here.
I'm waiting.

361
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,240
-Yeah, let's go to the bar.
-Okay, sure.

362
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,600
-Yeah, I'm going to stay here.
-Wanna come?

363
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
-I'll see you in a minute.
-Come quickly!

364
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,840
-Hey, Isha! How are you?
-Hi.

365
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
-All good.
-Have fun!

366
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,840
Yeah.

367
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,360
Made it!

368
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
I'm so glad you're here!

369
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,160
Why do you look so down, buddy?

370
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,040
William's mom!

371
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,800
Here.

372
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
Just one.

373
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,440
<i>Enough excuses for effrontery</i>

374
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,160
<i>These mistakes won't happen again</i>

375
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,240
<i>Enough excuses for effrontery</i>

376
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,400
<i>These mistakes won't happen again</i>

377
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,520
<i>Hesitation is a waste of time</i>

378
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,760
<i>Stop before the night fades away</i>

379
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,040
<i>Intoxicate me with your dreamy eyes</i>

380
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,880
<i>I'm losing all control</i>

381
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,600
<i>My heart's getting swayed</i>

382
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,040
<i>My heart's getting swayed</i>

383
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,640
<i>My heart's getting swayed</i>

384
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
<i>Let's have a heart-to-heart</i>

385
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,200
<i>Before you leave</i>

386
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,360
<i>We won't get this time back</i>

387
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
<i>Please don't refuse!</i>

388
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
<i>There's a message in the air</i>

389
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
<i>My nights are sleepless</i>

390
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,840
<i>I won't go home all night</i>

391
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,960
<i>Listen to me once</i>

392
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,720
<i>Let's not care about the world</i>

393
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,120
<i>Let's get lost</i>

394
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,320
<i>I'm losing all control</i>

395
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,840
<i>My heart's getting swayed</i>

396
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,080
<i>My heart's getting swayed</i>

397
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,880
<i>My heart's getting swayed</i>

398
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,600
Rishabh!

399
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,000
Rishabh!

400
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,120
Rishabh!

401
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,000
She's fine.

402
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
She's alright.

403
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,840
A show-off on the dance floor?

404
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,120
Or an act of overconfidence in your
dancing abilities?

405
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,480
I'm still not sure that it wasn't
the alcohol overdose to cause it all.

406
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,800
Ma'am, she didn't drink last night.

407
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,640
-I know that.
-And who are you?

408
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Her liquor dispute attorney?

409
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,760
Ah, yes!

410
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,640
Pablo's waiter.

411
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,120
Well, there were numerous
eyewitness accounts

412
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,360
of her nonchalantly gulping
down several of those tequila shots.

413
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,720
Mother, will you just leave it?

414
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,880
What's happened has happened.

415
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,840
-Please.
-Thank you.

416
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,680
It wasn't her fault.
It was an accident.

417
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,000
All she needs now is sympathy.

418
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,200
-Thank you, William.
-I don't have that sort of sympathy left

419
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,840
for an act of utter irresponsibility

420
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,040
-and unprofessionalism.
-Isha! This is an--

421
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,960
William, I'll be down in the lobby.

422
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,200
She's right, I shouldn't have gone.

423
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,120
No, Isha, you'll be fine.

424
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
I'm sure it's just a
matter of a few days.

425
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,360
Thank you, William.

426
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,320
I think we shouldn't keep your mother
waiting in the lobby for too long, yeah?

427
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Take care, Isha.

428
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,080
Thanks, Willy.

429
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
-That's not fair.
-I understand!

430
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,920
Guys, please listen to me.

431
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,040
I'll have the money wired to everyone
who wants a refund by evening.

432
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,240
-Evening? It's not fair.
-Come on! Let's just--

433
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,440
Please try and understand.
It's very bad. Isha's knee is--

434
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
-Guys!
-Let's go, guys.

435
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,400
Meher!

436
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
-Rishabh!
-Hi.

437
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,520
What are you doing here?

438
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,720
Isha had dropped her chain.

439
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,080
Thank you.

440
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,000
Those students…

441
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,320
What's wrong?
Is there a problem?

442
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
Problem?

443
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,200
We teach Latin and ballroom dancing.

444
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,160
Nobody wants to learn
ballroom dancing from Asians,

445
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
especially the European students.

446
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,760
We had some Indian
students from the neighborhood.

447
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,480
Isha used to teach them.

448
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,560
They're demanding a refund because
I'm forced to postpone their classes.

449
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,680
Don't worry about it.

450
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,600
-You're here to meet Isha, right?
-Yeah.

451
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,440
Isha!

452
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,280
-Hi.
-Rishabh!

453
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,200
What are you doing here?

454
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,160
You dropped your chain at the hospital.

455
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,360
I came to return it.

456
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,480
-I thought I'd--
-Oh, my God!

457
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,440
Thank you.

458
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,600
Have a seat!

459
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,840
Yeah.

460
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,360
How's the leg?

461
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,760
Better.

462
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,320
I think…

463
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,680
I will be ready for the
Bradford Championship

464
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,080
in a couple of weeks.

465
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,240
A couple of weeks?

466
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,000
But the doctor has asked you to rest
for a minimum of six to eight months.

467
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,400
No way!

468
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,800
I have to win the championship this year!

469
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,440
I have to do it for my
mom's dance academy.

470
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,600
Rishabh.

471
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,040
Isn't Meher a dance instructor
at the Bradford Dance Council?

472
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,760
Why can't she handle
the academy in the morning?

473
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,160
They've taken out a
big loan for the academy.

474
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,840
And that's why she is busy with
another job in the morning.

475
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,720
Why don't you go and teach in the morning?

476
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,280
But Sada, you know it!

477
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,720
-What?
-I'm a street dancer.

478
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,120
And ballroom dancing is like
our Indian classical dancing.

479
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
Really?

480
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,680
It requires many years of practice.

481
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,680
Really?

482
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,600
Ballroom dancing!

483
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,920
-That's A-B-C-D.
-A-B-C-D?

484
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,960
Any-Body-Can't-Dance!

485
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,800
You're an idiot.

486
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,440
But you're funny!

487
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,120
Guru, may I ask you something?

488
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
Have you ever thought about
the famous labyrinth at Lucknow?

489
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,720
No.

490
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Don't do it.

491
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,640
If you keep thinking too much,

492
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,720
you'll be lost in the
labyrinth of life forever!

493
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,400
You should always follow your heart.

494
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,720
So, go and ring the bell of her door.

495
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,680
Yes?

496
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,760
You? What are you doing here?

497
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,040
Sanskriti Henderson, is that you?

498
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,760
So you're following me?
Wait!

499
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,240
-I know how to deal with people like you.
-Ma'am!

500
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,520
-I'll call the cops right away.
-Ma'am, listen-- Here's my card.

501
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,800
Ma'am, I'm Navdeep Singh,
senior attorney!

502
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,520
I've come from the office
of Emily Hayes, your lawyer.

503
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm here to give you the bank's notice.

504
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,400
Your dance academy

505
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
-will be sealed in two hours.
-What?

506
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,240
-What?
-Yes, ma'am.

507
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,600
You should have a look.

508
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm forced to kick people
out of their homes every week.

509
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,240
I hate my job sometimes.

510
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,800
But I'm not supposed
to show any kind of kindness.

511
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,840
I'm sorry.

512
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,440
How can we just shut
down a dance academy?

513
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,920
It has been there since 1987.

514
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,800
I mean, it has been
there for the past 34 years.

515
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,760
-And you're saying--
-Look, I understand.

516
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,760
All I can do right now
is give you two hours.

517
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,440
Please get all your personal
effects out of the academy.

518
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,880
And as I said before,

519
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,280
by 11 o'clock you'll have to vacate
the academy as per the bank's orders.

520
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,520
Mr. Singh, can you please do something?

521
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,080
I mean, we need a month--

522
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

523
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,080
But you had a word with Emily, right?

524
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,040
She was supposed to try.

525
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,360
You had said you'd manage this.

526
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,000
I mean, what are we going to do now?

527
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,640
I'll figure something out, okay?

528
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,640
We can be emotional in legal situations.
Please, try and understand.

529
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,160
What will we do if we lose Mom's academy?

530
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,280
Why don't you mind your own business?

531
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,880
-But you'd said that you'd--
-We won't lose the academy.

532
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,040
I promise.

533
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
We can do one thing, ma'am.

534
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,320
I'm taking a risk when I say this.

535
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
I may lose my job for this.

536
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,360
But, Ms. Henderson…

537
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,160
you'll have to prove your academy's
business prospects in the next two weeks.

538
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,840
If the bank feels that your
academy is making a profit,

539
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,600
or is capable of making profits,

540
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
I might be able to help you.

541
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,040
So, I can't really promise, ma'am, but…

542
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
I can try one last time.

543
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,680
I'll take your leave.

544
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,040
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

545
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
Hey, Meher, good morning.

546
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,120
Please tell your students that
their classes won't be canceled.

547
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,800
I'll teach them in Isha's absence.

548
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,880
I mean, it's a beginner's class, right?

549
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,280
I'm not doing you a favor.

550
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,720
You could teach me advanced
Latin dancing in exchange.

551
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,720
I mean, of course, if you
have room for an extra student.

552
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,800
Sir Anton is a ballroom legend.

553
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,160
If you follow him, we're set.

554
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,480
<i>There's no one like you in both the worlds</i>

555
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,440
<i>I can't believe my good fortune!</i>

556
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,480
<i>There are a million faces in the world</i>

557
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,680
<i>But no one is as pretty as you!</i>

558
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,600
<i>All day and all night</i>

559
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,240
<i>I sing your praises</i>

560
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,320
<i>There's grace, there's love</i>

561
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,520
<i>And there's decency in my beloved</i>

562
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,160
<i>Your expressive eyes</i>

563
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,560
<i>Have a lot to say</i>

564
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,320
<i>In the very first season of love</i>

565
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,000
<i>They drove me crazy</i>

566
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,480
<i>I want to be with you</i>

567
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,720
<i>And be inseparable</i>

568
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:44,120
<i>I found both the earth and the skies</i>

569
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,680
<i>In my beloved</i>

570
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,480
<i>There's grace, there's love</i>

571
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,240
<i>And there's decency in my beloved</i>

572
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,200
Here you go.

573
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,440
Thanks.

574
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,520
What's wrong?

575
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,840
William isn't answering the phone.

576
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,640
I mean, he hasn't checked my
messages for the past five days.

577
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,800
He must've stopped
his rehearsals without me.

578
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,280
He must be so worried.

579
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,800
Yeah.

580
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,720
-Your tablets--
-I mean, I've been trying to tell him

581
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,480
that I'll join the
rehearsals in a week.

582
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,480
I think we should see your doctor first.

583
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,480
Watch your leg…

584
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,120
Listen…

585
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,520
William had replaced his
champion partner Jessica with me.

586
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,400
And his mom, Lady Harriot…

587
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,920
she just needs an excuse to
kick me out of the competition.

588
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,880
I have to meet him.

589
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,199
I'll come with you.

590
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,960
Shall we?

591
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm so excited.

592
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,679
I can't wait to see him.

593
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,400
Jessica!

594
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,639
Isha!

595
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,840
What are you doing here?

596
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,120
Hi, Isha.

597
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,120
-How's your knee? I'm so sorry
-Dimitri, Just hang on for a moment.

598
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,239
that you won't be able to do
the championship this year.

599
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,159
Yeah, Isha, that's why
I'm dancing back with Jessica.

600
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,560
Really?
You could've waited.

601
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm almost better.
I just needed another week

602
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,760
-and then I can be back in rehearsal.
-A week?

603
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,239
You can't be serious, Isha.

604
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Look at you!

605
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,200
It's going to take you at
least a year to get better.

606
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,640
And I haven't got time for that.

607
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,680
I want to be here
practicing every single day.

608
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,280
Listen, you've been
great and everything

609
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,920
but I've made a decision.

610
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm sticking to it.

611
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,640
An injured dancer is
already a loser in the mind.

612
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,160
Hello!

613
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,280
Don't take it so personally.

614
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,240
It's about winning or losing.

615
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,320
And I always choose to win.

616
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,280
Anyway, I've got a
competition to prepare for.

617
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,280
So, you should probably leave.

618
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,080
What? You didn't get me?

619
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,080
You're definitely going to
lose the competition, William.

620
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,680
Give it your best shot.

621
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,440
Uncle Navin, please translate it for me.

622
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,320
He'll get it.

623
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,960
What does William think?

624
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,320
Does he think I can't win
this competition without him?

625
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,000
There's no dearth of ballroom
dancers in the city but…

626
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,200
I don't know what I'm going to do.

627
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,920
No, Brenda, she's great.

628
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,520
Yeah, you guys will
be really good together.

629
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,600
Sure.

630
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,960
-Stop this, Isha.
-Bye.

631
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,600
I'm sure all the dancers know
that you can't dance.

632
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,520
They're all gonna refuse.

633
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,480
Stop being stubborn.

634
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,280
You know that you won't be able to
dance for the next seven to eight months.

635
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,400
Savio! Phone call?

636
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,640
Yeah.

637
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,360
Doctor.

638
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,800
Yes.

639
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Rishabh, yes.

640
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,040
Doctor, reports?

641
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,720
Are you sure?

642
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,240
Eight to nine months?

643
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,120
Yes, doctor.

644
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,200
Doctor, is it not possible?

645
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,360
How long?

646
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,160
Six to eight months?

647
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,240
Okay.

648
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,240
Yes, doc.

649
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,240
Yes, you're right.

650
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,840
Okay, thank you, doctor.

651
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,720
Yes, thank you.

652
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah, Sada?

653
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,120
<i>The doctor you had</i>
<i>sent me to was busy.</i>

654
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,360
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

655
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,240
But she turned out
to be an acquaintance!

656
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,360
What are you saying?

657
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,480
She used to be Ms. Dubey in Shuklaganj.

658
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,480
She's now Dr. Tiwari here in London.

659
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,960
She's an alumnus of my university.

660
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,720
I had given her a rose on Rose day!

661
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,360
But I was late to the party
and she was already engaged.

662
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,720
I missed the boat.

663
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,400
Excuse me!

664
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,960
Can you please repeat the name
of the treatment you had mentioned?

665
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,240
-Platelet-rich plasma.
-One plate <i>rajma?</i>

666
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,120
PRP!

667
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,040
Yeah, PRP.

668
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,520
PRP, that's the acronym.

669
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,800
When our cricketers get injured,

670
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,360
she's the one who heals them with
her emergency treatments.

671
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,800
<i>She's a physiotherapist.</i>

672
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,160
You should get Isha to her
as soon as possible.

673
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,240
I'll handle the paperwork.

674
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,080
Isha, your MRI shows a
ligament tear of the meniscus.

675
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
Can you straighten it for a minute?

676
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,280
Does it hurt?

677
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,160
Yeah, a bit.

678
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,920
Actually, the previous doctor said that

679
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,560
I can't exercise,
I shouldn't dance for six months.

680
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,920
He meant I need to rest.

681
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,600
Isha, this rest is very important.

682
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,040
Your ligaments will heal in this duration.

683
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,520
But there are chances of
aggravating your injury as well.

684
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,520
So, your PRP treatment will
speed up this healing process.

685
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,080
Thanks.

686
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,320
Come, Rishabh. Usually, the insurance
doesn't cover these treatments.

687
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,800
That's the reason clinics
and doctors don't recommend it.

688
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,120
We do it for some special cases,

689
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,360
but it's an expensive treatment.

690
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,800
Doctor, whatever that cost is,
please don't worry about it.

691
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,800
We must ensure she recovers
before her championship.

692
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,680
I'll try my best.

693
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,400
-Can we start tomorrow?
-Okay.

694
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,080
It's not possible, Isha.
I need to leave.

695
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,000
-Emily has already called me twice.
-Okay, guys, see you!

696
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,400
But why can't he be my partner?

697
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
You should've seen the
way he did that waltz step!

698
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,040
-I know he can do it.
-He can't, Isha.

699
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,080
Bradford is strictly
only for professionals.

700
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,840
But I'm certified.

701
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,160
So, I can have a non-certified partner.

702
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,160
-Let it go, Isha.
-Bye.

703
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,160
We can participate next year.

704
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,280
-Okay, I got to go now.
-Bye, Rishabh.

705
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
See you.

706
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,960
Isha, I would've loved to help you but

707
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,000
I can't be a part of this competition.

708
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,320
And Meher is right.

709
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,800
You should look for a
professional dance partner…

710
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,360
and participate next year.

711
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Rishabh!

712
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,880
You don't usually give up so easily.

713
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,880
What do you mean?

714
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,680
We had almost given
up after we met William.

715
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,920
All the doctors turned you down…

716
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,120
but you didn't give up.

717
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,720
You went ahead.

718
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,880
You found this PRP treatment.

719
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,040
What's wrong with you this time?

720
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,440
You're giving up so easily?

721
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,440
Meher just said that there are rules.

722
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,880
So, I can't…

723
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,400
So, maybe you can't compete.

724
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,160
But you won't even try?

725
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,560
I think there's more to it.

726
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,880
Tell me, Rishabh.

727
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,760
Nothing.

728
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,320
Nothing at all.

729
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,120
-Tell me.
-Tell you what?

730
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,160
There's nothing.

731
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,440
I can't take part in this competition,
that's all.

732
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,920
Look, I can't be anybody's dance partner.

733
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,200
Why, Rishabh?

734
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,560
Why are you getting so upset?

735
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
-Please, tell me--
-What do you wanna hear?

736
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,400
Rishabh! I want to know!

737
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,360
Please!

738
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,160
I've lost someone on the dance floor.

739
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,080
And I can't lose anyone again.

740
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Do you get that?

741
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,440
I've never seen Rishabh
this glum and lonely.

742
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,120
He was always the life of the party.

743
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,960
This is an old story.

744
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,840
We used to live in the town of
Gomati Nagar, Lucknow.

745
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,760
Meesha had come to Lucknow
with a dance troupe from London.

746
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,600
She loved Rishabh's dancing skills.

747
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,560
She brought him to London.

748
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,080
And they performed at
several dance shows together.

749
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,560
Rishabh fell deeply in love
for the first time.

750
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,840
Meesha was really sweet as well.

751
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,480
They were living a really happy life.

752
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,960
But one day…

753
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Meesha insisted on performing
a really difficult dance lift

754
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,280
for a stage performance.

755
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,080
Rishabh tried to refuse but she
didn't pay heed to his advice.

756
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,640
And there was an accident
during the rehearsals.

757
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,320
Was it Rishabh's fault?

758
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,200
It was nobody's fault.

759
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,320
It was just an accident.

760
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,160
But Rishabh has been
blaming himself for the accident.

761
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,360
Uncle Gopi told me the whole
story when he had called me.

762
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,480
He said that Rishabh had
been admitted into a hospital.

763
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,040
He had been diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress disorder.

764
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,960
Happiness tends to fade away quickly.

765
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,000
And sorrows tend to
stick with us for years.

766
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,520
That's what this disorder means.

767
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,120
My diagnosis says that
he is stuck in the past.

768
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,400
But that is all in the past!

769
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,000
How long will Rishabh continue to--

770
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,520
He has been trying to hide
those cracks from his past.

771
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,920
He's become really lonely.

772
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,560
So, can I help him out?

773
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,000
Yes. Of course!

774
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,760
You're on the right track.

775
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,200
I have always said it!

776
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,800
I have always said it.

777
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,440
I really feel that…

778
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,840
you will have to do
something about this.

779
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,200
Rishabh!

780
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,520
Isha!

781
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,280
You're here?

782
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,680
Yeah.

783
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,000
You didn't show up for the past two days.

784
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,120
So…

785
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,480
-Is this where you live?
-Yes.

786
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,120
Nice balcony.

787
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,240
Thanks. How's your knee?

788
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,000
It hurts a bit.

789
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,040
-You want to sit?
-No, it's okay.

790
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,560
Listen, after this accident,

791
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,200
I've decided that…

792
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,200
I will quit dancing

793
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,480
Quit dancing?

794
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
Every time I step on
to the dance floor--

795
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,000
I've lost my confidence.

796
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,480
But, Isha, that was just an accident!

797
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,760
It wasn't your fault.

798
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,560
But it was my fault!

799
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,880
This is happening because of me!

800
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,640
It was all my fault!

801
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,320
I'm going to regret this
for the rest of my life.

802
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,880
Anyway…

803
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,320
I have to go but I
just wanted to tell you this.

804
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,280
Bye.

805
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,760
Yes!

806
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,560
Help us, Lord!

807
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,680
Isha.

808
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,080
Rishabh!

809
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,880
I can be your partner.

810
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,680
But I need a trainer who can
train me and get me certified.

811
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,200
This won't be easy, Rishabh!

812
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,520
You have to train
continuously for 32 days!

813
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,360
It's not going to be easy.

814
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,360
The body is going to break down.

815
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,880
Muscle fatigue, ligament tears,
spinal injuries!

816
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,160
It's a huge risk!

817
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,040
The body needs to rest, Rishabh.

818
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,640
There are many dance styles
and many dance steps!

819
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,960
How will you memorize them all?

820
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,280
And even if you do,

821
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,640
your mind and body will give
up after a couple of weeks!

822
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,240
And you will be competing
against professional dancers.

823
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,840
You have a day to decide.

824
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,000
Please think about it, Rishabh.

825
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:22,200
<i>You're surrounded by darkness</i>

826
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:32,280
<i>And morn lies miles away</i>

827
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,440
<i>How will you cross this dark path?</i>

828
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:49,800
<i>Within you lies fear!</i>

829
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,680
<i>Bear in mind, traveler!</i>

830
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,280
<i>You have to fight yourself</i>

831
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,720
<i>Nobody stands with you</i>

832
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,840
<i>You have to keep walking yourself</i>

833
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
<i>Bear in mind, traveler!</i>

834
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,880
<i>You have to fight yourself</i>

835
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,880
<i>Nobody stands with you</i>

836
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,120
<i>You have to keep walking yourself</i>

837
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,160
<i>You've resolved to cross the fire</i>

838
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,200
<i>Your dreams are the way to your goal</i>

839
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,240
<i>Let the mud be soaked</i>

840
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,280
<i>Let the mud be soaked</i>
<i>With drops of your sweat</i>

841
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,400
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

842
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,400
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

843
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,360
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

844
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,360
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

845
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,360
<i>You've resolved to win the skies</i>

846
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,480
<i>The moon is where you belong</i>
<i>That's your goal, traveler!</i>

847
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,440
<i>Ride the winds</i>

848
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,480
<i>Ride the winds</i>
<i>That's how life should be</i>

849
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,480
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

850
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,560
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

851
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,680
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

852
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,200
<i>Go for it and aim for the skies</i>

853
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,040
An amateur dancing waiter achieving such
an extraordinary feat in just… 32 days?

854
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,840
It's a fraudulent story!

855
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,000
As commissioner of this dance council,

856
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,080
I hold discretionary powers

857
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,640
to cancel from our statutory list

858
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,560
of authorizing dance institutions,

859
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,200
the name of Sunbeam Academy.

860
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,880
That's absolutely ridiculous, Harriet.
You can't just do that.

861
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,600
Your application stands void.

862
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,160
You may leave.

863
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,960
Listen, you want to cancel my
membership for this dance council,

864
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,040
that's absolutely fine.

865
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,680
But you can't ignore these certificates.
They're legal.

866
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,600
My dance academy was authorized
at the time of this training.

867
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,160
Alright, I won't refute the legality.

868
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,960
But how does one ascertain that these
certificates were genuinely issued

869
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,760
-in a matter of 32 days?
-Hey!

870
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,080
Come in here!

871
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,680
One minute…

872
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,160
Ms. Henderson, this is a believable fraud.

873
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,040
Excuse me, ma'am!

874
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,320
And the gentlemen as well.

875
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,920
Hey, quick!

876
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,920
Come.

877
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,120
Richard.

878
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,680
He's my friend.

879
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,760
Richard will give you all the details.

880
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,600
Please give these holy offerings
to these poor people.

881
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,520
-What's all that?
-That?

882
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,880
I'll teach this old fool a lesson!

883
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,200
Come here, boy.

884
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:16,840
Sir, you'll be craving for these
holy offerings after I whack you!

885
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,080
I didn't study law at my university.

886
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,320
But I'm from the state of UP,
and that should be enough!

887
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,120
This is the training footage of those 32
days with the date as well as the time.

888
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,600
Please have a look at it.

889
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,520
Let me explain it to them, Timothy.

890
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,360
We make the rules here.

891
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,640
And we decide who
participates and who doesn't.

892
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,520
You guys will not be a
part of this competition.

893
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,840
You may all leave now.

894
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,360
Thank you, Navin Singh.
Take this!

895
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,080
Check the history of
the championship, Sally.

896
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,800
There have been no Indians in it ever.

897
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,360
No Asians ever.

898
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,160
Legitimate or not, Rishabh and Isha

899
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,760
definitely deserved to be out.

900
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,000
What was that, Mother?

901
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,080
Are you suggesting Isha
and Rishabh deserve to be in it?

902
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,600
And your dance council here just
deliberately kicked them out?

903
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,000
Leave the grubby politics
of the council to me.

904
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,840
Let that be my liability.

905
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,760
Yours is purely to create history
in this championship.

906
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,360
But, Mother, you've completely
forgotten the motto.

907
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,520
"May the best dancers win!"

908
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,520
I don't want to be
the excuse for their loss.

909
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,200
I want to be the reason

910
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,640
for their defeat.

911
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,840
Very good.

912
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,440
Jaggi, keep the hands up.

913
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,440
Three…

914
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,240
five, six, seven!
Remember to shape on the seven.

915
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,040
Very good, guys.
I'm gonna go again.

916
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,600
One, two, three, hands high.

917
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,840
Sonia, keep the hands straight, please.

918
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,960
Good job, guys.

919
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,960
I've convinced the dance
council to get you

920
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,080
Meher!

921
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,480
Meher, come here.

922
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,680
-What?
-Look at this!

923
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,280
Bradford Dance Council
has agreed to let us participate!

924
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,160
Kindly re-submit your application

925
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,920
at the reception tomorrow
at 11:00 a.m. without fail.

926
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,560
-We did it!
-Oh, my God!

927
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,720
I'm so happy!

928
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,800
-I'm going to show this to Rishabh.
-We did it!

929
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,360
Yeah, okay.
Bye.

930
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,760
Hail Lord Shiva!

931
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,800
Praise Lord Bholenath!
Praise Lord Vishwanath!

932
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,480
Please bless us!
Hail Lord Mahadev.

933
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,360
Sada, should we cancel today's show?

934
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,680
Okay, cancel.

935
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Cancel everything!

936
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,520
I'll take my clothes off!

937
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,600
You should do the same!

938
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,840
Where's my suitcase?

939
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,320
-Let's pack up and go back to Lucknow.
-What are you doing?

940
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,960
Let's go back to Gomati
Nagar and to Uncle Gopi!

941
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,560
And we'll just be waiters!

942
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,320
-Listen to--
-Why should I?

943
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,800
We don't have the money
to pay the rent.

944
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,240
We have to vacate this house anyway.

945
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,240
Look…

946
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,480
you have already quit
your job at Bailamos.

947
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,520
We've got an advance for one show

948
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,520
and we have spent it all
on Isha's PRP treatment.

949
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,800
-Yes, but--
-Forget it.

950
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,280
Stop irritating me!

951
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,840
-Listen to me--
-The client has already reached London!

952
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,760
We have a show in the evening!
Here's the invite.

953
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,000
Groom from Delhi weds
a Bride from London.

954
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,880
How are you going to handle it?

955
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,880
Rishabh! Rishabh!

956
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,000
Harriet was forced to
change the council's decision.

957
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,200
-No! No way!
-You were right!

958
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,720
-We're back in the competition.
-They're back at it!

959
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,560
-Really?
-Yes.

960
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,600
-Did you hear that?
-No, I didn't.

961
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,400
I have a suggestion.

962
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,320
Let's wait for the client to kill me!

963
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,480
And then you can celebrate!

964
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,160
<i>Your eyes are sharp as swords</i>

965
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,840
<i>They pierce my heart secretly</i>

966
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,560
<i>Come meet me, girl!</i>
<i>It's Saturday!</i>

967
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,680
<i>Please don't refuse!</i>

968
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,360
<i>Boys from Delhi</i>
<i>Are falling prey to your beauty</i>

969
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,160
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

970
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,040
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

971
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,680
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

972
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,840
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

973
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,760
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

974
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,480
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

975
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,400
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

976
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,720
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

977
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,360
<i>You have no clue</i>
<i>What they're willing to do for you</i>

978
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,040
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

979
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,960
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

980
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,600
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

981
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,840
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

982
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,640
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

983
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,560
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

984
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,440
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

985
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,720
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

986
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,480
<i>My heart vies for you</i>
<i>But it's scared</i>

987
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,320
<i>Please don't say no</i>
<i>It requests you</i>

988
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,040
<i>My heart vies for you</i>
<i>But it's scared</i>

989
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,360
<i>Please don't say no</i>
<i>It requests you</i>

990
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,280
<i>I left my world behind</i>

991
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,920
<i>I love you more than my life</i>

<i>Come meet me, girl!</i>
<i>It's Saturday!</i>

00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,880
<i>Please don't refuse!</i>

<i>Boys from Delhi</i>
<i>Are falling prey to your beauty</i>

00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,120
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

996
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,840
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

997
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,560
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1002
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,600
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1003
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,200
<i>Listen, baby!</i>
<i>You drive me crazy</i>

1004
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,080
<i>Life is lazy without you</i>

1005
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,000
<i>Listen, baby!</i>
<i>You drive me crazy</i>

1006
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,760
<i>Life is lazy without you</i>

1007
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,440
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1008
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,360
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1009
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,240
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1010
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,160
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1011
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,880
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1012
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,800
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1013
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,200
<i>Boys have been slayed</i>

1014
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,640
Richard, tell me something.

1015
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,280
Do you understand ballroom dancing?

1016
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,800
Or do you believe it's
just a British folk dance?

1017
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,640
Give me your hand.

1018
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,960
Come on!

1019
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,440
You have five fingers.

1020
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,080
Ballroom dancing has five forms as well.

1021
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,120
Like waltz,

1022
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,280
tango,

1023
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,760
Viennese waltz,

1024
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,200
foxtrot, where you
dance around like a fox,

1025
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,320
and quickstep.

1026
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,720
Five!

1027
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,720
Give me the other hand.

1028
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,440
You have five more
fingers on the other hand.

1029
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,280
One, two, three, four, five, right?

1030
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,880
Ballroom has five forms.

1031
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,400
Similarly, there are five
styles in Latin dancing.

1032
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,640
Rumba,

1033
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Paso doble,

1034
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,760
jive, samba, cha-cha.

1035
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,200
No, that's not Uncle Sambha
from the movie <i>Sholay.</i>

1036
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,720
These are two different things.

1037
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,000
These are Latin dance forms.

1038
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,880
He wants to learn Hindi at Banaras.

1039
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,800
The Bradford Council has issued
new rules to make the qualifiers tougher.

1040
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,000
Only ten couples will
qualify for the finale.

1041
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,120
Qualifying for the finals won't be easy.

1042
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,840
In round one, you'll perform all
four forms of ballroom dancing.

1043
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,160
You'll have 40 seconds
for each dance form.

1044
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,520
What? 40 seconds?

1045
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,040
Ballroom waltz solo.

1046
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,320
This is to introduce all the dancers.

1047
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,000
Your chemistry will be clearly visible.

1048
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,520
Have you seen those firecrackers that look
like miniature merry-go-rounds?

1049
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,360
Exactly!

1050
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,920
That's what they mean by a waltz.

1051
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Latin forms.

1052
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,840
Again, you'll have 40 seconds
each to perform all five Latin forms.

1053
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,640
Twenty marks for each form.

1054
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,040
You will have to be a
part of the top ten teams,

1055
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,840
if you want to beat William
and Jessica at the finals.

1056
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1057
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,600
<i>Bradford Dance Council makes the</i>
<i>championship very mean and close.</i>

1058
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,040
<i>Only ten couples shall</i>

1059
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,000

Viennese waltz, foxtrot,
tango and quickstep.

1061
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,680
<i>William and Jessica take</i>
<i>the first position straight away.</i>

1062
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,400
<i>Sharpest climb by the new</i>
<i>Indian couple from 30 to 18.</i>

1063
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,200
You're in the championship because of me.

1064
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,040
<i>Oh, what's that? William has a</i>
<i>face-off with the Indian couple.</i>

1065
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,160
<i>The Indian couple</i>
<i>is down by two points.</i>

1066
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,120
<i>Too bad!</i>

1067
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,520

<i>have had a remarkable fightback to 16</i>

1072
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,480
<i>after having started from rank 30.</i>

1073
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,000
<i>What a fierce fight tonight!</i>

1074
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,680
-<i>Everyone knows that the finale's closer.</i>
-Did you see Rishabh up there?

1075
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,160
He was awesome!

1076
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,360
<i>Waltz solo.</i>

1077
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,520

<i>William and Jessica!</i>

1080
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,960
<i>Now I know, I've made a mistake</i>

1081
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,040
<i>I shouldn't have let you go</i>

1082
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,680
<i>I should have stopped you</i>

1083
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,680
<i>Held your heart</i>

1084
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,920
<i>And I should have let you know</i>

1085
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:23,640
<i>I keep on running</i>
<i>Thinking all the day about us</i>

1086
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:29,200
<i>Wiping all the memories</i>

1087
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:35,920
<i>Now I Know, I've made a mistake</i>

1088
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
<i>I shouldn't have let you go</i>

1089
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,600
William, I love you!

1090
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:48,360
<i>I would do anything</i>
<i>To have you in my arms</i>

1091
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,320
<i>In my arms</i>

1092
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,720
<i>Once again</i>

1093
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,040
<i>This couple danced like champions.</i>

1094
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,600
<i>And the crowd just loves them.</i>
<i>I'm sure, so do our judges.</i>

1095
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,320
<i>-Our favorite, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
-William! William!

1096
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,200
<i>-couple number 150,</i>
-William! William!

1097
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,000
-<i>William-Jessica!</i>
-William! William!

1098
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,560
<i>And so say the points!</i>

<i>Number one ranked William-Jessica</i>
<i>keep their lead intact.</i>

1100
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,800
<i>And the judges just</i>
<i>can't disagree with us.</i>

1101
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,480
<i>I found you and lost myself</i>

1102
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,560
<i>What do I tell you even if I want to?</i>

1103
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,760
<i>I found you and lost myself</i>

1104
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:06,720
<i>What do I tell you even if I want to?</i>

1105
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,720
<i>No language in the world</i>
<i>Has the right words</i>

1106
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:18,160
<i>To express what you mean to me</i>

1107
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:24,200
<i>Just say what lies in your heart</i>

1108
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:30,080
<i>I won't tell on you</i>

1109
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,280
<i>And for the first time in</i>
<i>Bradford's dance history,</i>

1110
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,800
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>an all-Indian couple…</i>

1111
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,080
<i>Rishabh and Isha!</i>

1112
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,960
<i>Playfulness immersed in grace</i>

1113
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:15,360
<i>Reflects on your face</i>

1114
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:21,120
<i>Your dark tresses</i>

1115
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,840
<i>Sway gracefully</i>

1116
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,760
<i>Lovers who love the souls</i>

1117
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:36,200
<i>Never talk about bodies</i>

1118
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,120
<i>If I say, my beloved</i>

1119
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,880
<i>You're a nymph or a fairy</i>

1120
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,880
<i>It won't be enough to praise you</i>

1121
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:59,360
<i>Just say what lies in your heart</i>

1122
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,360
<i>I won't tell on you</i>

1123
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,560
<i>Just say what lies in your heart</i>

1124
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:15,480
<i>I won't tell on you</i>

1125
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,040
I love you, Rishabh!

1126
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,120
<i>And the judges are taking</i>
<i>time to mark the points.</i>

1127
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,000
<i>So, there we are!</i>

1128
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,240
<i>Tremendous jump for the</i>
<i>Indian couple to rank 12.</i>

1129
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,480
<i>I am beginning to like them.</i>

1130
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,640
<i>See you in the Latin round…</i>

1131
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,560
-You guys were absolutely fantastic!
-Hey! You guys were excellent!

1132
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,560
-All the best.
-Well done.

1133
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,640
-All the best.
-Thank you.

1134
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,160
You're dancing really well.

1135
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,960
But good dancing isn't
going to be enough at this level.

1136
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,600
Your mental alertness is as
important as your physical fitness.

1137
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,160
Isha, Rishabh, beware…

1138
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,320
William tries to mentally challenge
his competitors on the dance floor.

1139
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,200
Ignore his mind games, alright?

1140
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,720
-Yeah.
-Okay, you guys are good?

1141
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,440
-Yeah.
-All the best, I'll see you soon, okay?

1142
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,400
Bye.

1143
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,000
-Good luck, guys.
-Thank you.

1144
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,880
Thanks.

1145
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:23,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1146
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,359
<i>before the dancers set the floor on fire</i>

1147
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,880
<i>with the group Latin performance,</i>

1148
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,160
<i>I'm more excited about</i>
<i>the Indian couple now.</i>

1149
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,479
<i>Rishabh-Isha, number 11.</i>

1150
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,960
<i>Rishabh-Isha climb back to ten.</i>

1151
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,120
-What? That's not fair!
-Calm down.

1152
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,439
<i>Was that…</i>

1153
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,800
<i>Is that a mistake?</i>

1154
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,640
<i>Rishabh-Isha drop by two points.</i>
<i>That's not good.</i>

1155
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,040
<i>Rishabh-Isha climb back to ten.</i>

1156
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,520
<i>That's not a mistake.</i>

1157
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,479
<i>I hope that the Indian couple</i>
<i>keeps their minds cool.</i>

1158
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,479
<i>The finalists, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1159
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,760
<i>150, William and Jessica.</i>

1160
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,520
<i>Jake and Alex.</i>

1161
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,960
<i>Ben and Savy.</i>

1162
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,720
<i>Greg and Jessica.</i>

1163
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,640
<i>Daniel and Christina.</i>

1164
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,400
<i>Julia and Boyle.</i>

1165
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,960
<i>Anna and Rocher.</i>

1166
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,400
<i>Ian and Gemma.</i>

1167
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,160
<i>Oscar and Alice.</i>

1168
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,920
<i>Rebecca and Adam.</i>

1169
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,800
<i>Oh, no!</i>
<i>Number nine, the Indian couple is out.</i>

1170
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,640
<i>I don't believe this one.</i>

1171
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,400
<i>I feel so sorry for Rishabh and Isha.</i>

1172
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,640
<i>They're out of the championship.</i>

1173
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,280
Now we celebrate!

1174
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,960
-Sorry, sis.
-It's okay.

1175
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,640
Isha…

1176
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,320
We didn't qualify, Rishabh.

1177
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,760
We had worked so hard,
we had prepared, but the outcome?

1178
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,680
-The end result?
-It's okay.

1179
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,960
Look at them.

1180
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,480
He knocked us out of the
competition with his mind games.

1181
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,840
Just hang on for a moment, I'll be back.
I've to attend to this.

1182
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,200
Isha, you look unhappy.

1183
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,680
What did you say to me that day?

1184
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,720
Give it your best shot.

1185
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,440
You'll definitely lose the competition.

1186
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,520
Oh, baby! Cheer up.

1187
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,200
There's always next year.

1188
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,880
-Rishabh…
-Don't worry, sweetheart.

1189
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,000
Darling, some of your
fans require a selfie.

1190
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,360
Come away now.

1191
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,320
Isha…

1192
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:42,800
Isha I--

1193
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,240
I'd told you…

1194
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,280
that I can't be anybody's dance partner.

1195
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,520
Look!

1196
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,840
Despite all our efforts…

1197
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,680
we couldn't save your dance academy.

1198
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,640
But we tried our best.

1199
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,080
We did everything we could.

1200
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,560
It's so easy for you to say, Rishabh,
that we tried our best.

1201
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,160
Because your life's not gonna change.

1202
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,680
But for me, you know what I lost today?

1203
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,880
I lost everything.

1204
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,160
Please let me be.

1205
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,680
You don't understand
the pain of losing someone.

1206
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,360
You're right.

1207
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,760
How would I know the
pain of losing someone?

1208
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,000
Rishabh!

1209
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,000
Hey, Rishabh!

1210
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,680
Hey! Listen--

1211
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,840
Pablo came up to me today.

1212
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,480
And he said, "Hey, listen, man!

1213
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,600
Mr. Always Happy Sadanand,
where is Rishabh?"

1214
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,520
I told him in advance.

1215
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:10,320
I said, "Stop irritating me, Uncle Pablo!"

1216
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,280
He said, "Uncle?"

1217
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,400
I asked him to look at the night sky.

1218
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,840
I asked, "Have you ever
seen a crow flying at night?"

1219
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,400
He was confused.

1220
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,840
He said, "I didn't get it!"

1221
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,400
-I said, "I caught it!"
-You should've told him…

1222
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,600
that Rishabh is busy
shattering people's dreams.

1223
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,880
Because I don't know what it means…

1224
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,000
to lose someone.

1225
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,080
Hey, Guru!

1226
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,440
William and his mom

1227
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,880
have conspired to kick you
and Isha out of the competition.

1228
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,120
Rishabh…

1229
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,600
don't worry.

1230
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,000
The day you get
out of your mental rut…

1231
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,800
you will realize that

1232
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,240
every winner has started
his journey by losing!

1233
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,480
I'll talk to Isha and--

1234
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,720
I know you have lost miserably!

1235
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,920
But I also know you're
stubborn enough to not give up!

1236
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,240
I'm sure!

1237
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,200
Hello, London.
I am Hayat Sikandar.

1238
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,680
I'm the one who
uploaded Rishabh's video.

1239
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,320

{\an8}<i>The Bradford Council has been trolled at</i>

1244
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
{\an8}<i>Sir Anton McLean,</i>
<i>ballroom dancing's living legend,</i>

1245
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,760
{\an8}<i>has claimed the commissioner's</i>
<i>adaptation of the new rules</i>

1246
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,880
{\an8}<i>to be totally unprecedented.</i>

1247
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,360
{\an8}<i>Dancer Rishabh who once</i>
<i>suffered from an emotional disorder,</i>

1248
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,560
<i>a post-traumatic stress disorder,</i>

1249
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,880
{\an8}<i>was unable to get on the dance floor.</i>

1250
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,480
{\an8}<i>Now he has become London's</i>
<i>recent dancing sensation.</i>

1251
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,440
Isha, there are very few
people like him in this world.

1252
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,200
I don't think any dance partner will
be willing to do what he did for you.

1253
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,640
<i>This sullen</i>

1254
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:20,840
<i>Silence</i>

1255
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:29,040
<i>Says something today</i>

1256
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:38,080
<i>Why did I feel</i>

1257
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:43,960
<i>Like this was</i>

1258
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:53,360
<i>The sound of my heart breaking</i>

1259
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:08,400
<i>You went away without a word</i>

1260
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:15,120
<i>My goals have deserted me ever since</i>

1261
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,560
<i>I only see roads on my path</i>

1262
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,560
<i>Why are my feet moving away?</i>

1263
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,400
<i>Please stop me</i>

1264
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,920
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

1265
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,040
<i>Don't go!</i>

1266
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:40,640
<i>Don't break my heart!</i>

1267
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,280
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

1268
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,200
<i>Don't go!</i>

1269
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:55,480
<i>Don't break my heart!</i>

1270
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,680
<i>You've won and I've lost</i>

1271
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:08,320
<i>Turn our hearts back around again</i>

1272
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,400
<i>So, baby!</i>

1273
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,600
<i>Don't go!</i>

1274
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:24,320
<i>Don't break my heart!</i>

1275
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:29,840
<i>You've won and I've lost</i>

1276
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:36,880
<i>Turn our hearts back around again</i>

1277
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,040
<i>Baby!</i>

1278
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,280
<i>My baby!</i>

1279
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,400
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

1280
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,800
<i>Don't go!</i>

1281
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,320
I knew…

1282
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,480
that I'd find you here…

1283
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,920
near this lighthouse.

1284
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,000
I didn't get you that day.

1285
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,120
But, today, I understand why this
was an inspiration for you.

1286
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,960
Remember you'd said,

1287
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:24,600
"This lighthouse faces
every single storm alone."

1288
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,000
Yes, but there's a problem
with being alone.

1289
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,720
If it breaks in the face of a huge storm,

1290
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,760
nobody would ever know about it.

1291
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,320
I would know, Rishabh.

1292
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,680
I know it all.

1293
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,320
How can you just ignore a
petition of over four million citizens?

1294
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,880
Because the Bradford Council
is not a neighborhood club

1295
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,000
that a group of silly young
geeks like you can sham

1296
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,840
on your own whims and fancy.

1297
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,920
You go ahead and make as
many of these petitions as you wish.

1298
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,800
But just beware of any legal suit
defamation from us.

1299
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,000
Your excellency, I'm taken aback.

1300
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,600
What makes you personally come
down to the council's offices, sir?

1301
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,080
Cottenham…

1302
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,560
your ways of functioning…

1303
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,280
are bringing much ignominy…

1304
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,400
to my foundation
and that concerns me…

1305
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,600
as it's all over BBC and CNN.

1306
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,080
Well, in fact, one of them has
gone ahead and even written…

1307
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,440
to her majesty's office!

1308
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,520
That's what brings me…

1309
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,960
personally here.

1310
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,880
As one of the oldest
living trustees…

1311
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,400
I must remind you…

1312
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,960
that this championship

1313
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,640
was founded to encourage…

1314
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,520
passionate young dancers,

1315
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,040
to keep alive this
art of ballroom dancing.

1316
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,240
Today such talent is suffering…

1317
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,640
because of your sullen new rule

1318
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,680
of ten qualifying finale couples,

1319
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,080
from the traditionally fixed 15.

1320
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,560
That boy Rishabh…

1321
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:27,000
has to be in this year's championship.

1322
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,440
One, two, three…

1323
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,680
For heaven's sake, Isha!
Sorry!

1324
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:43,240
I think you don't care about rehearsing
for the Bradford finals!

1325
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,000
And where the hell is Rishabh?

1326
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,040
Hayat Sikandar, you've just
walked all over my dance class.

1327
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,440
Thank you, guys. That'll be all for today.

1328
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,200
Oh, yes! Exactly. Dance class.

1329
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,200
What's going on?

1330
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,520
When will you guys start
rehearsing for the finals?

1331
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,600
We didn't qualify for the finals.

1332
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,560
Please don't rub salt in my wounds, man.
I'm in no mood for these jokes.

1333
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,200
Listen to me, silly!

1334
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,680
You should try stepping out of
the dance hall once.

1335
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,480
Do you know which dance video
has been trending in the UK?

1336
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,360
Listen, stop joking.

1337
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,200
-Seriously.
-Just take a look.

1338
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,200
<i>That boy Rishabh</i>

1339
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,720
-<i>has to be in this year's championship.</i>
-Really?

1340
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,000
You guys are into the finals.

1341
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,200
Pal, you should've seen Harriet's face

1342
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,800
when she had to sign your forms.

1343
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,680
I sneaked a selfie!

1344
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,160
No, you didn't!

1345
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,680
We won't get to see this
expression every time!

1346
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,040
Look!

1347
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,720
Mr. Singh!

1348
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,800
Please come in.

1349
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,960
What could I do?

1350
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,440
They always send me to
deliver the bank's notices.

1351
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,240
-Bank notice?
-Yes.

1352
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,920
But I have been paying all the
minimum payments for the past two months.

1353
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,480
There's a crowdfunding website.

1354
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,400
comeforwardlondon.com!

1355
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,360
-comeforwardlondon.com?
-The CEO of that website is

1356
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,760
Sir Anton McLean.

1357
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,360
-He's a huge fan of ballroom dancing.
-Sir Anton McLean?

1358
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,640
He called me up and said…

1359
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,800
"This dance academy
cannot be shut down."

1360
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,840
He had seen Rishabh's dance videos
on social media and he loved them.

1361
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,760
He paid off your loan.

1362
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,600
The paper you're holding…

1363
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,280
is a "No Objection Certificate"
from your bank.

1364
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,160
You've achieved this because you
and Rishabh have worked really hard!

1365
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,560
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

1366
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,320
Thank you!

1367
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,520
-You're welcome, ma'am.
-Thank you!

1368
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,800
You did it!

1369
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,440
<i>London, this is live</i>
<i>from Elstree Aerodrome.</i>

1370
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,400
The Great Bradford Ballroom
and Latin Championship

1371
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,200
is traditionally held every
year at this historic war ground

1372
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,320
to evoke feelings of love,
music, dance and compassion.

1373
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,280
Everything that ballroom
dancing truly stands for.

1374
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,880
And tonight,
it's here at this World War II airstrip.

1375
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:23,240
The finale of the Great Bradford Ballroom
and Latin Championship is coming live.

1376
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,200
Indians will definitely
win on the British dance floor.

1377
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,160
Definitely.

1378
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,480
Presenting our first finalist couple,

1379
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,240
it's two-time reigning champion,
William and Jessica.

1380
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,560
<i>We begin the ball!</i>

1381
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,840
<i>Quickstep solo!</i>

1382
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,520
<i>I saw you on the train that day</i>

1383
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,640
<i>Some blurry shadows in our way</i>

1384
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:56,280
<i>Every day I try to find you</i>
<i>And it's draining out my pass</i>

1385
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,560
<i>To be close and catch a few glimpses</i>

1386
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,840
<i>This ain't lookin' like those ol' jinxes</i>

1387
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,080
<i>Now you're here</i>
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

1388
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,920
<i>Just wanna ask you this at last</i>

1389
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,600
<i>Hello handsome!</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

1390
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:15,200
<i>Hello handsome!</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

1391
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,280
<i>You are so handsome</i>

1392
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,720
<i>I want to kiss you in public right now</i>

1393
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,080
<i>Hello handsome!</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

1394
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,960
William! Baby!

1395
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,720
{\an8}<i>William and Jessica, rank one.</i>

1396
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,320
{\an8}William is a champion!

1397
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,240
{\an8}<i>Shawn and Anastasia, rank two.</i>

1398
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,640
{\an8}<i>Rank six!</i>

1399
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,680
{\an8}<i>Rank four!</i>

1400
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,840
{\an8}<i>Rank three!</i>

1401
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,320
{\an8}<i>Rank eight!</i>

1402
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,720
And now welcoming our
new favorite couple,

1403
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,800
it's Rishabh and Isha!

1404
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,080
I love you, Rishabh!

1405
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,600
Go, Rishabh! Go!

1406
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,200
<i>Don't stay far, come closer!</i>

1407
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,520
<i>Hold me close, hey lover!</i>

1408
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,560
<i>Show some love</i>

1409
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,560
<i>Show me what you got</i>

1410
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,200
<i>Let the world know we ain't no different</i>

1411
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,520
<i>Let them hold their breath</i>
<i>Just for a moment</i>

1412
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,280
<i>Show them what we got</i>

1413
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,160
<i>-We are one!</i>
-Rishabh! Isha!

1414
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,600
<i>-We are one!</i>
-Rishabh! Isha!

1415
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,360
<i>-We are one!</i>
-Rishabh! Isha!

1416
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,280
<i>You and me!</i>

1417
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,200
<i>We are one!</i>

1418
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,040
<i>We are one!</i>

1419
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,440
<i>We are one!</i>

1420
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,400
<i>You and me!</i>

1421
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,160
{\an8}<i>Rishabh and Isha, rank ten.</i>

1422
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,680
{\an8}This Indian couple!

1423
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,480
-They have stolen my heart once again.
-That was amazing.

1424
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,440
They begin as the new favorites
here to win the championship tonight.

1425
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,920
It's round two, ladies and gentlemen,
group performance.

1426
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,800
<i>Let me write my name all over your body</i>

1427
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,880
<i>And let your soul, soak it all</i>

1428
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,560
<i>Let it be my name which</i>
<i>Drips down your skin</i>

1429
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,600
<i>As you dance in passion along me</i>

1430
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,720
<i>Let it be my name burning</i>
<i>In your passionate eyes</i>

1431
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,920
<i>As I gaze deep into them</i>

1432
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,520
<i>Finding myself</i>

1433
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,640
<i>Let me be you while loving you</i>

1434
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,840
<i>And you become me</i>

1435
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,960
That rookie Indian couple
looks quite promising.

1436
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,680
<i>They can really give</i>
<i>a tough time to the others.</i>

1437
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,760
<i>Come on, baby</i>
<i>Let me show you how I feel</i>

1438
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,240
<i>Let's doobie-dooba, doobie-dooba</i>
<i>Heel-to-heel</i>

1439
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,880
<i>Yeah, keep your body movin'</i>
<i>As you come to me</i>

1440
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,960
<i>Let's doobie-dooba, doobie-dooba</i>
<i>Heel-to-heel</i>

1441
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,680
<i>The way you dance along me</i>

1442
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,160
<i>The way you touch me, hold me</i>

1443
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,440
<i>This is the way I want to be held</i>

1444
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,960
<i>So, dance!</i>

1445
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,560
<i>Come on, dance!</i>

1446
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,880
<i>So, dance!</i>

1447
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,680
<i>Come on, dance!</i>

1448
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:22,520
<i>I really really love you</i>
<i>Tell me, love, don't you?</i>

1449
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,360
<i>Come on!</i>

1450
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,960
<i>Dancers, ready for Rumba.</i>

1451
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:41,480
<i>Tender touch is not much</i>

1452
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:49,000
<i>Still, I wait for your tender touch</i>

1453
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:56,960
<i>Oh, your smile!</i>
<i>Magic much!</i>

1454
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:04,400
<i>But I long for that tender touch</i>

1455
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,040
<i>So romantic!</i>

1456
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:13,680
<i>Let me touch you, feel you</i>
<i>Sing you like a song!</i>

1457
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:20,160
<i>Been so long, been so long!</i>

1458
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,400
<i>It's been so long!</i>

1459
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:29,480
<i>Been so long, baby!</i>

1460
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,200
<i>Been so long!</i>

1461
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,640
Look at William's face.

1462
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,280
<i>We break now for ten minutes</i>

1463
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,080
<i>for the theater round costume change,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1464
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:46,080
<i>The rookie couple has</i>
<i>marginally got into the top five.</i>

1465
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,240
<i>They look like the weakest couple here.</i>

1466
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,960
<i>May the best dancer win.</i>

1467
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

1468
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:54,640
I'm here with the legend,
the famous Lady Cottenham,

1469
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:58,440
who was sensational in her
performances way back in 1988

1470
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,520
and 89 when she was crowned

1471
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,240
two years in a row.
How are you?

1472
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,480
-Good. How are you?
-Good, thank you.

1473
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,560
Now you are the commissioner of the
governing dance council.

1474
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,680
And your son, William, is
the two-time reigning champion.

1475
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,240
So, what we want to know is

1476
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:14,040
how do you feel standing
here looking at him?

1477
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,840
Well, it's going to be
a historic moment for me

1478
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,360
just as it will be for him

1479
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,520
because a hat trick win
has never been achieved

1480
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,320
in the history of the championship.

1481
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,120
I remember losing out on it
just marginally back in 1990.

1482
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:30,320
His mother was a dancer as well?

1483
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,760
Dear God!

1484
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,160
That's the reason…

1485
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,440
she got us dancing to her tunes!

1486
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,480
William and Jessica,
have been really great.

1487
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,840
We're so happy that we got to the finals.

1488
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,400
It's a lot about communication,

1489
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,000
-especially with lifts and trust.
-Yeah.

1490
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,280
And you know you need that.

1491
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,680
This year there was a new
Indian couple that we really loved.

1492
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,840
Rishabh and Isha? Who?

1493
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:06,040
<i>William has been undefeated in</i>
<i>the theater round for many years.</i>

1494
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,840
<i>Rishabh and Isha are at</i>
<i>number four now.</i>

1495
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,800
<i>They'll have to get an</i>
<i>impossible full score in this round.</i>

1496
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,080
Compose yourself, my son.

1497
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,480
A champion is a winner in his
mind first and then on the dance floor.

1498
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,840
And I know you're this champion.

1499
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,480
But, Mother,
I know this in my mind already.

1500
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,240
I will be the reason for their defeat.

1501
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,400
Just watch this performance.

1502
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,360
Yes! You go!

1503
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,320
Deal with them on the dance floor.

1504
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,760
And I'll deal with the
grubby politics of dancing.

1505
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:41,120
Before you become the
reason for Isha's loss tonight,

1506
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,640
I want to remind you of
that blunder from your past.

1507
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,760
You cannot dance anymore.

1508
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,240
So, back off.

1509
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,080
You don't belong on a dance floor!

1510
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,640
You belong in a rehab center, Rishabh.

1511
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:21,960
Rishabh!

1512
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,320
Rishabh, why haven't you changed yet?

1513
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,560
It's time.

1514
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,160
I'm going to change.

1515
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,320
Where are you going?

1516
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,480
It's time for our performance.

1517
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Have you ever sat at the bank
of the holy Ganges and watched…

1518
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,560
a pyre burning all night?

1519
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,760
No.

1520
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,320
I have, Sada.

1521
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,880
If one wants to unite with Lord Shiva…

1522
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,400
the body has to turn to ashes.

1523
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,280
Listen! Listen!

1524
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,000
I can't find Rishabh.

1525
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,400
Do you know where he is?

1526
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:12,960
-Yes.
-Sada, please!

1527
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,920
-Where is he?
-He's at the Ganges!

1528
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,400
-Ganges?
-Yes.

1529
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,840
We have to get ready.

1530
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,280
I think he has finally stopped
counting the waves

1531
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,880
-because of you.
-What?

1532
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,880
I'm sure he'll take the plunge!

1533
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,400
-Where is he?
-Hail Lord Mahadev.

1534
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:51,960
<i>Why did you slip off my hands?</i>

1535
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,720
<i>Why did bonds of dedication break?</i>

1536
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:03,840
<i>Why does courage evade me?</i>

1537
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,720
<i>Why do dreams seem fake?</i>

1538
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,480
<i>Like a lamp on some ghat</i>

1539
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,240
<i>I burn like a pyre!</i>

1540
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,120
<i>Get salvation in these ashes</i>

1541
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,680
<i>By turning into a corpse</i>
<i>And finding Shiva</i>

1542
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:27,720
<i>I turn into a dwelling for Shiva</i>

1543
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:35,120
<i>I still have light within</i>

1544
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:41,080
<i>In myself, I see faith again!</i>

1545
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:46,720
<i>I will change the course of fate</i>

1546
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:52,400
<i>Here comes a new dawn</i>

1547
01:35:52,520 --> 01:36:00,200
<i>It's time for the darkness to fade</i>

1548
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:21,600
<i>The path I looked away from</i>

1549
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,000
<i>I've come back to it</i>

1550
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:32,920
<i>Every ray of hope faded away</i>

1551
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,840
<i>And the eyes are wet</i>

1552
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:41,440
<i>These waves of agony are never-ending</i>

1553
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,280
<i>I don't fear the storm</i>

1554
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,520
<i>You drown to rise above</i>

1555
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:12,080
<i>I turn into a dwelling for Shiva</i>

1556
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:20,120
<i>I still have light within</i>

1557
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,640
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1558
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,320
Can we move Rishabh and Isha's performance
further down the order, please?

1559
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,200
Sorry, but I've already done it for you.

1560
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,080
I can't.

1561
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,160
I'm sure there's something
you can do. It's a request.

1562
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,600
-Please.
-Sorry, but no.

1563
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,920
-What happened?
-The organizers won't help us.

1564
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
They cannot push the
performance beyond this.

1565
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:07,920
What do we do?

1566
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,240
<i>Rishabh and Isha!</i>

1567
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,440
<i>Cue for you, 60 seconds, left wing.</i>

1568
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,480
<i>-Wow! Look at that!</i>
-William! William!

1569
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,760
-<i>William looks like a champion.</i>
-William! William!

1570
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,240
William! William!

1571
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,560
-Where's Rishabh?
-William! William!

1572
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,880
William! William!

1573
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,280
William! William!

1574
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,880
William! William!

1575
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,360
Where were you?

1576
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,120
Now come on!

1577
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,880
We don't have time, come on!

1578
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,320
How does the scoring work?

1579
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,200
William and Jessica are ranked number one.

1580
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:18,440
Rishabh and Isha have to score
45 out of the available 50 points.

1581
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,360
But nobody has ever
scored 45 points in this round.

1582
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:36,440
<i>You and I face each other</i>

1583
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,240
<i>Who are we waiting for?</i>

1584
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:45,920
<i>The time has stood still</i>

1585
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,360
<i>The heart confesses</i>

1586
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:55,320
<i>What can I say?</i>

1587
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,720
<i>We've said it all</i>

1588
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:04,600
<i>The silence speaks to us</i>

1589
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:08,680
<i>In hushed tones</i>

1590
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,160
<i>Darling!</i>

1591
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,800
<i>It's time to dance</i>

1592
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,480
Go, Rishabh!

1593
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:21,320
<i>Darling!</i>

1594
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:26,240
<i>It's time to dance</i>

1595
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,440
<i>Darling!</i>

1596
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:35,040
<i>It's time to dance</i>

1597
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:54,200
<i>A little sky and let's touch the earth too</i>

1598
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,320
Yes!

1599
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:03,160
<i>Let's fulfill all our unfulfilled desires</i>

1600
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:12,680
<i>Words can't express these feelings</i>

1601
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:21,760
<i>I sense them in your eyes</i>

1602
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:28,600
<i>What can I say?</i>

1603
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:32,440
<i>We've said it all</i>

1604
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:37,880
<i>The silence speaks to us</i>

1605
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:42,120
<i>In hushed tones</i>

1606
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,400
<i>Darling!</i>

1607
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:51,200
<i>It's time to dance</i>

1608
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:54,920
<i>Darling!</i>

1609
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,600
<i>It's time to dance</i>

1610
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:09,280
-Isha!
-Rishabh! Rishabh!

1611
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:28,960
Trust me.

1612
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,080
She's okay?

1613
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:37,240
Shocking!

1614
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,960
-Rishabh! Isha!
-Rishabh! Isha!

1615
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,040
-Rishabh! Isha!
-Yes!

1616
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,800
-Come on, Isha!
-Rishabh! Isha!

1617
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,360
-Rishabh! Isha!
-Rishabh! Isha!

1618
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,320
-Rishabh! Isha!
-Rishabh! Isha!

1619
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,480
-Rishabh! Isha!
-Rishabh! Isha!

1620
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:13,680
<i>What can I say?</i>

1621
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:17,320
<i>We've said it all</i>

1622
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,560
<i>The silence speaks to us</i>

1623
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:26,520
<i>In hushed tones</i>

1624
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,560
<i>Darling!</i>

1625
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,840
<i>It's time to dance</i>

1626
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:39,720
<i>Darling!</i>

1627
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:45,880
<i>It's time to dance</i>
