1
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,250
Mom,
you have a letter from Punjab.

2
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,416
I won't be able to go there.

3
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,541
Why don't you go to Punjab, dear?

4
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,708
Why? What will I do there?

5
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,958
They've invited us after
such a long time.

6
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,458
It's a kid's birthday.

7
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,666
If I go there, they will start
talking about the past.

8
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,916
That I ran away and got
married to a foreigner.

9
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,333
They will taunt me too, because
my marriage didn't last long.

10
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,250
-They are your mother's family.
-You should go there.

11
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,458
But Mom...

12
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,000
I won't go there alone.

13
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,416
Don't go there alone.

14
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,291
Take Kash, Kashmir with you.

15
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,333
And who will convince Kash?

16
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,041
I won't take to her.

17
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,125
We've received a letter
from Mom's village.

18
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,750
Oh, I see. After all these years?

19
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,208
What does it say?

20
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,041
They have asked her
to visit Punjab.

21
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,583
So will Manjeeti go?

22
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,208
No.

23
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,625
She wants us to go.

24
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,583
What will I do there?

25
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,333
That's what I told her.

26
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,125
We have no reason to go there.

27
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,541
And we don't know anyone
there either.

28
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,541
Would you like some coffee?

29
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,333
I won't go there.

30
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,500
...then why did you divorce her?

31
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,166
Yeah, dear?

32
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,208
Anything else?

33
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,500
She is Nicole's mother.

34
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,250
Have a safe trip.

35
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,666
And don't talk to strangers.

36
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,458
Let's go, already.
Aren't you done yet?

37
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't blame me if we
miss the flight.

38
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,333
Ask Kash to dress appropriately.

39
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,958
Well, why don't you try
telling that to her?

40
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,458
Okay then, I'll get going.

41
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,208
Both of you, don't go for a
coffee or something now.

42
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,958
Go back to your respectable homes.

43
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,958
What's the song?
<span style="style.default_1">When we shall get together...</span>

44
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,625
<span style="style.default_1">There's a lot to share</span>

45
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,625
Father, I won't stay here.

46
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,500
Uncle loves to curse.

47
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,875
-Let me come back to the village.
-I'll help in the fields. I promise.

48
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,208
It's okay,
all uncles love to curse.

49
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,833
Don't worry.
You should work hard, son.

50
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,750
He humiliates me over everything.

51
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,375
You cannot expect any respect
after you get your aunt married.

52
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't you hear me curse
your mother's brothers?

53
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,000
Now behave and get to work.

54
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,666
He is afraid of a few curses.

55
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,708
-Phinda?
-Yes?

56
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,416
-Get me two cold drinks.
-Okay.

57
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,541
-Sure, go ahead and drink them.
-You don't like to work, do you?

58
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,041
You only enjoy having
cold drinks.

59
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,375
You are kept here on
a salary of 3,500 rupees.

60
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,166
And you drink cold drinks
worth 4,000 rupees.

61
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,833
Drink it. I'll deduct it from your salary.

62
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,791
Take it.

63
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Take it back.

64
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,583
Too much sweet causes diabetes.

65
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,958
There is an airport pick up
tomorrow. Inform Satta about it.

66
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,041
Satta!

67
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,125
Listen,
those girls are from Canada.

68
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,541
Ask him to be careful. There
shouldn't be any complaints.

69
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,666
Girls.

70
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,041
From Canada.

71
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,666
If they are from Canada, then
Amrik Singh will pick them up.

72
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,208
Hello, where are you?

73
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,708
I am right here. A red Innova is
parked next to the dustbin.

74
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,083
-2985.
-We cannot see anyone.

75
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,000
I am walking towards the gate
now. I've gelled my hair.

76
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,750
I am wearing blue jeans.

77
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,916
I'll be damned.

78
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,000
Hot chicks.

79
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,041
I want just one.

80
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,208
Good morning, ma'am.

81
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,875
Excuse me, ma'am.

82
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,250
I am not a driver. I am the owner.
But I'll help you, ladies.

83
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,083
Just put the luggage in the car.

84
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay.

85
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,583
Here.

86
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,875
You too.

87
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,250
I know you must be hungry after
such a long journey.

88
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,416
Take it.

89
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,541
I'll some buy peanuts
on the way too.

90
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,291
Will we manage to reach
without the car?

91
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,208
-Or will you have to drive it?
-Consider this an aeroplane.

92
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Consider yourself at
the destination.

93
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:17,583
<span style="style.default_1">I'll buy you a diamond-studded anklet</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

94
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,333
Let me share something with you.

95
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,666
You shouldn't tell anyone
that you're from Canada.

96
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,333
People here are as crazy
about Canadians...

97
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,208
as Discovery Channel
is about snakes.

98
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,458
You don't need to worry about me.

99
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,041
I am quite chilled.

100
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,833
I am not interested
in going to Canada.

101
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,916
But I would like to give
you a tour of Punjab.

102
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,625
Look at all the green fields...

103
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,958
filled with golden gems...

104
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,333
Look, that's a pumping
station. It is quite useful.

105
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,125
It helps water the fields.

106
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,500
There are many more uses of it.

107
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,250
How did you like our
colorful Punjab?

108
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,666
This is called... a speed bump.

109
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:05,083
<span style="style.default_1">I'll buy you a diamond-studded anklet</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

110
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,291
-They are here. Come on, everyone.
-They are here.

111
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,541
Come.

112
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,000
Our daughters are here.

113
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,000
-Come here, dear.
-God bless you, dear.

114
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,125
-Listen!
-Yes?

115
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,708
I'm judging her by the
amount of clothes she is wearing.

116
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,791
Dear, any problem in the way...

117
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,750
her clothes could have easily
fitted in a pouch.

118
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,166
Why did she bother
carrying a bag?

119
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,208
-Wonderful.
-Hello, my dear.

120
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,708
Hello.

121
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,291
The other one dresses like us.

122
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,416
-How did you like our Punjab?
-Meet them first.

123
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,166
You can find faults
in them later.

124
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,375
My darling daughters.

125
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,208
I have been yearning
to see you two.

126
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,791
I have waited for you
standing on one foot.

127
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,083
Come on, Charno. Stop lying.

128
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,958
It's not like they would've
returned...

129
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,458
if you had waited standing
on both your feet.

130
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,916
How restless of you!

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,958
Wonderful! Amazing! My daughters
are finally here.

132
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,541
I am so happy.

133
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,208
She has such curly hair.

134
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,166
Oh, my God!

135
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,750
Stop it.

136
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,833
Go kids, they are your aunts.
Touch their feet.

137
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,500
Come on, kids.
Touch the feet of your aunts.

138
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,791
-Come on.
-I seek your blessings, aunt.

139
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,041
-Come on.
-I seek your blessings, younger aunt.

140
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,125
-Hello, aunt. Hello.
-Both of them are very naughty.

141
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,375
-Come here.
-Hello, aunt.

142
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,583
-Hello.
-Tie your hair.

143
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,000
They know that we
are their aunts.

144
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,625
Now how about telling us how
is everybody related to us?

145
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,583
Sure, dear. Right away.

146
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,875
-Labhu, please stand with your family.
-Okay.

147
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,208
Come on.

148
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,041
Dear, I am your mother's youngest
brother, Ajaib Singh.

149
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,458
She is my wife, Charno.

150
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,916
He is my son, Neeta.

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,791
-Hello.
-He is my grandson, Gopi.

152
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,458
He has come to stay with us.
He is my daughter's son.

153
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,375
Just like you two have.

154
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,833
-Labhu, your turn.
-Go on.

155
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,208
I am your mother's eldest brother,
Labhu. She is my wife, Mukho.

156
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,333
Come on now.

157
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,083
How about telling them
my real name?

158
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,416
Dear,
I am your aunt Mukhtiar Kaur.

159
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,625
Mukhtiar Kaurji.

160
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,041
He is my eldest son.
Come forward.

161
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,625
-Hello.
-She is his wife, our daughter-in-law.

162
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,958
-Hello.
-Meet their children. Anmol and Babbu.

163
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,458
-That's my daughter, Jassi.
-Hello.

164
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,500
-Hello!
-She is studying... what does she study?

165
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,750
-Yes, nursing.
-That's right.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,333
Come on in, dear.

167
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,000
-Let's have some tea.
-Let's go.

168
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,333
-Come on. Come inside.
-Come on, dear. Let's go.

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,083
Mother, have some tea.

170
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,541
I don't want it.

171
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,875
Take it back.

172
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,958
Give them to the ones
sitting outside.

173
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,541
They are already having it, Mother.

174
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,041
I gave them some biscuits too.

175
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,208
The ones who have sidelined this
old women, may you be doomed.

176
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,416
I didn't let my daughter enter
this house for 20 years.

177
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,666
You have hurt my feelings
by inviting them home.

178
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,541
You will never stop complaining.

179
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,250
Let me know once you are done.

180
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,500
Give it here.

181
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,125
Oh no. Here you go.

182
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,750
I won't eat till they stay here.

183
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,375
As you wish, Mother.

184
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,791
I am such a fool.

185
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,791
Why did I bother getting tea
when I know you are angry.

186
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,541
It's okay. I won't make any
dinner for you then.

187
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,833
-It will save some dough.
-Are you going to leave or not?

188
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,166
I am going, Mother.

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
-Let me run.
-Stupid woman.

190
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,958
Oh God, I pray that a lizard
falls into their dinner.

191
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,541
I won't be eating it anyway.

192
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,666
He makes noise like
a rusty engine.

193
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,458
Look at that.

194
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,250
Aunt, what is this?

195
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,708
This tea is very sweet.

196
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,583
Get me a pill for diabetes.

197
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:45,958
Right.

198
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,500
Here. Take it.

199
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,583
Uncle, I am taking a sprayer.
I need to spray the field.

200
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,708
Take it. They don't even
let you enjoy tea.

201
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,875
People these days don't
even offer you any tea.

202
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,083
Eat it, dear.

203
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,791
-You too have some.
-Yes, have some.

204
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,791
Why sister couldn't make it?

205
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,250
Mom couldn't leave her office.

206
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,750
I am sure it gets quite cold
when it snows there.

207
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,958
Then the kids must be filling
their stomachs with ice.

208
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,375
Look at these kids.

209
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,458
They are always close
to the refrigerator.

210
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,375
They eat the ice as soon
as it is formed.

211
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,416
The driver wants biscuits.

212
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,333
Give him two pieces.

213
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,708
-Take it, son.
-Go on.

214
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,833
What's your name, young man?

215
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,083
Amrik.

216
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,083
Amrik Singh, we will need your
car for another few days.

217
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,000
-Okay.
-Cool.

218
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,875
-So why don't you stay here?
-Okay.

219
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,541
-We will set up a bed for you there.
-There?

220
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,416
I'll go home. We have some
construction work going on.

221
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,708
Fine, as you wish.

222
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,541
But don't be late,
they can be quite rude.

223
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,791
-Okay.
-Here.

224
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,375
Give me one, son.

225
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,708
He isn't giving me a biscuit now.

226
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,708
Later, he will have to hand
over his aunt to me.

227
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,625
Doesn't he look just like you?

228
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,166
Maggar,
the expensive butter worked.

229
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,833
She compared me to a foreigner.

230
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,750
I know I am handsome.

231
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,875
But your sister-in-law
is no less either.

232
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,916
Right? You also know that...

233
00:16:54,916 --> 00:17:00,708
<span style="style.default_1">All my feelings will reach her</span>

234
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:08,708
<span style="style.default_1">When my soul will approach her</span>

235
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:18,333
<span style="style.default_1">All my feelings will reach her</span>

236
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:24,166
<span style="style.default_1">When my soul will approach her</span>

237
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:29,958
<span style="style.default_1">When our breath</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Will get used to sharing space</span>

238
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,625
<span style="style.default_1">Our eyes to each other shall communicate</span>

239
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,458
<span style="style.default_1">Then it will be carefree</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It won't care about the world</span>

240
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:47,708
<span style="style.default_1">We will fall in love</span>

241
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:53,000
<span style="style.default_1">We will fall in love</span>

242
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,875
<span style="style.default_1">We will fall in love</span>

243
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,625
Jaggi, I had gone to Neeta's
house to get a sprayer.

244
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,250
They have two girls who
are here to visit them.

245
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,541
They are very beautiful.

246
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,833
One of them is tall.

247
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,333
-She's hot.
-Okay.

248
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,875
The other one is short.

249
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
-She is hot as well.
-Getting to the point is a jackpot.

250
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,250
I'll get married to one of them.

251
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,833
Then I will go abroad.

252
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,166
Done bluffing?

253
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,416
Shut up.

254
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,750
<span style="style.default_1">Villagers have already</span>
<span style="style.default_1">started eyeing them.</span>

255
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,833
Aunt, it's great that people
make everything at home here.

256
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,833
Right, dear.

257
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,458
Nothing can be compared
to a home-cooked meal.

258
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,041
I heard people make liquor
at home as well.

259
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,208
Yes, dear.

260
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,875
Your uncle too used to make it.

261
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,666
Police broke a few of his bones.

262
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,000
Now he purchases it.

263
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,333
-You are back?
-Didn't you say that there was some...

264
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,208
-construction going on at home?
-That's what my father told me.

265
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,500
"The construction is on,
where will we place you?"

266
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,750
-Hence, I came back.
-Good that you came back.

267
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,083
Take the big bed
and place it under the shed.

268
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,625
-Come with me. Come on.
-Okay.

269
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,000
Aunt...

270
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,125
Hello, aunt.

271
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,041
You left in the morning.
Where have you been?

272
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,458
I went to the city
to watch a movie.

273
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,083
This great Dharamendra
was watching a movie.

274
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,375
-Take this.
-Give it here.

275
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,166
-Don't drink it.
-Take it upstairs.

276
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,708
Let's go then. Keep it aside.

277
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,375
You already drank from it.
Let's go.

278
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,250
-You are studying nursing?
-Yes, sister.

279
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,750
Don't worry.

280
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,333
I'll help you.

281
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,708
-Jassi, go and help downstairs.
-But I want to study.

282
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,041
Come on,
even after all the education...

283
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,333
you are only going
to be a nurse.

284
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,375
It's not like you will
be injecting people.

285
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,708
You will be only passing them to
the doctors. Go downstairs.

286
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,333
Yes.

287
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,458
Sit down.

288
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,750
He is my nephew, dear.

289
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,750
He coincidently came to meet me.

290
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:13,250
-He is well-educated, he has completed...
-IELTS.

291
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,291
Yes, the same.

292
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,541
How do I communicate
with an educated bunch like you.

293
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,625
You can continue talking.

294
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,916
I'll teach him a lesson.

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,916
-Damn you! You idiot!
-What's wrong?

296
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,250
-What's wrong?
-Why did I make you sit here?

297
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,458
You have the earphones
in your ears.

298
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,333
-Not my hair! Let go of my hair!
-Get out of here now.

299
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,250
-I made a mistake, aunt.
-Damn you!

300
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:18,208
Here I am working hard for you.
You have no shame.

301
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,750
He has those damned earphones
plugged into his ears.

302
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,166
Listen...

303
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,708
Yes?

304
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,375
Go...

305
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,291
Do you drink liquor?

306
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,916
Yes, I have beer sometimes.

307
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,125
I heard that homemade liquor is
easily available in Punjab.

308
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,166
Yes,
people here say that imported...

309
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,000
liquor doesn't make them roar.

310
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,791
Roar?

311
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,083
The sound you make after
you get drunk?

312
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,625
That's what it's called.

313
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,458
Can you get me a bottle?

314
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,125
-For you?
-Yes.

315
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,416
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

316
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,166
<span style="style.default_1">This is great.</span>

317
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,208
<span style="style.default_1">The daughter-in-law and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">father-in-law will get along well.</span>

<span style="style.default_1">with them over it.</span>

320
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,083

321
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,041

322

323
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,958

324
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,916
<span style="style.default_1">This warmth is refreshing</span>

325
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,375
<span style="style.default_1">I share my feelings with the sky</span>

326
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:58,208
<span style="style.default_1">Even the sights won't hold any charm</span>

<span style="style.default_1">Will sound like her name</span>

328

329
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,916

331
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:39,375

332
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:45,041
<span style="style.default_1">You will feel that you share</span>
<span style="style.default_1">One body and soul</span>

333
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:51,000

334
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:56,833

<span style="style.default_1">Will become cheerful</span>

338
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:20,625
<span style="style.default_1">We will fall in love</span>

339
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:25,791
<span style="style.default_1">We will fall in love</span>

340
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,666
<span style="style.default_1">We will fall in love</span>

341
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,041
Oh no, girl.

342
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,666
What are you doing?

343
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,916
-It's nothing, aunt.
-Don't embarrass us before the villagers.

344
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,000
At least take an onion.

345
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,375
People will say we didn't
offer any snacks.

346
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,916
Wait, I'll get you some.

347
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,083
Listen, don't feel shy.

348
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,291
There is nothing wrong in
having a sip or two.

349
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:11,208
You have to change
with the world.

350
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,250
I am not like your grandma.

351
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,791
So what if your mother had a love
marriage?

352
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,458
I have a daughter as well.

353
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,583
Parents are the only support
a child gets.

354
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:24,333
God forbid, if Jassi
falls for someone...

355
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:27,666
then I will stand by
her and support her.

356
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,458
Okay, dear. You continue drinking.

357
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,666
I'll get onions for you.

358
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:43,625
Dear, you always have earphones
in your ears.

359
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,875
How about having a conversation
with us sometimes?

360
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,166
Sure, aunt.

361
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,416
Here, have these with milk.

362
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,041
I'll hit you twice now.

363
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,708
You are eating all day long,
yet you are never sated.

364
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:57,833
Give it back.

365
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,625
Go away.

366
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:07,666
Dear, you should have a lot
of milk and buttermilk.

367
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,625
Don't make your mother complain...

368
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,583
that we have made her
daughters look dull.

369
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,125
Aunt, I am dieting.

370
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,750
And I am doing IELTS.

371
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,791
-How is education related to food?
-You should eat well.

372
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,500
You need to get married eventually.

373
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,375
I'll find a suitable
match for you.

374
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,708
Whether you like it or not.

375
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,083
The boy should be good.

376
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,791
Color doesn't matter, right?

377
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,291
Amrik,
they must have air condition...

378
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,083
even in the shed in Canada.

379
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,833
No, it's quite cold out there.

380
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,416
Come on,
so what if it's cold out there?

381
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,250
I am sure they enter the
shed to escape the cold.

382
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,916
Move, you blackie.

383
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,916
What have I done?

384
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,208
Can't you eat later?

385
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,625
Liquor is good.

386
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,416
But not good for her.

387
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,833
Henceforth, in this house,
women will eat before men.

388
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,083
Aunt has had liquor.

389
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,791
I think she is drunk.

390
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,375
If you cook then you
should eat first.

391
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,291
Come on, sit down.

392
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,916
-Eat in front of me.
-We will have it later, dear.

393
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,750
Eat right now.

394
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,416
Brother,
who brought the liquor for her?

395
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,250
Liquor makes you feel different.

396
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,750
Fennel seeds water doesn't
even help you whistle...

397
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,916
so roaring is a
far-fetched thing.

398
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,166
-Go to sleep, dear.
-You should be proud, ladies.

399
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,250
Go to sleep, dear.

400
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,708
God bless you, dear.

401
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:41,083
-Why should I go to sleep?
-First finish your dinner.

402
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,041
We'll eat it, dear. We'll eat it.

403
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,708
Aunt has defeated father as well.

404
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,750
Eat it.

405
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:47,916
I don't want to eat.

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,291
Oh no, it's so spicy.

407
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,958
What's going on?

408
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,166
What's the commotion about?

409
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,750
I am sure their mother has
taught this to them.

410
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:05,208
You cannot blame anyone when
your own family is crazy.

411
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,000
They will eat last.

412
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,583
-Oh, God...
-Kash.

413
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,791
This house should get
buried underground...

414
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:13,708
but only when I am not at home.

415
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Oh, God!

416
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,083
-Uncle...
-Yes, dear?

417
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,916
Henceforth, in this house,
ladies will eat first.

418
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,125
-Okay?
-Okay. Please eat food.

419
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,708
Move aside,
I am having a meeting here.

420
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,541
Henceforth, in this house,
ladies will eat first.

421
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,958
My dear is very smart.

422
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,458
She acts wild after
getting drunk.

423
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:41,333
It's okay, I'll manage.

424
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,625
Oh no.

425
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,208
I am fed up of these doctors.

426
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:20,875
They ask me to have milk before
taking medicines.

427
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,500
Those who will see me like
this will wonder...

428
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,375
what this old woman is eating.

429
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,750
I won't eat anything
they offer.

430
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,166
It's okay. Don't worry.

431
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,041
Otherwise, I won't even eat
a morsel made by this family.

432
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,750
If I can stay hungry
all day then...

433
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:42,541
nights aren't that long either.

434
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,333
It's the medicines which
have made me weak.

435
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,958
What's your ID?

436
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,625
My ID is Brown Jat.

437
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:31,958
Go downstairs.

438
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:36,791
Shall I leave?

439
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,875
Okay, okay.

440
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,083
You should stay away
from this boy.

441
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,041
Oh really,
as if you worry about me.

442
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,875
I am not worried.

443
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,041
You two can share your meals,
as if I care.

444
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,375
Here's lemonade for you, sister.

445
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,125
-Why?
-It helps with the headache.

446
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,791
Dad too asks for that.

447
00:30:58,875 --> 00:30:59,708
Okay.

448
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,541
Okay. Okay.

449
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:10,458
Sister, when my friend's sister
came from abroad...

450
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,166
she had brought an
iPhone for him.

451
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,166
-And your friend accepted it.
-Of course.

452
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,166
Your friendship is shameless.

453
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,000
He took an iPhone
from his sister?

454
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,958
You should be friends with
such greedy people, Neeta.

455
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,916
See you didn't ask
me for an iPhone.

456
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,750
Very good.

457
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,375
My dream of having an iPhone
shall always remain a dream.

458
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,958
Neeta, give me your iPhone,
I'll charge it.

459
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,458
-Wait, I'll teach you a lesson.
-Wait. I'll teach you a lesson.

460
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,708
-Hello. Welcome.
-Be careful, son.

461
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,458
Hello, chief.

462
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:57,000
Hello! How are you doing,
Lambardar Sahib? All good?

463
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Maggar, it's not the same
as Makhan had done.

464
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,125
Why do uncles have
such big egos?

465
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,166
They keep troubling us
because of aunts.

466
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:34,916
Are you alright?

467
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:36,875
Have you never seen balloons?

468
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,250
We need to go and get cold
drinks. Let's go.

469
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,708
-Manuri?
-Yes, brother?

470
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,291
Let's go and get cold drinks.

471
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,291
Keep this in. I'll be right back.

472
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,208
-Let go of my collar.
-You let go of my shirt.

473
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,416
Let go of my collar.

474
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,500
-You let go of my shirt.
-I'll punch you.

475
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,125
-Go ahead.
-If you have the courage then go ahead.

476
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,125
You go first.

477
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,958
-If you have the courage then go ahead.
-Go ahead.

478
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,250
Stop talking and hit him.

479
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,250
-Go on.
-Today is my birthday.

480
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,083
Otherwise, I'd show you
what I am made up of.

481
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,541
-You come here.
-I am here.

482
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:04,875
Yes?

483
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,125
-They are your sisters.
-No.

484
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:10,916
I want to marry one of them and
go to Canada. Right, brother?

485
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,375
How about some music, brother?

486
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,833
<span style="style.default_1">Maggar, what do you think?</span>

487
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:20,666
<span style="style.default_1">Will it work out for me?</span>

488
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:27,125
<span style="style.default_1">And for him? Okay,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so we will marry one sister each.</span>

489
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,458
<span style="style.default_1">But he is not handsome.</span>

490
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,916
<span style="style.default_1">It's okay.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It will keep the evil eye away.</span>

491
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,958
Hello. Is everything alright?

492
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,625
It's mine.

493
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,291
-Eat something.
-Welcome. Hello.

494
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,291
The whole village is sitting
on the chair...

495
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,041
and all of you are sitting
here and cooking.

496
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,958
Why didn't you get some waiters
for the function?

497
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,250
-What else can it be?
-Didn't I explain it last night...

498
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,500
that men and women are equal.

499
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:32,916
-Don't you want to enjoy?
-Dear, there are no waiters here.

500
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,666
Here you have to do everything
on your own.

501
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,166
But aunt, she is talking about
our rights and welfare.

502
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,666
Show it to me, sister.

503
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,375
-Sister...
-You are here and that's enough.

504
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,208
Don't you have any shame?

505
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,416
You are punishing these women.

506
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:54,208
Either call for waiters or
order food from outside.

507
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,750
Charno,
she will get us into trouble.

508
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,416
Come on girls, continue working.

509
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,166
Keep cooking.
Don't let the bread stick.

510
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,750
-I barely escaped.
-Thanks for saving me.

511
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:34,041
Make some more rotis.

512
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,750
To you, dear.

513
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,958
Which sweet would you like the
black one or the white one?

514
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,541
I like the black one, dear.

515
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,166
-Tell me, who sent it?
-The aunt from Canada.

516
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,833
I wonder what those witches
must have spiked it with.

517
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,708
Their mother sent them
here to kill me.

518
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,916
Go away from here.

519
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,041
Listen... come here, dear.

520
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,666
Come here.

521
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,375
Which one of them is
more beautiful?

522
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,500
Shall I call them here?
Do you wish to meet them?

523
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,791
I am not interested. Buzz off.

524
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,250
It is very sweet.

525
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,375
Come on wish him, or are you
here only for free food?

526
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,750
God bless us all!
What has she done!

527
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,166
It's okay, have some cake.

528
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,375
-Eat it, already.
-Everybody, eat the cake.

529
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,625
Eat the cake, kids.

530
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,708
Damn, what are they doing?

531
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:13,041
-Take it.
-Aunt, I want some.

532
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:17,375
Ajaib Singh, have you ordered any snacks
or should we keep our plates down?

533
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:27,625
We got humiliated.

534
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:30,208
She is dangerously sober as well.

535
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,375
I cannot handle her.

536
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,000
I'll have to let her go.

537
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,708
Take this, Jassi.

538
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,833
-Eat it.
-The younger one is good.

539
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,041
Here, give it to the girl.

540
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,541
Don't make a fool of yourself.
Okay? Go.

541
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,375
I won't return empty-handed today.

542
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:00,166
-Where do you think you are going?
-To give lunch to Nicole.

543
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,500
Keep it down.

544
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,708
Yes?

545
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,375
What...

546
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,416
Come on.

547
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,916
Let go of my hair!
Don't punch me.

548
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,791
How many times have I told you?
Don't you understand?

549
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,583
If you try to come
closer to Nicole...

550
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,083
then you're done for.

551
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,833
Go and give it to her.

552
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,458
Idiot.

553
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,541
She is very rude to
her brother-in-law.

554
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Please eat it.

555
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,666
Thank you for caring for me.

556
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,291
Who says it's care?
I just don't like him.

557
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:46,125
Kash, you care for me.
You just don't accept it.

558
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,500
Okay tell me, what my fault is.

559
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:52,250
Mom divorced Dad, I didn't.

560
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,125
I didn't get Dad's love.

561
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,291
At least, let me get some
of my sister's love now.

562
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,500
Manjeeti's call?

563
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:20,750
How did you like my family?

564
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,625
Your mother is one angry lady.

565
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:24,916
We both haven't met her yet...

566
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,625
out of the fear of
being thrashed.

567
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,750
No,
Mother has always been like that.

568
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:31,333
But she doesn't hurt anyone.

569
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,583
She had beaten me up just once.

570
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,000
When I had worn that
flower-embroidered dress.

571
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,416
-The flower-embroidered dress?
-Yes, ask her about it.

572
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,208
Bye, good night.

573
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,333
You should go meet your grandma.

574
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,833
Kash, shall we go meet grandma?

575
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:54,291
-You want to get thrashed?
-She won't beat us up.

576
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,416
Come on, let's go.

577
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,875
Hey, boy. Give me my stick back.

578
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,875
This whole family is
after my blood.

579
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:01,541
Hey...

580
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,458
Should I do this to you?

581
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,500
Grandma, here is your stick.

582
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,000
For your own well-being,
go back the way you came.

583
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,333
Mom said she is rude but
she doesn't hurt anyone.

584
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,833
Grandma, at least hear us out.

585
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,583
I'll beat you with my stick.

586
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,791
Grandma, what grudge are
you holding against us?

587
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,875
We are here just to talk to you.

588
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,416
Talk about what?

589
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:34,416
The things your mother
taught you?

590
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,500
Fine, don't talk.

591
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,333
At least, tell us what is the
mystery of the flower dress?

592
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,333
Mom said we should talk
to you about it.

593
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:44,333
Don't trouble me.
Go away from here.

594
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,541
Grandma...

595
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,208
Mom loves you a lot.

596
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:11,666
<span style="style.default_1">You cannot even imagine</span>
<span style="style.default_1">How much I love you</span>

597
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,625
Ask him to sit outside.

598
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,583
Go and sit with Nicole.

599
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,833
I won't.

600
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,750
Don't make me hit you.
Why won't you leave?

601
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,250
Our family could have a million
things to discuss in private.

602
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,416
-Come on.
-Go away.

603
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,583
Take this.

604
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:36,000
Look brother,
you are the eldest...

605
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,208
it would be better if
you spoke to them.

606
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,958
It won't look good if I say it.

607
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,083
It's not about seniority.

608
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,833
You know
what will I tell them.

609
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:46,083
Come on, brother.
Don't delay.

610
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,333
-We will have to talk to them.
-Right.

611
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:51,041
What will the villagers say if
the younger brother does this...

612
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,708
in the presence of an
elder brother?

613
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,458
Villagers? Fine, then give
me an anti-anxiety pill.

614
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,166
What's up, bro!

615
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,583
Come on, have a seat.

616
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,208
-How are you?
-Good.

617
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,083
Whatever your girl did with
you was not right.

618
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,791
-She shouldn't have been so harsh, right?
-Which one?

619
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,041
You don't need to
hide it from me.

620
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,500
I saw her pulling your hair.

621
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,750
You two will soon get married.

622
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,708
After marriage, people tend
to get a little shameless.

623
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,041
But it is not right now.

624
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,833
No, brother. I am going to get
married to the younger one.

625
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,666
I never liked the older one. Yes.

626
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,625
-The younger one?
-Yes. She is beautiful, isn't she?

627
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,416
-No, no, no.
-Why? What's wrong?

628
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,458
I can't discuss it.

629
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,833
You should go to sleep,
my brother.

630
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,708
No please, tell me what's wrong.

631
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,791
-Nothing stays hidden from drivers.
-Yes.

632
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,375
I saw her having tobacco.

633
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,666
-For real?
-Yes.

634
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,333
-She has tobacco?
-Yes.

635
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,416
Oh, this is great.

636
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
And I feared I won't get
tobacco in Canada.

637
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,708
Both of us will have it together.
Wonderful.

638
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,458
Stand up, get up.

639
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,000
He is here to give me
a sleepless night.

640
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,583
Get lost from here.

641
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,375
You are the one who asked
me to come here.

642
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:12,458
I asked you to,
like you are some big shot.

643
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:18,750
Everyone's so nice.

644
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,333
They love us a lot.

645
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:24,333
I just wonder why Grandma
is so upset.

646
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,000
Everyone else is very nice.

647
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,416
We missed these things in Canada.

648
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,416
Mom and Dad's fights
separated us.

649
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,375
We learnt what a family
is after coming here.

650
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,583
I wish Mom and Dad too
were here with us.

651
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,000
Aunt, would you like some sugar?

652
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:57,791
Come on, girls.
Drink your milk and go to sleep.

653
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,458
We will go to the market
in the morning...

654
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,708
where you can buy
Indian dresses.

655
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,958
Aunt,
I don't wear Indian dresses.

656
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:06,041
It's okay, dear. You can buy
anklets instead. Go to sleep, girls.

657
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:07,416
Come, kid. Your mother is looking for you.

658
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,333
No.

659
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:10,625
Come with me. Drink the milk
before it gets cold.

660
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,583
-Come on, Grandma.
-Shut up. Come with me.

661
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,291
Brother,
show us some bright colors.

662
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,000
Show us pure silk dresses.

663
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,208
Here's one in orange.

664
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,958
It's very good.

665
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,666
Karmo, we need to buy knickers
for your father too.

666
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,000
-They have gone tight.
-Okay.

667
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,083
Here's another one.

668
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:43,875
Oh, no. Embellishments on knickers
will cause rash.

669
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,291
This is an Indian dress.

670
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,833
Then show us something good.

671
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,208
Hey, why don't you order
some cold drinks?

672
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,291
-These girls have come from abroad.
-This one...

673
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:54,375
-Get four and a half cold drinks!
-Half for whom?

674
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,541
-For me.
-Damn you.

675
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,666
Show me an embroidered veil.

676
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,291
Big flowers or small flowers?

677
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,166
Anything would do.

678
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,500
It should just look good on her.

679
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,000
-Show me that one, the one in blue.
-The one at the end?

680
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,750
She will tear it apart.

681
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,000
The one on this end.

682
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,916
It's an excellent piece.

683
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,750
She is your sister-in-law.

684
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:22,375
I am talking about the veil,
brother.

685
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:32,291
-Today, you will meet your end!
-Stop it!

686
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,375
-I won't spare you!
-Now look at them!

687
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:38,041
-There they are!
-Give it to me!

688
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:41,833
-I want the chocolates!
-They brought chocolates for us!

689
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,333
You want all of it!

690
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:44,833
-You witch!
-Yes, sister?

691
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,458
Here, I have brought anklets.

692
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,583
And I also brought a
few Indian dresses.

693
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,416
The one with flowers on them.

694
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:57,125
-They are so beautiful.
-Aunt brought them.

695
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,458
We will wear the dresses
with flowers on them.

696
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:01,916
I dare anyone to do
anything they want.

697
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:04,291
-I'll get them stitched tomorrow itself.
-Yes.

698
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,333
-They are beautiful, aren't they?
-Yes, they are.

699
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,416
-What is this?
-Mother.

700
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,750
What have you been up to?

701
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,166
Mother, aunt from the city
got it stitched for me.

702
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,375
You want to be fashionable!
You want to wear flowery dresses!

703
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,833
I'll kill you if you wear
this dress again.

704
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,416
She wants to dress
like actresses!

705
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:14,500
Dear, brother Labhu wanted
to talk to you.

706
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,208
-Yes.
-Yes.

707
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:23,666
Dear,
I have been wondering whether...

708
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,333
or not to discuss
this with you.

709
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,291
You know how we are
a big happy family.

710
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,625
We like to live together peacefully.

711
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:31,166
We don't fight over
land like others.

712
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:35,375
But who knows about the future.
Look, Mother has aged.

713
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:38,375
-I'm not well.
-We sat together and decided that...

714
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,208
we should all take
our shares now.

715
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,250
We don't want our kids to
fight in the future.

716
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:45,291
And then dear, all of you are
well settled in Canada.

717
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,958
-Right?
-As for us, we are bound to suffer here.

718
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:49,958
Yes.

719
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:55,458
So I thought that as you
are already here...

720
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,625
why don't we all take our
shares and end this matter?

721
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:02,416
Dear, as you know this is what
has been happening since ages...

722
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:05,125
the land always belonged
to the sons.

723
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,416
-Right?
-We had invited sister.

724
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,583
-But she sent you two.
-Yes.

725
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,250
Let us know what you want to do.

726
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:16,416
Okay.

727
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,375
We have made their will.

728
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,666
If sister manages to come
then it will be great.

729
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,041
We have everything ready.

730
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,625
Okay?

731
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,083
What's this?

732
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,125
-What are you doing here?
-Father, what are you doing here?

733
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,833
I have come here to take a form
to open an ostrich farm.

734
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,333
What are you doing here?

735
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,541
I am here with some
Canadian passengers.

736
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:08,750
They have rented uncle's car.

737
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:10,125
If they have rented
the car then your job...

738
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,833
-is to only drive them around.
-Why are you carrying their bags?

739
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:16,416
Father, don't you always say
that we should help others.

740
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,500
-Wonderful. My son is very smart.
-Then do one thing...

741
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,458
carry this sack and help me
load it on the mini bus.

742
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:26,291
Father, you are still
stuck on a mini bus?

743
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:29,125
Here I am making plans
to take a flight.

744
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Very good.

745
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,000
I wonder what will happen
to this new generation.

746
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,750
I like a fool have come here to
take a form for ostriches.

747
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,000
No one would give them forms
even for poultry.

748
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,125
Maggar, my father too is
here, in the court.

749
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,666
We should get your sister-in-law to
touch his feet, right?

750
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,833
I think you too love dogs.

751
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,125
No, I don't like them.
I am scared of them.

752
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:56,583
You need to take 12 shots
if a dog bites you.

753
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,416
People keep pampering them
for no reason. Idiots.

754
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,750
Stupid. Do you know how
kindhearted dogs are?

755
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,583
They are so loyal.

756
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,750
They love more than humans.

757
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,000
I will surely get into trouble
because of you.

758
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:34,458
<span style="style.default_1">-How are you, Nicole?</span>
-Mom, you know what happened today?

759
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:37,541
It's me, Kash.

760
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,500
Yes, Kashmir.
Are you liking it out there?

761
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,833
Like it?
I don't wish to come back.

762
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:43,791
Why?

763
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,291
Couldn't you tell us sooner that
your family is so nice?

764
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,500
You know we went for
shopping today.

765
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,916
Aunt forced me to
buy anklets too.

766
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:53,958
I bought so many Indian dresses.

767
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,083
The ones with flower
embroideries on it.

768
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:01,375
Okay, everyone is staring at me.
We'll call you later.

769
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,541
We won't tell Mom what
happened here.

770
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,458
Her family thought about
her after so many years.

771
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,125
Why should we spoil her mood?

772
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,958
They couldn't talk about
it directly with Mom.

773
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,000
What do we have to do
with their property?

774
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:30,708
Looks like our parents
are very good.

775
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,666
Whatever it is, they
do it in front of us.

776
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,375
At least, they aren't
double-faced.

777
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:38,666
I think they are the ones
troubling Grandma.

778
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:43,000
She is so upfront. If she is
angry then she is angry.

779
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,708
Here you go, Amrik. Set them up.

780
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:25,833
Here, Neeta.

781
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,458
-Take it.
-No, sister.

782
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,375
Take it.

783
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,958
Tell your friend that your sister
bought you an iPhone.

784
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,708
-No...
-Here.

785
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,541
Look at this.

786
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:46,708
Do it.

787
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:53,958
-Okay?
-Yes.

788
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,041
-You won't feel scared now, will you?
-No, I won't.

789
00:52:57,833 --> 00:53:01,833
Will you take me to Canada
after I grow up?

790
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:03,375
Okay.

791
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,541
Take this, girl. Here's yours.

792
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:24,125
I didn't have change.

793
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,833
You have to pretend
before the world.

794
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:28,625
I don't know whether
or not we will...

795
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,125
get to see each other again.

796
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,375
It will be between you
and your uncles.

797
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:35,666
You are always welcomed here.
How does it concern me?

798
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,708
Take this.

799
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,958
Tell your mother to wear this
flower-embroidered dress.

800
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,875
I was anyway going to use
it to mop the floor.

801
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:12,208
<span style="style.default_1">Strange are the hues of life,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O' Mother...</span>

802
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:15,833
<span style="style.default_1">It feels like the heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Is being pulled apart</span>

803
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:19,458
<span style="style.default_1">As we part ways, O' Mother</span>

804
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,083
<span style="style.default_1">Moonlight is no different than me</span>

805
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:27,250
<span style="style.default_1">Even the nights don't belong to me,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O' Mother</span>

806
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:37,541
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

807
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:45,708
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

808
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:06,083
<span style="style.default_1">Mother, tell me, why is affection</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Such a bad thing?</span>

809
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:13,083
<span style="style.default_1">Why do we love anyone,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Why does the heart ache?</span>

810
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:20,041
<span style="style.default_1">Get me something to sooth my soul,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O' Mother</span>

811
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,125
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

812
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:35,291
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

813
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,458
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how, O' Mother</span>

814
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:12,166
<span style="style.default_1">Mother, I have...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">A strange illness</span>

815
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:16,166
<span style="style.default_1">I don't know when did I get it</span>

816
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:22,916
<span style="style.default_1">Why does my heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Want to jump out of my chest?</span>

817
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,666
<span style="style.default_1">After being invited...</span>

818
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,375
<span style="style.default_1">The door was closed at my face,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O' Mother</span>

819
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:32,208
Grandma sent a dress for Mom.

820
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,791
Mom didn't send anything
for Grandma.

821
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:42,958
Stupid, Mom sent us for her.

822
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,958
-Amrik?
-Yes?

823
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,041
Turn the car around.

824
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,375
Okay.

825
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:59,958
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

826
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:07,041
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

827
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:11,208
I was wondering, you haven't
even toured Punjab as yet.

828
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:13,041
How can you just leave!

829
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,791
I know it is my love that
made you stay back.

830
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:20,875
Look, you shouldn't
be rude to the driver.

831
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:24,125
They sometimes drive straight
into a river when angry.

832
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,708
-But you don't need to worry.
-I am not a driver.

833
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,125
I am the owner.

834
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:31,791
We have many cars on the road.

835
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,250
It's not our fault.

836
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,000
I don't talk to Manjeeti.

837
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,750
Come with us, Grandma.

838
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,666
It will be a lot of fun.

839
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,708
-You will be happy.
-I am happy.

840
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,416
Liar! Your eyes are still red.

841
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:25,083
Hello, uncle.

842
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,125
What's wrong?
Did Grandma pass away?

843
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,000
Shut up.

844
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,291
Uncle!

845
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,291
Give me the sprayer.
I need to spray the fields.

846
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:37,375
Does our sprayer kill
more insects?

847
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:39,125
You can take it today,
but never ask for it again.

848
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,625
Otherwise, I will throw you out.

849
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,000
Reshma, give him the sprayer.

850
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:47,833
She is just pretending to be
angry. She will come with us.

851
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,416
-Come on, let's go.
-Come on.

852
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,375
-Let's go, let's go.
-Come on.

853
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,000
-Come on.
-Take her bag.

854
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:55,083
Why are you dragging me along?

855
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:58,791
Here you go.

856
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:13,958
Don't worry, uncle.

857
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,750
We will be back in five to seven days.

858
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:18,041
It will be a good change
for Grandma as well.

859
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:21,500
It's okay, dear. You are very
smart to convince her.

860
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,541
-God bless you.
-Bye, aunt.

861
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,625
You are leaving?

862
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,875
Here's the sprayer.

863
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,375
Sprayer for what?

864
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,625
To hell with such a sprayer.

865
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,416
These sprays have
destroyed Punjab.

866
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:44,791
You should eat these
poisonous grains.

867
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,791
I will do organic farming now.

868
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:48,958
Bye, uncle.

869
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,166
I will get going now.

870
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:51,791
Bye, aunt.

871
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,625
Grandma,
you don't need to worry at all.

872
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:04,166
We will enjoy life to the fullest
in the next five days.

873
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:09,250
Your decision to take Grandma
on a tour has won my heart.

874
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:10,708
Is your heart a world cup...

875
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:13,583
-that winning it is an achievement.
-Shut up and drive.

876
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:15,083
"Won my heart..."

877
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,000
Oh no, what is this room?

878
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,875
Grandma, this is an elevator.

879
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:35,708
-It will lift you up very quickly.
-Let her lift your grandmother.

880
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:37,125
I don't want to die so soon.

881
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,458
-Come on.
-Let's go, Grandma.

882
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,750
-I don't want to enter it.
-Nothing will happen.

883
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:43,000
-Let's go.
-I don't want to enter it.

884
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:46,291
-I will feel suffocated.
-Nothing will happen. Let's go.

885
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,375
My sons have locked me in a room.

886
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,041
And you are locking
me up in here.

887
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:52,500
Grandma,
it will take us up quickly.

888
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,833
Nothing happened. You are fine.

889
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:56,416
Nothing happened.

890
01:00:57,208 --> 01:01:00,083
These idiots have blankets
on the floor.

891
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,791
That's a carpet.
It's called a carpet.

892
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:05,250
Tell me about it.

893
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,416
It's over here as well.

894
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,958
It's everywhere, Grandma.

895
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,583
Welcome home, Grandma.

896
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:17,666
Come in.

897
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,791
Such a big room!

898
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,583
Grandma,
come here, look at the view.

899
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,208
No, I will fall down.

900
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:41,958
-There's a glass window here.
-Did you like the room?

901
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,541
I have never even dreamed of such
a beautiful place, dear.

902
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,333
Grandma, look over there,
that's the bathtub.

903
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:52,708
Oh God, such a beautiful bathtub!

904
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,791
In villages, many houses don't
even have such beautiful halls.

905
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,125
Right.

906
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,166
It is actually a place where
one can bathe, dear?

907
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,291
Yes, and you too will bathe here.

908
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:32,416
Get in, Grandma.
You will have a lot of fun.

909
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,750
No, I won't get in there.

910
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,125
Grandma, you will get a massage.
Come on, get in.

911
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:37,833
I will drown, dear.

912
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:39,791
-Get in, Grandma.
-No.

913
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:41,166
No, dear. I won't get in.

914
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,458
Come on, Grandma.

915
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,291
Oh, come on, Grandma.
You will be relaxed. Come on.

916
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,208
Let your mother relax!

917
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:50,041
-They want me to relax.
-Stop, Grandma!

918
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:51,750
-I'm going home.
-Come on, come on.

919
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,500
No, let me go.

920
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:56,708
Eat it, Grandma.

921
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:58,750
I don't want it.

922
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,500
Eat it.

923
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:02,833
You won't find any
<span style="style.default_1">churi</span> in the night.

924
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:06,250
And what you are holding
in your hand is a soap.

925
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:07,666
Don't eat it.

926
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,083
I want to go back home.

927
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:13,208
Come on.

928
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,541
Go.

929
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,250
Where's Grandma?

930
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,083
Come on!

931
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:51,708
Where should I go?

932
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:54,458
Oh no.

933
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:58,458
Oh, God. I am lost.

934
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,458
Where should I go?

935
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,083
Where to?

936
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,458
-Come with me, Grandma.
-I won't.

937
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:12,125
Sorry, we won't trouble
you anymore. Okay?

938
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:15,541
-I won't sleep with that witch.
-Fine, you can sleep with me.

939
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:16,750
Let's go back.

940
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,916
How did you like it today?

941
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,291
You loved it, right?

942
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:27,916
Grandma, hit her with your stick.

943
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,500
Grandma, you didn't go back home?

944
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,791
How does it concern you!

945
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,833
Let's click a picture together.

946
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,416
Let her talk.

947
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,791
I'll join in.

948
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:52,750
Good night, Grandma.

949
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:04,250
Maggar, they went upstairs
and left us here.

950
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:05,916
Is this fair?

951
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,000
It's okay.

952
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,583
If we want to go to
Canada then...

953
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:12,458
we'll have to make this sacrifice.

954
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:15,791
How are you, brother?

955
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,375
What's wrong?
You're talking to a plastic dog.

956
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,875
Come with me,
I'll treat you with egg curry.

957
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:23,166
No, thanks.

958
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,916
I know how our life is.
We don't ever get a stable house.

959
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:29,291
I am still lucky,
I salute ten cars every day.

960
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:31,875
Guys like you spend all
your life on this seat.

961
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:33,750
No, brother. I am not a driver.

962
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:35,041
I am going to marry someone
from Canada.

963
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,083
My wife, my sister-in-law and my
grandma-in-law are upstairs.

964
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:41,125
I came down here because I don't
want to be with the ladies.

965
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,458
You should work properly,
brother.

966
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,416
Otherwise, the hotel management
will fire you.

967
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:46,625
Right?

968
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:49,291
I think he is into drugs.

969
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:53,625
He says he
wants to go to Canada.

970
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,708
We don't even get
to eat them and...

971
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,583
he is placing them on my eyes.

972
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:07,541
-That will be too much.
-Black will do.

973
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:09,750
What are you doing to my hair?

974
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:13,000
It's nothing, Grandma. He's just
getting rid of your dandruff.

975
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,041
What's that, girl?

976
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:18,083
Grandma, she meant scurf.

977
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:19,166
Okay.

978
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,833
It has been a week since I bathed
in buttermilk at home.

979
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:27,250
Ma'am, should I do threading
for her? It will look good.

980
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:31,583
Wax her.

981
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,916
Oh damn! Where's my stick?

982
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,833
-Give me my stick.
-I... here you go, ma'am.

983
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:42,375
Wait, I'll teach you a lesson.

984
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,291
Grandma...

985
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:48,166
Grandma, listen to me.

986
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,625
Don't hit him.
What are you doing, Grandma?

987
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:52,625
-Grandma, listen...
-Fine, stop it now.

988
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,083
Damn you... you have brought me to
a house full of mirrors.

989
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,000
I have never even looked
at the mirror at home.

990
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,500
-Fine, sit down.
-They keep calling me "Grandma."

991
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,791
Nothing will happen, Grandma.

992
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,291
-Come on, sit down.
-Sit down, sit down.

993
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,833
-Give me my stick.
-Yes, give her the stick.

994
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,291
Oh, God.

995
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,708
-Enough... calm down.
-Nothing has happened.

996
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,500
-Here I am folding my hands before you.
-Go back.

997
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:11,708
Leave my house.

998
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:13,291
-Look over there, look at your hair.
-Look, Grandma...

999
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:15,833
-What have you done to me! My arm hurts!
-Grandma!

1000
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,041
Look over there!
You look so beautiful.

1001
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:19,500
-Your hair looks great.
-Yes.

1002
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:21,083
-Look at them.
-Aren't they beautiful?

1003
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,291
-Oh no!
-You look so beautiful.

1004
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,500
Damn, you two!

1005
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,083
Your mother had turned my face
black with disgrace...

1006
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:30,125
And you two have blacked my hair.

1007
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,791
Go away from here.

1008
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:35,250
-How will I face anyone?
-You are looking so beautiful.

1009
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:41,041
You are back! I won't spare him.

1010
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:49,208
That hurts.

1011
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:53,291
Maggar, do you want a
collar or something?

1012
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:54,458
Let's go shopping.

1013
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:55,583
Who is Maggar?

1014
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,750
My dog's name is Maggar.

1015
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,250
My husband's name is Maggar.

1016
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,041
And you are addressing
him as Maggar?

1017
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,708
It's okay, Grandma.
We will change his name.

1018
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:07,208
We will call him Johnson
from now.

1019
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:13,541
Johnson is our Dad's name.

1020
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:15,916
What does he think of himself!
Johnson!

1021
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,708
Do you know how softhearted
dogs are?

1022
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:27,375
They are so innocent.

1023
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:29,166
You cannot even imagine.

1024
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:30,916
They love more than humans do.

1025
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,416
They are so loyal.

1026
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,750
Maggar, you will
help me get the girl.

1027
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:43,041
Where are you two dragging me to?

1028
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:46,083
-Let's go.
-Oh no, this is the first time... I..

1029
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:48,125
am seeing these movable stairs.

1030
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,291
-Let's go, Grandma.
-No, no, no. I am scared.

1031
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:53,125
Nothing will happen, Grandma.
I'll get on it first.

1032
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,208
Give me your hand.

1033
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,208
-Come on.
-Come on, Grandma.

1034
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:59,083
Hey girl, he is going upstairs.

1035
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,041
Fine then, see you upstairs.

1036
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,583
No, you said you will make
me have a good time.

1037
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:05,833
Have you brought me along
to sightsee or scare me?

1038
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:06,958
Bloody wretches.

1039
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:08,750
-Nothing will happen, Grandma. Be brave.
-I get on it.

1040
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,500
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

1041
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:16,458
Lift me up, dear.

1042
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:19,291
-I will.
-You let it be. God will lift you up.

1043
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:25,875
Girls,
I don't want to have a good time.

1044
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,750
They want me to enjoy life.

1045
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:30,791
Fine, those stairs will take
you down. Go, get down.

1046
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,750
Go on.

1047
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,291
Go.

1048
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,833
Come on, Grandma, let's go.

1049
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,333
Evil.

1050
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,958
Give it to me, I'll carry it.

1051
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,958
Don't show us your teeth.

1052
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:43,958
Take this and keep all
the bags in the car.

1053
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,416
Hold it.

1054
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,000
My sister-in-law doesn't let me
stay at one place for long.

1055
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:50,416
This one is good.

1056
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:53,125
-Isn't it too bright?
-No, it's nice.

1057
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,208
Nice? It's very good.

1058
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:03,250
Maggar... sorry... Johnson...

1059
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:06,666
No more shaking your head now.

1060
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:09,375
You should start getting ready
to ride in a plane.

1061
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,041
They were two crazy
girls earlier.

1062
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,041
Now the third one
has joined them.

1063
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:31,125
I hope they don't spoil
the old woman.

1064
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,125
Right?

1065
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:44,583
Girl,
he looks like a Kabaddi player.

1066
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:46,875
What is this?

1067
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,708
My husband died a long time ago.

1068
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:51,250
-Why are you making me wear bangles?
-It is necessary, Grandma.

1069
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,166
-They won't let us go inside without it.
-One more.

1070
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,333
What's inside, girl?

1071
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,250
Don't make me slap you.

1072
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,125
Will you have it as well?

1073
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,791
No, Grandma. I don't drink.

1074
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,750
Back then, old men used to
get drunk and hurt us.

1075
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:25,541
I think the girls get
drunk and hurt men.

1076
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,750
How times have changed!

1077
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:30,041
-At least, try it, Grandma.
-Shut up.

1078
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:31,583
<span style="style.default_1">Try it!</span>

1079
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:45,125
<span style="style.default_1">Palazzo suits you...</span>

1080
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,958
<span style="style.default_1">You have an attitude to boost about too</span>

1081
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,833
<span style="style.default_1">Girls ask you for beauty tips</span>

1082
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:56,291
<span style="style.default_1">Your eye liner has destroyed many enemies</span>

1083
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:59,291
<span style="style.default_1">Your heel refuses to hear any appeals</span>

1084
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,875
<span style="style.default_1">You move out of the house without makeup</span>

1085
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:04,708
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is the talk of the town</span>

1086
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:07,583
<span style="style.default_1">The world dances to your tune</span>

1087
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:10,416
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is the talk of the town</span>

1088
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,208

1089
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:27,000
<span style="style.default_1">Your name is now a part of my life."</span>

1090
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:29,791
<span style="style.default_1">You are now a part of my pride</span>

1091
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,750
<span style="style.default_1">When you leave the house at midnight</span>

1092
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,458
<span style="style.default_1">You shine like a diamond in a Ferrari</span>

1093
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:38,166
<span style="style.default_1">Your name is now a part of my life</span>

1094
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:41,000

1095
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,125
<span style="style.default_1">When you leave the house at midnight</span>

1096
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:46,541
<span style="style.default_1">You shine like a diamond in a Ferrari</span>

1097
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:49,708
<span style="style.default_1">You wear top-class tops</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You don't step out of the car</span>

1098
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:52,083
<span style="style.default_1">Every eye wishes to spot you</span>

1099
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:55,041
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is the talk of the town</span>

1100
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,833
<span style="style.default_1">The world dances to your tune</span>

1101
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:00,625
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is the talk of the town</span>

1102
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:03,666
<span style="style.default_1">The world dances to your tune</span>

1103
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,125
<span style="style.default_1">To cheat there is no scope</span>

1104
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,083
<span style="style.default_1">On you the boy has some hope</span>

1105
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,000

01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,541
<span style="style.default_1">From Vancouver is your dope!</span>

1107
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,375

1108
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:31,291
<span style="style.default_1">On you the boy has some hope</span>

1109
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:34,125
<span style="style.default_1">The whole of Chandigarh</span>

1110
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,916
<span style="style.default_1">From Vancouver is your dope</span>

1111
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,750
<span style="style.default_1">Your look, it's design,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart has resigned</span>

1112
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:42,500
<span style="style.default_1">Your eyes deceive plenty</span>

1113
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,250
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is the</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Talk of the town</span>

1114
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:48,083
<span style="style.default_1">The world dances to your tune</span>

1115
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:50,791
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is the talk of the town</span>

1116
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:53,500
<span style="style.default_1">The world dances to your tune</span>

1117
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:56,458
Move! They call this fun!

1118
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:59,583
"The world dances to your tune."

1119
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,708
Grandma, how about a dance?

1120
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:03,916
They can dance only after
getting drunk.

1121
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,416
Then you show us how to dance
without getting drunk.

1122
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,458
Kash don't be rude. It's okay.

1123
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,833
No, it's not okay.

1124
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:14,166
Only the one who knows how
to dance can dance.

1125
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:15,458
Stop it.

1126
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:18,625
Grandma, I am with you on this.

1127
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:22,500
We will have to show it to them.

1128
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,083
<span style="style.default_1">Look at what your mother has done</span>

1129
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:29,833
<span style="style.default_1">She left your father</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And went after your uncle</span>

1130
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,958
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my sharp...</span>

1131
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:34,000
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my sharp pestle</span>

1132
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:36,416
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my wild pestle</span>

1133
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:41,083
<span style="style.default_1">This pestle expresses my feelings</span>

1134
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">Dream on</span>

1135
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:49,083
Your Manjeeti used to say...

1136
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:51,416
Kashmir you have gone
after your Grandma.

1137
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,625
Low on beauty but
high on attitude.

1138
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,125
So I finally made you dance,
Grandma.

1139
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:07,250
<span style="style.default_1">Your father's sister is crazy</span>

1140
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:09,750
<span style="style.default_1">She is tending to a donkey in the morning</span>

1141
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:11,958
<span style="style.default_1">Your mother's milking the cattle</span>

1142
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:14,250
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my sharp...</span>

1143
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,375
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my sharp pestle</span>

1144
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:18,750
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my wild pestle</span>

1145
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:23,458
<span style="style.default_1">This pestle expresses, my feelings</span>

1146
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:24,541
<span style="style.default_1">Dream on</span>

1147
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:33,250
Maggar, reason it with me.

1148
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:35,083
Plead to me.

1149
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:36,875
Do you want to go to Canada
or get your bones broken?

1150
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,500
I am sure he is taking drugs.

1151
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:45,916
-Yes?
-Brother, why are you doing this?

1152
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,833
Why?

1153
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:49,208
Tell me the truth,
what are those pills?

1154
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,208
Life is short, you can get
rid of this addiction.

1155
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:55,166
-No, brother.
-I have popped many pills as well.

1156
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:57,666
I have been high quite
often on cannabis.

1157
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:59,583
But I have never managed
to reach Canada.

1158
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:02,250
It's not Canada, it's death.

1159
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:05,458
Life is short,
follow the right path.

1160
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:07,208
Follow the right path.

1161
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:10,083
Who wants words of wisdom
from the wise?

1162
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,333
The drugs you are taking will one
day make you sell your car.

1163
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,291
What's wrong, Grandma?

1164
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,583
My sister's granddaughter
is getting married.

1165
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,458
You want to attend it?

1166
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,333
What will I do there?

1167
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:42,083
That means you want to go there.

1168
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:44,291
Kash...

1169
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:46,166
-Shall we?
-What will I do there?

1170
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,666
God!

1171
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,166
-Grandma...
-Let me sleep.

1172
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:05,625
Where are you, knucklehead?

1173
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:07,750
Don't curse, uncle.

1174
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,666
-Grandma, want some?
-You are...

1175
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,125
what you are.

1176
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:14,625
Scoundrel, I am worried about you.
Where are you?

1177
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:17,166
Uncle,
our vehicle is on the road.

1178
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,000
I am making money here.
Don't worry.

1179
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:23,125
I worry because you don't
have a permit.

1180
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:26,250
Speak up now, will you?

1181
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,458
I'll talk to you later.

1182
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,500
He disconnected it, again.

1183
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,291
Give me a biscuit.

1184
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:37,291
There is a police
check post ahead.

1185
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:39,000
And I don't have a permit.

1186
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,500
-If they ask, tell them this is your car.
-Okay.

1187
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:46,500
License and registration, please.

1188
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:48,833
-Show us all the documents.
-Go on.

1189
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,666
I have all the documents.

1190
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,583
Here's my license.

1191
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,083
And here's the insurance.

1192
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:58,416
I have a pollution under
control certificate too.

1193
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,791
-Who are they, your passengers?
-No, my family.

1194
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,583
He is my grandson and
they are his sisters.

1195
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,500
We're going for a wedding.

1196
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:14,000
-Reshma, let them pass.
-What?

1197
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:33,833
Sisters?

1198
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:35,708
What's wrong with him, girls?

1199
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,000
Why is he coming back?

1200
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:44,958
They aren't my sisters.

1201
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:46,041
Then who are they?

1202
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,875
One is my wife and the
other is her sister.

1203
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,875
But they are your family.

1204
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:53,791
-Yes.
-It's okay, give me a ticket.

1205
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,375
Shinda, give him a ticket.

1206
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,125
Where did that pigeon go?

1207
01:19:58,333 --> 01:19:59,833
I don't know what he is up to.

1208
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,958
I think he is crazy.

1209
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,500
Thank you.

1210
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:21,416
Here's the ticket.

1211
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,416
<span style="style.default_1">There are other</span>
<span style="style.default_1">relationships in the world...</span>

1212
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,916
<span style="style.default_1">than that of a brother</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and sister.</span>

1213
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,916
<span style="style.default_1">The girls are ready</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to get married...</span>

1214
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:29,958
<span style="style.default_1">and the Grandma wants</span>
<span style="style.default_1">us to be siblings.</span>

1215
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:55,208
Want one?

1216
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:56,916
Then feed me.

1217
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:58,208
My hands aren't free.

1218
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:15,916
Oh, damn!

1219
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,250
Sister is here!

1220
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,958
I seek your blessings.

1221
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:26,416
Hello, sister.

1222
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,333
God bless you, brother.

1223
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:31,125
My sister, the cop is here.

1224
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,250
I am so happy!

1225
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,541
Hello, Mother.

1226
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,375
What are you doing here,
shameless ones!

1227
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,083
-We are here since yesterday.
-These fritters are delicious.

1228
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:40,791
-Let's eat them.
-Amazing.

1229
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:45,416
Black hair,
glowing face, dark glasses...

1230
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,875
Our sister is getting
younger by the day.

1231
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:49,666
I hope she doesn't cause
much trouble.

1232
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,333
I'll have to give dowry again.

1233
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:53,916
Dowry? As if you gave me the
Taj Mahal as dowry earlier.

1234
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:56,416
These girls are behind
this change.

1235
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,416
-Say hello, girls.
-Hello.

1236
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,000
-He is my brother, Janta.
-God bless you.

1237
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,458
And she is my sister, Golo.

1238
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,583
-Sister, these girls?
-Manjeeti's daughters.

1239
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,250
Oh, wonderful!

1240
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:07,958
These girls are all grown up!

1241
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:10,041
-I seek your blessings, aunt.
-God bless you, son.

1242
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,500
We feel blessed with
your presence.

1243
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,041
This wedding celebration
just became more alive.

1244
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,458
Mother won't just stop talking.

1245
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:18,750
How about letting her have
some water, at least.

1246
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:21,041
-Let's go, aunt.
-Let's go, son.

1247
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:24,125
Boys, serve tea.

1248
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,541
And some sweets too.

1249
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,416
He didn't offer a single
sweet to me.

1250
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:28,666
Look at his antics.

1251
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,041
God bless you for
taking care of...

1252
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:36,416
my sister more than your life.

1253
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:38,750
Let's go, girls.

1254
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,041
Let's go, dear.

1255
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:42,625
Wonderful.

1256
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,375
This is a strange tradition here.

1257
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:48,375
You don't respect your elders
but everyone else.

1258
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:54,250
-Let's go and watch the drama.
-<span style="style.default_1">Mother, turmeric paste is ready</span>

1259
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:57,875
<span style="style.default_1">Apply the paste</span>

1260
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:03,458
<span style="style.default_1">Mother, turmeric paste is ready</span>

1261
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:06,750
<span style="style.default_1">Apply the paste</span>

1262
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:12,625
<span style="style.default_1">Mother, turmeric paste is ready</span>

1263
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:15,791
<span style="style.default_1">Apply the paste</span>

1264
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,458
Come on girls, sit down.

1265
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:21,083
It's not our wedding, grandma.

1266
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:22,833
The way you behave, it will
be difficult to marry you.

1267
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,500
Make them sit down. Sit down.

1268
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,583
-Let it be, Grandma.
-Come here, dear.

1269
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:26,958
-Get them here.
-Sit down.

1270
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:28,416
-Sit down.
-My face.

1271
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,625
-I might be allergic to it.
-Sit down.

1272
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,416
-No, nothing will happen.
-Take this.

1273
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,083
-Grandma, why don't you understand?
-Apply it, girls.

1274
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:36,708
-Grandma...
-Apply it.

1275
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:41,000
-Nothing will happen.
-Apply it.

1276
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:42,708
-What is this, grandma?
-No!

1277
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,416
Dear, this is the
rustic way of waxing.

1278
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,250
It needs to be done only
once in six months.

1279
01:23:49,416 --> 01:23:51,041
-Here you go.
-That's enough.

1280
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,541
Enough, already.

1281
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:58,833
I had told you not to force
Grandma for waxing.

1282
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:00,791
She is taking revenge from us.

1283
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:04,000
Girls,
you look as fair as milk now.

1284
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:05,291
Karma,
make them stand in front for...

1285
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:08,291
-the ribbon cutting ceremony.
-They will only give you 2,100 rupees.

1286
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:10,333
Whereas, they will give way
only after given 5,100 rupees.

1287
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:13,833
My brother-in-law had only
given two rupees.

1288
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,625
Bloody miser.

1289
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:18,291
As if your husband gave
me a treasure.

1290
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:19,958
Listen to her complain.

1291
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:25,083
Girls, you should take the center
stage only when required.

1292
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:26,541
I don't want you to
take the center stage...

1293
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:29,416
-throughout the wedding.
-Like an eager goat.

1294
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,000
Karmo,
go and get the Indian dresses.

1295
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:33,583
They will wear the
ones they like.

1296
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:35,083
I won't wear an Indian dress.

1297
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:37,916
Yes, of course. Why would you
wear an Indian dress?

1298
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,333
You weren't born to be obedient.

1299
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:42,000
"I won't wear an Indian dress."

1300
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:43,333
What does she do?

1301
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:45,458
-Have a look.
-Pick out of these.

1302
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:46,833
Take your pick.

1303
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,583
Here are some more.
Check them out.

1304
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,875
Trouble, you too check them out.

1305
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,125
Here.

1306
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:53,500
Here you go.

1307
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:55,833
She won't wear an Indian dress,
Mother.

1308
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:04,166
<span style="style.default_1">One, two, three... go for it</span>

1309
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:15,083
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is like wildfire</span>

1310
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:17,750
<span style="style.default_1">It sets the heart on fire</span>

1311
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:20,541
<span style="style.default_1">The one who ruined many in her youth</span>

1312
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:23,625
<span style="style.default_1">Baba, recite us a tale of Heer</span>

1313
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:28,916
<span style="style.default_1">Your beauty is like wildfire</span>

1314
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,708
<span style="style.default_1">It sets the heart on fire</span>

1315
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,500
<span style="style.default_1">The one who ruined many in her youth</span>

1316
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,958
<span style="style.default_1">Baba, recite us a tale of Heer</span>

1317
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:39,875
<span style="style.default_1">Your pink lips speak to me</span>

1318
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">You clap so delicately</span>

1319
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:48,125
<span style="style.default_1">She dances to music,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He sings melodious songs</span>

1320
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:53,958
<span style="style.default_1">Her eyes are intoxicating,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like top class liquor</span>

1321
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:59,666
<span style="style.default_1">She dances to music,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He sings melodious songs</span>

1322
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,250
<span style="style.default_1">From the time she has grown up</span>

1323
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:16,000
<span style="style.default_1">Her demands have risen</span>

1324
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:18,666
<span style="style.default_1">Her attitude is something to be aware of</span>

1325
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,625
<span style="style.default_1">She wears embellished sandals</span>

1326
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,416
<span style="style.default_1">From the time she has grown up</span>

1327
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,083
<span style="style.default_1">Her demands have risen</span>

1328
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:29,833
<span style="style.default_1">Her attitude is something to be aware of</span>

1329
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:32,750
<span style="style.default_1">She wears embellished sandals</span>

1330
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:35,625
<span style="style.default_1">She has ruined many like you</span>

1331
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:38,166
<span style="style.default_1">She looks good in Indian wear</span>

1332
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:43,541
<span style="style.default_1">If I don't hit the dance floor,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Who's gonna rock it?</span>

1333
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:49,375
<span style="style.default_1">If I don't hit the dance floor,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Who's gonna rock it?</span>

1334
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:55,333
<span style="style.default_1">If I don't hit the dance floor,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Who's gonna rock it?</span>

1335
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:11,833
<span style="style.default_1">Many hearts skip a beat,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When she moves with attitude</span>

1336
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:14,916
<span style="style.default_1">Someone will crush you like a twig</span>

1337
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,458
<span style="style.default_1">Such attitude is not good</span>

1338
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:23,041
<span style="style.default_1">Many hearts skip a beat,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When she moves with attitude</span>

1339
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:26,250
<span style="style.default_1">Someone will crush you like a twig</span>

1340
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:28,791
<span style="style.default_1">Such attitude is not good</span>

1341
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:34,208
<span style="style.default_1">Blowing with the wind</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Her fragrance mesmerizes everyone</span>

1342
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:39,708
<span style="style.default_1">She dances to music,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He sings melodious songs</span>

1343
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:45,500
<span style="style.default_1">If I don't hit the dance floor</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Who's gonna rock it?</span>

1344
01:27:45,791 --> 01:27:51,125
<span style="style.default_1">She dances to music,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He sings melodious songs</span>

1345
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:56,416
<span style="style.default_1">She dances to music,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He sings melodious songs</span>

1346
01:27:56,666 --> 01:28:01,583
<span style="style.default_1">If I don't hit the dance floor,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Who's gonna rock it?</span>

1347
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,958
There you go, Jagroopa proved
to be a good host.

1348
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,166
And we have taken care
of our responsibility.

1349
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,500
Mother, she has gone into
a good family. Right?

1350
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,083
Right. It is a good thing.

1351
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:22,000
Are you tired, dear?

1352
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:24,666
Look are your companions...

1353
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,166
they are sloshed and
lying on the bed.

1354
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,250
And look over there.

1355
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:36,916
Dear, you don't need to
drink to dance.

1356
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,791
You should have
the desire to dance.

1357
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:40,166
I got your point, Grandma.

1358
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,250
There you go.

1359
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:44,750
-Do you too drink, dear?
-No, I don't.

1360
01:28:44,916 --> 01:28:48,208
-Then join them.
-You too.

1361
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:07,416
<span style="style.default_1">You don't need to</span>
<span style="style.default_1">drink to dance.</span>

1362
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:10,041
<span style="style.default_1">You should have</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the desire to dance.</span>

1363
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:30,250
I will have to agree on
one thing, sister.

1364
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:33,875
You took a lot of blame for us
and got beaten up by Dad.

1365
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,458
Your desire to be an
artist turned me...

1366
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:38,416
black and blue a
number of times.

1367
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:42,000
I used to support you and Dad
used to say that I spoiled you.

1368
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:46,958
Janta, you remember, once you
had started singing.

1369
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,708
And I started playing the music.

1370
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,541
And then Dad started
beating us both up.

1371
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:58,500
Whatever it was sister, father
might have no liked singers...

1372
01:29:58,791 --> 01:30:00,875
but I will make sure my son
becomes a famous singer.

1373
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:01,833
Really?

1374
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:04,708
Do you remember you had
once brought me a harmonium?

1375
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:05,833
Yes, I do.

1376
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,500
These days, it's your nephew you plays it.

1377
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:08,416
Okay.

1378
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,083
-He both writes and sings well.
-If I could...

1379
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:14,250
I would've also brought you a
drum along with the harmonium.

1380
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:19,041
Janta, we have to agree, no one
enjoyed as much luxurious...

1381
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:21,833
as much as we did with
sister's support.

1382
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,250
You are right, sister.

1383
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:26,541
She isn't our elder sister,
she is our mother.

1384
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:33,791
I wanted a guitar,
but you never brought me one.

1385
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:54,375
Be careful.

1386
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,250
Listen...

1387
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,333
-Yes?
-Where were you last night?

1388
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,708
-In the shed.
-Why?

1389
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:05,916
-You should have slept with Janta.
-Come on. Uncle slept there too.

1390
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:07,208
Why?

1391
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,083
Sons-in-law got a room.

1392
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,833
Roop's in-laws got one room and
his sister-in-law got another.

1393
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,291
Here or there,
I just had to sleep.

1394
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,166
And this way, I didn't feel cold.

1395
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,541
Good that you came here, aunt.

1396
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:27,083
You will get to see a wedding.

1397
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:29,166
You didn't get to see your
own daughter's wedding.

1398
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:34,458
Is it tasty, son? Eat it.

1399
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:36,333
Aunt,
do you really need to say that?

1400
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,458
Come on, I just said a fact.
It's not a big thing.

1401
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:43,708
-But you...
-Who are you to say that?

1402
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,291
Go and sit in your car.

1403
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,333
Worthless driver!

1404
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:55,125
He isn't a driver.

1405
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:57,458
He is better than
relatives like you.

1406
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:00,416
He has a heart of gold.

1407
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:04,625
Here you go.
A small gift.

1408
01:32:04,708 --> 01:32:06,458
No, Grandma.
Let it be.

1409
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:07,583
-Take it, dear.
-Here.

1410
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:08,750
-Take it.
-You should.

1411
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:10,166
-Take it.
-Yes.

1412
01:32:10,708 --> 01:32:12,041
Be happy, dear.

1413
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,791
Lead a happy life.

1414
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:16,416
Thank you, sister.
You are always welcomed here.

1415
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,500
What's the hurry, Mother?
I won't let aunt leave.

1416
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:22,833
No, you look after your in-laws.

1417
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:24,208
They are guests.

1418
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:28,416
I don't matter. I have only fixed
flooring with your mother.

1419
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:32,166
Take this, give a gift to
the girl on my behalf.

1420
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:33,750
Let's go, everyone.

1421
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,458
Where will you go, sister?

1422
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:40,166
Your house, why?

1423
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:41,875
Don't you want to leave?

1424
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:45,125
They will treat you
as they treated you.

1425
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:01,000
Good that you came to meet me.

1426
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:04,125
Who knows when we might
hear about each other?

1427
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,833
We don't know whether or not they
will even send us a message?

1428
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,541
Stop it, you fool.

1429
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:29,791
Uncle, don't be so crude.

1430
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:32,708
Didn't we let you marry my aunt?
We trust you.

1431
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:34,666
And you don't even trust
me with your car.

1432
01:33:34,916 --> 01:33:37,041
When you knew that car
didn't have the permit...

1433
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:39,000
then did you have
to take that car?

1434
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:41,625
Then why didn't you buy
a permit for the car?

1435
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,833
-Why did you cut corners?
-I cannot lie like this.

1436
01:33:45,666 --> 01:33:47,541
We too have some duty
towards our country.

1437
01:33:47,958 --> 01:33:50,083
Says the freedom fighter.

1438
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,791
Get this straight.

1439
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:55,333
I'll turn you black and blue like the
fuel.

1440
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:58,375
Get the car back or
you've had it.

1441
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:00,583
Okay, I am coming.

1442
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:02,291
-I'll get it, okay.
-Okay.

1443
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:05,083
He disconnected my call again.

1444
01:34:06,166 --> 01:34:08,583
-What are you waiting for.
-Come on, girls.

1445
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,458
-You go first.
-No, I won't. You go first.

1446
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:12,083
And they were forcing me
to get on the elevator.

1447
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:15,041
-Come on, climb up.
-No, it cannot carry my weight.

1448
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,041
Don't fear it.

1449
01:34:17,291 --> 01:34:19,500
When you die,
this is what will carry you.

1450
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:23,041
Jatts can be only be found
at police stations and bars.

1451
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,708
-Wonderful.
-Does your son write such things?

1452
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:28,333
I will take the harmonium back.

1453
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:30,583
-You go first.
-Hold this.

1454
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,291
-Look at her, Kash.
-Be careful, sister.

1455
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:36,333
-Climb it slowly. Come on.
-Just stop this.

1456
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,500
Hold it still.

1457
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:39,625
Climb it,
what are you waiting for?

1458
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,291
I am coming.

1459
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,291
Follow me up, or do you want
me to get down again?

1460
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:45,166
-Come on, climb up.
-Let it be, sister.

1461
01:34:45,291 --> 01:34:47,625
No way, I say!
They acted brave before me.

1462
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:49,875
-Now will you two climb up or not?
-Keep it down.

1463
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:51,458
Come on, boy. Secure the ladder.

1464
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:52,666
-You...
-Go. Go.

1465
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:54,833
-Come on, nothing will happen.
-Come on.

1466
01:34:54,916 --> 01:34:56,541
-Come on, climb up.
-Very good.

1467
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:58,291
-Come on, hold it.
-And you made me take the elevator.

1468
01:34:58,375 --> 01:34:59,416
I didn't even cry,
why are you crying?

1469
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:02,041
-Here, hold my hand.
-Come on. Come on.

1470
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:04,708
-Very good, my child.
-Come on.

1471
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,791
Very good, step over there.

1472
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Very good.

1473
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:09,833
She climbed up.

1474
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,458
-You too climb it.
-Come on.

1475
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,291
-Come on.
-Come on!

1476
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:18,375
-The second one too got on it.
-Yes.

1477
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:20,000
-I'll handle it, Dad. Let it be.
-Come on.

1478
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,333
Come, my child.

1479
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:24,041
-Don't worry, nothing will happen.
-It's very easy.

1480
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,500
-Take our hand.
-Give the other hand too.

1481
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:29,791
-We won't let go of you now.
-Nothing will happen now.

1482
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:31,916
-Very good.
-Oh my God!

1483
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,125
-Don't look behind.
-Don't look behind.

1484
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,208
See, you did it.

1485
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:39,791
Oh my God, it's too high.

1486
01:35:47,416 --> 01:35:49,583
Isn't that a beautiful view, girl?

1487
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:52,833
Grandma,
if I had been born here...

1488
01:35:52,916 --> 01:35:55,500
I wouldn't have even
touched liquor.

1489
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,333
I would have lived
a healthy life.

1490
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:00,458
If you had been born here...

1491
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:02,958
by now you would've ruined
your kidneys by drinking.

1492
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:05,375
Don't take what he says to heart,
dear.

1493
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:08,041
No wedding is complete in
Punjab without a fight.

1494
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:09,208
Here's your medicine.

1495
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:10,666
Damn you to hell.

1496
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,500
-Don't you have any shame?
-Sister dearest...

1497
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,875
had she been my nephew,
wouldn't have I offered it to him?

1498
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,458
So, what if she is a girl?

1499
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:18,541
-Wonderful!
-Yes.

1500
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,750
My brother has such
noble thoughts!

1501
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,500
Show it to me, dear.

1502
01:36:24,916 --> 01:36:26,416
-My bottle!
-Here you go.

1503
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:30,333
He thinks he's doing good.

1504
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,833
Here I am trying to put them
on the right track...

1505
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:35,708
and he is trying to spoil them.

1506
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:37,416
Did it hurt?

1507
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:40,250
Hey! He says did it hurt!

1508
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,083
Yes, Nicole. Where are you?

1509
01:36:42,166 --> 01:36:44,041
Mom, we are at your mother's
brother's house.

1510
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,625
-Really?
-See it for yourself. She is very happy.

1511
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:48,875
-Let me show it to you.
-It has a lot of calories.

1512
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:50,375
I don't eat these things.

1513
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,250
You throw away the one
thing I could drink.

1514
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,666
You want some?

1515
01:36:59,166 --> 01:37:00,750
Don't say anything.

1516
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,083
-I won't be able to eat anything, dear.
-Are you happy now?

1517
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:07,416
I'll call you later, bye.

1518
01:37:08,291 --> 01:37:09,333
Eat it.

1519
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:12,791
Here, look this way.

1520
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:14,250
You too have some.

1521
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,916
"Scoundrel..."

1522
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:22,708
-Why are you cursing, brother?
-No, brother. I am not cursing.

1523
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:24,708
-I am just trying to hit the right notes.
-I am rehearsing.

1524
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:27,416
-Okay.
-These high mountains, these sunsets...

1525
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:29,958
-The flowing water, days fading away...
-Excellent.

1526
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:32,125
Wonderful,
that's quite deep, brother.

1527
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:34,708
-But what does it mean?
-I don't know what it means, brother.

1528
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:35,958
My master used to say it.

1529
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:40,791
These things get you
a girl very easily.

1530
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:41,916
Really, brother?

1531
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:43,791
Then do something for me too.

1532
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:44,958
Right away.

1533
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,125
Hear this.

1534
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,250
<span style="style.default_1">You and I...</span>

1535
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:52,041
<span style="style.default_1">You and I...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When we are close</span>

1536
01:37:52,416 --> 01:37:54,958
<span style="style.default_1">You look beautiful,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You hit sweet notes</span>

1537
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,791
<span style="style.default_1">A tree of mango...</span> what?

1538
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,083
-Mango.
-Yes.

1539
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,250
<span style="style.default_1">A tree of mango...</span>

1540
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:00,791
<span style="style.default_1">And a tree of goodness...</span>

1541
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,041
<span style="style.default_1">May you be mine</span>
<span style="style.default_1">What more could I want from this</span>

1542
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:06,166
<span style="style.default_1">What more could I want from this!</span>

1543
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:08,458
Amazing, brother. Superb.

1544
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:10,333
Write me another song.

1545
01:38:10,416 --> 01:38:11,916
No brother, one is enough.

1546
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,333
You just need to trap the girl,
not kill her.

1547
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,916
If the girl hears a few of
my songs, she will die.

1548
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:18,666
Brother,
actually, there are two girls.

1549
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:22,166
My heart says one thing and
my mind says another.

1550
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:23,875
There's a confusion.

1551
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:25,500
No, brother. I will get cursed.

1552
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:27,291
This isn't what my master
taught me. No.

1553
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:28,916
What has your master said?

1554
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,166
That I shouldn't teach one
boy how to trap two girls.

1555
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:32,541
I could lose my skill.

1556
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:34,916
You don't have any skill
to begin with.

1557
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,250
What did you say?

1558
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:37,625
I said your skills...

1559
01:38:38,375 --> 01:38:39,416
Don't challenge me.

1560
01:38:39,666 --> 01:38:41,750
If I start singing, I can light
up lamps with my songs.

1561
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:43,833
Then do that.

1562
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,583
Go to sleep!

1563
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:54,416
If I decide to find my slippers...

1564
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,166
you'll be singing
a different tune.

1565
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:58,083
She insulted my talent.

1566
01:38:58,375 --> 01:38:59,916
Mr. Nusrat would never
forgive her.

1567
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:03,208
-Take a blanket and go to sleep.
-You are right, brother.

1568
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:05,000
Come on, get in.

1569
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,375
It's just water, get in.

1570
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:09,791
-I won't be getting in that.
-Do you know how cold this water is?

1571
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:12,125
Dear, this is our Jacuzzi.

1572
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,750
Get in. Have a bath.

1573
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:15,666
-I won't bathe in it.
-Get in.

1574
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,833
Who knows when you will
come here next.

1575
01:40:17,916 --> 01:40:19,083
Get in. Come on.

1576
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:21,208
She says, "let me show
you our life."

1577
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:22,875
Now you look at our life.

1578
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:25,250
Come on, get in.

1579
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:47,833
They say glass rings and
delicate hearts...

1580
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:49,875
-What is your name again, brother?
-Amrik.

1581
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,250
Listen to me. Glass rings and
delicate hearts, don't break.

1582
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:59,208
The gifts I gave once in love,
please don't return them.

1583
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:00,541
Wonderful.

1584
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:05,208
-What a great poem, Manak.
-Stop fooling around. Let me play.

1585
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:06,625
Here, do whatever you want.

1586
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:08,291
Tell me, which one should I move?

1587
01:41:08,375 --> 01:41:10,541
-Left one or the right one?
-Whatever you like.

1588
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:15,083
The one on the left
is the one I like.

1589
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:16,333
Then remove the left one.

1590
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:24,000
Oh no, it's not you, but God
who makes all the moves.

1591
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:26,458
Heer demands and Ranjha offers.

1592
01:41:26,541 --> 01:41:27,666
What a poem, amazing!

1593
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:30,166
Aunt,
you just reminded me of a poem.

1594
01:41:30,291 --> 01:41:34,083
-Go ahead.
-I'll regret for being at your wedding.

1595
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:35,166
-What will I do, Dad?
-Regret it.

1596
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:38,666
I'll regret on being there
for your wedding.

1597
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:41,000
But don't you worry...

1598
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:46,541
I won't leave anything
undone at your funeral.

1599
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:49,750
I won't leave anything behind.

1600
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:51,083
Wonderful.

1601
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:54,000
Hey boy, take back his harmonium.

1602
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:56,250
-No, aunt.
-No brother, not the harmonium.

1603
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:57,291
Okay.

1604
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:14,583
Manak,
get some carrots from the field!

1605
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:16,875
We need to make carrot
pudding for your aunt.

1606
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:18,625
Or else she will take
the harmonium away.

1607
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:23,583
-Girls, what you see now...
Yes.

1608
01:42:23,791 --> 01:42:24,958
is the way of our life.

1609
01:42:25,375 --> 01:42:29,333
These bitter and sweets
moments make up life.

1610
01:42:29,416 --> 01:42:31,208
Life doesn't always have to be
about makeup and lipsticks.

1611
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:32,708
No matter how hard you try.

1612
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:34,250
I don't use any, Grandma.

1613
01:42:34,333 --> 01:42:35,375
This is a lip balm.

1614
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:38,125
I was just saying it, dear.
Come here, sit with me.

1615
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:42,583
Look, your mother left us.

1616
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:44,625
Sons kept me restricted
to a room.

1617
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:48,000
You had some pity on me
so you took me out.

1618
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:50,708
I am the same person.
I haven't changed.

1619
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,958
Now look at my brother,
he has been pampering me.

1620
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:57,916
Well,
it all depends on your mind.

1621
01:42:58,666 --> 01:43:01,041
You should fear God.

1622
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,791
Everyone has to face these days.

1623
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:05,333
-Grandma?
-Yes.

1624
01:43:05,458 --> 01:43:07,041
Which Gurudwara Sahib
is this one?

1625
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,916
Dear,
this is Shri Anandpur Sahib.

1626
01:43:13,833 --> 01:43:17,125
<span style="style.default_1">This is one of the Five Takhts</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of the Sikh religion.</span>

1627
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:29,458
<span style="style.default_1">Here Shri Guru Gobind Singh,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">baptized the Five Beloved Ones.</span>

1628
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:32,041
<span style="style.default_1">And laid the foundation</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of Sikh religion.</span>

1629
01:43:53,083 --> 01:43:57,250
<span style="style.default_1">Dear, these are the weapons</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Guru Gobind Singh...</span>

1630
01:43:57,458 --> 01:43:59,833
<span style="style.default_1">and his Singhs used to</span>
<span style="style.default_1">fight during the war.</span>

1631
01:44:04,666 --> 01:44:05,666
Give it here.

1632
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:08,041
Give me the other one,
not this one.

1633
01:44:11,791 --> 01:44:13,000
-Wow, this is delicious.
-Grandma, have an ice cream.

1634
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:15,208
You are offering ice cream to the girls?

1635
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,083
I brought one for you too.

1636
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,875
-Come here.
-Yes?

1637
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:20,625
You know everything.

1638
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,250
I have years of experience.

1639
01:44:22,333 --> 01:44:24,541
-Grandma...
-I was once young like you.

1640
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,875
It would be great if one
of them stays here.

1641
01:44:27,041 --> 01:44:29,125
At least she won't cause trouble
like her mother did.

1642
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:32,833
You can choose one of the two.

1643
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:36,083
If you say anything to the other
then here's my stick.

1644
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:37,583
Now give me my ice cream.

1645
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:38,833
Give it.

1646
01:44:52,958 --> 01:44:58,583
<span style="style.default_1">We can read each other's heart</span>

1647
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,416
<span style="style.default_1">We even gather small dreams together</span>

1648
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:08,166
<span style="style.default_1">I am a king and you are a queen</span>

1649
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:14,500
<span style="style.default_1">I am a king and you are a queen</span>

1650
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:17,458
<span style="style.default_1">We keep talking too</span>

1651
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:23,250
<span style="style.default_1">See if there is scope of love</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Between us too</span>

1652
01:45:23,625 --> 01:45:29,250
<span style="style.default_1">See if there is scope of love</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Between us too</span>

1653
01:45:29,791 --> 01:45:33,708
<span style="style.default_1">Between us too</span>

1654
01:45:36,083 --> 01:45:39,750
Hey, girl. God has blessed you
with a beautiful body.

1655
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:43,833
Why do you want to destroy
it by these scribblings?

1656
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,458
Grandma,
I just want one last tattoo.

1657
01:45:46,541 --> 01:45:48,958
-I want to write Justin Bieber here.
-Who is he?

1658
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,500
Look over here, Grandma.

1659
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:51,791
He is a singer.

1660
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,625
Don't you have any shame?

1661
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,375
You will write a stranger's
name on your chest?

1662
01:45:57,833 --> 01:45:59,958
Look at this idiot laughing.

1663
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:02,000
-Grandma!
-I am right, dear.

1664
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,833
You shouldn't destroy beauty...

1665
01:46:05,666 --> 01:46:07,000
With exposure.

1666
01:46:07,125 --> 01:46:08,416
It catches an evil eye.

1667
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:18,958
<span style="style.default_1">I can keep listening to you forever</span>

1668
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:25,041
<span style="style.default_1">I like the journey if you are with me</span>

1669
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:31,625
<span style="style.default_1">I can keep listening to you forever</span>

1670
01:46:31,708 --> 01:46:37,083
<span style="style.default_1">I like the journey if you are with me</span>

1671
01:46:37,166 --> 01:46:40,541
<span style="style.default_1">Why do we pray...</span>

1672
01:46:40,833 --> 01:46:46,500
<span style="style.default_1">Why do we pray for</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Each other's well being too?</span>

1673
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:52,625
<span style="style.default_1">If there is a scope of love</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Between us</span>

1674
01:46:53,083 --> 01:46:58,791
<span style="style.default_1">If there is a scope of love</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Between us</span>

1675
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:02,166
<span style="style.default_1">Between us</span>

1676
01:47:14,583 --> 01:47:20,708
<span style="style.default_1">Why are you dearer than</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The destination to me?</span>

1677
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:24,083
<span style="style.default_1">Why you feel like a support to someone</span>

1678
01:47:24,166 --> 01:47:26,458
<span style="style.default_1">Without a support like me?</span>

1679
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:32,833
<span style="style.default_1">Why are you dearer than</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The destination to me?</span>

1680
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:36,375
<span style="style.default_1">Why you feel like a support to someone</span>

1681
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:38,750
<span style="style.default_1">Without a support like me?</span>

1682
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:44,833
<span style="style.default_1">Why do we keep feeling</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Attracted towards each other?</span>

1683
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:51,125
<span style="style.default_1">If there is a scope of love</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Between us</span>

1684
01:47:51,416 --> 01:47:57,750
<span style="style.default_1">If there is a scope of love</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Between us</span>

1685
01:47:57,833 --> 01:48:05,083
<span style="style.default_1">If there is a scope of love</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Between us</span>

1686
01:48:05,166 --> 01:48:06,166
<span style="style.default_1">God Almighty</span>

1687
01:48:08,916 --> 01:48:10,791
These girls didn't keep you well,
Mother.

1688
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:14,083
Like you have kept feeding
me with healthy things.

1689
01:48:15,583 --> 01:48:17,041
Don't you have anything to say?

1690
01:48:17,125 --> 01:48:19,708
What happened if I threw
away the tea?

1691
01:48:19,916 --> 01:48:21,583
Couldn't you offer it
to me once again?

1692
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:23,083
She just left with the glass.

1693
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:25,250
And taunted me too.

1694
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,125
-And you two...
-You want me to transfer the land to you?

1695
01:48:29,208 --> 01:48:31,333
Kids come to their mother's
maternal home to have a good time.

1696
01:48:31,416 --> 01:48:33,333
But they've uncles like you...

1697
01:48:33,958 --> 01:48:35,541
then they'd never even
wish to look here.

1698
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:38,541
They are the daughters
of the sister...

1699
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,041
who fed you her
share of morsel.

1700
01:48:41,166 --> 01:48:43,041
You are a clever lot.

1701
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,750
And you Ajaib?

1702
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:47,333
It is your land.

1703
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:49,000
She won't be coming here.

1704
01:48:49,208 --> 01:48:50,208
Do you understand?

1705
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,625
Couldn't you be upfront?

1706
01:48:53,833 --> 01:48:55,500
Why did you have to beat
around the bush?

1707
01:48:55,708 --> 01:49:00,416
I thought your father never
invited them, but you did.

1708
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:02,416
Mother, you too were upset.

1709
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:04,083
Don't I have a right to be upset?

1710
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:05,541
And you can do whatever
you please?

1711
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:07,166
Don't you two too have brothers?

1712
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:09,166
Do they also behave like this?

1713
01:49:11,166 --> 01:49:13,041
Embroidered Indian dresses.

1714
01:49:13,166 --> 01:49:15,125
They aren't greedy for them.

1715
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,625
Her pants are more expensive than
all the clothes you have.

1716
01:49:21,708 --> 01:49:23,458
Grandma, it was the land
clerk who instigated us.

1717
01:49:23,541 --> 01:49:24,916
And how is he related to you?

1718
01:49:25,166 --> 01:49:26,375
Don't you have any brain?

1719
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:28,583
Let's go.

1720
01:49:35,708 --> 01:49:37,000
They just walked away.

1721
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,833
-Here you go, Mother.
-The fight over land has come to an end.

1722
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:47,166
Here you go, Mother.

1723
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:51,750
-What did you tear?
-The title of the land.

1724
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:53,291
Then what did I tear?

1725
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:02,916
-Damn!
-You tore that kid's certificate!

1726
01:50:03,333 --> 01:50:04,333
Idiots.

1727
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:09,375
Is that all?

1728
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:11,750
You lot, go and make some tea.

1729
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:14,708
You are sitting here as
if you are guests here.

1730
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:17,000
We'll make it, Mother.

1731
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:19,416
Aunt, I want some bread with
pickle along with tea.

1732
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:20,583
Sure, dear.

1733
01:50:21,458 --> 01:50:23,208
You taught them a good lesson.

1734
01:50:23,375 --> 01:50:25,166
Everybody's fine.

1735
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:31,958
Here you go.

1736
01:50:32,541 --> 01:50:34,166
Why don't you help me?

1737
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:35,916
Please,
like a good sister-in-law?

1738
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:38,250
You will have to talk
to her on your own.

1739
01:50:38,875 --> 01:50:40,500
She will say that the one
who cannot even say it...

1740
01:50:40,958 --> 01:50:42,041
how will he fulfil it?

1741
01:50:42,666 --> 01:50:45,625
And sharing your feelings with
a toy dog won't help.

1742
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:47,083
Just go ahead and tell
her everything.

1743
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,458
Shall I call her?

1744
01:50:49,916 --> 01:50:50,916
Yes.

1745
01:50:59,375 --> 01:51:01,666
<span style="style.default_1">Look at her waist move...</span>

1746
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,750
-Uncle?
-Yes?

1747
01:51:02,916 --> 01:51:06,125
Once I go to Canada, you will
be the first one I'll invite.

1748
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,375
God bless you, son.

1749
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:09,833
But when are you going?

1750
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,541
I'll go once you get me married.

1751
01:51:11,708 --> 01:51:16,083
Fine, I'll get you married but
first let us find a girl.

1752
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:17,875
Come on,
you have two girls at home...

1753
01:51:17,958 --> 01:51:20,250
and yet you want to go outside
to seek a bride for me?

1754
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:22,541
Damn you to hell!

1755
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:25,333
You have ill intentions for
the girls of our family!

1756
01:51:25,416 --> 01:51:26,916
-What happened, Ajaib?
-I'll teach you a lesson.

1757
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,208
What else could have happened,
Mother?

1758
01:51:28,291 --> 01:51:30,958
He has ill intentions for
the girls of our family!

1759
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:32,875
-Teach him a lesson.
-I'll send you to Canada, come on!

1760
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:35,166
Come here, Neeta!
Reshma, come here.

1761
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:38,916
Save me from uncle's wrath, aunt!
Hurry up!

1762
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,875
-Help! Someone save me!
-Hit him harder!

1763
01:51:41,958 --> 01:51:47,125
-Help me, aunt!
-He is your uncle, let him beat a little.

1764
01:51:47,666 --> 01:51:48,666
Uncle!

1765
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:51,375
Calm down.

1766
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,875
You think others are foolish.

1767
01:51:57,958 --> 01:52:00,250
-You are the only clever ones.
-Yes, yes.

1768
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,083
Reshma,
teach them a lesson right here.

1769
01:52:03,166 --> 01:52:06,791
-Hit him hard.
-Don't hit me, brother.

1770
01:52:06,875 --> 01:52:07,875
Oh no!

1771
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:10,583
Neeta, what are you waiting for?

1772
01:52:10,666 --> 01:52:12,458
-Hit him as well.
-Not my hair, not my hair...

1773
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:14,208
Teach a lesson to this lover boy.

1774
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:15,541
Brother, I am begging you.

1775
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:16,958
Brother... let me go, brother.

1776
01:52:17,041 --> 01:52:19,666
Turn his ears red.

1777
01:52:20,541 --> 01:52:21,541
Yes, Amrik?

1778
01:52:21,708 --> 01:52:23,541
Nicole said you wanted
to talk to me?

1779
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:28,666
I wanted to say that...

1780
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:33,708
Settle my dues.

1781
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:42,958
Fine.

1782
01:52:43,291 --> 01:52:45,541
I'll settle the dues tomorrow
when we go to the airport.

1783
01:52:46,958 --> 01:52:48,166
Okay.

1784
01:53:06,708 --> 01:53:09,625
Listen,
do you want to pinch or punch?

1785
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:11,541
-I'll pinch...
-I'll punch.

1786
01:53:11,625 --> 01:53:13,916
-Pinch him!
-Stop it!

1787
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:53,375
Take these.

1788
01:53:53,875 --> 01:53:55,166
Eat them here itself.

1789
01:53:55,625 --> 01:53:57,166
You won't even get
a bite outside.

1790
01:53:57,583 --> 01:53:58,708
They keep eating them
quite often.

1791
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:01,541
Manjeeti too used to feed
her brothers like this.

1792
01:54:02,166 --> 01:54:06,416
Oh no, I don't know why I
mentioned that cursed one.

1793
01:54:06,916 --> 01:54:07,916
Grandma...

1794
01:54:20,583 --> 01:54:22,625
Mom, here, talk to Grandma.

1795
01:54:30,041 --> 01:54:31,041
Hello, Mother?

1796
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:32,958
You finally missed me?

1797
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:38,125
Now will you only keep wailing or
will you also say something?

1798
01:54:38,833 --> 01:54:40,500
I made a mistake, Mother.

1799
01:54:40,666 --> 01:54:43,333
I was of such an age.
I didn't have any sense.

1800
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:45,250
You were smart enough.

1801
01:54:45,791 --> 01:54:47,750
You must have thought
that your father...

1802
01:54:47,833 --> 01:54:49,333
would marry you off to
someone dark and ugly.

1803
01:54:49,541 --> 01:54:51,666
So you found someone fair
as milk for yourself.

1804
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:59,333
Hey, I am sure he didn't love
you more than I did.

1805
01:55:01,291 --> 01:55:02,875
Did you never miss us, dear?

1806
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:05,208
I used to miss you a lot, Mother.

1807
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:08,500
But how could I talk to you?

1808
01:55:08,916 --> 01:55:11,041
I had made such a big mistake.

1809
01:55:13,291 --> 01:55:14,625
Please forgive me, Mother.

1810
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,750
"Please forgive me, Mother."

1811
01:55:17,041 --> 01:55:20,125
I feel like hitting you just the
way I had beaten you up...

1812
01:55:20,458 --> 01:55:25,208
in the storeroom, when you had
worn that embroidered dress.

1813
01:55:29,875 --> 01:55:31,541
Now will you only
keep crying or...

1814
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:33,125
will you say something as well?

1815
01:55:33,208 --> 01:55:35,083
Mother,
will you say something or...

1816
01:55:35,166 --> 01:55:36,916
will you only keep cursing me?

1817
01:55:47,541 --> 01:55:49,791
You look so good in the
embroidered dress.

1818
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:08,458
Look, I am wearing an embroidered
Indian dress.

1819
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:10,375
Moreover,
Grandma didn't beat me up.

1820
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:28,500
<span style="style.default_1">Why do the warm relationships of</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Tender age go cold as you age?</span>

1821
01:56:28,583 --> 01:56:32,291
<span style="style.default_1">Why do people so close to you...</span>

1822
01:56:32,416 --> 01:56:35,458
<span style="style.default_1">Keep you away from their heart?</span>

1823
01:56:43,416 --> 01:56:47,000
<span style="style.default_1">Why do the warm relationships...</span>

1824
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:50,583
<span style="style.default_1">Of tender age</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Go cold as you age?</span>

1825
01:56:50,708 --> 01:56:54,208
<span style="style.default_1">Keep you away from their heart?</span>

1826
01:56:54,291 --> 01:56:57,250
<span style="style.default_1">Keep you away from their heart?</span>

1827
01:56:57,958 --> 01:57:01,583
<span style="style.default_1">We had laughed and played together</span>

1828
01:57:01,666 --> 01:57:05,125
<span style="style.default_1">Who separated us, O' Mother?</span>

1829
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:08,875
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

1830
01:57:08,958 --> 01:57:12,041
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how, O' Mother</span>

1831
01:57:12,333 --> 01:57:16,125
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

1832
01:57:16,208 --> 01:57:19,250
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how, O' Mother</span>

1833
01:57:19,791 --> 01:57:22,416
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

1834
01:57:23,375 --> 01:57:26,500
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how, O' Mother</span>

1835
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,541
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

1836
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:33,791
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how, O' Mother</span>

1837
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:37,875
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how do I wipe the tears</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And smile, O' Mother</span>

1838
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:41,083
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how, O' Mother</span>

1839
01:57:41,583 --> 01:57:44,833
<span style="style.default_1">Tell me how, O' Mother</span>

1840
01:58:00,708 --> 01:58:01,750
Okay then, thanks.

1841
01:58:06,041 --> 01:58:07,041
Let's go.

1842
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:52,291
Have a safe journey.

1843
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:54,083
And call once you reach.

1844
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,083
I am thinking...

1845
01:58:56,166 --> 01:58:58,291
we don't know for how much
longer grandma will be among us.

1846
01:58:58,375 --> 01:59:00,000
I wish to spend some
more time with her.

1847
01:59:00,083 --> 01:59:01,875
You should come back
quickly with Mom.

1848
01:59:02,625 --> 01:59:03,625
I promise.

1849
01:59:05,458 --> 01:59:07,041
Buy yourself a guitar.

1850
01:59:14,333 --> 01:59:16,625
-He likes you. He's a good man.
-I know.

1851
01:59:17,041 --> 01:59:19,125
The one who cannot even say it,
how will he fulfil it?

1852
01:59:21,416 --> 01:59:22,666
I know you won't say it.

1853
01:59:23,458 --> 01:59:25,958
Fine, say it to him instead then.

1854
01:59:26,875 --> 01:59:27,916
Don't act too smart.

1855
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,166
Don't miss your flight.

1856
02:00:02,958 --> 02:00:04,708
You want to take Grandma
out again?

1857
02:00:05,041 --> 02:00:06,750
Okay, let's take her to Shimla.

1858
02:00:07,083 --> 02:00:08,291
Such a wimp.

1859
02:00:09,583 --> 02:00:11,125
Do you know any good tattoo artist around?

1860
02:00:11,208 --> 02:00:12,083
Yes, I do.

1861
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,125
-Let's go there.
-Let's go.

1862
02:00:26,791 --> 02:00:28,666
Hey, girl. You didn't leave?

1863
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:30,708
I had, but I returned.

1864
02:00:32,083 --> 02:00:34,958
-Where's your sister?
-She left. She will be back with Mom.

1865
02:00:35,666 --> 02:00:37,666
Girl, either stay back or leave.

1866
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:39,291
Don't keep changing your mind.

1867
02:00:39,375 --> 02:00:41,666
It's confusing whether we
should feel happy or sad.

1868
02:00:41,916 --> 02:00:44,000
Don't worry, uncle.
I am here to stay.

1869
02:00:44,083 --> 02:00:45,208
I won't be going back.

1870
02:00:45,333 --> 02:00:46,333
Really?

1871
02:00:46,583 --> 02:00:47,833
What will you do here, dear?

1872
02:00:48,083 --> 02:00:49,333
I used to run a restaurant there.

1873
02:00:49,416 --> 02:00:50,541
Here I shall open a
local roadside restaurant.

1874
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:51,583
Kash...

1875
02:00:52,375 --> 02:00:53,958
I wanted to talk to you.

1876
02:00:54,208 --> 02:00:56,000
Uncle, settle his dues.

1877
02:00:56,083 --> 02:00:57,750
Sure.
Tell me, how much do we owe you?

1878
02:00:57,958 --> 02:01:00,125
No, I wanted to talk about
something else.

1879
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:04,916
-Oh, really?
-Then say it in front of everyone.

1880
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:07,000
Why hide anything
from the family?

1881
02:01:07,875 --> 02:01:09,166
In front of everyone?

1882
02:01:10,541 --> 02:01:11,541
Go ahead, son.

1883
02:01:12,083 --> 02:01:14,666
Grandma, I have chosen...

1884
02:01:15,791 --> 02:01:17,666
Now save me from
getting thrashed.

1885
02:01:18,416 --> 02:01:19,958
I really like you a lot.

1886
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:23,833
I won't be going to Canada.

1887
02:01:24,083 --> 02:01:25,083
It's okay.

1888
02:01:25,166 --> 02:01:28,375
When you open your restaurant,
I'll peel potatoes for you.

1889
02:01:30,041 --> 02:01:32,958
Grandma, shall we go after him?
He is flirting with our aunt.

1890
02:01:33,041 --> 02:01:36,333
No, he is no stranger.
He is your uncle.

1891
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:37,708
Don't go after him.

1892
02:01:37,958 --> 02:01:40,833
Instead shift his bed,
get it here.

1893
02:01:44,791 --> 02:01:45,791
Go, hurry up.

1894
02:01:46,291 --> 02:01:47,833
-Wonderful.
-Come here, son.

1895
02:01:51,958 --> 02:01:53,916
-When uncle will show up...
-They will cook meat.

1896
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,250
-When uncle will show up...
-They will cook meat.

1897
02:01:58,583 --> 02:02:01,000
Girl, you couldn't stop yourself
from getting these scribbling...

1898
02:02:01,083 --> 02:02:04,375
-could you?
-Didn't I say I wanted a tattoo?

1899
02:02:04,458 --> 02:02:05,291
I got it done.

1900
02:02:05,375 --> 02:02:08,291
Grandma, aunt has your
name written on her arm.

1901
02:02:18,916 --> 02:02:21,750
Come on, get started on
peeling the garlic.

1902
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:24,958
We need to make chicken
for the son-in-law.

1903
02:02:25,041 --> 02:02:27,083
Why would the ladies peel them?

1904
02:02:27,250 --> 02:02:28,416
If you want to eat it
then you'll peel them.

1905
02:02:28,541 --> 02:02:29,375
Right.

1906
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:31,166
Fine, dear.

1907
02:02:31,250 --> 02:02:34,625
Now I fear you might want to
become the village chief.

1908
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,416
What are you looking at, kids?

1909
02:02:56,125 --> 02:02:57,833
Uncle is talking to aunt.

1910
02:02:57,916 --> 02:02:59,500
Uncles are allowed to talk.

1911
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:01,833
Come on, come with me.

1912
02:03:06,958 --> 02:03:08,250
Such smiles!

1913
02:03:08,958 --> 02:03:10,250
What else is left to do?

1914
02:03:11,583 --> 02:03:13,333
You couldn't go to Canada.

1915
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:17,333
It's okay.
Canada for me is where you are.

1916
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:18,708
Oh my!

1917
02:03:21,208 --> 02:03:24,125
Now say that while looking
into my eyes.

1918
02:03:30,041 --> 02:03:31,291
I won't be able to say it.

1919
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:34,625
I sometimes feel that you are
a girl and I am a boy.

1920
02:03:36,916 --> 02:03:38,041
Then you say it.

1921
02:03:38,708 --> 02:03:39,833
What should I say?

1922
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:41,083
Tell me.

1923
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:45,750
You want a hug?

1924
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:12,958
<span style="style.default_1">They are jealous</span>

1925
02:04:13,041 --> 02:04:14,416
<span style="style.default_1">They are envious of me</span>

1926
02:04:14,625 --> 02:04:17,375
<span style="style.default_1">The ones who click pictures with you</span>
