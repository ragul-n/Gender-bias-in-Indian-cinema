No negotiations.

Dude, l want to be famous.

47
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,400
Famous Hollywood people should
copy our dance style.

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,400
l just want money in life.

49
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500

You? - l just want a chance to

57
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,500
Sunny, just one chance.

58
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
What will you do if
you get the chance?

59
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Do you think we're worthless?

60
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
l'll become a postman.

61
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,300
My dad has talked in
some courier company.

62
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Now l'll just deliver letters.

63
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,300
But l'll give love letters to
those who watch our dance.

64
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,400
So no dance, no love letters.

65
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Guys, chill! lt'll all happen.

66
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,300
Don't worry.

67
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,500
This city treats everyone
like this.

68
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
But if you don't lose hope
or let your dreams..

69
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
..shatter this city
will give you fame.

70
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,200
Don't think where we are today.

71
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,300
Think where we'll be in future.

72
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,300
You'll be on the road tomorrow.
Get out. Get out.

73
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,300
What happened?

74
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,400
-You sit here daily but you don't
even spend 5 rupees on purchase.

75
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Give him 5 rupees.

76
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,500
All the showroom owners
are complaining.

77
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
You've made a den in
this shopping mall.

78
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,300
Others are following your suit.

79
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Look, people have made
it a picnic spot.

80
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,500
Get out. Throw them out. -You..

81
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,400
lf you mess with us, you'll
be in trouble.

82
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
Their air condition
wasn't working.

83
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
l won't return even
if they call me.

84
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
There are 36 more malls
in this city.

85
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,300
We'll spend 10 days
in each mall.

86
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
We can spend the entire year.

87
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,400
What will we do for 5 remaining
days? -Holiday, pal.

88

New award starts every day.
How many will a person win?

92
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,300
You'll have to buy a new flat
to keep these awards.

93
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,300
That's why l don't work hard.

94
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,300
Sunny, l'll buy a penthouse for
you. Just start wining awards.

95
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,300
We even got a dance contract.

96
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Really? -Yes.

97
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,400
Guys, where do we have to dance?

98
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
ln a wedding.

99
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
Have you gone mad? -Will
we get money?

100
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,300
4000 rupees for 4 hours, man.

101
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,400
Let's do it. -Now we'll
dance in weddings.

102
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,400
We're not street performers.
-Let's dance.

103
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
Sunny, l said no. -Please come.

104
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
No. -Junior. Let's

Rishi. -Yes.

111
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,300
Do you want to commit suicide?

112
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,300
l'll have to. -What?

113
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,400
Sunny, l don't want to dance
in wedding for life.

114
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
l thought dance was
your passion.

115
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,400
lt's passion, but should
l dance at a brothel.

116
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
You..

117
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Dude, you think too much.

118
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,400
What has to happen will
surely happen.

119
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
lf you're destined to
be famous, you'll be.

120
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Or else we'll go..

121
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,300
To a brothel!

122
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,500
Yes, l almost forget.

Take this.

124
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,500
They're miser.

125
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,300
We can't earn livelihood even
after selling our ideals.

126
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Sunny, do you even know
how to spell ideals?

127
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,400
l don't know how to spell prime
minister. Can l become one?

128
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
You've a point.

129
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,200
Be it your or my ideals,
it's the same.

Or my money will be wasted.

141
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,300

l'll reform if you give me
the keys of the bike.

145
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,300
We charmed everyone.

181
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,500
That's right. -We're on
the right track, guys.

182
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Yes. -You're not on the
right track yet.

183
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,300
But l can take you there.

184
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,300
Have we met before? -No,
but we'll keep meeting.

185
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,500
lf you're wise.

186
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
l think uncle has got marriage
proposal for Rishi.

187
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,400
ls uncle bluffing Rishi? -l
can make you forget dance.

188
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,400
Now can l introduce myself?

189
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,300
Sorry, sir. Go on.

190
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,400
You dance well.

191
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,300
There's passion in your dance.

192
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
That's why l want to
invite you to cave.

193
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Cave? -What's cave?

194
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,400
Cave will provide you the
platform to get success.

195
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,300
That's fine, sir,
but who are you?

196
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,300
Palash!

197
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
See you soon. -Oh!

198
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
He said it, pal!

199
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Stop it!

200
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,400
What a waste, man!

201
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Hey, how's that? -Cross my leg.

202
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,400
God bless man!

203
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,300
Dance.

204
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,500
Have you come for evening walk?

205
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
We were thinking of
settling here.

206
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,500
People like you squat anywhere.

207
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,400
What? Never smelled
cologne before.

208
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
What's that?

209
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,400
This is cave. And only
challengers step in here.

210
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,300
So challenge or else leave.

211
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Do you've the guts?

212
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,500
We have. Whom do we've
to challenge?

213
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Guys, listen up.

214
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,400
They want to know whom do
they've to challenge.

215
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Vicky! Vicky!

216
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,200
Vicky! Vicky!

217
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
Vicky! Vicky!

218
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,300
Well! Well!

219
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,400
l see you guys have made
yourself feel at home. Good.

220
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Welcome to the caves,
boys. Welcome.

221
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,500
He's Vicky! The champion here.

222
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Bet here. And if you've
guts win everything.

223
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,400
There are no rules
here. No judges.

224
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Public decides the winner.

225
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,400
He's a champion for
past 3 years.

226
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,400
lf you want you can
challenge him.

227
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
They'll challenge me!

228
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,300
They look zeroes.

229
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,500
But in 15 minutes zeroes
can become heroes.

230
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Think about it. -What's
there to think?

231
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Even if we lose, we'll
lose to a champion.

232
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,300
l like your spirit.

233
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
By the way, what's
your group called?

234
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Zeroes! -Zeroes!

235
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Ready? -Absolutely!

236
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,500

Funk it up! Funk it up!

258
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Fast!

259
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Shake your body.

260
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,400
Shake your body. -Funk it up!

261
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Move your body. -Funk it up!

262
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,300
Shake your body. -Funk it up!

263
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,400
Move your body.

264
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,500
Shake!

265
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Shake!

266
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,400
Hey, guys!

267
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,400
Guys! Guys!

268
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,300
Fantastic dancing!
Fantastic dancing!

269
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Ok. Ok.

270
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Did you enjoy? Did you enjoy?

271
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,300
So who won?

272
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,400
Vicky warriors?

273
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,400
Or Zeroes!

274
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Yes!

275
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,400
Yeah!

276
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,400
You're prize money.

277
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,300
l think these loafers
got lucky today.

278
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,300
They'll get to get eat
stomach full tonight.

279
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
First l'll thrash you.

280
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,300
Stop it.

281
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
This looks like boxing ring,
but this is a stage.

282
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Settle all your problems
with dance.

283
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,300
Ok, l challenge you again.

284
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,500
lt's no use. You'll keep losing
and we'll keep wining.

285
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
We'll get bored.

286
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,500
But let's make it a bit more
interesting this time.

287
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,300
This time let's bet
500,000 not 5000.

288
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
800,000.

289
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,300
1 million. -Money
is showering!

290
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Done. -What are you doing?
How will you arrange it?

291
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,400
What, man? -Listen, you can't
go back on your words.

292
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,300
We've said agreed
and it's final.

293
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,300
Ok. After 2 weeks in
the same way these..

294
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,400
..two teams will compete again.

295
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,300
Vicky, come on!

296
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,300
Sunny. -Rishi, how will
we get so much money?

297
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,500
Don't worry. There's a student
in my dance class, Mehta.

298
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
He's a gambler.

299
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,300
l've talked to him. He'll
bet the money.

300
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Sir, if you had the money, you
should've bet 200,000 more.

301
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,400
We could've got 200,000 each.

302
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,200
We need a place to rehearse.

303
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
But where's such a big
rehearsal hall?

304
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
We'll arrange something.

305
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
l'm famished, pal.

306
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,400
Order pizza.

307
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
You'll eat pizza when
we're short of money.

308
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,300
lt's the right to eat pizza.

309
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,400
We can anything when we're rich.

310
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,300
But pizza is the food for poor.

311
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
We don't have to pay.

312
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,500
We just have to stop the pizza
boy for half an hour.

313
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,300
What an idea!

314
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,300
Hello. Yes, brother.
The prey is here.

315
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,400
Brother, tell me this
address. -Address?

316
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,400
lt's simple. Go straight.
Then right..

317
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,300
Brother, first check it.

318
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,300
There's nothing to check. lt's
the usual. Hold this.

319
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,200
So what was l saying?

320
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,400
Right. Take right
and go straight.

321
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,400
And then right. And then pull
over and turn right.

322
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Right?

323
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,500
We'll get pizza for free.

324
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,500
We'll get pizza for free.

325
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
l think.. -Oh, no!

326
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,400
We won't open the door. He'll
ring and then leave.

327
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,300
That's guy is mad, man!

328
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Sunny.

329
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Open.

330
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,400
Sure, dude. First let
me close the door.

331
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Door is here.

332
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,500
Door. Pizza. -Exactly.

333
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,300
Come, please.

334
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Sunny, you're trapped.

335
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,500
Shake one!

336
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Excuse me.

337
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Excuse me.

338
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Does Rishi live here?

339
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,300
Rishi? -Yes.

340
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,500
Yes, Rishi.

341
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,500
Rishi used to live here,
but not any more.

342
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,500
What? -He left. He
left us. -What?

343
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,500
He died. -What?

344
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,300
That's why we can't take pizza.
Rishi died. -What?

345
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,400
Brother. -Brother?

346
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
Who will pay for it?
-Brother. -Jill.

347
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,400
Oh my God!

348
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
You.. Are you fine?
-What happened?

349
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,300
He said.. Who is this?

350
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,500
l'm in trouble! -Who is he?

351
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,300
There's a limit to everything.

352
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,300
What were you saying just now?

353
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
What if l had a heart attack
after listening this?

354
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,400
Tell me. -Pizza.

355
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,300
What pizza?

356
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,300
Even kids know that we shouldn't
say such thing. And you..

357
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,300
Jill, chill! -Brother, no chill.

358
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
This is not funny. What does
he think of himself?

359
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,200
He's like that only.

360
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,300
He can say that for anyone
to save money. -You..

361
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,300
Freak! -You too!

362
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Don't worry. lt hasn't happened
for the first time with you.

363
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
What a mess have you turned
this house into?

364
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,300
lt means, you stay like this.
-l had cleaned this morning.

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Let it be. l'll do it.

368
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,400
Brother, l miss you a lot.

369
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,400
Come on chill. l was kidding.
l was just kidding.

373
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,300
Why do you say so?

374
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,500
Actually l came to surprise you.

375
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,200
But your stupid friend
surprised me.

376
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
He's a bit strange, but he's
a nice guy. He's okay.

377
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,300
He's not a nice guy.
He's a freak.

378
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,200
How long will you stay here?

379
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,500

380
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,400
l'll leave when it
gets completed.

381
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,500
You'll bore me for long. -Yes.

382
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Where did you bring us?
-Come, l'll show you.

383
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Come, Dandiya.

384
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,300
Come on. Come.

So brothers, this is our new
rehearsal ground. -This ruin!

386
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,400
Dandiya, look at your
rehearsal ground.

387
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,300
lt's not here, but on the
terrace. -On terrace?

388
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,500
Yes, friend. Come on.

389
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
On terrace? Are you mad?

390
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,500
Stop counting. Let it be. Come.

391
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,300
We'll be dead. -Why did you
bring us in this haunted place?

392
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,300
To attend wedding of ghosts.

393
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,300
Where is the lift?

394
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,300
Lift? l've ordered it.

395
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
lt'll be ready soon. -What?

396
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,400
This is the only problem
in this building.

397
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Viraat, how will we
go on terrace?

398
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,300

Come on, guys. Come.

406

Dandiya, come.

407
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Did you drink milk
in the morning?

408
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Bring Sunny. -lts straight
to heaven.

409
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,400
This is the only chance
to go to heaven..

410
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
..or else you'll land in hell.

411
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,400
Come on. -ln hell there'll
at least be lift.

412
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Yes!

413
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Wow!

414
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
You've found a terrible
place, Viraat.

415
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,500
l got tired coming up here.

416
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,500
lf we come daily, we'll be in
hospital not in 'Cave'. -Yes.

417
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,400
You're right.

418
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,400
From tomorrow l'll practice
at home. -Me too.

419
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,200
Right. -Me too.

420
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,400
No. From tomorrow we'll
come here at 10 daily.

421
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,200
What are you saying,
man? No way.

422
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,300
And if anyone comes late, he'll
lose his share in 1 million.

423
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
What? -No, pal.

424
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
ls there anyone to
challenge us? -No.

425
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,300
When did dancers get born
in Nalla Sopara?

426
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
No, Vicky. They won't
return to Cave.

427
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,300
They're paupers. They can't
arrange 1 million rupees.

428
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,500
They said that in passion.
They got lucky that day.

429
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,300
No. Don't underestimate them.

430
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,500
They've defeated us earlier.

431
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,400
They've a passion to win. -We'll
douse that passion.

432
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
Even some team defeat team
like Australia sometimes.

433
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
lt doesn't mean they're
champions.

434
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,300
They're zeroes and will
stay that way.

435
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,400
True. But this time we'll
wipe their fate too.

436
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,200
l'll defeat them in
such a way, that..

437
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,400
..they'll forget dance forever.

438
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Who is it?

439
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,400
What is this?

440
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,400
Brother!

441
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,300
l'm quitting studies.
-What happened?

442
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,400
l can't do marketing. l'm
fit to be a house wife.

443
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Get me married. -What
happened now?

444
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,300
Brother, today l couldn't
sell even one lipstick.

445
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,400
l didn't get any response.

446
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,300
Stop giggling.

447
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,300
Brother, please do something.
Help me or else l'll fail.

448
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,500
l'll think if l get tea.

449
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,500
You want bribe for such
a small thing. -Yes.

450
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,300
First tell me the plan.

451
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,500
One fool can help me. -Who?

452
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,500
Sunny.

453
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
That freak! -Yes.

454
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,500
Selling product is the easiest
work in the world.

455
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Once l sold a shop to its owner.

456
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,300
Yes, right. Freak!

457
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Look, anything..

458
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,300
l'm repeating. One can sell
anything to anyone.

459
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Sunny, can you sell this
lipstick to a man.

460
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,300
Man? -Why not?

461
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,400
You can sell anything
to anyone. Right?

462
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,300
Yes. Sure.

463
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
No problem. lt'll be done.

464
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,300

-Excuse me, sir.

465

Yes. -We've ladies shades

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,500
Would you like to buy
them for your wife?

467
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,300
Let me see.

468
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,400
-Sir, your wife will look like
an actress using this lipstick.

469
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
And then you'll love kissing
her. -Oh really!

470
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,400

471
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,500
Sorry, sir. We don't offer

Please. -Leave me.

475
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Stupid! l'm not a prostitute!

476
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
What did you say?

477
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,400
l'm waiting for lift.

478
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,500
People stop or leave thinking
that l might be a prostitute.

00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,300
Look, l didn't.. -l've

Come on! How can it be?

570
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,300
lt's like that. -You mean you
never had a girl friend?

571
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,400
You don't have a girl friend?

572
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:23,300
Are such people there in Mumbai
in these days? -Yes.

573
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,400
So you never held any girl's
hand or kissed her.

574
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,500
And you're a virgin.

575
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,300
lt's the limit!

576
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,500
Now you'll say that you'll
be a bachelor for life.

577
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,300
No, seriously.

578
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,400
Since childhood l just
wanted to dance.

579
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
And l didn't think of anything
else. -Really?

580
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,500
You know, l would love
to see your dance.

581
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,400
l'll show it to you.

582
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:09,300
Do you know dancing?
-Not at all.

583
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,400
Why?

584
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,400
l don't like girls
who dance. -What?

585
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,300
Really?

586
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,300
Oh God!

587
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,300
l think l've to teach you a lot.

588
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,300
You've missed so much in life.

589
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,300
Maybe.

590
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,500
No problem. Now l'm with you.

591
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,400
Life will be more complete.

592
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
No. l'll go first. -Left, right.

593
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,400
Left. Right.

594
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Brother Sunny! -Brother
has come.

595
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,500
Doesn't it seem like
a different world?

596
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,400
Me too. -Really? They're
very good.

597
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,300
But Sunny, you don't
fit here. - Why?

598
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,200
Don't they look like me?

599
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,500
Actually l was raised here.

600
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,400
My dad was a caretaker here.

601
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,300
l left when he passed away.

602
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,200
Get him down. He won't
take medicine.

603
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,400
But this is my house.

604
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,300
Let's live the present.
Forget the future.

605
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,400
Let's live the present.
Forget the future.

606
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,300
We're the king of hearts.
Enjoy every moment.

607
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,400
Let's dance forgetting
the world.

608
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,200
What should we do if our
hearts want to dance?

609
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,400
What should we do if our
hearts want to dance?

610
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,400
What should we do if our
hearts want to dance?

611
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,400
What should we do if our
hearts want to dance?

612
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,200
Let's relish each and
every moment of joy.

613
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,300
We've our life to make
our dreams come true.

614
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,400
We're different from others.

615
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,300
We do as we wish.

616
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Why should we be afraid
of this world?

617
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
We live merrily.

618
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,500
We've each other's support.

619
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,300
We share our joy.

620
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,400
Let's dance forgetting
the world.

621
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,200
What should we do if our
hearts want to dance?

622
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,300
What should we do if our
hearts want to dance?

623
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,400
What should we do if our
hearts want to dance?

624
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,400
Jill. Jill.

625
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Jill.

626
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,300
Jill. What's your problem
in life? -Nothing.

627
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Why did you stop dance?
Everyone was enjoying.

628
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,300
Sunny, l don't dance.

629
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
What? Have you vowed?

630
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,300
Just leave me alone.
You won't get it.

631
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,500
There has to be a reason.
-There's no reason.

632
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,400
Ok. Sorry. Sorry.

633
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,500
But tell me something.

634
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,500
Why do you show attitude?

635
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,300
Brother has told
me not to. -Why?

636
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,300
He dances everywhere.
Why will he stop you?

637
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,300
l don't know. -Should
l talk to him?

638
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,400
Really? -Yes. Why not?

639
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,200
What will you say if brother
asks why you're..

640
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,400
..interfering between
brother and sister?

641
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,400
Simple, l'll say l..

642
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,300
Jill!

643
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,400
Will you dance with me forever?

644
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:42,400
l've lost myself in you.

645
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:51,300
The city seems to
be estranged.

646
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,400
l keep looking for you.

647
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,500
l'm crazy about you.

648
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:14,400
You're always with me.

649
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:24,300
We've lost our sleep after
meeting each other.

650
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,300
Don't touch the cap. -Please.

651
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,500
Let it be. -Stop kidding.
-What should we do?

652
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,500
He holds it like this. And
then he does head-spins.

653
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,400
lt was absolutely fabulous.

654
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,400
Dance-hitters!

655
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,300
Come on!

656
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,500
Panz! -Chimpanzee!

657
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
No, it's Pansy.

658
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,400
When did you come out of zoo?
-lt wasn't fun without you.

659
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,300
Yes! -Let it be,
Sunny. Let's go.

660
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,200
Guys, come on. Relax.

661
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,300
We won't be molesting you right
now. We'll do it in 'Cave'.

662
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,300
ln front of everyone. -You don't
think of anything else.

663
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
Look, concentrate on dance.

664
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,400
Or else do you remember what
happened in 'Cave'. Molestation!

665
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,300
Let it be. We'll deal with
him on stage. -Stage.

666
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,300
Do you know you have to get
1 million to get on stage?

667
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,300
Forget about 1 million. Think
of the money you'll lose.

668
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,300
Keep a pain killer.

669
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,500
You'll be in pain after
losing all your money.

670
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,300
You'll feel the pain
this time in cave.

671
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,300
And pain killer won't do.
Call ambulance this time.

672
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,300
Don't worry. l'll pay
for the ambulance.

673
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,300
Adieus, stud! -Listen.

674
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,300
We'll book your bed
in maternity ward.

675
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
When l hit someone, don't
interfere. -Ok. Ok.

676
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,300
But tell me, will we get
the money tomorrow?

677
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,300
Let's go to Mehta and
get the money.

678
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,400
Where are you going? Whom do
you want to meet? -Mehta.

679
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
He left for America
yesterday. -What?

680
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
When will he return?
-l don't know.

681
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,400
Then who knows?

682
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,400
Thank you.

683
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,300
What will we do now? How
will we get 1 million?

684
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,500
What are you thinking? -Sit.

685
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,300
Sunny, sit on the bike.

686
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,300
Brother Palash. -Brother Palash.

687
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,400
Brother Palash

688
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,300
Brother Palash

689
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
Come. Come.

690
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,400
l love to see you, guys.

691
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,200
Are you ready for the
competition? -You keep quiet.

692
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,200
l'll talk to him.

693
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:53,500
What will you do with
1 million? -Tell him.

694
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,300
Brother Palash, we
need some money.

695
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,500
We couldn't arrange 1 million.

696
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,400
Did l force you to bet?

697
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,400
lf you want to make it big,
control your vigor.

698
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,300
Dance isn't enough for dance.

699
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,400
You've just 2 days.

700
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,400
lf you can't arrange the money,
don't ever come here.

701
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,300
What happened? Why are you
looking so worried?

702
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,200
ls the money so important?

703
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,400
-We got this platform
with great difficulty.

704
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,300
We'll have to start with zero,
if we fail this time.

705
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,300
Look, don't worry. Something
will come up. Ok?

706
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,500
lt doesn't happen with me.

707
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,500
l tried everything, but nothing
good ever happened.

708
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,500
l'm sorry.

709
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
l wish l could help you.

710
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,300
Brother Janga, tea.

711
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,300
Brother Janga! Cigarette!

712
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,300
Wait here. l'll be back.

713
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,500
Where is brother? -lnside.

714
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,500
Brother Janga.

715
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
How are you, son?

716
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,300
Fine, brother.

717
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,500
Have you come to meet me
or take money? -Both.

718
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,500
You're shrewd.

719
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,400
You've of our community.

720
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,400
How much do you want?
- 1 million, brother.

721
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,300
For how many days? -2 days.

722
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,400
lnterest will be 10,000
rupees. -Ok.

723
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,300
You'll be shot if you don't
return the money.

724
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,500
Times have changed now.

725
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,400
People become dishonest.

726
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,400
Want to get shot?

727
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:23,200
Smily, if we fall down, kids
will think you're a kite.

728
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,400
Come. Get down.

729
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,400
Let's rehearse. Come on.

730
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,500
Come. What are you doing?

731
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,300
Nothing will change in our
life. Why do we dream?

732
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Viraat, do you still have
that postman job offer?

733
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,400
l rejected it long ago.

734
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,500
We're climbing 25 floors
daily in vain.

735
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,300
Why aren't you rehearsing?

736
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,300
Don't you want to defeat Vicky?

737
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,500
We got the money,
guys. Let's rock.

738
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,200
Yes.

739
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,400
Look.

740
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,400
Oh God!

741
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,300
What?

742
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,400
Who is this item..

743
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500
l mean, who is this girl?

744
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,400
Guys, Disha. -Hi!

745
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Hi! -Disha.

746
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,300
Have you gone mad?

747
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,300
You went to get money
and got a girl.

748
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,300
Sunny, stop it. -So you're
Sunny. Right?

749
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,300
Yeah. Hi. -Hi.

750
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,300
Nice to.. -No. Not
this time, Sunny.

751
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,300
Your choice has improved.

752
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,500
She's better than the
last 18 girls. -What?

753
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,200
l'm kidding.

754
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,300
But Rishi, start rehearsing
from today.

755
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:41,300
Dance-hitters! Are these
rented clothes?

756
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,400
Thanks for coming. You've
come to pay the money.

757
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,300
We won't have to toil, pal.

758
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,400
l mean thank you. Seriously
thank you.

759
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,300
Give me a kiss.

760
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,400
Don't touch.

761
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,400
Just wait and watch!

762
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,300
Rishi, that's our step!

763
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,300
They're copying our step.
-How did they know?

764
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,300
What's happening?

765
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,300
Why did you call
her? -Rishi. l..

766
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,200
Why? How dare you?

767
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,300
Brother, please stop it.

768
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,400
l had told you not to dance
again. Didn't it?

769
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,400
Rishi, don't do it. -You'll
lecture me now. You?

770
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,400
Brother. -No.

771
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,300
l've lost! l've lost.

772
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,400
Rishi. Where is Rishi? -lnside.

773
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,500
Why did you come? -Meaning?

774
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,300
You did that drama and you're
asking why we came here.

775
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:06,300
What has happened to you? The
game was worth 1 million.

776
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,300
We could've won it.
Even you know that.

777
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,400
We had so many hopes.

778
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,300
lf Disha betrayed
you, why ruin us?

779
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
Sunny, it'll be better
if you drop it.

780
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,400
l don't want to see
you again. Got it?

781
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,300
What problem do you've
with my face?

782
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,300
You had to get my
sister involved.

783
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,200
l trusted you. -l didn't
betray your trust.

784
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:43,300
l love Jill. -l know your love.

785
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,300
Actually brother has problem
with my dancing.

786
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,300
What's this new drama?

787
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,200
lt's between Jill and l. You
stay out of it. Got it?

788
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,400
No, brother.

789
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,200
Today l want to know why you
stop me from dancing.

790
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,400
Brother, you know my passion
for dance is same as yours.

791
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,400
Why do you want to control my
life? Who are you to do it?

792
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,400
Go and dance.

793
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,300
Just like mom.

794
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,300
Many people came to
watch mom's dance.

795
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,300
Filthy people!

796
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,300
Mom thought l was a kid, but
l understood everything.

797
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,300
l feared for Jill.

798
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,300
That's why when l flee
home l wasn't scared!

799
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,300
Brother.

800
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,400
Want some tea?

801
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,400
l'm sorry, brother.
l'm really sorry.

802
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:10,400
l didn't know that you've
endured so much alone.

803
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:19,400
But really, l didn't
do it to hurt you.

804
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,400
l'm sorry.

805
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,500
l know.

806
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,300
You think l'm trying to
control your life.

807
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,500
l dance, but stop you
from dancing. -No.

808
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,400
Ok, Jill. l quit dancing.

809
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,300
Brother. -And it's up to you if
you want to go with Sunny.

810
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:57,300
l won't stop you. But don't
return to me ever.

811
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,500
l know that boy.

812
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,300
He had affair with many girls.

813
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,300
l got betrayed once.

814
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:16,400
lf you want to get betrayed,
it's your wish.

815
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,200
Got ruined! Got ruined!

816
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,400
Got ruined! Got ruined!

817
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,300
Rishi ruined our
lives big times!

818
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,300
lt's his thinking, pal.

819
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,400
What else can he do if his
mother is like that?

820
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,400
We've been friends for years,
but he never told us.

821
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,300
Who can say that? -lf his mother
was like that, why did he..

822
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,300
What if we were in his shoe?
Don't talk nonsense.

823
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,400
To top it, this Disha.

824
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,400
He liked a girl for
the first time.

825
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,200
God! -That's why one should
stay away from girls.

826
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,300
His Disha and your Jill.

827
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,300
lt happened because of them.

828
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,400
When did you start
affair with Jill?

829
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:17,300
Talk with respect. -l mean, when
did Jill and you hooked up?

830
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,500
Sorry. l mean love.

831
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,400
Even l don't know.

832
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,300
Even you've one. -Don't drag me.

833
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,300
You guys don't understand.
-We do.

834
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,300
Maybe more than you know.

835
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,400
Now tell us what to do next.

836
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,500
l'll go to him.

837
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,300
He said that in anger, but he
can't be angry for long.

838
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,400
He's our friend.

839
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,400
Disha!

840
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,500
ls your name Disha or did
you give me fake name?

841
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,300
What do you want?

842
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,500
Why did you do this? Why
did you play games?

843
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,300
Just leave me alone.

844
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Did you love me? -What?

845
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,500
What kind of a dumb
question is that?

846
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,400
You're a bloody prostitute.

847
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,300
Keep your hands off
her. You stupid..

848
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,400
Vicky!

849
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,300
Stop it! Stop it!

850
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,300
Stop it! -l'll kill you.

851
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,500
Stop it!

852
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:37,400
Those who respect Cave
and dance come here.

853
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:44,300
This is a stage not
a battlefield.

854
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,400
Come with me.

855
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,300
Vicky!

856
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,400
Rishi!

857
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,300
l'm not a prostitute.
l did this for love.

858
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,300
You can't get the
girl by fighting.

859
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,500
Forget her and move on.

860
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,500
She wronged me!

861
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,400
Everything is fair
in love and war.

862
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,400
And both were involved here.

863
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,500
Sunny told me that you're
thinking of quitting dance.

864
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,500
Can you live without
dance? -Yes.

865
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,300
Do you know what you're
saying? -No.

866
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,400
Control yourself.

867
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,400
At such times if people stumble
they can never stand up again.

868
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,300
What difference does it make?
-lt makes a difference.

869
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,400
To your dreams!

870
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,400
To those people who
trust your dreams!

871
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,400
The time to dream has gone
by, brother Palash!

872
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,300
Not it's time to wake up.

873
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,400
How long.. How long will
l keep on sleeping?

874
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,500
Where is that old man?
Your brother?

875
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,400
He isn't home. -Really?

876
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,300
How is he?

877
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,300

What are you doing,
Viraat? -Shut up.

972
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:08,400
Don't you want to return
Jangla's money.

973
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,400
Brother, now you can't even run.

l need some time.

996
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,200
Fool!

997
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,300
You're really unique.

998
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,400
lf you had worked here, you
would've made me proud.

999
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,300
Ok, l give you one month.

1000

and your brother-in-law.

1002
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,400
Take this lame home.

1003
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,400
What should l do with the money?

1004
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,400
What? Keep it in the locker.
Stupid old man!

1005
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:11,300
lf not yourself, let
your leg rest. Sit.

1006
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,400
You borrowed money from
Jangla. -You know him.

1007
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,400
He's my old buddy.

1008
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:32,400
We've even shot at each
other once or twice.

1009
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,400
Those were the days..

1010
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:49,300
Tell me, are you enjoying
ruining your life.

1011
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,300
Forget it, Brother Palash.

1012

lt's my life. l can wash
it down the drain.

1013
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,300
lt won't make any difference.

1014
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,400
Many years ago, someone had
said the same thing.

1015
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:12,300
He came to become a dancer,
but became a gangster.

1016
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,500
He used to say, my
life is my talent.

1017
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,300
But in a few years, he lost
his true identity.

1018
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,300
He made Cave to save himself.

1019
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,400
l am not like you,
brother Palash.

1020
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,500
Brother, Seema had phoned today.

1021
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,300
She said we've achieved
our target.

1022
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,300
Really, Sunny has helpled
us so much that..

1023
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,300
How is Sunny?

1024
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,200
How is your dance going on?

1025
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,300
Brother, don't taunt.

01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,400
l'm trying to adjust. Don't
make it impossible for me.

01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,400
Don't adjust. l've given
your hostel fee.

01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,400
Go and stay there.

l didn't hurt you on purpose.

1030
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,300
But now you're doing
this on purpose.

01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,300
Don't let your dreams shatter.

1055
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,500
Very few have true talent.

1056
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:36,400
You've no right to
waste your talent.

1057
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,500
You want to quit dance.
Ok, do it.

1058
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,400
But not like a loser.

1059
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,500
Win and show the world
what you can do.

1060
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,300
Rehearse the second part again.

1061
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:11,400
lt isn't right. lt's going
out of the way.

1062
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,400
Yes, pal.. -Dandiya.

1063
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:19,400
Sunny, you and Rishi.. Why
don't you end your drama?

1064
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,400
Competition is right
at the corner.

1065
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,300
l'm not doing anything.

1066
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:29,400
Who was flirting with his
sister? -l love her, Viraat.

1067
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,400
You've a bad reputation.

1068
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:37,400
We've to unite to
win Fast Forward.

1069
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,400
And Sunny, it's important
for us to win..

1070
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,500
..or else Jangla won't
spare Rishi.

1071
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,500
l'll call him now.

1072
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,200
Forget it. We lost because
of him last time.

1073
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,500
Don't you remember. -Don't
talk rubbish.

1074
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:57,300
l'm not. -We're all friends.
Don't forget it.

1075
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,400
He won't come.

1076
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,300
We'll win.

1077
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,400
We'll win for him.

1078
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,400
5. 6. 7. 8. 1. 2.

1079
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,200
Nice, guys. -Great.

1080
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,300
Take a break. -Good!

1081
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,500
show me the 6 step. -Vicky.

1082
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,300
Do you think Zeroes will
participate in Fast Forward?

1083
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:32,400
lt's strange! l've even
divided zeroes. - Brilliant!

1084
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:36,400
You would've got a Nobel prize
if you were a mathematician.

1085
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,300
Yes, but you wouldn't
have got me.

1086
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,500
But Rishi is there for you.

1087
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:48,300
Vicky, if you mention him again,
l swear l'll kill you.

1088
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,300
Rishi. -l'll kill you.

1089
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:57,300
Killing me softly.
Killing me softly.

1090
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,400
With these words. Killing
me softly.

1091
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,300
With this song. Killing
me softly.

1092
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,400
Vicky. - Softly.

1093
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,300
Shall we rehearse.

1094
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:15,400
And listen, if we lose
then l promise..

1095
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,300
..l'll dump you.

1096
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,300
But l won't let it happen.

1097
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,300
Because l've hidden
a secret weapon.

1098
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,300
l still have an ace
in my sleeves.

1099
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:49,400
Take this, brother. We
don't need them now.

1100
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,400
l can give you 60 rupees.

1101
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:32,500
Brother, wait a minute.

1102
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:46,400
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

1103
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,300
1. 2. 3.

1104
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,400
Dandiya, don't do folk dance.

1105
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,400
3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

1106
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:02,300
And 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

1107
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,400
And 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. -Look, Rishi.

1108
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:09,400
How are you? -What's up, man?

1109
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,400
l knew you would come.

1110
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,400
Rishi. -Where have
you been, man?

1111
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:17,400
Leave me, Sunny!

1112
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,400
Leave me, Sunny!

1113
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,400
l'm participating
in Fast Forward.

1114
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:36,300
Those of you who think
l'll win, join me.

1115
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,500
What are you saying, Rishi?

1116
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,400
We've always danced together.

1117
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,300
We were friends them.

1118
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:51,200
Let's discuss it. Everything
will be sorted out.

1119
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,400
What? What will you do?

1120
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,400
Look, Rishi. Don't split
the group. Don't do it.

1121
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:07,300
l'm not. Those who have to
come, will surely come.

1122
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,400
Rishi, now that you've
challenged..

1123
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:43,300
..now look, you won't
win Fast Forward.

1124
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,300
l'll teach you dance.

1125
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:27,200
There is vigor and passion
in my heart.

1126
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:30,300
A desire is kindled within me.

1127
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,400
There is fire in the veins.

1128
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:38,300
The world will notice
me today.

1129
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,400
Don't stop us.

1130
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:07,500
The world will follow you.

Touch the sky.

1132
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,400
Overcome all the hurdles.

1133
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,400
Dance with the stars.

1134
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:31,400
Float on the waves and
break all limits.

1135
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:38,400
Run faster than time
and enjoy your life.

1136
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,400
Rock tonigh.

1137
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:43,500
Baby, if we could just
rock tonight.

1138
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,500
Take it high.

l want to see you fight.

1142
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,400
Those performances were
absolutely wow.

1143
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:39,200
Now which six team will
be in the final..

1144
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,300
..round from the elimination
round?

1145

Let us sing song in

Relish the moment
with open heart.

1162

He was going so well.
-What happened, man?

Oh no!

1165
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,400

1166
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,300
..slipped on dance floor today.

1167
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,400
He has no chance.

This is our world.

1169
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,400
This is the gesture of time.

1170
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:14,400
Let the stars descend
on earth.

1171
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,300
Ok. Ok. Ok.

1172
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,300

There are no rules here..
-Nor any judge.

1188
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:40,400
My part is over now.

1189
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:46,400
Why did you do this, Sunny?

1190
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,300
l'm happy go lucky.

1191
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:54,300
These are Rishi's dreams.

1192
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,400
This award is important for him.

1193
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:02,400
And he's my friend.

1194
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:11,400
Why are you so good?

1195
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:20,300
l.. l am sorry.

1196
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,300
Then return to me.

1197
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:25,400
Kid, where are you
for so many days?

1198
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,500
You'll get your money
within half an hour.

1199
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:31,400
l heard you're leaving the city.

1200
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:36,400
Your plan is to flee with
the prize money.

1201
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:40,300
Who told you that? -What
difference does it make?

1202
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:44,400
lsn't it true? -Just give me
half an hour, Mr. Jangla.

1203
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,300
l won't flee.

1204
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,400
You won't flee. Your dead
body will lie here.

1205
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,200
lt'll be good for our business.

1206
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,300
lt's called.. free publicity.

1207
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:57,300
Jangla. Jangla.

1208
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:02,300
Won't you hug me? We're
old friends.

1209
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,300
Where were you for so
many years, Palash?

1210
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:11,200
l knew we'll meet again.

1211
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:15,300
First you plundered me, now
you're bothering these kids.

1212
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,300
You haven't reformed.

1213
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,300
He wants some time.
Give it to him.

1214
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:23,400
He's a cute kid.

1215
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,500
But he hasn't settle old dues.

1216
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,500
How can l give him
something more?

1217
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,500
But l'm happy to meet you.

1218
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:36,300
l'm sad because you won't
be seen again.

1219
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:39,400
Don't declare the result before
the start of the competition.

1220
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,300
lt's time. You may go.

1221
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,400
Let's go.

1222
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,400
Some like love. What
you got to do?

1223
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,400
lf you got the shoes,
then hear the tricks.

1224
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,300
