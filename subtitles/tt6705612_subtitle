1
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,708
Dongra!

2
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,041
Dongra, come out for cruel monster.

3
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:37,958
Jatt Jeona Morh is here
to fulfill his promise to Rano.

4
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:43,041
Love makes Jatts go crazy.

5
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,125
Will you come out now,

6
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:49,583
Or will you stay inside
and keep barking like a dog?

7
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:55,541
I am already here. If you want,
I can make an entrance, again.

8
00:01:55,625 --> 00:02:00,083
And forget barking,
I didn't say a word.

9
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,666
I want Rano.

10
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,958
I want 10,000.

11
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:11,250
You get girls married,
you don't sell them, you frog.

12
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,333
I want 10,000.

13
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,083
I want Rano.

14
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,166
I want 10,000.

15
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,125
I want Rano.

16
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,583
I want Rano!
Yeah, Rano, right!

17
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:27,750
First give me 10,000
rupees you got from the RPO.

18
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,458
-Dongra!
-What?

19
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,291
Sometimes, I feel like
I've given birth to Guggu Gill.

20
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,125
I feel like breaking your VCR.

21
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,541
And I also feel like breaking
the legs of my useless son.

22
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,625
Father! Don't break the VCR,
you can break my legs if you want.

23
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,125
I made a mistake. Please forgive me.

24
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,291
Father!

25
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,750
You will not be forgiven.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,791
I thought you spent the money.

27
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,666
But you slept with the
money in your pocket.

28
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,083
You didn't even lock the door?

29
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,500
What's the use when
everyone will know?

30
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,666
You lock the door when you are drunk.

31
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,875
-But I drink every day.
-The door is locked...

32
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,291
-You Dum.
-Mummy!

33
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,041
That's enough.

34
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,000
We had decided on one slap a day.
You have already slapped him once.

35
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,583
Get ready, Sukhi.
It's time for you to go to college.

36
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,583
Say that it's time to waste petrol.

37
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,958
What will you take to shut up?

38
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:20,958
Give me this tea.

39
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,375
But mummy, you'd said that
you wanted to go to the market today.

40
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,291
Oh, yes. I needed to buy some clothes.

41
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,208
Sukhi, we need to buy
some clothes for Bholi too.

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,666
Do you want anything?

43
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,958
-Yes..
-What?

44
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,166
Slippers.

45
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,666
<i>This is like hitting a jackpot.</i>

46
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,333
<i>It's always very good
to help your mother.</i>

47
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,875
<i>I swear on God.</i>

48
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,833
<i>I'll never say no to mother again.</i>

49
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,041
<i>Are they fine?</i>

50
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,875
Show me a ten number size slipper.

51
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,208
That doesn't seem
like your size, ma'am.

52
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,375
It's for my father.

53
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,708
-Yes.
-Show it to her.

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,250
<i>Great print on the dress.</i>

55
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,291
<i>She is looking very nice today.</i>

56
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:18,916
<i>What kind do you want?</i>

57
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,249
Show one with great print on it.

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,750
<i>How many meters?</i>

59
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,541
What?

60
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,916
Brother, slippers have designs.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,500
I know. Dresses have prints on them.

62
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,416
What happened, ma'am? You didn't like
it? Shall I show you something else?

63
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,458
I usually don't get things
of my liking in a local market.

64
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:42,250
Why do I feel as if
she didn't say that to me?

65
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,000
You should concentrate
on selling slippers...

66
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,666
and not the ways you
get beaten by them. Understood?

67
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,250
Mummy, I will be right back.

68
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,708
Son, you are the one
who gets beaten by it.

69
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,250
Come back and choose
them for your father.

70
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,875
I'd suggest you buy a size bigger.
It's not working on him.

71
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,791
What are you saying?

72
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,708
Yes, Guddi. How are you?

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,916
Okay. Yes, Bhupinder said
that she posted a letter.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,083
There's a wedding
invite in it as well.

75
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,916
It will take some time
for it to reach America.

76
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,000
Seems like his motorcycle
has broken down.

77
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,375
His motorcycle has not broken down.

78
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,041
His intentions have gone bad.

79
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,833
Move aside.

80
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,708
He will first check the plug.

81
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,875
Yes.

82
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,083
I too have come to buy
some things for Bhupinder.

83
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,416
Now he will open the tank.

84
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,500
Amazing.

85
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go. The shop might close down.

86
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,707
Now he will shake
it to check the petrol.

87
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:00,832
Saw that?

88
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,875
Okay, bye.

89
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,875
I know you cannot come
back from America so soon...

90
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,916
but do write a letter to Bhupinder.

91
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,666
She will like it.

92
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,750
How much?

93
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,125
Brother, try kick starting it.
It works sometimes.

94
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,291
It worked.

95
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,666
Hey brother!

96
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,500
Hey brother!

97
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:43,875
What?

98
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:48,125
Race it properly. Bullet sometimes
manages to go ahead of rickshaws.

99
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,791
Get lost.

100
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,625
Get lost, you pervert.

101
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,166
Sukhi! Stop! Let me get down.

102
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,541
Where were you?

103
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,666
I was looking at you at the shoes shop.

104
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,458
Shoes shop? You never came back.
I have been waiting for you there.

105
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,291
I had words with him.

106
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,208
You take this.

107
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,250
-Give me.
-Get on it.

108
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:11,333
-I was waiting for you to come pick me up.
-Sit quickly. Hurry up.

109
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,416
Let's go.

110
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,041
She didn't pay me.

111
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,707
Go slow.

112
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,957
It's okay. I am going slow.

113
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,625
Today the layers aren't clear
even after trying for the third time.

114
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,041
The one who shows up on the mirror and
says that the layers aren't clear...

115
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,957
you should first go
and clear things out with her.

116
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,500
The layers of the turban
will get cleared on their own.

117
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,500
I didn't get you.

118
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,375
Behave yourself, Sukhi.

119
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,500
The way you acted like a roadside
Romeo by following that rickshaw..

120
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,708
It's of no use.

121
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,832
People from the market
came to tell me about it.

122
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,250
My motorcycle has broken down.

123
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,791
Behave yourself.

124
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,957
If a girl's family
decides to break you down...

125
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,625
it's not something
you'll ever forget.

126
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,500
Your sister Bholi is getting married.

127
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,041
Leave for your mother's
maternal home tomorrow.

128
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,083
And keep the lover boy inside
you in control for a few days.

129
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,707
<i>"A beautiful girl..."</i>

130
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,666
How are you, Sukhi?

131
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,832
-Great.
-Did you trap any girl or not?

132
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,250
You trap birds.

133
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,625
You have to love a girl
and keep her in your heart.

134
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,666
Oh really?

135
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,291
-Yes.
-You have a lot to say.

136
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,083
I know a lot of curses too.

137
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,375
If I start like a 90 minute cassette
then we'll be spending the night here.

138
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,333
Right?

139
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,083
Did you record my songs?

140
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,666
Sukhi had taken Chamkela songs.

141
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,916
Now I'll get to hear
them all night long.

142
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,916
<i>"A beautiful girl rejected me."</i>

143
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:37,374
"I get drunk..." How
are you doing, daddy?

144
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,249
-Sukhi?
-Yes?

145
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:40,457
Come here.

146
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,124
Yes?

147
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:46,958
You know Sukhi...
why I came back from Germany?

148
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,458
Yes, for us.

149
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,291
No, wrong, incorrect.

150
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,708
Ten years.

151
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,000
More than ten years.

152
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,875
I worked hard for ten years.
For whom?

153
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,750
I know, daddy. This isn't the
first time you are telling me that.

154
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,875
You came back from Germany
right? when I returned after...

155
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,415
completing my high school
from mother's maternal village.

156
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,125
You say the same thing every
night from that day onwards.

157
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,708
-"A beautiful girl..."
-I'll tell you what's beautiful.

158
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,666
You should romance
like the police raids.

159
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,166
Quietly.

160
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:30,290
But I am only playing
a one sided match.

161
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,958
The other team doesn't
even know whether I am playing.

162
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,291
Tell her then. Make her know.
Listen...

163
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:44,041
Love, worship, faithfulness,
determination and defects...

164
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,333
They require courage.

165
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,708
-One thing more.
-Wait a minute.Let me memorize this first.

166
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:56,790
Love, worship, faithfulness,
determination and defects.

167
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,415
What do they require?

168
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,166
They require courage.

169
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,333
-They require courage.
-Sukhi.

170
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,041
-Yes, mummy? -Go to sleep. You have
to go to your uncle's place tomorrow.

171
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,541
Okay mummy, I am coming.

172
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,208
Okay mummy, I am going.

173
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,708
Son, tell your uncle that we'll
come once when festivities begin.

174
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,166
Okay.

175
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,375
Don't drink alcohol over there.

176
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,665
One's girl, alcohol and
songs always depend on your taste.

177
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,833
-Hear that.
-It's okay. Bye.

178
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:31,000
<i>"Wearing a rustic garb, I'll sit on a
Bullet and keep my moustaches sharp."</i>

179
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:41,208
<i>"Wearing a rustic garb, I'll sit on a
Bullet and keep my moustaches sharp."</i>

180
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,125
<i>"Let people talk."</i>

181
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,708
<i>"This is how..."</i>

182
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,041
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

183
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,333
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

184
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,665
<i>"Let people talk."</i>

185
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,708
<i>"This is how..."</i>

186
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

187
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,625
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

188
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:16,541
<i>"Wearing a rustic garb, I'll sit on a
Bullet and keep my moustaches sharp."</i>

189
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,540
<i>"Whenever a boy becomes a man..."</i>

190
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,625
<i>"He manages to surprise many."</i>

191
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,458
<i>"Whenever a boy becomes a man..."</i>

192
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,833
<i>"He manages to surprise many."</i>

193
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,041
<i>"We survive on our own."</i>

194
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,791
<i>"Fire only destroys."</i>

195
00:11:53,875 --> 00:12:00,041
<i>"Those who think evil let them think.
I don't worry."</i>

196
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,083
<i>"Let people talk."</i>

197
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,458
<i>"This is how..."</i>

198
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,665
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

199
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,583
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

200
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,790
<i>"Let people talk."</i>

201
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,291
<i>"This is how..."</i>

202
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,541
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,750
<i>"I shall behave."</i>

204
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:33,666
<i>"Wearing a rustic garb, I'll sit on a
Bullet and keep my moustaches sharp."</i>

205
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,375
These painters are useless.

206
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,915
They have tied ropes at many
places and they forgot to paint.

207
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,375
They didn't do a good job.

208
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,833
Yes.

209
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,750
You are right.
It's okay. God sees everything.

210
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,500
I don't know when your God will see.

211
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,415
When they will come to ask for money,
they will surely see my palm.

212
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,250
Oh my, my brave boys are here.

213
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,375
Did you get the wheat floured?

214
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,625
You know us, uncle.

215
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,875
We finish whatever we take up.

216
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,500
-Right, Shyamu?
-Yes.

217
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,000
Go and make some tea for them.

218
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,833
Shall I make a special
drink for them...

219
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,750
with saffron and almonds
in it for these officers?

220
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,665
Yes, that would be great.

221
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,250
Also get something to eat.
I am starving.

222
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,625
Don't you have any shame?
I had informed Siti a month ago.

223
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,333
You two were supposed
to be here yesterday.

224
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,500
But you have come here now.

225
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,165
Ma'am, but we got free from
the Lambar's place just this morning.

226
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,125
-Right.
-Don't lie.

227
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,083
You got free day before yesterday.
They informed me.

228
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,458
-Right, Bholi's father?
-Yes.

229
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,833
It's okay. God sees everything.

230
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,250
Now if you two go anywhere
before our daughter gets married...

231
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,875
then I will be your worst enemy.
Let me warn you.

232
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,208
No, aunt. Siti won't go anywhere now.

233
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,583
-Dokla, come here.
-Yes.

234
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,958
Hold this cycle and
help Shyamu to unload.

235
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,041
Okay.

236
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,166
I'll tell Siti...

237
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,083
what's in what and what's in what.

238
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,583
What's in what?

239
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,541
That's in that. That's in that.

240
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,958
Come on.

241
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,041
Wonderful. Very good.

242
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,833
Welcome, nephew. Come here.
I've been waiting for you.

243
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,500
Now there will be no problems.

244
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,083
-Bholi, dear.
-Yes.

245
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,791
Look Sukhi is here!

246
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,291
Bholi, the brat!

247
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,875
Sukhi, the rat!

248
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,125
It's time to take the bat.

249
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,375
Sukhi will bell the cat.

250
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,125
You started right after he came.

251
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,458
How about giving him
something to eat first?

252
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,083
-I seek your blessings, uncle.
-How are you doing, nephew?

253
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,625
I am feeling a little weak.

254
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:45,208
I'll get fed good stuff
here and be strong again.

255
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:52,458
Some people love to swank.

256
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,750
I had twisted your wings last time.
I think you forgot, Tota(parrot).

257
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,290
Brother,
I was a little weak back then.

258
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,208
Don't touch my tail this time.

259
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,625
Have you got your tail transferred?

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,916
Drop it, Tota. Stop blabbering.
Take his bags inside.

261
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,750
Uncle, I think I
am the first one here.

262
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,665
What did you get for me from Ludhiana?

263
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,833
Come with me, I'll show you.

264
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,290
Is this all you brought for me,
brother?

265
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,000
Out of this only a few things
belong to you the rest is for Guddi.

266
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,750
Oh really. Aunt has said
so many things for Guddi's wedding.

267
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,915
And Guddi won't even
look at these things.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,500
It is not good to be so greedy.

269
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,665
Mummy will get more things for you.

270
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,375
She has spoken to the scrap dealer.
I brought these from small shops.

271
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,541
"I brought these from small shops."
He thinks he is great.

272
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,708
It's not like they adopted me.

273
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:45,291
Aunt often says that she found you
when she had gone to throw rubbish.

274
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,708
-Wait, I'll show you. Wait! Stop!
-Bholi!

275
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,541
I still haven't even
started cooking yet...

276
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,625
and you are already
settling the score?

277
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,833
Keep this as an advance, Sadhu.

278
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:05,333
If I take this as an advance then the
final settlement will be a child's play.

279
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,750
Actually Bholi heard
what happened at Salam.

280
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,875
A daughter's slipper
washes off all your sins.

281
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,165
And don't you dare
talk to me about it.

282
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,416
I'll hit you and
break your skull open.

283
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,208
I had once hit your
father with a spatula...

284
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,500
it had hurt him for three years.

285
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,583
Sadhu, you...

286
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,541
You were just a kid. You don't know.

287
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,791
"You were just a kid!"
The great confectioner, Sadhu!

288
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,500
Sadhu, how about getting to business?

289
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,665
You will keep fighting
for the days to come.

290
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,416
You are great. You have come alone.

291
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,458
I am not alone. Chhotu is with me.

292
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,125
Chhotu!
Where did you fell and die?

293
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,000
You die only once, father.

294
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,291
Greetings!

295
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,750
And I fell for Hema Malini.

296
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,040
I don't know how I got stuck with you.

297
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,541
And Dharamender took her away.

298
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,041
I will punch you.
Have you been to Bombay again?

299
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,708
Don't mention Bombay in front of me.

300
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,958
My body catches fire.

301
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,916
I'll extinguish the fire!

302
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,165
"My body catches fire."

303
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:06,915
Father...

304
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,041
Why are you embarrassing
your child in front of an audience?

305
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:13,415
Okay, this reminds me, we will
set up the kitchen in the backyard.

306
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,790
No, you will set up the kitchen here.
Over there.

307
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:17,790
Who is the confectioner, you or me?

308
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:20,374
You are the confectioner, we didn't
ask you to come here brew liquor.

309
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,790
But I am shouldering all the
responsibilities of this wedding.

310
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,749
-Hence...
-Do as my nephew says.

311
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,583
Understood? I am yet to give
two invites. I'll go and give them.

312
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,916
I am anyway going to meet Seetha.

313
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,832
This is the boundary, you wretch.

314
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,625
Try crossing it. Then you
will know what I am made up of.

315
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,708
Tell me!

316
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,583
Trying to act smart with me?

317
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,707
Here, try coming here,
I'll break your bones.

318
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,791
Sukhi.

319
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,041
Sukhi... you are safe
because Sukhi has come.

320
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,375
Otherwise,
you would know what I am made up of.

321
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,583
Coming, brother.

322
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:08,750
How stupid of my father for
marrying me to this bantam.

323
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,791
How are you, Sukhi?

324
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,333
I am fine. Tell me,
have you had enough for lunch?

325
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,583
No, I was feeling restless.

326
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,832
That's why I was keeping
myself busy with your sister-in-law.

327
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,582
-You know..
-What Seetha is made up of.

328
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,958
Who can ever be like
you and Jagga Jatt, Seetha?

329
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,000
Jagga Jatt died a brave death.

330
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,000
And you shall one day get buried
by sister-in-law in the courtyard.

331
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,958
Okay, what's the day today?

332
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,000
Day? It's Thursday.

333
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,166
Thursday?

334
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,208
Okay, I can drink on Thursday.

335
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,375
-Call Chaddar.
-You are too much.

336
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,458
Chaddar!
Sukhi is here!

337
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,457
Today we will celebrate
Sunday on a Thursday. Come over.

338
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,207
Like minutes.
Years went by like minutes.

339
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:58,125
For you maybe, but for
me every minute is like a year.

340
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,541
You joined college and I got married.

341
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:03,916
I wonder who it is.

342
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,958
Isn't that uncle Jailu?

343
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,875
-Yes, it's him.
-Hello, uncle Jailu.

344
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,750
Hello, son.

345
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,625
Who is it?

346
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,583
It's me, Khetawale
Jindhar's nephew, Sukhi.

347
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,375
Wonderful.

348
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,208
You have come after a long time.

349
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,208
Tell me, are you still
studying or are you done?

350
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,791
Uncle, I am in the
last year of graduation.

351
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,375
-Graduation means..
-What are you calculating?

352
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,333
-15th grade, uncle.
-What did you say?

353
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,375
I am your mother's brother-in-law.

354
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,500
He calls me uncle because of you.

355
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,125
You left after doing
your high school here...

356
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,957
but everyone still calls me uncle.

357
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,957
He is the one gave
Chaddar his nickname.

358
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,250
What else could I do?

359
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,041
Whenever teacher asked
him to sing a song...

360
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,583
he used to sing
the same song every time.

361
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,707
<i>"I was embroidering
the bed sheet with motifs..."</i>

362
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:05,541
He made such motifs
that the bed sheet tore off.

363
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,958
What else name could
we have given him?

364
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,957
-But whatever it is,
you have to hear this. -Yes.

365
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,332
-Uncle, you have to hear this.
-What?

366
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,250
Those days are hard to forget.

367
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,500
Sukhi, I too never forgot you.

368
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,208
That's why you send
me a letter every day.

369
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,541
Letters will disappear.

370
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,958
Soon there will be a system
wherein here you write a letter...

371
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,332
and there someone
will get it right away.

372
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,416
He is drunk.
He has started blabbering.

373
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,000
That reminds me,
why don't you have a drink?

374
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,041
No, I have stopped drinking.

375
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,333
He cannot digest it. He loses
my senses after getting drunk.

376
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,875
When did I hurt you after getting drunk?

377
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,250
-Uncle, come and have dinner.
-Dinner?

378
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,750
It will get cold.

379
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,708
Coming, dear! Coming!

380
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,291
-Seetha, who was that talking?
-Then you'll say that I talk!

381
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:58,333
Tell me once and for all how
long will your nonsense continue?

382
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,625
Do you want to have dinner
or should I give it to the dogs?

383
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:05,625
I'll eat on my own.
You can go to sleep, Pasho!

384
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,791
She has always skinned you alive.
What else do you want her to do?

385
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,750
-Shall we go then?
-No.

386
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:17,875
-Your sister-in-law will nag.
-Let her, we will sing.

387
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,500
-No.
-Here we go..

388
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,583
Yes.

389
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,208
I'll sing in tune.

390
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:28,166
<i>"He had gone out for 12 years,
he came back with friendship..."</i>

391
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,625
Chhotu, work fast.
What are you doing? Show some stamina.

392
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,250
I am doing it.
I cannot become food, can I?

393
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,791
Uncle, you be in command
till the wedding isn't over.

394
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,958
Just sit on a chair and bark orders.

395
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,250
You don't need to
do unnecessary things.

396
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,583
God bless you, nephew.

397
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,666
If I sit, who will gather
cots and mattresses for the wedding?

398
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,583
I'll gather cots and mattresses.

399
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,707
Anyway, it's not a wedding, till
you don't gather cots and mattresses.

400
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,750
Come.
You are late. Where were you?

401
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,541
Chaddar's scooter was
running on empty tank.

402
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,875
-On reserve.
-Yes.

403
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,916
Saying that won't fill the tank.

404
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,250
Siti, come to the kitchen with me.
I'll tell you what's in what.

405
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,833
Quietly go away from here.
Don't make me give you something else.

406
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,125
Can't you see that
she is filling water?

407
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,666
It's okay, Shyama will fill the water.

408
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,916
Look, the marriage broker has come.

409
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,541
Not the marriage broker,
the nonstop speaker.

410
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,375
Careful, Daddy!
There's no one like you.

411
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,083
If I had got to do your father marriage..

412
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,832
-there would have been
no one like you either. -Really?

413
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,666
Your wedding will
also be fixed by Daddy.

414
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,500
-Hello, Jindhar Singh.
How are you? -Good.

415
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,208
-I know him.
You are Shamsher's son. -Yes.

416
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,500
You know you are supposed to greet?
God is very miraculous.

417
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,833
You never know who gets
linked to whom and when.

418
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,207
Come here and hold the scooter.
I am known as Daddy.

419
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,875
-Ask me why. Jindhar Singh,
I met Bholi's in-laws. -Okay.

420
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,791
They said that there will
be 60 to 70 guests at the wedding.

421
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,291
They asked me to find
out if you had an objection.

422
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,250
I said there will be no objection.
Jindhar Singh has no objection.

423
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,208
You can even get 80 guests.

424
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,875
They have asked to serve
meat during the wedding.

425
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,250
I said we will also serve fish
and liquor too. It's not a big deal.

426
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,625
You were asking why am I called Daddy.

427
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:18,500
In the village, I was the
first one to call my father daddy.

428
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,083
I called him daddy and the whole
village started calling me daddy.

429
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,750
That's why I got the whole
world married but I am still single.

430
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,000
When I was about to get married...

431
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,208
the kids at the wedding
started calling me daddy.

432
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,832
The bride's family got suspicious.

433
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,707
They thought that
I am already married.

434
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,916
They threw me out
while I was having tea.

435
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,291
I'll be fixing your wedding as well.

436
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,541
I know a girl suitable
for you as well from Mansa.

437
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:44,166
-She flunked the eighth grade,
but her family is rich. -Okay.

438
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:49,416
Son, I have even got illiterate
married to literate ones.

439
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:54,333
I can break alliances
and fix broken ones.

440
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,041
They call me Daddy for a reason.

441
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,750
Don't ask me again why I am called so.
Let go the scooter now.

442
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,000
Let go of it.

443
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:06,083
This reminds me, Jindhar Singh they
said to buy Sardahi color scooter.

444
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,791
-Scooter? -Sardahi color
is in fashion these days.

445
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,708
As for the rest,
alcohol, I have already told you.

446
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,625
Arrange for other cold and hot drinks
as well. Some don't drink alcohol.

447
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,625
There should not be anything
amiss while serving me.

448
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,416
-How about some tea?
-No, thank you.

449
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,957
As for the rest, God will have mercy.

450
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Daddy cannot do everything.

451
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,375
God too does some things, right?

452
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,500
God sees everything. Okay.

453
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,375
Chhotu!

454
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,916
Where are you?

455
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,166
Sadhu, you are going very slow.

456
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,833
Do you want to me run using coal?

457
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,166
If this continues,
not even the sweets will be...

458
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,625
ready till the time guests come.

459
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:47,958
Jindhar, you don't know, when I was
young I managed 15 weddings at one go.

460
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,000
Stop bluffing.

461
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,583
You don't know.
You were just a kid back then.

462
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,207
I was just a kid? Come in.

463
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,500
Take one of the things inside.

464
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,250
You are just standing
there and doing your hair.

465
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:14,750
Why are you carrying such
a heavy thing? Your back will hurt.

466
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:18,416
Take the packet of cardamoms instead.

467
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,333
Will you manage to lift
it or should I help you?

468
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,375
-Okay, help me.
-Damn you.

469
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,541
It is not right to be so arrogant, father.

470
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,416
If I get angry,
I'll chop off both your hands...

471
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,916
and make you the
Thakur in the movie Sholay.

472
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,583
You will get angry when you
will get angry. I am already angry.

473
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:39,000
If I don't make you forget your movies
today, then I am not your father.

474
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,875
Don't hit me, father.

475
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,833
I'll call you uncle.

476
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:49,707
Oh God, did I offer you raw
sweets that you gave me noodle.

477
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:53,832
Instead of giving birth to you, your
mother should have bought a heater.

478
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,457
It would at least provide
heat during winters.

479
00:25:56,541 --> 00:26:00,832
Will you two just keep talking
here or do some work as well?

480
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,916
Sadhu, what happened in
Salam shouldn't repeat here.

481
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,791
What happened with your
father at the fair was also bad.

482
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:12,083
-His father teased a girl
standing at my shop. -Okay.

483
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:17,541
Then she held her under
knees and forced fed him.

484
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,500
Okay, so we know his father's story.

485
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,625
What happened at Salam, Sadhu?

486
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,833
-There I teased their old lady.
-Shut up.

487
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,916
You don't know.
You were just a kid back then.

488
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,500
I'll tell you what happened at Salam.
Back off.

489
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,500
I'll tell you.

490
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:37,625
-We young boys went to gather
cots and mattresses. -At Salam?

491
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,791
There was no Pakistan back then.

492
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,375
I'll come to the point.

493
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:44,041
Whenever you knock at a
door for cots and mattresses...

494
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,666
you don't leave
that house empty handed.

495
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,583
You should take whatever you get.

496
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,750
You have made your point.
Now get to work.

497
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,708
Okay.

498
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,791
Move aside, you nitwit.

499
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,833
Tota, the one you are
whistling for has already left?

500
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,291
But oh yes, Siti has already left.

501
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:03,416
Sukhi, ask Sadhu to make Chocolate
Barfi for you after we return.

502
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,666
-Why?
-He doesn't know how to.

503
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,375
They were asked to make
Chocolate Barfi at a wedding.

504
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,791
They made a mess out of it.

505
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,375
The groom's brothers-in-law
made him sit on the ice.

506
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,125
They said, take him away.
He has melted.

507
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,375
Tota, lift the sacks.

508
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,875
What's so funny?

509
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:24,500
Chaddar asked me to ask you if
you have seen someone sitting on ice?

510
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:28,125
No, I will teach this Chaddar a lesson.

511
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,833
I am not Sadhu if I let
him stay here for the wedding.

512
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:34,332
It's okay, son.
I'll make you go around like a top.

513
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,541
Tota, throw the sack in and hop on.

514
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,166
We have to go and gather
cots and mattresses.

515
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,875
We also have to pick
up Seetha from the village.

516
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,791
<i>"Get ready, Sukhi!"</i>

517
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:55,833
<i>"Oh, my buddies!"</i>

518
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:05,916
<i>"We use this as an
excuse to go to her house"</i>

519
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,041
<i>"We knock the door and
say we need cots and mattresses"</i>

520
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,041
Grandma, I've come from Jindhar's house.
I need to take the cots and mattresses.

521
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,333
Come in, son.

522
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,541
Come in, boys.

523
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:24,375
<i>"Sukhi, you paint the numbers.
Seetha, you count them"</i>

524
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,707
<i>"It's not a wedding..."</i>

525
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:31,625
<i>"It's not a wedding, till you
don't gather cots and mattresses"</i>

526
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:36,541
<i>"It's not a wedding, till you
don't gather cots and mattresses"</i>

527
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:41,083
<i>"It's not a wedding, till you
don't gather cots and mattresses"</i>

528
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,166
<i>"It's not a wedding..."</i>

529
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,833
Sukhi, they didn't give a bedsheet.

530
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,000
-So what if they didn't.
-Then what will we use?

531
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,958
We will use our Chaddar instead.

532
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,166
Sukhi, he isn't giving us any cots.

533
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,083
Why?

534
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,750
We have only two cots.

535
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,208
My father and me sleep on one.

536
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,000
My mother and my
wife sleep on the other.

537
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:01,582
-Look Kaleja, you are like a
younger brother to us. -Okay.

538
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,500
It's okay, if you don't
want to give cots and mattresses.

539
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,916
-But at least love properly.
-Get lost.

540
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,666
It's okay.
We won't tell Kaleja about Siti.

541
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,250
No, we won't.

542
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,625
Why so?

543
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,541
You can take both the cots,
we will sleep on the ground...

544
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,791
but share the secret with me.

545
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,833
-Go and get the cots first.
-I'll go and get it. It's not a problem.

546
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,000
Write Kaleja's name.

547
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,666
Sukhi, how many more do we need?

548
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,916
We will manage with whatever we get.

549
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,208
Those who don't get cots,
we will get them drunk and pile over.

550
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,375
Here you go, this is what they gave.

551
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,916
The same cot and mattress
had come for my wedding as well.

552
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,875
When it came, my father said...

553
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,125
Seetha, the same had
come at my wedding as well.

554
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,666
-Okay. I'll return
it if you say so. -No.

555
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,416
It's a historic cot.

556
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,250
We have to make brother-in-law
from Nabhe lie somewhere too.

557
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,916
That would be great.

558
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,832
Tota, the cot is walking!

559
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,458
No, Seetha is walking under it.

560
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:18,707
How many times have I told you not to
make him carry a cot all by himself.

561
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,166
-Who will be responsible if he gets
crushed under it? -Give it to me.

562
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,708
Sukhi, at least don't say
such things in front of my wife.

563
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,375
Why are you ruining my reputation?

564
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,833
You too love to get insulted,
don't you?

565
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:30,791
Brother-in-law, this cot and mattresses
came from my maternal home...

566
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,750
don't give it to
someone infested with lice.

567
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,583
Seetha said you had brought
only abuses as dowry, no cots.

568
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,207
Stop your nonsense!
Don't listen to him.

569
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,082
Who needs enemies if
one has friends like you?

570
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,957
You go and cook dinner.
Start driving, Sukhi.

571
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,791
Come home in the evening and
I'll tell you what you got in dowry.

572
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,416
-You start driving.
-We are not in a hurry.

573
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,625
We too should know what
sister-in-law brought as dowry.

574
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:52,916
Shall I make you a list?

575
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,833
<i>I'll tell you at night, just wait.</i>

576
00:30:56,125 --> 00:31:03,125
<i>"She is a spitfire!
He'll have to risk it"</i>

577
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:10,625
<i>"She is a spitfire!
He'll have to risk it"</i>

578
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:15,125
<i>"A trouble named Gudiya
will open the door"</i>

579
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:20,375
<i>"Their new blanket was lost, Meeta!"</i>

580
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:25,041
<i>"It's not a wedding, till you
don't gather cots and mattresses"</i>

581
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:29,916
<i>"It's not a wedding, till you
don't gather cots and mattresses"</i>

582
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,458
<i>"It's not a wedding, till you
don't gather cots and mattresse."</i>

583
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:37,957
<i>"It's not a wedding..."</i>

584
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, get down.

585
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:44,041
Sukhi, let's skip Jailu's house.
His mother is very rude.

586
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,250
The other day I said,
I seek your blessings, grandma...

587
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,708
-She said go ahead,
there isn't anyone at home. -Really?

588
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,332
Jailu is your uncle's best friend.

589
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,957
But you won't get any
cots and mattresses from here.

590
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,625
What are you saying?

591
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,957
Didn't Sadhu say that
you shouldn't return...

592
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,582
empty handed from the house
were you seek cots and mattresses.

593
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,875
I'll go inside.

594
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,125
Go on. You'll meet
the same fate Sadhu had.

595
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:05,250
-It's okay you go.
-He will get himself insulted.

596
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,500
-"I get drunk"
-She's sitting over there.

597
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,750
I seek your blessings, grandma.

598
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,791
Go ahead, there isn't anyone at home.

599
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,958
I am from Jindhar Khetawale's house.
I need cots and mattresses.

600
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,291
My sister Bholi is getting married.

601
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,625
You can take one when Jailu returns.
You anyway have a trolley full of them.

602
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,125
What will you do with so many of them?

603
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:29,957
I'll talk to uncle Jailu. Tell
him that Sukhi had come, he took it.

604
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:33,916
But I told you no one is at home.

605
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,708
Why are you going inside?

606
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,916
Soon you would want something
else from this house.

607
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,250
This one is good. I'll take this one.

608
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,833
Don't touch the cot.

609
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,625
Keep it down.

610
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:13,125
Didn't you hear me?
I said don't touch cot.

611
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,541
Why? Does it gives
electric shock to people?

612
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,125
Keep it down.

613
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:21,166
Granny asked you to come later yet
you just walked inside shamelessly.

614
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,208
Neither uncle nor aunt is at home.

615
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,916
Why did you lift the
cot without permission?

616
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,333
Okay, I'll take your
permission and then lift it.

617
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,000
I am taking the cot. Give
me a mattress to go along with it.

618
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,375
Keep the cot down.

619
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,375
If you want to take one,
take that one.

620
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,041
This one?

621
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:41,625
It's for the relatives
and not to dry snacks over it.

622
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,458
And then it won't look good if
I take the bad one in your presence.

623
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,125
As the elders say...
what did you say your name was?

624
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,375
I didn't tell you my name.

625
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,166
No problem. As the elders say...

626
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,041
You shouldn't let go
of something you really like.

627
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,333
Forget it.

628
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,500
I'll remember it like
the multiples of two.

629
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:00,958
This is the one I'll take along.

630
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,875
It's my sister Bholi's wedding.
It's not a small event.

631
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,416
You are Bholi's brother?

632
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,458
Bhupinder is my friend.

633
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,416
She doesn't have a brother, you liar.

634
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:12,748
Oh, I am her aunt's
son from Phunkhala.

635
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,249
I study at Ludhiana.

636
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,666
<i>I kept following you.</i>

637
00:34:16,748 --> 00:34:19,165
<i>But you don't even recognize me.</i>

638
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:21,415
<i>This roadside Romeo
won't stop following me.</i>

639
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,291
<i>Now he will follow me
even during the wedding.</i>

640
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:27,333
Have you thought of something about
me? You don't need to think twice.

641
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:30,249
Get a great mattress, just like you.

642
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,291
I am a mattress?

643
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:33,540
No, you are great.

644
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,791
I'll give it to you because
you are Bholi's brother.

645
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:40,457
Otherwise, I won't even let
someone like you go past my house.

646
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,458
Great timing to get the mattress.

647
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,791
Take this.
And listen carefully.

648
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:51,873
Better make a good guest
sleep on this cot and mattress.

649
00:34:52,248 --> 00:34:53,165
Understood?

650
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,833
Who can be better than me?

651
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,875
I am the best guest.

652
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:38,750
Now that's one beautiful damsel.

653
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,250
When she walks...

654
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,791
it feels like the barren thirsty
land has been blessed with rain.

655
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:50,541
Both your attitude
and anger are acceptable.

656
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:55,416
I feel happy when I think about you.

657
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,291
Here.

658
00:35:58,666 --> 00:35:59,958
-Are they good?
-Yes

659
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:07,083
So, make me a beautiful snack.
A spicy one, a hot one.

660
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:10,000
A fireball.

661
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,000
I have seen it a number of times...

662
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:14,625
this snack.

663
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,250
I recognized it.

664
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,291
My name is Sukhchan, Sukhchan Gareya.

665
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:25,333
If someone wants, she/he
can affectionately call me Sukhi.

666
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,000
Whoever you are,
brother, there's no snacks left.

667
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,625
You weren't fated to have it.

668
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,458
Really?

669
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:35,291
Ask if anyone is ready to share.
We will split it into two.

670
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:38,041
I told you, you weren't fated to have it.

671
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:41,833
I am fated to have the moon.

672
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:52,500
<i>"Oh my beautiful beloved,
your love has shown its color"</i>

673
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:58,541
<i>"My heart beats to your name"</i>

674
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:03,625
<i>"In my every breath is your name"</i>

675
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:10,833
<i>"I feel you inside me..."</i>

676
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:15,875

714
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,000
-Father...
-Yes.

715
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,208
-The milk is exposed.
-Do you want it to wear knickers?

716
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:28,291
-He talks nonsense. -Uncle, we have
brought the cots and mattresses.

717
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,458
Well done, nephew.

718
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,541
You have done a great job
by getting these cots and mattresses.

719
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,541
This is the most difficult task.

720
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,083
Keep it down.
Keep it down right away.

721
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,041
No one will touch this cot.

722
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,416
Why? Does it give electric shocks?

723
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,541
It doesn't. But I'll surely
slap the one who touches it.

724
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,583
Shall we make more Jalebis?

725
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:46,458
Stop making Jalebis.

726
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,583
Make sure that you
make Chocolate Barfi.

727
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:52,666
Stupid of him. Who demands
Chocolate Barfi in a village?

728
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,500
Only cities want it.

729
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,083
-Aren't I right, Chhotu?
-No one eats it.

730
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,500
Everyone eats it. The groom's
family has made a special demand.

731
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,833
-Right, Sukhi.
-They told you, Tota, the great man.

732
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,500
Siti, make some tea.

733
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,416
Why, what is wrong with your hands?
Why don't you make it?

734
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,000
Can't you see that
she is washing utensils?

735
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,416
You wash the utensils.

736
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,250
Make some more tea.

737
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:13,708
I too want to drink some.

738
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:16,458
Okay, I am here. Tell me
if you want any work to be done.

739
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,708
-You do one thing.
-What?

740
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,125
-Sit on this wall.
-Okay.

741
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,125
And scare the crows away.

742
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,166
We asked you to scare crows away,
not Tota.

743
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,708
Tota will fly away with Siti.

744
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,166
Don't make me break your peck.

745
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,666
Give me records of all cots
and mattresses. I'll keep it safe.

746
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,166
Hello, everyone, please listen to me.

747
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,541
Hello, everyone! Please listen to me.

748
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:39,500
I don't want any commotion.
I want everything to run smoothly.

749
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,250
Do you understand or shall I explain?

750
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,958
How are you, Sintal.
Why are you causing a commotion?

751
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,958
Seetha, get this straight.
Be polite with me. Got it?

752
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,666
Here, I am your brother-in-law.

753
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,541
Don't try to act smart
in front of your buddies, got it?

754
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,625
Do you understand or shall I explain?

755
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:57,250
Yes, don't address him as Sintal.

756
00:41:57,333 --> 00:42:01,041
I agree that your mother's
maternal home was neighboring his.

757
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,416
Here no one will
address him as Sintal.

758
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,958
I will be their worst enemy.

759
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:07,666
-Right, Sintal?
I mean brother-in-law? -Sukhi!

760
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,958
You are telling everyone, man!

761
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,708
You better cover the Jalebis
before they get infested.

762
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,208
We will give you other things to
cover. You first make Chocolate Barfi.

763
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,791
There are still a
lot of things to be made.

764
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,500
Shall we call for ice?

765
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:24,125
Why are you talking about ice,
we are talking about Barfi here.

766
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:29,375
Chaddar, do me a favor get the
equipments from the cot, I need them.

767
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,625
Chaddar, the speaker
installer isn't here as yet!

768
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,041
I wonder where he is!

769
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:37,833
Chaddar, get me some snacks. I'll
have a drink and get into the mood.

770
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,166
Also get some wood.

771
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,833
Chaddar, get me spice box from there.

772
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:45,458
Chaddar! Go and get the
drums from the Gurudwara.

773
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,291
Chaddar, help me with this work.

774
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:50,750
I'll teach everyone a lesson.

775
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:58,625
Brother Chaddar, also tell
all families to come to dance.

776
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:01,541
Don't forget to go
to uncle Jailu's house.

777
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,791
Ranjeet,
my friend, uncle Jailu's niece...

778
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,958
Tell her Bhupinder will
get upset if she doesn't show up.

779
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,208
He won't be doing
so many things anyway.

780
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,791
He will get the drums.

781
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:15,833
-I'll pass your message to Ranjeet.
-Okay, brother.

782
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,875
Why are you all staring at me?

783
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:19,458
Okay, we will both go there.

784
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,250
You set the cots.

785
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:22,500
"We will both go there!"

786
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,291
Who will do all the work,
our brother-in-law from Nabhe?

787
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,791
Did you say something to me?

788
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:28,125
Yes, brother-in-law.
They are all shying away from work.

789
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,500
Make sure they work.

790
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:32,916
Why aren't you all working?
Have you come from Bombay?

791
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,833
Don't mention Bombay in front of me.

792
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:38,541
My body catches fire.

793
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,458
Grandma, I'll seek blessings
if anyone is at home.

794
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,375
Again you came?

795
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,833
I'll keep coming now.

796
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Hello, aunt.

797
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:57,333
-Bless you.
-Hey, hello.

798
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:00,166
Such a friendly girl!
He's who? Who is she?

799
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,000
-She is our niece Rano.
-Rano!

800
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,416
-But who are you?
-You didn't recognize me?

801
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,750
I am Sukhi, Sukhchan Gareya.
Khetawale Jindhar's nephew Phunkhala.

802
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,500
Oh come on.
I am the only child of my parents.

803
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,166
Oh great. I hadn't recognized you.

804
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,208
I didn't recognize you either.

805
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:19,791
You were this small
when I last saw you.

806
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:22,458
No, no, no, grandma.
Make me at least a little bigger.

807
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,125
With God's grace, you look good.

808
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,500
I was fed at my
mother's maternal place.

809
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,750
Rano, I attended
high school over here.

810
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,125
-What am I supposed to do?
-Get ready.

811
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:34,000
Bholi has sent me
to pick you up for dance.

812
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,458
She was upset. She said my
friend Ranjeet still hasn't showed up.

813
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,916
Get her urgently.
Urgent means quickly.

814
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Get ready.
I'll take you along.

815
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,875
You have come on a plane?
They will come with Jailu.

816
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:49,291
Don't mind her, son. She is crazy.

817
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,875
You two go inside and
get ready quickly. Go inside.

818
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,791
-Hello, uncle Jailu.
-Hello.

819
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,958
You don't know. You are still young.

820
00:44:57,041 --> 00:45:01,541
I used to go to Canada and America
on cycle and make sweets there.

821
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:04,041
Stop it. Don't lie.

822
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,708
There are seas and
mountains on the way.

823
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,166
How can you go there on a cycle?

824
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,958
Seas and mountains have been made
recently. I am talking about olden times.

825
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,416
-Tell me something.
-What?

826
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,583
How old are you?

827
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:17,750
You can estimate by the fact
that the lemons were just discovered.

828
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:21,708
Hey, he belongs to a time
before herbs were discovered.

829
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,416
-Kalja.
-No, I am Kaleja.

830
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,375
Your mother's...

831
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,041
Are you making Ladoos or squeezing them?

832
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,875
Our relatives will be eating
them and not playing with them.

833
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,916
-This is how my hands move.
-Like this.

834
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,666
Stop showing off,
oh great confectioner.

835
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,791
You don't know how
great confectioner I am.

836
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,583
God has blessed me with great skills.

837
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,916
Even my boils look like candies.

838
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,583
-So what is my fault?
-It's your mother's fault.

839
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,083
She gave birth to such a buffoon.

840
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:50,750
You too come out.
What are you doing, digging a well?

841
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,708
All is looking good, uncle.

842
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,833
No, it isn't.

843
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,500
This is just window dressing.

844
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,458
I am ruined from within.

845
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:05,041
My son had passed away.

846
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:09,916
Then my sister and
her husband passed away.

847
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:15,000
Rano has just cleared high school.

848
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,291
Then we brought her here.

849
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,083
What am I talking about?

850
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,083
Tell me, what would
you like to drink or eat?

851
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:24,750
Why are you offering him anything?
He isn't a guest.

852
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,208
He has a wedding take place at home.

853
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,458
I am sure he is must
have had something.

854
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,291
-Well...
-Let's go son, we are ready.

855
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:33,500
If you want to talk to
him then we will go on foot.

856
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,833
No, uncle Jailu will
come there anyway.

857
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,291
We can talk over there.

858
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,958
Bholi has given me special
duty to take you there.

859
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,750
Let's go, dear. Let's go.
I have my motorcycle with me.

860
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:46,916
Come on.

861
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,833
Aunt, I'd suggest you sit at the back.

862
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:54,500
If the girl falls over then both
you and I'll have to live in guilt.

863
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:55,458
Okay.

864
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:58,250
Rano, you sit in the middle.

865
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,500
I, anyway,
won't be able to sit in the middle.

866
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,666
-How can I, aunt?
-Sit down.

867
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,750
-It's okay. You should listen to
your elders. Right? -Come on, dear.

868
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:07,375
You will manage to adjust.

869
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,125
Do you know what adjust means?

870
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,375
Adjust means adjust.

871
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,750
Bye, uncle Jailu.

872
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,000
<i>Surila.</i>

873
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,125
<i>Surila.</i>

874
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,125
<i>He is here!</i>

875
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:38,916
Surila greets everyone affectionately.

876
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,750
Welcome, Surila.

877
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:43,875
I am already in.
How much further do you wish me to go?

878
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:47,625
Someone tell Jindhar
Singh that Surila is here.

879
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,375
The speaker installer.

880
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,958
-God bless you, son. God bless you.
-I am just lifting the wood.

881
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,166
Take them.

882
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,416
Where is Mr. Jindhar?

883
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,958
During a wedding, you'll
find the confectioner at his place.

884
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,541
Otherwise,
you never know where others are.

885
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:10,833
But I've heard that the confectioners
are placed on ice if he errs.

886
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,583
Don't misbehave! Let me warn you!

887
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,916
When have you ever seen me on my back?

888
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:19,041
-Look at him! Idiot!
-Wonderful.You brought the speakers?

889
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:23,500
They will come. I first need to
find out where I have to place them.

890
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:28,125
Tell me, do you want religious
songs or peppy numbers or mix?

891
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,583
I have one more another question.

892
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:36,458
Are all the guests
educated or illiterate?

893
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,791
Are you here to install
speakers or to conduct a survey?

894
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:39,875
You are asking so many questions!

895
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,083
If you want to ask so many
questions then you may leave.

896
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:43,333
Understood.

897
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,625
What did you understand?

898
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:47,208
That you will like peppy numbers.

899
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,458
Peppy numbers!

900
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:55,125
Dokla, where is Siti? Go find her.

901
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:58,791
There are a lot of dirty utensils in
the kitchen. Who will do all the work?

902
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,041
Where is Siti?

903
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,625
Where can she go, uncle?

904
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:04,791
She must be getting dressed somewhere.
It's okay. I'll go and check.

905
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,708
Okay.

906
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,791
-Dokla.
-Yes.

907
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:11,666
You better keep Siti in your control
or someone else might take her away.

908
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,291
You don't know about such things.
You are still a kid.

909
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:16,083
How can anyone take her away?

910
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:20,333
Just like you eloped with her,
someone else might also do the same.

911
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,916
It was love at first sight.

912
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
She kicked her family away.

913
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:27,666
She doesn't have polio now
that she cannot kick someone else.

914
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,708
-Mind your tongue.
-I am minding it but it is not working.

915
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:31,958
Okay.

916
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,625
-Well done, son.
-Take care of this.

917
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,625
Black cardamoms, mugs and baking soda.

918
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:37,625
Give me.

919
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:42,083
Well done, son. Now go and get
silver foil and cumin seeds as well.

920
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:44,583
It will only take a minute.
Go and get it.

921
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:48,083
Also, get garam masala. Fly away.

922
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:51,500
I'll teach him how
to make Chocolate Barfi.

923
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:55,208
Rano, please scooch
a little or aunt will fall.

924
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,500
No need, son. I won't fall.

925
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,333
Aunt, you sometimes know
only after you fall down.

926
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,041
Stop it!

927
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:20,166
Kumbhkarana used to eat food
meant for 20 villages.

928
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,291
Imagine the manure he produced
when he went to relieve himself!

929
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,833
-Look over there.
-Come, dear.

930
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,083
-Hello.
-Hello.

931
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:31,041
-Son, you did a good thing...
-Hello.

932
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,125
...you brought the ladies along.

933
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:35,833
When you start seeing
and talking a lot...

934
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,666
it means that your
end days are closer.

935
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,291
-That is right.
-You are right.

936
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,458
You just prepare the Chocolate Barfi.

937
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,250
Otherwise, you are fated to be on ice.

938
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,666
-And he scored.
-Sukhi!

939
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,875
I think you are taking
way too responsibilities.

940
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,875
-Spare some time to meet your
father as well. -Hello, father.

941
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,458
-Bless you.
-When did you come?

942
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:56,583
When you were carrying passengers
in a snail paced ride...

943
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,750
our jeep raced passed it.

944
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,833
I have stopped speeding
on my motorcycle.

945
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:04,625
Yeah, sure.
You have speeded up something else.

946
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,125
-Yes.
-Yes.

947
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:08,583
Where's our mummy?

948
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,208
Not ours, she is your mummy.

949
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,833
Where is she?

950
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,208
-My son Sukhchan is during
the final year of graduation. -Okay.

951
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:19,208
My niece will be in
the final year next year.

952
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,458
She studies in Khalsa College,
Patiala.

953
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:23,166
Aunt, I am a part
of the female dance team.

954
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,166
A term cannot be formed
in college without me.

955
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,500
Right, a term cannot be formed
without you. You are so modest!

956
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,583
Mummy!
You came a day earlier?

957
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,333
Were you worried that
aunt will fall short of Ladoos?

958
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:37,083
Look at that, my son is so funny.

959
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:40,000
He cannot be as funny as I am.
I am Pinky.

960
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:42,291
-Hello. I am Sukhi.
-Hello.

961
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,583
She is my aunt.

962
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,291
And she is my mother.

963
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,125
She is my sister-in-law.

964
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:50,291
The one standing back there with
a plate full of Ladoos is my brother.

965
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,541
-He is my uncle.
-Did we leave out anyone?

966
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,791
Where do you study?

967
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:58,041
That depends. It's sometimes on
the terrace and sometimes in the bus.

968
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,708
But mummy knows that
I don't study much.

969
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:02,708
I am being considerate
because of your old age.

970
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,458
Otherwise,
I would have burning you under wood.

971
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:05,958
-At least come out of the egg first.
-Damn!

972
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:09,500
I have more year's experience
catering than your age.

973
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,791
-You can ask anyone.
-Let it be, Chaddar.

974
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,083
Why are you arguing
with a crazy man?

975
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,875
I was crazy about your mother too.

976
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,833
Don't talk about my mother.
I will hit you.

977
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:19,125
-You don't know. You were a kid back then.
-I won't make Ladoos for you.

978
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,916
-I'll strangle you.
-Why are you bothering, Chaddar?

979
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,791
It is Bholi's wedding.
No one is supposed to fight.

980
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,375
Will he fight? He isn't Dara Singh.

981
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,416
What happened?
What's all this commotion about?

982
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,125
What kind of a person have you
given to help me? He is a useless guy.

983
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:34,000
Have you sorted it out
or should I get a stick?

984
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,958
Both father and son
are after my blood.

985
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,875
You won't fall short even if
we have a few bottles of your blood.

986
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:42,291
No sister-in-law,
a stick won't do him any harm.

987
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:45,375
Sit on him and just crush him.

988
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,625
You wait right there, I'll
teach you a lesson. how much you talk!

989
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,958
Don't make me slap you. Can't
you give me the whole list at once?

990
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:52,125
You made me go there four times.

991
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:54,583
I come in later,
he starts barking go and get this.

992
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:57,041
Son, you cannot make
do without confectioners.

993
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,166
Your father is still to die.

994
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,208
No one will bother
seeking you in near future.

995
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,083
They will sell readymade sweets.

996
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,666
Weddings won't take place at home.

997
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,625
-There will be palaces.
-Stop making predictions.

998
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,208
What do you think you are,
a fortuneteller?

999
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:12,583
Attitude and ego ruin the fun of life.

1000
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,958
If your heart is filled with
sweetness, you don't need Ladoos.

1001
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,958
Brother Sukhi, I don't understand.

1002
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:19,708
We weren't discussing Ladoos.

1003
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:21,416
You never understand anything.

1004
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:28,166
Sadhu, whatever you want, ask for
it affectionately and you will get it.

1005
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,416
Now should I give him a
kiss and send him to the market?

1006
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,375
Like muah,
go and get silver foil for the Barfi.

1007
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:38,291
-Did you made the Chocolate Barfi?
-I have made something better.

1008
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:41,083
We don't want anything else.
We want Chocolate Barfi.

1009
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:42,041
If you don't give it
then you better watch out.

1010
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,125
We will make run in torn knickers.

1011
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:44,875
Don't make us do what they did
to you at Salam.

1012
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,875
They got him on the day of the wedding.

1013
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,541
We will handle him
a day before the wedding.

1014
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,750
Call for ice.

1015
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,208
Why, you want to place
your dead body on it?

1016
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:52,541
You are right.

1017
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,333
Okay, God sees everything.

1018
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:58,250
Well done, Surila.
Now fix the speakers on the terrace.

1019
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,250
The speakers get fixed on the terrace.

1020
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,125
-Have you heard anyone fixing it on a tap?
-I have seen it as well.

1021
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:05,083
The speaker installer in
our village also said the same.

1022
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,791
We tied him to a tap and
fixed a speaker on his ear.

1023
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:12,541
That makes me wonder if you
placed the speaker on his ear...

1024
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:16,083
then they will get covered
so how would he hear the music?

1025
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,958
-Hence I say that...
-I say you fix it whenever you want.

1026
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:19,791
Where did you get him from, uncle?

1027
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:23,500
Jindhar, you are going to play songs.
Won't this disturb the prayers?

1028
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:27,416
Sadhu, we did the prayers
a week back at the Gurudwara.

1029
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,666
-Good thing.
-We are having a wedding here.

1030
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,291
We can make a thousand mistakes
while attending to the guests.

1031
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:32,916
-Pick that up, come on.
-Hey speaker master.

1032
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,791
-Yes.
-Play Hindi songs.

1033
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:38,208
Why Hindi songs? I am not from Bombay.

1034
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:41,333
Don't mention Bombay in front of me.

1035
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:43,958
My body catches fire.

1036
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:47,500
<i>"Oh mother, she caused a scene!"</i>

1037
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:50,875
<i>"Oh mother, she caused a scene!"</i>

1038
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:54,125
<i>"Oh mother, she caused a scene!"</i>

1039
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,375
<i>"Oh mother, she caused a scene!"</i>

1040
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:00,625
<i>"Oh mother, she caused a scene!"</i>

1041
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:04,375
Do ladies need anything to eat.

1042
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:07,083
Do you need to even ask, brother?
Get whatever you want.

1043
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:08,166
They will eat anything.

1044
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,166
-Tota.
-Yes, brother?

1045
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,791
Get some fritters and
ask Siti to serve tea.

1046
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,666
Siti won't serve anything.

1047
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,458
You will have to do that.

1048
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:22,125
I feel like breaking Siti's leg,
lazy girl.

1049
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,583
Why are you breaking her legs, aunt?
I am here for you.

1050
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:25,791
Sit down, Siti.

1051
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:32,041
Mummy, you look very beautiful when
you place your veil behind your ears.

1052
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,666
Come on, get up. You aren't here
making sweets or anything. Get up.

1053
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,125
-Surila...
-Yes?

1054
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,625
Give me a foot massage.

1055
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:44,166
One day I will strangle you.

1056
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,791
I will ask Chhotu.

1057
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:48,125
-Get up, Chhotu.
-I won't.

1058
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:49,958
-Get up, son.
-Why?

1059
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:52,750
-Your mother passed away.
-Good.

1060
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,041
I swear,
I have nothing to do with that.

1061
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:58,000
Stop your nonsense.
Play a nice song.

1062
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,458
Start singing.

1063
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:04,625
-"The poor..."
-Stop the music.

1064
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,833
Let the girls dance.

1065
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:10,166
What? What did you say?
Should I increase the volume?

1066
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,875
We cannot hear ourselves out here.

1067
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:16,208
Okay, don't worry.
I'll increase it to full volume.

1068
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:19,958
-Full!
-Stop the music!

1069
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,416
I'll hit you with my slipper. Stop it.

1070
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,708
-Stop the music!
-Stop the music!

1071
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:26,125
Stop it. Why are you causing uproar?

1072
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:31,416
I cause uproar everywhere.
Whether it's for them or for you.

1073
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,625
Okay, I will stop it.

1074
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:35,250
-Will you stop it now?
-He stopped it.

1075
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,333
-He stopped it.
-Come on girls, sing.

1076
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:39,250
<i>"It is an auspicious occasion"</i>

1077
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,625
<i>"It is an auspicious occasion"</i>

1078
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,916
<i>"It is an auspicious occasion"</i>

1079
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,208
<i>"Don't keep talking
about your in-laws"</i>

1080
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,458
<i>"There is no place as good as this"</i>

1081
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,208
<i>"Wonderful!"</i>

1082
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:57,458
<i>"You have changed after
going to your in-laws' place."</i>

1083
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:29,125
<i>Oh my angel,
meet me at the cattle pen at 4:00am.</i>

1084
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:31,500
I don't like this.

1085
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:34,125
-Why?
-First you came here quite late.

1086
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,708
Then you didn't even have a drink.

1087
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:38,041
Don't worry.
We will get together some other time.

1088
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,041
Today is the death
anniversary of our elder.

1089
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,083
-Sukhi! Come here.
-Yes.

1090
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,833
-Call Shindo.
-You're leaving already?

1091
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,083
He says he wants to leave.

1092
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:49,541
But they are still at it.
I'll drop them home.

1093
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:53,708
It's not a problem but we have to
get up early because of the animals.

1094
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,541
-Okay.
-Please go and call them.

1095
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,333
Come.

1096
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,458
Very good.

1097
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:02,583
Get the rest of the things inside, son.
Come on. Very good.

1098
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,166
Here, hold the horse's reins.

1099
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:18,583
People hand over a girl.

1100
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,500
And you are giving me a horse, Dongra?

1101
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:25,000
Are you blind?
I am sitting on the horse.

1102
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:28,916
Once you hold the horse's reins,
you can take me anywhere.

1103
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,250
I gave you the horse's reins to guide
it and not so that you can marry Rano.

1104
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:36,666
You should stop thinking about Rano.

1105
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:40,125
I have already fixed her marriage.

1106
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:42,166
Say that you are lying.

1107
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,458
Okay, come on.

1108
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,291
I have never managed
to remove the rope...

1109
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,916
as fast as it removed the cover.

1110
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,458
It removed the cover? Oh no!

1111
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:03,750
The calf is so smart?

1112
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:06,583
It removed the cover
and hung it on the nail?

1113
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:19,208
She came to meet me?
Do you want something?

1114
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:21,583
Idiot! Damn you!

1115
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,000
She gave me something instead!

1116
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,041
What happened, son?

1117
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:38,125
You got up so early?

1118
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:41,208
Did you go to take your
bike for a bathroom break?

1119
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:43,625
It is some cattle that I
will take it for a bathroom break.

1120
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:44,916
Anyway, what's your problem?

1121
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,333
What problem can I have?

1122
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,208
When early in the
morning you see someone...

1123
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:56,208
stealthily dragging a
bike which starts on first kick,

1124
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,666
then you are bound to be worried.

1125
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,458
Sadhu, you should
instead worry about...

1126
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:04,250
getting hit left and right then
you will yearn to go to bathroom...

1127
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,958
like a diabetic yearns for sweets.

1128
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,500
-Understood?
-It's okay, son.

1129
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:14,000
You will know when you get caught.

1130
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,291
-Kaleja.
-Yes?

1131
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:38,291
Boys say that there was a frog
in the milk you brought yesterday.

1132
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:41,458
He brings milk.
What else did you expect, elephants?

1133
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,833
Shut up.

1134
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:48,458
Surila, boys were saying
that you have only old records.

1135
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:50,666
Don't worry, I'll buy new records.

1136
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:54,958
Some boys also said that
you don't know how to make Barfi.

1137
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:58,458
He keeps making some
pre-independence old Barfi.

1138
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:03,291
I said don't worry. I will
ask him to make Chocolate Barfi.

1139
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,291
He'll make Chocolate Barfi?

1140
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:08,125
Shut up! Go and get green chilies. Go.

1141
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:09,208
I don't know how many to get.

1142
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:12,208
It's not meat we are talking about.
Go and get a handful of them.

1143
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:13,666
-Come along with me.
-Let's go.

1144
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,416
I'll go and do a few
of my pending work as well.

1145
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,583
Let's go. Wait.

1146
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,625
Don't fall. Don't break anything.

1147
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:25,875
Wait, let me sit behind you,
then you can start driving.

1148
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,041
An old woman approached Sadhu once.

1149
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,458
She asked do you have
any Puri-Paaris?

1150
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,666
He said, I won't have
any Puris (fried bread)..

1151
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:53,958
...you can take Paaris
(kisses) instead.

1152
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,791
Sukhi, I left Sadhu at
the market while coming back.

1153
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,083
I made him push the
scooter twice on the way there.

1154
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:04,791
Well done.

1155
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,375
Hello, uncle Jailu. Hello.

1156
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,458
-This is great.
-Hello. God bless you.

1157
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:13,500
What great thing did he do?
Pulled a train with his teeth?

1158
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:17,541
Grandma, I meant it's a
responsible thing to come on time.

1159
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:19,875
Hello! Welcome!

1160
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,541
-Hello!
-I am so happy that you came, Shindo.

1161
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,833
-There is a lot of work that
needs to be done. -Hello, aunt.

1162
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:26,833
-Where is your father?
-He is waiting for you on the terrace.

1163
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,291
-Let's go, dear. -Grandma, I
have some work for you as well today.

1164
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:33,083
The wok is kept on fire.
The cook is no good.

1165
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:34,958
-You will have to check
the salt and sugar. -Okay.

1166
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,125
-Seethe.
-Yes.

1167
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:37,083
Take her along.

1168
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,291
-Now, I'll go and handle everything.
-Come grandma.

1169
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,083
You give me this.

1170
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:44,458
It is your friend's wedding. You too
should be given some responsibilities.

1171
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:48,000
I was waiting for you at night.
You didn't show up.

1172
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,916
What is this?
What you did to me was wrong.

1173
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,500
Hello! Listen to me.

1174
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,625
You are only interested in taking the
letter? You didn't intend to show up?

1175
01:04:56,583 --> 01:05:00,458
The one who got the letter
must have waited for you.

1176
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:01,375
What?

1177
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:02,291
What what?

1178
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:05,875
Some people only like to give
letters and have no intend to show up.

1179
01:05:06,291 --> 01:05:07,250
What?

1180
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,833
What what?

1181
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:12,041
It's either what, why or how?

1182
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,375
Be careful that I give
you respect because of...

1183
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,166
the education my parents gave me.

1184
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:22,666
If I get angry,
it won't take me long to curse you.

1185
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,291
That's enough, dear.

1186
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:28,416
I just wanted to check do
you have any pride left in you or not.

1187
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,208
Come on, my love. Get to work now.

1188
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,750
Can you tell me where's my red shirt?

1189
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:34,958
Outside, on the stand.

1190
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,833
What the hell! This is bad.

1191
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:39,250
Hey girl, did you remove
the shirt from the stand?

1192
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,875
I hope he doesn't
get hold of the letter.

1193
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:47,875
-Do you guys call it a shirt?
-Guddi!

1194
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:50,416
-This is true.
-Right.

1195
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,041
Absolutely?

1196
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:54,041
Sir, tea and Ladoos.

1197
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:58,583
Very good. Tea and Ladoos.

1198
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,791
You are serving him eggs, chickens...

1199
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,916
I'll tell you, once I saw someone
get beaten up at the railway station.

1200
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:08,500
A man was selling snacks.
He kept saying serving hot.

1201
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,041
A girl passed by.

1202
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:12,708
He said serving hot girl.

1203
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:16,250
She grabbed him and told
him I'll tell you how hot I am.

1204
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,750
<i>She must have shown her hotness
by hitting him with her sandals.</i>

1205
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,208
<i>This is great.</i>

1206
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:21,125
Sukhi?

1207
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:23,708
-What are you looking at?
-Your mother.

1208
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,666
-You too, Sukhi?
-Get lost!

1209
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,416
I'll tell you! Come with me.

1210
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,416
-Now tell me.
-What?

1211
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,958
Will this stand tell if you
don't tell where my red shirt is?

1212
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:37,375
-I had hanged it over here.
-Then did the ground swallow it?

1213
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:42,208
Has anyone seen my red shirt?

1214
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:56,958
Well known singers beg me,
they plead me.

1215
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:01,875
"Surila, please play my song."

1216
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:05,041
Don't tell anyone.
Keep it to yourself.

1217
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:09,250
Mohammed Sadeek and Manik
became hit because of me.

1218
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:11,250
-Really?
-Yes, then what!

1219
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,833
And how many lost work because of you?
Tell them that as well.

1220
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:17,208
Tell them where all you got hit
by sandals for playing dirty songs.

1221
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,499
Look, I was never hit by sandals.

1222
01:08:19,582 --> 01:08:23,124
But yes, I was beaten up
a year ago for the dirty songs.

1223
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:26,666
Then I washed the cassette
and the songs became clean.

1224
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:31,582
Then people started giving me a
lot of respect. Everyone respected me.

1225
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:35,541
But Sadhu Singh,
people say that if you keep...

1226
01:08:35,624 --> 01:08:40,874
ice in your hand for two
minutes then your hands go numb.

1227
01:08:40,957 --> 01:08:43,540
They made you sit on the ice.

1228
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:45,499
How did you feel back then?

1229
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:47,540
Damn, Chaddar.

1230
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:51,666
He has ruined my name.
He is troubling me.

1231
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:54,874
He made me get down from
the scooter and came back here.

1232
01:08:54,957 --> 01:08:57,582
My feet got blistered
with all that working.

1233
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:02,333
Only blistered?
He had said he would break your legs too.

1234
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:05,541
Tell me, who are you
supporting me or Chaddar?

1235
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:08,707
Look, I have to face God,
so I won't lie.

1236
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:11,416
I am supporting Chaddar.

1237
01:09:13,207 --> 01:09:17,082
I'll call Chaddar.
He'll apply a balm on your legs.

1238
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:20,666
Lie down. I'll massage your legs.

1239
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:24,999
No need! Go and do the dishes.
I'll handle him.

1240
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:27,165
Handle me, what do you think I am?

1241
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:30,458
I had once handled the grocer.

1242
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:32,457
Chhotu was just a kid back then.

1243
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:34,249
What happened was..

1244
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:35,915
-Tota!
-Yes?

1245
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:37,624
You too serve this great sage.

1246
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,458
Uncle Jindhar,
get a glass of milk for uncle Sadhu.

1247
01:09:42,749 --> 01:09:45,582
-With some turmeric in it.
-Do you guys want me dead?

1248
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:47,833
Have you forgotten
the days when as a kid...

1249
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:50,749
you used to come
to me and ask for Barfi?

1250
01:09:50,832 --> 01:09:54,665
I am all grown up now. And I still
ask for Barfi. But Chocolate Barfi.

1251
01:09:57,250 --> 01:10:00,125
Shyama, go and help
them with the tent.

1252
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:03,041
Brother Sukhi, but they have
already brought help with them.

1253
01:10:03,125 --> 01:10:05,708
What will I do over there?
I want to work here.

1254
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:09,291
Brother Sukhi, there is no
sight of Chocolate Barfi as yet.

1255
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,875
Then I think you will be
going empty handed from here, Sadhu.

1256
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,708
It will be embarrassing
for us if he goes empty handed.

1257
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,416
We will send him in torn knickers.

1258
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:20,125
Chaddar, please keep me out of this.

1259
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:24,208
Father, please make
the Chocolate Barfi.

1260
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,125
Even if you make it
like you made at Salam.

1261
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:29,208
I'll give you a piece of it.
Let me know if it's sweet enough.

1262
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,958
It's a little less.
Add another ladle full of it.

1263
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:32,125
-You...
-Now, okay.

1264
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,583
Sukhi! Brother-in-law
is asking for you.

1265
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:41,833
From where did Jindhar
found such a lanky son-in-law?

1266
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,875
You don't know, Surila.
Let me tell you.

1267
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:48,333
He wasn't lanky,
he was rather healthy.

1268
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:51,208
You know he has a habit
of wiping his noses.

1269
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:53,375
-He keeps snorting.
-Yes.

1270
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,540
-Once he was spraying on wheat fields.
-Okay.

1271
01:10:56,791 --> 01:11:03,333
He bymistake wiped his
nose with the spray pipe.

1272
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:15,916
How did this happened!
I shrank! I am ruined!

1273
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:19,416
Then they found him laying like a piece of
dried cotton in the field.

1274
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:24,290
I'll go and help Siti with the sheets.

1275
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,208
I know how to spread
the sheets better.

1276
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:28,250
Do you understand, Tota?

1277
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,958
I have spread
many sheets and people too.

1278
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:31,916
Come with me.

1279
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,875
Shyama, go with him.

1280
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:35,375
Okay, now the sheets
have become heavy?

1281
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:43,540
Like this cloth was
leeching on to Shyama...

1282
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,916
there are many people
leeching on the others.

1283
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:52,666
The day I get an opportunity I'll...

1284
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:01,750
What do you mean, I should
now beg like a beggar...

1285
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:05,750
Give me my shirt back, for God's sake.

1286
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:09,290
This looks like my shirt.

1287
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:12,083
-Wear some other shirt, brother-in-law.
-Won't that ruin my style?

1288
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,500
Today, you will get
to see Sukhi Jatt's style...

1289
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:20,540
when he'll wear a yellow turban,
white shirt and red jacket.

1290
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:23,250
Everyone will only look at him in awe.

1291
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:26,250
Seetha, why are you telling
everything to brother-in-law?

1292
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,540
He will copy my style.

1293
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:32,500
Sukhi, you won't wear those clothes.

1294
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,500
Do you understand or shall I explain?

1295
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,458
It is mine.

1296
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:09,875
-It's yours?
-Yes.

1297
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,708
Take it. I anyway can't read it.

1298
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,665
Brother Sukhi!

1299
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:36,000
Please read this letter for me.

1300
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,333
-Please read this letter for me.
-No.

1301
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,500
Siti threw it towards me.

1302
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:45,875
Siti threw it?

1303
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:49,208
Then listen what Siti has to say.

1304
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,500
-Siti writes:
-Yes?

1305
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,875
-Dear Tota...
-Oh my.

1306
01:13:57,041 --> 01:14:02,625
I give you a lot of...

1307
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:03,915
What's that?

1308
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,916
It's sugar-free sweet, Tota.

1309
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,125
-Okay.
-There's more.

1310
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,666
-I wish to eat sweet
flatbread with you. -Oh my.

1311
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,875
Once all the singing
and dancing is over at night...

1312
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,708
meet me at the cattle pen.

1313
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,875
We will talk about love.

1314
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:28,040
Oh my.
Oh my, love gives a different high.

1315
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:29,665
-Give me that letter.
-No.

1316
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,791
Lovers shouldn't be
in position of such letters.

1317
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,583
You might get into trouble.

1318
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:37,583
Coming Siti.

1319
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:44,875
Sukhi! Go and check on
the progress of the tent outside.

1320
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,540
Uncle, you are sitting
like a commander.

1321
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:50,416
There is a wedding taking place here.
You should be all over the place.

1322
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:51,958
You too should take
up some responsibility.

1323
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:53,833
This is just too much!

1324
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,291
Rano! Rano!

1325
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,500
Bholi has sent a list for you.

1326
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:02,125
Take it.
Read it careful.

1327
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:03,833
Take it.

1328
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:10,625
-Tell me..
-Don't say anything about my mother.

1329
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,083
Then the topic is over?

1330
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,375
Let me know unhesitatingly...

1331
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:18,165
if you want me to play
a romantic song for someone special.

1332
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:21,750
I unhesitatingly hit people as well.

1333
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,083
I understood.

1334
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:28,083
Then I'll play the
brother-sister song.

1335
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:30,790
Sukhi, you better talk to Chaddar.

1336
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:32,750
He is troubling me a lot these days.

1337
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:37,875
Tell him that I am old and
I know more tricks than you guys.

1338
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,416
I have a bad temper too.

1339
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,583
-How bad?
-Worse than your face.

1340
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,791
You have been cleaning the record...

1341
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,291
so you might as
well clean your face too.

1342
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,041
And tell Chaddar that
if he raises his hand on me...

1343
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,375
then I'll hit where it hurts.

1344
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,875
I'll tell you something.

1345
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:55,500
I had gone to meet Chhotu's
mother before our wedding.

1346
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,040
She came to meet me.

1347
01:15:57,125 --> 01:16:02,125
When I held her hand, she slapped me.

1348
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:04,540
-Then?
-Then what? I too slapped her.

1349
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:08,458
She told me Sadhu Nath,
we will make a good match.

1350
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,541
Sadhu! Listen carefully.

1351
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:12,750
I'll break your face
and Chhotu's stomach../

1352
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:16,040
-if you don't do your job properly.
- Right.

1353
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:19,375
If aunt gets angry, you'll get blown
away like a bag does during a storm.

1354
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:22,415
Aunt, I told him to make
Chocolate Barfi four days back.

1355
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,416
There are still no
signs of Chocolate Barfi.

1356
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,750
Damn you, why didn't
you make the Colgate Barfi?

1357
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:28,790
She wants to brush her
teeth with the Barfi?

1358
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,666
Tell me.
Why aren't you saying anything?

1359
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:35,875
Brother, you keep taking plates full
of sweets to sister-in-law.

1360
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,250
She won't fit into her
clothes on the last day.

1361
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:40,833
She troubles me if
I don't get them for her.

1362
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:42,416
And then you are ordering me here.

1363
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,250
This is great! This is a limit! I have
been looking for it on the terrace...

1364
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:47,290
and you have kept the box of
liquor bottles out here in the open.

1365
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,250
That too so close to Sadhu.
No one respects alcohol out here.

1366
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:51,540
Get this straight as well, Sadhu.

1367
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:55,541
If there is anything lacking in the food
for the girls tonight and tomorrow...

1368
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,375
then I'll be your worst enemy,
let me tell you.

1369
01:16:57,458 --> 01:17:00,290
You will feel worse than
a donkey working in the field.

1370
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:01,541
Do you understand?

1371
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,541
Hear them talk!

1372
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:06,208
I wonder what everyone had eaten.

1373
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,458
They are very bitter.

1374
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,915
I think your mother too had
chilies before giving birth to you.

1375
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,166
This Barfi is bland.
There is no taste in it.

1376
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:17,833
This isn't Barfi,
it's cottage cheese, old woman.

1377
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,625
Who knows what will happen
or what will not happen.

1378
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:29,208
But these questions sound very good.

1379
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:31,041
<i>Do I love you?</i>

1380
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,333
<i>Do you like me?</i>

1381
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:36,208
<i>I want to meet you to know
the answers to these questions.</i>

1382
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,750
<i>Don't misunderstand me.</i>

1383
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:41,540
<i>I'll come to meet you at 12,
at the cattle pen.</i>

1384
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,625
<i>Please do come.
Waiting for you, Sukhi</i>

1385
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,458
Have you lost your mind?

1386
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:01,208
You don't feel shy
writing letter, do you?

1387
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,083
What do you think of yourself?

1388
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,708
You will fix a time for our meeting?

1389
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:07,666
No, don't misunderstand me.

1390
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,083
I like you a lot.

1391
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:14,333
I am crazy not just about
your face but your nature as well.

1392
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,416
Nowadays,
I spend my days thinking about you.

1393
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,166
Don't make tall claims.
I don't think about you at all.

1394
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,791
Okay, if you don't then
why have you come here?

1395
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:27,833
I have come here to tell you that
I don't have any feelings for you.

1396
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,541
And uncle will be here soon. Don't
get yourself beaten up unnecessarily.

1397
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:31,458
Do you understand?

1398
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,458
Hello!

1399
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:36,833
How dare you touch me!

1400
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,375
She slapped me!

1401
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:43,083
Then I too slapped her.

1402
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:47,916
She told me Sadhu Nath,
we will make a good match.

1403
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:17,750
What was Sukhi doing upstairs?

1404
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:22,958
Hello, what are you doing here?

1405
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:24,375
I was looking for you over there.

1406
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,250
What's in that bag?

1407
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:30,208
No, it's just...

1408
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:34,541
Okay, Barfi, Gulam Jamun.

1409
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,791
So you are gathering sweets.

1410
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:39,791
No, brother. It's for your
sister-in-law Pasho. I mean..

1411
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:42,958
You ugly face,
don't you have any shame?

1412
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,875
I'll slap you.

1413
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:48,208
No, sister-in-law. Don't slap him.

1414
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,416
Girls have very strong
hands these days.

1415
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,833
Take this. I am leaving.

1416
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,333
Where are you going?
Wait a minute.

1417
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:57,833
You are covered in husk
and you came from up there.

1418
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:00,500
Go and make tea. I'll talk to him.
Come.

1419
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:02,540
-Come upstairs with me.
-Seetha, I want my turban...

1420
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:04,541
I'll tell you how
to starch your turban.

1421
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:08,625
I doubted it.

1422
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:12,250
But I didn't know that
things have gone so far.

1423
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,791
You have crossed all
limits with all that slapping.

1424
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:17,458
She thinks too much of herself.

1425
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,458
Calm down.
Rano addresses me as brother.

1426
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:23,791
Uncle Jailu has given me the
responsibility to look after her.

1427
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:26,665
Do you think I am fooling around?

1428
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:29,916
I want to marry Rano.

1429
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:36,833
Seetha, if you help me out in this then
I swear, I'll never forget your favor.

1430
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,333
It's not a big deal anyway.

1431
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:41,665
But you have made the girl
go against you by slapping her.

1432
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,000
I will convince her.

1433
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:47,083
Then I convince uncle Jailu.

1434
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,375
But what if your father refuses?

1435
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,915
No way.

1436
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,916
Uncle Jailu and my father
are very good friends.

1437
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:56,333
Okay then, you convince Rano.

1438
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,916
Okay.

1439
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,000
Here's the gram flour.

1440
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,958
-Dokla.
-Yes?

1441
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:05,375
What are you doing here?

1442
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:08,040
Your Siti is romancing
with someone else.

1443
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,708
Mind your tongue.

1444
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:13,416
I'll mind my tongue.
You should go and mind your wife.

1445
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:15,916
I cannot see Tota anywhere.

1446
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:19,500
He is standing next to Siti.

1447
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,125
I suggest two smacks on the knees.

1448
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:25,915
No one will notice in
the commotion of the wedding.

1449
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:30,791
Who are you romancing hiding out here?

1450
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,625
Damn you!
You scoundrel!

1451
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,790
I'll teach you a lesson.

1452
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:40,750
You ate my share of rice!
you scoundrel!

1453
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:44,500
You think you are some Romeo!

1454
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,500
I beg of you. I have some respect
in this village. Don't ruin it.

1455
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:48,916
Take it.

1456
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,040
Give me two more Ladoos, son.

1457
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:54,375
Okay.

1458
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:56,750
-Aunt, do you remember.
-What?

1459
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:59,208
When I was small,
you had once slapped me.

1460
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:00,791
I too had slapped you back.

1461
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,625
But when I said sorry,
you forgave me immediately.

1462
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,665
When did you ever slap me?

1463
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:10,083
If you had slapped me,
I would have broken your neck.

1464
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:13,625
You get beaten up every day.
Stop lying.

1465
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:19,375
Hey girl...
I will go and ask Sukhi's aunt...

1466
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:22,083
-how much sweets should we
give to her maternal family. -Okay.

1467
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:25,500
Dear, you put sweets in these bags.
I'll be right back, okay?

1468
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,083
-Okay.
-Sukhi, help her.

1469
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,250
Are you still angry over that slap?

1470
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:39,625
Here, throw this Ladoo shaped
by Kaleja and vent out your anger.

1471
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:41,625
Do it! Do it!

1472
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,000
Do it.

1473
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,666
Surila, does your music
system work fine?

1474
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,916
His music system burns reels.

1475
01:22:57,458 --> 01:23:00,208
This man is looting in
his own sister's house.

1476
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:03,000
He eats a lot.
He ate half the vegetable cooked.

1477
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:06,750
-He doesn't eat. His wife hogs.
-Okay.

1478
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:09,540
Women have even made
sages their slaves.

1479
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:11,541
-So what can he do?
-Right.

1480
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,791
Dokla, I cannot see Tota. Where is he?

1481
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:18,041
Where can he go?
He must be here somewhere.

1482
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:20,333
Dokla.

1483
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,540
Surila.

1484
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:22,625
It is tasty.

1485
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:24,458
Play that song from Sholay..

1486
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,833
When a girl gets angry,
she looks even more beautiful.

1487
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:29,875
She got angry already?

1488
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:32,583
I think I'll have to
teach you a lesson too.

1489
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:34,708
Here, give me two
glasses of special drink.

1490
01:23:34,791 --> 01:23:39,625
No, that drink is only
for the special wedding guests.

1491
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:41,583
It is not for any ordinary person.

1492
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:44,083
I am the eldest son of the
eldest son-in-law of this family.

1493
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:46,625
Quietly give it to me.
It is for my parents.

1494
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,291
You brought for both of us?

1495
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:52,333
Yes, mother has put
me on special duty.

1496
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:55,125
I have to take special
care of Bholi and her friends.

1497
01:23:55,416 --> 01:23:56,875
I said I understand
that Bholi is my sister...

1498
01:23:57,041 --> 01:24:01,291
but what if one of her
friends gets angry and slaps me?

1499
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,958
Then you slap her back.

1500
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:06,625
I will.
But then she won't forget me.

1501
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,000
-Right?
-I'll forgive you right away.

1502
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:12,375
Well, you will forgive me
even if I don't make a mistake.

1503
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:17,083
Here, drink it.

1504
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:19,500
You have been eyeing
it from quite some time.

1505
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:21,000
Here.

1506
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:25,583
Okay, so he is romancing
Jindhar's niece.

1507
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:28,083
Damn that Sadhu is staring at me as...

1508
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:31,958
if he has never seen
a beautiful girl before.

1509
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:37,958
Okay, so this is what he is up to?

1510
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:42,291
Damn you! There is so much
work left to be done!

1511
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,583
-Who will do it? Your father!
-No aunt! I am not hiding.

1512
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:46,583
-Don't hit me, aunt.
-You are hiding over here!

1513
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:48,750
You lazy fellow!
Who will do all the work?

1514
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,708
You are hiding over here!

1515
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:53,375
I know everything!
I know what you are up to!

1516
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,750
Wait, I'll break your bones!
You just wait!

1517
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,500
One can make a mistake sometimes.

1518
01:24:57,583 --> 01:25:00,750
You slapped once.
I slapped once. We are quits.

1519
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:03,125
What are you doing, Sukhi?

1520
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:04,790
I am rehearing for Jagoo, mother.

1521
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:06,500
Jagoo is here! Jagoo is here!

1522
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:08,290
I don't know, you are a fool.

1523
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:10,125
I want to marry you.

1524
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:18,833
Sukhi, my uncle has already fixed
my marriage with someone in Ahmedghad.

1525
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:26,291
Sometimes God doesn't
want what the heart wants.

1526
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:45,208
<i>"It wasn't her fault"</i>

1527
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:48,458
<i>"It wasn't my fault"</i>

1528
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:54,791
<i>"Then tell me,
why did you separate us?"</i>

1529
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:13,000
<i>"It wasn't her fault"</i>

1530
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:16,375
<i>"It wasn't my fault"</i>

1531
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:23,375
<i>"Then tell me,
why did you separate us?"</i>

1532
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:27,458
<i>"Our desires..."</i>

1533
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:30,041
<i>"Our desires..."</i>

1534
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:35,333
<i>"Why did You drown them in tears?"</i>

1535
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:44,125
<i>"Oh God,
why did you break two hearts?"</i>

1536
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:51,333
<i>"Oh God,
why did you break two hearts?"</i>

1537
01:26:51,666 --> 01:27:00,666
<i>"Oh God,
why did you break two hearts?"</i>

1538
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:09,375
<i>"Oh my beloved!"</i>

1539
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,833
<i>"She didn't try to go away from me"</i>

1540
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:43,333
<i>"Why couldn't you
see us happy together?"</i>

1541
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:54,000
<i>"She didn't try to go away from me."</i>

1542
01:27:54,500 --> 01:28:01,041
<i>"Why couldn't you
see us happy together?"</i>

1543
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:04,875
<i>"Why did you..."</i>

1544
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:12,915
<i>"Why did you drown
our love in sorrows?"</i>

1545
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:19,833
<i>"Oh God,
why did you break two hearts?"</i>

1546
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:27,166
<i>"Oh God,
why did you break two hearts?"</i>

1547
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:36,250
<i>"Oh God,
why did you break two hearts?"</i>

1548
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:46,000
Rano, you?

1549
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:48,583
What happened?
Why are you crying?

1550
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,208
After the wedding,
you will go very far away from me.

1551
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,000
I started crying thinking about that.

1552
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,333
No, Rano. Stop crying.

1553
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:08,250
Sukhi, this is like the instrument
breaks before you even start the sing.

1554
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:15,000
Anyway, we shouldn't get
shots if there is no fever.

1555
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:16,708
What do you mean?

1556
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:20,958
It's not like you were dating her.

1557
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,833
I mean it was one-sided love, right?

1558
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:25,708
She did say anything.

1559
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:29,708
No buddy,
she told me about her marriage.

1560
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:32,666
This shows that she isn't
happy with that alliance.

1561
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,916
I think she has some feelings for me.

1562
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,750
But you too are right.

1563
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,750
She is already engaged,
what can we do?

1564
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:44,625
We cannot do anything.

1565
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,000
Why can't we do anything?

1566
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,625
You should do at least
something sometimes.

1567
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:50,583
We can do something but...

1568
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:54,208
a relationship isn't glass
that we can break with a stone.

1569
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:56,333
We can break it.
Why can't we break it?

1570
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:58,458
-Why can't we break it?
-Yes, we can break it.

1571
01:29:58,666 --> 01:30:00,583
But it is not so easy.

1572
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,583
-I'll think of something.
-Let's go.

1573
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:03,540
What let's go.

1574
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,750
I'll go outside and think. You sit
here and use your tiny little brain.

1575
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:16,916
My son is acting
like a Romeo these days.

1576
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:18,666
Come here.

1577
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:21,625
No father, it's not so.

1578
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,000
I am your father.

1579
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,833
I treat you like a friend.

1580
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:33,290
When words hurt instead
of giving pleasure...

1581
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:39,500
then you should assume
that the youth is in trouble.

1582
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:43,875
Father, sometimes people
who are walking on the right path...

1583
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:46,458
have to face the
sign of road closed ahead.

1584
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,125
Sukhi, sometimes life
makes you stand on crossroads...

1585
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:59,416
where you have plenty of options but
you don't know which is the right one.

1586
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:05,165
If your soul is pure
and your intentions are good...

1587
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:09,583
then you end up finding the
right path to fulfill your desire.

1588
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:11,958
I had told you something.

1589
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:19,708
Love, worship, faithfulness,
determination and defects...

1590
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:22,958
they require courage.

1591
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:25,915
-Do you remember?
-Yes, I remember.

1592
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,625
But back then you didn't
let me complete what I was saying.

1593
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:29,083
You had interrupted me.

1594
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:30,708
One thing more..

1595
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:33,500
Laziness can never get rid of trouble.

1596
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:37,290
And ego can never fulfill a dream.

1597
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:44,750
So, if you have a desire
and you believe in yourself...

1598
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,875
then don't lose courage, my friend.

1599
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,208
Happiness will welcome you.

1600
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:53,708
-Don't lose courage.
-Okay, father.

1601
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:56,500
Now I won't lose courage.
I'll get going.

1602
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,583
-Don't lose courage.
-Okay.

1603
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:08,625
Don't make me break your bones
before I break Rano's alliance.

1604
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,291
What made you think
you can lay on Rano's cot?

1605
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:13,583
I didn't think. I laid here to think.

1606
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:17,083
Today you too will know
what Seetha is made up of.

1607
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:22,000
My dear, I was thinking that
we could somehow involve Daddy...

1608
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:25,915
and get you and Rano married.

1609
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,790
Daddy? Who is Daddy?

1610
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,958
The nonstop middleman.

1611
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:34,665
I can break alliances
and fix broken ones.

1612
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:37,250
They call me Daddy for a reason.

1613
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:42,958
I know them quite well.

1614
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:46,750
I can get your job done in no time.
In no time!

1615
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:48,958
But the way you have approached me..

1616
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:51,458
It will cost you.

1617
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,875
As soon as I talk to
Jailu about your match...

1618
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:57,333
I want you to give me
2100 rupees and a gold ring.

1619
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:58,916
It's difficult? Okay, no problem.

1620
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,791
I will not take 2100 rupees,
but you'll have to give me a ring.

1621
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:04,166
Well, consider your job done.

1622
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:05,208
You should leave now.

1623
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:06,583
-Go, go, go.
-Okay.

1624
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,666
Go, go.

1625
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,916
Buddy, can I say something?

1626
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:13,291
I know a lover when I see one.

1627
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,540
Go, I won't even take a ring from you.

1628
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:16,458
Do you know why?

1629
01:33:16,666 --> 01:33:18,000
I am known as Daddy.

1630
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,333
I have got such an urgent piece of
news that I came as soon as I could.

1631
01:33:22,416 --> 01:33:27,083
Now I've even got a stamp
of approval from the American Embassy.

1632
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:29,333
But you guys don't value me.

1633
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:31,875
You've incurred a huge loss
by fixing your son's marriage...

1634
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:33,500
with Jailu's niece.

1635
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:36,666
What does Jailu have? He is pauper.

1636
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,375
I have a good match.

1637
01:33:38,916 --> 01:33:40,541
The girl is from America.

1638
01:33:40,791 --> 01:33:42,416
They are giving you a car.

1639
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:45,375
And they are giving 125,000
rupees cash to the groom.

1640
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:49,458
And don't talk about gold.
They do business of gold in America.

1641
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:53,208
They said they'd give sandals
made of gold to the groom's mother.

1642
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,416
And you wear size 12.

1643
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,500
It will take a lot of gold, right?

1644
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:01,333
If you still wish to get
him married there then go ahead.

1645
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:02,416
Why should I bother?

1646
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:05,041
Go and have cauliflower
fritters at the wedding.

1647
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:09,750
I will give goat meat and
fish fritters to someone else.

1648
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,125
Why should I be concerned?

1649
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,000
Why are you standing, Daddy?
Please have a seat.

1650
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,083
Stand up!

1651
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,541
Keep the tea down and stand up!

1652
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:20,750
I'll give you a plane!

1653
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:22,375
You have such big demands!

1654
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:24,625
You should first be worthy
of making such demands!

1655
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:27,958
Why don't you just say that
you have found another match?

1656
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:30,416
You have come here to
break the alliance with Rano.

1657
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,458
Get this straight.

1658
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:35,125
Rano is my daughter.

1659
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:37,875
You won't find another girl like Rano.

1660
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:41,125
-You are misunderstanding.
-Enough!

1661
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:43,750
That is enough!

1662
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,416
Before I do anything wrong,
you better get lost from here.

1663
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:51,415
Leave!

1664
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:58,291
Seetha, I hope it didn't
happen for the worse.

1665
01:34:58,666 --> 01:35:01,000
No one from Rano's
family has shown up.

1666
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:04,290
Yes, I hope Daddy didn't
make the situation worse.

1667
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:06,833
Sukhi, I have been sitting
scared from a long time.

1668
01:35:06,916 --> 01:35:07,791
Siti is still not back.

1669
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:09,875
Aunt has already scolded me twice.

1670
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,540
Ranjha looked after the goats
for 12 years for Heer.

1671
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:12,458
Yes.

1672
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,000
Can't you wait here
for 12 hours for her?

1673
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,540
Shut up and sit down.

1674
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:17,833
-Be patient, she will come.
-Okay.

1675
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:29,333
<i>"I wish to say something,
but how do I say it?</i>

1676
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:35,125
<i>"I wish to ask something,
but how do I ask?"</i>

1677
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:44,708
<i>"She doesn't say anything..."</i>

1678
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:51,083
<i>"She doesn't say anything
to express her feelings"</i>

1679
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:58,415
<i>"My heart skips a beat
when she smiles at me"</i>

1680
01:35:58,541 --> 01:36:04,333
<i>"I am in heaven when
she smiles at me"</i>

1681
01:36:04,416 --> 01:36:11,416
<i>"My heart skips a beat
when she smiles at me"</i>

1682
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,458
<i>"We talk through our eyes every day"</i>

1683
01:36:31,541 --> 01:36:34,458
<i>"No words are exchanged"</i>

1684
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:39,916
<i>"We still haven't
shared our feelings"</i>

1685
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:49,083
<i>"We talk through our eyes every day"</i>

1686
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:52,000
<i>"No words are exchanged"</i>

1687
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:57,500
<i>"We still haven't
shared our feelings"</i>

1688
01:36:57,583 --> 01:37:00,665
<i>"She steals my heart..."</i>

1689
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:08,915
<i>"She steals my heart when
see looks at me affectionately"</i>

1690
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,500
<i>"My heart skips a beat
when she smiles at me"</i>

1691
01:37:14,666 --> 01:37:20,416
<i>"I am in heaven when
she smiles at me"</i>

1692
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:27,208
<i>"My heart skips a beat
when she smiles at me"</i>

1693
01:37:47,833 --> 01:37:53,415
<i>"I sometimes feel like being bold,
damn the consequences"</i>

1694
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:59,000
<i>"I sometimes feel like leaving
it to God, He'll unite us"</i>

1695
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:11,000
<i>"I sometimes feel like being bold,
damn the consequences"</i>

1696
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:16,375
<i>"I sometimes feel like leaving
it to God, He'll unite us"</i>

1697
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:20,750
<i>"I consider her my God"</i>

1698
01:38:22,958 --> 01:38:28,665
<i>"I consider her my God,
she resides in my ever breath"</i>

1699
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:30,875
Bye, buddy. Shindo and I are leaving.

1700
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,958
Sukhi will drop mother and Rano home.

1701
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:35,875
I am upset with you.
You still didn't have a drink with me.

1702
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,791
I won't give you an opportunity
to complain tomorrow.

1703
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:39,750
You will deceive me tomorrow as well.

1704
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:41,791
-Bye.
-Bye.

1705
01:38:47,458 --> 01:38:53,290
<i>"My heart skips a beat
when she smiles at me"</i>

1706
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:59,166
<i>"I am in heaven when
she smiles at me"</i>

1707
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:04,958
<i>"My heart skips a beat
when she smiles at me"</i>

1708
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:31,790
Move aside, boy. I'll ride it.

1709
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:34,291
Granny, you will ride the motorcycle?

1710
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:37,833
Yes, girl. What do you
think that I can only talk?

1711
01:39:37,916 --> 01:39:40,416
This is a Bullet,
granny, and not a cart.

1712
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,666
I told you right, so that's final.

1713
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:44,125
I'll ride it.

1714
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:02,500
Let's go.

1715
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:07,166
Don't forget. Meet me at 4:00am.

1716
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:08,291
I'll see.

1717
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:18,165
Tell me what did I write?

1718
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:20,583
You wrote that Rano
isn't like any other girl.

1719
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:24,958
Rano, your beauty,
your color, your gait, your nature..

1720
01:40:25,041 --> 01:40:26,416
You like it all, I know.

1721
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,208
Tell me what is it
that you don't like?

1722
01:40:28,416 --> 01:40:30,333
I don't like you staying away from me.

1723
01:40:30,416 --> 01:40:33,875
I want my day to begin
with you and end with you.

1724
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:37,375
I am madly in love with you.

1725
01:40:37,541 --> 01:40:39,208
Do you even know what love is?

1726
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:43,875
Something you cannot take
from someone on loan is called love.

1727
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:46,625
Now I shall move ahead
only with your love.

1728
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,500
I don't wish to live without you.

1729
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:51,666
I think my new life
shall begin with you.

1730
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:55,208
Now I only wait for
you to claim me as yours.

1731
01:40:55,458 --> 01:41:00,875
I have already claimed you
as mine in my heart, sweetheart.

1732
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:03,290
-Let go of me.
-Sadhu!

1733
01:41:03,583 --> 01:41:04,665
Let go of me.

1734
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,625
I think I'll have
to play this song today...

1735
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:10,958
<i>"Seek revenge if you
are what you claim to be."</i>

1736
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:12,833
Shut up, discordant.

1737
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:16,165
-Okay, Daku Nath.
-My name is Sadhu Nath.

1738
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,916
And my name is Surila and not Discordant.

1739
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:22,833
I am old enough to be your grandpa.
Let go of me.

1740
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:24,541
You don't get respect just
because you have a white beard.

1741
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:25,833
You have to earn it.

1742
01:41:25,958 --> 01:41:28,833
-Someone save me!
-Move side! Move side! Leave.

1743
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,541
-What are you doing, Chaddar?
Move side! -I'll kill him.

1744
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:33,458
I haven't wrapped any sheet around me.
I am wearing pajamas.

1745
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:35,125
I am taking his name, Chaddar.

1746
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:36,541
Come on!

1747
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:38,291
You got saved because of him today.

1748
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:40,791
Otherwise,
I would have impaled this into you!

1749
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:41,750
Look at him!

1750
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:44,500
-Don't instigate me, I'll kill you.
-Calm down.

1751
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:46,790
-What happened?
-He woke me up early in the morning.

1752
01:41:46,916 --> 01:41:48,458
He said go and call
Bakiram in the evening.

1753
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:50,333
Why did he wake me up for
something to be done in the evening?

1754
01:41:50,416 --> 01:41:51,708
Look at his deeds, uncle.

1755
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:55,208
Then come and test me. Come on.

1756
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:56,916
I'll cut you into pieces.

1757
01:41:57,083 --> 01:41:58,083
This won't work for long.

1758
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,333
You will see...

1759
01:41:59,416 --> 01:42:01,333
in future you can get things
from Delhi while sitting at home.

1760
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:04,208
Why don't you just use
airplanes to get the goods here.

1761
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:05,958
Don't think that I am lame!

1762
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:08,333
I can teach a person
a lesson with the legs I have.

1763
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,291
Chhotu!

1764
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:12,916
No need to cook anything
special for them.

1765
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:14,790
Let them survive
on what's already there.

1766
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:16,708
They think that they
are someone great.

1767
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:20,125
Sadhu! Sadhu!
Your deeds indeed deserve a beating.

1768
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:21,790
Do as you please, son.

1769
01:42:21,875 --> 01:42:24,250
Chaddar, don't hit him with a brick.

1770
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:25,790
-Just don't hit him with a brick.
-What are you doing?

1771
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:28,000
I am a very jovial person.

1772
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:29,625
I have worked in so many
weddings in your family.

1773
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:31,500
You still don't know about my nature?

1774
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:32,583
You don't understand.

1775
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:35,333
-I was just joking with him.
-Okay.

1776
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:37,250
-Let's get to work.
-Go on.

1777
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:40,208
Tie me down.
Why don't you tie me with you?

1778
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:42,375
A wedding is taking place here.
There are a lot of things to do.

1779
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:44,708
I have to sometimes go
here and sometimes go there.

1780
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:47,040
Should I inform you
before going everywhere?

1781
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:49,083
What do you think of yourself?

1782
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:51,333
But I didn't say anything to you.

1783
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:54,083
Calm down. I know that.

1784
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:57,250
But everyone should know
that the son-in-law is here.

1785
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:01,958
Go, someone like you
cannot even eat two Ladoos.

1786
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:04,541
I can eat four layers
of Barfi in a plate.

1787
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:05,666
-You want to bet?
-Bet.

1788
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:07,541
-It's on, come on.
-I'll see who makes bets.

1789
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:09,750
Special guests are coming at 5:00pm.

1790
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:12,500
Prepare for the Jagoo ceremony,
behave yourself and get to work.

1791
01:43:12,583 --> 01:43:14,875
Get them out, Fefra.

1792
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:17,291
My name is not Fefra. I am Kaleja.
How many times do I have to tell you?

1793
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:20,333
It's a part of the body, right?
Why are you getting angry?

1794
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:24,833
-How did you get the name Kaleja?
-I'll tell you.

1795
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:26,791
I know everything.

1796
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:31,291
When his mother was pregnant with him,
his parents used to fight a lot.

1797
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:33,791
They used to hit each
other with slippers and all.

1798
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:36,375
His mother used to tell her husban.d,
don't fight with me..

1799
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:38,790
I feel uneasy,
my Kaleja (liver) will pop out.

1800
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:40,708
-Then?
-He came out.

1801
01:43:40,791 --> 01:43:43,333
I'll break your jaw, I am warning you.

1802
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:46,541
You don't know,
you were very small back then.

1803
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:49,541
Someone listen to me as well. I am
the bride's father and not a servant.

1804
01:43:49,708 --> 01:43:51,540
Make sure everyone
has eaten by 2:00pm.

1805
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,041
They are just here to chat.

1806
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:59,500
Brother, the devotion with
which you serve sister-in-law...

1807
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:03,083
if you had worshiped a stone
then God would've appeared in it.

1808
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:06,708
It's just noon and you have already
made six rounds to the kitchen.

1809
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:09,583
Why don't you just bring
her and make her sit in the kitchen?

1810
01:44:09,666 --> 01:44:10,750
Till when will you keep serving her?

1811
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:13,125
This way you will do your
duty and her soul will be in peace.

1812
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:15,125
Let it be, sister.
Don't cast an evil eye on my wife.

1813
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:16,415
Eat as much as you please today.

1814
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,625
After this you will be
eating at your in-laws house.

1815
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:21,333
I say, why don't
you too have something?

1816
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:24,333
I think you will make
sure that I eat something.

1817
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:26,833
-Siti!
-Coming!

1818
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:28,540
-Yes?
-Take this.

1819
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:30,500
Sit and eat with her.

1820
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:35,416
You keep serving the girls, but you
aren't bothered serving your father.

1821
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,083
It is 5:00pm.

1822
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:38,166
Make some arrangements so that I too...

1823
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:39,416
manage to dance
at the Jagoo ceremony.

1824
01:44:39,541 --> 01:44:40,625
-It's 5:00pm?
-Yes.

1825
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:13,290
Girls, have you prepared
the lamps for Jagoo ceremony?

1826
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:15,333
Today they will know what
the maternal family can do.

1827
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:16,625
Yes, we will know...

1828
01:45:16,708 --> 01:45:18,915
whether you pay back
for the sweets you ate.

1829
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,416
Yes.

1830
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:23,833
Aunt, where's the pot
to be used for Jagoo ceremony?

1831
01:45:23,916 --> 01:45:26,125
Sukhi had brought it.
I'll go and ask him.

1832
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:27,000
Okay.

1833
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:28,415
-Sukhi!
-Take it all.

1834
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,833
Uncle, where is Sukhi?

1835
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:31,416
Sukhi? Sukhi!

1836
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,666
Over there, dear.

1837
01:45:34,666 --> 01:45:36,416
Sukhi, where is the pot
to be used for Jagoo ceremony?

1838
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:39,291
Jagoo's pot? There brother-in-law
from Nabhe is sitting on it.

1839
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:42,500
-Get up! Seetha, give the pot
to them inside. -Okay.

1840
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:47,625
Sukhi, today the maternal
family will rock the dance floor.

1841
01:45:47,791 --> 01:45:50,125
Go ahead. Sukhi isn't the one judging.

1842
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:52,833
-He is from the paternal side, right?
-Right.

1843
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,875
Today the paternal side will make
the maternal family roll like a top.

1844
01:45:55,958 --> 01:45:57,333
Get ready to swirl.

1845
01:45:57,458 --> 01:45:58,458
Sukhi!

1846
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:01,000
-Yes, father? Come here.
-Coming.

1847
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:02,666
-I am coming.
-Don't drink.

1848
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:06,958
Keep getting me drunk with your eyes,
I'll get the pot ready.

1849
01:46:07,458 --> 01:46:09,958
Seetha, look after our
brother-in-law from Nabhe.

1850
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:11,125
Okay.

1851
01:46:12,083 --> 01:46:14,958
What is it? You are having
a serious conversation with brother.

1852
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,415
He's your brother, not mine.

1853
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:19,750
Sukhi! Sukhi!

1854
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:21,250
Yes, father?

1855
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:26,583
Here, look your uncle Jailu
is drinking today at my request.

1856
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:28,375
I am very happy.

1857
01:46:29,375 --> 01:46:30,791
This is called friendship, son.

1858
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:35,375
From the time I got married, I never
behaved like a son-in-law with him.

1859
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:37,750
He's just like my brother.

1860
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:40,625
And you know why I
came back from Germany.

1861
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:41,958
For us.

1862
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:44,333
Can I leave?
I'll go and get some work done.

1863
01:46:44,416 --> 01:46:45,416
Wait.

1864
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:47,833
Have a drink,
you'll be able to work better.

1865
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:49,833
Jailu Singh, make a drink for him.

1866
01:46:49,916 --> 01:46:52,250
I know he drinks stealthily.

1867
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:54,208
No father. I stopped drinking.

1868
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:55,416
What? Since when?

1869
01:46:55,625 --> 01:46:57,375
-Who asked you to?
-What?

1870
01:46:57,541 --> 01:46:59,166
And he blushes.

1871
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:03,415
My enemies have been
taking my happiness away.

1872
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,291
Rano's alliance...
they were making demands.

1873
01:47:08,458 --> 01:47:10,208
-I called it off.
-You did the right thing.

1874
01:47:10,375 --> 01:47:11,875
You shouldn't hand your
daughter over to greedy people.

1875
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:15,415
Right. God does
everything for a reason.

1876
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:16,875
I'll be right back.

1877
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:18,958
God does everything for a reason.

1878
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,083
Son-in-law, don't do what
you did yesterday. Just go for it.

1879
01:47:26,166 --> 01:47:30,375
Don't worry about it.
Today you will see my style.

1880
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,416
Did you understand or shall I explain?

1881
01:47:33,958 --> 01:47:35,165
I will be the one
to rock the show today.

1882
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:37,666
You played a trick yesterday with us.

1883
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:42,750
Today you will see my style
when I will wear a blue sheet...

1884
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:47,915
a orange butterfly print
long shirt and green turban..

1885
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:53,790
and come on the dance floor,
it will make me double high.

1886
01:47:53,916 --> 01:47:56,750
-Nothing can be better than that.
-That's it.

1887
01:48:00,083 --> 01:48:02,540
Don't be stubborn, Jailu. He is right.

1888
01:48:04,333 --> 01:48:07,125
Drink slowly,
don't drink all of it in one shot.

1889
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:11,415
Don't say anything, you troublemaker.

1890
01:48:12,083 --> 01:48:13,875
Jailu, stop this.

1891
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,165
Stop this.

1892
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:16,790
Here.

1893
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:18,458
-This fine?
-Yes.

1894
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,541
What are you girls calculating?

1895
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:21,666
Lift it and give it to the aunt.

1896
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:23,208
Hurry up, we have to
get up early in the morning...

1897
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:25,083
and make preparations as well.

1898
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:25,875
Here you go.

1899
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:30,290
<i>"Brighten up your life,
Jagoo is here"</i>

1900
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:33,250
<i>"This is great, Jagoo is here"</i>

1901
01:48:33,333 --> 01:48:36,290
<i>"This is great, Jagoo is here"</i>

1902
01:48:36,416 --> 01:48:39,333
<i>"Keep quiet, I have just
put my baby girl to sleep"</i>

1903
01:48:39,416 --> 01:48:42,833
<i>"I sung a lullaby to her.
She will wake up. She will cry"</i>

1904
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:48,000
Stop it! Stop it!
Jagoo is here. Jagoo is here.

1905
01:48:48,083 --> 01:48:49,415
What should we stop?

1906
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:53,333
No, I mean Chaddar made me climb up.

1907
01:48:53,416 --> 01:48:57,041
Now I cannot come down.
I too wish to dance.

1908
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:59,958
Jagoo is here. Come on.

1909
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:02,791
<i>"This is great, Jagoo is here"</i>

1910
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:04,625
There, they have started.

1911
01:49:04,958 --> 01:49:06,958
As if you cannot celebrate
Jagoo without singing.

1912
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:09,875
It's okay, young kids like it.

1913
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:12,708
You don't need to look at Jagoo.

1914
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:13,916
What did you say?

1915
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:14,833
It's nothing.

1916
01:49:14,916 --> 01:49:17,333
He didn't say anything.
Keep drinking. I'll be right back.

1917
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:25,250
"Don't you stare at me, oh boy"

1918
01:49:25,375 --> 01:49:28,375
"I am known to have fire in my eyes"

1919
01:49:30,916 --> 01:49:33,708
"Don't you stare at me, oh boy"

1920
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:36,541
"I am known to have fire in my eyes"

1921
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:39,333
"I'll give you sleepless nights"

1922
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:42,208
"I'll give you sleepless nights"

1923
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:45,625
"I'll get ingrained in your heart"

1924
01:49:46,416 --> 01:49:49,208
"My beauty is as
famous with the boys..."

1925
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:52,000
"As the sheikh of
Dubai is in the world"

1926
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:54,833
"My beauty is as
famous with the boys..."

1927
01:49:54,916 --> 01:49:57,708
"As the sheikh of
Dubai is in the world"

1928
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,541
"My beauty is as
famous with the boys..."

1929
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:03,750
"As the sheikh of
Dubai is in the world"

1930
01:50:06,416 --> 01:50:09,708
"I'll cross the biggest hurdle"

1931
01:50:09,833 --> 01:50:13,000
"Don't test my courage, oh beautiful"

1932
01:50:14,916 --> 01:50:18,250
"I'll cross the biggest hurdle"

1933
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:20,625
"Don't test my courage, oh beautiful"

1934
01:50:20,708 --> 01:50:23,750
"I agree that you are
mesmerizingly beautiful"

1935
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:26,291
"I agree that you are
mesmerizingly beautiful"

1936
01:50:26,416 --> 01:50:28,916
"Everyone is eager to steal it"

1937
01:50:29,083 --> 01:50:32,000
"I'll come in handy
to protect your beauty"

1938
01:50:32,166 --> 01:50:34,875
"I am a quick-tempered Jatt"

1939
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:37,833
"-I'll come in handy to protect your beauty
-Wonderful"

1940
01:50:37,916 --> 01:50:40,458
"I am a quick-tempered Jatt"

1941
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:43,375
"I'll come in handy
to protect your beauty"

1942
01:50:43,458 --> 01:50:47,165
"I am a quick-tempered Jatt"

1943
01:50:48,166 --> 01:50:49,416
"Wonderful"

1944
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,666
"I don't know how to settle for less"

1945
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:06,541
"Tell me, do you want my life?"

1946
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:09,708
"Do you want my life?"

1947
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:15,000
"I don't know how to settle for less"

1948
01:51:15,166 --> 01:51:17,916
"Tell me, do you want my life?"

1949
01:51:18,083 --> 01:51:20,833
"Do you want my life?"

1950
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:23,708
"You have broken many hearts"

1951
01:51:23,833 --> 01:51:26,165
"You have broken many hearts"

1952
01:51:26,291 --> 01:51:29,958
"-Saying such sweet words
- Wonderful"

1953
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:34,833
"I'll come in handy
to protect your beauty"

1954
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:37,666
"My beauty is as
famous with the boys..."

1955
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:40,500
"-I'll come in handy to protect your beauty
-Wonderful"

1956
01:51:40,666 --> 01:51:43,375
"I am a quick-tempered Jatt."

1957
01:51:43,458 --> 01:51:46,290
"As the sheikh of
Dubai is in the world."

1958
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:49,125
"I'll come in handy
to protect your beauty."

1959
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:51,958
"I am a quick-tempered Jatt."

1960
01:51:53,833 --> 01:51:54,875
"Oh my!"

1961
01:52:03,208 --> 01:52:04,208
"Wonderful."

1962
01:52:09,833 --> 01:52:12,375
Mind your language, Jailu!

1963
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,541
Otherwise, I'll throw you down.

1964
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:16,958
Those who want to
throw me down will die.

1965
01:52:17,041 --> 01:52:19,166
Who are you?

1966
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:21,625
You keep saying, drink less.
Don't drink more.

1967
01:52:21,708 --> 01:52:24,415
You idiot,
I had told you for your own good.

1968
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,916
My own good?
Are you King Harish Chandra?

1969
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:31,000
The Europeans threw
you out of Germany.

1970
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:35,290
You came here with nothing.
There you used to wash utensils.

1971
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:36,666
And here you behave like a big man.

1972
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:40,125
What's wrong with that?
I am a big man.

1973
01:52:40,458 --> 01:52:44,333
The boy's family asked for a car.
I am not as cheapskate as you...

1974
01:52:44,416 --> 01:52:46,458
that I'd break the alliance
of my girl for that reason.

1975
01:52:46,541 --> 01:52:48,333
-What did you say?
-Yes.

1976
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:51,833
-No! No!
-You are our guest!

1977
01:52:51,958 --> 01:52:56,208
-I'll see you!
-What will you see?

1978
01:52:56,291 --> 01:53:00,083
-I'll get you!
-Calm down.

1979
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:03,583
-Seetha! What is happening?
-Let me go!

1980
01:53:04,083 --> 01:53:07,458
-Let me go! I'll show him.
-It's okay. Calm down.

1981
01:53:07,875 --> 01:53:11,250
-Let it go.
-Let me go! I'll go and break his head. Let me go!

1982
01:53:12,166 --> 01:53:15,291
You were thrown out of Germany.
You taunt me!

1983
01:53:15,416 --> 01:53:18,375
I didn't get the girl married and all.

1984
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,666
I got insulted.

1985
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:23,541
No one insulted you.

1986
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,416
Jailu, what are you doing?

1987
01:53:25,583 --> 01:53:27,625
You have done it again?
You ruined everything.

1988
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:29,500
You are so old yet you
cannot keep a drink down.

1989
01:53:29,583 --> 01:53:32,833
Why don't you teach me
how to drink in your school?

1990
01:53:32,916 --> 01:53:36,708
This is how you drink less.
This is how you drink more.

1991
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:40,750
You have started lecturing me as
if I've been drinking imported liquor.

1992
01:53:40,833 --> 01:53:43,333
He cannot digest it.
That's why he doesn't drink.

1993
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,333
Let me go!
Why are you still standing here?

1994
01:53:45,416 --> 01:53:47,708
Are you shackled here?
Come home with me.

1995
01:53:47,791 --> 01:53:49,875
-We will go.
-We'll never come back!

1996
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,333
Go away! We don't want
rich folks like you either.

1997
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:57,500
-Shindo, take this king home.
-You shut up. Stop it.

1998
01:53:57,583 --> 01:53:59,625
-Come on.
-I don't beg to anyone.

1999
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:01,833
-Come with me, buddy. Come on.
-Bring the girl along.

2000
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:05,250
Take her away.
We aren't making your Rano work here.

2001
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,458
Don't go anywhere, dear. Stay here.

2002
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:08,416
Don't worry about him.

2003
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:10,833
He will get sober tomorrow
and forget everything.

2004
01:54:10,916 --> 01:54:12,541
Someone will drop you home later.

2005
01:54:12,625 --> 01:54:14,583
It's considered an
ill omen till something...

2006
01:54:14,666 --> 01:54:17,666
like this doesn't
happen at a wedding.

2007
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:19,375
It's nothing. Come on, let's go.

2008
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:21,625
Come on, everyone. Let's go, everyone.

2009
01:54:21,791 --> 01:54:24,250
Nothing happened. Oh God. Come on.

2010
01:54:24,333 --> 01:54:26,375
Run away, Jailu. Run away.

2011
01:54:26,458 --> 01:54:29,375
I'll have tackled many like you.

2012
01:54:29,916 --> 01:54:32,500
I am your brother-in-law.

2013
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:35,415
I'll not spare you.

2014
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:38,665
We'll teach him a lesson,
damn the consequences.

2015
01:55:01,083 --> 01:55:03,250
This old men have
caused a new problem.

2016
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:13,750
-We'll get them! Sukhi, we'll..
-What will you get?

2017
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:15,833
We'll get them!

2018
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:18,500
Yes, that's what I am saying!

2019
01:55:18,583 --> 01:55:20,415
We'll get them!

2020
01:55:24,708 --> 01:55:28,833
<i>"If uncles don't fight
and sulk for importance..."</i>

2021
01:55:28,916 --> 01:55:33,625
<i>"If the new son-in-law
doesn't get sloshed..."</i>

2022
01:55:33,916 --> 01:55:38,916
<i>"You won't get such a lot collection
of drunkard anywhere else..."</i>

2023
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,208
<i>"It's not a wedding, till you
don't gather cots and mattresses"</i>

2024
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:46,166
Why are you crying
and ruining your mood?

2025
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,291
Uncle is always like this.

2026
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:49,791
That's why we don't let him drink.

2027
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:50,958
Stop crying now.

2028
01:55:52,333 --> 01:55:54,958
What if he doesn't
let you come here tomorrow?

2029
01:55:55,875 --> 01:55:57,666
He cannot stop me from
coming here tomorrow.

2030
01:55:57,916 --> 01:55:59,708
And then Sukhi is smart.

2031
01:55:59,833 --> 01:56:01,540
Tomorrow he will convince
uncle to attend as well.

2032
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:12,875
This is a big mess.

2033
01:56:13,083 --> 01:56:15,958
Bholi will get married
but what will happen to us?

2034
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:21,166
I am not worried about that.

2035
01:56:21,708 --> 01:56:25,250
The person who can break my alliance,
can do anything for me.

2036
01:56:25,333 --> 01:56:27,875
I didn't.
Why would I break your alliance?

2037
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:29,833
Don't try to act smart.

2038
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:31,166
Hit the brakes, we have reached home.

2039
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:33,208
Or do you wish to
tour the whole village?

2040
01:56:35,166 --> 01:56:38,416
I wish to tour the
whole world with you.

2041
01:56:39,958 --> 01:56:43,000
What color dress are you
wearing tomorrow for the wedding?

2042
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:44,208
Why should I tell you?

2043
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:52,958
Wear a blue color turban tomorrow.

2044
01:56:53,208 --> 01:56:55,833
And yes, wear a coat.

2045
01:56:56,083 --> 01:56:59,083
Don't wear a waistcoat
with a tie and get ridiculed.

2046
01:57:00,708 --> 01:57:01,958
Go now.

2047
01:57:02,041 --> 01:57:03,625
You have to get up early tomorrow.

2048
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:05,916
Uncle Jailu will allow
you to come tomorrow?

2049
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,333
I know how I have to come.

2050
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:08,916
Okay.

2051
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:10,750
Then good night.

2052
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:13,291
And I love you.

2053
01:57:14,375 --> 01:57:15,166
Shameless fellow.

2054
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:17,375
You won't leave so easily. Uncle..

2055
01:57:17,458 --> 01:57:18,333
Please come outside.

2056
01:57:18,416 --> 01:57:20,083
Look, there's someone
unknown at the door.

2057
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:21,540
As if I am scared of uncle.

2058
01:57:21,625 --> 01:57:22,291
Uncle!

2059
01:57:22,375 --> 01:57:24,000
No, I've come to the wrong address.

2060
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:27,000
Stupid.

2061
01:57:32,541 --> 01:57:36,208
Finally, here lies Sindal from
Nabhe on the historic cot.

2062
01:57:36,291 --> 01:57:37,500
Stand up.

2063
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:39,415
How many times have I told
you not to sit on this cot?

2064
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,166
Friendship also has some limits.

2065
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:43,083
Then you can wear
the waistcoat tomorrow.

2066
01:57:43,541 --> 01:57:46,291
Hey, you start threatening
me at every point.

2067
01:57:47,041 --> 01:57:51,250
Listen, I have arranged
for blue turban from uncle.

2068
01:57:51,375 --> 01:57:53,500
But she wants me to wear a coat.

2069
01:57:53,583 --> 01:57:54,708
Arrange for a coat.

2070
01:57:54,875 --> 01:57:56,333
This is what I wanted to tell you.

2071
01:57:56,541 --> 01:57:58,875
Sindal from Nabhe has a coat.

2072
01:58:00,833 --> 01:58:02,208
Then step on his tail.

2073
01:58:02,291 --> 01:58:05,000
He says Sukhi...

2074
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:12,333
Sukhi, brother-in-law from
Nabhe will be the best tomorrow.

2075
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:17,125
He'll put all the guests to
shame when he'll wear a coat tomorrow.

2076
01:58:17,208 --> 01:58:19,625
And you will wear this waistcoat.

2077
01:58:19,708 --> 01:58:21,583
Don't touch the waistcoat.

2078
01:58:21,708 --> 01:58:26,500
I spent the whole day and hunted
down this waistcoat from Cohra market.

2079
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:28,165
A coat is nothing great.

2080
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:31,333
Every second person wears
a coat during a wedding nowadays.

2081
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:33,875
Even the waiters wear coats.

2082
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,291
The one who wears a waistcoat
is the one who exhibits style.

2083
01:58:36,375 --> 01:58:37,750
The one who wears a waistcoat.

2084
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:41,040
Sukhi... Give me the waistcoat.

2085
01:58:41,166 --> 01:58:43,083
I won't give it, brother-in-law.

2086
01:58:43,166 --> 01:58:46,041
Sukhi, give me the waistcoat.

2087
01:58:46,291 --> 01:58:48,583
I won't give it, brother-in-law.

2088
01:58:48,666 --> 01:58:52,708
Sukhi... I said give me the waistcoat.

2089
01:58:52,833 --> 01:58:54,165
Do you understand or shall I explain?

2090
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:58,458
Okay so you mean you
will wear Sukhi's waistcoat...

2091
01:58:58,666 --> 01:59:01,083
Then what will he wear, your coat?

2092
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:02,791
He'll have to wear it.

2093
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:06,500
I won't give it, brother-in-law.

2094
01:59:06,875 --> 01:59:08,208
Give it, Sukhi.

2095
01:59:08,291 --> 01:59:12,333
Otherwise, brother-in-law will
shout and gather the whole village.

2096
01:59:12,416 --> 01:59:15,458
-Oh yes, I should shout.
-No, brother-in-law.

2097
01:59:15,541 --> 01:59:17,250
-Take this waistcoat. Take it.
-Give it.

2098
01:59:21,541 --> 01:59:22,583
Coat.

2099
01:59:23,583 --> 01:59:25,708
Brother-in-law, where is the coat?

2100
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:30,040
Brother-in-law, where is the coat?

2101
01:59:30,208 --> 01:59:31,458
In the cupboard.

2102
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:34,125
The coat is in the cupboard.

2103
01:59:36,208 --> 01:59:37,625
Dongra, you?

2104
01:59:37,708 --> 01:59:39,958
Jeona, here are two turbans.

2105
01:59:40,041 --> 01:59:43,958
If you make Kishan and
Dogar brothers again tomorrow...

2106
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:45,916
then Rano will be yours.

2107
01:59:54,083 --> 01:59:55,333
Well done, Dongra.

2108
01:59:56,541 --> 01:59:58,250
That's a great scheme.

2109
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:06,208
Chaddar, what if his
Chocolate Barfi isn't tasty?

2110
02:00:06,291 --> 02:00:08,333
Then you will see him sitting on ice.

2111
02:00:08,791 --> 02:00:12,916
Chaddar, the way Sadhu
is praying, I feel...

2112
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,250
that he will sit on the ice.

2113
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:20,625
Whatever you may say,
this old man is quite entertaining.

2114
02:00:20,708 --> 02:00:23,250
-He has a few odd habits.
-True.

2115
02:00:23,375 --> 02:00:31,125
But there's one thing,
if Sadhu wins the Barfi match..

2116
02:00:32,083 --> 02:00:36,165
then his name will echo
in our ears like Manak's songs.

2117
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:50,500
<i>"Barfi"</i>

2118
02:00:50,583 --> 02:00:53,833
Now you want me to wear the
turban sent by Jailu at the wedding?

2119
02:00:55,416 --> 02:00:57,875
This means you didn't
come from Germany for us.

2120
02:00:58,166 --> 02:01:00,416
Are you trying to
get me closer to Jailu..

2121
02:01:00,833 --> 02:01:02,875
or are you fearing that
you'll get distanced from someone?

2122
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:06,708
Both.

2123
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:08,750
I said I don't want to go.

2124
02:01:08,833 --> 02:01:10,208
You don't understand it.

2125
02:01:10,791 --> 02:01:12,416
You have a right to be angry.

2126
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,583
How is it right?

2127
02:01:13,666 --> 02:01:15,458
It is not right. It is not right.

2128
02:01:15,791 --> 02:01:17,500
It is your wish, Jailu.

2129
02:01:17,583 --> 02:01:19,415
But think about it.

2130
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:21,166
Hello, uncle Jailu.

2131
02:01:21,458 --> 02:01:22,250
Hello.

2132
02:01:22,333 --> 02:01:23,875
What are you thinking about?

2133
02:01:23,958 --> 02:01:25,415
What do you want from me?

2134
02:01:26,125 --> 02:01:28,875
No, I don't want anything.
I have come to give you something.

2135
02:01:28,958 --> 02:01:31,790
Uncle has sent an apology.

2136
02:01:32,166 --> 02:01:34,125
Sukhi's father.

2137
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:37,083
Look, both of you made a mistake.

2138
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:40,166
He stopped you from
drinking and you were rude.

2139
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:42,291
Then you two had an argument.

2140
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:49,083
Uncle has sent this turban.

2141
02:01:50,958 --> 02:01:53,333
Keep it. He scored brownie
points by apologizing.

2142
02:01:53,416 --> 02:01:56,125
He said that if Jailu
wears this turban and comes...

2143
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:59,290
then I'll attend the wedding
otherwise I'll go back immediately.

2144
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:04,958
Who is in the bathroom?

2145
02:02:05,041 --> 02:02:06,666
I have been standing
here since one hour.

2146
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:09,708
Who wants to get into trouble?
Your brother-in-law is having a bath.

2147
02:02:09,833 --> 02:02:11,665
I'll take some time.

2148
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:13,291
I have a huge body.

2149
02:02:13,375 --> 02:02:15,750
Do you understand or shall I explain?

2150
02:02:15,875 --> 02:02:17,833
I'll come out and tell you.

2151
02:02:17,916 --> 02:02:18,916
Go to hell!

2152
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:22,291
Sister-in-law,
where have you kept Bholi's jewellery?

2153
02:02:22,791 --> 02:02:24,500
Oh, yes. Here are the keys.

2154
02:02:24,833 --> 02:02:26,040
Get them out from the trunk.

2155
02:02:26,125 --> 02:02:28,125
I'll go and give tea to the priest.

2156
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:01,208
Why hasn't Rano come?

2157
02:03:49,291 --> 02:03:52,458
Seethe, uncle Jailu
hasn't come as yet.

2158
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:58,708
He is here.

2159
02:04:03,583 --> 02:04:05,665
Come on, greet each other.

2160
02:04:10,375 --> 02:04:13,666
They aren't even looking at each other.
Getting them to talk seems impossible.

2161
02:04:16,375 --> 02:04:18,000
We'll have to think of a scheme.

2162
02:04:20,208 --> 02:04:21,290
I'll talk to Daddy.

2163
02:04:27,875 --> 02:04:30,416
Siti, what you did
with me was not right.

2164
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,708
Damn you, I'll teach you a lesson.

2165
02:04:32,791 --> 02:04:35,125
You come here applying
kohl in your big eyes.

2166
02:04:35,208 --> 02:04:38,500
Applying kohl in your big eyes.
I'll teach you a lesson today.

2167
02:04:38,583 --> 02:04:41,415
Damn you, you shouldn't
ruin other people's marriage.

2168
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:42,875
Did anyone see this?

2169
02:04:44,708 --> 02:04:46,500
-Have you seen Siti anywhere?
-Get lost.

2170
02:04:47,166 --> 02:04:48,791
Coat doesn't look good.

2171
02:04:49,125 --> 02:04:50,500
What happened, Sukhi?

2172
02:04:50,666 --> 02:04:52,333
I have spoken to Daddy.

2173
02:04:52,458 --> 02:04:54,208
He had made a plan.

2174
02:04:54,416 --> 02:04:57,041
He has made a plane?
Daddy also started making plane?

2175
02:04:57,166 --> 02:05:00,041
-Here son, have some sweets.
-Yes.

2176
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:09,208
Well done.
You have made very tasty Barfi.

2177
02:05:09,291 --> 02:05:11,541
Father, give him 100 rupees.

2178
02:05:11,625 --> 02:05:14,083
-Sure, son.
-Thank you god.

2179
02:05:14,333 --> 02:05:15,625
-Thank you very much.
-Take it.

2180
02:05:15,791 --> 02:05:16,791
Give me this.

2181
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:19,333
Let it be, father.
You might lose it.

2182
02:05:20,208 --> 02:05:22,000
-He did it.
-Come here.

2183
02:05:22,083 --> 02:05:26,165
Chaddar, your instigation worked.

2184
02:05:26,291 --> 02:05:29,666
Instigation ruins everything.
I had told father that.

2185
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:32,333
He said I will apologize but...

2186
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:35,958
If and buts only ruin things.

2187
02:05:36,041 --> 02:05:38,708
Jailu says let's shake hands once.

2188
02:05:38,791 --> 02:05:40,250
No, no, no.

2189
02:05:40,458 --> 02:05:42,875
I won't shake hands with
that man who thinks he is great.

2190
02:05:43,333 --> 02:05:46,165
I'll stand next to him if you say.

2191
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:47,250
There is no problem
in standing next to him.

2192
02:05:47,333 --> 02:05:48,333
There should be no problem.

2193
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:50,000
It's not like you both fired canons.

2194
02:05:50,083 --> 02:05:53,083
If you two had an India
Pakistan kind of a war...

2195
02:05:53,166 --> 02:05:54,416
then too I would have
made you two compromise.

2196
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:57,125
Ask why? Friendship shouldn't end.

2197
02:05:57,208 --> 02:05:59,165
Let's go.
The wedding vows are about to begin.

2198
02:06:08,208 --> 02:06:09,665
So Tota, did you get Siti?

2199
02:06:09,791 --> 02:06:10,708
Get lost.

2200
02:06:10,791 --> 02:06:12,375
Everyone's daughters
and sisters are like our own.

2201
02:06:12,458 --> 02:06:14,665
Really? You learnt that
after getting your wings clipped?

2202
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:15,666
Get lost.

2203
02:06:17,041 --> 02:06:18,125
I don't want to eat fritters.

2204
02:06:18,333 --> 02:06:19,875
I didn't offer them to you.

2205
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:22,125
No, I mean don't I want
to eat fritters?

2206
02:06:25,041 --> 02:06:26,041
You scared me.

2207
02:06:26,166 --> 02:06:28,458
Both of them sat together
during the wedding vows.

2208
02:06:28,666 --> 02:06:31,125
God have mercy and may
they unite in such a way...

2209
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:32,415
that they never fall apart again.

2210
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:33,958
Leave. I'll go and get the report.

2211
02:06:34,041 --> 02:06:35,041
-Go ahead.
-I will.

2212
02:06:35,125 --> 02:06:36,291
It was a pleasure talking to you.

2213
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:37,833
You should.

2214
02:06:57,416 --> 02:07:01,041
I wouldn't give it to the
biggest enemy if I am forced.

2215
02:07:01,125 --> 02:07:03,625
Take it if you want
but take it out of love.

2216
02:07:03,708 --> 02:07:06,208
I'll be ready to lay down
at the feet for love.

2217
02:07:06,291 --> 02:07:08,791
But for someone who has fake pride...

2218
02:07:08,958 --> 02:07:13,790
I hurt them so bad
that they end up sighing.

2219
02:07:14,041 --> 02:07:18,875
I break friendship with someone
who always says hurtful things.

2220
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:23,875
And I cannot be friends
with someone who talks nonsense.

2221
02:07:28,458 --> 02:07:30,125
These men who are breaking plates...

2222
02:07:30,208 --> 02:07:32,040
can be controlled only
by those who wash plates.

2223
02:07:32,208 --> 02:07:33,290
Where is Daddy?

2224
02:07:33,625 --> 02:07:36,625
Don't ruin Rano and Sukhi's life
because of the fight between the elders.

2225
02:07:36,708 --> 02:07:38,250
Both of you should stick together.

2226
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:41,000
Ladies can make the governments fall.

2227
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:43,333
You won't find a
daughter-in-law as good as Rano.

2228
02:07:43,458 --> 02:07:45,583
You won't find a son-in-law
as good as Sukhi. Right?

2229
02:07:45,791 --> 02:07:46,666
Tell me about it!

2230
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:50,375
What could be better than the
fact that they both like each other?

2231
02:07:50,791 --> 02:07:52,833
But who will talk to their fathers?

2232
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:54,958
Now only the one who talks
nonstop can talk to them.

2233
02:07:55,041 --> 02:07:58,375
-Who can talk better than him?
-Yes.

2234
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:01,875
I had gone to your wives
to discuss your fight.

2235
02:08:01,958 --> 02:08:03,625
But the scolded me.

2236
02:08:03,708 --> 02:08:05,083
They said let them fight.

2237
02:08:05,291 --> 02:08:08,541
But we have fixed another
match at this wedding.

2238
02:08:08,625 --> 02:08:09,458
Who's match?

2239
02:08:10,375 --> 02:08:11,375
Sukhi and Rano.

2240
02:08:11,458 --> 02:08:12,833
Don't make me break your bones.

2241
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,583
What is the fault of my bones?

2242
02:08:14,666 --> 02:08:15,750
It was my tongue
which said these things.

2243
02:08:15,833 --> 02:08:17,165
I'll pull your tongue out.

2244
02:08:17,416 --> 02:08:20,500
Why my tongue?
Your wives said so. I didn't say it.

2245
02:08:21,041 --> 02:08:23,625
And even God cannot go against women.
How can you against them?

2246
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:26,000
If you want to try then go ahead.
How will it hurt me?

2247
02:08:26,166 --> 02:08:28,791
In Ludhiana too a man
tried to go against his wife.

2248
02:08:28,875 --> 02:08:31,125
She committed suicide and
left a suicide note saying..

2249
02:08:31,208 --> 02:08:32,875
This sinner is
responsible for my death.

2250
02:08:32,958 --> 02:08:35,665
The decision is in your hands. I
am just middleman, I have a lot to do.

2251
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:37,083
Do as you please.

2252
02:08:38,083 --> 02:08:39,125
Gareya.

2253
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
When friendship becomes
weak even the mute start talking.

2254
02:08:44,333 --> 02:08:49,833
I had called you so that I could
drink with you and also hint you.

2255
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,583
But you drank alcohol
and started insulting me.

2256
02:08:52,708 --> 02:08:53,790
You forgot what you did?

2257
02:08:53,916 --> 02:08:55,250
When you had come
here to get married.

2258
02:08:55,416 --> 02:08:59,000
You got drunk and even lost all money
while playing cards with the guests.

2259
02:08:59,208 --> 02:09:00,415
I got them back for you.

2260
02:09:00,625 --> 02:09:03,458
You forgot about the Lala's goons
that surrounded you in the market?

2261
02:09:03,583 --> 02:09:05,708
I had saved you back then, Jailu.

2262
02:09:05,875 --> 02:09:08,166
Who got insulted after
losing the headman elections?

2263
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:09,916
You had, Gareya. You had!

2264
02:09:10,833 --> 02:09:12,375
If you had to say such things...

2265
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:15,041
then why did you send
this turban I am wearing?

2266
02:09:15,166 --> 02:09:16,166
I didn't send it.

2267
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:17,708
You sent the one I am wearing.

2268
02:09:17,833 --> 02:09:20,708
I won't give you a piece of
rag and you say I gave you a turban?

2269
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:22,958
-This is a limit, what does
he think of himself. -Wait a minute.

2270
02:09:23,208 --> 02:09:25,000
You didn't send me a turban
and I didn't send a turban to you.

2271
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:27,083
-Yes.
-Then who sent these turbans?

2272
02:09:27,333 --> 02:09:28,750
I had sent them.

2273
02:09:29,041 --> 02:09:31,750
When two heads
take the wrong path...

2274
02:09:31,875 --> 02:09:34,833
then you need turbans
to bring them on the right tracks.

2275
02:09:35,041 --> 02:09:37,958
I had sent the turbans
to mend your relationship.

2276
02:09:38,166 --> 02:09:40,208
To fix our relationship or yours?

2277
02:09:41,458 --> 02:09:44,000
You're trying to benefit yourself,
when two cats are fighting right?

2278
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:49,833
Okay, that's why your turban
color matches Rano's dress.

2279
02:09:49,958 --> 02:09:52,708
No, this is just a coincidence.

2280
02:09:52,916 --> 02:09:56,666
We value our elder's honor
and pride more than our desires.

2281
02:09:56,958 --> 02:09:59,250
Yes, whether or not
we two get together...

2282
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:01,625
but you two
shouldn't get separated.

2283
02:10:01,916 --> 02:10:05,958
What Rano means to say
is that our family should be one.

2284
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,833
Gareya, if you had been
even a little smart as your son...

2285
02:10:09,666 --> 02:10:10,833
then things would
have been different today.

2286
02:10:11,125 --> 02:10:13,916
And would it harm you if you had
borrowed some sense from your niece?

2287
02:10:14,125 --> 02:10:16,875
Look, it is an auspicious day,
talk about fixing our wedding.

2288
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,083
Just don't keep
exchanging insults.

2289
02:10:19,208 --> 02:10:22,125
Hey, when did you become so smart?

2290
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:23,915
Ever since you
came back from Germany.

2291
02:10:24,375 --> 02:10:26,416
And you know why you
came back from Germany.

2292
02:10:26,625 --> 02:10:29,500
Yes, you had come
back to fix our marriage.

2293
02:10:29,625 --> 02:10:31,833
I don't accept this alliance.

2294
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I don't like the girl.

2295
02:10:33,125 --> 02:10:35,916
Gareya, don't say
anything against my niece.

2296
02:10:36,208 --> 02:10:37,250
Now this marriage will
take place at any cost.

2297
02:10:37,375 --> 02:10:38,291
Okay, as you say.

2298
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,791
-What?
-I agree with you.

2299
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:43,416
Stop making those noises
and give a hug to him.

2300
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:46,375
Decide what do you
want to demand and all.

2301
02:10:46,625 --> 02:10:48,708
I demand a cot and mattress.

2302
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:51,750
And what about the one who
had said yes for the cot and mattress?

2303
02:10:51,916 --> 02:10:54,375
What will I do with the
cot and mattress without her?

2304
02:10:55,541 --> 02:10:57,333
Here, eat the Chocolate Barfi.

2305
02:10:57,541 --> 02:10:59,041
Sadhu Nath did it!

2306
02:10:59,208 --> 02:11:01,000
Bring it here. Show it to me.

2307
02:11:01,666 --> 02:11:03,416
-Here you go.
-Sukhi, try the Chocolate Barfi.

2308
02:11:03,541 --> 02:11:04,416
Oh!

2309
02:11:04,541 --> 02:11:06,541
Book Nath and
give him an advance...

2310
02:11:06,666 --> 02:11:10,333
for Sukhi and Rano, he shouldn't
get a chance to refuse later.

2311
02:11:10,458 --> 02:11:12,040
If he refuses,
we will drag him here.

2312
02:11:12,166 --> 02:11:13,958
He doesn't know what
we are made up of.

2313
02:11:14,875 --> 02:11:16,041
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

2314
02:11:16,166 --> 02:11:18,250
I'll gather the cots and
mattresses at Sukhi's wedding.

2315
02:11:18,583 --> 02:11:21,583
It is not a big thing
to gather cots and mattresses.

2316
02:11:21,833 --> 02:11:23,415
It is a very big thing.

2317
02:11:23,666 --> 02:11:25,875
The cots and mattresses
got the north and the south.

2318
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,333
Isn't that a big deal?

2319
02:11:28,625 --> 02:11:31,166
Cots and mattresses remind me...

2320
02:11:31,333 --> 02:11:33,958
back then I was with Jeona Morh.

2321
02:11:34,208 --> 02:11:35,040
When I was a kid?

2322
02:11:35,166 --> 02:11:37,041
No son,
you didn't exist back then.

2323
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:41,708
Once a few boys got together...

2324
02:11:41,833 --> 02:11:44,290
and went to gather cots
and mattresses for a wedding.

2325
02:11:44,416 --> 02:11:47,166
We went on walking.
We went on walking.

2326
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:48,250
Father,
you must have reached by now.

2327
02:11:48,375 --> 02:11:50,958
No. We went on walking.
We reached now.

2328
02:11:52,333 --> 02:11:54,790
When we reached there,
and I touched a cot...

2329
02:11:54,916 --> 02:11:57,083
their daughter
said keep the cot down.

2330
02:11:57,416 --> 02:11:59,208
I told him that
I am a confectioner.

2331
02:11:59,291 --> 02:12:03,416
Once I keep the wok on fire,
then I don't stop cooking.

2332
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:07,708
She said that my father
owns a grocery store.

02:12:07,833 --> 02:12:10,250
We don't give anything
for free to anyone.

2334
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:17,583
I said then let's strike a
deal by exchanging a few sweet words.

2335

02:12:22,583 --> 02:12:23,583

02:12:40,125 --> 02:12:43,208
-You were...
-A kid back then.
