1
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:01,398
No. 5, turn it away...
some more.

2
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,660
Away from your eyes,
or you'll be blinded.

3
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:58,205
Darkness in a place which
supplies power, all over!

4
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,846
There were power-failures
earlier also.

5
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:03,783
But it's getting too
frequent now, Mr. Gupta.

6
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,087
We've had a shortage
of monsoons this year.

7
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:09,852
That's the tragedy of this country.
Stepping into the 21st century...

8
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,394
we still have our hopes
pinned on the monsoons!

9
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,326
Not to be offended, Mr. Gupta.
But if this happened in America...

10
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:20,130
people there would sue
the power supplying companies.

11
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,330
This is not America...

12
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:26,634
although I strongly wish we could
make more progress than America.

13
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:29,380
That's not happening for
another 500 years.

14
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:33,211
That's going to happen
in the next 20 years.

15
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:40,723
Good night, sir.

16
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:46,158
Have you had dinner?
- I don't feel hungry at all.

17
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:55,696
Uncle...
- Don't disturb me. I'm not hungry!

18
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,967
But I'm hungry and I'm going
to eat dinner with you tonight.

19
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:03,170
Now look; your father
paid me for a year.

20
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,212
And you've been paying me
for 2 years after his death...

21
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:10,454
not to make me eat and go to sleep.
It is to make me prove something.

22
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:13,823
You change colors like the chameleon.
Yesterday, you told me that...

23
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:16,620
you had promised my dad nothing
about proving yourself.

24
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,362
That you would do your research,
notwithstanding the results.

25
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:24,461
Didn't you say that to me?
Didn't you?

26
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:31,435
The truth is that research itself
is enough.

27
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:35,109
Whether you achieve something or not.

28
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:39,575
Whether you spend years or ages,
it makes no difference.

29
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:46,750
Research is a passion.
It's an obsession...

30
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:50,086
the one doing it is lost in.

31
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:53,722
So it's necessary for you
to keep reminding me...

32
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:57,491
that I come up with results.
So that you gain something...

33
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:00,762
I gain something and
so does the world. Okay?

34
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,635
Now go and sit there.
Go on.

35
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:06,242
How about food?
- I'll eat with you. Go on now.

36
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:38,108
Kailash! Welcome!

37
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:40,505
Asha, look who's here!

38
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:45,215
Kailash, you must visit us sometimes.
Ever since your father has died...

39
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,783
you have stopped coming
to our place.

40
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:50,547
You must keep in touch.
We're your own people.

41
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:02,830
Asha, where were you
all this time?

42
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:07,070
Ask him, dad! He was walking
as if he had sprained his ankle!

43
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:09,872
I saw no point in racing ahead
in the darkness.

44
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:12,407
She escaped an injury twice anyway.
- That's just what I say.

45
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:15,709
Rather than go out in the darkness,
isn't it better...

46
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,315
that you remain indoors and
play cards or just chat it up?

47
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:23,152
Now don't take me for an
old-fashioned man.

48
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:29,521
But this is a small town.
And tongues will wag.

49
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,996
Sorry, daddy. I will
remember that in future.

50
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,415
Haven't you gone to sleep?
- You've woken at the right time.

51
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,425
Uncle! Did the sunlight
start that fire?

52
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,396
Yes. It's the sun's rays.

53
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:16,371
Fantastic! How are you
going to put it out?

54
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,843
You can now imagine how powerful
the sunrays are.

55
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:31,489
If this is what happens in
one hundredth of a second...

56
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:34,793
a hundred times bigger fire
can be started in one second.

57
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,060
In one minute...
- 60 times more powerful!

58
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:45,727
You can charge a battery of this size
with so much power in just 8 hours...

59
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:49,101
that you can keep the lights
in this lab. Going for a year!

60
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,415
You're so close to Asha that it
makes me consider you like a son.

61
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,981
All my wealth will one day
go to my son-in-law.

62
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:05,548
And from the way Asha speaks,
I think it's you.

63
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,290
So why don't you get
a bit more serious?

64
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:13,764
Attend office with me.
Think of ways of promoting business.

65
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:16,230
May I say something if
it doesn't offend you?

66
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:18,025
Sure. Go ahead.

67
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:22,867
Your factory has no future anymore.
- Why not?

68
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,835
In fact, ever since you've arrived,
we've upped production by 20 per cent!

69
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:29,012
These batteries have no future, sir.

70
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:33,080
In this very city, there's a man doing
research for the last 10 years...

71
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:37,847
which will turn all these things
into relics of the 18th century.

72
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,556
When the batteries roll out
of his factory...

73
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:43,294
they aren't going to
be as heavy as this one.

74
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,955
They'll be 20 times lighter
and 10 times cheaper.

75
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:50,726
You won't have to recharge them
for 24 hours any longer...

76
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:53,905
2 minutes in the sun
will do.

77
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:57,006
They aren't going to run out of power
like these ones either.

78
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,473
They'll keep going for years.

79
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:00,975
Once they are out in the market...

80
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,817
your batteries are going to look
like bullock-carts, compared to cars.

81
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:11,555
And you will look like
a pauper before a king.

82
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:18,028
How do you know all this?
- Kailash is my friend.

83
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,009
Why the re-double?
- No trumps was yours, wasn't it?

84
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:45,382
That was a bid I made
on your move!

85
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,659
But why the 3 hearts?
- One heart was also yours, Jeevan.

86
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:52,058
One heart bid I made because
I have a 2 and a half bid!

87
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,062
And what do you have to show?
- But I was supporting you.

88
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,031
Supporting me with these
piddly little cards?!

89
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:59,465
I can't be your partner!
You're always fighting!

90
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,502
You've messed my game!
Won't I even fight with you?

91
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:04,540
He acts as if he's losing his life!
- Whatever it is! Why must I lose?

92
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,607
You're doing the shouting
and my throat's drying up.

93
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,745
Find another partner!

94
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:11,347
He makes me lose and asks me
to find another partner!

95
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,107
You guys play!

96
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:21,217
One cold beer.
- One for me. He picks up the bill.

97
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,621
Give the gentleman his own bill.
In fact, take it an advance.

98
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,959
Or he might ask what beer
he ever had!

99
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,293
I see!
- People come here to relax...

100
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:32,460
and this chap shows what an
expert he is at everything!

101
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:36,665
And you! Will you tell me who taught
you Bridge in the first place?

102
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:39,072
You did. Have you forgotten?

103
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,008
He makes me lose in there and
treats me like a beggar here.

104
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,642
Get me the beer. Quick.
- Here you are, sir.

105
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:48,910
Take a swig... cheers!

106
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:53,719
Whom are you looking at?
- Someone I was longing to see.

107
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,220
Is there someone like that?
- Don't look! She'll get suspicious.

108
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:58,757
I won't even let her know
I'm looking at her!

109
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:02,094
That ain't for your eyes.
She's exclusively for me.

110
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:08,533
I see her everywhere, when
I'm awake and even asleep.

111
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:11,468
I see! So that's how far
you've gone?

112
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,704
And her eyes... so blissfully
ignorant of my existence.

113
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:20,577
I've had it!
- What happened?

114
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:23,811
She's looking at me... don't move!
Sit still.

115
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,219
How are her eyes to look at?
- Lovely.

116
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:32,693
Her gaze pierces my heart.

117
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:36,661
And eyes so deep,
that I drown in them.

118
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:39,961
So let me take a look.
- You aren't supposed to!

119
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,332
Very well! Dammit!

120
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,130
You were to be married?

121
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:47,539
What a lucky man...
the one she's talking to.

122
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,074
And the idiot's grinning at her!
I'm feeling so very jealous!

123
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,150
She's looking at me!

124
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,655
Should I lose my senses...
steady me, my friend.

125
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:03,753
Give me a hand...
she's headed here!

126
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,964
What's going to happen
if she stands here before me?

127
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:09,759
You're a bloody coward!
- Yes. When she's around.

128
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:12,866
That's love, you know.

129
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:15,539
I find myself tongue-tied when
I come face to face with her.

130
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:18,676
And when she leaves, I fantasize
about talking to her for hours...

131
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:20,572
Hello!
- Hello!

132
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,440
Have you seen my daddy around?
- Your daddy? No.

133
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,849
Looks like you're busy right now.
I'll take a walk.

134
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:32,179
Hello, Asha!
- Jeevan!

135
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:35,756
Daddy was coming here to meet you.
- So sit down. Have a cold drink.

136
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:39,360
He must be arriving any minute.
- No thank you. When dad comes...

137
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:41,725
remind him "about the
appointment at 5 'o clock"

138
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,663
I won't forget!
I mean, I will tell him.

139
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:51,372
You know this girl, Jeevan!
- I even know her father.

140
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:55,603
So do I, since I was a kid.
But I never had the courage...

141
00:12:55,881 --> 00:13:00,375
to simply ask her to sit down.
"Have a cold drink".

142
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,677
You maybe good at running factories.

143
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:05,687
But you need expert opinion
in certain matters.

144
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:07,887
I mean, when she walked up here.

145
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,290
Show me how she arrived.
Go on.

146
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,296
Come on!

147
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:16,226
Asha! You will live long!
We were talking about you!

148
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:18,767
Please come and sit down.
I won't let you go away like this.

149
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:21,538
What will you have?
You must have something.

150
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,298
Orange juice? That's very
good for your complexion.

151
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:32,714
How do I tell you, Asha... I was
thinking of you all of last night.

152
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:36,449
Do you know what magic
your eyes work?

153
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:42,088
One look you cast at me...
and it pierces my heart.

154
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:54,263
"I seem to drown in them!"

155
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:03,938
"In the depths of
your clear eyes..."

156
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:10,346
"In the depths of your
clear eyes..."

157
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:16,590
"I seem to drown in them"

158
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:41,044
"To the flowers,
you have lent color"

159
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:45,019
"To the Sun, you have
given light"

160
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:47,887
"To the Sun
you have given light"

161
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,724
"You shook off the water
from your tresses..."

162
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,926
"and they formed a string of stars"

163
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:02,028
"Look; they've formed
a string of stars"

164
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:04,836
"Your lips..."

165
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,602
"are goblets of wine"

166
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:12,045
"Your lips are goblets of wine;
in them..."

167
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,381
"I seem to drown"

168
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:30,897
"In the depths of
your mesmerizing eyes..."

169
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:36,972
"I seem to drown"

170
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:04,764
"When you take a walk
in the gardens..."

171
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:11,806
"every leaf
begins to sway"

172
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:19,348
"Cast a glance anywhere,
with those sharp eyes..."

173
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,816
"and you set off raging fires"

174
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:25,945
"You set off raging fires"

175
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:28,651
"Your cheeks..."

176
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,919
"are sheer fire"

177
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:35,994
"Your cheeks are sheer fire;
in their heat..."

178
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:41,367
"I seem to drown"

179
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:47,612
"In the depths of
your bewitching eyes..."

180
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:54,945
"In the depths of
your bewitching eyes..."

181
00:16:55,253 --> 00:17:02,455
"I seem to drown..."

182
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,601
"in them"

183
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:36,193
Your time is here,
Professor Khurana.

184
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:41,794
Should you not find the formula
by daybreak...

185
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:45,767
this poison is going
to cause your death.

186
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:54,468
Don't think I'm kidding.

187
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,714
Get to work, if you
want to save your life.

188
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:32,550
Eureka!

189
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:41,391
I've found it!

190
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:43,925
I've found it!

191
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:46,323
I've found it!

192
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,832
Kailash! I've found it!

193
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:54,972
Who's dead?
- Not dead. I've found it!

194
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,801
What?
- Just come with me!

195
00:18:57,142 --> 00:18:59,201
Uncle! Your clothes!
- What about my clothes?

196
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:01,402
Where are your clothes?
- Where are they?

197
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:03,105
You haven't worn any!

198
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:08,117
To hell with clothes!
Just come with me!

199
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:10,253
My clothes, uncle!
- What clothes?

200
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:13,050
I haven't worn any!
- I haven't either! So why will you?

201
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:15,055
Come on!

202
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:54,929
Take a look, guys!
We've made it!

203
00:19:56,067 --> 00:20:00,504
Thank you... thank you.

204
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:06,740
"Another source of electricity"

205
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:10,778
"Thanks to Dr Khurana, India is on
the road to prosperity"

206
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:26,056
"Scientist's major discovery"

207
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:44,609
Uncle, you are the toast
of the whole world.

208
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:47,545
And here you are, still
immersed in those diagrams.

209
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:49,751
Old men can't be trusted, son.

210
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:52,446
I hope my discovery doesn't
die with me.

211
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,921
How can you say such things?
- I've written the formula down.

212
00:20:56,261 --> 00:21:00,288
So any scientist can read it
and generate solar power.

213
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,591
Take good care of this, son.

214
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:07,467
People are going to eye
this formula in the near future.

215
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,928
We've come from abroad.

216
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,771
Here's the letter you wrote.

217
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:50,275
You alone may come in.

218
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:58,311
We want the formula of the
solar power. At any cost.

219
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,520
You've brought so many men along.

220
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:06,287
For such things, you need
a lot of men sometimes.

221
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:09,024
What if someone suspects you?
- No one will suspect me.

222
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,294
Your country is presently hosting
an international tournament of golf.

223
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,999
We have come here under the
pretext of participating in it.

224
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:33,913
What's up?

225
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:38,146
Won't you reel off a couplet
in praise of my beauty today?

226
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:46,359
Hasn't my arrival brought Spring
into your life... as it usually does?

227
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:53,199
Looks like I'll have to
recite a poem today.

228
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:57,463
In praise of your good looks.
May I?

229
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:03,577
Something is surely wrong.
That far-away look...

230
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:08,480
and the stand-offishness.
What's up?

231
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:14,951
What if we happen to part in
this journey through life, Asha?

232
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:19,387
Is that what you've been
worrying about? Stop it.

233
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,624
Because we can never part.
- Suppose...

234
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:26,834
my feet take me to someone else,
whilst we walk on this path?

235
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:30,040
I'll break your legs then!
Do you understand?

236
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:33,709
You're still joking, Asha.
Forget it.

237
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:38,276
Jeevan, what's wrong?

238
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:42,010
It's something I can't bring
myself about to tell you, Asha.

239
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,380
And it'll be a betrayal,
if I don't.

240
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,390
Whatever else happens, Jeevan...
don't ever betray me.

241
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:56,190
That's exactly how I feel, too.
But I don't know how to tell you.

242
00:24:57,335 --> 00:25:01,704
I couldn't even imagine someone
else being my goal... and not you.

243
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:06,434
But I'm helpless, Asha.

244
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:08,806
I've been avoiding you
for the last few days.

245
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:11,338
Asha, I...

246
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,515
Fooled you, didn't I? Silly girl!
If this is what...

247
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:21,555
a joke does to you, what would
happen if I spoke the truth?

248
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,090
Is this your idea of a joke?
- Yes.

249
00:25:24,462 --> 00:25:25,861
Out of my way!

250
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,793
Wait a while, O angry one.

251
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:33,135
I lie in your path.

252
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:35,335
Keep lying there!

253
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:41,640
What're your plans for this evening?
- I have no plans with you!

254
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:46,179
But I do! I've heard of
a rose exhibition.

255
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:47,917
How about it?
- Go on your own.

256
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:49,685
I will. With you.

257
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,411
At 5. Will you meet me?
- No.

258
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:53,614
I'll still wait. Will you meet me?
- No.

259
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:55,257
I'll still wait. Will you meet me?
- No.

260
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:58,259
I'll still wait. Will you meet me?
- No!

261
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:04,094
Electricity is going to be
very cheap with this discovery.

262
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:08,033
It's also going to reach every
remote corner of the country.

263
00:26:09,073 --> 00:26:11,166
This is the biggest discovery
of the year.

264
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:14,004
This is the century's biggest
discovery in electricity.

265
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:17,113
This is going to be bring about
a revolution for India.

266
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,714
And it's all thanks to
your hardwork, Kailash.

267
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:22,852
Not mine, uncle's hardwork.
- Undoubtedly.

268
00:26:23,354 --> 00:26:27,256
Mr. Khurana, you're bound to bag
with the Nobel prize this year!

269
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,449
Congratulations, Kailash.

270
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:31,721
Congratulations from me, too.

271
00:26:31,896 --> 00:26:34,763
Say it with a hug!

272
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:39,460
May God give you success
in every field.

273
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:43,104
And when I say every field...
I mean "every field".

274
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:46,370
Maybe my friend's prayers
will help. Or else...

275
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:50,047
I stand no chance in the
field you're talking about.

276
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:52,406
With friends like me around?
Had you told me...

277
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:56,747
I'd have invited her over too.
- Go on! You're always fibbing!

278
00:26:57,154 --> 00:27:00,123
Fibbing? You're challenging
my pride?

279
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:05,224
What are you doing at 5 this evening?

280
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,054
I'm free. I've given them
a holiday at the factory.

281
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:11,065
Good! D'you know how many kinds of
roses have blossomed at the Park?

282
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:14,203
What have I to do with roses?
- Of course you do!

283
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:17,670
Be there at 5.
You will find a rose there...

284
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:21,504
that will make
your life blossom.

285
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,421
Have you come?
- Yes.

286
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:15,626
Looks like you've been
waiting for someone else.

287
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,996
Me? Whom could I wait for?

288
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:23,535
I just came over...

289
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:28,201
to take a look at the roses.

290
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:32,843
You're as scared as I normally am.

291
00:28:46,197 --> 00:28:49,530
Are you all alone?
- Who else would come with me?

292
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:52,031
You must certainly have
come to meet someone.

293
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:56,796
Wait for her; I'm leaving.

294
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,667
Excuse me...

295
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:03,478
If you don't like my company,
tell me in plain words.

296
00:29:03,748 --> 00:29:07,149
Please don't make excuses to leave.
- Really?

297
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:10,080
So here I am.

298
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:32,800
Wonderful sunshine, isn't it?
- Yes. Especially in winter.

299
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:37,347
What if the sunshine were captured...

300
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:41,140
you'd neither have darkness in nights
nor would there be a chill.

301
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:43,511
How's that possible?
- Why not?

302
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:45,619
That's just what we're doing
at our research center.

303
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:49,259
Come and take a look some day.
- I must. I've heard so much about it.

304
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:54,224
We have worshipped the Sun
for thousands of years...

305
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:57,731
but no one has ever utilized
the boon it has granted us.

306
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:02,933
In a few years, you will see in the
small villages of this poor country...

307
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:06,771
little, glittering images of
the Sun in the nights.

308
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:10,145
This country then won't be
called poor anymore.

309
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:14,615
It won't be poor at all.

310
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:28,922
Kailash babu...

311
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:32,763
Forgive me... I forgot
where I was.

312
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:39,509
May I leave now?
- When do I get to see you again?

313
00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:41,905
Come home someday.

314
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:51,822
Fantastic, my boy! I thought
you were dumb!

315
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:54,989
But in the very first meeting, you
have one foot in her house already!

316
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,925
It's all thanks to you, Jeevan.
- Oh, come off it!

317
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:01,495
I could lay down my life for you.
I'm a true friend.

318
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:05,459
You're a true friend.
- When are you going to her house?

319
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,434
"Dear Asha..."

320
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:19,805
"This word has become my life"

321
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:23,714
"I love anything that
includes this word"

322
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:29,355
"And I have no use for something
that does not have this word"

323
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:36,861
"Asha (hope)... is what my life
is tied with"

324
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,310
To Mr. Mehta's house.

325
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:56,981
The master is not in.

326
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:02,793
Is Asha there?
- Yes. Please come and sit down.

327
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:05,086
I'll send word to her.

328
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:14,766
Who is it?
- That gentleman from the power house.

329
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:18,040
Kailashbabu! It's you!
Please sit down.

330
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,570
You asked me to come over.
- Why not? Please sit down.

331
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:27,941
What will you have? Tea? Coffee?

332
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:31,986
I'll have a cup too,
if you have some.

333
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,657
As you wish.
- Hariram...

334
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:38,926
Get us two cups of tea. Quick.

335
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:44,597
Dad's away at a meeting.
He might be late in returning.

336
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:50,763
Is it okay for me to be here,
while he's away?

337
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:56,240
How can you say such things?
You're no outsider for daddy.

338
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:13,625
Say something.
- What?

339
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:16,425
Anything. Say something.

340
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:20,033
I'm not good at conversations.

341
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:23,536
Really? And you said so much
the other day!

342
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:28,143
I don't know why I find myself
tongue-tied in your presence, Asha.

343
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:32,109
Check out my heart; it's racing
at double its speed right now.

344
00:33:32,316 --> 00:33:35,581
Really? And why's that?

345
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:40,847
Know something, Asha?
I write so many letters to you.

346
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:44,056
Really? But I have never
received any.

347
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:49,392
Actually, that which I wish to
say to you and cannot...

348
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,866
I put on paper. But I never had the
courage to mail the letters to you.

349
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:56,039
Lest you are offended.

350
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,504
Look... there are so many letters.

351
00:33:59,877 --> 00:34:01,845
So many letters?

352
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:06,013
I was about to burn them today.
But then I thought...

353
00:34:08,986 --> 00:34:11,614
I must leave now.
- Have some tea before you leave!

354
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:16,782
You might break the cup on my face
once you've read the letters.

355
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:25,932
And listen; come and beat me up
if you wish to...

356
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:35,941
"Dear Miss Mehta..."

357
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,172
"Dear Asha..."

358
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:39,145
"Dear Asha..."

359
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,147
"Asha..."

360
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:22,187
"Every moment of my life...
you are close to my heart"

361
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:33,660
"Every moment I spend...
you are close to my heart"

362
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:44,711
"Life is a sweet yearning...
you tell me"

363
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:57,051
"Every moment of my life...
you are close to my heart"

364
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:29,053
"Every evening, my eyes
dream of your lovely tresses"

365
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:36,462
"Every night, I dream of
a bridal procession"

366
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:43,598
"I breathe... only to
inhale your scents"

367
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:51,471
"A fragrant understanding
it carries to me"

368
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:59,913
"Even my heart-beat
sings for you"

369
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:11,664
"Every moment I live...
you are close to my heart"

370
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:35,417
"I imagined seeing you in
my courtyard yesterday"

371
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:43,121
"And you seemed to say...
tie me in holy wedlock"

372
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,061
"What ties are these?"

373
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:50,829
"What dreams are these?"

374
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:58,547
"They seem to be so distant...
and yet, they seem to be my own"

375
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:02,650
"I keep thinking about it..."

376
00:38:02,853 --> 00:38:06,516
"and I'm so apprehensive
when I say..."

377
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:17,861
"every moment I live...
you are close to my heart"

378
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:49,290
"You must wonder why
I love you so much"

379
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:57,031
"You must think I'm crazy...
and I agree with you"

380
00:38:57,407 --> 00:39:02,572
"Only those crazy will understand
what craziness is all about"

381
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:12,445
"Only a moth would know the
pleasure there is in burning"

382
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:20,162
"But do keep tormenting me...
in my dreams"

383
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:31,964
"Every moment I live...
you are close to my heart"

384
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:43,110
"Life is all about yearning...
is what you tell me"

385
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:55,595
"Every moment I live...
you are close to my heart"

386
00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:14,347
Asha! This is wonderful!

387
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:19,920
What they say about telepathy is true!
I was missing you, and here you...

388
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:26,952
What's up, darling?
You don't seem to have slept all night.

389
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:32,997
I see! You must've been missing me
and spent the night in doing that.

390
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:36,297
Love had to happen, my love.
And it has!

391
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:39,442
So why think about it?
Sit down.

392
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:44,010
Jeevan, do you really love me?

393
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:47,145
What a childish question!

394
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:51,120
You ought to have put that
question to yourself.

395
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:55,448
I did. Many times.

396
00:40:56,259 --> 00:41:02,391
And each time my heart told me...
to ask you.

397
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,365
So listen! I love you so much...

398
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,007
that I could bring the stars from
the skies, right to your feet...

399
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:14,974
That's nonsense.
Give me a serious answer.

400
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:22,476
What do you think of love?
What does love mean to you?

401
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:27,489
Love? A thorn that
pierces the heart...

402
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:29,818
that's what love is all about.

403
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:34,725
That isn't your answer.
That's something a poet has said.

404
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:48,508
My beloved seems to have changed...
and I see destruction ahead.

405
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:56,947
I somehow feel that if poetry,
penned by others, that is...

406
00:41:57,287 --> 00:42:00,882
were taken away from you, you have
nothing to show for love.

407
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:02,558
Nothing? Really?

408
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:04,556
So let me show you!

409
00:42:06,663 --> 00:42:11,430
What impertinence is this?
- It's love without poetry, darling!

410
00:42:13,603 --> 00:42:16,401
What's gotten into you?
- Nothing absolutely...

411
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:20,907
This is what love does to a man.
- Stop it, Jeevan!

412
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:25,078
If you get any closer,
I won't come here ever again.

413
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:29,449
Sit down there... Go on.

414
00:42:29,653 --> 00:42:33,180
All right. But tell me why you're
asking me such questions today.

415
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:40,553
Someone in love has written
a book on the subject.

416
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,631
I'll give you that book some day.

417
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:49,605
Read it, and you'll know
what love really is.

418
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:56,412
What is it? Take it away.

419
00:43:00,116 --> 00:43:03,608
There's an enquiry from
the Czech republic, sir.

420
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:07,117
They want to know if we can set up
a solar power station there...

421
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,487
that can provide electricity
to the whole city.

422
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,398
In case we agree, they ask us
to send them an estimate.

423
00:43:15,866 --> 00:43:18,334
The rate at which the orders
are pouring in...

424
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:21,993
we'll soon have to train
a hundred top engineers.

425
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:27,535
Consult Mr. Khurana and issue
an ad. In the newspapers.

426
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:29,707
Ms. Mehta's here to see you, sir.

427
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:31,971
Who's that? Tell her that I'm busy.

428
00:43:32,582 --> 00:43:36,279
It's not Asha Mehta, is it?
- It is.

429
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:38,147
You? Welcome!

430
00:43:38,388 --> 00:43:41,323
You may go, Mr. Das...

431
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:49,427
Why are you standing there?
Please come in.

432
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:55,638
I can't believe it's Asha in person!
- I'm not. You're mistaken!

433
00:43:57,107 --> 00:44:00,668
My heart is hammering away, Asha.

434
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:03,942
Do come and sit down.
- On the table?

435
00:44:04,147 --> 00:44:06,342
No... here on the chair.

436
00:44:06,616 --> 00:44:11,019
Here... sit here
in the boss's chair.

437
00:44:12,122 --> 00:44:13,783
What are your orders?

438
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:18,621
I have a desire today.
- What is it?

439
00:44:18,995 --> 00:44:23,125
I want to see your new power-house.

440
00:44:23,466 --> 00:44:27,266
Certainly! You can see it.
But what will you have?

441
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,836
Tea? Coffee? A cold drink?
- Nothing...

442
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:34,410
Should you have some coffee,
I'll have some, too.

443
00:44:49,726 --> 00:44:53,184
I haven't looked up.
That doesn't mean I haven't seen you.

444
00:44:53,496 --> 00:44:57,956
I didn't want to disturb you, uncle.
- You didn't want to...

445
00:44:58,234 --> 00:45:00,896
that doesn't mean
you haven't.

446
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:05,633
Who's the girl?
- Mehta... Miss Asha Mehta.

447
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:09,537
Greetings.
- Bless you.

448
00:45:10,113 --> 00:45:13,048
Is she a scientist?
- No. She's no scientist.

449
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:19,518
So what's she doing here?
- She's here... to see your miracles.

450
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:23,418
Have you shown your own miracles?
- What miracles will I show?

451
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,455
That's his miracle;
the question itself!

452
00:45:27,964 --> 00:45:32,992
Naive boy! You've brought a girl here.
Won't you show the miracle now?

453
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:36,635
Teach him something, dear.
- I?

454
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:39,865
Don't you know anything either?
- No...

455
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:42,945
Great! You both know nothing.

456
00:45:43,913 --> 00:45:47,007
So teach each other.
You'll learn by and by!

457
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:53,214
There's nothing of the sort, uncle!

458
00:45:53,456 --> 00:45:55,617
Nothing of the sort?
- No.

459
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,959
That's very sad. A perfect couple.
And nothing of the sort?

460
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:05,629
So never mind! Go and work up
something together. Go on!

461
00:46:15,912 --> 00:46:22,943
"I imagined seeing you in
my courtyard yesterday"

462
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:30,721
"And you seemed to say...
tie me in holy wedlock"

463
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:34,522
"What ties are these?"

464
00:46:35,031 --> 00:46:38,262
"What dreams are these?"

465
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:42,499
"They seem to be so distant...
and yet, they seem to be my own"

466
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:46,539
"I keep thinking about it..."

467
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:54,149
"and I'm so apprehensive
when I say..."

468
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:58,880
Asha...

469
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:03,282
Can there be something between us?

470
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:13,463
No, Kailashbabu.

471
00:47:23,113 --> 00:47:27,846
You write beautiful letters.

472
00:47:29,185 --> 00:47:34,487
They tell me what a
wonderful man you are.

473
00:47:37,227 --> 00:47:40,492
But I'm unfortunate.

474
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,713
Our sales were 80,000 Rupees
last month.

475
00:48:05,922 --> 00:48:07,856
We have orders of not
even 10,000 this month.

476
00:48:08,057 --> 00:48:09,786
What's happening?

477
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:13,451
There's demand for only
one battery nowadays, sir.

478
00:48:13,696 --> 00:48:17,188
Kailash Gupta's solar-battery.

479
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:25,399
You were right, Jeevan.
My factory seems to be closing down.

480
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:31,308
There's only way for
you to survive, sir.

481
00:48:31,948 --> 00:48:34,246
Although it will spell my ruin.

482
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:38,219
Have Asha married to Kailash.
- What?

483
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:42,981
No. You are the one
Asha will marry.

484
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:45,693
That's my decision
and Asha's too.

485
00:48:45,895 --> 00:48:49,956
Think it over, sir.
If Kailash and Asha are married...

486
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:52,863
Kailash's victory will
be your victory.

487
00:48:53,036 --> 00:48:57,496
Kailash is all alone.
Everything will belong to Asha.

488
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,937
Or, in other words, everything
will belong to you.

489
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:07,106
But... how about you?
- I'm in a dilemma, too.

490
00:49:07,517 --> 00:49:12,147
Must I think of Asha and you?
Or must I think of my own happiness?

491
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:17,219
I'm a very selfish man, Mr. Mehta.
But not with you...

492
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:23,432
and not at all where Asha is concerned.
- What if Kailash does not agree?

493
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:26,099
Talk to Asha.

494
00:49:27,303 --> 00:49:31,672
I'll talk to Asha, if you wish.
- No, Jeevan.

495
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:34,671
Once a girl turns you down,
it's all over.

496
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:37,573
Very well then.
Go and turn into a hermit!

497
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:41,450
But if you want to win love...
take every wound that comes with it.

498
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:43,683
But never back down.

499
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,652
I can't do such a thing, Jeevan.

500
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,255
That I fell in love
was my mistake.

501
00:49:50,526 --> 00:49:53,518
And that she turned me down
was her prerogative.

502
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,758
And what is love that
is snatched anyway?

503
00:49:56,966 --> 00:49:59,025
Your brains have gone
to the dogs!

504
00:49:59,335 --> 00:50:02,736
But if you take my advice,
you can easily win over Asha.

505
00:50:03,206 --> 00:50:05,766
She has turned you down.
But that's not the last word, is it?

506
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:08,566
She can even acquiesce...
make a call to her. C'mon!

507
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:12,305
Call her? Have you gone mad?
- Yes! Just make that call!

508
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:15,542
I'm not going to call her.
- Don't. I'll make the call.

509
00:50:15,952 --> 00:50:18,477
Jeevan... what are you doing?
Don't make the call!

510
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:22,957
Lay off!

511
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:31,099
Talk to her!

512
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:41,808
Kailashbabu?
- Well...

513
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:46,841
Yes, it's Kailash here.
- You have a long life.

514
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,315
It's you I was thinking about.
- About me?

515
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:56,450
Why? Am I forbidden
from thinking about you?

516
00:50:57,026 --> 00:51:01,963
You are not forbidden, of course.
But I find it strange...

517
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:06,861
Looks like you've been hurt
by what I said.

518
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:09,298
No, that's not the matter.

519
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:13,168
But a lamp even a storms
could not put out...

520
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:17,244
was extinguished by
someone's simple blow.

521
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:24,181
The lamp you have lit
is sacred, Kailashbabu.

522
00:51:24,354 --> 00:51:27,221
So let it continue to glow.

523
00:51:27,423 --> 00:51:31,359
The fortunate girl who deserves it
must surely have it.

524
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:38,164
See? Your teachers
can never be wrong!

525
00:51:38,735 --> 00:51:42,865
But this is only the beginning.
Do not lose courage now.

526
00:51:43,473 --> 00:51:46,237
And should I go out for
a couple of days...

527
00:51:46,676 --> 00:51:50,373
don't turn into a hermit!
Keep calling her...

528
00:51:50,546 --> 00:51:52,639
Asha's going to belong to you.
Only you!

529
00:52:00,857 --> 00:52:03,826
Was it a call from Kailash?
- Yes.

530
00:52:03,993 --> 00:52:06,188
He came to meet you recently,
didn't he?

531
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,155
Yes.

532
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:10,456
Looks like he's taken a liking to you.

533
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:15,596
I don't know.

534
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:20,436
He's a nice boy. His father
was a great man, too.

535
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:23,509
From a reputed family.

536
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:27,046
Had he been alive today, I'd have
got you married into their family.

537
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:32,810
Jeevan's a nice boy, too.
But not when compared to Kailash.

538
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:37,652
He has no background, no wealth,
no standing.

539
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:42,488
Have you never thought about that?
- Daddy, Jeevan and I are...

540
00:52:42,698 --> 00:52:49,262
That's true. But if Kailash
were my son-in-law...

541
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,764
And what qualities does
Jeevan have anyway?

542
00:52:52,008 --> 00:52:56,274
He's, after all, my servant.
He can be made to see reason.

543
00:52:56,412 --> 00:52:58,039
What say?

544
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:02,040
No!

545
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:21,393
Jeevan...
- He has left.

546
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:24,332
Where to?
- It's explained in this letter.

547
00:53:31,347 --> 00:53:35,443
"My dearest Asha,
It breaks my heart to write this."

548
00:53:35,651 --> 00:53:37,710
"It's going to break
your heart, too"

549
00:53:37,987 --> 00:53:41,252
"But I'm helpless and
I must write to you"

550
00:53:41,557 --> 00:53:44,754
"There are only two things I have
loved in my life, Asha"

551
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:47,327
"You are the first and
my ambition is the other"

552
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:48,521
"My love for you asks me
to pursue my ambitions..."

553
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:50,495
"and my ambitions compel me
to forsake your love..."

554
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:52,760
"this small city, move to Europe
and achieve something"

555
00:53:53,002 --> 00:53:54,697
"I'm leaving"

556
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,506
"I'm going away, Asha.
But I'm leaving my love with you"

557
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:03,871
"I don't have the right to
ask you to wait for me..."

558
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,571
"because I might never return"

559
00:54:28,337 --> 00:54:30,805
"Asha (hope)..."

560
00:54:31,007 --> 00:54:32,531
"Asha (hope)..."

561
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:58,732
"Asha, O Asha..."

562
00:54:58,935 --> 00:55:06,740
"what has happened to you?"

563
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:11,903
"Do not call me Asha (hope)..."

564
00:55:12,148 --> 00:55:17,108
"I'm despair"

565
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:25,350
"Asha, O Asha..."

566
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:51,619
"What evening of sorrow is this?"

567
00:55:51,854 --> 00:55:56,484
"My feelings lie
suppressed in my heart"

568
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:03,625
"The joyous night will also come..."

569
00:56:03,866 --> 00:56:10,328
"bringing with it
happiness and joy"

570
00:56:11,607 --> 00:56:17,068
"Bringing with it
happiness and joy"

571
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:23,141
"I'm heartbroken..."

572
00:56:23,853 --> 00:56:30,019
"what good is Spring now?"

573
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:42,129
"Things around here are giving you
hints on how to be happy..."

574
00:56:42,438 --> 00:56:47,671
"On how to be happy"

575
00:56:50,646 --> 00:56:54,980
"No matter what anyone says..."

576
00:56:55,217 --> 00:57:00,086
"I have been reduced to a joke"

577
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:08,895
"Asha, O Asha..."

578
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:34,312
"My goal lay right ahead of me..."

579
00:57:34,557 --> 00:57:39,290
"why then, did it disappear?"

580
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:46,425
"Having seen your new goals..."

581
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:51,639
"it must've probably
gone away"

582
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:59,873
"It must've probably
gone away"

583
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:13,328
"How am I to even think
of new dreams anymore?"

584
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:25,272
"Just as the weather changes
when the time comes"

585
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:34,782
"That which I hadn't
even heard..."

586
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:39,819
"I've now begun to understand"

587
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:45,216
"Hope, I'm hope..."

588
00:58:45,361 --> 00:58:50,060
"what's gotten into me?"

589
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:09,616
"Hope, I'm hope..."

590
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:49,324
Congratulations.

591
00:59:49,525 --> 00:59:51,493
Please step out.

592
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:54,424
Please come.

593
00:59:55,965 --> 00:59:58,593
Congratulations!
- Lay off!

594
00:59:58,801 --> 01:00:03,033
Why weren't you around earlier?
- Forgive me. And congratulations!

595
01:00:11,046 --> 01:00:14,538
Let me drink so much tonight that
I don't remain in my senses anymore.

596
01:00:14,717 --> 01:00:18,744
I'm happy because my friend is happy.
- Who's finished my drink?

597
01:00:20,556 --> 01:00:22,490
May I pour some more?
- Who are you?

598
01:00:22,658 --> 01:00:24,956
Never mind me. Have a drink.
- No!

599
01:00:25,194 --> 01:00:26,718
I don't accept drinks from everyone!

600
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:30,421
I'll have it only if my boy
makes me a drink. Call him here!

601
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:33,090
He's already slipping away.
- Get him!

602
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:41,368
You're going to spend
your life with her...

603
01:00:41,544 --> 01:00:43,375
spend some time with us tonight.
- What are you saying?

604
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:47,013
Don't bother the poor chap.
Can't you see how much he's pining?

605
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:51,185
She must be pining even more!
- No, no!

606
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,847
No mercy on them tonight!
- Listen son...

607
01:00:54,456 --> 01:00:58,085
They're playing games with me!

608
01:00:58,327 --> 01:01:01,353
They make a drink for me,
and gulp it down on their own!

609
01:01:02,431 --> 01:01:05,457
Get a whole bottle for uncle!
- Yes, a whole bottle.

610
01:01:08,103 --> 01:01:10,628
Pour some more.

611
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:15,577
Some more.
- How much are you going to drink?

612
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:17,675
That's it...

613
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:21,007
You're my brave son, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

614
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:24,947
So shut your eyes and
swallow it all in one gulp!

615
01:01:25,387 --> 01:01:28,550
How can I drink so much?
- Look at him!

616
01:01:28,724 --> 01:01:31,056
What's he going to do in there?

617
01:01:32,461 --> 01:01:36,591
When you're a bit high,
you'll enjoy a greater high!

618
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,664
When I had my nuptials...

619
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:41,860
I drank so much, so much...

620
01:01:42,104 --> 01:01:47,167
that I collapsed the moment
I stepped in my room!

621
01:01:52,348 --> 01:01:55,442
Don't ever drink this stuff.
It's a bloody bitch!

622
01:02:03,892 --> 01:02:06,656
What will you tell her in there?
- Have I to tell her something?

623
01:02:06,895 --> 01:02:09,261
You have so much to tell...
and so much to hear.

624
01:02:09,365 --> 01:02:11,560
Let him go now.

625
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:29,308
Jeevan, if you want to meet,
this is not the way.

626
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:32,851
Come in from the front-door,
send word to me...

627
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:35,082
and I will meet you.

628
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:39,886
I assure you, Asha...
I'll never make this mistake again.

629
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:48,235
Tell me just this much; was it all
a drama you were playing on me?

630
01:02:48,704 --> 01:02:51,832
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
Must I remind you of the letter...

631
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:56,671
you wrote before you went away?
You rejected me for a better future.

632
01:02:56,912 --> 01:02:58,709
So why have you returned?

633
01:02:59,014 --> 01:03:04,281
It has had just the effect
I wanted. You hate me now.

634
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,080
I wrote that I was going away
for a better future...

635
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:11,656
and you believed that I loved
a better future, more than you?

636
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:15,862
What else should I have thought?
- Didn't your daddy tell you anything?

637
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:21,796
That's good too. Had your daddy
told you the truth...

638
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,700
you'd hold yourself unfaithful,
not me.

639
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:31,176
Your daddy was taken in by
the riches in Kailash's family.

640
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:34,812
The glitter was too much
for him to resist.

641
01:03:35,117 --> 01:03:38,018
The comforts you'd enjoy here...

642
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:41,586
you'd never find in Jeevan's house.

643
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:46,986
I was not selfish, because
I was truly in love with you.

644
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:49,664
To think of your welfare,
was my duty.

645
01:03:49,998 --> 01:03:52,296
I agreed with whatever
your dad wanted.

646
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:55,631
On one hand was your
happiness and you...

647
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:58,398
and on the other was
Kailash's friendship.

648
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,339
Kailash loved you very deeply.
I couldn't see him suffer.

649
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:06,809
Love and friendship are like
two parts of a grindstone.

650
01:04:07,116 --> 01:04:10,210
I was the one who had
to go through it.

651
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:15,281
Your tears make it clear that
you haven't gotten over me.

652
01:04:15,891 --> 01:04:20,590
Right, too. You have loved me so much.
How can you forget me so easily?

653
01:04:20,996 --> 01:04:25,330
But you must forget me...
you must forget me, Asha.

654
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:30,031
There's no point in discussing
all this anymore. Please go away!

655
01:04:30,205 --> 01:04:33,732
Very well, Asha.
I'm leaving.

656
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:38,136
But do not worry about
how I will lead my life.

657
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:43,511
I will live with your memories.
Only your memories.

658
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:55,813
Is this how a nuptial night is?

659
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:01,362
I had thought otherwise, too.

660
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,294
Have I made a mistake?

661
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:15,969
I'm the one who has made a mistake.

662
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:22,806
Are you regretting your
marriage with me?

663
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:27,419
Yes. You are regretting it too.

664
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:31,348
What things are you saying?
I swear it on my married life...

665
01:06:31,526 --> 01:06:35,758
Do not take such oaths, Asha.
It's a pack of lies.

666
01:06:36,465 --> 01:06:41,368
Lies?
- It's true, I was in love with you.

667
01:06:41,937 --> 01:06:45,998
But Jeevan was in love with you too.
What is the bigger truth is that...

668
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:48,938
you love Jeevan too!

669
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:52,913
Why did you break Jeevan's heart
and betray me thus?

670
01:06:55,717 --> 01:07:02,816
Why did you betray me, Asha?
Why?

671
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:11,331
In these circumstances, you will
treat everything I say as a lie.

672
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,327
But God is my witness.
I have not betrayed you.

673
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:19,104
It's true that I was once
in love with Jeevan.

674
01:07:19,308 --> 01:07:22,937
Which is why I had even
refused to marry you.

675
01:07:24,046 --> 01:07:28,881
Believe me or not, even
before we were married...

676
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:33,981
I had fallen in love with you.
Jeevan is just a memory for me.

677
01:07:34,189 --> 01:07:38,091
I give you word...
I'll even erase his memories.

678
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:45,123
I wish I knew Jeevan was sacrificing
his love for my friendship...

679
01:07:45,334 --> 01:07:50,795
I would have sacrificed my love
and got my friend married to you.

680
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,298
But he has beaten me to it.

681
01:07:57,746 --> 01:08:02,274
It's true that we are married, Asha.

682
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:07,680
But I won't be able to accept you,
no matter how hard I try.

683
01:08:17,065 --> 01:08:20,262
Do you want me to return
to my father's place?

684
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:28,535
No. This house now belongs as
much to you, as it does to me.

685
01:08:28,744 --> 01:08:31,770
Save for me, you own
everything here.

686
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:37,077
D'you want the servants to see their
master sleeping in the library...

687
01:08:37,352 --> 01:08:42,949
since the bride has arrived?

688
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:49,325
The servants won't get
to see all this.

689
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:56,893
The servants will get to see us
sharing the same room.

690
01:08:57,372 --> 01:09:00,364
But henceforth, this
will be your room...

691
01:09:00,575 --> 01:09:03,169
and my room...

692
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:23,356
Garland her, Ganga ma.

693
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:33,635
The staff in the household
welcome you, madam.

694
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:39,774
Here are the keys of the household.
Please keep them.

695
01:09:40,048 --> 01:09:42,949
Asha, Ganga ma.

696
01:09:43,118 --> 01:09:46,087
She has been with me
ever since I was a little boy.

697
01:09:56,965 --> 01:10:00,264
They slept in different rooms.

698
01:10:10,858 --> 01:10:13,156
My child!

699
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,760
Your first visit here
since your marriage!

700
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:20,863
You should've given me a call.
I'd have come to collect you.

701
01:10:23,604 --> 01:10:28,098
Hasn't Kailash come with you?

702
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:42,788
My dear child...

703
01:10:50,964 --> 01:10:54,695
Girls sometimes cry even out of joy.
But this...

704
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:58,794
She won't discuss it with you.
May I ask her?

705
01:11:08,215 --> 01:11:12,709
Your dad is worried because
you're crying, Asha.

706
01:11:12,886 --> 01:11:15,753
And you can't even imagine
what I'm going through.

707
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,626
Aren't you happy with the marriage?
Asha...

708
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:24,992
Jeevan! I don't need
your sympathies.

709
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:28,359
And don't you dare to
touch me ever again.

710
01:11:29,169 --> 01:11:31,967
I was only being...
- And whether I'm happy or not...

711
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:37,232
is none of your business.
The Asha you knew, is dead.

712
01:11:37,477 --> 01:11:40,378
This woman standing before you
is Mrs. Kailash Gupta...

713
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:43,744
who is happy in her home,
is happy with her marriage...

714
01:11:43,817 --> 01:11:46,217
and a woman who worships
her husband.

715
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:49,750
You misunderstand me, Asha.
Because you shed tears...

716
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:55,485
Tears, I shed. No outsider needs
to worry about why I shed them.

717
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:59,696
The next time you come into
my room, make sure you knock.

718
01:12:05,205 --> 01:12:10,108
Sir... Mr. Mehta.
- Mr. Mehta?

719
01:12:10,444 --> 01:12:12,969
We'll discuss this later.
- Very well, sir.

720
01:12:18,518 --> 01:12:20,816
Father...
- Bless you.

721
01:12:21,054 --> 01:12:24,285
What brings you here suddenly?
- Will I have to take an appointment?

722
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:28,584
That's not what I mean.
- Look, son...

723
01:12:28,896 --> 01:12:33,492
Asha is my only daughter. I've
brought her up with a lot of love.

724
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,930
I gave her hand in yours
because I thought...

725
01:12:37,204 --> 01:12:42,767
she'd be happier with you.
- Has Asha said she's not happy?

726
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:46,241
No, she has said nothing.
- And you've jumped to the conclusion...

727
01:12:46,413 --> 01:12:49,780
that I beat her up
and starve her?

728
01:12:49,983 --> 01:12:52,417
I didn't know you're such
an impertinent man!

729
01:12:52,653 --> 01:12:56,419
If you want me to continue
respecting you, Babuji...

730
01:12:56,623 --> 01:13:00,684
please do not interfere
in my family affairs.

731
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:04,795
It isn't just your family affair!
It's a question my daughter's life!

732
01:13:04,998 --> 01:13:08,900
If you ever feel that your daughter's
life is being ruined my house...

733
01:13:09,069 --> 01:13:15,633
you can take her away.
- Is that what you want?

734
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,333
But do not be under that impression!

735
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:19,911
Asha is now an equal partner
in everything you own!

736
01:13:20,113 --> 01:13:22,343
And there is a law in this country.

737
01:13:27,054 --> 01:13:30,455
Had I known that Kailash will
turn out to be such a scoundrel...

738
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:34,024
I'd have abducted Asha from
the wedding altar itself!

739
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:40,791
Asha's life is ruined. And what we
had planned isn't happening either.

740
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:43,333
You have accepted defeat
very soon, Babuji.

741
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:46,195
Your dream will certainly come true.

742
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,541
If Kailash is bent on
throwing Asha out...

743
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:53,108
why must Asha return empty-handed?

744
01:13:57,317 --> 01:13:59,615
You're early today.

745
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,152
Do you have any problems
in this house, Asha?

746
01:14:02,489 --> 01:14:06,823
Who said that to you?
- What've you gone and told your dad?

747
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:09,392
Who said that to you?

748
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:14,633
Now I know why your father chose me
as his son-in-law, and not Jeevan.

749
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:18,496
Only because he wants to be my
partner in my growing wealth!

750
01:14:19,606 --> 01:14:22,871
Are you telling me that I married
you because of my greed for money?

751
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:25,340
I'm talking about your father!

752
01:14:25,579 --> 01:14:27,740
My father didn't force me
into anything.

753
01:14:27,914 --> 01:14:29,711
I got married to you
of my own volition.

754
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:32,443
I don't believe that!
You wanted something else!

755
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:36,613
Kailashbabu! Throw me out
of the house, if you wish to!

756
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:39,759
But I'm not willing to
take such insults!

757
01:14:39,926 --> 01:14:42,554
So take a complaint against me
to your father right now...

758
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:46,096
and tell him not to
threaten me with the law!

759
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:52,299
Wonderful! You're making
great progress, young man!

760
01:14:52,506 --> 01:14:55,532
You're enjoying in
seven days of marriage...

761
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,869
what people experience
in 60 years!

762
01:14:58,045 --> 01:15:01,071
Keep him on a tight leash, my dear.

763
01:15:01,281 --> 01:15:04,307
Show any leniency and he'll start
throwing his weight around!

764
01:15:04,518 --> 01:15:06,611
You've been scolding
my girl, have you?

765
01:15:06,787 --> 01:15:09,881
Can I dare, uncle? She asks me
to shut up, immediately!

766
01:15:10,023 --> 01:15:13,652
And rightly, too.
Attagirl!

767
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:16,388
Don't take this chap seriously.
He's given to talking nonsense.

768
01:15:16,496 --> 01:15:17,986
He used to scream even when
his father was alive...

769
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:19,689
You're letting the cat
out of the bag, uncle!

770
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:22,461
Go on inside, Asha. Go on...
- Why must she go in?

771
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:25,996
It's for her benefit that
I'm squealing on you!

772
01:15:26,206 --> 01:15:28,231
Let her go, uncle.
She'll get you a cup of hot tea!

773
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:30,706
Tea? Is this any time for tea?

774
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:34,938
It's One. I'm going to
leave after lunch!

775
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:38,748
And the lunch my daughter
cooks for me!

776
01:15:38,985 --> 01:15:40,543
Aren't you going to give me lunch?
- Why not?

777
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,360
Cutting vegetables?
- Lunch is ready, ma'am.

778
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,195
That's okay. We can have it tonight.
I'm going to cook lunch.

779
01:15:57,604 --> 01:16:00,869
Gangama, knead some dough
for the puris.

780
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:04,973
Cut all the vegetables.

781
01:16:13,753 --> 01:16:16,688
Serve him first.
- Go ahead, uncle.

782
01:16:16,923 --> 01:16:21,417
Your husband first, dear. Here...
- Elders must eat first.

783
01:16:21,595 --> 01:16:23,927
Now feed him with
your own hands.

784
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:26,290
I'll eat on my own, uncle.
I'm not a kid anymore...

785
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,027
I know you're not a kid; you spoke
like an elderly man a while ago.

786
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:32,430
Take a puri, my dear,
and feed it to him.

787
01:16:32,973 --> 01:16:35,032
Go ahead... take a puri.

788
01:16:36,076 --> 01:16:40,479
Good girl... feed him.
Go on.

789
01:16:49,322 --> 01:16:51,256
That's great!

790
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:54,983
Now feed her with your hands.
- I'll eat later.

791
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:57,186
No way... sit down.

792
01:16:58,532 --> 01:17:01,296
Now feed her...
Go on!

793
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:20,720
Bravo!

794
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:25,480
It's like this, son.
Even animals have a life.

795
01:17:25,659 --> 01:17:29,618
But a human-being is one who
leads his life wisely.

796
01:17:29,829 --> 01:17:33,993
And you know of a man's wisdom
when you deal with him.

797
01:17:34,601 --> 01:17:39,163
In that respect, marriage is the
greatest test of man's wisdom.

798
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:42,736
Because it has to do with the way
you deal with each other.

799
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:45,400
The one who fails this test,
can never be called wise...

800
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:50,846
even if he builds an atom bomb.
Can he? Tell me.

801
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:57,353
You've got the message.
Now serve me some food.

802
01:17:57,624 --> 01:18:04,496
In a year's time, I want to
see a baby in this family.

803
01:18:04,831 --> 01:18:07,061
Or I'll unleash my
naughty kids on you.

804
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:09,664
Now share a plate,
the two of you...

805
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:11,097
I'll eat from this plate.

806
01:18:32,993 --> 01:18:35,553
The two of them have made up, sir.

807
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:39,229
Good bye.

808
01:18:42,002 --> 01:18:46,439
The workers have been given a raise
and a bonus of three months' salary.

809
01:18:46,773 --> 01:18:50,675
They are very happy and they're
praying for your well-being.

810
01:18:51,511 --> 01:18:54,275
What?

811
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:20,455
"I have begun to dream
colorful dreams..."

812
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,997
"Who knows..."

813
01:20:24,204 --> 01:20:30,541
"whether the flame of love
will ever be lit"

814
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:42,721
"I have begun to dream
colorful dreams..."

815
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,162
"He shall come..."

816
01:20:57,604 --> 01:21:02,405
"that makes me shy"

817
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:07,402
"What will happen?
And what will not?"

818
01:21:07,614 --> 01:21:12,881
"It makes me feel scared"

819
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:17,652
"Should we come together today..."

820
01:21:17,891 --> 01:21:24,228
"my days will have changed
for the better"

821
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:34,406
"I have begun to dream
colorful dreams..."

822
01:21:35,742 --> 01:21:38,472
"Who knows..."

823
01:21:38,878 --> 01:21:44,373
"whether the flame of love
will ever be lit"

824
01:22:05,738 --> 01:22:07,501
"I know not..."

825
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:14,876
"how I will bring around
my sulking husband"

826
01:22:15,648 --> 01:22:19,948
"O dot..."

827
01:22:20,086 --> 01:22:24,819
"help me know the ways
of love"

828
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:29,988
"I already belong
to my husband..."

829
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:35,099
"why doesn't he belong to me?"

830
01:22:37,971 --> 01:22:47,369
"I dream wonderful dreams..."

831
01:22:47,647 --> 01:22:51,981
"But I know not..."

832
01:22:52,085 --> 01:22:56,818
"whether the flame of love
will be lit at all"

833
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:37,154
"The kohl in my eyes..."

834
01:23:37,564 --> 01:23:43,764
"flows with my tears"

835
01:23:44,237 --> 01:23:49,334
"I am heartbroken..."

836
01:23:49,576 --> 01:23:55,913
"and no one knows
how I suffer"

837
01:23:56,616 --> 01:24:02,020
"My love is one-sided..."

838
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:11,186
"I get none of it"

839
01:24:53,106 --> 01:24:54,801
Yes, she's here.
Who's calling?

840
01:24:54,974 --> 01:24:56,874
I'm a friend of hers.

841
01:24:57,777 --> 01:24:59,176
It's your friend.

842
01:25:03,249 --> 01:25:07,310
Mrs. Gupta, forgive me,
I had to lie to your husband.

843
01:25:07,687 --> 01:25:10,986
I'm actually a doctor calling you
from Jeevan's residence.

844
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:15,021
Jeevan has swallowed poison.
- What?

845
01:25:15,762 --> 01:25:19,721
Don't worry... he's still alive,
but unconscious.

846
01:25:20,099 --> 01:25:23,830
I've found a letter addressed
to you, under his pillow.

847
01:25:25,772 --> 01:25:27,706
It would be better
if you came over...

848
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,603
or the letter could
go to the police.

849
01:25:29,809 --> 01:25:32,300
No! Please wait...
I'm coming over.

850
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:39,584
What happened?
- A friend of mine is seriously ill.

851
01:25:39,786 --> 01:25:43,017
The doctor says she might
not survive the night.

852
01:25:43,256 --> 01:25:45,747
You ought to go there then.
Let me take you there.

853
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:48,984
No. Why must you take the trouble?
I'll ask the driver to take me there.

854
01:25:50,596 --> 01:25:53,087
I'll get back as soon as possible.

855
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:06,469
Wait here. I'll be back.
- Very well.

856
01:26:22,595 --> 01:26:25,325
He wouldn't have made it,
had I not come in time.

857
01:26:25,498 --> 01:26:27,432
Who called you?

858
01:26:27,567 --> 01:26:30,661
You could say, it was destiny
that brought me here.

859
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:34,738
You mentioned a letter...
- Yes.

860
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:38,607
I'm a woman, too. I wouldn't like
to see your family ruined.

861
01:26:39,712 --> 01:26:41,976
Which is why I didn't
inform the police...

862
01:26:42,181 --> 01:26:45,150
despite dealing with a case
of attempted suicide.

863
01:26:48,254 --> 01:26:52,987
"Asha, for your welfare,
I have killed my love"

864
01:26:53,126 --> 01:26:56,118
"After how you repaid me for
my sacrifice yesterday..."

865
01:26:56,262 --> 01:26:59,857
"I don't want to live anymore.
I'm leaving the world"

866
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:03,694
"I'm returning your pictures
which could have helped me live"

867
01:27:06,038 --> 01:27:09,997
He says something about pictures.
- Yes. Here you are.

868
01:27:33,866 --> 01:27:37,324
I didn't have these pictures taken!
- Really?

869
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:40,097
Did it happen on its own?
- Believe me, please!

870
01:27:40,306 --> 01:27:42,001
I may believe you.

871
01:27:42,241 --> 01:27:46,541
But how about Kailash Gupta?
Will he believe you?

872
01:27:54,987 --> 01:27:57,353
I'm glad you've torn the pictures.

873
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:00,889
Make sure you burn the negatives,
when you get your hands on them.

874
01:28:01,594 --> 01:28:05,155
I'm sorry, but the negatives
have fallen in the wrong hands.

875
01:28:05,498 --> 01:28:08,331
They will demand a price for them.
- I'm willing to pay any price!

876
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:12,129
They won't part with the negatives
even for a million rupees.

877
01:28:12,471 --> 01:28:14,632
So what are they after?

878
01:28:14,874 --> 01:28:17,809
Has there been a new discovery
in your laboratory?

879
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:19,975
They want the formula.

880
01:28:21,113 --> 01:28:23,240
Take my advice. Give them
that piece of paper...

881
01:28:23,449 --> 01:28:25,713
and save your home from breaking.

882
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:29,385
This is my business card.
I will wait for you.

883
01:28:29,655 --> 01:28:32,419
Go away now... I hope nobody
sees you here at this hour.

884
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:34,286
Go on.

885
01:29:06,025 --> 01:29:07,754
How's your friend?

886
01:29:11,998 --> 01:29:13,989
What's up, Asha?

887
01:29:15,034 --> 01:29:17,662
Does he have no hopes
of living?

888
01:29:20,706 --> 01:29:26,167
Asha, get a hold on yourself.
What's the point in crying?

889
01:29:35,521 --> 01:29:39,184
You love your friend so much?

890
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:43,994
Come with me. A cup of coffee
will set everything right.

891
01:29:45,164 --> 01:29:49,624
I don't want any coffee.
Let's sit down and chat instead.

892
01:29:51,938 --> 01:29:54,406
Well?
- Say something?

893
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,905
What?
- About yourself, your business...

894
01:29:58,144 --> 01:30:01,807
your factory,
about the formula...

895
01:30:02,114 --> 01:30:04,207
What do you want to know?

896
01:30:04,717 --> 01:30:08,050
Where do you keep the formula?
At home? At the factory?

897
01:30:08,287 --> 01:30:12,986
That is uncle's look out, Asha.
I've never bothered about that.

898
01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:16,792
Is the formula worthless now that
you have discovered solar power?

899
01:30:16,963 --> 01:30:19,397
Not at all, Asha.

900
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:24,932
The whole world wants us to sell the
formula which helps us create power.

901
01:30:25,338 --> 01:30:29,069
If the formula falls in
someone else's hands...

902
01:30:29,408 --> 01:30:32,309
he can also generate power.
Why would anyone buy from us?

903
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:38,277
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing...

904
01:30:38,484 --> 01:30:42,079
You are thinking about something.
- When the formula is so precious...

905
01:30:42,321 --> 01:30:45,882
why don't you keep it with yourself?
- From tomorrow, I'll keep it.

906
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:49,253
I'll keep it with you.
- No! That's not what I meant.

907
01:30:51,297 --> 01:30:55,097
You look worried, Asha.
Take some rest.

908
01:30:55,568 --> 01:30:57,695
I'm going out for
some important work.

909
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:10,108
Senior Antonio, arrange
for the money.

910
01:31:10,616 --> 01:31:15,485
The formula's going to be in
your hands in a couple of days.

911
01:31:25,765 --> 01:31:30,862
You haven't even shaved!
- I haven't shaved...

912
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:36,073
because this is what will
bring the formula to us.

913
01:31:39,378 --> 01:31:41,869
I'm so happy to see you today.

914
01:31:42,214 --> 01:31:44,808
But why did you do
a thing like this?

915
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:48,814
Life is precious. Why did you
want to end it in this manner?

916
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:52,148
Life was precious when you
were with me, Asha.

917
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:58,556
You've always wanted my well-being,
Jeevan. So what's wrong now?

918
01:31:58,964 --> 01:32:01,592
Had something happened to you...

919
01:32:01,867 --> 01:32:04,427
and the letter fallen in
the hands of the police...

920
01:32:04,703 --> 01:32:09,140
what would happen to me?
- Yes, Asha. I'm very sorry.

921
01:32:10,209 --> 01:32:14,111
But I can't understand where
those pictures came from.

922
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:17,110
Why didn't you take
the pictures away?

923
01:32:20,252 --> 01:32:24,655
Not these! They were obscene pictures.
Of you and me in, posing dirtily...

924
01:32:24,857 --> 01:32:27,257
Obscene pictures of you and me?

925
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,758
Who showed them to you?
- The lady doctor did!

926
01:32:29,929 --> 01:32:32,022
Which lady doctor?
- The one who saved your life!

927
01:32:32,198 --> 01:32:34,029
But I don't know anyone!
- Ask your servant...

928
01:32:34,266 --> 01:32:37,565
he must've brought her here.
- I sacked the servant four days ago!

929
01:32:40,406 --> 01:32:44,433
So who was the lady-doctor who
called me, gave me the letter...

930
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:46,873
and showed me those pictures?

931
01:32:47,079 --> 01:32:49,843
This is her business card.

932
01:32:50,049 --> 01:32:53,416
Help me, Jeevan! Please!

933
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:56,746
She told me in no uncertain terms
that if they didn't get...

934
01:32:56,922 --> 01:32:58,890
the formula of Kailash's new
discovery...

935
01:32:59,058 --> 01:33:01,788
they would send the pictures
to Kailash!

936
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:07,555
You know how suspiciously I am
being watched all the time.

937
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:12,566
Those obscene pictures
can wreck my marriage.

938
01:33:12,738 --> 01:33:16,731
No, Asha! Your marriage will not
be wrecked, so long as I'm alive.

939
01:33:17,042 --> 01:33:21,240
They've hatched a plot against you.
But I won't let them succeed.

940
01:33:22,615 --> 01:33:25,448
Maybe that is why I have got
a new lease of life for.

941
01:33:25,651 --> 01:33:27,983
Have faith in me and go home.

942
01:33:28,154 --> 01:33:30,714
Go home, Asha.

943
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:37,858
Poor girl!

944
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:44,799
Here's your card. Now take your
place at the dispensary.

945
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:51,337
Have you already had breakfast?

946
01:33:51,577 --> 01:33:56,014
Had you gone to see your friend?
- Yes.

947
01:33:56,782 --> 01:34:00,809
The same friend you went
to see last night?

948
01:34:04,924 --> 01:34:07,893
Yes.

949
01:34:08,093 --> 01:34:10,994
Your friend's name...

950
01:34:13,999 --> 01:34:16,365
Jeevan, is it?

951
01:34:16,535 --> 01:34:19,561
Don't lie to me, Asha.

952
01:34:19,805 --> 01:34:22,740
You went to see Jeevan, didn't you?

953
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:29,840
You went to see him last
night too. Isn't you?

954
01:34:49,435 --> 01:34:51,699
Forgive me.

955
01:34:52,037 --> 01:34:55,006
It's okay if you don't care
for my feelings.

956
01:34:55,341 --> 01:34:57,832
It's okay if you don't care for me.

957
01:34:58,077 --> 01:35:02,104
But why are you ruining
my name and respect?

958
01:35:02,381 --> 01:35:07,478
I have done nothing that
will ruin your name and respect.

959
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:12,851
You have, Asha! You have!
- No! God is my witness!

960
01:35:26,205 --> 01:35:29,697
I have seen everything, dear.

961
01:35:29,942 --> 01:35:32,342
I'm not going to let you live here.
Let's go home.

962
01:35:32,578 --> 01:35:37,914
This is home for me, daddy.
I'll live here, die here.

963
01:35:38,484 --> 01:35:40,577
What beast have I married
my daughter to?

964
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:45,782
I'll go away, if you say anything
against my husband, daddy.

965
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:52,064
I appreciate your loyalty, dear.
But he does not deserve it.

966
01:35:52,398 --> 01:35:55,697
I'm going. The servants
will bring you some tea.

967
01:35:55,901 --> 01:35:59,234
Wait, Asha. I will say
nothing against Kailash.

968
01:35:59,471 --> 01:36:02,770
But why have you sent Jeevan
into the jaws of death?

969
01:36:03,409 --> 01:36:04,774
He has been kidnapped
by some thugs...

970
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:07,640
who demand that they get
something from you.

971
01:36:07,846 --> 01:36:11,805
Or else, not only will they send
some negatives to Kailash...

972
01:36:12,051 --> 01:36:16,283
but finish Jeevan, too.

973
01:36:17,289 --> 01:36:22,386
Jeevan has done many favors to us.
No price is too much to save him.

974
01:36:22,761 --> 01:36:26,424
What are they asking for?
Give it to me. I'll take it to them.

975
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:30,331
Who came to you?
- It was a telephone call.

976
01:36:30,536 --> 01:36:34,734
Don't worry. I'll do
something about this.

977
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,036
You've done the right thing, dear.

978
01:36:39,311 --> 01:36:43,805
But I think you have blown it
out of proportion.

979
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:47,052
They want the formula.
So let the swines have it.

980
01:36:47,319 --> 01:36:50,186
What?
- It's just a piece of paper.

981
01:36:50,422 --> 01:36:54,153
What you want to save in exchange
is Jeevan's life...

982
01:36:54,326 --> 01:36:58,922
and something more valuable.
Happiness for you and Kailash.

983
01:36:59,131 --> 01:37:01,565
But...
- No arguments.

984
01:37:01,734 --> 01:37:05,135
I'll dress up quickly. Let's go
to the doctor's dispensary.

985
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:08,299
May we come, Papa?
- Sure.

986
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:14,575
Talk to her. I'll be back soon.

987
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:23,547
Dr. Shetty... this is the one.

988
01:37:29,528 --> 01:37:33,225
Mr. Ramakant Khurana
in person!

989
01:37:33,532 --> 01:37:36,797
I'm glad to see
that you know me.

990
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:41,266
We had no idea that
such a great formula...

991
01:37:42,074 --> 01:37:44,338
would be personally handed over
to us by the man who discovered it!

992
01:37:44,643 --> 01:37:48,841
Won't I get a reward for it?
- Can I inspect the formula?

993
01:37:49,882 --> 01:37:52,214
I'd first like to inspect
those negatives.

994
01:37:53,952 --> 01:37:56,250
Of course.

995
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:02,725
Take a look, dear.

996
01:38:06,398 --> 01:38:08,195
Well?
- This is the one.

997
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:11,298
Let's burn it.
- One moment...

998
01:38:12,204 --> 01:38:14,172
let me satisfy myself.

999
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,608
I have yet to be satisfied.

1000
01:38:16,675 --> 01:38:18,404
What's the name, dear?
- Jeevan.

1001
01:38:18,677 --> 01:38:20,611
Right. Where's Jeevan?

1002
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:34,524
Now?
- Untie him first.

1003
01:38:35,327 --> 01:38:37,158
Untie him.

1004
01:38:53,979 --> 01:38:56,743
Ask me, if you can't figure it out.

1005
01:39:03,355 --> 01:39:06,347
What do you think?
- It looks okay.

1006
01:39:06,758 --> 01:39:10,785
I tried so much to make my life
of some use to you.

1007
01:39:10,996 --> 01:39:13,897
But you're the one doing
favors to me instead.

1008
01:39:14,099 --> 01:39:16,693
Go ahead with him, dear.

1009
01:39:16,935 --> 01:39:18,835
I'll come after I have
satisfied them.

1010
01:39:19,004 --> 01:39:23,065
No thank you. We are fully satisfied.
You may leave, too.

1011
01:39:23,308 --> 01:39:27,074
No. Show it some scientists,
so there is no doubt involved.

1012
01:39:27,446 --> 01:39:29,846
We have no doubts whatsoever.
- So give it to me.

1013
01:39:30,249 --> 01:39:32,945
What?
- Those negatives.

1014
01:39:40,459 --> 01:39:43,690
It's an amazing formula!
Where do you intend to sell it?

1015
01:39:43,962 --> 01:39:46,089
I've struck a deal with
20 countries already.

1016
01:39:46,265 --> 01:39:49,723
But we intend to deal with
every nation in the world.

1017
01:39:50,302 --> 01:39:54,363
How much money will you make?
- I haven't calculated yet.

1018
01:39:54,673 --> 01:39:58,040
But it's not going to be
anything less than 200 million.

1019
01:40:03,348 --> 01:40:06,044
This formula wouldn't sell
for a hundred cornflakes!

1020
01:40:06,218 --> 01:40:08,982
It's utter nonsense!
A bloody fake!

1021
01:40:09,254 --> 01:40:11,313
What nonsense are you talking?
- Nonsense?

1022
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:13,421
Give it away to a scrap dealer!

1023
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:17,118
They'll use it to make
small packets of peanuts!

1024
01:40:23,635 --> 01:40:26,798
Khurana has had it now.

1025
01:40:31,376 --> 01:40:34,777
Why's there darkness here? Why
haven't you switched on the lights?

1026
01:40:35,247 --> 01:40:39,183
Suraj... Kiran...

1027
01:40:39,384 --> 01:40:41,045
Where could they have gone?

1028
01:40:59,237 --> 01:41:03,071
What do you think, Khurana?

1029
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:07,711
How did you get here? I could
hand you over to the police.

1030
01:41:08,046 --> 01:41:11,072
Why not?

1031
01:41:16,688 --> 01:41:19,919
By dragging the police into this...

1032
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,217
you are unnecessarily endangering
the lives of your children.

1033
01:41:22,561 --> 01:41:26,588
This is between us.
Let's sort it out amicably.

1034
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:32,327
Where are my children?
- Where is the real formula?

1035
01:41:33,672 --> 01:41:36,368
It's not with me.
- But you can get hold of it.

1036
01:41:36,575 --> 01:41:38,543
We're in no hurry.

1037
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:42,177
I'll give you a call tomorrow morning.
Decide for yourself.

1038
01:41:42,481 --> 01:41:45,450
What do you love more?
The formula? Or your children?

1039
01:42:46,044 --> 01:42:48,604
Hello, uncle.
- Could you call Kailash, please?

1040
01:42:49,481 --> 01:42:53,542
Uncle... so early in the day?
- Yes, son.

1041
01:42:53,885 --> 01:42:59,221
I want you to keep what is yours.
- The formula?

1042
01:42:59,491 --> 01:43:04,087
What for, uncle? If it's safe
with me, it's safe with you.

1043
01:43:04,362 --> 01:43:10,062
No, son. The mightiest of men
will weaken at times.

1044
01:43:10,535 --> 01:43:14,631
I want to be worthy of the faith
you have always reposed in me.

1045
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,170
What things are you saying today?
- Go and keep it safely.

1046
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:20,867
All right. But please wait
till I return.

1047
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:30,111
It hardly takes time for man
to change his intentions.

1048
01:43:59,785 --> 01:44:02,379
Where has he gone?
- He has left.

1049
01:44:22,207 --> 01:44:24,767
You?

1050
01:44:26,945 --> 01:44:29,812
Where are the children?
- The children...

1051
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:36,749
they must be playing somewhere.

1052
01:44:39,658 --> 01:44:44,027
It's eight!
- Were you expecting a call at 8?

1053
01:44:48,867 --> 01:44:53,497
It's Eight already.
What have you decided?

1054
01:44:54,439 --> 01:44:57,875
This is an injustice.

1055
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:00,938
What you are looking for
is not in my possession.

1056
01:45:02,314 --> 01:45:05,943
Listen, old fossil!
Don't act smart with us!

1057
01:45:06,117 --> 01:45:09,109
Looks like you don't value
your children's lives.

1058
01:45:09,454 --> 01:45:12,184
I give you time till this evening.

1059
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:16,017
I ought to have the formula
by 5 p.m. Or else...

1060
01:45:17,596 --> 01:45:22,932
you will find the body of one of
your children at your doorstep.

1061
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:34,110
Your children will return, uncle.

1062
01:45:36,715 --> 01:45:41,550
It appears from this certificate
that he's an intelligent chap.

1063
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:44,689
Send him over tomorrow morning.
I'll employ him.

1064
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:50,592
Tomorrow's a Sunday, sir.

1065
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:53,925
So send him over on Monday.

1066
01:46:09,748 --> 01:46:14,344
Is everything okay?
What happened?

1067
01:46:16,354 --> 01:46:17,981
Stop crying and tell me
what happened!

1068
01:46:24,863 --> 01:46:28,321
I can't bear to see you crying.
Tell me what's wrong.

1069
01:46:31,036 --> 01:46:35,769
Ever since I've been married,
I've been weeping every day.

1070
01:46:36,007 --> 01:46:40,569
I am humiliated day in and day out;
I have borne it all.

1071
01:46:40,745 --> 01:46:43,646
It's beyond the limits
of my tolerance now.

1072
01:46:43,848 --> 01:46:45,748
How could Kailash dare?

1073
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:51,751
I have only given him love till now.

1074
01:46:51,957 --> 01:46:55,449
But now I will show him
what a woman's wrath is.

1075
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:58,390
He's so proud of the formula
of this new discovery!

1076
01:46:58,596 --> 01:47:00,894
I'll shatter his pride!

1077
01:47:02,033 --> 01:47:06,094
But that formula was already given
to those crooks to save me.

1078
01:47:06,271 --> 01:47:08,398
That wasn't the real one.
It was a fake!

1079
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:13,634
The real formula is lying
in Kailash's safe.

1080
01:47:13,979 --> 01:47:16,675
I have a key to the safe, too.

1081
01:47:18,016 --> 01:47:21,383
I'm going to steal that formula.

1082
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:31,054
I hesitate to say it, because I'm
afraid, you might misunderstand me.

1083
01:47:31,329 --> 01:47:36,232
Jeevan! Can we ever
misunderstand each other?

1084
01:47:36,968 --> 01:47:39,960
Tell me what you want to.
Go on.

1085
01:47:40,372 --> 01:47:44,775
I strongly feel that your marriage
was a mistake, Asha.

1086
01:47:44,909 --> 01:47:47,241
Something you and I are
both paying for.

1087
01:47:47,512 --> 01:47:50,413
But to go through this punishment
is a bigger mistake, Asha.

1088
01:47:50,582 --> 01:47:55,281
I want you to come back to me.
Forever.

1089
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:57,320
Yes, Asha. I'm not as
rich as Kailash is...

1090
01:47:57,822 --> 01:47:59,847
but I have so much of love
in my heart...

1091
01:48:00,025 --> 01:48:03,586
something Kailash can never have.

1092
01:48:03,762 --> 01:48:09,166
Jeevan! Do you really love me
as much as you used to?

1093
01:48:09,367 --> 01:48:12,700
I've proved my love by
swallowing the poison, Asha.

1094
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:18,137
Yes, I'm your Jeevan.
In this birth. And forever.

1095
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:27,885
What will you do once you've
stolen the formula?

1096
01:48:28,086 --> 01:48:31,112
There's that scientist
working with Kailash.

1097
01:48:31,389 --> 01:48:34,358
The same thugs have kidnapped
that old man's children.

1098
01:48:34,559 --> 01:48:37,790
I see. But what for?
- For the formula.

1099
01:48:38,063 --> 01:48:41,726
They threaten to kill the children
if they aren't given the formula.

1100
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,366
They dare to that?
I'll have their blood yet!

1101
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:47,298
No! I'm not going to
let you go there!

1102
01:48:47,539 --> 01:48:52,067
I've already risked your life once,
for my own sake.

1103
01:48:52,343 --> 01:48:56,803
But we must save those children, Asha!
- What do you think?

1104
01:48:57,115 --> 01:49:01,074
Could they have taken the children
to the same place where they held you?

1105
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:04,652
Undoubtedly! I have even seen
the route to the den.

1106
01:49:04,889 --> 01:49:07,983
Really? Can you send word to them,
in that case?

1107
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:10,525
Ask them to bring the children,
and I'll give them the formula.

1108
01:49:10,728 --> 01:49:13,595
Why not? But...
where will we call them?

1109
01:49:13,898 --> 01:49:18,028
In the forests behind Kailash's house.
At midnight.

1110
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:23,369
When Kailash is fast asleep.
- He'll be left asleep...

1111
01:49:23,575 --> 01:49:27,102
and Jeevan will go away
with his Asha. Forever.

1112
01:49:27,312 --> 01:49:31,749
Jeevan! When will night come?
When will it be midnight?

1113
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:34,885
I'm getting so impatient!
- Asha! My Asha!

1114
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:37,714
Not right now...
at midnight.

1115
01:49:58,176 --> 01:50:00,974
What are you looking at?
It's what you want.

1116
01:50:01,246 --> 01:50:04,044
That which you enacted
a farce for!

1117
01:50:04,282 --> 01:50:07,445
That which you played with
my love and my feelings for.

1118
01:50:07,652 --> 01:50:11,713
For which you might have
betrayed me so much again.

1119
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:17,689
You have never understood how
deeply I have loved you, Asha.

1120
01:50:18,062 --> 01:50:22,431
This formula is a heap of paper,
compared to my love!

1121
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:29,538
Had you as much as asked me for it,
I'd gladly have given it away to you.

1122
01:50:29,774 --> 01:50:34,074
I have worshipped you,
as people worship Goddesses.

1123
01:50:34,345 --> 01:50:38,509
And you have shattered
my faith today.

1124
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:43,278
I beg you, Asha. Do not give me
any false explanations...

1125
01:50:43,454 --> 01:50:46,719
and make me hate you even more.
Take it away.

1126
01:50:47,625 --> 01:50:50,150
Should there be anything else
you want, ask for it.

1127
01:50:50,695 --> 01:50:54,062
But henceforth, if you want
to live in this house...

1128
01:50:54,299 --> 01:50:56,961
I'll have to leave.

1129
01:50:57,969 --> 01:51:04,238
You do understand me, Kailashbabu.
And rightly, too.

1130
01:51:05,877 --> 01:51:14,182
That you are not kicking me out
proves you're just another man...

1131
01:51:14,652 --> 01:51:16,711
you're an angel.

1132
01:51:17,655 --> 01:51:20,886
With you in my heart,
I will go away.

1133
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:28,524
If you could give me some time
to pack my things...

1134
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:32,932
I'll be grateful to you.

1135
01:52:54,452 --> 01:52:56,682
Turn the car around.
- Very well.

1136
01:53:12,537 --> 01:53:16,473
I was wondering whether
you'd come.

1137
01:53:17,308 --> 01:53:19,242
Are the children here?
- Have you got the formula?

1138
01:53:19,577 --> 01:53:21,738
Yes. Where are the children?
- Over there.

1139
01:53:22,146 --> 01:53:24,080
We'll have to first
give them the formula.

1140
01:53:24,349 --> 01:53:26,874
Ask them to bring the kids here,
if they want the formula.

1141
01:53:27,919 --> 01:53:32,185
The formula is here in my bag.
- All right.

1142
01:53:36,361 --> 01:53:40,855
Bring the kids here
if you want the formula.

1143
01:53:42,266 --> 01:53:44,996
Sister!

1144
01:53:47,772 --> 01:53:50,332
Don't cry.

1145
01:53:54,645 --> 01:53:58,103
Where's daddy, sister?
- Come. Let's go to daddy.

1146
01:53:58,316 --> 01:54:00,409
Get in. Go on.

1147
01:54:06,924 --> 01:54:11,759
Give them the formula, Jeevan.
- Take it away!

1148
01:54:12,029 --> 01:54:15,294
Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1149
01:54:18,436 --> 01:54:23,135
As soon as I get down,
speed away with the car.

1150
01:54:23,341 --> 01:54:25,366
All right.

1151
01:54:31,015 --> 01:54:34,007
So where are we running
away to, Jeevan?

1152
01:54:34,519 --> 01:54:36,487
What are you talking about?
- Lay off!

1153
01:54:36,721 --> 01:54:39,986
Your game is up!
- What game? What are you saying?

1154
01:54:40,191 --> 01:54:44,423
Everything is a game for you.
Love and friendship, too!

1155
01:54:44,662 --> 01:54:48,098
You have treated me and
my father like toys.

1156
01:54:48,299 --> 01:54:50,893
You have treated my husband
like a toy! For your greed...

1157
01:54:51,202 --> 01:54:53,966
you have ruined our lives!

1158
01:54:54,439 --> 01:54:56,498
Sir, this empty!

1159
01:54:59,844 --> 01:55:05,009
Asha, where is the formula?
- You want the formula, do you?

1160
01:55:05,249 --> 01:55:06,614
Here you are!

1161
01:55:07,018 --> 01:55:09,509
No one fools me like this.

1162
01:55:18,696 --> 01:55:20,425
Kailash!

1163
01:55:20,565 --> 01:55:22,999
Let me go!

1164
01:55:45,223 --> 01:55:48,488
Get that, inspector?
Search the road to Coimbatore.

1165
01:55:48,659 --> 01:55:51,093
Go right up to Kunnoor. Search
every place and report to me.

1166
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:15,478
"What belongs to you,
is under the pillow"

1167
01:56:37,909 --> 01:56:40,434
That's him. Talk!

1168
01:56:41,145 --> 01:56:44,273
Kailashbabu, you haven't
done the right thing.

1169
01:56:44,682 --> 01:56:47,845
This was between you and us.
By bringing in the police...

1170
01:56:48,019 --> 01:56:52,547
you have put your wife at risk.
But nothing is out of control.

1171
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:56,121
Should you agree, we could
sort it out very lovingly.

1172
01:56:56,794 --> 01:57:02,460
You are very kind. But whom will
I have to be very loving with?

1173
01:57:04,569 --> 01:57:07,037
With me, of course.
- Now listen...

1174
01:57:07,238 --> 01:57:09,900
if you're going to answer every
question after asking Jeevan...

1175
01:57:10,141 --> 01:57:13,804
we're going to waste a lot of time.
Tell the bastard to talk to me...

1176
01:57:13,911 --> 01:57:16,880
if he's man enough!

1177
01:57:20,151 --> 01:57:23,086
I must compliment you for
your wisdom, Kailashbabu.

1178
01:57:23,287 --> 01:57:26,950
And I must compliment you
for being a good friend.

1179
01:57:27,358 --> 01:57:29,451
I will accept the compliments...

1180
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,627
when I have the formula of the
discovery in my hands.

1181
01:57:32,897 --> 01:57:35,832
Why? Haven't you received it yet?

1182
01:57:36,067 --> 01:57:40,231
Leave the dramatics to me, Kailash.

1183
01:57:40,504 --> 01:57:43,302
The formula is lying in your safe.

1184
01:57:43,474 --> 01:57:46,602
And you could say
that Asha is my safe.

1185
01:57:46,944 --> 01:57:51,244
So why don't we swap our safes
and strengthen our friendship?

1186
01:57:53,284 --> 01:57:55,752
I'm not going to kill her, Kailash.

1187
01:57:56,020 --> 01:58:02,016
But Asha is as beautiful as ever.
And I'm as passionate, too.

1188
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:08,128
I couldn't satisfy my desires earlier.
But if you compel me now...

1189
01:58:08,366 --> 01:58:13,599
Let alone touch her, if you even
cast a dirty glance at her...

1190
01:58:13,871 --> 01:58:17,807
I swear in the name of
my father and forefathers...

1191
01:58:18,075 --> 01:58:22,842
I will find you, even if I have
to look for you all my life.

1192
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:30,452
What state I bring you to then
will make even the angels shudder!

1193
01:58:32,189 --> 01:58:35,681
You still love her,
don't you?

1194
01:58:35,893 --> 01:58:38,259
So I'm going to get the formula.

1195
01:58:38,462 --> 01:58:39,952
Tell me. When have I to send my men?

1196
01:58:40,197 --> 01:58:44,463
You must come in person.
And Asha must accompany you.

1197
01:58:44,735 --> 01:58:49,195
My men will come to you.
And you will give them the formula.

1198
01:58:49,507 --> 01:58:52,203
Only after we have ascertained
the genuineness of the formula...

1199
01:58:52,376 --> 01:58:55,277
will we return Asha to you.

1200
01:58:56,047 --> 01:59:00,381
Remember; Do nothing too smart.

1201
01:59:00,785 --> 01:59:05,984
Be at the doorstep with the
formula at midnight. Okay?

1202
01:59:20,738 --> 01:59:22,535
Run! There's a fire!

1203
01:59:22,773 --> 01:59:24,297
Help!

1204
01:59:24,608 --> 01:59:26,599
Help!

1205
01:59:27,344 --> 01:59:29,039
Help!

1206
02:00:08,252 --> 02:00:11,744
They've fled.
- Your scheme has worked.

1207
02:00:20,131 --> 02:00:23,100
The cause of the fire is not known...

1208
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:27,734
but Kailash Gupta and three of
his servants were charred to death.

1209
02:00:28,139 --> 02:00:32,166
Mrs. Kailash Gupta was not at the
residence when the incident occurred.

1210
02:00:32,443 --> 02:00:36,846
The Government has sent three officers
from Delhi to investigate the matter.

1211
02:00:36,981 --> 02:00:39,916
Till such time as they
unravel the mystery...

1212
02:00:40,117 --> 02:00:43,575
no citizen will be allowed anywhere
near the scene of the fire.

1213
02:00:43,854 --> 02:00:46,345
There is tight police security
all around.

1214
02:00:48,359 --> 02:00:54,195
It is rumored that the Government is
looking for some important documents.

1215
02:00:55,866 --> 02:00:58,357
You should know what the
important documents are!

1216
02:00:59,603 --> 02:01:02,401
Before the officers from Delhi
arrive here...

1217
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:07,407
we must get hold of the formula,
at any cost. Tonight.

1218
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:25,290
They're here! Get to work!

1219
02:01:26,697 --> 02:01:29,393
I'll go and hide in the
boot of their car.

1220
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,064
You guys will spare a guy or two
and fix the others.

1221
02:01:32,269 --> 02:01:33,634
Don't worry. We'll handle it.

1222
02:01:33,838 --> 02:01:36,398
Is it okay for you to take
such a risk, son?

1223
02:01:36,607 --> 02:01:38,802
It's a question of Asha's life.
I must go!

1224
02:01:39,076 --> 02:01:40,737
If there's no word from you...

1225
02:01:40,978 --> 02:01:43,310
I'll take the police and
set out to look for you.

1226
02:01:43,514 --> 02:01:45,243
All right. Do as you deem fit.

1227
02:01:51,255 --> 02:01:52,779
Give me that stick.

1228
02:01:53,057 --> 02:01:55,491
You guys disperse...
Go on.

1229
02:02:29,226 --> 02:02:31,126
You want the formula, eh?

1230
02:03:42,666 --> 02:03:44,634
Let me go! Leave me alone!

1231
02:03:44,835 --> 02:03:46,302
For God's sake...
let me go!

1232
02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:49,303
I beg of you...
have mercy on me!

1233
02:03:49,506 --> 02:03:53,135
Are you going to hell to meet your
husband, even if we let you go?

1234
02:03:53,277 --> 02:03:54,972
You are lying!

1235
02:03:55,179 --> 02:04:00,412
Nothing can happen to Kailash!
You are lying!

1236
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:03,745
This is surely a ploy!
- All right. So it is a ploy!

1237
02:04:07,891 --> 02:04:14,660
Why have you left me?
I can't live without you!

1238
02:04:14,865 --> 02:04:19,529
I'm ruined! What am I
going to do?

1239
02:05:39,817 --> 02:05:42,081
Leave me alone!

1240
02:07:07,437 --> 02:07:09,029
We've run out of gas!

1241
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:11,969
C'mon!

1242
02:09:03,954 --> 02:09:06,548
"They meet..."

1243
02:09:06,690 --> 02:09:09,853
"two bodies meet"

1244
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,559
"They blossom"

1245
02:09:14,798 --> 02:09:23,206
"Even if life is short..."

1246
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:29,711
"we don't regret it"

1247
02:09:32,816 --> 02:09:35,216
"They meet..."

1248
02:09:35,385 --> 02:09:39,048
"two bodies meet"

1249
02:09:41,291 --> 02:09:46,820
"and they blossom"

1250
02:09:48,065 --> 02:09:59,602
"Even if life is short...
we have no regrets"

1251
02:10:00,510 --> 02:10:04,378
"We have no regrets"

1252
02:10:32,909 --> 02:10:38,848
"Even if it's late in arriving..."

1253
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:42,780
"Spring is here at last"

1254
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:51,952
"In fires it lay,
before love awakened"

1255
02:10:52,896 --> 02:11:00,826
"In a storm have
these flowers blossomed"

1256
02:11:01,605 --> 02:11:05,336
"In a storm have
these flowers blossomed"

1257
02:11:05,609 --> 02:11:08,601
"So unique is our union"

1258
02:11:09,813 --> 02:11:12,179
"We meet..."

1259
02:11:12,482 --> 02:11:16,145
"Our bodies meet"

1260
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:24,259
"We blossom"

1261
02:11:24,995 --> 02:11:32,834
"Even if life is short now...
we have no regrets"

1262
02:11:33,170 --> 02:11:39,370
"We have no regrets"

1263
02:12:13,543 --> 02:12:23,578
"It's the same smile...
on the lips I have adored"

1264
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:32,856
"Our desires we suppressed
so far"

1265
02:12:33,296 --> 02:12:41,260
"Past days,
let us forget"

1266
02:12:41,505 --> 02:12:48,411
"The days gone by,
let us forget, my love"

1267
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:52,405
"We meet..."

1268
02:12:52,616 --> 02:12:55,744
"Our bodies meet..."

1269
02:12:57,954 --> 02:13:04,086
"and love blossoms"

1270
02:13:05,028 --> 02:13:12,958
"Even if we have a
short time to live..."

1271
02:13:13,236 --> 02:13:16,933
"we have no regrets"

1272
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:20,801
"We have no regrets"

1273
02:13:27,083 --> 02:13:30,917
Set the forests on fire,
if that is where they're holed up!

1274
02:13:31,087 --> 02:13:35,114
But if they manage to escape,
I'll make your lives miserable!

1275
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:08,523
This is taking too long, Deendayal.

1276
02:14:08,725 --> 02:14:10,386
I must take the police
and go in search of them.

1277
02:14:29,112 --> 02:14:30,306
Let's go.

1278
02:16:53,189 --> 02:16:58,183
Stay here, Asha...
- Forget it now. We had better escape.

1279
02:16:58,428 --> 02:17:01,886
No, Asha. I'll regret
this all my life...

1280
02:17:02,165 --> 02:17:05,760
that I have taught his
son-of-a-bitch a lesson!

1281
02:17:07,437 --> 02:17:11,771
They are not here, Jeevan saheb!
- So look there!

1282
02:17:12,308 --> 02:17:16,210
Look nowhere, Jeevan.
I'm right here.

1283
02:17:22,285 --> 02:17:26,619
I didn't want us to have a
confrontation like this, Kailash.

1284
02:17:26,823 --> 02:17:29,883
What you want makes
no difference anymore.

1285
02:17:30,193 --> 02:17:32,923
Only what I want is
about to happen!

1286
02:17:33,129 --> 02:17:35,427
It isn't a fight between equals.

1287
02:17:35,665 --> 02:17:40,898
I have 20 men on my side
and a pistol, too.

1288
02:17:41,037 --> 02:17:44,200
It isn't a fight between
one man against 20...

1289
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:48,035
it's a battle between friendship
and evil.

1290
02:17:52,882 --> 02:17:57,444
The lead in my pistol knows
nothing about friendship and evil.

1291
02:17:57,687 --> 02:18:00,554
It simply kills.

1292
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:05,193
Had the gun to go off,
it would by now.

1293
02:18:05,728 --> 02:18:09,596
But it seems to have more
consideration than you.

1294
02:18:33,590 --> 02:18:38,118
Now look, Kailash.
Bloodshed isn't a nice thing.

1295
02:18:38,361 --> 02:18:41,194
You know what I'm after.
The formula.

1296
02:18:41,397 --> 02:18:43,797
Don't you know what I'm looking for?

1297
02:18:44,834 --> 02:18:46,699
What?

1298
02:20:14,724 --> 02:20:18,785
Ask your dogs for help!
I'm fix them too!

1299
02:20:26,135 --> 02:20:28,160
Lay off!

1300
02:20:43,219 --> 02:20:45,813
I want those criminals alive.
Surround the place!

1301
02:22:06,903 --> 02:22:09,804
Freeze! Don't anybody move!

1302
02:22:10,006 --> 02:22:11,837
Look, Jeevan.

1303
02:22:12,041 --> 02:22:18,071
There's a huge reception party
to welcome you and your buddies.

1304
02:22:23,319 --> 02:22:28,188
I will regret it that although
the police will have you punished...

1305
02:22:28,324 --> 02:22:31,953
for betraying the nation...

1306
02:22:32,095 --> 02:22:35,758
I have not punished you enough...

1307
02:22:35,932 --> 02:22:40,096
for betraying a friend like me
and an angel like Asha.

1308
02:22:48,444 --> 02:22:51,675
What have you done?

1309
02:22:51,848 --> 02:22:56,876
I'm a greedy man. I'm not worthy
of your friendship, Kailash.

1310
02:23:37,059 --> 02:23:39,152
Let's go, son.

1311
02:24:01,817 --> 02:24:09,417
"You must wonder why
I love you so much"

1312
02:24:09,592 --> 02:24:16,896
"You must think I'm crazy...
and I agree with you"

1313
02:24:17,166 --> 02:24:24,663
"Only those crazy will understand
what craziness is all about"

1314
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:32,246
"Only a moth would know the
