1
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,488
Sir, we profited 75 crores...

2
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,455
...from our Xantray fight club.

3
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,492
5O crores from Hong Kong fight club.

4
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,492
4O crores from Korean fight club.

5
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,065
Raghav. . .vve found her!

6
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,291
Where?

7
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,597
Hyderabad.

8
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,456
Cut! Cut! Cut!

9
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,690
Move!

10
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,164
Pack up!

11
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,098
Baby injured...
 am ruined!

12
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,758
My daughter's worth 100 crores.

13
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,300
Call the ambulance. Call a doctor!

14
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,642
Sir...vvhere are you going?

15
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,709
Wait sonny boy!

16
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,150
Didn't you hear?

17
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,988
I said it loud and clear... Pack up!

18
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,456
What are all of you doing here?

19
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,515
Pack up means pack up!

20
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,061
Shooting resumes tomorrow.

21
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,554
And this fake gun that you're holding.

22
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,293
I must admit that
action isn't my forte...

23
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:29,202
...but back home people use real guns
with real bullets to unbuckle their belt.

24
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,167
Like this...

25
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,469
They shoot...
ike this...

26
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,476
Take a look...

27
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,443
Like this...

28
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,242
Then fire...

29
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,416

...

30
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,221
I was going to return your money!

31
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,613
I mean...

32
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,714
Dad what...

33
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,334
What? Raghav!

34
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,041
No, no, no!
The local police can't help you.

35
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,642
Sir...
- Go talk to some Minister or someone.

36
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,677
Now go!

37
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,717
We can't take any
action against Raghav.

38
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,315
He's the reason we get votes.

39
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,518
But...
- Sorry!

40
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,589
I am sorry for whatever
happened with your daughter.

41
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,361
But the problem is...

42
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,428
...we don't have any extradition
treaty with Thailand.

43
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,497
I mean I can notify the officials.

44
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,010
But it's going to take a lot of time.

45
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,080
Rama! Rama!

46
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,715
The film was already shelved 3 times.

47
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,380
Impossible.

48
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,984
Not even God can save my heroine,
your daughter.

49
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,120
There is someone.

50
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,301
Yes.

51
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,273
Look, Ronny.

52
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,298
Subbu's test reports have arrived.

53
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,308
And he can definitely speak again.

54
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,143
All you need to do is arrange
for the money as soon as possible.

55
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,113
Because Dr. Robert will be
in India only for few more days.

56
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,310
9K8)’-

57
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,650
You Ronny?

58
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,227
Myself Guddu Sohan.

59
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,155
Film Producer.

60
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,500
I started making
a film 2 years ago.

61
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,666
And reshot it three times.

62
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:28,236
My first heroine...
eloped with her lover.

63
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:33,107
The second one...
got pregnant...and ran away.

64
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,118
And the third one...

65
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,180
Well, she didn't run away.

66
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,622
She was abducted...
and took her to Bangkok.

67
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,727
Bloody...

68
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,359
You've to bring her back.

69
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,665
You..

70
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,465
I'm ready to pay any price. .

71
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,667
This is her photo.

72
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,199
Siya!

73
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,009
You need to bring her back...

74
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,243
...and complete my shooting.

75
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,281
Never!

76
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,128
Save her.

77
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,728
You love her.

78
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,297
Please. . . listen to me.

79
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,603
Rama! Rama! Rama! Rama!

80
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,504
He won't do it.

81
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,337
He hates her.

82
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,272
I was afraid that he
might have stopped hating her.

83
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,051
But there's something still left.

84
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,584
Otherwise he wouldn't be so worried.

85
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,105
What happened?

86
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,370
Changed your mind?

87
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,640
I'll do it...

88
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,475
But only for money.

89
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,649
Money?

90
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,713
Sir, can you switch off your laptop?

91
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,486
We're ready to take off.

92
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,052
Thank you!

93
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,517
Hey...!

94
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,390
Why did you stop?

95
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,767
Feeling shy’?

96
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,132
Enough with your attitude.

97
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,539
You know I love you.

98
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,309
Please rain...please rain.

99
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,574
Rain so hard...and don't stop.

100
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,641
You won't?

101
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,313
You won't?

102
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,782
Fine! I am not talking to you!

103
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,054
Bye.

104
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,423
Are you done?
- What?

105
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,732
Checking me out.

106
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,102
Do I look fine...

107
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,728
...or should I lose some more weight?

108
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,573
You must have read behind trucks!

109
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,131
"Horn OK Please!"

110
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,736
"Keep Distance!"

111
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,514
Well, I was just waiting.
- For whom?

112
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,072
You, of course.

113
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,377
I mean...if you're done, then...

114
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,454
...can I talk to the clouds as well?

115
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,117
You're crazy.

116
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,322
Nice?
- Who? Me?

117
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,625
Your sense of humor.

118
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,394
You'll really make
it big someday.

119
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,795
Really?
- Yes.

120
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,368
Everywhere you go,
people will say...

121
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,407
"Get lost."

122
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,432
Where were you?

123
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,698
Where's Daddy?

124
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:30,339
PP Khurana, pride of Ludhiana...
has entered South.

125
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,610
Make arrangements for the shooting...

126
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,085
Naidu sir...the heroine's
simply the best.

127
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,180
I've trained her in dance,
drama and self-defense.

128
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,654
She'll set the screen on fire.

129
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,490
People will start a riot.
They'll go crazy.

130
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,086
Commit suicides.

131
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,495
Burn down the cinema house.

132
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,760
I mean...cinema will be revived.

133
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,500
People will make temples in her honor.

134
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,271
VVe

...the train's 15 minutes...

135
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,138
You're too much.

136
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,634
Call me back.

137
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,111
Change it!

138
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,346
I'll go change it right away.

139
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,645
Oh God!

140
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:45,580
"Lungi Dance. Lungi Dance.
Lungi Dance. Lungi Dance."

141
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,457
I'll go check why the train's stopped.

142
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,138
Hello, sir.

143
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,697
Sir, water problem on the track, sir.

144
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,609
Sir, please sit in the cabin,
sir. Please.

145
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,080
Sir, please.

146
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,252
Anything sir? Tea or coffee?

147
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,520
Where are you going?

148
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,024
Outside.

149
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,020
Your father will get angry.

150
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:00,962
Keep seated.

151
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,591
But daddy's out there.

152
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,442
Listen.

153
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,719
Hi.

154
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,314
Stop trying
to work your charms on me.

155
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,081
It's not going to work.

156
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,519
Stay in your limits.

157
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,687
And please abandon any wrong
ideas you have on your mind?

158
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,690
Why do you think I'll only
have wrong ideas about you?

159
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,667
I can get right ideas too.

160
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,767
You'll make it really big someday.

161
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,670
But this is it...okay.

162
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,734
Over.

163
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,307
So soon?

164
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,278

Hey...what's wrong?

197
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,269
Dad's not on the train.
- You sure?

198
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,571
Okay, re
a><. I'll check.
- Okay.

199
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,017
You're here?

200
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,186
No, I am under the train.

201
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,552
Come on.

202
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,731
Found him!

203
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,427
Not yet.

204
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,224
Found dad!

205
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,769
Not yet!

206
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,268
He's on the train.

207
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,678
Come on!

208
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,744
Hey!

209
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,501
Welcome.

210
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,567
All Well’?
- Very well.

211
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,282
Father.
- Hmmmm.

212
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,155
I thought this time...

213
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,558
...you'

 choose someone else
as captain for the boat race.

214
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,721
I've been doing it
for seven years in a rovv.

215
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,359
Its tradition, son.

216
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,396
Only the best student of
this academy can become the captain.

217
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,371
You're not a kid anymore.

218
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,708
Always feeding me the first morsel.
- l'll always be a kid for you.

219
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,310
This time you'll have
to stay back longer.

220
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,744
I'm not sending you back
until I don't get you married.

221
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,135
Teacher?

222
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,275
OKay...

223
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,313
Well, dad sent a letter for you.

224
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,553
Just a minute.

225
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,019
So sorry...

226
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,284
Just a minute.

227
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,316
Yeah.

228
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,195
Yes.

229
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,369
"Dear Kailash, my friend."

230
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,240
"By the time you receive this letter,
I'd already be dead."

231
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,511
"My illness is beyond any cure."

232
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,440
"While fighting for
our country in the army..."

233
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:16,179
"...we completely forgot that we need to
protect our family and children too."

234
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,181
"My son turned out to be a rebel."

235
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,684
"He never follows any rules."

236
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,457
"He likes picking a
fight without a reason."

237
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,490
"Earlier his actions would amuse me."

238
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,157
"But now... one thing always scares me."

239
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,561
"What will happen to him after me?"

240
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,097
"This concern won't
let me die peacefully."

241
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,468
"Save my son."

242
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,678
"Turn him into a human being.
I request you."

243
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,308
"Your friend, Col. Samarjeet Singh."

244
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,446
Hovv old are you?
- I am 23.

245
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,447
I am sixty-eight.

246
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,522
Hovv old is that in English?

247
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,025
68.

248
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,290
Don't lie.

249
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,058
ls it true?

250
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,563
That's. . . pretty impressive.

251
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,032
Nice.

252
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,467
I see you like fighting.

253
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,236
Only when someone forces my hand.

254
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,535
Maybe you weren't prepared.

255
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:17,478
Come.

256
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,416
I don't attack women,
children and old guys.

257
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,649
Don't be scared. Try again.

258
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,693
Look. ..don't force me.

259
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,125
Room no.29.

260
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,398
You sleep after I sleep...

261
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,766
...and vvakeup before I do.

262
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,767
What's 68 in Hindi?

263
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,539
Sixty-eight.

264
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,551
Hi. Harish Shivraman.

265
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,249
This is Subbu. He can't speak.

266
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,347
OKay...

267
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,651
Where's your bed?

268
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,022
Bed.
- Fine.

269
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,431
Now turn on the AC.

270
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,563
AOs on.

271
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,331
Fridge?

272
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,166
Fridge!

273
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,050
We

...wi

 I get something to eat...

274
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,607
You must cook yourself...

275
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,210
Not just for yourself, but everyone.

276
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,049
Today is a special day.

277
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,146
‘Vallam Kalli‘ Boat Race!

278
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,655
Yeah!

279
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,092
‘Vallam Kalli‘...
the Boat Race has begun!

280
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,290
Around 15 teams have
participated this year.

281
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:44,527
And there's a new team
participating as vvell...

282
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,299
...which looks like the
biggest competition here.

283
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,382
Raghav.

284
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,417
Hey move.

285
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,216
Raghav, where are you going?

286
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,257
We've won the trophy.

287
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,256
We're supposed to collect
the trophy back there.

288
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,314
Where are you going?

289
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,753
<i>S*1§*</i>

290
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,121
Who are you looking for, Raghav?

291
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,014
Run!

292
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:41,648
You?

293
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,814
So you remember me.

294
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,147
Hovv can I forget?

295
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,321
You know I felt so guilty.

296
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,251
After meeting me?

297
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,161
Yes. A boy that missed his train.

298
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,267
I missed it intentionally.

299
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,734
I thought...what the point
of catching a train...

300
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,100
...that has no beautiful girl.

301
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,783
Hey...where are you going?

302
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,019
Stop staring.

303
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,049
And praise me if you want to.

304
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,757
Don't you have anything better
to do than getting wet in the rain?

305
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,260
Don't you have anything
to do rather than following me?

306
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:36,136
Listen...do you live in this town?

307
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,606
No.

308
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,233
I came here to meet my grandma.

309
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,602
That's great.

310
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,042
I mean...we can meet every day.

311
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,608
Any special reason for us to meet?

312
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,480
Every time we meet it starts to rain.

313
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,652
Even God wants us to meet.

314
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,493
See that Lighthouse.

315
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,585
They say that the town looks
absolutely beautiful from up there.

316
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,560
I really want to know.

317
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,325
Let's go there.
Come on, let's go.

318
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,260
You really are going to make it big.

319
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,032
Shall we go?

320
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,162
Come on...

321
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,290
If there's connect between us...

322
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,290
...then ne><t time it rains...

323
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,071
We will meet again.

324
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,168
Maybe.

325
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,255
Wait. Wait.

326
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,057
Let's have some fun.
What say?

327
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,734
Dude, this guy's amazing.

328
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,309
KurusvvamFs son.

329
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,676
He's the world champion.

330
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,775
Let's go.

331
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,176
Come, come.

332
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,276
Raghav.

333
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,761
This is their nap time.

334
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,000
Sorry, father. I was only practicing.

335
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,268
Did you eat yet?

336
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,643
Hovv can I eat without you?

337
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,775
I am waiting.

338
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,678
What girl...

339
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,214
Forget that girl.

340
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,557
Don't ever make that
mistake of forgetting her.

341
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,788
Just a minute.

342
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,731
One can even find God
if you truly seek Him.

343
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,168
Why can't you find a girl?

344
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,431
Sure you will.

345
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,503
I can't find the opener.
- Allow me.

346
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,506
Give it.

347
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,480
Oh no...
 drank some of it. .

348
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,483
I'll drink it.

349
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,652
You won't understand his case.

350
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,487
Let me explain you.

351
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,185
Question no.1
...are you from Punjab?

352
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:22,625
With one look I can
say where one belongs from?

353
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,632
For example...

354
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,227
This chicken?

355
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,203
Can you tell me whether
it's home-grown or farm-bred?

356
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,140
Give up?

357
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,267
I'll tell you.

358
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:39,777
It's from the farm.

359
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,508
It's uncooked.

360
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:43,484
That one's better.

361
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,485
No, no...these are uncooked too.

362
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,145
Everything on this table is uncooked...

363
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,246
Then you don't eat it...

364
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,583
You'll get a stomach-infection.

365
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,556
Don't touch.

366
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,160
ls she a stuffed-bread or a rice-cake?

367
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,322
She's a girl.

368
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,727
Then stop wasting
your youth over beer.

369
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,025
Go find her.

370
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,297
Your sweetheart.

371
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,504
And shower all your love on her.

372
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,510
You... - Father? Don't
worry about the father.

373
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,738
Let him go to hell.

374
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,538
If the boy and girl are willing,
to hell with the father.

375
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,607
Hey rice-cake,
stop drinking, you're drunk.

376
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,119
Drink some Sambar instead.

377
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,352
Do you have change for 1000 rupees?

378
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,981
I'll get it.

379
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,057
Sir. Sir...

380
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,652
I am drunk.

381
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,357
No matter hovv early I wake up...

382
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,559
But no student could ever
vvakeup before the Teacher.

383
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,046
What the...
What's your problem?

384
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,509
Go!

385
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,493
Come on!

386
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:04,956
Go!

387
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,409
Come on!

388
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,098
Come on!

389
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,018
You? Here?

390
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,054
Oh. ..you remember?

391
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,423
Of course, champion.

392
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,387
Who is it?

393
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,031
Are you 
\/Ir. PP Khurana?

394
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,725
Myself Nainsukh Khurana!

395
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,628
PP Khurana died yesterday.

396
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,469
Died? How?

397
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,267
I don't know how.

398
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,002
He borrowed 50,000 from me...

399
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,475
...and said he'll double the amount.

400
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,773
But all he gave me was double-shock.

401
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,208
Do you have change for 1000 rupees?

402
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,943
Last note left for buying rations.

403
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,676
Hovv much is that?

404
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,978
Not 1000.
- It's okay, I'll manage.

405
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,454
Were you supposed to take
something from him too? - No.

406
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,515
We're here to give him something.

407
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:13,324
I see...so you're the generous kind.

408
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,464
Come in.

409
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,729
Please, come.
- I was rehearsing for my play...

410
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:23,097
The apple of my Mama's eye...
Nainsukh, the poor boy.

411
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,698
And emotional saga.

412
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,608
Get some tea, dear.

413
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:30,635
9K8)’-

414
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,083
She makes very nice.

415
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:38,220
What are you doing here?
- Tea.

416
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,483
I'll make tea...you go.

417
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,421
He has many kinds
of business in Hong Kong.

418
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,356
I see...

419
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,156
A turnover of 5000.

420
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,389
5000?

421
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,556
5000 crore.

422
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:55,601
Look...coming to the point,
I really like your daughter.

423
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,468
And I want to marry her.

424
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,436

see...!

425
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:05,240
Shouldn't your father
be discussing this with me?

426
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,212
According to our customs, it's always
the elders that bring marriage proposals.

427
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,414
Well, that's okay.
Thank you for the offer.

428
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,619
Tea, please.

429
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,215
Please have.

430
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,250
Have a cup.

431
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,256
Where's Siya?
- She's inside.

432
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,232
I see...

433
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,030
I wonder why she's being so coy.

434
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,364
Oh...these silver cups
are always too hot.

435
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,399
V\/e

...Siya's been getting
such offers since she was a kid.

436
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,173
She just recently signed a film...

437
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,771
...and soon she'll star
of the film industry.

438
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:44,050
I accept...your turnover's more.

439
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,578
But don't mind,
you're a bit older as well.

440
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,455
Fine, fine...
et's do one thing.

441
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,491
Hovv about you ask Gandhiji?
- Meaning.

442
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:02,597
Kusum!

443
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,230
Yes.

444
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,201
Who can be above him?

445
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:07,675
He's the Father of our Nation.

446
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,245
Take the bag, it's a token.

447
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,248
So should I consider this a yes?

448
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,475
Just find an auspicious date.

449
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,575
Okay. . . bye.

450
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,543
See you, friends. Bye.

451
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,708
Stop pouring here.

452
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,038
Rain on his house too.

453
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,381
So that duffer knows
I am waiting for him.

454
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,481
Fine...laugh all you want.

455
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:30,387
Laugh all you want.

456
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,264
I don't love him or anything.

457
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,698
If he would've been here...

458
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,497
...
 would've made him friends.

459
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,730
His bad luck!

460
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,472
Are you done?

461
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,184
If you're done.

462
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,116

Don't ever take it off.

503
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,007
My dad gave me this.

504
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,995
You're really going too far.

505
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,649
This is not some hotel.

506
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:04,358
Listen, Teacher.
I didn't come here willingly.

507
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,001
Yet I am ready to learn...
but you don't teach me.

508
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,364
And I never will.

509
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,633
I don't vvant to learn
this nonsense either.

510
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:14,608
The Shaolins have
the best Martial Arts.

511
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,735
Chinese.

512
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,544
World famous.

513
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,445
l'll go there and learn.

514
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,081
Wait.

515
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,252
And listen.

516
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:32,252
In 1542...Lord Buddha
went to China from India.

517
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:36,361
He laid the foundation
of your so called Shaolin Temple.

518
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:41,694
He...taught the '18 hands
of Buddha‘ technique...

519
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,397
...to the monks there.

520
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:47,304
And it's a part of our
'Adavugal' from our Kalhari.

521
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,467
And for thousands of years...

522
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,480
...it's been practiced as
‘Vadakkan Style‘ of Kallaripattu.

523
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,685
But you won't understand.

524
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,494
Sober yet?

525
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,368
Yes.

526
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:33,080
When a deer wakes up in the jungle...

527
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:38,693
...he thinks, if I don't run
with all my might, then I'll die.

528
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:43,226
The same morning,
a lion wakes up and thinks...

529
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:48,161
...if I don't run with all my might,
then I'll die of starvation.

530
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:53,733
Whether you're a deer or a lion,
you must run.

531
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,445
There's not much of a difference...

532
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,240
...between a rebel and a soldier.

533
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:08,320
It's their motive that
makes them a rebel or a soldier.

534
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,060
Be a rebel.

535
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:13,487
Be a rebel!

536
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,227
But for a cause.

537
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:24,002
Do you want to train
furthermor go back?

538
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,002
When did we ever begin?

539
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,778
Your training began from day 1.

540
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:29,288
<i>"Come on getmget up now."</i>

541
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,093
<i>"Fi// your nerves with passion."</i>

Hey...

554
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:41,027
You're good man.
- Thank you so much, sir.

555
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,468
Not sir. . . Raghav.

556
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:46,466
Keep it up.
Someday I'll call you to Bangkok.

557
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,540
Really?

558
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,541
Yeah.

559
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,565
Siya...does this look special?

560
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,040
It's for teacher.

561
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:21,201
It's just awesome.

562
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,574
Subu...come on, do this.

563
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:26,611

00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:31,517
Ohh...that idiofs coming here too.

567
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:33,477
Dad!

568
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,081
Dad?

569
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,195
He's your dad.
- Yes.

570
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,434
Okay, bye-
- Go, g0, 9°-

571
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:47,658
Ronny...

572
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,433
My second cousin lives on the
third floor. - That one?

573
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:51,734
That window...

574
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:54,607
Hello, uncle.
- Where did your Juliet go?

575
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:55,642
You shou
d've introduced me to her.

576
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,507
What uncle?

577
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,375
Ne><t time for sure.
I am so sorry.

578
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,711
Hovv about a beer?
- I stopped drinking.

579
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:03,049
But you didn't stop treating others?

580
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:07,684
So. . . how's your Juliet?

581
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,649
Did you kiss her yet or not?
- Let it be, uncle.

582
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,654
Why should I tell her?
- So what?

583
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,218
No need to be shy.

584
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,286
Tell me.

585
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:19,259
l'll be really happy
if you kissed her.

586
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,427
You did...didn't you?

587
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:23,402
Yes.

588
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,303
I am really happy-

589
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,439
You'll have to buy me two beers.

590
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,137
All I need is your blessings.

591
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,739
Always...

592
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,352
What happened?

593
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:46,719
These ladies rings are not lucky.
Take it off.

594
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,395
Are you getting married?

595
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,230
Yes.
- When?

596
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,170
I haven't thought about it.
- Don't even think about it.

597
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,367
He didn't pay me.

598
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:02,342
Run away. Get lost.

599
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:08,980
This is not a threat...
it's just an advice...from an elder.

600
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,346
You always talked about
Romeo's and Juliefs.

601
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,350
What happened at the
end of those stories?

602
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,051
Move aside now.

603
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,097
I have to go, move.

604
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:45,451
I'll marry only Siya...

605
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:49,488
Even if I have to...
get rid of him forever.

606
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,584
What did you say?

607
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,722
Greetings, sir.

608
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,462
Get rid of him forever?

609
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:00,191
Will you kill him?

610
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,998
Father...
 love that girl.

611
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:07,574
Humans can achieve victory
over someone with his power.

612
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:09,439
Make him bow.

613
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,409
But never attain love.

614
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,674
I won't allow this injustice
as long as I am alive.

615
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:38,467
Sorry, father.

616
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:54,512
I've finalized your wedding date.

617
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,083
Yes.

618
00:56:58,115 --> 00:56:59,423
We must go to Ivlangalore tomorrow...

619
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,019
...to give the auspicious token.

620
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,991
Thank you so much.

621
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,464
Ronny, come.

622
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,329
Raghavs sent for you.
- Raghav!

623
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,435
Me?

624
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,435
Just 5 minutes.
Let the kid finish his ice-cream.

625
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,441
What do we do until then? Huh?

626
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,033
Play volleyball?

627
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:58,345
You decide.

628
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:06,049
Sorry, sorry.

629
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,349
Don't touch the kid.
- Sorry.

630
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,115
My mistake.
Please... Please...

631
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,060
I am sorry.

632
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:21,698
Bye, son.

633
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,562
Finish your ice-cream and come soon.

634
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,166
Subbu!

635
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,541
Subbu!

636
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:40,713
Wait!

637
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:42,985
Subbu!

638
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,267
Come, come, come.

639
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,406
Hey Subbu. Don't cry.

640
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:00,032
No. I am right here.

641
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,269
You want baby. Come.

642
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,237
Please come, Subbu.

643
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,644
Let him go.

644
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,348
No.

645
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,788
Subbu!

646
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:35,437
Subbu!

647
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:57,630
Subbu?

648
01:00:57,688 --> 01:01:00,259
Subbu!

649
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,736
Subbu!

650
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:14,477
Look. You want the kid.

651
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,642
Should I let him go?

652
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,412
Should I let him go?

653
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:21,183
Here...see.

654
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,300
You okay?

655
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,100
You okay?

656
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:45,320
You're a kid...and you'll
always be a kid.

657
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:49,088
No one could ever match
me...and no one ever will.

658
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,600
Now this fight will
end with your death.

659
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,695
Raghav?

660
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,740
What's this fight for?

661
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:42,449
Hovv has that kid harmed you?

662
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:44,382
You're the reason...

663
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,145
...by coming in Siya's life.

664
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:50,253
Siya?

665
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:53,260
Yes...
 love her.

666
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:58,062
But she loves me.
- Women only love power.

667
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:00,030
You can't even save yourself...

668
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,535
...how will you save her?

669
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:14,515
I can die for her...can you?
Then come forward.

670
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,042
Come on.

671
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:26,119
You're dead!

672
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,651
What's the hurry?

673
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,027
I am just getting started.

674
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,817
Okay, okay...don't be afraid.

675
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,662
It's a new place...new life.

676
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:36,561
I can understand, yeah.

677
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,566
lam not the kind of girl you think.

678
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:41,831
When I get a chance...

679
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,206
...
 will kill you.

680
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,263
This is what I love about you.

681
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,173
You're different.

682
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,337
I admit I came quite
late in your life.

683
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:54,871
It doesn't mean I am wrong.

684
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,814
Okay, okay, don't be scared.

685
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:59,786

...won't touch you...

686
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,687
Until we don't get married.

687
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:03,785
Marry...

688
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,350
With you...

689
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:09,256
I wish you had read ‘The Ramayan‘.

690
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,789
Then you would've known
that it's not possible.

691
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:17,138
Stories change with time.

692
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:23,272
And yes...this is my city.

693
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,404
Don't think someone
will come to save you.

694
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:43,453
I love you.

695
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:49,561
<i>"Your eyes. ..are uniquely charming."</i>

696
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:56,576
<i>"Your breath makes my heart soar..."</i>

697
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,170
<i>"Such is your grace."</i>

698
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:03,376
<i>"Your eyes. ..are uniquely charming."</i>

699
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,885
Hey, what are you doing?

700
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,487
Cleaning my ta><i.
- Oh, this is not your ta><i.

701
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,686
Didn't you pull the handbrake,
the car's driving away.

702
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:14,455
Wait, wait wait!

703
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:19,223
No, no. ..sorry, sorry.

704
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:21,064
He's blind.

705
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,627
Do you want your license revoked?
- He blind.

706
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:25,729
on, blind.

707
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,307
Okay, give me a hug.

708
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,309
Hug, me?
- Yes, hug.

709
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,442
Sorry! Sorry!

710
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,741
Jaaki Ivlaaki,
did I do something good to her...

711
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,678
...that she's hugging me?

712
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,442
Brother-in-law, think about my sister.

713
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,713
That's exactly why I am hugging her,
you rascal.

714
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:39,583
You can't see the world...

715
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,643
...but you know exactly
where my cheeks are.

716
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,451
It's Valentine's Day...

717
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,082
She's gone.

718
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:44,852
She's gone.

719
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,483
We

...at least this
way I also cleaned my car.

720
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,584
Brother-in-law.
- What?

721
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,426
Passengeﬁs coming.
- Passenger?

722
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:51,659
Yes.

723
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,332
ls he Indian?
- Doesn't look like one.

724
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:57,429
ls he peeing in the bushes?
- Doesn't look like it.

725
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,565
ls he ogling at the girls?
- Doesn't look like it.

726
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,700
Then...
- Then he must be Italian.

727
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:05,474
If he's 
ta
ian...he
won't doubt us either.

728
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:08,343
Brother-in-law...good looks,
black jacket.

729
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:13,713
Fair face...blackjacket. Italian!

730
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:18,050
Chungking Street.

731
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,463
He's saying Chungking Street.

732
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,793
Think about my sister.

733
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,295
Come on...come.

734
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:34,264
Are you going to tell me, Jaki Ivlaki?

735
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,367
2 breaths straight, 2 degrees right...

736
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:37,741
...then keep going
straight for 1O breaths.

737
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,575
2 breaths straight...

738
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:41,274
2 degree left...

739
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,248
1O breaths ahead.

740
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:46,620
Slow. ..s
ow. ..s
ow. ..
- Slow...

741
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,485
Keep going. Keep going.

742
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:51,287
Keep going for 1O breaths.

743
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:54,287
Answer the phone, son.

744
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,427
What's the point?
Must be our creditors.

745
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:00,297
Could be your sister too?
- Why will sister call?

746
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:03,270
You just recently became uncle.

747
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,533
You haven't gone home for 2 years...

748
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:06,665
...yet you're having kids.

749
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,073
Shut up.
- You shut up, you blind man.

750
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:11,442
Abuse me in Hindi if you want.

751
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,708
Otherwise the Italian
will get suspicious.

752
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,306
I won't get suspicious at all.

753
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:19,350
Jaki Ivlaki, she's speaking in Hindi.

754
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,352
Indian?

755
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,122
Please don't complain about us.

756
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,451
He's got a license, but he can't see.

757
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:26,516
I can see, but I can't drive.

758
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,062
Say something, brother-in-law.

759
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:31,224
What can I say? I am in big trouble.

760
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:34,291
Someone kept my
passport as collateral.

761
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:35,734
Even my car's mortgaged.

762
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:40,537
I'm knee deep in loans. Haven't
seen my wife and kids for two years.

763
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:43,635
All I want is to go back to India,
that's all.

764
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,646
Look, I don't have time.
- You don't have time.

765
01:11:47,704 --> 01:11:50,241
Then watch my Hanuman gear.

766
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,616
You won't find a
driver like in Bangkok.

767
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:53,710
Lead the path, son.

768
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,848
Brother-in-law, 8 breaths straight.
- 8 breaths straight.

769
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:01,825
4 degrees right.
- 4 degrees right!

770
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:04,588
5 breaths straight...straight.
- 5 breaths straight.

771
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:05,689
ls everything alright?

772
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:07,735
Keep going.

773
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:13,502
2 degrees, left. Stop!
- 2 degrees, left. Stop!

774
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:16,243
Hail, Hanuman.
- Hail, Hanuman.

775
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:19,280
4O minutes journey
completed in 3O minutes.

776
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:21,544
Be careful.

777
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:24,744
Careful...careful...l love my taxi.

778
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:29,818
He hit again.
- He tipped us vvell, brother-in-law.

779
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:32,488
Brother-in-law.
- Yes.

780
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:35,359
Hovv long are we going to keep this up?
- As long as we can.

781
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:37,260
Until I don't go back to India.

782
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,426
l'll keep driving like this.

783
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,593
Who is it?
- It's the Italian.

784
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:43,796
Why is he back?

785
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:45,567
What is it?

786
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,108
Do you want to make more money?
- How?

787
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,170
Hovv much?

788
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,580
1O times more.
- Yes, I do. I do.

789
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,416
Come along them.
- Coming.

790
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,209
Lon! Lon!

791
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:00,549

792
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:02,488

Lon! Lon!

796
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:25,045
Come on Lon, the champion.

797
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,792
Go! Go! Go!

798
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:46,431
Come on, do it.

799
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,730
Go! Go! Go!

800
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,260
Yes!

801
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:52,670
Champion tonight is Lon.

802
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:58,239
Anybody wants to challenge Lon?

803
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:00,804
Anybody?
Anybody wants to challenge Lon?

804
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,279
Bet everything.

805
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:10,186
Brother-in-law, what was he saying?

806
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:13,055
He says he will win,
bet everything.

807
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:14,390
What should we do? Bet it?

808
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,033
Here's the new challenger
to challenge Lod.

809
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,532
Here. You do it too.

810
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,665
There's a new challenger
who's going to challenge Lon.

811
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:29,733
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the new fight about begin.

812
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:33,038
Come on.

813
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:38,074
The Indian man is
challenging the champion Loci.

814
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:43,156
Hovv tall is the Italian?
- 5ft 1O inches.

815
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,623
5ft 1O inches.

816
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,388
And the other guy?
- 7 feet!

817
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:48,292
Huh?
- 7 feet.

818
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:51,224
Then bet everything on the 7 footer.

819
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,425
We'll definitely win today.

820
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,369
Okay, let the fight begin.

821
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:58,530
Come on!

822
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:17,717
He's down.

823
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,690
He's down!

824
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:22,422
<i>"Plunder us, Durbeen. "</i>

825
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:24,795
<i>"Plunder us, Durbeen. "</i>

826
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,157
Italian.

827
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,031
He gave up his life for us.

828
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:33,167
Jaki Ivlaki! Where are you?

829
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,607
Hey...7 footer.
Where are you?

830
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:37,801
Thank you...for making us win.

831
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:39,137
For sending me back to India.

832
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:42,809
Don't send us back like this?
Let me enjoy the show.

833
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:44,676
Hello! Hello!

834
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:47,219
These guys don't
let you enjoy the game.

835
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,448
Brother-in-law.
- Yeah.

836
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,491
The 7 footer is down.
- Very nice.

837
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,492
The 7 footer is down?

838
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:00,632
Pause that!

839
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:11,609
Cheers.
- What cheers?

840
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,241
We lost everything and cheers.

841
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,273
See hovv we live, Italian.

842
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:20,781
Brother, stay here for us.

843
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:24,786
Fight again tomorrow.
And send us back to India. I beg you.

844
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:26,115
This way.

845
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,492
Why don't you join hands
when you can see them?

846
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:29,689
Please.
- Yes.

847
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:30,697
Please fight for us.
- Plesae.

848
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:31,629
We want to go back to India.

849
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:32,462
Please.

850
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:50,743
Should we burn him
in the same flames?

851
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:54,747
That will make him
a hero in Siya's eyes.

852
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:57,513
But we must do something.

853
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:00,117
Someone else is going to do it.

854
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:16,638
I never listened to
anyone in my life.

855
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:19,644
Rebelled against everything.

856
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,147
But you turned this
rebel into a human being.

857
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:30,757
So I promise you...

858
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,825
Everything you taught me...
I'll take it further.

859
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,558
I'll never take any wrong step...

860
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,735
...that can taint your name.

861
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,148
I can never repay
my teacher's favor.

862
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,323
But I will try.

863
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,684
So that one day the
whole world will know...

864
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:10,559
...about this art in India.

865
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:13,596
And a stubborn teacher.

866
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,063
Who would never sleep...

867
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,268
...nor would he let
his students sleep.

868
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:40,524
What's going on?

869
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,093
You are under arrest.

870
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:46,467
You beat people up...

871
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,396
Endangered lives at the petrol pump.

872
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:51,533
Take him to the van.
- Come on!

873
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,054
Have you lost your mind?

874
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,755
It's true, Siya.

875
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:22,601
Your father along with
Raghav planned everything.

876
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:24,534
Why would he do such a thing?

877
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,434
To separate us!

878
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:33,446
If he wanted to separate us, then
he would've never bailed you out.

879
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,573
So that you don't believe me.

880
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:40,687
And I guess he has
succeeded in his plans.

881
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:43,582
You can think so low...

882
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,519
...
 shou
d've understood this before.

883
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:53,525
You will never understand, what
a daughter means for his father.

884
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:55,591
I thought you won't understand.

885
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,105
By the time you do understand...

886
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:01,400
...it will be too late.

887
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:06,446
I will tread ahead,
on the path teacher showed me.

888
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:11,310
My train leaves at
6 o'clock in the morning.

889
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,446
If you come to see me off...

890
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,420
...
'

 think you love
me as much as I love you.

891
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:20,185
Or e
se...?

892
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,085
Or what?

893
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,799
I haven't thought about yet...

894
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:32,199
<i>"Your footprints. ..in my path..."
- Ronny! Ronny!</i>

895
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:35,136
<i>"Said to me. "</i>

896
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:39,338
<i>"Said to me."
- Ronny, no!</i>

897
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:45,784
<i>"Your breathmentwined with mine..."</i>

898
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,344
<i>"Said to me."
- Don't cry like this, dear.</i>

899
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:51,153
Your father's gone to explain him.

900
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:55,457
All the misunderstandings
will be cleared.

901
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:58,756
Your grandma is right, dear.
Don't cry, everything will be fine.

902
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:01,165
Ronny is not a bad guy.

903
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:03,403
Look, dear. Listen to me.

904
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:05,200
It's definitely something else.

905
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:07,137
Your father is no saint.

906
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:09,607
I am there, don't vvorry.

907
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:12,541
I and your mother will explain Ronny.

908
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:13,636
Have faith.

909
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,181
Everything will be fine.

910
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,217
Just stop crying now.

911
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,742
Daddy.

912
01:21:19,809 --> 01:21:22,153
Oh, God! What happened?

913
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,747
You're bleeding.

914
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:25,786
Khurana is still alive, I am alright.

915
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,185
Go inside.

916
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,225
on, God!

917
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:30,730
Mother... I am fine.

918
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:34,328
Come...come Kusum, let's go inside.

919
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,198
Who did it?

920
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:36,359
Let it be, dear.

921
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:38,070
Who did it?

922
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,367
Ronny.
- Ronny?

923
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:45,209
I was only explaining him, that
he's got the wrong idea.

924
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,338
Come back, talk to her.

925
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:49,245
But he hit me, dear.

926
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:53,449
I am greedy, fraud, lowlife...
and many other things.

927
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:56,852
And thismring,
he threw it on my face.

928
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,183
Ronny was really angry, dear.

929
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,423
Raghavs after us too.

930
01:22:01,484 --> 01:22:03,361
And now this boy.

931
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:07,793
Everything will be fine, dear.

932
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,468
Everything will be fine.

933
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:14,302
Nothing will be fine.

934
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,370
Now we won't stay here.

935
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,178
We'll leave this city tomorrow.

936
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:32,120
<i>"There's something like you... in
these tears trickling down my face."</i>

937
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:37,153
<i>"/ wouldn't be lost in these tears."</i>

938
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:40,360

<i>. . I wou/dn ‘I have cried. "</i>

946
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:29,714
Open the door.
- Who is it?

947
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:31,516
Who is it?

948
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,517
_ WhawVVho?
S happSning?

949
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:34,584
I guess they are here.

950
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:35,621
Who?

951
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:36,348
Who's here?

952
01:23:36,412 --> 01:23:37,288
Rats?

953
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,456
Out of their burrow?

954
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,458
Meaning?

955
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:41,055
Open.

956
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:42,220
Let's make them run.

957
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:43,459
Run.

958
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,226
Where are you going?

959
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:48,763
Catch them!

960
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:51,135
Goons are coming after that Italian.

961
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:52,695
Why are they coming after us?

962
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,741
Goons. Run.
Right. Right.

963
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:55,741
Run.

964
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:57,471
Come on, move that side.

965
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,308
Run! Run!

966
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,423
Come on, catch them.

967
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:33,769
Let's take the car.

968
01:24:34,036 --> 01:24:35,572
Where? Where?
- 2 breaths straight.

969
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:36,742
Come on.

970
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:38,645
Straight.

971
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,407
Straight.

972
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,312
Goons are after us.

973
01:25:43,072 --> 01:25:45,052
Stop fooling around.

974
01:25:45,107 --> 01:25:45,778
Brother-in-law. . . basket. . .jump.

975
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,486
Basket...jump!

976
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:50,353
Table-roll! Table-roll!
- Table-roll! Now?

977
01:25:50,412 --> 01:25:51,720
Left. Left.

978
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,350
Run straight. Where are you going?

979
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:54,793
Eat some cabbage.

980
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,552
I'll get you in the Olympics.

981
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,449
Straight! Straight!

982
01:26:53,509 --> 01:26:56,251
What straight? I won't run.

983
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:58,391
And anyway, the lands here...

984
01:26:58,747 --> 01:27:01,125
There you are Sukhi,
I was speaking that way.

985
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:02,454
Sukhi.

986
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:04,059
My brother.

987
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,229
I can't run anymore.

988
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:08,461
Why don't you ask some aunty,
to lift me up.

989
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:11,232
And sing that sad song...

990
01:27:11,293 --> 01:27:13,295
<i>"Plunder us Durbeen. "</i>

991
01:27:13,362 --> 01:27:15,308
<i>"Plunder us Durbeen. "</i>

992
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:17,674
<i>"Plunder us Durbeen. "
You sound so different...</i>

993
01:27:19,168 --> 01:27:20,738
You dare hit your brother-in-law.

994
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,582
Not everyone's Sukhi.

995
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,810
Straight. Two breaths straight.

996
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:02,719
I don't have 2 breaths
left to run straight...

997
01:28:04,413 --> 01:28:05,153
Turn right.

998
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:06,658
Right? Take right...

999
01:28:15,424 --> 01:28:17,097
Where is Indian fighter?

1000
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:18,433
I am right here.

1001
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:33,478
Where's Biju?

1002
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,421
Where is he?

1003
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44,258
24, Cut Square.

1004
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,197
Biju.

1005
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,769
Oh, God. Biju.

1006
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:00,847
Hey. . . Ronny, you here?

1007
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:02,515
Where's Siya?

1008
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:07,381
Look...vvhat you're
doing...is a big mistake.

1009
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:11,048
Biju.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1010
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,390
Where's Siya?

1011
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:15,326
Look. . . listen to me.

1012
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:17,719
Raghav is no smalltime criminal.

1013
01:29:17,786 --> 01:29:19,288
No one can think of getting to him...

1014
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,459
...unti
 he doesn't want them to.

1015
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:22,365
Get me?

1016
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:24,638
Hey...vvait a minute.

1017
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,728
You want to know, don't you?

1018
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:29,075

...
'

 tell you everything.

1019
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:31,805
That building's entrance is guarded
by armed guards...

1020
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:34,477
...meta
 detectors
and ><-ray machines.

1021
01:29:35,237 --> 01:29:36,807

\/Ieaning...you can't even
take a needle inside.

1022
01:29:37,406 --> 01:29:40,285
Elevators can only be
accessed through fingerprint.

1023
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,580
Raghavs private
army is on every floor.

1024
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,291
Professional Killers, Swordsmen. ..

1025
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:49,385
Martial Artists!

1026
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,288
Raghav brings fighters from India...

1027
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:52,457
...and gets them killed out here.

1028
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:58,260
And even if someone
manages to escape them...

1029
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:00,632
...then before he can get to Raghav,
he has to face Yong.

1030
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,231
And Yong isn't human being,
he's a killing machine...

1031
01:30:03,265 --> 01:30:04,676
mimported from China.

1032
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:08,274
Above all this is
Raghavs penthouse...

1033
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:11,449
...where he's kept Siya right now.

1034
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:37,633
I promised...
 won't touch
you until we're not married.

1035
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,179
I am sorry.

1036
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:58,489
Hey, stop!

1037
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:03,135
Leave me!

1038
01:31:25,781 --> 01:31:26,816
Now touch me.

1039
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:28,323
Stop.

1040
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,429
Siya?

1041
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:33,392
siya, you okay.

1042
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:34,659
Siya.

1043
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:35,724
Siya, no. No!

1044
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:37,565
Somebody call the ambulance.

1045
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:53,753
Hello. Yes. Raghav.

1046
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:55,754
What?

1047
01:31:56,144 --> 01:31:58,283
I am coming. I'm coming right away.

1048
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,362
Raghavs taken Siya to the hospital.

1049
01:32:04,586 --> 01:32:05,792
Which hospital?

1050
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:09,165
Sorry, Ronny. I can't tell you.
- Biju. Please.

1051
01:32:09,391 --> 01:32:11,371
I don't have much time.

1052
01:32:11,593 --> 01:32:14,733
Which hospital?
- Look, Ronny. I beg you. - Biju. Please.

1053
01:32:14,796 --> 01:32:16,275
There's nothing more I can say.

1054
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:18,209
Raghav will kill me and my family.

1055
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:20,268
No, no, no.
- Ronny, listen to me.

1056
01:32:20,335 --> 01:32:22,281
Ronny, no.
- No.

1057
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:25,410
I beg you Ronn
_ NO! Y-

1058
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:27,218
Stop, brother-in-law.

1059
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:28,310
Stopped.

1060
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,418
Wait for my phone call.

1061
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,418
Careful. Careful.

1062
01:32:34,783 --> 01:32:36,262
Even he's breaking the car.

1063
01:32:36,785 --> 01:32:40,232
Let him sit here,
and I'll lie down in his place.

1064
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:25,169
Brother!

1065
01:33:31,373 --> 01:33:33,546
Brother!

1066
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,150
Yong, what the hell are you doing?

1067
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:40,221
Sir, actually his brother
isn't answering his phone.

1068
01:33:40,415 --> 01:33:41,450
So he's worried.

1069
01:33:41,516 --> 01:33:43,587
Where's Biju?
- He's on his way, sir.

1070
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,058
Medicine time.

1071
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:03,733
Brother...
- Kim, where the hell have you been?

1072
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:05,502
I am in the car.

1073
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:07,205
In the car?
- Locked up?

1074
01:35:07,269 --> 01:35:08,111
Locked up?

1075
01:35:08,303 --> 01:35:09,304
Indian?

1076
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:10,372
Indian?

1077
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:12,083
Okay, don't move.

1078
01:35:12,173 --> 01:35:14,175
Don't hang up, I am coming.

1079

Ma'am.

1082
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:24,686
Who are you?

1083
01:35:24,753 --> 01:35:26,664
I am calling security right now.

Keep moving.

1088
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:08,199
Stop there.

1089
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:11,709
Turn around.

1090
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:21,448
Remove your mask.

1091
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:46,741
You made it this far,
hovv will you get out now?

1092
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:48,673
Game over.

1093
01:36:49,204 --> 01:36:51,411
I said it before...and
I'll say it again.

1094
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:54,452
I'm just getting started.

1095
01:36:56,744 --> 01:36:59,281
No...
- Take another step and I'll cut her.

1096
01:36:59,347 --> 01:37:01,793
Don't...don't...take it off.

1097
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:03,552
Doesn't make a difference to me.

1098
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:05,726
Guns down!

1099
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:07,460
Okay, okay...

1100
01:37:10,725 --> 01:37:13,604
You too...guns down.
- Okay.

1101
01:37:16,064 --> 01:37:17,543
Now don't move.

1102
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:19,710
Go.

1104
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:57,613
Hey, Indian!

1105
01:37:57,639 --> 01:37:59,141
Stop.

1106
01:38:03,445 --> 01:38:05,482
Careful, I love my taxi.

1107
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:07,584
Brother-in-law,
go, go, go, fast.

1108
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:08,753
Shoot him.

1109
01:38:18,126 --> 01:38:20,197
Did I run-over a dog?

1110
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:23,338
Say something.

1111
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:25,506
No, no, no. Don't shoot.

1112
01:38:25,667 --> 01:38:27,340
Don't shoot. - No!

1113
01:38:28,136 --> 01:38:30,309
Open the boot.
- Open it, brother-in-law.

1114
01:38:31,206 --> 01:38:31,650
Hey, stop.

1115
01:38:31,706 --> 01:38:32,616
Don't shoot

1116
01:38:39,347 --> 01:38:40,291

No!

1120
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:04,781
No, no, no need to be worried.

1121
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:06,512
I've arranged for everything.

1122
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:08,679
This boat will take you to Karabi.

1123
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:10,813
I've called Vibhu, he'll come see you.

1124
01:39:11,179 --> 01:39:12,624
He's an Indian, runs a resort.

1125
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,455
He'll get you a passport as well.

1126
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,261
Dear.

1127
01:39:16,518 --> 01:39:17,690
Siya.

1128
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:19,263
Yes.

1129
01:39:25,727 --> 01:39:30,642
I don't know whether this Hanuman
can ever go back to India or not.

1130
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:34,671
Whether l'll get
to see my family or not.

1131
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:37,511
Siya, don't let go of this hand.

1132
01:39:37,572 --> 01:39:38,607
Brother-in-law.

1133
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:48,422
The boatman is saying we leave now.
- It's okay.

1134
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:55,458
Best of luck.
- This way. This way.

1135
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:56,831
Best of luck.

1136
01:40:00,094 --> 01:40:01,266
Yes?

1137
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:02,399
Who are you talking to?

1138
01:40:02,464 --> 01:40:04,535
Madam came back halfway.
- Siya.

1139
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:08,174
Why did you come back?

1140
01:40:10,538 --> 01:40:11,642
What's this?

1141
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:17,517
Whatever it is...it's very expensive.

1142
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:23,420
All your dreams...vvi

1143
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:29,232

01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,487
I had to show you my face again.

1169

I didn't send you an invitation.

1172
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,763
I didn't come because
we ever had something.

1173
01:43:23,298 --> 01:43:25,278
I am getting paid for what I did.

1255
01:58:17,324 --> 01:58:18,769
Let's have some fun.

1256
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:00,816
Siya.

1257
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:05,858
Yong.

1258
02:02:07,421 --> 02:02:08,456
Kill both of them.

1259
02:03:31,271 --> 02:03:33,182
You kill my brother.

1260
02:03:33,373 --> 02:03:37,116
You 
ndian...you think you can fight.

1261
02:03:38,311 --> 02:03:41,815
We fight. ..Chinese fight.

1262
02:04:45,044 --> 02:04:46,079
Sorry...

1263
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:49,357
Chinese stuff doesn't last too long.

1264
02:05:19,245 --> 02:05:21,384
Only one of us can go out alive.

1265
02:05:24,184 --> 02:05:25,356
Me or him!

1266
02:05:28,121 --> 02:05:30,226
You can go back from here.

1267
02:05:44,204 --> 02:05:48,118
A few months training
doesn't make you a champion.

1268
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:50,687
It takes years.

1269
02:05:51,778 --> 02:05:54,418
There's a difference
between horses and donkeys.

1270
02:06:27,714 --> 02:06:30,024
Come on. Come on, fight.

1271
02:07:00,713 --> 02:07:01,691
That's it?

1272
02:07:02,715 --> 02:07:03,693
That's it?

1273
02:07:05,251 --> 02:07:06,730
Champion, huh!

1274
02:07:07,253 --> 02:07:10,257
I even killed my father for her.

1275
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:12,736
You're nothing.

1276
02:07:46,359 --> 02:07:47,531
Master's still alive.

1277
02:07:50,863 --> 02:07:53,275
He still runs through my veins.

1278
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:57,706
You maybe his blood.

1279
02:08:01,274 --> 02:08:03,618
But I have his talent.

1280
02:08:03,843 --> 02:08:05,220
Oh really!

1281
02:08:06,513 --> 02:08:08,584
That's why you were
flat on the ground...

1282
02:08:09,149 --> 02:08:11,322
...and I am standing on my legs.

1283
02:08:12,552 --> 02:08:13,826
What's the hurry?

1284
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:22,168
I am just getting started.

1285
02:10:29,455 --> 02:10:30,695
Are you ready for this?

1286
02:10:32,058 --> 02:10:33,435
I am just getting started.

1287
02:11:28,814 --> 02:11:31,488

1300
02:12:27,673 --> 02:12:30,244

1301
02:12:30,476 --> 02:12:33,184
<i>"Be tougher than that."</i>

1302
02:12:33,245 --> 02:12:35,782
"Keep moving ahead every second."

1303
02:12:36,049 --> 02:12:38,620
<i>"Get to the destination."</i>

1304
02:12:38,684 --> 02:12:41,665
<i>"Make your future

1305
02:12:41,687 --> 02:12:44,327
