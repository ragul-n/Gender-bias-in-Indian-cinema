1
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,572
- How is the dress?
- It's beautiful.

2
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:50,600
- My uncle bought it from Mumbai.
- Where is he?

3
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:55,212
- He's on his way here.
- Be careful, he might let you down.

4
00:00:55,548 --> 00:01:00,486
He's not that type, he'll
be with me till the end.

5
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:03,288
It is almost time and we are tensed!

6
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:06,417
I am going to elope, and my uncle is
helping me...

7
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:09,656
- Why are you so tensed?
- Welcome! How are you?

8
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,132
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

9
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,499
This is Ragupathy, head of this family.

10
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:20,139
He's a big fan of MGR and wanted to be an
actor like him..

11
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,473
...but due to circumstances, he became a
businessman.

12
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:26,677
Still not finished decorating?

13
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:28,679
- You should have done this earlier.
- It's done!

14
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:32,684
The bride's wedding saree is not here yet,
it's almost time.

15
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:34,516
Don't worry! it'll be here soon.

16
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,322
This is Raghavan, like Raman and
Letchumanan..

17
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:38,558
...he is Ragupathy's brother.

18
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,651
He'll calm down the very next minute.

19
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:43,721
- This is too much!
- Sathya!

20
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,725
Why are you wasting time here instead of
helping the bride?

21
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:50,330
- Kalpana's friends are helping her.
- You didn't help?

22
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,541
He's Rajaram. He's always relaxed because
of his two brothers.

23
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:58,102
- Are you done?
- What do you want?

24
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:04,082
She's Baratham, Ragupathy's sister. Standing
beside is her husband.

25
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,678
Brother! We must take the
bride to the temple..

26
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:10,323
...but the wedding saree is not here yet.
- It will.

27
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,622
- Swamiji is in 'samadhi' (tomb).
- When did he die?

28
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:18,195
- Silly! He's meditating.
- Is it?

29
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:21,094
Will he be late? We have to be in temple in...

30
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:24,692
- No. The saree will be here in 5 minutes.
- How sure are you?

31
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,471
Because, Siva is bringing the saree.

32
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,101
Shastri, please get down.

33
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:03,236
- Welcome Shastri! How are you?
- Do I look fine?

34
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:06,478
- Did my son do anything?
- He scared me off!

35
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,448
That's why we are delayed.

36
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,319
- The wedding saree!
- It's already late, pass this to Kalpana.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,086
- How is Ganabathy Sasthri?
- He's fine.

38
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:22,659
Why are you late?

39
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:25,496
You think it's easy to arrange a registered
marriage?

40
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:28,300
Must manage the registrar and witness...

41
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,633
...only then can get married.

42
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:37,506
This is from Swamiji. Get ready and get
blessing from all.

43
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:47,114
- Uncle! I love you!
- Love you too! Get ready fast!

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,315
Come here puppy!

45
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:58,764
- It loves you so much.
- You are right.

46
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,666
It loves me as its own mother.

47
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,626
It was still small back in the ashram, now it
has grown bigger.

48
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:08,067
Siva, tell me what's the
matter, I'm very busy.

49
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,310
- Wait uncle, I will tell you.
- It's time to go to temple.

50
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:15,145
- Yes!
- Wait! Look there.

51
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:30,424
Come!

52
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,097
See how pretty she is in her wedding saree.

53
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:40,502
- I called you all to see her.
- We could see her later.

54
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:43,642
- I don't know if you can see her after this.
- What?

55
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:47,443
- Can't see her after this?
- Everyone will be busy after this..

56
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,215
...so will not have time to see her.

57
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:51,649
- You are right.
- Right isn't? Get blessings.

58
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,645
God bless you!

59
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,457
What's the hurry? This should be done after
the wedding.

60
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:02,451
We'll be too tired to give our blessings.
We'll only be yawning.

61
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:05,397
- Are you done?
- Yes!

62
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:09,301
- Let's go! You can all go now.
- Let's go!

63
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:12,428
- He is behaving like an old man.
- There are so many things to do and he is...

64
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:17,575
- What is the surprise you were talking about?
- It's nothing!

65
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,073
Go to Kalpana's room in 10 minutes,
and you'll see.

66
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:31,655
Kalpana? Where is she?

67
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:35,661
Brother!

68
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:52,712
So much of work!

69
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:55,347
Somehow you managed to get Kalpana
married to her lover.

70
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:56,713
...and she looks very happy now.

71
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,450
If you could only unite me with professor
Pushpa...

72
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:01,187
...I will never come to college after this.

73
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:05,357
Can you stop talking? Siva, what are you
going to do now?

74
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,191
How are you going to convince your family?

75
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,384
They will hit me with their slippers if I go
back now.

76
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:14,065
I can't go back. I need
to lay low for a while.

77
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,503
I'll stay in hostel and college..

78
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,373
...and enjoy myself for some time.

79
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,399
- Superb!
- Come Siva!

80
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,514
Despite so many people in the house..

81
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:33,418
...no one knew what happened? What were
all of you doing?

82
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,455
He said he wanted to surprise us..

83
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:39,524
...but no one expected him to do this.

84
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:44,429
No one knew she was in love with a guy?

85
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,562
And he made a fool of us by uniting her
with her lover!

86
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,666
From now on, we have
severed all ties with him.

87
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:59,110
He must never step foot into this house..

88
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:02,644
...no one should even mention his name.

89
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:30,255
The exam is finally over. Must find a way
to sell these books.

90
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:32,517
- David, will you pass your exam this year?
- Definitely!

91
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:35,322
- How can you be so sure?
- You are confident you did well?

92
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:39,130
- Of course! I will definitely pass.
- It means I will also pass.

93
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:41,531
- How?
- Because I wrote my id on your answer sheet.

94
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:45,533
- What?
- No one has left yet?

95
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,407
Only people like you will go back home.

96
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,176
We are discussing whether to drink beer
or not.

97
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:53,311
What do you want?

98
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,678
Look Siva, he's teasing me. Seenu, here
is your book.

99
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,609
Where is Seenu?

100
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,577
He's been missing for the past 2 days.
Where is he?

101
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:07,354
He looked dull during exam. I think he's
having some problems.

102
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,596
- We'll pass his place on the way back right?
- Yes!

103
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:15,498
- We'll drop by and see him.
- Okay! Let's go.

104
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:23,237
You'll die without her, is that right?

105
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,112
She'll die without me.

106
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:31,209
Never trust a woman, especially when she
uses this dialogue.

107
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:36,354
- When is the wedding?
- Today!

108
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:40,382
- Today?
- Why tell at the very last minute?!

109
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,162
You go and get ready, we will kidnap the
bride and come.

110
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,298
Kidnap? David, you better escape.

111
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:51,736
You guys stay and conduct the wedding,
I have something urgent to do.

112
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:53,602
My keys!

113
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,775
Siva, please don't do it!

114
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,505
Who cares if he gets married or not?

115
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,679
Why are you still sitting here? Go and
get ready.

116
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,671
Listen to me! Let's just go back.

117
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,609
Ask him which wedding hall?

118
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:16,656
Not bad. Everything is going smoothly so far.

119
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:22,092
- Who are you guys?
- We are the bride's friends...

120
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,429
...and have come to see her.

121
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,962
She'll be going to the wedding hall shortly,
can't you see her there?

122
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,568
- That will be too late.
- She's flying off shortly.

123
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,635
She came all the way to see her. She won't
take long.

124
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:36,314
- Please brother?
- Okay!

125
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:40,274
- Thanks! He's so sweet right?
- Hurry up!

126
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,155
- What?
- We both will be here.

127
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:47,387
You go and bring the bride.

128
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,697
This is the one! Quickly knock!

129
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:55,097
Knock the door!

130
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,399
Wait!

131
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:07,077
Walk faster before he sees us.

132
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:12,684
- Give way! Give way!
- What happened?

133
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:14,420
She's unwell, taking her to the hospital.

134
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,618
- What happened?
- Nothing! Go and start the car.

135
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,994
- Give way! Give way!
- What happened?

136
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:26,287
She fainted and we are taking her to the
hospital.

137
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:29,663
- Give way! Give way!
- Give way!

138
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:34,435
She's so heavy. Pity Sreenivasan. Just dump
her inside.

139
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,613
Brother, the bride is missing.

140
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:49,279
Another wedding seems to be going on.

141
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:51,079
It's our Seenu!

142
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,947
- What's happening here?
- Let's go stop it.

143
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,527
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting married.

144
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:03,364
We brought your lover but you..
How dare you...?

145
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:07,467
Siva, they are hitting me in front of you.

146
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:11,376
- How can I keep quiet if you scold my lover?
- Lover?

147
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:13,278
- Who's that girl then?
- That girl?

148
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,474
- Which girl?
- Who is this?

149
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:19,074
- She's the one.
- Which girl is this?

150
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:22,078
- This is my lover.
- Then who is that girl?

151
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:26,124
- Which girl?
- It's so confusing.

152
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,692
- Stop it!
- Who's this girl?

153
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:28,625
My mother.

154
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:32,397
This girl ran away from her wedding to marry
my son.

155
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:36,625
- That girl also ran away to marry your son.
- Why did she run away from her wedding?

156
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,501
Why did she ran away?

157
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:40,401
Wait! One minute!

158
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:47,410
- Which wedding hall did you say?
- R.S. Wedding Hall.

159
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,381
- Which wedding hall did you say?
- R.K. Wedding Hall.

160
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:58,123
- She's running away, stop her.
- Sorry!

161
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:01,419
- Catch her!
- Please forgive me.

162
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:06,529
- Who is this girl then?
- Don't know.

163
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:09,101
Why are you hesitating? As if you are..

164
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:12,628
- Going to unwrap a birthday gift? Just open.
- Siva, remove the cover.

165
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:32,621
With all this chaos, and
she's still unconscious!

166
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,453
Wake up!

167
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:58,044
Who are you guys? Where am I?

168
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,485
How come everyone says the same dialogue..

169
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,386
...once they regain consciousness?

170
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,588
I'm sorry.We mistakenly kidnapped you
instead of our friend's lover.

171
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:17,402
- Why are you thanking us?
- You did me a huge favour.

172
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:19,767
She's blabbering because she inhaled too
much of chloroform.

173
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:22,569
- No, it's not that.
- So are you always like this?

174
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:27,641
I was forced into the wedding. I was thinking
how to..

175
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,038
...escape, and you brought me here.

176
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:35,787
- I need a small favour from you.
- You think we have nothing else to do?

177
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,086
You want us to unite you with your lover.

178
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,685
Please drop me in Puthukotai on your way.

179
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,661
We are not running a travel agency.

180
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:46,290
We'll drop you at the junction on the way.

181
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:51,536
You can't leave this place if you don't take
me along.

182
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:53,266
Why is that?

183
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:56,598
Let me show you.

184
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:59,105
Let's see what she has to show.

185
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,046
- Are you taking us on a tour?
- Look there!

186
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,608
- It's a car race!
- Look there!

187
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:10,981
- Why are there so many cars?
- Look here!

188
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,248
Are they shooting a movie?

189
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,418
Not shooting! They are searching for me.

190
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:22,523
If they know you kidnapped me, they'll chop
you and...

191
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,627
- Feed us to the crows?
- They will eat it.

192
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,602
- You are the cause of it.
- No, it's your fault.

193
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,536
It's everyone's mistake.

194
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,569
It's our responsibility to drop her safely.
Let's go.

195
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:38,015
- Shall we?
- You're so responsible when it comes to women.

196
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,811
My horoscope said it'll
be a hectic day for me.

197
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:44,351
I wonder what else will happen. Get in.

198
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:47,453
- All because of him.
- Please be careful.

199
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:54,288
Are there any reasons for avoiding the
wedding?

200
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:58,103
Don't take advantage just because you
saved me.

201
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:01,198
Look at her face!

202
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:07,612
Reverse faster!

203
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:11,978
Be careful. The tires are new.

204
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:18,555
Drive fast, they are nearing us.

205
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,597
Come faster!

206
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,463
We are in grave danger
and you can still drink?

207
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:36,570
- I'm very thirsty since we ran all the way.
- This is petrol!

208
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:42,780
- She drank petrol, stop the car.
- Don't stop! Just continue driving.

209
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:46,581
They'll kill us if we stop!
I'd rather drink petrol.

210
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:51,379
- Drive fast!
- Yes! Drive faster!

211
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,051
No, slow it down. This is the only property
inherited from my grandpa.

212
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:59,490
Go slow, I'm not worried.They will never
harm me.

213
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:01,725
They will just kill all of you.

214
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,345
They hit our back. Something is flying.

215
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,048
- It's a piece of junk!
- I will smack you.

216
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,355
There used to be a door here?

217
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:35,733
My door is flying like a kite.
- Can you shut up?

218
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,528
Your grandpa's vehicle is a piece of junk!

219
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:41,338
Turn in here!
- Why? Are there any hotels here?

220
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:45,039
Turn anywhere but just drive fast!

221
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:04,150
Thank God! The vehicle has stopped.
Let's go!

222
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:08,260
Where are you going?
- Let's go!

223
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:12,196
And just abandon my vehicle?
- Then you can die with this vehicle.

224
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:15,304
It's a crocodile!

225
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,434
Run faster!

226
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,114
This way! Quick! Don't get caught.

227
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:31,721
They are here! This way!

228
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:36,224
Come fast.

229
00:20:56,515 --> 00:21:01,578
Poor thing.We just abandoned her.
- Thanks Siva!

230
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,381
At least you are concerned about my vehicle.

231
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:08,581
I'm not talking about that junk.
- Junk?

232
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:12,297
The gangsters would have killed us if not
for that 'junk'.

233
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:15,093
That's the only property left by my grandpa.

234
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:19,766
The problem now is not about your grandpa
or the vehicle. it's about the girl.

235
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:22,170
Why should you be worried about my grandpa?

236
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,368
The girl is more important to you.
- We just escaped.

237
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,478
Why still talk about the girl?

238
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:33,451
Pity her, she was against the wedding.
- So what?

239
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,631
You could have given it to me directly right?

240
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:58,710
Do we need tandoori chicken and mineral
water in this state?

241
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:01,406
Don't ask me, I am on a diet.

242
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:05,676
Did you eat it?
- She ate it.

243
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:13,357
She's back. Let's run away. Somehow, she
managed to find us.

244
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,799
Are you real men?
- You came back to ask us this?

245
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:32,466
A girl is in danger, but
you just left me there.

246
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:35,246
Are you all human?
- We think so!

247
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:38,045
Did you watch the movie 'Gilli'?
- I watched it ten times.

248
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,710
The hero will save the heroine from the
villains..

249
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:44,249
...even if there are so many of them.
He's a real man.

250
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:49,316
His father was a SAC.
- He also had a lot of fans.

251
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:53,130
Whom do we have?
- Except for him.

252
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:58,660
I had high regards for Indians, but you...
- Look!

253
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:02,402
You can say anything about us, but not India.

254
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,071
You want us to drop you in Puthukotai right?

255
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,341
She's trying to instigate you, please don't
promise anything.

256
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:14,652
Keep quiet! I can't bear if any one talks ill
of our country.

257
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:16,348
You are coming with us.

258
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:20,417
I'm Pooja.What's your name?
- Actually...

259
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,459
One minute! Follow me.

260
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,660
She looks like she is from a villain family.

261
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:31,496
Don't ruin it by over acting.

262
00:23:32,437 --> 00:23:37,101
That was something personal!
- We can buy a new car, but not our life.

263
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,301
What's your name?
- I'm Jackson

264
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,472
He's Thandabani and he's Pitchamuthu.

265
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,481
She's Gundumani
- Hi Gundumani.

266
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:48,047
She's Swarnaka. Everyone please remember
their names.

267
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:50,514
Why must they remember their names?

268
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,456
I meant, you should remember their names.

269
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,526
Thandabani, go and pay the bill.

270
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:02,461
Why is your name alone modern, and mine
Thandabani?

271
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:06,504
I don't like my name. Change it.
- It's just temporary.

272
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:10,107
Until we reach Puthukotai. Once we get
back home..

273
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:12,633
...you can change your name as you like.

274
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:18,382
What?
- Bill.

275
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,816
It's here! it's here! Stop! Please stop!

276
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:27,549
Look at who's asking for a lift!

277
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,659
Having a stylish name like 'Jackson' is
not enough.

278
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,130
Do you want me to dance?
- You need to use your brains.

279
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:35,065
Thandabani, move aside. Swarna come with me.

280
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,163
What are they going to do?
- I don't know.

281
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:43,500
Why is he in a monkey costume?
- Go away!

282
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:45,676
Let's go hide!
- Come!

283
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:59,123
Such beautiful girls by the roadside?

284
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,582
As if they are waiting for me. I'm coming.

285
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:06,995
Looks like I don't need to go to Goa.

286
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:13,404
Hi!
- Hi babes.

287
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:16,472
My name is Kanth. Santosh Kanth.

288
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,633
What can I do for you?

289
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:24,077
Can you give us a ride?
- I'll even give you my life.

290
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:28,477
Who'll give us a ride if you were dead?

291
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,658
Is she whistling in happiness?

292
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:47,062
Nice jeep!
- Who are you? What are you doing?

293
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:50,103
They are all our friends.
- Our friends?

294
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,467
I thought they were thieves.

295
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:57,447
Where shall I drop you? -Just drop me at Puthukotai.
- Uncle, please drop me in Chennai.

296
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:04,152
No Uncle. I'm just 26 years old.
- How many years ago was that?

297
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:08,786
My name is Kanth. My other name is
Santosh Kanth.

298
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:12,621
But everyone calls me Babykanth. Why are
you dressed as a bride?

299
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:16,467
She ran away because they tried to get her..

300
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:18,102
...married to an old man like you.

301
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:20,637
Who is this 'Kutty' (kid)?
- He is not Kutty, he is Polladhavan.

302
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:22,363
He was a Pollaadhavan yesterday (villain)..

303
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,108
...tomorrow, he'll be a Mapillai (Groom).

304
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:27,010
It's nothing Santosh. He's just a waste.

305
00:26:28,513 --> 00:26:32,040
Do you know something? Even his name is
'Thandabani'.

306
00:26:34,653 --> 00:26:38,419
This is how we should enjoy our lives.
- The gear is below.

307
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:41,090
Friends.
- What?

308
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,661
Just keep it.
- On your head?

309
00:26:42,662 --> 00:26:44,424
I'm moving.
- Throw it away.

310
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:50,091
Where are you going?
- To enjoy my weekend.

311
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:54,238
What do you do on weekdays?
- I will wait for the weekend.

312
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,503
He's very busy right?
- Yes!

313
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:07,312
Why is he stopping? Maybe he needs a drink.

314
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:12,516
You guys must be very tired. Let's take a
short break.

315
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,224
Speaking English alone is not enough..

316
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,767
...we must make sure the people around us
understand as well.

317
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:31,108
Show us some women clothing.
- That's what I wanted to say..

318
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,609
...but you'll never let me speak.
- I'm the one going to pay.

319
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,049
Why looking at us? Give her what she wants.

320
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:45,420
These are all women clothes. You choose
what you like.

321
00:27:58,737 --> 00:28:01,035
Which one looks nice?

322
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,407
I don't want this.

323
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:08,576
Where's the trial room?
- Trial room?

324
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,080
Do you think we are in a mall? Just go
inside and change.

325
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:12,982
His shop is as big as a trial room.

326
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,562
Who's jeep is this?
- That's my jeep.

327
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,192
Have you seen her before?

328
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:33,332
Yes, I gave her a lift.
- You?

329
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:35,634
Yes! She was waiting by the roadside and
I picked her.

330
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,646
I will listen to lllayaraja's
songs when I'm in a happy mood..

331
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:47,848
Where are the others who followed her?

332
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:50,016
Why are you asking?
- Please turn around.

333
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:52,351
One minute. Is this position okay?

334
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,255
This is not your size.
- I know!

335
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:57,791
She has turned me into a cleaner.

336
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:01,595
You brought her right? Tell me where she is.

337
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,431
They are here. Let's go!

338
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,429
They followed us here! it's very narrow.

339
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:13,040
They are at that shop.
- Bring him along.

340
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,575
Where are you taking me?

341
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,649
I can't bear his torture. -Did she come here?
- Where did she go?

342
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:21,415
I don't know.

343
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,325
They must not leave this place. Go look
for them.

344
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:41,462
What shall we do now?
- Let's remain here for a while.

345
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:46,004
What?
- Stand here and think of our next plan.

346
00:29:49,314 --> 00:29:53,341
What brand is you perfume?
- Don't take advantage.

347
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,553
How to take advantage when it's difficult to
even breathe.

348
00:29:57,522 --> 00:30:01,481
Siva, I have a small doubt?
- Yes!

349
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:05,128
Is this what you call as taking advantage of
the situation?

350
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:07,188
You idiot! Shut your mouth.

351
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,108
They are only after Pooja.

352
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:28,979
We'll get caught if we are together.

353
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:31,688
You should all go back. I'll send Pooja..

354
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,715
No...
- No time to talk now, understand?

355
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:36,651
Please be careful!
- Okay!

356
00:30:40,832 --> 00:30:43,494
Let's go! Come faster!
- I'm coming.

357
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,697
What?
- I can't go any further.

358
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:02,062
Can we stay somewhere nearby?

359
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,607
Do you want some?
- No thanks!

360
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:18,150
I heard you fell for someone recently.

361
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:22,250
Gundumani told me.

362
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:25,153
Just leave two girls together for a while..

363
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:28,392
...and you'll gossip about everyone.
- Let it go.

364
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:32,700
Who's that girl? Where did you meet her?

365
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:37,106
Did you meet her again?
- Yes!

366
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,403
You met her again? Where?

367
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:43,273
I meant, I will meet her again.

368
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:49,852
When you do meet her, how can you be sure..

369
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:53,285
...that she'll love you?
- Why are you so negative?

370
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,793
There's no guarantee and warranty in love.

371
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:06,727
You can't tackle girls with this kind of
dialogues.

372
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:10,135
Your love is as old fashioned as your name.

373
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:18,738
Leave it be! How does she look like?

374
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:23,146
What did you feel the first time you met her?

375
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:06,053
Tell me about your family.

376
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:12,121
Father, his brother, brother's wife, so many
of us in one house.

377
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:15,098
Now and then, I'll do something silly and
they'll chase me out.

378
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:16,466
But I'll go back home immediately.

379
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:20,732
This time I went too far and they chased
me out.

380
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:24,236
It's been some time now. I miss them.

381
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,210
You never sit still. You are always up to
something.

382
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:35,443
Somehow, I feel they are the ones who'll
miss you more.

383
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,594
Please let this turn into love!

384
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,750
What are you doing?
- Helping you.

385
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,556
Don't take advantage.

386
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:13,439
Out of nowhere you came and kidnapped me.

387
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:15,785
So many people chased us.

388
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:18,118
Won't you even ask me why?
- What for?

389
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,987
You will say I'm taking advantage again.

390
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:27,020
My dad was a businessman in the US.

391
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:32,659
My parents died in an accident recently.

392
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:37,838
I have two uncles staying in Uthukooli.

393
00:38:38,008 --> 00:38:40,477
They loved us so much.

394
00:38:40,478 --> 00:38:44,278
They always celebrate our
visits like a festival.

395
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:51,416
I inherited my parents
fortune after their death.

396
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,816
Both my uncles became greedy and..

397
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:58,087
...tried to force me to marry their son.

398
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,995
Are they capable of doing this just for money?

399
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:06,194
My eldest uncle already arranged the wedding.

400
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,999
That is where you kidnapped me from.

401
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:38,451
Ok Siva. I have to go. Thanks.

402
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:44,091
I'll walk you till the house.
- It's ok.

403
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:46,728
I appreciate you following me this far.

404
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:53,837
Her parents will be home and they might
ask about you.That's why..

405
00:40:56,947 --> 00:41:00,075
Okay, take care. I'll call you.

406
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:46,129
Who are you looking for?
- I'm Karthiga's friend.

407
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,364
They went to Thirupathi for a wedding..

408
00:41:48,365 --> 00:41:49,855
...they will only be back in 5 days.

409
00:42:01,178 --> 00:42:05,342
It's not fair to have a
party for every occasion.

410
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,746
It's a pretty girl.

411
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,118
Let's go!

412
00:43:00,437 --> 00:43:02,769
They have left. Don't take advantage.

413
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:06,068
It's not like that.

414
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,073
Why haven't you left yet?

415
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:13,346
Why are you waiting here?

416
00:43:13,984 --> 00:43:15,451
I'm having tea.

417
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:19,355
What happened in your friend's house?

418
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:25,556
They went outstation and will be back in

419
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:29,096
Sir, tea!
- I can't go back home either.

420
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:34,061
I don't know what to do?

421
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:41,504
If you don't mind, I have a suggestion.

422
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:45,579
Janaki?

423
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:56,052
How do you know my name?
- I know everything about you.

424
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:07,132
What's your name?
- I'm Pooja.

425
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:17,080
Have you seen it?
- Yes, it's ok.

426
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,742
I'm okay if you are.

427
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:22,149
Vanakkam, Uncle Raghu.

428
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:30,619
Only Swamiji calls me Rhagu?
- He sent me.

429
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:34,688
Swamiji sent you?
- Yes.

430
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:38,063
Really? Have a seat.
- It's okay.

431
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,693
It's okay, have a seat.

432
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:46,271
Vanakkam, Aunty Lakshmi! Vanakkam,
Aunty Sundari!

433
00:44:53,117 --> 00:45:00,117
Manju, didn't you go to school today?

434
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:07,061
I forgot to tell you why I am here.
- Because of me?

435
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:13,058
My parents died in an accident.
- Were they hit by a lorry?

436
00:45:13,437 --> 00:45:17,533
I grew up in Swamiji's ashram since then.

437
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,435
I got a place to study medicine here.

438
00:45:20,811 --> 00:45:23,644
My college will open in 10 days time.

439
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:28,146
Before that, I need to buy books and look
for a hostel.

440
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,219
You can do it from here,
this is your house too.

441
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:36,092
I can also help you.
- Swamiji is like a God for us.

442
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:39,529
You can stay here as long as you want.

443
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,497
Suja?

444
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:44,423
Sir?
- Keep this luggage in the room.

445
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:48,471
Which room?
- Bathroom! Silly question!

446
00:45:48,472 --> 00:45:52,642
Keep it in my room.
- No, keep it in Siva's room.

447
00:45:52,643 --> 00:45:55,578
Okay sir.
- Who is Siva?

448
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,376
Uncle chased him out because of his bad
behaviour.

449
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:04,516
Keep quiet! You go and freshen yourself.

450
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,198
Knock out!
- It did not touch!

451
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,360
Knock out!

452
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,403
Why does uncle get excited whenever he
looks at this shield?

453
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,298
He likes acting. He received a state award..

454
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:02,678
...In acting while in college. Not only that..

455
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:05,481
...he received it from his
favourite actor, MGR.

456
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:07,541
He is very proud of it.

457
00:47:17,361 --> 00:47:18,794
It's him?

458
00:47:19,096 --> 00:47:21,223
Ask him why he is here?

459
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:26,060
Didn't you hear? Why are you here?

460
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,135
I went to the neighbour's house..

461
00:47:28,505 --> 00:47:31,030
...but they told me I live next door...

462
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:33,338
.and sent me here. That's why I came here.

463
00:47:34,011 --> 00:47:38,414
She is happily married, but
you are still angry with me.

464
00:47:38,515 --> 00:47:41,006
See how arrogant he is?

465
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:47,523
She's still a child. How could she have known?

466
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:49,856
Unknowingly? She planned everything well.

467
00:47:50,027 --> 00:47:53,062
She said she'll commit suicide if she doesn't
marry Ashok..

468
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:56,191
...I didn't know what else
to do, so I helped her.

469
00:47:57,234 --> 00:47:58,995
You are happily talking to her on the phone.

470
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,199
He came here with all the information.

471
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:05,133
You were so angry you stopped sending me
money.

472
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:08,003
I couldn't eat because I had no money.

473
00:48:08,078 --> 00:48:10,706
I lost a lot of weight.
- When were you ever fat?

474
00:48:13,951 --> 00:48:17,978
I couldn't even buy a drink.
- He has even started to drink.

475
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:20,750
I meant mineral water, not the liquor that
you drink.

476
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:24,189
David was helping me all this while.

477
00:48:24,294 --> 00:48:26,421
It's not David who helped you.

478
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:31,066
Your uncle has been sending money to David
to give you.

479
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:35,337
David, you cheated me!

480
00:48:35,439 --> 00:48:39,034
Let it be. Can I come inside now?

481
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:42,378
If not, I'll go and sleep on some platform.

482
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:44,074
Go! That's the right place for you.

483
00:48:46,249 --> 00:48:51,152
Pooja? Come here.
- What is it uncle?

484
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:53,253
This is Siva.

485
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:58,258
Can we forgive and accept him?

486
00:48:59,262 --> 00:49:06,262
How can I interfere in your family affairs?

487
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:12,038
No, you were raised under Swamiji's care..

488
00:49:12,142 --> 00:49:14,838
...so whatever you say, is
similar to his advice.

489
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:17,436
That's why I am asking you. Tell me.

490
00:49:18,815 --> 00:49:22,751
We must not forgive him.

491
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:28,491
He made a huge mistake, but in
Bhagavad Gita..

492
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:32,622
...It's written that we
should forgive and forget.

493
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:38,400
I don't think he can survive alone outside.
- You are right!

494
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:43,733
So, it's better to forgive him.

495
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:50,579
You are smart even though you're so young.

496
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:54,744
I'll forgive him just because you said so.

497
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:59,553
Ask him to go inside.
- Uncle! Thank you.

498
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:05,227
Uncle! Thank you. Thank you dad!

499
00:50:05,228 --> 00:50:07,492
What are you doing?
- Dad is here.

500
00:50:07,697 --> 00:50:09,824
Sorry! Thank you dad!

501
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:15,030
Who's that girl?
- Swamiji sent her here.

502
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:17,138
Where were you all this while?
- In hostel.

503
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,740
You have lost weight.
- I was on a diet.

504
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:19,574
Come and eat first.

505
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:24,814
There were something missing in this house..

506
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:27,511
...but, after he came back, it's complete now.

507
00:50:27,918 --> 00:50:32,048
Although Kalpana made the mistake, he took
the blame.

508
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:37,192
He is willing to sacrifice his
life if one is in need of help.

509
00:50:42,966 --> 00:50:46,129
You acted well, continue acting.

510
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:48,803
But just be careful, my family are not easily
fooled.

511
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:52,140
Of course, they are not like you.
- What?

512
00:50:52,742 --> 00:50:57,111
I said everyone is always alert like you.

513
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:01,075
Do you get hiccups?
- Hiccups?

514
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,323
I do, but I don't know when.
- Let it be!

515
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:10,020
Pretend to have hiccups if you want to talk
to me.

516
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:12,090
That's our secret code.

517
00:51:13,463 --> 00:51:17,627
Where do you get all these ideas?

518
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:22,065
I don't like to be praised.
- Praise?

519
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,505
I asked where do you get such ridiculous
ideas from?

520
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,372
Ridiculous? But my friends think it is a
good idea.

521
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:31,912
Everyone knows about the code?
- Yes.

522
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:34,781
How is it a secret then? Thandabani..

523
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:40,653
My name is not Thandabani!
- I feel it suits you better.

524
00:51:40,924 --> 00:51:43,791
It's not easy to think of an idea.

525
00:51:43,894 --> 00:51:45,657
I spent the whole night thinking about it.

526
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,725
One idea can change your whole life.

527
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:52,802
Don't forget about the hiccups.

528
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:04,039
What?
- Just testing.

529
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:05,538
Okay!

530
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,231
He was found on the highway.

531
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:39,405
He is in a coma. He suffered severe head
injuries.

532
00:52:41,851 --> 00:52:44,183
Before Velu opens his eyes..

533
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:48,215
...make sure the person responsible for this
is dead.

534
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:51,119
Eat properly Siva!

535
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:55,856
Bring it quickly.
- I'm not a child anymore.

536
00:52:57,734 --> 00:53:00,328
Why so much? Are you going to eat as well?
- Serve him well.

537
00:53:02,105 --> 00:53:03,333
Aunty.
- Yes!

538
00:53:03,406 --> 00:53:05,340
The priest is here.
- Is it?

539
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:08,273
Mix coffee for the priest.

540
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:23,582
Why did you lie?
- I did not.

541
00:53:25,028 --> 00:53:26,496
Your hiccups have stopped.

542
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:29,056
This is what we call shock treatment.

543
00:53:38,675 --> 00:53:43,237
The priest from the ashram is here. What are
we to do now?

544
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:54,290
How are you?
- Come Siva!

545
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:59,119
I'm fine. How are you?
- I've been better since Pooja arrived.

546
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:03,593
Who is Pooja?
- It's the one from the ashram..

547
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,798
Oh, the puppy.

548
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:10,430
Don't mention that word. Uncle might hear it.
- Why?

549
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:14,074
He likes it a lot?
- It?

550
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:16,338
The one...
- You mean the puppy?

551
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,408
I just said not to mention that word!

552
00:54:21,084 --> 00:54:25,544
Why name it Pooja? it's not suitable.
- It is.

553
00:54:25,822 --> 00:54:29,690
Make sure you don't mention 'puppy' in front
of uncle.

554
00:54:29,793 --> 00:54:31,385
Do you understand?
- Yes!

555
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:33,820
Remember..
- I'll handle it.

556
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:37,866
Welcome Swami. How are you?
- I'm fine.

557
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:40,597
How's Swamiji?
- He's fine.

558
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,069
Vanakkam Swami.
- Vanakkam.

559
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:45,633
This is from Swamiji.
- Thank you, please sit.

560
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,069
Vanakkam Swami! Coffee for you.

561
00:54:49,646 --> 00:54:52,080
Where is Pooja?
- I'll call her.

562
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,877
Did Swamiji ask about Pooja?

563
00:54:56,152 --> 00:54:59,121
He's has no worry since it's in your care.

564
00:54:59,556 --> 00:55:01,615
He knows how well you will take care of it.

565
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:08,187
She's one of our family now. Such a good girl.

566
00:55:08,465 --> 00:55:11,059
Girl? But it's a male...?

567
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:19,342
It's eating well I guess. it looks chubby.

568
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:25,077
She looks the same to us.

569
00:55:25,248 --> 00:55:29,118
She's not eating well. I think she's shy.

570
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,078
Shy? I'm confused. Does it bite?

571
00:55:35,425 --> 00:55:36,687
Bite?

572
00:55:38,061 --> 00:55:40,086
She's not a small girl to bite.

573
00:55:40,663 --> 00:55:42,028
She is at an age to be married.

574
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,800
Age to get married? What happened to him?

575
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:48,066
Does Swamiji have any proposal for Pooja?

576
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:50,305
The entire family is crazy.

577
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,032
Swamiji has not thought of it for now.

578
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:58,713
We must do something good for Pooja in the
month of Prothasi.

579
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:01,978
You must not let Pooja out in that month.

580
00:56:04,554 --> 00:56:08,090
If Swamiji is agreeable, we want to get her
married.

581
00:56:08,091 --> 00:56:10,719
It'll get angry if you tie it. Let it free.

582
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:16,156
Let it be free.

583
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:22,670
In this day and age, too much freedom can lead
to unwanted things..

584
00:56:23,373 --> 00:56:28,333
What will happen? So, tie it somewhere in
your house.

585
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:37,079
We must consult Swamiji before deciding.
- She's an orphan.

586
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:44,083
Orphan? I'll become crazy if I stay longer,
I better leave.

587
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:47,354
I am making a move.
- Okay!

588
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:54,761
Who's this girl?
- Who?

589
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,680
That's Suja, our maid.
- She's so pretty.

590
01:01:09,892 --> 01:01:12,656
Where is everyone?
- They went to Swamiji's ashram.

591
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:15,163
Went to Swamiji's ashram...?

592
01:01:16,899 --> 01:01:17,997
What's the girl's name...?

593
01:01:18,668 --> 01:01:21,796
Pooja! Where is she?
- They took her along.

594
01:01:31,848 --> 01:01:37,582
Don't get me wrong but you do love Siva
right?

595
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:41,822
Don't be shy, just tell us.

596
01:01:43,626 --> 01:01:46,094
Women won't express their feelings easily.

597
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:49,121
Can't you see it from her smile?

598
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:55,069
That's why we are going to an important
place..

599
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:58,273
...to talk about their marriage.

600
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:03,005
You'll be surprised if you knew where.
- Where?

601
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,141
To Shastri's ashram.

602
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,789
Pooja, bathing in this river..

603
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:17,487
...will make our wishes come true right?
- Yes!

604
01:02:18,127 --> 01:02:24,259
All of you go and bathe while I talk to Swamiji.
- Okay.

605
01:02:24,734 --> 01:02:27,168
Take care of them.
- Okay, let's go.

606
01:02:41,117 --> 01:02:43,176
Vanakkam Swamiji!

607
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:49,186
Raghu, take your seat.

608
01:02:52,495 --> 01:02:54,087
Is everyone fine at home?

609
01:02:54,163 --> 01:02:57,132
We will always be in good health for as long
as you are here.

610
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,636
I'm here to discuss an important matter
with you.

611
01:03:01,637 --> 01:03:03,832
Really? Tell me.

612
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:10,139
The girl that I sent? I never sent anyone.

613
01:03:14,283 --> 01:03:18,014
Raghu, something is wrong somewhere.

614
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,654
It's not that deep right?

615
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:37,296
Who brought you here? Tell me.

616
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:43,773
You just need me, right? Let's go!

617
01:03:55,892 --> 01:03:57,860
Someone is taking our Pooja.

618
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:13,771
Get in!

619
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,251
Who are they?

620
01:05:17,807 --> 01:05:19,138
Close the door!

621
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:30,579
If she escapes again, you will die. Let's go!

622
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:35,421
What is this?

623
01:05:47,803 --> 01:05:49,168
Useless fools!

624
01:05:49,638 --> 01:05:51,606
So many of you went searching..

625
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:54,876
...but how did he alone manage to find her?

626
01:05:54,877 --> 01:05:58,313
You let her go her and came back here...

627
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:02,180
We searched for her the whole night, but
couldn't find her.

628
01:06:07,556 --> 01:06:14,325
Why couldn't you find her? I want her! Else..

629
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:18,599
Let him go! We need Pooja.

630
01:06:22,204 --> 01:06:25,240
I told you she had a dangerous background.

631
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:29,268
No one listened to me.
- Jackson, why talk about the past?

632
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:32,280
I will break your teeth if you call me Jackson.
- Get lost!

633
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:36,518
Seenu, did you find out anything about that
girl?

634
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:38,454
Her family is the richest in Uthukooli.

635
01:06:38,455 --> 01:06:40,547
They are typical villagers.

636
01:06:41,223 --> 01:06:44,624
Both families have the same auditor and they
trust him.

637
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:47,295
He passed Plus Two, studied for accounts and..

638
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:49,161
...Is claiming to be an auditor.

639
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:55,165
He's the only stranger that has access to
both families.

640
01:06:55,538 --> 01:06:57,699
What's his name?
- Emotional Ekambaram!

641
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:01,776
Auditor Emotional Ekambaram speaking?
- I'm Lallu!

642
01:07:01,777 --> 01:07:05,480
Who's Lallu?
- I'm Lalitha, your wife.

643
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:09,617
What's the matter?
- You were carrying a huge sum...

644
01:07:09,618 --> 01:07:11,813
...so I called to check if you reached the
bank safely.

645
01:07:11,854 --> 01:07:18,654
It's just Rs 25 lakhs. I have dealt with a few
millions before.

646
01:07:20,763 --> 01:07:24,766
You crazy girl! Don't call and disturb when
I'm at the bank.

647
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:27,302
Disconnect the line.
- Why should I?

648
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:31,873
Don't! Continue talking. Is it your money?

649
01:07:31,874 --> 01:07:33,075
Are you paying the bills?

650
01:07:33,076 --> 01:07:35,407
An innocent man is paying for you.

651
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:42,742
He's writing as though it's an exam. it's
getting late.

652
01:07:43,385 --> 01:07:44,520
Excuse me.
- Yes?

653
01:07:44,521 --> 01:07:46,654
Is your bike parked outside?
- Yes?

654
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:48,486
A guy is trying to steal the front wheel.

655
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:53,017
Can you pass me the form?

656
01:07:55,798 --> 01:07:57,095
Can you pass me the pen?

657
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,825
That's my form.
- Get a new form.

658
01:08:00,002 --> 01:08:01,435
That's my pen.
- Buy a new one.

659
01:08:01,604 --> 01:08:03,699
What's all this?
- How much are you going to deposit?

660
01:08:03,772 --> 01:08:06,364
Rs 101!
- Are you giving tips to the bank?

661
01:08:06,442 --> 01:08:09,502
I'm going to deposit Rs 25 lakhs! Keep quiet.

662
01:08:10,779 --> 01:08:13,373
You can use this pen to fill up.
- Thanks sir!

663
01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:19,821
There's an ink stain on your shirt.
- Ink on my shirt?

664
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:22,323
He's just angry I took his form.

665
01:08:26,896 --> 01:08:29,397
My suitcase is missing!
- Buy a new one.

666
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:32,500
Buy a new suitcase? What am I to do now?

667
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:35,595
It's my boss's money, not mine. They will
kill me!

668
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:39,207
Did you see it? Someone stole it.

669
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:42,041
They closed the counter. Is it inside this?

670
01:08:43,612 --> 01:08:48,345
I'm helpless now! Where is my Rs 25 lakhs?

671
01:08:51,854 --> 01:08:57,087
Triple one? My Rs 25 lakhs is gone..

672
01:09:01,864 --> 01:09:06,768
What happened?
- I lost Gounder's Rs 25 lakhs.

673
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:09,499
They'll kill me if they find out.

674
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,604
It is them! They are here!

675
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:18,880
I'll hide inside. You tell
them that I divorced you.

676
01:09:18,881 --> 01:09:21,213
Come here, not there!
- It's a window!

677
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,318
Did you change the room location?

678
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:30,323
Vanakkam!

679
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:34,354
Is your husband at home?

680
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,064
I have a husband but he's not at home.

681
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:40,524
I think this suitcase belongs to him.

682
01:09:41,804 --> 01:09:43,795
I don't know. He's not at home.

683
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,568
This house address is written on it.
- I don't know.

684
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:50,211
He's not at home.
- I'm here.

685
01:09:50,212 --> 01:09:52,772
You told me not to tell.
- I'm here now.

686
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:56,483
5..10..15..20..25!

687
01:09:59,121 --> 01:10:02,657
Is everything intact?
- Yes! Thank you so much.

688
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:04,926
How did you get this suitcase?

689
01:10:04,927 --> 01:10:08,988
I was having tea when I saw a man run out
from the bank..

690
01:10:09,131 --> 01:10:10,933
...with the suitcase. He looked suspicious.

691
01:10:10,934 --> 01:10:13,458
When I questioned him, he dropped the
suitcase in fear.

692
01:10:13,736 --> 01:10:15,403
Your address was written on it.

693
01:10:15,404 --> 01:10:17,838
So I brought it back.
- Thanks a lot.

694
01:10:18,073 --> 01:10:21,236
He stole the suitcase, but you stole my heart.

695
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:27,514
What's your name?
- Sivaramakrishnan, everyone calls me Siva.

696
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:32,153
Let them call. He returned back Rs 25 lakhs.

697
01:10:32,154 --> 01:10:35,521
Must reward him for his honesty.

698
01:10:39,228 --> 01:10:40,695
Take this! Wait!

699
01:10:42,231 --> 01:10:43,391
Keep this for your expenses.

700
01:10:46,568 --> 01:10:50,371
I don't need so much of money.
- It's okay.

701
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:53,500
Spend half, and keep the rest in the bank.
- No, it's okay.

702
01:10:53,776 --> 01:10:55,505
You don't want it?
- No.

703
01:10:56,078 --> 01:11:01,072
What else do you want?
- Can I get something to eat?

704
01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:07,080
He looks as if he has never eaten for so long.

705
01:11:07,589 --> 01:11:11,582
You kept yesterday's balance food right?
- Yes.

706
01:11:11,694 --> 01:11:13,389
Give that to him.
- Okay.

707
01:11:13,862 --> 01:11:16,592
So, you don't need it?
- No.

708
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:17,688
Give it back to me then.

709
01:11:18,867 --> 01:11:22,103
It's okay, give me. You go and eat.
- Come.

710
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:24,095
Let me count once more.

711
01:11:29,345 --> 01:11:32,974
What's all this? I don't like this.

712
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:35,850
Why are you standing? Sit on top and eat.

713
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:40,049
Not so high. Sit on the chair.

714
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:41,411
Help him.

715
01:11:43,959 --> 01:11:47,224
Eat slowly, or you might choke.
- I'm very hungry.

716
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,327
Where are you from?
- Thiruchi.

717
01:11:50,966 --> 01:11:54,424
What have you studied?
- Justice, honesty...

718
01:11:54,837 --> 01:11:58,539
integrity and generosity in arrears? We know
that too.

719
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,008
What have you studied for?
- CA!

720
01:12:02,244 --> 01:12:06,010
Why are you loafing around when you have
studied for CA?

721
01:12:06,882 --> 01:12:11,342
There's an auditor named Emotional Ekambaram
here.

722
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:18,692
He's a genius. He's an
inspiration for us youths.

723
01:12:20,062 --> 01:12:24,089
I came here to join as his assistant.

724
01:12:28,604 --> 01:12:30,868
You are very lucky.
- Why?

725
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:35,501
Because, I'm the genius you have been
looking for.

726
01:12:35,644 --> 01:12:36,744
Sir!
- What?

727
01:12:36,745 --> 01:12:39,147
What are you saying? Are you the one?

728
01:12:39,148 --> 01:12:42,117
Shall I give you another shocking news?

729
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:46,276
You can work with me starting tomorrow.

730
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:51,215
Aren't you shocked?
- Sir!

731
01:12:52,895 --> 01:12:54,624
Is this how you get shocked?

732
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:59,096
I think I did something good in my previous
birth.

733
01:13:00,102 --> 01:13:03,071
He's getting over excited. Please sit down.

734
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:10,077
This job has no stress at all.

735
01:13:10,446 --> 01:13:11,811
We have only two clients.

736
01:13:12,047 --> 01:13:15,116
Periamuthu and Chinnamuthu Gounder.

737
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:17,881
One is dumb, the other is violent.

738
01:13:17,986 --> 01:13:21,055
But they both are first class.
- First class?

739
01:13:21,056 --> 01:13:23,684
Yes, they only studied up to Standard One,
but failed.

740
01:13:23,926 --> 01:13:27,760
I'll help you build a bright future starting
tomorrow.

741
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,361
All the best for now. Cheers!

742
01:13:40,242 --> 01:13:43,006
Let me go! it's painful.

743
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:50,111
Hit him all over. He must know who I am.

744
01:13:50,285 --> 01:13:52,810
Hit him!
- Hit him!

745
01:13:56,492 --> 01:13:59,694
Please forgive me! it was a mistake.

746
01:13:59,695 --> 01:14:03,131
I'll never give a zero anymore. I have a
family, please let me go.

747
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:07,227
Didn't you think of them when you gave me
zero marks?

748
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:09,996
Break the hand that gave me that marks.

749
01:14:10,172 --> 01:14:13,005
What can I do if you wrote wrongly?

750
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:16,511
I wrote wrongly? Who is our president?

751
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:21,382
Pradhiba Pattali.
- Last exam, you told me it's Abdul Kaalam.

752
01:14:21,383 --> 01:14:24,614
He was the previous president. Now that has
changed.

753
01:14:25,387 --> 01:14:29,653
Is that my fault? Step on his chest!

754
01:14:30,225 --> 01:14:31,221
Let me go! It's painful.

755
01:14:33,128 --> 01:14:35,460
Hit him harder.

756
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:40,760
Why are they hitting him? What did he do?

757
01:14:40,903 --> 01:14:42,063
Grandpa!
- Yes.

758
01:14:42,137 --> 01:14:46,767
He humiliated our family by giving me zero
marks.

759
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:54,042
Break his teeth.
- Do whatever he says.

760
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:56,709
Hey fatty!

761
01:14:57,819 --> 01:15:02,051
You are grown up, but you're hitting your
teacher. You useless!

762
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:05,693
Mother! You know that women are not..

763
01:15:05,694 --> 01:15:08,262
...supposed to talk against men right?
Go inside!

764
01:15:08,263 --> 01:15:11,232
Silly! You are grown up.
Don't you have brains?

765
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:15,327
If you don't give respect, I'll kill you with
poison.

766
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:19,604
Silly Gounder!
- She is capable of doing it.

767
01:15:19,775 --> 01:15:24,679
Let him go! Runaway from here.

768
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,080
I'll go away from this place.

769
01:15:27,616 --> 01:15:31,052
Hey useless! it's time for school.
Go and get ready.

770
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,656
Lingam, Is your wife scolding your son or..

771
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:40,390
...Indirectly scolding me?
- How can you say that?

772
01:15:40,529 --> 01:15:46,764
You are like a God to me. I was scolding
my son.

773
01:15:47,235 --> 01:15:51,672
Uncle, do you want coffee?
- Bring it faster!

774
01:15:53,075 --> 01:15:56,677
Should I use buffalo's milk or cow's milk?

775
01:15:56,678 --> 01:16:00,136
I don't want coffee.
- Okay uncle!

776
01:16:07,422 --> 01:16:09,151
What's all this?
- There's a message.

777
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:12,156
You own a cell phone?
- I bought it in installments.

778
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,620
I'll throw it if you don't like.

779
01:16:13,662 --> 01:16:16,028
Even beggars have cell phones, why
shouldn't you.

780
01:16:16,365 --> 01:16:20,067
But don't use it here. Understand?

781
01:16:20,068 --> 01:16:21,603
Why are you keeping it in your pocket?

782
01:16:21,604 --> 01:16:24,802
Keep it here and lock it. Do as I say.
- Okay sir!

783
01:16:25,774 --> 01:16:28,109
Careful, don't scratch. it's a new bike.

784
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,010
I can hear someone spitting.

785
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:34,747
Vanakkam sir!

786
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:39,881
I have not seen you for the past two days?
- I went to the bank.

787
01:16:40,022 --> 01:16:42,081
Have you deposited the cash?
- Yes. -What's this?

788
01:16:45,794 --> 01:16:47,628
Is it Boondhi?
- No, it's Laddu.

789
01:16:47,629 --> 01:16:49,062
It looks small in front of you.

790
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:52,698
Why is it so small?
- Since you have diabetes..

791
01:16:52,801 --> 01:16:56,794
...I ordered this specially for you.
- Is it? Give that too!

792
01:16:58,206 --> 01:17:02,040
Eat! Eat!
- It's very tasty and not so sweet.

793
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:05,770
Who is he?
- My assistant.

794
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:10,648
I hired him to help me with my work.
- Vanakkam sir!

795
01:17:10,752 --> 01:17:15,416
I told you many times not to hire strangers
in our business.

796
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:19,048
Don't you have any sense?
- He's not a stranger.

797
01:17:19,861 --> 01:17:23,397
He's my nephew. it's true.

798
01:17:23,398 --> 01:17:28,602
Compare both our faces? I looked like him
at that age.

799
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:30,264
Will I look like you when I'm old?

800
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:33,568
Did you hire him because he's your nephew..

801
01:17:33,575 --> 01:17:37,111
...or because he is talented?
- How could say that?

802
01:17:37,112 --> 01:17:40,114
There's a businessman in the US by the name
of Washington Vetrivel.

803
01:17:40,115 --> 01:17:45,018
His fortune is worth 500 million. He's the
auditor for him.

804
01:17:45,987 --> 01:17:47,147
Is that so?

805
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:53,689
Yes sir!
- I brought him to help me.

806
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:58,494
I can send him back if you don't like.
- Are you angry?

807
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,296
You can hire anyone you like.

808
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:04,706
My grandson is here. Come!

809
01:18:07,676 --> 01:18:10,509
How are you?
- I'm fine!

810
01:18:10,779 --> 01:18:13,009
Who's he?
- My nephew.

811
01:18:13,381 --> 01:18:14,914
Doesn't he know how to show respect?

812
01:18:14,983 --> 01:18:19,086
Doesn't he know he should greet his elder's?
- You'll die!

813
01:18:19,087 --> 01:18:19,985
What did you say?

814
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:23,357
If we greet younger people, they'll die at a
young age.

815
01:18:23,358 --> 01:18:25,223
I can greet if you want?
- No need!

816
01:18:27,896 --> 01:18:32,333
Not today, please.
- It's getting late for me, bend over.

817
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,766
My nephew is here!
- I said bend over now.

818
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:40,331
So, you can't do it tomorrow.
- We'll think of that later.

819
01:18:46,782 --> 01:18:50,149
How was it?
- It was very nice.

820
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:55,253
My brain is traveling through my knees.

821
01:18:59,494 --> 01:19:01,428
Go! Go!
- Okay!

822
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:04,292
Did you see it?

823
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:09,231
He's so happy each time he hits you.

824
01:19:09,404 --> 01:19:12,339
It is priceless!
- Yes.

825
01:19:12,474 --> 01:19:14,738
Hey, small gounder! Useless boy!

826
01:19:16,578 --> 01:19:20,378
You forgot your food. Can't even lift it up.

827
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,248
Your meal alone is equal to 10 people's meal.

828
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:26,786
I wonder where you inherited it from?

829
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:30,991
You should commit suicide instead of
torturing others.

830
01:19:32,027 --> 01:19:34,393
You better leave now!
- Grandpa?

831
01:19:34,663 --> 01:19:40,226
My friends in school are teasing me.

832
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:43,333
They would because you are so fat.

833
01:19:45,207 --> 01:19:49,577
I think they tease me because of my pony tail.

834
01:19:49,578 --> 01:19:53,412
If you allow, may I...

835
01:19:55,483 --> 01:19:59,420
it's not just a pony tail. it's
been our identity for generations.

836
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:03,290
We must never cut it even when we are dead.
- Is it?

837
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:08,629
You can chop those who tease you, but not
the pony tail.

838
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:13,761
That's my order.
- Careful dad.

839
01:20:15,704 --> 01:20:22,371
Yes grandpa! Bless me. I'm leaving now.

840
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,438
How do you do it?
- What?

841
01:20:26,815 --> 01:20:28,849
You tackled everything so well.

842
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:33,583
How else am I a boss if can't even handle this?
- Correct sir!

843
01:20:33,755 --> 01:20:36,891
But I'm very sad.
- Why?

844
01:20:36,892 --> 01:20:39,727
The fatty hit you in front of me.

845
01:20:39,728 --> 01:20:41,821
That's why I make them pay 15 lakhs tax.

846
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:45,858
Do you know something? it was not painful.
- How?

847
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:49,730
It's been a daily routine.
- You are so good.

848
01:20:50,171 --> 01:20:54,835
I don't like being praised
- You are a genius.

849
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:59,146
This is okay. Don't forget to note this down.

850
01:21:01,449 --> 01:21:03,349
Use this!
- Thanks sir.

851
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:08,751
Note it, so that in the future...
- Write it on your grave stone?

852
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:13,282
It'll be helpful in your future.
- Okay sir.

853
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:18,456
He has answers for everything.
- Be careful, don't scratch it.

854
01:21:20,068 --> 01:21:22,298
It's a new bike.

855
01:21:23,605 --> 01:21:26,199
I should be bathing the chicks, not the cows.

856
01:21:26,308 --> 01:21:32,146
Hi Santosh! How are you?
- I'm not fine at all.

857
01:21:32,147 --> 01:21:36,777
My bad luck started since I gave you a ride.

858
01:21:37,652 --> 01:21:41,452
I wanted to tackle you, but my life is gone
now.

859
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:45,516
Don't worry Santosh, I'll definitely help you.

860
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:50,997
If you follow my idea, you
can leave this place.

861
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:56,129
What is it Santosh?
- I just had an idea.

862
01:21:56,705 --> 01:21:57,535
What is it?

863
01:21:57,973 --> 01:22:01,208
Thandabani kidnapped Pooja from the
wedding hall right?

864
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:03,439
He should be in the wedding photos?

865
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,069
I'm coming.

866
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:11,177
Why didn't you think of this earlier?

867
01:22:12,153 --> 01:22:14,018
Bring the pictures.

868
01:22:27,068 --> 01:22:29,628
He's the one! Go and get him.

869
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:34,241
It better be true, else I'll chop your head.

870
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:37,109
I'm very sure, he's the one. Get him.

871
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:40,039
You've seen the violent one, now you see
the dumb one.

872
01:22:40,715 --> 01:22:42,774
Sir!
- What happened?

873
01:22:44,853 --> 01:22:47,378
You have some visitors.

874
01:22:48,289 --> 01:22:51,087
Who are you?
- I'm Santoshkanth.

875
01:22:58,099 --> 01:23:00,124
You can leave. We'll handle it.

876
01:23:01,636 --> 01:23:04,434
I would like to say something before I leave.

877
01:23:04,506 --> 01:23:07,241
I have said it before, but let me repeat it.

878
01:23:07,242 --> 01:23:10,006
Thandabani is a dangerous guy.

879
01:23:10,078 --> 01:23:12,376
He will somehow try to stop this wedding.

880
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:18,786
For your own good! Please be careful. The rest
is up to you.

881
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:20,345
Wait!
- What happened sir?

882
01:23:20,488 --> 01:23:25,084
You know him so well. And you have stayed
so long..

883
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:28,095
...continue staying until the wedding is over.

884
01:23:28,997 --> 01:23:31,465
Why should I be here? I'm not conducting
the wedding.

885
01:23:31,533 --> 01:23:33,428
This is between you and Thandabani.
I'm leaving.

886
01:23:34,102 --> 01:23:35,660
Tie him in the cow shed.

887
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:40,107
He ruined everything.
- Who said that?

888
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:41,368
Eka?
- Sir!

889
01:23:41,709 --> 01:23:45,509
Who is he?
- He's Siva, my nephew.

890
01:23:45,647 --> 01:23:47,239
Vanakkam sir!

891
01:23:48,516 --> 01:23:50,651
He's an expert in accounts.

892
01:23:50,652 --> 01:23:54,254
There's a businessman in the US by the name
of Washington Vetrivel.

893
01:23:54,255 --> 01:24:00,060
He's the auditor for him. Your brother hired
him as well.

894
01:24:00,061 --> 01:24:03,224
I brought him here to work for you as well.

895
01:24:03,364 --> 01:24:07,460
Can he manage both the accounts?
- How can you doubt that?

896
01:24:07,569 --> 01:24:09,103
You have a brother right?

897
01:24:09,104 --> 01:24:12,972
Washington Vetrivel has a brother too..

898
01:24:13,074 --> 01:24:17,811
...by the name of Chicago Saktivel.
Their fortune is worth billions.

899
01:24:17,812 --> 01:24:23,011
He alone managed their accounts.
- Really?

900
01:24:23,284 --> 01:24:27,414
He's very familiar with taxes.

901
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,288
Is it true?

902
01:24:33,828 --> 01:24:35,829
I have prepared the accounts.

903
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:39,163
If you are okay, we can pay the tax.

904
01:24:39,534 --> 01:24:42,002
How do I know all these?

905
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:46,571
Take him to help you.
- Okay sir!

906
01:24:46,741 --> 01:24:52,077
Uncle, you should not trust blindly.
- Why?

907
01:24:52,147 --> 01:24:56,379
I was going through last year's accounts.

908
01:24:56,851 --> 01:25:01,755
A big scam has been going on.
- Scam?

909
01:25:01,756 --> 01:25:05,351
It means robbery. Rs 15 was missing.

910
01:25:06,027 --> 01:25:10,657
I must have forgotten to write it.

911
01:25:12,634 --> 01:25:18,436
It's just Rsl 5.
- It might become Rsl 5 lakhs in the future.

912
01:25:19,908 --> 01:25:21,909
You are right. Eka!
- Sir!

913
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:26,779
Let her go through the accounts before you
pay the tax.

914
01:25:26,848 --> 01:25:28,645
Eka!
- Madam!

915
01:25:28,716 --> 01:25:31,184
Is he your assistant?
- Yes madam.

916
01:25:31,886 --> 01:25:35,185
Can he speak English?
- Sometimes.

917
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:38,482
Come here.
- Excuse me?

918
01:25:39,494 --> 01:25:42,827
Yes madam?
- Bring the accounts.

919
01:25:43,531 --> 01:25:45,362
I must check it.
- Okay.

920
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,362
Don't expose me.
- What?

921
01:25:48,703 --> 01:25:52,161
I told him to show the accounts in detail.

922
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,508
I told you to follow me.
- Okay.

923
01:25:58,746 --> 01:26:01,772
What accounts are we checking?
- No such thing.

924
01:26:01,883 --> 01:26:08,516
My uncle was disturbing me. Take care of
him first.

925
01:26:09,591 --> 01:26:15,791
I'll handle him, but you take care of me.
- No Siva!

926
01:26:16,698 --> 01:26:19,189
Listen to me! Don't do it.

927
01:26:33,281 --> 01:26:37,581
Does it hurt?
- No, it's fun.

928
01:26:48,896 --> 01:26:52,093
He tackled her.
- Is this how to check the accounts?

929
01:26:55,737 --> 01:26:57,102
Is anyone else watching?

930
01:26:59,941 --> 01:27:02,307
It's like watching an English movie.

931
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,448
What will happen if anyone sees?

932
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:13,020
Not me sir.
- Why are you so shocked?

933
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:14,989
I was looking at the accounts.

934
01:27:15,089 --> 01:27:20,761
Are you scared you'll be apprehended?
- It's not that.

935
01:27:20,762 --> 01:27:23,731
You can't easily fool my daughter-in-law.
- I know.

936
01:27:23,831 --> 01:27:27,501
You know right? Come.
- You go, I'll check the accounts and...

937
01:27:27,502 --> 01:27:29,026
Come!
- Let me go.

938
01:27:33,775 --> 01:27:37,438
I love her more than my own children.

939
01:27:38,646 --> 01:27:40,375
Her happiness is more important to me.

940
01:27:41,115 --> 01:27:44,278
She must live happily wherever she is.

941
01:27:48,923 --> 01:27:51,084
Take her away from here.

942
01:27:52,794 --> 01:27:59,495
I could have, if I wanted to. But she loves
you too.

943
01:28:00,468 --> 01:28:04,371
This wedding will take place with everyone's
blessing..

944
01:28:04,372 --> 01:28:08,742
...as her parents' wished.
That's why all this..

945
01:28:08,743 --> 01:28:12,440
I can't imagine what they'll
do if they find out.

946
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,483
They are so violent. They won't understand.

947
01:28:16,484 --> 01:28:18,145
We must make them understand.

948
01:28:18,486 --> 01:28:20,750
I will do it, trust me.

949
01:28:22,957 --> 01:28:23,981
Let me go.

950
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,157
Did I do as you asked?
- As I asked?

951
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:32,563
As I asked? Did I ask you to hug the girl?

952
01:28:33,401 --> 01:28:38,361
Do you need all this?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

953
01:28:41,709 --> 01:28:45,338
With this innocent look, you do things at
the back.

954
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:48,738
How dare you hug Gounder's daughter?

955
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:52,986
Hug him if you a dare?
- She fell on me.

956
01:28:54,822 --> 01:28:56,050
Why are you shouting?

957
01:28:56,324 --> 01:29:00,784
This is normal for them. We must be cautious.

958
01:29:02,063 --> 01:29:05,232
No matter who's mistake it was..

959
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:06,725
...the one who'll be punished is...

960
01:29:10,037 --> 01:29:12,096
...me! Please understand.

961
01:29:19,747 --> 01:29:23,183
Why wave from here? Go there and do it.

962
01:29:23,751 --> 01:29:25,810
Will you do everything I say?

963
01:29:26,254 --> 01:29:29,189
Don't hit me.
- What were you thinking?

964
01:29:30,591 --> 01:29:37,155
They'll kill you if they find out. Go start
the bike.

965
01:29:37,432 --> 01:29:39,466
You embarrassed me in front of her.
- Embarrassed?

966
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:46,166
You pushed the bike..

967
01:29:47,775 --> 01:29:49,503
...and now you're trying to be funny. Stop!

968
01:29:49,577 --> 01:29:52,446
This bike is a gift for my wedding.

969
01:29:52,447 --> 01:29:54,481
I spend more time with this bike than..

970
01:29:54,482 --> 01:29:58,748
I meant the bike. Lift it up!

971
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:03,481
Come here! You started your nonsense on the
first day itself!

972
01:30:03,891 --> 01:30:07,258
I regret hiring you. Let's go!

973
01:30:07,328 --> 01:30:10,820
Push the bike. Walk faster.

974
01:30:11,499 --> 01:30:15,101
See that look? Maybe they have made some
plans...

975
01:30:15,102 --> 01:30:17,602
See that look? Maybe they have made some
plans...

976
01:34:18,212 --> 01:34:19,645
Velu has regain consciousness.

977
01:34:22,283 --> 01:34:25,275
Siva told us to wait here, but where is he?

978
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,554
Siva won't do anything without reason.

979
01:34:36,931 --> 01:34:39,058
Pooja!
- Aunty!

980
01:34:40,901 --> 01:34:42,163
How are you?

981
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,502
It's been a long time since we saw you.

982
01:34:52,413 --> 01:34:55,648
Meenakshi!
- Sister!

983
01:34:55,649 --> 01:35:00,518
We are staying in the same town but unable
to meet.

984
01:35:00,788 --> 01:35:03,814
What to do? it's our fate.

985
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:12,458
We could meet today because of you.

986
01:35:18,839 --> 01:35:22,206
Today is an auspicious day, you should have
join the prayers.

987
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:25,244
Devoutness should be kept within.

988
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:27,843
Then you should have stayed home instead.
- What?

989
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:31,384
I came here as a spy.
- Okay.

990
01:35:31,385 --> 01:35:36,422
My grandpa suspects both the sisters are
meeting up.

991
01:35:36,423 --> 01:35:39,824
That's why he sent me here to spy.
- Okay.

992
01:35:42,696 --> 01:35:43,954
No one should know this.
- Okay.

993
01:35:44,198 --> 01:35:49,402
But I know. No one can escape from me.

994
01:35:49,403 --> 01:35:52,272
Grandma, what are you doing here?

995
01:35:52,273 --> 01:35:54,901
My darling, how are you?
- Take your hands off me.

996
01:35:55,209 --> 01:35:57,075
You should not be rude to your elder's.

997
01:35:57,076 --> 01:35:59,407
You are in charge of the accounts. What are
you doing here?

998
01:35:59,413 --> 01:36:02,041
What do you know about our family feud?

999
01:36:02,449 --> 01:36:06,943
If my grandpa finds out, he'll kill everyone
including you.

1000
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:11,453
If you tell grandpa, I'll
kill you with poison.

1001
01:36:11,559 --> 01:36:14,994
You can't talk after that. Get in the car!

1002
01:36:14,995 --> 01:36:18,658
Let's go! What are you staring at? I must
resign from this CID post!

1003
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:22,269
Please don't mistake him, he's exactly like
his grandpa.

1004
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:25,137
I wonder when he will change?

1005
01:36:25,606 --> 01:36:29,269
Leave it, he's still young. Things will get
better soon.

1006
01:36:29,376 --> 01:36:30,570
You don't worry.

1007
01:36:33,113 --> 01:36:36,947
I watched Spiderman on TV yesterday. it
was superb.

1008
01:36:37,017 --> 01:36:40,646
He's really great.
- What's so great?

1009
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:43,389
That's just graphics.
- How about batman?

1010
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:47,690
Batman or Ballman! There's someone
greater than them. -Tigerman!

1011
01:36:55,469 --> 01:36:58,438
You?
- Why are you shocked?

1012
01:36:58,505 --> 01:37:01,341
Has Spiderman ever bought chocolate for you?
- No!

1013
01:37:01,342 --> 01:37:03,843
No right? I'm the one who buys right?
- Yes!

1014
01:37:03,844 --> 01:37:07,380
So from now on, you must only praise.

1015
01:37:07,381 --> 01:37:10,083
If you ever praise anyone
else in front of me..

1016
01:37:10,084 --> 01:37:12,243
...you'll receive the same punishment as
the teacher.

1017
01:37:12,887 --> 01:37:14,514
Everyone go back now!

1018
01:37:17,424 --> 01:37:20,193
How was the punch dialogue?
- Superb!

1019
01:37:20,194 --> 01:37:21,855
The umbrella is for me, not you.

1020
01:37:29,637 --> 01:37:31,037
Catch it!
- Okay!

1021
01:37:31,038 --> 01:37:33,268
Run faster! Don't let it go.

1022
01:37:38,178 --> 01:37:41,739
Where are you going?

1023
01:37:42,216 --> 01:37:44,684
I won't let you go. Listen to me.

1024
01:37:51,392 --> 01:37:52,757
Where did it go?

1025
01:37:57,898 --> 01:38:01,000
It looks spooky here. I must leave
immediately.

1026
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:02,696
Mustn't stay here any longer.

1027
01:38:08,776 --> 01:38:10,437
Who are you?

1028
01:38:18,352 --> 01:38:19,512
What are you doing here?

1029
01:38:24,358 --> 01:38:27,259
I'm here to decide who's greater.

1030
01:38:30,798 --> 01:38:34,359
I'm flying! Let me go! it was a mistake.

1031
01:38:34,635 --> 01:38:36,603
Is this how you'll let go?

1032
01:38:53,654 --> 01:38:58,353
Not again?
- You must respect your elders.

1033
01:38:59,126 --> 01:39:01,026
Turn around?
- Why?

1034
01:39:01,128 --> 01:39:05,121
I'm going to cut your pony tail.
- Please don't!

1035
01:39:05,466 --> 01:39:08,026
This is not just a pony tail,
it is my family's dignity.

1036
01:39:11,805 --> 01:39:13,204
Please don't!

1037
01:39:15,876 --> 01:39:17,343
My pony tail is gone.

1038
01:39:20,848 --> 01:39:21,542
Grandma!

1039
01:39:25,586 --> 01:39:29,317
Bless me.
- Darling!

1040
01:39:30,157 --> 01:39:34,184
You'll have long life.
- Mum, you too bless me.

1041
01:39:34,628 --> 01:39:38,962
What's all this?
- I'm going to school.

1042
01:39:39,433 --> 01:39:41,731
Be careful, okay?
- Okay grandma.

1043
01:39:43,003 --> 01:39:46,072
Eka, your nephew is very intelligent.

1044
01:39:46,073 --> 01:39:49,736
He reduced this year's tax by Rs 30,000.

1045
01:39:50,911 --> 01:39:54,813
Am I right Lingam?
- Yes. Eka, he's better than you.

1046
01:39:55,082 --> 01:39:57,277
You should become his assistant.

1047
01:39:58,619 --> 01:40:00,211
Correct!

1048
01:40:01,255 --> 01:40:03,523
Puli!!
- Grandpa?

1049
01:40:03,524 --> 01:40:09,087
Why are you covering your head?
- That's because...

1050
01:40:09,396 --> 01:40:14,663
I have a cold and don't want my ears to get
infected.

1051
01:40:15,035 --> 01:40:16,662
Mustn't take it out.

1052
01:40:23,277 --> 01:40:27,577
Uncle, it's me Pooja.
- Pooja, how are you?

1053
01:40:27,648 --> 01:40:30,481
Are you fine?
- No, uncle.

1054
01:40:31,051 --> 01:40:35,920
Uncle wants me to marry his son.

1055
01:40:36,723 --> 01:40:39,988
But I'm not interested.

1056
01:40:40,828 --> 01:40:47,791
My mum appeared in my dream and told me
to marry your son.

1057
01:40:48,469 --> 01:40:51,097
I'll only marry your son.

1058
01:40:51,905 --> 01:40:56,535
Don't worry, you'll be here by tonight.

1059
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:02,882
Thangarasu, my daughter-in-law called and..

1060
01:41:02,883 --> 01:41:05,351
...said she'll only marry you.

1061
01:41:06,286 --> 01:41:08,151
If I don't grant her wishes..

1062
01:41:08,222 --> 01:41:10,884
...my sister's soul won't rest in peace.

1063
01:41:11,525 --> 01:41:17,864
Go and call all our men to come here.

1064
01:41:17,865 --> 01:41:20,766
We'll challenge them and see who's better.

1065
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:25,900
Rs 100 million will be mine.

1066
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:33,840
Money! Money!
- Sir? Sir?

1067
01:41:34,248 --> 01:41:38,378
Faster come.
- Don't get excited. Be careful.

1068
01:41:41,455 --> 01:41:43,422
Bring me some water. it's money.

1069
01:41:43,423 --> 01:41:47,655
No disease can harm us if we have money.

1070
01:41:48,362 --> 01:41:51,024
What you are doing is wrong.

1071
01:41:51,565 --> 01:41:54,500
Why are you blabbering? They'll chop
off our head.

1072
01:41:54,501 --> 01:41:58,460
It's okay. This is for his own good.

1073
01:41:58,772 --> 01:42:02,572
What are you up to now? You don't say
anything. Keep quiet.

1074
01:42:02,676 --> 01:42:04,877
Eka, what's that?

1075
01:42:04,878 --> 01:42:07,278
It's nothing.
- You keep quiet. Let him talk.

1076
01:42:07,514 --> 01:42:09,607
Come! Tell me.

1077
01:42:10,784 --> 01:42:13,810
How much will you get if she becomes your
daughter-in-law?

1078
01:42:14,388 --> 01:42:18,347
Why is he asking such a silly question?

1079
01:42:19,526 --> 01:42:24,361
I'll get Rsl 00 million worth of
fortune, all in American dollars!

1080
01:42:24,598 --> 01:42:28,090
He's just blabbering.
- No, I know what I'm saying.

1081
01:42:31,038 --> 01:42:32,630
Just for 100 million...

1082
01:42:36,843 --> 01:42:40,108
You are competing against your brother for
just 100 million.

1083
01:42:40,514 --> 01:42:44,041
If you propose a girl whose fortune is

1084
01:42:44,518 --> 01:42:46,420
...it means you won against your brother
right?

1085
01:42:46,421 --> 01:42:47,853
Eka?
- Sir?

1086
01:42:47,854 --> 01:42:52,257
Has he gone mad?
- He might have drank some expired...

1087
01:42:52,626 --> 01:42:55,322
...medicine that's why he's blabbering. You
don't take it seriously.

1088
01:42:56,063 --> 01:42:59,794
Okay! Let's look at it logically.

1089
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:06,170
Where would we find a 500 million fortune?
- Now that you asked..

1090
01:43:06,873 --> 01:43:08,431
...In America...
- Here!

1091
01:43:09,109 --> 01:43:12,237
...In America, not only your brother in law
is rich.

1092
01:43:12,713 --> 01:43:15,648
There are many families richer than him.

1093
01:43:16,116 --> 01:43:18,584
Uncle, why didn't you tell him about
Washington Vetrivel?

1094
01:43:18,652 --> 01:43:21,018
What? Washing machine Vajravelu?

1095
01:43:23,123 --> 01:43:27,082
Yes! Yes! Washington Vetrivel. He's
a gentleman.

1096
01:43:27,394 --> 01:43:28,718
Tell him how much fortune he has?

1097
01:43:28,996 --> 01:43:31,829
He has 2 cows, 1 chicken...

1098
01:43:31,898 --> 01:43:35,493
...worth millions. Total about 500 million.

1099
01:43:36,703 --> 01:43:37,671
It is right?
- Yes!

1100
01:43:37,672 --> 01:43:41,630
Tell about his daughter.
- Which daughter?

1101
01:43:41,708 --> 01:43:44,143
That girl... proposal...

1102
01:43:44,144 --> 01:43:46,312
Oh that girl? She is a little weird.

1103
01:43:46,313 --> 01:43:48,645
No, she knows typing, shorthand and
computing.

1104
01:43:49,116 --> 01:43:51,914
They are looking for a proposal right?
- Yes!

1105
01:43:52,953 --> 01:43:57,123
Now tell about him?
- About whom?

1106
01:43:57,124 --> 01:43:59,718
Whom? Tell about our Thangarasu.

1107
01:44:00,027 --> 01:44:02,461
Thangarasu?
- Why? What's wrong with him?

1108
01:44:03,163 --> 01:44:05,256
I didn't say there's anything wrong.

1109
01:44:05,432 --> 01:44:08,265
You are responsible for finding them a
groom right?

1110
01:44:08,368 --> 01:44:12,238
Yes, so what?
- What you mean why?

1111
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,799
What else to ask? There's no script to follow.

1112
01:44:14,908 --> 01:44:19,743
They are coming here to look for an
Indian groom.

1113
01:44:20,113 --> 01:44:21,478
Are they coming?
- Yes!

1114
01:44:21,682 --> 01:44:23,216
They are coming!
- They are coming!

1115
01:44:23,217 --> 01:44:27,482
You are responsible for that?
- What responsibility?

1116
01:44:27,621 --> 01:44:31,489
Responsibility!
- Responsibility! I'm responsible for it.

1117
01:44:31,692 --> 01:44:35,685
Why didn't you tell me about this before?
- I just found out.

1118
01:44:35,796 --> 01:44:36,990
I'll hit you.
- Sir!

1119
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:44,500
I don't care what you do.
I want this proposal.

1120
01:44:44,705 --> 01:44:48,664
There's another proposal worth 300 million..
- But it's short of 200million!

1121
01:44:49,242 --> 01:44:53,076
I only want Washington Vetrivel's proposal.
Understood?

1122
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:56,511
I understand.
- You understood right? Explain to him.

1123
01:44:56,683 --> 01:45:00,886
If it doesn't happen, I'll
chop off your uncle's..

1124
01:45:00,887 --> 01:45:02,411
Sir!
- ..Head.

1125
01:45:04,091 --> 01:45:06,855
Come, let's go uncle.

1126
01:45:09,496 --> 01:45:15,468
Get out! I pitied you and hired you to work..

1127
01:45:15,469 --> 01:45:17,703
...but you landed me in trouble.

1128
01:45:17,704 --> 01:45:19,604
I don't want to see you again. Get lost!

1129
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:23,532
What was my mistake?
- How dare you?

1130
01:45:23,643 --> 01:45:28,410
Dear, Washington Vetrivel called many
times.

1131
01:45:28,582 --> 01:45:31,117
They are coming here regarding their
daughter's wedding.

1132
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:33,848
They told you to book the guest house.

1133
01:45:38,325 --> 01:45:39,223
What do you say now?

1134
01:45:40,227 --> 01:45:42,252
How can you mention his name if you don't
know him?

1135
01:45:42,329 --> 01:45:44,263
Or did he call you without knowing you?

1136
01:45:48,101 --> 01:45:51,593
So many problems?
- No, I'm confused.

1137
01:45:51,938 --> 01:45:53,272
No confusion at all.

1138
01:45:53,273 --> 01:45:56,504
This is what we call subconscious memory
power.

1139
01:45:56,610 --> 01:46:00,444
I'm already confused. Please don't add to it.

1140
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:03,310
Help me understand.
- It's...

1141
01:46:07,621 --> 01:46:11,648
...The subconscious memory is a power.

1142
01:46:11,758 --> 01:46:14,056
...Only 1 in 1000 will have it.

1143
01:46:14,161 --> 01:46:19,360
We tend to forget our old friends..

1144
01:46:19,433 --> 01:46:22,732
...but our brain will store that information.

1145
01:46:22,969 --> 01:46:28,202
At times, only the greatest will attain
this power.

1146
01:46:28,775 --> 01:46:33,337
Why are you nodding?
- I understood what you said.

1147
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:39,246
If you keep putting stones into a jar filled
with less water..

1148
01:46:39,319 --> 01:46:41,947
...eventually it will rise. isn't that what
you meant?

1149
01:46:42,055 --> 01:46:44,023
You understood well. Almost.

1150
01:46:44,891 --> 01:46:48,759
But, only a smart crow can do that.

1151
01:46:49,095 --> 01:46:53,156
So.. I'm intelligent or am I a crow?
- You are a genius.

1152
01:46:55,068 --> 01:46:56,636
You are not crazy to simply mention..

1153
01:46:56,637 --> 01:46:59,739
...Washington Vetrivel's name.
- I mentioned about him..

1154
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:01,475
...but how did I mention about the wedding?

1155
01:47:01,476 --> 01:47:04,777
How did you?
- That's what I'm asking you.

1156
01:47:04,778 --> 01:47:06,741
- That's what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

1157
01:47:06,813 --> 01:47:09,482
Sub-conscious memory power.
- Look at that!

1158
01:47:09,483 --> 01:47:13,817
Of course! You are not an astrologer to
predict the future.

1159
01:47:14,187 --> 01:47:17,056
Don't keep saying that. I am beginning to
doubt myself.

1160
01:47:17,057 --> 01:47:20,220
But you are doubting me as well. I'm
leaving.

1161
01:47:20,393 --> 01:47:22,156
Wait!
- Did you call me?

1162
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:26,956
Even with all this power, I'm scared to work
for them.

1163
01:47:27,033 --> 01:47:31,403
You must not leave me at a time like this.
- I won't leave you.

1164
01:47:31,404 --> 01:47:34,202
I won't leave. I have a lot more to learn
from you.

1165
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:40,471
You are an encyclopaedia.
- God bless you!

1166
01:47:40,614 --> 01:47:41,842
Bring your bags in.

1167
01:47:45,652 --> 01:47:51,257
The character that I created, called and asked
me to book a guest house.

1168
01:47:51,258 --> 01:47:56,059
What can I say? What power is that?

1169
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:58,759
Subconscious memory power.

1170
01:48:00,767 --> 01:48:06,034
Eka, Will they come or not?
- I can only tell him if I knew.

1171
01:48:06,806 --> 01:48:08,706
They'll definitely come. You wait inside.

1172
01:49:03,129 --> 01:49:04,528
The character you created.

1173
01:49:11,471 --> 01:49:12,995
Why are you shocked?

1174
01:49:22,082 --> 01:49:24,380
What happened to him?

1175
01:49:24,451 --> 01:49:28,751
He was worried you might not come.

1176
01:49:29,789 --> 01:49:34,249
How is Lalitha? Your wife Lallu?

1177
01:49:36,963 --> 01:49:38,954
Why are you staring at me? it's me, Lakshmi.

1178
01:49:39,366 --> 01:49:42,392
You used to love my coffee. Have you
forgotten?

1179
01:49:46,306 --> 01:49:47,796
He's getting old.

1180
01:49:50,443 --> 01:49:52,206
Come!

1181
01:49:55,448 --> 01:49:57,882
Welcome! Welcome!
- Who are you people?

1182
01:49:58,051 --> 01:50:01,384
Don't you have any manners.This is
considered rude in America.

1183
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:07,349
Who is he? He looks like a painter.
- He's the PA.

1184
01:50:08,828 --> 01:50:12,594
Why are you staring? Tell them about us.
- Keep quiet.

1185
01:50:13,066 --> 01:50:18,404
He meant me. He's still in shock. I'll tell
them.

1186
01:50:18,405 --> 01:50:24,366
He's Chinnamuthu Gounder. He's one of the
richest family here.

1187
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:26,078
They came here to see you.

1188
01:50:28,114 --> 01:50:29,479
This is for you. Vanakkam!

1189
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,012
I am quite tired after the flight.

1190
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:37,890
Let me go and freshen up. We'll talk
later.

1191
01:50:38,558 --> 01:50:41,026
Mr Eka, make them comfortable until I come.

1192
01:50:48,501 --> 01:50:51,231
You are in shock as if your runaway wife just
came back.

1193
01:50:51,504 --> 01:50:53,228
When are you going to tell them about us?

1194
01:50:53,306 --> 01:50:55,941
He's so happy to see them after so long..

1195
01:50:55,942 --> 01:50:58,035
...he'll be himself shortly.
Please take a seat.

1196
01:51:03,316 --> 01:51:08,583
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- It's okay.

1197
01:51:09,522 --> 01:51:12,389
Eka has mentioned a lot about you.

1198
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:15,492
We are a respected family in this town.

1199
01:51:16,029 --> 01:51:17,696
We can see it from your pony tail.

1200
01:51:17,697 --> 01:51:19,765
Are you the dancing troops for the temple
festival?

1201
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,230
Keep quiet!

1202
01:51:21,801 --> 01:51:26,829
Although we are not equal to you, we are
quite rich too.

1203
01:51:27,006 --> 01:51:28,166
Money is not everything.

1204
01:51:28,541 --> 01:51:31,203
I only remember the first million that
I made.

1205
01:51:31,478 --> 01:51:35,244
I don't know how much I have accumulated.

1206
01:51:36,015 --> 01:51:39,885
Eka said it's about 500 million. Is that true?

1207
01:51:39,886 --> 01:51:41,887
500 million?

1208
01:51:41,888 --> 01:51:46,382
Did you only mention the 500 million that's
in India?

1209
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:51,187
In India alone 500 million? What is the total?

1210
01:51:51,364 --> 01:51:53,832
He doesn't keep track of all that.

1211
01:51:55,568 --> 01:52:00,870
Why have you come here?
- It's nothing!

1212
01:52:01,174 --> 01:52:05,844
Eka told me you were looking for a proposal
for your daughter.

1213
01:52:05,845 --> 01:52:09,747
I'm more concerned about tradition rather
than money.

1214
01:52:09,883 --> 01:52:13,250
I'm waiting for such a proposal.
- Me too!

1215
01:52:13,319 --> 01:52:16,379
He's Thangarasu, my youngest son.

1216
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:18,655
He has studied up to 3rd standard.

1217
01:52:19,125 --> 01:52:23,221
I'm here to ask your daughter's hand in
marriage, for him.

1218
01:52:25,932 --> 01:52:28,833
Eka, I gave you the responsibility to search..

1219
01:52:29,102 --> 01:52:32,503
...for a proposal, but you brought some hooligans.
- No!

1220
01:52:33,873 --> 01:52:34,771
Secretary!
- Sir?

1221
01:52:34,908 --> 01:52:37,968
Chase them out!
- Okay sir!

1222
01:52:38,812 --> 01:52:43,044
Please listen to me.
- Get out before he...

1223
01:53:00,099 --> 01:53:01,726
You did a good job.

1224
01:53:03,469 --> 01:53:08,240
Uncle, you were great.
- What did you think of my acting?

1225
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:10,835
Twice I received the gold medal for acting.

1226
01:53:12,612 --> 01:53:16,481
I was worried you might ruin it, but it
was okay..

1227
01:53:16,482 --> 01:53:19,117
What's all these? Dramas like in the cinemas
and..

1228
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:22,576
...those weird guys with their pony tails.
It's so funny to see them.

1229
01:53:23,056 --> 01:53:26,058
Do you like Pooja?
- That's why we are here.

1230
01:53:26,059 --> 01:53:28,660
Let's take her home with us.
- It's not that...

1231
01:53:28,661 --> 01:53:32,831
Why are you worried? Don't you trust
our acting?

1232
01:53:32,832 --> 01:53:36,768
Everything will be fine. I like this character
very much.

1233
01:53:36,836 --> 01:53:39,361
What's the next scene?
- Next scene...

1234
01:53:39,839 --> 01:53:43,468
What? We look uncivilised?

1235
01:53:43,643 --> 01:53:47,412
Your BP is shooting up. That's why I didn't
want to tell you.

1236
01:53:47,413 --> 01:53:51,281
It's nothing! My BP will only shoot up if..

1237
01:53:51,684 --> 01:53:54,915
...I do not get this proposal. What must I
do now?

1238
01:53:55,021 --> 01:53:59,720
Must I change into pants and shirt?

1239
01:54:00,093 --> 01:54:03,392
Not only that, they have some conditions.

1240
01:54:03,563 --> 01:54:08,262
Tell me what it is? Why are you standing
like a statue?

1241
01:54:08,501 --> 01:54:11,834
I should stand like a statue when you stand
like a mountain.

1242
01:54:12,505 --> 01:54:16,708
He's still in shock. Let me tell you.

1243
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:20,805
He was upset you did not bring the ladies.
- Ladies??

1244
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:24,343
Wait, Hey Meenakshi!
- Yes.

1245
01:54:24,817 --> 01:54:27,809
Go and change into something nice.

1246
01:54:27,921 --> 01:54:30,287
Let's go and secure this proposal.
- Okay.

1247
01:54:31,391 --> 01:54:32,756
Is that all?

1248
01:54:33,259 --> 01:54:37,889
There's one more condition left?
- What is that?

1249
01:54:38,064 --> 01:54:40,089
I don't know how to say it.

1250
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:43,568
It will never happen. Let's leave it.
Am I right, uncle?

1251
01:54:43,937 --> 01:54:45,097
Yes, that is a bit difficult.

1252
01:54:45,204 --> 01:54:47,139
What's so difficult? Just tell me.

1253
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:50,142
What to tell?
- You'll hit me if I say it.

1254
01:54:50,143 --> 01:54:53,601
Why must I hit? Just tell me.

1255
01:54:53,947 --> 01:54:56,313
You all must...

1256
01:54:57,250 --> 01:55:01,050
...cut your pony tails.
- What?

1257
01:55:03,356 --> 01:55:10,295
Must cut the pony tails.This is our family's
pride and dignity.

1258
01:55:10,296 --> 01:55:16,132
How can we remove it?
- That's why we rejected them.

1259
01:55:16,602 --> 01:55:20,197
Would anyone cut their pony tail for a
mere 500 million?

1260
01:55:21,007 --> 01:55:23,441
We'll search elsewhere just as you said.

1261
01:55:24,811 --> 01:55:29,339
Yes.We'll search elsewhere.
- Where will you go?

1262
01:55:29,916 --> 01:55:35,081
It'll grow back. But can I get 500 million?
- No!

1263
01:55:35,888 --> 01:55:39,051
Let's cut our pony tails.
- It will happen.

1264
01:55:39,826 --> 01:55:43,261
What will happen?
- We'll cut our pony tails.

1265
01:55:43,262 --> 01:55:46,993
Firstly, cut my dad's pony tail.

1266
01:56:20,233 --> 01:56:25,569
Mr Eka, how are you? How's your wife
Lallu?

1267
01:56:27,073 --> 01:56:29,667
Why are you imitating Washington Vetrivel?
- Yes?

1268
01:56:30,243 --> 01:56:33,144
My own creation over took me.

1269
01:56:33,513 --> 01:56:35,777
He is treating me as though we are old
friends.

1270
01:56:36,382 --> 01:56:39,180
I don't understand what's happening here.

1271
01:56:39,452 --> 01:56:42,683
Siva, what's the power that I have?

1272
01:56:42,789 --> 01:56:44,790
I said it this morning, try to remember?

1273
01:56:44,791 --> 01:56:47,055
Priest's beard caught fire!

1274
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:50,488
It's called subconscious memory power.
- Yes!

1275
01:56:50,797 --> 01:56:55,598
What are the symptoms?
- You'll be very confused.

1276
01:56:56,269 --> 01:56:59,500
You will always be suspicious, like to
imagine things.

1277
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:04,308
In the end, you'll feel like committing
suicide.

1278
01:57:04,944 --> 01:57:06,138
Suicide?
- Yes.

1279
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:10,381
I'm already married, not again. I can't
take it.

1280
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:13,742
How to make these thoughts disappear?

1281
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:15,920
There's a way?
- How?

1282
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:21,422
Right or wrong, you must genuinely believe
in it.

1283
01:57:21,794 --> 01:57:26,595
If you think a lot, then you'll go crazy.
- No!

1284
01:57:26,966 --> 01:57:31,665
I'll believe. I have fixed my mind that I
know them.

1285
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:34,399
There will be no more problems right?
- No.

1286
01:57:41,013 --> 01:57:44,881
You alone can stop everyone from drinking.

1287
01:57:58,498 --> 01:58:01,433
You are all close to each other right?
- Yes.

1288
01:58:01,534 --> 01:58:06,238
We are very close to each other. Am I
right Eka?

1289
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:08,298
Yes sir! Even the madam is pregnant now.

1290
01:58:09,342 --> 01:58:12,971
No, I meant she's taking good care of the
family.

1291
01:58:13,846 --> 01:58:18,783
I would like to question you before we
discuss further.

1292
01:58:18,784 --> 01:58:22,220
Chinnamuthu Gounder is not educated.

1293
01:58:22,788 --> 01:58:24,847
He had to re-sit standard one nine times.

1294
01:58:25,057 --> 01:58:27,252
How will you question him?

1295
01:58:28,094 --> 01:58:30,460
My question is not related to education.

1296
01:58:31,097 --> 01:58:37,195
When is your wife's date of birth?
- Please answer.

1297
01:58:37,703 --> 01:58:40,604
Birthday...
- Why are you so shy?

1298
01:58:40,873 --> 01:58:47,608
Every year on the 28th August, the house will
be crowded.

1299
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,412
He'll never listen to me even if I say no.

1300
01:58:50,583 --> 01:58:55,213
He has done so much, but shy to tell you.

1301
01:58:59,892 --> 01:59:00,950
When is your wedding day?

1302
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:06,023
I myself can't answer, how will he?

1303
01:59:07,433 --> 01:59:10,231
He'll always tease me he lost his freedom..

1304
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:14,636
...on the day our country got it's freedom.

1305
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,944
How will you address your wives?

1306
01:59:30,423 --> 01:59:35,224
Won't you call her by name?
- It's not like that.

1307
01:59:36,195 --> 01:59:40,131
According to our ancestors, our life will be
shortened if called by name.

1308
01:59:40,433 --> 01:59:44,927
So, our husbands will never call us by name.
- Yes.

1309
01:59:47,006 --> 01:59:49,608
Don't you have any siblings?
- Don't you know?

1310
01:59:49,609 --> 01:59:51,941
He has a brother. His name is Periamuthu
Gounder.

1311
01:59:52,578 --> 01:59:55,741
You have a brother?
- You want me to have or not?

1312
01:59:56,816 --> 02:00:00,980
I have, but he's not here.

1313
02:00:02,421 --> 02:00:06,949
I'm confused. I don't understand.
- He was run over by a lorry.

1314
02:00:09,729 --> 02:00:11,395
You got it wrong. He has a brother..

1315
02:00:11,396 --> 02:00:13,132
...but he went outstation to buy a lorry.

1316
02:00:13,133 --> 02:00:14,656
That's what I meant.

1317
02:00:15,301 --> 02:00:19,897
He loves his brother same as you love
yours.

1318
02:00:21,207 --> 02:00:24,309
It's true. Tell them, Eka.
- I'll tell.

1319
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:27,545
Mr Vetrivel and Madam Lakshmi, everything is
going on smoothly.

1320
02:00:27,546 --> 02:00:30,548
You must also believe and there won't be any
problems.

1321
02:00:30,549 --> 02:00:34,508
We'll fix the wedding date once your brother
is back.

1322
02:00:37,256 --> 02:00:41,124
You told him about my brother?
- You do have a brother right?

1323
02:00:41,227 --> 02:00:44,529
They'll only agree if he comes. How to get
him to come?

1324
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:46,122
Call him and he'll come.

1325
02:00:46,232 --> 02:00:51,836
You don't worry. My uncle will bring him.

1326
02:00:51,837 --> 02:00:55,068
He has the power.
- Keep quiet!

1327
02:00:57,310 --> 02:01:01,371
I don't care what you do, I want him to come.

1328
02:01:01,881 --> 02:01:07,751
Else, my grandson wants a bat to play.

1329
02:01:08,821 --> 02:01:13,622
I'll chop your hands and give him to play.

1330
02:01:14,093 --> 02:01:14,855
Let's go!

1331
02:01:16,929 --> 02:01:23,232
He proposed elsewhere in fear of losing me.

1332
02:01:27,506 --> 02:01:30,236
Make sure the valuation of this house is
accurate?

1333
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:41,113
I'm Rishi Kumar, Recovery
Officer from the Bank.

1334
02:01:42,688 --> 02:01:46,681
Pooja's father owes our bank 200 million.

1335
02:01:47,059 --> 02:01:50,187
Unfortunately he died before settling it.

1336
02:01:50,863 --> 02:01:54,993
We confiscated all his properties in America
worth 100 million.

1337
02:01:55,267 --> 02:01:58,862
We are here for the balance 100 million.

1338
02:01:58,938 --> 02:02:02,240
Mr Pathmanaban named Pooja as his heir..

1339
02:02:02,241 --> 02:02:04,869
...so she must settle his debts.

1340
02:02:04,977 --> 02:02:10,115
We made inquiries and found out that
she's here.

1341
02:02:10,116 --> 02:02:13,051
You can ask Pooja if you have any doubts.

1342
02:02:15,821 --> 02:02:19,279
Yes uncle. it's true.

1343
02:02:22,194 --> 02:02:26,131
Even if it's true, there's nothing under
Pooja's name here.

1344
02:02:26,132 --> 02:02:30,626
Next week is her marriage to my uncle's son.
- Is it?

1345
02:02:34,206 --> 02:02:36,766
According to Hindu law, after the wedding..

1346
02:02:36,842 --> 02:02:39,245
...the wife will inherit half of the husband's
property.

1347
02:02:39,246 --> 02:02:43,011
We'll take that money to settle the debts.

1348
02:02:44,316 --> 02:02:48,810
What is he saying?
- That's how the law works.

1349
02:02:49,155 --> 02:02:52,215
What else can you do if it's fated?

1350
02:02:53,859 --> 02:02:55,417
Officer, please come here.

1351
02:02:57,897 --> 02:03:01,856
We made plans, but the wedding is not fixed.

1352
02:03:02,268 --> 02:03:03,963
Understand?
- Yes.

1353
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:07,533
She's so pretty. We will do our job.

1354
02:03:07,673 --> 02:03:09,231
You conduct the wedding. Bye.

1355
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:13,005
We'll be back.

1356
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:16,042
What's happening here, uncle?

1357
02:03:17,216 --> 02:03:21,084
My brother must have found out about this
and quietly backed off.

1358
02:03:21,854 --> 02:03:25,051
How dare he! I'll never let him go.

1359
02:03:26,425 --> 02:03:29,019
Can you please go in?
- Uncle?

1360
02:03:29,395 --> 02:03:35,095
Just go! She has brought debts as a
wedding dowry.

1361
02:03:35,201 --> 02:03:37,635
Eka, do you have any sense?

1362
02:03:37,636 --> 02:03:41,766
You should have arranged that proposal for me.

1363
02:03:41,874 --> 02:03:42,941
It's not my uncle's fault.

1364
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:48,046
You challenged your brother to make her your
daughter-in-law.

1365
02:03:48,047 --> 02:03:50,281
That's why my uncle twisted it technically.

1366
02:03:50,282 --> 02:03:54,514
Looks like I'll end up on the losing side.

1367
02:03:55,955 --> 02:03:58,719
I don't care what you do..

1368
02:03:58,824 --> 02:04:02,521
...I want that Washington Vetrivel's proposal!

1369
02:04:03,028 --> 02:04:07,298
How is that possible? Your brother has
already proposed.

1370
02:04:07,299 --> 02:04:09,324
Uncle.
- What?

1371
02:04:09,435 --> 02:04:11,926
I have an idea.
- Again?

1372
02:04:12,204 --> 02:04:15,440
Why not arrange for Washington Vetrivel's
brother's proposal?

1373
02:04:15,441 --> 02:04:17,568
Brother? Who is that brother?

1374
02:04:18,444 --> 02:04:24,082
You told me Chicago Saktivel is his brother.
- You told us.

1375
02:04:24,083 --> 02:04:26,950
Did I say that?
- Yes.

1376
02:04:27,686 --> 02:04:31,816
Yes, I said it. What should I do now?

1377
02:04:31,891 --> 02:04:38,296
What to do? Propose my son for his daughter.

1378
02:04:38,931 --> 02:04:41,195
They'll listen to whatever my uncle says.
- Is it?

1379
02:04:46,605 --> 02:04:50,341
I didn't expect you to wield so much power.

1380
02:04:50,342 --> 02:04:52,173
Neither did I.

1381
02:04:53,245 --> 02:04:54,507
Uncle?
- Yes.

1382
02:04:54,613 --> 02:04:57,446
Tell that as well.
- Tell what?

1383
02:04:57,716 --> 02:05:00,048
About the conditions. They mustn't blame us.

1384
02:05:02,021 --> 02:05:06,822
There are some conditions if you want this
proposal.

1385
02:05:33,319 --> 02:05:35,052
It's been such a long time since I saw you.

1386
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:38,278
Brother, let's forgive and forget. Come.

1387
02:05:41,293 --> 02:05:48,032
I don't remember mentioning Chicago
Saktivel's name.

1388
02:05:48,033 --> 02:05:50,661
How does he know if you didn't mention it?

1389
02:05:52,671 --> 02:05:57,165
That character will appear too?
- Definitely.

1390
02:05:58,143 --> 02:06:01,613
I have more faith in you than yourself.

1391
02:06:01,614 --> 02:06:03,648
Let me tell you something..

1392
02:06:03,649 --> 02:06:06,985
There can only be One Chandramukhi,
One Anniyan..

1393
02:06:06,986 --> 02:06:10,979
One Enthiran, and One Emotional Ekambaram!

1394
02:06:30,309 --> 02:06:32,675
Welcome!
- Vanakkam Chinnamuthu Gounder.

1395
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:35,408
This is Washington Vetrivel.
- Vanakkam!

1396
02:06:35,681 --> 02:06:38,416
Vanakkam.
- He's Periamuthu Gounder, my brother.

1397
02:06:38,417 --> 02:06:41,011
He's like a God to all of us.

1398
02:06:42,021 --> 02:06:43,750
Who is he?

1399
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:48,993
I'm so sorry. He is my younger brother,
Chicago Saktivel.

1400
02:06:51,897 --> 02:06:53,194
Vanakkam.
- Vanakkam.

1401
02:06:55,134 --> 02:06:58,103
Dear, that's Emotional Ekambaram right?

1402
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:04,641
Yes, our Ekambaram. Have you forgotten?

1403
02:07:06,578 --> 02:07:09,172
He has lost some weight.
- Yes, he has.

1404
02:07:10,482 --> 02:07:12,313
How are you Eka?

1405
02:07:21,427 --> 02:07:26,126
Don't go so close. Move aside. Come in.

1406
02:07:32,071 --> 02:07:35,006
I'm very happy.
- Me too.

1407
02:07:35,074 --> 02:07:40,376
We will soon have very rich daughter-in-laws.

1408
02:07:42,648 --> 02:07:46,812
Money will come and go, the people are
more important.

1409
02:07:47,619 --> 02:07:52,022
This is why I wanted to forge ties with your
cultured family.

1410
02:07:56,862 --> 02:07:59,063
What do you do in you free time?

1411
02:07:59,064 --> 02:08:03,668
I wash clothes, clean the bathroom, sweep
the floor and..

1412
02:08:03,669 --> 02:08:06,194
...repeat the same thing in the evening.

1413
02:08:07,573 --> 02:08:09,165
That's the way it is in America.

1414
02:08:09,575 --> 02:08:13,102
No matter how rich you are, we do our
own chores.

1415
02:08:16,148 --> 02:08:20,016
Isn't that our culture.
- Money and culture are joining.

1416
02:08:25,991 --> 02:08:27,856
If you don't remove your legs..

1417
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:30,027
...I'll break it and send you to the hospital.

1418
02:08:30,028 --> 02:08:31,052
Shut up and eat.

1419
02:08:33,465 --> 02:08:37,367
Dad, she's so violent.
- Come here.

1420
02:08:38,036 --> 02:08:41,639
She's from overseas. Just ignore it..

1421
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:43,938
...we'll be getting a lot of money.

1422
02:08:44,276 --> 02:08:47,211
Bring the vegetables, it's over there.

1423
02:08:47,212 --> 02:08:48,474
Come, Mr Ekambaram.

1424
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:51,242
Where did you go? Come and join us.

1425
02:08:51,450 --> 02:08:53,179
Eka, wait there.

1426
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,652
You are too kind hearted.

1427
02:08:58,524 --> 02:09:00,858
They will easily cheat us if we are not alert.

1428
02:09:00,859 --> 02:09:04,762
Cows and dogs must be kept outside.

1429
02:09:04,763 --> 02:09:07,926
We only get respect when everything is in
it's own place.

1430
02:09:08,033 --> 02:09:15,033
It's not that, Eka's kind heart is
the reason we are together today.

1431
02:09:15,607 --> 02:09:19,304
So? We can't leave slippers
on our head, right?

1432
02:09:19,411 --> 02:09:24,382
You may eat after we are done.

1433
02:09:24,383 --> 02:09:27,852
Go! Go! if you see the rice...

1434
02:09:27,853 --> 02:09:30,981
Did you see? I created this..

1435
02:09:31,256 --> 02:09:35,293
...but they are both insulting me.
- Let it be.

1436
02:09:35,294 --> 02:09:38,855
Time will tell. You must not get angry.

1437
02:09:38,964 --> 02:09:42,365
Creators are human too.We have emotions.

1438
02:09:43,435 --> 02:09:44,129
Please don't.

1439
02:09:44,636 --> 02:09:47,264
The world won't survive if you become angry.

1440
02:09:54,847 --> 02:09:57,748
Come officer..join us.

1441
02:10:05,123 --> 02:10:07,325
How come you are here?

1442
02:10:07,326 --> 02:10:10,728
I'm here for a reason. What about you?

1443
02:10:10,729 --> 02:10:13,755
We came to discuss our children's wedding.

1444
02:10:13,866 --> 02:10:17,302
Periya Gounder, is it true?
- Yes.

1445
02:10:18,036 --> 02:10:19,094
Pour some sambar.

1446
02:10:19,504 --> 02:10:21,972
So your son is not marrying your niece?

1447
02:10:24,409 --> 02:10:28,045
Niece? Who is that?
- What Vetrivel?

1448
02:10:28,046 --> 02:10:33,575
Don't you know Padmanaban, a business
magnate in America.

1449
02:10:38,523 --> 02:10:41,321
He died in an accident right?

1450
02:10:41,426 --> 02:10:45,226
This is his daughter. Their niece.

1451
02:10:52,237 --> 02:10:57,903
She's so pretty, why propose elsewhere?

1452
02:10:59,878 --> 02:11:02,813
That's because marrying a relative may cause..

1453
02:11:02,881 --> 02:11:04,212
...birth defects. That's why.

1454
02:11:04,383 --> 02:11:09,082
Yes. isn't brother?
- Yes.

1455
02:11:13,091 --> 02:11:16,060
It is not good to arrange your son's wedding
while..

1456
02:11:16,461 --> 02:11:19,191
...you still have a young unmarried girl in
your care.

1457
02:11:20,732 --> 02:11:25,669
We know what to do for our niece.

1458
02:11:27,706 --> 02:11:34,407
If you don't mind, can I suggest something?
- Of course you can.

1459
02:11:36,548 --> 02:11:38,812
It won't be nice to send our daughters here
while..

1460
02:11:39,084 --> 02:11:42,781
...you have another
orphaned girl in your care.

1461
02:11:43,855 --> 02:11:46,016
Don't take it that way.

1462
02:11:46,959 --> 02:11:53,057
Firstly arrange her wedding, then our
children's.

1463
02:11:53,532 --> 02:11:55,967
How to suddenly arrange for a wedding?

1464
02:11:55,968 --> 02:11:58,198
Must find a suitable groom right?

1465
02:11:59,771 --> 02:12:03,969
It shouldn't take long.
Didn't we come all the..

1466
02:12:04,476 --> 02:12:07,604
...way from America and meet you?

1467
02:12:08,113 --> 02:12:09,478
We are in no hurry.

1468
02:12:10,048 --> 02:12:14,951
We'll search for a groom for Pooja together.

1469
02:12:15,721 --> 02:12:18,246
Is it ok?
- No..

1470
02:12:19,391 --> 02:12:22,053
Don't go against my boss because if he
gets angry..

1471
02:12:22,194 --> 02:12:26,028
...he'll cancel this wedding. Do as he says.

1472
02:12:31,703 --> 02:12:34,638
Around 20 bags are missing. Oh, they have
started eating.

1473
02:12:35,207 --> 02:12:37,869
Sir, come here. I need to speak to you.

1474
02:12:38,143 --> 02:12:41,374
Why did you touch me after touching the cow?

1475
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:42,447
Do you know who I am?

1476
02:12:42,614 --> 02:12:43,979
You are Eka right?
- That's before.

1477
02:12:44,082 --> 02:12:45,916
Now?
- Ekananda.

1478
02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:50,217
I'm not sure what to do with all my powers.
- No, you don't.

1479
02:12:53,492 --> 02:12:56,327
Shut up! What do you mean?

1480
02:12:56,328 --> 02:13:02,233
I can create a new world using my powers
if I wish.

1481
02:13:02,234 --> 02:13:03,258
Watch it now.

1482
02:13:06,905 --> 02:13:09,567
This is just a trailer.Want to see the
main picture?

1483
02:13:12,677 --> 02:13:15,212
Look here! You can't..

1484
02:13:15,213 --> 02:13:17,248
Why?
- You are so stupid.

1485
02:13:17,249 --> 02:13:18,580
You want to create a new world?

1486
02:13:18,683 --> 02:13:21,151
You'll stick against the wall if I hit you.

1487
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,410
Your dialogue is not in the script.

1488
02:13:23,522 --> 02:13:26,290
I'll hit you if you talk
about the script again.

1489
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:31,991
Is Thandabani your nephew?
- He's Siva, not Thandabani.

1490
02:13:32,664 --> 02:13:33,899
Is this in the script?
- No.

1491
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:38,063
Siva. I know everything about him.

1492
02:13:39,638 --> 02:13:43,802
Can you please tell me?
- I will.

1493
02:13:54,052 --> 02:14:00,548
Don't be heartbroken. Life is such.

1494
02:14:02,794 --> 02:14:04,853
Uncle, what are you doing here?

1495
02:14:04,896 --> 02:14:06,354
Washington Vetrivel is calling you?

1496
02:14:06,431 --> 02:14:08,126
Enough. He knows everything about you.

1497
02:14:13,305 --> 02:14:15,330
Who called me?
- Washington Vetrivel.

1498
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:19,001
Wash basin Vetrivel? Sickly looking Saktivel?

1499
02:14:19,077 --> 02:14:22,843
What's the woman's name? -Madam Lakshmi.
- What happened uncle?

1500
02:14:25,283 --> 02:14:26,944
Who's your uncle?
- You.

1501
02:14:27,018 --> 02:14:29,486
Am I your uncle? Am I a creator?

1502
02:14:29,588 --> 02:14:32,490
Am I Enthiran? Am I Anniyan?
Am I Chandramukhi?

1503
02:14:32,491 --> 02:14:34,015
I'll definitely kill you.

1504
02:14:36,128 --> 02:14:38,392
You don't become a murderer because of
his lies.

1505
02:14:38,497 --> 02:14:40,465
That's the right thing to do now because..

1506
02:14:41,266 --> 02:14:43,300
...I have to answer both the brothers.

1507
02:14:43,301 --> 02:14:47,067
You better leave before I kill you.

1508
02:14:48,306 --> 02:14:51,342
What happened uncle?
- Uncle?

1509
02:14:51,343 --> 02:14:56,076
Am I your uncle?

1510
02:14:56,414 --> 02:14:59,872
He has left.
- Is it?

1511
02:15:00,485 --> 02:15:02,853
Can you see me bleeding?
- No.

1512
02:15:02,854 --> 02:15:05,015
It's coming from here.

1513
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:09,059
Must not let him go easily!
- You have to be cautious.

1514
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:11,790
Because the brothers will kill you.

1515
02:15:14,966 --> 02:15:16,058
Why are you crying?

1516
02:15:17,369 --> 02:15:18,358
I can't hear.

1517
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:23,032
Everyone is cheating me.
- Don't cry.

1518
02:15:26,111 --> 02:15:28,136
Why are you still crying?

1519
02:15:28,246 --> 02:15:33,149
I can't bear the smell of your body.

1520
02:15:33,451 --> 02:15:36,887
When was the last you had a bath?
- Six months back.

1521
02:15:36,988 --> 02:15:39,616
Your body has expired.

1522
02:15:40,292 --> 02:15:42,351
Knowing that half their fortune will be gone..

1523
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:44,360
...who will want to marry her?

1524
02:15:44,496 --> 02:15:48,057
They won't agree if we don't get her married.

1525
02:15:48,733 --> 02:15:52,897
All our hard work will be wasted.

1526
02:15:54,105 --> 02:15:56,699
Come!
- We must kill him first.

1527
02:15:57,108 --> 02:15:59,633
What wrong did I do?

1528
02:16:00,045 --> 02:16:04,243
How to find a groom for Pooja immediately?

1529
02:16:04,349 --> 02:16:07,841
That's why I made a decision.
- What is it?

1530
02:16:07,953 --> 02:16:10,821
Why must we agree to their conditions?

1531
02:16:10,822 --> 02:16:15,816
Is it our fate? Why not marry her to one of
your sons..

1532
02:16:16,228 --> 02:16:18,219
...and make her your daughter in law?

1533
02:16:19,164 --> 02:16:22,327
Should we kill him?
- Do it.

1534
02:16:23,835 --> 02:16:25,029
Don't move.

1535
02:16:26,871 --> 02:16:28,634
You expect us to handover our money..

1536
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:33,374
...to the bank and become paupers?

1537
02:16:33,478 --> 02:16:37,346
Brother, he's useless. Call Siva.

1538
02:16:38,883 --> 02:16:42,182
Where is Siva?
- He has gone back.

1539
02:16:43,021 --> 02:16:46,286
Why send him back when there's chaos here?

1540
02:16:47,892 --> 02:16:52,261
His mother is looking for a bride for him.

1541
02:16:52,530 --> 02:16:57,024
That's why he has left.
- Proposal?

1542
02:16:59,137 --> 02:17:01,002
Brother, come here.

1543
02:17:05,443 --> 02:17:06,432
Understand?

1544
02:17:09,247 --> 02:17:11,010
Eka?
- Sir.

1545
02:17:11,283 --> 02:17:15,185
Does your nephew have any property?
- No.

1546
02:17:15,186 --> 02:17:17,652
He is full of debts. Sometimes they don't
have enough to eat.

1547
02:17:17,656 --> 02:17:20,591
He only has one underwear and uses it
every day.

1548
02:17:20,592 --> 02:17:23,152
He does not wear it on Sundays, like
both of you.

1549
02:17:24,829 --> 02:17:27,389
He's trapped.
- Sir?

1550
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:31,802
You don't have any sense.
- Why?

1551
02:17:31,803 --> 02:17:37,241
All our problems will be solved if we get
them married.

1552
02:17:37,242 --> 02:17:38,800
Sir!
- You called?

1553
02:17:42,681 --> 02:17:45,013
Vanakkam!
- Come!

1554
02:17:45,817 --> 02:17:47,885
He said you already left.

1555
02:17:47,886 --> 02:17:51,413
I came to inform you before I leave.

1556
02:17:53,625 --> 02:17:55,252
So much of respect.

1557
02:17:56,261 --> 02:17:59,992
Listen to me, you are part of our family now.

1558
02:18:00,365 --> 02:18:02,366
Why look for bride elsewhere?

1559
02:18:02,367 --> 02:18:09,367
We have decided to get our niece married
to you.

1560
02:18:11,343 --> 02:18:15,439
What do you think?
- What can I say?

1561
02:18:15,547 --> 02:18:18,209
I'm okay if my uncle is agreeable with it.

1562
02:18:21,052 --> 02:18:24,215
Uncle, please wipe your tears.
- I will.

1563
02:18:24,789 --> 02:18:27,553
This wedding shouldn't take place.
- Why?

1564
02:18:28,159 --> 02:18:30,923
I meant it won't take place.
- Why?

1565
02:18:31,396 --> 02:18:36,925
My sister is sentimental, she will not agree
to this marriage.

1566
02:18:37,502 --> 02:18:39,060
You struggle to make your ends meet..

1567
02:18:39,170 --> 02:18:41,400
...and you can afford to turn down this
proposal?

1568
02:18:41,706 --> 02:18:45,164
Shut up and do as we say. Else...

1569
02:18:45,810 --> 02:18:49,177
You keep quiet. Pooja, come here.

1570
02:18:52,617 --> 02:18:55,484
We have decided to get you married to Siva.

1571
02:18:55,587 --> 02:19:01,592
What do you say?
- Don't think too much.

1572
02:19:01,593 --> 02:19:05,825
You can both handle all the accounts after
marriage.

1573
02:19:05,930 --> 02:19:08,228
Haven't you done enough accounts together?

1574
02:19:10,068 --> 02:19:12,161
I'm okay with it.

1575
02:19:14,038 --> 02:19:15,027
You go in.

1576
02:19:17,776 --> 02:19:22,975
Sir, there's a small problem.
- What else?

1577
02:19:23,782 --> 02:19:26,717
It's true what my uncle said about my mum.

1578
02:19:27,285 --> 02:19:29,515
Santosh has been spreading news
that someone..

1579
02:19:30,221 --> 02:19:34,954
...kidnapped Pooja from the wedding
hall.

1580
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:38,620
My mum will be upset if she found out.

1581
02:19:39,597 --> 02:19:44,125
That's the problem? Bring Santosh here.

1582
02:19:49,441 --> 02:19:54,469
Who kidnapped Pooja from the wedding hall?

1583
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:55,711
How many times must I repeat?

1584
02:19:55,712 --> 02:19:57,078
I've even showed you his picture.

1585
02:19:58,983 --> 02:20:02,851
You are lying. He's the one who kidnapped
Pooja.

1586
02:20:05,590 --> 02:20:08,081
That's right. How did you find out?

1587
02:20:08,259 --> 02:20:10,659
He's the one. I'm the one who gave him a ride.

1588
02:20:11,062 --> 02:20:13,155
This is the truth.
- Yes.

1589
02:20:13,631 --> 02:20:16,828
Go and spread this news around.

1590
02:20:20,538 --> 02:20:23,405
Go! Go!

1591
02:20:24,876 --> 02:20:29,279
Are you happy now?
- My problem is solved.

1592
02:20:30,448 --> 02:20:32,109
Brother, come here.

1593
02:20:33,351 --> 02:20:34,682
I'm here uncle.

1594
02:20:38,523 --> 02:20:42,289
What's happening here? I'm very confused.

1595
02:20:43,528 --> 02:20:48,832
It's my story, but there are many unknown
twists.

1596
02:20:48,833 --> 02:20:51,063
What is the climax?
- I don't know.

1597
02:20:51,336 --> 02:20:53,170
I know.
- What?

1598
02:20:53,171 --> 02:20:54,872
Death.
- Whose?

1599
02:20:54,873 --> 02:20:56,033
Yours!

1600
02:20:58,877 --> 02:21:01,471
Very good. Who's the groom?
- He's the groom.

1601
02:21:01,579 --> 02:21:03,137
Siva?
- Yes!

1602
02:21:03,515 --> 02:21:05,005
He is Eka's nephew.

1603
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:09,747
Eka has worked so long for us.

1604
02:21:10,121 --> 02:21:14,080
For his loyalty...
- You can reward my loyalty by a pay rise.

1605
02:21:14,192 --> 02:21:17,753
Don't ruin her life by getting her married to
him.

1606
02:21:19,531 --> 02:21:23,627
Let it be. My mum will never agree to this
wedding.

1607
02:21:24,035 --> 02:21:27,835
And my uncle does not agree to this
proposal either.

1608
02:21:28,206 --> 02:21:30,606
I don't wish to proceed with this wedding.

1609
02:21:31,276 --> 02:21:33,676
Siva, I understand your feelings.

1610
02:21:34,479 --> 02:21:36,174
Mr Eka.
- What?

1611
02:21:36,447 --> 02:21:40,907
If Siva marries Pooja,
how is he related to us?

1612
02:21:41,319 --> 02:21:42,581
Grandfather!

1613
02:21:43,454 --> 02:21:46,582
You don't even know? He's like your son.

1614
02:21:48,126 --> 02:21:54,326
Siva has been loyal to us just as how Eka
is to you.

1615
02:21:54,432 --> 02:21:59,736
So, we'll personally conduct his wedding.
Is that okay?

1616
02:21:59,737 --> 02:22:05,004
I'm very happy.
- I have a doubt.

1617
02:22:05,209 --> 02:22:08,378
Your doubt is valid.We'll immediately cancel
this wedding.

1618
02:22:08,379 --> 02:22:11,415
Start the car and we shall leave.
- Shut up.

1619
02:22:11,416 --> 02:22:14,044
You'll end up outside if I kick you.

1620
02:22:16,254 --> 02:22:20,190
Will he be given any share of your fortune?

1621
02:22:21,092 --> 02:22:26,830
Don't have any doubts. Our son-in-laws will
inherit everything.

1622
02:22:26,831 --> 02:22:28,498
Am I right brother?
- Yes.

1623
02:22:28,499 --> 02:22:34,028
Is your doubt cleared?
- Everything is clear now.

1624
02:22:34,505 --> 02:22:38,839
Brother, what's next?
- Next is the wedding.

1625
02:22:40,645 --> 02:22:44,172
What happened?
- You hit me.

1626
02:27:21,592 --> 02:27:23,423
The joker is mine.

1627
02:27:24,028 --> 02:27:27,862
Sir.
- Come Velu.

1628
02:27:28,065 --> 02:27:31,057
Have you recovered? No problems right?

1629
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:40,072
Why are you shouting?
- He's the one who kidnapped Pooja.

1630
02:27:44,982 --> 02:27:46,040
It's true.

1631
02:27:50,855 --> 02:27:53,653
Siva, come here.

1632
02:27:58,029 --> 02:27:59,087
Is what he's saying true?

1633
02:28:00,364 --> 02:28:02,332
You are the one who asked to spread the story.

1634
02:28:02,867 --> 02:28:04,926
Why are you pretending?

1635
02:28:13,411 --> 02:28:16,608
Tell them who kidnapped Pooja?

1636
02:28:19,951 --> 02:28:20,781
He's the one.

1637
02:28:25,189 --> 02:28:26,850
Did I do as you said?

1638
02:28:29,860 --> 02:28:31,623
Is it?
- Yes.

1639
02:28:37,268 --> 02:28:38,599
Didn't you give them a ride?

1640
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:42,739
I know everything. Be quiet.

1641
02:28:43,274 --> 02:28:47,005
What is he saying?
- Nothing.

1642
02:28:47,778 --> 02:28:51,874
He's blabbering because he suffered a
head injury.

1643
02:28:53,451 --> 02:28:55,214
I don't understand what's happening here.

1644
02:28:55,653 --> 02:28:58,054
We ourselves don't understand what's
going on..

1645
02:28:58,055 --> 02:29:00,419
...you just came out from a coma, how will
you understand?

1646
02:29:00,591 --> 02:29:03,992
Velu, please calm down.

1647
02:29:04,261 --> 02:29:06,559
Go home and take some rest.

1648
02:29:07,932 --> 02:29:10,767
Sir..
- I asked you to leave.

1649
02:29:10,768 --> 02:29:11,826
It's nothing.

1650
02:29:11,969 --> 02:29:15,029
Come brother. Let's continue playing.

1651
02:29:30,621 --> 02:29:33,454
Your whole family is
trying to unite your love.

1652
02:29:33,591 --> 02:29:37,027
I like that. I want everyone to be happy.

1653
02:29:39,030 --> 02:29:40,122
I'm coming.

1654
02:29:51,776 --> 02:29:55,872
It's like a festival here
ever since you arrived.

1655
02:29:56,247 --> 02:30:00,741
To be frank, we only wanted your money
initially.

1656
02:30:01,385 --> 02:30:05,549
But, after getting to know your family..

1657
02:30:06,190 --> 02:30:10,060
...we noticed our attitude has changed.
- It's true.

1658
02:30:10,061 --> 02:30:14,157
I'm very happy to hear this.

1659
02:30:14,632 --> 02:30:15,533
Ln-law?
- Yes.

1660
02:30:15,534 --> 02:30:18,229
We must be like this forever.
- Okay.

1661
02:30:20,471 --> 02:30:24,168
It's getting late. Shall we eat?

1662
02:30:27,044 --> 02:30:29,512
One more round. Do you want one?

1663
02:30:34,151 --> 02:30:35,880
Aunty, call for you.

1664
02:30:38,656 --> 02:30:42,217
Lakshmi, have you eaten?
- Not yet.

1665
02:30:42,526 --> 02:30:46,121
Why? it's already 10 pm and you've not
eaten?

1666
02:30:47,331 --> 02:30:50,459
You must eat on time because of your acidic
problem.

1667
02:30:50,734 --> 02:30:52,031
Ok I will.

1668
02:30:54,371 --> 02:30:56,532
Lakshmi?
- Yes.

1669
02:31:06,684 --> 02:31:07,651
Pass me that saree.

1670
02:31:10,688 --> 02:31:17,688
Look at him, he's so in love with his wife.

1671
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:23,489
What's all this? We don't practice this.

1672
02:31:23,868 --> 02:31:30,868
They must only eat after we have eaten,
else...

1673
02:31:32,309 --> 02:31:35,369
You are right.
- It is wrong.

1674
02:31:35,846 --> 02:31:38,246
A woman's world is very small.

1675
02:31:38,716 --> 02:31:43,619
They are tied to their home and their family.

1676
02:31:43,721 --> 02:31:47,088
It's our responsibility to take care of them.

1677
02:31:52,263 --> 02:31:54,060
Okay, let's go for dinner.

1678
02:31:54,765 --> 02:31:58,132
Can you give me a minute? I...

1679
02:32:08,445 --> 02:32:10,276
Hello.
- Sister-in-law?

1680
02:32:10,381 --> 02:32:13,009
It's me, your brother-in-law.

1681
02:32:13,517 --> 02:32:17,647
I want to speak to my wife, please pass
it to her.

1682
02:32:17,788 --> 02:32:19,449
I like it.
- It's nice right?

1683
02:32:20,524 --> 02:32:26,485
Your husband wants to talk.
- With me? I'm frightened!

1684
02:32:27,097 --> 02:32:28,064
Speak.
- I'm scared.

1685
02:32:28,332 --> 02:32:30,823
Why are you scared? Just speak.

1686
02:32:33,470 --> 02:32:38,203
Yes dear?
- Meenakshi, have you eaten?

1687
02:32:40,711 --> 02:32:44,408
How to eat before you?
- Crazy woman.

1688
02:32:45,149 --> 02:32:48,414
You'll get 'acinity' if you don't eat on time.

1689
02:32:48,819 --> 02:32:53,688
What is 'acinity'?
- Silly. You know nothing.

1690
02:32:55,659 --> 02:32:57,251
Okay! Okay!

1691
02:32:58,929 --> 02:33:00,396
I love you!
- Oh my God!

1692
02:33:04,201 --> 02:33:11,201
Say 'me too'.
- Me too!

1693
02:33:15,179 --> 02:33:17,044
'Me too'? What's that?

1694
02:33:20,651 --> 02:33:22,919
What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

1695
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:27,550
Nothing? Pass the phone to me.
- You too...

1696
02:33:35,699 --> 02:33:38,167
Hello.
- Yes uncle.

1697
02:33:39,303 --> 02:33:43,205
Pass the phone to your aunty.
- Eldest uncle.

1698
02:33:45,876 --> 02:33:49,710
Aunty, call for you. it's uncle. Talk.

1699
02:33:52,416 --> 02:33:56,318
Hello.
- Sivagami, it's me.

1700
02:33:59,490 --> 02:34:03,756
Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

1701
02:34:04,361 --> 02:34:06,659
Eat early, else...

1702
02:34:08,032 --> 02:34:12,128
...you'll get 'enemity'.
- I'll go now.

1703
02:34:13,237 --> 02:34:20,237
Sivagami..I love you.
- Me too.

1704
02:34:33,457 --> 02:34:34,947
Village girl.

1705
02:34:41,031 --> 02:34:43,466
Enough aunty.
- Just a little bit more.

1706
02:34:43,467 --> 02:34:44,434
Eat dear.

1707
02:34:44,902 --> 02:34:48,360
We don't know when you will eat our cooking
next?

1708
02:34:52,409 --> 02:34:57,437
Don't forget us once you are married.

1709
02:34:58,415 --> 02:35:02,112
Aunty, you are everything for me.

1710
02:35:05,823 --> 02:35:08,519
Hi aunty.
- What are you doing here?

1711
02:35:09,259 --> 02:35:13,830
Nothing. My aunty ask to pass this necklace
to her.

1712
02:35:13,831 --> 02:35:17,028
You could have passed it to someone else.

1713
02:35:17,201 --> 02:35:19,066
He needs a reason to see the bride.

1714
02:35:20,037 --> 02:35:23,564
When are you going to get ready?

1715
02:35:24,875 --> 02:35:27,605
We'll bring her to the wedding hall. You
leave now.

1716
02:35:30,514 --> 02:35:33,005
Have you passed the jewellery?
- Yes.

1717
02:35:36,487 --> 02:35:38,978
What are Washington Vetrivel and Chicago
Saktivel doing?

1718
02:35:39,123 --> 02:35:42,650
They are very busy.
- Tell them not to over act.

1719
02:35:48,098 --> 02:35:50,191
I'll be there. You be careful.

1720
02:35:52,936 --> 02:35:55,234
Do you know which wedding hall?

1721
02:35:55,639 --> 02:35:57,541
Don't mistakenly go to RS wedding hall.

1722
02:35:57,542 --> 02:36:00,443
I'll never go there again.
It all started there.

1723
02:36:00,444 --> 02:36:02,708
You wouldn't have met Pooja then.

1724
02:36:13,424 --> 02:36:15,585
You came to our place and fooled us.

1725
02:36:15,659 --> 02:36:18,594
No one in your family will survive.

1726
02:36:21,265 --> 02:36:22,732
Take Pooja to the wedding hall.

1727
02:36:22,966 --> 02:36:24,058
I'll be there on time.

1728
02:38:43,674 --> 02:38:45,198
Friend, superb.

1729
02:39:40,364 --> 02:39:42,889
Bring the bride, must leave before the good
time is over.

1730
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:44,533
I'll ask her to come.

1731
02:39:53,677 --> 02:39:57,875
She reminds me of our sister.

1732
02:40:00,684 --> 02:40:03,482
Looks like she is walking and coming.

1733
02:40:04,288 --> 02:40:09,920
I feel we lost her because of our greed.

1734
02:40:10,193 --> 02:40:13,287
Don't know if she will be comfortable in her
new home.

1735
02:40:14,298 --> 02:40:18,894
We must frequently send
50 bags of rice to her.

1736
02:40:19,369 --> 02:40:24,830
Don't worry.We'll take care of her as our
own daughter.

1737
02:40:25,776 --> 02:40:32,579
I'll kill Eka if she sheds any tears.
- Ok brother.

1738
02:40:36,820 --> 02:40:40,756
Dear, don't be sad because you are leaving us.

1739
02:40:41,425 --> 02:40:45,794
Just call us if you need anything.

1740
02:40:46,296 --> 02:40:48,924
Forgive me if I had done anything wrong.

1741
02:40:50,233 --> 02:40:52,167
You didn't do anything wrong.

1742
02:40:52,636 --> 02:40:56,538
My sister's daughter will never make mistakes.

1743
02:40:57,841 --> 02:41:02,141
Don't cry dear. I feel upset.

1744
02:41:02,646 --> 02:41:05,615
You are the goddess of this house.

1745
02:41:06,583 --> 02:41:11,287
You must make us proud.

1746
02:41:11,288 --> 02:41:14,746
Let's go, everyone is waiting.
- Come.

1747
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:26,228
Close the gate. No one must leave this place.

1748
02:41:34,411 --> 02:41:36,946
Thangarasu, what happened to you?

1749
02:41:36,947 --> 02:41:39,780
They have made a fool of us.

1750
02:41:41,785 --> 02:41:44,754
He's the one who kidnapped Pooja the
other day.

1751
02:41:45,489 --> 02:41:48,390
He is the one who hit our Velu.

1752
02:41:50,994 --> 02:41:53,485
He did everything and is pretending innocence
now.

1753
02:41:53,764 --> 02:41:54,958
We must kill him.

1754
02:42:00,170 --> 02:42:01,501
Is it true?

1755
02:42:03,940 --> 02:42:05,134
Answer me.

1756
02:42:07,978 --> 02:42:11,141
Yes.
- Why did you do it?

1757
02:42:13,283 --> 02:42:15,274
I didn't want to elope with Pooja.

1758
02:42:15,686 --> 02:42:18,280
I wanted to marry and take her with me.

1759
02:42:20,691 --> 02:42:23,819
It was her mother's wish to marry with your
consent.

1760
02:42:24,361 --> 02:42:28,764
My family wished to welcome her with your
approval.

1761
02:42:29,533 --> 02:42:31,262
For all these to happen...

1762
02:42:31,468 --> 02:42:34,203
Stop talking. Leave him to me.

1763
02:42:34,204 --> 02:42:35,262
Let me go!
- No.

1764
02:42:35,338 --> 02:42:36,168
Let me go.
- No.

1765
02:42:36,273 --> 02:42:37,535
Let me go.
- No.

1766
02:42:38,008 --> 02:42:39,305
No. Listen to me.

1767
02:42:40,777 --> 02:42:43,109
Thangarasu, let him go.

1768
02:42:49,553 --> 02:42:51,145
I'll kill you.

1769
02:42:51,421 --> 02:42:52,547
How dare you push him?

1770
02:42:53,557 --> 02:42:54,717
He's my brother.

1771
02:43:02,032 --> 02:43:03,366
They are the ones who wronged us.

1772
02:43:03,367 --> 02:43:04,890
Why are we fighting among us?

1773
02:43:06,703 --> 02:43:12,608
He didn't betray us. He turned us into humans.

1774
02:43:14,845 --> 02:43:20,549
We used to fight each other all the time,
but today...

1775
02:43:20,550 --> 02:43:25,647
...he couldn't accept it
when his son pushed me.

1776
02:43:26,356 --> 02:43:32,488
Do you remember when was the last time
we were together?

1777
02:43:34,531 --> 02:43:39,264
Have we ever respected our wives?

1778
02:43:41,805 --> 02:43:47,334
He respected his wife's
wish and did all these.

1779
02:43:48,011 --> 02:43:50,707
How can we accuse him of betraying us?

1780
02:43:52,582 --> 02:43:54,750
Those who know how to respect a woman..

1781
02:43:54,751 --> 02:43:57,686
...will definitely be born to a good mother.

1782
02:43:59,189 --> 02:44:04,388
They left everything and came here for him.

1783
02:44:05,462 --> 02:44:07,726
If we still can't understand them...

1784
02:44:07,831 --> 02:44:11,232
...we are not humans.
- Why brother?

1785
02:44:11,935 --> 02:44:17,669
I'm happy to send Pooja to their family.

1786
02:44:20,911 --> 02:44:21,935
Come here.

1787
02:44:22,746 --> 02:44:26,307
Yes you, come.

1788
02:44:41,331 --> 02:44:45,131
It was not our intention to fool you.

1789
02:44:45,535 --> 02:44:50,339
We agreed to this because his intentions
were good.

1790
02:44:50,340 --> 02:44:55,437
But still, what we did was wrong. Please
forgive us.

1791
02:44:56,012 --> 02:44:59,743
We can't forgive him.

1792
02:45:02,352 --> 02:45:07,449
Because our daughter is married to your son.

1793
02:45:11,962 --> 02:45:15,125
But, we'll feel lonely after you leave.

1794
02:45:15,498 --> 02:45:18,194
I can't take it. So...

1795
02:45:18,568 --> 02:45:22,972
...if you don't mind, can
we follow our daughter.

1796
02:45:22,973 --> 02:45:27,535
...to your house and stay for two days?

1797
02:45:27,644 --> 02:45:31,341
You can even stay for two months, but...

1798
02:45:31,648 --> 02:45:33,583
...where's your wife? Please come here.

1799
02:45:33,584 --> 02:45:36,143
- You'll bring her along right?
- Why?

1800
02:45:36,253 --> 02:45:39,154
Because we have 'murungaka' curry everyday.

1801
02:45:39,155 --> 02:45:41,623
You'll suffer if you come alone.

1802
02:45:43,693 --> 02:45:45,761
Siva, what do you say?

1803
02:45:45,762 --> 02:45:49,823
I'm not sure. My uncle must receive an
sms first.

1804
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:51,458
Only then we can tell.

1805
02:45:51,483 --> 02:45:55,483
