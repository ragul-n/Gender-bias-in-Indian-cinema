1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500


3
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,416
Read it.

4
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:58,041
Don't stare at it. Read it.

5
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:03,458
'I sing this song because you asked me to.'

6
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,291
Go on. - Yes, sir.

7
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:11,875
I'll entertain you wholeheartedly.

8
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,041
Who? - I mean, the thing is..

9
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,625
Tell me, Mr. Sharma..

10
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,708
..this is what you do with the files? Write poems?

11
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,708
Arun, your son, did this.

12
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,583
Arun. - Yes. - Where is he?

13
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,083
Arun doesn't come to work at the same time every day.

14
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,333
At times he comes early and leaves early.

15
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,458
He hasn't come to the office in the last two days.

16
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:38,958
What? - Yes.

17
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:43,083
Sharma, this is an office, not some place..

18
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,666
..where one can come and go at they please. Got it? - Yes.

19
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,458
You may go. - Sir.

20
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:53,083
I mean this, file..

21
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,583
Fool.

22
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:01,125
Yes? - Did you take your afternoon dose?

23
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:06,041
Sushma, you're worried about my medication..

24
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,458
..but it's your son that drives me up the wall.

25
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,375
Why? Has something happened again?

26
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,791
He hasn't been to the office in the last two days.

27
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,750
I'm fed up with him.

28
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,083
I'm being dragged unnecessarily..

29
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,708
..into a skirmish between the two of you.

30
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,541
What's it, ma'am? - What else?

31
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,958
Your arguments are centred around business and money..

32
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,958
..and the your son can't stop talking about music.

33
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:45,625
'I sing this song..'

34
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:51,458
'..because you asked me to.'

35
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:57,041
'I sing this song..'

36
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:08,625
'I'll entertain you wholeheartedly.'

37
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,625
'Because you asked me to..'

38
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,083
Poet. Where are you lost?

39
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,375
Like the tune?

40
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:31,916
Excellent. - Really?

41
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:37,208
Yes, Arun. When you sing my songs..

42
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,166
..I feel my inanimate verses have come to life.

43
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,000
Absolutely wrong.

44
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,833
Your compositions are..

45
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,208
..so good that the tunes flow spontaneously.

46
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,875
I don't agree. - Why not?

47
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,208
Same old debate. - It's not a debate, but the truth.

48
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,083
The truth is that Shrikant's songs..

49
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,375
..have made you a star.

50
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,541
Absolutely right. - But your dad doesn't know about that.

51
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,958
Oh, God. Aunt, do you know..

52
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,500
..when dad first learnt about my singing..

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,375
..he made such a fuss about it?

54
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,583
To avoid the publicity..

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,625
..I changed my name to Sanjay at the radio station.

56
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,000
I wanted to remain anonymous. - Very good.

57
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,458
Go to the radio station, Arun. Look at what time it is.

58
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,375
Oh, God. Five minutes to 6:00.

59
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,583
I have a live show on the radio in five minutes.

60
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,041
Have some tea before you go.

61
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,500
If I wait for tea, Saxena will spare me.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,291
He always complains about my tardiness.

63
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,500
Has Sanjay come? - Not yet, sir.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,625
Sanjay always puts me in a spot.

65
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,208
He's always late. Give me a glass of water.

66
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,208
Should I cancel Sanjay's programme? - Yes.

67
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,750
Sir, can I sing in his place?

68
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,125
Will you? - If you give me a chance..

69
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,625
..I'll be indebted to you.

70
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,166
Okay. Go ahead. Make the announcement.

71
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,041
Thanks.

72
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,083
This is All India Radio, Lucknow.

73
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:59,000
We regret our inability to relay Sanjay's song today.

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,208
In his place, a new artist..

75
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,208
..Mahe Lucknowi, will sing for you.

76
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,291
Oh, you.

77
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,458
Music lovers, I apologise for being late.

78
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,125
Before coming here I was with Shrikant.

79
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,208
Shrikant thinks people love his songs..

80
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,833
..because I sing them well.

81
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,333
Actually, it's his lyrics that are beautiful.

82
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,625
Anyway, let me sing you Shrikant's song.

83
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,625
You decide yourself.

84
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:14,375
'I sing this song because you asked me to.'

85
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:28,375
'I sing this song because you asked me to.'

86
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:37,833
'I will entertain you wholeheartedly.'

87
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,833
'Because you asked me to..'

88
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:10,333
"Don't ask me why this poet moans others' sorrows."

89
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:20,000
"Don't ask me why this poet moans others' sorrows."

90
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:29,458
"Someone gets hurt and someone else feels the pain."

91
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:39,125
"When a heart breaks far away, I writhe in pain."

92
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:48,416
'I sing this song because you asked me to.'

93
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,416
"I sing this song.."

94
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:23,083
"The one whom I'm praising.."

95
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:32,666
"..is a beauty, a lovely aroma."

96
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:37,291
"It's not what you think."

97
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:42,541
"It's the magic of the melodies."

98
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:51,958
"With the music of nature, I arouse passion in hearts."

99
00:08:52,458 --> 00:09:01,333
"On your request, I sing this song."

100
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,333
"I sing this song."

101
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:33,708
"How are the bonds formed that follow me around?"

102
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:43,458
"How are the bonds formed that follow me around?"

103
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:53,416
"Shall I tell you how people pop into my mind?"

104
00:09:53,916 --> 00:10:02,708
"From rosy lips I steal colours."

105
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:12,083
"I sing this song because you asked me to."

106
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,833
"I sing this song.."

107
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:26,291
"I will entertain you wholeheartedly."

108
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:30,291
"Because you asked me to.."

109
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,541
Oh, my God. You are simply great.

110
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,208
I'm proud of you. - Thanks, sir.

111
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,083
What a song. Come with me. - Where?

112
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,833
Come with me.

113
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,625
Come on. Take a seat.

114
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:52,958
Thank you, sir.

115
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,041
Late comer. I like everything about you..

116
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,750
..except for your tardiness.

117
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,416
Sir, I'm very, very sorry.

118
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,083
Last chance.

119
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,208
Henceforth, you won't complain.

120
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,500
Of course I won't. - Why?

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,958
I've been transferred. I'm going to Calcutta.

122
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,375
How sad. - Sit down.

123
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,500
Yes.

124
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,916
It sucks.

125
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:20,500
I will be far away from both you and Lucknow.

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
I'm helpless.

127
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,250
If you come to Calcutta, stop by for sure.

128
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,958
Of course. I will.

129
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,500
Next month I'll be there for my song recording.

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,458
Really? I'll teach you a lesson..

131
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,125
..if you don't meet me when you're in Calcutta.

132
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,666
Impossible. We'll meet for sure.

133
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,916
Any orders for me, sir?

134
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,916
Send me your new songs. - Sure. It's a promise.

135
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,708
May I leave?

136
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:51,500
You latecomer, in spite of it, I love you. - I love you too.

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I wish you all the best for Calcutta.

138
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,041
Bye. All the best. Good luck.

139
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,208
Bye.

140
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,208
Good. - Sit here with your mouth open.

141
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,125
Why? - I want to look at the throat that drives people crazy.

142
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,541
It's not me. The melody is hidden in the lyrics.

143
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,666
I can't argue with you.

144
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:15,250
Then don't. Here are your medicines and fruits.

145
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,500
You're coughing.

146
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,666
Bing him a glass of water.

147
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,416
I keep telling you to consult..

148
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:22,625
..a well-known doctor, but you don't listen.

149
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,541
I'm tired of telling him the same thing. Please try convincing him.

150
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,666
How can I? He never listens to me.

151
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,166
You'll come with me tomorrow. - What's wrong with me?

152
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,541
It's just a cough. I'll be fine in a day or two.

153
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,708
I've been listening to this for the last one year.

154
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,375
Shrikant, I can't let you neglect it.

155
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,916
You don't know how precious your life is to me.

156
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,875
I won't let it slip away this easily.

157
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,125
You're talking as if I'm going to die.

158
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,416
Will you listen to that? - He is crazy.

159
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,500
Promise me you'll consult a well-known doctor tomorrow.

160
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,166
You'll get proper treatment.

161
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:00,083
Promise me? - Okay. I promise.

162
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,125
Look. He's really a nice boy, aunt.

163
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,875
He is just like you. - Is it?

164
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,458
Let's celebrate it with a feast.

165
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,125
Your servant came here twice. Your mother must be waiting.

166
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,791
Really? - Go home.

167
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,041
Okay.

168
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,416
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

169
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,208
This boy drives me crazy.

170
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,791
Madam, junior master has come. - Really?

171
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,583
What should I do? - Mom.

172
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,083
Mom.

173
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:30,583
Tell him not to talk to me, Puran Singh. - Okay.

174
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,250
Madam is very angry today.

175
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,375
I see. So you're angry with me.

176
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,291
I told you not to talk to me. - What's wrong?

177
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,958
Why did you miss office? - I had to sing on the radio.

178
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,750
In the evening, not morning.

179
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,458
Your dad kept calling the whole day to ask for you.

180
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,666
You know dad better.

181
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,458
When everything goes smoothly, he doesn't like it.

182
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,250
He makes a mountain out of a mole hill to harass us.

183
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,833
It's his old habit.

184
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,833
And your habit is to take everything lightly.

185
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,541
Let it be. I'm hungry since morning.

186
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,125
Hungry since morning. - Yes.

187
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,458
Puran Singh. - Puran Singh.

188
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,041
Serve food for Arun quickly.

189
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,875
Serve food for Arun quickly. - Okay.

190
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,916
Harass me all you want, son.

191
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,791
You'll realise when I'm no more.

192
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,791
Don't say that, my dear mom.

193
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,166
I erred. Please forgive me.

194
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,000
I beg of you.

195
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
You always convince me. - No.

196
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,958
Go and change quickly. - Why?

197
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,208
Don't you want to eat?

198
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:35,666
Yes, of course.

199
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,666
Come quickly, Arun. The food is served.

200
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,375
Mom, you're amazing. You've cooked so many dishes.

201
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,791
You're great. That's like my mom. I'm pleased.

202
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,666
You're great. - Okay. Don't babble now.

203
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,125
Eat quietly.

204
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,500
Why quietly?

205
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,416
I said keep your mouth shut.

206
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,750
Start eating. - Surprising.

207
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,625
First, it's "shut up." Then "eat."

208
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,083
How can I eat with the mouth shut?

209
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,750
Naughty. Eat now.

210
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,333
Have you been to Shri's house? - Yes.

211
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,750
How is he now?

212
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,250
He's fine, but the cough is persisting.

213
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,958
It's God's wish. I heard his song today.

214
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,500
He writes great songs.

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,625
He looks like me..

216
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,875
..but he's far more matured than me.

217
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,416
He's unwell now. Once he's fit..

218
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,166
..we'll do wonders in the field of music.

219
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,666
Sure. - Thank you.

220
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,458
But I have one request. - What?

221
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,458
I'll soon bring a bride for you.

222
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,500
Who is she? - A princess.

223
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,500
It won't be right to bring a princess.

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,083
They seem beautiful from afar. No.

225
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,875
You fool. I've got a letter today.

226
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,250
They've sent the girl's photo.

227
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,666
I don't want to see it as I don't want to marry.

228
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,958
Why not? - Amazing.

229
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,000
Madam, sir has come.

230
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,541
Oh my God. - Finish your meal quietly.

231
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,541
And keep quiet even if he shouts.

232
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,250
I see. You've come.

233
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,625
Where were you all day? - Let him eat first.

234
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:19,666
What important work kept you away from office today?

235
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,083
There was a party at my friend's house.

236
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,541
Party or your song on the radio?

237
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,083
I warned you not to sing.

238
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,708
Times have changed, Dad.

239
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,458
Your views about music are wrong.

240
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,291
Will you teach me right and wrong?

241
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,625
Women at brothels sing.

242
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,666
Loafers sing, not gentlemen. Got it?

243
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,291
Why are you making an issue out of it?

244
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,083
You keep quiet.

245
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,750
Can I ask you who is ill at home?

246
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,375
- Sick ? - Yes, sick.

247
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:57,458
For whom you have bought the medicines from the drugstore?

248
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,416
For Shrikant. - I know it.

249
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,791
Shrikant is spoiling you.

250
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,083
He's useless and has even rendered you incapable.

251
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:12,875
Henceforth you'll not spend a single penny on him. - No.

252
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:18,041
Your millions of rupees are just rotting in the bank.

253
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,708
What's wrong if some of it is spent for a good cause?

254
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,166
A good cause.

255
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,500
If you're really interested in doing a good deed..

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,291
..do it with the money you earn.

257
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,708
What? - Yes.

258
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,541
When you earn money..

259
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,333
..you'll realise the importance of money.

260
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,750
On another's money.. - Other's money?

261
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,083
Are you a stranger for me?

262
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,875
Arun. - Have I no right to anything?

263
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,291
Not at all. - Oh my God.

264
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,083
Why can't you.. - Keep quiet.

265
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,083
Do you know that the valuable clothes you wear..

266
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,125
..the car in which you travel..

267
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,000
..the bungalow in which you stay..

268
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
..are due to my hard-earned money?

269
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,875
I've made it. I'm a self-made man.

270
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,041
You're known because of me. Got it?

271
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,458
I understood.

272
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,291
No, Arun. Don't mind.. - No, Mom. Dad is right.

273
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,083
Yes. I'm right.

274
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,333
What happened to you today?

275
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,750
Arun, this house belongs to you. - No, Mom.

276
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,041
This is just a prison and I'm a prisoner.

277
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:18,541
A prisoner who can suffer, but can't voice his feelings.

278
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,458
Think what you'd like.

279
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,750
When society comes to know that my son is a singer..

280
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,750
..it'll be disgraceful for me.

281
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,875
I hate the very thought of it.

282
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,083
No. If you want to stay in this house..

283
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,916
..you'll have to look after my business.

284
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,541
You have to quit singing..

285
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,958
..and meeting people like Shrikant.

286
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,625
Then here's my reply.

287
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,416
I can leave neither music nor my friend.

288
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:43,833
Arun, listen to me.

289
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,291
No, Mom. I'm leaving.

290
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,958
I can bear my insults, but not that of music and my friend.

291
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,000
Stop him. What if he really leaves the house?

292
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,541
If he's leaving, then let him.

293
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,833
What're you saying? Reason with him.

294
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,541
He's not a fool for me to reason with him.

295
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,750
Listen to me, Arun. Don't be so adamant, son.

296
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,208
Listen.

297
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,750
Arun, don't leave the house.

298
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,541
Bless me, Mom.

299
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,833
Arun, stop. Wait, Arun.

300
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,416
Stop, Arun.

301
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,583
Before leaving, listen to me.

302
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,291
Yes? - It's easy to talk about idealism..

303
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,500
..while living in luxury.

304
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,625
But once outside the bungalow..

305
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,041
..even while facing minor problems..

306
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,583
..a man has to endure unbearable pain.

307
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,041
Don't worry about it.

308
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,791
I'll return only after succeeding.

309
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:44,166
Nobody will ever know the radio singer, Sanjay, is your son.

310
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:50,083
Now people will recognise me by my name, not yours.

311
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:54,083
Arun.

312
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,875
No, Aurn. It wasn't right.

313
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:07,791
Why not? I'll be a free bird from today.

314
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,583
No house, no parental restraints.

315
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,166
Nobody to ask me where I go.

316
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,166
I don't like it, Arun.

317
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,000
I advise you to return home.

318
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,750
Aunt, you are like my mother.

319
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,125
You get scared of even trivial matters. - Mom's right.

320
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,291
What right?

321
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:26,416
Your dad, though strict, really loves you. - Okay.

322
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:31,958
Ask those who don't have a father.

323
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,250
Maybe you're right.

324
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,041
But I'm leaving for Calcutta tonight.

325
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,833
Calcutta. - Why?

326
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,333
If I stay here, mom will force me to return home.

327
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,458
And I won't be able to refuse.

328
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,583
In this city, if I don't stay with my parents, others will gossip.

329
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,625
It's better to leave this city.

330
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,958
Bhishan Singh and Saxena are in Calcutta.

331
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,875
They'll help me. - But son..

332
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:58,375
Stop arguing and get a cup of hot tea. - Okay.

333
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,083
That's more like it.

334
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:07,916
Listen, I have Rs.2,000.

335
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,791
You keep 1500. I'll keep Rs.500.

336
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,000
No, Arun.

337
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,875
Whenever I take your money, my conscience pricks me.

338
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:24,333
Fool. Your conscience is nothing but your self-respect.

339
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,666
I'm not giving you charity.

340
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,125
You don't get it. Your songs are the soul of my music.

341
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,083
And I can do anything for my music.

342
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,208
You liar. - You're lying.

343
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,791
Forget it. I won't take this money.

344
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,500
You have to.

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,458
We're partners in this business. Take this.

346
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,166
That's it.

347
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,000
Friends like you are found in stories..

348
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,625
..not in real life.

349
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,250
Don't crack jokes.

350
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,458
I don't know anything. Before I leave this city..

351
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:54,916
..you have to accept three conditions.

352
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,166
Tell me. - First, you'll go to the doctor daily.

353
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,125
Okay. - Second, you'll take medicine regularly.

354
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,458
Okay. - Third, you'll write to me regularly.

355
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,083
I will. - What more do I want?

356
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,083
Now my life will run smoothly like a train.

357
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:40,291
I'll just come. - Okay.

358
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,166
Bring a spanner, junkie. - Yes, sir.

359
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,666
Bring a spanner. - A spanner.

360
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,041
Take this, sir.

361
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:57,083
Give me a hammer. - Here.

362
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,500
Pincers. - Pinch whom?

363
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,916
Pincers. - Pincers?

364
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,708
You fool. - Where is it?

365
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,708
Give it to me quickly. - Sure, sir.

366
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:14,250
Who is there?

367
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,250
Dear. Brother. Sir. When did you come?

368
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,791
Hug me. My clothes are dirty.

369
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:28,166
It doesn't matter, silly.

370
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,916
Junkie. - Take the pincers, sir.

371
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:34,666
Forget it. Greet my childhood friend.

372
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,458
Greetings. - You can take leave. Stop the work.

373
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:42,166
How come you're here without any message?

374
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:46,416
I have a recording here and dad doesn't like my singing.

375
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,083
There was a heated argument, so I..

376
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,666
You left the house. I understand.

377
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,583
Don't worry. I have my own house.

378
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,958
Where's your luggage? - In the cab.

379
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,791
Why? - You don't understand.

380
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,916
You were single, but now you're married.

381
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,041
I better stay in a hotel. - What are you saying?

382
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,791
I'll slap you if you talk about staying in a hotel.

383
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,833
You're still here. Why didn't you leave?

384
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,666
Going. - Get the luggage from the cab.

385
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,583
This fool is always on a high.

386
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,916
Come to my house, my brother.

387
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,000
Manjeet, look who has come.

388
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,625
Who has come? It's you, sir.

389
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,083
Greetings. - Greetings.

390
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,666
Do you recognise him? - Yes.

391
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,666
Brother Arun. He attended our marriage.

392
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,083
Very good. Did you hear him?

393
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,416
He intends to stay in a hotel.

394
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:42,708
Why? - Sister-in-law, actually..

395
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:47,291
You mean this house is small. - No, I don't mean that.

396
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:52,666
The house may be small, but our hearts are big enough.

397
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:56,916
Very good. We have big hearts.

398
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,666
That's true.

399
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:03,333
You're just staring. Cook some food quickly.

400
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:04,875
Sit down. I'll get it.

401
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,583
Come, friend.

402
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:12,583
Sit here. And feel at home.

403
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:18,916
May I ask something? - Yes.

404
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,583
When I saw sister-in-law earlier she wasn't like this.

405
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:27,250
What do you mean? - I mean, she is getting healthier.

406
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,416
We have a saying that if one's diet is good, everything is good.

407
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,500
Got it? - Yes.

408
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,083
We like those who have a healthy diet.

409
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,916
Sir. - Yes? Where should I keep the luggage?

410
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,166
On my head. - Where is your head?

411
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:51,416
Careful, junkie. Hold it properly.

412
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,583
Keep it inside. You fool.

413
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,000
Go.

414
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,750
Wait. Is it a harmonium? - Yes.

415
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,166
Let's play it today.

416
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,000
Now that I'm staying here, some other time.

417
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,291
Okay. Go.

418
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:10,875
Where are you going? Go inside.

419
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,208
This fool smokes pot.

420
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:15,708
The clock has stopped again.

421
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:21,791
Bless you. Why did you stop?

422
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,791
This clock always stops like our junkie.

423
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:34,416
It's working now.

424
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,791
I don't like the sight of a stopped clock.

425
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,791
It seems as if somebody's heart has stopped.

426
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,791
What you said is correct.

427
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,416
Manjeet. - Coming.

428
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:47,791
Here. - What is it?

429
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,291
Who will eat it? - You.

430
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,875
One doesn't get good food in trains.

431
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,250
Start eating, brother. I too will get to eat something.

432
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,791
You're talking as if I starve you.

433
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:06,750
We had fun in school together.

434
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,458
Shrikant's compositions were wonderful.

435
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,791
And you used to sing melodiously. I really enjoyed it.

436
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:17,708
Whenever you sing on the radio..

437
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,708
..he starts dancing with joy.

438
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:24,000
He calls everyone in the neighbourhood saying..

439
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,375
.."Listen to the great singer."

440
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,666
Of course. He's a great singer.

441
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:32,666
May I leave? - Yes.

442
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,250
I understood. You want sweets.

443
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,125
Where are you taking the plate?

444
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,041
You fool.

445
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:42,666
He won't leave me alone.

446
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:47,083
Aunt, I got Arun's letter today. He's fine in Calcutta.

447
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,791
Thank God I get to know about Arun through you.

448
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:56,750
Calcutta is a big city. Arun has neither money nor a job.

449
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,708
Don't worry about him. - Bhishan Singh and..

450
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,333
..Mr. Saxena are there. They'll look after him.

451
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:04,541
Mr. Saxena will arrange some plan for him.

452
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:09,000
What? You came to Calcutta long back..

453
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,666
..but have come to meet me today. - It's not so.

454
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,541
I thought you may be busy with your new job.

455
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,458
I didn't wish to disturb you.

456
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,125
Anyway, I met HMV's recording artiste.

457
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,208
He was praising your new song.

458
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,666
I said, why not?

459
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,833
After all, Sanjay is my boy. - Thank you, sir.

460
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,000
I need some money.

461
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,875
Introduce me to someone in the film industry.

462
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,291
I'm not yet fully acquainted with them.

463
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,541
The day I meet any music director..

464
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:47,875
..I'll definitely recommend you.

465
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:53,083
Silly. After your few programmes here..

466
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,166
..people will approach you.

467
00:28:56,666 --> 00:29:00,416
Yes. One programme scheduled on Thursday is cancelled.

468
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:04,041
If you say so, I'll schedule your live programme on that day.

469
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,208
Sure, sir. You don't have to ask.

470
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:08,791
But don't be late. - Okay, sir.

471
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,791
Thursday 8pm. Sharp.

472
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,041
Okay, sir. Thanks.

473
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:18,958
Sister-in-law has sent hot tea for you, Bhishan Singh.

474
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,958
Bring it. I'm also tired of work. Here.

475
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,583
You've worn my clothes, brother.

476
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,833
How do I look? - Just like a mechanic.

477
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,083
Really? - Sure.

478
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:35,333
Actually, I was bored sitting idle.

479
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,041
I've decided to work in your garage.

480
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,708
Will you fire me, sir?

481
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,666
Is it necessary to interfere?

482
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:45,250
No. I'll work and you'll sing.

483
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,333
I'll play the drum.

484
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:51,125
Fix the puncture first. Play the drum later.

485
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,666
Let's have tea. - Okay.

486
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,750
What lovely rain. It's pleasant.

487
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,791
It'll be fun if a beautiful girl's car breaks down..

488
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,291
..and she comes to our garage fully drenched.

489
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:08,291
And says, "Listen."

490
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:12,000
"My car has broken down in the rains. Please repair it."

491
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,750
The rain will pour down, drenching the girl.

492
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,375
You'll repair the car while I'll hold the girl.

493
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,708
I'll repair the car while you'll hold her? Wrong.

494
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,333
You'll repair the car while I hold her.

495
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:26,958
Wrong. - Why?

496
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,500
You're married, I'm not.

497
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,791
If sister-in-law sees it, you'll be in trouble.

498
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:38,625
I forgot. Okay. You keep holding while I fix the car.

499
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,625
She has come.

500
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,083
Who is there? - I'm here.

501
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,000
What is it? - Our car has broken down in the rain.

502
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,458
We had towed it here.

503
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,458
Please fix it.

504
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,791
Wait here. I'll send a good mechanic.

505
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,958
Wait here. - Okay.

506
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,208
She has come, brother. - Who?

507
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,708
The one you were waiting for.

508
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,000
You're interested in work?

509
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,375
Go and repair the vehicle. - May I?

510
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,666
Go, man.

511
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,666
May I?

512
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,875
Where is it? - The car is parked in the front.

513
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,875
Is it a vehicle or an elephant? Open the bonnet.

514
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,875
Okay.

515
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,666
Get a six number spanner and hammer from inside.

516
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,041
Six number spanner? Okay.

517
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,125
And listen, where's the car key?

518
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:48,375
In the car, sir. - Okay.

519
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,750
My umbrella.

520
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,750
I'm totally bald.

521
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,041
Why are you staring at me?

522
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:18,041
Do your work. - Oh. Yes.

523
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,916
Here's the hammer and the spanner.

524
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:42,291
Listen. Who is this girl?

525
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,166
Our madam.

526
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,041
She's very hot tempered.

527
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:51,500
As she had to push the vehicle. She's breathless.

528
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,416
Bholu, come here. - Yes.

529
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:57,583
How long will it take?

530
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:01,916
Ma'am, it's a machine. It may even take the entire night.

531
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,708
Silly. - Yes.

532
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,583
Listen. - Yes?

533
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,166
How much more time will it take?

534
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:14,166
Don't worry, ma'am. I'll repair it in no time.

535
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,666
What you're doing?

536
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,083
I was cleaning a petrol pipe. May I wipe it?

537
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:23,083
It's okay. Repair the vehicle.

538
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,375
What's this? - I'm repairing it.

539
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,875
Repairing it or breaking it?

540
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,958
Just wait and watch.

541
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,958
Friend, start the engine. - Yes, sir.

542
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:54,750
Did you see, ma'am? Your vehicle is like a wild animal.

543
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,291
It won't run unless you use force.

544
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,458
You're a chatterbox. - Really?

545
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:00,583
Give me my purse. - Strange.

546
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:01,958
Here, ma'am.

547
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,916
How much do I owe you? - Ma'am.

548
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,041
I'll accept whatever you offer.

549
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:09,166
What? - It's fine even if you pay nothing.

550
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,208
Take Rs.5.

551
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:14,375
Ma'am. - What now?

552
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,375
Poor man's umbrella.

553
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,333
Greetings, ma'am. - Start the car.

554
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:27,333
Driver, drive. - Yes, ma'am.

555
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:33,125
Call us if your car breaks down again.

556
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,666
Whose handkerchief is it?

557
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:50,583
A girl's. - From where did the girl come?

558
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:55,291
From the sky. - Only rain is pouring from the sky.

559
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:59,958
She descended with the rain and captured my heart.

560
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,958
Got it? Not yet?

561
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,708
You'll not understand.

562
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,916
Surprising.

563
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,375
Darling.

564
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,458
The way you make fried bread..

565
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,083
..impacts its taste.

566
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:20,958
Give it to me.

567
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,125
What is it? Why did you keep the fried bread aside?

568
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,958
Dine with brother, Arun.

569
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,875
Or it won't look nice. - It will.

570
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,083
Give me fried bread. - No.

571
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,416
I'm starving.

572
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:37,125
Brother Arun. Come soon.

573
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,916
Letters are collected at 10:00.

574
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:40,750
I'll post letters for mom and Shri and return.

575
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,916
Eat fried bread before leaving.

576
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:46,541
Have patience. I'll be back soon.

577
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:50,458
You're going out, but I'm starving to death.

578
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:56,208
Don't say that. Here. Have it.

579
00:35:56,708 --> 00:36:03,791
Manjeet, you feed me today.

580
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:07,166
Here. Eat it now.

581
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,708
The food is getting cold. - Let it get cold.

582
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:12,583
Let it get cold.

583
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,791
What about my share, sir? - Who is it?

584
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,666
Junkie, did you have to come at this moment?

585
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:23,083
I've not come, but the aroma of fried bread attracted me.

586
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,625
Take this and don't look back.

587
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:29,625
You fool.

588
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:36,916
Please pardon me, sir. I was coming to see you.

589
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,750
Why? What's the problem?

590
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,125
The car broke down again. - Car?

591
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,166
Is it a car or junk that keeps breaking down?

592
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,000
Where is it? - At sir's bungalow.

593
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,000
Come.

594
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,750
Why so scared, pal?

595
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,541
The matter is such. Our young madam..

596
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,833
..is really very strict.

597
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,791
No driver wants to work more than four days.

598
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,791
Why? Is there no one to explain it to her?

599
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,083
She doesn't obey anyone. She has only her grandpa.

600
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:05,000
But he's busy with work at the orphanage. - Really?

601
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,750
This is the orphanage's main building.

602
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,500
This is a playground for kids.

603
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,041
These two are hospitals.

604
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,250
You have to take charge of it, doctor.

605
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,375
If you say so, I'll surely do it.

606
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,208
How is my dream project?

607
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,291
Wonderful. Beautiful.

608
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:22,250
It's probably the best orphanage in our country.

609
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,625
Don't call it an orphanage, but a 'Happy Home.'

610
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:29,791
The place where kids play and grow up enjoying life..

611
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,500
..is a place of eternal bliss.

612
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,250
You should call it 'Happy Home.'

613
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,750
You're right.

614
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,708
Grandpa. - Yes, child.

615
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,041
Haven't you left for college yet? - Good morning, uncle.

616
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:41,458
Good morning. - How are you?

617
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,875
Fine. Thank you. - Why didn't you leave for college?

618
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:44,875
How can I?

619
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,666
When I got ready, the car broke down.

620
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,208
Again.

621
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,458
Bholuram is a fool. Where is he?

622
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,625
What can he do? He drives the car, but can't fix it.

623
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,916
Only a prince can drive your car. - A prince.

624
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:00,333
I mean, marry a prince. Your life will run smoothly.

625
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,916
Grandpa, you are.. - What?

626
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,375
I'll go on foot.

627
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,708
Bye, uncle.

628
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:12,625
She is strange. - Just like her grandpa.

629
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,500
Please have tea. I'll solve her problem.

630
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,416
You may go.

631
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,583
Have you called a mechanic? - Hello, ma'am.

632
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,333
You? You've called him again, Bholu?

633
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,375
I couldn't find anyone else. - Don't worry.

634
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:23,958
I'll repair the car properly.

635
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,000
Bring the spanner. - Okay.

636
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
You'll not touch my car.

637
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,250
Why? Your driver called me here.

638
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,791
Don't snatch a worker's job.

639
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,208
Stupid.

640
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:34,916
Don't chatter too much in English.

641
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,291
If I speak English, you'll be speechless.

642
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:38,500
What? - Yes.

643
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,625
What happened, son?

644
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:44,333
Bholu brought the mechanic who repaired my car last night.

645
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:45,666
What's wrong? It's fine.

646
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,000
He talks rudely. - Is it?

647
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,041
Greetings, sir. - Greetings.

648
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:52,958
Are you a mechanic? - Yes, sir.

649
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,375
Why is your hairstyle like an actor?

650
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,541
It's a secret. - What?

651
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,875
When I left my village..

652
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,958
..I told my mom I'd be an actor, but I became a mechanic.

653
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,875
He talks too much. - That's what I said.

654
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,000
What's wrong with the car? - Sir..

655
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,041
Hammer. - Okay. Nothing wrong with the car.

656
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,625
Actually, your love has spoiled it.

657
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,833
What is it? You're hammering my favourite car.

658
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,708
Keep your heart strong.

659
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:24,208
A car is like a wife. Love makes it run wild.

660
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,000
With force, it.. - What?

661
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,916
You won't understand, but sir did.

662
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:30,583
Start the engine, friend.

663
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,208
He looks crazy. - Totally.

664
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:33,458
Pardon. - No. Start the car.

665
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:37,458
Start the car.

666
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,000
Wow. You fixed it with a hammer. - Yes.

667
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,750
Off it, Bholuram.

668
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,416
He's great. You're a wonderful man.

669
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:49,250
It's not so. Every vehicle has some defects.

670
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,666
I know this car's problem very well.

671
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:56,083
That's great. I too want someone who understands it.

672
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,958
Become our driver. - Grandpa.

673
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,541
Your driver? - We'll pay you a great salary.

674
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,458
Salary?

675
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,625
I need time to think, sir.

676
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,416
Is it fine if I tell you tomorrow? - Tomorrow?

677
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:10,541
He's a stranger, but you've offered him a job.

678
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:11,750
He babbles, but he's useful.

679
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,750
No. - You're a useful man.

680
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,333
It's your illusion. I'm worth nothing.

681
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,666
Hi, Sumi. - Hi.

682
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:20,916
How are you, Anu? - Fine.

683
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,625
Greetings, grandpa. - Greetings.

684
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,958
Come here quickly. There's good news for you.

685
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,500
Let us know what the good news is.

686
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,541
It's not for you, grandpa. Come here soon.

687
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,708
Dr. Sen, your daughter won't tell me the good news.

688
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:39,500
May I leave, sir?

689
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,666
Yes, but come tomorrow without fail.

690
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,458
Doctor, coming. Here.

691
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,416
Come here. - First tell me..

692
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,500
What'll be my reward? - Tell me first.

693
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,291
Sanjay is your hero. - Sanjay?

694
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:50,625
Yes. What happened to him?

695
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,083
Nothing. Tonight at 8pm he'll sing at the Calcutta Radio station.

696
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:57,125
Is it true? - It's in today's newspaper.

697
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,750
Anu, you're great.

698
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,541
You're still here?

699
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,083
I'm going. Greetings, ma'am.

700
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,208
Silly. - Let it be.

701
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,250
When will it be 8pm and when can I hear his song?

702
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,708
At 8pm, darling.

703
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,458
Let's go to college now.

704
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,875
Music lovers..

705
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,375
..it's my first performance in your city.

706
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:25,416
You know, last night there was heavy rain.

707
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,500
Though I was with a friend I was feeling lonely.

708
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,458
Suddenly I saw a beautiful girl getting drenched in the rain.

709
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,791
Her car had broken down.

710
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:44,500
After looking at her, I felt as if..

711
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,541
"While traversing the beautiful, exotic streets.."

712
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:55,541
"..sometimes, by chance.."

713
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,875
"..while traversing the beautiful, exotic streets.."

714
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:13,166
"..sometimes, by chance.."

715
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:18,333
"..we meet so many strangers."

716
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:29,166
"Among them, some are forgotten, while some are not."

717
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:39,750
"Among them, some are forgotten, while some are not."

718
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,083
"While traversing the beautiful, exotic streets.."

719
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:50,333
"..sometimes, by chance.."

720
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:55,583
"..we meet so many strangers."

721
00:42:56,083 --> 00:43:06,166
"Among them, some are forgotten, while some are not."

722
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:10,166
"Among them, some are forgotten, while some are not."

723
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,166
"Friends from the world of music."

724
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,791
"Last night in this town.."

725
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:48,958
"..I came across such a beautiful thought."

726
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:54,375
"I found a silk handkerchief on the road."

727
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:59,583
"I've come across such a beautiful thought."

728
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:04,541
"I found a silk handkerchief on the road."

729
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:09,583
"It was left deliberately by someone."

730
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:14,916
"Whoever it belongs to can come and collect it."

731
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:20,250
"Or else I'll keep it as my own.."

732
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,375
"..considering it to be the memento of someone beautiful."

733
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:28,750
"Considering it as a memento."

734
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:34,208
"During causal conversation.."

735
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:44,708
"..often a prank creates many young love sagas."

736
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:55,416
"Of those sagas, some are forgotten and some are not."

737
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:59,416
"Among them, some are forgotten, while some are not."

738
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,041
"Destiny is kind to me."

739
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,875
"The person whose story I'm narrating.."

740
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:32,791
"..must have heard this message too."

741
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:38,208
"She must've heard her name in my songs."

742
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:43,416
"She must've heard this message too."

743
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:48,000
"She must've heard her name in my songs."

744
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:53,250
"Sitting afar, let her know this secret."

745
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,583
"Let her recognise my voice."

746
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:03,750
"I wish it rains like last night."

747
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:12,333
"And I get to meet her again somewhere."

748
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:17,666
"When one can't sleep even late in the nights.."

749
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:28,208
"..many beautiful dreams are woven."

750
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:38,208
"Most of those dreams are forgotten, while some are not."

751
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:42,208
"Among them, some are forgotten, while some are not."

752
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,916
Greetings, Bholuram.

753
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,250
Greetings. - Bathing?

754
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,291
No. I'm cleaning the car.

755
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,875
Have you decided? Will you work here?

756
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,416
Only if you don't incur losses.

757
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:10,916
You're talking about losses. In fact, you've saved me.

758
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:15,083
How? - I was fed up of madam's daily yelling.

759
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,333
Now that you're here, listen to it.

760
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,458
Let's see who babbles. She or me?

761
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:24,875
But you don't babble in between.

762
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:30,375
"While traversing the beautiful, exotic streets.."

763
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:34,416
"..sometimes, by chance.."

764
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:42,000
"..we meet so many strangers."

765
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:49,583
"Among them, some are..''

766
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:55,791
"..some are never forgotten."

767
00:47:56,291 --> 00:48:05,125
"While traversing the beautiful, exotic streets.."

768
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:11,791
"..sometimes, by chance.."

769
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:19,500
"..we meet so many strangers."

770
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,500
"Among them, some are.."

771
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,083
"Some are.."

772
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:30,458
You. - Greetings, ma'am.

773
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:31,583
Why did you come in?

774
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,791
I was standing out. Bholu sent me in, so I entered.

775
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,666
So you came inside? - I saw you were singing.

776
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,500
I was thinking whether to call you or not.

777
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But then you saw me and I was embarrassed.

778
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,750
I said get out.

779
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:46,958
I said get out.

780
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:51,958
Okay. I'm going, but your grandpa had called me.

781
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,541
Even if he did, you can't come here. Get out.

782
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:57,333
Okay. I'll stand outside.

783
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,625
Ma'am, but inform grandpa about me.

784
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:04,833
I said get out. Silly.

785
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,833
Grandpa. - Coming. Why are you shouting, child?

786
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:11,000
Your darling mechanic driver has come. - What?

787
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,958
Oh, driver. Let's meet him.

788
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,375
Grandpa, I don't like that man.

789
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:18,291
Why not? - He's a chatterbox.

790
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:20,458
I'll warn him not to talk too much.

791
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,125
You won't hire him.

792
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,125
I had called him so I have to talk to him.

793
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:28,375
Make any excuse and drive him out.

794
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:32,083
Come.

795
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,666
What excuse?

796
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:38,666
What excuse can I give him? - Anything.

797
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:44,125
What's up? Why are you standing here with a long face?

798
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:49,000
Sir, madam asked me to.

799
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,750
Come inside.

800
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,583
Greetings, sir.

801
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:56,791
Greetings.

802
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:03,583
You've decided to work here? - Yes.

803
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:04,583
What's your name?

804
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:09,791
That..Pritam Nath Ghayal.

805
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,500
What? - Such a long name? - Yes.

806
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,833
Who'll call out such a long name?

807
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,458
If you feel it's long, shorten it.

808
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:21,041
If you want, call me either 'Pritam' or 'Ghayal.'

809
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:23,750
Or even 'Nath,' with love.

810
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,083
You're right. He blabbers a lot. - I said so.

811
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,416
Listen, Premnath. - Pritam Nath.

812
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:34,125
Yes, Pritam Nath Goyal. - Ghayal.

813
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:36,083
Your name is Pritam Nath.

814
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:39,166
Why have you added a title 'Ghayal,' like a poet?

815
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,458
Why? - That's what I asked you.

816
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,125
Are you a poet? - I just scribble.

817
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,708
If you say so, I'll recite something.

818
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,000
Okay. There's no harm in it.

819
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:54,666
'First she said "sweet," then "he," then "art."'

820
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:56,041
I didn't understand it, but go ahead.

821
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:59,375
'In this way she chopped "sweetheart" into pieces.'

822
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:02,375
Splendid. What a couplet.

823
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,208
You've surpassed the renowned poets.

824
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,250
You listen to my poem. - Grandpa.

825
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,000
Let me recite. May I? - Yes.

826
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,708
Listen. 'Throughout the night in a pen.'

827
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:14,291
Do you know 'pen'? - A hen's enclosure.

828
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:19,958
Correct. 'Throughout the night I sat in the pen wondering..'

829
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:23,875
'..whose eggs will I eat once the hen is dead.'

830
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:28,875
You've outdone my verse. - Really?

831
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,083
Yes. - Grandpa. You've started reciting poems.

832
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,541
Have you called him for a job or reciting poems?

833
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:37,083
Listen, Pritam Singh. - Nath.

834
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,583
Yes, Pritam Nath. I forgot to tell you something.

835
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,750
What? - We can't hire a bachelor.

836
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,458
Had you been married we'd have given you the job.

837
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:48,875
Marriage. I got married in my childhood.

838
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,375
Are you married? - Yes.

839
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,041
I have two offspring. Do you know offspring?

840
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,958
I have two kids. - You have kids too?

841
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:56,916
So big. - Wait here.

842
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,125
Listen.

843
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:01,541
I promised him and got trapped. We'll hire him.

844
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,083
No, grandpa. Offer a very low salary..

845
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:09,333
..so that he leaves. - Is it so?

846
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:15,208
Listen. We're poor. I mean, we can't pay you a high salary.

847
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:18,291
How much do you want? - Don't worry about salary.

848
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,083
I have ancestral land that provides us food.

849
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,000
I'll accept whatever you offer.

850
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,333
I want a job in this house.

851
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:28,916
I got trapped again. What do I do now?

852
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:32,500
Do whatever you want.

853
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,708
We'll give you 400.. - 400?

854
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:38,416
We'll pay Rs.300 per month.

855
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,375
We'll give meals, but no money for clothes and haircut.

856
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,375
Do you agree? - I do.

857
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:44,791
He agreed.

858
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:46,666
But you won't babble.

859
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:50,916
If you say so, I'll cut my tongue and keep it in your hands.

860
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:52,375
Grandpa, he started babbling again.

861
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:56,375
No babbling. - Okay.

862
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:06,583
Driver, stop the vehicle and start honking.

863
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,583
Go on honking. Don't stop.

864
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:22,333
Coming, friend. - Stop honking.

865
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,458
You're always in a rush, pal.

866
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,458
I told you to stop honking.

867
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,000
Is he new? - Yes.

868
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Listen.

869
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,416
Whenever somebody comes to sit in the car..

870
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:34,916
..you should open the door..

871
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:36,916
..and salute humbly.

872
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:40,750
Is the poor fellow dumb?

873
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,041
Why are you quiet? Speak up.

874
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:45,958
When I speak, you say I talk too much.

875
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:48,666
When I keep quiet, you say I don't talk.

876
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:50,208
It's difficult to talk to him.

877
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:51,833
You were told to talk less..

878
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,041
..and not to keep quiet. - Yes, ma'am.

879
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:59,041
Okay. Drive the car. - Yes.

880
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,416
Did you hear Sanjay's song last night? - Lovely. Beautiful.

881
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:18,666
I think when my car broke down that night..

882
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,541
..Mr. Sanjay saw me.

883
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:25,708
Why? - Whatever he narrated in his song happened to me.

884
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,625
When did your car break down?

885
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:31,041
My car? Yes. He had repaired my car.

886
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:32,916
Driver? - Yes, ma'am.

887
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,375
Does Mr. Sanjay stay near your garage?

888
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:37,583
Mr. Sanjay. Who is he?

889
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:40,125
Don't you know Mr. Sanjay?

890
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:44,041
No. Oh. Mr. Sanjay? I know him.

891
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:47,791
He is a distant relative of mine.

892
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:50,083
Oh. It's futile to talk to him.

893
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,083
Don't talk to him.

894
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:01,833
What happened?

895
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,916
Run. Go back.

896
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:05,833
Sumita, the college strike has become worse.

897
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:08,916
Many students are injured. - Anu, call your dad to..

898
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:10,666
..take care of the injured students.

899
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:12,500
They're taking them to his hospital.

900
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Sumi, let's return home.

901
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,000
Drive back to Anu's house, driver.

902
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,791
What are you saying, child? The police had to use tear gas.

903
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:22,500
The police had to fire too. Are you all right?

904
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,500
Many students are injured.

905
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,083
Where are they?

906
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:30,291
In Dr. Sen's hospital. Return home.

907
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:33,250
What do I say? Where are these students heading, Gupta?

908
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,750
This is a bad time, Mr. Mathur.

909
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,875
When was it good?

910
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:40,833
After freedom, we're fighting with each other.

911
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:44,291
During British rule we had to face many atrocities.

912
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:48,291
Let it be. I'll visit the children in the hospital. - Fine.

913
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:57,250
Hail India.

914
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,000
Mr. Mathur. - Yes?

915
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,000
I remembered my son.

916
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:23,541
Please excuse me.

917
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,750
Is it hurting a lot? - Yes, doctor.

918
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,083
Okay. - Dr. Sen, I heard about the commotion.

919
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,625
Mr. Mathur, you are here?

920
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,916
Sumita called and said the police used force in college.

921
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:38,041
Many were injured. - This is the result.

922
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:40,208
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

923
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:43,166
Who can advise today's youth?

924
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,791
In the zeal of youth, they neither care for others..

925
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:48,250
..nor listen to anybody.

926
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,708
If youngsters don't listen to elders..

927
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,958
..even the elders don't listen to them. - Excuse me.

928
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,000
The patient on bed number 16 is serious.

929
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,208
Didn't we get blood from the blood bank yet? - No.

930
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,666
Amazing. Is there no blood in the blood bank here?

931
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,416
It's not so.

932
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:04,625
That boy needs Rh A negative blood group..

933
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,500
..which we don't have.

934
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,416
You're lucky. That's my blood group.

935
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,666
Will you? - Why? Isn't my blood worth donating?

936
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,958
It's not so. - It's vital to save the boy.

937
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:15,666
Come. - Sister, arrange for it quickly.

938
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,666
Come.

939
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:25,166
Mr. Mathur. - Yes, doctor?

940
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:31,958
I've seen many people in this world, but you astonish me.

941
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,291
Slowly. - Do I look like a demon?

942
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,541
I didn't mean that.

943
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:41,083
Nowadays people don't help others.

944
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:47,250
I was not like this earlier.

945
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,250
I was very adamant.

946
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:53,541
I liked to humiliate others and achieve my goal.

947
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:57,125
How did you change?

948
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,791
There's a long history behind it.

949
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:04,125
I had a son. Anand.

950
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:08,041
Anand joined the freedom movement..

951
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,958
..which I disliked the most. One day..

952
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:13,666
The father is a bureaucrat and son a revolutionary..

953
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,625
..shouting slogans on the road.

954
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:20,208
'Revolution. Freedom.' Sit down.

955
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:23,375
The starved and poor talk of revolution.

956
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:24,625
What do you lack?

957
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,416
After getting a government's title..

958
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:29,291
..you can't see their plight.

959
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:32,166
Nonsense. I'm warning you for the last time.

960
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:33,958
Such things won't be tolerated here.

961
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:36,500
If you want to join politics, leave this house. Get out.

962
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,166
I'm leaving. - Leaving?

963
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:42,000
Before leaving, I want to say something.

964
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,041
You were born and brought up in this motherland.

965
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,500
Someday, do think about our motherland.

966
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,500
What did you say?

967
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:58,583
For a moment I thought of stopping him..

968
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:02,500
..but I realised whatever he said was correct.

969
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,291
When I came to my senses he was long gone.

970
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:10,125
Those were the days of British rule. Days of slavery.

971
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:14,125
Revolutionary slogans were replied with British bullets.

972
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:28,666
What happened later?

973
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,958
After a few days I heard..

974
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:37,708
..that before dying, Anand married the daughter..

975
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,416
..of a martyred revolutionary.

976
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:46,166
After Anand's death, his wife gave birth to a son.

977
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:50,166
When I reached her place to bring her back..

978
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,750
Are you Anand's wife?

979
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,166
Yes.

980
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:08,208
I'm his father.

981
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,375
Bless you.

982
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:15,291
I've come to take you home, daughter-in-law.

983
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:18,541
I won't enter the house..

984
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:21,958
..that had no place for my husband.

985
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,958
Please pardon me.

986
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:31,791
At that time I returned..

987
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:33,791
..but my heart couldn't accept it.

988
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:36,416
I went to her house again the next day.

989
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:40,333
But she had left with her son.

990
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:44,375
And with the passage of time everything was lost.

991
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,625
Then? - I tried hard to find them.

992
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,916
I didn't succeed in my quest.

993
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:53,750
However I learnt a bit about life.

994
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:58,125
I learnt life means forgetting our grief in other's joy.

995
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:02,125
Today I share my feelings with every orphan, big or small.

996
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:41,500
"If you're without support.."

997
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,250
"..become someone else's support."

998
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:50,000
"If you're without support.."

999
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,625
"..become someone else's support."

1000
01:01:55,125 --> 01:02:00,333
"You won't be without support any more."

1001
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:04,250
"If you come by a boat near the shore.."

1002
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:11,625
"..you'll find your destination too."

1003
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:15,541
"If you're without support.."

1004
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:20,125
"..become someone else's support."

1005
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:24,125
"If you're without support.."

1006
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:47,666
"We have to live our life smiling."

1007
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:53,208
"We have to confront our sorrows."

1008
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:58,916
"However long the path is.."

1009
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:07,416
"..the river has to flow."

1010
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:13,791
"Even if you're alone, move ahead without stopping."

1011
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:19,458
"You'll get a friend on the way."

1012
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:23,250
"If you're without support.."

1013
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,750
"..become someone else's support."

1014
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,750
"If you're without support.."

1015
01:03:55,916 --> 01:04:01,125
"Every life is the same."

1016
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:06,625
"Someone cries while some laugh."

1017
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:12,250
"It's easy to live with patience."

1018
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,458
"It's difficult to live with worries."

1019
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:20,708
"It's difficult to live with worries."

1020
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:26,958
"Destiny has endowed us with joy and sorrow."

1021
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:32,500
"We'll get our share from this."

1022
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,375
"If you're without support.."

1023
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:42,416
"..become someone else's support."

1024
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,291
Ma'am, have coffee.

1025
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,500
I don't feel like drinking it. Take it back, Puran.

1026
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,750
Sushma.

1027
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,041
Look, Sushma.

1028
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,916
Another letter from the girl's side for Arun's marriage proposal.

1029
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:55,833
I don't know how they'd take my silence.

1030
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:59,125
They're from a prestigious family! This boy has.. - Listen.

1031
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:02,375
He's as stubborn as you are.

1032
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,750
Go to Calcutta and meet him once.

1033
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,250
He'll certainly listen to you. - My foot!

1034
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,375
Does he even inquire about your health?

1035
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,791
Does he care for anybody?

1036
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:17,166
He can leave us, but not Shrikant.

1037
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:21,166
The bloody fool of a poet!

1038
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:38,500
Look the same person has come again.

1039
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,416
Come in, Shrikant. Sit down.

1040
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:47,833
You should've rested at home in this windy weather.

1041
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:50,625
I've come to you to get some rest at home.

1042
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,041
I need some money. - Money?

1043
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:56,458
As per my calculation I owe you nothing.

1044
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:59,916
As per the account you owe me Rs.2,000..

1045
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,541
..but I've not come to check the accounts.

1046
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:05,666
Give me Rs.500. - 500?

1047
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:09,916
I can't frequent your shop. I badly need money.

1048
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:12,833
Okay. I'll give you Rs.500.

1049
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:16,000
I'll consider that I donated it to some orphanage.

1050
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,541
Here. - Mr. Gupta, beggars accept alms.

1051
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:22,625
This is my hard-earned money.

1052
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,375
Greetings.

1053
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:30,458
Did you see? People beg for alms as if it's their right.

1054
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,416
No, Mr. Gupta.

1055
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:36,416
Nowadays people give rights as alms.

1056
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:55,458
Mom, I've brought some money. - Son.

1057
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:56,708
Saw?

1058
01:06:57,208 --> 01:07:00,666
You? - We were told they're starving to death.

1059
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:03,916
But they are counting currencies.

1060
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:07,708
Dharamdas, please return my money this time.

1061
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,500
I'm in difficulty at present.

1062
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,958
He had no difficulties while taking grains from the shop.

1063
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:15,166
But he's experiencing difficulties while paying for it.

1064
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,875
They owe you a small amount.

1065
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,125
But they've squatted my house..

1066
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,500
..worth Rs.40,000.

1067
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,041
Lala. - Yes? - Please talk softly.

1068
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,875
Why should I? I'm a creditor, not a debtor.

1069
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:33,458
I advice you to vacate the house quietly, Shrikant.

1070
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:35,666
Or else I'll get the court's order..

1071
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:39,291
..and throw both of you outside. Got it?

1072
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:40,791
Lala. - Yes?

1073
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:44,500
Before you throw us out..

1074
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,708
..I say, get out of here. Go away.

1075
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:50,333
I say get out! - Okay.

1076
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,333
But I'll deal with you. Come.

1077
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:09,333
I've told you many times to have patience.

1078
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:12,125
Everyone faces hardships.

1079
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:13,708
But mom..

1080
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:16,458
..you spend lots of money on my medicine.

1081
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:19,708
You live on a meagre meal.

1082
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,875
On top of that, we're in heavy debts.

1083
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:26,500
How long can we carry this on? - Silly!

1084
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,625
We'll do it as long as we're capable.

1085
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:30,958
Don't worry.

1086
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:34,291
Arun's letter came today.

1087
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:38,083
What has he written? - The same as in the last letter.

1088
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:45,541
Write regularly. See the doctor daily. Take medicine on time.

1089
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:49,625
Even if I don't fulfil Arun's other requests..

1090
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:53,916
..I will comply to his request..

1091
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:56,541
..to write songs.

1092
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,916
I'll write these songs for him.

1093
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:04,541
Mom, never mention my illness to Arun.

1094
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:08,291
But, son.. - Mom, swear on me.

1095
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:11,166
Okay.

1096
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:12,583
I won't write.

1097
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,416
Bhisan Singh. I got my friend's letter.

1098
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:16,375
What has he written?

1099
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,166
That he had consulted a specialist.

1100
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:20,250
The report is normal and cough is cured.

1101
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,375
This is good news.

1102
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,750
He even said not to worry about him, but myself.

1103
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,375
It means, do worry.

1104
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,500
There is no need to worry now.

1105
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,708
Right. When my friend is fine, I'm absolutely fine.

1106
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,375
Okay. Bholuram. - Sir.

1107
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:40,250
You appear to be in a jovial mood, sir.

1108
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,083
I'm very happy today. - Any special occasion?

1109
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:46,916
Yes. I'll tell you the secret later.

1110
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,916
Let me first report to ma'am.

1111
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,375
Sir. - What?

1112
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:55,375
As you're going in take these letters with you.

1113
01:09:55,875 --> 01:10:03,041
Impostor! Why don't you go instead of asking me?

1114
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:05,166
R. K. Chaudhary!

1115
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:09,166
Father's letter?

1116
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:15,125
Ramesh Chandra. Greetings! Received your letter.

1117
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:19,083
My son has gone out for work. As soon as he returns..

1118
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,375
..the marriage date will be fixed. God!

1119
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:25,750
So mom wants me and Sumita..

1120
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,208
Pritam. - Yes, ma'am.

1121
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:32,541
We have to visit Anu and buy records.

1122
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:37,291
Why are you staring me? Come on.

1123
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,916
What happened to you?

1124
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:45,291
Ma'am, I just got a feeling. - What?

1125
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:48,208
You'll get married soon. - Don't babble. Come on.

1126
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:52,208
Let's go.

1127
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:15,541
Thank you. Come. - Come.

1128
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:17,416
Pritam? - Yes, ma'am.

1129
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:18,791
This is Mr. Sanjay's record.

1130
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,125
Mr. Sanjay's record. Then it must be good.

1131
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:25,125
Keep it carefully. We'll be back.

1132
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:31,000
What did you do with it? - Nothing, ma'am.

1133
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,541
Fool! You've broken the record.

1134
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:36,833
I was keeping it carefully, but this mirror dashed against it.

1135
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:39,083
Don't lie. - Don't be angry.

1136
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,833
The shop is here. I'll buy another record quickly.

1137
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,541
This was the last one. How will you bring another one?

1138
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:47,708
My mistake. Forgive me. - I'll never forgive you.

1139
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:50,166
You're fired. - Fired?

1140
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:54,166
No, ma'am. Don't fire me. Please.

1141
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Haven't you finished your tea yet?

1142
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,125
There is still half an hour for Mr. Sanjay's recording.

1143
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,291
It takes ten minutes to reach the radio station.

1144
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:09,166
Ten minutes? What if the recording starts early?

1145
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:12,333
Are you mad? Recordings are always done on time.

1146
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,500
Come on. - Okay, let's go.

1147
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,250
You're back. - You're very insolent.

1148
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,541
You're unnecessarily angry with me.

1149
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,166
Look what I've brought for you.

1150
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:22,750
Mr. Sanjay's record! - From where did you get it?

1151
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,666
I searched the entire city.

1152
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:28,958
I brought it from the main recording office.

1153
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,666
Do you know whom I met me there? - Whom?

1154
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:34,708
Mr. Sanjay. - Mr. Sanjay!

1155
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:38,833
I told him frankly that my ma'am is your biggest fan.

1156
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:42,708
What did he say? - He asked me your name in joy.

1157
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:44,583
Did you give him Sumi's name? - Yes.

1158
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:47,750
So sweet! - He took out this record and gave it to me.

1159
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,541
He even gave me a photograph.

1160
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,666
Photograph? - You mean an autograph?

1161
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:54,750
Yes. - Where? - Ma'am, look what he has written?

1162
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,500
"To my beloved Sumita. With love, Sanjay."

1163
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,083
My darling. - So sweet!

1164
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,666
Pritam. - Yes.

1165
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:06,333
What does he look like? - Just like me.

1166
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:07,875
What do you mean?

1167
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,416
What are you babbling?

1168
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,416
I mean, ma'am, if you look at him..

1169
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:18,000
..you'll feel it's me, but in different uniform.

1170
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,416
Pritam, I'm happy with you today. - Yes?

1171
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,125
We'll take you along to Darjeeling.

1172
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:25,000
College vacation has started. We'll surely take you.

1173
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,875
Happy? - I'm very happy. I swear I got everything.

1174
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:31,625
I'm elated.

1175
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:34,041
I'm proud of you.

1176
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,541
One photograph please.

1177
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,333
We were waiting for a long time, Mr. Sanjay. Please.

1178
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:38,791
I said no.

1179
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,750
Just one snap. - I'm sorry.

1180
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,208
We were waiting for long, sir. Please.

1181
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:44,500
Please, Mr. Sanjay.

1182
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,583
If the poor photographers had taken your snaps..

1183
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:50,041
..you would've lost nothing. - Leave it, sir.

1184
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,916
Okay, leave it. Look at your fan mails!

1185
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:58,750
Everyone is awaiting your public performance.

1186
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,500
No. I'll never sing before the audience, sir.

1187
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,416
Why? - You know very well.

1188
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,375
The moment I sing before the audience..

1189
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,166
..people will know I'm R. K. Chaudhary's son.

1190
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:12,250
I don't want dad to misunderstand that..

1191
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,250
..I used his name to get success in life.

1192
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,500
As you wish.

1193
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,125
I have a small request, sir. - What?

1194
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:23,083
Don't schedule my programme for 15 days. - Why?

1195
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,875
I'm going to Darjeeling. - Darjeeling. Why?

1196
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:29,250
It's a private matter, sir.

1197
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,750
With a girl. I have.. - You mean..

1198
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:37,458
..L-O-V-E. - Right, sir.

1199
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,000
Excuse me. - Yes, madam.

1200
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,583
We want to meet Mr. Sanjay. Can you tell us where he is?

1201
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:45,916
Yes. He's in Mr. Saxena's cabin.

1202
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:49,916
Write your name here.

1203
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,583
Oh God! I'm dead.

1204
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,000
Sir. - What happened?

1205
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:03,541
Two girls are outside. If they ask about me, just refuse.

1206
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,541
Sir, two girls want to meet you.

1207
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:09,625
Send them in. - Okay.

1208
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:13,625
Go ahead.

1209
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:20,916
Greetings. - Greetings.

1210
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:25,666
Come in.

1211
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:28,375
Sit down.

1212
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:30,708
Yes? - Pardon us, sir.

1213
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:34,416
We saw a man enter your cabin.

1214
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:38,833
My cabin? - Yes. His name is Pritam (beloved).

1215
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:41,958
Who's beloved? - Her beloved.

1216
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,250
Sorry, I mean her driver.

1217
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:48,708
Driver? No driver came here.

1218
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:50,708
Yes, Sanjay was here.

1219
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:54,041
Sanjay has come? We came to meet Sanjay.

1220
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:59,625
Where is he? - Sanjay is and isn't here.

1221
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,250
He is and isn't here! - What does it mean?

1222
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,541
I mean, he came, but he left.

1223
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,583
He left? When can we meet him?

1224
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,541
If you want to meet him, come after 15 days..

1225
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:15,333
..because he's leaving for Darjeeling tomorrow.

1226
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:18,375
What? Darjeeling? - We too are going to Darjeeling.

1227
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:19,958
You too? - Yes.

1228
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,583
We'll meet him in Darjeeling.

1229
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,416
Okay, sir. - Thank you, sir.

1230
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:29,541
Greetings, sir. - Greetings.

1231
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:32,875
Come out. - Thanks.

1232
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,291
Bye, sir.

1233
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:38,375
I'll see you after returning from Darjeeling? - What is it?

1234
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:42,375
Actually! She loves me.

1235
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,500
Both? - No. The taller one.

1236
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,500
She loves you. Do you love her too? - Yes.

1237
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,625
If you love each other, why did you hide?

1238
01:16:55,125 --> 01:17:00,250
I'm not the one she loves. She loves what I am.

1239
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,291
You're not the one whom she loves?

1240
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,333
I am. - Then what is the problem?

1241
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,500
The problem? I'm the one whom she loves.

1242
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,208
But she doesn't love what I am.

1243
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:16,000
But she doesn't love what you are?

1244
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,500
You're the one she loves?

1245
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,500
You always confuse me. - Thanks, sir. Bye.

1246
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:44,708
Good morning, madam.

1247
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,083
Good morning. - Good morning.

1248
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:47,541
Pritam. - Yes, ma'am?

1249
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,416
Find out in which hotel Mr. Sanjay has checked in.

1250
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,125
I have to check all the hotels?

1251
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,625
Yes. Go. - Okay.

1252
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,375
Ma'am. - What is this?

1253
01:17:57,875 --> 01:18:00,333
This is your make-up box. - Keep it here.

1254
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:04,250
Keep it here.

1255
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,666
Strange! The poor fellow will wander all day.

1256
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:10,583
So what? Let's get ready and go out.

1257
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:14,583
Bahadur, take madam's luggage to the room.

1258
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:20,875
Bhisan Singh, getting your shoes polished?

1259
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:24,500
Brother, you've brought us to Darjeeling today.

1260
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,750
May God fulfil all your wishes!

1261
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,291
I enjoyed it. - Did you enjoy it?

1262
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:32,333
I'll enjoy with you as well. I'm free till evening.

1263
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,250
How is it so?

1264
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,666
Sumita asked me to search all the hotels in Darjeeling..

1265
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,500
..to find Mr. Sanjay. And I'm on the hunt.

1266
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,666
It means you're looking for yourself? - Yes.

1267
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:46,250
In the evening I'll say, "Maybe he isn't in any hotel.."

1268
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,375
"..but on some tree."

1269
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:51,666
Change it. You're polishing just one shoe.

1270
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:57,500
Listen, brother. Why don't you tell her that you're Sanjay?

1271
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,333
At times I think of telling her.

1272
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:01,125
But I'm afraid she might misunderstand me.

1273
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:03,583
She will surely find out someday. Then?

1274
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,833
Pritam. - Who called me?

1275
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:08,583
My goodness! Yes, ma'am. - What are you doing there?

1276
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:11,250
I told you to look for Mr. Sanjay. - I'm working on it.

1277
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,916
She's her? - Yes.

1278
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:17,041
I couldn't find Mr. Sanjay, but I met his secretary.

1279
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:18,541
Who is his secretary? - You.

1280
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,708
Ma'am, he is Sardar Bhisan Singh.

1281
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:25,625
He's Mr. Sanjay's secretary? Wait there. I'm coming.

1282
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,583
What is this joke? - No joke. Just stay quiet and..

1283
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,000
..handle the situation.

1284
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,375
But.. - Ma'am, come and meet him.

1285
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:35,166
Meet him. - You're Sanjay's secretary?

1286
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,083
Yes. - Where is Mr. Sanjay at present?

1287
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:39,291
He's here. - No.

1288
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:42,208
He means to say that Mr. Sanjay is in Darjeeling.

1289
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,500
They want to know where they can meet Mr. Sanjay. - Yes.

1290
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,875
I don't know. - But you know everything.

1291
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,500
Tell us, please. - Yes.

1292
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,708
It's difficult to meet Mr. Sanjay. - It's important for us to meet him.

1293
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:54,583
Yes, it's important. - Please.

1294
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,166
It's important for everyone to meet him. - Please, sir.

1295
01:19:57,666 --> 01:19:59,291
Please, sir. - What please?

1296
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:02,208
I'll tell you, if you want to meet him..

1297
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:04,666
..he has a programme in the evening at Kushiwan.

1298
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:07,750
Come there. I'll introduce you.

1299
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,666
Are you sure, sir?

1300
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:12,625
If I don't know, who else will know it?

1301
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,958
I arrange all his programmes. - Right.

1302
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,541
The place is very far from here, ma'am.

1303
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:19,083
It's very difficult to reach there. - But we'll go.

1304
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,750
The road is dug up. - We'll go there.

1305
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,750
What happened?

1306
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,333
Stomach-ache!

1307
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,625
Then how will you go? - We'll go with you. - Yes.

1308
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,708
But who will drive the car? - We'll hire a taxi.

1309
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,958
Sir, please come to our hotel to take us.

1310
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:35,125
Okay. - Please. Bye.

1311
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:38,166
Okay.

1312
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:40,416
You fool! What will happen now?

1313
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:46,375
You trapped me. - In love, you get trapped like this.

1314
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:50,250
Let's go find a solution. - Okay.

1315
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:52,500
Greeting, Sumita. - You've come?

1316
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,416
Your Pritam compelled me.

1317
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:58,291
He likes you very much. - Where is Pritam?

1318
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:00,416
He had a stomach ache and headache too.

1319
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:02,041
He went to a doctor for treatment.

1320
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:03,333
Come.

1321
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:05,083
I want to say something, ma'am.

1322
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:07,166
This driver is a little crazy.

1323
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:10,291
I was helpless as all the drivers are high on holidays.

1324
01:21:10,791 --> 01:21:14,541
They refused to come. So I hired this crazy driver.

1325
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,500
Sumi, thank you. I'll not come.

1326
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,041
Don't worry. Bhisan Singh is with us.

1327
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,833
Come on. - No. - Please.

1328
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,750
No. - Come on.

1329
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,833
Come on.

1330
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,541
Come on.

1331
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:30,541
Sit there.

1332
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:39,750
God!

1333
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,458
Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Greetings

1334
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:49,208
Where do you want to go?

1335
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:56,416
Kushiwan. - Kushiwan!

1336
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:58,375
Can I drive now? - Yes.

1337
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:02,375
Come on. - Okay. I'll drive.

1338
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,375
Why are you going to Kushiwan, sir?

1339
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:12,500
We're going to watch a musical programme.

1340
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,500
You're going so far for a song. I can sing for you here.

1341
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,291
May I sing for you? - Don't talk to him.

1342
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:20,791
You can sing. - Listen.

1343
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:24,625
"My dream-girl, when will you come?"

1344
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:29,708
"Time is fleeting, when will you come?"

1345
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:32,166
How was the song, sir?

1346
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,541
Very good. - May I continue?

1347
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:40,583
We heard your song. Now drive the vehicle properly.

1348
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:42,500
Ma'am. - What?

1349
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,958
Why are you quiet?

1350
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:45,875
We're not quite, we're talking.

1351
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:49,708
Did you hear, sir? - I did.

1352
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:51,375
Why didn't I hear?

1353
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:55,250
Your ears are covered with hair so you couldn't hear.

1354
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,875
Okay. May I comb it up? - Do it. No!

1355
01:22:58,375 --> 01:23:01,875
Don't do it. Crazy!

1356
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:05,375
You'll get us in trouble! Stop it.

1357
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,875
What did you say? You called me crazy?

1358
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:09,416
Get down from my vehicle. - No!

1359
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:11,208
You called me crazy. - No!

1360
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:13,541
Get out, all of you.

1361
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:15,625
I'll show you! - No! - Where is my dagger? - No.

1362
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:18,250
What are you doing? - Dagger.

1363
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,500
No! Don't take out your dagger.

1364
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,875
It's not coming out. I'll take you to the police station.

1365
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,666
If you do that, the matter will get worse.

1366
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:29,125
Please calm down. - Okay. I will.

1367
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:31,958
But I won't go to Kushiwan. - Why not?

1368
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:34,250
First you called me crazy and now you're questioning me.

1369
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:37,500
It's chaotic here. God knows what will happen there.

1370
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,541
Take us to a hotel and don't quarrel, brother. Please.

1371
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:42,125
I had warned you beforehand. Driver, take us to the hotel. - Yes.

1372
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:45,083
But listen. I'll take 'Full Fair' from Kushiyan to the hotel.

1373
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:48,333
You can take everything, but take us to..

1374
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:49,833
I want 'Full Fair.'

1375
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:52,000
We'll give it you. - Money.

1376
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:56,291
You mean money? We'll pay you, but take us to the hotel.

1377
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:59,083
Sit down! Abusing me! - I told you he's dangerous.

1378
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:02,458
I'll show who is crazy. Your family is crazy.

1379
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:06,250
Come on.

1380
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,833
Hello. Who?

1381
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,666
Yes. Just a minute.

1382
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:15,416
Please hold. Sumi, good news. Mr. Sanjay is on the line.

1383
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,166
Come soon. - What? - Mr. Sanjay.

1384
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:19,125
Hello. Mr. Sanjay.

1385
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:22,041
Yes, Sumita speaking.

1386
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:25,750
My secretary told me you wanted to meet me?

1387
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:30,208
Yes. Mr. Sanjay, where can I meet you? Please.

1388
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:33,708
You don't know how much I love you.

1389
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,708
You too don't know how much I love you.

1390
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,500
What did you say?

1391
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,666
Yes, Sumita. I love you very much.

1392
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:47,875
Have you seen me? - Yes.

1393
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:53,166
But I've not. - Actually, a wall of glass is between us.

1394
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:58,041
We're on either sides of that wall.

1395
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:02,541
Only difference is that I can see you from my side..

1396
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:05,791
..but you can't from your side.

1397
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:07,791
I didn't understand you.

1398
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:09,541
If you want to understand..

1399
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:12,750
..come to the tea estate in front of the hotel tomorrow.

1400
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,708
I'll wait for you. - I will come.

1401
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:19,708
Will you meet me? - I'll definitely meet you.

1402
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,000
Mr. Sanjay.

1403
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:02,625
"Come."

1404
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:19,125
"Come."

1405
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:24,583
"Come."

1406
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:33,666
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1407
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:42,541
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1408
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:48,958
"All of a sudden, the weather has become romantic."

1409
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:57,458
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1410
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:07,083
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1411
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:11,083
"Come."

1412
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:34,500
"I'm waiting for you to meet me."

1413
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:43,291
"I've made a world of dreams as I wait for you."

1414
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:52,208
"I'm waiting for you to meet me."

1415
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:59,458
"I've made a world of dreams as I wait for you."

1416
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:06,166
"Without seeing you, I do not like anything around me."

1417
01:28:06,666 --> 01:28:14,833
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1418
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:18,833
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1419
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:54,666
"My heart beats for you. How should I explain it?"

1420
01:28:55,166 --> 01:29:03,375
"Should I meet you or should I go without meeting you?"

1421
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:12,291
"My heart beats for you. How should I explain it?"

1422
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:19,500
"Should I meet you or should I go without meeting you?"

1423
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,333
"If you'll break this heart.."

1424
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:26,041
"..the whole world will mock me."

1425
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:34,291
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1426
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:43,666
"My heart calls out to you in restlessness."

1427
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:49,416
"Come."

1428
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:53,416
"Come."

1429
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,833
Brother, you've returned.

1430
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:19,125
Did you talk to Sumita?

1431
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:23,083
Why? - For a moment, overwhelmed with emotion..

1432
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:26,500
..I thought of disclosing everything.

1433
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,166
But then I recollected my promise made to dad.

1434
01:30:31,666 --> 01:30:34,708
I thought, if I disclose everything to her..

1435
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:37,708
..I'll have to tell her that I'm Arun..

1436
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,708
..son of Mr. R. K. Chaudhary.

1437
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:41,708
So what?

1438
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:44,000
You don't understand.

1439
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,541
I know Sumita very well.

1440
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:50,541
She'll not understand my dilemma.

1441
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:52,791
Then..

1442
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:56,625
..the ambition of my life isn't Sumita..

1443
01:30:57,125 --> 01:31:01,583
..but my music and my friend's life.

1444
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:06,041
He hasn't written for many days.

1445
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:10,041
I don't know how he is at present.

1446
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:23,000
Take your medicine, son.

1447
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,750
No, Mom. I can't take this medicine, which is like poison.

1448
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:30,541
How will you get better if you don't take medicine? Take it.

1449
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:34,291
You know..

1450
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:39,500
..today when I saw a corpse being cremated..

1451
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,541
..I felt, very soon..

1452
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:48,291
..I'll be bidding farewell to this world.

1453
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:52,041
No, son. Don't talk like that.

1454
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:55,083
If a son gives up hope..

1455
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:58,250
..then what will be the plight of his mother?

1456
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,500
It's the truth, Mom.

1457
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,958
A man takes birth to die someday. - Yes.

1458
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:10,291
My husband died after my marriage.

1459
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:14,833
Now, my son, though grown-up, is talking about dying.

1460
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:19,333
I don't know when I'll die. - No, Mom.

1461
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:23,333
Take medicine, son.

1462
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,250
Your blood pressure is normal.

1463
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,625
If everything is normal, why isn't she normal?

1464
01:32:30,125 --> 01:32:35,291
Sir, only her son and not doctors, can treat her.

1465
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:38,875
Don't feel bad. The doctor can prescribe medicines..

1466
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:41,791
..but he can't return a son to his mother.

1467
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:45,791
Bring Arun home anyhow. She'll be cured.

1468
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:56,166
How come Pritam's photo is with Mr. Chaudhary's letter?

1469
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:06,625
Respectable Ramesh Chandra. Greetings.

1470
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:13,125
I wrote a letter to you earlier, but it was not replied to.

1471
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,291
I'm writing to you considering you my own.

1472
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:18,666
So I want you to keep its contents a secret.

1473
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:21,000
My son Arun..

1474
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,541
..left the house after a quarrel.

1475
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:27,708
I've found out that he sings songs..

1476
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:31,041
..on Calcutta Radio as Sanjay.

1477
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:34,625
To recognise him easily I'm sending his photo.

1478
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:38,625
Sending his photo?

1479
01:33:42,041 --> 01:33:44,291
It may be a bit of a bother, but try to find out about him..

1480
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:46,875
..and write to me. Expecting a reply.

1481
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:48,750
Is anybody there? - What, grandpa?

1482
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,708
Not you, child. Ask Bholu to come here.

1483
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:56,375
Bholu, grandpa is calling you.

1484
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:59,458
So you were fooling me. - Whose letter is it, grandpa?

1485
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:07,375
My friend's. But you call Bholu. - He's coming.

1486
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,708
Yes, sir. - Where is Pritam?

1487
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:11,500
Sir, Pritam has gone. - Gone?

1488
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,958
You keep quiet.

1489
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:15,125
Why? - Sir. His wife died.

1490
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:17,625
Wife died? - Wife!

1491
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:18,666
His wife died?

1492
01:34:19,166 --> 01:34:20,791
Amazing!

1493
01:34:21,291 --> 01:34:23,166
For a job, you lied about a wife..

1494
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:27,458
..and to quit the job you faked her death.

1495
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:30,625
I quit the job as it was futile.

1496
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:32,125
Sumita won't understand me.

1497
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:35,000
Don't worry, I'll explain it to her.

1498
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:38,208
No. While solving one problem more problems will crop up.

1499
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:39,791
It's not worth it.

1500
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:43,166
Sir has come. - Let him come.

1501
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:44,583
Sir has come? Where is he?

1502
01:34:45,083 --> 01:34:46,666
He's sitting in the car. I'll call him here. - Car?

1503
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:48,625
Listen, Bholu. Oh God!

1504
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:50,250
Now what?

1505
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:53,291
Everything will be fine. - Fine?

1506
01:34:53,791 --> 01:34:56,250
Sister-in-law, help me and please agree with me.

1507
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,625
I'll not. I'll reveal everything.

1508
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:03,625
Come, sir. This is the house.

1509
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:11,125
Don't cry, brother. Stop crying now.

1510
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:16,208
Don't cry. It happens sometimes.

1511
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:20,541
Pritam. - Greetings, sir.

1512
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:25,041
Sir, you?

1513
01:35:25,541 --> 01:35:29,083
Greetings!

1514
01:35:29,583 --> 01:35:36,166
Pritam, I offer you my condolences for your wife's death.

1515
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:39,583
Death? Yes.

1516
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:41,541
What should I say, sir?

1517
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:44,375
It's a grave injustice.

1518
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:47,541
I understand it.

1519
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:52,541
Junkie, don't just stare. Get a chair.

1520
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:57,000
Hurry up! - Okay, brother.

1521
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,416
He is always high.

1522
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,625
Now tell me.

1523
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:05,333
I asked for a chair for him.

1524
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:08,958
You fool! Get up.

1525
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:12,416
Sir, have a seat. - Okay.

1526
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:15,916
You too sit, Pritam.

1527
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:20,250
Sit on the cot. - No. I'll sit at your feet.

1528
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,375
Fine.

1529
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:26,125
Your two children may be all alone now?

1530
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:28,916
No, but they're with their uncle.

1531
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,791
They reached their uncle? -Yes.

1532
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:34,333
But where can I go?

1533
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:37,125
I've realised just now..

1534
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,916
..that a wife proves to be a bane for a man.

1535
01:36:40,416 --> 01:36:43,541
Indeed! Wife is a bane.

1536
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:47,916
Bane? - No. A wife proves to be a boon.

1537
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:50,791
Yes. She is a boon.

1538
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:54,041
I've realised this after my wife's death.

1539
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:58,041
One realises it only after the wife's death.

1540
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:11,041
Why is he crying? - Don't know.

1541
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:13,250
Junkie! Why are you crying?

1542
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:16,458
Wife died. - His wife died too.

1543
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:21,500
No, sir. You fool! Your wife hasn't died. Get up.

1544
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,500
I thought my wife died. - No.

1545
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:38,291
He is totally insane!

1546
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:48,833
You're a man, Pritam. Why are you crying?

1547
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:51,583
You can marry as many times as you want. - No, sir.

1548
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:53,875
I don't want to marry now.

1549
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,750
You have to marry.

1550
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:59,541
I mean, you're not old.

1551
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,041
Pritam Nath Goyal. - Ghayal.

1552
01:38:02,541 --> 01:38:05,333
Ghayal, I remember an old song.

1553
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:13,291
'A grief-stricken knows his state, not others.' - Good one.

1554
01:38:13,791 --> 01:38:16,291
It may be good or bad, but you have to remarry.

1555
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:18,125
Sir, no second marriage.

1556
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:21,541
There is a gardener's sister-in-law in our neighbourhood.

1557
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:23,250
Gardener's sister-in-law?

1558
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:25,333
She is a widow with two children.

1559
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:28,500
A widow with two children? -You'll have four kids.

1560
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,583
Lucky ones get a chance to marry a mother of kids.

1561
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:34,416
I have to marry a mother of kids?

1562
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:38,458
What's wrong with it? - What am I hearing? Bhisan Singh.

1563
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:42,541
You better be quiet. - Correct.

1564
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:45,416
It's better for you to keep quiet.

1565
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:48,791
I know the grief of losing a wife.

1566
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:51,208
So I'll not let you live alone.

1567
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:53,708
I'm fine this way. - No. Get up.

1568
01:38:54,208 --> 01:38:56,541
No. - Get up!

1569
01:38:57,041 --> 01:39:01,291
Come. - Bhisan Singh. - Don't look back. March ahead.

1570
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:04,333
Bhisan Singh. - Did you see Manjeet?

1571
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:06,333
Some people, while trying to fool others..

1572
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:10,083
..get so entangled in it that they don't find a way out.

1573
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:11,708
Correct, dear.

1574
01:39:12,208 --> 01:39:15,333
I warned him not to play tricks, but he didn't listen.

1575
01:39:15,833 --> 01:39:18,875
Why are you taking me inside? - You'll find out.

1576
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:23,541
Sumi, I brought him. - I feel sorry for your wife's death.

1577
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,916
I feel sorry.

1578
01:39:26,416 --> 01:39:27,458
Don't cry.

1579
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:30,250
Why do you feel sorry? We'll get him remarried.

1580
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:33,125
No, sir. I don't want to remarry. - Keep quiet.

1581
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:35,500
You know Ram Khilavan, the neighbour's gardener.

1582
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,333
We'll get him married with his wife's sister.

1583
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:40,916
She has two kids? - Eight years and ten years old.

1584
01:39:41,416 --> 01:39:44,041
Please save me, ma'am. - Pritam Nath Goyal.

1585
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:45,791
Don't lose heart. Come with me. - Where?

1586
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,291
Come. - First listen to me.

1587
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:50,791
Get in. Bholu, get one lock for the room. - A lock?

1588
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,916
Get in. - I'll give it to you, Bholu.

1589
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:55,750
But.. - Listen.

1590
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,666
You'll be locked in this room. - Am I a thief?

1591
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:04,666
No. You'll be locked till you remarry. - Strange compulsion!

1592
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,250
It's a compulsion. - Here is a lock, sir.

1593
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:10,458
Let's lock it. - Sir, don't lock me inside.

1594
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:12,750
I'll not go anywhere. - Promise.

1595
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:14,000
Yes. - Sit down.

1596
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:18,666
Okay. - If you flee, I'll nab you anyhow. Got it?

1597
01:40:19,166 --> 01:40:22,666
Yes. - Bholuram, look after him. I have to make a trunk call.

1598
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:29,791
What are you doing? - Sir told me to look after you.

1599
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,916
Impostor.

1600
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,083
Trunks?

1601
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:37,541
This is 46227. I want Lucknow.

1602
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:41,625
4590, P.P. R. K. Chaudhary.

1603
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:45,166
Yes. No, lightning. Thanks.

1604
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,250
Bholuram, is there a way to go out?

1605
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,541
Yes, sir. - Where is it? - There.

1606
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:53,541
Impostor! Is there any other way out? - I'll check.

1607
01:40:56,208 --> 01:41:00,166
Sir, where are you going? Sir has fled.

1608
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:03,208
Sir, sir fled.

1609
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:06,958
Which sir fled? - Mr. Pritam.

1610
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:10,583
Let him flee. You too run away. - Okay.

1611
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:12,666
Where can he go?

1612
01:41:13,166 --> 01:41:15,500
Thank God you came. I was coming to you.

1613
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,708
If Sumita's grandpa asks for me, tell him I don't stay here.

1614
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:24,916
Aunt, when did you come?

1615
01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:27,250
Today, by the noon train. - Shrikant is here too.

1616
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:31,250
Where is he? - In the room.

1617
01:41:35,083 --> 01:41:38,500
Hey, poet.

1618
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,666
Poet.

1619
01:41:43,166 --> 01:41:45,958
What happened? - Nothing.

1620
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:51,291
Nothing? Look at your face.

1621
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:53,625
Sit down. I had a long journey.

1622
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:56,500
Journey? - Yes, that's why you feel this way.

1623
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,125
Tell me about yourself.

1624
01:41:58,625 --> 01:41:59,500
I'm fine. But..

1625
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,875
Arun. Look what I've written for you..

1626
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:10,250
'Anurodh' (request). Dedicated to Arun, the soul of these songs. Shri.

1627
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:13,583
For me? - Yes. On your request I've written the songs.

1628
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:17,291
So it's yours, not mine.

1629
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:21,750
Bhisan Singh, look. This is called a friend.

1630
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:23,375
Come here.

1631
01:42:23,875 --> 01:42:26,458
Look at this book dedicated to me.

1632
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:28,958
It's in Hindi. Can you read?

1633
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:33,166
Brother, celebrate it with tea. - Very good.

1634
01:42:33,666 --> 01:42:37,333
I missed you a lot. Today we'll talk a lot.

1635
01:42:37,833 --> 01:42:40,958
Let Shrikant rest for awhile. I want to talk to you. Come out.

1636
01:42:41,458 --> 01:42:43,000
Sit here.

1637
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,208
After meeting you, I don't need any rest. - Okay.

1638
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:47,333
Brother, one minute. - Okay.

1639
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:51,333
Now take rest. I'll just come. - Arun.

1640
01:43:00,166 --> 01:43:03,833
Actually Shrikant.. - Shrikant..

1641
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:09,500
Aunt, I didn't ask him, but what is wrong with Shrikant?

1642
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,583
He kept hiding his disease.

1643
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:21,291
I found out that he has tuberculosis.

1644
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:26,083
Tuberculosis? - It's at the last stage.

1645
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:33,791
But..It means that he kept lying to me.

1646
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:36,458
Yes.

1647
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:39,375
He was not even ready to come here.

1648
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:42,000
I brought him with great difficulty.

1649
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:45,583
The doctors in Lucknow said..

1650
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:49,208
..Shrikant's one lung has collapsed completely.

1651
01:43:49,708 --> 01:43:52,041
Completely collapsed? - Yes.

1652
01:43:52,541 --> 01:43:56,041
Operation is the only option for him.

1653
01:44:09,375 --> 01:44:11,125
Come. Sit down.

1654
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:15,125
No.

1655
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:25,125
So you found out? - Why did you write lies?

1656
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:28,500
I knew if you found out..

1657
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,166
..you would be very upset.

1658
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:37,833
Silly! Had you been in my place..

1659
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:39,875
..you would've done the same thing.

1660
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:42,208
Sit.

1661
01:44:42,708 --> 01:44:44,500
You shouldn't get upset over trivial matters.

1662
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,166
Why should I get angry? Who am I to you?

1663
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:50,708
You?

1664
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:53,958
You're to me, what I'm to you.

1665
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:57,041
You can't belong to anyone as you've cheated even yourself.

1666
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:58,375
Look at yourself.

1667
01:44:58,875 --> 01:45:00,916
To become someone's own..

1668
01:45:01,416 --> 01:45:03,458
..we need to share joy and sorrow with each other.

1669
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:06,458
But you kept everything with you.

1670
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:08,750
What do you think of yourself?

1671
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:11,208
You wrote that you're fine and healthy.

1672
01:45:11,708 --> 01:45:16,166
If it was so, what is this?

1673
01:45:16,666 --> 01:45:21,208
Shrikant, you think that after your death, the world will change.

1674
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:22,416
There won't be any change.

1675
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,583
The world will forget you within two days.

1676
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:29,458
I say instead of tomorrow, die today.

1677
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:32,291
Arun!

1678
01:45:32,791 --> 01:45:39,250
People like me are destined to die every moment.

1679
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,500
Death never strikes with a single blow.

1680
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,833
Death has gradually overpowered me to an extent..

1681
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:55,041
..that today I even doubt if I'm alive or not.

1682
01:45:55,541 --> 01:46:00,041
Forgive me, my friend.

1683
01:46:00,541 --> 01:46:03,666
My friend.

1684
01:46:04,166 --> 01:46:06,375
Why did you do it?

1685
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:12,250
You thought of me as a stranger.

1686
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:16,250
I'll never forgive you. Never.

1687
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:57,125
Don't worry. You'll be completely cured.

1688
01:46:57,625 --> 01:47:01,125
Come, Dr. Lewis.

1689
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:07,791
Wait a minute. I'll call you.

1690
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:17,125
Okay, Dr. Lewis. I'll see you tomorrow. - Sure.

1691
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:22,083
Bye. - Bye.

1692
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,916
Come with me.

1693
01:47:25,416 --> 01:47:30,250
Wait here. I'll be back.

1694
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:33,458
Sit. You're very lucky.

1695
01:47:33,958 --> 01:47:39,458
World's best surgeon, Dr. Lewis, is in India for ten days.

1696
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:43,166
He's ready to operate.

1697
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,083
Doctor. - Yes?

1698
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:46,333
Can I ask one question?

1699
01:47:46,833 --> 01:47:49,833
How much money is needed for the operation?

1700
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:56,041
Rs.20 to 25,000 including all the expenses.

1701
01:47:56,541 --> 01:48:00,041
Rs.20 to 25,000?

1702
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,625
I know it is a big amount.

1703
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:10,500
But this is a golden chance to save your friend's life.

1704
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,791
You must avail of this opportunity.

1705
01:48:14,291 --> 01:48:16,583
Yes, doctor. I will.

1706
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:19,000
I'll avail of this opportunity.

1707
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,708
I'll meet you soon.

1708
01:48:23,208 --> 01:48:26,708
Now sleep comfortably.

1709
01:48:32,166 --> 01:48:36,958
I'm creating problems for everyone.

1710
01:48:37,458 --> 01:48:40,083
Silly! I discussed it in detail with the doctor.

1711
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:44,083
Do you know what he said? He said you'll be fine soon.

1712
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:04,125
How will the operation be arranged?

1713
01:49:04,625 --> 01:49:08,375
Rs.25,000?

1714
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:12,458
From where should I get it?

1715
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:15,291
Whom should I approach?

1716
01:49:15,791 --> 01:49:19,291
Who will give Rs.25,000?

1717
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:34,541
'I hate the sight of a stopped clock.'

1718
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:38,541
'It seems as if someone's heart has stopped.'

1719
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:51,250
Bhisan Singh! Look, the clock has stopped.

1720
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:53,333
It has stopped. Wind the clock quickly.

1721
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:56,625
Look, it has stopped.

1722
01:49:57,125 --> 01:50:00,625
No, dear. The clock is running.

1723
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:10,333
The clock is running.

1724
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:18,291
I thought it stopped.

1725
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:21,541
No, brother. Don't worry.

1726
01:50:22,041 --> 01:50:26,458
I'll sell my garage and all my household articles.

1727
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:30,250
Shrikant's operation will surely go forward.

1728
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:33,000
You take my bracelets, brother.

1729
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:37,000
With that money.. - No, sister-in-law.

1730
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,791
These are women's adornments!

1731
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:44,791
I'll arrange the money anyhow.

1732
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:03,208
God! You know..

1733
01:51:03,708 --> 01:51:06,500
..what a son means to a mother?

1734
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,583
Take my life instead of my son's life.

1735
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:14,708
In my unfortunate life there is nobody except Shrikant.

1736
01:51:15,208 --> 01:51:17,791
Don't take him away, Lord.

1737
01:51:18,291 --> 01:51:22,583
Don't take him away.

1738
01:51:23,083 --> 01:51:25,500
He's everything for me.

1739
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,500
He's everything for me. Don't take him away.

1740
01:51:55,166 --> 01:52:00,333
Whatever you wanted to avoid has finally happened.

1741
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:04,333
You've made everybody's life miserable.

1742
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:19,166
Bhisan Singh, where is Shrikant?

1743
01:52:19,666 --> 01:52:21,750
Is he in your room? - No.

1744
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:25,708
Where is he? - I'll look in the garage.

1745
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:28,208
Aunt. - What is it?

1746
01:52:28,708 --> 01:52:32,708
Where is Shrikant? - Isn't he in his room?

1747
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:36,166
No. - He's not in the garage, brother.

1748
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:37,791
Where did he go?

1749
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:40,625
Has anything.. - No.

1750
01:52:41,125 --> 01:52:44,416
He must've gone for a walk. I'll check.

1751
01:52:44,916 --> 01:52:48,416
Aunt, don't worry. Nothing will happen.

1752
01:53:11,791 --> 01:53:18,333
"If you're without support.."

1753
01:53:18,833 --> 01:53:29,625
"..become someone else's support."

1754
01:53:30,125 --> 01:53:36,000
"You won't be without support any more."

1755
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:39,958
"If you come by a boat near the shore.."

1756
01:53:40,458 --> 01:53:47,458
"..you'll find your destination too."

1757
01:53:47,958 --> 01:53:51,416
"If you're without support.."

1758
01:53:51,916 --> 01:53:56,041
"..become someone else's support."

1759
01:53:56,541 --> 01:54:00,041
"If you're without support.."

1760
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:29,958
"We have to live our life smiling."

1761
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:35,416
"We have to confront our sorrows."

1762
01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:41,041
"However long the path is.."

1763
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:46,708
"..the river has to flow."

1764
01:54:47,208 --> 01:54:53,166
"Even if you're alone, move ahead without stopping."

1765
01:54:53,666 --> 01:54:58,833
"You'll get a friend on the way."

1766
01:54:59,333 --> 01:55:02,791
"If you're without support.."

1767
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:07,333
"..become someone else's support."

1768
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:11,333
"If you're without support.."

1769
01:55:30,125 --> 01:55:35,125
"Neither in towns nor in solitude."

1770
01:55:35,625 --> 01:55:41,041
"Neither in fields nor at farms."

1771
01:55:41,541 --> 01:55:46,166
"You can neither buy love.."

1772
01:55:46,666 --> 01:55:51,833
"..nor peace from any place."

1773
01:55:52,333 --> 01:55:58,208
"Don't look outside to find your dear ones."

1774
01:55:58,708 --> 01:56:03,916
"If you look within your heart, you'll find your loving friend."

1775
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:07,750
"If you're without support.."

1776
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:12,416
"..become someone else's support."

1777
01:56:12,916 --> 01:56:16,416
"If you're without support.."

1778
01:56:25,916 --> 01:56:27,333
Greetings.

1779
01:56:27,833 --> 01:56:30,125
Who are you? - I am..

1780
01:56:30,625 --> 01:56:34,000
I was passing by. I stopped after hearing your song.

1781
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,375
I see. That is the greatness of this song.

1782
01:56:37,875 --> 01:56:40,291
It stops us and teaches us beautifully..

1783
01:56:40,791 --> 01:56:43,208
..to learn to live our life.

1784
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:45,750
You're right.

1785
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:49,000
I strayed for awhile.

1786
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:52,791
After hearing the song, I seem to have found my path.

1787
01:56:53,291 --> 01:56:54,583
What's wrong? Any difficulty?

1788
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:59,083
There are difficulties, but..

1789
01:56:59,583 --> 01:57:04,000
Destiny has endowed us with joy and sorrows. This is life.

1790
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,750
Yes. - If you face any problem..

1791
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:09,791
..read this song. It'll help you overcome them.

1792
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:12,500
I'll write it for you. - I know this song.

1793
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
You know? - Yes.

1794
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,208
I wrote this song many years ago.

1795
01:57:17,708 --> 01:57:21,166
I see, what is your name? - Shrikant.

1796
01:57:21,666 --> 01:57:24,250
Children, he's the same poet..

1797
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:26,250
..who wrote this song that we sing here.

1798
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:29,625
Greet him. - Greetings. - Greetings.

1799
01:57:30,125 --> 01:57:32,666
We're pleased to meet you. - Brother.

1800
01:57:33,166 --> 01:57:34,875
Grandpa always praises this song, saying..

1801
01:57:35,375 --> 01:57:38,208
..its poet has to be very great.

1802
01:57:38,708 --> 01:57:40,583
This is your grandpa's greatness..

1803
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:43,500
..as he respects even those younger to him.

1804
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I wrote that song, but I forgot it.

1805
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:51,291
But today after hearing it, I felt that..

1806
01:57:51,791 --> 01:57:56,166
..you've united me with it after many years.

1807
01:57:56,666 --> 01:58:00,125
Bless you. Always write such beautiful songs.

1808
01:58:00,625 --> 01:58:02,041
God bless you!

1809
01:58:02,541 --> 01:58:03,791
Bye. - Greetings.

1810
01:58:04,291 --> 01:58:07,791
Greetings.

1811
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:14,875
Shrikant!

1812
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:31,916
Where were you?

1813
01:58:32,416 --> 01:58:34,291
Where?

1814
01:58:34,791 --> 01:58:37,250
Do you know everybody at home?

1815
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:40,208
Come on.

1816
01:58:40,708 --> 01:58:43,458
Let's go home.

1817
01:58:43,958 --> 01:58:45,958
Come, Sanjay. Arranged something?

1818
01:58:46,458 --> 01:58:48,458
No, sir. I don't know what to do.

1819
01:58:48,958 --> 01:58:52,333
Whom should I approach to get the money?

1820
01:58:52,833 --> 01:58:54,375
Okay. First sit down. Sit.

1821
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:55,958
There is one option.

1822
01:58:56,458 --> 01:59:00,166
I had even told you earlier. You're very popular.

1823
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:02,500
People love your songs.

1824
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,833
But still you insist that you won't perform in public.

1825
01:59:07,333 --> 01:59:11,416
I suggest you sing on stage before an audience.

1826
01:59:11,916 --> 01:59:13,625
Then you'll see how much money you get.

1827
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:16,958
I request you to sing on stage.

1828
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:20,333
I'll surely sing in front of the public.

1829
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:23,458
But Sumita will find out. - I know it.

1830
01:59:23,958 --> 01:59:25,375
If she misunderstands me, let it be.

1831
01:59:25,875 --> 01:59:27,166
If she leaves me, let her go.

1832
01:59:27,666 --> 01:59:28,833
If dad feels bad, let him feel it.

1833
01:59:29,333 --> 01:59:32,541
Right now I only care for Shri's life.

1834
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:35,666
I'll break all my promises for his life.

1835
01:59:36,166 --> 01:59:40,000
Let's start the publicity for the show.

1836
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:43,958
You're right, sir. You're absolutely right.

1837
01:59:44,458 --> 01:59:50,083
Bhishan Singh, my mom gave me this locket. Sell it and..

1838
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:51,791
No, brother. I'll not let you sell it.

1839
01:59:52,291 --> 01:59:53,416
Just do as I say.

1840
01:59:53,916 --> 01:59:55,291
We don't have much time.

1841
01:59:55,791 --> 01:59:59,291
Put up the posters for the show around the entire city.

1842
02:00:10,333 --> 02:00:13,833
'Sanjay Nite.'

1843
02:00:46,875 --> 02:00:50,041
Grandpa, look. Sanjay will sing on stage.

1844
02:00:50,541 --> 02:00:54,541
Wow! - I'll get to see him face to face.

1845
02:00:55,041 --> 02:00:58,541
I'll also look at your beloved face to face. - Stop it.

1846
02:01:06,916 --> 02:01:08,291
Doctor, this is Rs.15,000.

1847
02:01:08,791 --> 02:01:10,416
I'll pay the rest within a day or two.

1848
02:01:10,916 --> 02:01:13,916
Very good.

1849
02:01:14,416 --> 02:01:16,375
We can operate on the 20th.

1850
02:01:16,875 --> 02:01:18,166
20th? Very good.

1851
02:01:18,666 --> 02:01:21,750
I have some work on 19th, but I'm free on the 20th.

1852
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:26,333
But you have to admit the patient on the morning of 19th.

1853
02:01:26,833 --> 02:01:29,625
Morning of the 19th? - Is there any problem?

1854
02:01:30,125 --> 02:01:31,833
No problem.

1855
02:01:32,333 --> 02:01:36,125
The case is very serious and we shouldn't postpone it.

1856
02:01:36,625 --> 02:01:40,125
Okay. We'll admit Shrikant on the 19th.

1857
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:01,833
Look, Sushma. Get down.

1858
02:02:02,333 --> 02:02:04,583
You came to Calcutta on the day of your son's show.

1859
02:02:05,083 --> 02:02:08,583
Get down.

1860
02:02:15,041 --> 02:02:18,000
It's really nice. I'll surely go to watch the show.

1861
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:22,000
Certainly! Mr. Chaudhary and I will also come.

1862
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,000
Doctor, this patient has been admitted in the morning.

1863
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,125
Since then he is coughing continuously.

1864
02:02:27,625 --> 02:02:29,375
He isn't responding to any treatment.

1865
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:34,083
Let me see.

1866
02:02:34,583 --> 02:02:36,458
Dr. Lewis.

1867
02:02:36,958 --> 02:02:38,500
Oh God!

1868
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,375
He's still coughing. Now what will happen?

1869
02:02:43,875 --> 02:02:44,833
Shrikant.

1870
02:02:45,333 --> 02:02:48,833
Lie down. Relax.

1871
02:03:06,083 --> 02:03:07,333
Relax, my son. Take it easy.

1872
02:03:07,833 --> 02:03:09,750
You'll be all right.

1873
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:15,250
Doctor, come with me. - Sister, help him sit.

1874
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:19,000
Yes, doctor? - Dr. Sen, his condition is not at all good.

1875
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:22,708
Send for the anesthetist. I'll operate immediately. - Okay.

1876
02:03:23,208 --> 02:03:25,916
Mrs. Mathur, Shrikant's condition worsened suddenly.

1877
02:03:26,416 --> 02:03:27,541
We have to operate on him immediately.

1878
02:03:28,041 --> 02:03:29,000
Now? - It's an emergency case.

1879
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,416
Come with me. You wait here.

1880
02:03:31,916 --> 02:03:34,500
Come.

1881
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,416
Before the operation, the guardian has to sign a consent letter.

1882
02:03:38,916 --> 02:03:41,750
That.. - Don't worry. It's just a formality.

1883
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:45,750
Sit down.

1884
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:49,750
Here.

1885
02:03:51,125 --> 02:03:54,208
Will my son survive, doctor?

1886
02:03:54,708 --> 02:03:56,875
He's the only one I have after my husband's death.

1887
02:03:57,375 --> 02:04:01,250
Have patience. We'll try our best.

1888
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:04,750
Please don't cry.

1889
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:08,500
I'm crying on my misfortune.

1890
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,791
The British shot my husband in his youth.

1891
02:04:14,291 --> 02:04:16,750
He was martyred for the country.

1892
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:18,916
Now, my son..

1893
02:04:19,416 --> 02:04:24,416
What is your husband's name? - Anand Mathur.

1894
02:04:24,916 --> 02:04:31,250
Anand Mathur? It sounds familiar.

1895
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:36,208
What did you say? He was martyred for the country.

1896
02:04:36,708 --> 02:04:40,583
Yes. - Now I recollect.

1897
02:04:41,083 --> 02:04:43,458
So you're Anand Mathur's wife?

1898
02:04:43,958 --> 02:04:45,291
Yes.

1899
02:04:45,791 --> 02:04:49,291
Yes. - Sit outside. I'll just come.

1900
02:05:05,583 --> 02:05:07,583
I had a small wish.

1901
02:05:08,083 --> 02:05:12,083
I wished to hear your song for the last time.

1902
02:05:12,583 --> 02:05:14,125
But..

1903
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:16,291
Don't say that.

1904
02:05:16,791 --> 02:05:20,791
When you recover I'll sing many songs for you.

1905
02:05:21,291 --> 02:05:24,916
Okay. Leave now. You're always late.

1906
02:05:25,416 --> 02:05:26,833
I'll go.

1907
02:05:27,333 --> 02:05:32,833
Don't worry about me. The show should be great.

1908
02:05:33,333 --> 02:05:37,208
It'll be great. Don't worry.

1909
02:05:37,708 --> 02:05:40,125
You go.

1910
02:05:40,625 --> 02:05:42,583
Go.

1911
02:05:43,083 --> 02:05:46,500
Going.

1912
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,416
Mom. - My son.

1913
02:05:51,916 --> 02:05:55,416
No, Mom.

1914
02:06:17,791 --> 02:06:22,083
No, aunt. Don't cry.

1915
02:06:22,583 --> 02:06:25,708
He will be all right.

1916
02:06:26,208 --> 02:06:29,708
Let's go.

1917
02:06:39,541 --> 02:06:41,666
You may go, Arun. I'm fine.

1918
02:06:42,166 --> 02:06:44,541
It's time for your show. - No, aunt!

1919
02:06:45,041 --> 02:06:47,875
I may not be able to sing today. - Silly.

1920
02:06:48,375 --> 02:06:50,041
It's your biggest test today..

1921
02:06:50,541 --> 02:06:53,333
..and you are giving up? - Aunt is right.

1922
02:06:53,833 --> 02:06:57,416
But how can I sing?

1923
02:06:57,916 --> 02:06:59,125
No, Arun. You'll sing.

1924
02:06:59,625 --> 02:07:01,750
Don't worry. With God's grace everything will be fine.

1925
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,083
Come.

1926
02:07:03,583 --> 02:07:07,083
Go, son.

1927
02:07:23,166 --> 02:07:27,875
As soon as the operation gets over, call me.

1928
02:07:28,375 --> 02:07:32,125
Okay? - Yes. Don't worry. Go.

1929
02:07:32,625 --> 02:07:36,125
Go.

1930
02:07:39,833 --> 02:07:42,791
Greetings. - Mr. Sardar, how come you're here?

1931
02:07:43,291 --> 02:07:44,958
Sanjay, your friend has a show today.

1932
02:07:45,458 --> 02:07:46,166
Won't you watch his show?

1933
02:07:46,666 --> 02:07:49,666
Yes, sir. But my other friend Shrikant is getting operated today.

1934
02:07:50,166 --> 02:07:52,541
The one who writes beautiful songs? - Yes, sir.

1935
02:07:53,041 --> 02:07:54,000
Who is operating? Dr. Sen.

1936
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:55,958
Yes. - Then don't worry. He'll be fine.

1937
02:07:56,458 --> 02:07:57,500
May God cure him!

1938
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,791
How come you're here?

1939
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:02,791
No idea. Dr. Sen requested me to come so I..

1940
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:15,083
She's Shrikant's mother.

1941
02:08:22,083 --> 02:08:26,291
Daughter-in-law! - Dad.

1942
02:08:26,791 --> 02:08:30,166
Bless me. - Get up, dear.

1943
02:08:30,666 --> 02:08:33,458
Is Shrikant Anand's son? - Yes.

1944
02:08:33,958 --> 02:08:35,500
What's the disease? - Tuberculosis.

1945
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,041
Tuberculosis? - And it's at the last stage.

1946
02:08:39,541 --> 02:08:43,708
God forbid, if something happens to him.. - Don't worry.

1947
02:08:44,208 --> 02:08:47,708
Nurse.

1948
02:09:18,166 --> 02:09:19,916
Sumi, he's Pritam. - I'm going, Anu.

1949
02:09:20,416 --> 02:09:23,666
Where are you going? Sit.

1950
02:09:24,166 --> 02:09:27,375
Music lovers.

1951
02:09:27,875 --> 02:09:30,291
Today..

1952
02:09:30,791 --> 02:09:35,666
..I'm singing before you for the first time.

1953
02:09:36,166 --> 02:09:39,666
Did you see?

1954
02:09:42,458 --> 02:09:45,041
Friends..

1955
02:09:45,541 --> 02:09:50,250
..I know you're happy to see me among you.

1956
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:53,666
But it's my misfortune..

1957
02:09:54,166 --> 02:09:57,500
..that I'm not in the same situation.

1958
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:04,500
On any another occasion I'd have sung many songs.

1959
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,625
But today I can't do it.

1960
02:10:08,125 --> 02:10:14,416
Shrikant, my friend, is in a critical condition.

1961
02:10:14,916 --> 02:10:21,875
The artiste, who has given many songs and poems..

1962
02:10:22,375 --> 02:10:28,041
..is fighting with death on his own today.

1963
02:10:28,541 --> 02:10:35,833
In this battle for survival, it's possible..

1964
02:10:36,333 --> 02:10:39,041
..that death may succeed..

1965
02:10:39,541 --> 02:10:44,291
..and I may not be able to sing before you again.

1966
02:10:44,791 --> 02:10:49,125
But today Shrikant is alive..

1967
02:10:49,625 --> 02:10:53,125
..and my voice is also alive.

1968
02:10:58,166 --> 02:11:06,041
"Don't laugh at my sorrow."

1969
02:11:06,541 --> 02:11:12,000
"Do justice."

1970
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:16,000
"If I cry, please forgive me."

1971
02:11:31,291 --> 02:11:35,541
"When there was no pain in life.."

1972
02:11:36,041 --> 02:11:40,375
"..life didn't seem worth living."

1973
02:11:40,875 --> 02:11:44,875
"When there was no pain in life.."

1974
02:11:45,375 --> 02:11:50,208
"..life didn't seem worth living."

1975
02:11:50,708 --> 02:11:58,541
"This time, even I might shed tears with the falling rain."

1976
02:11:59,041 --> 02:12:03,208
"When there was no pain in life.."

1977
02:12:03,708 --> 02:12:08,541
"..life didn't seem worth living."

1978
02:12:09,041 --> 02:12:16,791
"This time, even I might shed tears with the falling rain."

1979
02:12:17,291 --> 02:12:21,500
"When there was no pain in life.."

1980
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,500
"..life didn't seem worth living."

1981
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,250
"How does one feel upon losing a friend?"

1982
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:45,666
"How does one feel upon losing a friend?"

1983
02:12:46,166 --> 02:12:50,416
"How does one feel upon losing a friend?"

1984
02:12:50,916 --> 02:12:56,250
"We were oblivious to it."

1985
02:12:56,750 --> 02:13:06,208
"We've always seen hardship from a distance."

1986
02:13:06,708 --> 02:13:14,500
"This time this hardship might even strike us."

1987
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,083
"When there was no pain in life.."

1988
02:13:19,583 --> 02:13:23,083
"..life didn't seem worth living."

1989
02:13:42,625 --> 02:13:46,666
"I never used to feel so bad.."

1990
02:13:47,166 --> 02:13:51,208
"..when our own would get angry."

1991
02:13:51,708 --> 02:13:55,666
"I never used to be so pained.."

1992
02:13:56,166 --> 02:14:00,916
"..when dreams used to shatter."

1993
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:07,583
"This time, even my heart might break."

1994
02:14:08,083 --> 02:14:15,875
"This time, even I might shed tears with the falling rain."

1995
02:14:16,375 --> 02:14:20,541
"When there was no pain in life.."

1996
02:14:21,041 --> 02:14:24,541
"..life didn't seem worth living."

1997
02:14:43,083 --> 02:14:51,416
"No one loves to this extent."

1998
02:14:51,916 --> 02:15:00,208
"No one dies for a departed friend."

1999
02:15:00,708 --> 02:15:09,125
"I'll not come in front of you again."

2000
02:15:09,625 --> 02:15:17,666
"What will I sing if I lose all the songs?"

2001
02:15:18,166 --> 02:15:26,125
"If my voice is dear to you then, friends.."

2002
02:15:26,625 --> 02:15:37,208
"..pray to God to save my friend."

2003
02:15:37,708 --> 02:15:41,208
"Pray to God."

2004
02:16:13,083 --> 02:16:16,250
Mom! - Arun.

2005
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:20,500
Mom!

2006
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,500
Is this the way to harass your parents?

2007
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,500
Look, your daddy has come too.

2008
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:43,041
No, son. Your place isn't at my feet..

2009
02:16:43,541 --> 02:16:47,041
..but in my heart.

2010
02:16:50,541 --> 02:16:54,041
You're going to the hospital? We'll come too.

2011
02:17:01,875 --> 02:17:02,708
Shri.

2012
02:17:03,208 --> 02:17:05,041
Doctor. - I can't say anything.

2013
02:17:05,541 --> 02:17:09,041
During the operation, his pulse stopped for a moment.

2014
02:17:38,333 --> 02:17:39,833
Well, doctor. Everything is set.

2015
02:17:40,333 --> 02:17:43,833
If you need me, give me a ring. - Thank you, doctor.

2016
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:04,250
Aunt.

2017
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:06,250
You've come? - Where is Shrikant?

2018
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:08,333
In the room. - In the room?

2019
02:18:08,833 --> 02:18:11,541
How is Shrikant? - I don't know, sister.

2020
02:18:12,041 --> 02:18:14,375
Mr. Chaudhary, how come you're here?

2021
02:18:14,875 --> 02:18:17,166
And you had a stage show?

2022
02:18:17,666 --> 02:18:20,000
Mr. Mathur, maybe you don't know..

2023
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:25,375
..that he did this show for Shrikant's operation.

2024
02:18:25,875 --> 02:18:28,458
Son. - You?

2025
02:18:28,958 --> 02:18:32,791
I'll be grateful to you for whatever you did for Shrikant.

2026
02:18:33,291 --> 02:18:38,041
Your Arun has reunited me with my family after ages.

2027
02:18:38,541 --> 02:18:40,625
I don't understand. - You don't know that..

2028
02:18:41,125 --> 02:18:42,666
..Radha is my daughter-in-law. - Is it?

2029
02:18:43,166 --> 02:18:44,583
Yes. And I'm Shrikant's grandfather.

2030
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:49,375
Are you Shrikant's grandfather?

2031
02:18:49,875 --> 02:18:52,500
Yes, son. It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

2032
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,500
At this moment, pray for Shrikant's life.

2033
02:19:17,375 --> 02:19:19,625
Mother.

2034
02:19:20,125 --> 02:19:24,583
Where are mother and Arun?

2035
02:19:25,083 --> 02:19:28,583
Outside.

2036
02:19:29,083 --> 02:19:32,583
Call them in.

2037
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:41,833
Shrikant is calling you.

2038
02:19:42,333 --> 02:19:45,583
Not everyone. Only Mrs. Mathur and Arun.

2039
02:19:46,083 --> 02:19:49,583
Mr. Mathur, you may come too.

2040
02:19:58,083 --> 02:20:02,500
Shri. Son!

2041
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,166
Yes?

2042
02:20:06,666 --> 02:20:10,166
Son, speak up.

2043
02:20:16,291 --> 02:20:18,291
I had a small desire.

2044
02:20:18,791 --> 02:20:27,083
To hear your song during these last moments, but..

2045
02:20:27,583 --> 02:20:30,750
Doctor, Shri wants to hear my song.

2046
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:33,625
Can I play a song on the tape recorder?

2047
02:20:34,125 --> 02:20:37,041
Well.. - Please, doctor.

2048
02:20:37,541 --> 02:20:44,041
Okay, but at a low volume. - Okay.

2049
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:48,041
Son. - Doctor.

2050
02:20:52,291 --> 02:20:55,791
Nurse, injection. - Yes, sir.

2051
02:21:15,708 --> 02:21:19,916
"How does one feel on losing a friend?"

2052
02:21:20,416 --> 02:21:24,291
"How does one feel on losing a friend?"

2053
02:21:24,791 --> 02:21:28,916
"How does one feel on losing a friend?"

2054
02:21:29,416 --> 02:21:34,541
"We were oblivious to it."

2055
02:21:35,041 --> 02:21:44,500
"We've always seen hardship from a distance."

2056
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:52,750
"This time, this hardship might even strike us."

2057
02:21:53,250 --> 02:21:57,541
"When there was no pain in life.."

2058
02:21:58,041 --> 02:22:01,541
"..life didn't seem worth living."

2059
02:22:20,375 --> 02:22:24,458
"I never used to be so pained.."

2060
02:22:24,958 --> 02:22:29,083
"..when dreams used to shatter."

2061
02:22:29,583 --> 02:22:33,416
"This time, even my heart might break."

2062
02:22:33,916 --> 02:22:38,458
"When dreams used to shatter."

2063
02:22:38,958 --> 02:22:43,333
"This time, even my heart might break."

2064
02:22:43,833 --> 02:22:47,750
Shri, listen.

2065
02:22:48,250 --> 02:22:51,041
Listen, Shri.

2066
02:22:51,541 --> 02:22:54,750
This noise, people's applause..

2067
02:22:55,250 --> 02:23:01,583
..and praises are only for you.

2068
02:23:02,083 --> 02:23:06,250
Don't you want this to happen again?

2069
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:08,791
Don't you want me to sing again?

2070
02:23:09,291 --> 02:23:12,791
Open your eyes, Shri.

2071
02:23:16,875 --> 02:23:18,875
You can't leave us.

2072
02:23:19,375 --> 02:23:21,791
You can't leave us. - No!

2073
02:23:22,291 --> 02:23:24,041
Shri, look!

2074
02:23:24,541 --> 02:23:26,083
She is your mother.

2075
02:23:26,583 --> 02:23:30,208
All her life she suffered quietly for you.

2076
02:23:30,708 --> 02:23:33,500
Won't you give any joy to her?

2077
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:34,958
Shri,

2078
02:23:35,458 --> 02:23:39,583
If you die, I swear on you..

2079
02:23:40,083 --> 02:23:44,458
..I'll also die. - He can't leave me.

2080
02:23:44,958 --> 02:23:46,875
He can't leave me.

2081
02:23:47,375 --> 02:23:50,375
He can't.

2082
02:23:50,875 --> 02:23:54,375
He can't.

2083
02:24:04,208 --> 02:24:07,708
I think he is out of danger. Now he'll recover.

2084
02:24:13,416 --> 02:24:16,916
Mother.

2085
02:24:20,958 --> 02:24:24,458
Son!

2086
02:24:29,166 --> 02:24:32,791
Mother.

2087
02:24:33,291 --> 02:24:37,916
Shrikant, the doctor said you'll recover.

2088
02:24:38,416 --> 02:24:41,291
Why not? One who has a friend like you..

2089
02:24:41,791 --> 02:24:44,416
..has to get better.

2090
02:24:44,916 --> 02:24:49,791
Look, Shrikant. Everyone has come to meet you.

2091
02:24:50,291 --> 02:24:52,666
Look.

2092
02:24:53,166 --> 02:24:56,666
They love you very much.

2093
02:25:03,625 --> 02:25:08,916
Shrikant, he is your grandfather.

2094
02:25:09,416 --> 02:25:12,958
Yes, son. When I met you that day..

2095
02:25:13,458 --> 02:25:15,750
..I didn't know about our relationship.

2096
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:20,541
When I found out, I felt as if I had..

2097
02:25:21,041 --> 02:25:24,541
..got my long lost son back.

2098
02:25:35,333 --> 02:25:40,625
"Every life is the same."

2099
02:25:41,125 --> 02:25:46,083
"Someone cries while some laugh."

2100
02:25:46,583 --> 02:25:51,875
"It's easy to live with patience."

2101
02:25:52,375 --> 02:25:55,166
"It's difficult to live with worries."

2102
02:25:55,666 --> 02:26:00,291
"It's difficult to live with worries."

2103
02:26:00,791 --> 02:26:06,750
"Destiny has endowed us with joy and sorrows too."

2104
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:12,208
"We'll get our share from this."

2105
02:26:12,708 --> 02:26:16,250
"If you're without support.."

2106
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:20,833
"..become someone else's support."

2107
02:26:21,333 --> 02:26:26,708
"If you're without support.."
