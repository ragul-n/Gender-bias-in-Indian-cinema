1
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,087
You are late.
You can't do anything right.

2
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,092
Did you speak to your
father about our marriage?

3
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,095
I see him only on TV
after he became a minister.

4
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,107
He went to Delhi yesterday.
I'll tell him when he returns.

5
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,440
You are saying the same for one
year. Think of my problem at home.

6
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,769
This time it is definite.

7
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,135
I wonder which side
to go. Come.

8
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:42,679
Auto, will you come?
- Where? Chikadpalli

9
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:47,156
My son lives here. We came
from Anakapalli to see him.

10
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,161
I belong to Anakapalli too.

11
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,163
Next to bus stop is God Hanuman
Temple. Next is coconut shop.

12
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,165
That's my father's.
- I see!

13
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,168
Open the door.
I want to go my mother.

14
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,173
Anna, this is too less.
Give me more this time.

15
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,845
Take her back.

16
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:18,180
What about software girl?
I'll bring her in 2days.

17
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,185
Is this the fate of women

18
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,198
This is what they deserve

19
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,192
Is this right

20
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,207
Asked by a lion of a man

21
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,211
Will he emerge out of
darkness bringing light

22
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,216
Will he change the situation

23
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:15,171
If one can see,

24
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:23,179
the world is
colourful

25
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:30,185
If one can sing and dance

26
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,664
the sky is a stage

27
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:11,227
The festival of Holi
brings joy

28
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:16,241
It makes the heart beat
with excitement

29
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,438
Mother is our closest
relative

30
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,247
Kids are equal to god

31
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:51,048
Friendship is other name for
sacrifice.

32
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,449
Motherland is dear to us

33
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:59,123
People are selfish but

34
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,798
festival of colours brings us
all together

35
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,505
Gayathri! Brother!
You will cut your finger.

36
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,509
I'll cut the vegetables.

37
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:23,173
Why? I'll do it.
You just sit.

38
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,178
When she goes to in-laws who
Will cook, she or her husband?

39
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,851
Of course her husband will.
- Rakhee -Oh here comes brother!

40
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,183
Coffee is tasty. You can
survive on coffee shop.

41
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,516
Ramakrishna, we're going to our
new house construction site.

42
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,527
Iron our clothes

43
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,529
Did you send cement bags?
Yes, - Did you wash the bike?

44
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:43,534
In the morning. - We aren't
coming for lunch.

45
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,194
Finish all the work.
- Okay.

46
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,535
Your brother and sister in law
are very selfish.

47
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,665
They are using you as servant.

48
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,207
Don't be silly. They aren't
outsiders but..

49
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,217
my brother and sister-in- law.
Till I get a job I'm free.

50
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,550
Anyway what is wrong in
doing our own work?

51
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,556
Then, clean my vehicle too.

52
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,551
Clean it
- I'll kill you.

53
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,558
Brother, is lunch for
father ready? Oh I forgot!

54
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,233
You won't forget your mother
however busy you are.

55
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,567
When she used to feed me...

56
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,374
... she used to ask me if I will
feed her when I grew up.

57
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:34,576
She died before her wish was
fulfilled leaving Gayathri to me.

58
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,115
Feeding her makes me feel like
I am feeding mother.

59
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,122
Okay. Start. This is for your
fatherThis, for your grandpa.

60
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,600
Have I said anything wrong?

61
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,611
I know Telugu.
You speak in Telugu.

62
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,615
Tell me baby.
- How to go to Cherlapally?

63
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,277
Why go to Cherlapally?
- Do you know Seenu?

64
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,611
Which Seenu?
'Moddu'Seenu.

65
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,616
I know you are like a daughter
to me I am your uncle.

66
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,621
Go get an auto.
Or a taxi.

67
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,629
Are you trying to impress her?
- He will.

68
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,641
It is his problem at home.
He is a Romeo.

69
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,303
What is wrong in chasing girls?
- Shut up,- You shutup.

70
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,979
He is a Station master
not a sweeper.

71
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,641
I will hit you. How dare you
call him a sweeper!

72
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,652
What do you think he is?
Man or a pig? A donkey?

73
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,655
He may be a man, a pig,
or a donkey.

74
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,315
But he is a responsible officer.

75
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,659
He doesn't sell pigs.

76
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:56,668
Why do you bother what he sells?
The fact is he is a human being.

77
00:13:56,735 --> 00:14:00,671
Reacted like any man when looked
at a girl in tight pants.

78
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,667
What did you say?
- There is nothing wrong in it.

79
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,678
She is young and wearing jeans.

80
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,682
You can ogle at her
but not on platform.

81
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,347
Who are you?
A retired gang man.Me?

82
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,684
I let you live you on platform
even after retirement.

83
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,697
How can you harm me!
- Greetings Madam.

84
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,368
You are old and retired.
You should stay at home.

85
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,503
Listen, father.
- You have spoiled them.

86
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,697
Ticket, sir.
- What ticket?

87
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:42,372
Do you know who I am?
- I don't care.Ticket.

88
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,706
Here it is.

89
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,246
Someone raised his hand
on our officer,

90
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,532
What is the commotion?
- He hit our officer on duty.

91
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,728
You know he is a minister's son.

92
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,740
Minister, your son hit our
officer. -Will you hit him?

93
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,744
So what do you want
him to do?

94
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:18,272
He has to touch our
officer's feet and say sorry.

95
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,749
Touch his feet?
My foot.Move aside.

96
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,754
He has to.No.
He must.What if he doesn't?

97
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,427
What are you waiting for?
Shoot them.They die.

98
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,558
Take them away first.

99
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,767
Will you shoot us?Shoot.

100
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,109
Shoot them.They are after all
railway employees.

101
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,776
Don't take us so lightly.

102
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:59,449
Daily 1.5 crore people
travel by trains.

103
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,125
There are 8000 railway stations.
The tracks are 1.07 lakh kmlong.

104
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:08,460
Trains run 22 lakh km.
per day, sir.

105
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,464
Don't take it lightly.
There are 64 divisions and

106
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,802
15 lakh employees.

107
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,808
In our Secunderabad division
alone, there are 170 trains,

108
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:22,142
...600 guards, 1200 drivers,
6000 gangmen work.

109
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,806
And you talk so lightly
about them

110
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,813
There are so many branches and
so many lakhs of employees.

111
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,824
They work day and night.

112
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,827
Reach crores of people
to their destinations.

113
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,829
They are not after all,
as you said.

114
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:44,164
Our railways give our government
Rs.56000 crores revenue annually.

115
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,826
So don't put them down.

116
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:51,843
For marriages, festivals,
interviews, medical treatments...

117
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,849
.. our railways fulfill their
traveling needs.

118
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,842
We are not worthless.

119
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,514
If the railways stop working, the
country comes to a standstill.

120
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,854
Crores of people get stranded.

121
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,860
Parliament trembles,
the country becomes chaotic.

122
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,862
You people lose posts.

123
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,526
Ours is 1 50 years of heritage.

124
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,862
So don't take us lightly.
Say sorry.

125
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,868
Say sorry. - He is right.
Better say sorry.

126
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,543
Say sorry.Father.
- Say sorry.

127
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,875
I'm sorry. Forgive me

128
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,882
Make way for them.
Please go. Go.

129
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,892
No doubt he is a minister.

130
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,903
But we can't tolerate insult
to our railways.

131
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,238
My grandson has done
a great thing.

132
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,900
Shut up. What is a retired men
doing on the platform?

133
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,911
Mind your business.

134
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,913
We are middle class.

135
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,576
We will be at the mercy of the
government for jobs etc.

136
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,586
I wonder where this altercation
leads to.

137
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,918
Nowhere. Stop worrying.

138
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,924
Take RRB application.

139
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,756
Fill it up for ASM post.
I'll handle the rest.

140
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,592
Here is lunch and tobacco
rolls for grandpa.

141
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,742
Only in lndin women are
treated like goddesses.

142
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,938
In the same country a woman is
an object of pleasure.

143
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,280
Example is Bhavani
murder case.

144
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,946
Rape in blind girls school
yesterday.

145
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,955
Innocent girls are sold.

146
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:50,962
Women continue to be ruined
bysome men.

147
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,966
Any amount of law,
preaching are ineffective.

148
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,559
Instead, they are increasing.

149
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:09,972
What is this Women, atrocities,
scandals, values, duties?

150
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:15,577
Headache. We want
Entertainment, commercialization

151
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,988
Like who raped whom How
manyraped her,and how

152
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:25,792
Who did it first etc. are
important. Expose the bigwigs.

153
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,989
Plant secret cameras to do it.

154
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,993
Increase TRP,

155
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:41,344
Increase TRP, Ads.
Attract viewers.

156
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:48,010
Tell me if you can't do it.
I'll use my creativity.

157
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,685
Forget stupid women issues
and women's problems.

158
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,017
You take it so lightly.

159
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,029
We feel sad for unknown
people's deaths.

160
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:04,034
8 out of 10 face this problem
are known to us.

161
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:09,039
There are scores of women
who are sexually abused.

162
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:15,046
Divoced, physically abused,
burnt alive, everywhere.

163
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,707
On the roads, bus stops, in the
offices

164
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,719
at homes, hotels, cinema halls,
they're ragged, harassed sexually.

165
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:27,054
There are so many such cases
taking place around us, daily.

166
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:31,858
We are used to hearing it daily.
So it appears unimportant

167
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:39,061
But thousands and lakhs of
women face this big problem.

168
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,668
It is a burning problem.
- Burning problem! My foot!

169
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,740
Greetings, sir.Come in
Rakhee. You tell them.

170
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,749
Look at them.They don't
understand my creativity.

171
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,076
Not just them but no one in the
world understands you.

172
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,087
Do you mean my brother- in-law
is brainless?

173
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,089
It means he has a creative mind.

174
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,092
Your brother-in-law is not a
human being at all.

175
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,096
What do you mean? You mean
he is an animal -A god.

176
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,093
Well said

177
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,097
It is time to use my creativity.
I have to do.

178
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,769
What nonsense is he talking?

179
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:23,110
My father gave him the Channel
as dowry for marrying my sister.

180
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,443
We are paying for it.

181
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:31,113
He is gone.
You can smile now.

182
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,117
She is till crying,
You close your eyes tight.

183
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,129
Let me see once.
I'll hit you.

184
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:46,128
Smiled! Let me kiss again.
Not here. - Come. - Where?

185
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,801
I told you to let me drive.
Pick me up.Thanks, brother.

186
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,674
I fell down. You have no pity.
Snatch away my ice cream too!

187
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:04,987
Sit back.Where are we going?
- To submit the application.

188
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,148
Thank you, brother.

189
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,160
Yes, sir. I'm standing in queue.

190
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,705
I will collect applications in
10 minutes.

191
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:26,167
You said it is the last day.
So, I wore a red shirt as you said.

192
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:31,648
Wore black pant. You said I'll
get a job in transport business.

193
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:35,983
Yesterday I applied to RTC
and today, to railways.

194
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,181
I'm talking about application,
not a bomb.

195
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:45,195
In the front White

196
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,866
Now I have white colour
in front of me.

197
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,872
Behind me Blue.

198
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,199
I'm in right place.
Counter Number

199
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,546
It is facing west.

200
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,607
Want me to turn to East

201
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,211
Can I submit the application
now

202
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,223
Counter is on the West side.
Who will take from East side?

203
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,219
Oh, I should face east but give
it over the shoulder.

204
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,230
People might laugh at me.

205
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,892
Never mind.
Getting job is my concern.

206
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,226
I am in trouble. Unless I get
some job?

207
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,898
my uncle won't give his
daughter in marriage.

208
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,067
You say that I don't get lucky
unless I get married.

209
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:36,909
In Hyderabad arrows are
famous.

210
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,917
May I use itto get rid of
my uncle?

211
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,976
What? I go to jail

212
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,578
That will ruin my life.
Good bye, sir.

213
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,248
Have you too come to
submit your application?

214
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,260
No, To watch a movie.
They show movies too here!

00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,255
You are teasing me.

I'll take you to him to read
your horoscope.

220
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,269
Hey, you, turn this way,

221
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:12,282
If I do, I won't get the job.
Why?- I believe in vastu.

222
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,616
What an idiot! I've seen
one like you for the first time.

223
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,281
What is your name?
Rakhee.

Why did you make her give it?
- She is my sister.

227
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,964

Ramakrishna.Okay.

Look at the tongue.
Look at the drink.

00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,648
I'll drink without
wetting my tongue.

232
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:55,988
If not, we will beat you up.
He lost the bet.

233
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,322
What is the noise? A
strange thing happened here.

234
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:07,338
What?-He bet he'll drink
without wetting his tongue.

235
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:11,171

For how much?? Rs.100

238
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,349
You rogue, you bet Rs.10 and
drank liquor worth Rs.100!

239
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:23,683
Happy that he lost! He made
you lose Rs.90, you fools.

240
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,322
I will come.Get lost.

241
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:38,325
Eat it. Romancing?

242
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,338
You had to find only this place?
What do you think of my studio?

243
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:46,343
This place is warm. Go to the
AC office and romance.

244
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:53,340
Where is Tripura?

245

246
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,348

Girls are sold here!

248
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:11,359
Why not be satisfied achoring
some programs on women?

249
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,035
Come here.

250
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,243
Here he comes

251
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,404

I'll let my boys rape you.
Make a video.

258
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,005
and sell it
to Dubai Sheikhs.

259
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:59,466
They will go mad at it.
She has a great body.

260
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,499
Boys, what are you waiting for?
Kill him.

261
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,580
Leave me.

262
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,628
Girls are abducted, kidnapped
with promises of marriage.

263
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:45,642
But rogues they sell them
to Dabar and make money.

264
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,302
Right now he is absconding.

265
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,312
Have you any brains?Think
you are Jhansilakahmibai!

266
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,647
What if I had not come in time
or didn't come to know about it

267
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,992
For a minute my heart skipped
beat on seeing you in their hands.

268
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,656
Haven't you thought of your
mother at least?

269
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,326
Do you think you are great?

270
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,661
Why do you bother about others?

271
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:18,675
Don't you see me or
your sister in them?

272
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,677
Don't bring Gayathri into this.

273
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:25,512
Gayathri and me have you.
So we are protected.

274
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,675
But who do they have?
Do they have to be sacrificed?

275
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:36,684
They are sold for10, 15 or
20 thousand each.

276
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:42,697
They sell them like animals.

277
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,495
Trupura?ACP is calling you.

278
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,537
Information is from secret
source

279
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,699
We shot everything with
Hidden camaras.

280
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:14,061
I slapped you here yesterday,
right

281
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,730
You are my courage.

282
00:32:54,706 --> 00:33:00,702
Your love is everything for me

283
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:16,717
Take me.

284
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:29,071
I am all yours

285
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:39,411
Listen to the

286
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,744
.. desires of my heart?

287
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:33,797
I thought you are romantic

288
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,805
It is time to prove it.

289
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:43,145
I want you fulfill my wish

290
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,814
Can 't you hear me

291
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,818
Come to me

292
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,831
Let me surrender
myself to you

293
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:05,886
Touch me once

294
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:09,899
You can never go away
from me.

295
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:15,896
I'm in love with you

296
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,568
Accept your beloved

297
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,592
Like every year, give a sari to
the one you love most.

298
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:20,267
Don't hesitate.

299
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,937
T ake it.

300
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:42,949
If everything goes well you
will be our daughter-in-law.

301
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,961
byyour next birthday.

302
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,624
So we planned that
it goes to you.

303
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:55,632
All of us know you both. This
is with your mother's consent.

304
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:02,309
Mother, they are kind to give
me a place here.

305
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,975
Bless me it lasts forever and
I don't lose Rakhee.

306
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,990
I told you not to leave me
alone.

307
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,997
In Hyderabad we must
speak in Hindi,.

308
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,010
I will handle it. Relax

309
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,004
We have to go that way.

310
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,681
Don't be afraid.
Come with me.

311
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:54,020
Where is L.V, Prasad
Eye institute?

312
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:58,034
Go and find out.
Why do you get angry?

313
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,037
I said move.Move.

314
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,702

00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,039
Grandpa who is she?

00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,881
She is your paternal aunt.
- Aunt!

318
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,886
Coconut shop next to temple
is my father's.

319
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,048
Come, I'll take you there.

320

Catch him

325
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,940
You are heavy! Here is the
fare.

326
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,101
Her weight is killing me.

327
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,106
Gowri, he is your cousin.

328
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,780
My back bone is gone.

329
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,114

Want me to untie you?

332
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:41,127
Dont't move. Keep distance.

333
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,132
Stand straight. Come close.

334
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,976
Come closer.

335
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:57,144
Your weight killed me.
Let us go in.

336
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,822
Oh, cousin!
Iam feeling shy.

337
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:11,157
I don't want food. Sit.

338
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,160
She is my daughter, Tripura.

339
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,165
What happened to you, cousin!

340
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,171
She is Gowri, my cousin.
This is Tripura, my friend.

341

I'm hungry.

342
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,202
Aunty, you too join
us for food.

343
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,205
Come, aunty.

344
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,209
Sit and eat.

345
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,223
You left us.

346
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,896
Why did you come back
now you shameless?

347
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,902
I'm shameless, brainless!

348
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:31,038
You met your sister
after 25 years.

349
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:35,048
Can't you ask how are we doing

350
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:39,245
On top of that you ask for
our ticket, you rogue

351
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:46,253
Can't you say how are you
to me Ego?

352
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:51,098
You ignored me.
How can I talk?

353
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,260
You come here.

354
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:58,274
She is nave.
She is new here.

355
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:04,941
How can you shout at her for
asking for directions?

356
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:12,085
Don't expect me to forget the
past, take you back if you cry.

357
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,952
Never.

358
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:20,286
You complain about
my affection

359
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,959
But look at your father.

360
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,298
He chooses the son
over the daughter.

361
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:38,315
He is going to die soon anyway.
Why is he still so stubborn?

362
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:47,314
Past is past. We are after all
blood relatives.

363
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:51,327
Stay here for a month
till the eye operation.

364
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,322
Ramakrishna, look after it.
- Okay, father.

365
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,996
You went jumping with your
husband?Has he come now

366
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,329
He is no more, brother.

367
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,001
He had all vices.

368
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,177
Spent away
all the property.

369
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,340
He used to get drunk and
beat me up daily.

370
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:19,151
I wanted to die out of
frustration.

371
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,349
But I was carrying her.

372
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:29,366
I go rid of that dog.
Living only for her.

373
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,369
I made a big mistake by not
heeding to your advice.

374
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,033
I made a big mistake.

375
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,394
She thinks happy birthday
means thanks.

376
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:11,407
You are killing us with
Your language.

377
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,401
Hold it. This is so nice!
Who putit?

378
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:20,747
Come here. Teach me too,
to put rangoli.

379
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:27,413
Hold it this way.
Girls should be like you.

380
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:31,427
But in my town
girls are modern.

381
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:38,425
They don't know to do
any of household chores.

382
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,433
She killed me!

383
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,106
You behave as if all women
in the world are in trouble.

384
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,446
Your mother, my sister and
you are fine, right

385
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:58,113
Many women are happy.
So, stop worrying.

386
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,453
Cousin..
Oh! Here she comes again!

387
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:06,462
You are cookng!
Come this way.

388
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:12,992
Men shouldn't cook.
Let me do it. I cook well.

389
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,471
Tell me what you like.
I'll cook for you.

390
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:22,479
I'm getting pampered.
You have to mix like this.

391
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:33,479
Hold like this and wash.

392
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:38,494
Your hands are so smooth!

393
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,488
It is a strange feeling.
- Different feeling there.

394
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,494
That is why I did it.
Really..

395
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:04,314
You fatso,
why are you so friendly with her?

396
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:11,324
Just like that.Act smart,
I will kick you.

397
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:17,194
You are a girl.
Shouldn't say such words.

398
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:22,528
You dog, rogue

399
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,542
I am getting late for exam.
What took you so long?

400
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:41,547
Come here. Apply kumkum
from temple. Best of luck

401
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,555
Oh, my hall ticket!

402
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,399
When will you say
I love you to me?

403
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,562
Give me my hall ticket.
Say you love me first.

404
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:03,580
Hall ticket. I'm mad after you
for years. Say it.

405
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,572
Oh, Gayathri's hall ticket
is here!

406
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:11,109
I'll kill you if you don't.
I mean it.

407
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:20,386
I beg of you. Please leave.
Give me my hall ticket.

408
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,395
I've to write the exam.
Please.

409
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,610
Brother.

410
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,452
Pull him away.
Brother

411
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,995
I love studies.

412
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:34,330
Take me to hospital.
I'll study well.

413
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,003
I'll write the exam.

414
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:41,474
I love studies, brother.

415
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:54,021
He has been troubling her
for long.

416
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:58,684
She wanted to tie rakhee
to you this year too..

417
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,698
You won't go to college.

418
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,532
You should give police complaint.
Why are you still here?

419
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,695
Talk.
We will talk later.

420
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:14,710
Later! Do we let him go free
after this horrible thing?

421
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,713
It is our responsibility
Gayathri is in bad stage.

422
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,511
Rest is important for now.
Leave it.

423
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,708
Don't talk as if only
she is your sister.

424
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,721
Srilata too tied Rakhee to you.

425
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:29,520
That devil hacked her in broad
daylight. How can we leave him?

426
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,717
Talking to you is a waste.

427
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,525
Gayathri, at least you lodge a
complaint. - Get lost.

428
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,722
She is my responsibility.

429
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,727
My mother handed over her to me.

430
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,739
You want me run after police
andcourtsat a time like this

431
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,741
Look at her tremble out of fear.

432
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:51,737
Get lost. Don't cry sister.

433
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,777
I couldn't control my temper

434
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:37,783
Cousin, you are here!
Uncle is calling you.

435
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,797
You go. I'll come later.
No he wants you come now.

436
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,463
Let me give her what she wants.
Give it to me I'll give.

437
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,796
Should I give?

438
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,644
He is funny
- What is the news?

439
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,113
Wear a silk sari.

440
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,113
Let us talk of rules before
we begin the program.

441
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,658
I'm holding a silk sari.

442
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:15,323
I will quote a price for it.
Say if it is right or wrong.

443
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,659
Are you not able to hold it
It is live, remember.

444
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:27,132
If your answer is right,
you will win this sari.

445
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:34,014
Before that, I'll ask you one
or two questions for fun.

446
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,678
What channel do you watch
normally?

447
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,023
Which others? Next.

448
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,691
Don't you watch Sri Devi TV?
We are on live.

449
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:01,370
This sari price is. Rs.5250.
Right or wrong?

450
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:04,038
No way. Even Rs.250 is more
for that sari.

451
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,706
Right answer.
This sari is yours.

452
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:12,721
You have to wear it here.
How?

453
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,723
Remove what you are wearing
and wear this.

454
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,727
Wear sari here! You rascal.

455
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,729
All of you, come here.

456
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:31,568
I'm your employer. Don't you
stop them from beating me?

457
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,734
Don't blame them. - Why?
- I didn't want interruption.

458
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:44,751
Father,Marriage for Gayathri!
- Yes.

459
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:50,282
After the recent incident I'm
afraid to send her to college.

460
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:54,420
We planned it for the next year
but we will do it now.

461
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,756
Station master told us
of a good alliance.

462
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:02,371
We plan to ask them to come
to see the girl.

463
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,765
Mother, I'll come too
Wait.

464
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:20,779
Boy is handsome. Going to
go to America soon.

465
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:25,454
She is his sister, Meghana.
She is his mother, Padmavati.

466
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,792
It is a good match, trust me.

467
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,790
Celebration in the evening?
Groom is handsome.

468
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,803
I've done the introduction.
Proceed.

469
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:40,466
How long will you take?
Someone say something.

470
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,802
You begin the dialogue.

471
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:47,810
What is there to say? Recently
there was an alliance from Vizag.

472
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,409
They are offering 15 lakhs
dowry.

473
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,482
15 lakhs.
What is your answer?

474
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:54,818
Such alliances don't come cheap.

475
00:54:55,825 --> 00:55:00,159
We can't afford that.
- What can you afford?

476
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,826
You are aware of our financial
condition.

477
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:12,841
But this is a good match.
She is our only daughter.

478
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,639
We liked the boy.

479
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:20,179
I can give 10 lakhs from
my provident fund.

480
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,845
10 lakhs.Okay. What about
gifts to groom's sister?

481
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,856
They will give this and
also other presents.

482
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:30,392
Conduct marriage grandly
befitting your status.

483
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:37,857
Confirm. Okay done.
Have snacks.

484
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:25,905
Oh she stepped on my feet!
I'll kill you.

485
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,917
How can you expect 10 lakhs
Mr.Mohan Rao?

486
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:43,261
You have kept P.F. as surety for
bank loan for your elder son.

487
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:48,600
Bank has taken it.But he is
repaying loan every month!- No.

488
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:53,932
You know that the shop opened
with loan is shut down.

489
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:59,607
It is a loss. You know it.
From where do I have money?

490
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,747
I mean you haven't told me about
it. - I thought you know it.

491
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:08,284
You are earning well.

492
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,953
You bought a house in Tarnaka.
Buying a car for comfort.

493
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,962
Is it an enquiry committee?
- Can't I see it

494
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,622
I brought money
from my parents.

495
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,963
Your father is a king and
your mother is a queen!

496
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:23,972
Don't brag. I know how
rich your parents are.

497
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,634
Old man, you talk too much.
You are no less.

498
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,974
Calm down, father.
- You rogue

499
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,314
You swallowed the money saved
for your sister's marriage..

500
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:39,978
You will be cursed.
You will be ruined.

501
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,991
Don't talk too much..
You will die a dog's death.

502
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:48,998
Don't say such words.
Son, this is a good match.

503
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:52,660
If we let it slip, sister's life
will be ruined.

504
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:56,000
For her good future

505
00:57:56,072 --> 00:58:00,008
I saved it rupee by rupee
sacrificing many things in life.

506
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:05,673
Don't do injustice to her. I beg
you. Give the money.

507
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,012
I touch your feet.
- You animal..

508
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,009
Why are you creating a scene?

509
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,851
I've been telling not to go for
alliance above our affordability.

510
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,015
Does she deserve a boy from
America?

511
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,695
She can marry a porter or a
TC like you.

512
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,022
Say one more word,
I'll split your tongue.

513
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:29,695
Brother, please don't go.
- I won't stay here anymore.

514
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:33,037
It's sister's marriage.- How
dare you hit me! Get lost.

515
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:48,046
Father

516
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:55,053
I can't even get my daughter
married. Let me die.

517
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:59,067
Calm down, son.

518
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:05,598
Brother, I want to say something.

519
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,403
May I give you 10 lakhs?

520
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:19,415
We were unfair to you yet,
you are helping.

521
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:23,752
I'll repay it somehow dear.

522
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:27,887
Don't say so.
For Gowri's marriage

523
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:34,764
I saved that money with great
difficulty from that devil

524
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:40,106
Looking at my case,.

525
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:45,443
I'm scaredto give Gowri
to an outsider.

526
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:54,788
Don't misunderstand
my Request is

527
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,456
in return for my money.

528
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:05,924
Brother,get Gowri

529
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:14,132
married to Ramakrishna.

530
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:20,149
If you want, conduct both the
marriages?

531
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,811
... together.

532
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,148
He is
- Tell her.

533
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,152
Give me half an hour, aunty.

534
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,155
Only half an hour.

535
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,167
Everything we wish doesn't
happen in life.

536
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,841
We have to accept it.

537
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,719
It is a great feeling that
Gayathri is going to America.

538
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,188
I'd have done the same if
were in your place.

539
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,244
Gayatri won't agree if she
comes to know of it.

540
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,908
She is going to US after
3 months.

541
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:06,244
I'll marry Gowri after that.
Believe me.

542
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:11,860
I swear on my mother
Don't say such words.

543
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:24,263
I love Rakhee. I can do
anything for him.

544
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:51,294
Gowri, your cousin agreed to marry you.
You're very lucky.

545
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,094
I'm getting married.

546
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,222
Rakhee,you are my Kavasaki

547
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,494
You are my target

548
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:00,497
Hey, Andhra beauty

549
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,866
You are going to fall
into my arms

550
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:29,502
Brother come with me.
- We are not very far.

551
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:33,665
Brother-in-law, take
Care of her.

552
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,698
Brother, you are coming now!

553
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:10,040
I was busy with elections
in the village.

554
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:14,708
I've to handle everything.
Who is she? Maid

555
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,718
No. She is our daughter-in-law.
- Daughter-in-law!

556
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:20,721
She doesn't look like that.
How much did she bring?

557
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:24,725
10 lakhs.- 10 lakhs! A municipal
dog catcher is worth that.

558
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,728
A boy going to USA is
worth at least a crore.

559
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:34,395
A crore!! Yes. In this election
I helped a man win.

560
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,732
He is loaded with money.

561
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:39,069
His only obsession is to send
his daughter to US.

562
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,735
Keeping this fellow in mind,
I set up everything.

563
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,744
I wish you waited for
a month.

564
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:47,543
Had we known it, we wouldn't
have agreed to this alliance.

565
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,742
Nothing is lost yet.
- What do you mean?

566
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,590
Move move it.

567
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,752
What are you taking?
- Pappucharu. (dal)

568
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,758
Gayathri likes it.
I'm taking it for her.

569
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:12,774
After marriage our girl belongs
to them. No more ours.

570
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,775
We shouldn't go there whenever
we want.

571
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,777
Do I need permission to see
sister?

572
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:28,382
Yes. After marriage our daughter
becomes their daughter-in-law.

573
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,784
You don't need his advice.

574
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:36,797
I'm hearing it for a month.
I want to see her.

575
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:45,798
I made coffee first time in
my life. Taste it.

576
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,803
Do you know to make coffee at all?
Get lost.

577
01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:02,822
Clean shave the head!!- Yes.
I vowed to shave off our heads

578
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,825
at Tirupathi after
we are married.

579
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,827
Oh my! Shaving off the head!

580
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:11,823
You look great with it.

581
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:17,839
Don't laugh. A man has to be
strong like him.

582
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,840
Don't tease my husband.

583
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,838
Feed him well. He will
become double the size.

584
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:34,846
Swipe the floor well. You
brought 10 lakhs dowry.

585
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:39,860
But going to enjoy life in US.
You are lucky.

586
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,863
Have you ever even seen a
plane from close distance

587
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,865
Do you deserve to go to America?

588
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:04,551
Vasu, stop it. Why are you crying?
Better luck next time.

589
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:11,882
My astrologer said my day was
bad. I didn't listen to him.

590
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,887
Stop that nonsense and
listen to me.

591
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:22,563
One must always trust his
strength.

592
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:25,897
But my situation is different.

593
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,432
My uncle is looking for alliance
for mycousin.

594
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,911
I can't marry her
if I have no job.

595
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,915
Your case is different.

596
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:40,922
Please give up this job.
I get this job,

597
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,923
I'll give you 2 lakhs
if you want.

598
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:47,327
Are you mad! I ambition is to
become Station Master.

599
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,592
I'll give 3 lakhs.

600
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,734
Forget it. - Here is my card.
Think and call me,

601
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,931
Want to tie Rakhi to
you brother?

602
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:02,943
Would something happen to him
if you don't?

603
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,741
My brother must be waiting.

604
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,940
I'll tie Rakhi and return
immediately.

605
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:14,787
You can't go to those
labourers house.

606
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,949
Why are you talking insultingly
about my family?

607
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:23,794
Oh, you felt offended!

608
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,958
Why, they gave you whatever
you demanded.

609
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:31,972
It is only 10 lakhs. My brother
lost 1 crore because of you.

610
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,967
Then you should have gone for
it. Why marry me?

611
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,978
How dare you say so?

612
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:43,311
I won't live here if this is the
case. I'll go to my parents.-Go.

613
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:38,833
Brother, please.
Don't hit him.

614
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:45,036
Go away,

615
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:50,050
You can't interfere.

616
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:54,851
I beg of you. Please go away.

617
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:04,055
Grandpa, go and bring her back.

618
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:07,590
Love and quarrels are part of
married love.

619
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,069
He must have scolded her
when he was angry.

620
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,732
Even I had fights with my wife
many times.

621
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:17,403
Have we separated Let us not
bring her back in haste.

622
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,744
What's wrong with you?
You don't understand me.

623
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:26,749
She is our Gayathri.
He is beating her. I've seen it.

624
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:29,751
Will you bring her back of nor?

625
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:36,759
If I go I'll kill him. Go.

626
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:50,101
Brother, are you angry?

627
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:56,107
I didn't know what to do.

628
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,112
He is my husband anyway.

629
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,125
Don't you want to see my face

630
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:16,134
What happened!!

631
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,799
You get my brother beaten up!
You are headstrong.

632
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:30,149
Never mind. I held the vessel
with hot milk and got burns.

633
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:50,161
Today is Rakshabandhan.

634
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:56,177
I thought I can't tie Rakhi.

635
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,172
The problem was because of this.

636
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:34,205
You know what is Rakhee.
It is a promise to protect.

637
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:40,219
It means a brother protects his
sister as long as she is alive.

638
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:47,218
It is not just for me but

639
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:54,897
for my would be born
baby too.

640
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,569
Really!Yes.
Really!

641
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,046
Gayathri, do your in-laws know
about it

642
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:20,259
No.They must be informed
first, then we.Go home.

643
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:25,789
Father, what are you saying
She must not go back.

644
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:30,602
She will stay here with us.
What will she do here?

645
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:33,937
She has a family there.
Why will she stay here?

646
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:37,268
It's your fault. You raised your
hand on your brother-in-law.

647
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,872
How can you ruin your sister's
married life?

648
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:44,275
Come there and say
sorry to him. Come.

649
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:56,622
She is still young. Came to
tie rakhi without telling you.

650
01:18:57,299 --> 01:19:03,101
She made a mistake. She is
like your daughter. Forgive her.

651
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:08,902
We are decent people. We don't
run away from home like her.

652
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,303
Don't say so.
We are decent too.

653
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,978
In future she won't do such a thing.
Please forgive her.

654
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,986
I'm sorry, brother-in-law.
Fault is mine.

655
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:28,922
I lost my temper.

656
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:34,333
Scold me
if you are angry with me.

657
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:37,669
Hit me, kill me.

658
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,334
I touch your feet.

659
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:49,340
Don't punish Gayathri.
She is pregnant too.

660
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,346
You are pregnant!

661
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:01,352
Why didn't you tell us?
Felt shy?

662
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,355
What are you doing
brother-in law!

663
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,358
I was tense about finances.

664
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:12,031
Even after selling our plot
in Jubilee Hills,

665
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:16,037
.. we are unable to arrange
5 lakhs to go to USA.

666
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:21,042
I came home tense and got
irritated with their problems.

667
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:24,045
Please don't feel offended

668
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:27,378
It is only 5 lakhs.
Why do you take tension?

669
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,389
I will get it by morning.

670
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,383
What are you saying!
- Wait.

671
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:36,387
I'll get it by morning.
But how can I take from you?

672
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:39,399
Give it back with interest
when you settle in US.

673
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:41,401
Or take me too with you.
I'll feel happy.

674
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:45,066
No more talking. I'll bring.

675
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,398
Rakhee, wait.
- Let me talk.

676
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:51,411
All I want is you and Gayathri's
happiness.

677
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:56,407
Listen to us
- All of you go out.

678
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:04,086
I'm really sorry.
Take care of her.

679
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:06,758
She is pregnant too.

680
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:11,429
Bye, sister. Let us go.
Bye.

681
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:19,763
You said you can give 4 lakhs.
But I need 5 lakhs urgently.

682
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:25,436
I'll leave my job
if you give it.

683
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,242
Are you brainless?
We want to get rid of her!

684
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,408
Why did you let her in?
- She might hear.

685
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,420
You could have sent her back
with them.

686
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:38,756
I bargained for 5 lakhs for it.
He can't raise that money

687
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:42,422
Right. We can send her back
with this ruse.

688
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,226
What if they bring her back?

689
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,427
Have you heard everything

690
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:54,236
I plan to send you back
permanently and marry again.

691
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,434
Do you know how much
dowry I get? One crore.

692
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,441
I'll call my brother and

693
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,280
Me and Subulu are
indebted to you for ever.

694
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:05,442
Meet me if you come to
Bimavaram.

695
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,448
Sign on these papers,
- Sign.

696
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:16,123
Sign. -What papers are these?
Divorce papers.

697
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,129
Only then I can marry.

698
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:22,129
Where are you running away?

699
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:39,475
Stop.

700
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,481
Keep the vehicle aside.
Do you have licence?

701
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:49,827
If she steps out we'll get into
police case and problems.

702
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:52,492
Your going to America gets
totally cancelled.

703
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,501
What about one crore?
We won't lose it.

704
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:56,503
Get rid of this girl first.

705
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:23,528
You! Why have you opened the door?
Isn't Gayathri home?

706
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,524
I'll give the money and
Meet Gayathri.

707
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,196
Call Gayathri.

708
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:33,336
She isn't at home.
- No.Where did she go?

709
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,532
She is pregnant.
Wanted to eat ice cream.

710
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:38,545
Your brother-in-law took her out.
- Yes. She loves ice cream.

711
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:41,207
I'd have brought had
she told me.

712
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,541
Never mind. I'll wait.
But

713
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:48,545
She is young.
Going to be a mother.

714
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:55,552
I'm sure it will be a boy.
We will select a nice name.

715
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,897
They said they will go to watch
a movie from there.

716
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:03,230
Went to movie?
They might come late.

717
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:08,906
Give me money if you trust me.
Or give it to my son tomorrow.

718
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:13,570
We gave our sister here.
You are like mother to her.

719
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:17,244
Here is 5 lakhs. Becareful.

720
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:22,579
I offered archana in my would
beborn nephew's name.

721
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:26,252
Tell her to apply this before
going to bed. Bye.

722
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,589
What's it?

723
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:42,599
What is the matter?

724
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,605
Nothing. Bye.

725
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:13,630
I feel uneasy, restless as if
something wrong happened.

726
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,638
How do you drink it!
It will kill you.

727
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,642
I don't understand what is
selling your job.

728
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,655
Forget it. There are plenty.
We want Gayathri's happiness.

729
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:32,318
She should go to America.
My nephew should study there.

730
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:35,652
She likes coconut sweet.
I'll take Pappucharu for her.

731
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:39,325
Be careful.
-Gayathri's happiness is important

732
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:43,660
Must go to Gayathri.
Not now.

733
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:47,664
Not now.

734
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:53,670
You shouldn't go drunk.
- Gayathri will scold me.

735
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:20,697
What is the matter?
- Gayathri is in the hospital.

736
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:29,706
Burns ward!
- I will explain.

737
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:47,724
Look there

738
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,728
Where is Gayathri?

739
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:12,749
Gayathri, it's me your brother.
Speak to me.

740
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:38,776
You have to protect me
As long as I live.

741
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:29,519
Her sari caught fire while
cooking and she died.

742
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:32,191
But this is what our
report says.

743
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,525
We can't do anything.
Your case isn't strong.

744
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:39,529
Anyway what is the use of a
case when she is dead?

745
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:42,542
You are poor. Forget the case.
I'll see that you get a lakh.

746
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:46,876
Is a lakh okay?
- As you say, sir.

747
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:51,348
How much did you take from them?

748
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,886
One lakh.
You give me 2 lakhs.

749
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:57,549
I'll turn the case
in your favour..

750
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:05,225
Let us do one thing. I'll give you
3 lakhs somehow.

751
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,366
You send your daughter to bed
with my grandson.

752
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:13,237
You old man.
I'll put you in cell.

753
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,566
Forgive his ignorance.
You want to file a case?

754
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:19,579
Go ahead.
You can do nothing.

755
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:24,584
I'll see what you can do.

756
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,583
Water in the South west
Nothing in the south east

757
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:38,598
Losses in the south east
Dish in Noth west!

758
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:47,597
Are you a watchman here?
Cook? Sweeper?

759
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:51,611
Look here. This Channel
Are you buying it?

760
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,604
Are you an anchor?

761
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:00,450
Why are you here?
- T o become an anchor.

762
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:04,284
With this face! Have you
ever seen it in photo?

763
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:07,623
I came to show it on TV. But
I didn?t like the place. Bye.

764
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,467
Why are you leaving?

765
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:22,632
According to vastu, this channel
becomes popular in near future.

766
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:25,638
But it's owner will become
a pauper.

767
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:29,649
Then I'llbuy the channel. No
Need for anchoring now.

768
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:35,645
Channel becomes popular but
owner becomes pauper!

769
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:37,657
What contradiction!

770
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,660
Everyone wants to become
an anchor!

771
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:58,668
Who is Mohan Rao?
It's him.

772
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:03,683
You! I'm Sachidanandam,
Criminal lawyer.

773
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:05,685
I take your leave.
-Okay.

774
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:13,683
She is beautiful.
The dead won't come back.

775
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:17,357
But money will be useful.

776
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,690
Take my advice and compromise.

777
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:25,695
Courts can do nothing.
Count on my experience.

778
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,366
Don't worry.I'll get you
3 lakhs from them.

779
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:30,705
Withdraw the case.

780
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:33,702
3 lakhs is a lot of money.

781
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,712
So, no compromise
Want to go to court?

782
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,724
Let me tell you something.

783
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:48,728
To complete the pending
cases as of today?

784
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:50,730
... do you have any idea how
manyyears it takes?

785
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:55,735
It takes 360 years. So
you have faith in court!

786
01:32:55,803 --> 01:33:01,742
Okay. Let us meet there.
You will be ruined.

787
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:19,082
It is a clear cut suicide.

788
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,561
They are playing melodrama
to extract money from my client.

789
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:24,754
She didn't sleep with me
even once.

790
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,766
When I told her brother,
he hit me.

791
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:31,101
You have seen the postmortem
report. - Death is due to burns.

792
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:33,436
No injuries on dead body.

793
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:36,099
Her character was very bad.

794
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:38,234
She had an affair with a boy
from her class.

795
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:40,576
She had many affairs
in her college.

796
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:43,773
Our enquiries reveal that she
had 2 or 3 affairs.

797
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:51,588
She got mentally disturbed as
she was forced into marriage.

798
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:55,785
She used to scream all the time.
- No happiness from day one.

799
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,793
So I asked for divorce. They
demanded 20 lakhs from us.

800
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:03,633
She burnt herself.

801
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:06,637
I offered to cook. - She locked
herself in the kitchen.

802
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,798
She had suicidal tendency.

803
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,608
It is a mental case.
We can't predict her actions.

804
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:15,145
Public Prosecutor, do you have
any evidence to argue?

805
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:19,817
Say No.No. -Then why
did you take upthe case?

806
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,486
Final judgment of this case
will be on 15th of next month.

807
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:26,656
You?
- What is wrong with you?

808
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,819
Elder son left us.
You are my only hope.

809
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:31,831
How can you keep quiet
at their accusations?

810
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:33,833
Have you gone insane?

811
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:38,828
You want to kill my cousin?

812
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,832
What are you doing!
Raising hand on your uncle!

813
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,377
I don't feel like staying here.

814
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:54,852
Memories of Gayathri are
tormenting me.

815
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:01,851
I'll go back to my village,
father.

816
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:08,529
If a happy event takes place
within ayear of death in the

817
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:11,537
family,the rewards of it
to go the dead.

818
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:18,869
I think Gowri and Ramakrishna
should marry at my house.

819
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:24,874
You too think about it, brother.

820
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:32,552
Uncle, let's go to court. Today
is final judgment of the case.

821
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,893
What is the use of going there?

822
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:39,559
We have no hope to get justice.

823
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:42,892
We are misfortunate.

824
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:48,567
Don't lose heart, uncle.
We can try in the higher court.

825
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:51,577
We will fight.
We will get justice.

826
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:56,576
Atleast for
Gayathri's sake we must fight.

827
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,918
Let us go.
Where is Rakhee?

828
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:53,697
On going through the cases,..

829
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:56,029
It is found that it
Is not a murder.

830
01:37:56,103 --> 01:38:00,699
It is proved that she died
by accident while cooking

831
01:38:00,774 --> 01:38:06,713
So, her husband, mother-in-law
and other members are acquitted.

832
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:14,043
I won the case.

833
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:22,051
I warned you not to
mess with me.

834
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:25,394
I'll shoot you down here
ltself if you act rough.

835
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:28,060
Let us not bother about him.
Let us go.

836
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:30,069
We are misfortunate.

837
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:33,072
My lion like grandson is
in shock.

838
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:40,069
Had he been normal, your story
wouldn't have come this far.

839
01:38:40,147 --> 01:38:42,081
He would have hacked
everyone long back.

840
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:50,751
You will be cursed.
God is there to do justice.

841
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:55,892
You will be ruined. You will
lead a miserable life.

842
01:38:56,096 --> 01:39:00,089
We've to attend to visa
without delay.Hurry up.

843
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:03,092
Brother-in-law?..

844
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:26,175
Someone is burnt outside
the court.

845
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:34,183
How daring!

846
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:57,205
What's the commotion?

847
01:41:57,211 --> 01:42:00,044
Have you come to arrest me
- Something like that.

848
01:42:00,214 --> 01:42:02,205
The Commissioner is
in panic for the past 2 hours.

849
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:06,218
Leave my son alone.
- Commissioner is on line.

850
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:10,213
I'll be there in
10 minutes, sir.

851
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:20,222
You have come!

852
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:35,079
We heard that murders
took place in court.

853
01:42:35,249 --> 01:42:38,241
We are about to leave.
Will you come?

854
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:56,259
I've headache.
Can I get a coffee?

855
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:04,107
Is it about what
happened in the court?

856
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:08,271
What else can I do?
My sister was 3 months pregnant.

857
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:12,275
They burnt her alive.

858
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:16,948
We went to court. Lawyer
demanded a lakh to fight.

859
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:19,953
Demanded 2 lakhs to turn
the case in our favour.

860
01:43:20,294 --> 01:43:26,961
Lawyer came to our house.
Said dead won't come back.

861
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:29,826
Offered 3 lakhs if we
withdraw the case.

862
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:33,296
My sister's life is worth 3 lakhs.

863
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:36,308
What did the doctor say?

864
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:43,306
They called her mad.

865
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:49,847
They are selling themselves
out of greed.

866
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:55,853
If courts and police are such,
where do we go for justice?

867
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,322
We can't help it.

868
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:03,326
This is the list of information
you gathered.

869
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:08,340
A brother and father
of a 14 year girl...

870
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:11,866
... threatened her without the
other's knowing...

871
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:14,345
... raped her repeatedly
and made her pregnant.

872
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:18,679
A doctor told a patient
she has to strip for x-ray.

873
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:22,343
Then, took her nude.
photos with cell phone.

874
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:28,351
That rogue has cheated
women patients.

875
01:44:28,428 --> 01:44:30,191
An lAS officer has killed his wife.

876
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:34,357
Remarried and torturing
his 2nd wife too.

877
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:37,369
An other burnt his wife.

878
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:42,374
A lecturer made his
girl student disappear.

879
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:45,206
An other teacher threatened
to fail his girl student...

880
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:48,371
... if she didn't go to
bed with him.

881
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:53,376
An auto driver sells a
village girl to brothel.

882
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:57,048
A corporator sold girls
to different States.

883
01:44:57,391 --> 01:45:00,383
The world is full of
wretched men.

884
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:04,920
There are scores of kids,
young girls like Gayathri.

885
01:45:08,402 --> 01:45:14,398
You said once that I'm
there for you and Gayathri.

886
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:16,408
Then, I didn't understand you.

887
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:20,403
These rogues think girls are helpless.

888
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:26,077
Someone should teach
a lesson to these dogs.

889
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:30,413
But who is doing it?

890
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:34,426
Everyone just treat your
news for time pass.

891
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:43,427
That is why...
I'll teach them.

892
01:45:44,438 --> 01:45:46,429
I'll.

893
01:45:52,112 --> 01:45:53,773
Nomy grandson.

894
01:45:54,448 --> 01:45:59,112
I'm scared. Forget
what has happened.

895
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:05,449
We can't live if
something happens to you.

896
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:08,460
You come with us.

897
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:12,464
Let's go away from them
and lead our lives in peace.

898
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:19,463
Shut up.
My cowardice killed Gayathri.

899
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:24,476
There shouldn't be a father like me,
nor girl like Gayathri.

900
01:46:24,544 --> 01:46:29,140
Those who make women cry
should die.

901
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:34,477
Go. Kill them.
Don't bother about us.

902
01:46:35,489 --> 01:46:40,483
Kill them, hack them.

903
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:25,617
Killll them.

904
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:36,619
Tell me who is it?

905
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:43,626
Who did it?
- It's him.

906
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,634
Those rogues should be killed.

907
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:54,646
They didn't have pity
that we are blind.

908
01:50:54,714 --> 01:50:59,651
They drag us to their
room any time they want.

909
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:06,319
One after the other...
- It is painful, aunty.

910
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:11,654
How could they be so inhuman?

911
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:14,666
Looking at these girls,
their killings are justified.

912
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:25,668
What happened is unfair.
I pity them.

913
01:51:25,745 --> 01:51:28,680
But you don't know all
those dead are criminals.

914
01:51:28,748 --> 01:51:31,683
There could be some good men too.

915
01:51:31,751 --> 01:51:35,346
Switch on the camera.

916
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:39,352
Show it on Tv. It must
be the job of terrorists.

917
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:42,685
Naxalites or dacoits job.

918
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:45,697
This is just to disrupt
the peace in the country.

919
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:50,702
Or to scare the society
to control them...

920
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:53,705
... or to gain popularity overnight.

921
01:51:53,773 --> 01:51:57,709
I'll arrest the rogues
in 24 hours..

922
01:51:57,777 --> 01:52:01,713
who are turning the city
into graveyard.

923
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:04,716
I'll shot them dead if necessary.

924
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,713
Every murder has
10-15 minutes gap.

925
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:13,725
+ hour gap after 7 murders
in Nampally court.

926
01:52:13,793 --> 01:52:16,728
Then it started in
Chadarghat. Then in...

927
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:29,732
By bike it takes 7 - 10 minutes
from one place to another.

928
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:32,744
Each murder takes
3 to 5 minutes.

929
01:52:32,812 --> 01:52:36,748
So, it is possible.

930
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:45,748
Face to face with Rakhee
who claims responsibility...

931
01:52:45,825 --> 01:52:47,759
... to city murders.

932
01:52:47,827 --> 01:52:51,763
May I talk? - Start.
Greetings. I'm Ramakrishna.

933
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:57,292
I'm responsible for all the
murders that took place today.

934
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:01,764
I killed them.
I'm not a terrorist.

935
01:53:01,841 --> 01:53:04,776
I'm not a dacoit either.

936
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:07,770
Why did you have to kill so many?

937
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:12,307
I love my sister deeply.

938
01:53:12,786 --> 01:53:15,311
We gave 10 lakh dowry
as the groom is going to USA.

939
01:53:15,388 --> 01:53:17,788
It was a grand marriage.
We gave lot of presents too.

940
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:20,792
They demanded 5 lakhs more.
We gave that too.

941
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:25,797
For more dowry from another
marriage they burnt her to death.

942
01:53:25,865 --> 01:53:27,799
We went to police, court.

943
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:29,801
We were offered money
to withdraw the case.

944
01:53:29,869 --> 01:53:31,803
Lawyer demanded money
when we insisted on fighting.

945
01:53:31,871 --> 01:53:34,806
Finally, they acquitted them
saying my sister was mad.

946
01:53:34,874 --> 01:53:37,809
There are many girls like Gayathri.
They are all sisters to me.

947
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:39,811
Who will protect them?

948
01:53:39,879 --> 01:53:41,813
Ours isn't just rotten
society.

949
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:44,816
It is worse than rotten worms.

950
01:53:44,884 --> 01:53:48,479
Are police not taking action?

951
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:51,814
They are very busy.

952
01:53:51,891 --> 01:53:54,155
They have to mind the
government, ministers.

953
01:53:54,427 --> 01:53:56,657
Control traffic, provide security.

954
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:57,819
What's your goal?

955
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:02,825
Stray dogs attack us
on the roads.

956
01:54:02,902 --> 01:54:06,838
If one caries a cane,
they don't even bark.

957
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:11,834
One should have the
fear of death if he teases a girl.

958
01:54:11,911 --> 01:54:18,840
One should fear death
when he teases girls in college.

959
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:22,845
One should have the fear
of death on the road if...

960
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:25,857
... he burns his wife at home.

961
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:29,852
Such crimes will stop
when there is such fear.

962
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:34,659
How long will you continue
to do this?

963
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:37,860
Until I die or
someone kills me.

964
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:45,868
Next telecast is at 7.30 pm.

965
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:52,875
Your interview of Rakhee
raised the status of my channel.

966
01:54:52,952 --> 01:54:55,887
It beame sensational TRP and
Ads and sponsors increased.

967
01:54:55,955 --> 01:55:01,723
On this occassion, I promote
you as chief editor.

968
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:05,888
I present you a bungalow
and a car.

969
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:14,897
Is this the channel
interviewed Rakhee? - Yes.

970
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:18,901
We know that.
Who did it?

971
01:55:18,978 --> 01:55:22,744
Who interviewed him?
- Me.

972
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:25,908
Our DSP called you.
Come with me.

973
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:30,753
Are you arresting her?
Do you have warrant?

974
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:35,918
You want warrant?
What do you think of media?

975
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:42,925
Don't mess with us.
Who is your DCP?

976
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:47,930
Tell him to come here.
We will interview him.

977
01:55:48,007 --> 01:55:50,942
Do you think we are cowards?

978
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:53,945
Get scared of your uniform
and jump into jeep?

979
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:10,953
What did you say?
- A lot.

980
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:13,965
Said he can make or
break the country.

981
01:56:14,033 --> 01:56:17,969
I wasn't serious. I just
said 4th estate.

982
01:56:18,037 --> 01:56:20,631
What are other 3 estates?

983
01:56:20,974 --> 01:56:22,965
I don't know.

984
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:27,979
1st is, government, 2nd is
legistature, 3rd is judiciary.

985
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:39,652
I didn't know.
I just happen to use the word.

986
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:41,984
Sorry. Tell him to
put me down.

987
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:44,986
If you move...

988
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,806
You seem to be very
angry with police.

989
01:57:02,015 --> 01:57:07,009
From kids to senior citizens
are angry with police.

990
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:12,685
Where is Rakhee?

991
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:16,018
I forgot my hand bag at home.
Probably he is in it!

992
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:20,022
Think it is funny!

993
01:57:20,099 --> 01:57:23,034
You work for media
whose responsibility is to...

994
01:57:23,102 --> 01:57:26,037
.. analyse the news
before presenting to public.

995
01:57:26,105 --> 01:57:28,039
Why are you behaving mad?

996
01:57:28,107 --> 01:57:32,043
Rotten constitution.
Corrup government.

997
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:36,047
Crippled society.
You work for these.

998
01:57:36,115 --> 01:57:40,882
For ages atrocities are
committed on women.

999
01:57:41,054 --> 01:57:45,047
Now a real man,
like a lion is hunting the...

1000
01:57:45,124 --> 01:57:47,058
.. animals called men.

1001
01:57:47,126 --> 01:57:49,060
Supporting him looks like
madness to you?

1002
01:57:49,128 --> 01:57:51,062
I pity you.

1003
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:58,060
Are you Rakhee's lover?
- More than that.

1004
01:57:58,137 --> 01:58:00,071
I'm his devotee.

1005
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:05,067
You are totally mad.

1006
01:58:05,144 --> 01:58:07,078
I feel the same way about you.

1007
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:19,084
Be a good girl and
tell me who is next on...

1008
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:22,616
... Rakhee's hit list.

1009
01:58:41,114 --> 01:58:42,775
He will kill so many!

1010
01:58:42,849 --> 01:58:45,113
Rakhee killed more than 40 in
one day in Hyderabad?

1011
01:58:45,184 --> 01:58:47,118
... and created chaos.

1012
01:58:47,186 --> 01:58:51,122
To those who catch him
dead or alive...

1013
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:55,126
... the government announced
reward of 25 lakhs.

1014
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:57,179
How are you, dear?

1015
02:00:01,194 --> 02:00:03,185
Gowri, your cousin has come.

1016
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:07,189
You don't look as if
you took care of you.

1017
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:21,875
I'm hungry. Oh, I forgot
my Hindi because of you.

1018
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:25,207
I'm hungry. Will you
serve me food?

1019
02:00:46,205 --> 02:00:50,198
Willyou come to where
I ask you to come

1020
02:00:54,213 --> 02:00:58,547
Will you give me
whatever I want

1021
02:01:03,222 --> 02:01:07,215
Will you come without
feeling shy

1022
02:01:07,293 --> 02:01:11,229
Will you give me lot
of kisses

1023
02:04:41,407 --> 02:04:44,399
I promised to marry Gowri...

1024
02:04:44,643 --> 02:04:48,414
... in return for your
help for Gayathri's marriage.

1025
02:04:48,414 --> 02:04:51,406
I didn't forget it.

1026
02:04:53,419 --> 02:04:56,411
But I'm not in a position to marry.

1027
02:04:56,489 --> 02:05:00,425
Even if I marry her,
her life won't be happy...

1028
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:02,427
... as you hoped.

1029
02:05:03,429 --> 02:05:08,093
Because I might get killed
any minute.

1030
02:05:08,434 --> 02:05:10,425
It is true, grandpa, father.

1031
02:05:11,437 --> 02:05:14,429
I still have lot of
things to do.

1032
02:05:14,507 --> 02:05:18,443
Get her married to a good boy.

1033
02:05:19,445 --> 02:05:21,436
I'll arrange for money.

1034
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:06,480
Drive.

1035
02:06:12,498 --> 02:06:15,490
Where is Bharat?
- We don't know.

1036
02:06:16,502 --> 02:06:21,496
Tell me, I'll let you go. - He went to
forest for hunting. - Which forest?

1037
02:06:49,535 --> 02:06:51,526
One more is dead,
Meenakshi, aunty?

1038
02:06:56,542 --> 02:07:00,535
Madam.. - Yes.
- Put me down.

1039
02:07:00,613 --> 02:07:02,547
Madam didn't tell us.

1040
02:07:02,615 --> 02:07:08,554
You hung me like a
clock, on the wall.

1041
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:10,555
Who gave you police job?

1042
02:07:30,576 --> 02:07:33,568
Call up transport office.
Find the owner of this car.

1043
02:07:38,584 --> 02:07:40,575
It is registered in the name of Bharat,
minister's son.

1044
02:07:42,254 --> 02:07:46,247
He is in meeting
sir, phone from Hyderadad.

1045
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:50,922
Good morning. I'm DCP
Meenakshi speaking.

1046
02:07:50,996 --> 02:07:52,258
Where is your son Bharat?

1047
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:55,266
Did he commit a murder?
Don't disturb him.

1048
02:07:55,334 --> 02:07:57,268
Put the phone down.

1049
02:07:57,336 --> 02:07:59,270
His life is in danger.

1050
02:07:59,338 --> 02:08:01,272
Do you think you are
talking to an useless man?

1051
02:08:04,276 --> 02:08:07,268
Put the phone down.
Where is my son?

1052
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:17,004
Girls are like our mother.

1053
02:09:17,349 --> 02:09:21,342
They are sensitive.

1054
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:25,356
Feel hurt easily.

1055
02:09:26,358 --> 02:09:32,354
How can you like pigs,...

1056
02:09:32,431 --> 02:09:37,027
... strip them?

1057
02:09:37,102 --> 02:09:39,366
Physically abuse them?

1058
02:09:39,438 --> 02:09:45,206
Batter them severely.

1059
02:09:45,377 --> 02:09:50,041
How could you be so
inhuman, you dogs?

1060
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:12,393
We will be burnt.

1061
02:10:15,407 --> 02:10:18,399
Do you remember what
you did?

1062
02:10:18,477 --> 02:10:22,413
You thought girls
can't fight back.

1063
02:10:23,415 --> 02:10:29,411
But behind them,
there is Rakhee, me.

1064
02:10:49,107 --> 02:10:51,439
Move aside.

1065
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:57,449
Look, my son is killed.

1066
02:11:01,453 --> 02:11:06,447
We have tried sincerely
to save him.

1067
02:11:10,462 --> 02:11:12,453
We tried our best.

1068
02:11:17,803 --> 02:11:23,139
What were you doing
when he killed my son?

1069
02:11:23,208 --> 02:11:25,472
Dancing in front of Rakhee?

1070
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:29,480
Or sleeping using
uniform as pillow?

1071
02:11:33,485 --> 02:11:38,479
Take away the police
from here else I'll kill them.

1072
02:11:40,492 --> 02:11:44,485
Don't insult our uniform.

1073
02:11:45,497 --> 02:11:49,490
What are police for other
than to salute us?

1074
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:52,503
To provide security
for our families.

1075
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:58,510
Throw away the
police from here.

1076
02:12:00,512 --> 02:12:02,503
Throw them.

1077
02:12:03,515 --> 02:12:07,508
You are messing with police.
You are finished.

1078
02:12:13,525 --> 02:12:19,521
I'm not hurt by his
kicking me, a woman.

1079
02:12:19,598 --> 02:12:24,535
But his utters disrespect!
What's our standard!

1080
02:12:24,603 --> 02:12:29,540
Who is he after all?
He is a dog.

1081
02:12:29,608 --> 02:12:33,544
When I was SP in Cudapah,
I dragged him to...

1082
02:12:33,612 --> 02:12:39,551
... police station,
in spurious case.

1083
02:12:39,618 --> 02:12:44,555
That dog now becomes
a Minister and..

1084
02:12:44,623 --> 02:12:47,558
... threatens us of our jobs?

1085
02:12:47,626 --> 02:12:50,561
I'd have killed him
if I were in your place.

1086
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:53,564
Our department has
no respect.

1087
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:58,569
His son and his friends
gang raped Bhavani.

1088
02:12:58,637 --> 02:13:01,572
I arrested them with proof,
with great difficulty.

1089
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:05,573
But he got them
released with one phone call!

1090
02:13:05,644 --> 02:13:08,579
Rakhee killed those dogs.

1091
02:13:08,647 --> 02:13:11,582
Rakhee rebelled against
atrocities on women.

1092
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:13,584
He is doing what
we are supposed to do.

1093
02:13:13,652 --> 02:13:16,917
But what are we doing?

1094
02:13:19,591 --> 02:13:22,583
What Rakhee doing
is right.

1095
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:26,597
He is like a real police officer.

1096
02:13:26,665 --> 02:13:32,604
The tragedy is we are
trying to arrest...

1097
02:13:32,671 --> 02:13:35,606
... such a sincere worker.

1098
02:13:45,617 --> 02:13:48,609
Madam said you may go.

1099
02:14:25,657 --> 02:14:29,650
Let's eat.

1100
02:14:42,674 --> 02:14:47,338
I'm Rakhee,
Sorry, I'm very hungry.

1101
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:50,341
The sight of food increased it.

1102
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:52,349
I'm eating without your
permission.

1103
02:14:52,684 --> 02:14:56,677
Sorry.
I'm really hungry.

1104
02:14:58,690 --> 02:15:02,683
Don't you have security
system for your house?

1105
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:05,696
You are not handling
naxalite cases.

1106
02:15:05,764 --> 02:15:10,701
Anyway what's the use?

1107
02:15:12,704 --> 02:15:15,696
Sambar is tasty.
We call it Pappuharu.

1108
02:15:15,774 --> 02:15:19,710
But it needs little more salt.

1109
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:23,373
Then it would taste
much better.

1110
02:15:24,716 --> 02:15:26,707
Don't look for gun.

1111
02:15:26,785 --> 02:15:28,719
I came to surrender myself.

1112
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:32,383
I have trust only in you.

1113
02:15:32,724 --> 02:15:35,716
Police must have got
information by now.

1114
02:15:37,729 --> 02:15:40,721
I must finish eating
before they arrive.

1115
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:51,732
Give me a minute to finish
my meal. I'm very hungry.

1116
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:01,412
Thank you, madam.
I'm full now.

1117
02:16:34,786 --> 02:16:41,783
Rakhee killed my only son
and is roaming free.

1118
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:48,789
Dasu, take whatever you
want from me.

1119
02:16:50,802 --> 02:16:55,796
I'll protect you.

1120
02:16:55,874 --> 02:17:00,811
You find him wherever
he is hiding.

1121
02:17:00,879 --> 02:17:02,813
That's Rakhee.

1122
02:17:06,818 --> 02:17:09,616
He! Isn't he the fellow
on the waiting platform?

1123
02:17:09,821 --> 02:17:12,813
He is after my son since then!

1124
02:17:15,827 --> 02:17:18,819
He is in our grip.

1125
02:17:18,897 --> 02:17:21,832
Find out which police station
he is taken to.

1126
02:17:23,835 --> 02:17:29,831
Blow him up, including
police station.

1127
02:17:51,863 --> 02:17:56,857
Be kind. I'm handcuffed.

1128
02:17:59,871 --> 02:18:03,864
So many police! Hope they
don't beat me up once l?m inside.

1129
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:20,891
Taken to jail! That woman
police is helping him!

1130
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:23,894
Put him in jail for
fear that we will kill him.

1131
02:18:23,962 --> 02:18:25,896
We have to flush him out.

1132
02:18:34,906 --> 02:18:37,898
Tell me the reason behind
the surrender.

1133
02:19:33,631 --> 02:19:34,962
Madhukar is still
in remand, right?

1134
02:19:35,033 --> 02:19:36,762
Yes.
- In which jail.

1135
02:19:45,977 --> 02:19:47,968
Move it, fast.

1136
02:20:48,039 --> 02:20:52,032
Sorry to lie to you.

1137
02:20:54,045 --> 02:20:57,037
I've 37 years of
experience in life.

1138
02:20:57,115 --> 02:21:00,050
Out of which is 15 years
of police duty.

1139
02:21:00,118 --> 02:21:06,057
I did it with honesty
but you upset it all.

1140
02:21:07,058 --> 02:21:10,050
I'm confused as to
what is right or wrong.

1141
02:21:10,128 --> 02:21:12,062
No confusions.

1142
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:15,065
You are thinking how
many more I'll kill.

1143
02:21:15,133 --> 02:21:19,069
When will I stop etc.
are your doubts.

1144
02:21:20,071 --> 02:21:25,737
College is like a temple.
Many girls come there to study.

1145
02:21:26,077 --> 02:21:31,071
A boy in the name of love...

1146
02:21:31,149 --> 02:21:33,083
... killed a girl.

1147
02:21:33,151 --> 02:21:38,088
I was carrying her to hospital.

1148
02:21:38,156 --> 02:21:42,092
She was holding hall ticket.
Wanted to write exam...

1149
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:49,089
... before going to hospital.
She died writhing in pain.

1150
02:21:50,101 --> 02:21:54,094
He should be stoned to death.

1151
02:21:54,172 --> 02:21:57,767
Instead you people put
him in jail and feed him!

1152
02:21:58,109 --> 02:22:01,101
So called humanitarians,
outside...

1153
02:22:01,179 --> 02:22:04,774
.... demand mercy for him.

1154
02:22:06,117 --> 02:22:10,110
What else, rather what more
can I do then?

1155
02:22:15,793 --> 02:22:20,127
Police duty made me
forget I'm a woman.

1156
02:22:22,133 --> 02:22:27,127
But now....
Do you know what I feel?

1157
02:22:30,141 --> 02:22:34,134
I want a son like you.
Never mind.

1158
02:22:34,212 --> 02:22:39,149
I'll raise my son like you.

1159
02:23:07,178 --> 02:23:14,175
I'm badly battered by police.

1160
02:23:16,187 --> 02:23:19,179
It feels so nice!

1161
02:23:19,257 --> 02:23:21,851
You can see me right?

1162
02:23:22,193 --> 02:23:25,185
How can you smile
at a time like this?

1163
02:23:25,263 --> 02:23:29,199
Smile makes me look handsome.

1164
02:23:31,202 --> 02:23:37,198
You look like Goddess
Kali in hains.

1165
02:23:42,213 --> 02:23:46,206
Do you remember the
Dasera festival of last year?

1166
02:23:46,284 --> 02:23:51,221
Carnival, dancing, your company...

1167
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:01,154
... Iooking at you..

1168
02:24:13,177 --> 02:24:19,173
One loses his senses

1169
02:24:25,189 --> 02:24:30,183
You make me feel romantic

1170
02:24:32,196 --> 02:24:35,188
You are mesmerizing

1171
02:28:05,176 --> 02:28:09,374
Rakhe is great.
He repays favours done to him.

1172
02:28:09,447 --> 02:28:14,180
He surrendered to police.
From the reward money...

1173
02:28:14,385 --> 02:28:18,185
... paid my money back
though it wasn't necessarily.

1174
02:28:18,389 --> 02:28:21,222
He told me to give you the
balance.

1175
02:28:21,392 --> 02:28:23,383
Wanted grandmarriage for Gowri

1176
02:28:25,396 --> 02:28:29,059
He doesn't belong to these
times. He is like God.

1177
02:28:31,402 --> 02:28:36,396
Where are you going? - To jail.
- Jail. - To my husband.

1178
02:28:36,474 --> 02:28:41,070
Husband!
I'm already married to cousin.

1179
02:28:41,145 --> 02:28:45,411
Getting married again is a silly.

1180
02:28:45,483 --> 02:28:51,422
I'm going to jail. I'll sit out
if I'm not allowed to go in.

1181
02:28:51,489 --> 02:28:54,424
I'm going to my husband.

1182
02:28:55,426 --> 02:28:59,089
Result of Rakhee's actions...

1183
02:28:59,163 --> 02:29:02,098
... providing confidence in
victims of atrocities.

1184
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:07,097
Protests and strikes for
his arrest are on.

1185
02:29:07,438 --> 02:29:10,430
Women normally keep away
from jails.

1186
02:29:10,508 --> 02:29:13,443
But now girls go to visit
Rakhee in jail.

1187
02:29:13,511 --> 02:29:17,447
Considering the various
requests from women,...

1188
02:29:17,515 --> 02:29:20,450
.. government allowed
Rakhee to meet them?

1189
02:29:20,518 --> 02:29:23,453
for 1/2 hour outside jail.

1190
02:29:24,455 --> 02:29:28,448
All the women in the State
are worshipping him like God.

1191
02:29:28,526 --> 02:29:31,290
They are coming to jail
to tie Rakhi to him.

1192
02:29:31,462 --> 02:29:37,458
He has to come out for that.

1193
02:29:37,535 --> 02:29:41,471
Once he comes out...

1194
02:30:24,181 --> 02:30:27,344
They have come for you.

1195
02:30:27,518 --> 02:30:30,510
To tie Rakhee to you.

1196
02:31:10,561 --> 02:31:16,227
My sister tied Rakhee on my
wrist for 18 years.

1197
02:31:17,568 --> 02:31:23,564
She is killed inhumanly.
I couldn't save her.

1198
02:31:25,576 --> 02:31:30,570
I don't deserve to be loved.

1199
02:31:31,582 --> 02:31:34,574
Don't tie Rakhee to me.

1200
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:43,253
Even 10 minutes of life
after tying Rakhee to you enough.

1201
02:31:44,595 --> 02:31:49,259
Tying Rakhee to you is like
boosting our self respect.

1202
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:52,592
We will feel proud to be
born as girls.

1203
02:31:52,670 --> 02:31:54,604
But, we will feel more proud
for being able to tie Rakhee.

1204
02:31:55,606 --> 02:31:59,599
We will consider it luck
if we can tie rakhee.

1205
02:32:00,611 --> 02:32:04,604
Yes... yes.

1206
02:32:06,617 --> 02:32:09,609
Here is my rakhee...

1207
02:32:36,647 --> 02:32:40,640
Hey DCP, give the
phone to Rakhee.

1208
02:32:48,993 --> 02:32:53,157
You killed my son and is
celebrating Rakhee festival?

1209
02:32:53,664 --> 02:32:59,660
Think you a messiah for women?

1210
02:33:00,671 --> 02:33:04,664
I won't kill you anywhere.

1211
02:33:04,742 --> 02:33:11,671
I won't kill someone,
at some place, but...

1212
02:33:11,749 --> 02:33:14,684
... I'll kill those girls
in front of you, like ants.

1213
02:33:24,695 --> 02:33:30,691
Save your sisters crying
for your help.

1214
02:33:55,726 --> 02:33:58,718
Cousin...

1215
02:34:18,749 --> 02:34:21,741
It's a bomb blast.

1216
02:34:50,781 --> 02:34:52,772
Send ambulance.

1217
02:34:57,788 --> 02:35:04,785
Pain in unbearable.
- Ambulance is coming.

1218
02:35:55,846 --> 02:35:57,507
He is in the company
of his men. Come.

1219
02:36:02,853 --> 02:36:06,846
You...
What is it?

1220
02:36:06,924 --> 02:36:11,861
Arrest warrant for killing
innocent girls with bombs.

1221
02:36:12,863 --> 02:36:15,855
Whose house you have come
you know? I'm the Minister.

1222
02:36:15,933 --> 02:36:19,869
My foot! I've permission to
arrest, Keep walking.

1223
02:36:20,871 --> 02:36:23,863
You police, who lick my shoes...

1224
02:36:27,878 --> 02:36:30,870
What do you think of police
you dogs?

1225
02:36:31,882 --> 02:36:35,875
Keep walking.
- Arrest warrant!

1226
02:36:38,889 --> 02:36:40,880
Go, do what you can.

1227
02:36:40,958 --> 02:36:43,893
You will never change.

1228
02:36:43,961 --> 02:36:46,896
I'm between you
and your death.

1229
02:36:46,964 --> 02:36:52,903
If I move aside, even
God of death can save you.

1230
02:36:52,970 --> 02:36:55,234
Surrender,
You will at least be alive.

1231
02:36:57,908 --> 02:37:00,900
You are after all a woman.
You save me!

1232
02:37:00,978 --> 02:37:06,917
Let me see who dares to kill me.
Move. I said move.

1233
02:37:22,933 --> 02:37:24,924
He is your death.

1234
02:37:25,002 --> 02:37:30,941
The reincarnation of Goddess
Adi Sakhi, to kill you.

1235
02:37:33,944 --> 02:37:36,936
You said police can't do nothing
other than protection.

1236
02:37:37,014 --> 02:37:40,609
I'll give you real protection now.

1237
02:37:40,951 --> 02:37:43,613
I'll provide protection for you
from any disturbance while...

1238
02:37:43,687 --> 02:37:45,621
... you die a dogs death.

1239
02:37:45,956 --> 02:37:49,949
Save you and your dogs
from this lion.

1240
02:37:59,970 --> 02:38:03,633
We leave after 1/2 hour.
I won't look your way till then

1241
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:12,972
Come...

1242
02:39:04,034 --> 02:39:07,629
Hit them.
- Kill the rascal.

1243
02:41:00,150 --> 02:41:04,143
Let me go...
Move aside...

1244
02:42:33,043 --> 02:42:34,908
Shall we go, madam?

1245
02:42:40,217 --> 02:42:42,879
Is it a court or a municipal
market?

1246
02:42:47,224 --> 02:42:51,217
Proceed...
- Rakheee... - I'll talk.

1247
02:42:51,294 --> 02:42:55,230
I've committed 49 murders.

1248
02:42:55,298 --> 02:43:00,235
I killed them in full senses,
preplanned.

1249
02:43:00,303 --> 02:43:05,240
I take full responsibility.
Any punishment is acceptable.

1250
02:43:05,308 --> 02:43:10,245
May I speak for 2 minutes
before punishment is pronounced.

1251
02:43:10,313 --> 02:43:11,245
2 minutes, please?

1252
02:43:16,253 --> 02:43:18,244
Just 50 murders made?.

1253
02:43:18,321 --> 02:43:24,260
The government, police and
public panic.

1254
02:43:25,262 --> 02:43:29,255
But on women who are our
mothers, sisters and

1255
02:43:29,332 --> 02:43:32,267
Iife partners...

1256
02:43:33,270 --> 02:43:37,263
... innumerable atrocities
are committed.

1257
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:42,277
Ghastly and cruel.

1258
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:50,277
Is anyone bothered?
Confronted the culprits?

1259
02:43:50,353 --> 02:43:52,947
At least tried to stop them

1260
02:43:55,292 --> 02:43:58,284
What is happening in our country?

1261
02:44:01,965 --> 02:44:04,126
When our mothers and
sisters go out...

1262
02:44:04,968 --> 02:44:07,960
... we are nervous till they
come back home.

1263
02:44:08,305 --> 02:44:10,296
Why do we feel scared?

1264
02:44:10,373 --> 02:44:13,968
They are not going to deserts
or forest to face dangers.

1265
02:44:14,311 --> 02:44:17,303
They will only be
among people like us.

1266
02:44:19,316 --> 02:44:22,308
When women come out....

1267
02:44:22,385 --> 02:44:26,321
... everywhere like the roads,
busstops, in the buses, hotels,...

1268
02:44:26,389 --> 02:44:30,325
Post offices, offices, parks,
colleges, etc... etc

1269
02:44:30,393 --> 02:44:33,157
... everywhere they walk
through under the?.

1270
02:44:33,330 --> 02:44:35,992
Iustful eyes of men.

1271
02:44:36,333 --> 02:44:39,996
We are scared as to who and
when someone harms our women.

1272
02:44:42,005 --> 02:44:44,337
Women mean only
an object of sex?

1273
02:44:44,407 --> 02:44:48,138
Look at the situation.
Despicable.

1274
02:44:50,013 --> 02:44:53,346
Our land is called holy land.

1275
02:44:53,416 --> 02:44:57,352
For such good reputation
look at our condition!

1276
02:44:58,355 --> 02:45:05,352
Mother is God is what
our country preaches to others.

1277
02:45:05,428 --> 02:45:09,159
But, we learnt nothing.

1278
02:45:10,367 --> 02:45:16,033
In our country a demon called
Ravan abducted Mother Sita.

1279
02:45:16,106 --> 02:45:17,368
Lord Rama, with the
help of monkeys, destroyed...

1280
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:21,376
... him and his kingdom.
What do we learn from Rama?

1281
02:45:21,444 --> 02:45:25,380
What do we learn from
Mahabharat where...

1282
02:45:25,448 --> 02:45:29,384
... 18 lakh people died for
pulling a women's veil.

1283
02:45:30,387 --> 02:45:36,053
Oh yes, we learnt something!
To abduct women, to strip them.

1284
02:45:36,393 --> 02:45:38,384
What a country! One should..

1285
02:45:38,461 --> 02:45:40,725
I salute it for it's great culture!!.

1286
02:45:43,400 --> 02:45:49,396
Police, law and secretariats etc
are run for us to lead...

1287
02:45:49,472 --> 02:45:55,411
... a civilized lives for which
crores of men contribute money.

1288
02:45:56,479 --> 02:46:02,418
In such a biggest democratic
country in the world...

1289
02:46:02,485 --> 02:46:05,420
... women have no safety.

1290
02:46:09,426 --> 02:46:14,090
This has to change but
it doesn't drop from the skies..

1291
02:46:14,431 --> 02:46:16,956
Change has to come in
all of us, from within us.

1292
02:46:18,435 --> 02:46:24,965
To our mothers who give birth
to us and raise us so lovingly...

1293
02:46:25,442 --> 02:46:29,435
... to show our gratitude...

1294
02:46:29,512 --> 02:46:32,447
... we must protect the women
around us with compassion.

1295
02:46:33,450 --> 02:46:38,444
Don't just punish us. Make us
study from beginners level.

1296
02:46:40,457 --> 02:46:43,449
Send this uncultured,

1297
02:46:43,526 --> 02:46:48,122
uncivilized society back
to school.

1298
02:46:48,465 --> 02:46:52,458
Teach them about women and.
about motherly affection.

1299
02:46:53,470 --> 02:46:55,461
That's all.

1300
02:47:05,482 --> 02:47:11,284
Rakhee, committed murders.
Confessed unashamedly.

1301
02:47:12,489 --> 02:47:16,016
Considering him to be unfit to
live in our civilized society...

1302
02:47:16,092 --> 02:47:20,495
... according to all possible
sections of lPC...

1303
02:47:20,563 --> 02:47:23,498
... it is awarded 49 hangings...

1304
02:47:23,566 --> 02:47:30,495
.. 49 x 14=656 years of
imprisonment.

1305
02:47:30,573 --> 02:47:35,169
We won't agree.

1306
02:47:44,521 --> 02:47:46,512
Wait a minute.

1307
02:47:53,530 --> 02:48:00,527
Our system has failed in
protecting our women folk.

1308
02:48:04,541 --> 02:48:09,535
I'm ashamed for punishing
a real son of our land.

1309
02:48:15,885 --> 02:48:17,546
I resign my judge's post.

1310
02:48:19,556 --> 02:48:23,549
I have never lost a case
as a lawyer, for 28 years.

1311
02:48:24,561 --> 02:48:28,224
After so many years, as a
lawyer, I take up Rakhee's case.

1312
02:48:28,565 --> 02:48:31,557
If necessary, I'll shake the
High court, supremecourt,...

1313
02:48:31,634 --> 02:48:34,569
... parliament to see that
Rakhee is acquitted.

1314
02:48:38,641 --> 02:48:41,576
We need Rakhee.
We need more Rakhees.

1315
02:48:42,579 --> 02:48:46,572
Hail Rakhee.

1316
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:19,612
A brother like you arrived
for us after this long.

1317
02:49:19,682 --> 02:49:23,618
Who are they to take you away?
We won't let them.

1318
02:49:27,624 --> 02:49:30,616
They can't take you.

1319
02:49:30,693 --> 02:49:34,629
We go to college without fear
now. You can't go to jail.

1320
02:49:54,651 --> 02:49:56,642
Please, don't make me a hero.

1321
02:49:58,655 --> 02:50:01,317
There shouldn't be
no need for Rakhee.

1322
02:50:02,659 --> 02:50:06,652
Not just cut vegetables
in the kitchen but...

1323
02:50:06,729 --> 02:50:09,323
... you should be capable to
behead evil men if necessary.

1324
02:50:10,667 --> 02:50:12,658
You should protect yourselves.

1325
02:50:17,473 --> 02:50:18,667
Bye.
