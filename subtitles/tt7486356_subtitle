Greetings to all of you

We know Olympic hero
Usain Bolt very well

17
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,917
If we count the time he spent
sprinting on the track...

18
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,875
...it will fit into
just a few minutes

Next year, on the same dais

You are a huge inspiration to me

42
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,250
I followed your footsteps
into this business

43
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,875
My only ambition in life is...

44
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:08,125
...next year I should bag
the award you did just now, sir

45
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,250
That too, from you

46
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,792

what work will you take up?

49
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,792
If I open a hotel
I'll be the boss

50
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,208
I'll naturally sit in the cash counter

51
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,417
First learn to clean the toilet

52
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,042
That's the 1st place
a guest will go to

53
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,625
You're also right

54
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,208
I'm not also right

55
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,792
What I said is ONLY right!

56
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:59,167
Our competitor
CEO of Go Cab

57
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,000
...came into this business
inspired by us

58
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,917
Today he tells me he'll be
the recipient of my award next year

59
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,333
Isn't it a matter of prestige?

60
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:17,292
Is what you say right
or only what you say is right?

61
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,583
What he said is only right

62
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:22,667
35 years

63
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,417
I've been in this business, shedding
sweat and tears to reach this position

64
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,958
If he wants this position
from the word go...

65
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,792
I'm going wrong somewhere

66
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,792
I must set it right

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,792
I'll do as you say, sir

68
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,958
Can't you smell something, dear?

69
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,583
Driver, are you drunk?

70
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:29,958
Stop the car

71
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,708
Listen, I'm telling you to stop

72
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,125
STOP THE CAR

73
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,333
Call the police, dear

74
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,417
I'm scared

75
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,333
Is your call going through?

76
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,542
Stop the car

77
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,958
Can't you hear me?

78
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,417
I'll come with you, pa

79
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,333
- Take her with you
- Shut up!

80
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,542
I'll be back in 10 minutes, okay?

81
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,667
Okay

82
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,708
Eat 1 mouthful
Your father will come no-

83
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,333
The driver is trying to escape

84
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,583
- Grab him
- Where are you going?

85
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,875
I'm Dwaraga speaking
Asst Commissioner of police

86
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,042
The victim died on the spot

87
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,917
The passengers must be
in their early 50s

88
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,625
Yes, Mr Nagarajan

89
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,917
We are an upcoming agency

90
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,500
That's why you've employed
an irresponsible driver

91
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,208
We investigate thoroughly
before we employ a driver

92
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,333
Name, hometown,
family background

93
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,792
Identity card and
the recent Aadhar card

94
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,125
Aren't these your details?
If this had happened at 5:00 p.m

95
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:11,042
...all TV channels would have
discussed you threadbare

96
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,417
Our CEO is a youngster

97
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,833
He has come up the hard way

98
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,167
I am 55 years old

99
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,750
I know how tough it is
to come up in life

100
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,292
Withhold it from the Press

101
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,875
Road accidents in Tamil Nadu
is growing by the day

102
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:27,917
A GO Cab car near Guindy
driving at break-neck speed

103
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,292
...ran over Arun a pedestrian who died-

104
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,750
To succeed in this business
is my dream, Nagarajan

105
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,333
The entire media is tarnishing our image-

106
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,583
I tried my best to
request the ACP

107
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,708
But despite all my effort-

108
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,208
Let them take whatever action
has to be taken legally

109
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,625
The driver was drunk

110
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:51,458
Recheck the IDs of all our drivers

111
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,833
Not even a single driver should
think he can drink and drive

112
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,208
Take the required steps
to nip it in the bud

113
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,833
'Mr Chandramouli'

114
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,000
Gone case

115
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,458
Why are you standing out here?

116
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,333
Start the car
You're causing a traffic jam

117
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,750
So stuffy inside, I wanted some fresh air

118
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,250
You carry on
I'll follow you

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,875
Sir, this same car stopped
at Adyar signal, I remember

120
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,792
Before that, it stopped in Mylapore
and in Mambalam that evening

121
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,292
You didn't notice that

122
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,667
You should observe better
We are jobless, right?

123
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,708
Get going, sir

124
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,667
Ready to trespass into others' space

125
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,333
Your car has stopped and you stand here
without feeling the least bit tense

126
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,000
Do you want me to lament
'Aiyo! My car has stopped?'

127
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:17,042
Get lost!

128
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,875
Don't be a royal pain in the neck
Move your car, sir

129
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,292
Slow down, your trousers may slide and fall

130
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,833
Sir, 1st start your car

131
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,917
It isn't starting

132
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,625
Move your car
You're blocking the traffic

133
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,333
I can move the car
only if it starts

134
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,292
Why are you blocking their way?

135
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,333
What has to be done
to start your car?

136
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,625
What you need to do is

137
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,958
...just once, gently

138
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,125
...with a lot of love
give a slight nudge to my car

139
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,333
It will start, I can go

140
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,083
You can go for
dry cleaning too

141
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,208
Okay, Chandramouli
You made it finally

142
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,000
The match has begun
Hurry up

143
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,458
- Did you note it down
- Hey! Look there

144
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,958
You can't park your car here

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,167
Why get flustered?

146
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,333
This is VVIP area
You can't park your car here

147
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,292
This is also a VVIP car

148
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:17,000
In 1980s Marlon Brando, Al Pacino,
Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep owned this car

149
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,542
I own it now
I won't give it to you

150
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,208
Don't give us these punch dialogs

151
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,417
Who is punching whom?

152
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,792
If I go in and tell him
he'll punch you to a pulp

153
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,208
He's quite the professional

154
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,167
- Who is that, sir?
- My son of course

155
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,292
Soooper, dude
You were too good

156
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,167
When did you come?

157
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,167
I came long ago
I was outside

158
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,708
Took me a while to get in

159
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,708
I was caught in a traffic jam

160
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,042
How many times to tell you
not to drive that rattletrap?

161
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,667
Why can't you buy a new one?

162
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,333
This is my dad

163
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,458
This is Mr Vinayak
CEO of Go Cabs

164
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,167
My dream is also to become a boxer

165
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,250
- You should have
- My father's business

166
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,708
He is happy with my success

167
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,167
But when youngsters
like Raghav win the trophy

168
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,417
...I am ecstatic

169
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,833
I can't deal with this, pa

170
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,333
Are you too tired
after the boxing match?

171
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,042
You won't dye?

172
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,625
What should I dive into now?

173
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,125
I meant your hair

174
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,667
Oh! No, I won't

175
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,000
- Won't change your phone
- I won't

176
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,042
Neither will you change this car

177
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,292
Definitely I won't

178
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,708
Will this car start or not?

179
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,792
Of course it will

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,917
- How?
- If you stand at the back

181
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,833
Give it a gentle nudge
with tender loving care

182
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,167
...it will zip, zap, zoom!

183
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,250
You want me to?

184
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,458
I know you won't
That's a given

185
00:13:55,208 --> 00:14:01,125
Look, those 5 naive chaps clad in white
with badges dangling down their necks

186
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,333
Shall we make their pearl white T-shirts
black as charcoal now?

187
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,500
Hey! You're sitting jobless?
Why can't you open the gate?

188
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,833
I'm yet to do
only the watchman's job

189
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,208
Make me do that too!

190
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,292
His rattletrap and
its unique green!

191
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,000
Junior, come here

192
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,875
'Butler Telugu' takes the cake!

193
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,083
Come here

194
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,042
Why didn't you come
to work this morning?

195
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,833
Like a son-in-law
staying at home

196
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,292
- I am in-house mechanic!
- What are you muttering?

197
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,333
I'm not a driver
I am the mechanic

198
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,125
Not a mechanic
A madcap-nick!

199
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,833
Check, the horn isn't working

200
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,542
As if only the horn
The whole works is fit for the trash

201
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,333
Looking for the engine?
Not in there

202
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,625
- I've forgotten what fits where
- For you too?

203
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,083
PP uncle!

204
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,542
There's your horn!

205
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,042
All mischievous imps here?

206
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,667
- Yes
- What's your program?

207
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,083
Will you race your car
with my cycle tomorrow?

208
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,125
Wow! But 1 condition

209
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,375
You should cycle
at a slow pace

210
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,208
Even then only I'll win

211
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,000
- How is that?
- Your car won't start at all

212
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,542
God help me!

213
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,708
Not realizing those devils
are ridiculing him

214
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,542
...your dad thinks he's Nehru!

215
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,417
Dad is merging with the kids

216
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
He's oblivious they are taking a dig at him

217
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,375
Goes above your head too?

218
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,125
Do you know how popular my dad is?

219
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:35,167
This whole area is famous
for pollution thanks to his car

220
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,250
You're shooting off your mouth
without knowing about him

221
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:39,875
He's only Chandramouli, right?

222
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,792
Confusing him with
director Rajamouli!

223
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,958
Mr Baahu-bali

224
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,417
On the way to the hospital
you were born in this car's boot

225
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,167
- Don't forget
- I know

226
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,208
That's why you named me Padmini!

227
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,708
Thank God your dad doesn't own
a Sunny bike, imagine my name then!

228
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,375
What...bang on!

229
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,542
Are you still using
this fan like a radio?

230
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,542
Look at the blades swirl
You can sit in cool comfort

231
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,125
It's vice versa, the blades whirl
thanks to the breeze from outside

232
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,125
If you move this, we'll get
better breeze from the window

233
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:17,292
- Sarcasm, eh?
- Your house looks like a junk shop

234
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,083
Thank God you don't have
any of those old lyrics books

235
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,125
Then what is this?

236
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,417
'Mouna Raagam'

237
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,375
Do you at least buy a new calendar
or use an old one every year?

238
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,500
Nowadays 'gold is old', uncle

239
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,333
We have platinum and diamond now

240
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:39,417
You're the 1st person to say platinum
and diamond were discovered only now

241
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,042
He's a gem of a friend!

242
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,958
If he keeps harping 'old is gold'
he might get you married

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,958
...to an 80 year old hag and you will
celebrate your wedding night on a bier!

244
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,625
- Will you shut up?
- Just wait and watch

245
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,042
That holds good for you, Padmini

246
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,417
Raghav, do you want
'dosa' or 'idli'?

247
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,792
I want a new car
Random chaps ridicule me

248
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,042
Who is that random chap out there?

249
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,917
We are going to the show room tomorrow?

250
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,042
Again, huh?

251
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,792
- He has bought it
- He will nod off to sleep

252
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,375
He'll clinch the deal
this time for sure

253
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:15,833
Sir, do you get the same feeling of
caressing your girlfriend for the 1st time?

254
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,625
No

255
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:24,208
Just like a man
about to ditch his girlfriend

256
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,375
...he's fiddling with the car

257
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:27,875
Don't be gross

258
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,792
He'll cut a good deal today

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,083
He only makes us cut a sorry figure

260
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,000
He's here to make it worse

261
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,542
Do you know the commission
you can avail if you buy the car today?

262
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,750
4000?!

263
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,667
He makes 4000 bucks selling 1 car

264
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,542
What did you give me for working
as a mechanic for 20 years?

265
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:45,750
Don't we feed you daily?

266
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,083
Do you use your brains at all?

267
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:52,125
For the past 4 months, I have spent 5000
on your tea, coffee, snacks without GST!

268
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:55,375
Sir, relax, the deal
will be confirmed today

269
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,958
Even the dance show on TV
by Kala madam is over

270
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,833
But I have no hopes pinned on you

271
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,333
I'll get into spiritual mode
if he buys this car today

272
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,917
He's finding excuses
to turn this car down

273
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Shut up!

274
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll pay you Rs 8000 as commission
Just make him buy a car today

275
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,875
But if he drives
it will crawl like a snail

276
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,375
This car has won an Oscar

277
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:20,042
If you clinch the deal today
I'll give you 25...

278
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,292
'Samosas' on the house

279
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,917
You can distribute snacks
to all your relatives

280
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,750
Wasn't it a different model
the last time we came here?

281
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,375
Catch you buying this model
if it was available!

282
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,250
Mr Partha, I know you want to
part with this smashing car

283
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,917
But when we sit
the seat is a little-

284
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:40,000
It's a big seat, last week
even actress Namitha sat there

285
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,875
That's why it's shaking wildly!

286
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,500
We can always change the seat, dad

287
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:48,208
Not only that, if I hold on to
the steering wheel like this-

288
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,167
- It turns, huh?
- Jumps up and down

289
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,292
Is it glam doll Jothilakshmi's hip?

290
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,208
Only your hands are shaking
Sign of old age!

291
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,625
- Check his BP and sugar
- I'll do it now

292
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,542
Sir, convince him somehow

293
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,000
However brand new this car may be

294
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,917
...when I get into it

295
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,208
I don't get the same feeling
as I do when I sit inside 'Padmini'

296
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,375
Neither do I get the feeling
you'll buy a car in this birth, sir

297
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,792
100% right

298
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,542
In olden days they used to
fix a motor to a cycle

299
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,875
Like that, he's driving
a metal body with 4 tyres

300
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,708
Don't call that rattletrap a 'car'

301
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,042
That green car parked there looks good

302
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,417
- We came in that car
- Let's go home in that!

303
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,417
One day we'll buy a car
with your hard earned money

304
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,042
What do you fancy in that car, dad?

305
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,000
What does it lack?
Has a sturdy steering wheel

306
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,625
Emits black smoke-

307
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:36,958
Don't be funny, dad

308
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,833
Why don't you give a proper reason?

309
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,000
Buy a new car

310
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,417
Simply in a nutshell
you want it in 1 line

311
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,292
That car has your mother's soul

312
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,542
Sentiment, huh?

313
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,167
When we 1st went to buy this car

314
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,208
...I didn't like the car or the color

315
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,917
But your mother loved it

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,917
Do you know what she said
after I bought it?

317
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,417
This car should be with us
till the very end

318
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,000
She isn't here

319
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,708
But the car she loved is with me
Will always be with me

320
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,708
Now do you get it?

321
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,500
Someone is calling me

322
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,625
Why is it ringing
as if it's sick and SOS?

323
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:23,292
Your voice isn't clear
I'll put you on speaker mode

324
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,833
- Tell me
- How many times to tell you?

325
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,500
Either change your phone
Or someone will be near you

326
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,792
Borrow that phone
and make a free call

327
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,458
He hung up on me

328
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:36,292
Dad

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,667
Any sentiments on that phone too?

330
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,833
No

331
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,917
Why?

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,375
Finally a new phone

333
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,250
Ramamurthy uncle was so sarcastic
about your old phone

334
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,000
Call him and show off now

335
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:51,792
I am not good with these gadgets

336
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,250
- Turn on the speaker
- That's right

337
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,417
- Do you have video call?
- Do you have Twitter?

338
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,625
Do you any sense?
He hasn't picked up the call

339
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,042
Sailing in the same boat!

340
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,375
I can't hear if you call me
from your rusty old phone

341
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,125
How many times
should I repeat this?

342
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,625
- Hang up
- Don't create a scene

343
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,792
You can hear quite well

344
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,250
Can you make video calls?

345
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,542
- Ask if he has Instagram?
- You have Instagram?

346
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,333
Do you have 'matter' video?

347
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,667
He has his go-down
filled with 'adults only'

348
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:26,417
I know your son has
bought you a new phone

349
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,875
Ask him to get you a new car too

350
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,042
You'll be hassle-free

351
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,542
I know you are with your son

352
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,708
Hang up now

353
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,417
Someone's dicky is dented!

354
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,458
My dicky is in one piece

355
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,417
Is this your scooter?

356
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,542
The tail light is broken
What happened?

357
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:01,875
What is that for?

358
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,750
Tell me your name
and contact details

359
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,458
I'll upload this in Facebook
and Twitter and humiliate you

360
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't approve of all this

361
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,667
- Give me your license
- Are you a lawyer or what?

362
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,083
Not me, but my dad is a famous lawyer

363
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,000
Is that so?
Okay, my mistake

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,500
Without knowing
I grazed your scooter lightly

365
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,417
What do you mean
'very good'?

366
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,958
Within the next 2 hours you repair this
and bring it back to my office

367
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,042
- This is the address
- Let it be

368
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,125
What are you doing?
Female rowdy!

369
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,208
This is my car

370
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,750
It won't start to please you

371
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,208
It started!

372
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,833
Padmini
Bloody traitor!

373
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,917
Who?

374
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,667
I meant my car
She's Padmini

375
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,792
Get lost, take my bike

376
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,792
How rude! Where will I go
in your scooter?

377
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,417
To the mechanic shop

378
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,208
I'll deal with you then

379
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,333
Look here
I'm taking a selfie

380
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,667
Look this side

381
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,500
This view is better

382
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,167
What do they see in this car
to take a selfie?

383
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,542
- You can't go in, sir
- Then get out!

384
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,250
- I'll get the best out of the two
- Why not get both?!

385
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:07,333
- Where are you going?
- Are you Madhu?

386
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,833
- Your dad said Madhu is pretty!
- Sir, stop

387
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,500
We've developed
42 applications till date

388
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,292
Most of them are big hits

389
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,250
The next app has to be
in a different level

390
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,167
Our present app is meant for girls-

391
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,708
Who is Madhu here?

392
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,500
Are you Madhu?

393
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,500
Is your name Madhu?

394
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,417
Her name is Suresh!

395
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,417
- Are you Madhu?
- No

396
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,708
Give me your numb-

397
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,917
I wanted to check
with True Caller app

398
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:34,583
Who are you, sir?

399
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,917
You barged right in
turning a deaf ear to me

400
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,250
Please leave, sir

401
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,750
Who are you?

402
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,167
What is your problem?

403
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,583
I got your bike repaired

404
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:09,250
Mr Chandramouli's car hit your bike
The tail light broke, right?

405
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:10,292
So what?

406
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,292
I am Raghav
Chandramouli's son

407
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,500
What my dad did was very bad

408
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,583
What lies!

409
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:18,333
He shouldn't have done that

410
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,958
'Shouldn't have given birth to you!'

411
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,125
Okay, my keys?

412
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,042
Key, huh?

413
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:28,042
Mechanic told me your chain sprocket
and back brake need to be serviced

414
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,750
I've given him the key

415
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:33,875
As soon as he fixes everything
I'll bring the bike over personally

416
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,458
What do you say, dude?

417
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,167
I asked him to change
only the tail light

418
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,417
Why did you ask him
to meddle with the rest?

419
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,583
Who is he?

420
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,417
You're faster than Snehan in 'Bigg Boss'

421
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,583
Are you out of your mind?
Brainless or what?

422
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,292
Are you thick skinned?

423
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,333
'What a lovely voice!'

424
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,250
Behaving worse than a mongrel!

425
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:02,000
Is this how you treat a girl
you meet for the 1st time?

426
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:14,667
You went to give her an earful
and got yelled at instead

427
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:18,000
If I had yelled at her
end of story today

428
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:20,833
If I get married to her
I can yell at her lifelong, right?

429
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,458
You can't hang around here

430
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,792
Madhu, do you like
that book on Mohammed Ali?

431
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,167
When did you come?

432
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,417
I was telling her about you

433
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,042
As a kid, how you used to
punch without gloves

434
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:23,250
Raghav was not slim and trim
when he was a little boy

435
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,083
You hounded me for 30 days

436
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,625
Then you disappeared into thin air

437
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,708
Even if I had fallen for you

438
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,417
...you would have ditched me, right?

439
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,042
No, you're wron-

440
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:59,875
Why can't you follow me
for another 10 days?

441
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,542
Couldn't you ask me
why I'm not reciprocating your love?

442
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,625
Don't know to fight
nor fall at my feet

443
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,542
Then how will you know to flirt?

444
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,500
You do what you want
Meet any girl you like

445
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:14,958
If you ever come to me again
and profess your love to me...

446
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,167
...I'll butcher you!

447
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,417
"Dear Sind sparrow
My treasure trove"

448
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:09,750
"Dear Sind sparrow
My treasure trove"

449
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:16,250
"I became someone else somehow"

450
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,167
"You are my whole world now"

451
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:31,958
"Jungle sparrow, with your wings sprouting
within me where are you nestling?"

452
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,042
"My lady love, my princess
You preen and feast on my kisses"

453
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:41,708
"My multi hued sparrow
My pretty girl, my true love"

454
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:52,167
"Don't play hide and seek with me"

455
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,875
"Temptingly like a butterfly
I wonder why you flit and fly"

456
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,625
"I'm clueless
My temptress"

457
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:04,625
"In the circle of your shyness diffusing"

458
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:09,500
"Why do you leave me stranded musing?"

459
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,542
"Why I wonder
My sole invader"

460
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:17,458
"Like the river joins the sea
tree will shoulder the mynah duly"

461
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,625
"On satin petals the wind breezes
Similarly honey favors the bees"

462
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:27,583
"Like clouds play 'I spy' with the moon
crabs play 'Catch me' with waves at noon"

463
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:32,667
"Likewise when I unite with you
love's scent will spread anew"

464
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:37,167
"I became someone else somehow"

465
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:42,167
"You are my entire universe now"

466
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:47,625
"I became a new 'me' don't know how"

467
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:52,167
"You are my whole world now"

468
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:22,958
"Like a wife's lap, creeper, plant and tree
A finger is enough to nibble tenderly"

469
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,625
"A song starts lilting
in the direction she's tilting"

470
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,458
"Her voice enchanting
like the drizzle's chanting"

471
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,125
"Your piercing gaze bold
pinches me manifold"

472
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:38,250
"The sand as mattress soft
The sea as counterpane aloft"

473
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:43,750
"Come, let's share our love's bonus
In an island no one will search for us"

474
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,917
"A very different me"

475
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,875
"Your everything I'll be"

476
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,250
"I saw many sides of me somehow"

477
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:36,125
"You are my whole new world now"

478
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:41,458
"Jungle sparrow, with your wings sprouting
within me where are you nesting?"

479
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:46,583
"My lady love, my princess
You preen and feast on my kisses"

480
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:51,708
"My jungle sparrow
My joy for every morrow"

481
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,417
"My love so true"

482
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:06,125
"My one and only true-blue"

483
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,958
"Only you"

484
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,958
'Wasn't Shanthi akka's necklace lovely?'

485
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,917
- The wedding was so grand, right?
- Yes indeed

486
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,917
- That too the food was so delicious
- They did a great job

487
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,000
Buy me ice cream, pa

488
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,917
You just had ice cream
at the wedding

489
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,625
No need any ice cream now

490
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,167
Without fail

491
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,958
What happened?

492
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,667
Any problem?

493
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,625
Why did you stop the car?

494
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,250
What are you doing?

495
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:54,250
Ask them to remove their ornaments

496
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,458
Ask them to give me their jewelry

497
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,792
Don't

498
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,333
Let go of him

499
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,500
Someone save us!

500
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,333
Tell them to take off their jewelry

501
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,167
Tell them now, man

502
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,292
Tell them to remove their jewelry

503
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,625
Aiyo! This door isn't opening

504
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,125
Quick, tell them to
keep everything there

505
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,375
You can take everything

506
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,042
Don't hurt my brother

507
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,167
Don't hurt him

508
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,250
Quick

509
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,792
Let go of my brother

510
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,917
Why did you do this?

511
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,167
'Let go of my child'

512
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,083
God help me!

513
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,750
'Go CAB driver killing 5 passengers
to grab money and jewelry'

514
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:10,542
'...has created sheer panic
throughout the state'

515
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,750
'Vimala age 35
from Vepery'

516
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,375
We warned our boss last week

517
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:17,625
Not even 7 days have gone by

518
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,500
Last night
5 passengers

519
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,667
2 women
Children also

520
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,250
We tracked the vehicle

521
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,417
Utilized by people all over

522
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,542
If their lives are at stake
then how is it safe?

523
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:36,292
The Press wants to know
what action we intend taking

524
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:39,542
We have decided to take whatever
legal action expected of us

525
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:47,167
Both the drivers have
recently joined Go Cabs

526
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:50,417
Either the drivers we recruit
are to be blamed

527
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,333
Or the committee recruiting
our drivers is at fault

528
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,292
Assemble all the drivers tomorrow

529
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,458
Close our services for 1 day

530
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:05,042
Instead of the court asking us
to shut down, one day is nothing

531
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,167
My name is Kumar, sir
I have an experience of 20 years

532
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,500
I have no bad habits
No smoking or drinking

533
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,750
I've already worked
in 4-5 travel agencies

534
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:20,167
You can enquire with them

535
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,917
My name is Satish, sir

536
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,583
I've been a driver for 3 years

537
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,500
I haven't been responsible
for even a minor accident

538
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,417
The police force has cast
a wide net to catch you

539
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:51,833
Car, train or flight, even worse
you can't escape by foot either

540
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,417
But I'll protect you

541
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,042
Your family should be happy, right?

542
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,667
Where can I go and hide?

543
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,417
Go Cab has to shut down

544
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,542
The incidents that follow
should pick up speed

545
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,833
Express speed

546
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,958
Chennai should become Delhi

547
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:13,958
One of you

548
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,917
Why?

549
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,792
It can even be you

550
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,292
My name is Raghav

551
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,417
I have an appointment
with your boss

552
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,125
Can you inform him please?

553
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,458
Send him in

554
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,292
Come in

555
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:07,583
Tell me

556
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,500
A state level match is
being held in Bangalore

557
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,958
Regarding the sponsorship
of that match-

558
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,542
My company is facing
too many problems now

559
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:18,000
I read about it too, sir

560
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:26,250
I can't decide anything
in this kind of dicey situation

561
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,500
I didn't get that sponsorship, dad

562
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,792
He said he is unable to now

563
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,625
Boxing has become
a popular sport in India

564
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,875
We can always find
some other company to sponsor

565
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,958
I don't know what to do now, Madhu

566
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,458
I don't get this, Raghav

567
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,083
Is Chennai the only city in Tamil Nadu?

568
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,625
Is Vinayak the only sponsor?

569
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,083
Chances are countless

570
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:01,542
Am I a cricketer?

571
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,625
You think Ambani or Adani will sponsor me

572
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,625
I am an ordinary boxer
I don't have that kind of pull

573
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:09,708
First, stop thinking you have
to depend on someone

574
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:11,750
Stop

575
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,500
Go and meet the sub inspector
Take your papers

576
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,708
Madhu, book a cab and go home

577
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,625
Go meet the sub inspector

578
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,250
Wait, sir, I'll come
Can't you see I'm talking?

579
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:27,292
- Listen to me
- I'll wait

580
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,750
He will ask for all the papers
and make me wait for half an hour

581
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,958
Best is for you
to go home in a cab

582
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,167
Park your bike to the kerb

583
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:37,333
Worried, your parents will call
if you're late getting back home

584
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,500
Okay, see you

585
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,833
I'll reach home and
message you, okay?

586
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,833
- Your Insurance papers are missing?
- I didn't renew it, sir

587
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,625
You are...?

588
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:51,333
Sir, I was pulled up for
not carrying my license with me

589
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,292
- Aren't you Raghav?
- Yes

590
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,167
Brother, don't you recognize me?

591
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,417
I'm your father's friend
Ramamurthy uncle's nephew

592
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,667
I know your father well

593
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,292
- Muthukumaran
- Sir?

594
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,083
Look into this
and clear it fast

595
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,625
- Okay, sir
- Quick

596
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:06,542
Don't misunderstand
Just pay the fine

597
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,708
Raghav, please convey
my regards to your father

598
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,333
- Sure, sir
- Go home safe

599
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,083
Madhu, where are you?

600
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm still in the car

601
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,333
No, where exactly are you?

602
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,667
Why are you going on the bridge?

603
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,292
The road below is bad, madam

604
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:26,875
I'll call you after I reach home

605
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,167
Okay

606
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,875
Get down

607
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:50,417
What happened?

608
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,625
Come along

609
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:53,875
Come, sit

610
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,167
Missed me a lot, huh?

611
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,625
Piping hot 'dosa'

612
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,750
You're drawing designs
on your plate totally preoccupied

613
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:16,667
That 'dosa' is only half eaten
Who will eat the rest?

614
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,083
- And who will eat this new one?
- I'm not hungry

615
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,167
May I know why?

616
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,458
You haven't got a sponsor
Am I right?

617
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,500
Life is full of miracles

618
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,917
Like this

619
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,667
- What's this?
- Visiting card

620
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,625
Don't eat it
thinking it's a 'dosa'

621
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:39,667
Managing director of Azhagar
Garuda Call Taxi

622
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,750
You have an appointment
with him at 10:00 a.m tomorrow

623
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,667
You may even get a sponsor

624
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Why should I sponsor you?

625
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:02,042
What do I benefit by
favoring you? Tell me

626
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,042
Sir, I didn't come here for a favor

627
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,792
You place your bet
usually on a winning horse

628
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:14,500
I came to ask if you'll bet
this time on a horse sure to win?

629
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:23,167
So are you implying
I'm afraid to take risks?

630
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:30,208
Sir, if that was the case
you won't be in this seat today

631
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,750
Utilizing an opportunity
offered by someone

632
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,500
...you've reached this position

633
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,250
Same way, I believe
an opportunity given by you

634
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,875
...will make me
reach great heights

635
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:45,333
What did you say your name was?

636
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:46,750
Raghav, sir

637
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:51,125
You should display the same attitude
in the forthcoming tournament as well

638
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,667
Hey! You're a real madcap

639
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,333
I thought the way you spoke
he'll pound you to a pulp

640
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,542
Why did you talk to him
so belligerently?

641
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,875
If I am afraid of fighting with him
how will I fight in the ring?

642
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:12,333
Well said
Call your dad

643
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,833
Let's go home and tell him

644
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,458
Hey! Poor thing
Let's tell him

645
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,458
No, we shouldn't
Try and look sad

646
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,458
Is my face alright?

647
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,667
Do I look sad enough?

648
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,833
Whom do you want to meet?

649
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,042
He isn't at home now

650
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,875
I'm his younger cousin, Mandramouli

651
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,125
Bingo!

652
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,208
You are that handsome young man

653
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,750
His son, Raghav

654
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:22,000
And you are that beautiful young girl

655
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,250
I know you've got a sponsor
Go party and then come back

656
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,125
I'll come along too

657
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:00,833

Freeze!

681
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,458
What happened?

682
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,833
Hey! What are you doing?

683
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:36,500
The doors are locked

684
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:38,083
You can't escape, be quiet

685
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,667
I'm telling you
Shut up!

686
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,542
Don't scream
Come here

687
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:44,417
Let go of me

688
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:46,042
Shut up!

689
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,375
Please don't hurt me

690
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:55,375
I'm getting married in 10 days

691
00:48:55,542 --> 00:48:56,833
Please let me go

692
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,250
Shut up

693
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,708
Leave me alone

694
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,125
Bro, I followed your orders

695
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:25,500
Shall I leave the girl in the car
and escape from here?

696
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:27,750
Surrender yourself to the police

697
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,250
Bro...?

698
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,042
Just do as I say

699
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:35,333
And kill the girl

700
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:38,167
Okay, bro

701
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:44,208
Please let me go

702
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:47,625
Don't hurt me

703
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:50,958
Don't

704
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:59,167
As usual after work
the girl has taken a Go Cab car

705
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:03,167
When the driver stopped suddenly
she has asked what was wrong

706
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,833
'Hello, why are you
going on the bridge?'

707
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:09,250
Without replying, the driver
misbehaved with the girl

708
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:13,000
We came based on the information
given by the watchman here

709
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:14,583
We've arrested the driver

710
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:18,000
Poor girl!
We couldn't save her

711
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:23,333
'The continued violence by Go Cab drivers
is creating further panic in Chennai'

712
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,750
The general public need not panic

713
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,750
We are providing
the necessary protection

714
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:29,000
Will any action be taken
against that company, ma'am?

715
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:30,583
45 days notice has been issued to them

716
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:34,083
Only the court can decide whether
Go Cab can function or close down

717
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:37,333
Is it true the CEO
will be arrested, ma'am?

718
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,083
See you, dad

719
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,042
Just because I'm not there
don't eat in roadside stalls

720
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:50,625
Don't stay up too long at night
Don't skip your tablets either

721
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,375
Only you must take care
of your health

722
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,708
I have to leave now

723
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,333
I'll be away for a week

724
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,708
Looks like you'll take
a week to leave this place

725
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,625
- It's getting late
- Shut up, dude

726
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,333
Have your breakfast
without fail, okay?

727
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,333
Don't forget lunch and dinner

728
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:23,042
She has lived many years
without you, just go now

729
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:24,792
Shouldn't I come to the station?

730
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,250
Start now, we'll pick you up
when he returns

731
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,792
Then shall I drop you at home?

732
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,167
- I need to get back today, uncle
- That's also true

733
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,458
- Then you have to walk
- That's much faster

734
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,542
- Both of you take care of dad
- We'll handle all that, go

735
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:39,542
What do they know
about our Padmini's value?

736
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:41,958
- They have no clue
- Smooth operator!

737
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,042
- Shall I drop you home?
- I'll make my own way

738
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:48,958
Padmini seems to be a holy terror!

739
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:57,042
There's a lot of expectation
from you, Raghav

740
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:59,958
7 days from now
if things go in your favor

741
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:01,667
...you'll be the champion

742
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,333
Dinner will be sent to your room

743
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,208
- I'll freshen up and join you
- Okay, coach

744
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,125
- Did you like it?
- Very much

745
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:46,583
Every punch of yours should
prove your worth to your opponent

746
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:50,125
- You call yourself my girlfriend?
- Why?

747
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,042
Girlfriends don't endorse violence

748
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:55,750
But you encourage me to fight!

749
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,208
Yes, I love to fight

750
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,083
Hug you tight
Roll over and over

751
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:05,875
I miss you a lot you know

752
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:10,500
- You could have come with me
- You never called me

753
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:12,750
If I had called you
would you have come?

754
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,833
Definitely

755
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17,083
A girl can't do everything on her own

756
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,042
Boys need to initiate certain moves

757
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:21,208
Okay, so I'm calling you now
Come over

758
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,333
Okay, open your door

759
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,708
Er...what?

760
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,792
Open the door

761
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:35,583
"My mischievous minx in all ways"

762
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:42,542
"My mind filled with thoughts of you always"

763
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,083
Hey! Come in

764
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,792
What are you doing here?

765
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,500
I reached before you

766
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,208
Okay, there's another surprise for you

767
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:54,958
What's that?

768
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:04,083
"Mischievous minx"

769
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,250
I'll be damned!

770
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:08,583
Girls plan far ahead of boys!

771
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:13,333
"My love, not able to see you
my life has a crack running through"

772
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,250
Fight, huh?
What kind of fight?

773
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:21,083
Roll over, hugging tight

774
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,208
If only the coach catches us-

775
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:27,417
Both of us will be crucified

776
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:41,875
"I was leading my life happy actually
Infusing love now why do you torture me?"

777
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:47,833
"In the atrium of my heart that was locked
why did you enter to forever dock?"

778
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:53,833
"You lit a lamp within me perfect
I kindled you like a small insect"

779
00:54:53,833 --> 00:55:00,417
"Not even a second away from me
I want you by my side, my fair lady"

780
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:05,458
"You merge into my heart, girlie
like the wind instinctively"

781
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,417
"Thanks to you, darling
something in me is swirling"

782
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:14,417
"Cross many a tough barrier
Reside in me forever, my dear"

783
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:19,708
"I was leading my life happy actually
Infusing love now why do you torture me?"

784
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:23,417
"Not even a second away from me"

785
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:27,625
"I want you by my side, my lovely lady"

786
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:05,333
"Life stretches ahead for eternity
My wish-list extends to infinity"

787
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:11,458
"Will our love continue to our next birth?
You're the only man for me on this earth"

788
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:17,250
"My heartbeats tattoo a rhythm true
Whimpers yearning only for you"

789
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:23,417
"I want an everlasting boon sublime
to be with you till the end of time"

790
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:29,375
"I throw a temper tantrum obstinate
I want only her as my soulmate"

791
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:32,167
"I am near you here
in your soul there, dear"

792
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:35,250
"I merge in you here"

793
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:41,042
"You lit the lamp within me perfect
I kindled you like a small insect"

794
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:44,375
"Not even a second away from me"

795
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:47,708
"I want you by my side, my fair lady"

796
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,417
You are at home, right?

797
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,583
Have you told your son
all that happened?

798
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,083
I'll tell Raghav today-

799
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:10,750
No, something...I'll call back

800
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:32,250
Hey! When did you both come?

801
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,583
What a surprise!
When did you-

802
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:40,917
Double surprise, dad?

803
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,333
This may not be a surprise

804
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:45,750
It's our car

805
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,417
Bought with my sweat, dad

806
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,458
I didn't borrow from anyone
I didn't take a bank loan

807
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,750
We aren't answerable
to anyone either

808
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:56,667
Madhu gifted me a pair
of gloves in Bangalore, dad

809
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,542
I won that tournament
wearing those gloves

810
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,250
That's how I won
this beautiful car as a gift

811
00:58:03,042 --> 00:58:04,333
That was when it hit me

812
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,917
I should fight lifelong
wearing those gloves

813
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,708
You feel the same way
about your car, right?

814
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,000
Mom's favorite car
You've travelled with her

815
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,750
Hereafter this car will be
in this house for keeps

816
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:22,875
Not just be parked here

817
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,750
Every weekend
we'll go for a drive in it

818
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:39,917
Dad

819
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:43,083
Not asleep?

820
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,167
Why haven't you slept?

821
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:51,417
Shall we go for a drive?

822
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:54,500
Drive after midnight?

823
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,667
New car, night drive

824
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,542
Let's take our Padmini

825
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,250
You won't let go of Padmini
till the very end, huh?

826
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,708
Father and son enjoying
a night drive at 3:00 a.m

827
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,125
Something is missing, pa

828
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,208
You don't seem to be
your usual energetic self

829
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,333
Any problem?

830
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,083
Raghav I need to tell you some-

831
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:44,792
What I'm about to tell you
might scare you

832
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:47,042
But as a doctor
I have to tell you

833
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,792
The optic nerve connecting
your brain and eyes has been damaged

834
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:57,917
Medically we call this condition
as optical atrophy

835
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,833
Your eyesight will remain this way

836
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:06,708
You won't be able
to see beyond 2 feet

837
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:28,000
Can it be cured with laser
or some surgery like that?

838
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,042
May be in the future such a treatment is
possible, or may not even be a possibility

839
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:36,583
This is how his condition will be

840
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:38,708
Can we see him, doctor?

841
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,833
By all means

842
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:52,625
Who is that?

843
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,125
Dude...?

844
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,042
Machan, how is my dad?

845
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,292
What happened to my dad?

846
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,792
One of you
please tell me

847
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,583
What happened to him?

848
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,917
Madhu, tell me

849
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,750
"Will this pain not fade forever?"

850
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:32,792
"Won't this night dissolve to disappear?"

851
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:36,875
"Will this pain not go away ever?"

852
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:40,750
"Will this night not illusively disappear?"

853
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:44,958
"Without you in my life daily"

854
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,625
"What will become of me?"

855
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:53,125
"You loved me like a mother unconditionally"

856
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:58,333
"But now you've gone far away from me"

857
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:19,042
"Why did you leave me?
Left me behind in agony"

858
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:23,333
"To struggle all alone here in misery"

859
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:27,625
"Why did you abandon me?
Why did you shroud me in misery?"

860
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:31,917
"At a distance so far away I cannot see"

861
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,792
I'm inspector Mukhil
from Neelangarai police station

862
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,667
This is just a formality

863
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:56,417
I can close this case
only if he signs

864
01:07:56,667 --> 01:08:00,208
2 days ago I came here
I was told he wasn't conscious

865
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,500
Since his father died
in this accident...

866
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:05,667
...do you have any suspicion
about anyone in particular?

867
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:14,125
Read this fully
We require his signature

868
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:26,792
I got Raghav's signature, sir

869
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:28,250
Does he suspect foul play?

870
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:29,333
Not at all, sir

871
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:30,958
He believes this is an accident

872
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,333
He isn't suspicious at all

873
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,958
Call me if he thinks otherwise

874
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,542
I'll handle it, sir

875
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:38,292
Raghav, you can be discharged now

876
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,500
But give ample rest to your eyes

877
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:43,542
Don't force yourself to focus
if objects seem blurred

878
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:46,333
Bring him for check up next week

879
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:10,917
"Sometimes in the hands of destiny"

880
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:15,792
"A turn for the worse in life's journey"

881
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:19,917
"From life’s tumultuous turbulence
To reach the shores of safeness"

882
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:24,208
"I want you again in my life
to protect me from all the strife"

883
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:28,375
"You were my friend and philosopher"

884
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:32,583
"Why did you desert me in mid-river?"

885
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:36,792
"Without you, I’m all forlorn
How can I live alone?"

886
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:41,833
"I have no clue
what I will do"

887
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:54,792
Dad

888
01:09:56,042 --> 01:09:57,708
All this is false, right?

889
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:02,042
You'll be back again, won't you?

890
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,917
It isn't true, is it?

891
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:12,250
I can't live alone like this

892
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,792
I won't try to control you, dad

893
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:20,708
You can use your old phone

894
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,042
You need not dye your hair

895
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,500
We'll go only in your Padmini

896
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:36,042
I never volunteered to push
your beloved car even once

897
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:40,833
I want to go for a drive with you just once

898
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,875
I can't be without you, pa

899
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:53,250
Do you know, dad?

900
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,583
I can't...I am unable to

901
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,750
I can't go back to boxing

902
01:10:58,042 --> 01:11:00,500
I can't see, dad

903
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:03,958
I have to be in this house
groping in darkness

904
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,750
Don't leave me in the lurch, pa

905
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,708
Please don't desert me, dad

906
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:14,333
Don't leave me alone, dad

907
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,958
Come here, dad

908
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,208
"Why did you leave me?
Left me behind in agony"

909
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:37,458
"You left me wrapped alone in misery"

910
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,625
"Why did you drown me
in a state of despondency?"

911
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:45,917
"Why did you abandon me
At a distance so far away I cannot see"

912
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,125
Raghav, let's go out

913
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:06,750
Don't joke

914
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:09,458
You can't see beyond 2 feet
That's the problem, right?

915
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,917
But you can see for 2 feet?

916
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,125
Come on

917
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,583
I'm not in the mood to go out

918
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,708
I can't bear to see you this way

919
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:23,208
When you fell down while boxing
and people thought you won't get up...

920
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,292
...you proved them wrong

921
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,500
You've won

922
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,500
You can do the same now

923
01:12:29,417 --> 01:12:30,542
Come

924
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:36,458
"I lived with this awareness
you were my harness"

925
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:39,417
"But you were my path to happiness"

926
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:43,583
"Did you forget me?
Will you disagree?"

927
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:47,875
"Without you alive
how can I survive"

928
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:51,958
"No Gods were necessary"

929
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,208
"Your love was more than exemplary"

930
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:00,500
"Now are any Gods watching over me?"

931
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:04,625
"To wipe my tears of misery?"

932
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,375
How long will you be here?

933
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,250
You go back home

934
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:40,042
I've already explained to my parents

935
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:44,125
I'll get it

936
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,667
I'm coming from
the cemetery in Besant Nagar

937
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,250
- This is the original death certificate
- Okay, I'll take it

938
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:53,125
Call Mr Chandramouli, he has signed it
I must hand it over personally to him

939
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,625
Uncle has signed, huh?

940
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,000
Whose death certificate?

941
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:59,000
Bairavi who died on
the 19th of last month

942
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:03,042
We don't know anyone by name Bairavi

943
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:04,708
I think you have
the wrong address

944
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,375
Isn't this Mr Chandramouli's residence?

945
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:08,333
- Yes
- Please call him, sir

946
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:13,667
He died 2 weeks ago

947
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:15,667
Is that so?

948
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,875
Then you sign and
take this certificate

949
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:21,333
I don't even know who she is
Don't pester me

950
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:23,625
Mr Chandramouli has signed
as her caretaker

951
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:26,042
You can check if you don't believe me

952
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:30,458
I told him I'll personally hand it
over to him in 10-15 days

953
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,458
I got it today
I brought it at once

954
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:38,042
This is my dad's signature

955
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,750
Is she some relative
on his paternal side?

956
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:49,792
- No
- What about your mother's side?

957
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:53,167
Not a single relative has visited us
from her side after her marriage

958
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:54,917
Why this secrecy?

959
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,833
Let's go and meet Ramamurthy uncle

960
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:05,875
Raghav, I never imagined life will
become topsy-turvy in a single day

961
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:08,708
When the doctors told me you can
see only 2 feet in front of yo-

962
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,167
Who is Bairavi, uncle?

963
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,167
Which Bairavi?

964
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:26,417
The lady for whom my dad
performed the entire funeral rites

965
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:34,208
Raghav, go home now
We'll talk about this later

966
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,500
No, uncle
I need to know

967
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:44,417
I know he has shared many details with you
which he hasn't shared with us

968
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,667
Tell me

969
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,958
He has spoken often
about that girl to me

970
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:28,417
He and I usually take the train

971
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:29,958
Train?

972
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:33,208
He didn't want you to know

973
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:36,792
He told me you'll be angry
if you knew about it

974
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:44,000
Ramu, why are you sitting
and reading a book here?

975
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,167
You didn't catch the previous train

976
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,750
Your son wants to
get you a new car

977
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:51,667
Instead of coming late like this
why don't you relent?

978
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,292
You know about my Padmini

979
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,333
She may stop
but she won't stop me!

980
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:56,625
What do you know?

981
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:58,875
2 days ago
in the petrol bunk

982
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:00,208
Your car stopped, huh?

983
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,875
My car was made to stop!

984
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:06,250
Is the air in all the tyres okay?

985
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:16,958
What?

986
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,375
Why should I open?

987
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,125
I am Bairavi

988
01:17:21,292 --> 01:17:22,458
Melodious name!

989
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:23,625
You are?

990
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,917
Do you intend selling this car?

991
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:30,042
Have you seen it before?

992
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,458
- No
- So, you like the color?

993
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,208
None of my possessions are for sale

994
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,625
- Mr Chandramouli
- What?

995
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:43,375
- If you don't mind
- No, I don't

996
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:46,667
If you plan to sell
this car through OLX

997
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:47,708
No, I won't

998
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,000
I doubt if you'll get
20000-25000?

999
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,250
I won't get

1000
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:56,292
Are you in the minting business?

1001
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,500
This car you see now

1002
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,042
Doesn't belong to me

1003
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:11,875
Start, don't be stubborn now!

1004
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Hey mirror
Go up, double quick

1005
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:19,833
Now what?

1006
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,542
Can I click a snap of your car?

1007
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,292
Then with your permission
can I go now?

1008
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:38,458
- Shall I send you this snap?
- How?

1009
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:41,042
To my mobile, huh?

1010
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:42,500
I can only receive calls

1011
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:45,083
- I don't have WhatsApp
- Give me your phone

1012
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:48,292
Looks like she'll rob me of everything

1013
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,167
That's the only phone I have

1014
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,167
- What are you doing?
- This is my number

1015
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:56,208
If you ever change your mind

1016
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:59,375
- Why?
- I know this is your car

1017
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:02,208
Ho...how do you know that?

1018
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,083
- What is your name?
- I've saved your number

1019
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,333
Ghajini memory!

1020
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:10,500
'After 2 days that lady called your father'

1021
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:13,208
Hello, is it Chandramouli?

1022
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,333
- Yes, speaking
- Hi, Bairavi here

1023
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,458
Who is this?

1024
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:19,333
I saw you in the petrol bunk
I wanted to buy your car

1025
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,792
Pay 1 lakh for your car?

1026
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:24,292
- Mr Chandramouli
- Wh...who is that?

1027
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:39,125
Who is it...where?

1028
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,875
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you

1029
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:46,958
- Why are you here?
- I came to board a train

1030
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,083
Then Padmini?

1031
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,292
I have left her in the service station

1032
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,125
Is your service station
in West Mambalam parking lot?

1033
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:56,292
- Have you seen it?
- I saw that

1034
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,542
Padmini has a mind of her own
to run or stand still

1035
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:03,708
I'll come here, take a train to work
Padmini takes me back home

1036
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,542
- Your car is old
- What?

1037
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:07,750
You think my Padmini is old?

1038
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,917
At your age
how far do you walk daily?

1039
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,250
10 km

1040
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:13,750
I walk 12 km at my age

1041
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,833
At her age Padmini said
she can only go upto Mambalam

1042
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:18,792
I agreed and parked Padmini here

1043
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,958
Poor thing!
I shouldn't strain her

1044
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,750
- Your train is here
- What?

1045
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,875
- It is here
- Thank God! Bye

1046
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:29,750
Sir, I have applied for a loan

1047
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,500
- Yes
- Please help me out

1048
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:33,250
But you are not Nirav Modi!

1049
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:36,458
How many times do I tell you?
I am Swaminathan, sir

1050
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,208
I know but I can't
sanction to a Swaminathan

1051
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,250
- So you work in a bank
- Yes

1052
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:45,250
Do you have the habit
of eavesdropping too?

1053
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:46,667
Slightly

1054
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,750
I'm working in a bank and you?

1055
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:51,542
I am an accountant
in Garuda Call Taxi

1056
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:54,042
Why haven't I seen you
in this train before?

1057
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,625
I've just shifted to Tambaram from T.Nagar

1058
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,375
Today is my 1st day at work

1059
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:00,167
Very good
Poor chap!

1060
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:06,250
I saw a friendship gradually
blossoming between them

1061
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:13,000
Still a hello, huh?
Not stored my name as yet?

1062
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,125
Look ahead

1063
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:17,458
- Where?
- Mr Chandramouli

1064
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,458
You're right here

1065
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,000
Calling me from here, huh?

1066
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:36,792
"In all the seasons she is spring in bloom"

1067
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,667
There's a chap in a black shirt
sitting behind me

1068
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:41,750
Who?

1069
01:21:41,917 --> 01:21:44,417
- Yes, I saw him
- What will he think about us?

1070
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:47,000
Why should he think about us?

1071
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:48,458
Are we thinking about him?

1072
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:50,167
- No
- Lucky fellow!

1073
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:53,167
He will think an old man
is flirting with a chic chick!

1074
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,625
Who is the old man?

1075
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,000
Who is the chick then?

1076
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:59,958
- In your mind
- That's what he'll think

1077
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:02,208
Who doesn't want to feel young?

1078
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,833
- Have you ever given it a thought?
- About what?

1079
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,000
Dating a young girl

1080
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:08,792
The thought hits me quite often

1081
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,667
But I can't find that glam-doll!

1082
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:36,708
"Somehow I don't know
I blush from head to toe"

1083
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:42,000
"I was guarded ever so safely
You feasted on me easily"

1084
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:46,542
"You showered concern on me
Then you swayed away brazenly"

1085
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:51,792
"Even after you disappeared from sight
you sparkled in my heart ever so bright"

1086
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:56,833
"You make my desires overflow and how!"

1087
01:22:56,875 --> 01:23:01,375
"Where are you off to, leaving me now?"

1088
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:06,917
"There are no words to describe you, lady"

1089
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:09,167
"If you stand next to me"

1090
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:13,500
"I smile, I explode, I stare, smile shyly"

1091
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:17,792
I'll save the number

1092
01:23:19,417 --> 01:23:20,792
Do you play chess?

1093
01:23:21,917 --> 01:23:22,917
No, I don't

1094
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:25,167
Since your memory is remarkable

1095
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,167
Because I didn't store the number

1096
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:28,250
Yes

1097
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:30,833
When I talk over the phone
it gets recorded at once

1098
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,667
You want to listen to our conversation?

1099
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:36,167
- No
- Listen

1100
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:37,625
- To what?
- Listen

1101
01:23:40,417 --> 01:23:42,167
'- Hi, I am Bairavi?
- Who is it?'

1102
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,792
'- We met in the petrol bunk'
- Erase it

1103
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:46,000
'Bomb in a petrol bunk?'

1104
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:47,542
Erase it immediately

1105
01:23:49,542 --> 01:23:53,250
"Your lips remind me of red cherries"

1106
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:58,292
"When I see you, those are my memories"

1107
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:03,542
"Even the sun's rays will lessen its glow"

1108
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:07,750
"When I walk past your shadow"

1109
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,417
"Like railway tracks you and me"

1110
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:19,458
"We should travel till eternity"

1111
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:24,167
"When I breathe my last till the very end"

1112
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:29,625
"I want you by my side as my best friend"

1113
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:39,542
"Somehow I don’t know
I blush from head to toe"

1114
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:44,167
"I was guarded ever so safely
You feasted on me easily"

1115
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:49,417
"You showered concern on me
Then you swayed away brazenly"

1116
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:54,417
"Even after you disappeared from sight
you sparkled in my heart ever so bright"

1117
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,042
You go home
I have to leave too

1118
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:58,542
- Drop me on the way
- I can't

1119
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:00,708
- Why?
- Car won't start

1120
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:02,708
Basically no one should sit in your car

1121
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,167
That's what I've been saying

1122
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:06,083
You can sell this
and buy a new one

1123
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:08,792
Not 1 more to the list!
You sound just like my son

1124
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,625
What else does he say?

1125
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,583
He wants me to dye my hair

1126
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,667
Exchange this car

1127
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:17,000
He replaced my old mobile

1128
01:25:17,042 --> 01:25:19,167
But I refused to dye
or change my car

1129
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:24,458
"Somehow I don’t know
Shyness pinches me head to toe"

1130
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:29,417
"I was guarded ever so safely
You feasted on me easily"

1131
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:34,167
"You showered concern on me
Then you breezed away brazenly"

1132
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:39,542
"Even after you disappeared from sight
you sparkled in my heart ever so bright"

1133
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:44,167
"You make my desires overflow and how!"

1134
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:49,083
"Where are you off to, leaving me now?"

1135
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:54,458
"There are no words to describe you, lady"

1136
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,917
"If you stand next to me"

1137
01:25:56,958 --> 01:26:02,375
"I smile, I explode, I stare blankly
And then I smile flirtatiously

1138
01:26:02,917 --> 01:26:04,125
Who is calling me?

1139
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:09,083
I didn't get the sponsorship, pa

1140
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,958
We can try some other sponsor

1141
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:16,875
What happened?

1142
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:21,417
CEO of Go Cab said
he will sponsor his match

1143
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,875
Now he is backing out

1144
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,167
- Shall I try?
- For a sponsor?

1145
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,708
Ask him to go and meet
Azhagar, CEO of Garuda Call Taxi

1146
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:32,625
Ask your son to meet him tomorrow

1147
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,417
I'll ensure he gets the sponsorship

1148
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:36,625
- Suppose he doesn't get?
- If he gets?

1149
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,000
You should dye your hair

1150
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:40,500
This is not on

1151
01:26:40,542 --> 01:26:42,167
This is only called blackmail

1152
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,333
Call your dad

1153
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:50,458
We will tell him in person
No, let's go home

1154
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:04,708
- Is dye and dress okay?
- Does Raghav like it?

1155
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,833
He doesn't like it

1156
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:08,250
He doesn't like it one bit

1157
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:11,167
That's why he gave a party in the evening

1158
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:20,167
Instead of thanking me...

1159
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:23,458
...can we do away with this respect
of 'vango' and say 'vaa'?

1160
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,000
That's very difficult for me

1161
01:27:25,792 --> 01:27:28,250
'You come' is 'nee vaa'
Not 'neenga vaango'

1162
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:30,333
'Nee vaango'

1163
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:31,750
'Nee pongo'

1164
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:48,417
I'm hosting a party in the evening
Wanted to know if you can drop by

1165
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:50,042
I'll come but I don't drink

1166
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:53,000
Party doesn't mean
drowning in alcohol!

1167
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,583
- We can eat together
- Yes, we can

1168
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:57,125
I can polish my plate clean!

1169
01:27:58,375 --> 01:27:59,583
Where?

1170
01:28:08,917 --> 01:28:10,708
But it isn't my birthday today

1171
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,417
I never said it's your birthday

1172
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:15,750
You can invite me as
the only guest for your party!

1173
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:18,333
Should I give you a gift
only if it's your birthday?

1174
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:21,333
We might as well have eaten at home

1175
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,792
- In your house
- We agreed, informal speech!

1176
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:26,167
Okay, fine
Dinner for us

1177
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,583
We could have

1178
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,333
But dogs will bark

1179
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:31,625
Are there so many doggies in your house?

1180
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:33,500
Not inside but outside

1181
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:36,667
Neighboring houses
and roadside

1182
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:39,667
Let them bark
Why should we bother?

1183
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:43,833
You resemble my dad

1184
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:49,583
In fact that's why
I wanted to buy your car

1185
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:52,958
Even my dad had
the same model same color

1186
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,792
That's why I asked you

1187
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,875
I realized only after
befriending you

1188
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:00,250
...your character is also like my dad's

1189
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:04,458
Don't think I will call you 'dad'

1190
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:20,292
What happened to your father?

1191
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,875
5 years ago we were having lunch

1192
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:30,333
He complained of pain in his chest

1193
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:32,875
We rushed him to the hospital

1194
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,750
Doctor examined him

1195
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,042
And said he is no more

1196
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:47,042
I suddenly feel everything is over

1197
01:29:49,542 --> 01:29:51,625
I am used to staying by myself

1198
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:58,458
Have I been monopolizing
our conversation?

1199
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:00,750
Tell me about yourself

1200
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:09,500
How did you cope-

1201
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,708
With so much pain

1202
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,542
My son is in Bangalore
because of you

1203
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,333
Then this dinner is on you

1204
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,833
The sponsor was for my son

1205
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,833
Looks like it may rain

1206
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:41,125
I'll drop you at home

1207
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:42,625
But your wife sat here

1208
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,958
Even your emotions aren't for sale, right?

1209
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:55,500
Get into the car
I will drop you at your home

1210
01:30:57,417 --> 01:31:00,542
Padmini, don't embarrass me
Please start this once

1211
01:31:09,917 --> 01:31:12,875
Looks like it may rain, get in
I'll drop you home

1212
01:31:12,917 --> 01:31:14,667
We are already inside the car

1213
01:31:14,917 --> 01:31:16,667
We are sitting inside the car

1214
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:18,250
Time to go, Chandramouli

1215
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:20,625
- Can we listen to music?
- What?

1216
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,417
No...not that

1217
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:23,917
That isn't a player

1218
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:25,625
Player look-alike
Empty box

1219
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,875
Why all this?
Memories

1220
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,333
The hair is pinned
with a clip at the back

1221
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:33,417
Take a left here

1222
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,375
Drive carefully

1223
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,583
"Seconds that melt away regardless
Wave your wand to make time endless"

1224
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:54,542
"A bond mystifying and bewildering
Bridge the gap for it to extend endearing"

1225
01:31:54,625 --> 01:32:00,792
"When hair turns silver gray
memories swirl and stay"

1226
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:07,750
"Dreams dissolve into oblivion
Ties of reality as benediction"

1227
01:32:07,792 --> 01:32:13,583
"How do I name this bond unusual
that’s spellbinding and soulful?"

1228
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:18,167
'4 days after you went to Bangalore'

1229
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:22,000
'Your father called me at night
around 10:30 or so'

1230
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:24,833
Why are you calling me
so late at night?

1231
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:28,042
What do you mean?

1232
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,125
Family friend

1233
01:32:40,417 --> 01:32:41,750
I am her family friend

1234
01:32:55,917 --> 01:32:57,292
Who is this victim?

1235
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:59,375
- How did she die?
- It's a murder

1236
01:32:59,917 --> 01:33:01,792
The victim is Bairavi

1237
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:05,875
She was murdered when she was
on her way home from work

1238
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:08,792
Have you arrested
the offenders involved in this?

1239
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,708
We have arrested the Go cab driver

1240
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:14,333
Only her post-mortem result
will throw more light on this

1241
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:17,250
This sort of crime
takes place only in Go Cabs

1242
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,708
Can we know why?

1243
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,250
Your deduction is true

1244
01:33:20,542 --> 01:33:23,167
This is the 4th crime
by a Go Cab driver

1245
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,583
We have set up
a new team for this

1246
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:28,917
We are investigating
Very soon you'll know the truth

1247
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:32,917
After the post-mortem

1248
01:33:32,917 --> 01:33:36,125
...it was your father
who performed her funeral rites

1249
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:59,875
Isn't your nephew a sub-inspector?

1250
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:02,292
- Yes, he is
- I want to meet him

1251
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:03,583
Why?

1252
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,583
Contrary to what everyone thinks

1253
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:08,250
Bairavi wasn't killed by that driver

1254
01:34:09,167 --> 01:34:14,000
Through Madhavan I want to meet
a superior officer and tell him the truth

1255
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:15,375
That's why

1256
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:18,333
Why buy trouble unnecessarily?

1257
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:27,417
Sir, sign here

1258
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:30,333
I spoke to my nephew after that

1259
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:33,792
They went and met
the deputy commissioner

1260
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:35,958
Don't get involved in Bairavi's case

1261
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,583
Why?
What happened?

1262
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:39,167
Just listen to what I say

1263
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,125
Too many bigwigs are involved in this

1264
01:34:41,167 --> 01:34:43,833
I'm repeating what my seniors told me

1265
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:46,750
She's known to Chandramouli

1266
01:34:46,792 --> 01:34:48,917
Even if I do
he won't keep quiet

1267
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,667
Everything is over

1268
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:15,042
He wanted to tell you
all that had happened

1269
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:17,292
That's why he called you for a drive

1270
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,167
What happened to him
wasn't an accident

1271
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,750
He was run over by a lorry and killed

1272
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:26,750
Watch your step

1273
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:32,625
'Bairavi wasn't killed by that driver'

1274
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,292
'I need to tell you some-'

1275
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:43,750
In which station
is Ramamurthy uncle's nephew?

1276
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:45,083
Not only me

1277
01:35:45,125 --> 01:35:48,750
Even if you ask my senior officers
they won't be able to tell you

1278
01:35:48,792 --> 01:35:52,750
It's true I took your father
to meet the deputy commissioner

1279
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:54,333
After they spoke

1280
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:57,417
...I was called and
I was warned not to interfere

1281
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:59,000
I don't know anything else

1282
01:36:16,583 --> 01:36:19,042
What are you searching for?

1283
01:36:23,292 --> 01:36:25,750
The FIR copy of the lorry driver

1284
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:29,250
Someone must have
instructed him to do so

1285
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:31,708
This is his address

1286
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:35,542
Who is it?

1287
01:36:41,417 --> 01:36:42,583
Who the hell is-

1288
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:47,458
Who are you, sir?

1289
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:50,208
Remember a car accident 20 days ago?

1290
01:36:50,292 --> 01:36:53,417
His father died in that accident

1291
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:56,125
He wanted to meet you
regarding that

1292
01:37:00,667 --> 01:37:02,125
Please forgive me

1293
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:05,208
I have been driving for 10 years

1294
01:37:05,417 --> 01:37:07,583
Nothing like this has ever happened

1295
01:37:11,417 --> 01:37:13,833
My bad luck, this happened

1296
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,875
I swear on my son, sir

1297
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:19,375
Kill me, sir

1298
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:21,208
Kill me

1299
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:22,833
Let go of him

1300
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:24,250
Let's go

1301
01:37:40,542 --> 01:37:42,708
- 'Bro, this is Mani'
- Tell me

1302
01:37:43,167 --> 01:37:45,500
Raghav landed at my doorstep
all of a sudden

1303
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,333
Chandramouli's son?

1304
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:49,083
I was shell shocked seeing him

1305
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,542
'I didn't know what to do'

1306
01:37:50,667 --> 01:37:51,750
Then?

1307
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:54,000
He fell for my Oscar winning performance

1308
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,208
- Hope he didn't suspect you?
- Not one bit

1309
01:37:57,708 --> 01:37:58,917
Wait, bro

1310
01:37:59,292 --> 01:38:00,417
Who is-

1311
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:02,292
I left my mobile here

1312
01:38:08,375 --> 01:38:09,458
Here

1313
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:33,875
We overheard your conversation

1314
01:38:33,917 --> 01:38:35,208
Whom did you call?

1315
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:37,250
Give me your phone

1316
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:39,333
- Making trouble?
- Give it, I say

1317
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:42,458
Don't spare him

1318
01:38:47,875 --> 01:38:49,167
Nab him

1319
01:38:54,042 --> 01:38:55,458
Don't let him get away

1320
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:40,208
'Contrary to what everyone thinks'

1321
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:42,333
'Bairavi wasn't killed by that driver'

1322
01:41:44,542 --> 01:41:46,542
'Too many bigwigs are involved in this'

1323
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:51,250
'Do you have any suspicion
about anyone in particular?'

1324
01:41:57,208 --> 01:42:01,667
'3 drivers were caught by the police
in the past 4 incidents'

1325
01:42:01,833 --> 01:42:03,583
'Somehow 1 chap has escaped'

1326
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:07,917
If we hunt them down
and at least nab 1 driver

1327
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:11,042
...we can find out
the mastermind

1328
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:14,083
All the incidents
are not in your favor

1329
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:15,625
- In 10 days
- 1 minute

1330
01:42:19,083 --> 01:42:20,083
He cut my call

1331
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:21,500
Raghav, saw this news?

1332
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:24,125
An IPS officer was caught
copying in an exam

1333
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:26,000
He's already neck deep in problems

1334
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:27,333
This is irrelevant

1335
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:30,125
Listen how he pulled it off technically

1336
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:32,583
- Okay, what?
- Safiq Kareem in Kerala

1337
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:36,375
In an IAS exam, he cleverly fixed
a bluetooth camera in his shirt button

1338
01:42:36,417 --> 01:42:38,583
He captured the question paper 'live'

1339
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:39,833
Sent it to his wife

1340
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:44,333
His wife gave him the answers through
a bluetooth using a micro headphone

1341
01:42:44,542 --> 01:42:45,625
So what now?

1342
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:48,917
You can fix a microcamera
to your shirt button in the same way

1343
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,333
If we connect our mobiles
through bluetooth...

1344
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:55,750
...we can see every frame
your camera captures

1345
01:42:56,208 --> 01:43:00,125
The world which is a blur
beyond 2 feet to you...

1346
01:43:01,083 --> 01:43:02,833
...we can see clearly

1347
01:43:33,542 --> 01:43:35,083
The gate is right in front of you

1348
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:58,542
Don't tell anyone
about this camera plan

1349
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:04,333
Vinayak

1350
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,708
Raghav, did you call?

1351
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:08,750
Yes, sir

1352
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:11,833
I was busy in an office meeting

1353
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:13,208
It's okay, sir

1354
01:44:14,292 --> 01:44:16,875
I want to meet you
if you can spare 5 minutes

1355
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,667
Can you come over to my place?

1356
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:27,917
There's a mastermind
behind all this, sir

1357
01:44:28,458 --> 01:44:29,708
Their target...

1358
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:31,167
...is you

1359
01:44:31,375 --> 01:44:34,125
In the recent case
of Bairavi's murder...

1360
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,583
...the driver is under police custody

1361
01:44:36,667 --> 01:44:40,250
But my father has firmly said
the driver did not kill her

1362
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:44,375
Confessing to a murder
he did not commit...

1363
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:47,458
...he has turned approver
and is behind bars now

1364
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:50,250
If we bring him out somehow
and inquire...

1365
01:44:50,625 --> 01:44:53,208
...we'll know for sure
the mastermind behind this

1366
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:54,375
No chance at all

1367
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:57,333
He has rape and murder cases
under 7 sections

1368
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:59,250
Impossible to take him out on bail

1369
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:01,042
Before this Bairavi incident...

1370
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:04,750
...accident, robbery and murder
are 3 cases that are on record

1371
01:45:04,958 --> 01:45:07,583
Only the driver who robbed
is still at large

1372
01:45:07,625 --> 01:45:10,667
Bail has been granted for the drivers
involved in the 2 cases

1373
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:13,875
Even the drunken driver
is out on bail

1374
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:15,833
I fired him

1375
01:45:17,208 --> 01:45:19,750
Sir, can we get his address?

1376
01:45:19,875 --> 01:45:22,292
Sir, do you know this address?

1377
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:26,333
Take the 1st right
and then 3rd left

1378
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:31,958
There isn't anyone
called Kumaresan here

1379
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:34,042
I'm living here for 27 years

1380
01:45:34,083 --> 01:45:36,208
I don't know anyone by that name

1381
01:45:38,542 --> 01:45:41,208
Bro, we are final year students
of SRM college

1382
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:43,208
We've never seen this man

1383
01:45:43,208 --> 01:45:46,458
- We've been living here for 3 years
- He has given a fake ID

1384
01:45:46,833 --> 01:45:48,833
Wait till I catch him!

1385
01:45:58,708 --> 01:46:00,208
I feel my head will explode

1386
01:46:01,375 --> 01:46:04,000
I have a court hearing
in Madurai tomorrow

1387
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:07,250
I wonder what the judgment will be

1388
01:46:07,292 --> 01:46:09,208
All doors seem to shut in our face

1389
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,042
Don't know who is next

1390
01:46:14,042 --> 01:46:17,208
What if we get caught
instead of someone else?

1391
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:20,000
- Don't get you
- What I was thinking

1392
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:24,083
How many girls work with you?

1393
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:26,750
50 including me

1394
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,375
Can I meet them?

1395
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:30,292
Why?

1396
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:38,083
A girl can't travel at night
in a Go Cab in the city

1397
01:46:38,167 --> 01:46:41,333
But only a bold girl willing to
will be of immense help to us

1398
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:45,458
Only then we can find the motive
and solution for this issue

1399
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:47,208
That's why we need your help

1400
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:59,500
Your courage for a few minutes

1401
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:00,833
...will be our strength

1402
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,833
Are you ready to take the risk?

1403
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:09,083
- Madam, did you book a cab?
- Yes

1404
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:55,708
What happened?

1405
01:48:13,917 --> 01:48:15,083
Dude

1406
01:48:15,583 --> 01:48:16,708
That's Madhu

1407
01:49:12,042 --> 01:49:13,833
Whom are you working for?

1408
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:15,875
Why are you doing this?

1409
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:18,208
Who is the mastermind?

1410
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:19,625
Pu...Pugazhendhi

1411
01:49:19,667 --> 01:49:21,125
Ga...Garuda Call Taxi

1412
01:49:21,208 --> 01:49:22,250
Garuda Call Taxi

1413
01:49:22,292 --> 01:49:24,458
We are following
Pugazhendhi's orders

1414
01:49:38,542 --> 01:49:40,542
Hey, what are you doing here?

1415
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:41,708
What happened?

1416
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,042
It's all over, bro

1417
01:49:44,167 --> 01:49:45,542
What does that mean?

1418
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:02,417
Be ready, he is
heading towards you

1419
01:50:02,458 --> 01:50:04,208
He's 6 feet away from you

1420
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:06,875
3 feet

1421
01:50:09,208 --> 01:50:10,292
Finish him!

1422
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:26,083
He's coming towards you

1423
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:42,042
Grab him

1424
01:50:42,125 --> 01:50:43,583
Come on, get up

1425
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,458
Hey! Help

1426
01:51:01,583 --> 01:51:04,750
- Guna, where is he?
- What happened?

1427
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:07,875
Sir, please stop

1428
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:13,042
When I was repairing dad's car

1429
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:17,542
...I found this phone in the place
he keeps your mom's stuff stowed away

1430
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:21,250
I checked, this phone belongs to Bairavi

1431
01:51:21,417 --> 01:51:24,208
Her conversation with dad
has also been recorded

1432
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:26,917
Listen to this

1433
01:51:29,542 --> 01:51:31,125
'Hello, have you gone to bed?'

1434
01:51:31,167 --> 01:51:32,750
'So early, huh?'

1435
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,417
Where are you?

1436
01:51:34,417 --> 01:51:37,417
- I can't believe what happened today
- What?

1437
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:40,958
Didn't we think Go Cab drivers are
committing those crimes in Chennai?

1438
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,042
Yes

1439
01:51:43,042 --> 01:51:44,125
That isn't true

1440
01:51:44,167 --> 01:51:48,042
The main culprit is Pugazhendhi
Assistant to my boss, Azhagar

1441
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:49,875
When I was checking the accounts-

1442
01:51:49,958 --> 01:51:53,667
3-4 lakhs has been transferred
from Pugazhendhi's account

1443
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:57,833
I checked with the PAN card details
All are connected with the Go Cab crimes

1444
01:51:58,708 --> 01:52:01,333
I don't get you
Why...how can it be?

1445
01:52:01,375 --> 01:52:03,542
'Even I don't understand, Mr Chandramouli'

1446
01:52:03,542 --> 01:52:07,208
I was so confused and that's why
I asked our senior accountant-

1447
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:17,458
'Hey! Who are you?'

1448
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:29,667
Anyone can transfer money to any account
What business is it of yours?

1449
01:52:33,417 --> 01:52:34,708
Pugazhendhi speaking

1450
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:36,958
Problem solved

1451
01:52:37,042 --> 01:52:38,708
I'll close Bairavi's chapter

1452
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:40,208
Hey! Who are you?

1453
01:52:40,208 --> 01:52:41,833
'Why waste this murder?'

1454
01:52:42,375 --> 01:52:45,375
'Make this crime appear
as if it was committed by Go Cab'

1455
01:53:13,042 --> 01:53:14,958
Stop there...right there

1456
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:18,042
Move aside
Kindly cooperate

1457
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:20,208
Move!

1458
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:35,250
'When I talk over the phone
it gets recorded at once'

1459
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:53,083
Don't know why

1460
01:53:53,083 --> 01:53:56,917
'Garuda Call Taxi CEO, Azhagar's
assistant Pugazhendhi's statement'

1461
01:53:56,917 --> 01:53:59,625
' ...is now viral in social media'

1462
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:01,750
'My name is Pugazhendhi'

1463
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:04,750
CEO of Garuda Call Taxi
Mr Azhagar's assistant

1464
01:54:05,708 --> 01:54:07,208
Azhagar is my distant relative...

1465
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:11,833
Obeying his orders, I carried out
all the crime in Go Cab taxis

1466
01:54:12,167 --> 01:54:15,333
He didn't like Vinayak Kanakasabai
being his business rival

1467
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:18,417
He wanted to tarnish
the reputation of Go Cab

1468
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:21,958
We hired drivers to commit the crimes
and duly compensated them

1469
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,583
'Azhagar has succeeded now
Go Cab is about to be shut down'

1470
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:29,125
Conniving chaps! They are the culprits
Conveniently shifted the blame

1471
01:54:29,167 --> 01:54:30,667
They should be crucified

1472
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,750
'In case anything happens to me
Azhagar is responsible'

1473
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:37,750
'According to latest information
Azhagar has allegedly killed Pugazhendhi'

1474
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:40,958
'He has been found dead near
the playground in Teynampet'

1475
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,583
'Body has been sent for post mortem'

1476
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:44,625
'Inspector Ravindran is investigating'

1477
01:54:44,667 --> 01:54:48,500
'When Pugazhendi was murdered
Azhagar was attending a function in Delhi'

1478
01:54:48,542 --> 01:54:51,417
'We are ready to face
any repercussions regarding this'

1479
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:54,083
- Hey, stop
- Get down

1480
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:56,500
Hey, smash the vehicle

1481
01:54:56,542 --> 01:54:58,542
Aim at the windshield
and the lights

1482
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:01,083
Get lost!

1483
01:55:13,333 --> 01:55:16,750
With the intention to
seek revenge on me...

1484
01:55:16,792 --> 01:55:19,250
Azhagar sought his revenge on the people

1485
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:22,167
Now it's the people's turn

1486
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:26,167
Scared the truth will leak out...

1487
01:55:28,667 --> 01:55:30,125
...your father was-

1488
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,542
I don't know how he had
the heart to kill your father

1489
01:55:37,208 --> 01:55:39,708
That's exactly what I wanted to ask you

1490
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:44,500
How did you have
the heart to kill my dad?!

1491
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:51,417
You killed him, sir

1492
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:58,958
In the car he loved so much
you killed-

1493
01:56:02,083 --> 01:56:04,250
What are you saying, Raghav?
How can you doubt-

1494
01:56:04,292 --> 01:56:06,292
Shall I tell you how Bairavi died?

1495
01:56:18,167 --> 01:56:20,750
'- Hello, have you gone to bed?
- So early, huh?'

1496
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:24,000
'- I can't believe what happened today
- What?'

1497
01:56:24,042 --> 01:56:27,583
'Didn't we think Go Cab drivers are
committing those crimes in Chennai?'

1498
01:56:27,625 --> 01:56:28,667
'Yes'

1499
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:30,583
'That isn't true'

1500
01:56:30,625 --> 01:56:34,542
'The main culprit is Pugazhendhi
Assistant to my boss, Azhagar'

1501
01:56:38,417 --> 01:56:41,833
'Anyone can transfer money to any account
What business is it of yours?'

1502
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:43,250
'Pugazhendhi speaking'

1503
01:56:43,833 --> 01:56:44,917
'Problem solved'

1504
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:47,208
'I'll close Bairavi's chapter'

1505
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:01,125
Was my story, right?

1506
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,000
You are right

1507
01:57:06,375 --> 01:57:09,167
But I have a doubt

1508
01:57:09,833 --> 01:57:14,333
If Pugazhendhi is the culprit
you should be suspecting Azhagar

1509
01:57:14,542 --> 01:57:15,667
Why did you think it's me?

1510
01:57:15,708 --> 01:57:18,292
When I was chasing that lorry driver
into your go-down...

1511
01:57:18,292 --> 01:57:20,083
...I found him hanging upside down

1512
01:57:20,083 --> 01:57:21,958
My vision is restricted to 2 feet

1513
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,292
But when there was a 4 feet distance
the mirror in my hand reflected the truth

1514
01:57:26,583 --> 01:57:29,750
Knowing very well you had a hand
in my dad's murder I came to see you

1515
01:57:29,792 --> 01:57:32,292
'I want to meet you
if you can spare 5 minutes, sir'

1516
01:57:32,292 --> 01:57:34,750
'There's a mastermind
behind all this, sir'

1517
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:38,375
You got down from the car to
enquire about the driver's address

1518
01:57:38,417 --> 01:57:41,292
I fixed a camera in your car
without your knowledge

1519
01:57:58,417 --> 01:58:02,333
After that every word you spoke
in the car has been recorded

1520
01:58:02,583 --> 01:58:05,000
'I have a court hearing
in Madurai tomorrow'

1521
01:58:05,292 --> 01:58:07,917
'We have just 24 hours'

1522
01:58:08,417 --> 01:58:11,167
'Do something drastic tonight
and then call me'

1523
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:12,500
'Wonder who is next!'

1524
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:15,125
'As per your plan, nothing drastic
happened that night'

1525
01:58:15,167 --> 01:58:18,833
'We averted it, we caught
the driver and Pugazhendhi'

1526
01:58:18,833 --> 01:58:22,583
'He escaped from us
and got into your car!'

1527
01:58:22,625 --> 01:58:23,792
Go, sir

1528
01:58:37,167 --> 01:58:40,417
'That mongrel conned us by lying
he can see only at 2 feet distance'

1529
01:58:40,417 --> 01:58:43,583
'He can see only for 2 feet is a fact'

1530
01:58:44,167 --> 01:58:47,000
'But he somehow finds a way'

1531
01:58:48,583 --> 01:58:52,917
'I have all the account details of drivers
who shifted from Garuda to Go Cabs, sir'

1532
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:55,250
'Like you suggested
to do something drastic'

1533
01:58:55,292 --> 01:58:58,667
'Make the driver surrender
to the police, blame it on Azhagar'

1534
01:58:58,708 --> 01:59:01,458
'Make him turn approver and
close Azhagar's chapter, sir'

1535
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,333
'But things took an ugly turn, sir'

1536
01:59:04,292 --> 01:59:07,417
'I have a better option, Pugazhendhi'

1537
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:09,708
My name is Pugazhendhi

1538
01:59:10,167 --> 01:59:13,167
I am the assistant of the CEO
Azhagar of Garuda Cabs

1539
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:19,000
'You made Pugazhendhi record a video
to finish the story you had started'

1540
01:59:19,042 --> 01:59:21,542
'You made him upload it
in Facebook also'

1541
01:59:21,583 --> 01:59:22,667
I've posted it, sir

1542
01:59:22,708 --> 01:59:24,333
Everything will go smooth now, sir?

1543
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:27,333
'You know very well
what followed after that'

1544
01:59:43,208 --> 01:59:44,750
Poor Azhagar!

1545
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:48,333
He bears the blame and burden
of this murder too

1546
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:52,708
In the corporate world

1547
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:56,042
...the big fishes gobble
the small ones with ease

1548
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:58,583
This is justice here

1549
02:00:08,917 --> 02:00:11,083
What is your next move, Raghav?

1550
02:00:11,125 --> 02:00:12,833
I don't remember my mom

1551
02:00:14,542 --> 02:00:17,417
But I learnt about her from my dad

1552
02:00:18,917 --> 02:00:21,500
Now I am suffering without him

1553
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:28,833
How immature to keep
yearning for your father

1554
02:00:29,625 --> 02:00:31,208
How kiddish!

1555
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:41,000
I killed your father

1556
02:00:41,792 --> 02:00:43,167
What will you do?

1557
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:59,208
Get up, please

1558
02:01:30,625 --> 02:01:32,208
Spy cam!

1559
02:01:49,375 --> 02:01:51,375
Your girlfriend, huh?

1560
02:01:51,708 --> 02:01:53,083
Her idea, huh?

1561
02:01:53,458 --> 02:01:54,708
Must be her

1562
02:02:16,958 --> 02:02:19,250
Your vision extends only for 2 feet, right?

1563
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:56,333
You've collected
a whole lot of information

1564
02:02:56,417 --> 02:02:58,250
But do you know
why your father died?

1565
02:02:58,292 --> 02:03:02,833
'We wish you'll be presented
this award every year and always'

1566
02:03:02,917 --> 02:03:04,458
'Congratulations'

1567
02:03:07,792 --> 02:03:11,167
You told him you want to
receive this award from him

1568
02:03:11,208 --> 02:03:13,167
He is completely pissed off

1569
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,375
He must have planned to plant 10 drivers
in my company to tarnish my name

1570
02:03:20,417 --> 02:03:22,208
And force me to
shut my firm down?

1571
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:24,167
He isn't that bad, sir

1572
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,833
He won't stoop so low

1573
02:03:26,125 --> 02:03:28,375
Then we shall do it instead!

1574
02:03:34,208 --> 02:03:36,917
There should be an onslaught
of crimes in my company

1575
02:03:36,917 --> 02:03:39,958
The blame should fall
on Azhagar's shoulders

1576
02:03:41,042 --> 02:03:44,792
In short, Azhagar's company
should shut down one day

1577
02:03:44,833 --> 02:03:47,000
It shouldn't have adverse effect, sir

1578
02:03:49,833 --> 02:03:51,333
This is a corporate world

1579
02:03:51,667 --> 02:03:54,375
Only if one man is destroyed
another can live peacefully

1580
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:56,667
Survival of the fittest

1581
02:03:58,375 --> 02:04:02,500
You have a bright future waiting for you
beyond your wildest dreams

1582
02:04:03,333 --> 02:04:04,958
Think about it
and let me know

1583
02:04:09,833 --> 02:04:13,667
'With the support of a few police officers
everything will fall in place perfectly'

1584
02:04:13,708 --> 02:04:16,125
'Your father tried to ruin
this fool-proof plan'

1585
02:04:16,125 --> 02:04:17,667
Bairavi was not killed

1586
02:04:18,542 --> 02:04:20,750
...by a Go Cab driver

1587
02:04:22,583 --> 02:04:23,625
Pugazhendhi

1588
02:04:23,625 --> 02:04:25,292
Uncle, you spoke to him?

1589
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:43,708
This is a corporate world
If you trespass this is the result

1590
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:46,167
Your father got the brunt of it
Now it is your turn

1591
02:05:09,833 --> 02:05:11,250
Sir, what happened?

1592
02:05:12,958 --> 02:05:15,583
You wanted to take
4 days off, get going

1593
02:05:15,625 --> 02:05:17,125
No, sir, I can hear-

1594
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:19,250
Gratitude, huh?

1595
02:05:19,583 --> 02:05:23,292
What goes around in this world
will come back to us

1596
02:05:23,333 --> 02:05:24,375
Go

1597
02:06:43,167 --> 02:06:46,125
'Make him turn approver and
close Azhagar's chapter, sir'

1598
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:47,583
'But things took an ugly turn, sir'

1599
02:06:47,625 --> 02:06:50,500
'I have a better option, Pugazhendhi'

1600
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,625
Arrest Vinayak at once

1601
02:06:53,667 --> 02:06:57,333
'The Go Cab crimes so far were instigated'

1602
02:06:57,375 --> 02:07:00,542
'...by the CEO of the firm
Vinayak Kanakasabai'

1603
02:07:00,583 --> 02:07:04,958
'This has been proved with adequate
evidence by the Police Task force'

1604
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,750
I didn't expect Vinayak would
resent my growth and stoop so low

1605
02:07:09,792 --> 02:07:14,125
'He has resorted to this in order to
shut down Garuda Call taxi agency'

1606
02:07:14,167 --> 02:07:19,958
'The police force also announced
Vinayak is now a fugitive from justice'

1607
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,667
'And the Police Task force is leaving
no stones unturned to hunt him down'

1608
02:07:26,083 --> 02:07:27,792
What did you do to Vinayak?

1609
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:02,958
'Few weeks later'

1610
02:08:28,833 --> 02:08:30,750
I'm unable to start the car

1611
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:31,792
So...?

1612
02:08:31,833 --> 02:08:36,167
If you can slightly, lightly
push with a lot of love

1613
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:39,583
...it will rev back to life

1614
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:43,458
And may I know where sir is off to?

1615
02:08:51,375 --> 02:08:56,292
'Do you know how glad I am
to see you smiling like this?'

1616
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,083
'Very often life is like this'

1617
02:09:02,542 --> 02:09:07,375
'It will carry us high into the sky
like the bird in a fairy tale'

1618
02:09:07,583 --> 02:09:10,125
'We will be in the peak of happiness'

1619
02:09:10,167 --> 02:09:12,458
'It will push us down
all of a sudden'

1620
02:09:13,333 --> 02:09:14,833
'It will hurt like hell'

1621
02:09:15,667 --> 02:09:18,583
'We'll almost give up hope
to get back on our feet again'

1622
02:09:19,167 --> 02:09:20,958
'But the one who picks himself up'

1623
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,458
'...is the winner'

1624
02:09:22,708 --> 02:09:24,917
'You are a winner'

1625
02:09:26,042 --> 02:09:28,583
'I know you'll be on your feet again'

1626
02:09:30,125 --> 02:09:34,833
'Till now I was walking
holding on to your hand'

1627
02:09:36,917 --> 02:09:39,833
'Don't think 4 footsteps
have reduced to 2 now'

1628
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,417
'Think I am still walking
hoisting you on my shoulder'

1629
02:09:49,458 --> 02:09:52,083
'I haven't gone away from you, Raghav'

1630
02:09:52,333 --> 02:09:55,000
'I will always be with you'

1631
02:10:09,333 --> 02:10:15,917
"Seconds that melt away regardless
Wave your wand to make time endless"

1632
02:10:15,958 --> 02:10:22,750
"A bond mystifying and bewildering
Bridge the gap for it to extend endearing"

1633
02:10:22,833 --> 02:10:29,542
"When hair turns silver gray
memories swirl and stay"

1634
02:10:29,583 --> 02:10:35,833
"Dreams dissolve into oblivion
Ties of reality as benediction"

1635
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,292
"How do I name this bond unusual
that’s spellbinding and soulful?"
