1
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:00,205
Manu, do you know what's this?

2
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:04,036
You don't know? Sure?

3
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,273
Pigeon! Come on, say, Manu!

4
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:18,675
P-I-G-E-O-N

5
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,973
<i>Mex!</i>

6
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,505
Gosh!

7
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:06,078
Ugh! Mixie?! No problem!

8
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,205
Sleep under the blanket.

9
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:23,779
Our son didn't get through.
Doesn’t matter

10
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,108
But my tension was about Janet's son!

11
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,003
Luckily, he too didn't get through!

12
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,547
Mom! Siddhu got the admission.
I'm in the School now.

13
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,669
His name is there in the 1st list itself!

14
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,113
From yesterday I was in tension
if he would get through or not...

15
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,243
Only now I am feeling relieved!

16
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,445
Anyway, please inform this immediately.

17
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,409
Tuttu..Chinnu...Come and eat food.

18
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:55,537
Angry, ah?

19
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,637
Eat fully only then you will
grow tall and strong.

20
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,069
Aren't you a good kid? Eat this

21
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,408
Oh my Tuttu! it's raining.

22
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,476
Get back to your nest soon.

23
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:14,082
If you get fever, then, I'll get an injection
from dads shop and pierce it!

24
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,969
Won't it pain for you then?

25
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:20,080
Both of you get back to the
nest like good children.

26
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,440
Chinnu! You don't seem to
listen to whatever I say.

27
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,309
Dad...Why don't we go and see the rainbow?

28
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,414
Oh my God! Only if there is rain,
there will be rainbow.

29
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,544
- Really? -Yes

30
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,509
Rainbow, Damn it! Play happily with dad!
Don't study.

31
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,409
How many times did I
teach you the English name for PRAVU!!

32
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:43,634
Tell me!

33
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,244
Are you crazy'?

34
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,036
What is there in an English name!

35
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,641
Oh!! Here comes the defender!

36
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:49,545
Ouch!! Turning towards me now!

37
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,405
You're a great English Professor, aren't you?

38
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,706
Come on say, Wham do
you call PRAVU in English?

39
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,778
My dear girl! PRAVU is the name of a bird.

40
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,405
Whats your name? - Priya!

41
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,602
What is the English name of PRIYA?
-It's PRIYA! Same!

42
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,770
This time he didn't get because he failed
to recognize PRAVU(Pigeon)'s Picture!

43
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,139
Last time, his name
didn't appear on the lot also.

44
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,581
- There are only two chances left now. - Yes

45
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:19,276
Should I alone take so much pains
to put him in a good school?

46
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,672
Do you ever care about it?

47
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,304
To put him in a good school is my desire too!

48
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:29,607
Hiding my desires has always been my
weakness for long!

49
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,009
Sorry!

50
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,405
Mom, I know what is PRAVU in English called?

51
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,275
P-I-G-E-O-N!

52
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,003
Isn't it correct, mom! Don't cry.

53
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,342
Why didn't you tell this then?

54
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,480
I'd forgotten, mom! Hereafter I will not forget.

55
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,137
Sorry, son!

56
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:02,705
See! He's dads son!

57
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:07,980
Pigeon is the name of harmless bird!

58
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,411
That's the reason these don't stand on the ground

59
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,568
ls there a medicine for cough?

60
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,043
No...But I've got a medicine for relieving cough!

61
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,241
You don't have to. I trust you.
I'll get you right away.

62
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:32,073
Dissolve this medicine in water
and inhale steam twice daily.

63
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,779
And this to be taken,
morning and night after food.

64
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,304
- How much is the cost?
- Rs.51. Just pay me Rs. 50

65
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,305
- Here - Take it.

66
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,108
Good morning, boss

67
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:52,671
it's not a pretty good morning for me!

68
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,211
Why did you take leave without
informing me, yesterday?

69
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,537
I'd sent you a message.

70
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:57,768
Are you asking for leave over the phone?

71
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,135
No, I didn't have the guts
to ask you face to face!

72
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,280
Actually I was forced to take leave
on an important circumstance!

73
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,640
- On what circumstance?
- My mom's birthday.

74
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,605
My dad has also taken leave

75
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,441
lf l don't take leave,
I would've been left out at home!

76
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,476
Doesn't matter as long as I don't understand!

77
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,437
Are you ready to work now?

78
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,574
Yeah! I got my lunch also.

79
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,371
- Can you look after the shop for some time?
- Of course.

80
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,638
- I need to go to town for collecting stock!
- Carry on.

81
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,572
He imposed his burden upon me today!

82
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,644
- Hope there was good business
for the last two days! - Why?

83
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,637
Untimely rainfall, extreme heat, strong winds...!

84
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,170
It's the right time for diseases to spread

85
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,175
On my way here, boss,

86
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,174
When I saw the heap of
rubbish on the bus stand,

87
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,003
- My eyes got welled up. - What for?

88
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,040
These are all set and ready
to spread communicable diseases

89
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,304
Stop talking cruelly and
set those things on the rack.

90
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,336
- Calling this cruelty!-Here is your food!

91
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,745
Yesterdays Biriyani! I got for you also.

92
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,044
Only my dog will eat it.

93
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,302
It smells I suppose!

94
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,610
First, let me call my Laila and
then begin my work

95
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:57,445
Hello..Something from my tummy rolled
and moved up to my chest!

96
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:58,609
Ask it to wait for sometime

97
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,341
There is a green tablet
for fast recovery here

98
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,603
If so, then why don't you come inside
and take it?

99
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,711
You please get it for me quickly.

100
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,307
Then, wait patiently until I get it for you.

101
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,546
It's the tablet for Gas!! He's teaching me!!

102
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,708
Well, from which area
they usually take it from?

103
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,708
- That one... - This?

104
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:15,711
Is this Green?

105
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:17,345
- This one? - Yes

106
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:20,473
- What's your name?-Sukoore!

107
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,209
Oh!! Then, green one will be
enough to recover quickly.

108
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,440
Look, it's getting cured
on just seeing the tablet!

109
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,269
The medicines here work in good speed!

110
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,076
Where do I've to pay the cash?

111
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,404
Over there! Rs.12.

112
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,406
- Uncle! - Not uncle, I'm Aravind.

113
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,770
Good that he didn't call you dad!

114
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:39,444
Tell me, dear! Amidst than, a moron popped
in for medicine.

115
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,509
Reached office? Yes I also reached.

116
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,441
I told a pack of lies as usual.

117
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,078
This same tonic is available
in two different company.

118
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,142
I shall whatsapp you both the photos.

119
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,107
Then, decide and let me know.

120
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,008
Oh no!! I don't need any money.

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,674
Here, medicines are free for me!

122
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:59,344
Even if I sell this shop,
my boss will not get angry.

123
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:00,671
- So much freedom - What?

124
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,304
- Put the phone down-Okay!

125
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,173
Consume balm twice a day...
Sorry...apply the balm

126
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,011
Manu didn't get, did he?

127
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,078
I also checked. Alice also didn't get.

128
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,302
They are really cheats!

129
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,645
Hell with their lot!

130
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,476
If you pay a huge money as a donation,
automatically name will appear on the lot.

131
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,476
Or one should belong to their diocese!

132
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:25,978
Take me for instance! I'm also a Christian.

133
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,640
But they are not ready to
accept people from other diocese!

134
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,471
What Chackoachhan says is right!

135
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:37,138
Wherever you go, they' re asking for parent's
salary certificate and education

136
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,407
Those are only for eyewash!

137
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,648
How did Lisie's son get admission in St.Johns?

138
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,078
Her husband didn't even pass schooling.

139
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,339
Her dad requested the Minister to recommend.

140
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,238
Why else didn't my daughter Alice get selected?

141
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,003
You also know she is smart!

142
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,370
Even Manu is not less

143
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:58,034
All are big thieves!!

144
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,509
It is better not get admitted in such schools

145
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,439
- Good morning-Good morning, Lisie! Sit down

146
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,612
Who named your wife as PRIYA?

147
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:15,981
I'm going to collect stock!
Try to mess up as much as possible.

148
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,439
- Have you kept the money?-Yes inside

149
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,178
Go carefully, heavy trucks are plying frequently!

150
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:21,606
Shut up!

151
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,108
Oh! Menon sir!

152
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:26,271
Did you go and check the
blazer school results yesterday?

153
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,341
He didn't get through, sir!

154
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,236
What happened?

155
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,045
This time a bird let him down - Pigeon!

156
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,041
Crow, right?

157
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,772
Not Crow, bullshit!

158
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,580
Keep two things in mind to get
an admission in the school.

159
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,573
Like all place; you'll need a political recommendation

160
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,210
From a Minister, MLA, Counsellor...
any such dignified persons

161
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,004
Not a Minister, but I know a Muslim crier!
Will that be enough?

162
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:49,746
I don't have any acquaintance with such people

163
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,972
Do you know any Fathers?

164
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:57,081
- Fathers?!
- I mean, Bishop, Priest, Vicar or a Rector

165
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,143
A"? Such people?

166
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,643
The only Priest I knew was,
who regularly comes here for Asthma medicines!

167
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,205
But he hasn't been coming here for a month!

168
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,673
That medicine would've worked!

169
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,273
I heard the passing bells
ringing at the Church the other day.

170
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,510
If I give you a kick..

171
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,108
Look at his prank!

172
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,575
- I'm on the way to the town now. - Okay.

173
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:16,071
Then, think upon whatever I said and decide

174
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,778
Give medicines to Menon sir.

175
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,541
Actually, you need the Asthma tablet, right?

176
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,076
<i>I'll</i> give you a blow.

177
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,213
I need tablets for Dysentery!

178
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:24,537
We give the same medicine for both.

179
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:25,211
Get lost

180
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:31,037
The teacher who taught
spoken English tuition for Allen,

181
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,439
- George sir? - Yes

182
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,043
He's in Kozhikode now. Why?

183
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,672
I'm planning to send Manu for tuition

184
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,102
Is that so?

185
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,547
I know a couple of persons

186
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:42,541
<i>I'll</i> give you their numbers.

187
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,144
Manu didn't get admission, right?

188
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:47,545
It's not that!

189
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,646
The play school, he's going now is good
and it is close by too!

190
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,344
He can continue there next year also!

191
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,973
What is the tuition for?

192
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,407
Aravindettan insists on that!

193
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,669
Why didn't you call me yesterday?

194
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,270
No, mom..l..

195
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,735
What happened to his results?

196
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,407
I have to find some other school.

197
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,508
So, he didn't get there also.

198
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,179
Doesn't matter.

199
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,011
Ask them to come here with Manu.

200
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,508
It's been a long time since we saw them.

201
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,513
You come home with Manu.
Your father wants to see him

202
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,068
it's easy for you to say.

203
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,376
I run helter-skelter for
each and every thing

204
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,112
None of you seem worried about it.

205
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,240
And dad wants to keep playing with him.

206
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,474
You carry on with your work.

207
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,671
You will have two days holidays
after tomorrow, isn't it?

208
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,306
That's why I called you.

209
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,772
I'll try, dad!!

210
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,305
I need to arrange tuition for Manu.

211
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,013
We are able to see you
only when you bring Manu here.

212
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,306
<i>I'll</i> let you know when I could come

213
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:52,479
it's because I am stuck
in between admission and office work...

214
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,110
Yes, that's enough.

215
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,309
Okay, dad! <i>I'll</i> reach home and call you.

216
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,379
- You lost! - I've no mood!

217
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,480
What's wrong even if Priya wished so?

218
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,002
Even if you struggle now,

219
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,976
Manu will reach somewhere in future.

220
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,343
Education is very important in today's world.

221
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,611
Anyway, you are ready to give donation.

222
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,447
If so, I know a person...
Sibi who works in the Secretariat!

223
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,112
Wham if we approach him?

224
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,280
Sibi! No way!!
We'll look out for some other way.

225
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,204
What about Attenders and Peons?

226
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,445
I know some of them.

227
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,772
<i>W“ anything happen ii they try'?</i>

228
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:28,611
Why not?

229
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,079
They rule the roost!

230
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:39,082
However, I'm not ready to meet such persons!

231
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,447
I couldn't catch him over the phone.

232
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,078
Don't worry, <i>I'll</i> speak with him

233
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,008
However, I called up yesterday.

234
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,075
I shall call up tomorrow also.

235
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:54,273
Seeing the height of the wall,
exorbitant donation I suppose!

236
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,409
Hey, what do you want?

237
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,137
Admiss...

238
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:10,036
Regarding admission.

239
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:13,077
Admission? Then, why do
you walk stealthily like thieves?

240
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:13,968
Sorry.

241
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,042
The office is in the right hand side

242
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,007
Where can I meet the attenders?

243
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,143
Attenders? What for?

244
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,544
Just to convey my regards!

245
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,406
- Enquire in the office-Over there?

246
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,777
Oh God, where is it

247
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,079
Hello! Come here

248
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,710
Good morning, sir.

249
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,543
4mm do you want?
- I came to visit the school

250
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,613
Do you think this a museum for visiting?

251
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,511
To know whether ifs good

252
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:12,773
About what?

253
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,578

254
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:16,604

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,170
- Ashwin? - Ashwin's father".

256
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,103
- Father? Aravindanl!-Father Aravind?

00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:20,972
Priya Medicals.

258
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,340
Medicals?! Do you think ifs a hospital?

259
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:25,704
To know if it is good...Gosh!

260
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:28,340
What you doing?

261
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,579
So, you are the attender here?

262
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,644
If so?

263
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,774
Good! I was actually looking for...

264
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:42,778
Without knowing whom to ask...

265
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:43,543
Ask what?

266
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,542
- I came to meet you, sir. -Wham for?

267
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,507
- For a reason! - What reason?

268
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,074
How can I ask this openly...

269
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,045
Shall we get into that toilet?

270
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,145
- For a thing.-What thing?

271
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,080
I mean, please accept the donation and
make my son's admission done.

272
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,437
Wham nonsense are you saying?

273
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,442
If you have any problem here,
give me your address <i>I'll</i> send the money home.

274
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,543
Security!

275
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,778
Is it enough if I give it to him?

276
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,980
Will you get out or
do I've to call the police?

277
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,045
I will give bribe if you don't need the donation.

278
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,079
Security, come here. Throw this fellow out.

279
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,476
Get out.

280
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,578
Why are you roaming around here?

281
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:25,307
Get out, please

282
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,006
Don't you understand?
Are you creating ruckus at school?

283
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,279
- Can you do it, sir?
- Shut up and Get away.

284
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,478
My bike is over there.

285
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,580
There's a Kumar tailor unit in Pulimoodu junction

286
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,674
Go and meet Tailor Kumar! He will get it done.

287
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,035
Regarding the admission, right?

288
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:41,645
Whose name should I refer?

289
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,105
Just say Peter from Holy Saint sent you!
Okay...go...

290
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,108
Thank you, Peteretta!

291
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,170
Okay, Kumar Tailors!

292
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,313
- Hello -I'm Priya speaking!
Move aside, Manu!

293
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,674
Lisie from Global Immigration
told me to contact you.

294
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:11,180
I need English tuition for my son.

295
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,341
Yeah, yeah, she told me.
But time is my only problem

296
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,406
I have actually fully packed schedules.

297
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:20,516
No...Whenever you find time...
just for a little time..

298
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:27,543
What about weekly - Tuesdays 5.30 to 7 pm?

299
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:33,046
Oh, 5.30?! it's his playing time!

300
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:35,338
Playing at this age?

301
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,404
I'm not free at any other time.

302
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,407
It's not a problem! 5.30 is okay.

303
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,013
Don't mistake me as I am asking over phone!

304
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,511
How much is the fee?

305
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,510
Monthly 1500!

306
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,735
What all will you teach?

307
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:54,310
Normally parents ask me
to talk to their children...

308
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,510
about their daily activities!

309
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,037
After that, numbers, these things I will teach

310
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,201
Can you begin this Tuesday?

311
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,672
Yeah, Yeah, of course madam!

312
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:04,773
Please Whatsapp me your address!

313
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,636
<i>I'll</i> send you a text message

314
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,738
- Okay!-Thank you!

315
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,475
Who denied the seam to Ambani?

316
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,205
<i>Not Ambani'?</i>

317
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,044
Give a break!

318
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:28,080
<i>Oh'. Thamban'. PoornimaThamban'.!</i>

319
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,207
I was wondering why Ambani
came down to such a situation!!

320
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,342
Hello, Kumar sir...

321
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,770
The one who is talking over phone

322
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,043
Which school is your child studying now?

323
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:39,180
Poornima, your child wants admission
where her cousins are studying, right?

324
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:44,177
Let me try. Give me your phone number.

325
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,577
Alright! I will try.

326
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:54,013
It's my word! <i>I'll</i> tell you the current rates!

327
00:21:54,467 --> 00:22:00,782
St. Johns - 6, Vidyashilp - 7,
Holy Saints - 5 and Blossoms - 6

328
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:06,041
If any siblings are studying there...

329
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:07,977
Nothing like that?

330
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,612
Do you have any hold in the Church?

331
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:14,141
Oh! That belongs to another diocese!!
Doesn't matter.

332
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,307
You've money, isn't it? That's enough for me.

333
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,044
What? Single parent? OMG! Nature of death?

334
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,542
Oh! Disowned and walked away!

335
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,545
Then, ifs not a problem.

336
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,512
We shall hire a person.

337
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,510
I shall..

338
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,010
Not me...l shall arrange some other person.

339
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,710
Don't worry...Don't worry.

340
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:38,637
It should only appear like
a happy family!! That's it!

341
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,409
<i>I'll</i> get you the admission and then say.

342
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,741
I just consider this as a service. Okay, then!

343
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,408
Greetings, sir!
- Wham do you want, sir?

344
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,668
Peter sent me.

345
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,704
- Holy Saints! -Oh! 1st std!

346
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,410
I tried in a couple of schools!
Nothing worked out.

347
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,978
Does your child know to write
English Alphabets and numbers 1 - 10?

348
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,373
- Yes, sir! - My son also knows.

349
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,572
The one sitting over there is Ajith sir

350
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:07,044
His son also knows Alphabets
and numbers 1 - 10

351
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,107
Then, how do we differentiate children?

352
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,209
Same brain, Same age and Same IQ All same

353
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:16,106
One more thing! What are their parents doing?

354
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,542
Their financial condition and education!

355
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:19,370
Please sit down.

356
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,277
Sir, the label is on left side, isn't it?

357
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,571
No, put it on the right side from this year.

358
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,080
Otherwise, parents will make their children
wear last year's uniform this year also.

359
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,178
I too need to survive, right?

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,504

As there was plenty of water,

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,671
Good!

374
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,604
If I get the admission,
then <i>I'll</i> have to go to Palani.

375
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,774
Yes...you can go!

377
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,078
Singapore, Bangkok!

378
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,307
What is your business?

379
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,604
I run a medical shop! Priya Medicals.

380
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,146
He runs an AC showroom

381
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,446
Donated 20 ACs to his daughter's school.

382
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,145
Good!

383
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,142
Our John sir...the Umbrella

384
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,640
He donated umbrellas to all
the students from his company

385
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,211
Same way, you also do something

386
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,780
Why don't you give free
vaccination for all students?

387
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,307
Oh!! I run a tiny shop

388
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,070
<i>I'll</i> be forced to wind up if I do so

389
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:48,743
Want to relish the food from a 5 star hotel
but can only pay the amount of the street eatery.

390
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,101
How is it possible?

391
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,335
Actually what I intended was..

392
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,606
I got it. Do one thing
Arrange the cash.

393
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:56,643
<i>I'll</i> take care of the rest.

394
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,441
What is your fees?

395
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:04,173
Forget that! it's all a service.

396
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:08,710
I am only a well wisher
of this admission system

397
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:09,704
Ask him, he will say!

398
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:33,271
What?

399
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,477
So whatever I say is a lie,
isn't it, John?

400
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:03,240
Weren't you online on Whatsapp?

401
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,776
Last seen at 5.15 p.m!

402
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:06,678
Still you never replied to me.

403
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,679
But that Reshma is also
available at the same time

404
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:10,773
I know.

405
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,247
Oh! Coincidence!! Always Coincidence!

406
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,513
You were chatting with her, I know...
You know what.

407
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,278
I just don't want this relationship.

408
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:25,711
You do colouring!

409
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:29,213
You know what? I don't want to talk to you

410
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,676
I just don't want to talk to you,
liar! Filthy liar!

411
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:36,774
Manu, blue! Not brown...blue!

412
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,103
If you are happy and you know it,
clap your hands..

413
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,201
Clap (ﬂap--

414
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,507
Fantastic!

415
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,403
Ifs splendid!

416
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,170
Will be more thrilling if
heard after gulping drinks

417
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,209
Shut up! Talking nonsense before children!

418
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:51,605
Don't listen to whatever he says

419
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:53,439
What else did the teacher teach you?

420
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,645
K-I-T-E

421
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,173
C-A-R-T

422
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,740
- Menon sir, you heard what he said! -Yes!

423
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,379
Very good! What else did
the teacher teach you?

424
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,739
You cheat! You liar!

425
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,172
I don't want to talk to you.
You filthy liar!

426
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,737
Superb! ls your teacher;
relative of Renji Panicker! Very tough words!

427
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,537
Son, repeat than.

428
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:17,178
You cheat! You liar!

429
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:20,348
I don't want to talk to you.
You filthy liar!

430
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,706
Do they teach all such things?

431
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,737
Cheat is not a problem Liar is not bad!

432
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,510
But the last word matters a lot!

433
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,979
- Who taught you all this? - Teena madam

434
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:33,979
You don't learn all this!!

435
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:36,336
Old Pigeon is enough for us!

436
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,977
What can I say? Priya was right!!

437
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,147
Now I regret for not learning English.

438
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,670
I don't understand whether
child talks right or wrong.

439
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,148
Aravindan, School is very important.

440
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,971
There lies Children's future.

441
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:56,975
True!

442
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,368
Who is Renji Panicker?

443
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:05,705
Aunty, you're waiting near
the phone, aren't you?

444
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,772
Srini will be calling me today.

445
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,777
If I don't pick the call in 2 rings,
then he won't call me again

446
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,704
This is for you aunty. Pressure tablets

447
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:18,407
This is for Samy uncle

448
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,669
Bill must have mounted!

449
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,671
Dues are almost pending for 5 months!

450
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:25,770
Come on, aunty!

451
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,541
Srini is quite busy nowadays.

452
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,577
He doesn't find time for an account transfer:

453
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,011
Don't worry about it!

454
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,506
Just take your medicines regularly.

455
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:38,270
Aravindettan particularly told this.

456
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,112
Please be seated. <i>I'll</i> get you a cup of coffee

457
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,344
Not now, Manu is with the tuition teacher:

458
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,771
Let me go.

459
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,410
No...No..No way" Never.

460
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,580
This is it! I'm Single
Let the whole World know.

461
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:53,307
Henceforth, there's nothing between me and you!

462
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,740
My status is changed! Teena is single!

463
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:00,304
Are you troubling me

464
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,238
Where is Manu?

465
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:05,743
Manu ...bathroom...he's in the bathroom!

466
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:07,070
<i>I'll</i> call you later, okay?.

467
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:29,376
Where is Manu?
He's not seen anywhere around.

468
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,774
- Did Manu come here? - No

469
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,337
Oh God, He's not there upstairs,
let me check down

470
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,046
Did Manu come here?

471
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:46,213
Just a minute! I didn't see him!
What happened?

472
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,045
Nothing.

473
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:01,412
- Manu- Mom!

474
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:06,046
I was searching for you everywhere.

475
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:08,042
I told you not to go out alone.

476
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:12,374
I saw a big star going in
full speed from the balcony.

477
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,672
Now I don't find than. Where is that?

478
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,469
Dear, That must be a Comet!

479
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,571
- The star which I saw
also had a tail!-Oh really?

480
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,508
Why these stars don't have a tail?

481
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,679
Stars are very far away from us

482
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:32,243
Tiny bits of some stars will break
and fall onto the earth,

483
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:36,438
and burn! That appears like a tail!

484
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,010
Will that fall onto my head?

485
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,003
Shut up, you silly! <i>it'll</i> not fall!

486
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,745
Manu, Are you here?

487
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,441
You said you'll go to the toilet and come?

488
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,005
I was in such a tension!

489
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:52,007
How many times I asked you
which colour to use?

490
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,576
But you were over the phone for a long time

491
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
Tina, hereafter I shall teach Manu!

492
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,640
To tell the truth, Manu is very much restless

493
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,702
Only I can take good care of him.

494
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,146
Tina, you needn't come from tomorrow.

495
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:19,240
I noticed only when he told his wife
about the admission over phone

496
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,504
Later I prompted him and got the details

497
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,974
- Vidya Guru, isn't it? - Yes!

498
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,441
Application form will be given
from 10 'U' clock only.

499
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,374
But a huge queue has been
there since early morning

500
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,444
One who travelled in my auto was
rushing to join the queue.

501
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,142
Seems first 50 persons who collect the forms
will definitely be called for the interview.

502
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,141
--Will we be lame?+lo, not at all.

503
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,779
I informed Shafiq.
He would've reached by now.

504
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:39,440
Then, ifs okay.

505
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,143
See the huge queue!

506
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:48,537
Where the hell is that ogler standing?

507
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,270
- Is it for your son?-N o, I'm a bachelor.

508
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,778
Then why are you here

509
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,374
Every year, we used to sponsor
for three children

510
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,045
This is for one of the children

511
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:58,368
That moron is trying to woo someone

512
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,211
Enough of your wooing! Go and open the shop.

513
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,211
It's not an issue! I'm ready to stand

514
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,402
Who will open the shop, then? Go quickly.

515
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,579
I'm prepared to wait here
even for 10 days for your sake.

516
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:06,406
Shut up and go!

517
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,772
Is he that eager to stand in a queue?

518
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,243
- Haven't started giving forms, right? - No.

519
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,468
I'm standing in queue since early morning.

520
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,110
Not sure when they will issue!

521
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:19,268
Hold me please!

522
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,070
Whats wrong with him?

523
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,075
Get some water. Somebody help!

524
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:36,347
Call an auto!

525
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,105
Wait, I shall also carry him.

526
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,602
- You stand in the queue! - Doesn't matter.

527
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:52,112
Take him to Medical college
for a good treatment!

528
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,539
Yes..that will be better.

529
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,975
Better sleep!
Or else you will get from me nicely.

530
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:02,468
What son of a dad he is!

531
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,610
Wham else to say other than Fame!

532
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:06,704
Has no time for anything.

533
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,381
But has ample time to
take old people on the roadside to hospital!

534
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,770
- There are also many others
hanging around with him - O Gosh!-

535
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:17,305
Boss, I came to hand over the keys

536
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,236
You keep the keys.
I will be coming late tomorrow.

537
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,505
Should I keep a black ﬂag tomorrow in the shop

538
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,401
Get lost, you rascal!

539
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,209
Can't you respond anything?

540
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,704
Shafiq had come to hand over the keys!

541
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,444
So what? Do I've to stand upside down?

542
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:35,076
Get going!

543
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,213
I shall pray for your long life See you.

544
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,974
She will break everything today

545
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,239
Good Lord, I can't hear my child's voice!

546
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,012
If anybody falls sick at home, you will
give us sample medicine from your own shop

547
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,074
Why don't you get inside and look?

548
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,301
You may find a treasure inside.

549
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,376
Offer it as donation for child's admission.

550
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,576
That's the only way out now.

551
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,410
When did you come?

552
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,204
When talking about finding a treasure,
I walked in

553
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,543
Please sit! <i>I'll</i> get you a cup of tea

554
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,403
What brought you here at this late hour?

555
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,170
I came to inform you
before more damage is done!

556
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,646
A few allegations have been raised against
the School that distributed the form today.

557
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:23,080
There was a big tussle over there this morning.

558
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:27,171
This started when
somebody tried to jump over the queue.

559
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,369
However form distribution has
been postponed to some other date

560
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,147
- Thank God!- Saved!

561
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:32,971
Me too!

562
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,703
Please be seated. Have dinner

563
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,272
No, she is alone at home.

564
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,647
Thought of informing you
as soon as we came to know this

565
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:39,542
See you!

566
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:42,371
<i>I'll</i> send them and be back

567
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:50,139
You go..I'll be back now.

568
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,604
Wham happened, Pavitraettan?
Did you forget anything?

569
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:01,444
- You' ve not seen Aravindan's dad, have you? -No!

570
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,146
His dad died when he was too small, right?

571
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,237
Aravind was in 8th grade then.

572
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:11,277
His dad was very healthy and glamorous too!

573
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:12,445
He was our hero.

574
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,007
I've seen his photo!

575
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:17,181
One day, all of a sudden, his dad
collapsed on the road and died.

576
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:19,245
It was in the broad daylight.

577
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:22,614
The doctors said that
he was brought late to the hospital.

578
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:26,204
Unfortunately, nobody was willing
to help him that time

579
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:29,203
See you, then!

580
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:36,509
Shall I leave?

581
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:41,206
She is in full tension
because of this admission matter.

582
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:43,478
Only when she's angry,
she'll blurt out like that!

583
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:44,472
Poor soul!

584
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,341
She may become angry again. You go!

585
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:57,080
I never thought about that...

586
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,740
Amidst these tensions of Admission,
School, Office leave...

587
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:03,269
Doesn't matter. No problem

588
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,307
- Has our son slept? - Yes

589
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,545
Priya, ifs me

590
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,545
- Whoa! Brother! -Where are you?

591
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,272
Right now I'm in the market.

592
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,080

Atlast I'm lucky to see my sister-in-law.

600
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,780
- Is brother-in-law at home?
- He's in the shop.

601
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,410
Okay! <i>I'll</i> call his mobile. No problem

- Okay then! - Okay, bye, brother:

605

You go.

607

Won't we be back from hometown in 2 days time?

608
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:13,071
Why are you not so happy
about going to hometown this time?

609
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,980
No, I'm happy! But a problem exists there also!

610
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:17,238
What problem?

611
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:18,342

Planning to make your German sister-in-law

617
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,069
Has he started?

618
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,741
See! He talks excellent English

619
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,474
You are right. Let us do one thing.

00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,474
Wham if we put him to sleep

He's my brother-in-law, Aravind.

Come...Come.

640
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,701
Priya, are you fine?

641
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,377
Amaayi waiting! Lamp rounding!
(Traditional way of welcoming)

642
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,138
- Are you fine, dad?-Yes I'm fine

643
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:09,768

God bless you dear! Please come.

- Oh God, slippers! -Slippers are okay.
Dog may bite it, that's why!

647
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:20,975
Is the tender coconut drink ready?

648
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:24,448
Why English medium?
Why not Malayalam medium?

649
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,278
Because, if you don't know English,

650
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:34,111
You cannot achieve anything.

651
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,110
No good job...

652
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:41,012
No respect in the Society...

653
00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:42,712
Why so?

654
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,448
We all study in German at our school.

655
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,669
And I don't have any issue with English

656
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:53,574
I will learn Malayalam.
We can speak in Malayalam.

657
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,440
Let's speak in Malayalam, okay.

658
00:39:57,467 --> 00:39:59,140
I want to improve speaking in it.

659
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:06,306
Whenever you find time,
can you teach English to Manu?

660
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:08,543
How funny!

661
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:13,582
I learnt Malayalam only to speak to all of you.

662
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:15,636
You all want me to speak in English?

663
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,411
We shall talk in Malayalam

664
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:25,548
- But with Manu, only English! Please Angela
- Okay!

665
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,209
- Is it good? -Yes, ifs good!

666
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:34,277
And now wear a bindi also.

667
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,637
Come here and have this.

668
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,306
As there are many people here,

669
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,546
I didn't find time to attend to you.

670
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,580
Have it! Don't get angry...

671
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:52,771
- You sold the Nandhini cow, mom? - Yes.

672
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,977
Who is here to attend to all these chores?

673
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:59,205
I think you're still angry with me, mom!

674
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,606
No, I'm not.

675
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,378
I can understand, mom!
But Angela is a good girl, mom.

676
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,374
Don't I know that?

677
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,374
Actually, I wished to perform your marriage
in our Lord Krishna temple.

678
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,375
So what? It can also be done now.

679
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,977
Angela will be very happy.

680
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,168
- Really? - Yes

681
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:16,705
Shall I inform about this to dad?

682
00:41:17,034 --> 00:41:18,980
Was this your concern?
You must surely tell him

683
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:22,177
So, it is for this that
you made me feel bad for a whole day!

684
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:27,241
Hidimbi is a monstrous she-demon!

685
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:35,110
Slowly, she went near him
pulling out her nails...

686
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,473
- Oh God -...goggling her eyes.

687
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,240
And expanding her ears wide...

688
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:44,515
she furtively reached close to them.

689
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,175
Sshh...be silent!

690
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,774
A face that anyone would get frightened!

691
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:53,043
Do you know how Hidimbi was?

692
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:57,747
- She's as tall as the tree and rock like..
- I know grandma!

693
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,078
Then, you say.

694
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:01,473
A rock-like face!

695
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:02,372
Wham about her eyes?

696
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,773
RED like Tomato!

697
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:06,044
What about her teeth?

698
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:08,076
Long like an elephant tusk!

699
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:08,768
What about her tongue, then?

700
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:10,210
Tongue?

701
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,673
It's as long as Plantain leaf.

702
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:14,977
And her ears?

703
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:19,305
Ears are very big ones!

704
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:22,139
Ears are like winnow!

705
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,476
Grandma, even I wanted to say that!

706
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,536
You mischief! Like uncle, like nephew!

707
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,009
This is the right time to bait.

708
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,480
When the heat subsides fish will come up.

709
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:39,714
Won't the fish get burnt then, grandpa?

710
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,980
See this! This is a dough!

711
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:49,107
Take the dough and earthworm
and string them together in the corner of the bait.

712
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,610
Does the fish eat earthworms?
It only eats dough, right?

713
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,608
Wham do you eat for lunch?

714
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,278
Rice!

715
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,501
Do you eat only rice?

716
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,440
No...

717
00:43:01,634 --> 00:43:03,545
Won't you like to have a fish fry along with it?

718
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:04,168
Yes

719
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:06,673
- Greedy fish, isn't it Grandpa? -Yes it is!

720
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,438
Then, throw the bait like this,

721
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:14,141
How long do we have to hold it, grandpa?

722
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,074
Manu, you are here?

723
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:28,245
Got it!

724
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:31,473
Don't you like it.

725
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:48,416
On the wind, some beard grasses
came ﬂying without noise in the village

726
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,137
Came ﬂying without noise in the village

727
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:54,108
Came ﬂying without noise in the village

728
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:02,046
Fed up of forest scenes
they stood relaxing in the morning sunlight

729
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:04,970
Stood relaxing in the morning sunlight

730
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:07,646
Stood relaxing in the morning sunlight

731
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,374
O breeze, talking coquettishl

732
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:18,549
O koel, cooing sweet words you come

733
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:21,373
O breeze, talking coquettishly

734
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:27,142
O koel, cooing sweet words you come

735
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:32,679
On the wind, some beard grasses
came ﬂying without noise in the village

736
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:35,207
Came ﬂying without noise in the village

737
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,177
Came ﬂying without noise in the village

738
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,010
O breeze, talking coquettishly

739
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:49,178
O koel, cooing sweet words you come

740
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:52,176
O breeze, talking coquettishly

741
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:57,339
O koel, cooing sweet words you come

742
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:25,144
Swinging slowly on the bough of ﬂowers

743
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:30,673
The breeze is coming on a chariot
come down the hill

744
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,745
Where the warm sunlight dances

745
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:41,710
Are you coming to hear the festival story?

746
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:44,575
Come to this shade

747
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,474
Come for a short while

748
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:52,773
Come to kiss grandma
like a Mukkutti ﬂower

749
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,712
O breeze, talking coquettishly

750
00:45:56,067 --> 00:46:01,278
O koel, cooing sweet words you come

751
00:46:01,434 --> 00:46:04,108
O breeze, talking coquettishly

752
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:09,282
O koel, cooing sweet words you come

753
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:15,347
On the wind, some beard grasses

754
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,672
Came ﬂying without noise in the village

755
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:20,446
Came ﬂying without noise in the village

756
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:23,443
Came ﬂying without noise in the village

757
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:31,439
Fed up of forest scenes, they stood
relaxing in the morning sunlight

758
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:34,443
Stood relaxing in the morning sunlight

759
00:46:34,634 --> 00:46:36,978
Stood relaxing in the morning sunlight

760
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,740
Count down! 10...09...08...07... 06...05...

761
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,740
Still brother-in-law hasn't come up

762
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,205
Wham a chillness!

763
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:11,544
Pleasantness of bathing in the
pond is really different.

764
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,444
Where is the pool and where is the pond
- beyond comparison!

765
00:47:14,634 --> 00:47:17,046
Yes, Pool is in Germany and Pond in Kerala

766
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:18,772
Oh my brother-in-law!!

767
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:21,478
Well, how is your business?

768
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:25,048
As the Malayalees have no dearth of illness
my business is running quite well!

769
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,477
But you feel gloomy altogether!

770
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:30,206
- I really envy you - Why?

771
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,310
Your German wife will not insist her children
to study in English medium, will she?

772
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,037
Definitely. She will not insist
for an English medium,

773
00:47:36,334 --> 00:47:39,042
but their obstinacy goes
beyond that, brother-in-law!

774
00:47:39,534 --> 00:47:42,378
If there's a fight for any reason,
immediately they cut...

775
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:45,206
4mm - Not that. But divorce!

776
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,478
Then, they'll put case against us...

777
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:49,476
And entire properties should
be willed on their name...

778
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,611
And we have to look after them
for their lifetime

779
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,043
Fearing all this only, I also..

780
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,569
Let's move...They will be back now.

781
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:02,314
Good temple, isn't it?

782
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,508
- Haven't you finished bathing? - Yes.

783
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:08,474
- Are you not coming? - Here I come!

784
00:48:11,034 --> 00:48:11,739
He's always like this!!

785
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:15,472
Just to go to this temple,
they've dressed up like this!

786
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,301
Have to tolerate all these!

787
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,377
It's because you're afraid of your wife!

788
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:21,406
- Honey!-Yes, darling!
Calls me for giving me temple offerings!

789
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,446
Even in Germany, husbands are henpecked only.

790
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:28,209
Let me also go.

791
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:43,104
Yes, Teresa! Tell me

792
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,570
Now, we're in hometown.

793
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:49,142
Oh!! ls the dame announced? On Friday?

794
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,638
Okay, thank you.

795
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,544
Yes, we'll reach tomorrow.
Okay, bye, Teresa

796
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,978
What happened?

797
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:02,307
Holy Saints School has announced the
interview date for Manu's admission.

798
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:05,414
I was really scared whether they
would call or not for interview!

799
00:49:06,434 --> 00:49:07,970
What will they ask for interview?

800
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:11,511
Morris qualification, Dad's income”

801
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,405
Why do you insist on admitting
your son in this school?”

802
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,204
...many such questions.

803
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,381
Not sure of what they would ask.
They may ask anything!

804
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:22,314
We need to go tomorrow.

805
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,774
See you, then! Bye..

806
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,510
Study well! Obey whatever your mom says!

807
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,202
When will you come again to see grandma?

808
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:52,778
<i>I'll</i> come running to see you, grandma

809
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,505
This grandpa will come there
to see you my child!

810
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:16,747
- Where are your documents? - Eh!

811
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:18,311
Documents?

812
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,644
Degree certificate, Pre-degree certificate...

813
00:50:23,134 --> 00:50:24,477
Take good care of my SSLC certificate

814
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:27,075
10 -15 yrs hardvvork!

815
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:34,714
Pre-degree certificate! Aadhar Card!

816
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,239
Identity Card and Ration Card!

817
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,178
Do you need my horoscope?

818
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:45,474
Whats this, Aravindetta?

819
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:47,270
These copies are not at all clear.

820
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:49,607
How much ever I say,
you never heed my words!

821
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:51,544
Original itself is not clear!

822
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:53,338
Where is your degree certificate?

823
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:55,776
Give it! I need to pin it up.

824
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:57,712
It's good that I checked!!

825
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:01,074
Those are not necessary.

826
00:51:01,734 --> 00:51:04,340
Just say B.com!! No other proofis needed!

827
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:07,613
They are required.
You can't simply say like that.

828
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,510
We' ve to give correct proof for everything!

829
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,305
Don't waste time

830
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:17,204
- I forgot to collect my degree certificate!
- From where?

831
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,344
From the University!!

832
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:20,508
The", apply for it!

833
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,170
If I apply, I will surely get it

834
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,279
- But I need to wait for 2 - 3 yrs!! - 3 years?

835
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:28,677
Yes! First apply, then write the exam
and then get the certificate!

836
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:30,440
- Will take 3 years!! Will it be late?

837
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,577
But you said you're a B.com graduate!

838
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,572
I only said B.com

839
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:39,674
So, you were cheating me all these days!

840
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:02,636
I was not that poor in studies.

841
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,237
If you ask if I'd cheated you...

842
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:08,371
I don't know Priya

843
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,409
I didn't find time to correct it..
that is the fact!!

844
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:15,975
Everyone will have some personal story,

845
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,238
that can't be understood even when told!

846
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:23,577
I'm sorry.

847
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,973
You didn't eat anything, right?

848
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:41,506
Shall I make dosas?

849
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,010
I ate! Sorry! I was very hungry.

850
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,972
Do you mean for hire?

851
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:55,108
What nonsense are you talking?

852
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:59,445
It was you who told me that for interview
you can get people for hire!

853
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,308
Those situations are different!

854
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,012
Like.. Divorce case; single mother;
estranged parents.

855
00:53:06,634 --> 00:53:08,978
But yours is a happy family, isn't it?

856
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,702
Shall I divorce her then?

857
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:15,047
If it's the only way for getting admission,
I'm ready for that also.

858
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,577
That'll lead to trouble, Aravindan!

859
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:20,348
I can't step into that school again.

860
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:21,239
Why?

861
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,206
That's a big story.

862
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,705
I tried using my wits but it didn't work out.

863
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:31,579
Sir, please...l have trust on you.

864
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,575
- Is it such a grave issue? - Yes.

865
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,207
Imagine, what will happen
if a mad person rides a brakeless vehicle?

866
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,511
- Awful!-Yes, awful!!

867
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:47,475
Won't this be solved if money is given?

868
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:48,575
But, I don't have money

869
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,635
Then, there is only one way out.

870
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,612
Better ﬂy to Dubai.

871
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:57,306
Dubai!

872
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,638
Just lie that you're in Dubai!

873
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,211
Nobody will go and verify it.

874
00:54:01,434 --> 00:54:03,004
If that's the case, then
your wife can go alone.

875
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,144
Is the problem solved?

876
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,547
- You are really great, sir. -I know that!

877
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:10,372
Then, I shall meet you
after I return from Dubai.

878
00:54:10,634 --> 00:54:12,705
- Okay, Dubai!-Not like that!

879
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:14,443
Priya will be shocked.

880
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,444
Shucks! Why do you strain
yourself like this, Priya?

881
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:25,047
Don't you have back pain?
Can't you call that Pushpa?

882
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:26,678
What's your problem?

883
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,544
My back pain or that you
are not able to see Pushpa?

884
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,169
Whatever I say, you will misunderstand me

885
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:32,773
I didn't mean that.

886
00:54:33,134 --> 00:54:33,669
Whats the matter?

887
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:36,513
Our son will definitely get a seam this time.

888
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:38,337
I checked my weekly zodiac horoscope!

889
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,769
A very favourable period it seems!

890
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,579
So, I'm not coming with you
for the interview tomorrow.

891
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,737
Jeez! All this love was for that?

892
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,511
It's not than, Priya!

893
00:54:48,134 --> 00:54:50,512
For the interview, they'll ask me
some questions in front of you...

894
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,644
And I would also blabber something!

895
00:54:52,234 --> 00:54:54,680
Moreover, as I have no certificate,
I lost my full confidence

896
00:54:55,534 --> 00:54:56,638
- So... - So?

897
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,080
- So I'm ﬂying to Dubai! - Eh?

898
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:01,239
Tell them like that

899
00:55:01,534 --> 00:55:03,514
Oh!! Like your B.Com degree?!

900
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,314
Actually Kumar sir suggested this idea.

901
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:07,111
Hell with him!

902
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,041
If you try this,
it'll work out 'like Pushpam' (smoothly)!

903
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,138
You' ve been repeating this name
Pushpa for quite some days!

904
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:12,674
<i>I'll</i> leave that...

905
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:18,138
it's a small injection
when the tablet doesn't work! That's all!

906
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,002
Oh No! The dose was high!

907
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:25,546
No problem! <i>I'll</i> make it alright 'like Pushpam'
Hold it in the centre.

908
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:31,211
Anakha Mathews

909
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,610
Yes, madam!

910
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:51,973
After three children, ifs your turn.

00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:54,276
- Husband is in Dubai, right? - Hm..

912
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,511
Aravind? When did he ﬂy to Dubai?

913
00:55:58,467 --> 00:56:00,071
I'd seen him yesterday also.

914
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:03,346
No, ifs a mistake it's my brother who's abroad!

915
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,204
He is on the way!

916
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:09,206
How long will it take
for the interview to get over?

917
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:10,207
Only 30 minutes

918
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:11,669
After that, we'll close down.

919
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:14,538

Ladies and gentlemen!

1032
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,409
- Child labour, isn't it? -Yeah!

1033
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:28,406
Child labour is weak!
Child labour is a big pain to all.

1034
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:36,082
Because, in labour room,
when labour comes, child comes.

1035
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,080
My mother labour me.

1036
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,740
My wife mother labour my wife

1037
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:47,213
My wife labour my son

1038
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,373
Labour ladies only.

1039
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,549
Because labour start,
mother child romance start!

1040
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:03,705
My mother tells always she labour me 10 months.

1041
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:06,211
Reason - Who? My father!

1042
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,538
Once upon a time, my father said...

1043
01:04:09,334 --> 01:04:11,041
Sorry, I need to talk in English, isn't it?

1044
01:04:11,734 --> 01:04:15,546
In black and white time;
normal labour no problem.

1045
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:20,344
Not only but also my mother seven times,

1046
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:23,047
Still full energy but no more

1047
01:04:24,067 --> 01:04:28,345
Time pass...Time pass...
normal labour here and there.

1048
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,337
But also caesarean labour everywhere.

1049
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:37,176
My own wife...
cried in labour room Caesarean...Caesarean

1050
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:40,348
I no agree! Why? Climax!

1051
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,671
Look, my property - The Priya full fit, 0k?

1052
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:49,509
Normal labour first pain. Future no pain.

1053
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:53,507
Caesarean labour
- First no pain, future intense pain.

1054
01:04:54,034 --> 01:05:00,679
I full stop! Child labour - Fantastic!

1055
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,304
Yours faithfully, Aravind T P

1056
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,670
- Some water, please! - Of course, have it!

1057
01:05:13,267 --> 01:05:14,007
I didn't expect this much!

1058
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,476
- Very good! I like it.

1059
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:23,147
Thank you!

1060
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,478
Come quickly!

1061
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:33,645
Your mom is angry.
She didn't like me “shine” in front of them!

1062
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:36,478
Wham did they ask you? -Alphabets!

1063
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:37,975
It was easy for you.

1064
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:41,273
It was easy for mom also!
They confused only me

1065
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,979
But I astonished them!

1066
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,973
- Really? - Yes

1067
01:05:45,134 --> 01:05:47,273
Come quickly, or else mom will
take away the bike and go.

1068
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,971
Wait, Priya! Why are you not happy?

1069
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,280
Are you such a fool?

1070
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,210
My skin was totally peeled off!

1071
01:05:56,467 --> 01:05:59,971
Wham for? Tell me.

1072
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:03,277
- Do you know what is Child labour?
- What? Tell me! Was I wrong?

1073
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,212
As if school will ask about “Child birth”!

1074
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:08,447
Even I too thought why they are asking that!

1075
01:06:08,634 --> 01:06:12,776
Shut up! Child labour doesn't
mean Labour room or Labour law.

1076
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,780
- Means Children going for work!
- Is that so?

1077
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,602
Wouldn't I've impressed
if you'd given me an hint?

1078
01:06:19,467 --> 01:06:20,775
Aren't these 'messing up' enough?
Coming again to mess up things!

1079
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:26,076
- Dad! Good job! - Thank you, son.

1080
01:06:26,267 --> 01:06:27,245
Come here!

1081
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:33,074
Gosh! Not now.

1082
01:06:37,434 --> 01:06:38,777
Why do you look worried, boss?

1083
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,404
Have you heard of child labour?

1084
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,080
Asking me if I've heard of it?

1085
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,076
Am I not working here since 10 -12yrs?

1086
01:06:47,267 --> 01:06:48,177
Don't you know this?

1087
01:06:48,433 --> 01:06:49,571
Let our customers don't hear this.

1088
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:51,041
Really feel sorry for you!

1089
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,046
Being the owner of medical shop
and you don't know this Ugh!

1090
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:56,405
I need to quit from here

1091
01:06:58,434 --> 01:07:00,038
This is that stuff!

1092
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,573
For children, one time a day
and adult, twice a day.

1093
01:07:04,767 --> 01:07:07,748
If I hadn't got a rascal like you,
I would've gone begging.

1094
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,046
<i>I'll</i> always be with you
in your joys and sorrows!

1095
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:14,373
But when you die,
don't ask me also to die with you.

1096
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:15,136
Why?

1097
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,210
This shop will be left abandoned!
Only for that reason I say!

1098
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,038
Actually, you're not fit to stand here

1099
01:07:20,233 --> 01:07:22,543
- Please sit down! - Really?

1100
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,710
Thanks for understanding
me at least now, boss.

1101
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,145
What did you call this as?

1102
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,378
CHILD LABOUR!

1103
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:32,706
- Gosh! - Rascal!

1104
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:36,009
Child labour is your grandpa!

1105
01:07:39,134 --> 01:07:42,707
Isn't this the one?
But I'd given this to a customer:

1106
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:46,548
Lord Shiva temple?! The most powerful God!

1107
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:49,171
Did you go there, Angela?

1108
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:54,706
Aravindetta went to check the results

1109
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:58,515
What is your plan for today?

1110
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:05,503
Aravindetta is calling!
<i>I'll</i> call you back, Angela!

1111
01:08:07,534 --> 01:08:09,980
Aravindetta! What happened?
Did you get the results?

1112
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,510
Got the results as expected but didn't get!

1113
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:16,342
Seems they still got
some more papers to be checked!

1114
01:08:16,534 --> 01:08:18,980
There is no such rule followed there.

1115
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,669
Yes I too asked them

1116
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,340
Saying there is no necessity for my son
to study in such an irresponsible school,

1117
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:24,512
I walked off from there!

1118
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,510
Oh! Now I got to understand.

1119
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,303
Somebody is at the door.

1120
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,475
Hello! Fearing you, I was standing outside.

1121
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,475
Priya, shall we have lunch?

1122
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:44,305
Good boy!

1123
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,640
Now get me the
blue colour medicine taken for fever.

1124
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,638
- Blue colour? - Yes, that one!

1125
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:56,480
Clever boy! Now get me
the red colour syrup taken for cough

1126
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:00,478
- Red colour, ah? Is this the one? - Good boy!

1127
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:03,475
Now which one will you take?

1128
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,773
Happy, ah? That you got an assistant?

1129
01:09:07,134 --> 01:09:10,479
Certainly! Did we know anything
about this at the age of 5?

1130
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:14,046
Oh!! Also teach him how to
ride a bike after some time.

1131
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:14,778
What for?

1132
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:17,114
For him to keep standing outside some campus,

1133
01:09:19,467 --> 01:09:22,448
to lie that he has got
some degree like B.Com, B.tech etc.

1134
01:09:22,634 --> 01:09:24,272
Needn't say he has passed out!.

1135
01:09:24,467 --> 01:09:25,775
So, that won't become a lie, right?

1136
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,281
Like you cheated me,
let him also cheat some woman.

1137
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,213
Shall I get you the medicine for headache?

1138
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:37,277
Your mom has gone crazy! We shall play later.

1139
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:39,738
<i>- Come on , chap'. - 0k</i>

1140
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,272
Everything is a joke for you.

1141
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,745
Listen to me carefully.

1142
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,741
If he doesn't get in St.Antony's also,
that will be the end of his future

1143
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,238
Later don't blame me

1144
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:54,743
You may do anything you want like
donation, recommendation or bribery,

1145
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,408
I don't mind.

1146
01:09:57,434 --> 01:09:59,072
Go and do your homework.

1147
01:09:59,634 --> 01:10:02,240
- Finished my homework, mom!
- Then study something

1148
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,240
All 24 hrs Cartoon!!
You are not less in that.

1149
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,579
<i>I'll</i> stop everything, mind you!

1150
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:10,081
Move! -Will sit blocking the way!

1151
01:10:12,034 --> 01:10:15,572
Dad, come with me Did mom beat you?

1152
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:18,407
- No, she caressed my hair. - Is it?

1153
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:23,413
Doesn't matter! You go and watch T.V, 0k?

1154
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:26,205
Let me go there and get!

1155
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:30,705
- Shining Stars! - Eh?

1156
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:34,048
Career Guidance Centre run by my friend's cousin!

1157
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:41,039
Until last year, my friend Rani, her husband
didn't even know how to write his own name

1158
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,540
Still, her son got admission in Vidya Gurukulam!

1159
01:10:45,001 --> 01:10:45,979
- Do you know how? - How?

1160
01:10:46,234 --> 01:10:47,372
Shining Stars!

1161
01:10:48,401 --> 01:10:50,381
If anybody wishes Good morning to her husband,

1162
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,376
he used to tell them to mind their business

1163
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:57,676
- Apart from coaching the child,
the Madam there, readied the parents too. - Really?

1164
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:01,673
L' ve asked Rani to arrange a class for five families.

1165
01:11:02,034 --> 01:11:05,777
- Me, one of Rani's cousin,
Chacko's two friends and you! - OK!

1166
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,178
A week's Crash course!

1167
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,012
Will this work out in a week's time?

1168
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,672
If the training is good,
then one week will be more than sufficient.

1169
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,180
Not sure whether Aravindettan
will stay away from shop!

1170
01:11:15,034 --> 01:11:17,537
Coax him and get it done!!

1171
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,012
I don't have to teach you than, right?

1172
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,340
Wham are you doing over there?

1173
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:52,971
Come.

1174
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:04,743
Sorry, Aravindetta! I needlessly got angry.

1175
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:09,138
No...Doesn't matter.
I was looking out for something else.

1176
01:12:09,334 --> 01:12:12,315
Here is the fixed deposit for two lakhs!

1177
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,480
If I pledge the medical shop too,
I will get Rs 3 lakhs!

1178
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,303
And some dues from those
who were given medicines on credit.

1179
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:21,306
But most of them are already dead.
So it's not possible to get that.

1180
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:25,315
However this is quite adequate
to give donation to Manu's school.

1181
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,475
Tell me which school you want.
The choice is yours!

1182
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:33,474
I blurted out something
due to my anger at that time.

1183
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:37,274
For that, are you going to throw away
everything you'd saved till now?!

1184
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,605
It's only for you both, not me!!

1185
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,270
Shining Stars is enough for me.

1186
01:12:45,467 --> 01:12:47,708
Which school is that?
You'd not mentioned about it so far!.

1187
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:51,581
A grooming school run by a Madam
a well-wisher of Teresa!

1188
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,575
Grooming School? What's that?

1189
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,110
Similar to Manu's play school!

1190
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:02,114
A new concept. They will coach parents also along
with children for school admission.

1191
01:13:03,134 --> 01:13:05,080
If we join there, admission is for sure!

1192
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:07,572
I swear you will also like it.

1193
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,438
Just for a week!

1194
01:13:09,767 --> 01:13:13,579
Going back to school at this age..

1195
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,443
People will call me a nut!

1196
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,577
I'm sorry, I can't!

1197
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:21,239
Others are..

1198
01:13:21,434 --> 01:13:22,242
Who are the others? -Teresa!

1199
01:13:23,267 --> 01:13:23,745
Then?

1200
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:29,080
3 - 4 families Only for us, nothing...

1201
01:13:32,267 --> 01:13:35,544
They may be eager to go back to school again
but not me.

1202
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:38,411
From childhood, my hands and legs
used to tremble on seeing school.

1203
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,546
And moreover, they will all be wealthy family!

1204
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:45,415
There's no one to whom
I can entrust my shop when I go!

1205
01:13:45,734 --> 01:13:49,409
Please Aravindetta! it's for our Manu, right?

1206
01:13:49,734 --> 01:13:53,705
Only for a week!
I didn't ask you anything else, right?

1207
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:56,038
No!...You!

1208
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:01,378
As ifs a gain of 4 - 5 lakhs,
this is not a problem!

1209
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:04,206
Do we need to go for an interview
for this school admission also?

1210
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:07,205
No!! There are no such things there.

1211
01:14:09,667 --> 01:14:10,509
Then, I'm ready for an embarrassment!

1212
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,708
Thank you, Aravindetta!

1213
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:20,047
- Are you scared?-Little.

1214
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:22,214
- Don't be afraid. - Still"

1215
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,209
Not over there! it's here, isn't it?

1216
01:14:25,034 --> 01:14:26,012
Do they normally put it here?

1217
01:14:26,401 --> 01:14:27,505
Then, I shall also do it there.

1218
01:14:29,634 --> 01:14:31,511
--Will it pain?
- You will only feel the pain of an ant bite!

1219
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:33,172
Sometimes of two ant bites!

1220
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,378
Don't cry

1221
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,510
- Shucks! Gone?- Everything's gone waste!

1222
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,678
I wantedly wasted it...

1223
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,009
Like the way the leftover batter
is wasted after making dosas

1224
01:14:42,201 --> 01:14:44,340
- Exactly!

1225
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,180
We've plenty of stock unnecessarily here

1226
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,339
Please come later, when my boss is not there.

1227
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,637
Ugh! Needlessly troubling others!

1228
01:14:58,201 --> 01:14:59,578
You look very handsome!

1229
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:03,174
Leave that! What the hell were you doing?
He will die!

1230
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:06,177
This is your problem! Never let me do any work.

1231
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,641
I will only shrivel up then!

1232
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:08,979
Wham more is there to shrivel?

1233
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:12,341
Don't you know I aspired to become a Doctor?

1234
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,978
To become a Doctor,
you need to go to School first.

1235
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:15,975
Then College!

1236
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:18,142
Even now we can go, right?
Like you're going now!

1237
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:19,475
No, I didn't intend that.

1238
01:15:20,334 --> 01:15:22,575
I won't be here for a week!

1239
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,479
Take care of the needs.

1240
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:29,138
How am I to show gratitude for giving me
an opportunity to prove my sincerity?

1241
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:32,443
Always keep me informed about all the happenings!

1242
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,442
- About what happening? - World news!

1243
01:15:34,634 --> 01:15:35,305
What?

1244
01:15:35,467 --> 01:15:37,970
- Keep me informed about the
happening in the shop. - Sure

1245
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,443
When I come back,
Shop must remain the same!

1246
01:15:40,634 --> 01:15:42,307
Don't I need to sell any medicines?

1247
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,440
When you go to school and become a great man,
please don't forget me, boss!

1248
01:15:46,634 --> 01:15:47,544
Can we take a selfie?

1249
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,778
<i>I'll</i> surely come back, man!

1250
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:50,771
Don't I need to see you till such time?

1251
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,781
To click a selfie,
your arm should have a minimum length at least!

1252
01:15:57,134 --> 01:15:57,612
Smile!

1253
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,780
I heard you're going back to school again.

1254
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:00,779
Is it for studying?

1255
01:16:01,134 --> 01:16:02,442
No, for a shave!

1256
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:05,114
With shin tucked in, you look very smart.

1257
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:08,407
You get a water bottle free
along with Junior Horlicks.

1258
01:16:08,634 --> 01:16:10,409
- Shall I get 10 nos.?-No thanks!

1259
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,613
I think everybody has gone crazy here

1260
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:16,282
From now on, I'm in charge of everything here

1261
01:16:16,434 --> 01:16:17,777
So, please deal with me!

1262
01:16:18,134 --> 01:16:22,276
Get 10 nos. of water bottle you
mentioned now for my home needs.

1263
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:33,479
Is the class conducted in this Hotel?

1264
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:36,079
It's not a hotel but their
own college! Come!

1265
01:16:36,267 --> 01:16:38,975
- Free, isn't it? - it's free! Come.

1266
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:42,145
Stay here.

1267
01:16:42,334 --> 01:16:44,644
- Mom, is this a School? - Hmm!

1268
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:50,645
Greetings! - Greeting; sir!

1269
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,138
Look at this!

1270
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:53,645
Come on, change than.

1271
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,642
Best education there!
Things are, not as we imagine!

1272
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,106
Hello...Anbi...Anbesol is on the 3rd rack!

1273
01:17:04,467 --> 01:17:06,276
You can't use the phone here. Cut it!

1274
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,637
For three square meals this is needed!

1275
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:09,604
Not necessary!

1276
01:17:11,467 --> 01:17:12,605
Good morning, everyone!

1277
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,608
Please...Please sit down.

1278
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,280
A very warm welcome to all of you!

1279
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,270
Welcome all of you to the
Shining Stars programme of Asian School of Business!

1280
01:17:24,634 --> 01:17:28,776
Once again, you must be feeling like a small kid
sitting in the classroom, right?

1281
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:32,773
Seeing the chair I feel as though I'm
sitting in the Parliament!

1282
01:17:33,634 --> 01:17:35,443
Anyway, my name is Deepika

1283
01:17:36,634 --> 01:17:41,413
Giving best education
to our children is our dream.

1284
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,080
That's the reason you've put aside
all your work and come here!

1285
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,771
Right to Education Act - RTE 4th August 2009

1286
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:54,415
Article 21A of the Indian Constitution says that...

1287
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,245
for the sake of school admission,

1288
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,173
neither the children nor their parents
should be interviewed!

1289
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:01,174
- Really? - Hmm!

1290
01:18:01,434 --> 01:18:06,042
But most of the schools conduct this interview
even now in different names..

1291
01:18:06,434 --> 01:18:08,038
Like an interactive session!

1292
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:12,046
To wait for these rules to be amended
before getting admission for your child,

1293
01:18:12,267 --> 01:18:13,405
won't it take a long time?

1294
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:19,046
So, let's try and see what we can do
within the existing rules and systems!

1295
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:22,582
So, this one week,
which we' re going to spend together...

1296
01:18:23,234 --> 01:18:27,580
will be more than enough for you
and your little Shining stars,

1297
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:29,212
to accomplish the dreams!!

1298
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:33,377
So, let's get to know each other.

Yes!

1314
01:19:29,534 --> 01:19:30,672
Aravindetta, get up.

1315
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,977
I'm Aravind, Priya Medical shop Owner.

1316
01:19:36,534 --> 01:19:38,980
Wife...Priya medi..Sorry, she's an accountant

1317
01:19:39,534 --> 01:19:41,309
My hometown is Aanapara,
next to Undancode!

1318
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,674
In school, they called me Aravind T P!

1319
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:00,645
- Okay, please sit! -could've stood!

1320
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:05,642
We'll take a short break now.

1321
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,304
<i>I'll</i> be with my real Shining stars...
the little ones.

1322
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,480
Be good children, ok!

1323
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,309
We can see on the jasmines,

1324
01:20:17,334 --> 01:20:19,109
the Kona ﬂowers,

1325
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,774
the leaves,

1326
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:24,647
the roses,

1327
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,480
the sky

1328
01:20:28,067 --> 01:20:30,980
and the butterﬂies - a 100 colours!

1329
01:20:32,301 --> 01:20:34,110
My husband spends most
of his time in recording.

1330
01:20:36,634 --> 01:20:38,705
In my family, all are good in studies.

1331
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,439
Hello! I'm Mohan Kumar.

1332
01:20:47,067 --> 01:20:48,273
She's my wife Meenakshi!

1333
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:50,447
I know her. We studied together!

1334
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:57,279
I have no hopes about this Class!
As she insisted, I came!

1335
01:20:58,301 --> 01:21:00,247
- Even Aravindetta was...
- I was also interested.

1336
01:21:00,467 --> 01:21:02,743
When she mentioned about this,
I told her it'll be a great programme!

1337
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,443
But I didn't expect this much.

1338
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,610
- He's in Police! - I understood!

1339
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:19,242
No! Don't punch him,
I will come and punch him

1340
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:29,710
- We both have... - No, I never go out.

1341
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,046
Looks like an insane!
You're alright, aren't you?

1342
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,707
- Wham? -Am I alright?

1343
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:40,411
- Come, let's go - Shall we get something?
Yes, we've to!

1344
01:21:41,234 --> 01:21:41,712
Let'; go!

1345
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:45,412
- Hello! 15 Dum Biriyani
- Mr. Shameer, please sit!

1346
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:45,975
Sorry, madam

1347
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,373
Excuse me, come. . .come.

1348
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,380
Please sit...Sit down

1349
01:21:53,234 --> 01:21:54,212
Everyone here?

1350
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,037
- We shall sit over here
- That's what I also said

1351
01:21:57,401 --> 01:22:00,541
- That's why... - Mr. Shameer, shall we begin?

1352
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:02,671
All of you settled, right? Shall we start?

1353
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,040
Can anybody say which
is the best school here?

1354
01:22:11,567 --> 01:22:12,375
And the best teacher?

1355
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:15,013
- Lakshmi teacher in Blossoms! - Lakshmi!

1356
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,006
Allur Mohammed sir!

1357
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:22,777
No! Best school is our house!

1358
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:25,010
And best teacher - Parents!

1359
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:28,680
Children learn everything
watching their parents.

1360
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:30,536
They' re like a sponge!

1361
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,342
Will grasp whatever they see and hear!

1362
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:42,345
Like biting nails often, shaking
leg; chewing gums,

1363
01:22:43,034 --> 01:22:46,015
then, talking aloud over the phone.

1364
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:49,007
All this create a very bad
impression about you.

1365
01:22:49,534 --> 01:22:51,980
This is what we call it as Bad manners!

1366
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,180
Be it in an interview or in your own life.

1367
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:59,983
Behaviour is more important
than how you perform it!

1368
01:23:00,534 --> 01:23:04,641
Always remember, the 1st impression
is the last impression!

1369
01:23:05,367 --> 01:23:05,742
Agreed?

1370
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:07,510
There is no such medicine

1371
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,140
- Abhi, don't run...Wait..
- Don't give, We'll be in trouble!

1372
01:23:14,167 --> 01:23:15,305
Then, give! I shall call you back!

1373
01:23:18,334 --> 01:23:22,612
I didn't expect this meeting
after so many years

1374
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:25,477
Me too! Do you think of me?

1375
01:23:27,334 --> 01:23:29,610
Flowers that bloomed in heart
never withers, my beloved”

1376
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:31,309
...the words that I wrote
in your autograph book

1377
01:23:31,501 --> 01:23:32,309
I haven't forgotten!

1378
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:38,613
I'm in the Dining hall!

1379
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,309
No need. <i>I'll</i> come there right away.

1380
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:43,610
Wife?

1381
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:47,781
Can be called so!
But I like to call it as the GAME OF FATE!

1382
01:23:49,134 --> 01:23:50,477
Be satisfied with what you have!

1383
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,279
I've got many things to share with you

1384
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,776
But if I don't go now,
then I won't be able to share it at all.

1385
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,574
When did you both meet last?

1386
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:04,779
Now!

1387
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:06,438
Not that! Before this?

1388
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:07,771
That was on the day before our marriage

1389
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,280
Will pop up to trouble others needlessly!

1390
01:24:11,467 --> 01:24:12,571
- Dad! - What?

1391
01:24:12,767 --> 01:24:14,440
- Sit straight. - Eh!

1392
01:24:14,601 --> 01:24:16,103
Sit straight!

1393
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:21,271
Spine up right!

1394
01:24:21,467 --> 01:24:25,005
Hasn't Deepika teacher asked
us to sit straight always?

1395
01:24:26,267 --> 01:24:27,575
Began your coaching at home also!!

1396
01:24:27,767 --> 01:24:28,575
I don't know.

1397
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:29,507
Show me

1398
01:24:29,701 --> 01:24:30,736
Sit aside, Dad!

1399
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:32,445
I did!

1400
01:24:41,267 --> 01:24:42,075
Omg! I made a mistake.

1401
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:08,542
Stop, Mr.Mohan!

1402
01:25:10,067 --> 01:25:13,048
You get the 1st chance today.
This question is for you!

1403
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:15,373
You already have a son Abhi at home, right?

1404
01:25:17,067 --> 01:25:20,378
Imagine that another child
is going to be born to you soon!

1405
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,381
- Mr. Mohan, just imagine
- I didn't know this!

1406
01:25:26,634 --> 01:25:28,705
- Imagine! - Oh, okay!

1407
01:25:29,234 --> 01:25:31,680
How will you put this across to your son Abhi?

1408
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:35,206
That'; madamm...about my 2nd child..

1409
01:25:36,701 --> 01:25:38,374
- I need to tell this to my 1st son! - Hmm!

1410
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,609
No...l won't say! I will not
tell it to anybody I swear!

1411
01:25:43,034 --> 01:25:44,672
Sit down, <i>I'll</i> say, madam

1412
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:50,679
<i>I'll</i> ask Abhi, “To play with you, to draw with you
and to put to sleep in a cradle...

1413
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,510
and to call you “brother”,
don't you want a baby?”

1414
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,179
- Very good! Sit! - Thank you!

1415
01:25:56,367 --> 01:25:59,507
Actually, children are more caring than elders.

1416
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:04,172
These baby dolls...are especially liked
by the girl children...

1417
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:05,004
...haven't you noticed?

1418
01:26:05,367 --> 01:26:10,180
In fact, in most of the cases
children are more responsible than elders!

1419
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,342
Stan the music.

1420
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,173
Mr.Aravind, why do you want
admission for your child in this school?

1421
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:22,970
Yes!

1422
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:25,979
Why do you insist
on admitting Manu in this School?

1423
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,343
Come on, answer!

1424
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:30,977
That...l don't know, ma'am!

1425
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:34,148
Come on, Say whatever you feel!

1426
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:37,645
No, I don't know to speak in English.

1427
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:42,142
Then, speak in Malayalam!

1428
01:26:42,334 --> 01:26:46,441
No point in speaking in Malayalam.
My child will not get admission.

1429
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:52,140
No, you're wrong! No school will ignore you
for speaking in Malayalam!

1430
01:26:52,334 --> 01:26:55,144
Actually I studied in Malayalam medium

1431
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,446
I learnt English Alphabets
only in the grade of 5!

1432
01:26:58,801 --> 01:27:01,782
Moreover Malayalam is also not necessary
for the children of this generation.

1433
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:06,104
And for me, I know nothing
other than Malayalam!

1434
01:27:06,334 --> 01:27:11,113
Hey, no...no!! See, Aravind,
Malayalam is a classical language.

1435
01:27:11,334 --> 01:27:13,109
English language is also necessary for us.

1436
01:27:13,567 --> 01:27:16,548
For pursuing higher studies for our career,

1437
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,407
and to communicate with the outside world,
English is essential for us.

1438
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:24,408
While communicating in our mother-tongue,
it is received in our heart!

1439
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,406
And in case of other language,
it is received in our brain! That's all!

1440
01:27:35,534 --> 01:27:37,275
- You're really great! - Eh!

1441
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,280
When you told
about Shining Stars the other day,

1442
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,102
I absolutely had no idea about it!

1443
01:27:45,101 --> 01:27:47,081
What all were we able to learn from there!

1444
01:27:48,534 --> 01:27:50,411
Certain things are not
getting wiped off from my mind.

1445
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,244
Didn't you hear what she said,

1446
01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:56,243
How easy it is to beget a child, right?

1447
01:27:57,767 --> 01:27:59,246
If we hadn't gone together,

1448
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:03,071
Would we've arrived at a conclusion
of having a second child?

1449
01:28:03,267 --> 01:28:05,577
We?! When did we decide?

1450
01:28:06,267 --> 01:28:07,245
That's quite easy, isn't it?

1451
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,078
Let's call our son and ask..

1452
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:18,478
Shall I give a baby to play, draw,
sing lullaby and call you a brother?

1453
01:28:18,734 --> 01:28:19,712
Is that alone enough?

1454
01:28:20,101 --> 01:28:21,705
Then your full cooperation

1455
01:28:22,567 --> 01:28:26,037
You!! First try to get admission
for your 1st child!

1456
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:27,707
And later decide about new shining star!

1457
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:30,236
Come with a drumstick readily!!

1458
01:28:31,267 --> 01:28:32,541
So, there is no chance for
this in near future.

1459
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:34,704
No problem

1460
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,344
Bloody drumstick!
That's the reason no dog wants it!

1461
01:28:44,234 --> 01:28:45,212
Please wait.

1462
01:28:45,734 --> 01:28:47,714
Which place is this?
Where do I search for him?!

1463
01:28:48,067 --> 01:28:49,205
None of them are seen around also.

1464
01:28:51,234 --> 01:28:52,713
Oh some marriage here!

1465
01:28:55,067 --> 01:28:55,442
Little bro!

1466
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:56,609
What?

1467
01:28:57,067 --> 01:28:59,445
Sorry, big bro! Where's the place
my boss is studying?

1468
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:00,508
What boss!!

1469
01:29:01,467 --> 01:29:03,208
I mean the place where married ones study!

1470
01:29:03,534 --> 01:29:07,209
Go straight, take a left,
you will find a hall there.

1471
01:29:07,701 --> 01:29:08,338
What Crap!

1472
01:29:08,534 --> 01:29:10,013
Hello, is there any other entrance?

1473
01:29:11,034 --> 01:29:14,345
Just go straight, and take a left.
You will see a hall there

1474
01:29:15,034 --> 01:29:15,512
Is that the easy way?

1475
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,008
Headmaster I suppose!

1476
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:21,678
Here he's!

1477
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:25,182
Boss! Were you thrown out of the class?

1478
01:29:26,034 --> 01:29:26,671
I'm studying.

1479
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:29,173
Did I create a disturbance?

1480
01:29:29,334 --> 01:29:30,244
No! What brought you here now?

1481
01:29:30,434 --> 01:29:31,674
- To get the cheque signed - Eh?!

1482
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:33,012
To get the cheque signed!

1483
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,578
Say that properly first!

1484
01:29:36,434 --> 01:29:38,311
- Hi, T.P, Good morning! - Good morning.

1485
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,004
See! This whole thing is for studying!!

1486
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:47,174
Full of chicks here, boss!

1487
01:29:47,334 --> 01:29:47,971
Pullets are also here!

1488
01:29:48,201 --> 01:29:49,305
- I got to see when I entered here!
- Did you?

1489
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:51,481
Yes! Excellent English!

1490
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,476
- Moreover, a child labour! -You rascal!

1491
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:58,981
- In my medical shop, this man ism-Pharmacist!

1492
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:00,645
Try to say the word properly

1493
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:02,139
She understood!

1494
01:30:02,501 --> 01:30:04,481
- Are you not coming? - Coming!

1495
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,437
Boss! Who is that?

1496
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:16,978
My childhood friend! Classmates!

1497
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:23,443
So, opportunities are knocking
only on married ones!

1498
01:30:23,634 --> 01:30:26,274
I must get married
as soon as possible and join here.

1499
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:31,447
How does that lady in brown saree look?

1500
01:30:34,134 --> 01:30:36,614
- Aravind's staff, right?
- Yes, how did you know?

1501
01:30:37,634 --> 01:30:38,772
Hmm...l understood.

1502
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:41,112
How is your boss?

1503
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,438
My boss! He's a playboy

1504
01:30:45,634 --> 01:30:47,409
Green and blue are also good!

1505
01:30:53,634 --> 01:30:56,444
- Thank you, madam!
- Yeah, madam Thank you!

1506
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:02,112
Congrats! How long have you been married?
- Fifteen years!

1507
01:31:02,434 --> 01:31:04,243
Even life imprisonment is only up to 14 yrs

1508
01:31:04,601 --> 01:31:07,241
- You have to compete!
- Definitely! I've no other option!

1509
01:31:09,134 --> 01:31:14,345
My shop's best item is for lunch today!
Noora, serve it!

1510
01:31:14,601 --> 01:31:15,739
Wait...Wait...Wait.

1511
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:22,073
Do you know which are the most
favourite dishes of your wife?

1512
01:31:23,267 --> 01:31:23,574
He doesn't know!

1513
01:31:25,101 --> 01:31:30,210
Today, all husbands, including Mr.Shameer,
will be serving their wives today, 0k?

1514
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:32,337
Come on! Why you're sitting shy?

1515
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:36,207
All husbands get up!
Take your plates, and serve your beautiful wives!

1516
01:31:39,334 --> 01:31:39,744
What's it?

1517
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:42,745
Ladies, please come! Come all of you.

1518
01:31:43,767 --> 01:31:45,075
It's not only for today.

1519
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:48,548
Hereafter this will be the
routine in your house daily.

1520
01:31:48,767 --> 01:31:51,748
Always give first preference to women!

1521
01:31:52,334 --> 01:31:56,373
When you go
to a reputed school for an admission,

1522
01:31:57,101 --> 01:32:01,311
Open the door, and first
send your wife inside,

1523
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:02,545
then, your child,

1524
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:04,705
and last will be you!

1525
01:32:05,334 --> 01:32:08,315
And always try
and remember to ask for permission.

1526
01:32:08,567 --> 01:32:12,709
May I come in? May I sit down?
May I serve my wife?”

1527
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,280
- Take it! - They are not used to such things!

1528
01:32:20,567 --> 01:32:21,099
Feeling shy?

1529
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:21,339
Feeling shy?

1530
01:32:35,701 --> 01:32:42,676
To ﬂy up in the dreams,
be quiet naughty children”

1531
01:32:43,034 --> 01:32:46,504
On the wings of the rainbow, ﬂy high”

1532
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:51,149
Did you see anywhere, dear Parrot”

1533
01:32:51,367 --> 01:32:54,075
Far away on some beautiful hill,“

1534
01:32:54,267 --> 01:32:58,238
A new spike has appeared”

1535
01:32:58,534 --> 01:33:04,075
Spreading inside me today
is this lovely rhythm”

1536
01:33:04,267 --> 01:33:11,310
isn't it the day when I too join this
like a deer dancing by itself”

1537
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:15,138
Unseen by anyone,”

1538
01:33:15,334 --> 01:33:19,077
Unheard by anyone”

1539
01:33:19,267 --> 01:33:26,151
Not speaking anything,
will you come?”

1540
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:30,043
Unseen by anyone,”

1541
01:33:30,267 --> 01:33:33,476
Unheard by anyone”

1542
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:42,485
Not speaking anything, will you join?”

1543
01:33:49,467 --> 01:33:52,971
In the room of my heart I filled long ago”

1544
01:33:53,134 --> 01:33:56,604
Gold unseen by anyone, naughty children”

1545
01:33:57,001 --> 01:34:00,210
- Will you come again with sweet”

1546
01:34:00,467 --> 01:34:04,609
All are going come, parrot”

1547
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:12,184
Today is the ritual dance
to taste the new nectar”

1548
01:34:12,467 --> 01:34:17,610
Spreading inside me today
is this lovely rhythm”

1549
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:25,184
isn't it the day when I too join this
like a deer dancing by itself”

1550
01:34:25,434 --> 01:34:29,075
Unseen by anyone,”

1551
01:34:29,267 --> 01:34:32,578
Unheard by anyone”

1552
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:40,083
Not speaking anything, will you come?”

1553
01:34:40,267 --> 01:34:43,578
Unseen by anyone,”

1554
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:47,408
Unheard by anyone”

1555
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:54,745
Not speaking anything, will you join?”

1556
01:34:55,067 --> 01:34:58,412
Unseen by anyone,”

1557
01:34:58,601 --> 01:35:02,139
Unheard by anyone”

1558
01:35:02,434 --> 01:35:11,047
Not speaking anything, will you come?”

1559
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,044
- One point! - One point for you.

1560
01:35:18,234 --> 01:35:19,042
Two points!

1561
01:35:20,734 --> 01:35:22,213
-What? - <i>I'll</i> let you know, sit down.

1562
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,538
Dad! Serve me first!

1563
01:35:28,234 --> 01:35:30,009
No, ladies first!

1564
01:35:31,567 --> 01:35:33,205
Then, comes the family!

1565
01:35:35,134 --> 01:35:37,705
And now.. Oh my god!
Where is the plate?

1566
01:35:39,201 --> 01:35:41,181
And last for this poor, Aravind T P!

1567
01:35:43,567 --> 01:35:45,547
Next is curry!

1568
01:35:47,567 --> 01:35:49,547
Ladies first!

1569
01:35:50,367 --> 01:35:53,177
- Then, come the family! - Family!

1570
01:35:53,534 --> 01:35:56,708
And last is for the poor, Aravind T P!

1571
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:03,181
I served it with a lot of difficulty!
Don't waste anything

1572
01:36:05,534 --> 01:36:07,514
What's your intention, Mr.Aravind T.P?

1573
01:36:08,534 --> 01:36:09,512
Hail Madam!

1574
01:36:10,534 --> 01:36:12,275
Happy Wedding Anniversary, Aunty!

1575
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:15,339
Why all this needlessly?

1576
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:21,510
- Keep it there, Manu ! - Let him take.

1577
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,680
These are for the kids to play, isn't it?

1578
01:36:24,167 --> 01:36:25,669
Even Srini was like this in his childhood!

1579
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:29,307
He was very much interested
in these things..My son!

1580
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,478
One minute.

1581
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:35,306
Hello! Oh, Srini!

1582
01:36:35,701 --> 01:36:37,476
Dad speaking! Are you fine, son?

1583
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,135
Have you booked the tickets?

1584
01:36:39,667 --> 01:36:40,645
When is the arrival?

1585
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:43,305
What? Cancelled!

1586
01:36:44,334 --> 01:36:47,474
Got a new project! No...then don't come!

1587
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:50,704
As your vacation is nearing, I asked.

1588
01:36:51,067 --> 01:36:53,775
Remind him about money!
Not received anything so far!

1589
01:36:54,134 --> 01:36:58,310
There is no emergency here.
You concentrate on your project.

1590
01:36:58,501 --> 01:36:59,775
That's very important.

1591
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,108
When you were small...

1592
01:37:03,134 --> 01:37:07,480
Oh! Time is up? Okay, talk to mom then!

1593
01:37:08,501 --> 01:37:14,110
- Hello Srini...Hello
- Not getting the line!

1594
01:37:15,134 --> 01:37:16,442
Hello Srini!

1595
01:37:19,067 --> 01:37:19,602
Line got cut!

1596
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:26,276
His next assignment
is Nasa Mars Mission Project!

1597
01:37:27,067 --> 01:37:29,206
He is a PhD from llSc Bangalore

1598
01:37:29,634 --> 01:37:32,740
Astrophysics - Very focused!

1599
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:34,609
And hardworking too!

1600
01:37:36,034 --> 01:37:39,743
- But the base he'd got, was from St.Antony's!
- Very good!

1601
01:37:40,301 --> 01:37:42,440
School is very very important

1602
01:37:45,634 --> 01:37:47,238
it's a big achievement.

1603
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,171
In India, how many of them
would've been in this post?

1604
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,408
But, look at her!

1605
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,238
Always.. money.. money.. money!

1606
01:37:55,634 --> 01:37:56,408
Is money more important?

1607
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,170
- Will you get everything for money?

1608
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,045
Will Manu also become like that?

1609
01:38:16,434 --> 01:38:17,037
Like what?

1610
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:18,572
Like that Srini!

1611
01:38:19,734 --> 01:38:21,042
We can't say!

1612
01:38:22,067 --> 01:38:24,570
With great difficulty, they got him educated!

1613
01:38:24,734 --> 01:38:26,577
Doesn't he have time
even to talk to his parents?

1614
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:30,138
When Manu grows up, will he also forget us?

1615
01:38:31,234 --> 01:38:33,373
May or may not!

1616
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,038
We can't sustain our livelihood
depending upon children now!

1617
01:38:38,567 --> 01:38:40,046
See to it that they don't lay their hands on us!

1618
01:38:43,567 --> 01:38:46,207
If everybody studies well
and attain a good position,

1619
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,038
then, who will do the other jobs?

1620
01:38:49,067 --> 01:38:51,047
Can an IAS officer, iron the shin?

1621
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:53,542
Can a Doctor, make a cot?

1622
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,007
So, to do all job; everybody is needed.
That's what I say!

1623
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,177
Gosh! Did I ask for trouble?

1624
01:39:05,034 --> 01:39:07,378
Though illiterate, my mom used to say...

1625
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:11,538
One's hope shouldn't rise high on
seeing his kid or a mango ﬂower!”

1626
01:39:13,567 --> 01:39:14,739
Now the thing is,

1627
01:39:15,134 --> 01:39:18,047
ifs because we have a single plant,
we' re eagerly waiting for its fruit!

1628
01:39:20,201 --> 01:39:21,680
If we have many plants,

1629
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,337
At least one will “Pushpikkum” (blossom), Priya!

1630
01:39:27,534 --> 01:39:28,103
Leave me!

1631
01:39:32,201 --> 01:39:33,976
May be because I mentioned Pushpa's name!

1632
01:39:37,367 --> 01:39:39,074
All my calculations have gone wrong!

1633
01:39:39,767 --> 01:39:42,509
Wham more calculation should
I see now!Damn it!

1634
01:39:57,334 --> 01:39:58,972
That's my Priya!

1635
01:39:59,501 --> 01:40:01,310
So, you understood the facts!

1636
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,138
Wham I said was.

1637
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,473
On seeing this beautiful ﬂower,

1638
01:40:27,733 --> 01:40:29,110
will you forget this wild ﬂower!

1639
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,440
Ugh! Wham are you trying to say?

1640
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,041
You don't have to particularly
tell me about you

1641
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,280
But I didn't say anything, Meenakshi!

1642
01:40:45,134 --> 01:40:46,272
Don't prompt me to use obscene words!

1643
01:40:46,467 --> 01:40:48,276
Why the hell did you call that oldie?

1644
01:40:48,467 --> 01:40:50,674
<i>I'll</i> be peaceful only if she dies!

1645
01:40:51,134 --> 01:40:54,581
Come here, I say! Don't play the fool!

1646
01:40:54,767 --> 01:40:56,110
- Will give the rest there!

1647
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:58,747
Don't give work to my hands!
Bloody Policeman!

1648
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:04,439
She's a poor thing!

1649
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:08,571
When she gets angry,
she will use my toothbrush to clean the toilet,

1650
01:41:09,267 --> 01:41:10,678
and not even tell me about that.

1651
01:41:11,101 --> 01:41:12,444
In that case, tooth-powder will be better!

1652
01:41:13,467 --> 01:41:14,741
Ah!! Yes!

1653
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,740
Congratulations! Please come...come.

1654
01:41:19,767 --> 01:41:21,405
Luckily, I've escaped!

1655
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,671
Amidst such tension also,
how do you manage to stand at the Traffic signal?

1656
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:26,078
Shall we go left?

1657
01:41:32,434 --> 01:41:35,074
Wow! Nice Necklace!

1658
01:41:35,267 --> 01:41:36,075
Thank you, ma'am!

1659
01:41:36,267 --> 01:41:38,247
Okay, when going for an interview,

1660
01:41:38,434 --> 01:41:40,971
do you want everybody to observe
Theresa's diamond necklace,

1661
01:41:41,267 --> 01:41:42,541
or your child?

1662
01:41:43,567 --> 01:41:44,409
<i>That's...ma'am...</i>

1663
01:41:44,734 --> 01:41:47,544
Don't ever go for a school admission
like dressing up for a party!

1664
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:51,045
Your dressing should always
be simple, clean and formal!

1665
01:41:51,667 --> 01:41:53,203
- Not like this - Sorry, ma' am!

1666
01:41:53,434 --> 01:41:53,707
Please!

1667
01:41:59,401 --> 01:42:00,379
Sit comfortably!

1668
01:42:01,734 --> 01:42:03,042
- Ye$ madam! -Yes! Come!

1669
01:42:05,234 --> 01:42:06,372
- Ladies first! - Oh!!

1670
01:42:07,234 --> 01:42:08,508
'May I?- Please!

1671
01:42:09,734 --> 01:42:11,680
Aravind! Nice shin!

1672
01:42:12,634 --> 01:42:13,203
Thank you!

1673
01:42:14,067 --> 01:42:15,205
Multicolour checks!

1674
01:42:16,234 --> 01:42:17,508
Which colour is this? - This...?

1675
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:21,202
Brown!

1676
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,506
- Will Manu be able to tell the colour?

1677
01:42:25,634 --> 01:42:26,203
Won't he say?

1678
01:42:28,701 --> 01:42:32,513
For interviews, plain shins will be the best!

1679
01:42:33,401 --> 01:42:38,180
Wear only solid colours which are
easily identified by our child, okay?

1680
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,770
All of you, please listen carefully!

1681
01:42:42,367 --> 01:42:46,179
You should wear simple,
formal clothes and solid colours!

1682
01:42:46,634 --> 01:42:49,478
Everyone must observe your child and not you!

1683
01:42:50,201 --> 01:42:54,013
- Please keep your mobile in silent mode and
keep it in your pocket! - Sorry, madam!

1684
01:42:56,667 --> 01:43:01,582
Over there, some will come by bike,
some by Toyota, some in BMW

1685
01:43:02,001 --> 01:43:03,344
All these are not important!

1686
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,341
It's not a competition of status!

1687
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,146
Always maintain Eye-contact!

1688
01:43:09,001 --> 01:43:13,472
While talking to someone,
look into their eyes and speak!

1689
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:16,641
That too with integrity and self-confidence!

1690
01:43:18,167 --> 01:43:21,478
Your class ends today! Congratulations!

1691
01:43:22,167 --> 01:43:27,310
Best wishes and Best of luck
to all of you from me and Shining Stars!

1692
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:31,442
Thanks! Thanks to all of you!

1693
01:43:32,334 --> 01:43:33,333
OMG! Time is up!

1694
01:43:33,334 --> 01:43:33,436
OMG! Time is up!

1695
01:43:35,334 --> 01:43:36,972
Whats this? it's getting lame.

1696
01:43:40,634 --> 01:43:42,443
Fold up his shin sleeves!

1697
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,800
Someone sang tenderly
and happily in the ear”

1698
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:03,281
The golden rays will come”

1699
01:44:03,633 --> 01:44:08,776
Hence the darkness will vanish”

1700
01:44:09,134 --> 01:44:11,774
In the ear...in the ear...”

1701
01:44:12,534 --> 01:44:16,778
When the dreams unite
in the shell in the depth of the sea,”

1702
01:44:17,134 --> 01:44:19,580
You will become a dancing pearl”

1703
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:25,339
By the beauty of the spring season,”

1704
01:44:25,534 --> 01:44:28,276
you will sing the song of ﬂowers.”

1705
01:44:28,601 --> 01:44:37,077
In the ear...in the ear...”

1706
01:44:37,267 --> 01:44:38,746
See, what a big school!

1707
01:44:39,267 --> 01:44:39,745
Give me the file

1708
01:44:40,767 --> 01:44:43,748
I've a meeting with IG.
Please call him for the interview.

1709
01:44:44,267 --> 01:44:45,746
I'm sorry, sir. I can't help you.

1710
01:44:46,267 --> 01:44:47,371
I've got an emergency.

1711
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,578
Sorry, sir! it's impossible.

1712
01:44:50,267 --> 01:44:52,543
- Do I' ve to call IG? - it's your wish.

1713
01:44:53,267 --> 01:44:53,745
What happened?

1714
01:44:56,101 --> 01:44:59,378
When will they call?

1715
01:45:01,734 --> 01:45:03,236
I don't know what will happen!

1716
01:45:08,567 --> 01:45:10,706
- Why were you late?
- There was a heavy traffic block!

1717
01:45:17,567 --> 01:45:18,204
Come, dear.

1718
01:45:21,234 --> 01:45:22,474
What the hell did you
teach her all these days?

1719
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:24,338
No a single question
she could answer correctly!

1720
01:45:24,734 --> 01:45:27,544
Dear, answer correctly to whatever ma'am asks!

1721
01:45:28,067 --> 01:45:29,341
Let me go and ask her.

1722
01:45:29,467 --> 01:45:31,344
- I shall also come
- No..Don't come and mess it!

1723
01:45:34,234 --> 01:45:36,043
All of us are waiting here since a long time!

1724
01:45:36,734 --> 01:45:37,678
What did they ask?

1725
01:45:38,067 --> 01:45:40,047
They asked hell a lot of questions!!
I didn't understand anything.

1726
01:45:40,234 --> 01:45:41,679
They want only original certificates!

1727
01:45:42,067 --> 01:45:44,274
- Yes, of course!
- Asked many other things also!

1728
01:45:44,467 --> 01:45:46,447
I didn't face such a difficulty in any other school!

1729
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:51,207
- Don't worry, <i>I'll</i> talk to IG!
- As if! Sit down quietly.

1730
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:52,678
Have you taken everything?

1731
01:45:58,201 --> 01:46:00,181
O Lord! Hope everything goes well!

1732
01:46:03,467 --> 01:46:04,502
You remember everything, don't you?

1733
01:46:10,201 --> 01:46:11,179
Son! Get up!

1734
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:15,469
Oh! I'm sorry!

1735
01:46:20,434 --> 01:46:21,003
May I..

1736
01:46:22,201 --> 01:46:23,646
Good morning!

1737
01:46:25,034 --> 01:46:25,637
Oh my God!

1738
01:46:27,201 --> 01:46:27,975
Dad!

1739
01:46:28,667 --> 01:46:29,304
Take your seat.

1740
01:46:30,201 --> 01:46:30,474
Sit!

1741
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,645
- Good morning! - Good morning!

1742
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:36,478
Sorry!

1743
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:38,645
- Sorry... - it's okay!

1744
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:42,274
What's your name?

1745
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:45,140
My name is Aswin Aravind!

1746
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:47,372
Very good! So, what is your father's name?

1747
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:52,138
My Father's name is Mr.Aravind T P!

1748
01:46:52,467 --> 01:46:53,639
Who is your best friend?

1749
01:46:54,167 --> 01:46:55,145
My grandpa!

1750
01:46:55,467 --> 01:46:57,276
- Say it in English! - Grandfather!

1751
01:46:57,467 --> 01:46:59,970
You can also talk in Malayalam! No issues, 0k?

1752
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:04,147
Ashwin, Who's that who has
come along with your father?

1753
01:47:04,634 --> 01:47:05,135
<i>'Tag
mg'</i>

1754
01:47:06,167 --> 01:47:07,771
Who else has come with you?

1755
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:09,441
My mother!

1756
01:47:10,167 --> 01:47:11,771
We will talk about relationship!

1757
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:15,109
Haven't you taught him about it?

1758
01:47:16,401 --> 01:47:17,607
Who is grandpa to you?

1759
01:47:18,134 --> 01:47:18,771
My friend!

1760
01:47:19,134 --> 01:47:20,112
Only a friend?

1761
01:47:20,467 --> 01:47:21,605
- No - Then?

1762
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,438
My best friend!

1763
01:47:24,134 --> 01:47:26,114
Your father is your grandpa's - ?

1764
01:47:31,634 --> 01:47:34,114
- Is grandpa your mother's father? - Yes

1765
01:47:34,634 --> 01:47:36,113
Who is your father to your mother?

1766
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:40,111
- Aravindettan! - Aravindettan?!

1767
01:47:40,601 --> 01:47:44,242
Mom, you call dad
as Aravindettan at home, right?

1768
01:47:44,767 --> 01:47:47,748
You never taught him anything
about relationships right?

1769
01:47:49,134 --> 01:47:51,410
No! Moreover, we have no relatives
who can be called good!

1770
01:47:52,434 --> 01:47:54,573
That's ok! Please sit down

1771
01:47:55,767 --> 01:47:57,337
Why do you like your grandpa so much?

1772
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,739
I will row boat with grandpa,

1773
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:05,209
see ducks.cows..ride in the bullock can

1774
01:48:05,434 --> 01:48:06,139
and throw the bait.

1775
01:48:06,334 --> 01:48:06,744
Ban?

1776
01:48:07,101 --> 01:48:10,742
When it is sunny, we shouldn't throw
the bait, othenlvise fish will get burnt!

1777
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,742
If we knead the dough and dip it in
our fingers, fish will jump to bite it.

1778
01:48:16,101 --> 01:48:17,546
Fish is greedy, right?

1779
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:22,075
Can you tell us a story, Ashwin?

1780
01:48:22,234 --> 01:48:23,212
Hidimbi's story!

1781
01:48:23,767 --> 01:48:24,541
A Demon!..

1782
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:29,206
- Ma' am, file.
- It's ok, Mr.Aravind!We'll collect it at the end.

1783
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:30,539
Please sit patiently

1784
01:48:30,734 --> 01:48:33,214
Once upon a time,
there was a demon in the forest.

1785
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,209
That demon's name was Hidimbi!

1786
01:48:35,734 --> 01:48:37,714
She's as tall as the tree...!

1787
01:48:38,067 --> 01:48:40,047
Rock like face...!

1788
01:48:40,234 --> 01:48:43,044
Her eyes are as red as a tomato!

1789
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:46,272
Her teeth are as long as Elephant's tusk!

1790
01:48:46,567 --> 01:48:49,343
Tongue is long like plantain leaf!

1791
01:48:49,734 --> 01:48:54,342
And ears as big as winnows!

1792
01:48:54,734 --> 01:48:58,181
For 10 days, Hidimbi didn't eat anything!

1793
01:48:58,367 --> 01:49:02,713
At that time,
Demon saw 5 persons sleeping over there.

1794
01:49:03,067 --> 01:49:03,511
Who are they?

1795
01:49:03,734 --> 01:49:05,111
Those are Pandavas!

1796
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:09,112
Hidimbi began to drool on seeing them

1797
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:13,112
and thought she would
have an enjoyable night!

1798
01:49:13,301 --> 01:49:14,177
Then, what did Hidimbi do?

1799
01:49:14,367 --> 01:49:19,009
Being a demon,
she gradually went closer to them

1800
01:49:19,367 --> 01:49:23,509
Extended her sharp nails, goggled her eyes,

1801
01:49:24,034 --> 01:49:26,139
spread her long ears,

1802
01:49:26,534 --> 01:49:32,678
gradually, pace by pace..went closer to them.

1803
01:49:33,034 --> 01:49:34,411
Enough, Ashwin!

1804
01:49:35,034 --> 01:49:36,411
Who told you this story?

1805
01:49:36,701 --> 01:49:37,475
Grandma!

1806
01:49:38,334 --> 01:49:41,144
Okay! Submit the documents outside!

1807
01:49:41,334 --> 01:49:44,008
Admission results will be declared next week.

1808
01:49:44,334 --> 01:49:45,005
Do we've to come here and check the results?

1809
01:49:46,267 --> 01:49:47,644
No...No...That's not necessary.

1810
01:49:48,034 --> 01:49:51,311
We will let you know when ifs ready.
And we have our own procedures

1811
01:49:52,501 --> 01:49:53,070
Documents!

1812
01:49:53,267 --> 01:49:55,645
- Give it outside. - 0k, madam!

1813
01:49:59,267 --> 01:50:00,644
- This is for you! - Thank you

1814
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:05,644
- Bye, see you, ta-ta - Thank you!

1815
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:12,113
What all had I taught him!
Plants, Animal; Birds.

1816
01:50:12,501 --> 01:50:14,981
It was all a waste!

1817
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,974
Fully pre-planned!

1818
01:50:19,301 --> 01:50:23,977
No matter what will be the consequences!
But <i>I'll</i> not put up my son in a normal school!

1819
01:50:25,001 --> 01:50:25,604
That's for sure!

1820
01:50:27,634 --> 01:50:29,978
For others, documents were collected inside, is it?

1821
01:50:30,168 --> 01:50:31,272
I don't remember anything!

1822
01:50:32,234 --> 01:50:35,613
I saw them collecting
Theresa's and others certificates inside.

1823
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,108
And only our's, outside!!

1824
01:50:38,467 --> 01:50:39,605
Are you happy now?

1825
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:42,076
You happily go
and bait fish along with grandpa

1826
01:50:42,801 --> 01:50:43,609
You will become a good fisherman!

1827
01:50:43,801 --> 01:50:45,610
Come on, Priya! What was his mistake?

1828
01:50:51,034 --> 01:50:53,480
Oh my God! Hi, Priya! - Noora!

1829
01:50:53,667 --> 01:50:56,147
-It's been a long time since we met!
Are you fine? - I do!

1830
01:50:56,334 --> 01:50:59,110
- This is my shop! - Really? I didn't know.

1831
01:50:59,334 --> 01:51:01,245
- Is your husband fine?
- All are fine!

1832
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,413
- Did Manu receive any letter? - What letter?

1833
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,104
Letter from St.Antony's!

1834
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:07,478
No!!

1835
01:51:07,667 --> 01:51:09,647
Why didn't you alone get it?

1836
01:51:11,134 --> 01:51:12,636
We'd got it yesterday. Even Jenny got it.

1837
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,971
So I thought you also got it,
and you have come to celebrate it with your son!

1838
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:19,444
No!

1839
01:51:21,234 --> 01:51:25,205
Don't worry! It must be a postal delay.

1840
01:51:25,467 --> 01:51:27,606
Manu will definitely get through!!
He's a smart boy!

1841
01:51:29,001 --> 01:51:29,979
Hope so!

1842
01:51:37,634 --> 01:51:40,444
Mom, can you put on the battery for me?

1843
01:51:40,801 --> 01:51:41,438
Tell dad when he comes.

1844
01:51:41,634 --> 01:51:42,612
Please mom..

1845
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:43,778
Get away, Manu!

1846
01:51:57,201 --> 01:51:58,771
What did they say
when you called up the School?

1847
01:51:59,434 --> 01:52:01,778
Seems letters have been sent
to all children who got admission!

1848
01:52:02,267 --> 01:52:05,077
And if you haven't got it,
then it means your child has not got admission!

1849
01:52:05,267 --> 01:52:07,178
Did they send letters to all?

1850
01:52:07,434 --> 01:52:09,243
Letters have been sent
to those who have passed!

1851
01:52:09,601 --> 01:52:12,081
May be they would've sent it batch wise!

1852
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:13,575
No! They dispatched it together!

1853
01:52:13,767 --> 01:52:15,747
Don't you understand what I say?

1854
01:52:16,201 --> 01:52:17,236
Hey! Take off your hand!

1855
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:18,735
May I...?

1856
01:52:19,267 --> 01:52:22,043
Damn it! Always say May I !

1857
01:52:22,267 --> 01:52:23,405
Only that you have not forgotten!

1858
01:52:24,067 --> 01:52:27,048
Do you remember how you slammed the door
while getting in for interview?

1859
01:52:28,601 --> 01:52:30,581
They would've lost
the impression at that time itself.

1860
01:52:31,434 --> 01:52:33,414
Then, you slipped the paper and file down!

1861
01:52:34,768 --> 01:52:37,749
I'm sure that was the cause for it.

1862
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,738
WW I! happens only to us?

1863
01:52:44,167 --> 01:52:47,376
- So, his name is not in the final list also!
- Yes!!

1864
01:52:47,568 --> 01:52:49,047
Then, it will be difficult

1865
01:52:49,234 --> 01:52:51,373
Something can happen
only if extra-push is given.

1866
01:52:51,567 --> 01:52:53,706
That means, if you give money,
it can happen Got it?

1867
01:52:55,734 --> 01:52:59,546
As there is no other option,
I shall somehow arrange it.

1868
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,708
His admission is important.

1869
01:53:03,034 --> 01:53:07,540
No matter however much it is,
please get his admission done!

1870
01:53:08,567 --> 01:53:10,012
Okay! <i>I'll</i> take care

1871
01:53:10,567 --> 01:53:13,377
What's this, Pushpa?
You come at 10 and leave by 11,

1872
01:53:13,567 --> 01:53:15,171
and I need to attend to all the chores!

1873
01:53:21,134 --> 01:53:24,343
We got a letter today.
Alice has got admission in St.Antony's!

1874
01:53:24,734 --> 01:53:26,270
God is always with us!

1875
01:53:26,534 --> 01:53:28,013
I was after this for a long time!

1876
01:53:28,534 --> 01:53:32,505
Doesn't matter! Now Alice's future is safe!

1877
01:53:34,367 --> 01:53:36,506
Congratulations! All the Best!

1878
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:37,678
Thank you, Priya!

1879
01:53:47,534 --> 01:53:49,980
No, Aravind! Even if you calculate
the value of this full stock,

1880
01:53:50,167 --> 01:53:51,669
You won't get the price you expect!

1881
01:53:53,101 --> 01:53:54,512
Either sell this shop,

1882
01:53:55,167 --> 01:53:56,237
or mortgage it!

1883
01:53:56,534 --> 01:53:58,138
I don't find any other options in this!

1884
01:54:00,534 --> 01:54:01,672
Bro, give me this 2nd medicine.

1885
01:54:02,334 --> 01:54:02,971
Shop is closed!

1886
01:54:03,334 --> 01:54:04,972
-It's an emergency! - Shop is closed!

1887
01:54:05,167 --> 01:54:07,306
- Please. Please
- Didn't I say that the shop is closed!

1888
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:08,672
Then, shutter it and get away!

1889
01:54:12,667 --> 01:54:13,304
I will sell this shop!

1890
01:54:17,667 --> 01:54:19,078
I've been calling you for a long time!

1891
01:54:19,334 --> 01:54:19,778
What's it, madam?

1892
01:54:20,334 --> 01:54:22,473
Tell Aravindettan that
we've gone to meet Deepika madam!

1893
01:54:22,667 --> 01:54:24,305
- Meeting whom? - Deepika madam!

1894
01:54:25,667 --> 01:54:28,477
Come...Come I say.

1895
01:54:28,668 --> 01:54:31,114
- Mom! My leg...
- Nothing is wrong with your leg! Come!

1896
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:44,779
Walk fast!

1897
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:02,439
Both of them have gone to meet Deepika madam

1898
01:55:16,468 --> 01:55:17,446
Walk fast!

1899
01:55:24,634 --> 01:55:28,605
- Mom, my leg really pains!
- Will you keep quiet and come?

1900
01:55:29,034 --> 01:55:30,069
You are the only reason for all this!

1901
01:55:31,267 --> 01:55:33,008
Please walk slowly, mom!

1902
01:55:33,267 --> 01:55:34,575
Don't provoke my anger needlessly!

1903
01:55:40,601 --> 01:55:43,411
Everyone has got through! Everybody!!

1904
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:46,578
Except him!!

1905
01:55:49,267 --> 01:55:50,405
We lost again.

1906
01:55:52,067 --> 01:55:53,410
All others have won!

1907
01:55:53,734 --> 01:55:54,405
All others!!

1908
01:55:54,734 --> 01:55:56,407
Priya, sit down...

1909
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:58,412
Why it happens only to me?

1910
01:55:59,234 --> 01:56:02,374
You go and play there

1911
01:56:07,067 --> 01:56:08,569
Jenny's son has got through!

1912
01:56:09,067 --> 01:56:11,980
Theresa, Mili...all of them got through!

1913
01:56:12,234 --> 01:56:14,214
Only my son didn't get through!

1914
01:56:16,001 --> 01:56:17,674
Listen to me.

1915
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:24,043
See, this is not anybody's fault!
Don't ever say that you've lost!

1916
01:56:24,567 --> 01:56:25,671
Don't have such a thought also.

1917
01:56:26,401 --> 01:56:28,677
You tried your best!

1918
01:56:29,034 --> 01:56:30,012
And Manu also did it!

1919
01:56:31,801 --> 01:56:34,179
Didn't we try maximum? isn't that enough?

1920
01:56:34,567 --> 01:56:38,674
I struggled a lot for this!
You are not aware of it.

1921
01:56:39,567 --> 01:56:40,341
And still"?

1922
01:56:43,034 --> 01:56:44,172
Mom...are you crying?

1923
01:56:44,368 --> 01:56:46,348
Manu, shut up and sit there.

1924
01:56:47,201 --> 01:56:51,013
Hey Priya! Whats all this?

1925
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,338
What did he do?

1926
01:56:53,534 --> 01:56:56,640
Children also have wishes of their own.

1927
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,180
But I wished only for this!

1928
01:57:00,367 --> 01:57:02,506
Instead of imposing our wishes upon them

1929
01:57:02,767 --> 01:57:07,307
parents must find out their
wishes and fulfill it, right?

1930
01:57:08,767 --> 01:57:10,178
Let them be what they want to become!

1931
01:57:10,368 --> 01:57:11,745
Let them do what they want to do!

1932
01:57:12,167 --> 01:57:14,340
Let them ﬂy, Priya!

1933
01:57:15,167 --> 01:57:16,976
Madam can you please come?

1934
01:57:17,767 --> 01:57:20,145
Priya, don't go! Manu, I will be back now.

1935
01:57:23,334 --> 01:57:23,971
Dear!

1936
01:57:29,767 --> 01:57:32,304
Priya, just 5 minutes! Sorry!

1937
01:57:48,167 --> 01:57:48,770
Sorry, Priya!

1938
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,780
MY son", Arjun!

1939
01:57:58,734 --> 01:58:00,771
He's in this condition
for the last 5 yrs!

1940
01:58:02,734 --> 01:58:04,111
Arjun, <i>I'll</i> be back now.

1941
01:58:06,134 --> 01:58:09,604
He's been lying down after relieving himself!

1942
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:12,109
He feels very much embarrassed
during such times!

1943
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,279
- Will never let the nurse near him!

1944
01:58:16,301 --> 01:58:17,575
I was also like you!

1945
01:58:18,134 --> 01:58:19,442
Wished to put him in the best school".

1946
01:58:20,134 --> 01:58:21,579
...Give him the best education

1947
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,279
and to get him admitted in llT.

1948
01:58:24,134 --> 01:58:26,580
Since childhood, he was
interested in swimming

1949
01:58:28,134 --> 01:58:31,274
But when he grew, I myself discouraged him

1950
01:58:31,467 --> 01:58:33,572
I informed the school
and took him away from the team!

1951
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:37,445
Would anything happen to him
if he goes for swimming was my fear!

1952
01:58:38,101 --> 01:58:41,571
IIT Coaching, School Tuition, Vacation classes.

1953
01:58:41,767 --> 01:58:44,077
Both of us pushed him for everything.

1954
01:58:44,767 --> 01:58:48,237
I couldn't tolerate him coming
2nd in any subject.

1955
01:58:48,434 --> 01:58:49,742
That too in the school I teach!

1956
01:58:50,767 --> 01:58:53,247
At last, my son..

1957
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:57,081
He must have got fed up of everything.

1958
01:58:58,100 --> 01:58:59,545
Because we pressurized him to that extent!

1959
01:59:01,267 --> 01:59:02,405
That's why he did like that!

1960
01:59:03,734 --> 01:59:08,410
From the 3rd ﬂoor of the School building...

1961
01:59:15,667 --> 01:59:17,408
I'm sorry! Sorry, Priya!

1962
01:59:18,267 --> 01:59:19,041
Where is Manu?

1963
01:59:24,234 --> 01:59:24,712
Where?

1964
01:59:37,734 --> 01:59:38,371
He's not here

1965
01:59:38,667 --> 01:59:40,203
Madam, a child is going up!

1966
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,139
Dad! See “Mazhavil” there!

1967
02:01:25,001 --> 02:01:27,106
Mom, I know what is
Mazhavil called in English?

1968
02:01:27,567 --> 02:01:30,446
Rainbow! R-A-I-N-B..

1969
02:01:31,301 --> 02:01:32,780
It is enough if you say Mazhavil, dear!

1970
02:01:36,134 --> 02:01:38,410
He got admission in St.Antony's!

1971
02:01:38,967 --> 02:01:40,002
That too on merit!

1972
02:01:41,634 --> 02:01:43,272
They said our son is smart

1973
02:01:47,134 --> 02:01:48,112
Sorry dear!

1974
02:01:49,134 --> 02:01:50,272
He got admission!

1975
02:01:51,767 --> 02:01:53,405
Principal personally called up and said.

1976
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:57,574
I'm very delighted, madam!

1977
02:01:59,101 --> 02:02:01,411
Priya, didn't I tell you? He's really smart!

1978
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:06,411
Not only him, all children are smart!

1979
02:02:11,267 --> 02:02:13,247
They said he has also
got scholarship etc..

1980
02:02:13,601 --> 02:02:15,581
I couldn't understand anything.
It was fully in English!

1981
02:02:22,501 --> 02:02:22,535
Oh mom! We are getting wet!

1982
02:02:24,567 --> 02:02:26,547
Let him get wet! Come on, get drenched!

1983
02:02:28,767 --> 02:02:30,075
You are dad's son!!
