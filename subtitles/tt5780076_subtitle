00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,839
<b>'A DDR Release..'</b>

2
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,040
'Greetings!
I'm Ababa alias Gajanan.'

3
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,600
'This is my hometown, Wai.'

4
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
'It is located
off Mumbai-Pune express'

5
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,360
'on the way to Mahabaleshwar.'

6
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,920
'Quite many film shoots
take place here.'

7
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
'The incredible thing about Wai is
that it can seem like any place.'

8
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,240
'One can say it is Uttar Pradesh
or Punjab or Kerala.'

9
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,320
'Once they also tried to
depict it as Switzerland.'

10
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
'But they couldn't make it snow.'

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
'This is my favourite place
in Wai.'

12
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,920
'Collect the offerings here.'

13
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,040
So Ababa,
when will you distribute sweets?

14
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,280
Take this.
- Not as offertory.

15
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
I mean, sweets to celebrate
your wedding.

16
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,800
I'll take your leave.

17
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,240
You should always make a vow
to visit the temple again.

18
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,640
Sure.
- Okay, see you.

19
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,680
'The whole town of Wait
needs answers to two questions.'

20
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,720
'When would we have
all day water supply'

21
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,160
'and when will I marry.'

22
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,960
'Goof ups are an integral part
of my life.'

23
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
'For example, when I deck up nicely
and it gets stained.'

24
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,280
'The tap runs out of water
when I want to take a shower.'

25
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,840
'If I like a girl'

26
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,440
'she turns out to be married
with a kid.'

27
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,080
'Never mind.
This is my college.'

28
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,640
'Me and Baban
enrolled here together.'

29
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,600
'But today he holds
more importance than me.'

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,680
Baban, eat this.
Why is he not eating?

31
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,600
'I've a history with this place.'

32
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,120
'I mean, I teach
the subject 'History' here'

33
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,960
'but no one is interested
in learning it.'

34
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,640
'No one would even
attend my class.'

35
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,360
'People hardly seem to notice me.'

36
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,560
'But I don't care.
I lash out in retaliation.'

37
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,840
Mr. Kulkarni, are you done?

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Y-Yes.

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,640
'I'm 33 years old now.'

40
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,920
'I was young once too.'

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,160
'I had tried to be
a ladies' man too.'

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
'I tried wearing stylish clothes.'

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,280
'I rode motorbikes.'

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
'I sprayed on deodorant as well.'

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,320
'Then I realised, those clothes
only looked good on mannequins.'

46
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,600
'And riding bikes couldn't
highlight my cool quotient.'

47
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,640
'And deodorants attract girls
only in commercials.'

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,120
'In short,
how much ever you fantasize'

49
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,240
'some things are
just not meant for you.'

50
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,240
Ladies and gentlemen..

51
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,920
This is Mr. Gajanan Kulkarni.

52
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
He is 26 years old.

53
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,440
He is not even that old.

54
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,800
He is here with his mother.

55
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
He earns Rs. 12,000 per month

56
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,600
and his job is temporary.

57
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,200
He doesn't own a four wheeler.

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,640
Is anyone interested?

59
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
No one?

60
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,960
Mr. Kulkarni, you may step down.
- 'According to Ms. Baby'

61
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,880
'my name is old school.'
- Next!

62
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,560
'I had no choice.
During my naming ceremony'

63
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,720
'the names suggested were Lambodar,
Vakratund and Shoopakarna.'

64
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,480
'But by God's grace
my aunt from Pune chose this name'

65
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
'and I was named Gajanan.'

66
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
He is Mr. Gajanan Kulkarni.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Age, 31 years old.

68
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,960
Salary, Rs. 20,000.

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,200
Temporary job..

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
I'll step down.
- And..

71
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,640
'Our life is like a kite.'
- Come on.

72
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,000
'During childhood, our expectations
reach high in the sky.'

73
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,040
'But as we grow up, when we realise
that we're past a certain age'

74
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,480
'our life settles down
at a certain level.'

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,560
'The same happened to me.'

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
'I've always been lonely'

77
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,440
'in this town of Wai.'

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,440
Sir..

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,200
Sir, did you ask for me?

80
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Mr. Kulkarni, please come in.

81
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,760
Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

82
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,000
Sir, congratulations!

83
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,760
You won an award for your play.
- Thank you! Thank you!

84
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Mr. Kulkarni, this is for you.

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Is this an extra one?
- No! No! No!

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,680
You have earned this.

87
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,160
Sir, is it my send-off today?

88
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
In a way,
you can call this your send-off.

89
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,040
Mr. Kulkarni, I know
where you would be travelling to.

90
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Finally, Machu Picchu.
- What!

91
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,920
Mr. Kulkarni, you have to move
to Pune for six months.

92
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Sir, I agree

93
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,760
that you do not like
the way I teach.

94
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm okay if you sack me,
but Pune..

95
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,200
Are you scared?

96
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,440
Then you must go.

97
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
Mr. Kulkarni..

98
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,160
I've been a part of plays
since 30 years

99
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,560
in Wai.

100
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,600
I've acted for some films too.

101
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,600
You must have seen those.
- Y-Yes!

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,200
You are a good actor indeed.

103
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,360
People say, I should have
tried my luck in cities back then.

104
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
I would have rocked the theatres.

105
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
But before taking a step forward
I chickened out.

106
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,520
I trembled before plunging.

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
Today I feel, I should have
grabbed the opportunity.

108
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,400
One fine day,
in the Pune college campus

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,160
two professors
bumped into each other.

110
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,160
The chalks in their hands fell off.

111
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
While picking those up

112
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
they fell in love and got married.

113
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,080
Both of them quit their jobs.

114
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,280
Their positions were vacated.

115
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,680
Arose a question of
who would take over?

116
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,920
I suggested your name.

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,320
Everyone got stunned.

118
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,920
The verdict is out.

119
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,640
This Friday,
you will have to march.

120
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,960
Mr. Kulkarni,
this is a rare opportunity.

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,840
Go and grab it.

122
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
Take the plunge!

123
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,560
"A child misses its mother.."

124
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,560
"A child misses its mother"

125
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,760
"and looks on confused"

126
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,400
"like a fish out of water."

127
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,280
'Staying all alone in Pune!'

128
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,280
"A child.." - 'I feel like
I'm appearing the 10th grade exam.'

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,720
'I had to accept this offer
with a heavy heart.'

130
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,680
'One good thing is,
my aunt stays in Pune.'

131
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,240
'Also, my childhood friend
moved to the city 20 years ago.'

132
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,120
'Your smile is really cute.
- Yours too.'

133
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,560
'Sayali.'
- "This longing.."

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,880
'This is the real test'

135
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,880
'and I'll be all on my own.'

136
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,120
"O' Lord Krishna,
You are the dearest entertainer."

137
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,800
"O' Lord Krishna,
You are the dearest entertainer."

138
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,360
"O' Lord Krishna,
You are the dearest entertainer."

139
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,960
"You are the dearest entertainer."

140
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,520
"As a newlywed bride
enters her in-laws' home.."

141
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,880
"As a newlywed bride
enters her in-laws' home"

142
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,600
"she never looks back."

143
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,760
"Even my plight is the same."

144
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
"When will I get to behold You,
Lord Krishna."

145
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,280
"O' Lord Krishna,
You are the dearest entertainer."

146
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,360
"O' Lord Krishna,
You are the dearest entertainer."

147
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,000
"My distant mind.."

148
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,520
"My distant mind
is like the deep river."

149
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,440
"My distant mind
is like the deep river."

150
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,840
"It hides in its depths
and smiles upon itself."

151
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,320
"It plays naughtily
and runs far."

152
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,280
"Go to a new land."

153
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,120
"Go to a new land."

154
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,760
"This sky seems to smile."

155
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,600
"The banks of the river
seem to frown."

156
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,600
"Empty people,
empty bonds."

157
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,280
"All the directions
seem to washed away."

158
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,000
Sir, please sit at the centre.
The rickshaw is tilting.

159
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,080
Is this fine?
- Okay.

160
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,920
'This was the first sentence
that I got to hear in Pune.'

161
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,520
'Sir, please sit at the centre.
The rickshaw is tilting.'

162
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,960
'I don't think I'll stay in Pune
more than eight days.'

163
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,840
"O' Lord Krishna,
You are the dearest entertainer."

164
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,240
Aunt!
- Yes.

165
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,080
Hey, Gajanan!

166
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,320
How are you?
- I'm good.

167
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,280
You have grown up.

168
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,400
Bless me.
- Live long and prosper.

169
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,040
Hey! - Hey, this is Aarti!
- Oh! Sorry.

170
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,840
You two catch up.
I'll get some water.

171
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,680
Hello, Aarti!
- Hi!

172
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
How are you?
- I'm good!

173
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
Okay.
- How long is your stay?

174
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,680
Aarti, show him to
your brother's room!

175
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,520
Thank you.

176
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,040
So, Ababa..
- Yes.

177
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,680
Are you ready?
- Yes.

178
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,320
Today is your first day
at the college, right?

179
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,760
But how are you planning to travel?

180
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,480
How do I travel?

181
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,560
Aarti, drop him to the college.

182
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm already running late.

183
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
Drop him!

184
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,920
You should ride a little slower.

185
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,960
You ride so fast!
There's so much of traffic around.

186
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,720
What?
- Nothing.

187
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,920
And the brakes are loose,
so, ride it slowly.

188
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Brother, from tomorrow
please use mom's scooter.

189
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
Because I need mine.
- Sorry.

190
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
Okay, bye.

191
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,160
Hey! Can't you see?
- Hold on.. - Hey!

192
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,840
Where do you want to go?

193
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,600
I-I'm Mr. Kulkarni, from Wai.
- What?

194
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,640
I'm the History teacher.

195
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,840
Where is the collage?
- It's to your right.

196
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,440
I'm new to this place.
- Okay, go on.

197
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,200
Hey! Watch your step!
- Sorry.

198
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
"One, two, three, four.."

199
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,800
"Come on!"

200
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,960
"One, two, three, four..
Come on."

201
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,760
I'll miss you. I love you.
- Where should we go? - KFC.

202
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,440
KFC is best. - McDonalds?
- Are you sure we'll skip class?

203
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,720
Yes, History is so darn boring.

204
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,240
Who's our new History professor?
- Some Gajanan Kulkarni.

205
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
Gajanan?

206
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,560
Did you meet him?
- He was such an antique piece.

207
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,680
Chunky, how are you?

208
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,480
Pakya, your dad's here!

209
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,520
I'm Mr. Kulkarni, from Wai.
- Hey, man!

210
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,880
H-History..

211
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,480
Let me take a selfie.

212
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,520
Look at this..
- I'm telling you..

213
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,360
Who's dad is he?
- Who is standing in our class?

214
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Excuse me..

215
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,200
Today is the date.

216
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,360
I'm Professor Kulkarni, from Wai.

217
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,560
The Principal asked me
to come here

218
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,160
and conduct History lectures.

219
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,320
So, let's start with some History.

220
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,440
We've to sit through this!
It's so boring.

221
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,960
Come on!
- Let's pretend to pay attention.

222
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,520
Which chapter have you reached?

223
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
We don't know.
Decide it for yourself.

224
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,440
Nice!
I liked it.

225
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,760
I was exactly like this
when I was your age.

226
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,680
Oh, really?

227
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,440
'Social reformers of Maharashtra'
was the topic, sir. - Yes.

228
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,120
'Social reformers of Maharashtra.'

229
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
What is this?
- Oh, God!

230
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,480
He'll teach everything
to the board.

231
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,920
Dropped it!

232
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,240
What is he doing?
- Today we are going to learn..

233
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,920
What? - Hey!
- ...about Jagannath Shankar Seth.

234
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,640
I'll treat you.
- He was known as

235
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,600
the sculptor of modern Mumbai.

236
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,080
Hold on.. - Look at him.
- He has aced languages like

237
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,840
English, Hindi and Sanskrit.
- Why did he take a photo?

238
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,200
I own an estate..
- You might know

239
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,160
that a teacher's award is named
after him. - Look.. - What?

240
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,160
No! - We don't know.
- Whatever..

241
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,400
He was also addressed as Nana..

242
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,720
Your phone.. - Hello!
No, I'm attending a lecture.

243
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,800
Okay, great!

244
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
Yes, on my way.
Okay.

245
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,360
Sir, I've got dance rehearsals.

246
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,160
It was my choreographer.
May I leave?

247
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,080
We should leave too..
- Yes, I'm coming.

248
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Okay, yes.
- Battees, call me too.

249
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,400
She left!
- You may go if you wish.

250
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,560
The facts that I'm telling you

251
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,400
can't be found in any text books.

252
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,240
Make a note of it.
- Hello! Yes, Battees. Where?

253
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,920
I'll be there in five munities.

254
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,920
Come on, turn to page number 23.

255
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
Jagannath Shankar Seth.

256
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,560
Wake him up.
This lecture has come to an end.

257
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,880
'What a joke?'

258
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,520
'What will he teach us?'

259
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,880
'Joker!'

260
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,400
Hey! What's wrong?

261
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,080
Peon, are you done cleaning?

262
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,920
Peon?
Who is the peon?

263
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,800
What were you doing here?

264
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,480
Research.
Aren't you the peon?

265
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,640
Do you know him?
- No.

266
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,320
I don't know anyone this old.

267
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,800
What's going on here?

268
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,960
Okay, listen.. - Both of you,
let's go to principal's office.

269
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
Do you know what this is?

270
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,280
This is a toilet.

271
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,600
Hey, read the sign.
This is the ladies' toilet.

272
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
Ma'am, sorry.

273
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,960
It was my mistake.
- It's okay.

274
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,960
Next time, be careful, okay?
- Yes.

275
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,400
What?
- Okay!

276
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,960
Let's go, Sweetie.
Buy, fool!

277
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,160
Doesn't he look like a fool?

278
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,960
'Shamsundar Parijatak.'

279
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,320
Yes, Aunt.
I'm in the ladies' toilet.

280
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
Nothing.
W-What is it?

281
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,720
Where?

282
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,640
To meet whom?

283
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,480
Hi!
I'm Mona Mahabaleshwarkar.

284
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,040
Greetings! - I got your reference
from Ms. Baby's matrimony office.

285
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,680
Okay. I'm Gajanan Kulkarni,
from Wai.

286
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,920
So, tell me your hobbies.

287
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,640
Gents first.
- What?

288
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,960
Oh!
Okay.

289
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,840
Reading, writing
and listening to many songs.

290
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
Singing too!
I mean, bathroom singing!

291
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,960
Ali, pay attention once more..

292
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,720
Yours?
- I don't have hobbies.

293
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,760
I have passions.

294
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Horse riding, river rafting,
bungee jumping and kayaking.

295
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,800
I have my own
adventure sports company too.

296
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,120
Company?

297
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,200
Mona's Plans Private Limited.

298
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,840
Mona's plans!

299
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,200
'Smoking/Tobacco kills.'

300
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,840
'Mona darling!'

301
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,200
'Where is the gold
according to the plan?'

302
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,160
Ma'am, I phase out at times..

303
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,840
Ma'am, it's my problem.
Ma'am..

304
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Ma'am..

305
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,120
"You are my everything."
- Here, your 'Chutney Sandwich'.

306
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
Hey, we have to order ice cream.

307
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,200
Here's your 'Idli and Chutney'.

308
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,600
I'm okay if you pay.
- You see..

309
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,240
My friend is a waiter here.

310
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,640
He has hurt his leg.

311
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,760
He has been serving us
since four years.

312
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
So, I offered to help him today.

313
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,000
Enjoy!

314
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,080
We'll pitch in.
- It's your treat. That's final.

315
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,520
In our canteen we do..
- Guys!

316
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,680
Your sandwich.
- Yes. Thank you.

317
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,640
Get four SVDP.
- Tell him, he'll get it.

318
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,400
Pal, are you done
with your research?

319
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,080
Detailed one!
- Really!

320
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,400
32 percent taps are leaky
in our college.

321
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,400
820 liters of water
are wasted daily. - 820!

322
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,000
How much?
- 820?

323
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,880
It's a havoc in ladies' toilet.
- Is it?

324
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,600
Girls are wasting water
without control.

325
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,280
What? - Hope you two
weren't doing something else.

326
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,280
Why would he make up stories?

327
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,680
What do you mean?

328
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,400
Check for yourself.

329
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,400
Go on. - Yes.
- Go ahead. - Check it.

330
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,960
Do it. - Go on..
- Check it. - Yes.

331
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,000
What is this?
- Pal, when we were inside

332
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,640
we were almost caught.
- What?

333
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,280
Some fool was standing right there.

334
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Fool?
- Yes.

335
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,920
He looked exactly like him.

336
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,360
True.
He looks decent.

337
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,640
He can't be the same.

338
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,880
Never mind..
It was him.

339
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,120
What happened next?

340
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,360
No, he is a decent boy.

341
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay.
No..

342
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,800
That's true.
Alas, we couldn't finalise it.

343
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,280
Okay..

344
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,240
Okay, I'll hang up.

345
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
Okay!
Hang up now!

346
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,480
Strange people.

347
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,240
Why are you upset?
She wasn't worth you.

348
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Her father is a raging alcoholic.

349
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,120
I'll look for a girl in a month
and get you married.

350
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Where did you get lost?

351
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,360
He called you names
in front of your friends!

352
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
Buy tranquilizers from the market.

353
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,040
What now?
Tranquiliser.

354
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,480
Add two spoonfuls
into some 'Sheera'

355
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,760
and place two cups
in two corners of the house.

356
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,760
By morning, either your dad,
or that rat would be lying fainted.

357
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,120
How dare he insult you!

358
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,280
I'll hang up!

359
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,840
Come on, pass it to her!

360
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,960
Pass it to her.
Aarti, pass it to her.

361
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,120
Come on.
Good! Score a basket!

362
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,680
Nice basket!

363
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,880
It was a beautiful score!

364
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,560
Huddle please!
Huddle! Come on!

365
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,960
I'm telling you this as a friend,
and not as your coach.

366
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,960
Remember three things.

367
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,280
Choose, challenge and change.

368
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Did you get it?

369
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,440
With these three words,
we can win the championship.

370
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,360
Okay?
Come on!

371
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,680
"Party, party.."

372
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Hey, Preeti!

373
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,400
You're looking beautiful!

374
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,840
Really?
- Yes.

375
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,560
I don't lie, you know that.

376
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,200
Let's take a Coolfie.

377
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,680
I'm rocking.
- I realised that.

378
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,280
That's my twitter handle.
If you want to follow, do it there.

379
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,840
Not here, you fool.

380
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,400
I have your ID card.

381
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,320
Fine.
What day is it today?

382
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,480
Tuesday.
- Then, get it here.

383
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,760
There's a special offer
on movie tickets on Tuesdays.

384
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,520
I'll return it tomorrow.
- I'm Gajanan Kulkarni.

385
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,680
So what?
- I'm your professor. - So?

386
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,640
From Wai.

387
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,240
Oh! So, you are Professor. Gajanan.
- Yes.

388
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
I had heard about you.

389
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,040
That some idiot has come
to teach us from some remote town.

390
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,400
Finally, I met you.

391
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,600
Look, Mr. Shamsundar..
- It's Parijatak.

392
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes.
- Call me 'Battees'.

393
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,080
What? - Everyone around here
call me by that name.. 'Battees'.

394
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,280
See you.
- Shut up!

395
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,200
I'm your professor,
you are just a student.

396
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,160
So what?
- What makes you so arrogant?

397
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,080
It comes from within.
- Exactly! You know no courtesy!

398
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,800
Ladies'..

399
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,080
You go into the ladies' toilet.

400
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,120
You skip lectures
and loiter around in hotels.

401
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,320
You ask girls to tickle your knees.

402
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,440
Hey, come with me..
- Then, you laugh aloud.

403
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,840
What happens
when they tickle your knee?

404
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,920
Tell me! What happened..
- Quiet!

405
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,520
Sir, are you scolding me
or are you just curious?

406
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,360
Sir! Sir! Sir!
Sir..

407
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
Let's take a Coolfie.
- What?

408
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,600
Selfie.
Come on.

409
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,440
What's that?

410
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,840
Pout, please.
- What?

411
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,960
Push your lips forward.

412
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,160
'Coolfie',
short for 'cool selfie'.

413
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,240
'Battees..
The first person to wink at me'

414
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,520
'in the 33 years of my life.'

415
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,800
No! No!

416
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,400
Enough! Enough!

417
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,080
What exactly is this?

418
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,480
Misconception.
- Misconception!

419
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,280
Yes.
- Misconception?

420
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,600
Yes. Sir, in this world
there are many misconceptions.

421
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,400
We had a misconception
during our childhood

422
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,440
that if we swallow a seed,
a tree would grow out of our navel.

423
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,280
That 'DD1' is our channel
and 'DD2' is Pakistan's channel.

424
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,960
That Madhavrao's ghost still haunts
Shaniwardwada palace.

425
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,960
It was Narayanrao.

426
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,200
Correct!
Misconception are just like these.

427
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,040
Even this is one such misconception

428
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,600
that if one feels ticklish
when tickled on their knees

429
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,360
that person is a virgin.

430
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,800
Really?
- Yes.

431
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,400
But I'm not a virgin.

432
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,880
What? Then?
- I'm a Capricorn.

433
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,440
Congratulations! You have won
a travelling voucher to Wai.

434
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,560
You should leave today.

435
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,480
Sorry.

436
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
I anticipated something else.

437
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,520
Have you participated in something?

438
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,120
What nonsense do you talk?

439
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,000
Sir, talk to me with respect.

440
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,520
I'm not saying anything rubbish.
I have six girlfriends.

441
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,120
Two in school, one in tuitions,
one at a petrol pump

442
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,320
one, online
and one from a wrong number.

443
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,520
I'm on a break right now.

444
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,520
I'm writing a book on this.

445
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,720
How to woo these many girls?

446
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,520
This is the title of the book.

447
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,360
Sir, in any corner of the world

448
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
you need three skills to woo girls.

449
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,360
Talent, attitude and looks.

450
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,400
Oh!

451
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,080
What about you?

452
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,160
Innocence.

453
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
Yes.
- Yes.

454
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,920
Let's go.
- Okay.

455
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,440
Let's go.

456
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,160
What about the bill?
- I get credit here.

457
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
Sunny, note it down!
- Okay!

458
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,440
Hey, Battees!
- Yes?

459
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,800
Do you know the hotel's owner?
- Yes, since a long time.

460
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,080
Okay, now you talk about history.

461
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,360
What? - By this time, one could've
narrated the world history.

462
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,760
Tell me about yourself at least.

463
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,000
Ullas, what is my ATM PIN?

464
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
3232.

465
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,000
That's not true.
Now tell me.

466
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
What should I tell you?

467
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,680
You might have gone to school
at one point.

468
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,480
In Wai.
- Boys school?

469
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,960
Our education system
discriminates so much.

470
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,840
You were helpless..
Never mind.

471
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,800
Let's go.

472
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,680
You would have
at least had a friend, girlfriend

473
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,280
who shared your lunch box,
played with you

474
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,800
and played 'Doctor' with.
Do you have any such stories?

475
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,200
'Doctor'?
Hold on! I got it.

476
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,480
There was one.
- Good.

477
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,920
My parents made her declare me
as her brother.

478
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,960
And you gladly agreed, I guess.

479
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,280
What after that?

480
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,160
You must have turned 25 years old.
- I turned 25 years old.

481
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,080
Okay. - Then parents wanted me
to pursue education.

482
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,280
Okay. - Then I acquired my
bachelor's and master's degrees.

483
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,920
I scored the highest.
Then, I got a job..

484
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
Even that was temporary.

485
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,160
Then I thought,
I should grow a little more.

486
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,280
We should have some maturity,
shouldn't we?

487
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,640
Sir, only fixed deposits mature
as the years pass.

488
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,280
Which era are you living in?

489
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,560
This is how I am.

490
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,080
Aren't you married yet?

491
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,600
No.
- What about kids?

492
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,880
Sir!
Sir!

493
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,800
Sir..

494
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,840
Hey, oldie!

495
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
'Why do insults hit you
in slow motion always?'

496
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
'One can address
a man in his thirties'

497
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,840
'as 'criminal' or a 'pervert'
and that's okay.'

498
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,680
'But address them as 'oldie'!
No! This is the fault of this age.'

499
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,560
'One hates being called a 'lad'
and 'oldie' too!'

500
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,720
Will you be my friend?

501
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,320
Why?

502
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,080
To tolerate your foolishness?

503
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,520
I tolerate you too.
- I don't act foolish.

504
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,200
Then act like one.

505
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,680
Sir, if you do become
a girl's life partner

506
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,760
she will be doomed forever.

507
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,520
A husband whose cheeks are
so chubby..

508
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,760
I'm you professor.

509
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,920
You are merely my student.

510
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,360
Remember that, please.

511
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,680
What is this?
- Take out Rs. 1000.

512
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,040
What for? - You see,
I offer a particular course.

513
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,520
Rs. 1000 are registration fees.

514
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,960
With 100 percent cash back.

515
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,320
Syllabus is as I decide.

516
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,800
Study whenever you want.

517
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,920
No exams whatsoever.

518
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,000
Placement guaranteed, 100 percent!

519
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,440
Are you ready?

520
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,320
What are you saying?

521
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,040
Sir, I've conveyed my apology
inwardly already.

522
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,600
I've identified your problem.

523
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
You're a wimp.

524
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,960
You should be made a YZ.
- What is that?

525
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,560
Don't you know what YZ is?
- No.

526
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,400
You don't know what is YZ!
- Must be some profane word.

527
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,800
No.

528
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,920
It must be related to sex.
- Sir, I will walk away from here.

529
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,360
It must be something stupid.

530
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,840
Sir, YZ is a form of art.

531
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,600
It is a riot, full of fun

532
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,800
and most importantly,
YZ is an attitude.

533
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
What?
- An attitude.

534
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,960
Attitude.
- Here, note down my number.

535
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,280
Hold on.

536
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,880
98..
- 98..

537
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,520
32..
- 32..

538
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,800
32..
- 32..

539
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,080
32..
- Okay.

540
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,720
Once again 32.
- Hold on, let me repeat.

541
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,800
9832323232.

542
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,680
Try giving me a call.
Sir, I promise to make you a YZ.

543
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,440
Or else, I'll quit using
4G connection for a year.

544
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,960
Are you in here?

545
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,960
Oops!
Sorry.

546
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,520
I thought Aarti was in here.

547
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,600
I'll wait for her outside.

548
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,880
You may carry on.

549
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,440
By the way..
Hi! I'm Antra.

550
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,240
I'm Gajanan.

551
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,960
Wai.. Teacher..

552
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,120
Aarti..
- Are you her uncle?

553
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,400
Brother..

554
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Oh, okay.
See you, sir.

555
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,280
Hey!
Sorry..

556
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,480
Oh, my God!
Look at her.

557
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,600
She is so hot.

558
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I know.

559
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,480
Thanks.
- Yes.

560
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,600
What does he work as?
- He is a professor.

561
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,160
Can make out.

562
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,760
Is he married?

563
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,640
Do you really think so?

564
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,400
He is just a year older
than my brother.

565
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,840
Hold on.
Is he not 40 years old?

566
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,360
He is 33.

567
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,920
What!

568
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,160
By the way, it was my brother's
six month anniversary last night.

569
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,680
He took his wife
to the Golden Bridge

570
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,840
and gifted her a diamond.
- Wow!

571
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,800
This guy looks like
one sad, boring guy.

572
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,960
Isn't it?
- Absolutely correct.

573
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,320
But what is his problem?

574
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,120
Must be something sexual.

575
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,960
Might be.
Poor bloke.

576
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Sir, come on, say something.

577
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,120
Will you speak up, or do I leave?
- Wait, I'll tell you.

578
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,360
My problem is 'that'.

579
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,320
Tell me who it is,
let's go whack him up.

580
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,720
It's not what you are thinking.

581
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
I mean..

582
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
'That' isn't a real person.

583
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,120
Imaginary friend?

584
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,120
I..

585
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,560
I have to lose that.

586
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,960
You're too slow, sir!
Say it out quick!

587
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,240
Hey! That wasn't for you.
You carry on.

588
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,480
Virginity.
- What?

589
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,680
Virginity.
- Speak louder! I can't hear you!

590
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,840
Virginity!

591
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,080
Hey!

592
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,040
Excuse me.

593
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,240
Sorry, ma'am.

594
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,080
Which class is this?

595
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,320
Yes, I'll tell you.

596
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,160
It's Physics, Accountancy
and boring History.

597
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,480
Actually I'm looking
for French classes. - Okay.

598
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,680
Are you Sengupta?
- How do you know?

599
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,640
Aren't you Ketki's friend?
- Yes.

600
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,800
I'm Battees.
- I'm Samaira.

601
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,600
Do you where is the class?
- Go straight and turn left.

602
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,800
Okay, thank you so much.
- It's okay.

603
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,440
Take care, see you soon.
- Yes.

604
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,560
Bye!

605
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
Sorry, I embarrassed you.
- No.

606
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,240
She is Samaira Sen, lives nearby
in the Ocean building, flat B401.

607
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,160
Oh, you know her.
- No.

608
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,240
I just met her.
- How do you do this?

609
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,280
Sir, your upbringing is at fault,
not your knowledge.

610
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,480
It's not a crime
if a man is a virgin.

611
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,000
Being a virgin is a choice
and being YZ is an attitude.

612
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,320
It all went over my head.

613
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,880
From now on, your training starts.
Come on.

614
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,200
An object in motion,
stays in motion.. - Yes.

615
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,120
...with the same speed
and the same direction

616
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,960
unless acted upon
by an unbalanced force.

617
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,120
This means, your slow moving life
in these 33 years

618
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,040
will continue the same way
if you do not fall in love.

619
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,000
And that has to happen soon.

620
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,960
For example, you are walking
down the road

621
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,360
and a girl bumps into you

622
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,440
and she drops her books
by mistake.

623
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,360
What will you do?

624
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,120
Greetings!

625
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,200
Rule number two.

626
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,600
Concentrate!

627
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,400
Read out loud.

628
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,040
General accounting.
- Yes.

629
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,560
Double entry system?

630
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,720
Yes. Love always never depends
on chemistry or science.

631
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,360
We can make best use of
commerce and accountancy here.

632
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,320
Double entry system is a boon
in love matters.

633
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,840
Suppose you fell in love.

634
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,280
Really? - It's hypothetical,
don't get too excited.

635
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,120
Let's assume that you fell in love

636
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,880
and you gifted her a gold earring.

637
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,840
You also gifted her a Saree

638
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,440
along with a phone.

639
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,120
In return to all these

640
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,200
she gifts you a cheap deodorant
in your three months of dating

641
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,400
what is the cost of your love?

642
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,560
Hence credit and debit
should go hand in hand. - Oh!

643
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,200
Sir..
- Yes.

644
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,920
Once you get married

645
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,280
what gift would you want
on your first night from your wife?

646
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,040
It's okay, never mind.
- Wait, I'll tell you.

647
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,080
Go ahead.

648
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Towel.

649
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,360
Battees!
Battees, open the door!

650
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,960
Sorry, I'll not repeat it again!

651
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,960
To heck with you!

652
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,200
I'll listen to you!
- Towel, my foot!

653
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,840
Whatever.
- Battees! Watchman!

654
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,160
Rule of war..
Read out loud!

655
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,200
People and property that do not
contribute to the war effort

656
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,440
should be protected against

657
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,240
unnecessary destruction
and hardships.

658
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,640
This means, love should be
from both the sides.

659
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,560
Just like a fair war.

660
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,640
And in this war

661
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440
you shouldn't involve
her parents, siblings

662
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,600
neighbours and relatives, ever.

663
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,520
Am I clear?
- Yes.

664
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,320
But how will I manage it
all alone?

665
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,560
You can do it
through confidence.

666
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,320
Trust me you can do it.
Just be confident.

667
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,800
Confidence is everything.

668
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,600
Courage is not just having
the strength to go on.

669
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,960
Courage is going on
when you don't have strength.

670
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,200
Understood?

671
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
Yes, sir!

672
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,120
Sir, curiosity, will
and discovery..

673
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,240
Never mind, you won't understand.
- Okay.

674
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,400
Sir, I've repeated
11th grade thrice.

675
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,320
What do you mean? - The first time
I took up Arts stream and failed.

676
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,400
Then I took up Commerce stream
and failed again.

677
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,920
Then I tried my luck with science.

678
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,000
Then I realised that
Arts stream was better. - Yes.

679
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
So, now I'm back to
the Arts stream.

680
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,440
Okay. - With that I have funded
three start-up companies.

681
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,840
Once it launches in the market,
it will create a havoc.

682
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Don't be silly!

683
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Sir, the world is way beyond
our imagination.

684
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,720
Is your name really
Shamsundar Parijatak?

685
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,080
I doubt it.

686
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,200
Sir, at times,
a fatso is named 'Lily'.

687
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,360
A weakling has the last name
'Strong'.

688
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,640
My uncle named 'Flame'
was in fact, a fire-fighter.

689
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
If a fire breaks out,
do let me know.

690
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,160
Okay?
- Yes.

691
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,240
But tell me something,
what is this?

692
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,480
This blue board?

693
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,280
This is the speciality
of Pune and London.

694
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,320
There is always a blue board
outside rich people's homes.

695
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,720
Oh, Okay. Good to know.
- Yes.

696
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,680
Come on.

697
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,280
Do you want to become rich?

698
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,640
Yes, come on.

699
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,160
Sir, what is this?

700
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,640
We had theory classes today.
- Yes.

701
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,800
We'll conduct practicals tomorrow.

702
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,200
Meet me tomorrow, at the hill
at 6:00 a.m. sharp. - Okay.

703
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,720
Battees! Hold up!

704
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,800
Hey! This is impossible!

705
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,720
Stop!

706
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,600
Sir..
- What?

707
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,800
No pain, no gain.

708
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,720
These are Shakespeare's words.

709
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,600
When did he say this?
- During workouts.

710
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,720
Must be true, since you said it.

711
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,640
The view is a feast for the eyes.
- True!

712
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,200
All these trees, the sky,
birds chirping and the sun..

713
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,200
Sir, you will never change.

714
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,560
The ultimate creation of the world
is right in front of you

715
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
and you are admiring birds?

716
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,760
Then should I be ogling at girls?

717
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,000
Sir, girls are God's best creation.

718
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,440
Look at them admiringly.

719
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,840
Let it be!
I don't like being this cheap.

720
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,760
What do you mean?

721
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,080
Checking girls out in secret
is decency

722
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,720
and admiring them openly
is cheap, right?

723
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,880
It's exactly like
enjoying porn while alone

724
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,520
but change the TV channel
when a sultry movie scene appears.

725
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,440
Sir, you should admire girls
respectfully

726
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,920
and not check them out.

727
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,760
Hey, she is waving at me.

728
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,920
Then wave back at her.

729
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,880
You must wave back.

730
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,880
This is strange!

731
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,200
I'm hanging out with a boy
half my age

732
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,800
and am waving at girls
at a hilltop in Pune!

733
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,800
Sir, this is how you educate.

734
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,720
This field is such.

735
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,920
You never know when
a learning opportunity appears.

736
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,040
After a long time
I have enjoyed so much. - Is it?

737
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,240
I used to do such crazy things
in my teen age.

738
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,680
It's so amazing to sit by a river
with your feet in water.

739
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,960
Oh!
- We would catch frogs too.

740
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,480
Sir, for your information
frogs urinate when they're caught.

741
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,400
True!

742
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,520
You must come to Wai with me.

743
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,960
I'll surely do that

744
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
to attend your wedding.

745
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,160
Do you really believe
that I'll get married.

746
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,440
You would need some nudging.

747
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
But you will definitely
pass this test.

748
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,880
Isn't it?
- Shut up.

749
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,040
But before that

750
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,200
the thing that
I'm about to tell you

751
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,920
will change the definition
of love for you.

752
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,880
What is that?

753
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,680
We are done with the theory.
- Yes.

754
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,760
We're done with practicals too.

755
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,360
Yes.
- Now, it's distance learning.

756
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,800
What?
- Let's go.

757
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,360
Follow me.
- Let's go.

758
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,480
"Hey, oldie!
- Hey, oldie!"

759
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,480
"Oldie!"

760
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,960
"The whole world is energetic,
why are you so dull?"

761
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,680
"Don't feel shy,
just be one of us."

762
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,600
"Hey, oldie!
- Hey, oldie!"

763
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,200
"Open your eyes and see
where the world has reached."

764
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,920
"Just quit worrying
and have some fun."

765
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,960
"Hey, oldie!
- Hey, oldie!"

766
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,480
"The whole world is energetic,
why are you so dull?"

767
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,960
"Don't feel shy,
just be one of us."

768
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,520
"Open your eyes and see
where the world has reached."

769
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,160
"Just quit worrying
and have some fun."

770
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,680
"Oh, until you have the energy..
- Wow, sir!"

771
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,800
"...experience everything."

772
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,200
"You will lose out
on this opportunity too"

773
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,880
"and will be left with nothing."

774
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,920
"Either turn around"

775
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,240
"or look back."

776
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,000
"Either turn around or look back."

777
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,760
"Let loose and create come havoc."

778
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,840
"Come on.."

779
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,160
"Hey, oldie!
- Hey, oldie!"

780
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,320
"Hey, oldie!"

781
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,200
"Play along, beautiful."

782
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,680
Sir, there are three types of love.

783
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,520
Temporary, sentimental
and illusion.

784
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,600
What are you saying?
- Let me explain.

785
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,920
The first type is temporary type.

786
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,120
They fall in love just to update
their Facebook status.

787
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,400
They will update it saying
'committed'.

788
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,640
But when they actually have
to commit, they break up.

789
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,080
What?
- Pay attention.

790
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,120
"The first type is
full of sentiments."

791
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,360
"One feels this will last forever."

792
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,200
"This kind is the temporary one."

793
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,480
"Will move on
in less than a month."

794
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,200
"This kind is always
into each other."

795
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,640
"That the body
becomes inseparable."

796
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,160
"This kind will update
their social site regularly."

797
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,720
"With their pouted selfies."

798
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,760
"One fight will end their love."

799
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,400
"Then they look for ways to erase
the tattoo that is left behind."

800
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,840
"Either turn around"

801
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,320
"or look back."

802
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,040
"Keep some distance
and learn and observe."

803
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,760
"Let loose and create come havoc."

804
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,080
"Come on.."

805
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,200
"Hey, oldie!
- Hey, oldie!"

806
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,920
"Hey, oldie!"

807
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,800
"Come, follow me, baby."

808
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:35,760
"Come follow me.."

809
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,520
"Baby!"

810
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,560
Now the second type is..

811
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,080
What?

812
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,720
The second type is
the sentimental ones.

813
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,080
What are you saying?

814
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,120
In this type there is a lover
and there is a perfect guy.

815
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,520
The perfect guy gets the girl
and the lover is left with nothing.

816
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,920
Do you want to see a live example?
- Live example?

817
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,360
Have a look.

818
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,160
"Look at this deceiving truth."

819
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,360
"This type is called
sentimental type."

820
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,200
"They will raise him with love."

821
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,280
"But actually never loved him."

822
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,440
"They always address you
as 'dear'."

823
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,400
"But never give you
the clear picture."

824
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,760
"They are the selfish ones."

825
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,480
"But fall in love with
the other perfect guy."

826
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,960
"The lover can only stand
look at her getting married."

827
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,080
"He becomes upset
and creates a scene."

828
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,840
"Calm down, fool."

829
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,960
"Just enjoy the show"

830
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,560
"and leave in silence."

831
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,080
"Be at peace
and create a revolution."

832
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,240
"Let loose and create come havoc."

833
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,040
"Come on."

834
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,680
"Hey, oldie!
- Hey, oldie!"

835
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,640
"Hey, oldie!"

836
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,920
"Hey, oldie!"

837
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,080
Hello, sir!

838
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,280
How's this for a meeting place?

839
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,280
Do you live in such an open place?

840
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,200
Yes.

841
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,520
But not always.
- Okay.

842
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,800
This is my office, meeting room

843
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,480
out-house, guest-house..
This is everything. - Okay.

844
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,680
Please have a seat, sir.

845
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,840
Feel comfortable.
- Thank you..

846
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,680
Battees..
- Yes.

847
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,800
What is YZ night food express?

848
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,440
It's the current thing in my life.
- Is it? - Yes.

849
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,840
Wow!
- Let that be.

850
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,520
How do you feel
after learning so much?

851
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,000
To be honest.

852
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,400
It surprises me to look at the way
people look at love these days.

853
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,040
Wrong! Only the sentimental types
are like this.

854
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,880
Yes.
Still, it's bewildering.

855
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,280
What? Please carry a dictionary
from tomorrow.

856
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,720
Why?
- If you use such big words

857
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,560
even the girl who likes you
will ditch you.

858
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,240
All your big scary words.

859
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,440
But you are great.

860
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,640
You have made me younger
by 10 years at least.

861
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,920
Thank you.

862
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,000
'My Lord!'

863
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,400
'My Lord,
your peace is my satisfaction.'

864
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,720
'I worship your passion.'

865
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,200
'Once you sniff this rose'

866
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
'your life will change forever.'

867
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,600
'Now I desire only one love.'

868
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,040
'And that's it!'

869
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,160
'Sir!'

870
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,680
Sir!

871
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,840
Sir!
- Yes.

872
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,400
What is with you?

873
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,400
Have some tea.

874
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,240
What is the third type of love?

875
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,680
If the teacher is good at his job

876
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,680
even the student becomes curious
about the topic.

877
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,720
You know the first type

878
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,080
and the second type of love.

879
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,640
Now you'll see the third type.

880
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,560
Here you go.

881
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,440
The horoscopes are a perfect match.

882
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,720
When did this happen?
- I've sent her photo to your mom.

883
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,880
Everything is very compatible.

884
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,680
Mr. Gajanan..
- Yes.

885
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,920
Parnarekha has completed
her master's degree.

886
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,960
She has topped her batch.
- Wow!

887
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,920
She's fond of cooking too.
She cooks all kinds of cuisines.

888
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,120
Good.
- First class!

889
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,600
She is also the best in
creating Rangoli designs.

890
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,960
Beautiful ones!
- Top designs!

891
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,080
Wow! Wow! Wow!
I had told you

892
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,240
that I'll look for a perfect girl
for you in a month. - Right.

893
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,160
Hi, perfect girl!

894
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,200
Hey, her name isn't 'perfect girl'.

895
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,040
It's Parnarekha.
- Why?

896
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:52,960
What 'why'?

897
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,720
She's still a perfect girl!

898
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,400
Hey!
- Am I right?

899
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,160
Yes she is.

900
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,400
We're going to name you Jhanvi
after the wedding.

901
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,040
What?
What kind of a name is 'Jhanvi'?

902
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,360
By the way, who are you?

903
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,040
Teacher, stu..
- Student, te..

904
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,680
Okay! Okay!

905
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,160
Ma'am, please get the snacks.
The guests seem hungry.

906
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,480
Come on.
- Oh, right!

907
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,800
I forgot, I'll just get it.
- Aarti, come on.

908
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,240
Let's leave.
- Aarti..

909
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,160
Ask your mom
to get some cookies too.

910
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,240
Check if we have it.

911
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,120
Aarti, come here
and take these plates out!

912
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,920
Top taste!
Wow!

913
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,600
Let's give them some time
to talk in private.

914
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,320
No, thanks..
- Hey!

915
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,440
Why not needed?
- Go on. - Come on.

916
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,240
Go. - You should get to
know each other well. - True.

917
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,840
Come here.

918
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,040
Go on.
- Finally.

919
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,880
Yes.
- Talk to each other freely. Go on.

920
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,200
Aarti..
- Yes.

921
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,320
Please come in.
Come in.

922
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,480
Gajanan, please don't be so formal.

923
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,040
Okay, have a seat.

924
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,160
It's normal to feel awkward
in such situations, rights?

925
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,640
Sir, don't you worry.

926
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,240
Our sir is not an opportunist,
isn't it?

927
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,440
At least give me a cookie.
- Why don't you sit?

928
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,840
Let me do it.

929
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,400
I don't like untidiness.

930
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,400
I like to keep my house clean.

931
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,440
Okay.

932
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,280
I like subtly things in life.
- Wow!

933
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,480
Oh, my!

934
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,720
That's my brother, not me..
- This is so beautiful!

935
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,480
Yes.
- May I see it?

936
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,080
Yes, of course!

937
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,080
This scarf is very beautiful.

938
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,720
Is it?

939
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,480
Someone must have knit it
with so much love. - Yes.

940
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,640
Marriage too is like
knitting this scarf.

941
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,040
A husband and a wife are
the needles who trust

942
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,160
that they will knit their love

943
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,600
slowly and gradually
and put in their best effort.

944
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,040
That's how they create
a beautiful relationship.

945
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,480
Isn't it?

946
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,920
Yes.

947
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,720
Hail Lord Krishna.

948
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,040
Please take a seat.

949
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,120
Sure.

950
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,360
It's really beautiful.
- Yes.

951
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,960
If you like it,
you may take this home.

952
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,600
That would be so not nice.

953
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,560
I'll knit a similar scarf for you.

954
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,600
Hello, Battees!
Hello, Battees! - Yes, sir.

955
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,720
Did she agree to marry you?

956
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,520
Not yet.
- Okay, then listen to me.

957
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,520
Okay. - They'll reject you
by the night fall.

958
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,880
Don't panic and cry.

959
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,040
You have to learn a lot.
Hope you understand.

960
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,800
People will say that it's your
bad luck that you got rejected.

961
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,040
But that is not true.

962
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,440
She said 'yes'.
- What?

963
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,840
Battees, she agreed to marry me!

964
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,000
Hello! Hello!
Hello, Battees!

965
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,440
Yes. - Yes? - I stood in silence
for two minutes for myself.

966
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,720
She agreed so soon?

967
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,280
I spoke to her for ten minutes

968
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,560
and it felt so real and soothing.

969
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,680
She walked out and told my aunt..

970
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,440
'I like him.'

971
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,680
Battees, someone liked me!

972
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,240
Sir, be careful.

973
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,160
They have agreed too soon.

974
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,000
There might me some issue.

975
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,560
Listen.
The engagement is in three weeks

976
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,840
and the wedding is at Wai
after two months.

977
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,080
You have to be there!

978
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,600
Sir, you were faster
than I thought.

979
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,680
It's okay.

980
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,760
Wish you a very happy pre-married
and married life, sir.

981
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,960
Enjoy!

982
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,280
I won't be there from tomorrow.

983
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,520
Hello, Battees!
Thank you!

984
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,480
I know so much about girls
because of you.

985
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,480
I'll use every bit of it.

986
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,400
Sure, use it.

987
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,080
She's here! She's here!

988
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,800
What a man!

989
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,720
Cheers!

990
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,560
As free minded individuals I feel
we should share our expectations.

991
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,840
Yes. - I expect my husband
to be fit and healthy.

992
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,560
Did I say anything wrong?

993
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,080
No! You are right.

994
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,680
Sir, what's your order?
- Yes.

995
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,440
Two plates of 'Wada Sambar'
and four buns.

996
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,120
And fried chillies to go along.

997
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,680
I just said 'healthy'.

998
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,840
Buns are made of flour
and potatoes cause bloating.

999
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,720
And they use pickle oil
to prepare 'Sambar'.

1000
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,280
Is it?
- Yes.

1001
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,760
Okay, then cancel 'Wada Sambar'

1002
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,680
and get two plate 'Idli Sambar'.

1003
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,000
Okay.
- Let's not order 'Sambar'.

1004
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,880
Is 'Chutney' okay?
- Sandwich.

1005
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,600
Sandwich please!
No cheese, no butter, no potatoes.

1006
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,680
Okay.

1007
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,080
Is bread okay?

1008
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,480
Don't be silly.

1009
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,160
You may leave.

1010
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,400
Okay.

1011
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,640
Eat this, you will feel very light.

1012
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,120
What about you?
- No, I'm observing a fast.

1013
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,600
Okay.

1014
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,360
Shall I address you as 'Gaja'?

1015
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,840
Okay..
- I will.

1016
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,720
Let's be an open minded couple.
- Sure.

1017
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,240
Do you know
where our community hall is?

1018
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,640
Yes. - From tomorrow, let's start
visiting their gym.

1019
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,280
We will get a couples' discount.

1020
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,600
And after we are done with workout,
we will meditate.

1021
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,920
One should lose sweat
and dirt in their minds

1022
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,040
in a daily basis,
according to my guru.

1023
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,440
I forgot to mention.

1024
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,920
I've two father figures.

1025
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,720
Yes.

1026
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,440
One is my father
and the other is Sage Thombe.

1027
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,960
Hail Sage Thombe.

1028
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,840
He regards me as his daughter.

1029
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,120
We should visit
their hermitage once.

1030
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,160
Not daily.

1031
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,280
Just on Mondays,
Wednesdays, Fridays..

1032
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,800
the fourth day and the eleventh day
of the month..

1033
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,640
And they hold gatherings
on full moon and new moon days.

1034
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,400
It's an amazing experience.

1035
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,560
A completely pure atmosphere.

1036
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,840
Oh! - Oh, my!
It just slipped my mind.

1037
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,880
How could I forget?
- What?

1038
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,200
Bend.
- What?

1039
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,080
Bend a little.

1040
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,560
Hail Sage Thombe.

1041
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,880
Let me show you
the sage's pictures.

1042
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,320
He's Sage Thombe.

1043
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:41,960
Gaja..

1044
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,240
Once a person
devotes himself to God

1045
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,880
his fate becomes healthy.

1046
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,440
'Let's begin!'

1047
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,200
Gaja..

1048
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,080
Gaja..

1049
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,440
Gaja..

1050
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,080
What happened to you?

1051
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,520
Healthy..

1052
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
Hail Sage Thombe.

1053
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,480
"My heart bloomed
like a flower."

1054
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,400
"My heart bloomed
like a flower."

1055
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,800
"Spring has arrived
in the garden of my mind."

1056
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,720
"My heart bloomed
like a flower."

1057
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,680
"My soul yearns
for companionship."

1058
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,520
"My soul yearns
for companionship."

1059
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,960
"Today, yet again I have become.."

1060
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,040
Why?
- You're blessed.

1061
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,000
"Sacred."

1062
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,160
"Sacred."

1063
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,440
Mom, get it quickly!

1064
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,360
Here she is.

1065
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,920
Give it to me quickly.
- Here you go.

1066
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,160
"My heart bloomed
like a flower.."

1067
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,160
Gaja, open your mouth.

1068
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,560
"My heart bloomed
like a flower.."

1069
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,040
We observe a fast today.

1070
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,640
Son-in-law, would you have
some offerings?

1071
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,400
Very good offerings!

1072
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,080
He's just too much.
- Will you have some more?

1073
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,240
"My heart bloomed
like a flower.."

1074
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,200
Gaja..
- Yes.

1075
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,560
We'll work out from tomorrow.

1076
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,640
Parnarekha,
will I be able to do it?

1077
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,120
Of course!
I would be there with you.

1078
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,560
Hey, we are not..

1079
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,480
Hello, sir!
- Battees!

1080
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,880
Sorry.

1081
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,120
Hey, Gaja!

1082
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,880
Have some control.
- What?

1083
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,560
Come here and draw a 'Rangoli'.

1084
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:52,640
"My lover has arrived
and brought a smile."

1085
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,600
"The bliss made me
forget myself."

1086
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,640
"Amidst the endless pleasures"

1087
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,440
"I echoed like a song."

1088
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:12,520
"By the lucid touch
of the dew drop"

1089
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,920
"has turned me into.."

1090
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,920
Oh, my!
- Why?

1091
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,480
Sage is watching us.
- Sage?

1092
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,800
The sage.

1093
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,480
Forgive me, Guru.

1094
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,040
Forgive me.

1095
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,400
"Sacred!"

1096
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,960
"My heart bloomed
like a flower."

1097
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,880
"My heart bloomed
like a flower."

1098
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,960
"Spring has arrived
in the garden of my mind."

1099
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,760
"My heart bloomed
like a flower."

1100
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,880
"My soul yearns
for companionship."

1101
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:13,200
"Today, yet again I have become..
- Pristine.."

1102
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,120
'My life is like a sea
and you are a shell in it.'

1103
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,040
'With the pearls of love
our hearts have united.'

1104
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,960
'Today's is the sage's
salvation day.'

1105
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,560
'Set his picture as the wallpaper
on your phone.'

1106
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,640
'Sacred.'

1107
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,640
Be careful.

1108
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,880
Gaja..
- Yes.

1109
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,800
Do you know my sage?

1110
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,640
Yes.

1111
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,920
And his disciples?

1112
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,280
Yes.

1113
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,240
And his hymns?

1114
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,560
Yes.

1115
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,000
Do you know
Shamsundar Parijatak?

1116
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,960
No.
- You should know him.

1117
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,200
You should know him.
- Is it?

1118
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,840
YZ is his greatest philosophy.

1119
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,240
Gaja, you are too much!

1120
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:22,960
Oh, Guru!

1121
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,840
Spider..
- It was my hand.

1122
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,040
Gaja!

1123
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,160
I-It was my hand..

1124
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,960
Oh, I forgot my..

1125
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,120
Oh, my!

1126
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,240
Your earrings are very beautiful.

1127
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,720
Not now.

1128
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,800
It's already 11:30 p.m.

1129
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
Mind the surroundings.

1130
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,080
Lately, every place has
CCTV cameras installed.

1131
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,720
What if our clip goes viral?

1132
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,200
We would be defamed.

1133
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,840
Parnarekha,
we are about to get married.

1134
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,440
Then you may kiss my hand.

1135
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,040
Are you sure?

1136
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,240
You seem pretty upset today.

1137
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,040
Come back tomorrow evening.

1138
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,200
You'll find peace.

1139
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,520
Why? What is tomorrow?

1140
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,880
The prayer meet gathering
will start from tomorrow.

1141
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,120
You'll calm down automatically.

1142
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,000
You'll have total control
on desires.

1143
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,000
Gaja, I forgot to
tell you one thing.

1144
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,680
Do you know who is attending
our wedding in Wai?

1145
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,920
The Sage, Himself!

1146
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,440
Isn't that great!

1147
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,040
It's too late.
- Yes.

1148
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,880
See you.
- Okay.

1149
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,240
Good night.
- Okay.

1150
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,080
Gaja..
- Yes.

1151
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,080
'The next criminal is Gajanan!'

1152
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,680
'Dead!'

1153
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,760
My life is haunted

1154
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,280
by a malicious entity
named Sage Thombe.

1155
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,600
She's planning to indulge me
in her spiritual talks

1156
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,080
and make me completely like her.

1157
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,000
Is this what marriage is about?

1158
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,120
Or do things go back to normal
eventually?

1159
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,880
Does one has to keep adjusting
his whole life?

1160
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,880
Oh, sir!
- Yes.

1161
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,280
Sir!
- Yes.

1162
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,760
What is happening to you?

1163
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,080
Have some water and calm down.

1164
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,200
Why do I calm down?

1165
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,240
I was out to buy muesli
in the morning

1166
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,880
and she changed
my account status.

1167
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,280
Instead of YZ

1168
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,800
she set my status as
'spirituality leads to divinity'!

1169
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,160
When did you start eating muesli?

1170
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,760
She is a nice girl

1171
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,720
but she is very boring.

1172
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,920
She is worse than me.

1173
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,840
Battees..

1174
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:58,640
In the 33 years of my life,
no girl has ever loved me.

1175
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,960
No girl has ever hugged me.

1176
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,360
No one has held my arm.

1177
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,440
I have never had
any experience with girls.

1178
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,240
Even I feel like
having a girlfriend.

1179
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,680
Someone who rides pillion
on my motor bike.

1180
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,400
Somebody to go
on long drives with.

1181
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,680
A house which we can call our own.

1182
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,080
I can't do all this with her.

1183
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,120
Once, you had told me something.
Do you remember?

1184
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,480
If you consider life
as a cricket match

1185
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,120
then always look for
the highlights.

1186
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,960
Till now, I have had
only two highlights.

1187
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,960
You and Sayali.

1188
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,320
Because the time spent
with both of you are priceless.

1189
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,160
Are you done?

1190
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,560
Don't you understand?

1191
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,680
I don't want my marriage
to be a compromise!

1192
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,560
Then don't get married.

1193
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,840
Who is asking you to get married?

1194
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:12,120
Sir, if Mr. Gajanan goes to
an under construction building

1195
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,760
then he's called Mr. YZ.

1196
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,320
You have seen the glamour.
- Yes.

1197
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,360
You have tasted the thrill.
- Yes.

1198
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,880
Now, let's wreak havoc!

1199
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:27,960
Welcome back!

1200
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,800
That's great!
- This is nothing.

1201
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,440
Gajanan, you look so different.

1202
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,440
You look weird
without your moustache.

1203
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,240
But be careful in future.

1204
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,880
You shouldn't cut hair
on Saturdays.

1205
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,800
And what's this you are eating?

1206
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,200
I have got sweets for you.

1207
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,880
Listen, I just want to say..
- Even I want to say something.

1208
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,600
My aunt told me, the 21st
of this month is an auspicious day.

1209
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,720
They want us to get engaged then.

1210
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,040
And get married
on the 14th of next month.

1211
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,160
After marriage, we'll go
for a pilgrimage for 3 days.

1212
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,560
And then..

1213
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,920
I am extremely happy, Gaja.

1214
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,080
Eat fast.
We have loads of work.

1215
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,040
Listen..

1216
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,200
I mean..

1217
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,720
I really don't know

1218
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,160
if I am ready for marriage yet.

1219
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,440
You'll get used to it.
It doesn't happen overnight.

1220
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,520
You eat this.
- No, I mean..

1221
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,680
I don't if I'm ready

1222
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,600
to get married..
- We'll manage.

1223
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,680
It'll take some time.

1224
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,480
You eat this first..
- Don't you understand?

1225
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,440
I don't want to marry you.

1226
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,960
You are a boring person.
Extremely boring!

1227
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,200
Take a look at yourself.
You'll realise then.

1228
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,800
What kind of person
have you become?

1229
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,200
You have beautiful eyes,
but they are always blank.

1230
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,320
You have soft hands,
but no one can hold them.

1231
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,600
Why do you always tie
your beautiful hair?

1232
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:51,120
You make faces like you're
responsible for the whole world.

1233
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,680
And your clothes..
- Enough, Gaja.

1234
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,200
Why?
I thought I was the boring one.

1235
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:06,480
But you..
Please stop bothering yourself

1236
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,920
and others too.

1237
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,760
The can manage
the fault in your stars.

1238
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,040
But I can't tolerate
the fault in your heart.

1239
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,360
Parnarekha, I can't marry you.

1240
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,480
My decision is final.

1241
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,080
You might feel bad.

1242
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,720
But I have made up my mind.

1243
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,880
Listen to what I say.

1244
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,400
Apologize to her.

1245
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,480
Let's talk to him first..
- No, let him talk now.

1246
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,760
For eight years, I have kept mum.

1247
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,680
I thought he'll change
for the better here, but no.

1248
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,040
When your aunt sent me her picture,
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1249
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,720
I was surprised.
How could such a pretty girl

1250
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,520
agree to marry this moron!

1251
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
What are you staring at?

1252
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,600
You can't find girls like her
everywhere.

1253
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,440
She earns more than you.

1254
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,680
She looks after her parents
and is spiritual.

1255
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,080
And what are you?

1256
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,960
She's doing you a favour
by agreeing to marry you.

1257
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,240
You need a companion at this age.

1258
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,600
You need someone to call your own.

1259
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,480
But you should adjust a little.

1260
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,320
But, no!

1261
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,240
We don't even know
what is bothering you.

1262
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,240
You decided to vent out
everything on her?

1263
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,360
This is my final advice.

1264
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,480
Apologise to her
and agree to marry to her.

1265
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,360
Hey!
- Hey, Gaja!

1266
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,480
Don't worry, dear!
Don't worry!

1267
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,040
He has done this six times before.
He'll be back by evening.

1268
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,560
Sir, what's got your tongue?

1269
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,360
First, take me away from here.

1270
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:44,800
How did you come here?

1271
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,200
Will you talk now?

1272
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,240
Battees, what do I do?

1273
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,640
I'll say yes to Parnarekha.

1274
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,400
Let it be.
- Is she your maid?

1275
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,200
That you call her when needed?

1276
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,120
Don't do any such thing!

1277
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,720
But mom, dad and aunt
are my dear ones.

1278
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,240
How can I oppose them?

1279
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,680
Sir, tell me one thing honestly.

1280
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,120
Do you want to marry her or not?

1281
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,080
Then, stand up for your decision.

1282
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,480
Sir, to tell you the truth

1283
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,240
we all have a little rebel in us

1284
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,480
who lives on his terms.

1285
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,880
But when we grow up,
we start listening to people

1286
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,080
and we stop listening to him.

1287
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,280
We don't pay attention to him.

1288
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,600
Then he gets hurt
and grows distant from us.

1289
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:55,040
Sir, We, who think about him
before anybody else

1290
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,360
start giving more importance
to others' opinions.

1291
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,960
But we're used to
going with the flow.

1292
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,720
The IQ of a crowd is zero, sir.

1293
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,800
They think fair skin is beautiful
and dark skin is ugly.

1294
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,560
Being slim is called fashionable
and being fat is looked down upon.

1295
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,440
Sir, we should break
these stereotypes.

1296
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,840
We should revive our older version.

1297
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,560
We should talk and listen to him.

1298
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,760
You should spend time with
your older self from Wai.

1299
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,520
You follow him, sir.

1300
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,640
If you are happy, then stop.

1301
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,280
But first make a start.

1302
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,800
Not for others, but you.

1303
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,040
Make a start!

1304
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,520
Hello, Parnarekha!

1305
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,440
I have called to apologise
wholeheartedly.

1306
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,920
But my decision is the same.

1307
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,600
Excuse me!

1308
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,040
Level 29?
- Yes.

1309
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,120
Try to reach level 35
before the end of class.

1310
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,560
Continue.

1311
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,960
Excuse me, sir.
Are you done?

1312
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,840
No.
Is there any problem?

1313
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,520
No, sorry.

1314
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,560
No, mom won't agree.
- Try and let me know. - Okay.

1315
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,560
Bye!
- Bye!

1316
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,440
Hey, Uncle!
- Hello, kid!

1317
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,680
Give me a break.
I'm not a kid.

1318
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,400
Give me a break.
Even I'm not an uncle.

1319
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,960
Wow!
- Okay, bye. - Bye!

1320
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,920
By the way..

1321
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,280
You had a narrow escape that day.
- What do you mean?

1322
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,360
That lady, Ms. Parnarekha is
so amazingly sad.

1323
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,640
Don't say that about her.
- She was lame.

1324
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,720
Let it be.
Come..

1325
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,240
But tell me something,
why did you refuse exactly?

1326
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,200
I won't tell you.
- Why?

1327
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,960
Firstly, because
it doesn't concern you

1328
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,040
and secondly, you are not capable
of understanding it.

1329
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,760
Excuse me!
I'm 20.

1330
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,040
So?
Come on.

1331
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,240
Aarti, you have my Sanskrit book.

1332
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,560
Who studies Sanskrit?

1333
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,680
Of course, me.

1334
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,160
Why is your attitude this way?

1335
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,920
Because of your BA degree,
or Sanskrit, or since birth?

1336
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,440
Wow! You have upheld our
traditions by studying Sanskrit.

1337
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,000
Bye.

1338
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,760
Their Sanskrit must be easy.

1339
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,240
At most you might
have learnt..

1340
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,600
I learnt these in school.
Now I am in college.

1341
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:09,520
Do you have poems then?

1342
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,960
I think they must be
teaching you the poem 'Bhaas'.

1343
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,560
'Sapna Vasudutta' and 'Shakuntala'?

1344
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,400
Freak!
We have both.

1345
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,080
I have them all memorised.
- What are you talking about?

1346
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,480
For you, it's gibberish.
Hop on.

1347
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,120
See you.

1348
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,600
Hi!
I'm sorry.

1349
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:58,040
For what?
- Not you, him.

1350
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,040
I'm sorry.
I'm genuinely very sorry.

1351
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,680
It's okay.

1352
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,520
Will you teach me
'Sapna Vasudutta', please?

1353
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,640
I-I'm a professor of History,
not Sanskrit.

1354
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,000
Learn in the college.

1355
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,360
Yes.
- I would have.

1356
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,640
But I can't understand
what Mrs. Shintre teaches.

1357
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,000
And I can learn faster from you.
It'll be fun, won't it?

1358
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,240
Please, I beg you!
- Hey! Hey!

1359
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,080
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1360
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,800
What's happening? - Hey!
I broke three traffic signals!

1361
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,080
I almost ran over someone
and broke a car's mirror.

1362
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,480
I won't even call you 'Uncle'
from now.

1363
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,480
Okay?

1364
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,280
What?
Okay, done.

1365
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,440
Tomorrow at 4 o'clock!

1366
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,920
Mom's hosting a function.
- Then come to my place.

1367
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,160
Done? Done!
- Yes.

1368
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,240
Great!
- Okay, see you then.

1369
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,560
Ride slow or you might crash
into more mirrors.

1370
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,120
Bye!

1371
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,760
So, she can't understand
what Mrs. Shintre says nowadays?

1372
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,760
Don't pay her much attention.

1373
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,080
She's trouble.

1374
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,720
Are you going to teach her
for real?

1375
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,720
Hello!
Is Antara there?

1376
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,680
Come inside.
Come..

1377
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,720
Please come inside.
Come sit.

1378
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,640
Be comfortable.

1379
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:33,760
Your house is beautiful.

1380
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,360
Shall we start?
- Yes, sure.

1381
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:45,920
But, Antara,
I have never taught this before..

1382
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:46,960
That's okay.

1383
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,880
We'll follow a step by step
approach.

1384
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,880
Let's keep 'Bhaas' aside for now.

1385
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,360
We'll start with Shakuntala?
- Okay.

1386
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,840
Amazing!

1387
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,440
Tell me, have you read 'Shakuntala'
and 'Sapna Vasudutta', both?

1388
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,400
Just a minute.

1389
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,680
Tell me, Battees.

1390
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,280
And I quote..
- What?

1391
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:35,080
'Live life on your terms,
only the dead are carried away.'

1392
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,320
Who says that?

1393
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,600
Mirza Ghalib.

1394
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,160
Since you're saying so,
it must be true. Mirza Ghalib.

1395
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,520
Sir, this is our house.

1396
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,560
Ours?
- Yes.

1397
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,080
You know my friend, Totya.
He wanted a tenant.

1398
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,320
I told him that I'd get one.

1399
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,760
What do you mean?
- You wanted privacy, right?

1400
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,640
Yes, but..
- Come on, then.

1401
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,480
Come on..
- Battees..

1402
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,520
Come inside, sir.

1403
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:03,760
What's this, Battees?

1404
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,400
How long are you going to stay
at your aunt's place?

1405
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,480
Learn how to live alone.

1406
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,720
Look here, this is the kitchen.

1407
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,680
It has running water all day.

1408
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,120
You need not worry.

1409
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,440
This is the living room.

1410
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,600
It's spacious and bright
and the breeze is good, too.

1411
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,040
The construction is strong.
No fear of robbers.

1412
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,640
Neighbours are friendly,
their dogs are docile.

1413
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,680
And most important, your house
has a separate entrance.

1414
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,320
You have no reason to worry.

1415
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,800
The rent is Rs. 8,000
and deposit is Rs. 30,000.

1416
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,560
You can take possession
this very moment. What say, sir?

1417
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:21,880
Aarti..

1418
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,640
Thank you.
- For what?

1419
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,880
For tolerating me.

1420
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,480
You can come to my new house
anytime.

1421
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,920
I don't need Sanskrit classes.

1422
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,920
Come down for a chat.

1423
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,400
Aarti, I know that
you don't like me much.

1424
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,600
And also the fact
that I meet Antara.

1425
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,680
But I'm trying something new.

1426
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,680
I need you to help me.

1427
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:01,920
As a friend.

1428
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,960
Will you help me?

1429
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,240
Thank you, and all the best.

1430
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,840
What colour have you
painted your house?

1431
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,400
Come on, guys!
Say cheese! - Cheese!

1432
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,000
Let me see!
- Help me first. - Slowly.

1433
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,480
It's a nice picture.
- Let me see. - Look!

1434
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,840
Nice!
- Aarti was left out. - Yes.

1435
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,120
By the way, he is Topsy
and that's Turvy.

1436
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,360
It's their names.

1437
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,640
This one is exactly like you,
and that's like me.

1438
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,760
It's nice. - Both are males.
- Thanks.

1439
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,720
Aarti, are you on WhatsApp?

1440
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,760
No! - Be quiet.
- No!

1441
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,320
I'll give you her number.
Don't worry.

1442
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,080
I'll text you her number.
- Thank you.

1443
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:17,960
Shall we leave? - Aarti..
- Let's go.

1444
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,400
Bye! Thank you.
- Bye!

1445
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,880
Come, give me your number.
- Yes, come.

1446
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,240
Antara, thank you so much
for the fish bowl.

1447
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,080
Thanks?
Are you mad or something? - No..

1448
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,760
This looks cuter.

1449
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,040
Nice, it looks great.
- Thank you.

1450
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,400
Aren't we leaving?
- Yes.

1451
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,800
See you soon.
Bye!

1452
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,640
Battees, bye!
- Bye!

1453
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,800
Come, let's go.

1454
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,400
Enjoy..

1455
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,360
Battees?
- Yes? - Stop!

1456
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,400
Thank you!
Thank you, so much!

1457
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,960
Had you been a girl,
I would have married you.

1458
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:13,280
Well, your fantasy is fine,
but I have preferences too.

1459
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,400
Okay, enjoy.
Bye-bye!

1460
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,960
Drive safe.
- Don't worry.

1461
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,560
After my exams,
we'll go for a night out.

1462
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:39,760
Udayan..
What a nice name!

1463
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,280
I find my name quite boring.

1464
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,840
Shouldn't we have the right
to choose our names?

1465
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,600
In line 1 and 3..
- Which name would you choose?

1466
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,960
It's so fun to be with Gaja.

1467
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,600
We have loads of fun.

1468
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,960
Why don't you join us?

1469
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,880
He's my brother, not a friend.

1470
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,960
Tell me the password.
- It is..

1471
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:39,240
Password is 'I am where you are'.
Right!

1472
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,960
Everyone, sit down!
Hey!

1473
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,880
Sir, I'm here.
You can speak now.

1474
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,800
Wow! Everyone is
in the class today?

1475
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:52,200
Sir, Battees told us
there's free Wi-Fi in class.

1476
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,840
Free Wi-Fi?

1477
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,280
What next?

1478
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:01,400
WhatsApp? Facebook?
Twitter?

1479
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,040
'Attending history lecture
with 17 others?'

1480
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,960
You'll get some likes.
Girls will get even more likes.

1481
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,960
Get out! - What?
- Get out!

1482
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,800
After this I'll conduct
a History lecture for 50 minutes.

1483
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,320
Those who want to pass time,
disturb the class, use WhatsApp..

1484
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,240
Get out now.

1485
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,040
You, idiot!
Get up.

1486
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,280
He's calling you.
- Battees, I'm asking you. Get up..

1487
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,160
Me?
- Get out now!

1488
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,960
Don't be seen for 8 days.
- We'll meet outside.

1489
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,160
Hello, I'll call you back.
Bye!

1490
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,240
Today, I want you
to answer a question.

1491
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,960
What was the name of the first
school started by Savitribai Phule?

1492
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,840
Can you tell me?

1493
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:03,960
Or you?

1494
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,480
What was the name of the first
school started by Savitribai Phule?

1495
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,840
Don't have anything to say?

1496
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,520
I know you don't like
studying history.

1497
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,080
Because nobody taught it to you
properly.

1498
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,880
I am ready to teach you
with all my energy.

1499
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:33,080
I promise you
that all lectures from today

1500
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,920
will be fun filled.

1501
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,440
I'll teach you more than
what's mentioned in this book.

1502
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,960
Do you want to learn history?
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1503
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,920
Louder!
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1504
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,960
Make a WhatsApp group
called 'History Makers'.

1505
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,960
I want each one of you
in that group.

1506
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,640
I'll tell you about history.

1507
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,040
Let's go.

1508
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,440
Narayan, you go. I'll handle this.

1509
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,520
What happened?
- Sir, look at this.

1510
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,680
The college is not permitting us
to celebrate valentine's day.

1511
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,680
So? - At least chocolate day
should be permitted.

1512
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,800
Yes..
- Why do you need a chocolate day?

1513
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,680
Sir, we need it.
Please, sir..

1514
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,680
Please, sir!
Sir!

1515
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:41,080
Ababa, come on.
- Aunt, is this your surprise?

1516
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,800
Mom brings me here all the time.

1517
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,080
I know that.

1518
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,440
But this time,
Ms. Baby has a new lot. Come on!

1519
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,680
Lot?
- Yes.

1520
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,800
Aunt, listen..

1521
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,400
Come on! - But..
- Don't worry, I'm with you.

1522
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,920
I heartily congratulate you.

1523
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:57,840
See, these two found each other.

1524
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,760
The next name is..

1525
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,560
Oh, no!
Gajanan Kulkarni.

1526
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:06,520
Gajanan Kulkarni, age 33..
- Hold on.. I'll tell them.

1527
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,960
I am Gajanan Kulkarni, age 33,
I have a master's degree.

1528
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,680
My salary is Rs. 25,000 per month
and I don't own a four-wheeler.

1529
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,560
Finished?
- Yes, now you are done.

1530
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,080
The next name is..

1531
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:24,240
Parnarekha Mendale!
Parnarekha Mendale!

1532
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,720
Please come to the stage.

1533
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,800
Parnarekha Mendale..

1534
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,440
Age 30 years,
she has a master's degree.

1535
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:45,800
Her salary is Rs. 35,000 per month,
height 5 feet 4 inches..

1536
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,400
Complexion is fair.

1537
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:51,960
Aunt..

1538
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:55,720
Thank you.

1539
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,680
And I'm really sorry.
- What for?

1540
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,360
You had to come there
because of me.

1541
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,480
You had to be presented
in front of everyone.

1542
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,320
I realised how it feels
when I saw it for myself.

1543
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,680
Forget it now.
Sit down..

1544
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:19,320
You have settled down well.
To tell you the truth..

1545
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:24,600
Your house makes even me jealous.
- Come on, Aunt.

1546
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,360
Really! Even I wanted to do
a lot of such things.

1547
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,040
I wanted to stay alone

1548
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,440
where I would have to make tea
only for myself.

1549
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,120
I wanted to read a lot of books.

1550
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,960
I loved books more than my life.

1551
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,840
Whenever we got pocket money
in our childhood

1552
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,640
your mother would go watch
Rajendra Kumar's movie!

1553
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,960
And I used to buy books.

1554
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:49,640
I would finish books like
'Fountain head' in a single go.

1555
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,440
Really?
- Yes.

1556
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,960
Then?
- Then, I got married.

1557
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,560
Then, the books which I would
finish in six hours

1558
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:01,960
would drag on for two days.

1559
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,280
Then for eight days,
then a month, then six months.

1560
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,320
I lost interest after a while.

1561
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,800
I had books from
our local library for three years.

1562
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:16,840
I returned them with a penalty,
but couldn't read even one.

1563
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,400
After that I left buying books.

1564
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,840
I have time and money,
but the interest in no more.

1565
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,560
It just vanished.
The moral of the story is

1566
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,080
you shouldn't let
your interests die.

1567
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,480
Like this house, you should keep it
safe in your heart.

1568
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,160
For yourself.

1569
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,680
Aunt, what happened?

1570
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,800
Nothing.

1571
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,920
After what I saw
at the marriage bureau today..

1572
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,400
No!
You live life the way you want.

1573
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:57,680
Thank you.

1574
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,320
I have something for you.
- What?

1575
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,360
Wait.

1576
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,880
Take this.
It's a brilliant book.

1577
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,160
Start reading it at once.
- Okay.

1578
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,680
Whose book is this?

1579
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,480
Mom had sent me my trunk
when she was upset.

1580
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,000
It was in that.
Must be hers.

1581
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,560
No way!
It's my book.

1582
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,080
Oh! - I was reading this book,
when you uncle came to see me.

1583
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,920
Your mother had
snatched it away from me.

1584
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,840
Aunt, which story were you reading?

1585
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,720
Gajanan!
- Antara!

1586
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,720
Hi!
- Hi!

1587
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,360
Tomorrow is my first exam.
- Is it? - Wish me luck!

1588
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:10,280
Come inside first.

1589
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,240
Say 'all the best' at least.
- Well..

1590
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,040
All the best.
- Thank you.

1591
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:17,360
May I leave?
- Okay.

1592
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,040
Antara, wait.. - No, I'll be late.
- I've got something.

1593
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,120
Gaja!
- Yes.

1594
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,480
I missed you.

1595
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,560
Hey, Battees!
Where's your costume?

1596
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,880
What's all this?
- It's history day.

1597
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:16,840
Nice! Nice!

1598
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,040
Bapu..

1599
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,800
Amar, what have you become?

1600
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,160
Bhuvan from the movie 'Lagaan'.
- Move aside.

1601
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,320
Did you pay the triple tax?

1602
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,400
Sit down.

1603
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:45,600
I feel so good.

1604
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,880
You all look really nice.

1605
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,120
In your historical get-ups.

1606
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,160
You must be wondering
why I'm not dressed up.

1607
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,960
Because history is
not a fancy dress competition.

1608
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,680
I asked you to bring something
from history.

1609
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:04,120
You brought their clothes,
but their thoughts?

1610
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,360
What about them?

1611
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,080
The thing is..

1612
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,320
The definition of history
has been altered.

1613
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:15,640
For us, history comprises of
only events and dates.

1614
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,480
Then we argue over those dates.

1615
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,880
We turn historical places
into picnic spots.

1616
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,360
Lover's names carved on monuments
and trash lying around

1617
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,600
and stickers behind cars that read
'Emperor Shivaji, come back.'

1618
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,960
Why?
For all of this?

1619
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,600
And all these people
in our history.

1620
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,640
Nobody is more unlucky
than them in our country.

1621
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,520
I never said that,
but the poet 'Kusumagraj' did.

1622
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:45,920
We build their statues,
but never adopt their virtues.

1623
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,760
While pursuing my master's degree
I would always wonder..

1624
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:52,720
All the other countries have a past
but none of them has history.

1625
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:58,360
We have such a rich history,
yet we're not proud of it.

1626
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:01,440
Everyone fights due to the past.

1627
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:05,160
But nobody implements what
we learn from history for future.

1628
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,400
Can you imagine the grief
those people feel

1629
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,280
who have actually lived
and respected their history?

1630
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,720
No, right?
Tell me.

1631
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,440
History is not past or the future.

1632
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:26,680
It's the present.

1633
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,360
You have tolerated me
for six months.

1634
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,480
I am thankful for that.

1635
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:52,440
I wanted to say all these things
to someone since eight years.

1636
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,760
I don't know

1637
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,640
if I'll ever meet you again

1638
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,440
or if I'll teach you again.

1639
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,760
But I want to say one thing
from the bottom of my heart.

1640
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:08,960
Thank you.

1641
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,440
Thank you so much.

1642
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:16,080
This is my last lecture.

1643
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,240
I am not going to teach you
anything today.

1644
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,560
You can celebrate this History day
as you please.

1645
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,160
You wreaked havoc!

1646
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,600
Who even are you?

1647
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,920
Sir, the day when you threw me
out of your class

1648
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:19,120
I had saluted you inwardly.

1649
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,600
But it's time for me to do this.

1650
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,760
Hey!
Silly boy.

1651
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:29,120
Sir, let's go.
Come on!

1652
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,360
What is all this?

1653
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,280
Louder!

1654
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:07,200
Sir! - Sir!
- Sir..

1655
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,240
Parnarekha!

1656
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:23,680
How are you?
- Fine.

1657
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,520
I was here to meet you.

1658
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,480
Sorry, I think I spoke..
- You said what was necessary.

1659
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,640
Even then and even today.

1660
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,000
In the past few days
I had realised something

1661
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,280
and wanted to share it with you.

1662
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,320
Tell me.

1663
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,520
Marriage is not like a scarf.

1664
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,040
I was wrong..
Very wrong.

1665
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,360
I tried to control you.

1666
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:57,800
But do you know what?

1667
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:02,760
You're the only guy who rejected me
by telling me the true reason.

1668
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:07,760
I was a control freak.

1669
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,920
I was boring.

1670
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,800
The reason is I'm scared of things.

1671
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:19,240
I can't think of a life without
being dependent on someone.

1672
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:25,520
Do you know what? I haven't visited
the monastery in two months.

1673
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,480
I had called up Battees
couple of times.

1674
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,960
I don't know if I can be
a YZ like you guys.

1675
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:43,880
But maybe if I get a guy like you
I'll lead a normal life perhaps.

1676
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:49,680
Come closer.

1677
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,960
Come on, I won't eat you up.

1678
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:02,600
Coolfie?

1679
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,600
Coolfie?
- Cool selfie?

1680
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,680
Okay.

1681
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,240
Look into the camera.

1682
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,560
Smile!

1683
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:27,280
Since when are you talking
to Parnarekha in secret?

1684
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,880
I'm asking you something!

1685
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,400
I know.
Cool down!

1686
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:35,280
Since the time she saw you
at the marriage bureau.

1687
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,440
She contacted me

1688
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,640
and asked if she is that bad.

1689
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,640
I try to explain it to her

1690
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,600
that she shouldn't look for God
in a person she'll marry.

1691
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:47,960
She liked what I said.

1692
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,640
Did you tell her everything?

1693
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:53,080
About YZ,
and the three types of love.

1694
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,960
First of all,
what is the third type?

1695
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,720
Why do you want to know?

1696
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,400
Okay, let me tell you.
Extra knowledge isn't bad.

1697
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,320
The third type is a couple

1698
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,120
is that you meet a random person

1699
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,640
and in an instance you feel that
this person is made for you.

1700
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:13,720
Everything they do
feels like heaven.

1701
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,800
Sir, you and Parnarekha
are that kind.

1702
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:18,960
Made for each other.

1703
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:34,040
Sir, don't humiliate me.
I've promised her.

1704
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,040
And why did you do that?

1705
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:40,280
'Take your own decisions
and be responsible for it.'

1706
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,440
These are your words,
isn't it?

1707
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,040
That is what I'm doing.

1708
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,320
I can take my own decisions.

1709
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:46,920
And no one can change that.

1710
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:48,880
Not even you.

1711
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,280
'Open your mouth..
Ha! Ha! Ha!'

1712
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,200
Hi!

1713
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:18,120
Yes, Antara.

1714
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:31,160
D-Do you think
we should call Aarti too? - Yes.

1715
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:35,280
How was your exam?

1716
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:37,400
Amazing!

1717
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:39,760
Okay.

1718
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,760
Don't get shocked.

1719
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,040
It's the first time for me too.
- Did you fail in the exam?

1720
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,360
No!

1721
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,480
Sit down.

1722
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:08,800
What is this?

1723
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,520
Open it, silly.

1724
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,320
How is it?

1725
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,560
Antara, what is this?

1726
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:28,280
I like you.

1727
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:31,560
I love you.

1728
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:50,600
I'm sure this isn't an infatuation.

1729
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,640
I'm too old for that now.

1730
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:54,480
I'm really serious about..
- Antara.

1731
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,760
You should go home, please.

1732
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:00,400
Okay.

1733
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:03,640
Let me get this right.

1734
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:09,040
I'm not so connected to my parents.

1735
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,120
I don't enjoy spending time
with them.

1736
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:15,040
I can't talk to them openly,
can't share anything.

1737
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:18,400
I have lot of friends.

1738
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:23,840
But among all,
who really understands me

1739
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:26,240
and gets along with me

1740
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,280
is only you.

1741
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:43,440
Say that you love me too.

1742
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,480
I really like you a lot.

1743
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:49,320
Just the way you are.

1744
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,400
I might act all haughty

1745
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,160
but I'm messed up inside.

1746
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,320
You need someone's support
at such times.

1747
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:35,720
Antara..
- Yes.

1748
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,760
You've changed the way
my world went around.

1749
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:43,240
You are the first girl who rested
her head on my shoulder.

1750
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:49,320
You are the first girl
who looked at me romantically.

1751
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:55,560
You are the first girl to hug me.

1752
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,480
All this is too precious for me.

1753
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:01,920
Then?

1754
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,640
This letter and this night..

1755
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,120
I'll preserve it all my life.

1756
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:10,720
What else?

1757
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,280
Antara, please don't get me wrong.

1758
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:19,320
There is a category of men
who exploit the feelings of girls.

1759
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,400
I'm not one of those.

1760
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,360
Of course, I know that.

1761
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:26,560
That's the reason I've decided
that we should get married.

1762
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,920
What are you saying?

1763
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:34,400
Look, I never got to
make a choice

1764
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:35,920
about what I like.

1765
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:40,080
I don't want to live
my life in regret.

1766
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:42,920
I want to live my life
on my own terms.

1767
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,040
We'll wait for another four years.

1768
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:49,440
At that point, I'll be 24 years old
and you'll be 37 years old.

1769
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:50,360
Is that fine?

1770
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:54,000
This is too odd for me. I can't.
- What is odd about it?

1771
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,840
My grandma says Dilip Kumar
was 15 years older

1772
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:58,480
to Saira Banu..
- Which example

1773
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,000
are you even quoting?
- George Clooney and Amal

1774
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,080
have a difference of 21 years.

1775
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,640
Kareena had worn a frock
to Saif Ali Khan's first marriage.

1776
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:08,200
Madonna's boyfriend is younger
than her daughter.

1777
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:10,520
I have downloaded a whole list.
- I can't do this.

1778
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:18,440
Hold on.

1779
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:22,560
Why should one bother about
what will the society say.

1780
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:29,400
Rather than being the same age
but old school

1781
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,840
one should rather be old
but young at heart.

1782
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,480
That's very happening! Right..
- Antara..

1783
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,640
Please, go home.

1784
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:11,560
Why is the play's name
'Svapnavasavadatta'?

1785
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,240
I've told you..
- I want to hear it again, please.

1786
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,960
While resting in his house
on the sea-shore

1787
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:23,920
Udayana calls out for Vasavadatta
in his sleep.

1788
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:26,520
Coincidently, Vasavadatta
happens to come there.

1789
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,400
She gently picks up his hand

1790
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,800
which has slipped off his bed
and places it back.

1791
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:36,640
Till the end Udayana cannot decide
whether this was real

1792
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,120
or his dream.

1793
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,440
That's why the play
was named as 'Swapna'..

1794
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:54,360
Antara..

1795
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:02,840
You really had come to
my house the other day, didn't you?

1796
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:05,640
I don't know.

1797
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,920
But I found the answer
to my question.

1798
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,480
'Antara.'

1799
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,080
'To be honest she is right.'

1800
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,960
'But I got scared for a moment.'

1801
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:32,240
'She is haughty
but there's an honesty about it'

1802
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,400
'which would suffice
for both our lives.'

1803
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,760
'Oh, my God!
What should I do?'

1804
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,160
'Should I choose Antara
or Parnarekha?'

1805
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,840
Parnanrekha has started clicking
pictures with pouts now. - So?

1806
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:49,400
So, will she pout all her life?

1807
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,360
I thought you had
made your decision.

1808
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,200
Be responsible for it.

1809
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,160
This is the time.

1810
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:01,720
Yes, Tondya.

1811
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:03,720
Is it ready?

1812
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,200
Hold on, I'll be there.
Don't inaugurate.

1813
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:07,120
Okay.

1814
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:09,240
Where you going?

1815
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,080
I've organised
a blood donation camp.

1816
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,920
You are upset right now. Or else,
I would have asked you to donate.

1817
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,120
See you.

1818
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:23,640
Shalaka!
Listen!

1819
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,080
Come here, dear.

1820
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:27,720
Coming!

1821
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,440
Hey, drama queen!
- You are!

1822
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,160
What are you doing it for?
- You are..

1823
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:33,640
Tell me.
- You are a drama queen.

1824
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,280
Is it?
- Drama queen!

1825
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,320
Drama queen..
- My sweet child!

1826
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:39,240
Okay, then.
- Look at him.

1827
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:40,720
He's my friend.

1828
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,280
Hi!

1829
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:50,760
When will you finish building this?

1830
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,760
S-Sayali!

1831
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:58,760
Ask him what is his name?

1832
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:01,120
Sir, what is your name?

1833
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:04,760
I'm Gajanan Kulkarni!

1834
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,240
Ababa!

1835
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:09,720
From Wai!

1836
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,960
Yes.
- Oh, my! Gaja!

1837
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,200
Come over..

1838
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:16,240
F-Fourth floor,
flat number 403.

1839
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:17,440
Khare's house.

1840
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,400
Quick. Oh, my!
Gaja!

1841
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:21,600
He's my best friend from childhood.

1842
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,880
Come on..

1843
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:34,520
You have to finish
your juice and breakfast.

1844
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,600
Got it?

1845
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:38,000
Be comfortable.

1846
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:41,440
Sorry, the house is a mess.
- No, it's okay.

1847
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:45,640
Please have it.

1848
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,640
How are you?

1849
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,000
I'm good.

1850
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:54,280
Gaja, are you an engineer?

1851
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:57,200
No. - Then what do you do there,
in that building?

1852
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:58,640
That's nothing.

1853
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:00,600
Do you know
the Dadasaheb Joshi College?

1854
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,880
Yes.
- I'm a professor over there.

1855
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:06,440
You are professor?
- Yes.

1856
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:07,960
Good!

1857
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:15,200
Where were you?
- Actually..

1858
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:18,320
After we left Wai,
we moved to Pune.

1859
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,360
From there we moved
to Trivandrum

1860
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,640
and then Dehradun,
then Delhi.

1861
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:26,320
Don't ask. We were travelling
all over due to dad's transfers.

1862
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:28,400
I still live in Wai.

1863
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:36,760
I used to always see Wai in films.
- Yes.

1864
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,040
I used to miss you so much then.

1865
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:41,640
Is it?
- Do you visit our usual place?

1866
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,400
It's prohibited during the shoots.

1867
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:47,160
If there is no shoot,
they let us go to that place.

1868
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:48,480
Gaja!

1869
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:50,280
Gaja!

1870
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:52,680
Shooting..

1871
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:00,120
Hey! Don't play with the food.
Eat your breakfast.

1872
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,720
She's exactly like you.

1873
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:06,960
No difference at all.

1874
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:13,760
Sayali..
- Yes.

1875
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:16,840
It's been 20 years.

1876
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:21,600
I thought I would never meet you.

1877
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:23,960
But you are right in front of me.

1878
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,120
Some time back I had met her.

1879
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,120
Gadgil.
- Who?

1880
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:31,320
Minty,
who used to wear two ponytails.

1881
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:34,320
Minty? - Everyone used to
tease you with her.

1882
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,480
No way!
Everyone used to tease me with you.

1883
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,680
Is it?
- Yes.

1884
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:45,080
Hey! Shailesh, you are late.
Don't you have to leave? - Yes.

1885
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,920
We have time.
- I've packed the bags.

1886
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,920
I've put them in the car. - Hello!
- What's up? - You did not tell..

1887
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:52,880
You wanted the cabin bag.
- It's there inside.

1888
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,160
Hey, hi!
- Hey!

1889
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,520
Shailesh, this is Gajanan.
- Hi, Gajanan! - Hello!

1890
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,040
I'm Shailesh.
- Nice to meet you.

1891
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:00,960
Same here.

1892
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,320
Well, you guys carry on.
I've to leave.

1893
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,040
Okay.
- Gaja, give me two minutes.

1894
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:08,280
Shailesh, give me a call
once you reach. - Yes.

1895
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,280
And I've kept the charger
in the bag. - Okay.

1896
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:13,280
Ask her to eat this.
We've to leave. - Okay.

1897
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:15,840
Gaja..
- I'll take your leave.

1898
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,920
Hey!
- No, I'll leave.

1899
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,040
Look, I'm eating..
- Wait a while.

1900
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:25,840
'Sayali..'

1901
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,320
'I always believed,
what you always wish for'

1902
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:31,880
'never comes true.'

1903
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:33,520
'But not anymore.'

1904
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,320
'Because I met you.'

1905
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:39,240
'The most beautiful highlight
from the match called my life.'

1906
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,720
'Sayali..'

1907
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:44,720
Shailesh seems nice.

1908
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,160
True.

1909
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,040
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.

1910
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:51,640
It's nothing.

1911
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:53,240
Tell me.

1912
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:55,240
I got a divorce last year.

1913
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,840
I mean, I and Rahul got separated.

1914
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:04,120
There was no love between us
anymore.

1915
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,280
My parents couldn't even understand
what my problem was.

1916
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,440
Perhaps I couldn't
explain it to them.

1917
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,480
They've severed all ties with me
ever since.

1918
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:21,160
But since I'd pursued my education
and become an architect

1919
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:22,560
I thought of putting it to use.

1920
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:25,920
I concentrated on my career,
and now, I'm doing great.

1921
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,800
Well..

1922
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:40,960
Who is Shailesh exactly?

1923
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:44,920
A friend of mine.

1924
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:50,080
A friend?
- Yes.

1925
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,360
A really close friend.

1926
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,800
Will you be in town for a while?

1927
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,720
No, I'm going back to Wai.

1928
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:12,080
But, why?
- My work here is done.

1929
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:16,400
Come home for dinner once
before you leave.

1930
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,840
Come on, dear.
Have this.

1931
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:24,000
Didn't you like it?
Take this and come inside.

1932
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:25,680
Don't go outside so often.

1933
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,720
Gaja, no matter
how many pastries we have

1934
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:31,080
nothing beats the coconut sweet
from Prateek's stall.

1935
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:32,400
Am I right?
- Yes.

1936
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,400
Oh, right!
You were saying something.

1937
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,560
It was about those two girls.

1938
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:40,640
Yes, there are two girls.
- Okay.

1939
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:44,360
One's name is Parnarekha
and the other's is Antara. - Okay.

1940
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:48,000
Parnarekha is 29 years old
and Antara is 20.

1941
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:49,440
Gaja!

1942
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:52,960
You're blushing!
- Hey!

1943
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,120
Which one do you like?

1944
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:57,240
The 29 year old, or 20?

1945
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,960
I don't know.
- What do you mean?

1946
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,320
I hope you like one among them.

1947
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:07,880
I like you.

1948
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:11,080
Gaja, please!

1949
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,520
Don't be silly!
What do you mean by that?

1950
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:16,760
Don't be absurd, Gaja!

1951
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:20,400
I'm asking you something
and you're fooling around.

1952
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:21,720
Have it.

1953
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:24,720
Oh, God!
Your face looks serious.

1954
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:28,560
Were you speaking the truth?
- Yes.

1955
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,520
Every thought of mine
ends with you.

1956
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:34,760
Even now..

1957
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:37,520
And you know that.

1958
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,720
Did you never like me?

1959
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:48,680
Shalaka, what are you doing there?
You've made such a mess.

1960
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:51,080
Why have you left things
lying around..

1961
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:16,520
Isn't the garden nice?

1962
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:22,400
But it needs a lot of maintenance,
and Shalaka always hangs out here.

1963
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:26,200
Raising her all alone.. - Have you
ever thought of marrying again?

1964
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:33,600
Oh, my!

1965
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:36,960
G-Gaja, I completely forgot!

1966
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:39,440
I was searching for
my School Leaving Certificate.

1967
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:43,400
I found many old things
while looking for it.

1968
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:47,680
Do you know what I found?
Just look! Wait, I'll show you!

1969
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:01,600
Look!
Just open it and look.

1970
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:05,120
You'll be thrilled.
- I asked you something.

1971
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,720
Have you thought of
getting married again?

1972
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:19,000
You know what, Gaja?

1973
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:25,560
Shailesh is a very good man.

1974
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,840
He's been here with us
since a few months.

1975
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,280
His presence is really helpful.

1976
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:36,600
Once, when Shalaka fell ill,
he came and stayed over.

1977
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:39,920
Running around the hospital,
you know?

1978
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:45,160
Yes, and I also know for a fact

1979
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:48,600
that he would never make
the first move.

1980
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,360
But..

1981
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:55,760
Shalaka likes him very much.

1982
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:59,200
Whom do you like?

1983
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:11,480
I don't know.

1984
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:20,640
'Hey, this is mine!'

1985
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:25,400
'No! No!'

1986
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,000
'Gaja, wait! - Catch me!
- It was still spinning!'

1987
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:35,840
'Give it back!
- 10, 20, 30, 40, 50..'

1988
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:07,800
Hello!
- 'Hello! Hello!' - Sayali!

1989
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:11,120
'Sayali, can you hear me?
It's me, Gajanan!'

1990
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,280
Hello!

1991
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:55,520
'Gaja, I want to buy a car.'

1992
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:58,800
'I want to buy chocolates
worth 200 rupees.'

1993
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:02,640
'I want to eat a cake
worth 35 rupees!'

1994
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:05,840
'I'll start a school of my own.'

1995
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:09,760
'I want to get married
in the temple of the Cow.'

1996
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,480
'I want to see
the seven wonders of the world.'

1997
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:15,200
'Why did I have to find this now?'

1998
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:19,760
'Thing that seem possible
during childhood'

1999
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:23,080
'get forgotten over time
as we grow up.'

2000
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:27,600
'Why did this piece of paper
have to remind me of who I am?'

2001
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:29,520
'An innocent lad'

2002
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:33,640
'who skipped school
and roamed around Wai..'

2003
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,880
'Who wrote in his diary
everyday..'

2004
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:39,360
'Who wet his hair to look stylish
while going to school..'

2005
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:42,640
'Who listened to the same song
till the cassette broke..'

2006
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:44,880
'Who memorised the lyrics..'

2007
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:47,600
'Who read fairytale books
till dawn..'

2008
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:51,400
'Who set out everyday to look
for new places and people..'

2009
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,240
'Who was never afraid of
going wrong'

2010
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:57,200
'and who gathered experiences
and treasured them.'

2011
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,840
'That's who I was.'

2012
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,880
I understand that you're upset.

2013
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:09,200
But I've made up my mind.

2014
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:15,240
I agree that you cannot host
a grand ceremony like the rest do.

2015
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:21,200
People might make many assumptions
and gossip about it.

2016
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,800
But I want to take this plunge.

2017
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:29,120
Dad..

2018
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,000
I'm not okay with this.

2019
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:57,640
Hey, lad! - Yes.
- Did you get only yellow flowers?

2020
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:58,480
Don't know who got them.

2021
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:01,880
I told you to get colourful flowers
and you got these!

2022
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:05,800
Oh, wow! Looking great!
- Thank you!

2023
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:07,240
I guess it's for Mr. Gajanan.
- Yes.

2024
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:09,640
She'll never change.

2025
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:18,160
Antara, here's the anointed rice.
Where's Mr. Gajanan?

2026
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,160
Oh, right!

2027
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,880
Please bring the groom here.
- Sure, right away.

2028
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,440
Sir!
- Yes?

2029
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,800
Let's go, the groom is expected.
Come on. - Come on.

2030
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:31,360
Are all the arrangements made?
- Yes. - Hi! - Hi!

2031
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,160
The wedding is solemnised.

2032
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:07,480
'Today, after six months,
I'm surrounded by dear ones.'

2033
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:12,200
'They have given me so much
to strive for in life.'

2034
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:15,800
'We come across many people'

2035
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:18,600
'but very few make us realise
who we are.'

2036
02:17:19,680 --> 02:17:22,120
'All these people
were the same to me.'

2037
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,640
'Each one of them.'

2038
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:44,360
Thanks for coming, Parnarekha.

2039
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:48,320
I was mad at you first.

2040
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,360
I felt bad too.

2041
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:55,800
But then I thought of attending
since you had invited.

2042
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:00,720
So, I guess this is goodbye then.

2043
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:19,000
It's the offertory from
Wai's Dholya Ganesha.

2044
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:23,520
Thank you.

2045
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:28,360
Shall I get going then?

2046
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:32,040
See you.

2047
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:48,120
I'll be around.

2048
02:18:56,560 --> 02:18:58,080
Antara..
- Get lost!

2049
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:03,080
I'm not liking the way
you're behaving.

2050
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:08,040
You're rejecting me
just to prove yourself right.

2051
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:13,200
And don't tell me rubbish like
'let's remain friends'.

2052
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:15,640
I don't want to be friends
with you.

2053
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:22,160
We're better off this way.
- I like the name Siddharth.

2054
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:24,400
And had I not been teaching here

2055
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:26,360
I would still be doing the same
what I'm about to do now.

2056
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:31,600
I considered this thought
just because of you, Antara.

2057
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:35,240
Why are you treating me this way?

2058
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,560
Because you matter a lot to me.

2059
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:41,640
Bye.

2060
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,160
Hello, sir!

2061
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:15,240
Battees, are you crying?
- What! No!

2062
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:21,880
Sir, you really wreaked havoc
in there.

2063
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:27,200
Take this.
- What's this?

2064
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:30,040
100 percent cash back.
I had given you my word.

2065
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:44,000
Bye, sir!

2066
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,640
I had never imagined
we would say goodbye.

2067
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:52,680
See you.

2068
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:02,320
Sir, either I will miss you
or I will join you.

2069
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:08,800
"I'm the pale sunlight
that casts no shadows."

2070
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:17,200
"I'm the music that exists
even without a tune."

2071
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:25,560
