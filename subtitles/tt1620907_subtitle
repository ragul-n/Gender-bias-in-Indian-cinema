5
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:53,378
Greetings.

l'll shoW you my village Palanhar.
Come.

7
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,779
Don't stop. lt's Written 800,
but it's only 200 Kms. aWay.

8
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,259
Don't be scared.
Nothing Will happen.

9
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:11,521
Are you fine?

10
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:13,692
These are stupid dogs
of our village.

11
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,293
They can't differentiate betWeen
kin and stranger.

12
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:19,495
They don't knoW Whom
to bite and chase.

13
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:22,404
Come, l'll shoW you Palanhar.

14
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,306
The road is dusty,
so be determined.

15
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,541
There is confusion about the
geography of this village..

16
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,810
..Whether it's in Uttar
Pradesh or Bihar.

17
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,118
There is confusion of just
the postal address.

18
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:38,115
Anyway, Wherever it's, it can't
be seen on lndian map.

19
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,528
You Won't find there. Return.

20
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,757
And this is the first landmark
of our village.

21
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,431
Jhangamal confectioner,
the only and historic sWeet shop.

22
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:52,198
These sWeets are highly praised..

23
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:58,205
..Which faces storms,
rain, dust and pests.

24
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,174
Once these sWeets are made
and escape from people..

25
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,574
..then they live here easily
for 6-8 months.

26
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,276
And later they're used as
stones during fights.

27
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:10,556
Come. This is the broadcast
centre of our village.

28
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,757
Sure remedy for piles.

29
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:17,653
Along With piles,
other diseases are also cured..

30
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,758
..With just one pills
by herb-doctor.

31
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,564
Patient should contact soon.

32
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,397
Uncle, this is for you.

33
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,195
Our government is unjust..

34
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,634
..as the herb-doctor Who treats
all the diseases..

35
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,270
..With just one pill
isn't honored yet.

36
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,080
Our country is just great!

37
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,172
Come.

38
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:38,717
The living beings of this
village are Worth seeing.

39
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:40,380
They've made my life hell.

40
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:41,750
He keeps asking questions.

41
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:44,486
Priest,
What are you doing and eating?

42
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:47,219
Where are you coming from?
HoW is sister-in-laW?

43
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:51,491
Who came?
Who left? l can't see the buffalo.

44
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:54,790
When l Went to ansWer the
call of nature he asked..

45
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,731
..Where are you going and
When Will you return.

46
00:05:58,104 --> 00:05:59,696
l told him l'm going
to plough the field.

47
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:04,966
These there are problems even
in natural processes.

48
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,171
Priest, l don't understand Who
is asking Whom and What.

49
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,112
l've been screaming for long!

50
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:16,019
l'm talking of Dubey's father Who
lives opposite to our house.

51
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,647
His sons has made their 90 years..

52
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,351
..old father lie outside on bed.

53
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,558
He has no Work..

54
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:25,464
..so he looks at our house and
keeps asking questions.

55
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,224
Why are you screaming?
What happened?

56
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,435
Why are you screaming here?

57
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,467
Shout in front of Dubey's house.

58
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:34,234

the ladies of Dubey's house?

60
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,644
So is it nice to scream
in front of us? -Yes.

61
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:44,309
l'd like to inform that he's
my respected father..

62
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:45,612
..Sankata Prasad Tripathi.

63
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,550
He's alWays furious.

64
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,217
He vents out his anger
on anyone and anytime.

65
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,289
Don't croWd here noW.

66
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:55,653

Let's go. -Go and do your Work.

69
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,229
Our country might be

70
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,533
..dearth When it comes

73
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,335
lt's a good thing.

74
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,604
And villagers entertain
themselves..

75
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,273
..by pulling each other's legs.

76
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,746
Uncle, do you Want something?

00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:54,567
You'll never say anything
auspicious.

127
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:58,005
You're old,
but you've not learnt manners.

128
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:01,639
You can't do anything properly,
at least talk properly.

129
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:06,512
My Devaki has topped in
his college. -Father.

There Won't be anything

Be smart like your father. -Yes.

155
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,414
Devaki,

Son, l've keep all the different
pickles in different boxes.

158

00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:29,257
l'm talking of pickles boxes
not of train coaches.

160
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,326
Be careful, son.

161
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:32,564

00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:45,262
lt's useful to the
people of Mumbai.

922
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:48,368
Even Akbar and Birbal used to
come here With girl friends.

923
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:52,003
Salman and Shahrukh come
here every evening.

924
00:58:53,443 --> 00:58:55,240
You Were supposed to take
us to the temple.

925

You call this vulgarity love.

Look at Devaki and Mithlesh.
That's called civilization.

932
00:59:20,637 --> 00:59:21,661
What are you doing?

..but if they love here,
it's not right.

Open it.

1001
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:50,699
What happened, father?
-What a city!

1002
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:53,298
There is nothing like
civilization here.

1003
01:04:54,037 --> 01:04:57,165
There is only insolent
people all around.

1004
01:04:57,507 --> 01:04:59,737
And this Madan Ghachak is the
biggest insolent of all.

1005
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:03,504
God knoWs he took us to
shoW profanity. Oh God!

01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:13,579
We're returning.

1011

We Won't stay in Khachak's house.

01:05:22,098 --> 01:05:23,793
We'll come When you'll
buy your oWn house.

1015
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:26,668
Father, you're angry for no
reason. -He's not such a man.

1016
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:28,704
Dear, don't teach your father.

1017
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:30,399
He has seen the World.

1018
01:05:30,473 --> 01:05:32,134
And Whatever Was left

Father, can l say something?

1020
01:05:35,812 --> 01:05:39,009
NoW my World is With him.

1021
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:41,813
lt's not right to accompany
only in good times.

1022
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:45,344
So bless us that When
you return again..

1023
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:47,685
..you should come to our house.

1024

01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:04,335
Mother, but it'll take tWo days
to book the train tickets.

1030

We'll go Without reservation.

1031
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:18,447

We don't understand the
Ways of your cities.

1808
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:40,378
We live our lives With emotions,
not With logics. -But sir..

1809
01:45:40,447 --> 01:45:44,747
..you've taught us it's vital

We Were in trouble.

1813
01:45:54,995 --> 01:45:58,453
Sir, these relationships aren't

..and We fulfilled
our relationships.

1819

lf you talk so emotionally,
l can never nab any criminal.

1820
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:27,584
Let it be.

1821

Tell me, hoW did you get this
idea of collecting evidence?

1822

01:46:34,401 --> 01:46:37,802
lf people can marry under Water,
in air..

1824
01:46:38,038 --> 01:46:39,437
Then Why not in police station?

1825
01:46:40,507 --> 01:46:41,531

1839
01:47:15,709 --> 01:47:18,769
Sir,
Why did you let them go so easily?

1842
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:24,549
..What Would We've done in court?

1843
01:47:25,285 --> 01:47:27,185
But they learnt one thing.

1844
01:47:27,421 --> 01:47:29,685
NoW in their village nobody Will

Can We ever forget Khote?

1866
01:48:52,005 --> 01:48:53,302
