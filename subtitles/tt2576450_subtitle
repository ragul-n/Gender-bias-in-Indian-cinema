1
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:51,712
Can l ask you something?

2
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,687
All that cash...
America...Switzerland..

3
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:56,480
What exactly is 'Hawala'
(Money Laundering)

4
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:59,489
Just like Money Exchange
for White Money.

5
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,750
Similarly for
transferring black money..

6
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:02,386
..there's 'Hawala' (Money Laundering).

7
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:04,390
Magic.

8
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:07,326
You pay us here and.. Poof!

9
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,633
lt's transferred to Switzerland.

10
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:16,277
100 million, it's all here.

11
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:18,804
Excellent.

12
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,338
Two hours later, 90 million..

13
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,610
..will be transferred
in your Swiss Bank account.

14
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:24,010
Why only 90 million?

15
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:25,978
10 million our commission.

16
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,315
Have pity.

17
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,485
l've been newly appointed
as the minister.

18
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,924
You should have pity
on your state too.

19
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,634
You've been newly appointed minister.

20
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,459
90 million in 15 days
is not a small amount.

21
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,882
Stop the car.

22
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:18,928
Where are you coming from?

23
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,472
Ambala.

24
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,507
And where are you headed?

25
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,542
Chandigarh.

26
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,301
Chandigarh!

27
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:26,844
And what's in the trunk?

28
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,409
Speak up.

29
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,317
The trunk's open.

00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,322
Bravo. Come, Rambo.

32
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,295
Who am l?

33
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,833
Bheem Singh Chandel!

34
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:25,668
Why did you stop my car?
- l received a tip from control room..

35
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,402
..that this is a stolen car?

36
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,276
The tip was right.

37
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,671
Let me go.

38
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:33,712
Let me go.

39
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:35,881
You didn't let me go.

40
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:52,027
Sir, what do you
want me to do with it?

41
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,732
lncinerate it!

42
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:56,529
Don't leave behind a single piece.

43
00:04:56,705 --> 00:05:00,664
But, sir's, this is a brand new car.

44
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,435
The police are looking for it.

45
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:05,704

46
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,916
What now?.
- Arrange for a new car.

47
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:11,350
This time from a different state.

48
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:15,548
Sir, l know a guy who's a pro.

49
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:20,987
He can steal cars like
stealing candy from a baby.

50
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,867
Where can l find him?
- Delhi.

51
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,526
How much longer, Babli?

52
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:01,292
l'm unlocking the steering, T2!

53
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:02,334
Be patient!

54
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,243
What the..

55
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:21,587

Hey, watchman!

57
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,956
Watchman!

58
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:28,326
Watchman!

62
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:56,387
Watchman, who's car is this?

63

00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,824
Go wake him up!
What's this nonsense!

65
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:06,734
Mr. Sharma..
- Hey!

66
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,359
My sleep's ruined.
- Whose inside the car?

67
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:09,401
Who's driving it?

68
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,938
Watchman, come here.
- Watchman, come here.

69
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,939
Hurry up!

70
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,400
Thief! Catch him. Thief!

71
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:15,543
There he goes.

72
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,305
What do we pay you for?
- Four...three...two..

73
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,346
Come here.

Stop him.
- He'll escape.

75
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,943
Get up, Chautala.

76
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:03,686
Your snoring is creating a ruckus.

77
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,391
lt'll drive all the criminals away.

78
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:06,491
Get up.

79
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:09,256
Let me sleep, dear.

80
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:11,556
Boys are returning
from the disco drunk.

81
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,324
Make some dough.

82
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:14,435
Get up.

83
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:17,266
Shut up. Shut up.

84
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,503
You're always objecting.

85
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,800
Don't talk nonsense.

86
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,341
You married me.

87
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:24,770
You'll have to abide by it.

88
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,277
Just two months left
for your retirement.

89
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:28,879
Make some dough.

90
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:31,445
Otherwise l'll make you regret it.

91
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,414
Someday l'll strangle
you in your sleep.

92
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:35,387
l'll strangle you.

93
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,583
Go on.
- Stupid woman.

94
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,253
Saddiram. l told you to fix this door.

95
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:40,989
Go on.

96
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:46,728
Oh no. Cops!

97
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,631
Stop. Stop.

98
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,475
Take off the glasses.

99
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:09,280
Where are you coming from, son?

100
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:10,858
Office.

101
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:12,384
At this hour?

102
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:14,818
You must be drunk!

103
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:18,923
Your breath smells like onions.

104
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,499
Show me your licence.

105
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:21,466

00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:27,873
Babli..

107
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,409
Babli?

108
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:31,436
What kind of a name is that?

109
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,514
lt's written on the licence,
so it must be true.

110
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:36,748
Acting smart.

111
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:38,883

112
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:40,743

He has no parents.

119
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,292
He was raised in an orphanage.

120
00:09:56,938 --> 00:09:57,927
He's an orphan.

Son, you should've said that before.

You're an orphan and l've no children.

125
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,941
Surprising.
- Surprising, right?

126

Getting romantic.

00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:47,940
Take that. Take that.

160
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:07,720

''You were born nude.''

171
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:15,526
''So what are you ashamed of?''

172
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,555
''No mom, dad or faith.''

173
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,791
''Stern with the wisecracks.''

174
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,768

''We get high and shout shameless.''

188
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,750
''We do all our deeds.''

189
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,582
''Without caring about the price.''

190
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,646
''We never break a promise.''

191
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,853
''We start it and only we end it.''

192
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:24,629
''We'll break all your illusions.''

193
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:28,362
''Come show everyone, be shameless.''

194
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,868
''Open your heart,
stick out your chest, be shameless.''

195
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,566
''Come sway to the beat, be shameless.''

196
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,707
''Open your heart,
stick out your chest, be shameless.''

197
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,587
''Radical! Radical!''

198
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:57,424
''Locking horns is in my blood.''

199
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:59,293
''Abnormal! Abnormal!''

200
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,990
''l'll give everyone
a run for their money.''

201
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:02,769

''l make the world rock with me.''

''We're romantic at heart.''

206
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:19,844
'We dazzle you with our moves.''

207
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:23,286
''First we try to cajole with love.''

208
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:26,958
''Otherwise we declare war.''

209
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:34,292
''Anyone we point at,
gets drawn to me.''

210
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:40,863
''lf we hurt anyone,
we also soothe his pain.''

211
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,772
''We'll snatch you..''

212
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,808
''We'll snatch you from yourself.''

213
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:55,478
''Open your heart,

214
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,420
''Come sway to the beat, be shameless.''

216
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:05,232
''We're unscrupulous.''

217
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:06,890
''We're the devils.''

218
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:10,562
''We get high and shout shameless.''

219
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,366
''We're unscrupulous.''

220
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:14,471
''We're the devils.''

221
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:18,635
''We get high and shout shameless.''

222
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:31,324
Wow!

223
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,291
lt's our new car, ma'am.
Mercedes Benz A-Class.

224
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:35,627
lt's hot.

225
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:36,930
l love it.

226
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,455
Maybe your next car!

227
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,893
But the one you bought,
B-Class, isn't bad either.

228
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:42,299
That's true.

229
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,667
Your lease agreement
papers are ready, ma'am.

230
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:44,895
Let's go then.

231
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:51,311
Thank you.

232
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:53,438
Congratulations, ma'am.
- Thank you.

233
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,989
l'm gonna get you, guys.

234
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,590
Slow down, dear.
- Why, mom?

235
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,958
We're riding a Mercedes!

236
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:10,455
Quiet!

237
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,796
Slow down!

238
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:25,507
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

239
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,476
That's called driving.

240
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:35,722
And people say women can't drive.

241
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:37,947
They're absolutely right.
- Mom.

242
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,691
You can't walk properly,
thank God l bought a car.

243
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,452
This isn't a car.

244
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,791
lt's a short-cut to suicide.

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,989
Oh my!

246
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,499
Just wasting money.

247
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,894
You could've bought a scooter.

248
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,531
Don't you get it?

249
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:54,400
lt's my classmate's wedding.

250
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,403
The entire batch is going to be there.

251
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,577
Trying to teach me!

252
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,541
They all come in expensive cars, mom.

253
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,041
lmported ones.

254
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:02,744
l was the star of my college.

255
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,349
You think l'll go on a scooter?

256
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,277
We need to show-off a little.

257
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:10,423
Girls shouldn't show-off too much.

258
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,487
What's this?
- What?

259
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,318
Mom.
- Try not showing off so much.

260
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:17,826
Why don't you get married too?

261
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,290
With whom?
l need a proper groom.

262
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,296
Do you want me to find one?
- Forget it.

263
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:24,503
You'll just bring another
clerk or accountant..

264
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:25,596
..like you did the last time.

265
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,239
Tara.

266
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,001
Your father was an accountant as well.

267
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,569
But he loved me as much.

268
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,572
Mom, you just don't get it.

269
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:36,614
l want class. Class.

270
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,282
Status. Respect. Position.

271
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,645
Sense of humour.

272
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,757
You want Rahul Gandhi.
- Why not? He's cute.

273
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:45,924
Pardon me. You can find one yourself.

274
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:47,989
l told you.

275
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,927
Not again.

276
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:56,266
Master.
- You're here.

277
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:58,028
Tilu, did you shit again?

278
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:00,030
My child.

279
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,710
That's 50000, master. You can count them.
- l see.

280
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,680
You give all your earnings to us.

281
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:11,341
Save some for yourself, son.

282
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:12,845
What will l do with money?

283
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:13,951
You're there for me.

284
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,479
Now change my underpants.

285
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:18,424
Naughty!

286
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,753
Come on.

287
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:24,628
Stop him.

288
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,358
Get the ball. Get the ball.

289
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:28,991
Stop him.

290
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,995
Get the ball.

291
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,981
So, Pele, you're sc***d.

292
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,418
Come on, handover the lollypop.

293
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,878
Come on...

294
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,029
Babli. You're bound
to get hurt while playing.

295
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:02,427
Babli.

296
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,871
How long will you father
these children alone?

297
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:09,505
They need a mother to look after them.

298
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:12,913
What if they all grow
up to be thieves like you?

299
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,519
Babli. How's this?

300
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,760
Surprising.

301
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,432
T2.
- Yes.

302
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:41,767
Look.

303
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,606
Fine. Let's jack that one.

304
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:48,310
Not the car, look at the driver.

305
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,957
The driver's hot.

306
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,990
Not a single dent all over the body.

307
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:08,935
Mind your language.

308
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:11,266
She's your sister-in-law.

309
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:12,767
Hello, madam.

310
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,533
Your money.

311
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:22,806
No, it's not mine.

312
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:26,475
l see. They're not mine either.

313
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:28,548
Let's share them equally.

314
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,686
lt doesn't belong to anyone.

315
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,384
By the way, what's your name?

316
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,557
You forgot my name so soon?

317
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:39,491
Then surely you don't remember

318
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,658
..my phone number and address either.

319
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:45,370
Look, mister. Whoever you are.

320
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:46,937
This way of asking someone's name..

321
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,871
..through fallen notes is very old.

322
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:50,737
And this hotel's security..

323
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:52,573
..is absolutely fresh from the gym.

324
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:55,881
One call and they'll come
here to show their efficiency.

325
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:58,317
l think you're upset, beautiful.

326
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,650
No.

327
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,445
Actually,
my friend's getting married..

328
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,490
..so l am very happy.

329
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:06,553
But you better get lost.

330
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,286
l could get upset any moment now.

331
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,754
Get it.

332
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,290
By the way, thanks for the compliment.

333
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,367
Men in Black.
She's Mission lmpossible.

334
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,737
You can't win over her!

335
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,040
Want to bet?

336
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,783
Here you go. l lose.

''..stare at me from their windows.''

341
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:12,722
''All the boys in my neighbourhood
stare at me from their windows.''

342
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:16,484
''All the boys in my neighbourhood

343
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,258
''But l fooled everyone

''Don't lie, no one stares at you.''

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,523
''Don't lie, no one stares at you.''

351

''l lost it..''

368
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,728
''l lost it..''

00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:05,463
''l lost my heart,
darling, in your lane.''

370
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:09,335
''l lost my heart,
beauty, in your lane.''

371
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:24,284
''Youth is so brazen.''

372
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:27,857
''Once it passes away,
never comes back.''

373
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:31,795
''Better get lost, you're such a liar.''

374
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:35,493
''There's no truth in your charade.''

375
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:39,331
''Come, let's take this relation further.''

376
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,975
''Let's play the game of love,
come see me on the rooftop.''

377
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:46,608
''l lost my heart,
darling, in your lane.''

378
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:50,441
''l lost my heart,
beauty, in your lane.''

379
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:54,448
''All the boys in my neighbourhood
stare at me from their windows.''

380
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:58,285
''Don't lie, no one stares at you.''

381
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,791
''Whom do you fool and keep saying?''

382
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:05,365
''l lost my heart in your lane.''

383
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,296
''l lost my heart in your lane.''

384
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:12,972
''l lost my heart,
darling, in your lane.''

385
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,839
''l lost my heart,
darling, in your lane.''

386
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:24,241
''We're lovers,
we'll unite the hearts.''

387
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:28,351
''We'll leave you good for nothing.''

388
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:31,581
''You like a good struggle.''

389
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,589
''We're popular for
doing as we please.''

390
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:37,294
''l lost it..''

391
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,764
''l lost it..''

392
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:43,701
''l lost it..''

393
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:44,996
''l lost it..''

394

''l lost it..''

396
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,441
''l lost it..''

397
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,807
What are you doing?

398
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:23,666
What happened?

399
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,577
Something pricked me.

400
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,984
Cell phone?

401
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:34,915
Where did that come from?

402
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,587
lt's okay, T2. Get some sleep.

403
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:38,951
Cell phone.

404
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:41,786
Your batteries are
too charged these days.

405
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:44,023
lt vibrates every morning.

406
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:45,624
Get married.

407
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:48,334
l can't handle your
cell phone every morning.

408
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,735
Just because anyone
doesn't say a thing..

409
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:52,567
..he's spreading this filth around.

410
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:10,485
Are you done yet?

411
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:16,826
Come out now.

412
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:19,456
Do you want to flush
out your intestines?

413
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:22,429
Let me finish, you witch.

414
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:23,969
You'll develop piles.

415
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,530
You should start taking laxatives.
- Shut up!

416
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,877
Not piles,
l'll die of heart-attack first.

417
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:35,339
Forget it. You're thick-skinned.

418
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,880
You won't die so easily.

419
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,476
l wish you had died earlier..

420
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:39,644
..then l could've remarried again.

421
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:41,353
At least l would've had a child.

422
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:43,889
lf you want a child,
why don't you adopt one?

423
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:45,914
You're always cussing me.

424
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,289
l'll kill you.

425
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,022
Oh my AK 47.

426
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,524
You can't sh*t properly,
you think you can kill me.

427
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,758
Shut up l said.

428
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:56,496
Why do you humiliate me every day?

429
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,433
To help build pressure, Chaudhary.

430
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:00,365
You know,
every husband in this world..

431
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,806
..start's sh***ing
hearing their wife's name.

432
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:04,573
But why don't you?

433
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,509
l'll show you.. Just wait..

434
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,631
l feel fresh, sweetheart.

435
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,833
You're my cure to every problem.

436
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:32,794
lf it wasn't for your cussing,
l could never sh*t in the morning.

437
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:34,500
l'm indebted to you.

438
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:37,075
Now go, get me hot breakfast.

439
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,878
l feel light as a feather.

440
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:42,937
feather

441
00:30:54,628 --> 00:30:55,925
Aunt.

442
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,921
Aunt, did you eat
honey before you slept?

443
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,730
You're looking so sweet.

444
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:02,425
Don't talk nonsense, Babli.

445
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,998
Fine, l've a request.

446
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:06,564
When you come back on the
roof to take off your clothes..

447
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,900
..give me a miss call.

448
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,898
l'll come and take off mine as well.

449
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:12,675
Shut up, shameless.

450
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:15,507
You're a grownup now,
don't you feel ashamed?

451
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:16,639
Nonsense.

452
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:18,445
No manners. l'll beat you.

453
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,449
Let's go, T2.
How much longer will you take?

454
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,362
l can't find my socks.

455
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,723
l can't wear shoes without my socks.

456
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:42,899
Here.

457
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:46,512
What's this?

458
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,512
Padding.

459
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:48,874
The girl's do it.

460
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:50,640
Give's a good impression.

461
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,884
You can keep making a good impression.

462
00:31:57,057 --> 00:31:58,684
l'll wear my shoes without socks.

463
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,665
Return my Rs.100.

464
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:12,898
How can you just find sister-in-law?.

465
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,973
You don't know her name either.

466
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,604
Beauty! That's her name.

467
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:20,511
Beauty!

468
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:24,445
And what's her surname? Parlour?

469
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,978
Beauty!

470
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:28,485
Keep at it.

471
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,289
You'll definitely find her on Google.

472
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,686
Mister. How much for JACKFRUlT?

473
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,760
Rs. 200 a kilo.

474
00:32:35,028 --> 00:32:36,791
Fine, 150 for you.

475
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,724
What the..

476
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,966
What happened, aunt?

477
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,063
Rascal!

478
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:44,802
You made her faint with
your increased prices..

479
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:45,838
..and tore my shirt.

480
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,506
Sir..
- Take that. - What did l do?

481
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:49,597
Hello.

482
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:51,935
Aunt.

483
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:55,410
Get up, aunt. We'll pay for the stuff.

484
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,310
You fool, give me a hand.

485
00:32:57,784 --> 00:32:58,614
Come on.

486
00:32:58,652 --> 00:32:59,619
Come on.

487
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,884
That's my home, son. Stop.

488
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,553
Stop. Stop, son.

489
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,520
This?
- Yes.

490
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:11,594
l can't open this door, son.

491
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:13,489
ls it broken?

492
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:15,996
Oh, God!

493
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:17,964
My back's broken.
- Slowly, aunt. Slowly.

494
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,537
Come back soon.
- Yeah, sit tight.

495
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:25,441
l wish God had given
me a son like you.

496
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:27,507
Not possible at this age, aunt.

497
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,043
But you can get a son-in-law.

498
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:30,783
Do you have a daughter?

499
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,680
Low-life.

500
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:32,615
Come, son.

501
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:34,278
Keep it on the table.

502
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:36,583
Tara.

503
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:38,621
Tara.
- Coming, mom.

504
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,359
My knees.

505
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:41,991
You?
- You!

506
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:43,623
The one l searched for everywhere..

507
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,754
..was actually at the
back of my torn shirt.

508
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:46,931
What are you doing here?
- l'll tell you.

509
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,029
To get my buttons stitched.
- This is not a tailor-shop.

510
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:49,995
You have no manners.

511
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,367
Like you do.
- l..

512
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:52,529
Walking in a house
filled with ladies..

513
00:33:52,605 --> 00:33:53,503
..with an unbuttoned shirt.
- But l..

514
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,074
Where else do you want me to go?
- Your mom tore my shirt..

515
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:56,968
Shut up!

516
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:59,375
Why would my mom tear
your clothes at this age?

517
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,807
Quiet!

518
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:03,842
Let me tell you.

519
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:06,249
l went to the market.

520
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,577
lt was really hot.

521
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,949
l felt dizzy and was falling down.

522
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:12,791
My hand got stuck in his shirt.

523
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,284
And all the buttons of
this poor boy's shirt broke.

524
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:19,325
And he's such a decent guy,
he brought me home.

525
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,796
lnstead of showing some hospitality..

526
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:24,392
..you're rebuking him.

527
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:25,902
Right, aunt, this isn't correct.

528
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,900
Shall l take off my shirt, or..

529
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,636
..will you stitch
it while l'm wearing it?

530
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:54,795
You're so hairy!

531
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,472
Keep your shirt here.

532
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:09,438
l'll get it fixed in a day or two.

533
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,786
How am l looking?

534
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:19,387
What's wrong, aunt?

535
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,486
Feeling dizzy again?

536
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,457
lt reminded me of her papa.

537
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,263
He looked handsome just
like you in this shirt.

538
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:29,829
Doesn't he look handsome anymore?

539
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:31,627
He's dead.

540
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,465
lt's one of his old shirts.

541
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,305
Sorry, aunt. l didn't know.

542
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,543
No need to show sympathy.

543
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,603
Now get lost.

544
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:41,440
You're so hot.

545
00:35:41,614 --> 00:35:43,275
You spit fire.

546
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:44,405
Okay, bye.

547
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:46,878
See you, aunt.
- Bless you, son.

Do come again.

549
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:51,321
Not...

550
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:52,454
Not...

551
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:53,489
Not...

552
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:57,894
Can l say something, beauty?

553
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,426
l really like hot dames?

554
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:02,832
Will you go to the disco with me?

555
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:08,472
Shameless.

556
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:21,946
''Bells...are ringing in my ears.''

557
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:25,990
''lt was love at first sight.''

558
00:36:26,326 --> 00:36:27,657
''l couldn't believe my eyes.''

559
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,661
''l was gripped by fever.''

560
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:32,765
''My heart jumped out.''

561
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:36,802
''First the girl...got angry.''

562
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:40,461
''She asked what are you doing here?''

563
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,267
''l said l'm so lucky.''

564
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:47,708
''The one who brought
me here is your mom.''

565
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,778
''What the..''

566
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:49,872
''We looked everywhere for her.''

567
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,381
''While she was here all the time.''

568
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:54,749
''Her words were like a cup of tea.''

569
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:58,789
''Sweet and hot.''

570
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:05,559
''Like onion fritters,
seasoned with chilly.''

571
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:08,968
''She stormed with
anger and threatened me.''

572
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:13,269
''But l didn't budge.''

573
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:16,797
''l kissed her cheeks.''

574
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:20,437
''And her heart melted.''

575
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,491
''Don't lie. You kissed her?''

576
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:39,498
''Of course l am.
After all l'm the hero.''

577
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,894
''Yes, that you are.''

578
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:42,891
''What next?
- Tune Change.''

579
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,301
''What the..''

580
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,928
''She was standing, so was l.''

581
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:47,700
''And she bumped into me.''

582
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:49,670
''She came close, held my hands.''

583
00:37:49,776 --> 00:37:51,505
''And shied away.''

584
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:54,877
''She affectionately
helped me wear my shirt.''

585
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:59,678
''When she touched me,
it tickled my heart.''

586
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:01,275
''She even changed your shirt.''

587
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:02,512
''You're on..''

588
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:09,495
''She hugged me. l felt a shock.''

589
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:16,830
''My heart started singing Do Re Mi..''

590
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,337
''She slowly whispered in my ears.''

591
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:24,008
''Where were you until now?.''

592
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:27,780
''l fell down, got unconscious.''

593
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:31,678
''And felt the cool breeze of love.''

594
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:35,285
''Bells...are ringing in my ears.''

595
00:38:35,488 --> 00:38:38,651
''lt was love at first sight.''

596
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,622
''l couldn't believe my eyes.''

597
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,558
''l was gripped by fever.''

598
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:45,697
''My heart jumped out.''

599
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:47,956
''The heart jumped.''

600
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:49,666
''The heart jumped.''

601
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:51,861
''The heart raced.''

602
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:53,303
''The heart raced.''

603
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:57,036
''My heart swayed.''

604
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:08,750
''My heart jumped, swayed, it raced.''

605
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:12,748
Yes, sir.

606
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,285
Don't sit like that.
Sir's coming.

607
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:17,682
Sir's coming, get up.

608
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:18,984
Get up l said.

609
00:40:21,728 --> 00:40:23,923
lt's clean.
- Shut up!

610
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,990
Sir's here.

611
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:32,696
Who are you?

612
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:33,802
T2.

613
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:35,397
Terminator 2!

614
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:37,398
l see.

615
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,810
So who's Terminator 1?
- At your service, mister.

616
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,308
The name's Babli.

617
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,811
Babli!

618
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:48,954
Oh yes!

619
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,321
l've heard a lot about you.

620
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,317
He's Mr. Bheem Singh Chandel.

621
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:57,961
His business in Chandigarh
is money laundering.

622
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:00,662
He needs jacked cars.

623
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:01,965
Will you do the job?

624
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:03,959
Payment, no life-threat.

625
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,037
Money in advance.

626
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,737
Right, sir?

627
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:18,606
Have some sweet.

628
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:20,342
Suck on this.

629
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,911
Yes. The deal's done.

630
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:24,922
Just tell us the car model.

631
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,923
When someone's clapping
with two hands..

632
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,622
..you should never
put your face in between.

633
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:34,629
lt can be disastrous.

634
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:36,795
Sorry.

635
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:44,901
What if l runaway with your money?

636
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:49,940
We'll find you.

637
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,048
Oh! ls that real?
- What do you think?

638
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:04,496
T2. Gun!

639
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,533
Have you lost your mind?
What are you doing?

640
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,808
Fan-tastic!

641
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:20,335
lt's real.

642
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,974
l do my job with love, not violence.

643
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:27,875
But you can keep this.

644
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:30,551
l'll keep this.

645
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:33,925
Remember one thing.

646
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:37,591
Once l make a deal,

647
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:39,763
l never take my money back.

648
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,024
l don't return it either.

649
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,799
This isn't a loan.

650
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,369
lt's a deal.

651
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:47,699
lt's a deal. lt's a deal.

652
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,400
Come on, get to work.
But gently.

653
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,907
Now go on...

654
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:53,876
All the best.
- Thank you.

655
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,487
T2.
- Hmmm.

656
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:13,460
Get rid of him.
- Who? Where?

657
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:14,925
Him.

658
00:43:17,336 --> 00:43:18,360
lt's just a dog.

659
00:43:18,404 --> 00:43:19,735
You were acting so
tough in front of Chandel.

660
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:21,262
Now you're scared of a dog.

661
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,399
Every man's scared of someone.

662
00:43:23,676 --> 00:43:24,540
Get rid of him.

663
00:43:24,911 --> 00:43:26,401
Shoo.

664
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:28,278
Bloody dog.

665
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:30,548
You're such a coward.

666
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,710
Sit down.

667
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,021
Sit where?

668
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,739
Yes.

669
00:43:56,642 --> 00:43:58,803
Give him a shave.

670
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,669
What?

671
00:44:02,415 --> 00:44:03,905
But looks like he's
already had a shave.

672
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,551
Then do it again.

673
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:06,677
Come on.

674
00:44:07,553 --> 00:44:08,884
That will be 200.

675
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:10,778
l'll pay 500.

676
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,925
But not here.
- Then?

677
00:44:26,939 --> 00:44:28,531
She won't come on the balcony.

678
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,535
She's gone to her office.

679
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,971
How do you know?.

680
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,315
Everyone knows about Tara Sharma, sir.

681
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:40,642
There's just one beautiful
girl in this neighbourhood.

682
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:42,548
Talk with respect.

683
00:44:43,456 --> 00:44:45,356
She's your sister-in-law.
- No need to get furious.

684
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,322
Everyone comes to
my shop to stare at her.

685
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:50,326
That's okay.

686
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,320
Give me her office address.

687
00:44:53,532 --> 00:44:54,624
That will be 1000.

688
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:00,905
l'm telling you, you cannot go inside.

689
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:05,974
How about now?.

690
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,914
You're trying to bribe me?

691
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,685
Now?.

692
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,446
This isn't ajoke.

693
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,615
Now?.

694
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:23,453
l..

695
00:45:25,498 --> 00:45:27,762
Sir...we can't allow
you without permission.

696
00:45:29,702 --> 00:45:30,726
Now?.

697
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,506
Will you wrap up
everything in 15 minutes?

698
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:37,570
Make my visitor's card. Babli.

699
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:42,503
Babli.

700
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:51,521
Madam.

701
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:54,049
Tara Sharma.
- lt's there.

702
00:45:58,664 --> 00:45:59,688
Hi.

703
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:00,795
You?

704
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,560
Wow. Can you see the Qutub Minar?

705
00:46:02,735 --> 00:46:04,828
How did you come in?
- Through the door.

706
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,631
Your shirt's at home.

707
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,274
l'll collect it later.

708
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,539
Right now, l want to tell you something.
- What?

709
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,775
l love you!
- What?

710
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,912
l swear on mother.

711
00:46:16,415 --> 00:46:17,712
Although, l've never seen my mother.

712
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:19,941
But since l saw you..

713
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:21,919
..you're the only one
l've been thinking about.

714
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:24,586
And today l'm going
to express my feelings here.

715
00:46:27,293 --> 00:46:28,453
You have one minute.

716
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:29,750
That's enough.

717
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,027
Your time starts now.

718
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:36,993
My name's Babli.

719
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,435
lt's a bit strange, but that's it.

720
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,905
l don't have any parents,
so no surname.

721
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,499
l was raised in Jai Hind Orphanage.

722
00:46:44,777 --> 00:46:47,337
l studied till 8th Grade,
but don't remember a thing.

723
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,404
But l'm the best mechanic.

724
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:50,980
A-1.

725
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,415
Till now l just loved one person.

726
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,743
Myself.

727
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:56,682
But now l will love you too.

728
00:46:57,623 --> 00:46:59,614
And l'll shower all my love on you.

729
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:01,824
Until you don't say stop.

730
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:05,729
l live with T2. He's a cute boy.

731
00:47:05,998 --> 00:47:07,590
Our orphanage's really big.

732
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:09,529
We can live their comfortably
after we're married.

733
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,863
We can cook together,
otherwise there's Masterji.

734
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:14,796
l want two kids.

735
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:19,600
One like you and
other handsome like me.

736
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:21,973
Their names will be Rekha and Amitabh.

737
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:23,607
They're my favourites.

738
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:28,743
After that, l'll..

739
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:30,286
Enough.

740
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,552
Aren't you getting a little vulgar?

741
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:40,355
l'll be right back.

742
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:43,533
Two minutes.

743
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,642
Security.
This is manager Tara Sharma speaking.

744
00:47:51,777 --> 00:47:53,369
Come to the 8th floor, now!

745
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:57,447
Hey, guys, listen up.

746
00:47:58,284 --> 00:48:00,650
Gather around. Come here.

747
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:03,779
Let me introduce you.

748
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,357
His name's Babli.

749
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:10,288
He's an orphan,

750
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:12,354
so he has no surname either.

751
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:13,954
Right?

752
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:15,697
He couldn't pass 8th grade.

753
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:19,498
And he's here proposing
marriage to me.

754
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,968
You know, he's even decided..

755
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:23,674
..the names of our children.

756
00:48:29,248 --> 00:48:30,237
Madam.

757
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:31,907
What's wrong, madam?

758
00:48:34,653 --> 00:48:36,587
Who do you think you are?

759
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:39,548
Have you ever seen
yourself in the mirror?

760
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:42,357
You look like a manner less idiot.

761
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:48,263
What did you think?
You'll say ''l Love You'' and l'll be floored?

762
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:50,262
How dare you?

763
00:48:50,703 --> 00:48:51,965
Security. Throw him out right now.

764
00:48:52,338 --> 00:48:53,862
Just get him out.
- Yes. - Get lost.

765
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,410
You humiliated my love.

766
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,512
But l'm still smiling.

767
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:08,276
Do you know why?
- Because you're shameless.

768
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:12,490
l am...what l am.

769
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,621
But you're still a kid.

770
00:49:16,295 --> 00:49:17,284
Better grow up.

771
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,459
l want to spend my life with you.

772
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:25,535
Come on.

773
00:49:26,538 --> 00:49:29,268
Move aside.
- Come on.

774
00:49:31,277 --> 00:49:32,266
Sir.

775
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:33,805
Sir, wait.

776
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,277
Keep this.

777
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:41,351
Why? Keep the money, you did yourjob.

778
00:49:41,654 --> 00:49:43,952
Yes, but you were heart-broken.

779
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:49,527
l have no heart, only guts.

780
00:49:50,396 --> 00:49:52,296
And it never breaks.

781
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:55,959
Keep the money.

782
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,543
You didn't pay heed to my advice.

783
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,477
She humiliated you, didn't she?

784
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:16,720
Why ask when you know?.

785
00:50:18,324 --> 00:50:19,621
How about we do some work?

786
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:22,920
Or do we just go back home?
- No.

787
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:24,928
We've come this far..

788
00:50:24,997 --> 00:50:26,464
..we won't go back empty-handed.

789
00:50:26,832 --> 00:50:28,527
Oh! Commitment!

790
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:36,597
Babli. Come here.

791
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:44,414
lt's a brand new car.

792
00:50:44,483 --> 00:50:45,882
You can still smell the fresh paint.

793
00:50:46,385 --> 00:50:49,013
Let's take this one. Otherwise
it will get a tan under the hot sun.

794
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:10,797
Bye, guys.

795
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:20,010
My car.

796
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:23,882
My car was right here,
the new red one.

797
00:51:25,424 --> 00:51:26,652
Security!

798
00:51:28,861 --> 00:51:31,989
Now we'll head to Chandigarh.

799
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,560
Security!

800
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:41,702
Here you go, chassis no.

801
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:45,501
Don't scare me.

802
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:47,602
No, ma'am. We don't have your car.

803
00:51:47,946 --> 00:51:49,914
l think you should
go to the police station.

804
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:13,336
Sign here.

805
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,604
ls this the FlR?

806
00:52:18,777 --> 00:52:20,472
Ask him.

807
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,271
He's in-charge.

808
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:26,315
Sir, can l get a receipt of the FlR?

809
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,281
Why?
- For the insurance.

810
00:52:28,754 --> 00:52:30,688
You can't just file
an FlR so easily, dear.

811
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:31,913
lt takes time.

812
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:34,390
We've just made an
entry into the register.

813
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,418
Now we'll investigate.

814
00:52:36,562 --> 00:52:37,893
What? lnvestigate!

815
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,425
Come here.

816
00:52:44,336 --> 00:52:47,032
Keep seated, l'll be right back.
- What?

817
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,770
The girl's desperate.

818
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,745
Build some pressure on her.
- Pressure.

819
00:52:56,915 --> 00:52:59,509
She'll definitely
agree to pay up 10-15000.

820
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,410
We'll buy a microwave oven. 25 liters.

821
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:03,885
Shut up!

822
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:05,979
She's in trouble.

823
00:53:06,258 --> 00:53:07,520
We should help her.

824
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,387
And you're looking
to make some quick dough.

825
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,288
You hog on 'biryani' all day.

826
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,963
l need some rest
in the kitchen as well.

827
00:53:14,466 --> 00:53:15,865
You married me.

828
00:53:16,034 --> 00:53:17,501
You couldn't give me a kid..

829
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,763
..you could at least look after me.

830
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,436
You're so corrupt.

831
00:53:21,707 --> 00:53:23,504
One day l'll suspend you.

832
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:25,609
Suspend!
- Just try.

833
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,640
You will have to live alone.

834
00:53:27,946 --> 00:53:29,846
l'll move into my mom's home.

835
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:31,680
Mom?

836
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,509
Witch!

837
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:35,851
Always taking advantage
because l'm a man.

838
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:41,619
Sir. lf you conduct
the investigation soon..

839
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:44,628
..then maybe you can find my car.
- Yes..

840
00:53:45,531 --> 00:53:47,829
Look, the police will
put in their best efforts..

841
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,400
..to find your car.
- Yes.

842
00:53:49,701 --> 00:53:52,329
But...you do something as well.

843
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:54,529
What?

844
00:53:56,308 --> 00:53:57,832
Do l have to tell you everything?

845
00:54:00,379 --> 00:54:01,641
Money!

846
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,780
Are you asking for bribe?

847
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,845
l want my car back?
- Yes..

848
00:54:11,023 --> 00:54:12,752
You're getting furious for no reason.

849
00:54:13,425 --> 00:54:14,949
The police can only try.

850
00:54:15,394 --> 00:54:17,794
Whether you get your car back or not..

851
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:19,694
..depends on the one who stole it.

852
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:21,389
Right?
- Yes, sir.

853
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,592
Right, Bhagat Singh.
- Yes, sir.

854
00:54:22,668 --> 00:54:23,600
Yes, sir.

855
00:54:23,669 --> 00:54:24,829
See, everyone agrees.

856
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:28,899
Good for nothing!

857
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,265
No need to get too romantic.

858
00:55:04,543 --> 00:55:08,343
l see. So you're on strike today.

859
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:09,980
What else do you expect me to do?

860
00:55:10,248 --> 00:55:11,476
Move.

861
00:55:13,552 --> 00:55:15,986
You sound so angry.

862
00:55:16,722 --> 00:55:18,280
What's wrong?

863
00:55:18,724 --> 00:55:19,884
As if you don't know.

864
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,554
You blackmail me into
doing all the wrong things.

865
00:55:22,761 --> 00:55:24,023
She was such a sweet girl.

866
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:25,555
l wonder what she might
be thinking about me..

867
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:26,620
..that what a corrupt officer l am.

868
00:55:26,832 --> 00:55:28,493
You maligned my reputation.

869
00:55:28,934 --> 00:55:30,697
You're such a fool.

870
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:33,829
You're reputation isn't
going to earn you anything.

871
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,931
l only say it for your own interest.

872
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,872
You're healthy now.

873
00:55:38,477 --> 00:55:40,604
Tomorrow when you retire,
if you fall sick..

874
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:42,874
..won't we need money
to look after you?

875
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:44,578
We don't have any children anyway.

876
00:55:44,816 --> 00:55:45,942
Again about the children.

877
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:48,976
You humiliate my
manliness intentionally.

878
00:55:49,421 --> 00:55:52,015
Let's get tested and
find out who's incompetent.

879
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:53,584
Why should l get tested?

880
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:54,987
l'm 53 years old.

881
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:57,520
At this age women
go through menopause.

882
00:55:57,796 --> 00:55:59,627
Don't try to teach me.

883
00:55:59,698 --> 00:56:01,359
Men have menopause.

884
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:03,333
How can women get it?
- Want to bet?

885
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:04,797
Google it.

886
00:56:05,537 --> 00:56:06,663
Vicky Donor?

887
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:07,965
But 'Menopause' has Men..

888
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,534
No, no, let's settle this first.

889
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,903
Either you get yourself
tested or adopt a child.

890
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,802
l'm fed up of listening
to your taunts.

891
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:19,814
Get in bed first,
your highness, you'll feel better.

892
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:23,813
No, no, no.
We've to take this decision first.

893
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:24,913
Yes.

894
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,322
Fine, we'll adopt a kid.

895
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,752
Don't get upset.

896
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:30,426
Now climb in.

897
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,992
Really, dear. You'll adopt a kid.

898
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:34,356
Swear on me.

899
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:36,333
l want a son.
- No, daughter.

900
00:56:36,535 --> 00:56:37,729
Son.
- Daughter.

901
00:56:37,903 --> 00:56:39,370
Don't bargain with me.

902
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:40,699
l want a son.
- Done.

903
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,839
Now give me a tight hug.

904
00:56:43,475 --> 00:56:44,635
Come on.

905
00:56:45,877 --> 00:56:50,507
''As the soap slips on my hot body.''

906
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:55,014
''The heart craves for young lass.''

907
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,920
''The cold water feels so thrilling.''

908
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:04,729
''Shamelessness drips from the eyes, the lips.''

909
00:57:20,378 --> 00:57:22,573
'Because you're shameless.'

910
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:42,459
Hi.

911
00:57:46,805 --> 00:57:47,897
Uncle's shirt.

912
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,488
Babli. How are you?

913
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:05,221
Wonderful, aunt.

914
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:06,752
For me?

915
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:09,283
Bless you, son.

916
00:58:10,328 --> 00:58:13,991
Aunt. lt feels so remorse in here.

917
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,663
l can sense sadness in the air!

918
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,836
Her car's been stolen, son.
- When?

919
00:58:19,304 --> 00:58:20,794
Last week.

920
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:22,968
lt was parked right
outside her office.

921
00:58:23,341 --> 00:58:24,740
Brand new Mercedes.

922
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,911
She spent all her
earnings to buy the car.

923
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:29,608
Someone stole it.

924
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:33,246
And, mom. Why don't you
just announce it to the world?

925
00:58:33,685 --> 00:58:34,982
This is no charade.

926
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:37,421
She's just telling me.
- What do you care?

927
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:39,849
Take your shirt and get out.

928
00:58:40,325 --> 00:58:41,849
Just get out.
- Tara.

929
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:43,960
Tara, listen.

930
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:48,499
Son, you better leave.

931
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,290
lt's not your fault.

932
00:58:50,602 --> 00:58:54,265
But if you stay here
she won't stop crying.

933
00:58:54,439 --> 00:58:55,599
Please go...

934
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:07,852
Once we're rich,
we'll buy silver wrenches.

935
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:11,716
Bro.

936
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:14,650
Babli. l'm talking to you.

937
00:59:14,726 --> 00:59:16,717
Are you deaf?

938
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,822
T2.
- Yes.

939
00:59:20,465 --> 00:59:22,490
How many cars have
we stolen until now?.

940
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:26,497
20 big ones,
5 small ones, 2 imported. Why?

941
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:28,567
You want to pay their taxes?

942
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,568
Have you ever thought about those..

943
00:59:31,643 --> 00:59:33,440
..whose car gets stolen?

944
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:36,506
What else?
He gets insurance, we get the car.

945
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:38,473
Tit for tat.

946
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:44,679
The last car we stole.
- Yes.

947
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,923
That was Tara's car.

948
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,920
What?

949
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:51,293
How do you know?.

950
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:53,658
Her mother told me.

951
00:59:54,432 --> 00:59:56,832
Fine. At least we
taught them a lesson.

952
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,600
The consequences
of troubling my Babli.

953
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,529
No, T2.

954
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:04,535
That girl's my love.

955
01:00:05,777 --> 01:00:06,937
l love her.

956
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,681
l saw her crying today,
it really hurt.

957
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,911
But you don't have a heart, only guts.

958
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:16,777
But it still pains.

959
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,722
People built Taj Mahal
to mark their love.

960
01:00:24,796 --> 01:00:26,559
Can't l return her car?

961
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:30,030
The car's been sold, bro.

962
01:00:30,068 --> 01:00:31,501
lt's parked in Chandigarh,
refurbished like new.

963
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:32,692
So what?

964
01:00:32,904 --> 01:00:34,701
lf a stolen car can
get to Chandigarh..

965
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,931
..then it can come back too.

966
01:00:37,876 --> 01:00:39,309
Steal again?

967
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,377
Why do you buy white bread?

968
01:00:47,585 --> 01:00:48,950
You should buy brown bread.
- lt's okay.

969
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,510
What's so great about brown bread?

970
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,948
You've been eating white
bread since you were a kid.

971
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:55,548
Hi.

972
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:57,390
Mom, walk faster.
- Hi, aunt. - l'm walking faster.

973
01:00:57,462 --> 01:00:58,952
l can't gallop like a horse.

974
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,033
Babli.

975
01:01:06,738 --> 01:01:07,705
Hello, aunt.

976
01:01:08,573 --> 01:01:10,336
Let me carry that.
- No need.

977
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:13,503
And stop following me. Get that?

978
01:01:13,845 --> 01:01:15,472
l wasn't following you, madam.

979
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,370
l just walked up to you from the front.
- Yes.

980
01:01:17,615 --> 01:01:19,845
Did l ask for help?
- Did l help you?

981
01:01:20,452 --> 01:01:23,944
l'm talking to aunt.
- He's just helping.

982
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,991
l hate you, mom.
- She's upset again.

983
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,349
l'll lighten her mood.

984
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,426
Tara, your car's in Chandigarh.

985
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,867
See. Didn't l tell you?

986
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,629
Your really charming, son.
- Thank you, aunt.

987
01:01:40,972 --> 01:01:42,963
ls this ajoke?
- No.

988
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,731
l swear on your mom.

989
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,809
Your car's in Chandigarh, Tara.

990
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,346
Come with me, and l can get it back.

991
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,549
But, son. How do you know..

992
01:01:51,616 --> 01:01:52,947
..the car's in Chandigarh?

993
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,476
l investigated.

994
01:01:54,652 --> 01:01:55,710
l've connections, aunt.

995
01:01:55,987 --> 01:01:56,885
What connections?

996
01:01:57,055 --> 01:01:59,353
Didn't l tell you, l'm a car mechanic?

997
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:01,849
Car...mechanic,
thieves, spare-part dealers..

998
01:02:02,293 --> 01:02:03,487
..they're all connected.

999
01:02:03,728 --> 01:02:04,717
We know everything.

1000
01:02:04,896 --> 01:02:05,988
Why can't the police find out?

1001
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:07,387
Police?

1002
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,490
You expect the thieves
to be the protectors?

1003
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:10,927
They get a heavy commission.

1004
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:12,495
Why will they find your car?

1005
01:02:12,704 --> 01:02:14,672
They are all corrupt, aunt.
- Right.

1006
01:02:15,473 --> 01:02:17,338
Why do l believe you?
- Don't.

1007
01:02:17,976 --> 01:02:19,307
You'll definitely get insurance.

1008
01:02:19,511 --> 01:02:20,443
Right, aunt.
- But..

1009
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:22,374
l just wanted to do a good deed.

1010
01:02:23,014 --> 01:02:24,038
l learnt this when l was a kid.

1011
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:28,013
We always have to face
opposite of what we do.

1012
01:02:28,686 --> 01:02:30,017
Do good and good things
will happen to you.

1013
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,854
Show compassion
and people will remember you.

1014
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,915
That means, good equals good.

1015
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:36,286
Compassion equals reminiscence.

1016
01:02:36,561 --> 01:02:37,459
Get that, beauty.

1017
01:02:38,063 --> 01:02:39,621
Why do you want to help me?

1018
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:42,764
l can't say that in aunt's presence.

1019
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:44,300
Shameless.

1020
01:02:44,502 --> 01:02:45,469
Mom, let's go.

1021
01:02:46,404 --> 01:02:47,496
Let's go.

1022
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:49,400
l don't want to talk to him.

1023
01:02:56,014 --> 01:02:58,608
Tara. Go to Chandigarh.

1024
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,978
There's no harm in trying.

1025
01:03:01,686 --> 01:03:03,278
Cars get stolen all the time, mom.

1026
01:03:03,455 --> 01:03:04,979
They aren't found so easily.

1027
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,449
But you are getting yours back.

1028
01:03:08,593 --> 01:03:11,562
What if he rapes me?
- Shut up.

1029
01:03:11,763 --> 01:03:12,991
Don't talk nonsense!

1030
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,601
l'm your mom.
l've years of experience.

1031
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:22,498
My heart says Babli's naughty..

1032
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,832
..but he's not bad at heart.

1033
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:28,539
Take the name of God and go with him.

1034
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,406
Yes.

1035
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:38,012
Happy birthday to us!

1036
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,981
Happy birthday to us!

1037
01:03:41,493 --> 01:03:44,553
Happy birthday to all of us!

1038
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,324
Happy birthday to us!

1039
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:53,765
lt's nice.
- Come on, start eating.

1040
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:55,029
Here you go, cake.
- Wow!

1041
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,566
Wow!
- Today is my happy birthday.

1042
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,843
Whose?
- All of us.

1043
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,409
We were raised in an orphanage.

1044
01:04:00,578 --> 01:04:01,909
Fatherless and lonely.

1045
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,847
No one knows when their birthday is.

1046
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,008
So we celebrate it on the same day.

1047
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,611
Eat it.
- So sweet.

1048
01:04:06,784 --> 01:04:09,446
Happy birthday.
- Take a bite. - Taste it.

1049
01:04:10,421 --> 01:04:11,479
That's it.

1050
01:04:11,956 --> 01:04:15,687
You see, son. l'm on a diet.

1051
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,388
God bless your figure, aunt.

1052
01:04:21,633 --> 01:04:24,625
You're looking so sweet,
l want to marry you.

1053
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,598
What do you say?
- Shameless.

1054
01:04:27,772 --> 01:04:30,263
Thank you, aunt.

1055
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,570
T2.
- Yes.

1056
01:04:34,312 --> 01:04:36,507
ls shameless a bad word?
- No.

1057
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,271
lt's a compliment.

1058
01:04:48,293 --> 01:04:49,885
Hello.
- Tara Sharma speaking.

1059
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,062
l'm ready to go to Chandigarh.

1060
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,899
Can you come home
tomorrow at 11 o'clock?

1061
01:04:57,735 --> 01:04:58,759
Babli.

1062
01:05:00,305 --> 01:05:01,294
Hello.

1063
01:05:02,006 --> 01:05:03,496
What's wrong with him?

1064
01:05:03,741 --> 01:05:05,231
Hey, Sleeping beauty!

1065
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:17,104
Hi.

1066
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,198
Are we traveling in this open jeep?
- Yes.

1067
01:05:44,702 --> 01:05:46,192
We both are going to drive.

1068
01:05:46,604 --> 01:05:48,162
Taking turns.

1069
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:55,212
Couldn't we take a bus?

1070
01:05:55,513 --> 01:05:58,641
No, that's below my standard.

1071
01:06:05,323 --> 01:06:07,757
Hello, aunt.
- Bless you, son.

1072
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:12,124
For you.
- Thank you.

1073
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,699
Best of luck to you, go.

1074
01:06:47,432 --> 01:06:48,763
Lollypop?

1075
01:06:51,569 --> 01:06:53,400
Take it. lt's anti-boring.

1076
01:06:58,576 --> 01:06:59,804
Look, Babli.

1077
01:07:00,545 --> 01:07:02,911
l know you're going
out of your way to help me.

1078
01:07:04,148 --> 01:07:06,139
But better tell me if
you want something in return.

1079
01:07:06,451 --> 01:07:07,713
From you?
- Yes.

1080
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,684
What can you give...

1081
01:07:09,887 --> 01:07:12,219
...a handsome hunk like me?

1082
01:07:12,523 --> 01:07:14,081
A tight slap.

1083
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:16,517
Mind your manners.

1084
01:07:16,694 --> 01:07:18,184
l won't be fooled by you.

1085
01:07:18,429 --> 01:07:19,589
You're in my car.

1086
01:07:20,331 --> 01:07:22,356
When will you come in my arms?

1087
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:26,396
Know your stature?
- Why? What's wrong?

1088
01:07:26,738 --> 01:07:28,535
l've a nice job. l don't beg.

1089
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,334
Mechanic.

1090
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:33,370
Mechanics are doctors.

1091
01:07:33,711 --> 01:07:34,803
Doctors of cars.

1092
01:07:35,113 --> 01:07:37,172
Politicians,
ministers, film-stars, businessmen.

1093
01:07:37,348 --> 01:07:38,838
l treat everyone's car.

1094
01:07:39,384 --> 01:07:41,181
l just don't have a
glass office like you do.

1095
01:07:41,286 --> 01:07:42,412
So what?

1096
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,345
No reputation either.
- Who needs that?

1097
01:07:46,124 --> 01:07:48,524
ln my line of work,
you need only two things.

1098
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,521
Courage and talent.

1099
01:07:51,162 --> 01:07:52,186
And l've both.

1100
01:07:52,363 --> 01:07:53,887
You're so arrogant about yourjob,
aren't you?

1101
01:07:56,234 --> 01:07:57,496
Why do you hate my job so much?

1102
01:08:00,505 --> 01:08:01,665
Fine.

1103
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,734
Marry me.

1104
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:06,802
l'll change my entire life for you.

1105
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:09,374
So, will you?

1106
01:08:09,914 --> 01:08:11,347
Keep your eyes on the road.

1107
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:12,740
Shameless.

1108
01:08:17,622 --> 01:08:21,820
''When l saw you, l realized sweetheart.''

1109
01:08:23,494 --> 01:08:28,557
''That love's crazy.''

1110
01:08:36,207 --> 01:08:37,231
Tara.

1111
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:55,758
What the..

1112
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,161
What are you doing here?

1113
01:09:00,565 --> 01:09:01,725
Staring at you.

1114
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:03,122
Why?

1115
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:05,165
l've been slogging since morning..

1116
01:09:05,236 --> 01:09:06,863
..while you're
comfortably snoring away.

1117
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:09,730
Come on. Change seats.

1118
01:09:28,659 --> 01:09:29,751
You were sleepy, weren't you?

1119
01:09:30,194 --> 01:09:31,183
Not anymore.

1120
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:32,461
Look ahead.

1121
01:09:32,697 --> 01:09:34,096
That's where l'm looking.

1122
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:36,391
What a view.

1123
01:09:38,503 --> 01:09:43,770
l think honey runs through your veins,
not blood.

1124
01:09:48,579 --> 01:09:50,308
You're so beautiful.

1125
01:09:51,716 --> 01:09:54,276
Like ca...shew!

1126
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,755
There, l got permission to see.

1127
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:02,119
Your name should've been 'Shameless'.
- Done.

1128
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:05,195
You're Tara Sharma,
and l'm Babli Besharam.

1129
01:10:05,329 --> 01:10:06,261
Good.

1130
01:10:06,564 --> 01:10:09,431
But someday every girl..

1131
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,832
..has to take on her husband's name.

1132
01:10:13,805 --> 01:10:15,705
You're a Sharma until now.

1133
01:10:16,741 --> 01:10:18,504
Now you'll be 'Besharam'.

1134
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:21,577
Put on your glasses.

1135
01:10:21,746 --> 01:10:24,112
lf l see your eyes again,
l'll crash this car.

1136
01:11:09,827 --> 01:11:16,232
''How do l convey the
condition of my heart?''

1137
01:11:17,134 --> 01:11:24,131
''Do l tell you...or keep it to myself,
what do l do?''

1138
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:27,538
''Your heart's so helpless.''

1139
01:11:27,812 --> 01:11:30,076
''lt's shameless, doesn't pay heed.''

1140
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:31,341
''lt's good for nothing.''

1141
01:11:31,582 --> 01:11:36,747
''You make my heart restless.''

1142
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:42,821
''Why do l love you?''

1143
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:50,199
''How do l convey the
condition of my heart?''

1144
01:11:51,435 --> 01:11:57,806
''Do l tell you...or keep it to myself,
what do l do?''

1145
01:11:58,342 --> 01:12:02,108
''Your heart's so helpless.''

1146
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,111
''lt's shameless, doesn't pay heed.''

1147
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:05,614
''lt's good for nothing.''

1148
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:11,117
''You make my heart restless.''

1149
01:12:11,322 --> 01:12:17,283
''Why do l love you?''

1150
01:12:40,818 --> 01:12:47,815
''l wonder why your
heart's...in love with me?''

1151
01:12:48,259 --> 01:12:54,425
''There are others
waiting...in the line.''

1152
01:12:54,632 --> 01:12:58,432
''l can't stop my heart,
no matter how much l try.''

1153
01:12:58,569 --> 01:13:01,595
''l try to scare it,
but it pays no heed.''

1154
01:13:01,806 --> 01:13:05,435
''lt's completely floored by you.''

1155
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:08,771
''Try to think something new.''

1156
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:12,707
''Say something new.''

1157
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:18,053
''You make my heart restless.''

1158
01:13:18,222 --> 01:13:22,784
''Why do l love you?''

1159
01:13:23,194 --> 01:13:26,652
''You make my heart restless.''

1160
01:13:27,064 --> 01:13:31,330
''Why do l love you?''

1161
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:49,583
Tara.

1162
01:13:49,687 --> 01:13:50,517
Tara, your car.

1163
01:13:50,554 --> 01:13:51,543
Your car.

1164
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:54,557
That's not mine.
My number plate's of Delhi.

1165
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:56,593
The number plate's been changed.
Stop the car.

1166
01:13:56,727 --> 01:13:57,591
How do you know?.

1167
01:13:57,762 --> 01:13:59,286
l changed the number, wouldn't l know?.

1168
01:13:59,363 --> 01:14:00,387
Stop the car.

1169
01:14:02,099 --> 01:14:04,829
What the..
Tara, control.

1170
01:14:11,075 --> 01:14:12,372
You stole my car?

1171
01:14:33,764 --> 01:14:36,392
l hope you don't mind
sharing a bed with me.

1172
01:14:36,801 --> 01:14:39,269
How dare you?
- No need to sulk.

1173
01:14:39,503 --> 01:14:40,834
l'm just joking.

1174
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:42,432
My room's different.

1175
01:14:44,175 --> 01:14:45,335
Be honest, Babli.

1176
01:14:46,343 --> 01:14:47,810
How many cars have
you stolen till now?.

1177
01:14:50,314 --> 01:14:51,747
Honesty can't give
you a square meal, madam.

1178
01:14:52,116 --> 01:14:53,674
lt does to me. Just tell me.

1179
01:14:54,652 --> 01:14:56,677
No. You can't bear you.

1180
01:14:58,856 --> 01:15:02,690
Aren't you ashamed?
- You call me shameless.

1181
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,090
Babli, l'm being serious.
- l'm serious as well, Tara.

1182
01:15:05,596 --> 01:15:07,359
Who are you to point a finger at me?

1183
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:09,632
Just because you make more money..

1184
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,598
..and studied in an English college..

1185
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:11,692
..you think you can judge me?

1186
01:15:12,403 --> 01:15:17,306
What's the point in knowing,
what l did and why?

1187
01:15:18,242 --> 01:15:21,507
Whatever l did,
l couldn't tell right from wrong.

1188
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:24,770
l had no parents
or family to teach me.

1189
01:15:25,182 --> 01:15:26,410
What did you want me to
do for earning a square meal?

1190
01:15:27,618 --> 01:15:28,744
Don't l have a right to live?

1191
01:15:29,353 --> 01:15:30,843
So you resorted to stealing.

1192
01:15:34,825 --> 01:15:36,258
lt was desperate times.

1193
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:39,560
But l didn't do it to become rich.

1194
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,264
l stole cars only
to satiate my hunger.

1195
01:15:43,334 --> 01:15:45,894
Mine and other orphans like me..

1196
01:15:46,237 --> 01:15:49,502
..whose parents leave them to die.

1197
01:15:50,608 --> 01:15:52,337
l did what l thought was right.

1198
01:15:57,548 --> 01:15:59,482
Nothing can ever
justify any wrong deed.

1199
01:16:01,318 --> 01:16:04,583
Did you ever think about that?

1200
01:16:08,726 --> 01:16:10,523
That's why l am in
love with you, Tara.

1201
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,462
You're the only one who's
showing me the right path.

1202
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:20,194
l want to leave everything for you.

1203
01:16:20,304 --> 01:16:21,669
Turn into a descent man.

1204
01:16:26,777 --> 01:16:27,801
Will you give me a chance?

1205
01:16:50,534 --> 01:16:55,267
''l wonder why every happiness..''

1206
01:16:55,339 --> 01:16:58,502
''..now seems incomplete?''

1207
01:17:00,244 --> 01:17:00,903
Hi.

1208
01:17:01,278 --> 01:17:08,480
''Why didn't l realise,
you were missing in my life?''

1209
01:17:09,386 --> 01:17:10,284
l love you.

1210
01:17:10,354 --> 01:17:14,688
''Yes, l do. Yes, l do.''

1211
01:17:15,226 --> 01:17:20,755
''You touched my heart,
with your love.''

1212
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:24,532
''lt's you. Only you.''

1213
01:17:24,768 --> 01:17:25,826
Marry me.

1214
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:29,303
l can change my entire life for you.

1215
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,134
''lt's you. Only you.''

1216
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:48,348
''What l thought was sadness,
now seems bliss.''

1217
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:51,792
He's naughty, but good at heart.

1218
01:17:52,196 --> 01:17:59,261
''You should've said it,
because l couldn't say it.''

1219
01:18:00,804 --> 01:18:05,605
''Yes, l do. Yes, l do.''

1220
01:18:05,776 --> 01:18:11,305
''You touched my heart,
with your love.''

1221
01:18:11,515 --> 01:18:15,747
''lt's you. Only you.''

1222
01:18:16,353 --> 01:18:22,724
''lt's you. Only you.''

1223
01:19:02,566 --> 01:19:07,196
''Come, give me a hug.''

1224
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:12,170
''Let's erase this distance.''

1225
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:17,569
''Don't make me yearn any longer.''

1226
01:19:17,815 --> 01:19:22,377
''O Shameless, don't be shy.''

1227
01:19:22,553 --> 01:19:26,546
''My heart's fallen for you.''

1228
01:19:26,724 --> 01:19:29,249
''Beloved.''

1229
01:19:29,326 --> 01:19:31,590
''Beloved.''

1230
01:19:31,729 --> 01:19:37,531
''You touched my heart,
with your love.''

1231
01:19:37,601 --> 01:19:43,096
''lt's you. Only you.''

1232
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:58,455
Bheem Singh Chandel.

1233
01:19:58,722 --> 01:20:00,246
Chandigarh's Money
Laundering mafia King.

1234
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:09,426
He's a powerful guy.

1235
01:20:17,107 --> 01:20:20,440
And you...will steal
my car back wearing this suit?

1236
01:20:20,711 --> 01:20:23,271
All the successful thieves
in the world wear a suit.

1237
01:20:25,249 --> 01:20:26,739
Those who don't get apprehended.

1238
01:20:30,754 --> 01:20:32,381
You look nice in these clothes.

1239
01:20:35,626 --> 01:20:37,719
Some things are more
valuable than clothes.

1240
01:20:40,564 --> 01:20:41,792
But you won't understand.

1241
01:20:46,703 --> 01:20:47,601
Babli.

1242
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:51,435
Will you come back?

1243
01:20:54,812 --> 01:20:56,279
l'll be waiting.

1244
01:21:14,298 --> 01:21:15,265
Hello.

1245
01:21:15,766 --> 01:21:16,824
Where to?

1246
01:21:18,435 --> 01:21:19,527
Chandel sir.

1247
01:21:20,571 --> 01:21:22,664
The minister's sent a parcel.

1248
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:28,202
There in the office.

1249
01:22:01,778 --> 01:22:03,109
Hey. Where are you going?

1250
01:22:10,387 --> 01:22:11,513
Hey. Catch him!

1251
01:22:12,156 --> 01:22:13,589
Why you..

1252
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:48,488
Hey! Get down, you..

1253
01:23:13,584 --> 01:23:15,677
Catch the rascal.

1254
01:24:19,082 --> 01:24:20,140
Who are you?

1255
01:24:20,484 --> 01:24:23,351
Your pant.
- l see.

1256
01:24:33,297 --> 01:24:34,594
Go, Rambo.

1257
01:25:45,702 --> 01:25:48,466
Hey! Troubling a girl.

1258
01:25:51,174 --> 01:25:56,202
Charge..

1259
01:27:10,153 --> 01:27:10,847
He isn't here.

1260
01:27:11,254 --> 01:27:13,119
l think he's blown-up.
- He can't just blow-up.

1261
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:14,479
Find him.

1262
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:15,758
Look.

1263
01:27:29,105 --> 01:27:31,164
Slowly. Slowly.

1264
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:32,801
l tried to stop you.

1265
01:27:33,343 --> 01:27:34,674
Stop being James Bond.

1266
01:27:35,178 --> 01:27:36,475
l wouldn't have tried..

1267
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,275
..if you girls didn't like James Bond.

1268
01:27:38,582 --> 01:27:41,244
l didn't know dogs like him as well.

1269
01:27:41,618 --> 01:27:43,245
James Bond always does his job.

1270
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,611
He doesn't runaway like you do.

1271
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:49,224
Hello, madam.
l'm a thief, not a butcher.

1272
01:27:49,759 --> 01:27:51,420
Dogs have a soul too.

1273
01:27:52,195 --> 01:27:55,631
And anyway,
l went there to get your car.

1274
01:28:00,203 --> 01:28:01,295
What happened?

1275
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:05,701
Look, Babli.

1276
01:28:06,776 --> 01:28:09,677
You don't have to take
this risk for getting the car.

1277
01:28:13,216 --> 01:28:15,241
lf something happens to you, then..

1278
01:28:15,752 --> 01:28:16,719
Then?

1279
01:28:25,428 --> 01:28:26,520
Suicide cancel.

1280
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,137
lt's not much of work..

1281
01:28:35,205 --> 01:28:36,797
..but l'll have to
get it cleaned from inside.

1282
01:28:37,274 --> 01:28:38,366
No problem.

1283
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:40,471
Deliver the car by evening.
- Yes.

1284
01:28:40,644 --> 01:28:43,340
The boss is in a bad mood.
- Fine. lt'll be done.

1285
01:28:44,281 --> 01:28:46,181
Jogi. Give him the keys.

1286
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,339
Thank you.

1287
01:28:48,685 --> 01:28:49,811
Let's go.

1288
01:28:58,194 --> 01:29:01,561
Hello.
- Bhure, business looks good.

1289
01:29:02,332 --> 01:29:03,594
You're working on expensive cars.

1290
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,531
Babli, where are you?

1291
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:07,193
Don't look here and there.

1292
01:29:07,604 --> 01:29:10,664
Look in the direction of your heart,
straight.

1293
01:29:12,442 --> 01:29:13,841
Babli.
- Yes.

1294
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:21,644
l'm taking the car back.

1295
01:29:22,185 --> 01:29:24,244
We can do this the easy way, or else..

1296
01:29:24,588 --> 01:29:25,680
What the..

1297
01:29:26,189 --> 01:29:29,124
There's no place for
violence in our business.

1298
01:29:29,259 --> 01:29:31,193
lt runs in a peaceful manner.

1299
01:29:31,328 --> 01:29:33,159
And, l haven't harmed you in anyway.

1300
01:29:33,396 --> 01:29:34,795
Try to understand.

1301
01:29:35,165 --> 01:29:38,430
lf l give you this car,
Chandel will kill me.

1302
01:29:39,402 --> 01:29:42,633
lf you don't, l will kill you.

1303
01:29:43,106 --> 01:29:43,868
But why?

1304
01:29:44,207 --> 01:29:45,765
l give you business.

1305
01:29:46,142 --> 01:29:49,373
l'm...the chicken that
lays the golden eggs for you.

1306
01:29:51,615 --> 01:29:53,708
Dead chicken is more
profitable these days.

1307
01:29:54,117 --> 01:29:55,311
Ask how?.
- How?.

1308
01:29:55,719 --> 01:29:57,414
Live chicken, Rs. 100..

1309
01:29:57,654 --> 01:29:59,485
And 'Tandoori' chicken..
- 300.

1310
01:29:59,723 --> 01:30:00,621
So?

1311
01:30:01,358 --> 01:30:02,882
Now you decide, what you prefer?

1312
01:30:03,259 --> 01:30:08,128
Bro. You're the frying pan,
and Chandel's the fire.

1313
01:30:08,365 --> 01:30:10,526
Look, if the car's
stolen from my place..

1314
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,194
..then Chandel will kill me brutally.

1315
01:30:13,837 --> 01:30:15,202
Try to understand.

1316
01:30:15,405 --> 01:30:17,305
l've small kids.

1317
01:30:17,507 --> 01:30:18,565
They will be orphaned.

1318
01:30:18,842 --> 01:30:21,072
Let them grow up first.

1319
01:30:23,213 --> 01:30:24,407
What are you doing?

1320
01:30:25,115 --> 01:30:26,241
lf l steal the car
from somewhere else..

1321
01:30:26,316 --> 01:30:27,476
..will it still be a problem?
- What?

1322
01:30:27,684 --> 01:30:29,311
lf l steal the car
from somewhere else..

1323
01:30:29,386 --> 01:30:32,219
..will it still be a problem?
- No problem.

1324
01:30:32,555 --> 01:30:35,683
Just let me return the car to Chandel.

1325
01:30:36,259 --> 01:30:38,557
My dear, l'm clear.

1326
01:30:40,296 --> 01:30:42,856
Fine. Make me a duplicate key.

1327
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,765
And your kids won't be orphaned.

1328
01:30:45,301 --> 01:30:47,326
Thank you.
- Get lost.

1329
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:50,834
That's the key to my jeep.

1330
01:30:52,442 --> 01:30:54,273
lt's banged up, but not stolen.
- Okay.

1331
01:30:54,511 --> 01:30:56,775
Get it repaired and deliver it to Delhi.
- Okay.

1332
01:30:57,514 --> 01:30:58,481
We'll settle it there.

1333
01:31:02,452 --> 01:31:04,181
Sir, l've repaired the car.

1334
01:31:04,387 --> 01:31:06,412
The windscreen's original.

1335
01:31:06,756 --> 01:31:07,882
Sir, keys.

1336
01:31:12,796 --> 01:31:13,694
They're coming.

1337
01:31:13,763 --> 01:31:14,695
Come on.

1338
01:31:35,151 --> 01:31:36,778
Come in, when l call you.

1339
01:31:37,187 --> 01:31:38,484
Ok.

1340
01:31:39,656 --> 01:31:42,784
We'll jack the car
as soon as that oaf moves.

1341
01:31:44,194 --> 01:31:46,287
He won't budge we'll have to make him.

1342
01:31:55,739 --> 01:31:56,706
Hi.

1343
01:31:56,773 --> 01:31:59,139
Aren't you Timmy?

1344
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:01,802
Mr. Chandel's right-hand.

1345
01:32:03,646 --> 01:32:06,581
You're just like l heard.

1346
01:32:06,783 --> 01:32:08,182
What do you want?

1347
01:32:09,552 --> 01:32:11,782
What does a beautiful woman..

1348
01:32:12,055 --> 01:32:14,717
..want from a handsome hunk like you?

1349
01:32:15,458 --> 01:32:16,482
What?

1350
01:32:17,827 --> 01:32:19,351
Protection, Tommy.

1351
01:32:19,763 --> 01:32:20,752
Protection.

1352
01:32:28,304 --> 01:32:29,669
Where did you get that strength from?

1353
01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:30,706
Great, isn't it?

1354
01:32:31,474 --> 01:32:32,668
lt'll come in handy
once we're married.

1355
01:32:32,809 --> 01:32:34,470
Shut up! Open the car.

1356
01:32:48,124 --> 01:32:49,091
Yes!

1357
01:32:49,692 --> 01:32:50,818
What happened?

1358
01:32:51,561 --> 01:32:53,722
Shocked.
- That's okay.

1359
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:55,727
l'm really happy today.

1360
01:32:56,299 --> 01:32:57,391
l can definitely give you one shock.

1361
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,263
Do it again.
- What?

1362
01:32:59,536 --> 01:33:00,764
That thing you just did now.

1363
01:33:01,304 --> 01:33:03,363
lt felt so familiar. Please.

1364
01:33:10,413 --> 01:33:11,573
Puncture.

1365
01:33:12,348 --> 01:33:13,372
What the..

1366
01:33:27,297 --> 01:33:28,525
Tara.

1367
01:33:33,169 --> 01:33:33,828
Bhura!

1368
01:33:34,204 --> 01:33:35,228
Bhura!

1369
01:33:37,106 --> 01:33:39,267
Sir, you. On a scooter?

1370
01:33:52,222 --> 01:33:53,621
What now?.
- What else?

1371
01:33:54,157 --> 01:33:55,749
Tyre change, start the car.

1372
01:33:56,092 --> 01:33:57,582
Straight to Delhi.

1373
01:33:58,294 --> 01:34:00,489
And the money?
- lt's black money.

1374
01:34:00,797 --> 01:34:02,196
Now they're ours.

1375
01:34:03,099 --> 01:34:04,327
We can donate it to the orphanage.

1376
01:34:04,667 --> 01:34:06,294
Talking like a thief again.

1377
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:08,728
Hey, l didn't steal it.

1378
01:34:09,339 --> 01:34:10,601
lt's a blessing from God.

1379
01:34:11,241 --> 01:34:12,367
Consider it a wedding gift.

1380
01:34:12,709 --> 01:34:14,609
Don't keep looking for opportunities..

1381
01:34:14,677 --> 01:34:15,701
..like a lowly-guy. Get it.

1382
01:34:16,045 --> 01:34:16,807
Fine, sorry.

1383
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,206
We'll throw it away.
- No!

1384
01:34:19,782 --> 01:34:21,750
We'll take it to the police.
- Very good.

1385
01:34:22,785 --> 01:34:25,276
You should've been the
Prime Minister of this country.

1386
01:34:25,755 --> 01:34:27,586
You can definitely
eradicate corruption.

1387
01:34:28,258 --> 01:34:30,351
You even smell of honesty.

1388
01:34:33,563 --> 01:34:35,622
Get up. Get up.

1389
01:34:36,065 --> 01:34:37,191
Rascal.

1390
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,262
Get up.

1391
01:34:38,401 --> 01:34:39,561
One more.

1392
01:34:41,704 --> 01:34:43,535
Where's my money, Bhura?

1393
01:34:44,307 --> 01:34:47,743
Sir, what money?

1394
01:34:48,278 --> 01:34:50,246
l don't know what you're saying.

1395
01:34:52,382 --> 01:34:54,407
No, no, no..

1396
01:35:00,356 --> 01:35:02,654
The car you sold me has been stolen.

1397
01:35:03,092 --> 01:35:04,559
What?
- l'm sure you know that.

1398
01:35:04,794 --> 01:35:05,852
The car's been stolen.

1399
01:35:06,362 --> 01:35:08,455
l really don't know.
- l see.

1400
01:35:09,565 --> 01:35:10,623
Well, that's okay.

1401
01:35:11,134 --> 01:35:12,362
You don't know.

1402
01:35:12,602 --> 01:35:14,866
lt was a stolen car,
it got stolen again.

1403
01:35:15,705 --> 01:35:19,732
But there was money
in the trunk of the car.

1404
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:22,373
Where's the money, Bhura?

1405
01:35:31,688 --> 01:35:33,315
l really don't know, sir.

1406
01:35:33,523 --> 01:35:36,253
l didn't steal your car.
- l know you didn't.

1407
01:35:41,831 --> 01:35:43,594
Bhura.

1408
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:47,765
You really have the nerve.

1409
01:35:48,571 --> 01:35:49,697
Your friends who stole the car..

1410
01:35:49,839 --> 01:35:54,902
..they were such fools
to leave the scooter behind.

1411
01:35:55,712 --> 01:35:57,339
l called the RTO.

1412
01:35:57,547 --> 01:35:59,811
Do you know who the scooter belongs to?
- Who?

1413
01:36:00,183 --> 01:36:01,207
lt's stolen.

1414
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:07,583
And...there's just one
stolen car dealer in town.

1415
01:36:08,725 --> 01:36:09,714
You!

1416
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:11,849
Now..

1417
01:36:25,508 --> 01:36:28,568
Hello.
- Bhura. Babli speaking.

1418
01:36:28,878 --> 01:36:30,175
All okay?

1419
01:36:30,747 --> 01:36:32,840
Yes. Where are you, Babli?

1420
01:36:33,182 --> 01:36:34,342
l'm on my way.

1421
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:36,484
l found the car,
so l wanted to thank you.

1422
01:36:36,786 --> 01:36:38,515
And repay your favour too.

1423
01:36:39,188 --> 01:36:40,348
You're my friend after all.

1424
01:36:41,657 --> 01:36:42,851
How?. How?. How?.

1425
01:36:43,226 --> 01:36:45,353
l found a bag filled
with notes in the car.

1426
01:36:45,595 --> 01:36:47,153
Consider it your return gift.

1427
01:36:49,365 --> 01:36:51,333
Come back.

1428
01:36:52,535 --> 01:36:54,560
There's no reverse gear in my life.

1429
01:36:54,637 --> 01:36:57,367
Once l'm on my way, l never turn back.

1430
01:36:57,573 --> 01:36:59,200
lf you want the money, come to Delhi.

1431
01:36:59,475 --> 01:37:01,238
And listen, come soon.

1432
01:37:01,644 --> 01:37:04,408
The bag's really heavy.
- Babli..

1433
01:37:05,314 --> 01:37:06,406
Hello.

1434
01:37:06,749 --> 01:37:08,148
Out of network.

1435
01:37:19,195 --> 01:37:22,130
''Sweetheart, take off those glasses.''

1436
01:37:22,231 --> 01:37:24,791
''Look into...my eyes.''

1437
01:37:25,334 --> 01:37:28,326
''Sweetheart, take off those glasses.''

1438
01:37:28,504 --> 01:37:31,405
''Look into...my eyes.''

1439

''Come on...come on.''

1440
01:37:45,855 --> 01:37:50,121
''Without you l'll
always be a bachelor.''

1441
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,155
''Come on...come on.''

1442
01:37:52,328 --> 01:37:56,355
''Without you l'll
always be a bachelor.''

1443
01:37:56,499 --> 01:37:58,399
''Go away, go away.''

1444
01:37:58,568 --> 01:37:59,865
''Go take a look at
yourself in the mirror.''

1445
01:38:00,236 --> 01:38:02,602
''Don't try to fool me.''

1446
01:38:02,772 --> 01:38:05,866
''Go take a look at
yourself in the mirror.''

1447
01:38:06,275 --> 01:38:08,835
''Don't try to fool me.''

1448
01:38:09,212 --> 01:38:11,680
''Come on. Come to me.''

1449
01:38:12,081 --> 01:38:14,811
''Don't show attitude.''

1450
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:18,177
''Go away.''

1451
01:38:18,454 --> 01:38:21,651
''Try your luck with someone else.''

1452
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,587
''Come on...come on.''

1453
01:38:23,793 --> 01:38:28,162
''Without you l'll
always be a bachelor.''

1454
01:38:28,498 --> 01:38:29,795

''Without you l'll
always be a bachelor.''

''Go away, go away.''

1457
01:38:36,539 --> 01:38:38,370
''Go take a look at

''Don't try to fool me.''

1462
01:39:12,341 --> 01:39:15,708
''Hey girl, you're so lovely.''

1463
01:39:16,078 --> 01:39:18,376
''Your gait's such bomb.''

1464
01:39:18,514 --> 01:39:22,382
''Hey Romeo, don't be fooled.''

1465
01:39:22,552 --> 01:39:25,077
''My gaits also explosive.''

1466
01:39:25,154 --> 01:39:31,184
''Since l lost my heart,
luck has shined on me.''

1467
01:39:31,327 --> 01:39:34,421
''Go away, don't come after me.''

1468
01:39:34,564 --> 01:39:38,193
''Why...why...why do you whistle?''

1469
01:39:38,301 --> 01:39:40,599
''My heart's racing like an engine.''

1470
01:39:40,803 --> 01:39:44,239
''Why...why...why do you whistle?''

1471
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,635
''My heart's racing like an engine.''

1472
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:49,201
''Go away, go away.''

1473
01:39:49,278 --> 01:39:50,609
''Don't break the signal.''

1474
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:53,410
''Hit the brakes, stop right there.''

1475
01:39:53,482 --> 01:39:55,109
''Go away, go away.''

1476
01:39:55,184 --> 01:39:56,412
''Don't break the signal.''

1477
01:39:56,519 --> 01:39:59,647
''Hit the brakes, stop right there.''

1478
01:40:07,697 --> 01:40:12,566
''Take a peak in my heart.''

1479
01:40:13,169 --> 01:40:16,332
''You will find your image.''

1480
01:40:16,606 --> 01:40:20,736
''You can play with
my emotions all you want.''

1481
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:26,444
''But you will definitely
say 'l love you' in the end.''

1482
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:31,552
''l'm the star, this is my film.''

1483
01:40:31,754 --> 01:40:34,621
''l'm going to marry you.''

1484
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:40,558
''Go away,
your dreams will never come true.''

1485
01:40:40,663 --> 01:40:43,655
''You tried, but couldn't find one.''

1486
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:47,092
''There's no one like me.''

1487
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:50,364
''Get lost, don't try to trick me.''

1488
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:52,304
''Come on...come on.''

1489
01:40:52,508 --> 01:40:56,501
''Without you l'll always be a bachelor.''

1490
01:40:56,812 --> 01:40:58,541
''Come on...come on.''

1491
01:40:58,714 --> 01:41:02,844
''Without you l'll
always be a bachelor.''

1492
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:05,178
''Go away, go away.''

1493
01:41:05,354 --> 01:41:09,154
''Go take a look at yourself
in the mirror.. Don't try to fool me.''

1494
01:41:09,358 --> 01:41:11,189
''Go away, go away.''

1495
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:12,659
''Go take a look at
yourself in the mirror.''

1496
01:41:13,062 --> 01:41:15,292
''Don't try to fool me.''

1497
01:41:15,498 --> 01:41:18,467
''Come on. Come to me.''

1498
01:41:18,701 --> 01:41:21,465
''Don't show attitude.''

1499
01:41:21,604 --> 01:41:23,162
''Go away.''

1500
01:41:23,406 --> 01:41:28,207
''Try your luck with someone else.''

1501
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:12,780
How was it?
- Uncle.

1502
01:42:13,222 --> 01:42:16,191
You've grown old,
but you still sing kiddy songs.

1503
01:42:19,695 --> 01:42:22,562
l...the heart's still young, son.

1504
01:42:23,132 --> 01:42:25,066
Don't you know any patriotic song?

1505
01:42:25,434 --> 01:42:27,629
Like 'Sare Jahan Se Achcha'?

1506
01:42:30,339 --> 01:42:31,431
He knows 'Chikni Chameli'.
- Yes.

1507
01:42:31,507 --> 01:42:32,474
Right. Show him.

1508
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:36,171
ls this what they teach you in police?

1509
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:37,768
l don't want to be your son.

1510
01:42:38,147 --> 01:42:41,548
Don't get angry, son. Don't get angry.

1511
01:42:42,451 --> 01:42:45,113
We'll learn what they
teach in television.

1512
01:42:45,388 --> 01:42:46,548
lsn't that right, Warden?

1513
01:42:46,756 --> 01:42:48,155
What can l say?

1514
01:42:48,324 --> 01:42:49,621
lt's the rule.

1515
01:42:50,393 --> 01:42:53,089
You can adopt Bablu
only if he gives consent.

1516
01:42:53,362 --> 01:42:56,229
We don't force children. Not at all.

1517
01:42:56,732 --> 01:42:57,824
Say yes, son.

1518
01:42:58,401 --> 01:43:00,164
l'll get you admitted
in the police force.

1519
01:43:00,369 --> 01:43:01,358
lPS officer.

1520
01:43:01,404 --> 01:43:02,530
l don't want to be an officer.

1521
01:43:02,738 --> 01:43:04,137
l want to be a mechanic.

1522
01:43:04,373 --> 01:43:06,341
Mechanic?
- Yes.

1523
01:43:06,675 --> 01:43:07,699
Like brother Babli.

1524
01:43:10,112 --> 01:43:11,579
Babli?
- Yes, Babli.

1525
01:43:12,748 --> 01:43:14,045
He's one of the kids.

1526
01:43:14,216 --> 01:43:15,615
He's an excellent mechanic.

1527
01:43:15,785 --> 01:43:17,753
He's been blessed by the Lord.

1528
01:43:18,354 --> 01:43:20,447
He lives with us, right here.

1529
01:43:22,258 --> 01:43:23,316
l see.

1530
01:43:25,361 --> 01:43:27,488
See. We're home.

1531
01:43:29,365 --> 01:43:30,389
Come on.

1532
01:43:30,699 --> 01:43:32,132
How are you, Aslam?

1533
01:43:32,301 --> 01:43:33,233
T2.

1534
01:43:33,369 --> 01:43:34,700
T2.

1535
01:43:35,204 --> 01:43:36,068
Come on.

1536
01:43:36,138 --> 01:43:37,230
Run along.

1537
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,174
Come in. Consider it your own home.

1538
01:43:41,477 --> 01:43:42,671
Stupid. Get lost.

1539
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,175
That's my room.
- Shut up.

1540
01:43:47,082 --> 01:43:48,515
My mattress is full of springs.

1541
01:43:49,218 --> 01:43:50,515
Gives out a great sound.

1542
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:55,448
Yes? Who are you?

1543
01:43:55,858 --> 01:43:58,292
Your father.

1544
01:43:58,727 --> 01:44:01,525
lnspector Chulbul Chautala.

1545
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:03,220
And she's your mother.

1546
01:44:03,432 --> 01:44:05,764
Head Constable Bulbul Chautala.

1547
01:44:06,135 --> 01:44:09,627
You forgot your kin
really soon, Babli.

1548
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,532
Want a slap?

1549
01:44:12,675 --> 01:44:14,734
You can tell your tale at the station.

1550
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:18,204
So it's this car.
- Sir, l've stopped stealing.

1551
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:20,180
Where did you get this car from?
Did your father gift it to you?

1552
01:44:20,282 --> 01:44:22,079
Sir, this was my car that was stolen.

1553
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:24,151
You're coming along
to the station as well.

1554
01:44:24,453 --> 01:44:26,250
The police couldn't
find your stolen car..

1555
01:44:26,288 --> 01:44:27,585
..then how did you find it?
- Correct.

1556
01:44:27,656 --> 01:44:29,453
Absolutely correct.
- Get in. Drive.

1557
01:44:29,592 --> 01:44:32,117
Move back. Or l'll slap you.

1558
01:44:32,328 --> 01:44:33,625
Her car. We'll see.

1559
01:44:33,762 --> 01:44:35,696
Straight to the station.

1560
01:44:47,409 --> 01:44:49,400
Wasn't that Babli in the car?
- Yes.

1561
01:44:49,645 --> 01:44:50,612
ls he off to somewhere?

1562
01:44:50,813 --> 01:44:52,440
The police arrested him.

1563
01:45:15,871 --> 01:45:16,838
Where's Babli?

1564
01:45:18,507 --> 01:45:20,634
Sir...the police just arrested Babli.

1565
01:45:23,879 --> 01:45:25,506
Chautala sir.

1566
01:45:25,614 --> 01:45:26,842
Just wait and watch.

1567
01:45:27,316 --> 01:45:28,647
l've made a strong report.

1568
01:45:28,817 --> 01:45:30,444
He'll definitely be
jailed for seven years.

1569
01:45:30,653 --> 01:45:32,883
Or my name isn't Chautala.
- Sir.

1570
01:45:33,589 --> 01:45:34,681
Wait and watch.

1571
01:45:34,857 --> 01:45:37,849
Chautala sir.
- Stop yelling.

1572
01:45:38,327 --> 01:45:41,524
lf you swallow a mosquito,
l'll charge you for murder.

1573
01:45:41,597 --> 01:45:42,894
Sir, please let him go.

1574
01:45:43,165 --> 01:45:45,133
He's turned to a new leaf.
- No, he hasn't.

1575
01:45:45,267 --> 01:45:46,666
He's gotten worse.

1576
01:45:47,169 --> 01:45:49,330
He stole a stolen car.

1577
01:45:49,471 --> 01:45:50,733
He didn't do anything wrong.

1578
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,767
You should thank him.

1579
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:54,637
l came to you as well.

1580
01:45:55,311 --> 01:45:57,836
But being the police
you don't do yourjob.

1581
01:45:58,380 --> 01:45:59,813
lnstead you ask for bribe.

1582
01:46:00,182 --> 01:46:01,376
You should be ashamed.

1583
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:02,915
You are so corrupt.

1584
01:46:03,886 --> 01:46:05,353
Tell me one thing.

1585
01:46:05,688 --> 01:46:09,681
Can't we end this
corruption with something?

1586
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:14,522
How much?

1587
01:46:15,464 --> 01:46:16,761
Enough to make us helpless..

1588
01:46:17,099 --> 01:46:20,796
..and close your lover's file.

1589
01:46:33,449 --> 01:46:34,473
Money!

1590
01:46:34,717 --> 01:46:36,514
Chulbul. Money!

1591
01:46:36,585 --> 01:46:39,247
Money! Money! My Money!

1592
01:46:39,588 --> 01:46:40,850
Money!

1593
01:46:46,895 --> 01:46:48,294
What happened?
- Get lost.

1594
01:46:48,631 --> 01:46:50,258
Give your salutations and go home.

1595
01:46:50,566 --> 01:46:52,158
We managed to get you
out with great difficulty.

1596
01:46:52,234 --> 01:46:53,166
Come on.

1597
01:47:01,143 --> 01:47:02,303
Thank you, sir.

1598
01:47:04,313 --> 01:47:05,871
Sir..
- Go on.

1599
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:12,719
Let's get out before
they change their mind.

1600
01:47:12,788 --> 01:47:13,720
Come on.

1601
01:47:14,356 --> 01:47:15,380
Let's go.

1602
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:19,088
What did you do?

1603
01:47:19,395 --> 01:47:20,794
They didn't let me go for free.

1604
01:47:21,664 --> 01:47:23,427
l gave them Chandel's money.

1605
01:47:23,732 --> 01:47:25,666
All of it?
- What do you care?

1606
01:47:28,137 --> 01:47:29,604
You always ruin everything.

1607
01:47:30,139 --> 01:47:31,197
What will l tell Bhura?

1608
01:47:31,273 --> 01:47:33,707
Make an excuse. lt wasn't his money.

1609
01:47:34,376 --> 01:47:36,310
You should be thankful
that you got out.

1610
01:47:37,179 --> 01:47:38,840
You're no life-saver.

1611
01:47:39,348 --> 01:47:41,248
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

1612
01:47:54,396 --> 01:47:55,658
l guess you want to go home now?.

1613
01:47:56,331 --> 01:47:57,855
Your mom must be waiting.

1614
01:47:59,168 --> 01:48:00,135
Go on then.

1615
01:48:00,302 --> 01:48:01,166
You got your car.

1616
01:48:01,236 --> 01:48:02,134
What else do you want?

1617
01:48:02,371 --> 01:48:03,395
Go

1618
01:48:04,506 --> 01:48:05,495
Babli.

1619
01:48:07,142 --> 01:48:08,575
Won't you give me a hug?

1620
01:48:23,525 --> 01:48:24,514
l'm sorry.

1621
01:48:26,328 --> 01:48:28,421
lt took time for me to recognise you.

1622
01:48:29,698 --> 01:48:31,723
You're a nice man.

1623
01:48:34,503 --> 01:48:35,435
Goodnight.

1624
01:48:37,139 --> 01:48:38,299
Babli.

1625
01:48:39,374 --> 01:48:40,568
One more thing.

1626
01:48:48,517 --> 01:48:53,284
l know l'm spoilt, bitter, stubborn.

1627
01:48:54,389 --> 01:48:55,549

1628
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:58,116
But l know how to love too.

1629
01:48:59,228 --> 01:49:00,422
l love you.

1630
01:49:02,865 --> 01:49:04,662
l was shying away till now.

1631
01:49:06,535 --> 01:49:08,366
Won't you make me shameless?

1632
01:49:25,454 --> 01:49:27,081
T2, l..
- Didn't l tell you, Babli?

1633
01:49:27,422 --> 01:49:29,617
lf you try to run with my money,
l will find you.

1634
01:49:29,825 --> 01:49:31,190
Chandel.

1635
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,159
Where's T2?
- Right here.

1636
01:49:33,328 --> 01:49:34,352
With us.

1637
01:49:34,663 --> 01:49:35,857
We're showing him our hospitality.

1638
01:49:37,299 --> 01:49:38,231
Listen.

1639
01:49:39,568 --> 01:49:40,535
Timmy.

1640
01:49:53,849 --> 01:49:57,182
l know he's in pain,
l'm sure you're too.

1641
01:49:58,587 --> 01:50:00,214
Listen, let T2 go.

1642
01:50:00,823 --> 01:50:02,154
l..

1643
01:50:02,691 --> 01:50:04,818
l will return your money.
- Great.

1644
01:50:05,527 --> 01:50:06,789
Don't think too much.

1645
01:50:07,629 --> 01:50:09,563
Come meet me at the
same place we met before.

1646
01:50:10,599 --> 01:50:11,623
And hurry up.

1647
01:50:12,167 --> 01:50:15,568
The other children from the
orphanage are waiting here too.

1648
01:50:18,307 --> 01:50:19,467
Masterji!

1649
01:50:21,143 --> 01:50:23,270
Bablu! Munna!

1650
01:50:26,515 --> 01:50:27,743
Abdul.

1651
01:50:31,253 --> 01:50:32,117
Tilu.

1652
01:50:34,623 --> 01:50:35,555
Masterji!

1653
01:50:41,496 --> 01:50:42,622
Bheem Singh Chandel was here.

1654
01:50:43,131 --> 01:50:45,292
He took T2 and the other children.

1655
01:50:45,734 --> 01:50:47,326
Did you steal his money?

1656
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:50,138
Return his money, son.

1657
01:50:50,539 --> 01:50:54,236
Or he'll kill all the children.

1658
01:51:02,251 --> 01:51:07,587
173, 174, 175, 176..

1659
01:51:08,357 --> 01:51:09,881
l think it's more
than 30 million in here.

1660
01:51:10,225 --> 01:51:11,522
Great going, Chautala.

1661
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:13,721
This is a big retirement
bonus for you.

1662
01:51:14,229 --> 01:51:15,719
Don't be crazy.
- 177..

1663
01:51:16,265 --> 01:51:18,165
You're 53 years old.
- 178, 179..

1664
01:51:18,367 --> 01:51:20,528
You can't endure all this happiness.

1665
01:51:20,602 --> 01:51:22,695
Go away, get some sleep.

1666
01:51:23,305 --> 01:51:25,637
180, 181..
- She's lost it.

1667
01:51:26,241 --> 01:51:31,645
182, 183, 184, 185, 186..

1668
01:51:35,384 --> 01:51:36,612
What did you break?

1669
01:51:40,222 --> 01:51:41,382
Down. Down.

1670
01:51:41,823 --> 01:51:43,120
Who is it?

1671
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:46,389
Who is it?
- They'll beat you.

1672
01:51:47,562 --> 01:51:50,360
Come face me if you're a man.

1673
01:51:50,766 --> 01:51:52,825
Don't hide like a girl.

1674
01:51:53,268 --> 01:51:54,826
She heard it.

1675
01:52:13,355 --> 01:52:14,413
Why you..

1676
01:52:17,392 --> 01:52:18,518
Come out..

1677
01:52:20,262 --> 01:52:23,060
She has a gun.
- Don't be scared.

1678
01:52:23,765 --> 01:52:25,096
Cover me.

1679
01:53:34,403 --> 01:53:36,633
Why did you leave this here?

1680
01:53:52,754 --> 01:53:56,281
Babli, l won't spare you.
- First free yourself.

1681
01:53:56,558 --> 01:53:58,321
l'm a police officer.

1682
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:59,759
You're a burden on this earth.

1683
01:53:59,828 --> 01:54:00,852
Let me go.

1684
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:03,728
All that money's made you swell up.

1685
01:54:03,765 --> 01:54:04,697
You'll rot in hell.

1686
01:54:04,833 --> 01:54:06,095
Don't insult me.

1687
01:54:06,301 --> 01:54:08,633
l'm inspector Chulbul Chautala.

1688
01:54:08,737 --> 01:54:09,829
Shut up! lnsult you.

1689
01:54:10,105 --> 01:54:11,072
Just because you're Chulbul..

1690
01:54:11,139 --> 01:54:12,128
..doesn't exactly make you fearless.

1691
01:54:12,207 --> 01:54:13,640
You got to show courage for that.

1692
01:54:15,310 --> 01:54:16,538
l request you.

1693
01:54:16,745 --> 01:54:21,148
Let me go.
- Fatty. l'm not raping you.

1694
01:54:21,550 --> 01:54:22,448
Rascal.

1695
01:54:22,517 --> 01:54:24,178
Babli, l will scream.

1696
01:54:24,453 --> 01:54:25,613
Bulbul.

1697
01:54:25,754 --> 01:54:26,812
Let me go.

1698
01:54:28,723 --> 01:54:30,691
Try to understand.

1699
01:54:31,126 --> 01:54:32,787
This is a serious matter.
- What?

1700
01:54:33,195 --> 01:54:34,787
The children of my
orphanage are in danger.

1701
01:54:35,263 --> 01:54:37,163
And it's all because
of you and this money.

1702
01:54:37,332 --> 01:54:38,765
l'm going to do a good deed.

1703
01:54:39,234 --> 01:54:41,429
After that l'll earn an honest living.

1704
01:54:41,703 --> 01:54:42,692
Come on, bless me.

1705
01:54:43,071 --> 01:54:44,629
First, let me go.

1706
01:54:44,806 --> 01:54:46,671
Thank you. Now don't scream.

1707
01:54:47,175 --> 01:54:49,075
Let me go.

1708
01:54:49,311 --> 01:54:50,300
Babli.

1709
01:54:50,378 --> 01:54:51,310
Babli.

1710
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:52,706
Babli.

1711
01:54:53,148 --> 01:54:54,581
Babli.

1712
01:54:59,855 --> 01:55:01,379
You will never learn.

1713
01:55:08,296 --> 01:55:10,628
Once a thief, always a thief.

1714
01:55:11,099 --> 01:55:12,259
You're one too.

1715
01:55:12,801 --> 01:55:14,200
Thief.
- Shut up.

1716
01:55:14,669 --> 01:55:15,829
Get in.

1717
01:55:16,571 --> 01:55:18,163
What have you done?

1718
01:55:18,340 --> 01:55:19,329
Free him.

1719
01:55:19,541 --> 01:55:21,406
Otherwise l will shoot you.

1720
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:22,702
Free him.

1721
01:55:23,145 --> 01:55:24,772
Untie me.
- How dare you?

1722
01:55:25,213 --> 01:55:26,407
Hurry up.

1723
01:55:26,715 --> 01:55:28,148
Hurry up.

1724
01:55:29,117 --> 01:55:29,845
Hurry up.

1725
01:55:30,252 --> 01:55:31,583
Untie me.

1726
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:33,447
Untie me.
- Chautala.

1727
01:55:33,588 --> 01:55:35,613
Are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

1728
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:38,281
Bravo.
- Breathe. Breathe.

1729
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:39,891
Just like Baba Ramdev.

1730
01:55:43,865 --> 01:55:45,127
Rascal.

1731
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,365
You almost killed my husband.

1732
01:55:47,702 --> 01:55:51,536
l will kill you. Kill you.
- Stop, Bulbul. Stop.

1733
01:55:52,207 --> 01:55:53,469
Hand me the gun.

1734
01:55:53,808 --> 01:55:55,173
l'm the inspector.

1735
01:55:56,344 --> 01:55:57,368
Kill him.

1736
01:55:57,646 --> 01:55:59,307
You have humiliated me, Babli.

1737
01:55:59,648 --> 01:56:00,706
l will show you.

1738
01:56:01,449 --> 01:56:02,643
Now be honest. Where are the children?

1739
01:56:02,884 --> 01:56:04,351
Where are the children?

1740
01:56:04,819 --> 01:56:06,150
Chandel abducted them.

1741
01:56:07,355 --> 01:56:08,219
He's the money-laundering
king of Chandigarh.

1742
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:08,881
This money belongs to him.
- Liar.

1743
01:56:09,191 --> 01:56:10,385
l swear on my mom.

1744
01:56:10,592 --> 01:56:12,116
But you don't have a mom.

1745
01:56:12,494 --> 01:56:13,586
Fine, l swear on you.

1746
01:56:14,196 --> 01:56:17,097
You're like my mom too.
- No, no.

1747
01:56:17,399 --> 01:56:18,388
No, l don't believe him.

1748
01:56:18,567 --> 01:56:20,398
Chautala, don't get emotional.

1749
01:56:20,569 --> 01:56:22,662
He's playing with our emotions.

1750
01:56:33,415 --> 01:56:35,315
How can you ever be a mom?

1751
01:56:36,151 --> 01:56:38,381
You don't care about those children?

1752
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:39,712
What are you doing?

1753
01:56:40,455 --> 01:56:42,548
You believe him.
- Shut up!

1754
01:56:42,891 --> 01:56:46,224
l always let you influence
me and do wrong things.

1755
01:56:46,761 --> 01:56:49,889
Your hunger for money..

1756
01:56:50,599 --> 01:56:52,533
Babli. Take the money.

1757
01:56:57,539 --> 01:57:01,373
Chulbul. Don't you believe me?
- Quiet.

1758
01:57:01,876 --> 01:57:03,309
l'm going with Babli.

1759
01:57:03,578 --> 01:57:04,909
l'm not listening to you.

1760
01:57:05,513 --> 01:57:06,810
You're pointing a gun at me.

1761
01:57:07,449 --> 01:57:08,780
So it's come to this now.

1762
01:57:09,284 --> 01:57:10,478
Am l not your kin?

1763
01:57:11,386 --> 01:57:13,115
We'll settle this later.

1764
01:57:13,488 --> 01:57:15,115
lt's time to save the children.

1765
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:17,521
l'll go call control room, Babli.

1766
01:57:17,692 --> 01:57:18,681
You go.

1767
01:57:49,624 --> 01:57:50,522
What's this?

1768
01:57:54,329 --> 01:57:55,626
l'll miss you, Chulbul.

1769
01:57:56,798 --> 01:57:58,163
Forgive me.

1770
01:57:59,301 --> 01:58:00,563
Take me along.

1771
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:03,832
We're not going on a picnic.

1772
01:58:04,873 --> 01:58:06,170
lt's been so long.

1773
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:09,176
l never realised that l married a man.

1774
01:58:10,211 --> 01:58:12,679
For the first time you're
going on a dangerous mission.

1775
01:58:13,415 --> 01:58:16,111
l want you to fight like a man.

1776
01:58:23,525 --> 01:58:25,425
Give me a good luck hug.

1777
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:28,328
l'll show you what a man l am.

1778
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:30,425
Come on.

1779
01:58:31,466 --> 01:58:32,398
Bulbul.

1780
01:58:55,256 --> 01:58:56,723
From here l'll have to go alone.

1781
01:58:57,625 --> 01:58:58,614
My Bluetooth's switched on.

1782
01:58:59,127 --> 01:59:01,459
l'll give a sign as
soon as l get the kids.

1783
01:59:05,133 --> 01:59:06,725
This is my service weapon.

1784
01:59:08,269 --> 01:59:09,566
l'm handing it to you on my risk.

1785
01:59:09,904 --> 01:59:11,337
Keep it, it might come in handy.

1786
01:59:11,673 --> 01:59:14,369
l do my job with love, not weapons.

1787
01:59:14,576 --> 01:59:15,668
Aren't you scared?

1788
01:59:15,844 --> 01:59:17,209
They have weapons.

1789
01:59:17,479 --> 01:59:18,844
And l've your blessings.

1790
01:59:19,547 --> 01:59:20,514
Have faith.

1791
01:59:21,082 --> 01:59:22,140
l'll return victorious.

1792
01:59:22,784 --> 01:59:23,648
Go.

1793
01:59:44,372 --> 01:59:45,464
Where are the children?

1794
01:59:46,474 --> 01:59:47,498
Walk straight.

1795
01:59:47,675 --> 01:59:50,701
Tell me, Timmy. l won't runaway.

1796
01:59:51,246 --> 01:59:52,543
He's with some Timmy.

1797
01:59:54,282 --> 01:59:57,183
Babli.
- Babli.

1798
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:00,685
Babli.
- Babli.

1799
02:00:01,156 --> 02:00:02,623
Babli. Babli. Babli. - Move on..

1800
02:00:04,192 --> 02:00:05,819
Move on..

1801
02:00:09,164 --> 02:00:10,153
l see everyone.

1802
02:00:10,698 --> 02:00:11,824
But where's Chandel?

1803
02:00:13,134 --> 02:00:13,793
Here.

1804
02:00:24,112 --> 02:00:27,445
10-15 men,
everyone's carrying weapons.

1805
02:00:28,216 --> 02:00:30,480
But still, you're holding the
children captive in the cabin above.

1806
02:00:30,718 --> 02:00:32,549
Show some humanity.

1807
02:00:32,687 --> 02:00:34,484
The children are in the top cabin.

1808
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:38,258
Here's your money and car keys.

1809
02:00:56,444 --> 02:00:57,877
Won't you ask why l did it?

1810
02:00:58,346 --> 02:00:59,608
What's the point?

1811
02:01:00,582 --> 02:01:01,640
You made a mistake.

1812
02:01:02,584 --> 02:01:03,573
And in our business..

1813
02:01:03,651 --> 02:01:05,243
..there's just one
punishment for mistakes.

1814
02:01:05,553 --> 02:01:06,713
Death.

1815
02:01:07,722 --> 02:01:08,780
Don't l know?.

1816
02:01:09,324 --> 02:01:10,723
l watch movies too.

1817
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:13,258
But what's the point.

1818
02:01:13,528 --> 02:01:14,825
You've the car and money.

1819
02:01:15,396 --> 02:01:16,658
Nowjust to satisfy your ego..

1820
02:01:16,698 --> 02:01:20,259
..you will first kill me,
then T2, then the kids.

1821
02:01:20,635 --> 02:01:22,569
Why commit this sin?

1822
02:01:23,438 --> 02:01:24,462
You're a businessman, right?

1823
02:01:24,606 --> 02:01:25,573
Think.

1824
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:28,106
l'll advice you a new climax.

1825
02:01:29,511 --> 02:01:30,808
Let the kids go.

1826
02:01:31,212 --> 02:01:33,146
l'll be your slave.

1827
02:01:34,282 --> 02:01:35,681
Like Tommy.

1828
02:01:36,251 --> 02:01:37,843
The difference is you pay him.

1829
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:40,713
But l'll make money for you.

1830
02:01:41,723 --> 02:01:43,588
l make 1-1.5 million a month.

1831
02:01:44,125 --> 02:01:45,387
My expenses are 50000.

1832
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:47,221
The rest is yours.

1833
02:01:48,763 --> 02:01:50,355
1.5 million in a month.

1834
02:01:50,565 --> 02:01:52,089
So in a year that's..

1835
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,127
18 million.
- Correct.

1836
02:01:54,435 --> 02:01:56,164
How much in five years?

1837
02:01:57,772 --> 02:01:58,864
90 million.

1838
02:02:00,375 --> 02:02:01,342
And interest too.

1839
02:02:02,143 --> 02:02:03,167
Well done.

1840
02:02:05,513 --> 02:02:06,741
Oh no.
- What happened?

1841
02:02:07,382 --> 02:02:08,872
That Babli turned on us.

1842
02:02:09,484 --> 02:02:11,111
He joined hands with Chandel.

1843
02:02:11,252 --> 02:02:12,378
That's not true, sir.

1844
02:02:12,687 --> 02:02:14,416
Babli's always kept his promise.

1845
02:02:14,756 --> 02:02:16,189
He will never do such a thing.

1846
02:02:16,558 --> 02:02:18,150
We'll know.

1847
02:02:23,231 --> 02:02:25,096
What are you thinking?

1848
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,525
l'm a talented guy.

1849
02:02:27,702 --> 02:02:29,533
My fingers are magical.

1850
02:02:29,737 --> 02:02:31,398
l can steal your stuff
right below your eyes..

1851
02:02:31,472 --> 02:02:32,598
..and you won't know.

1852
02:02:32,774 --> 02:02:35,242
Like...this.

1853
02:02:37,745 --> 02:02:39,838
Stop. Stop. Listen to me.

1854
02:02:40,281 --> 02:02:41,475
Stop.

1855
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:44,309
This is your gun, Tommy.
- What nonsense.

1856
02:02:44,385 --> 02:02:45,545
Check it.

1857
02:02:47,689 --> 02:02:48,713
ldiot.

1858
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:49,654
Tommy, shoo.

1859
02:02:51,292 --> 02:02:53,283
l could've shot him.

1860
02:02:53,728 --> 02:02:56,492
But...l'm a romantic guy.

1861
02:02:57,231 --> 02:02:58,528
l don't like bloodshed.

1862
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:00,361
l did this only to show my talent.

1863
02:03:00,535 --> 02:03:01,502
Sorry.

1864
02:03:02,604 --> 02:03:06,335
lf l let the kids go and you runaway?

1865
02:03:07,508 --> 02:03:08,566
You can kidnap me again.

1866
02:03:08,776 --> 02:03:10,141
Kill me.

1867
02:03:11,045 --> 02:03:12,103
Don't you see?

1868
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:13,511
These children are my life.

1869
02:03:14,315 --> 02:03:16,442
l wouldn't have come
here in the first place.

1870
02:03:19,087 --> 02:03:20,111
Why?

1871
02:03:20,321 --> 02:03:21,686
Think, sir.

1872
02:03:24,459 --> 02:03:25,653
Let the children go.

1873
02:03:27,762 --> 02:03:29,559
Great, Chandel sir.

1874
02:03:33,668 --> 02:03:34,657
Fantastic, sir.

1875
02:03:35,203 --> 02:03:36,795
For the first time in history..

1876
02:03:37,071 --> 02:03:38,470
..hero and villain compromised.

1877
02:03:38,606 --> 02:03:39,732
And there was no climax.

1878
02:03:40,141 --> 02:03:40,800
Right.

1879
02:03:41,075 --> 02:03:42,303
Say it together children.

1880
02:03:42,510 --> 02:03:44,341
Glory to..
- Bheem Singh Chandel.

1881
02:03:44,545 --> 02:03:47,207
Everyone say.. Glory to..
- Bheem Singh Chandel.

1882
02:03:47,348 --> 02:03:49,680
Say it together.. Glory to..
- Bheem Singh Chandel.

1883
02:03:49,751 --> 02:03:52,720
Say it together.. Glory to..
- Bheem Singh Chandel.

1884
02:03:58,259 --> 02:03:59,123
Police?

1885
02:04:01,462 --> 02:04:02,292
Take the kids.

1886
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:03,590
Go up. Come on.

1887
02:04:08,336 --> 02:04:12,170
Beware people.
Police gives you one chance.

1888
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:13,204
Hand over..

1889
02:04:13,274 --> 02:04:15,242
You dare trick me and call the police.

1890
02:04:15,443 --> 02:04:17,377
l will..
- l dint call police

1891
02:04:17,779 --> 02:04:19,178
Fire!

1892
02:04:21,716 --> 02:04:23,581
Get down. Down!

1893
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:30,584
Come on.

1894
02:04:55,717 --> 02:04:56,741
Babli.

1895
02:04:57,118 --> 02:04:58,585
Let's go. Let's go.

1896
02:05:01,355 --> 02:05:02,344
T2. Load the kids.

1897
02:05:02,657 --> 02:05:04,784
Get the kids out of here.
- And you?

1898
02:05:05,193 --> 02:05:06,683
l gave Chautala sir my word.

1899
02:05:07,095 --> 02:05:09,222
l can't leave him in danger. Go on.
- Babli.

1900
02:05:10,765 --> 02:05:11,629
Let's go.

1901
02:05:18,372 --> 02:05:19,669
Rascal.

1902
02:05:20,208 --> 02:05:21,266
Corner them.

1903
02:05:25,546 --> 02:05:27,309
Bulbul, run!

1904
02:06:01,716 --> 02:06:03,149
You ruined everything, Chautala sir?

1905
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:05,316
Why did you have to
barge in like Dharmendra?

1906
02:06:05,386 --> 02:06:06,284
Quiet!

1907
02:06:07,155 --> 02:06:08,554
You're playing a double game with us.

1908
02:06:08,856 --> 02:06:10,289
You were joining hands with Chandel.

1909
02:06:10,525 --> 02:06:11,651
l heard everything over the phone.

1910
02:06:11,726 --> 02:06:13,216
lt was a lie, Chautala sir.

1911
02:06:13,361 --> 02:06:14,623
Otherwise why would
l let you overhear it?

1912
02:06:14,829 --> 02:06:17,730
l'm on your side,
try to use your brains.

1913
02:06:18,299 --> 02:06:19,459
Stop.

1914
02:06:22,436 --> 02:06:24,563
Come out everyone and
throw down your weapons.

1915
02:06:24,806 --> 02:06:27,798
Or this woman bites the dust.

1916
02:06:28,342 --> 02:06:29,468
Come on.

1917
02:06:30,211 --> 02:06:32,236
Hold fire. Hold.

1918
02:06:33,648 --> 02:06:35,775
Bulbul's my only wife.

1919
02:06:36,117 --> 02:06:37,243
What do l do?

1920
02:06:37,652 --> 02:06:39,210
Give me the gun.
- Why?

1921
02:06:39,554 --> 02:06:42,182
Do you want to save her?
- Yes. What will you do?

1922
02:06:42,323 --> 02:06:43,620
Have you seen 'Sholay'?

1923
02:06:44,392 --> 02:06:46,326
l will throw you at his knees..

1924
02:06:46,527 --> 02:06:49,360
..and you throw dust in his eyes.
- How?.

1925
02:06:54,468 --> 02:06:55,457
Well done, Tommy.

1926
02:06:55,703 --> 02:06:57,227
You did great.

1927
02:06:57,438 --> 02:07:00,896
You've got the queen
and l got the king.

1928
02:07:01,409 --> 02:07:04,708
lf anyone fires now,
the police will be the first to die.

1929
02:07:05,179 --> 02:07:06,806
Come out, everyone.

1930
02:07:07,181 --> 02:07:08,307
Come on.

1931
02:07:10,184 --> 02:07:11,378
Sir, all okay?

1932
02:07:11,786 --> 02:07:13,413
Throw down your weapons.

1933
02:07:14,589 --> 02:07:15,681
Do it.

1934
02:07:22,330 --> 02:07:23,797
Apologise to him.

1935
02:07:26,234 --> 02:07:27,724
What are you looking at?
Shoot him.

1936
02:07:31,505 --> 02:07:32,733
Why you..

1937
02:07:38,779 --> 02:07:40,144
Shoot him.

1938
02:07:45,553 --> 02:07:47,714
Sir, l think we're out of bullets.

1939
02:07:48,155 --> 02:07:49,247
Really?

1940
02:07:50,524 --> 02:07:52,719
Charge!

1941
02:08:08,376 --> 02:08:09,741
Wait.

1942
02:09:17,645 --> 02:09:19,169
l'm floored.

1943
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:21,778
How did you suddenly
turn into Sunny Deol?

1944
02:09:30,257 --> 02:09:32,088
Hurry up.
We'll use this in our Maruti.

1945
02:09:32,159 --> 02:09:33,183
Rascals.

1946
02:09:33,427 --> 02:09:36,487
There he comes.
Throw stones at him.

1947
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:41,567
Hit him.

1948
02:10:34,188 --> 02:10:36,452
l think he's seen
'Gadar' too many times.

1949
02:10:37,358 --> 02:10:38,256
Rip it.

1950
02:10:38,559 --> 02:10:39,685
Rip it.

1951
02:11:14,061 --> 02:11:17,087
Stop. Let go. Let go.

1952
02:11:32,079 --> 02:11:34,240
You dare hit an elderly woman.

1953
02:11:34,381 --> 02:11:35,643
l don't care.

1954
02:12:52,226 --> 02:12:54,319
Chautala madam.

1955
02:13:10,344 --> 02:13:13,370
Only cowards attack from the back.

1956
02:13:13,681 --> 02:13:15,774
How about a round
with the father as well.

1957
02:13:16,116 --> 02:13:17,140
Take that!

1958
02:13:23,157 --> 02:13:26,684
Are you okay, Bulbul?
- Babli.

1959
02:13:32,566 --> 02:13:34,534
Are you okay?

1960
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:48,307
Thank you for trusting me.

1961
02:13:49,149 --> 02:13:50,116
Here's the money.

1962
02:13:52,253 --> 02:13:54,744
What will we do with all this money?

1963
02:13:55,522 --> 02:13:56,511
You keep it.

1964
02:13:57,091 --> 02:13:59,082
lt will help you
in raising these kids.

1965
02:13:59,293 --> 02:14:00,260
Right?

1966
02:14:00,561 --> 02:14:02,722
Don't you two want anything?
- We do.

1967
02:14:03,364 --> 02:14:04,797
We want you.

1968
02:14:09,503 --> 02:14:12,267
Take me tojail.
- Not the jail.

1969
02:14:12,439 --> 02:14:14,737
We want to take you home.

1970
02:14:15,676 --> 02:14:16,665
Why?

1971
02:14:17,077 --> 02:14:19,102
We want to adopt you.
- Me.
