1
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,875
Move it, guys!

2
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,875
Whose marriage procession is it?

3
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,500
{\an8}Ignore it.
Concentrate on the game.

4
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,000
What the hell!

5
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,416
{\an8}Hey! Stop the music!

6
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,916
{\an8}Look at them,
bursting firecrackers like crazy!

7
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,708
{\an8}Are you planning to burst them
inside someone's house now?

8
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,875
{\an8}How dare the groom sit on a horse!

9
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,541
Get him down.

10
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,458
Do you think we'll let you pass
through our lanes like that?

11
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,166
{\an8}It's brave of you to come here wearing
a turban, and dance in front of us!

12
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,625
Hey, you! Get down!

13
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,000
{\an8}You can get back on the horse
after you pass this lane.

14
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,916
{\an8}Things were different back
then, Mr. Thakur.

15
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,833
Times have changed now.

16
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,333
{\an8}These young boys don't
follow the old customs anymore.

17
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,375
{\an8}Customs don't change with time!

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,208
Got it?

19
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,541
{\an8}Why are you still sitting on the horse?

20
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,875
{\an8}Kallan… get him down!

21
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,916
{\an8}Don't force him to
get down, Mr. Thakur.

22
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,041
{\an8}-They're young. They're drunk right now.
-Hey, move!

23
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,666
{\an8}-It will create an unnecessary conflict.
-Are you threatening me?

24
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,541
{\an8}Do you think I'll get
scared by your threat?

25
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,708
{\an8}Kallan, get the scoundrel down!

26
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,208
-Get down!
-Be quick!

27
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,250
-Come on!
-Stop them, Mr. Thakur.

28
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,250
{\an8}Don't you forget who you are, Roopram!

29
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,000
{\an8}-Hey!
-Move!

30
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,166
{\an8}We are in their locality.
They will make our lives miserable.

31
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,291
Get out of here!

32
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,958
Calm down.

33
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,583
We are almost done.

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,958
One last push.

35
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,541
-Use all your strength and push harder.
-One last push.

36
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,583
That's it. We are done.

37
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,791
Go and get some clothes for the baby.

38
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,375
Here.

39
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,875
Hold the baby.

40
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,458
Yes, Auntie.

41
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,458
Is it a girl or a boy, Manju?

42
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,791
Grandma… it's a girl.

43
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,458
This is unfortunate!

44
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,500
Why don't you just die?

45
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,666
This is your fourth daughter.

46
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,958
Give her to me!

47
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,875
-I won't let you poison her, Mother.
-Give her to me!

48
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,875
Open the door!

49
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,375
-What can I do if this is God's will?
-Hapless woman!

50
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,458
Wretch!

51
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,333
You only give birth to girls!

52
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,500
How dare you argue with me!

53
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,916
Hand her over to me, quickly!

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,791
I won't do that, Mother!

55
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,583
What happened?

56
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,333
What happened to my son?

57
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,750
He was shot in the Thakur neighborhood.
He died on the spot.

58
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, God! My dear son!

59
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,875
My child!

60
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,500
Roopram, why did you leave us so soon?

61
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,916
You have given birth to a witch!

62
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,041
She took her father's life!

63
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,083
One day, she will end up taking
everyone's lives! Mark my words!

64
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,250
INDRAMANI TRIPATHI

65
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,125
LATE PROFESSOR DEVIDUTT COLLEGE

66
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,875
Come, let's have some fun.

67
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,291
Hello, madam.

68
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,500
I have been looking for a book,
but I can't find it.

69
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,958
Which one?

70
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,875
The one written by Mr. Vatsyayana.

71
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,208
<i>Kama Sutra.</i>

72
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,791
LIBRARIAN

73
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,666
This broom will go up your derriere.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,416
Get out of here
before I take your IDs!

75
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,041
Scram!

76
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,541
They've barely learned to get it up,
and they want to read <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

77
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,833
Whom do we want as our president?

78
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,958
Indu Bhaiya!

79
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,791
-Make way for…
-Indu Bhaiya!

80
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,875
He will emerge victorious!

81
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,875
Indu Bhaiya will win!

82
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,833
He will emerge victorious!

83
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,625
Indu Bhaiya will--

84
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,250
Yes?

85
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,875
You can't campaign
in the library without permission.

86
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,250
Well, then, give me your permission.

87
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,708
You will have to make
a formal written request.

88
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,291
Where am I supposed to do that?

89
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,500
Here or in the hostel?

90
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,708
In the hostel.

91
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,125
INDRAMANI TRIPATHI

92
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,750
Mohit! Come on out, man!

93
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,291
{\an8}INDRAMANI TRIPATHI FOR PRESIDENT

94
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,625
It's for you.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,083
It's from Bombay.

96
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,375
-Wow!
-It's quite expensive.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,375
Tara doesn't wear
cheap accessories, anyway.

98
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,958
I thought you'd give me a gift
only after winning the election.

99
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,416
I'm going to win it, anyway.

100
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,958
Do you doubt it?

101
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,916
First step is to become
the Student Union President.

102
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,791
That'll open doors to
the legislative assembly election.

103
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:02,875
Then, I'll be a minister.

104
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,916
Then, maybe, I'll be the CM one day.

105
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,791
The CM, of course!

106
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,958
Learn to zip up your pants first.

107
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,458
Listen…

108
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,500
I didn't want to tell you…

109
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,208
but I am pregnant.

110
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,250
Again?

111
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,458
Couldn't you be more careful?

112
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,208
How is it my fault?

113
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,958
You should've taken the precaution.

114
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,458
You blamed me for this
the last time as well.

115
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,916
Fine.

116
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll ask Murari to take you to Lucknow.
You can have an abortion.

117
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,208
I won't have an abortion this time.

118
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,791
What else will you do?

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I want to get married.

120
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,750
To whom?

121
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,666
To you, of course.

122
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,791
Are you out of your mind?

123
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,416
Elections are just 15 days away.

124
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,125
How can you possibly think
about getting married?

125
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,750
I'm not asking for a grand wedding.

126
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,416
Let's go and quietly
get married in a temple.

127
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,125
We can tell everyone later.

128
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,875
What got you thinking
about marriage out of the blue?

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,791
Look, I know…

130
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,500
your family won't accept this alliance.

131
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,750
But we cannot go on
like this forever, Mr. Tripathi.

132
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:39,916
Why not?

133
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,875
We certainly can.

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,750
You can get married…
to whoever you want.

135
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,541
And I'll get married to the one
I am supposed to.

136
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,166
But I'll continue to love you… forever.

137
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,041
There's no need to
get married for that.

138
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,125
So, you want me to be your mistress!

139
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,958
Well, it used to be a tradition.

140
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,958
Back in the day,

141
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,958
our forefathers used to have
women of your caste as mistresses.

142
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,166
What's the big deal?

143
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,166
Well, then, I suggest you
ask your forefathers…

144
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,166
if you were ever nursed by a mistress.

145
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,791
You are instigating me now.

146
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,041
I cannot stoop this low.

147
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,666
I swear upon my dear father…

148
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,875
I never promised to marry you.

149
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,083
I do love you…

150
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,333
and I'll do that for the rest of my life.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,625
Give it a thought and let me know.

152
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,625
Don't run away, you bastard!

153
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,291
Stop!

154
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,791
Asshole!

155
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,083
Are you scared?

156
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,375
How dare you ask me
to be your mistress!

157
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,000
You are nothing without
these bootlickers.

158
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,708
Bloody coward!

159
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,416
Such a sissy!

160
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,875
You cannot even win the election
of this insignificant college, Indramani!

161
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,541
-Hey… ignore her.
-You've messed with the wrong girl!

162
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,250
You don't know me!

163
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,708
I'll distribute your love letters
in the entire college and expose you!

164
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,208
I promise you that!

165
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,750
INDRAMANI TRIPATHI FOR PRESIDENT

166
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,500
I am not someone that you
can just use and discard!

167
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,541
Student President, my foot!

168
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,416
He wants to be the CM someday!
As if that's going to happen!

169
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,625
Look at his face!

170
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,000
Bloody coward!

171
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,958
Such a wimp!

172
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,000
He can't just use me like that!

173
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,208
I am not like other girls.

174
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,375
I'll make sure he doesn't
win the college election.

175
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,500
Indu!

176
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,750
Couldn't you find anyone…

177
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,416
better than this girl?

178
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,750
What kind of a relationship
do you have with her?

179
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,416
It's nothing, Dad.

180
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,125
I helped her get a job.

181
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,166
She's making a scene just because
she's not getting a permanent position.

182
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,666
What if she says such things in public?

183
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,291
Tripathi family will be humiliated.

184
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,166
Please don't worry. I'll handle it.

185
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,958
I would like to know how.

186
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,375
-How do you intend to handle it?
-I'll explain things to her.

187
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,583
I'll talk to her
and clear the misunderstanding.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,333
I can't just shoot people like you do.

189
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,916
Why not?

190
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,875
This is the beginning
of your political career, Indu.

191
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,500
I have big dreams for you.

192
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,000
We cannot afford to have
this thing ruin our image.

193
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,125
This involves a woman.

194
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,666
Get things under control.

195
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,541
Otherwise, forget becoming
an MLA or a minister…

196
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,208
you won't even become
a college president.

197
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,708
Got it?

198
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,750
Indu Bhaiya had called.

199
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,375
He asked me to take
you to a doctor in Lucknow.

200
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,375
I told him it's not right
to do this so often.

201
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,666
But what you did…

202
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,916
You threatened
to campaign against him.

203
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,458
That's not right either.

204
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,666
Go tell your Bhaiya…

205
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,166
that I'll make sure he doesn't
get a single vote this time.

206
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,416
Why are you messing with him?

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,666
-He's willing to talk things out.
-Do you think I am scared of him?

208
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,208
Tell me.

209
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,916
You see what I am holding, right?

210
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,541
You'll get axed
if you stay here any longer.

211
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,583
-Get going.
-Fine, I'm going.

212
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,041
Go!

213
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,000
He came to my village to threaten me.

214
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,041
-Bloody dog.
-Hello?

215
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,166
Bhaiya…

216
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,250
she won't budge.

217
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,375
Okay, Bhaiya.

218
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:04,000
People like you don't deserve any respect.
You are unbelievably arrogant.

219
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,125
Bitch!

220
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,500
Stop hitting her face!
Hit her in the stomach!

221
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,125
Get her!

222
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,458
Get her!

223
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,416
-Hold her tight!
-Bablu!

224
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,375
Bablu!

225
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,833
Let go!

226
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,166
You…

227
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,833
How dare you!

228
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,083
Go away!

229
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,333
Get her! She's running away!

230
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,541
Hit her in the stomach!

231
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,041
How dare you threaten Indu Bhaiya!

232
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,000
Keep hitting her!

233
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,333
There you go!

234
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,083
Keep hitting her!

235
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,958
Get them!

236
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,125
Let's go!

237
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,125
PARIVARTAN PARTY OF INDIA
MASTER SURAJBHAN (DIRECTOR)

238
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,708
It will sting a little bit.
It's almost done.

239
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,500
You are…

240
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,958
Roopram's daughter, right?

241
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,000
-Did you know him?
-Yes.

242
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,750
I also know how he died.

243
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,958
Our party had agitated…

244
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,541
on a large scale to seek
compensation for his death.

245
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,875
Thank you.

246
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,291
We got 6,000 rupees compensation
from the government.

247
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,208
Who else is there in your family?

248
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,750
My mom, my younger brother and I.

249
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,708
He's actually a cousin.

250
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,208
Everyone says that there has
to be one male member in the house.

251
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,291
By the way…

252
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,500
who were those guys?

253
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,833
It's a personal matter.

254
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,250
Oh, really?

255
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,458
Do you openly get thrashed
over a personal matter?

256
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,750
Sundar, go and get the disinfectant.

257
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,875
Okay.

258
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,416
I had inquired about this
"personal matter" of yours.

259
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,333
His name is Indramani Tripathi, right?

260
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,666
Anyway… you can do as you please.

261
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,416
Stay here tonight.

262
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,041
I'll take you back
to the village in the morning.

263
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,833
I don't want to go back to the village.

264
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,625
Then, what do you want to do?

265
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,500
I want to seek revenge.

266
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,458
I see.

267
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,416
And how is that going to help?

268
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,750
Will the system change if you
kill some Indramani Tripathi?

269
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,666
Will they stop suppressing
anyone who rebels for a change?

270
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:48,041
Or will that allow people from our caste
to ride a horse and enter temples?

271
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,375
Powerful people have ruled
with arrogance so far.

272
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,791
And their arrogance will be destroyed…
by our rule.

273
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,250
Anyway, forget it.

274
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,458
Being self-centered is
a sign of cowardice, Tara.

275
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:16,291
I will support you if you wish
to do something for the community.

276
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,000
If you only wish to seek
your personal revenge…

277
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,000
then you may leave.

278
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,541
Babasahib's image is so small.

279
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,500
-Right.
-Pay attention to the details.

280
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,125
-Masterji.
-If-- Yes?

281
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,416
Here are some offerings.

282
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,666
Mr. Kushwaha…

283
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,541
I'll start accepting offerings,
when people of my community…

284
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,666
will be allowed inside temples.

285
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,291
Okay? Let's go.
We've got a lot of work to do.

286
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,833
If we think about all this, then we--

287
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,833
Until when do you plan
to ride a bicycle, Masterji?

288
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,000
Hop onto your new ride.

289
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,625
For whom are you doing this?

290
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,541
For yourself or for the community?

291
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,958
For you.

292
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:21,916
Let's go.

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,708
-Long live Parivartan Party!
-Long live Parivartan Party!

294
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,166
<i>Let's fight for a better future</i>

295
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,750
<i>Let's give wings to our dreams</i>

296
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:39,083
<i>Let go of all your fears</i>

297
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,833
<i>Keep your eyes on the stars</i>
<i>and your feet on the ground</i>

298
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:51,166
<i>Spread your wings</i>
<i>For it's time to fly</i>

299
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,375
A NATION THAT FORGETS ITS PAST
HAS NO FUTURE

300
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,958
<i>For it's time to fly</i>

301
00:20:56,083 --> 00:21:00,500
<i>Break free from all the shackles</i>

302
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:05,250
<i>Break free!</i>

303
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,625
<i>Spread your wings</i>
<i>For it's time to fly</i>

304
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,708
<i>Break free from all the shackles</i>

305
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:17,208
<i>Make your spirits soar</i>

306
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,625
<i>Spread your wings</i>
<i>For it's time to fly</i>

307
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,083
<i>Break free from all the shackles</i>

308
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:27,083
<i>Make your spirits soar</i>

309
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,625
What is this, Masterji?

310
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,250
Your BP is once again quite low.

311
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,458
Tara, please ask him to get some rest.

312
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,916
I am tired of making him
understand, Dr. Laxmi.

313
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,250
He doesn't listen to me.

314
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,958
Elections are just around the corner.

315
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,458
When do you expect me
to work if not now?

316
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,500
Hail Bheem! Hail India!

317
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,791
Greetings to you, Masterji.

318
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,083
Masterji…

319
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,666
please accept this small gift.

320
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,416
Come closer. Over here.

321
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,000
Masterji, I know you are
well-respected within the community.

322
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,791
You've made your party stronger by
visiting different villages on a bicycle.

323
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,333
You'll give the biggies
a run for their money

324
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,708
with your performance in
the next assembly election.

325
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,750
However…

326
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,416
I'm not sure if you can win alone.

327
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,041
If we join hands…

328
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,750
and fight the next election…

329
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,875
then we'll certainly
form the next government.

330
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,875
I have no doubts about it, Masterji.

331
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,166
Circumstances are in our favor.

332
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,083
If we join forces and attack, then…

333
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,666
we can even get Lucknow
down on its knees.

334
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,791
You are here
to form an alliance with us,

335
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,541
but you aren't even willing
to drink the tea here.

336
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,125
Nothing like that.
Give me that, madam.

337
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,208
It is indeed a great thought.

338
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,458
But unlike yours,

339
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,291
our party decisions are made
unanimously, Mr. Arvind.

340
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,291
So, let all of us discuss this…

341
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,125
and get back to you with our decision.

342
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,833
I suggest you make
the decision quickly, Masterji.

343
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,416
Rumor has it that
the top brass in Lucknow

344
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,875
are willing to join hands with me.

345
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,833
I'm afraid someone else
might contact me before you do.

346
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,416
Let's go.

347
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,166
Masterji…

348
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,833
I think we shouldn't accept
Arvind Singh's proposal.

349
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:05,458
Collaborating with someone else
to gain power goes against our purpose.

350
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,958
Masterji, this will open gates
for others to follow suit.

351
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,708
Are we supposed to collaborate
with everyone now?

352
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:15,333
Uncle, is this a political
party or a drama group?

353
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,041
-In my opinion--
-Who asked for your opinion?

354
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,166
Do you have to interrupt when
the senior party members are talking?

355
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,291
Please leave.

356
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,875
What are you doing?

357
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,875
Do you plan to break my leg?

358
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,083
Why did you scold
me in front of everyone?

359
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,875
I didn't scold you.

360
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,791
I just made you understand.
In front of senior leaders--

361
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,625
What if these senior leaders talk shit?

362
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:47,750
You…

363
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,458
I have told you so many times!

364
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,000
You need to mind your language.

365
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,541
She has no filter-- Tell me!

366
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,666
Did they say anything wrong?

367
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,375
Of course!

368
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
Uncle, you are the one who keeps saying

369
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:05,458
that the first step to bring about
change is to change the reign.

370
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,541
And today, when the opportunity
came knocking at our door…

371
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,791
the oldies started to freak out!

372
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:16,166
Okay, fine.
You tell me what we should do.

373
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,625
Should we blindly
collaborate with Arvind Singh

374
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,208
without giving it a thought?

375
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,500
Who said you should
blindly accept it, Uncle?

376
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,791
Collaborate with him
with your eyes wide open.

377
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,041
You should be ready
to compromise, but on your terms.

378
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,583
Think about it, Uncle.

379
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,250
Imagine how much we'll be able
to do for our people if one among us

380
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,041
gets elected as the MLA,
the minister, or even the CM!

381
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,375
Give it a thought.

382
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,041
You seem to have
an extensive knowledge of politics now.

383
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,125
I am your pupil.

384
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:49,125
If I don't learn about these things,
then what's the use of being here?

385
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,583
Alright.

386
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,583
Do one thing.

387
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:56,375
Go and discuss the terms
of the alliance with Arvind Singh.

388
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,458
-Me?
-Yes.

389
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,416
You think you are
an expert in politics.

390
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:02,958
So, prove yourself.

391
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:06,333
But please watch your language.

392
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,166
Don't worry, Uncle.

393
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:10,416
I only curse when needed.

394
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,208
It's not that I love to curse.

395
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm pleased to hear that
Masterji approves of our proposal.

396
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,583
But we have few conditions.

397
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,625
Our party will contest
the election on 300 seats,

398
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,041
while yours will
contest on 104 seats only.

399
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:32,625
After we win the elections,
the CM will be chosen from our party.

400
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,458
Your party will get five ministers.

401
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,500
Well…

402
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,750
I wanted to form a cordial alliance,

403
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:44,500
but you seem to have far too
many conditions going for it.

404
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,666
I had discussed this with Masterji.

405
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,666
We will take turns to appoint
CM from our respectable parties.

406
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,583
But for the first two and a half years,
the CM will be from our party.

407
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,291
Alright. I accept it.

408
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,208
But we will fight election
on 202 seats out of the 404.

409
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,583
-Fifty-fifty.
-Fifty-fifty.

410
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,000
That would make sense
only if we have equal mass base.

411
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,250
Are you telling us that our
mass base is less than yours, madam?

412
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,291
I'm not even talking to you.

413
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,416
Why are you interrupting?

414
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,166
Who is the party president,
you or him?

415
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,750
That's enough. Please go.

416
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,333
What if I don't accept
these conditions?

417
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:32,750
No.

418
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,541
You can't refuse.

419
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,208
Because you know that I am right.

420
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,625
But if you do refuse,

421
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,875
then I'll have you know that

422
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:46,000
many people have been wanting
to contact Masterji as well.

423
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,208
In Lucknow as well as in Delhi.

424
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:52,791
So… I hope
you reach a decision quickly.

425
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,166
I'm afraid someone else
might contact him before you do.

426
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,708
Goodbye.

427
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,833
You, kiddo,
should have Indian gooseberries.

428
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,458
It keeps the intestine clean
and avoids slip of the tongue as well.

429
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,416
Thanks!

430
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,750
Who is that girl?

431
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,041
And how is she related to Masterji?

432
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,166
No one knows for sure.

433
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,000
I heard that she
ran away from home,

434
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,333
and Masterji gave her shelter.

435
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:36,708
You could call her his pupil,
co-worker or his mistress.

436
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,291
He just took her in,
no questions asked.

437
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,958
Masterji, we've got applications
from 20 candidates for each seat.

438
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,708
The workers are filled with enthusiasm.

439
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:53,166
This enthusiasm is what we sought,
Mr. Kushwaha.

440
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:59,125
Mr. Ansari, how many applications
have we got for Gauriganj?

441
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,000
None, Masterji.

442
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,833
Well, that is a difficult seat to win.

443
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,666
-Uncle?
-Yes?

444
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,250
Why don't you make Tara Didi
contest from there?

445
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,166
The outcome aside,
it'll certainly be entertaining.

446
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:18,000
If she contests dressed like this
even her family won't vote for her.

447
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,000
Just give me a chance, Uncle.

448
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:32,041
I'll have a complete makeover and give
actresses a good run for their money.

449
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,916
That's the sitting CM's seat.

450
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,958
Forfeiture of security deposit
is certain. Do you understand?

451
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,333
I won't show you my face again
if that happens.

452
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,583
I promise I'll have the CM
scrambling around to save his seat.

453
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,500
Listen up, residents of Gauriganj!

454
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:57,666
For the upliftment of the suppressed,
repressed and backward class,

455
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,875
we present to you the joint candidate
of Parivartan Party and Vikas Party!

456
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:07,250
Let's give a big round of applause
and welcome Tara Roopram.

457
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,708
Tara Didi!

458
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,041
I hope she can give the speech,
Mr. Kushwaha.

459
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:34,083
Masterji made a mistake
by giving her a chance.

460
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,333
PARIVARTAN PARTY AND VIKAS PARTY
GRAND ALLIANCE

461
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,833
How do I look?

462
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,416
Dynamic?

463
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,958
Bofors?

464
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,583
Hot?

465
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,291
Tell me!

466
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,958
Hot!

467
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,791
Right.

468
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,333
Well, I loved wearing
jeans and t-shirt.

469
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,125
But these senior citizens said,

470
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,625
"Tara, you are contesting an election.

471
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,541
You should change your getup."

472
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,875
So, I wore a sari.

473
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,791
By the way…

474
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:19,833
I'm contesting this election
neither to win…

475
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,625
nor to lose.

476
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:27,583
I just want to find out one thing.

477
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,458
For the last 15 years,
Masterji has been going around

478
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:36,041
different villages on his bicycle.

479
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:39,708
Has that had any effect on you people

480
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:43,500
or were all his efforts futile?

481
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:49,291
I only want to talk about…

482
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,916
our community

483
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:57,333
and our people
in this legislative sector.

484
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,500
Because no one else
really cares about you!

485
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,125
Be it the sectarian electoral symbol,

486
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,375
the turban electoral symbol,

487
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,000
or the coffer electoral symbol.

488
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,541
And that's why I say…

489
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:14,541
it's time to boot the dictators out!

490
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:26,000
In conclusion, I would
like to tell my young friends that…

491
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:30,708
I am single.
I am sharp like a dagger.

492
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,708
And I am all yours!

493
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,333
Who should be our leader?

494
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,500
Tara Roopram!

495
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,875
Who should be our leader?

496
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,916
This is for you.

497
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,208
And this is for you.
Here you go.

498
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:56,250
Listen! Please greet
the CM from a distance.

499
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,541
Okay? Don't touch him.

500
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,750
Elections are just
around the corner.

501
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:06,375
Chief Minister Devendra Prasad Singh
had lunch at a Dalit's residence

502
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,583
to change his image and
appease the backward vote bank.

503
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,250
Let's see whether this move

504
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,750
helps him get any
backward and Dalit votes.

505
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:16,916
Madam, do you actually
believe that this act is real?

506
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,125
I don't care whether it's real or not.

507
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,500
My job is to report,
and that's what I've done.

508
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,125
I see.

509
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,958
Then report this as well.

510
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,458
Excuse me.

511
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,791
-Hello!
-Point the camera at her.

512
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,541
Hey, Mr. CM!

513
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,791
Mr. Chief Minister! Hello!

514
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:35,833
You came over uninvited because
the election is approaching, right?

515
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,166
If you are so interested
in eating at our place,

516
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,666
then why don't you eat what we eat?

517
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,250
Eat stale or leftover food.
Have people's half-eaten meals.

518
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,375
Eat a dead rat.

519
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,833
Only then we will know that
you have empathy towards us!

520
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:53,416
You won't get votes of the poor
just because you're eating

521
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,291
a five-star restaurant's food
in their plates!

522
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,083
People have learned the truth.

523
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,958
These acts will no longer work!

524
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,416
Come on, madam. Let's go.

525
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,500
-Long live…
-Tara Roopram!

526
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,625
-Long live…
-Tara Roopram!

527
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,583
-Long live…
-Tara Roopram!

528
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,416
-Long live…
-Tara Roopram!

529
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,416
-Long live…

-Long live…
-Tara Roopram!

00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:31,833
<i>Breaking news coming in!</i>

<i>in the legislative sector of Gauriganj,</i>

542
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,416
<i>while she was campaigning.</i>

543
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,291
I am not scared
of their bullets or attacks.

544
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:50,458
There's only one thing
I'd like to say to the CM.

545
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:55,708
This newbie is going to
have you run for the hills.

546
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,500
Mark my words.

547
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,833
The person whose
victory will be celebrated

548
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:02,750
outside the counting center will be Tara.

549
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,333
Tara Roopram.

550
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,833
{\an8}WHO WILL BE
THE NEXT CHIEF MINISTER?

551
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:11,375
{\an8}Master Surajbhan's Parivartan Party
and Arvind Singh's Vikas Party

552
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:15,291
are leading the state assembly elections.

553
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,333
From the counting done so far,

554
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:20,291
we have learned that
this alliance has won 180 seats,

555
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:25,125
and their candidates are taking lead
against their opponents by 60 seats.

556
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,291
<i>Breaking news coming in!</i>

557
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,708

561
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,958
-Long live…
-Tara Didi!

562
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,000
-Long live…

563
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,000

-Long live…
-Tara Didi!

576
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:13,750
I congratulate everyone
for winning the elections.

577
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,333
-Long live…
-Parivartan Party!

578
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:19,500
-Long live…
-Parivartan Party!

579
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,250
-Long live…
-Masterji!

580
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,416
-Long live…
-Masterji!

581
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,333
Exactly 15 years ago, I had
formed this party with this very aim.

582
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,208
Being in power
is a unique experience.

583
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:36,375
On the one hand, it gives you
the opportunity to serve people.

584
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:42,250
And on the other hand,
this kind of power can corrupt you.

585
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,166
We should never forget one thing.

586
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,583
For the Parivartan Party,

587
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,041
this power is just a stepping stone,

588
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,291
and not the ultimate goal.

589
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,708
Like all of you know…

590
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:02,916
we now need to form a government
in alliance with Vikas Party.

591
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:05,666
But before that, I would like to
discuss something very important.

592
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,333
We need to select
a candidate from our party…

593
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,583
for the post of Chief Minister.

594
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,375
I would like everyone
to give their suggestions.

595
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,458
So, tell me.

596
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:22,541
Which candidate do you
see as your future Chief Minister?

597
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,708
Masterji, I think our
CM candidate should be

598
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,750
a senior member with
a lot of experience.

599
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,583
Mr. Kushwaha is the senior most
member of our party after you.

600
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,541
I would like to suggest his name.

601
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:37,333
-That's good.
-Yes, Mr. Kushwaha is the ideal candidate.

602
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,416
-Long live…
-O.P. Kushwaha!

603
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,291
-Long live…
-O.P. Kushwaha!

604
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,041
-Long live…
-O.P. Kushwaha!

605
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,000
-Long live…
-O.P. Kushwaha!

606
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,791
-Long live…
-O.P. Kushwaha!

607
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,041
Mr. Kushwaha, just give me some time.

608
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,000
-Long live…
-O.P. Kushwaha!

609
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,666
Alright.

610
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,166
Let me ponder on this.

611
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,625
I'll let you know my decision soon.

612
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,791
Why does Masterji
need to think about it?

613
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,500
Chief Minister?

614
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,750
Stop lying!

615
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,041
Who will make you the CM?

616
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,958
Quit daydreaming about it!
You won the election by fluke.

617
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,375
Are you serious?

618
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,416
Will you really be the CM?

619
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,416
I mean… the CM of Uttar Pradesh?

620
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,208
Do you want to ride in
a car with red beacon?

621
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,625
Come again?

622
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,416
Do you want to ride in
a car with red beacon?

623
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:09,583
I wore a helmet and used
a locally made gun to take a shot at you,

624
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,250
and you're going to be the CM!

625
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,583
I didn't know this would happen.

626
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:17,625
I had promised Uncle
that I'd defeat the CM.

627
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,625
That's why I had to take your help.

628
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:26,625
I, Tara Roopram,
do swear in the name of God,

629
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,375
that I will bear true
faith and allegiance,

630
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:33,458
to the Constitution of India
as by law established.

631
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:38,000
I will uphold the sovereignty
and integrity of India.

632
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,500
I will faithfully and conscientiously

633
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:46,500
discharge my duties
as the Chief Minister of the state.

634
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:51,458
And I will do right
to all manner of people,

635
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,875
in accordance with the
constitution and the law,

636
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,500
without fear or favor,
affection or ill-will.

637
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,750
-Jai Hind, madam.
-Jai Hind.

638
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,166
I am Danish Rehman Khan, your OSD.

639
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,708
-Your entourage is here. This way, please.
-Let's go.

640
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:25,791
-Long live Tara Didi!
-Long live Tara Didi!

641
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,958
-Long live our new Chief Minister!
-Long live our new Chief Minister!

642
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:33,458
-Long live Tara Didi!
-Long live Tara Didi!

643
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:37,458
-Long live our new Chief Minister!
-Long live our new Chief Minister!

644
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,583
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY

645
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,208
Such a big house!

646
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,625
Who else is going to stay here?

647
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,791
It is our house, Mom.

648
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,250
We will be staying here.

649
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:12,083
There is a pond and
a fountain outside, Tara.

650
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:14,791
Now, there will be no shortage
of water to wash our clothes.

651
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,333
You will no longer
need to wash clothes, Mom.

652
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:23,000
Now, you will live like a queen here.

653
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,750
Had your grandma been alive,
she would have seen

654
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:29,833
the roaring success of the girl

655
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,750
she intended to poison at birth.

656
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,041
This has been possible
because of you, Masterji.

657
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,333
May God bless you with a long life.

658
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,708
This is just the beginning for Tara.

659
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,250
She has a long road ahead of her.

660
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,500
Sundar, go and get us a rickshaw.

661
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,208
Where are you going, Uncle?

662
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,958
I'm going back home.

663
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,125
You are the elected
representative of the people.

664
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,875
I will stay with the people
as their guard.

665
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,291
And you better get this straight.

666
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:02,583
If you make a mistake,

667
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:05,500
your Uncle won't refrain
from reprimanding you.

668
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:06,958
I have you by my side.

669
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,750
You won't let me make any mistake.

670
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,000
UTTAR PRADESH GOVERNMENT

671
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:39,125
Madam, Uttar Pradesh
is the biggest state of our country.

672
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,916
It's very difficult to run it.

673
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:45,250
So, I have divided
Uttar Pradesh into five zones.

674
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:49,458
I've studied that this method will make it
easier for us to implement schemes.

675
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,583
-Okay.
-Like this entire area of Bundelkhand

676
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,833
is extremely backward.

677
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,416
Sir!

678
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,875
The president of Vikas Party
has sent this file.

679
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,000
What is it?

680
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,458
It's a list from Mr. Arvind Singh
consisting names

681
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,875
of those who will become
ministers as per his quota.

682
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,041
Amazing!

683
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:15,375
Arvind sent the list
as soon as I joined the office!

684
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:18,791
Madam, the first name on
this list is Yuvraj Singh Yadav.

685
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,958
He is Mr. Arvind Singh's maternal uncle.

686
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,166
Okay.

687
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,125
The second name is
Mahesh Kumar Malvi.

688
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,833
Mr. Malvi is a renowned businessman

689
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,583
who funds all his elections.

690
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,875
Right!

691
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,666
The third name is Anil Chaudhary.

692
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,666
He is Mr. Arvind's childhood friend.

693
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,041
I see.

694
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,375
The fourth name is
Mohammad Rafiq-ul Haq.

695
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:42,125
He used to be
Mr. Arvind's father's bodyguard.

696
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:45,208
Arvind has formed a kitchen cabinet.

697
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,875
-So it seems.
-There's nothing he can do.

698
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,458
It's a coalition government.

699
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,958
Madam, the fifth name on
the list is Indramani Tripathi.

700
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,458
Madam, he's a first-time MLA.

701
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,791
He has been a part
of student politics.

702
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,375
Is he the one from
Hussainganj Degree College?

703
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,750
Yes.

704
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:04,500
You are from the same college, right?

705
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,208
You might know him.

706
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,000
No. I don't remember him.

707
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,958
So…

708
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:21,125
after Bundelkhand comes Lucknow and…

709
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,416
When are we celebrating
<i>Raksha Bandhan</i> this year?

710
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,583
Continuing with the
traditions of <i>Raksha Bandhan</i>,

711
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:35,708
Chief Minister Tara Roopram
tied a <i>rakhi</i> to Arvind Singh,

712
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,833
her alliance partner
and the President of Vikas Party.

713
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:42,250
Only time will tell
how long this bond will last

714
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:45,208
and keep this coalition together.

715
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,875
This way, madam.

716
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:55,416
God is merciful!

717
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,458
Tell me, madam.

718
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,333
What should I gift you
on <i>Raksha Bandhan</i>?

719
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:04,750
What do I ask for, brother?

720
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,666
You have given me everything.

721
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,458
But we still need to follow
the customs of this festival.

722
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,125
Tell me, what do you want?

723
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:16,833
I want you to strike off
one name from your list of ministers.

724
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,541
Whose name?

725
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,666
Indramani Tripathi.

726
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:23,375
Indu?

727
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:25,958
Why?

728
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,208
What has that poor man done to you?

729
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,875
Won't I get the gift
without giving you a reason?

730
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,541
Nothing like that, madam.

731
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,375
He is like a brother to me.

732
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:41,000
I joined politics
after his father showed me the ropes.

733
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,166
You see…

734
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:47,541
I cannot displease him
in order to fulfill your wish.

735
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:55,458
Madam, I don't know if there's some
issue between you and Indramani.

736
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:59,291
But it will be difficult
to strike him off the list.

737
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:05,208
And what if I say it will be
difficult for me to make him a minister?

738
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,041
Are you threatening me?

739
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:12,250
That too on the occasion
of <i>Raksha Bandhan</i>?

740
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,083
Listen, madam.

741
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:22,958
You ought to ignore
trivial matters in politics.

742
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,916
If you let things
keep hurting your pride…

743
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,583
you will end up
losing your pride completely.

744
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:42,041
Besides, our party has
the right to make this decision.

745
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,333
Did I question Masterji's decision

746
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:49,625
of making you the CM
instead of Mr. Kushwaha?

747
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,666
You didn't deserve the post.

748
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,458
And yet,
you ended up becoming the CM.

749
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:02,958
I defeated the sitting CM, brother.

750
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,875
Who deserves the post if not me,
perhaps Mahinder Singh Dhoni?

751
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:19,000
I understood her character
the day I met her for the first time.

752
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,583
Just wait and watch…

753
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:28,875
how I use Indu to control
her for the next two and a half years.

754
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,000
It's not a big deal.

755
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:37,458
It's a coalition government.

756
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:41,750
One has to often
accept such decisions.

757
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:45,958
Heed my advice and
don't exaggerate the matter.

758
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:49,458
Just focus on your work and
forget about Indramani Tripathi.

759
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:50,708
Forget about him?

760
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:53,750
Forget about the man
who ruined my reputation?

761
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:59,541
Uncle, I feel like castrating him!
How can I make him a minister?

762
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,333
You want me to compromise?

763
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,666
Uncle, if I compromise on this matter,

764
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,833
they'll make me compromise
on some other matter tomorrow.

765
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,750
If I give in today, I'll always
be compelled to do as they say.

766
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,333
This is what that bloody
Arvind Singh wants!

767
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,083
What will you do then?

768
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,416
You want to dissolve the government
over such a trivial matter?

769
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,666
A trivial matter?

770
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,541
You are supporting
him instead of me!

771
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:20,541
Why don't you understand?

772
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,041
Why don't you understand?

773
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,625
I cannot let the government suffer
on account of your personal grudges.

774
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,041
This is my order.

775
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,250
Let Indramani Tripathi become
a minister and end this matter.

776
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:38,500
And what if I don't?

777
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,333
-Will you go against me?
-Yes.

778
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:48,791
I will go against you
if you are wrong, Uncle.

779
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:51,958
Quit being stubborn, Tara.

780
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,375
I won't.

781
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,083
I cannot make compromises
for a political gain, Uncle.

782
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:01,375
There's no way
Indramani Tripathi will become a minister.

783
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,208
Look, madam,
I'm not being stubborn here.

784
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:25,791
I'm only following traditions.

785
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:29,166
Some people just aren't
allowed inside temples.

786
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:31,791
And if I break with tradition,

787
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,791
there will be a ruckus.

788
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,000
It could become
an issue of law and order.

789
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,625
They are allowed to seek
blessings from outside, madam.

790
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,000
Besides, God is present everywhere.

791
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,833
Both inside and outside the temple.

792
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,375
Alright then,
close its doors for everyone.

793
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:51,416
All those who wish to seek
God's blessings can do it from outside.

794
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,833
-Okay?
-We cannot do that, madam.

795
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:58,166
It'll be better if we
retain the arrangement.

796
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:01,750
The arrangement!

797
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,791
I don't like this arrangement, sir.

798
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:09,000
You guys have claimed rights

799
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,708
over the only thing that
belongs to everyone.

800
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,708
I'm going inside to pray to God.

801
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:16,250
You're well aware of
my caste as well as my status.

802
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,041
If you create a ruckus out here,

803
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:21,375
I'll have you stripped and thrashed.

804
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,500
Madam, I suggest the we
don't break the arrangement…

805
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,541
Who is he?

806
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:26,916
Madam, he's the DM.

807
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,500
Did I ask you for your suggestion?

808
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,708
Do you want to get
transferred to Banaras?

809
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,250
You can spend all your time
in the temples there.

810
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:35,791
Go and get me a veneration plate.

811
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:38,625
-Sorry, madam.
-He's giving me suggestions!

812
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,291
Get the holy water.

813
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:23,250
We will have to purify
the whole courtyard.

814
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,166
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

815
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,083
-Long live…

00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:28,791

00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:32,458

00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:33,916

And this one.

849
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,875
Mr. Arvind Singh is trying to
turn the press against you.

850
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,541
Do you understand his game?

851
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,625
I understand everything, Mr. Khan.

852
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:39,416
It will certainly anger a few people.

853
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,750
But all of this will only
strengthen our vote bank.

854
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:47,625
I'll be the CM only for
two and a half years, Mr. Khan.

855
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,916
But I'll serve the people so well that

856
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,041
they'll remember me
for the next many years.

857
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:53,166
Madam.

858
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:55,000
An MLA is here to meet you.

859
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,541
Greetings!

860
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,541
I thought you are upset with me.

861
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,458
So, I thought I should meet you.

862
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,166
How dare you barge in like that?

863
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:07,458
Look…

864
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,708
I have come here with a request.

865
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,416
Let bygones be bygones.

866
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:18,458
Appoint me as a minister and
give me a chance to serve the people.

867
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:21,708
You are the CM now.

868
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:25,416
It is beneath you to
seek revenge for the past.

869
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:30,375
If you don't let go of the past,
I'll be reminded of it as well.

870
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:34,333
I still have many fond
memories of room number 56

871
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:37,041
of the boys' hostel
in my mobile phone.

872
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,625
Mind your language, sir.

873
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:43,416
Mr. Khan, you please wait
outside and send Bablu in.

874
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,458
Sure, madam.

875
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,833
Didn't your father die last month?

876
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:14,208
What kind of a son are you?

877
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,375
Senior Tripathi passed away,

878
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,791
and you didn't even
shave your head out of respect!

879
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,708
I'm an old flame of yours.

880
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,708
So, let me help you with it.

881
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,041
Do not move.

882
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:42,166
Don't move, or else you'll be hurt.

883
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:25,333
BAJRANGBALI TEMPLE

884
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,083
-Mr. Kushwaha.
-Yes?

885
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,708
What are the updates?

886
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,666
I'm working on the
task you had assigned me.

887
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,958
I have spoken to most of the MLAs.

888
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:44,708
Almost everyone in the party has agreed.

889
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:48,833
What about Masterji?

890
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:52,041
He is very upset with Tara Madam
after what she did to Indramani.

891
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:54,041
He isn't feeling well.

892
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,083
He has gone to Faizabad Circuit House
to get some rest.

893
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:59,291
-Would you do me a favor?
-Sure.

894
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,708
Invite all the MLAs for dinner.

895
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:04,916
Okay.

896
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,625
Let's get together
and come up with a plan.

897
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,208
We need to hurry.

898
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,000
The CM is becoming very popular
by building new roads and dams.

899
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:17,416
I also heard there's metro
coming up in Lucknow.

900
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,916
Mr. Kushwaha,
let me tell you something.

901
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:27,208
The one who builds metro here,
always loses the elections.

902
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:31,375
And the one who builds a temple, wins it.

903
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,958
OFFICIAL CIRCUIT HOUSE, FAIZABAD
(UTTAR PRADESH)

904
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,041
Is he taking his medicines on time?

905
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,333
No, Tara Didi.

906
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,875
He doesn't take it even
when I keep it on his bedside.

907
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,125
He has grown so weak.

908
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,791
I thought he would get some rest here,
at the Circuit House.

909
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,166
But he doesn't get
any chance to rest.

910
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,958
Why? Who's disturbing him over here?

911
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,666
Someone or other keeps
showing up from Lucknow.

912
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,125
-From Lucknow?
-Yes.

913
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,208
There's Mr. Kushwaha, Mr. Ansari,

914
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,333
some MLAs and ministers.

915
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:04,041
And Mr. Arvind has also been
visiting him for the last few days.

916
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:06,791
How will he possibly rest
amidst all of this?

917
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,416
-Didi.
-Yes?

918
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,541
May I ask you something?

919
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:14,750
Sure.

920
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:17,208
Why are all these people against you?

921
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:20,958
They all come here
and criticize you.

922
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,916
They are scared of me.

923
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:25,333
What about Uncle?

924
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,958
Looks like some big shot lives here.

925
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:32,000
The Chief Minister herself
is here to cook!

926
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,250
Uncle!

927
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,000
God bless you.

928
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,708
The aroma is amazing!

929
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:39,708
What are you making right now?

930
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:40,875
Your favorite dishes.

931
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,291
<i>Lithi chokha</i> and <i>moong dal halwa</i>.

932
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,625
Wonderful!

933
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,250
I'm good.

934
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:56,083
Uncle is enjoying his meal
after a long time.

935
00:58:56,375 --> 00:59:01,541
Well… how often do I get to
relish a meal cooked by the CM?

936
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,000
Why are you standing here?
Go. Get me some <i>halwa</i>.

937
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:15,708
I'm fine.
Thanks, dear.

938
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:17,958
I will go to sleep.

939
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,291
I have called the MLAs
for a meeting tomorrow.

940
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,375
I think you should resign.

941
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:40,083
Running a government
is very complicated, dear.

942
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:42,583
I'll resign if you ask me to.

943
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:45,291
But may I ask the reason?

944
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,375
Everyone seems to be upset with you.

945
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,666
Who is everyone?

946
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,458
Kushwaha?

947
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,375
The one who couldn't
become the CM because of me?

948
00:59:58,666 --> 00:59:59,875
Or Arvind Singh…

949
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:02,625
who has been wanting to become
the CM before my tenure ends?

950
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:05,541
They have been talking behind my back

951
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,333
and trying to turn you against me.

952
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
They have even incited
my MLAs and ministers.

953
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:12,000
I never came to you
complaining about anyone, Uncle.

954
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,291
Your incessant arguments
have only increased

955
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:18,125
ever since you became the CM.

956
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,708
I didn't say anything when you
didn't make Indramani Tripathi a minister.

957
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:26,916
I didn't say anything even when
you tonsured him in your office.

958
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,583
And your brother, Bablu…

959
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:31,958
I get complaints about him every day.

960
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,250
I still don't say anything.

961
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:39,250
Media criticizes your
government's policies every day.

962
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,958
Did I ever question you?

963
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,208
What policies?

964
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,000
What policies, Uncle?

965
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:48,791
Is it wrong to let the
backward class enter the temple?

966
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:51,250
Is it wrong to
distribute bicycles to girls?

967
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,166
Is it wrong to build
roads, schools and metro?

968
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,166
Why don't you understand, Uncle?

969
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:59,791
I'm doing exactly
what you wanted to do.

970
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:02,166
My efforts are only
strengthening the party.

971
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,291
And that scoundrel Arvind Singh
cannot digest that.

972
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,416
He goes to the media
and talks trash about me--

973
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:09,708
He's trying to ruin
my reputation, Uncle!

974
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,166
-They are conspiring against me.
-Enough!

975
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,458
That's enough.

976
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,500
It didn't take you long to
become a dirty politician.

977
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:18,250
Right?

978
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,416
Just because you have
to bear a little criticism,

979
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,458
you're accusing them
of conspiring against you.

980
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:26,166
-Uncle, try to understand--
-I don't want to argue about this anymore.

981
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,833
I'm saying this for your own good.

982
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:33,458
You try to understand.

983
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,541
In politics…

984
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:39,625
when you start losing the
support of your own people,

985
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,125
the best thing to do
is to step down.

986
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,625
Have I lost your
support as well, Uncle?

987
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,958
Switch off the lights
on your way out.

988
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,500
OFFICIAL CIRCUIT HOUSE, FAIZABAD
(UTTAR PRADESH)

989
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,000
I've been told that…

990
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:23,125
you are not pleased with
the Chief Minister's performance,

991
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:26,333
and wish to have
a new Chief Minister.

992
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,583
I can understand.

993
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:31,125
This being a coalition government,

994
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:36,333
and our Chief Minister
being inexperienced,

995
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,250
makes the matter
a little complicated.

996
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:43,125
I know that
the Chief Minister has made mistakes.

997
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,541
She has made many mistakes.

998
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:49,583
Your anger and all your complaints

999
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,416
are completely justified.

1000
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:58,375
After giving some
thought to this matter,

1001
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,666
I have decided that…

1002
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,166
the Chief Minister will not be changed.

1003
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:12,125
Tara Roopram shall continue
to be the Chief Minister.

1004
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,708
Because I do not have doubts

1005
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,000
about Tara's intentions and capability.

1006
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,708
Mr. Arvind…

1007
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:29,750
if you are unhappy with my decision,

1008
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,083
you are free to
withdraw your support.

1009
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:38,250
I am okay with dissolving
the government,

1010
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:42,083
but I cannot approve of
changing the Chief Minister.

1011
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,291
My decision is final.

1012
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,250
You are our guide.

1013
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,833
I accept your decision, Masterji.

1014
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,458
I support you…

1015
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:07,500
as well as the Chief Minister
and the government.

1016
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:11,041
-Long live our governance!
-Long live our governance!

1017
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,250
-Long live Tara's governance!
-Long live Tara's governance!

1018
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,333
-Long live our unity!
-Long live our unity!

1019
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,375
-Long live our unity!
-Long live our unity!

1020
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,458
-Long live our unity!
-Long live our unity!

1021
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,583
-Long live our unity!
-Long live our unity!

1022
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:42,041
You should know,
you still have a father.

OFFICIAL CIRCUIT HOUSE, FAIZABAD
(UTTAR PRADESH)

1024
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:20,875
I served Masterji
for many years, Bhaiyaji.

1025
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,375
Everyone associated with him
gained something or the other.

1026
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:29,291
They became MLAs and ministers.

1027
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,791
One even ended up
becoming the Chief Minister.

1028
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,208
I'm the only one
who didn't gain anything.

1029
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:42,708
You are the first person
to think about me, Bhaiyaji.

1030
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:46,500
Do you know why you didn't
gain anything, Sundar?

1031
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,666
Because you don't
understand politics.

1032
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,583
Masterji is no more, Arvind Bhaiya.

1033
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:12,416
The CM is all alone.

1034
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,250
And I will kill her.

1035
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,041
He shall live on forever!

1036
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:37,250
-Masterji shall live on forever!
-He shall live on forever!

1037
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:40,791
-Masterji shall live on forever!
-He shall live on forever!

1038
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:43,125
As long as the sun shines…

1039
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:45,333
Masterji will be remembered!

1040
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,375
As long as the sun shines…

1041
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,375
Masterji will be remembered!

1042
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,500
As long as the sun shines…

1043
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,875
Masterji will be remembered!

1045
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:12,166

1046
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:13,750
<i>I have you by my side.</i>

01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,625
<i>You won't let me make any mistake.</i>

1048
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:22,416
<i>You should know,</i>
<i>you still have a father.</i>

1049
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:31,625
-Masterji shall live on forever!
-He shall live on forever!

1050
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:34,583
-Masterji shall live on forever!
-He shall live on forever!

1051
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:37,708
-Masterji shall live on forever!
-He shall live on forever!

1052
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:40,708
-Masterji shall live on forever!
-He shall live on forever!

1053
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:43,958
-Masterji shall live on forever!
-He shall live on forever!

1054
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:08,666
Sir!

1055
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:10,583
Sir!

1056
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,291
Sir!

1057
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:14,125
Sir!

1058
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:15,666
Sir!

1059
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,041
Sir!

1060
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:19,541
Sir, please come out!

1061
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:20,958
Sir!

1062
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,541
Open the door, sir!

1063
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,291
Sir, there's a problem!

1064
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:29,166
-Sir--
-I'll slap you!

1065
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,291
-Sir--
-What's wrong?

1066
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,166
There's a big problem.

1067
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,750
I've been trying to contact you,
but your phone is switched off.

1068
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,750
What happened?
Did the CBI raid us?

1069
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:37,958
It's something far worse.

1070
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,916
The CM has abducted
all the MLAs of our party.

1071
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:42,916
What do you mean?

1072
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:46,916
Sir, Tara kidnapped
all the MLAs of our party.

1073
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:50,291
-Where did she take them?
-State Guest House.

1074
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,708
She will make them parade

1075
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,041
in front of the Governor
tomorrow in a show of strength.

1076
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,875
She has split your party.

1077
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,833
How dare she!

1078
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,625
I won't spare her.

1079
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,166
Wake the boys up!

1080
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,916
Get all the arms
and ammunition loaded.

1081
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,875
-Listen!
-Yes?

1082
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,416
-Call up Indu.
-Okay, sir.

1083
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,708
Hurry up!

1084
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,125
That wretch!

1085
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,833
She wants to split our party.

1086
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:20,041
PLEASE STOP
LUCKNOW POLICE

1087
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,208
MASTER SURAJBHAN GUEST HOUSE
UTTAR PRADESH GOVERNMENT

1088
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,875
-She is here.
-Mr. Sharma, talk to her.

1089
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,708
This is not right, madam.

1090
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,541
This is hooliganism!

1091
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,875
-That's right!
-This is hooliganism!

1092
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:46,041
I apologize for the way
all of you were brought here.

1093
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:52,333
And I apologize
if you were mistreated by my men.

1094
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:55,916
But I also feel sorry
about the condition you are in.

1095
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:58,708
I have a question to ask.

1096
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:02,250
What did you gain from
Arvind Singh's leadership?

1097
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,875
He only let his family members,
friends and lackeys

1098
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:09,041
become ministers.

1099
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,125
All contracts were granted
only to his friends and family.

1100
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:14,625
They have managed to
double their profits in six months!

1101
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:18,500
Whereas you need
to seek permission

1102
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:23,750
to even install
a hand pump in your sector.

1103
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,083
This is how he treats you!

1104
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,041
It seems difficult, Bhaiya.

1105
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:40,416
The place is tightly secured.

1106
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,375
But the news has been confirmed.

1107
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,583
All the MLAs will stay here tonight,

1108
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:47,750
and leave for the Governor House
at 9:00 a.m.

1109
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:53,000
Danish Khan is the mastermind behind this.

1110
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,083
Who is the SP on duty?

1111
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,500
Alok Yadav.

1112
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,791
-Call him.
-Yes, sir.

1113
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,625
Give him what he wants.

1114
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:05,125
Just ask him to keep
the back gate open for some time.

1115
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,833
Now, hear me out.

1116
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:14,125
If all of you leave Vikas Party
and join my party,

1117
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:17,000
then I shall make
each one of you a minister.

1118
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:31,958
Jai Hind, sir.

1119
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,416
Jai Hind, sir.

1120
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:35,250
Take a break and have some tea.

1121
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,125
Take them along as well.

1122
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:38,083
Okay, sir.

1123
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,458
I'll handle everything here.

1124
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,166
Go on.

1125
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:43,208
Come on, guys.

1126
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:49,791
LUCKNOW TRAFFIC POLICE

1127
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:00,916
Sir.

1128
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:03,875
Please make it quick, sir.

1129
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,125
Everyone will be back in 15 minutes.

1130
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:10,375
In the next one hour, you'll receive
gold weighing as much as you do.

1131
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,208
This way, sir.

1132
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,000
Are the arrangements
in order, Mr. Khan?

1133
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:30,166
Yes, madam.

1134
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,416
We have turned this
Guest House into a fortress.

1135
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:35,291
Not even the Prime Minister
can get in without your permission.

1136
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:38,708
Where are our MLAs?

1137
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,458
They are at Clarks Avadh Hotel,
under police protection.

1138
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:44,875
You don't worry.
Bablu is with them.

1139
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:47,416
They will reach the Governor House
at nine in the morning,

1140
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,416
and sign the affidavit
pledging their support to you.

1141
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:58,791
Stop.
What is this?

1142
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:00,500
It's dinner for madam.

1143
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,458
What--

1144
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:19,916
That's her room, Bhaiyaji.

1145
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,583
That one.

1146
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,583
Keep an eye on the security.

1147
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:40,708
Okay, sir.

1148
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,375
What the hell!

1149
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:52,666
Where did she go?

1150
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,166
Where is that bitch?

1151
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:55,583
Check the bathroom.

1152
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,458
She's not in the bathroom, Bhaiyaji.

1153
01:15:58,583 --> 01:15:59,666
She's not?

1154
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:01,083
Where the hell is she?

1155
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,083
She could be in some other room.

1156
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,250
Check each and every room.

1157
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:09,666
Get all the MLAs out.

1158
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:13,000
Bloody traitors!
They bit the hand that fed them!

1159
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:14,250
Go!

1160
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,375
Check properly!

1161
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:24,875
Check everywhere!

1162
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,541
Find them!

1163
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:29,750
Come on, man!

1164
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,791
Check properly! Go that way!

1165
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,416
Come on.

1166
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:39,833
Scour the rooms!

1167
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:43,625
-Check properly!
-There's no on here, sir.

1168
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:44,625
Go there!

1169
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,541
Where did she go?

1170
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:49,333
<i>Alpha to Delta.</i>

1171
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,666
Where are all the MLAs?

1172
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,208
What happened, Indu?

1173
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,208
How is this possible?

1174
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,916
<i>Alpha to Delta.</i>

1175
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,041
Something is not right.

1176
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,375
Go upstairs and check.

1177
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,541
There is no one upstairs either.

1178
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:06,958
All the rooms are empty.

1179
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:09,666
Where the hell did all the 44 MLAs go?

1180
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:20,041
Sir!

1181
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:21,875
You should leave.

1182
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,083
The commandos are headed this way.

1183
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:26,250
How can I just leave?

1184
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:27,958
Where could they possibly go?

1185
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:30,833
They can't just vanish into thin air.

1186
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:32,125
I can't leave without them.

1187
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,916
-Sir.
-We should leave, Arvind Bhaiya.

1188
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,333
We will get another opportunity.

1189
01:17:35,666 --> 01:17:36,750
Please let's go.

1190
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,416
Where did they go?

1191
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,833
How could they disappear?

1192
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,250
Sir, hurry up or they'll get us!

1193
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:40,708
Let's go!

1194
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:44,625
Please hurry!

1195
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,750
Sir!

1196
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:01,458
Indu!

1197
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:19,041
Mr. Khan!

1198
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:22,708
Run! The police are here!

1199
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:23,833
Sir!

1200
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:34,541
Move!

1201
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,750

-That's Danish, right?

01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:52,041
-My loyalties lie…
-My loyalties lie…

1223
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:55,250
-with the CM.
-with the CM.

1224
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:56,750
This I declare and affirm.

1225
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,625
This I declare and affirm.

1226
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:16,833
<i>For the first time following</i>
<i>formation of her own government,</i>

1227
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,833
<i>after Vikas Party's MLAs joined her,</i>

1228
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:23,041
<i>Chief Minister Tara Roopram</i>
<i>went to her village, Rajakhera.</i>

1229
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:25,500
<i>In a program called</i>
<i>Government At Your Doorstep,</i>

1230
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:29,041
<i>the Chief Minister heard</i>
<i>people's grievances,</i>

1231
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:32,750
<i>and declared that all their problems</i>
<i>will be resolved very soon.</i>

1232
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:36,750
It gives me a sense of peace

1233
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:38,791
to be back here.

1234
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:44,416
Girls who went to school with me
already have a couple of kids.

1235
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:46,458
Imagine…

1236
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:51,083
if I had stayed here, I would also
be nurturing kids like the others.

1237
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:54,000
I would be making dung cakes.

1238
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:58,333
Madam, didn't you ever
think about getting married?

1239
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:07,083
Sorry, madam. I…

1240
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:08,791
I spoke impulsively.

1241
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,666
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm really sorry.

1242
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:19,083
Will you marry me, Mr. Khan?

1243
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,083
Excuse me?

1244
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:30,791
Will… you… marry me?

1245
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:39,750
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1246
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:42,083
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1247
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:44,375
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1248
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:49,416
How do I look?

1249
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,666
Hot!

1250
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,458
Extremely hot?

1251
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:55,500
Extremely hot!

1252
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,250
Today is my birthday.

1253
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:00,000
My party MLAs have…

1254
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:05,583
gifted me this necklace.

1255
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:09,791
Now, the media is
going to make fun of me.

1256
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,166
Why?

1257
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:14,666
The opposition will make
accusations against me.

1258
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,208
Why?

1259
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:21,041
Because they cannot
bear to see a poor man's daughter

1260
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:24,125
dressed like this.

1261
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,541
And to be honest…

1262
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:32,250
I thoroughly enjoy
the fact that they are envious!

1263
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:37,916
Because… I am bold.

1264
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,083
I am sharp like a dagger.

1265
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:45,333
And I am all yours!

1266
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:58,291
I don't believe in hiding anything.

1267
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,583
I like to do things openly…

1268
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:05,791
and unashamedly.

1269
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:09,666
So, today,

1270
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:13,750
on my birthday,

1271
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:18,625
I would like to give you all a gift.

1272
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,458
So, here goes.

1273
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:24,708
Today…

1274
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:27,416
on this very stage…

1275
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:29,708
and at this very moment…

1276
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,541
I'm going to get married.

1277
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:43,541
And the name
of my future husband is…

1278
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:47,291
Danish Rehman Khan.

1279
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,458
Happy birthday to you!

1280
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,458
Happy wedding day to you!

1281
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,916
So, what do you all think?

1282
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,375
Do you approve of him as my husband?

1283
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:42,291
We approve of him!

1284
01:26:44,416 --> 01:26:47,250
You know, Mr. Khan, I have never
been afraid of anything in life.

1285
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:51,250
Everyone knows that.
You are very brave.

1286
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:54,583
Yes, but not as brave as I seem.

1287
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:57,750
I got really scared…

1288
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:01,250
the day you were shot.

1289
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:03,458
Why?

1290
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:10,333
I felt quite lonely…
after Uncle passed away.

1291
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,208
But ever since you came along,

1292
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:21,583
I started feeling a sense of peace.

1293
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:28,000
You deserve all the happiness.

1294
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:53,083
You have been accused of
conspiring to kill the Chief Minister.

1295
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:55,000
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

1296
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,083
Your Honor…

1297
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:58,291
that's not true.

1298
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:01,833
They threatened and bought off our MLAs.

1299
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:03,458
They caused a split in our party.

1300
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:05,166
Our young MLA…

1301
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:09,541
Indramani Tripathi is still missing,
Your Honor.

1302
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:13,666
Moreover, I'm being accused
of hatching this conspiracy.

1303
01:28:14,166 --> 01:28:18,833
Your Honor, my client
has the right to participate

1304
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:22,250
in the assembly session
and perform other duties.

1305
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,916
And I would like to
bring to your attention

1306
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:26,875
that they didn't seek permission

1307
01:28:27,166 --> 01:28:30,458
of the speaker of the
Legislative Assembly before arresting him.

1308
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:33,666
Legally, it is mandatory
for them to do so.

1309
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:38,500
-Legislator.
-Yes, sir.

1310
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:41,416
I'm granting you bail.

1311
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,416
Thank you, Your Honor.

1312
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,541
-Congratulations, sir!
-Come on.

1313
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:46,250
Congratulations, sir!

1314
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:52,791
I will kill you.

1315
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:56,208
It took you four months to bail me out!

1316
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:05,041
-Oh, Dr. Laxmi!
-This way, ma'am.

1317
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:06,750
It's good to see you.

1318
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:08,000
How are you?

1319
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm glad that the CM recognized me.

1320
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,750
How can I not recognize you?

1321
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:13,375
We go way back.

1322
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,250
That's true.

1323
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:16,708
How are you doing?

1324
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,041
Good.

1325
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:20,583
But you don't seem well.

1326
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:23,000
Take a deep breath.

1327
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:27,458
Good.

1328
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:28,750
There's nothing to worry about.

1329
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:30,458
You have a mild fever.

1330
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:32,208
I'll prescribe a few medicines.

1331
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,125
You should rest
for a couple of days.

1332
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,791
Everything will be fine.

1333
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,458
You've prescribed medicines
only for the fever, doctor.

1334
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:45,125
She's complaining of
body ache and nausea as well.

1335
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,750
You should prescribe
something for that as well.

1336
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:51,125
If you don't mind,
what do you specialize in?

1337
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:54,166
I'll have you know
that she is my friend.

1338
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:57,541
Madam, I suggest
that you consult a specialist.

1339
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:58,916
It's nothing serious.

1340
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:01,833
I'll be completely fine after
taking the medicines she has prescribed.

1341
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:03,208
You may get back to work.

1342
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:04,250
Go.

1343
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,041
She's my new secretary.

1344
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,500
-Shashi.
-I see.

1345
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:11,375
I'll take your leave now.

1346
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:12,791
Take care of yourself.

1347
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:15,000
Make sure to have
the medicines on time.

1348
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:17,416
Keep visiting, Dr. Laxmi.

1349
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,583
-Mom!
-Yes?

1350
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,208
What's for breakfast?

1351
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:29,541
I want to have something nice.

1352
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,541
The medicines have left
a bad taste in my mouth.

1353
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:33,041
Join us.

1354
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:37,916
I have made your favorite
<i>aloo sabzi, puri</i> and <i>dahi-jalebi.</i>

1355
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,333
Awesome!

1356
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,541
Sorry, madam.
You cannot have that.

1357
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:45,625
Why not?

1358
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,291
It's the doctor's order.

1359
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:49,000
This is what you will have.

1360
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:51,125
Why are you after my life?

1361
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:52,500
I don't want to eat this crap!

1362
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:54,500
She means well.

1363
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:57,208
You will fall sick again
if you don't stick to the diet.

1364
01:30:58,541 --> 01:30:59,666
Did you take your medicine?

1365
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:02,375
You forgot?

1366
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:04,000
Give it to her.

1367
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:09,833
She has been feeding me
bland boiled food ever since she joined.

1368
01:31:09,916 --> 01:31:11,916
She has also changed
all the servants.

1369
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,541
And she has hired a
good-for-nothing English chef.

1370
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:16,000
Let her do her job.

1371
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:17,750
You are supporting her, Mr. Khan?

1372
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:20,541
The Chief Minister should resign!

1373
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,833
The Chief Minister should resign!

1374
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:27,291
-Down with murderous Tara!
-Down with murderous Tara!

1375
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:28,708
Listen up, friends!

1376
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:33,583
The lady living like a queen
in this grand house…

1377
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:36,875
isn't the Chief Minister…

1378
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:39,916
but a murderer!

1379
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:42,708
You're well aware

1380
01:31:43,625 --> 01:31:46,166
of the guest house incident

1381
01:31:46,458 --> 01:31:50,000
and the disappearance of our
party's young MLA Indramani Tripathi.

1382
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:55,625
This murderous Chief Minister
is responsible for both!

1383
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:59,458
-Down with murderous Tara!
-Down with murderous Tara!

1384
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:03,250
-Down with murderous Tara!
-Down with murderous Tara!

1385
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,791
Dear friends!
With all of you as my witnesses…

1386
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:08,041
MURDEROUS TARA

1387
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:13,208
I hold this holy water
and pledge that…

1388
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:18,791
I shall fast until death right outside
the Chief Minister's residence…

1389
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:23,083
until my request

1390
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,416
for a CBI probe is accepted.

1391
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,750
-We want…
-CBI probe!

1392
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:32,666
-We want…
-CBI probe!

1393
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:51,666
Thank you so much for meeting us.

1394
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:54,333
You are a clever man.

1395
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:57,291
I'm sure you know
what this is all about.

1396
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:01,291
Cut to the chase, Mr. Kushwaha.

1397
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:03,458
We met the President in Delhi.

1398
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,625
The orders for a CBI probe
will be issued in a couple of days.

1399
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:13,125
You know what caused a split in our
party and what happened to Indu.

1400
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:19,541
As per rules, they should
interrogate you as well, Mr. Khan.

1401
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,875
So, make it happen.

1402
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:24,541
-Who is stopping you?
-Hold on.

1403
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:27,458
We are not here to argue.

1404
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:29,916
We have a proposal for you.

1405
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:33,833
The Chief Minister is certain
to end up in prison after the CBI probe.

1406
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:42,000
If you push all the other MLAs
towards us after she gets arrested…

1407
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:45,416
then we guarantee you
a seat in the Council of States.

1408
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,250
You are a well-educated,
intellectual man.

1409
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:51,000
You should be handling
national politics.

1410
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:53,500
This is what we are proposing.

1411
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,125
What's wrong, Mr. Khan?

1412
01:33:58,208 --> 01:34:00,333
You have an opportunity
to be in the Council of States.

1413
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:01,625
What's there to think about?

1414
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:05,000
I'm thinking whether I should
take of my shoe and hit you in the head,

1415
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:06,958
or disrobe you and turn your derriere red.

1416
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:08,083
Show some respect.

1417
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,708
You don't deserve respect!

1418
01:34:09,791 --> 01:34:12,916
The Chief Minister is my wife.

1419
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:18,166
And as long as I live,

1420
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:21,500
I won't let anybody
harm a hair on her head.

1421
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:36,583
You should have
called me over, madam.

1422
01:34:36,666 --> 01:34:38,416
Why did you take
the trouble to come here?

1423
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,875
I was passing by. So, I thought
of stopping for a quick checkup.

1424
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:44,208
What is wrong with me, Laxmi?

1425
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:46,708
I have never been
this unwell before.

1426
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:48,916
There's something happening every week.

1427
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:51,208
Don't worry.
We will run a couple of tests.

1428
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:52,791
Madam, your phone.

1429
01:34:52,875 --> 01:34:54,208
Excuse me.

1430
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,750
Yes, Mr. Khan?

1431
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:04,458
Mr. Khan,
the CBI has summoned her.

1432
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:06,375
She will have to go to court.

1433
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:09,125
-What are the chances?
-Hundred percent.

1434
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:12,041
CBI will seek custody.

1435
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,416
Looking at the
sensitivity of the issue,

1436
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,458
court will issue arrest orders.

1437
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:19,833
The CBI Judge Supriya Tiwari
is really strict.

1438
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:22,583
How many days will I
have to spend in prison, sir?

1439
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:25,791
You're not going to prison.

1440
01:35:25,958 --> 01:35:27,166
We won't go to court.

1441
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:28,583
-End of story.
-For how long?

1442
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:32,583
If I keep delaying, people will
think that I am hiding something.

1443
01:35:33,166 --> 01:35:34,458
For how many days
will I have to go to prison?

1444
01:35:34,541 --> 01:35:37,166
About four to six months, madam.
But you'll be granted bail after that.

1445
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,458
Can't we seek an anticipatory bail?

1446
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:40,625
We can even approach the Supreme Court.

1447
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:42,166
-No.
-Yes, but…

1448
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,375
There's no need.

1449
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:45,041
You should leave.

1450
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,375
Okay, madam.

1451
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:55,125
I will go to jail, Mr. Khan.

1452
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:59,750
People will sympathize
with me if I go to jail.

1453
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:01,625
It will help during the election.

1454
01:36:01,916 --> 01:36:06,000
If you go to jail,
who will run the government?

1455
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:08,458
You will.

1456
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,083
Me?

1457
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:13,083
Look, please don't
get me into this mess.

1458
01:36:13,375 --> 01:36:15,125
We have many senior leaders.

1459
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,541
You can make one of them do it.

1460
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:20,333
I have already taken away
your government job by marrying you.

1461
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:22,625
Now, I need to give you
something in return.

1462
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:27,000
You will handle everything
until I come back.

1463
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:30,333
The party, this house
and the government.

1464
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,916
I can handle the household, but…

1465
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,750
Do you remember who was made
the CM when Mr. Lalu went to jail?

1466
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,541
Do you plan to change
my name as well?

1467
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,666
Madam.

1468
01:36:56,333 --> 01:37:00,041
You have been accused of
buying off the MLAs of Vikas Party,

1469
01:37:00,125 --> 01:37:05,250
and filing false charges against
the party's president, Arvind Singh.

1470
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:08,750
And the CBI also suspects
that you have a hand

1471
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:14,125
in the disappearance
of MLA Indramani Tripathi.

1472
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:16,416
Would you like to say
something in your defense?

1473
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:19,750
I have not said anything
in my defense to this day.

1474
01:37:19,916 --> 01:37:21,000
So, why would I do that do?

1475
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:24,333
I'm sure my lawyers know their job.

1476
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,833
You may have a seat.

1477
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,541
UTTAR PRADESH GOVERNMENT

1478
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:47,333
Your Honor, there have been
numerous occasions wherein

1479
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:49,166
the High Court and the Supreme Court

1480
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:51,958
have issued orders
to arrest sitting CMs.

1481
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:55,250
All the referred cases
have been mentioned in the file.

1482
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,000
Sir?

1483
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:04,791
Yes?

1484
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,833
Come in.

1485
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:15,750
Sir, I'm here with my CV for
the post of the new CM's OSD.

1486
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:17,291
Let me take a look.

1487
01:38:21,708 --> 01:38:25,041
Let me see
what your qualifications are.

1488
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:37,708
How can I possibly give you

1489
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:40,583
the CM's custody on the basis
of an initial investigation?

1490
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:41,958
But, Your Honor…

1491
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:44,416
She is the Chief Minister of our state.

1492
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:46,875
She isn't going to run away.

1493
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,416
Mr. Khan?

1494
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:53,833
You sick bastard!

1495
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:55,250
-Bablu.
-Danish.

1496
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:56,750
-Listen, Bablu…
-Stay right there.

1497
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:57,791
-Listen to me.
-Stay there!

1498
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:59,333
-Listen…
-I said stay right there!

1499
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:01,208
I knew you were treacherous.

1500
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:04,250
-Wait and see how I expose you.
-Listen to me, Bablu!

1501
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:05,250
Shut up!

1502
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:08,208
You may continue
with your investigation.

1503
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:12,958
You will get her custody
once you have evidence against her.

1504
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:16,375
As of now,
I'm declining your appeal.

1505
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:18,000
Madam, please hear me out.

1506
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:20,541
Counsel, please settle down.

1507
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:25,166
Damn it!
She isn't answering her phone!

1508
01:39:25,541 --> 01:39:26,666
That bloody traitor!

1509
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:28,541
Stop the car!

1510
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,000
Come here.

1511
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:33,166
Don't you know whose car it is?

1512
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:35,250
Can't you see whose car it is?

1513
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:37,458
I'll behead you right here!

1514
01:39:37,541 --> 01:39:38,708
Buzz off!

1515
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:04,125
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1516
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:05,666
<i>In a dramatic turn of events,</i>

1517
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,333
<i>the court declined</i>
<i>CBI's appeal to grant them</i>

1518
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:10,500
<i>the custody of</i>
<i>Chief Minister Tara Roopram.</i>

1519
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,916
<i>All the legal experts had claimed that</i>

1520
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:16,583
<i>the Chief Minister would</i>
<i>certainly to go to jail.</i>

1521
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:20,250
<i>The decision of the court</i>
<i>has caused a stir in the state.</i>

1522
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,250
<i>And given the circumstances,</i>
<i>it is uncertain</i>

1523
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:25,875
<i>if the Chief Minister's husband</i>
<i>will be taking the oath tomorrow.</i>

1524
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:30,458
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1525
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:32,166
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1526
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,833
-Long live…
-Tara Didi!

1527
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:35,416
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1528
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,416
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara!
-You have our support!

1529
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:41,541
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara!
-You have our support!

1530
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:44,833
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara!
-You have our support!

1531
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,625
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1532
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:48,166
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1533
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,083
-Long live…
-Tara Madam!

1534
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:55,291
Poison me?

1535
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:58,208
Have you lost your mind, Laxmi?

1536
01:40:58,291 --> 01:40:59,750
I was just as surprised as you are.

1537
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:03,750
That's why I had sent all
your samples to AIIMS, New Delhi.

1538
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:06,250
Their investigation also conclude that

1539
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:09,666
something is being mixed
in your meals which is making you…

1540
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:13,041
How come I didn't die
if I was poisoned?

1541
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:15,750
Its outcome is not sudden death.

1542
01:41:15,916 --> 01:41:17,750
It's a slow process
which leads to gradual death.

1543
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:21,083
You could have had a heart attack
or a paralysis attack.

1544
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,083
But I have been
only eating homemade food.

1545
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,500
And you know that I live
with my mom, Bablu and…

1546
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:31,000
what's her name? Shashi!

1547
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:33,500
Mr. Khan is the one
who appointed Shashi.

1548
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:36,250
I eat whatever she asks me to.

1549
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:38,958
So, Mr. Khan…

1550
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:43,291
<i>There has been</i>
<i>another development.</i>

1551
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:45,666
<i>We have unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>of the CM's brother Bablu Roopram</i>

1552
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:48,333
<i>dying in a police encounter.</i>

1553
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:51,041
<i>Our sources suggest that</i>
<i>he shot at the police officers</i>

1554
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:52,166
<i>under the influence of alcohol,</i>

1555
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,250
<i>and was killed during the crossfire.</i>

1556
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:58,000
<i>No statement has been</i>
<i>released by the CMO so far.</i>

1557
01:41:58,083 --> 01:41:59,125
Mr. Khan.

1558
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:01,250
There was a call from
the Governor's office.

1559
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:04,708
Your swearing-in ceremony
has been called off.

1560
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,500
This is your personal matter, madam.

1561
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,416
I may be speaking out of turn…

1562
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:18,375
but I suggest
that you don't trust anyone.

1563
01:42:19,083 --> 01:42:20,125
And…

1564
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:22,083
Mr. Khan…

1565
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:25,541
Well, everyone in Lucknow
has heard rumors about him.

1566
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:27,208
He is my husband.

1567
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,083
I love him.

1568
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:31,333
He took a bullet for me.

1569
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:46,250
<i>Sorry, madam.</i>
<i>You cannot have that.</i>

1570
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:47,958
<i>I don't want to eat this crap!</i>

1571
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:49,666
She means well.

1572
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:52,625
You will fall sick again
if you don't stick to the diet.

1573
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:15,250
This is the room

1574
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:20,125
wherein my grandma
poisoned three newborn girls

1575
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:23,083
my mother had given birth to.

1576
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:27,041
But she wasn't able to kill me.

1577
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:30,708
That old hag got bedridden
and died in this very room.

1578
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:33,458
I don't know why,

1579
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,375
but my mother always stopped
me from entering this room.

1580
01:43:36,666 --> 01:43:38,583
She would say that
death resides here.

1581
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:41,541
Strange coincidence, right?

1582
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:45,625
All the people who died in this room

1583
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,250
were women.

1584
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:49,250
And look…

1585
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:52,333
you are destined to die here as well.

1586
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,666
Madam…

1587
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,458
I'm not at fault.

1588
01:43:56,708 --> 01:43:58,166
I haven't done anything wrong.

1589
01:43:58,708 --> 01:44:00,583
There's some misunderstanding, madam.

1590
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:03,750
I already have poison running
through my veins, thanks to you.

1591
01:44:04,541 --> 01:44:06,250
Now, before I sting you,

1592
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,000
blurt out the truth.

1593
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:11,000
I might spare your life.

1594
01:44:35,083 --> 01:44:36,500
Madam.

1595
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:39,250
I…

1596
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:44,166
My real name is Shazia Ahmed.

1597
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,833
I was engaged to Danish.

1598
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:57,125
But one day, out of the blue,
he got married to you.

1599
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:01,666
I was really hurt.

1600
01:45:03,583 --> 01:45:05,208
I was in love with Danish, madam.

1601
01:45:08,458 --> 01:45:09,708
However…

1602
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:13,583
I thought I couldn't fight destiny.
So, I decided to move on.

1603
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:18,458
But one day, he came
to meet me in New Delhi.

1604
01:45:19,708 --> 01:45:20,833
Listen to me.

1605
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:22,750
I was trapped.

1606
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:24,166
She is the Chief Minister.

1607
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:26,833
What could I have done when
she proposed in front of everyone?

1608
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:28,750
I… I'm trying.

1609
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:32,125
I was very angry with you.

1610
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,875
Then he asked me to come to Lucknow.

1611
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,708
I didn't know about his plan, madam.

1612
01:45:43,291 --> 01:45:44,166
He…

1613
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:48,500
he kept asking me to do things
and I followed his orders.

1614
01:45:54,208 --> 01:45:56,625
Write down the name of the
poison that you were giving me.

1615
01:45:59,208 --> 01:46:00,291
Write it down.

1616
01:46:01,375 --> 01:46:02,416
Do it!

1617
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:11,166
Who poisoned me first?

1618
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:13,541
Was it you…

1619
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:16,541
or Danish?

1620
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:20,375
Danish.

1621
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:25,250
Madam…

1622
01:46:25,916 --> 01:46:27,416
please forgive me.

1623
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:29,041
I didn't do anything.

1624
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:31,750
Whatever I did was to get him back.

1625
01:46:31,833 --> 01:46:33,583
I didn't have any
vested interest, madam.

1626
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:35,000
Please forgive me.

1627
01:46:57,625 --> 01:47:01,875
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara!
-You have our support!

1628
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,083
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara!
-You have our support!

1629
01:47:07,166 --> 01:47:12,000
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara!
-You have our support!

1630
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:27,208
Mr. Khan?

1631
01:48:32,083 --> 01:48:33,666
When did you come back?

1632
01:48:35,291 --> 01:48:37,208
I was worried.

1633
01:48:38,291 --> 01:48:39,625
You didn't take my calls.

1634
01:48:40,125 --> 01:48:41,291
Where were you?

1635
01:48:41,416 --> 01:48:43,041
Shazia is dead, Mr. Khan.

1636
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,583
I loved you.

1637
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:12,125
I trusted you.

1638
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:18,166
Why did you…

1639
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:20,625
do this?

1640
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:27,458
For the same reason…

1641
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,416
you got…

1642
01:49:32,916 --> 01:49:35,083
Arvind Singh's MLAs abducted,

1643
01:49:38,375 --> 01:49:39,916
filed false charges against him,

1644
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:44,250
and got Indramani Tripathi killed.

1645
01:49:47,166 --> 01:49:48,375
Power.

1646
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:54,791
Masterji always wanted
to keep his people…

1647
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,958
away from the arrogance of power.

1648
01:50:01,583 --> 01:50:03,166
But he forgot…

1649
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:06,083
that it's impossible to do so

1650
01:50:07,708 --> 01:50:10,333
while you're in power.

1651
01:50:17,416 --> 01:50:20,166
Neither could you escape it nor me.

1652
01:50:21,625 --> 01:50:25,875
The only difference is that
you managed to win this game.

1653
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:28,583
I wasn't fortunate.

1654
01:50:29,625 --> 01:50:30,875
I have been caught.

1655
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:42,958
I know you won't spare me.

1656
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:49,625
So, go ahead.

1657
01:50:50,708 --> 01:50:51,875
Shoot me.

1658
01:51:00,958 --> 01:51:02,416
You are my husband.

1659
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:07,375
Witch, whore, mistress…

1660
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:12,958
I have been called many such names.

1661
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:19,583
I don't want to add another
curse word to the list by killing you.

1662
01:52:11,333 --> 01:52:14,833
YET ANOTHER WIN
FOR TARA'S GOVERNMENT

1663
01:52:34,458 --> 01:52:36,041
Today…

1664
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:41,083
I won't ask you…

1665
01:52:41,583 --> 01:52:43,916
how I look.

1666
01:52:46,833 --> 01:52:49,041
Because today…

1667
01:52:50,375 --> 01:52:52,833
the woman standing before you…

1668
01:52:55,041 --> 01:52:57,416
is helpless,

1669
01:52:58,208 --> 01:53:00,333
forlorn,

1670
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:04,583
and defeated!

1671
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:09,416
And this woman wants to know

1672
01:53:10,625 --> 01:53:14,666
what she got in return

1673
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:18,916
for serving all of you?

1674
01:53:22,666 --> 01:53:25,208
What was my fault?

1675
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:29,041
Why did I get such a big punishment?

1676
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:36,208
What wrong did I do?

1677
01:53:36,708 --> 01:53:39,916
Why was everything
taken away from me?

1678
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,416
Tell me!

1679
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:47,541
Masterji, a man who was
like a father to me, was murdered.

1680
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:51,500
A CBI probe was
initiated against me.

1681
01:53:52,416 --> 01:53:57,666
My only brother was shot dead.

1682
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:02,166
And the man…

1683
01:54:03,458 --> 01:54:06,375
whom I had accepted…

1684
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:10,333
as my husband
in front of everyone…

1685
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:13,833
Look at him.

1686
01:54:15,541 --> 01:54:17,458
Take a look at…

1687
01:54:18,416 --> 01:54:24,000
what my enemies have done to him.

1688
01:54:53,458 --> 01:54:57,458
This is my beloved husband.

1689
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:01,208
He is the man you approved of!

1690
01:55:02,833 --> 01:55:05,333
He is the man who…

1691
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:09,333
got married to me
on this very stage.

1692
01:55:11,791 --> 01:55:13,916
Do you remember?

1693
01:55:15,833 --> 01:55:17,666
TARA

1694
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:27,583
But I am stubborn!

1695
01:55:29,041 --> 01:55:31,750
I have always been a tough nut.

1696
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,416
I will overcome the hurdles!

1697
01:55:37,625 --> 01:55:41,291
I will make sacrifices if I have to!

1698
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:46,833
But I promise you that

1699
01:55:47,166 --> 01:55:50,375
nothing in the universe

1700
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:54,583
can stop me from serving you!

1701
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:07,625
I am married!

1702
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:11,291
I am unfortunate!

1703
01:56:12,875 --> 01:56:16,958
But the fact is that…

1704
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:20,500
I am still yours.

1705
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:48,583
-She is a raging storm!
-She's here to transform.

1706
01:56:48,666 --> 01:56:52,208
-She is a raging storm!
-She's here to transform.

1707
01:56:52,291 --> 01:56:55,833
-She is a raging storm!
-She's here to transform!

1708
01:56:55,916 --> 01:56:59,291
-All hail…
-Tara's governance!

1709
01:56:59,375 --> 01:57:02,416
-All hail…
-Tara's governance!

1710
01:57:02,541 --> 01:57:06,416
-She is a raging storm!
-She's here to transform.

1711
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:09,958
-All hail…
-Tara's governance!
