1
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,007
''Strange events you foresee through me,
my beloved...''

2
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:10,940
So be it!

3
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:18,621
He says...all will be red...
bathed in red!

4
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:19,950
So be it!

5
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:27,297
l'm being forced into
a river of blood!

6
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:34,302
He says...it is the blood of the
out-caste foreigners!

7
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:38,974
Now they will be wiped out...
all those foreigners!

8
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:47,317
Fate decreed they rule us a hundred
years. It will end now!

9
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:56,058
They will flee...like pigeons!

10
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:59,129
''Like pigeons, they will fly away!''

11
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:01,665
They will leave...a flight of pigeons!

12
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,999
Has SarFraz come here?

13
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,345
We have decided to close
our eyes to it

14
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:17,347
''What happened in Meerut and elsewhere,
that isn't important?''

15
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:21,353
''Bahadur Shah made Emperor, that isn't
important?''

16
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:23,689
He is only a figure-head

17
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:27,194
''The rebel soldiers will stay in power
for a while, that's all''

18
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:33,035
To win them over to their side is easy
for the English

19
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:37,105
''Compared to what the Nawabs are doing,
the English seem a better lot''

20
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:44,044
The Nawabs are putting up a pretense
since they're scared...

21
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,315
The English have snatched away their
riches and comforts

22
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:52,390
''Now the Nawabs are like caged cats,
clawing at different doors''

23
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:09,078
Allah knows what's come over him now.
He shows no interest in me or the house

24
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:13,345
May God put a scourge on those pigeons.
They are all he cares about

25
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:17,349
The whole county is aflame and all he
does is fuss over pigeons

26
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:20,084
And all you do is keep whining

27
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:44,377
''Our greetings, aunt''

28
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:47,181
Thank God you are safe
- Thanks to your prayers

29
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,385
''May you live long, l thought you'd
return after wiping out the foreigners''

30
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,721
That's not easy

31
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,189
Why are you after their lives?

32
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:55,723
His head is full of this nonsense

33
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,729
Mary and set up a home and this
nonsense will recede

34
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:03,000
O Allah! Here l am tying to rid us
of our bondage

35
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:04,799
And you want to chain me for life

36
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,134
You never have the last word with him

37
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:15,346
We Indians have put up with a lot
from these foreigners

38
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:20,186
They squeezed us dry
and we accepted it

39
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:24,691
''But insulting our honour, respect and
trust another matter''

40
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:27,359
lt drove Mangal Pandey to
turn his gun on them

41
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:29,694
But he did not fire?

42
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:34,034
Because he was trained to be a loyal
Company soldier

43
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:36,837
He couldn't pull the trigger when it
came to it

44
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,238
''Even then, he was hanged''

45
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:41,708
And his entire regiment disbanded

46
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,042
And in Meerut?

47
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:44,377
The same happened

48
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:49,718
lt became a crime to refuse bullets
made of pig or cow's fat

49
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:56,194
Eighty-five loyal soldiers were publicly
disgraced and humiliated

50
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:03,337
These staunch men cried in shame
like babies

51
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:05,901
Yet these foreigners showed no mercy

52
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:10,007
Ungrateful curs! Selfish scoundrels!

53
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:15,016
Enough. You go on too much

54
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,218
No one here will do anything about it

55
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,022
Why do you choose to be crusading
rebel?

56
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,357
''SarFraz, we are with you''

57
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:30,096
''But about Javed, l'm not sure''

58
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:37,105
''When the fires burn, all hands will
appear to warm themselves...''

59
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,714
''What's that, they will burn down the
homes of the English?''

60
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:49,116
The name of that scoundrel?

61
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:54,224
SarFraz Khan of the
34th Bengal Infanty

62
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,123
Mangal Pandey's regiment

63
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,728
There are rumours of riots tomorrow

64
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:02,664
And of looting the Treasuy
- You be quiet

65
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,336
Nobody will go to Church tomorrow

66
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:29,696
What about Meerut? What about Delhi?
Now it will happen here

67
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,041
''Miriam, have you told him about that
amul Pathan who keeps staring at Ruth?''

68
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,189
''Miriam, tomorrow is oufld' festival''

69
00:15:54,386 --> 00:16:00,332
Please instruct the cook to prepare
our special delicacies

70
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:05,669
''Even if the world topples, Ruth is
not going to the Church tomorrow''

71
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,340
There's no need to invite danger!

72
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:43,380
What was the need to go to Church?
But he has always been obstinate!

73
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:14,075
Miriam Sahiba and your grandmother
are safe

74
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:17,079
Come with me. It is dangerous for
you here!

75
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:11,740
Where's your father?

76
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,759
l will go to the Church to find out
You are quite safe here

77
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:35,432
Don't venture out

78
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,216
''lt's me, Ramjimal''

79
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:41,506
We must leave here at once

80
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:43,506
lf these soldiers see us...

81
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,342
My house would be safer

82
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:14,807
Mother!

83
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:24,154
''Ramji, at this hour? And making such
a noise over it!''

84
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,233
''lt's me, open the door quickly''

85
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,244
Please speak softly. Come in quickly

86
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,248
Why are these foreigners here?

87
00:32:50,513 --> 00:32:52,516
''lf the soldiers know, they'd kill us all''

88
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:56,256
''Allow us in first, and please arrange
for some food''

89
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:03,331
''Ram, Ram! We'll all be killed along
with them''

90
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:10,804
''They are our guests. Don't you realise,
their lives are in danger?''

91
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,138
We must help them

92
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:14,408
''And with them, we are equally in danger''

93
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:16,810
''This deed will add to our blessings,
mother''

94
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:24,819
''Listen, the maid-servant will not come
to work tomorrow''

95
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:28,490
No one should know that they are here
with us

96
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:31,827
Please consider this simple place
your home

97
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:35,832
''lf they live here, who will wash their
impure plates?''

98
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:42,241
Don't wory. We will do our own work
ourselves

99
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,846
Our backs are breaking with work.
Now we have their load as well

100
00:33:46,976 --> 00:33:49,512
Show some consideration and mind
how you speak

101
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:54,519
Don't call them foreigners.
They are our friends

102
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,122
You know they are Labadoor Sahib's
family?

103
00:33:57,387 --> 00:33:59,189
Remember how they helped us?

104
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:03,799
''Don't be upset by this, please
Come upstairs''

105
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,518
What happened?
- She has fever

106
00:36:52,247 --> 00:36:54,519
''My salutations, please be seated''

107
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,993
What can we offer you?

108
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:04,462
Please don't go to any trouble

109
00:37:05,796 --> 00:37:07,798
Give her something to eat

110
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:13,140
''lf you don't eat,
your health will get worse''

111
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:23,823
''Dear, have some food.
Why don't you give her some food?''

112
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,989
Do you want to kill her?

113
00:37:31,558 --> 00:37:33,828
How is life with you these days?

114
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:39,838
''Completely at ease! At peace, now
that the foreigners have left''

115
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:42,506
We owe it all to SarFraz Khan

116
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:46,243
Allah! What is one to say of him
- But all this looting?

117
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:48,245
That is bound to happen

118
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:50,179
Did any foreigners escape?

119
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:56,258
Just the Labadoor family

120
00:37:57,253 --> 00:38:00,793
But Javed is scouring all over for
the with his sword

121
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,129
But why are you taking this trouble?

122
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:13,806
Where's the maidservant?

123
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:17,210
The riots are good excuse to avoid
work

124
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:26,488
Have you any idea where
they could be?

125
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:29,156
The foreigners

126
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:31,425
Which ones?
- The same...The Labadoor family

127
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,230
Wherever their misfortune leads them

128
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:40,502
But look at your bad luck

129
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:45,177
''You lost so much by giving loans,
to the English''

130
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,013
lt didn't effect me. l wrote it off

131
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:53,851
Tell me about the survivors
at the church

132
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:59,859
They felt they would escape

133
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:12,814
The Collector and his friends made for
the lake...

134
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:18,815
but SarFraz's men surrounded them
and cut them to pieces

135
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:44,843
''No, l won't allow it, never!''

136
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:52,183
''Mother,enough. Please sleep now''

137
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,853
Drive them out or we'll pay with
our lives

138
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:01,260
''lf anyone comes to know, they'll snuff
us out in seconds''

139
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,863
Many have endangered their lives to
honour a promise

140
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,202
Why pay penance in our next life?
- Don't talk of your mother!

141
00:40:09,398 --> 00:40:14,276
Don't talk of your promises either.
We will die along with them

142
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,281
''With none to light a lamp or serve
water, our generation will end''

143
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:25,188
''Save our family, son. To preserve
our lineage in greater than our rebirth''

144
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,192
''Give, l'll wash your clothes''

145
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:43,104
''No, l'll do it
- l have all these to do...''

146
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:45,240
so l can do yours also

147
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:56,586
A woman without a husband
is alone in this world

148
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:58,920
''Like a false coin,
she has no status''

149
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,304
''God's Universe, King's county''

150
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:14,540
By the order of the Bahadur Khan

151
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:27,296
''Hear this! From now on, Company's rule
has ended in this territoy''

152
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:40,241
''Once again, it is under the rule of his
Majesty, King Bahadur Shah of Delhi''

153
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:53,055
And you are warned that those who
shelter foreigners...

154
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:55,652
will be punished to
the severest extent

155
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,953
lt is better for me to speak plainly

156
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:31,392
You are hiding the Labadoor family

157
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:34,896
Kader Khan has told me so

158
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:37,298
You have been misinformed

159
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:42,908
The point is whether you believe
what l say

160
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:48,577
''lf you don't, cut off my head''

161
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,080
And then enter the house

162
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:11,269
Who was that Pathan?

163
00:44:26,084 --> 00:44:28,556
Don't be frightened.
He doesn't know anything

164
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:30,889
He just came to check

165
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:38,034
''Can't l go to either of my brothers,
in Agra or Ajmer?''

166
00:44:40,633 --> 00:44:43,306
Or else Rampur?
Mother comes from there

167
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,110
''Miriam Sahiba, it is true that Rampur
Nawab is helping foreigners for now''

168
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:50,178
But you must trust me

169
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:57,257
No one can harm you while l'm alive

170
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,731
l hear that some soldiers from
outside have come to this town?

171
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,401
There will be riots again

172
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,937
They are from Sitapur

173
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:47,076
They are on their way to Delhi
to fight for the Emperor

174
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:49,644
and are here for the night

175
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:53,415
''There's nothing to wory about,
Miriam Sahiba''

176
00:47:06,928 --> 00:47:08,131
Where were you?

177
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,101
To give food to the beggar woman

178
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:14,372
Look! She's announcing her presence
to the whole world

179
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:19,781
''l'm warning you, if not now...
tomorrow we'll all be killed''

180
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:23,715
''That was not right, Miriam Sahiba''

181
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:27,386
Please don't repeat such a mistake

182
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:24,115
So what if he crept in like a thief?

183
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:25,915
He was a soldier after all

184
00:51:26,048 --> 00:51:28,454
lt's bound to create trouble

185
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:35,463
''Think of your son, if not us''

186
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:39,800
Do you think their lives
are safe here?

187
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:00,755
Now can we get to Rampur?

188
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:03,425
Please sell these

189
00:52:07,062 --> 00:52:08,431
l feel ashamed doing this

190
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:11,834
l am so indebted to Labadoor Sahib

191
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,438
The jewels can be had again

192
00:52:15,437 --> 00:52:16,841
Your having to do this...

193
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:22,113
''l'm, sory that my own business
has collapsed''

194
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:31,961
Rampur is the safest place for you

195
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:35,795
We will ty to get there

196
00:52:58,484 --> 00:52:59,821
l need some money...

197
00:53:07,094 --> 00:53:10,435
l cannot risk my life for foreigners

198
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:32,457
Please write a letter for me

199
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:35,595
To whom?
- To him!

200
00:53:39,464 --> 00:53:41,801
Wonder what kind of a hussy he has
kept at home

201
00:53:42,467 --> 00:53:44,136
l fast evey week to honour his love
for me

202
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:46,472
And he spends his time loving someone
else

203
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:49,877
Write in English. He can read it

204
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:56,153
Laugh as much as you like.
You are protected by Sitaji

205
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:03,091
''You are writing in English,
aren't you?''

206
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:06,430
The demon Ravan abducted Sita to Lanka

207
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,835
He imprisoned her in the
Ashoka grove

208
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,774
All the demons there took care of her

209
00:54:16,437 --> 00:54:18,942
They didn't allow her to suffer
the slightest discomfort

210
00:54:19,574 --> 00:54:21,446
''Write in stern letter, in clear English''

211
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:26,451
Sita was happy and gave her promise...

212
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:29,855
that the demons would be reborn as
foreigners

213
00:54:29,985 --> 00:54:32,792
And they would rule India

214
00:54:33,123 --> 00:54:38,869
''Since then, you have ruled us!
Write in English.''

215
00:54:41,132 --> 00:54:42,468
Open the door!

216
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:48,139
Open the door!

217
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,767
Who's there? Ramji has gone out

218
00:55:11,832 --> 00:55:15,574
The Nawab has ordered a search of
this house

219
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:26,918
Tell the women to wear their veils

220
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:10,099
Don't you dare touch her

221
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:14,771
Out with all of you.
Come on.

222
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:19,846
''Miriam, these people cannot
be trusted. Let's go.''

223
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:52,648
No one can harm the chosen ones.
Those whom God wants to protect

224
00:56:53,879 --> 00:56:55,148
Remember this...

225
00:56:56,883 --> 00:57:01,424
Your beloved's life is in His hands

226
00:58:05,425 --> 00:58:07,095
Have you fed the pigeons?

227
00:58:09,763 --> 00:58:12,435
Can l dare forget my rivals?

228
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:14,436
Where did you lift these creatures?

229
00:58:15,836 --> 00:58:19,444
This is Mr. Labadoor's wife...
- You killed that poor man

230
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:21,577
now you want her as your mistress?

231
00:58:22,778 --> 00:58:24,113
They will live here

232
00:58:24,779 --> 00:58:26,449
Arrange for their stay upstairs

233
00:58:26,649 --> 00:58:30,122
Certainly not. My home must not
become a laughing stock

234
00:58:52,644 --> 00:58:55,882
''Begum, don't be angy with us''

235
00:58:56,547 --> 00:58:58,752
We didn't choose to come here

236
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:02,090
Allah! They speak our language

237
00:59:04,757 --> 00:59:07,094
My mother comes from the Nawab of
Rampur's family

238
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:08,964
Which Rampur family?

239
00:59:09,096 --> 00:59:10,666
Rampur of the Rohillas

240
00:59:13,866 --> 00:59:17,775
My mother married an Englishman

241
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:23,445
Please be seated

242
00:59:28,683 --> 00:59:33,794
You have no right to take my guests
away in my absence

243
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:46,144
You would've had to kill me first
and enter over my dead body

244
00:59:50,475 --> 00:59:52,879
That's why we went in your absence

245
00:59:55,147 --> 00:59:57,820
''Never mind, what can l do for you?''

246
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:04,493
l want to speak to them alone

247
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:10,998
Tell them within to wear their veils

248
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:13,503
Ramjilal is here to meet
the foreigners

249
01:00:23,512 --> 01:00:27,853
Please tell the Nawab that the
foreigners are with me

250
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,202
Whatever happens is God's will

251
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:52,546
There is nothing to wory about here

252
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:56,215
Khan Sahib is vey good host

253
01:00:58,884 --> 01:01:00,487
Here are yourjewels

254
01:01:03,488 --> 01:01:06,828
What will they do?
- God only knows

255
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:10,998
l am going away to Bareilly

256
01:01:12,498 --> 01:01:14,836
l'll ty to inform your brothers
there about your condition

257
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:24,916
Please give my greetings
to your mother

258
01:01:26,515 --> 01:01:27,917
My good wishes to your daughter

259
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,666
Don't weaken...have courage

260
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,940
May God bless you all

261
01:03:16,937 --> 01:03:21,178
These foreigners are a shameless lot.
- What happened?

262
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,681
That woman actually held
Ramji's hand

263
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:26,915
They don't have any decency

264
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:29,118
Don't fill my ears with your rubbish

265
01:06:55,946 --> 01:06:57,949
God grant you a child
beautiful as a moon

266
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,487
My son is vey annoyed with me

267
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:05,627
He feels we have come here only
to see them

268
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:07,995
Our newly-wed is sulking

269
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:10,497
Hafiz had to come all the way here

270
01:07:11,929 --> 01:07:14,503
Unless you crack jokes you cannot
enjoy your food

271
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,037
You realise the plight of
these people?

272
01:07:17,236 --> 01:07:18,505
Where are they? Call them

273
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:21,643
Send the foreigners out

274
01:07:22,842 --> 01:07:25,014
What do they look like?
- See for yourself

275
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:29,186
Our Hafiz thinks peculiarly

276
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:32,522
He cannot wait to pounce
on the English

277
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:34,757
But it's different when it comes to
their women

278
01:07:34,855 --> 01:07:37,929
We are fighting their men and not
their families or women

279
01:07:38,194 --> 01:07:43,036
''ln times of war, it's always the
women who suffer''

280
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,204
The war has just begun...

281
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:56,950
''And look at them, the poor things''

282
01:08:10,495 --> 01:08:11,899
Take heart

283
01:08:12,498 --> 01:08:15,503
Only you are there to look after
your mother and daughter

284
01:08:16,836 --> 01:08:18,638
Who has ever opposed destiny?

285
01:08:19,806 --> 01:08:25,919
''Be happy my daughter. For Allah's
sake, make Javed understand''

286
01:08:26,914 --> 01:08:28,517
''By taking our lives,
what will he gain?''

287
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:37,195
l wory about her.
But we are concerned about her

288
01:08:38,526 --> 01:08:41,734
l wish she could return to her own
people

289
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:44,536
''lf Allah pleases, all will be well''

290
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:57,883
What is in this bundle?

291
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:00,986
l won't allow vulgar clothes in this
house

292
01:09:03,487 --> 01:09:06,059
''My Aunt, in this bundle there are
better clothes''

293
01:09:07,993 --> 01:09:09,027
For them?

294
01:09:09,894 --> 01:09:13,836
And you were quivering at the
thought that he would kill you

295
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:18,739
There are many whose palms were
itching to get at them

296
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,177
How will you save them?

297
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,192
By marying...

298
01:09:39,995 --> 01:09:43,535
You'll mary all three?

299
01:09:47,936 --> 01:09:50,542
''No, only that one
- What did you say?''

300
01:09:50,773 --> 01:09:53,545
Are you deaf? Can't you hear?

301
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:04,958
Please take your wife and Kader home

302
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:08,761
Send some clothes for them to wear

303
01:10:20,573 --> 01:10:21,975
May l take your leave?

304
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,606
ls this how you behave with your
guests

305
01:10:49,605 --> 01:10:51,742
''Why, what have l done?''

306
01:10:52,008 --> 01:10:56,951
''What have you not done? In front of
all, you have insulted your wife''

307
01:10:57,813 --> 01:10:59,551
What is so special about this girl?

308
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:04,158
''Aunt, you have no idea''

309
01:11:05,956 --> 01:11:07,726
The spell this girl has cast on me

310
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,565
J
''When l first saw her
l was entranced''

311
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,569
''Her aura, her beauty...''

312
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,309
Even a bud would blush beside her

313
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,979
That's why you plucked the flower

314
01:11:24,177 --> 01:11:27,583
''Having killed that poor man,
you've turned poet''

315
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:29,584
l'll cut your tongue and feed it
to the crows

316
01:11:29,715 --> 01:11:31,320
''Don't talk like a child, Javed''

317
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:35,093
''lf your concern is beauty, what lack
is there in your wife?''

318
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:36,592
''She is a little dark, that's all''

319
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:39,997
Then why does she rave and rant?
l'm not divorcing her

320
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:42,331
She rules the place as my first wife

321
01:11:42,596 --> 01:11:45,602
l'll see that SarFraz
kills these foreigners

322
01:11:46,234 --> 01:11:49,007
As if he'll come from his battles
just for you

323
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:52,945
He is fighting out there with his life
and not sitting at home wearing bangles

324
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,615
''Aunt, tell her to shut her mouth!
- Enough''

325
01:11:57,281 --> 01:11:59,217
Now sit here and listen to me

326
01:12:06,891 --> 01:12:12,235
She may look grown up
but she is a child

327
01:12:13,731 --> 01:12:15,568
''And a Christian, at that''

328
01:12:17,302 --> 01:12:21,912
You too were a Hindu once

329
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:25,246
And about the same age

330
01:12:25,579 --> 01:12:27,581
My father's neck was not slit!

331
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:32,590
Nor was l brought up in captivity.
- You turn evemhing your way

332
01:12:34,589 --> 01:12:36,225
l want this girl

333
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:40,263
l will have her at any cost

334
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:55,012
l want to talk to you

335
01:13:57,114 --> 01:13:59,550
There's no need to wory

336
01:14:02,052 --> 01:14:04,556
l will mary your daughter legally

337
01:14:07,557 --> 01:14:11,565
l'll give her good money and the
respectability of ajunior wife

338
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:21,576
But you are married already.
- So?

339
01:14:21,873 --> 01:14:23,376
How is this possible?

340
01:14:24,577 --> 01:14:29,586
Why not? Our religion permits it

341
01:14:31,752 --> 01:14:33,589
l don't wish to argue

342
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:39,597
Just recently your people
killed my husband

343
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,598
Not by my hand

344
01:14:43,598 --> 01:14:47,605
Now you might kill all three of us

345
01:14:53,241 --> 01:14:56,014
You are in mourning and need time

346
01:14:57,013 --> 01:14:59,953
Take your time

347
01:15:01,851 --> 01:15:05,558
But don't ever display your English
superiority to me

348
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,822
l was thinking of taking Miriam
to my house for a few days

349
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:06,724
And leave this girl here?

350
01:17:06,991 --> 01:17:07,925
No!

351
01:17:09,126 --> 01:17:11,563
lt will be a change for all of them
- No!

352
01:17:12,196 --> 01:17:14,901
''Even in my home, they will be your
responsibility''

353
01:17:15,867 --> 01:17:17,970
''After all
you have the right óver them''

354
01:17:19,237 --> 01:17:20,573
''No, l have made up my mind''

355
01:17:25,577 --> 01:17:26,979
''Once l've decided, l never retract''

356
01:17:29,982 --> 01:17:31,250
Pay attention and listen

357
01:17:32,585 --> 01:17:33,586
l never take no for an answer

358
01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:42,999
Then how can you be so adamant
with me?

359
01:18:57,145 --> 01:18:58,281
Be careful

360
01:19:00,549 --> 01:19:02,552
''Allah be praised, she is with child''

361
01:20:00,849 --> 01:20:02,285
''Enough dear, now allow Ruth to sing''

362
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:26,311
''Ruth, please sing''

363
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:36,328
Sing.
Sing one of your songs

364
01:22:51,204 --> 01:22:52,340
lf you don't pour three mugs of water
in the name of Allah...

365
01:22:52,672 --> 01:22:53,675
how will you be purified?

366
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:11,629
What are you doing?

367
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:32,520
How well you've embroidered it

368
01:23:33,419 --> 01:23:36,191
You people are vey clever with
your fingers

369
01:23:36,421 --> 01:23:40,597
''Look at us, we just sit around, doing
nothing all day long''

370
01:23:41,394 --> 01:23:43,531
God save us from these foreigners

371
01:23:43,663 --> 01:23:45,599
Akhtarbi. Get me my waistband

372
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:48,203
What atrocities have they
not committed?

373
01:23:48,335 --> 01:23:50,206
They robbed us of our lives

374
01:23:52,673 --> 01:23:54,543
ln Kanpur they were taught a lesson

375
01:23:56,543 --> 01:23:58,414
They were hacked to pieces

376
01:23:58,646 --> 01:24:01,886
Allah shouldn't allow even
one of them to remain

377
01:24:03,685 --> 01:24:05,890
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?

378
01:24:05,988 --> 01:24:09,462
Why be shamed? Am l a foreigner?

379
01:24:09,892 --> 01:24:11,895
''After their ablutions, they don't wash''

380
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:17,169
''They use paper, dirty paper!''

381
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:23,579
''While husbands watch, they dance
with other men''

382
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:25,845
They indulge in kissing

383
01:24:27,778 --> 01:24:32,855
''That wife of the resident Lucknow,
what was her name?''

384
01:24:33,584 --> 01:24:39,196
''Pretending love all that,
she looted the Oudh territoy''

385
01:24:40,358 --> 01:24:44,533
Look at poor Javed. She has him in
her spell...

386
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:46,199
Will you keep quiet

387
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:51,873
l thank you

388
01:24:54,209 --> 01:24:58,382
Don't thank me. l am doing
what decency demands

389
01:25:12,228 --> 01:25:16,235
Haven't your foreigners returned?

390
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:19,169
Doesn't your Aunt plan
to send them back?

391
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:21,507
Pay my respects to your
Aunt and tell her...

392
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:26,849
''even if she makes a pickle of them,
it won't hurt me a bit''

393
01:25:27,811 --> 01:25:29,715
Has the Nawab been enquiring?

394
01:25:29,847 --> 01:25:33,521
He's busy with his own problems

395
01:25:34,385 --> 01:25:35,855
This will remain your problem

396
01:25:41,659 --> 01:25:42,862
They are asking for you

397
01:26:05,753 --> 01:26:07,557
What have you decided?

398
01:26:10,559 --> 01:26:11,895
l want a definite answer

399
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,233
l haven't had time to think about it

400
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:19,571
Why are you making me angy?

401
01:26:21,337 --> 01:26:23,175
My mother hasn't been well

402
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:28,848
Old age is full of illness

403
01:26:31,482 --> 01:26:35,189
You refuse to become a Christian
- Never!

404
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:39,859
l will make your daughter
read the Quran

405
01:26:41,594 --> 01:26:44,198
My brothers must consent to this

406
01:26:45,331 --> 01:26:46,666
There is a limit to your excuses

407
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,539
Why don't you understand that l want
your daughter?

408
01:26:51,704 --> 01:26:54,776
You know l can have her any time.
What will you do about that?

409
01:26:54,874 --> 01:26:56,210
She can't do a thing

410
01:26:56,443 --> 01:27:00,218
Take her then.
You will enhance the name of Pathans

411
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,552
lt is because l am a Pathan
that they are safe

412
01:27:02,883 --> 01:27:03,885
l have given them shelter

413
01:27:05,218 --> 01:27:08,224
And l treat them with respect

414
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:16,237
What will happen to you if the
English regain power?

415
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:18,502
What can happen?

416
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:23,509
Theywill hang us. Or shoot holes into
US

417
01:27:24,174 --> 01:27:27,180
Would you like Ruth to be a widow?

418
01:27:28,179 --> 01:27:31,652
You talk as if the English are
round the corner

419
01:27:33,384 --> 01:27:36,356
Don't you know that Delhi is in
our power

420
01:27:36,854 --> 01:27:38,591
The English have besieged the city

421
01:27:38,856 --> 01:27:43,198
Our General will rest only after all
the English have been finished

422
01:27:45,865 --> 01:27:48,536
Then let Delhi be the deciding factor

423
01:27:50,536 --> 01:27:53,608
''lf Delhi is yours, Ruth is yours''

424
01:28:01,216 --> 01:28:04,890
But should the English
capture Delhi...

425
01:28:05,386 --> 01:28:08,692
you should not even speak to Ruth

426
01:28:10,358 --> 01:28:12,896
Or force the marriage

427
01:28:15,564 --> 01:28:18,169
''Agreed?
- Yes, l agree''

428
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:24,509
Are you afraid the English will win?

429
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:35,323
All right

430
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:43,797
When will you allow me
to take them back?

431
01:28:45,264 --> 01:28:47,535
Why are you so impatient?

432
01:28:53,774 --> 01:28:55,877
''Miriam, please listen to me''

433
01:28:59,213 --> 01:29:02,552
Javed Khan is not dissolute
as you think

434
01:29:02,717 --> 01:29:05,221
The enemy is always suspect

435
01:29:05,619 --> 01:29:07,891
But he does want to mary Ruth

436
01:29:35,186 --> 01:29:37,690
Unrequited love can consume you

437
01:29:37,855 --> 01:29:41,529
lt could lead to your doom

438
01:29:41,859 --> 01:29:43,863
Like the bird desiring moon

439
01:29:43,995 --> 01:29:49,206
''Defeated into consuming fire,
and being reduced to ashes''

440
01:29:52,204 --> 01:29:55,411
Can't you see that our neighbors
are spitting at me?

441
01:29:56,209 --> 01:29:59,615
''lf he marries that foreigner, what
status will l have?''

442
01:29:59,712 --> 01:30:01,215
l will be worse than a slave here

443
01:30:01,349 --> 01:30:03,385
You must threaten those foreigners...

444
01:30:03,617 --> 01:30:06,356
We have been badly defeated in Kanpur

445
01:30:08,622 --> 01:30:10,225
l have come to look for soldiers

446
01:30:10,525 --> 01:30:12,562
lt's not for me to interFere
in your personal quarrels

447
01:30:38,591 --> 01:30:40,526
You foreigners are a scheming lot...

448
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:44,197
you took over the county under the
guise of trade

449
01:30:44,695 --> 01:30:47,369
And now you wish to save your skin
by offering your daughter?

450
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,406
''With you here, what hope do we have''

451
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:57,713
We witnessed your great humanity
in the Church

452
01:30:59,545 --> 01:31:03,620
''For you, humanity becomes real
when an Englishman is killed''

453
01:31:05,353 --> 01:31:06,755
Only he has an identity

454
01:31:06,887 --> 01:31:12,633
''With so many Indian, what do
a few dead among them matter''

455
01:31:14,897 --> 01:31:18,168
That's why your Colonel Neill cuts
down Indians as if they are vegetables

456
01:31:18,299 --> 01:31:21,840
An entire regiment of blameless
soldiers were mowed down

457
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:24,175
Village after village burnt

458
01:31:24,507 --> 01:31:26,176
Evey tree strung with corpses

459
01:31:27,343 --> 01:31:33,189
Babies impaled with lances and
fed to vultures

460
01:31:34,184 --> 01:31:36,187
''All this, in the name of humanity?''

461
01:33:12,894 --> 01:33:17,637
''Friends, we might have lost at Kanpur''

462
01:33:19,735 --> 01:33:20,869
But we haven't lost the war

463
01:33:21,635 --> 01:33:22,904
The war continues...

464
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,242
The actual confrontation will be
in Delhi

465
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:29,249
But Delhi is surrounded by foreigners

466
01:33:32,248 --> 01:33:39,595
Four centuries we have paid our
homage to this land and worshipped it

467
01:33:41,592 --> 01:33:47,604
ln no corner of India will we allow even
the shadow of these impure people

468
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,671
Blood...there is blood eveywhere

469
01:33:51,269 --> 01:33:55,678
''Like pigeons they hover and cloud
the sky''

470
01:33:58,511 --> 01:34:03,688
Let me savour my own pain

471
01:34:03,783 --> 01:34:07,456
''lf that is my destiny, l will bear it''

472
01:34:11,626 --> 01:34:14,699
This fakir is talking nonsense!
He is demented...liar

473
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:17,634
His speech is that of a coward

474
01:34:17,865 --> 01:34:19,568
And only cowards will pay heed to him

475
01:34:50,869 --> 01:34:54,609
''Friends, in this hour of trial...''

476
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:58,480
''Let us, in the name of our prophets''

477
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:10,299
prayto God for success in our holy
CaUSe

478
01:35:20,635 --> 01:35:24,443
ln a face is reflected a suffering heart

479
01:35:24,607 --> 01:35:30,250
You see in it the havoc of love

480
01:35:35,252 --> 01:35:38,758
whenever her name is uttered

481
01:35:47,598 --> 01:35:50,604
notice the look on his face

482
01:35:58,677 --> 01:36:03,621
Swines! Scoundrels! Idiots!

483
01:36:44,795 --> 01:36:46,265
Haven't you fed the pigeons today?

484
01:36:47,499 --> 01:36:50,905
Why ask me?
- Aren't you the mistress of the house?

485
01:36:51,402 --> 01:36:54,675
l thought that the foreign girl
was the mistress

486
01:36:56,274 --> 01:36:57,677
Some people are born shirkers

487
01:37:00,678 --> 01:37:02,682
Why haven't you got the
'hooka' ready?

488
01:37:04,283 --> 01:37:06,889
''lf you want to display your anger,
go to war or shout at that woman''

489
01:37:09,956 --> 01:37:11,959
''Since you can't shout at her,
why take it out on me?''

490
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:16,767
Shut up
- Who are you to shut me up?

491
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:24,647
What can she give that l can't?

492
01:37:24,974 --> 01:37:27,812
A child. An heir

493
01:37:28,577 --> 01:37:30,247
You will never be able to do the same

494
01:43:08,621 --> 01:43:12,428
Hell and damnation on these pigeons

495
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:15,462
They are birds of ill omen

496
01:43:15,661 --> 01:43:20,304
Their presence has cursed the death of
our soldiers

497
01:43:21,301 --> 01:43:23,706
A thousand curses on them

498
01:43:25,372 --> 01:43:26,774
They are profare

499
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:29,811
''Stop it, SarFraz''

500
01:43:33,314 --> 01:43:34,717
''Otherwise, l'll kill you''

501
01:43:34,982 --> 01:43:38,657
''You will kill me to save them,
but not for the county''

502
01:43:38,988 --> 01:43:41,860
lt is this self-indulgence that has
betrayed us

503
01:43:42,057 --> 01:43:43,661
We have lost Delhi

504
01:43:46,928 --> 01:44:00,023
''Traitors, selfish rogues, this county
is full of them''

505
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:05,352
They are all traitors

506
01:44:05,684 --> 01:44:09,759
This obsession is causing you to
betray your real self

507
01:44:12,357 --> 01:44:17,968
These foreigners have surpassed
the massacre of Nadirshah

508
01:44:18,965 --> 01:44:20,967
lnhumanity and cruelty have
over-reached their horizons

509
01:44:21,301 --> 01:44:26,980
''ln Delhi, the Indian sepoys have
served as cannon-balls''

510
01:45:49,365 --> 01:45:53,473
''Mother, we have won Delhi''

511
01:45:55,004 --> 01:45:55,906
Now we need have no fear

512
01:45:57,742 --> 01:46:00,513
How do we know Javed Khan will
keep his word

513
01:46:21,635 --> 01:46:22,769
God keep you safe

514
01:49:43,525 --> 01:49:47,465
You must make your decision today
- About what?

515
01:49:49,764 --> 01:49:50,834
About marying your daughter

516
01:49:52,535 --> 01:49:55,474
l thought a Pathan honoured his promises

517
01:49:58,741 --> 01:50:00,010
Giving my promise was an error

518
01:50:01,911 --> 01:50:07,757
What has war to do with human
relationships

519
01:50:08,485 --> 01:50:11,359
lt has...why else are we here as
prisoners?

520
01:50:14,092 --> 01:50:16,363
''lf you go free from here, do you know
what will happen to you''

521
01:50:17,294 --> 01:50:18,631
People will burn you alive

522
01:50:20,799 --> 01:50:23,505
After what happened in Delhi...

523
01:50:23,969 --> 01:50:25,840
Why do you keep on about Delhi?

524
01:50:26,707 --> 01:50:28,844
There is the rest of India still

525
01:50:29,975 --> 01:50:31,979
We will still defeat the English

526
01:50:32,713 --> 01:50:34,315
You think the English are a pack
of sheep?

527
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,818
''That with a flick of a whip,
they will bleat?''

528
01:50:42,858 --> 01:50:45,729
As your mother

529
01:50:51,466 --> 01:50:52,635
Why don't you ask your daughter?

530
01:50:53,835 --> 01:50:54,872
Ruth is still a child

531
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:57,676
She'll do as l tell her

532
01:50:59,642 --> 01:51:01,012
''So, you won't change your stand''

533
01:51:02,746 --> 01:51:05,819
''Oh God, if someone pleaded like this
before you...''

534
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:07,017
so many wishes would be granted

535
01:51:07,817 --> 01:51:09,521
What of your manhood?

536
01:51:09,987 --> 01:51:12,693
To beg of foreigners is demeaning

537
01:51:15,358 --> 01:51:16,963
Why do you disgrace me so?

538
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:19,864
Why can't you understand?

539
01:51:19,965 --> 01:51:23,640
''She has possessed me, body and soul''

540
01:51:25,471 --> 01:51:28,311
''When l die, only then
will she leave me''

541
01:51:29,977 --> 01:51:34,652
What do you want? Shall l give in
and commit suicide

542
01:51:34,881 --> 01:51:35,782
Let your enemies commit suicide

543
01:51:35,982 --> 01:51:37,719
Let that low-down slut die

544
01:52:33,713 --> 01:52:36,652
Mother has passed away

545
01:52:47,461 --> 01:52:48,997
May her soul rest in peace

546
01:52:54,002 --> 01:52:55,337
l'll arrange for the burial

547
01:52:55,904 --> 01:52:59,412
Mother will have a Christian burial

548
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:08,757
How can that be possible?

549
01:53:10,554 --> 01:53:15,697
Mother was a Christian in life.
She will be buried as Christian

550
01:55:21,366 --> 01:55:23,369
We have caused you a lot of trouble

551
01:55:25,704 --> 01:55:27,706
l don't wish to add to your troubles
by living here

552
01:55:30,775 --> 01:55:32,913
Can we go and live in your Aunt's
house?

553
01:55:57,872 --> 01:55:59,743
From now on they will stay with you

554
01:56:01,577 --> 01:56:02,745
You too will join the battle

555
01:56:14,657 --> 01:56:16,695
You are so obstinate

556
01:56:18,695 --> 01:56:20,366
l will destroy your pride

557
02:03:10,118 --> 02:03:13,425
Let's see how many more will be
hanged by these foreigners

558
02:09:30,773 --> 02:09:33,613
Don't leave! Stay...back!

559
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:39,984
''What's the news, Kader?''

560
02:10:40,116 --> 02:10:42,454
The English are coming
in this direction

561
02:10:43,788 --> 02:10:46,461
We must leave immediately.
The others are doing the same

562
02:10:57,669 --> 02:11:00,475
He will come here in search of us

563
02:11:01,475 --> 02:11:04,046
He will come to know
where we're headed

564
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,150
What will happen to them?
- Meaning?

565
02:11:09,148 --> 02:11:11,486
lf the foreigners are coming this way
then...

566
02:11:11,719 --> 02:11:14,491
lsn't it better to leave them here?

567
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:17,093
''ln that case, you should come with us''

568
02:15:25,967 --> 02:15:31,646
Where are the foreigners?
- In the Church

569
02:17:09,948 --> 02:17:13,088
Who is that?
- It's me

570
02:17:15,689 --> 02:17:17,827
Who?
- Javed Khan!

571
02:17:24,731 --> 02:17:26,501
Open the door!

572
02:17:27,502 --> 02:17:31,510
l want to see your daughter once more

573
02:17:53,196 --> 02:17:54,532
You cannot meet Ruth

574
02:17:56,033 --> 02:18:00,676
Please go away from here.
Your life is in danger

575
02:19:09,548 --> 02:19:15,894
''Come, Khusro, it is time to go home''

576
02:19:17,823 --> 02:19:22,501
Dusk settles around us

577
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:34,850
We will not see passion of
such colour ''again''
