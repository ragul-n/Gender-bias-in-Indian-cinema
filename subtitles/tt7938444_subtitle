Hey! Easy catch Go for it.

2
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:28,970
Catch it... catch it.

3
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:31,735
- Hey, come on... come on.
- Bowl'

4
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,424
What are you doing?

5
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:35,575
- Have you called the chair contractor?
- Yes, bro.

6
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,571
- Ask him not to delay.
- I'll take care, bro.

7
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:38,954
Hey boys.

8
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,067
'Bowl'

9
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:41,373
Take your stumps and leave.

10
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,063
Why, bro? What is the matter?

11
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,483
Do I have to explain to you?

12
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:47,555
Arbitration meeting is being held
for our temple festival here.

13
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,551
Let's get organized
before the VIPs come.

14
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:51,626
Take it out - As you say, bro.

15
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,200
Boys, what is happening?

16
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,426
Panchayat meeting regarding
the temple festival at Vettaikaruppu.

17
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:59,843
Festival, huh? Wretched people!

18
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:02,301
Wonder how many heads will roll!

19
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:04,528
My family deity, save us.

20
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,024
My heart is skipping many beats!

21
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:41,392
Greetings.

22
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:46,077
'Hello... how are you?'

23
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:07,043
Hey Muthu Listen to me.

24
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,578
Why are you so adamant?

25
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,840
You will behave yourself only when
the right person comes along!

26
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,738
Muthu, I'm going for an auspicious event.

27
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:31,312
Don't worry.

28
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:43,755
Hey Muruga!

29
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,480
Sir has started
Bring out the car fast.

30
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:06,947
Welcome, sir.

31
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,093
Please be seated, aiya.

32
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,858
- How are you, aiya?
- I am fine.

33
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:18,314
Aiya is here.

34
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,887
- Concerned people are yet to come.
- That's right.

35
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:25,187
We have waited for 7 long years.

36
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,069
Won't we wait a little longer?

37
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:29,757
Let them take their time.

38
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:37,091
Karumaiyi anna, Panchayat has assembled
The entire village is waiting for us.

39
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:38,282
That's alright.

40
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,306
'The temple festival
of Vettaikaruppu'

41
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,378
'...is held in Theni, by 7 villages
Mudur, Sembadhi, Arungulam'

42
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,335
'Thekkuru, Lakshmipuram,
Mangalam and Kottaiyur'

43
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,368
'All these villagers unite to
perform this important festival'

44
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,365
'7 years ago'

45
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:24,707
'That temple festival
began with revelry'

46
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,816
Welcome welcome
Hey newly married groom!

47
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,235
Got married without inviting us?

48
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,309
Karumaiyi, even you didn't inform us.

49
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:34,960
We knew only this morning.

50
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,919
Then how can you tell us?
Please sit down.

51
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:39,261
Hey, it's the turn of this village.

52
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:42,218
Don't feel shy
Take big mouthfuls.

53
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:48,055
Why are you stingy with meat
when you serve us?

54
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,821
I am not being partial at all

55
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:53,123
I've been noticing, you serve
according to the face not the leaf!

56
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,850
You should have been put in place
Now you are asked to serve.

57
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:57,578
Serve him all the mutton we have.

58
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:58,807
Family of gluttons!

59
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:01,341
Thekkur people wait for
the festival to eat meat I think.

60
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,531
So starved for food!

61
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,951
Nitwit! What did you say?

62
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:05,871
- Hey! Don't leave him.
- How dare you!

63
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:07,714
We can serve ample meat for 7 villages.

64
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,213
Thekkur people, get up.

65
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:11,402
'An ordinary fight over meat'

66
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,091
'...magnified into a world war!'

67
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:16,240
Greetings, aiya.

68
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,851
Tell that fellow to leave
Or I'll kill him right here.

69
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,848
Mind your words
in front of our sir.

70
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:22,730
He's letting his tongue run, aiya.

71
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:24,803
People, get up - Sit down.

72
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,800
Go back to enjoying the feast.

73
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,839
You go.

74
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:29,336
GO...!

75
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,519
Why do we have this custom
of community prayer?

76
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:37,168
To foster unity and
forge happiness, eh?

77
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:38,245
Is it to fight?

78
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,586
Aiya, why are you serving?

79
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:42,506
Wait - Let me serve, aiya.

80
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,234
Our children Our temple

81
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:46,730
- I can serve them.
- Aiya, please let me serve.

82
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,645
'As a revered village head,
aiya solved the minor clash of words'

83
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,098
'People thought it was over
but it wasn't amicably solved'

84
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:59,631
Your tongues wag here
and you bore the insults there.

85
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:01,936
Who asked you to eat like gluttons?

86
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:03,818
That mongrel should've been killed.

87
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:05,623
Before the festival ends
close his chapter.

88
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:08,195
He deserves to have
his throat slit, bro.

89
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,730
'Tell me if you can't
I'll do the needful!'

90
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,803
Are your people
'All words no action'?

91
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,376
'He should be pickled to pieces'

92
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,829
'Last day of the festival'

93
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:24,400
'Village deity was being taken
on a procession, aiya also followed'

94
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,658
Chop him to pieces!

95
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,877
Let this be a lesson to everyone.

96
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:40,221
Don't, I beg you.

97
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,872
You deserve to die!

98
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,827
'Hey, Ponnuthayi!'

99
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:49,552
Your son has been butchered.

100
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:51,165
My dear son.

101
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,547
'Oh my god!'

102
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,619
'Aiyaiyo!'

103
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,077
Look at this atrocity.

104
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:01,149
They killed him brutally
for such a petty issue.

105
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,376
We must avenge this brutality!

106
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:12,861
All words and no action, huh?

107
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,319
Saw us in action?
We squared the insult.

108
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,047
You are the complete man!

109
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:18,085
True lion.

110
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:21,655
Pray our son to be born is a lion cub
who takes after his father!

111
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:23,690
Go to hell now!

112
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,611
Brother-in-law!

113
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,683
Aiyo... my child.

114
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,219
My gawd! Pandi.

115
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,597
Not a single soul can touch him.

116
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,555
They killed my husband, right?

117
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,051
His entire lineage should be destroyed.

118
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:03,434
DO IT!

119
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:04,509
Come on.

120
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,506
Go and hack all of them.

121
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:08,003
Come on, all of you.

122
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:13,533
'They went on a witch-hunt
and killed every member of their clan'

123
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:32,618
'In the temple festival of
Vettaikaruppu, in Theni district'

124
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:35,459
'...the conflict between 2 sides
resulted in a severe riot'

125
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:37,379
'8 people have been reported dead'

126
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:41,719
'Even before aiya heard
and returned to the festival...'

127
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:44,291
'Reserve police gathered round the temple'

128
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:48,823
Thekkur villagers have infiltrated
into the festival and are killing everyone.

129
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,819
Come soon and save us.

130
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:55,619
Pechi, we have killed everyone.

131
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:56,925
Only 1 chap remains.

132
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:58,537
We'll hunt him down
and kill him too.

133
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,419
Don't give me a count half way through.

134
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:01,725
Finish once and for all.

135
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,879
GO!

136
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,098
'Don't think we'll spare you'

137
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:11,440
- Aiya... save me.
- We'll kill you.

138
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,552
- They killed everyone, aiya.
- Hey! Stop.

139
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,088
Please save me, aiya.

140
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,039
Put your sickles down.

141
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,186
Aiya, we respect you.

142
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:28,144
But this sickle is unaware.

143
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:29,296
Don't interfere.

144
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,216
The goat can be terrified of a sickle.

145
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,752
Will our guardian deity be scared?

146
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:35,863
We have to seek revenge
Kill him right away.

147
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:51,760
'My heart beats with
every soul in this soil'

148
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,987
I won't allow another soul to be killed.

149
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:59,594
'The festival which slayed my husband...'

150
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:02,013
'Till the last soul is wiped out
from his assassin's clan'

151
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,319
'Pechi will not rest'

152
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,658
'Whenever the festival is held again'

153
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:09,770
'Pechi has vowed to kill him for sure'

154
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:13,648
'On the other hand aiya has sworn
not a single soul will be killed'

155
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:18,179
'Embroiled in court cases, the festival
has been stalled for 7 long years'

156
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:23,325
'People from the 7 villages have gathered
to resume the temple festival now'

157
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:39,875
Everyone has come, Pechi.

158
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,181
They are waiting for us.

159
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,447
Haven't we also waited
for 7 long years?

160
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:45,405
Can't they wait a little more?

161
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:47,517
I've been waiting for this day too.

162
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:51,242
'Pechi... untie me, Pechi!'

163
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,200
'I won't rest until I kill him'

164
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,507
'Pechi'

165
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,347
- 'Untie me, Pechi'
- Won't you shut up?

166
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:58,424
'Untie me'

167
00:12:58,922 --> 00:12:59,997
'Shut up'

168
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:09,674
Even our vow has a leftover.

169
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,634
Go.

170
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:13,859
Uncle... let me also come.

171
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,433
See if they fall in line with us.

172
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,354
Or else dig all their graves and come.

173
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:18,583
Don't relent.

174
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:54,218
Aiya has been waiting.

175
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:55,946
You take your own sweet time.

176
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:57,866
Should all 6 villages
wait here for you?

177
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:01,783
If aiya has come now, should we have
spread our mat last night and waited here?

178
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:04,240
How can you be impertinent?

179
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,775
Don't use aiya as an excuse
to threaten us.

180
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,733
Why are you shooting off your mouth?

181
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,115
[raised voices]

182
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:11,575
All of you, stop shouting.

183
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:12,842
You fellows pipe down.

184
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:14,800
All of us are well aware...

185
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,640
Vettaikaruppan temple festival is
the biggest festival in our district.

186
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:23,018
Due to certain bitter events, 7 years ago
such a splendid festival was stopped.

187
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:25,322
We are unable to bury
our differences till date.

188
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,704
Let bygones be bygones.

189
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:30,736
Now after wading through many court
cases, our village head has finally...

190
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:34,000
reached an amicable solution
after meeting Govt officials.

191
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,727
Let us forget the past.

192
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:40,029
Let us strive towards celebrating
our temple festival once more.

193
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:43,907
On behalf of this Panchayat, I request
total cooperation from one and all.

194
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:46,826
Go ahead and conduct the festival
Are we preventing you?

195
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:48,669
We are waiting eagerly for it too.

196
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:51,050
Even we have an unfulfilled vow.

197
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:52,701
'Heartless murderers'

198
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,696
Mayilu, haven't you
avenged 4 lives to 1?

199
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,309
Why hasn't your fury subsided still?

200
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,229
What? 4 to 1.

201
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:01,072
Is our 1 equal to their 4?

202
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:02,954
We won't stop till we wipe out 100%.

203
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:05,719
Whoever interferes this time
we will fulfil our vow!

204
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:08,675
Will you wipe an entire lineage
to avenge his death?

205
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:11,824
Only now one of our clan members
has become a collector.

206
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:14,013
You are chasing him with a vengeance.

207
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:16,586
Hey, you are fit only to
dance to a woman's tune!

208
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,698
Learn to think on your own instead.

209
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,731
Bang on! We dance to
our sister-in-law's tune

210
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,728
I feel like chopping you right here

211
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:26,186
[outburst of angry voices]

212
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:36,823
A festival is not only to offer
a feast to God and relish eating mutton!

213
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:40,279
For the past 7 years without rain
our land has been parched.

214
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,659
I begged the concerned officers

215
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:44,541
for an irrigation scheme
for 52 villages.

216
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,922
They pointed out we are incapable
of holding a festival.

217
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,416
And asked me how they can entrust us
with a scheme worth 1.2 billion.

218
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:52,451
Our festival has been stalled.

219
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,560
People in these 7 villages have
so many unfulfilled vows and donations.

220
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:59,210
Inter-village marriages
are clouded with animosity.

221
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,322
How long will we continue like this?

222
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:03,895
We have witnessed bloodshed.

223
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,775
So this year we have to
conduct our temple festival

224
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,656
I have signed an affidavit in court.

225
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:11,114
And discussed amicably
with all the officials.

226
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:12,688
Ask him for his opinion.

227
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:14,378
What is your opinion?

228
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,106
No change in our decision.

229
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,642
We will do what we want to.

230
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,215
Acting too big for your boots!

231
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,858
We agree, go ahead
and conduct the festival.

232
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:32,925
If we recommence, then no one
should be armed at the festival.

233
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,304
No one should get drunk.

234
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,376
Should not give shelter
to wrongdoers.

235
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:43,677
Inform the Panchayat leader
if a stranger is spotted in our area.

236
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:46,327
If you agree to these clauses...

237
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:51,165
all of you should swear
on milk which we hold scared.

238
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,984
Hey Karumaiyi
You come and swear too.

239
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,603
'Do you know what he has agreed to?'

240
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,519
Promised on milk we hold sacred
not to kill anyone or make trouble.

241
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,400
Did we wait 7 years for this?

242
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:39,280
To act is not just speaking words
Showing it in action!

243
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,970
What can Vettaikaruppan do?

244
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:42,736
So what if he swore like that?

245
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,042
Will we suffer a stroke?

246
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,386
Or vomit blood and die.

247
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:46,807
Whatever happens...

248
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:49,533
actions speak louder than words!

249
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:06,583
Though they conceded to your clauses
their rage seems unabated.

250
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:09,578
They will break their promise
and come armed to the festival.

251
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:13,610
To be safe, let's send Anbu out of town
for 7 days till the festival is over.

252
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:16,567
Is this how you speak,
sporting such a huge moustache

253
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,794
named after the braveheart Veerapandian?

254
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,981
If they intend to kill,
will we be silent spectators?

255
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,247
They are the seeds of the family.

256
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:27,242
Our life is mixed
with the word we have given.

257
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:32,042
We will stand united till the last drop
of blood from our bloodline dries!

258
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,075
I hope you trust me?

259
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,687
He is alive all these days
thanks only to you.

260
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,064
You have brought up my son
educated him and raised him so well

261
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:44,099
I bow to whatever you decide, aiya.

262
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:48,170
Till the festival is over
let Anbu stay in our house.

263
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,128
- We have to protect him.
- 'Okay, aiya'

264
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:52,970
- Thank you very much, aiya.
- We are grateful to you.

265
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:55,658
- Has he started?
- Who, aiya?

266
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,770
Of course he means
his son, who else?

267
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:01,149
Murugan has gone to the airport
He should be here anytime now.

268
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:06,103
Hey! Aiya is here Beat the drums.

269
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,522
Increase your decibel level.

270
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,943
Dance.

271
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,730
Where is he? Nowhere to be seen?

272
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:24,266
'A handsome 6 footer...'

273
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:26,839
- Why ask that fair lady?
- Asking the plane conductor.

274
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:29,872
'He said he is coming
in this flight, still missing'

275
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,082
Wait, he will come.

276
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,963
How can he go past us?

277
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:47,920
Only our aiya is missing
Everyone else has walked out.

278
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:50,109
'Did the plane leave him behind?'

279
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:53,872
Move... move fast.

280
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,671
Quick, move Make way for our car.

281
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,399
- Go fast.
- What are you waiting for?

282
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:02,973
Go... go - Make it fast.

283
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:04,048
'Move... move'

284
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,199
Big nuisance since morning, sir.

285
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:09,923
Fireworks, folk dance, drums
Going overboard on their revelry.

286
00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:12,112
Son of some village head
is coming from abroad.

287
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,687
Airport is a war zone!

288
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,979
Sir, isn't that you on those boards?

289
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,168
Is all this fanfare for you?

290
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,703
Sorry, aiya, I spoke out of turn.

291
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:30,045
No problem Focus on the road.

292
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,579
They are waiting and
you chose my car?

293
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:35,075
You just said they are going overboard.

294
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,802
Even I don't like this excess stuff
That's why I got in here.

295
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,645
Super, sir Very nice, sir.

296
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,371
Can you switch off the AC
and lower the glass?

297
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:44,445
It is hot and dusty outside, sir.

298
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,440
This is the heat and dust of my land

299
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,475
I came to experience this after 7 years.

300
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,781
Lower the glass.

301
00:20:53,277 --> 00:20:55,235
You respect our land so much.

302
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:56,810
You have a way with words.

303
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:58,077
Very nice, sir.

304
00:20:58,115 --> 00:20:59,115
Simple, sir

305
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,418
I got into your car
resenting all that fanfare.

306
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:03,837
Kindly stop your shower of praise
and drive properly.

307
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:04,914
Okay, sir.

308
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,250
Welcome, aiya.

309
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,893
Aiya.

310
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,427
Aiya, vanakkam.

311
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:27,415
"He's a double edged sword
who makes South Indians proud."

312
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:32,407
"Even if he is dusky in complexion
he's the classic tall, handsome man."

313
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:37,706
"Hero full of mercy, he can't bear to see
even a sparrow suffer however tiny."

314
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:42,506
"Even if hindered by a waterfall cascading
he will pitch in for his people, crusading."

315
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,767
"Like a golden chariot is his stride
And all the villages look wide-eyed."

316
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,797
"Our motherland showers glory
on this man who has created history."

317
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:58,288
"He is the son born to victory
who can defeat him in this century?"

318
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:01,475
"Who can his vanquisher be?"

319
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:04,240
"Who can cross swords with him easily?"

320
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:07,581
Did you see my son?

321
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:09,386
Has he changed?

322
00:22:09,616 --> 00:22:10,807
Isn't he still the same?

323
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:13,341
We felt the same - Yes, aiya.

324
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:15,531
Let's eat.

325
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,642
Aiya has been waiting for you.

326
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,787
Why are you standing apart?
Let's eat together.

327
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,976
Hello, aiya - Hello.

328
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:36,995
They threw chairs aside
when they argued loudly

329
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,146
I thought you will trample him flat.

330
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:41,719
Claiming to run a gym
they are big bullies, aiya.

331
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:43,792
Their beefed up bodies
make them arrogant!

332
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:47,133
I thought he will get it from you,
but you let him off easy.

333
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:49,552
Why gossip when we can
enjoy our food?

334
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,319
Isn't he back after a long time?

335
00:22:51,357 --> 00:22:52,701
Let him eat in peace.

336
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:54,314
Go ahead - Okay, aiya.

337
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,264
Who is that, uncle?

338
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:03,184
You've just landed here.

339
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:04,605
You'll know shortly.

340
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:07,523
Er... it seems he yelled
at my father in the Panchayat?

341
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,520
- That's why.
- Why do you want to buy trouble?

342
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,864
We will handle it.

343
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,743
Morons! What are you doing there?

344
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,776
Aiya, everyone has come, including
all the planes but your son is missing.

345
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,426
He reached long ago.

346
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:21,847
He has even finished his lunch!
All of you come back home.

347
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:43,439
"Chatter box, bold and brassy
Grab the rooster, lassie."

348
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:46,742
"Run, what the heck!
Grab him by his neck."

349
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:48,508
When I catch you... rascal!

350
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:52,616
"Your rooster has a mind of his own
On to the thatched roof he has flown."

351
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:54,383
Hey! Wait Don't make me run.

352
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:00,911
Hey!

353
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:07,938
Dai! Stop.

354
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,046
Hey!

355
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:22,454
If you sit in that jeep
you think I'll let you go scot-free?

356
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,295
Minx! Will you come?
Or shall I get you?

357
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:26,486
What are you saying?

358
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:27,599
Ssshhhh!

359
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,814
I'll get you.

360
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:42,959
"Chatter box, smart and sassy
Go and grab the rooster, lassie."

361
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:45,570
"Run, what the heck!
Grab him by his neck."

362
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,529
Whom are you acting smart with?

363
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:48,911
I'll spank you.

364
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,754
Scratched my hand... cha!

365
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:53,135
Bro, hold this.

366
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,209
- What?
- Hold, I say.

367
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:02,505
Give... aiyaiyo!

368
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,734
Why did you let it fly?

369
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,231
You know how tough it was.

370
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,230
Butter fingers!

371
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:07,612
Go and get him - Me...?

372
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,994
Get down and go.

373
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,484
Catch... yov!

374
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,745
Get him now.

375
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,201
- Yov! What are you doing?
- You told me to catch it.

376
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,313
Is this how you catch
a rooster? Dodo!

377
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,847
Can't I make out
a scent hound by its face?

378
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,110
Ther... ov... over there.

379
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,220
Watch out.

380
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,372
Clear off!

381
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:45,090
Why did I ask you to help?!

382
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:48,201
Aren't you going through Kariapatti?

383
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,314
Yes

384
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:52,463
I'm so out of breath
I can't take even 1 step forward.

385
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:53,961
Drop me there.

386
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,638
Isn't this aiya's jeep?

387
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,174
Why are you having a joy ride?

388
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:05,826
Are you his new driver?

389
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:09,513
Yes.

390
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,046
Where is that fatso Murugan
who looks like Ganesha?

391
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:14,274
It's his day off

392
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,841
I've saved you from hell.

393
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:22,646
You'll be cooking in a pot by now.

394
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:24,450
Your lifeline is long indeed.

395
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:27,714
Yov! Why do you look
at my face and drive?

396
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,442
Eyes on the road I say.

397
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:32,553
Why don't you play a song?

398
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,778
Er... song... all that is-

399
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:37,852
Swerve left please.

400
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,812
Why?

401
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,039
If that teacher sees me
he'll dissect me!

402
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,572
Were you his student?

403
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:45,801
Thank God!

404
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:48,182
If he taught me
I would be a moron!

405
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,524
Half his students are cowherds!

406
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:51,830
That man is my father.

407
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:54,249
He must be looking for me
and this rooster!

408
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,898
He'll keep showing grooms
at the drop of a hat!

409
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:59,586
Weekly twice
In all shapes and sizes!

410
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,468
Does he want to get you married?

411
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:06,114
Looks like you'll ask me
my entire history!

412
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:07,266
Watch the road.

413
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:11,913
Slow down near the tree
I'll get down on the way.

414
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:16,866
Right... right.

415
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:17,980
Bye...!

416
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,981
According to the 'flower-oracle'
omen isn't good.

417
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:42,287
Postpone it a bit.

418
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:43,438
You want us to wait?

419
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,974
We've waited for 7 years
How much longer to wait?

420
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:48,854
These aren't my words
It's our deity's oracle.

421
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,838
Whether the priest predicts
or God wishes

422
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,375
we must do the needful.

423
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,364
How is your studies
coming along, collector?

424
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:09,052
Course is over, aiya
I'm just worried about the result.

425
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,202
Your brother Murugesan was my classmate.

426
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,506
My brother has spoken
a lot about you to me

427
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,657
I hope all good?

428
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:19,382
Why are you taking this route?

429
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,839
Won't we reach our village
if we go this way?

430
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,337
We'll take the shortcut.

431
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:38,428
Take a look, our dog
has been barking nonstop.

432
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:41,617
Aiya?

433
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,841
Why have you parked here?

434
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:46,031
What happened?

435
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,642
No idea, it stopped here
of its own accord.

436
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,215
We will know only if I get down.

437
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,654
- I won't spare you today.
- Kill him

438
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:07,305
- I'll make mincemeat out of you.
- Hey! Stop.

439
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,495
Move away.

440
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:11,298
- I said, move.
- What do you mean?

441
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,986
You want me to keep quiet
when he's right in front of me?

442
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,751
Why is the goat tethered here?

443
00:29:17,404 --> 00:29:18,978
Why, do you know?

444
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:21,051
That's the offering
for the temple festival.

445
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:23,586
You must pour turmeric water
and slaughter it there.

446
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,007
Not near a river or lake.

447
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,735
Feed it.

448
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:30,114
It will anyway be alive
only for 2 more days.

449
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:33,225
Bro, what's the matter?

450
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,250
Why are you staring so blankly?
Don't you recognize me?

451
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:42,786
I am aiya's son.

452
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:45,935
We are distant cousins, right?

453
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:47,778
Did I get the relation mixed up?

454
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:51,465
Won't you be hospitable to your guest?

455
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:53,654
Give me some water.

456
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:21,724
Engine is boiling
That's why I asked.

457
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,910
One of them spoke rudely to my father.

458
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,522
Is he here?

459
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:30,479
Not here, aiya.

460
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:34,934
Here you go

461
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,615
I'll be here from now on.

462
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:43,612
Till the end of our temple festival.

463
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:46,607
We can meet there.

464
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:05,346
Ma, when will you tonsure my head?

465
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:08,342
After I chop his head!

466
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:16,175
Vettaikaruppu temple festival
has recommenced after 7 years.

467
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:36,335
"Vettaikaruppu, our village savior."

468
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:41,980
"He is renowned as a brave warrior."

469
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:48,354
"Spicy lamb shanks on the stove simmer."

470
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:53,922
"To drink this soup, savor the flavor
stomachs beat a tattoo louder by the hour."

471
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:59,490
"Our village head's word we respect
He's the lion of Madurai perfect."

472
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:04,982
"Our blood flows with temerity truly
If we revolt, villagers will endorse duly."

473
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:22,146
"Born in this village hot and sunshiny
People love to dance in harmony."

474
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:27,561
"We will gather in the temple right royally
Love as sacred ash we'll apply liberally."

475
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,094
"If you swim in Mullai river you'll see
how our hearts are filled with mercy."

476
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:32,169
He's my friend, aiya.

477
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:33,897
Is that so? Okay... okay.

478
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:35,625
Carry on
No need.

479
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:38,582
"Our bravery can be won over easily
by tender loving care generously."

480
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,881
"In the village where our leader lives Wrap
up enmity into your attic as archives."

481
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,410
"Call your kith and kin
Cook a feast fit for a king."

482
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:55,094
"Youngsters come and make merry
Pep up with your own brand of mimicry."

483
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,778
We've arranged 5 vans for
the out-of-towners to attend the festival.

484
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,697
We cleaned the bushes
behind the temple.

485
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:05,769
Cater to all their needs.

486
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:11,644
"Ace it."

487
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:14,332
"Karuppa, our village deity
Our precious divinity."

488
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,097
"Karuppa, our clan's savior
Our precious protector."

489
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:21,052
"Karuppa, with good measure of temerity."

490
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:26,697
"Karuppa's temerity
spells terror in totality."

491
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,908
"Girls from Vadipatti and Vadugapatti
queue up, bedecked in gold and gaiety."

492
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:44,361
"When girls flock, posters on the wall
Banners welcome them, one and all."

493
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,006
"Don't come in like a kissing cousin
And play your pranks plenty within."

494
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:55,343
"Keep your desires in check forever
Greet the girls from outside with fervor."

495
00:33:55,382 --> 00:34:00,950
"The entire district of Theni
houses people as sweet as honey."

496
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:06,287
"If you do something fishy
you'll be in a mess, machi."

497
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:11,740
"Youngsters come and make merry
Pep up with your own brand of mimicry."

498
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:16,847
"Mikes and speakers fixed on the street
Fun and frolic day and night as treat."

499
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:34,434
"Our village head's word we respect
He's the lion of Madurai perfect."

500
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:41,692
Move on Check that jeep.

501
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,113
Stop... stop.

502
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,182
Yov! What's happening here?

503
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,025
- What?
- Aiya's jeep.

504
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:51,791
Will you check even his vehicle?

505
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,172
Sorry, madam
Sorry, sir, you can go.

506
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,434
If outsiders are assigned to duty here
they have no idea which vehicle to check.

507
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,470
Move... move.

508
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:04,540
You saw the respect
your sir commands.

509
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:07,305
Why didn't you open your mouth
and say you're his driver?

510
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,492
Who can help you if you stare blankly
like a child missing in a fair?

511
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,487
We should use our offices
when needed, understood?

512
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:17,097
You've grown vertically
but you don't know to prosper in life.

513
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,823
Go... move on
Gear up your attitude.

514
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,305
Good afternoon, aiya.

515
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,684
- 'Vanakkam', aiya.
- Greetings, bro.

516
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,367
Supervise the canopy being fixed.

517
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:43,170
Rani, give a hand
They are waiting.

518
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:44,822
How long will you be stirring it?

519
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,010
- Wait, Sembaruthi.
- We have to go.

520
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:48,086
'Vanakkam'

521
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:51,964
Get everything ready
before my father arrives.

522
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,654
- Sure, sir.
- Attend to your work.

523
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,382
Look at this! Our driver!

524
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,186
If you need anything else, ask m-

525
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:01,257
- You carry on - Okay, aiya.

526
00:36:02,908 --> 00:36:05,020
Yov! Come here.

527
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,092
- Me?
- Of course you, come here.

528
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:15,004
- What is it?
- Yov! What's happening here?

529
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:18,614
I asked you to draw a small line
You laid a whole long road!

530
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:20,687
The build-up seems too much?

531
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:22,377
What have you told them?

532
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:27,138
Left, right, center, what improvement!
You have people fawning all over you.

533
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:30,633
At this rate, looks like
you'll say you're our aiya's heir!

534
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:34,242
All that's fine, it isn't enough
if we make others run around.

535
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,393
We should also exercise our limbs

536
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:40,578
I have to take this cauldron to the temple
Lend me a hand, to load it into the truck.

537
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:43,382
Yov! What's up with you?
Lend me a hand.

538
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,570
Whom are you asking for help?

539
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:46,953
Do you know who he is?

540
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:49,564
Won't aiya's driver get his hands dirty?

541
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,868
Driver, huh? He's aiya's-

542
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:53,058
Muruga!

543
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,012
Repeat what you said.

544
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:01,084
How can you make
aiya... er... aiya's driver lift this?

545
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:03,503
Both drivers are hand in glove, huh?

546
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,807
Going overboard on your bond, bro.

547
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:09,071
We must work without discrimination
in our temple festival.

548
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,300
Understood?

549
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:14,255
We are holding this conversation
Why are you standing here gawking?

550
00:37:14,294 --> 00:37:16,137
Lift this - You don't

551
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:17,174
I can do it.

552
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:19,016
Why are you preventing him from helping?

553
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:20,630
Is he such a big sho-

554
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:23,471
No... no, it's okay
I can load it for you.

555
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,082
That's better! Both the drivers
lend me a hand now.

556
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,001
- Don't drop it on the ground.
- I'll dump it on your head!

557
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,689
Take that vessel and this bucket.

558
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,145
Good... good.

559
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:36,566
Right... start.

560
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:39,599
Marimuthu anna, ask those boys
to load the rest and bring it.

561
00:37:39,714 --> 00:37:40,714
Alright.

562
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:42,633
Like a cool cucumber...

563
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:44,745
she clicks her finger,
ordering you around?

564
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:46,473
And you're keeping quie-

565
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:49,583
This way, aiya

566
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:50,927
I know, come.

567
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:55,842
Bro.

568
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,569
In a mango grove.

569
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:01,410
Her house Teacher's daughter.

570
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:02,985
Only child.

571
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,135
Stayed with her grandma and studied.

572
00:38:05,174 --> 00:38:07,439
Flunked the 1st time
in the IPS exam.

573
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:11,126
But struts around claiming to be
a policewoman in her own right.

574
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,662
She has come here only now.

575
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,774
That's why she is blissfully
ignorant about you.

576
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:17,500
Why have you unearthed
all these details about her?

577
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:20,764
Someone doesn't know our background.

578
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,414
We should know all about her, right?

579
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,103
- What is her name?
- Her name.

580
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:29,366
You asked him why he found out about her
and you want to know her name now!

581
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:31,593
That girl's name is-

582
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:46,454
He is the fellow
who was rude to your father.

583
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:06,345
Look at his temerity!

584
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:08,726
Shouldn't let him go scot-free
Must teach him a lesson.

585
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,108
Your father stopped us

586
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:13,410
1 swift blow from you
his ears should rip apart.

587
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,254
Yes, aiya - Get into the jeep.

588
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:16,521
Super, aiya.

589
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:20,898
Muruga, get in.

590
00:39:20,937 --> 00:39:23,049
Long time since
we witnessed a proper fight.

591
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:30,652
Oh God! Aiya is here.

592
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:37,256
They are waiting for you at the temple
You're going this way.

593
00:39:37,257 --> 00:39:38,217
Actually-

594
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:40,482
- Come, follow me - Okay.

595
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:02,063
Hey! Look, Sembaruthi has
started her dance.

596
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:54,057
- Get a soda.
- She is rocking, man!

597
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:03,618
Master, why are you sitting here?

598
00:41:03,657 --> 00:41:05,961
- You're missing a bigger show.
- What do you mean?

599
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:09,647
Your daughter is dancing away to glory
The entire village is enjoying it.

600
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:33,839
Sembaruthi, your father is coming
with a stick to bash you up.

601
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:35,759
Escape... great escape!

602
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,713
- Did you see Sembaruthi?
- No, sir.

603
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,441
You said she was dancing here.

604
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,938
Where has she gone?

605
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:45,974
We don't have any idea

606
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,314
I blame her for befriending
over-smart kids like you.

607
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:51,580
Don't move
My father will spot me.

608
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:53,538
She was dancing here
Where is she?

609
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,614
Move left.

610
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,265
Move to your right.

611
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,530
Where did she vanish?

612
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:01,180
I told you I don't know
Why do you sound like a parrot?

613
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:02,447
If I get hold of her

614
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,561
I'll tear her to pieces.

615
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,020
Anyway she has to come home.

616
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:06,441
Master has gone.

617
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,900
He has gone.

618
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:16,502
'Elusive as an eel!'

619
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:22,530
I was looking for you
What are you doing here?

620
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:23,874
Aiya...?

621
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:27,945
- What?
- Nothing, vermillion.

622
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:29,289
Stuck firmly to your back!

623
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,511
Sembaruthi!

624
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:37,199
- What?
- You wanted to know her name.

625
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,812
Sembaruthi!

626
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:46,535
'2nd day of the festival'

627
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:49,800
Check all the police jeeps
near that arch.

628
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:55,560
People from Mudur and Madampatti
proceed towards our deity.

629
00:42:56,943 --> 00:42:59,439
- Ask them to get down from the wall.
- Get down.

630
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,011
Make way for those who have
taken a sacred vow.

631
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,891
Driver, stop for a minute.

632
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:06,235
You came at the right time.

633
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:07,810
This boy got lost in the festival.

634
00:43:07,848 --> 00:43:09,077
He's crying for his parents.

635
00:43:09,115 --> 00:43:11,650
Must hand him over
to the police, let's go.

636
00:43:11,995 --> 00:43:15,259
Sembaruthi, your father
is looking for a groom for you.

637
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:17,256
You're standing here with a kid!

638
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:19,445
I delivered him only yesterday
Get lost, man.

639
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:21,058
Where do they spring from!

640
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:23,477
Now you know how their tongues wag.

641
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:25,204
They won't let us
be a Good Samaritan!

642
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:27,586
Let's go, man - Okay, madam.

643
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:34,191
By the way, I've been
addressing you as 'driver'

644
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:35,343
What's your name?

645
00:43:37,954 --> 00:43:40,219
Driver is good enough.

646
00:43:41,064 --> 00:43:44,520
Ladies, please take care of your jewellery.

647
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:45,787
If there's any problem...

648
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:48,245
please report to
the Police Help Center.

649
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:49,283
'Vanakkam', sir.

650
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,317
Yov! What's happening to our country?!

651
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:53,160
Totally in form, eh?

652
00:43:53,237 --> 00:43:55,656
Each of them competing
to greet you with respect!

653
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,653
Come along.

654
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:00,034
Come.

655
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:02,299
This boy was crying
lost in the crowd.

656
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:03,951
Looks like his family
missed out on him.

657
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,448
Announce his details.

658
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:08,059
Boy's name is Prabhu
Father's name is Dhandapani.

659
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:09,442
Mother's name is Amudha.

660
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,168
'The boy is wearing
a red checked shirt'

661
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:14,818
'Boy's parents-'

662
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:18,235
- You have a decided advantage.
- Why...?

663
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:22,037
If you get lost in a fair, you'll be
easily found towering over everyone.

664
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,415
Where did you go,
my little prince?

665
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,643
I've been looking for you
all over the place.

666
00:44:27,682 --> 00:44:30,946
Aiya, thank you so much
for finding our child for us.

667
00:44:30,984 --> 00:44:32,635
They brought him here.

668
00:44:32,674 --> 00:44:34,517
Thank them instead.

669
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:36,283
Aiya, don't know who your parents are.

670
00:44:36,322 --> 00:44:39,279
Bless you both for
returning my grandson.

671
00:44:39,317 --> 00:44:42,618
Before the next festival, you should also
be blessed with a baby boy like him.

672
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:44,539
And live happily.

673
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:48,456
May you always be happy.

674
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,719
(Song from 'Aadukalam')

675
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,712
Icing on the cake
a situation song as well!

676
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,287
Hello - Huh...?

677
00:44:58,325 --> 00:44:59,707
Why are you laughing?

678
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:02,511
I was amused by what that old lady said.

679
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:04,623
- You are indeed unique!
- Why...?

680
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,888
Go, your owner
may be waiting for you.

681
00:45:06,927 --> 00:45:08,194
Attend to your work.

682
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:09,538
Alright.

683
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,957
Go and educate your children.

684
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:14,376
Some arbitration or the other every day.

685
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,915
How strange!?

686
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:39,797
Fireworks is only on the 4th day.

687
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:41,448
But they've started today.

688
00:45:41,602 --> 00:45:42,869
- What's this?
- True that.

689
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,712
This is new First time.

690
00:45:44,866 --> 00:45:46,594
Seems a break from our custom.

691
00:47:17,755 --> 00:47:19,599
- What happened?
- Don't know.

692
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:20,637
Bring some water.

693
00:47:20,866 --> 00:47:22,747
Aiya, you carry on
We'll take care.

694
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:25,627
Let's go.

695
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:27,125
Watch your step.

696
00:47:29,736 --> 00:47:31,003
Careful.

697
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:34,959
Bring the car.

698
00:47:40,642 --> 00:47:43,983
"Good lord! Here comes the battle rooster."

699
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:47,170
"His blows so strong and swift, I swear."

700
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:50,549
"He can flatten any foe
with just a look from head to toe."

701
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:54,159
"He's a veteran with a sickle
With any weapon he weaves a miracle."

702
00:48:45,115 --> 00:48:46,498
Greetings, aiya.

703
00:48:51,912 --> 00:48:52,949
Come, Anbu.

704
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:56,827
Our village deity
grant all our boons.

705
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:09,039
Greetings, aiya.

706
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:13,186
My dearest wish is to take a selfie
with our junor aiya one day.

707
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:21,019
(Song from 'Thiruvilaiyadal')

708
00:49:32,271 --> 00:49:33,576
Come, Anbu.

709
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:36,571
Accept our sacred vow
we offer with utmost devotion.

710
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:40,527
What shall we play?

711
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,523
Running and catching?

712
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,443
No need, we might get lost.

713
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,555
Then what other game shall we play?

714
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:57,424
Good lord!

715
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,074
Hey, look here.

716
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:02,453
- Has junior aiya started his antics?
- Let's go and check.

717
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,747
You're falling like a chicken's crest

718
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:15,931
I'll close his chapter today.

719
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,646
You can wear a tiger mask
in a temple festival.

720
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,066
But you shouldn't masquerade
in front of a tiger!

721
00:50:28,642 --> 00:50:31,099
My father strikes just like a tiger.

722
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:35,131
But because this is a sacred event
he chose to turn a blind eye!

723
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:38,971
If you even think
of attacking anyone here

724
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,507
you've had it!

725
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:47,995
Let's go.

726
00:50:51,183 --> 00:50:53,640
Aiya, that was so well done.

727
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:56,520
We were waiting all these years
to see you in action!

728
00:50:56,674 --> 00:50:58,939
No one saw you Let's walk away.

729
00:50:59,131 --> 00:51:01,474
- No evidence, right?
- Not even a speck!

730
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:03,087
If we walk together
they will find out.

731
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,469
Let's split up.

732
00:51:04,546 --> 00:51:05,698
Hey Muruga, come.

733
00:51:05,736 --> 00:51:06,965
See you later.

734
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,744
Bro, excellent Give me your hand.

735
00:51:24,783 --> 00:51:26,088
Keep quiet.

736
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,157
Muruga - Aiya.

737
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:35,419
What did he say?

738
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,416
What he said was.

739
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,181
'Do good in all ways
Control your anger always'

740
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:42,523
Tamil poetess Avvaiyar's words.

741
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,635
Rewind it.

742
00:51:46,287 --> 00:51:47,477
Enough, stop.

743
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,319
Play it.

744
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,850
'You can wear a tiger mask
in a temple festival'

745
00:51:54,888 --> 00:51:57,039
'But you shouldn't masquerade
in front of a tiger!'

746
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,189
'My father strikes just like a tiger'

747
00:51:59,227 --> 00:52:01,608
'But because this is a sacred event'

748
00:52:01,992 --> 00:52:03,528
'...he chose to turn a blind eye!'

749
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,101
'If you even think
of attacking anyone here'

750
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,483
'...you've had it!'

751
00:52:11,016 --> 00:52:13,435
Not making fun,
That's how he talks.

752
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:15,701
He imitates your voice too.

753
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:17,698
Even if he went abroad...

754
00:52:17,736 --> 00:52:19,387
how can it miss the genes?

755
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:21,499
A lion will always be a lion.

756
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:24,533
Like a bull raging
from an enclosed space

757
00:52:24,571 --> 00:52:26,261
look at his imposing figure!

758
00:52:26,568 --> 00:52:29,218
Like watching our evergreen hero
MGR's film in a tent theater!

759
00:52:29,256 --> 00:52:30,792
Why did you stop with that?

760
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:34,402
You'll say he stands tall like our deity
connecting our earth and sky!

761
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,784
Add that for effect too!

762
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:38,165
Why bring out the beast in human beings?

763
00:52:38,357 --> 00:52:40,008
Allow humans to be just humane!

764
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,887
- Where is my son?
- Call junior aiya.

765
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,461
Aiya, stop - What...?

766
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,112
Our film is being watched inside.

767
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:49,186
We thought we left no evidence behind.

768
00:52:49,224 --> 00:52:52,450
Like reality show Bigg Boss
cameras have been fixed all over.

769
00:52:52,488 --> 00:52:54,639
Everyone is waiting for you
Let's go inside.

770
00:52:54,677 --> 00:52:55,714
Hurry up.

771
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,311
Why do you want
to get involved in this?

772
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:08,885
No, aiya.

773
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,458
Suddenly they tied a towel
round his neck and lifted him.

774
00:53:11,957 --> 00:53:15,183
Did you think we were just
hanging around after the rituals?

775
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:17,794
The moment we decided
to hold the festival...

776
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:20,021
that very same day
we covered all the areas.

777
00:53:20,098 --> 00:53:22,248
We fixed cameras
and appointed people.

778
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:24,360
Do you know what happened
when you butted in?

779
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:25,399
Play it.

780
00:53:34,306 --> 00:53:35,496
Did you see that?

781
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:36,840
Come here.

782
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:43,637
We would have caught all of them.

783
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:45,672
We would've known
all the details

784
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:49,051
of their accomplices, out-of-towners
and the local hands involved.

785
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:50,971
You barged in and messed it up

786
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,315
I was just trying to be help-

787
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,850
No need, don't interfere
We can handle this.

788
00:53:54,888 --> 00:53:56,424
This is a long drawn out feud

789
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:59,573
I'm hoping to end it
at least this time, once for all

790
00:54:00,379 --> 00:54:03,144
I've taken a vow to put an end to this
even if I sacrifice my life.

791
00:54:04,027 --> 00:54:06,447
As my son will you support me?

792
00:54:07,138 --> 00:54:08,290
Of course, aiya.

793
00:54:25,378 --> 00:54:30,523
"The sun and his son stride side by side."

794
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:35,669
"To shine on the poor and the deprived."

795
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:40,738
"They stand as identity
to bravery and dignity."

796
00:54:40,776 --> 00:54:45,461
"Praised sky high is their generosity."

797
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:51,144
"If their word, once they have uttered
they'll forsake their lives, rest assured."

798
00:54:51,183 --> 00:54:55,752
"If father and son draw a line explicitly
the entire village will obey implicitly."

799
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:57,634
When aiya and son
walk side by side

800
00:54:57,672 --> 00:55:00,053
they look like our village deity
and our guardian deity.

801
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:02,587
Isn't that only natural?
What do you expect from his heir?

802
00:55:02,626 --> 00:55:07,387
"Clasp your hands and bow with love
Forever and a day, not only for now."

803
00:55:13,992 --> 00:55:18,869
"The sun and his son stride side by side"

804
00:55:18,907 --> 00:55:21,403
'Both the drivers
lend me a hand now'

805
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,322
'If you get lost in a fair, you'll be
easily found towering over everyone'

806
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:29,467
"They stand as identity
to bravery and dignity."

807
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:32,232
"Praised sky high is their generosity."

808
00:55:33,922 --> 00:55:36,379
Hey Sembaruthi Come and join us.

809
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:38,223
- Show off your steps!
- Get lost.

810
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:39,874
Okay, forget it
Let's dance, boys.

811
00:55:39,912 --> 00:55:41,256
Come, bro Dance with us.

812
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,639
Carry on, boys.

813
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:44,405
'Vanakkam'

814
00:55:44,443 --> 00:55:47,707
Your friends are living it up
Aren't you joining them?

815
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:50,357
At the moment I'm shell shocked!

816
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:51,931
- Adding fuel!
- Why...?

817
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,045
What happened?

818
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,773
Standing like a drenched chicken!

819
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:57,154
Why did you lie to me
saying you're the driver?

820
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:58,075
Oh that!

821
00:55:58,114 --> 00:55:59,419
You asked, I answered.

822
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,032
Why get upset for that?

823
00:56:01,339 --> 00:56:03,451
Big deal! What logic!!

824
00:56:03,797 --> 00:56:05,832
Do you know how many
castles in the air I built?!

825
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:08,482
A driver... will listen to me.

826
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,248
He will be paid a salary every month.

827
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,106
He will bargain and
buy jasmine for my head.

828
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,088
Watch a late night movie
in Periyakulam.

829
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:16,199
With the wind on my face
watch the moon.

830
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,659
Hugging you close on a bike.

831
00:56:17,928 --> 00:56:20,002
You know how far
I travelled with you!

832
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:22,557
Out of the blue I find out
you're aiya's son, how will I feel?

833
00:56:24,072 --> 00:56:27,032
Feels like I went a couple of rounds
on the giant wheel and got down dizzy.

834
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,523
Now I know why men drown
in alcohol when their love fails!

835
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,016
I'm hopping mad now
I might abuse you verbally.

836
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:37,359
Don't show up before me
for the next 2 days... go.

837
00:56:37,551 --> 00:56:39,163
Let me try to explai-

838
00:56:39,202 --> 00:56:40,738
You heard me? Just go away.

839
00:56:42,581 --> 00:56:43,848
Towering over me!

840
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:09,423
Move aside.

841
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,951
Hey, told you not to show up
for the next couple of days.

842
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:18,907
- Then why are you here?
- I didn't come on my own.

843
00:57:18,946 --> 00:57:20,482
God brought us together.

844
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:22,634
Listen.

845
00:57:23,285 --> 00:57:26,549
In a way it turned out well
I lied to you I was a driver.

846
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:30,043
If I had told you who I really was
you wouldn't have flipped for me.

847
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:31,349
Why...?

848
00:57:31,426 --> 00:57:33,768
Shouldn't aiya's son bargain
and buy jasmine for you?

849
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:37,416
Can't we catch a late night show
in Periyakulam, riding a bike?

850
00:57:39,144 --> 00:57:41,218
Hey, do you know something?

851
00:57:41,448 --> 00:57:44,328
The other day that old lady
adorned my forehead with 'kumkum'

852
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:46,709
You know how long
I made sure it wasn't erased?

853
00:57:55,311 --> 00:57:58,191
I'll travel any number of miles for you.

854
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:00,648
I will do anything.

855
00:58:11,285 --> 00:58:16,354
"O' girl from Kambam village in Theni
You slice me with your eyes splintery."

856
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:21,423
"Like our gale spiralling dust all around
you lift me high from the ground."

857
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:26,568
"Hey! Leaf from the banyan tree
Nestle in her dimple carefree."

858
00:58:26,645 --> 00:58:30,984
"Her plaits are like a snake twirling
Wants to touch me, she is such a darling."

859
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:32,023
"Wow! What a feeling!"

860
00:58:32,098 --> 00:58:36,475
"Like the colored coolers in the festival
don't send me into a dizzy spell as well."

861
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:41,659
"Don't untie the tethered goat, true blue
making him graze in pastures green and new."

862
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:46,959
"Get lost, girlie, I can't even think
All night through I haven't slept a wink."

863
00:58:47,035 --> 00:58:49,300
"Kambam lassie."

864
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:51,490
"Awesome missy."

865
00:58:51,912 --> 00:58:57,327
"O' girl from Kambam village in Theni
You chop me with your eyes splintery."

866
00:58:57,365 --> 00:59:02,357
"Like our gale spiralling dust all around
you lift me high from the ground."

867
00:59:28,507 --> 00:59:33,690
"Adolescent scent of your half sari
Adds pep to my breath, dearie."

868
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:38,530
"Words you spoke seemed so sugary."

869
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:43,752
"You grind me into a 'chutney'
Charm me and captivate me."

870
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:48,475
"Lightning reflects in your eyes bright
You flash in me electric waves of delight."

871
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:53,314
"Like candy watch clinging to the wrist
you hugged me tight, my dearest."

872
00:59:53,352 --> 00:59:58,727
"Like the stain from an ice Popsicle
you stuck to my shirt inseparable."

873
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:03,797
"Like a cup of black coffee
you make my mind zippy."

874
01:00:03,912 --> 01:00:06,370
"Kambam cutie."

875
01:00:06,408 --> 01:00:08,904
"Blossoming beauty."

876
01:00:19,656 --> 01:00:24,571
"Like a giant wheel you take me high
Make me swing right up to the sky"

877
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:29,679
"I think, I swallow, I try to talk
Words don't spill out, I simply gawk."

878
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:34,747
"Your hands speak eloquently
Your eyes invite me silently."

879
01:00:34,824 --> 01:00:39,586
"Like the 'jumki' in your ear
you make my mind dangle, dear"

880
01:00:39,624 --> 01:00:44,424
"2 pink cotton candies you stole, honey
Fashioned them as rosy cheeks satiny."

881
01:00:44,463 --> 01:00:49,800
"You got the winged termite's gossamer wing
Stitched it on to my heart so endearing."

882
01:00:49,877 --> 01:00:54,907
"My darling, my life's meaning
I whisper your name in the wind."

883
01:00:54,946 --> 01:00:56,751
"Kambam's treasure trove."

884
01:00:57,096 --> 01:00:59,477
"My one and only love."

885
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:05,237
"O' girl from Kambam village in Theni
You slice me with your eyes splintery."

886
01:01:05,275 --> 01:01:10,383
"Like our gale spiralling dust all around
you lift me high from the ground."

887
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:14,645
"Kambam cutie."

888
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:20,059
"Soul-find sweetie."

889
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:24,821
"Kambam lassie."

890
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:27,663
"Awesome missy."

891
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,693
- How was the exam?
- Paper was very easy.

892
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:33,610
Let's go up the giant wheel.

893
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:35,109
It will give a sooper high.

894
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:42,519
Hey! What happened?

895
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,056
Get hold of him.

896
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,976
Nab that kid
Don't let him escape.

897
01:01:46,053 --> 01:01:48,394
Get that kid - What happened?

898
01:01:48,395 --> 01:01:51,198
There he is - Catch him.

899
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:55,845
Aiya...?

900
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:57,189
Let go of him.

901
01:01:59,224 --> 01:02:00,491
Remove your hand.

902
01:02:02,142 --> 01:02:03,602
Relax, don't worry.

903
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:07,902
Enough

904
01:02:08,018 --> 01:02:09,208
I'm fine, aiya.

905
01:02:09,362 --> 01:02:11,090
How can he attack you?

906
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:12,242
Aiya, we can't ignore this.

907
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,624
We must do something.

908
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:16,427
Whom do you want me to fight?

909
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:18,386
He isn't even as tall as a machete!

910
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,958
They've given a weapon
to an innocent boy.

911
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:23,877
Poison has seeped
all the way down to the root.

912
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:26,949
Even if 10 villages oppose us
we can combat them.

913
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,941
Do you want me to fight against
a vulnerable lady and an innocent boy?

914
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,243
They can come in any form.

915
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,701
- We should only be very careful.
- Okay, aiya.

916
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:39,198
- Is it understood?
- Sure, aiya.

917
01:02:39,928 --> 01:02:42,347
I slashed across his body
I scarred him

918
01:02:42,501 --> 01:02:43,730
I scarred him for life, ma.

919
01:02:43,768 --> 01:02:44,805
He was standing, okay?

920
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:46,456
One swift slash on his stomach.

921
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:47,915
Look how he bled!

922
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:49,374
Look, ma... blood!

923
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:55,288
Saw my son's guts?

924
01:02:55,749 --> 01:02:57,016
Showed me blood.

925
01:02:57,438 --> 01:02:59,051
You men standing here.

926
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:00,894
This small kid has drawn out blood.

927
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:03,851
You made a big fuss saying
there were too many people around.

928
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,426
And you can't go near them.

929
01:03:06,424 --> 01:03:09,650
Do we have to wait for him to grow up
to avenge his father's death?

930
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:13,835
You sleep with your wife every night

931
01:03:14,142 --> 01:03:16,178
I am a lone woman.

932
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:21,170
I have been waiting patiently
3 days since the festival started.

933
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,128
Are you simply watching all the fun?

934
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,584
That sound is continuously haunting me.

935
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:29,157
Don't give me any excuse.

936
01:03:29,195 --> 01:03:30,539
He MUST die!

937
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:31,730
Pechi, listen to-

938
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:34,149
Pechi's word is final
I don't need a back answer.

939
01:03:35,032 --> 01:03:37,912
Are you scared you swore
on milk we consider sacred?

940
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:40,485
Don't give me any flimsy reason.

941
01:03:40,677 --> 01:03:41,982
That's all I can say.

942
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:43,866
Come.

943
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:08,670
Hey, who is it?

944
01:04:08,901 --> 01:04:10,206
Is it raining?

945
01:04:10,898 --> 01:04:13,778
- Go and check.
- Search every corner.

946
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:19,384
Aiya - You study, my dear boy.

947
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:23,915
I heard some sound.

948
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,677
We'll take care You go to bed.

949
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:31,134
Okay, aiya - Leave that behind.

950
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:32,862
Shine the light.

951
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:34,974
Take the light and search properly.

952
01:04:35,896 --> 01:04:37,376
Tell them to search around the house.

953
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:40,235
- Did anyone get caught?
- No one here.

954
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,077
If anyone gets caught,
I'll drill into your Adam's apple!

955
01:04:45,227 --> 01:04:46,533
How did you get here?

956
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:48,107
I'm just unable to sleep.

957
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:50,219
How are you able to sleep?

958
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:52,638
You said you'll walk
countless miles for me?

959
01:04:52,677 --> 01:04:54,597
But you're sleeping
covered to your chin!

960
01:04:54,635 --> 01:04:56,978
Someone is coming Come this side.

961
01:04:57,016 --> 01:04:58,091
Come here.

962
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:01,163
I can only see you
wherever I turn!

963
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,123
What...?

964
01:05:02,162 --> 01:05:03,851
Whispering romantically, right?

965
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:06,385
Look at my eyes Can't you see?

966
01:05:06,386 --> 01:05:08,152
Can't you see your reflection there?

967
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,379
Switch on all the lights.

968
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,067
Leave no stone unturned.

969
01:05:19,365 --> 01:05:20,978
Come... come... this way.

970
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,474
Go that side and check.

971
01:05:22,475 --> 01:05:23,858
How could you do this?

972
01:05:23,896 --> 01:05:25,010
Go home right now

973
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,966
I was footloose and fancy-free
What did you do to me?

974
01:05:28,005 --> 01:05:29,618
Who is it?

975
01:05:29,656 --> 01:05:31,806
If you get caught
I'll string your intestines out.

976
01:05:31,883 --> 01:05:33,650
Road looks zig-zag to me!

977
01:05:34,955 --> 01:05:36,760
I'm standing alone
and talking to myself!

978
01:05:37,835 --> 01:05:40,024
You said it's God's will
and went away coolly

979
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:43,058
- I'm the one who feels possessed.
- Who is that intruder?

980
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:47,666
Have you gone mad?

981
01:05:48,203 --> 01:05:49,854
You'll get caught.

982
01:05:51,275 --> 01:05:53,925
- Search all around the house.
- 'We are on the job'

983
01:05:54,002 --> 01:05:55,269
'Search in the backyard'

984
01:05:55,307 --> 01:05:56,997
'There's no one this side'

985
01:05:57,035 --> 01:05:58,533
Go that side... go.

986
01:05:58,686 --> 01:06:01,144
Do you have so many servants
at your beck and call?

987
01:06:01,182 --> 01:06:02,642
As if that math is important now.

988
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,638
If they see you
they will rip you apart

989
01:06:04,677 --> 01:06:06,750
I have taken a police training course

990
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:08,029
I'll go in the blink of an eye.

991
01:06:08,056 --> 01:06:10,245
You broke in like a thief
and call yourself a cop?

992
01:06:10,398 --> 01:06:12,779
1st leave this place
Go... go... now.

993
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:14,776
Hurry up Didn't you hear me?

994
01:06:14,814 --> 01:06:16,082
Go...!

995
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:21,035
Bye.

996
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:27,371
Aren't we going to the temple?

997
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,674
- Drive, I'll tell you.
- Okay, aiya.

998
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:32,325
By the way, who is that girl?

999
01:06:32,402 --> 01:06:34,437
Who, aiya? Which girl?

1000
01:06:34,744 --> 01:06:37,086
You chaperone them
in the festival all the time

1001
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,661
I am aware of everything.

1002
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:39,506
Tell me.

1003
01:06:39,544 --> 01:06:41,426
Aiya saw action + romance, huh?

1004
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,654
Our teacher's daughter.

1005
01:06:42,693 --> 01:06:43,768
Sembaruthi.

1006
01:06:43,806 --> 01:06:45,419
Her house is in a mango grove.

1007
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:48,798
- Drive straight to her house.
- What, aiya?

1008
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:50,794
I said drive straight
to that girl's house.

1009
01:06:50,795 --> 01:06:51,795
Okay, aiya.

1010
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:56,440
Aiya, look over there.

1011
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:59,742
The wheelie expert
wheeling away to glory.

1012
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:00,781
That's the girl.

1013
01:07:05,003 --> 01:07:06,309
Hold on tight.

1014
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,072
A feeling of flying in mid air, eh?

1015
01:07:21,016 --> 01:07:22,706
Pull up to one side.

1016
01:07:25,163 --> 01:07:28,312
- Saw how we lifted the bike!
- Super, Sembaruthi.

1017
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,226
Why are you standing here?

1018
01:07:34,302 --> 01:07:36,491
Problem with your jeep?
Come, I'll drop you.

1019
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:38,296
But you'll ride only on 1 wheel!

1020
01:07:38,795 --> 01:07:41,675
If you're riding pillion
my 2 wheeler will behave itself!

1021
01:07:41,906 --> 01:07:43,058
Dai, get down.

1022
01:07:43,096 --> 01:07:44,862
Go home now
Loitering around always.

1023
01:07:44,901 --> 01:07:46,129
Okay, you go home.

1024
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,589
Aiya, you on a 2 wheeler?

1025
01:07:47,627 --> 01:07:50,430
Hello... I definitely do
a better job than you!

1026
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:52,158
Jack in the box!

1027
01:07:53,733 --> 01:07:56,229
Aiya, to your house, right?
Shall I take the short cut?

1028
01:07:56,267 --> 01:07:58,533
- You take the straight route, dear.
- Okay, aiya.

1029
01:07:58,802 --> 01:08:00,798
Aiya, is this speed okay
or should I go faster?

1030
01:08:00,837 --> 01:08:02,373
Everything is fine, dear.

1031
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:05,406
Selvi akka, how are you?

1032
01:08:05,445 --> 01:08:08,171
Not as if you didn't see me
You bought flowers this morning.

1033
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,053
Did you see who is seated behind?

1034
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,397
Greetings, aiya.

1035
01:08:11,435 --> 01:08:12,435
'Vanakkam'

1036
01:08:12,626 --> 01:08:14,968
Why are you announcing
to the whole village?

1037
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:17,118
You riding pillion
is rewriting history, aiya!

1038
01:08:17,157 --> 01:08:18,424
Shouldn't I archive it?

1039
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:20,229
If I show off
it adds to my value.

1040
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:24,222
Stop the bike near that tree, dear.

1041
01:08:24,722 --> 01:08:25,528
Okay, aiya.

1042
01:08:25,566 --> 01:08:27,256
Aiya found out everything.

1043
01:08:27,294 --> 01:08:29,138
He's riding with that girl now.

1044
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:31,173
- Ask him to come soon.
- I'm telling him.

1045
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:33,438
Are you really far away?
I can't hear yo-

1046
01:08:33,515 --> 01:08:34,515
Aiya?

1047
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:37,163
- How did you come in a jiffy?
- Which way did they go?

1048
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:39,045
Via Nadupatti - Go fast.

1049
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:40,083
Go.

1050
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:44,190
Why did you ask me to stop here?

1051
01:08:44,344 --> 01:08:46,571
- I came only to talk to you.
- To me?

1052
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,568
If I had known
I would've come myself.

1053
01:08:48,606 --> 01:08:49,682
That's fine, dear

1054
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:54,827
7 years ago...

1055
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:57,362
a girl walked into my son's life

1056
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:59,358
I don't know who jinxed it.

1057
01:09:02,315 --> 01:09:03,966
We were not fortunate.

1058
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:13,221
After that...

1059
01:09:13,298 --> 01:09:17,406
I requested him many times
to find a suitable bride.

1060
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,710
He had no place in his heart
for any other girl.

1061
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,360
He likes you very much.

1062
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:24,933
I approve totally I'm very happy.

1063
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,386
Hereafter you don't have to
jump in through our tiled roof.

1064
01:09:30,424 --> 01:09:32,459
You can walk in
through the main door!

1065
01:09:36,184 --> 01:09:38,565
I'll meet your father
formally tomorrow.

1066
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:40,446
So you can marry my son, okay?

1067
01:09:45,323 --> 01:09:48,510
You sprung this out of the blue
How will my father believe me?

1068
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:50,314
I'll call him now
Will you talk to him?

1069
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:51,621
Let him not believe you

1070
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:53,502
I'll surprise him
Let it be a suspense.

1071
01:10:11,013 --> 01:10:13,048
Where is aiya? What did he say?

1072
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:15,813
Tell me.

1073
01:10:16,197 --> 01:10:19,114
Hey, I'm asking you
What is that weird click?

1074
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:20,690
Tell me the conversation verbatim.

1075
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:22,378
Tomorrow - Tomorrow...?

1076
01:10:22,379 --> 01:10:24,683
He'll pay a formal visit
to meet my father.

1077
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:27,371
And ask for my hand
in marriage to you.

1078
01:10:34,974 --> 01:10:36,472
Karuppu, has aiya come for lunch?

1079
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:37,815
Not yet, he went-

1080
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,275
Aiya has gone out.

1081
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:40,542
Who is with him?

1082
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:41,618
Uncle has gone with him.

1083
01:10:41,656 --> 01:10:42,846
Oh! Okay.

1084
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:48,683
They told me you were with
my father but you are here?

1085
01:10:48,722 --> 01:10:51,448
Aiya sent me to discuss about
the chariot for the 4th day.

1086
01:10:51,486 --> 01:10:53,982
All your replies differ!
Nobody went with him?

1087
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:55,557
Don't know, bro.

1088
01:11:00,011 --> 01:11:01,086
What is it?

1089
01:11:02,046 --> 01:11:03,390
Where are you?

1090
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:05,080
Anbu has become a collector.

1091
01:11:05,118 --> 01:11:06,539
He has got the official order

1092
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:08,920
I wanted to share this good news
with his mother.

1093
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:11,301
She will feel happy
to bless him, right?

1094
01:11:11,378 --> 01:11:12,798
That's why I'm taking him there

1095
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,717
I called because I heard
no one is with you.

1096
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:17,368
Why do I need someone with me?

1097
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,365
Anbu, careful!

1098
01:11:21,246 --> 01:11:22,322
Aiya?

1099
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:24,395
Hello...? Aiya!

1100
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:28,120
Someone hit aiya's jeep
and zipped away.

1101
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,424
Aiya, what happened?

1102
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:33,650
- Are you okay, aiya?
- I'm fine.

1103
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:35,570
- What about you?
- I'm fine too

1104
01:11:35,608 --> 01:11:37,643
I am fine No need to be alarmed.

1105
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,755
- Get down slowly.
- Nothing to worry

1106
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,598
1st get that car - Wait.

1107
01:11:41,675 --> 01:11:43,173
Hey, let go of him.

1108
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:44,478
Hey, come here.

1109
01:11:44,517 --> 01:11:46,667
- Hope you aren't hurt.
- This was just an accident.

1110
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,394
Don't magnify it Understood?

1111
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:50,930
- You're bleeding, on your forehead.
- I'm fine, please go.

1112
01:11:50,968 --> 01:11:52,581
Attend to your work.

1113
01:11:52,658 --> 01:11:54,846
Go... let's go - Okay, aiya.

1114
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:57,227
They drove so rash and
collided into aiya's jeep.

1115
01:12:09,477 --> 01:12:10,821
Stop the jeep.

1116
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:28,638
You stay in here.

1117
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,867
Don't get down.

1118
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,979
You there Aiya's son?

1119
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:24,011
You seem to be going somewhere
in a tearing hurry, come on.

1120
01:13:24,626 --> 01:13:26,546
Let's play a small game
before you go.

1121
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:33,994
Haven't you heard of
eye for an eye?

1122
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:35,915
Come, let's settle accounts

1123
01:13:36,222 --> 01:13:37,989
I'll hit you first today.

1124
01:13:38,334 --> 01:13:40,523
Hey, hold him.

1125
01:13:52,734 --> 01:13:54,578
Today is doomsday for all of you.

1126
01:13:55,614 --> 01:13:57,957
By this time they would
have killed Anbu over there.

1127
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,867
If your father had intervened
he would be dead too.

1128
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:41,848
Your mother will be waiting
You carry on.

1129
01:14:41,886 --> 01:14:43,730
Tell her I need to arbitrate
a pressing issue

1130
01:14:43,768 --> 01:14:45,189
I'll attend to it and come.

1131
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:29,118
Didn't you hear me?
Leave right away

1132
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,846
I won't desert you, aiya.

1133
01:16:06,635 --> 01:16:07,635
I told you to go.

1134
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,168
- How can I leave you and go?
- Drive away right now.

1135
01:16:46,878 --> 01:16:48,376
Hey! All of you, run

1136
01:16:48,414 --> 01:16:49,950
I slashed aiya by mistake.

1137
01:16:49,989 --> 01:16:52,408
- Run for your life.
- What have you done?

1138
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:58,322
'Escape'

1139
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:17,598
"A lineage whose word is gospel."

1140
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:21,170
Aiya!

1141
01:17:22,782 --> 01:17:24,357
Aiya... aiya!

1142
01:17:26,853 --> 01:17:27,928
AIYA!

1143
01:17:27,966 --> 01:17:32,958
"Stands now losing its magic spell."

1144
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:34,840
What happened, aiya?

1145
01:17:34,878 --> 01:17:37,490
Dai, who did this?

1146
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:45,362
Dai, come on Face me now.

1147
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,936
Who hacked my father?

1148
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:51,006
"Aiya, our hearts skip a beat, fidgety."

1149
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:54,078
Don't do that.

1150
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:56,843
What is this, aiya?

1151
01:17:57,227 --> 01:18:00,837
Only you should shoulder
all the responsibilities hereafter.

1152
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,141
After seeing you bleed
so much, how can I?

1153
01:18:04,216 --> 01:18:05,944
There shouldn't be any problem.

1154
01:18:07,403 --> 01:18:09,131
This festival...

1155
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:11,973
I've given my word
I'll conduct it come what may.

1156
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:17,387
That drum beat
which you hear in the distance

1157
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,384
don't stop it, my son.

1158
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:25,682
That drumbeat we can hear now

1159
01:18:25,758 --> 01:18:27,218
should always resonate.

1160
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:30,866
My heartbeat echoes
in the beat of those drums.

1161
01:18:31,787 --> 01:18:33,131
Aiya... aiya.

1162
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,627
Nothing will happen to you, aiya.

1163
01:19:16,062 --> 01:19:17,483
Bro, we got him.

1164
01:19:17,522 --> 01:19:19,365
Will we let go of
the hit and run driver?

1165
01:19:19,403 --> 01:19:21,861
They are from Madras
Drunk and driving.

1166
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:24,587
Must have done it
unknowingly, let him go.

1167
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,277
How can you say it so easily?

1168
01:19:26,315 --> 01:19:28,235
You should have seen
aiya's forehead bleed

1169
01:19:33,342 --> 01:19:34,533
I'm telling you, right?

1170
01:19:35,685 --> 01:19:37,989
We don't need to rake up
fresh problems, let him go.

1171
01:19:38,027 --> 01:19:40,446
- Bro, I'll kill them.
- Told you to let them go.

1172
01:19:45,362 --> 01:19:47,742
Next 4 days of our festival
is our only priority.

1173
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:51,275
Aiya has repeatedly said not
to use weapons under any pretext.

1174
01:19:52,312 --> 01:19:54,232
Throw down your weapons.

1175
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:56,229
Attend to the festival requirements.

1176
01:19:56,267 --> 01:19:56,920
GO!

1177
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,762
We should comply with aiya's wishes.

1178
01:20:00,107 --> 01:20:01,720
All of you, disperse.

1179
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,254
'Thank your stars you escaped
by the skin of your teeth!'

1180
01:20:15,014 --> 01:20:17,664
Bloody drunkard!
Who asked you to do this?

1181
01:20:17,702 --> 01:20:19,161
What a catastrophe!

1182
01:20:19,238 --> 01:20:20,429
Height of stupidity!

1183
01:20:20,467 --> 01:20:22,118
Hey, you junk of a jerk!

1184
01:20:22,195 --> 01:20:25,229
You've slashed aiya!
Entire village will hound you.

1185
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:26,995
Have you gone mad?

1186
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,184
You've committed a blunder
A grave blunder.

1187
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:30,374
It was a mistake, bro

1188
01:20:30,413 --> 01:20:31,573
I'll stamp your Adam's apple.

1189
01:20:31,641 --> 01:20:33,523
Show it in action, kill him.

1190
01:20:33,561 --> 01:20:35,328
Whining since you got back!

1191
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:38,016
Why are all of you
scared to death?

1192
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:41,395
This fear is the reason

1193
01:20:41,433 --> 01:20:44,275
for not fulfilling my vow
and killing by mistake.

1194
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,464
You are armed with
machete and sticks, right?

1195
01:20:47,078 --> 01:20:49,344
The issue is not how many
of our men we will lose.

1196
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:51,878
It's about how many
of their men die before he's killed!

1197
01:20:52,032 --> 01:20:53,683
Dai, come here.

1198
01:20:57,907 --> 01:20:59,213
Even if all of us die...

1199
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:02,323
to take revenge on those who killed
his father, he needs to be alive.

1200
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:03,899
Come.

1201
01:21:04,128 --> 01:21:05,203
Take him with you.

1202
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,349
How can you send your only son?!

1203
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:12,998
- How will he sleep without you?
- Let them come.

1204
01:21:14,189 --> 01:21:16,147
I don't care how many
Let them come.

1205
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,254
Go fast.

1206
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:27,360
That's the house.

1207
01:21:43,795 --> 01:21:47,251
None of them in that village
should breathe, let's all leave.

1208
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:49,325
Who is shutting all the doors?

1209
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:50,976
Who is that? Open the door.

1210
01:21:51,014 --> 01:21:52,973
Open the door.

1211
01:21:57,581 --> 01:22:00,307
Is all this your doing?
You're interfering in our plan

1212
01:22:00,345 --> 01:22:01,689
1st put the sickle down.

1213
01:22:01,728 --> 01:22:02,765
What are you saying?

1214
01:22:02,803 --> 01:22:04,301
They have tried to kill our aiya.

1215
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,336
Shouldn't we kill all of them?

1216
01:22:06,374 --> 01:22:07,872
You are stopping us.

1217
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:10,713
No one should know
aiya's present plight

1218
01:22:10,905 --> 01:22:13,017
I've given my word to him
the festival will go on.

1219
01:22:13,056 --> 01:22:15,283
Who cares about the festival?
Aiya is our God.

1220
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:17,587
He's the deity for our clan
They have harmed him.

1221
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:19,085
You want us to keep quiet?

1222
01:22:19,123 --> 01:22:20,889
Give us way - Stop it!

1223
01:22:22,464 --> 01:22:26,381
We taught you to fight!
Are you selling salt to the sea?

1224
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:28,685
Even if it's aiya's son
who is interfering

1225
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:30,029
we care two hoots.

1226
01:22:30,067 --> 01:22:31,411
We'll go ahead with our mission.

1227
01:22:31,449 --> 01:22:33,523
Even if it's my own uncles who oppose.

1228
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,136
I won't care two hoots either!

1229
01:22:35,174 --> 01:22:36,595
Have you already decided?

1230
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:39,321
- Let's fight it out.
- Come... come on.

1231
01:22:39,398 --> 01:22:42,125
Come... come Let's see who wins.

1232
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,253
This is why I objected.

1233
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:00,096
Did you listen to me?

1234
01:23:01,325 --> 01:23:03,245
What I did was wrong
Please get up.

1235
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:14,841
Must check his BP - Will do.

1236
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,070
What's that sound?

1237
01:23:16,109 --> 01:23:18,067
It is another kind of treatment.

1238
01:23:18,105 --> 01:23:19,296
What?

1239
01:23:19,334 --> 01:23:21,446
You'll get 2 more patients
in another 10 minutes.

1240
01:23:21,485 --> 01:23:22,867
You go wait there.

1241
01:23:22,905 --> 01:23:24,365
Go... go.

1242
01:23:24,595 --> 01:23:27,552
- Did you get it?
- Not a word!

1243
01:23:38,803 --> 01:23:41,606
We shouldn't tell anyone
an attempt was made on aiya's life.

1244
01:23:41,645 --> 01:23:44,563
But the uncles have been
thrashed brutally.

1245
01:23:44,601 --> 01:23:46,905
Why can't we tell even that to anyone?

1246
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:49,632
Hey fool, it is his handiwork!

1247
01:23:51,629 --> 01:23:54,278
Ask everyone in the house
to assemble upstairs.

1248
01:23:57,504 --> 01:23:59,270
Aiyaiyo... aiya!

1249
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:05,069
What happened to aiya?

1250
01:24:17,587 --> 01:24:19,046
Brother...!

1251
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:27,840
Each and every soul here...

1252
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:32,525
for generations you have
been working in this house.

1253
01:24:33,177 --> 01:24:34,214
Your loyalty...

1254
01:24:34,253 --> 01:24:36,019
the way you respect this family.

1255
01:24:36,057 --> 01:24:37,286
I am fully aware.

1256
01:24:38,745 --> 01:24:41,625
We haven't discriminated
your secrets from ours.

1257
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:44,083
That's why I called all of you here.

1258
01:24:45,811 --> 01:24:49,651
People outside shouldn't know
something like this has happened to aiya.

1259
01:24:49,689 --> 01:24:51,494
That's why he is being treated at home.

1260
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:55,910
When people saw a few drops of blood
on his forehead they panicked.

1261
01:24:56,486 --> 01:24:57,486
Now...

1262
01:24:57,523 --> 01:24:59,750
if people get to know
he was slashed

1263
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:03,744
we won't know how many villages will go
up in flames or how many heads will roll.

1264
01:25:05,241 --> 01:25:06,969
To douse the fire
already burning...

1265
01:25:07,008 --> 01:25:08,544
Aiya struggled this much.

1266
01:25:08,813 --> 01:25:10,809
He shouldn't become an excuse.

1267
01:25:11,385 --> 01:25:12,998
To start another feud!

1268
01:25:14,265 --> 01:25:16,185
That drum beat will not be stopped.

1269
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,835
This is my promise to aiya.

1270
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:21,485
This is a sacred vow.

1271
01:25:23,136 --> 01:25:26,169
For this festival to go on without a hitch
this is our combined vow.

1272
01:25:27,283 --> 01:25:28,781
This is like a penance.

1273
01:25:29,741 --> 01:25:33,734
Through your body language and speech
this news shouldn't leak out inadvertently.

1274
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:38,457
Routine work in this house
should go on as usual.

1275
01:25:38,496 --> 01:25:40,761
Don't stop anything
because he's unconscious.

1276
01:25:42,297 --> 01:25:43,417
Aiya is always there for us.

1277
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:45,523
He is fine.

1278
01:25:46,982 --> 01:25:48,941
Very soon he'll come out of this.

1279
01:25:50,285 --> 01:25:51,782
As his son, I believe this.

1280
01:25:54,086 --> 01:25:55,661
You should also believe the same.

1281
01:25:56,966 --> 01:25:59,577
If a thorn pierces a lion,
it will hop for a couple of days.

1282
01:26:00,153 --> 01:26:01,920
After that it will walk normally.

1283
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:12,902
Bro, the festival is
being held as usual.

1284
01:26:12,941 --> 01:26:15,245
There's no sign of that incident.

1285
01:26:15,283 --> 01:26:17,625
What are you saying?
Did you check properly?

1286
01:26:17,664 --> 01:26:19,507
Yes, bro, I'm right here.

1287
01:26:22,387 --> 01:26:26,803
Sister-in-law, it seems the festival
is being held without any hitch.

1288
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:32,256
That's impossible

1289
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:34,560
I slashed him
with this very same hand.

1290
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,365
The force with which I slashed him

1291
01:26:36,403 --> 01:26:38,361
there's no way he can be alive!

1292
01:26:38,669 --> 01:26:39,936
Please trust me.

1293
01:26:45,811 --> 01:26:47,731
- Please sit down.
- Is my daughter ready?

1294
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:50,534
She's been ready since morning
and pacing up and down.

1295
01:26:50,841 --> 01:26:54,029
If any groom came to see her
she would be stuck inside the house.

1296
01:26:54,067 --> 01:26:56,985
In fact she got ready by herself
and is happily waiting.

1297
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,099
'You look beautiful'

1298
01:26:58,253 --> 01:26:59,635
My dear - Keep quiet.

1299
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,056
Are you sure he will come?

1300
01:27:01,555 --> 01:27:04,051
Believing you,
I've invited the entire village

1301
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:05,741
I'm really perturbed.

1302
01:27:05,779 --> 01:27:07,046
What are you saying, pa?

1303
01:27:07,085 --> 01:27:09,657
He gave his word, right?
'Let it be a suspense'

1304
01:27:09,696 --> 01:27:11,001
How will he not come?

1305
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,576
Will he go back on his word?

1306
01:27:12,614 --> 01:27:13,881
'I can see their car'

1307
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,187
I told you, right?

1308
01:27:15,955 --> 01:27:17,645
You wait here
I'll go and receive them.

1309
01:27:17,683 --> 01:27:19,104
- Wait... wait.
- Please come soon.

1310
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:20,947
Aiya, I'm coming.

1311
01:27:23,942 --> 01:27:24,942
Stop.

1312
01:27:26,745 --> 01:27:28,704
Greetings, aiya.

1313
01:27:29,433 --> 01:27:30,470
Welcome.

1314
01:27:30,509 --> 01:27:31,509
Isn't aiya with you?

1315
01:27:31,545 --> 01:27:32,928
Oh! Is he coming in another car?

1316
01:27:33,005 --> 01:27:34,694
Welcome, please come in.

1317
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:38,457
My house isn't built for your height.

1318
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,955
Please adjust Bend a little.

1319
01:27:39,993 --> 01:27:40,993
Please come in.

1320
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:49,056
- 'Vanakkam', aiya.
- Greetings, aiya.

1321
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:50,632
Please sit.

1322
01:27:50,669 --> 01:27:51,669
It's okay.

1323
01:27:51,705 --> 01:27:53,049
What are you waiting for?

1324
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,854
Offer tea or coffee for our groom

1325
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:56,467
1 minute.

1326
01:27:57,427 --> 01:28:00,499
My aiya doesn't approve of this alliance
I came to tell you in person.

1327
01:28:02,073 --> 01:28:03,379
What do you mean?

1328
01:28:03,494 --> 01:28:04,761
What are you saying?

1329
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,912
I invited the entire village
trusting his word.

1330
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,293
Aiya, I thought you are
a man of your word.

1331
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:11,443
But didn't expect these words from you!

1332
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:13,056
I'm an ordinary teacher.

1333
01:28:13,133 --> 01:28:14,822
How will I face everyone?

1334
01:28:14,861 --> 01:28:16,934
How can I digest this insult?

1335
01:28:16,973 --> 01:28:19,123
You led us on
and then let us down!

1336
01:28:27,456 --> 01:28:29,030
Does your aiya disapprove?

1337
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,333
Or you don't approve of me either?

1338
01:28:38,707 --> 01:28:40,627
Anything my aiya doesn't like...

1339
01:28:40,819 --> 01:28:42,393
I won't approve either.

1340
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:47,040
'How can you betray us?'

1341
01:28:47,193 --> 01:28:49,267
My granddaughter
can't bear this disgrace

1342
01:28:49,305 --> 01:28:51,072
I knew this would happen.

1343
01:28:58,253 --> 01:29:00,633
You've taught a lesson to me, the teacher!

1344
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:15,225
"Did you drink all the poison
to save the world from destruction?"

1345
01:29:15,302 --> 01:29:19,949
"Here is the blue necked lord
O' Shiva, the fearsome God."

1346
01:29:20,025 --> 01:29:24,902
"Did you think of it as a sacred offering?
Was this sacrifice your way of suffering?"

1347
01:29:24,941 --> 01:29:29,203
"Did you break the rage within?
O' the lord in every being."

1348
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:33,965
"You saw Shakthi's eyes well up with tears?
Is it due to your words so fierce?"

1349
01:29:34,848 --> 01:29:37,728
Bro, how could you say
something so hurtful?

1350
01:29:38,189 --> 01:29:40,224
That girl's heart would have
shattered into bits.

1351
01:29:40,262 --> 01:29:42,144
How difficult my heart
must have felt to say it?

1352
01:29:42,182 --> 01:29:44,140
"You carried Himalayas as your burden."

1353
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:45,523
When it comes to public service...

1354
01:29:45,561 --> 01:29:47,405
we have to sacrifice our personal needs.

1355
01:29:47,443 --> 01:29:51,629
As far as the villagers are concerned
they will only assume aiya didn't approve.

1356
01:29:51,705 --> 01:29:53,587
No one will say
aiya didn't come today.

1357
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:55,085
That's only important.

1358
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:58,925
"Here is the blue necked lord
O' Shiva, the fearsome God."

1359
01:29:58,963 --> 01:30:03,878
"Did you think of it as a sacred offering?
Was this sacrifice your way of suffering?"

1360
01:30:03,993 --> 01:30:08,294
"Did you break the rage within?
O' the lord in every being."

1361
01:30:27,225 --> 01:30:28,301
Grandma.

1362
01:30:28,838 --> 01:30:31,680
Ask my father to fix
any groom of his choice

1363
01:30:32,486 --> 01:30:33,638
I'll marry him.

1364
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:36,096
- Dai, did you hear what she said?
- This is enough'

1365
01:30:39,705 --> 01:30:45,043
"The earth and the sky wrapped in laughter
The whole universe happy ever after."

1366
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:49,805
"Cloaked in hypocrisy
O' Shiva, tell me?"

1367
01:30:49,881 --> 01:30:54,528
"Affection in one eye smothering
Love in the other eye hovering."

1368
01:30:54,566 --> 01:30:58,829
"Which tear drop bears defeat?
O' Shiva, to you I entreat!"

1369
01:30:58,905 --> 01:31:03,705
"This is a misty kind of cloudiness
Did you get lost in its haziness?"

1370
01:31:03,744 --> 01:31:08,621
"This disguise is a silent killer
Why did you wear this attire?"

1371
01:31:08,697 --> 01:31:13,497
"Is this strategy a solution?
Is this the only option?"

1372
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,878
"Is darkness the harbinger of light?"

1373
01:31:15,955 --> 01:31:19,142
"One with foresight
who knows wrong from right."

1374
01:31:19,181 --> 01:31:22,790
"Shiva! One who is omnipresent
Is this situation permanent?"

1375
01:31:24,096 --> 01:31:26,400
Muthu, don't throw a tantrum.

1376
01:31:26,438 --> 01:31:27,744
Drink it up.

1377
01:31:28,281 --> 01:31:30,278
Listn to me, drink.

1378
01:31:32,429 --> 01:31:35,923
He refuses to eat ever since
our aiya has been incapacitated.

1379
01:31:36,269 --> 01:31:40,032
We can keep it a secret from people
but can we fool this loyal animal?

1380
01:31:57,542 --> 01:32:00,691
Tablets prescribed by the doctor alone
won't make him recover.

1381
01:32:01,497 --> 01:32:03,955
Drum beat of Vettaikaruppu
has to be heard constantly.

1382
01:32:04,147 --> 01:32:06,105
That resonance will cure him faster.

1383
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:08,411
Karuppu.

1384
01:32:09,869 --> 01:32:11,366
Open the windows.

1385
01:32:20,505 --> 01:32:22,693
We wanted to come yesterday
but got held up.

1386
01:32:22,694 --> 01:32:24,806
Eswari, bring that water and-

1387
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:27,149
Did you take both the notebooks?

1388
01:32:27,187 --> 01:32:29,376
Good lord! Please come.

1389
01:32:29,414 --> 01:32:30,414
What brings you here?

1390
01:32:30,451 --> 01:32:31,526
Please come - Muruga.

1391
01:32:31,565 --> 01:32:33,945
If you block the way
how can we come in?

1392
01:32:34,329 --> 01:32:36,672
- What is the matter?
- We want to meet aiya.

1393
01:32:37,017 --> 01:32:37,939
Aiya, huh?

1394
01:32:37,977 --> 01:32:39,129
Junior aiya is free.

1395
01:32:39,168 --> 01:32:41,203
Muruga, we have to discuss
a very important issue.

1396
01:32:41,241 --> 01:32:42,585
Have to meet only aiya.

1397
01:32:44,121 --> 01:32:45,849
- Only aiya, huh?
- Yes.

1398
01:32:45,888 --> 01:32:48,269
Please sit down
I'll go and inform him.

1399
01:32:48,307 --> 01:32:49,421
Let's sit.

1400
01:32:49,459 --> 01:32:52,339
- Bagyam, serve them buttermilk.
- Okay, bro.

1401
01:32:52,416 --> 01:32:54,297
They've made my head spin!

1402
01:32:54,489 --> 01:32:57,485
Oblivious of the SOS crisis
you're meddling with your laptop!

1403
01:32:57,523 --> 01:32:59,635
Elders of Mudur and Panaiyur have come

1404
01:32:59,673 --> 01:33:02,054
I believe they have to discuss
something with aiya.

1405
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:04,819
- Did you offer them anything to drink?
- Yes, buttermilk.

1406
01:33:04,857 --> 01:33:05,857
Okay.

1407
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:07,085
Ask them to come in.

1408
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:08,045
Aiyaiyo!

1409
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,310
They want to meet AIYA!

1410
01:33:10,963 --> 01:33:12,806
That's what I said
Please show them in.

1411
01:33:12,845 --> 01:33:14,649
Don't play the fool
Then I'll bring them-

1412
01:33:25,401 --> 01:33:27,091
Come... come.

1413
01:33:27,897 --> 01:33:29,049
Come.

1414
01:33:29,088 --> 01:33:31,853
[Song from 'En Annan']

1415
01:33:34,387 --> 01:33:37,689
Aiya, villagers from Mudur
and Panaiyur have come to see you.

1416
01:33:37,728 --> 01:33:40,185
They want to discuss
something very important.

1417
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:43,910
Got the statement of accounts
of the festival till date, aiya.

1418
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:47,289
We arranged everything for
the chariot procession on the 5th day.

1419
01:33:47,558 --> 01:33:49,133
Why are you standing so far away?

1420
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:50,899
Please come forward and speak.

1421
01:33:54,201 --> 01:33:55,201
That's okay.

1422
01:33:55,238 --> 01:33:56,581
Go on.

1423
01:33:56,582 --> 01:33:59,462
You must request the collector
to release the water from the dam

1424
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:00,897
for the 'sickle offering' ritual.

1425
01:34:00,921 --> 01:34:02,342
We came to give the update.

1426
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:05,069
- Give it to aiya.
- We'll take leave.

1427
01:34:05,107 --> 01:34:06,681
We'll take leave, bro.

1428
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:10,790
It is all smooth sailing
without any problems.

1429
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:12,595
Please eat lunch here
and then leave.

1430
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:13,632
Aiya's orders.

1431
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:15,835
Aiya, we had buttermilk
That's enough, we'll take leave.

1432
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,933
We are leading a good life
thanks to aiya.

1433
01:34:29,145 --> 01:34:31,027
- Hello... greetings.
- You're also here, huh?

1434
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:32,909
- Is aiya in?
- Just met him.

1435
01:34:32,947 --> 01:34:33,984
Please go in.

1436
01:34:36,211 --> 01:34:37,248
Aiya...!

1437
01:34:37,747 --> 01:34:39,245
Aiya!

1438
01:34:39,897 --> 01:34:40,973
Hey, Karuppu.

1439
01:34:42,048 --> 01:34:43,929
- You're here, huh!
- What is it?

1440
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:48,883
More people from more villages
have come now to meet aiya.

1441
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:52,838
How will you manage this hurdle?

1442
01:34:56,025 --> 01:34:57,345
Aiya is leaving for the festival.

1443
01:34:57,369 --> 01:34:58,905
Get the vehicle ready.

1444
01:35:00,326 --> 01:35:01,901
- Aiya...?
- Go.

1445
01:35:02,784 --> 01:35:05,587
'When aiya is incapacitated
how will he attend the festival?'

1446
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:08,774
Aiya is getting ready for the festival
He will meet you at the venue.

1447
01:35:08,813 --> 01:35:11,654
- Muruga, turn the car the other way.
- Let us go.

1448
01:35:11,731 --> 01:35:12,960
Is this a joke?

1449
01:35:13,459 --> 01:35:15,072
How can he attend the festival?

1450
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,224
Wait and watch, he will.

1451
01:35:16,262 --> 01:35:17,337
You go get ready

1452
01:35:17,376 --> 01:35:18,336
I'm ready right now.

1453
01:35:18,374 --> 01:35:20,793
All I have to do is sit and drive
What about aiya?

1454
01:35:20,909 --> 01:35:22,598
I'll be in the driver's seat.

1455
01:35:22,752 --> 01:35:24,095
You'll be in aiya's seat!

1456
01:35:24,096 --> 01:35:25,171
Er... hmmm.

1457
01:35:25,478 --> 01:35:27,398
Please explain in a way
it will make sense to me!

1458
01:35:27,705 --> 01:35:29,741
You'll come disguised as aiya!

1459
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:33,081
- Did you see I'm already incoherent?
- Why...?

1460
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,192
You imitate my father and me with ease
Won't you behave like aiya?

1461
01:35:36,269 --> 01:35:38,381
If I practice for 10 days,
I can speak like aiya.

1462
01:35:38,419 --> 01:35:39,877
But how can I step into his shoes now?

1463
01:35:39,878 --> 01:35:41,913
There's difference between
majesty and comedy.

1464
01:35:41,952 --> 01:35:43,848
If you draw stripes on a cat,
will it be a tiger?

1465
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:46,675
- Don't play the fool.
- As aiya's son, won't you listen to me?

1466
01:35:46,713 --> 01:35:48,365
Can aiya's son become a driver?

1467
01:35:48,403 --> 01:35:49,977
How can a driver act like aiya?

1468
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:52,243
How can you compare
a mountain and a molehill?

1469
01:35:52,281 --> 01:35:53,549
Muruga...!

1470
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:57,811
Let me take aiya's blessing.

1471
01:36:04,262 --> 01:36:07,027
Aiya, your son wants me
to act like you.

1472
01:36:07,296 --> 01:36:08,525
Please forgive me!

1473
01:36:08,563 --> 01:36:12,173
Don't we disguise as God to fulfil
a vow we make to our favorite deity?

1474
01:36:12,825 --> 01:36:14,707
That's how I'm pretending to be you.

1475
01:36:14,784 --> 01:36:16,819
With the grace of
our village deity, Vettaikaruppa

1476
01:36:16,857 --> 01:36:19,085
you should bless me
with the required courage!

1477
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:25,230
Aiya!

1478
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:27,149
This permission will do.

1479
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,685
Enough, aiya.

1480
01:36:30,374 --> 01:36:31,795
Muruga, start the car.

1481
01:36:40,089 --> 01:36:42,432
- Aiyaiyo!
- What...?

1482
01:36:42,701 --> 01:36:44,083
I can't wear aiya's sandals.

1483
01:36:44,121 --> 01:36:44,966
Try them on.

1484
01:36:45,005 --> 01:36:46,925
Seems like 1 litmus test after another.

1485
01:36:48,653 --> 01:36:51,033
- Shall I wear it on my hand?
- Muruga...!

1486
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:52,761
Okay, don't be upset.

1487
01:36:56,985 --> 01:36:59,059
- The vibration is ultimate.
- Let's go.

1488
01:37:02,899 --> 01:37:04,358
'You said you'll walk by my side'

1489
01:37:04,473 --> 01:37:06,431
'But I didn't bargain
for such a side show'

1490
01:37:06,432 --> 01:37:11,078
"Sun with turban tied on his head
Head of all the villages, most revered."

1491
01:37:11,155 --> 01:37:14,457
Aiya has come
All of you get into the cars.

1492
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,686
Are they all waiting here?

1493
01:37:15,725 --> 01:37:19,219
Aiya, open the door fast
Or else our ruse will go for a toss!

1494
01:37:19,257 --> 01:37:20,409
Open the door.

1495
01:37:20,448 --> 01:37:22,099
Load the baskets quickly.

1496
01:37:22,137 --> 01:37:23,289
Make it fast.

1497
01:37:23,328 --> 01:37:24,480
Hurry up.

1498
01:37:30,816 --> 01:37:33,657
Thank God, somehow
I managed to get into the car.

1499
01:37:33,773 --> 01:37:35,385
We said we are coming
to the temple

1500
01:37:35,424 --> 01:37:37,689
I guess they don't trust us
They are following us.

1501
01:37:37,805 --> 01:37:40,723
- How many cars are following us?
- 5 cars, aiya.

1502
01:37:40,761 --> 01:37:41,721
Not 5 cars

1503
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,912
5 villages!

1504
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:43,950
Aiya.

1505
01:37:44,909 --> 01:37:46,253
We are following aiya's vehicle.

1506
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:47,712
We left from aiya's house.

1507
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:49,133
We will meet you at the temple.

1508
01:37:49,171 --> 01:37:51,014
We are coming there
Madampatti villagers also.

1509
01:37:51,053 --> 01:37:52,512
Be there soon.

1510
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:58,041
'Those who are watching the devotees
walking on fire, keep to one side'

1511
01:37:58,809 --> 01:38:00,729
'A parking lot has been
specifically assigned'

1512
01:38:00,768 --> 01:38:02,765
'Why are all the cars
being allowed inside?'

1513
01:38:02,803 --> 01:38:07,449
We have separate queues for men and
women at the food donation counter.

1514
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,830
Look there, separate those 5 villages.

1515
01:38:09,869 --> 01:38:12,365
Work has been allotted
to all the 5 villages.

1516
01:38:12,403 --> 01:38:14,093
What do you gain following me?

1517
01:38:14,131 --> 01:38:15,360
Attend to your work.

1518
01:38:15,513 --> 01:38:18,278
'People from Kottaiyur, Mangalam
Did you eat?'

1519
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:20,467
Kottaiyur people
Aiya is mentioning you.

1520
01:38:23,309 --> 01:38:24,537
Let's also go eat.

1521
01:38:24,576 --> 01:38:25,805
Then it may get crowded.

1522
01:38:25,843 --> 01:38:27,379
Those priests-

1523
01:38:27,571 --> 01:38:28,723
Police... police...!

1524
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:30,451
"Silver moon that never wanes."

1525
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:33,254
Hey, police officer, how many people
are standing on the steps?

1526
01:38:33,293 --> 01:38:34,598
Children also, right?

1527
01:38:34,752 --> 01:38:35,789
I'm speaking to you.

1528
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,209
Busy licking ice cream!

1529
01:38:37,709 --> 01:38:39,936
Yov! Aiya - Where...?

1530
01:38:40,128 --> 01:38:42,009
On the screen - Hey, get down.

1531
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,045
- Get down, I say.
- You dropped the ice cream

1532
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:46,502
I know it's a hot day
Enjoy the ice cream and then work.

1533
01:38:46,925 --> 01:38:50,342
The electricians fixing the serial lights
Don't hinder the chariot procession.

1534
01:38:50,381 --> 01:38:51,801
Position it to one side.

1535
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,568
Understood?

1536
01:38:53,683 --> 01:38:55,833
Bro, nothing has happened to aiya!

1537
01:38:56,141 --> 01:38:57,293
He has come to the festival.

1538
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:58,867
Speaking in his usual
energetic voice.

1539
01:38:58,905 --> 01:39:00,288
We are watching on the screen.

1540
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,208
'Drink coffee'

1541
01:39:03,513 --> 01:39:04,742
'Tell me, aiya'

1542
01:39:04,781 --> 01:39:06,662
Next is a commercial break!

1543
01:39:09,389 --> 01:39:14,918
"Who is the winner now and forever
Lungis with the brand MCR."

1544
01:39:15,456 --> 01:39:16,493
That's true.

1545
01:39:16,531 --> 01:39:18,413
You made me dress up like aiya

1546
01:39:18,451 --> 01:39:20,870
I thought it'll be a herculean task
But it was a cakewalk!

1547
01:39:20,909 --> 01:39:23,021
Showed aiya on the screen
and we escaped!

1548
01:39:26,323 --> 01:39:27,551
You spoke very well.

1549
01:39:27,552 --> 01:39:28,552
'Listen to me'

1550
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:35,078
From morning, you're hell bent
on falling under every car passing by.

1551
01:39:35,155 --> 01:39:37,459
Aiya, looks like trouble is brewing.

1552
01:39:37,881 --> 01:39:41,568
- This chap, huh?
- Whatever it is I'll ask only aiya.

1553
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:43,872
Get lost, man

1554
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:45,561
I know it's aiya's vehicle.

1555
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,865
Why has he brought so many people?
What is his plan?

1556
01:39:47,904 --> 01:39:49,209
I must meet Aiya

1557
01:39:49,248 --> 01:39:52,627
I must look him in his eye
and question him.

1558
01:39:52,665 --> 01:39:54,009
This is my plea.

1559
01:39:54,086 --> 01:39:55,545
If you stop me...

1560
01:39:55,584 --> 01:39:57,081
I'll break it and pierce myself.

1561
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:00,307
- Let go of me.
- Drunkard, move aside

1562
01:40:00,345 --> 01:40:01,920
I'll break it and pierce myself.

1563
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:03,149
Aiya - What is it?

1564
01:40:03,187 --> 01:40:04,608
He isn't yielding.

1565
01:40:04,646 --> 01:40:08,141
He's obstinate he has
to meet aiya in person.

1566
01:40:09,638 --> 01:40:10,982
Ask him to come over.

1567
01:40:12,518 --> 01:40:15,629
He wants to meet our aiya
What are you saying?

1568
01:40:15,974 --> 01:40:17,241
Aren't you aiya?

1569
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,699
Hey, aiya is calling you.

1570
01:40:20,313 --> 01:40:21,926
If he comes here
we'll get caught.

1571
01:40:21,965 --> 01:40:23,155
He's here!

1572
01:40:23,193 --> 01:40:24,537
Let go of me - Please don't.

1573
01:40:24,576 --> 01:40:27,341
'Open the door' - Don't open.

1574
01:40:27,456 --> 01:40:29,491
Look at me, aiya.

1575
01:40:29,529 --> 01:40:30,720
'Please turn'

1576
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:32,217
'Look at me, aiya'

1577
01:40:33,561 --> 01:40:34,867
Wait... wait.

1578
01:40:37,632 --> 01:40:39,398
- This isn't our aiya!
- I told you, right?

1579
01:40:39,513 --> 01:40:40,857
What is he blabbering?

1580
01:40:40,896 --> 01:40:42,163
You are...

1581
01:40:42,969 --> 01:40:44,352
my God!

1582
01:40:44,813 --> 01:40:46,771
The God I can see face to face!

1583
01:40:52,224 --> 01:40:54,374
Because of drinking
this cursed liquor...

1584
01:40:54,413 --> 01:40:56,409
I lost my eyesight.

1585
01:40:57,869 --> 01:41:00,326
I can't see your face clearly.

1586
01:41:00,403 --> 01:41:04,320
Please help me with money
for my eye surgery.

1587
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:05,741
When should I come?

1588
01:41:05,817 --> 01:41:07,353
Don't worry.

1589
01:41:07,392 --> 01:41:08,505
Let the festival get over

1590
01:41:08,544 --> 01:41:10,080
I'll ask Murugan to organize it, okay?

1591
01:41:10,118 --> 01:41:12,269
Murugan? He's a rascal.

1592
01:41:12,422 --> 01:41:13,881
He's a fraud!

1593
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,187
He's an actor.

1594
01:41:15,225 --> 01:41:17,376
Past 3 days I've been
trying to see you.

1595
01:41:17,414 --> 01:41:19,411
He didn't allow me to meet you.

1596
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:22,176
He's complaining about me to me!
You rascal!

1597
01:41:22,829 --> 01:41:25,401
I'll inform my son
and arrange everything.

1598
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,552
Aiya, if you are God in person

1599
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:29,203
he's the younger version of the same!

1600
01:41:29,241 --> 01:41:31,545
May both of you lead
a long and healthy life.

1601
01:41:31,584 --> 01:41:33,235
Convey my regards to your son.

1602
01:41:33,273 --> 01:41:34,464
Give way.

1603
01:41:34,502 --> 01:41:36,307
Move away Make way for sir's car.

1604
01:41:36,345 --> 01:41:38,573
Come, God Move aside.

1605
01:41:42,518 --> 01:41:46,089
'Pechi, there's no sign indicating
the incident ever happened!'

1606
01:41:46,127 --> 01:41:48,623
'It is a big question mark
if aiya is alive or not'

1607
01:41:50,082 --> 01:41:51,350
What do we do now?

1608
01:41:52,348 --> 01:41:53,846
Who should we send to find out?

1609
01:41:54,268 --> 01:41:55,727
Hey, will you go?

1610
01:41:56,034 --> 01:41:58,070
Dai, what about you?

1611
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:01,103
Hey old lady, will you check and come?

1612
01:42:01,833 --> 01:42:03,446
1st you should be hacked!

1613
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,327
You're the reason for all the troubles.

1614
01:42:05,366 --> 01:42:08,783
No need of any research
whether he's alive or dead.

1615
01:42:08,898 --> 01:42:10,358
Our target is still alive!!

1616
01:42:17,385 --> 01:42:20,073
Pechi, please untie my chains

1617
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:22,031
I'll make sure I kill him.

1618
01:42:22,185 --> 01:42:23,567
Pechi...!

1619
01:42:29,481 --> 01:42:31,017
Hello, tell me, uncle.

1620
01:42:31,094 --> 01:42:32,937
Is Anbu with you?

1621
01:42:32,975 --> 01:42:35,318
What are you saying?
He's with aiya.

1622
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:37,122
Can't find him here.

1623
01:42:37,161 --> 01:42:39,081
When did you check?
Did you see properly?

1624
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:42,460
Bro, we searched for him everywhere
We assumed he's with you

1625
01:42:42,537 --> 01:42:45,186
I even tried calling him
but he isn't picking up the call.

1626
01:43:08,572 --> 01:43:10,454
All this happened
only because of me, aiya.

1627
01:43:11,183 --> 01:43:13,602
When you asked me to leave,
I shouldn't have left.

1628
01:43:14,486 --> 01:43:16,674
If I die, all the problems
will be solved, right?

1629
01:43:32,418 --> 01:43:35,759
Bro, the bull is falling into our trap
of its own accord, please come fast.

1630
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:41,558
Move the car.

1631
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,927
- Ma?
- Tell me.

1632
01:43:51,004 --> 01:43:52,310
How are you?

1633
01:43:52,425 --> 01:43:55,190
I felt like talking to you
That's why I called

1634
01:43:55,266 --> 01:43:56,687
I can't hear you clearly.

1635
01:43:56,726 --> 01:43:58,454
You sound very dull.

1636
01:43:58,492 --> 01:44:00,527
It's very noisy here
I'll call you later.

1637
01:44:00,566 --> 01:44:02,447
Okay, take care of your health.

1638
01:45:40,559 --> 01:45:42,249
What, my dear boys?

1639
01:45:42,556 --> 01:45:44,092
You wanted to kidnap him?

1640
01:45:44,207 --> 01:45:46,665
Wondering how he pre-empted you?

1641
01:45:46,895 --> 01:45:48,623
You looked at the sheep in front.

1642
01:45:48,777 --> 01:45:50,850
But you didn't notice
the tiger at the back.

1643
01:45:51,388 --> 01:45:52,770
Look there.

1644
01:45:54,767 --> 01:45:56,687
This isn't a 'Goat vs Tiger' game.

1645
01:45:56,879 --> 01:45:59,183
This is a goat and tiger
playing games together.

1646
01:46:18,767 --> 01:46:20,073
You are educated.

1647
01:46:20,418 --> 01:46:22,070
You've taken the right decision!

1648
01:46:23,106 --> 01:46:24,374
Very correct.

1649
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:26,985
I can't bear to see aiya in this condition.

1650
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:29,519
I am to blame for all this.

1651
01:46:29,903 --> 01:46:31,746
If I die, won't everything be fine?

1652
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:35,625
Has your life become
so simple for you?

1653
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:37,737
Your life isn't just yours alone.

1654
01:46:38,236 --> 01:46:40,041
Behind that is your entire lineage.

1655
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:43,458
Following my aiya's words
that he'll protect you...

1656
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:44,802
is our entire lineage too!

1657
01:46:45,647 --> 01:46:47,644
Believing I'll safeguard you...

1658
01:46:47,759 --> 01:46:49,948
our aiya is still breathing.

1659
01:46:50,562 --> 01:46:52,406
Tomorrow when he opens his eyes...

1660
01:46:53,212 --> 01:46:54,633
if I say Anbu is missing.

1661
01:46:55,286 --> 01:46:57,513
And the festival was stopped
half way through

1662
01:46:58,089 --> 01:47:00,316
he'll look at me with
so much pride you know!

1663
01:47:00,508 --> 01:47:01,583
Aiya...!

1664
01:47:02,198 --> 01:47:03,388
I know it's wrong.

1665
01:47:05,692 --> 01:47:08,073
Tomorrow is the 6th day
of our temple festival.

1666
01:47:08,226 --> 01:47:10,454
You will be offering
our sickle to our village deity

1667
01:47:10,761 --> 01:47:12,796
I've got permission
from all the 6 villages.

1668
01:47:12,834 --> 01:47:14,716
And you feel this way
at this juncture!

1669
01:47:18,364 --> 01:47:19,364
Don't cry.

1670
01:47:20,438 --> 01:47:22,703
- Don't repeat this mistake again.
- I won't, aiya.

1671
01:47:53,538 --> 01:47:54,690
Nothing to worry, grandma.

1672
01:47:54,729 --> 01:47:57,148
It's a real big bruise
and you're brushing it aside.

1673
01:47:58,223 --> 01:48:01,679
If you ride with a wandering mind
this will be the end result!

1674
01:48:01,718 --> 01:48:03,446
Groom and his family are coming to see you.

1675
01:48:03,484 --> 01:48:06,364
If you're injured now,
won't they take it as inauspicious?

1676
01:48:06,402 --> 01:48:07,938
Wonder where she fell!

1677
01:48:07,977 --> 01:48:09,474
The wire has come apart.

1678
01:48:09,666 --> 01:48:11,894
Brake doesn't work
and mirror is broken!

1679
01:48:11,932 --> 01:48:14,812
Let her touch this bike again
I will clobber her.

1680
01:48:16,962 --> 01:48:18,230
Why have they come here?

1681
01:48:18,268 --> 01:48:19,958
What brings you here?

1682
01:48:20,111 --> 01:48:21,111
What do you want?

1683
01:48:21,148 --> 01:48:23,529
I'm applying this ointment
Where are you rushing off to?

1684
01:48:23,567 --> 01:48:25,065
Always playful!

1685
01:48:25,602 --> 01:48:27,330
I heard Sembaruthi is hurt

1686
01:48:27,446 --> 01:48:28,636
I came to see her.

1687
01:48:28,674 --> 01:48:31,631
You already hit us very heavily
We are yet to recover!

1688
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:33,206
How can it get worse?

1689
01:48:33,244 --> 01:48:35,855
A prospective groom is coming
to see my daughter today.

1690
01:48:35,894 --> 01:48:37,353
They have a lot of self-respect.

1691
01:48:37,391 --> 01:48:39,964
They will be punctual
and keep up their word.

1692
01:48:40,002 --> 01:48:41,078
Unlike you!

1693
01:48:41,116 --> 01:48:42,614
Kindly leave this place.

1694
01:48:42,652 --> 01:48:43,652
Alright.

1695
01:48:44,111 --> 01:48:47,721
When you have an auspicious event
to look forward to and I'm a hindrance

1696
01:48:47,798 --> 01:48:48,834
we'll leave.

1697
01:48:48,873 --> 01:48:49,910
Thank you very much!

1698
01:48:49,948 --> 01:48:51,215
Please get going.

1699
01:48:52,751 --> 01:48:54,710
For any happy occasion
in the neighborhood...

1700
01:48:54,748 --> 01:48:57,398
aiya sends a trousseau
It will be delivered at your doorstep.

1701
01:48:57,436 --> 01:48:59,163
We don't need any favors from you.

1702
01:48:59,164 --> 01:49:00,354
We can fend for ourselves.

1703
01:49:00,393 --> 01:49:02,351
We will be fine
without you in our lives.

1704
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:03,580
You've done enough damage.

1705
01:49:03,618 --> 01:49:06,652
You ruined everything by not coming
Today don't spoil it by coming!

1706
01:49:06,690 --> 01:49:07,612
Go away...!

1707
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:08,726
Are you mad or wha-

1708
01:49:10,223 --> 01:49:11,529
We are at the receiving end.

1709
01:49:11,567 --> 01:49:12,911
So can he let his tongue ru-

1710
01:49:15,676 --> 01:49:17,212
We will thank you profusely.

1711
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,978
Leave now - You won't prosper.

1712
01:49:19,017 --> 01:49:19,938
Hypocrites!

1713
01:49:19,977 --> 01:49:23,510
If the bike is so badly damaged
imagine that poor girl's condition.

1714
01:49:23,548 --> 01:49:26,198
If the teacher is in a rage,
you're adding fuel to the fire

1715
01:49:26,236 --> 01:49:28,002
1st I should buy a dog for this house.

1716
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:29,154
Not just buy.

1717
01:49:29,231 --> 01:49:30,614
Tie it at the gate.

1718
01:49:30,652 --> 01:49:31,652
Sembaruthi.

1719
01:49:31,689 --> 01:49:32,879
Get ready soon.

1720
01:49:32,918 --> 01:49:35,068
The groom and his family
will be here anytime.

1721
01:49:41,711 --> 01:49:43,708
Bro, how do we go
to the teacher's house?

1722
01:49:43,746 --> 01:49:45,090
Why are you going there?

1723
01:49:45,129 --> 01:49:46,511
To see the prospective bride.

1724
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:48,354
Wait a minute
I'll deal with them.

1725
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:49,506
Who is the groom?

1726
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,081
This chap, huh?

1727
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:52,156
What...?

1728
01:49:53,922 --> 01:49:55,151
He hid his eyes.

1729
01:49:56,610 --> 01:49:59,010
Will you tell us how to go
only if you know who the groom is?

1730
01:49:59,068 --> 01:50:01,025
If you just say teacher,
how can we guide you?

1731
01:50:01,026 --> 01:50:03,561
We'll know only if you say
music teacher, stunt master.

1732
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,057
He said even a kid
will direct us to his place.

1733
01:50:06,095 --> 01:50:07,554
Then go ask a kid!

1734
01:50:07,593 --> 01:50:08,937
Why do you ask me?

1735
01:50:08,975 --> 01:50:11,471
Bro, why are you so rude?
It's a matter of my life!

1736
01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:13,122
- Is your life at stake?
- Yes.

1737
01:50:13,161 --> 01:50:16,425
If you take this right and then left
you'll reach your destination!

1738
01:50:16,463 --> 01:50:18,076
Giving directions to the cemetery!

1739
01:50:18,114 --> 01:50:18,998
Cemetery?

1740
01:50:19,036 --> 01:50:20,918
He looks like he has already been cremated!

1741
01:50:20,956 --> 01:50:23,490
So I told him the way
to the cemetery.

1742
01:50:24,489 --> 01:50:25,962
If you go straight and take a right...

1743
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:28,636
you'll see a mango grove
Their house is in the center.

1744
01:50:28,674 --> 01:50:30,671
Go fast, bride will be
yearning for me.

1745
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:35,433
All arrangements are in proper order.

1746
01:50:39,426 --> 01:50:40,655
Where's your aiya?

1747
01:50:40,694 --> 01:50:42,652
Is he at home?
I've come to see him.

1748
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:43,958
The groom came to 'see' me.

1749
01:50:43,996 --> 01:50:45,378
He liked me instantly.

1750
01:50:45,417 --> 01:50:46,569
We finalized it formally.

1751
01:50:46,607 --> 01:50:48,758
You must have thought
we won't get anyone else.

1752
01:50:48,796 --> 01:50:50,562
So I came here to tell you

1753
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,444
1st invitation will be only for you.

1754
01:50:52,482 --> 01:50:54,057
You come from an affluent family.

1755
01:50:54,095 --> 01:50:55,286
We can't trust you.

1756
01:50:55,324 --> 01:50:58,703
You'll post the photos we clicked
and selfies in Twitter and Facebook.

1757
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:02,082
And try to break up this alliance
So I came to collect everything.

1758
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,079
We have no ties hereafter.

1759
01:51:04,655 --> 01:51:05,615
Enough is enough.

1760
01:51:05,654 --> 01:51:07,305
Let's wrap up everything.

1761
01:51:08,111 --> 01:51:10,415
Where's your aiya?
The most respected man!

1762
01:51:10,454 --> 01:51:12,642
Your suspense
turned out to be a shock.

1763
01:51:12,681 --> 01:51:14,562
Did you run and hide
hearing my voice?

1764
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:15,522
I'm coming.

1765
01:51:15,561 --> 01:51:17,289
You sent your son as a messenger.

1766
01:51:17,327 --> 01:51:19,362
She has gone right in
What should we do now?

1767
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:20,719
I've come in person Tell me now.

1768
01:51:20,745 --> 01:51:21,820
Let her go - What...?

1769
01:51:21,858 --> 01:51:25,122
If it hasn't rained the past 7 years
how will it rain when you're here?

1770
01:51:25,161 --> 01:51:27,465
You call yourself a big shot
and break your promise!

1771
01:51:27,503 --> 01:51:29,730
One who changes his mind
isn't a big shot.

1772
01:51:29,769 --> 01:51:32,879
To keep up your word, you should be
prepared to sacrifice your lif-

1773
01:51:44,361 --> 01:51:46,281
'I'll surprise him
Let it be a suspense'

1774
01:51:47,894 --> 01:51:49,698
'Anything my aiya doesn't like...'

1775
01:51:49,929 --> 01:51:51,311
'...I won't approve either'

1776
01:52:05,404 --> 01:52:06,748
I saw aiya.

1777
01:52:07,938 --> 01:52:09,474
Why did you hide it from me?

1778
01:52:10,511 --> 01:52:13,199
When I was slightly hurt,
you came running to see me.

1779
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:15,426
He has such a huge bandage on-

1780
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:21,225
I derided you saying
'how will it rain with you being here'

1781
01:52:23,068 --> 01:52:25,564
You've shed blood for this land.

1782
01:52:27,484 --> 01:52:29,212
You hid everything from me.

1783
01:52:29,289 --> 01:52:31,708
How can you behave
as if nothing happened?

1784
01:52:33,244 --> 01:52:34,319
Sacred vow.

1785
01:52:38,428 --> 01:52:41,078
As it is I have to strain my neck
to look into your eyes.

1786
01:52:42,652 --> 01:52:44,457
Now I look up to you!

1787
01:52:52,905 --> 01:52:55,439
Hey, go... go
Attend to your work.

1788
01:53:10,185 --> 01:53:11,798
No... no...!

1789
01:53:12,873 --> 01:53:14,601
Please spare him.

1790
01:53:15,561 --> 01:53:16,636
Don't.

1791
01:53:18,172 --> 01:53:19,708
No, don't.

1792
01:53:20,745 --> 01:53:22,050
Hello, tell me.

1793
01:53:22,089 --> 01:53:23,318
Koti, it's me.

1794
01:53:23,356 --> 01:53:24,393
Go ahead.

1795
01:53:24,431 --> 01:53:26,505
There's some disturbance,
can you hear me?

1796
01:53:26,658 --> 01:53:29,116
Bro is busy with an important deal.

1797
01:53:29,154 --> 01:53:30,844
Hey, shut up!

1798
01:53:30,882 --> 01:53:32,994
Got the photo and address on WhatsApp.

1799
01:53:33,148 --> 01:53:35,030
If there's any change
in plan, let me know.

1800
01:53:35,068 --> 01:53:36,681
No change in plan.

1801
01:53:36,758 --> 01:53:39,023
You give him to us and keep going.

1802
01:53:39,138 --> 01:53:41,481
Okay, don't keep calling us.

1803
01:53:43,055 --> 01:53:44,055
Pechi.

1804
01:53:45,206 --> 01:53:47,009
Men are coming from Rayalaseema.

1805
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:50,774
When Anbu comes for the ritual to offer
the sickle, we don't have to do anything.

1806
01:53:50,850 --> 01:53:53,769
They'll hand him over to us
and keep going.

1807
01:53:53,846 --> 01:53:56,457
Those thugs know their job
like the back of their hand.

1808
01:53:56,495 --> 01:53:57,801
All that is fine.

1809
01:53:57,993 --> 01:54:01,372
That aiya will keep interrupting
What will you do with him?

1810
01:54:01,871 --> 01:54:03,215
He won't come

1811
01:54:03,676 --> 01:54:06,326
I've made other arrangements
to keep him away.

1812
01:54:08,745 --> 01:54:09,820
Let me see.

1813
01:54:33,974 --> 01:54:35,010
Please come.

1814
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:39,964
Aiya, a rare visitor is here.

1815
01:54:40,002 --> 01:54:42,153
Wonder what trouble he will brew now!

1816
01:54:42,268 --> 01:54:43,574
Move aside.

1817
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:45,263
This is an auspicious time.

1818
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:46,646
Let's start the rituals.

1819
01:54:46,722 --> 01:54:48,950
When have we started without aiya?

1820
01:54:49,065 --> 01:54:50,065
What are you saying?

1821
01:54:50,178 --> 01:54:52,367
Aiya's son is here
Start with him.

1822
01:54:52,406 --> 01:54:55,516
He's learning the rope
and following his father's footsteps.

1823
01:54:55,554 --> 01:54:57,129
Let him light the sacred fire.

1824
01:54:57,167 --> 01:54:58,588
You can sit along with him.

1825
01:54:58,626 --> 01:55:00,239
If anyone objects, let me know.

1826
01:55:00,278 --> 01:55:02,313
When have we discriminated them?

1827
01:55:02,351 --> 01:55:04,847
Junior aiya can step
into his father's shoes.

1828
01:55:05,692 --> 01:55:07,804
Do you agree with me?

1829
01:55:08,073 --> 01:55:09,378
You are right.

1830
01:55:10,146 --> 01:55:11,682
Please begin the ritual.

1831
01:55:11,759 --> 01:55:14,639
Priest, give him the sickle
and send him to the river.

1832
01:55:17,481 --> 01:55:18,786
Be brave

1833
01:55:27,657 --> 01:55:29,654
[holy chant]

1834
01:55:50,082 --> 01:55:51,580
We are on the way.

1835
01:55:53,078 --> 01:55:55,151
Our 'brother' is right next to me.

1836
01:56:06,095 --> 01:56:08,898
Men from Rayalaseema have arrived

1837

1838
01:56:25,372 --> 01:56:27,138
Like Kamal in 'Indian 2'!

1840
01:57:30,114 --> 01:57:31,689
Hey, go.

1841
01:58:13,852 --> 01:58:15,119
Don't...!

1842
01:58:17,884 --> 01:58:19,305
No... no... don't.

1843

- Shut up!

1844

Go... go.

1845
01:58:25,641 --> 01:58:27,561
Hey, put down your sickle.

1846

Throw it down.

1847
01:58:28,905 --> 01:58:30,402
Bro, is it you?

1848
01:58:30,441 --> 01:58:32,438
We came without knowing it was you.

1849
01:58:32,514 --> 01:58:34,550
Don't mistake us
Please forgive us

1850
01:58:34,588 --> 01:58:36,623
I heard you went abroad.

1851
01:58:36,738 --> 01:58:39,695
But no one told me
about your return.

1852
01:58:39,772 --> 01:58:43,190
The way you hit me that day
I ran for my life, out of this State.

1853
01:58:43,228 --> 01:58:44,534
How can I forget that!

1854
01:58:44,572 --> 01:58:47,145
After that I changed
my name and address

1855
01:58:47,183 --> 01:58:50,486
I changed my style a little bit too
But I haven't changed my profession!

1856
01:58:50,524 --> 01:58:52,674
I was informed of
an assignment in Madurai

1857
01:58:52,713 --> 01:58:55,286
I asked if you are involved.

1858
01:58:55,631 --> 01:58:57,436
You didn't enquire properly.

1859
01:58:57,513 --> 01:58:59,126
They mentioned...

1860
01:58:59,164 --> 01:59:01,007
a person named Anbu.

1861
01:59:01,084 --> 01:59:03,196
That's why I'm here
Please forgive me.

1862
01:59:03,426 --> 01:59:04,847
Bro, phone call

1863
01:59:04,962 --> 01:59:06,191
1 minute.

1864
01:59:06,306 --> 01:59:07,727
Thanks.

1865
01:59:08,111 --> 01:59:10,300
- Hello...?
- Bro, close to the target.

1866
01:59:10,377 --> 01:59:12,297
- Shall I finish him off?
- No, please don't.

1867
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:14,793
Didn't lay your hand on him, right?

1868
01:59:14,908 --> 01:59:15,908
What do you mean?

1869
01:59:15,983 --> 01:59:17,634
In Theni, Kambam and surrounding areas

1870
01:59:17,673 --> 01:59:19,554
their word is law
Their deeds are just.

1871
01:59:19,593 --> 01:59:21,359
No one can oppose them and get away.

1872
01:59:21,398 --> 01:59:22,818
Just let him go.

1873
01:59:22,857 --> 01:59:24,047
Hey, wait... wait.

1874
01:59:24,086 --> 01:59:25,276
Listen to me.

1875
01:59:25,314 --> 01:59:27,695
Escort that boy safely
to the temple.

1876
01:59:27,772 --> 01:59:30,038
Until then ask our boys
to safeguard him.

1877
01:59:30,114 --> 01:59:31,074
Okay, bro.

1878
01:59:31,113 --> 01:59:32,840
Encircle him All the sides.

1879
01:59:32,841 --> 01:59:34,108
Who are they?

1880
01:59:34,146 --> 01:59:36,335
Don't get flustered
We are here to protect you.

1881
01:59:36,374 --> 01:59:37,564
Bro has sent us.

1882
01:59:37,602 --> 01:59:40,406
Be alert, not 1 fellow should get in.

1883
01:59:40,444 --> 01:59:42,287
- Okay, bro.
- Escort him with care.

1884
01:59:42,364 --> 01:59:43,708
What's happening here?

1885
01:59:44,015 --> 01:59:46,050
They promised to kill him.

1886
01:59:46,895 --> 01:59:49,122
Now they are acting as his bodyguard!

1887
01:59:50,966 --> 01:59:51,849
Don't worry.

1888
01:59:51,887 --> 01:59:54,306
My boys will escort him
to the temple safe and sound.

1889
01:59:54,345 --> 01:59:56,226
Can I take a selfie with you?

1890
01:59:56,303 --> 01:59:58,070
Bro, you are such a bigwig there.

1891
01:59:58,108 --> 01:59:59,030
He's a small fry

1892
01:59:59,068 --> 02:00:01,833
- I don't want you to click a selfie.
- Is a selfie that degrading?

1893
02:00:01,871 --> 02:00:04,636
For 6 months I couldn't move my own self.

1894
02:00:04,674 --> 02:00:06,287
Because of this boy's blows!

1895
02:00:06,326 --> 02:00:09,705
To quote your own words
he's the bigwig in this village.

1896
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:13,007
Shall we take a selfie?

1897
02:00:15,503 --> 02:00:18,230
Bro, put your hands around my shoulder.

1898
02:00:20,265 --> 02:00:21,954
A slight smile please?

1899
02:00:27,369 --> 02:00:28,713
I beg you.

02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:29,826
Please listen.

1901
02:00:29,865 --> 02:00:31,554
This marriage won't take place

1902
02:00:31,593 --> 02:00:33,705
I've made all the arrangements
for the wedding.

1903
02:00:33,743 --> 02:00:35,356
How can you change your mind?

1904
02:00:35,394 --> 02:00:36,431
Don't ask me for reasons.

1905
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:37,814
But this wedding won't happen.

1906
02:00:37,852 --> 02:00:39,119
Yes - Sir...?

1907
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:41,001
Look at my daughter's face.

1908
02:00:41,193 --> 02:00:42,614
She's innocent.

1909
02:00:42,806 --> 02:00:44,534
At least look at her face and say yes.

1910
02:00:48,335 --> 02:00:50,562
When you called me
to a dead end street, I knew.

1911
02:00:50,601 --> 02:00:51,945
Your love matter, right?

1912
02:00:51,983 --> 02:00:54,249
I'm a very sharp fellow
I grasp easily.

1913
02:00:54,287 --> 02:00:56,284
With Facebook and Twitter
as household names

1914
02:00:56,322 --> 02:00:58,511
if a chap wants a girl
who hasn't fallen in love

1915
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:02,198
all men should be in a loin cloth
standing like Lord Muruga in Pazhani.

1916
02:01:02,735 --> 02:01:04,271
I have a great sense of humor

1917
02:01:04,310 --> 02:01:06,806
I'll be very witty and
you'll enjoy it all your life.

1918
02:01:07,535 --> 02:01:10,415
Listen, I'm not worried
about your life before marriage.

1919
02:01:10,492 --> 02:01:13,602
If you are faithful to me
after the wedding, that's good enough.

1920
02:01:17,097 --> 02:01:19,439
No, even after marriage...

1921
02:01:20,169 --> 02:01:21,282
I'll continue.

1922
02:01:24,086 --> 02:01:25,122
I don't get it

1923
02:01:28,617 --> 02:01:30,076
I'll be your wife.

1924
02:01:30,191 --> 02:01:31,881
He'll be the 'other man' in my life!

1925
02:01:34,223 --> 02:01:37,641
'Can't live in confusion thinking
whose initial the baby will have!'

1926
02:01:37,718 --> 02:01:39,215
Hey, listen to me.

1927
02:01:40,598 --> 02:01:41,865
Don't ruin my daughter's life.

1928
02:01:41,903 --> 02:01:44,398
- What happened, sir?
- Old lady, I'll even marry you.

1929
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:45,974
But not your granddaughter!

1930
02:01:46,012 --> 02:01:48,854
My daughter's curse will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

1931
02:01:48,892 --> 02:01:50,889
My daughter is so shaken up!

1932
02:02:06,748 --> 02:02:08,706
"In the red boulder's shadow."

1933
02:02:09,436 --> 02:02:11,279
"Perched a sparrow-duo."

1934
02:02:12,162 --> 02:02:14,927
"Your mischievous glances many
lift me up in lilting harmony."

1935
02:02:14,966 --> 02:02:17,001
"Your mischievous glances aplenty."

1936
02:02:17,039 --> 02:02:20,150
"Lift me up on my tiptoes dainty."

1937
02:02:20,188 --> 02:02:22,530
"Not fair what you're doing to me!"

1938
02:02:22,569 --> 02:02:23,913
"You bet!"

1939
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:26,025
"Get set!"

1940
02:02:27,906 --> 02:02:29,135
"Endlessly."

1941
02:02:30,556 --> 02:02:31,823
"Tirelessly."

1942
02:02:33,282 --> 02:02:34,396
"Relentlessly."

1943
02:02:35,778 --> 02:02:36,623
"Limitlessly!"

1944
02:02:36,624 --> 02:02:38,543
"When clouds gather dense and gray."

1945
02:02:39,311 --> 02:02:41,154
"When you glare at me in that way."

1946
02:02:41,846 --> 02:02:44,778
"When the river bubbles animatedly
2 goats check each other out excitedly."

1947
02:02:44,802 --> 02:02:47,452
"My heart dances upbeat
Flutters for a feisty treat."

1948
02:02:47,490 --> 02:02:50,217
"Indian mulberry tree
blesses you and me."

1949
02:02:50,255 --> 02:02:52,444
"Indian mulberry tree
on a showering happiness spree."

1950
02:02:52,482 --> 02:02:53,634
"Continuously."

1951
02:02:53,673 --> 02:02:55,094
"Generously."

1952
02:02:55,132 --> 02:02:56,284
"Seriously, trust me!"

1953
02:02:57,666 --> 02:02:58,857
"Rock it."

1954
02:03:00,354 --> 02:03:01,430
"Benefit."

1955
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:04,119
"Don't quit."

1956
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:06,614
"That's the spirit!"

1957
02:03:20,015 --> 02:03:24,546
"Pecking your crest to woo you
Eyes like betel nut brand a tattoo."

1958
02:03:25,391 --> 02:03:28,118
"The coast is clear here
If you nod 'yes', I'll come near."

1959
02:03:28,156 --> 02:03:30,230
"The coast is clear, dear."

1960
02:03:30,306 --> 02:03:33,494
"If you nod 'yes', I'll come near"

1961
02:03:33,532 --> 02:03:36,604
"I'll kiss you, mister
my handsome rooster."

1962
02:03:58,146 --> 02:04:06,146
"In the path by the stream lush green
2 quails quietly shelter unseen."

1963
02:04:14,198 --> 02:04:18,806
"If I whistle loudly to call you
I may cause attention undue."

1964
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:22,300
"I signalled with my breath, dear
Did your soul not hear?"

1965
02:04:22,377 --> 02:04:24,565
"I signalled with my life, dear."

1966
02:04:24,566 --> 02:04:27,676
"Did your heart not hear?"

1967
02:04:27,791 --> 02:04:30,364
"Did your soul not hear?"

1968
02:04:30,441 --> 02:04:33,206
"Did your mind not hear?"

1969
02:04:33,282 --> 02:04:35,970
"Did your conscience not hear?"

1970
02:04:46,146 --> 02:04:47,414
"Elatedly?"

1971
02:04:48,911 --> 02:04:50,294
"Delightedly?"

1972
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:53,174
"Wholeheartedly!"

1973
02:04:54,249 --> 02:04:55,516
"Fun & frolic."

1974
02:04:55,938 --> 02:04:58,358
"Weave your magic!"

1975
02:05:07,377 --> 02:05:08,605
Balu...!

1976
02:05:10,794 --> 02:05:11,946
Aiya...?

1977
02:05:12,829 --> 02:05:13,866
Aiya.

1978
02:05:14,557 --> 02:05:15,557
Aiyaaa!

1979
02:05:15,671 --> 02:05:16,785
Send immediately.

1980
02:05:16,823 --> 02:05:18,513
Aiya...?

1981
02:05:18,551 --> 02:05:20,548
Our aiya called you by name.

1982
02:05:20,663 --> 02:05:22,161
- What?
- Yes, aiya.

1983
02:05:22,775 --> 02:05:24,388
'Bro, what happened?'

1984
02:05:27,421 --> 02:05:29,764
Aiya... aiya!

1985
02:05:30,877 --> 02:05:31,953
Look at me, aiya

1986
02:05:32,183 --> 02:05:34,295
I heard him He said 'Balu'

1987
02:05:34,679 --> 02:05:36,023
Aiya, Balu is here.

1988
02:05:36,983 --> 02:05:39,633
Aiya, what happened?

1989
02:05:42,436 --> 02:05:43,549
Aiya.

1990
02:05:43,626 --> 02:05:45,085
Call the doctor.

1991
02:05:45,124 --> 02:05:46,775
Doctor, come fast - Aiya.

1992
02:05:46,813 --> 02:05:48,618
Doctor, check what's wrong.

1993
02:05:49,271 --> 02:05:51,268
Aiya's BP level is very low.

1994
02:05:51,306 --> 02:05:53,149
Let us not risk it
Rush him to the hospital.

1995
02:05:53,188 --> 02:05:54,532
Uncle, get the car.

1996
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:56,145
Start the vehicle, quick.

1997
02:05:56,913 --> 02:05:58,103
Aiya.

1998
02:06:05,783 --> 02:06:07,780
- Aiya...!
- Look at me.

1999
02:06:08,317 --> 02:06:09,545
Aiya... aiya.

2000
02:06:09,546 --> 02:06:12,119
- Take the short cut.
- Hey, take the short route.

2001
02:06:20,913 --> 02:06:22,602
Doctor, keep an eye.

2002
02:06:35,121 --> 02:06:36,426
Who is that?

2003
02:06:36,695 --> 02:06:38,231
Looks like aiya's car.

2004
02:06:38,845 --> 02:06:40,458
Taking the short cut?

2005
02:06:41,572 --> 02:06:43,530
Is your aiya in his death bed?

2006
02:06:44,183 --> 02:06:45,719
You want to go fast?

2007
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,754
Did he suffer a stroke?

2008
02:06:49,137 --> 02:06:51,402
Wondering how I know all this?

2009
02:06:51,709 --> 02:06:54,513
When you can watch
the entire festival on CCTV

2010
02:06:54,551 --> 02:06:56,970
can't I do the same
to that single house of yours?

2011
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:01,233
If your father's life
is important to you...

2012
02:07:01,309 --> 02:07:02,884
his life is important to me.

2013
02:07:04,804 --> 02:07:06,724
Handover the life I need.

2014
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,412
You go with the life
you hold as priority.

2015
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:14,173
What, man? Thinking for so long?

2016
02:07:14,634 --> 02:07:16,477
Looks like you'll kill your father.

2017
02:07:17,668 --> 02:07:19,549
You have only 1 father, right?

2018
02:07:21,162 --> 02:07:23,044
Sir, aiya is critical now.

2019
02:07:23,121 --> 02:07:25,117
- Need to leave at once.
- Yov! Doctor.

2020
02:07:25,309 --> 02:07:27,613
Tell him, it's urgent.

2021
02:07:28,151 --> 02:07:30,724
Is his life more precious to you
than your father's?

2022
02:07:30,762 --> 02:07:31,922
Aiya's life is more precious.

2023
02:07:31,953 --> 02:07:33,565
Let me go - Anbu, wait.

2024
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:39,825
Our aiya's life is no different
from the word he has given.

2025
02:07:41,053 --> 02:07:43,204
I will uphold my father's vow.

2026
02:07:43,741 --> 02:07:46,391
He will be saved by
our village deity Vettaikaruppu.

2027
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:48,541
How do you think that's possible?

2028
02:07:48,657 --> 02:07:50,001
Let us watch him do so.

2029
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:51,421
Hey! Take him.

2030
02:07:55,415 --> 02:07:57,412
Hey Sonai What are you doing?

2031
02:07:57,450 --> 02:07:58,756
Hey...!

2032
02:07:58,794 --> 02:08:01,905
Go... if you come near me
I will slit her throat.

2033
02:08:01,981 --> 02:08:03,556
Hey! Listen to me... don't.

2034
02:08:03,594 --> 02:08:05,437
Hey... go away.

2035
02:08:09,239 --> 02:08:10,621
Aiya... forgive me

2036
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:12,081
I hit him accidentally

2037
02:08:12,273 --> 02:08:14,039
I swear, I aimed only at Anbu.

2038
02:08:14,269 --> 02:08:16,612
At that moment
aiya came in between.

2039
02:08:17,495 --> 02:08:20,221
I don't have the guts to stand
in front of aiya and fight.

2040
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:21,681
If this news leaks out...

2041
02:08:21,719 --> 02:08:24,637
the entire village will
burn my family alive.

2042
02:08:24,714 --> 02:08:27,940
Instead of getting killed by someone
I would rather be killed by you!

2043
02:08:27,978 --> 02:08:30,474
That will be the only way
to atone for my sin.

2044
02:08:30,513 --> 02:08:32,548
It must have been an accident.

2045
02:08:32,625 --> 02:08:36,503
In all these 7 villages who has the guts
to oppose him face to face and kill him?

2046
02:08:36,925 --> 02:08:38,077
He is a tiger.

2047
02:08:39,652 --> 02:08:41,687
You must have done it unknowingly.

2048
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:46,948
Our clan is known to protect the lives of
those who climb our steps seeking help.

2049
02:08:47,485 --> 02:08:50,058
We are not here to
snuff the life out of anyone.

2050
02:08:50,711 --> 02:08:53,937
Pray to Vettaikaruppu
nothing should happen to our aiya.

2051
02:08:54,013 --> 02:08:55,050
Go.

2052
02:08:56,548 --> 02:08:58,660
Aiya, I won't go anywhere
near Pechi's house

2053
02:08:58,698 --> 02:09:00,388
I'll go away to some far off place.

2054
02:09:00,465 --> 02:09:01,732
Go back to that house.

2055
02:09:04,650 --> 02:09:06,685
Be there till I give you
further instructions.

2056
02:09:08,106 --> 02:09:09,143
Go.

2057
02:09:10,986 --> 02:09:12,868
'Hey! Listen Remove the knife'

2058
02:09:12,906 --> 02:09:14,865
No... no... don't - Move away.

2059
02:09:14,903 --> 02:09:17,437
- Start the vehicle.
- Leave now, aiya.

2060
02:09:20,356 --> 02:09:22,506
Hey, start the vehicle fast.

2061
02:09:25,117 --> 02:09:26,346
Hey listen - Keep going.

2062
02:09:26,385 --> 02:09:28,074
- Go fast.
- Why are you watching?

2063
02:09:28,113 --> 02:09:29,113
Come this side.

2064
02:09:29,149 --> 02:09:30,916
Go, go... fast... quick.

2065
02:09:30,954 --> 02:09:33,220
- Go fast... go.
- Listen, let her go.

2066
02:09:33,335 --> 02:09:35,677
Pechi, are you alright?
Not hurt, no?

2067
02:09:54,877 --> 02:09:57,105
- Follow my instructions.
- Okay, doctor.

2068
02:09:57,220 --> 02:09:59,178
He is unconscious Please wait.

2069
02:09:59,831 --> 02:10:01,789
Sir, he isn't in a position to talk.

2070
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:04,170
- Come with us, doctor.
- We'll explain.

2071
02:10:19,645 --> 02:10:20,645
Aiya.

2072
02:10:21,873 --> 02:10:25,290
Even after your neck was slashed
and seeing all that blood gush out.

2073
02:10:25,636 --> 02:10:28,017
I kept quiet
bound by your words.

2074
02:10:29,284 --> 02:10:30,628
Concurring with your wish

2075
02:10:30,666 --> 02:10:33,201
these 3 days of the festival
went by real smooth.

2076
02:10:35,581 --> 02:10:37,617
I lived up to the word I gave you.

2077
02:10:38,653 --> 02:10:40,804
Now I ask you this as your son.

2078
02:10:43,338 --> 02:10:46,295
Tomorrow is the last day
of the festival and I want you there.

2079
02:10:47,370 --> 02:10:50,250
If our worship of our village deity
Vettaikaruppu is really true.

2080
02:10:52,439 --> 02:10:54,705
The festival should conclude
with your presence.

2081
02:10:59,965 --> 02:11:04,228
I don't know about doctor, treatment
and medicines prescribed for you.

2082
02:11:05,610 --> 02:11:07,031
But I know this for sure.

2083
02:11:08,337 --> 02:11:09,757
When I talk, you can hear me.

2084
02:11:12,138 --> 02:11:14,365
I am sure you will preside tomorrow.

2085
02:11:15,709 --> 02:11:17,053
You have to come.

2086
02:11:18,244 --> 02:11:19,511
And share our joy.

2087
02:11:21,585 --> 02:11:22,813
You will come.

2088
02:11:43,665 --> 02:11:46,390
It's time for the prayer
and procession to the river.

2089
02:11:46,391 --> 02:11:47,812
Will aiya come now?

2090
02:11:48,964 --> 02:11:50,116
'Aiya... aiya'

2091
02:11:50,269 --> 02:11:52,957
Our bull Muthu broke free
and is amidst the crowd now.

2092
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:02,749
Muthu, stop.

2093
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:10,545
Muthu... listen to me.

2094
02:12:37,117 --> 02:12:38,500
Take Muthu away.

2095
02:12:47,255 --> 02:12:49,060
Something has happened to aiya.

2096
02:12:49,137 --> 02:12:50,826
Aiya... what happened to you?

2097
02:12:52,132 --> 02:12:53,553
You took us for a royal ride?

2098
02:12:53,591 --> 02:12:55,012
You blindfolded us for 3 days?

2099
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:56,279
Enough of this masquerade.

2100
02:12:56,317 --> 02:12:58,737
You enacted a drama
and made us look like fools.

2101
02:12:58,775 --> 02:12:59,965
Bro, leave it.

2102
02:13:00,004 --> 02:13:01,540
Must be the work of Thekkur men.

2103
02:13:01,578 --> 02:13:02,999
Hey... take out your sickles.

2104
02:13:03,037 --> 02:13:05,764
They assaulted our aiya
We should spare none of them.

2105
02:13:05,802 --> 02:13:06,877
We agree.

2106
02:13:06,916 --> 02:13:08,068
Hey stop!

2107
02:13:14,481 --> 02:13:18,244
If my son had sought revenge
the moment he saw me almost bleed to death.

2108
02:13:19,357 --> 02:13:21,508
For his speed and rage

2109
02:13:22,237 --> 02:13:24,657
he wouldn't have spared
a single soul in that village.

2110
02:13:25,770 --> 02:13:26,770
But...

2111
02:13:27,229 --> 02:13:29,841
bound by that single word of mine

2112
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:35,946
he has conducted this festival
in the most effective, non-violent manner.

2113
02:13:37,444 --> 02:13:39,940
He carried a load
way beyond his age.

2114
02:13:41,437 --> 02:13:43,473
Till this function concludes today.

2115
02:13:44,663 --> 02:13:46,813
I don't want any sound
of weapons clashing.

2116
02:13:48,733 --> 02:13:50,116
You start your procession.

2117
02:13:53,265 --> 02:13:55,991
I asked for only a son
to our deity Vettaikaruppu.

2118
02:13:56,797 --> 02:13:58,602
He gave me a father instead!

2119
02:14:00,791 --> 02:14:03,172
He is your friend, philosopher
and guide for our clan.

2120
02:14:06,205 --> 02:14:07,396
Give it to him.

2121
02:14:34,391 --> 02:14:35,391
Bro.

2122
02:14:35,965 --> 02:14:37,117
Karumayi anna!

2123
02:14:37,463 --> 02:14:39,575
Paraman is missing
He has escaped.

2124
02:14:39,690 --> 02:14:41,687
What are you saying?
Hey, go and search.

2125
02:14:41,764 --> 02:14:44,721
- Hey come on, let's go.
- Go and search

2126
02:14:44,836 --> 02:14:46,525
I am the one who untied him.

2127
02:15:08,913 --> 02:15:10,103
Hey... run.

2128
02:15:10,218 --> 02:15:11,946
Cover them.

2129
02:15:12,791 --> 02:15:15,402
Don't let him escape.

2130
02:15:16,017 --> 02:15:17,092
Hold hands.

2131
02:15:18,013 --> 02:15:19,933
Aiya... where is Anbu?

2132
02:15:20,394 --> 02:15:22,199
Anbu.

2133
02:15:22,468 --> 02:15:25,617
The man you've been protecting
has been kidnapped now.

2134
02:15:25,655 --> 02:15:27,153
We can't be patient any longer.

2135
02:15:27,191 --> 02:15:28,919
We must destroy the entire clan.

2136
02:15:28,996 --> 02:15:31,031
It's do or die, aiya.

2137
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:36,714
I don't want any of you to go.

2138
02:15:36,753 --> 02:15:38,212
He will handle it singlehanded.

2139
02:15:39,863 --> 02:15:41,399
This is aiya's vow.

2140
02:15:41,476 --> 02:15:43,626
With our village deity
as witness I ask you.

2141
02:15:43,933 --> 02:15:48,503
Without a single soul being alive wipe
them out and meet me at the river bank.

2142
02:18:01,405 --> 02:18:03,517
Anbu, sit over there.

2143
02:18:11,773 --> 02:18:13,655
Don't move an inch
till I ask you to

2144
02:18:15,575 --> 02:18:17,956
3 hours remaining for the festival to end.

2145
02:18:18,417 --> 02:18:20,721
Any number of you
present here can come.

2146
02:18:21,796 --> 02:18:22,948
He is right here.

2147
02:18:23,025 --> 02:18:24,215
Aim your sickle at him

2148
02:18:24,676 --> 02:18:26,865
if the sickles you honed
are sharp enough.

2149
02:18:26,903 --> 02:18:29,092
If the moustaches you twirled
are brave enough.

2150
02:18:31,434 --> 02:18:32,701
Isn't it a 7 year feud?

2151
02:18:33,738 --> 02:18:35,005
It shall be squared today.

2152
02:18:35,313 --> 02:18:37,156
Weren't you hounding us relentlessly?

2153
02:18:37,463 --> 02:18:39,345
I've made your target sit
right in front of you.

2154
02:18:39,383 --> 02:18:41,495
Come and hack him
if you have the guts.

2155
02:18:51,210 --> 02:18:54,167
"Good lord! Here comes the battle rooster."

2156
02:18:54,628 --> 02:18:57,585
"His swift blows so strong, I swear."

2157
02:18:57,623 --> 02:19:00,810
"He can flatten any foe
with just a look from head to toe."

2158
02:19:00,964 --> 02:19:04,650
"He's a veteran with a sickle
With any weapon he weaves a miracle."

2159
02:19:11,025 --> 02:19:14,404
"This tiger's cub don't underrate
The tempest just won't abate"

2160
02:19:15,210 --> 02:19:17,476
[song from 'Sandakozhi - I']

2161
02:19:17,668 --> 02:19:20,663
"He has the nerve in toto
to braid every vein of his foe."

2162
02:19:20,701 --> 02:19:24,503
"He will peel your skin
Send you reeling in a spin."

2163
02:21:23,313 --> 02:21:24,657
Is anyone left out?

2164
02:21:24,695 --> 02:21:26,154
Send... come on.

2165
02:21:28,612 --> 02:21:31,530
You have lived with enmity
festering in you for 7 years.

2166
02:21:31,953 --> 02:21:34,756
A woman is epitome of love, kindness,
sympathy and motherhood.

2167
02:21:34,794 --> 02:21:37,098
But I see this unrestrained
rage only in you.

2168
02:21:37,213 --> 02:21:39,556
You make an innocent hand
hold a sickle?

2169
02:21:40,439 --> 02:21:42,628
I could've convinced them
without resorting to blows.

2170
02:21:42,666 --> 02:21:46,506
But violence is the only language
you understand to acknowledge power.

2171
02:21:46,545 --> 02:21:48,196
That is why I pounded them first.

2172
02:21:48,234 --> 02:21:50,500
Let's put an end
to our feud with this festival.

2173
02:21:50,615 --> 02:21:52,343
You are piling up grave blunders.

2174
02:21:52,727 --> 02:21:53,727
Stop it.

2175
02:21:54,148 --> 02:21:55,377
It is wrong.

2176
02:21:56,490 --> 02:21:57,757
Grave blunder indeed!

2177
02:21:59,217 --> 02:22:00,829
All the actions so far are wrong.

2178
02:22:02,749 --> 02:22:06,935
Expecting so many men to finish this
I was watching from afar.

2179
02:22:07,703 --> 02:22:08,740
Wrong on my part.

2180
02:22:09,239 --> 02:22:11,773
That was wrong on my part.

2181
02:22:22,026 --> 02:22:23,026
Aiya.

2182
02:22:47,370 --> 02:22:48,522
Face me.

2183
02:22:48,561 --> 02:22:51,556
Do you compare women to
cows, peahens and koels?

2184
02:22:52,516 --> 02:22:53,860
Even we are lions.

2185
02:22:53,937 --> 02:22:55,281
Lioness!

2186
02:22:56,164 --> 02:22:58,890
Only if a man swings a sickle
is it a weapon to reckon with?

2187
02:22:59,005 --> 02:23:00,234
Sickles of our household...

2188
02:23:00,273 --> 02:23:02,423
will work wonders
even in a woman's hand.

2189
02:23:04,573 --> 02:23:05,610
Stop it.

2190
02:23:12,983 --> 02:23:14,250
Listen to me.

2191
02:23:19,703 --> 02:23:20,625
Stop this.

2192
02:23:20,663 --> 02:23:21,623
Listen to me.

2193
02:23:21,661 --> 02:23:22,698
Drop the sickle.

2194
02:23:23,313 --> 02:23:25,732
Didn't you come to fight?
Why do you want a truce?

2195
02:23:25,770 --> 02:23:27,498
You hacked so many men

2196
02:23:27,537 --> 02:23:29,533
I am a solitary woman
Face me... fight.

2197
02:23:29,572 --> 02:23:30,877
Appease my sickle.

2198
02:23:30,954 --> 02:23:32,452
You keep interfering.

2199
02:23:48,657 --> 02:23:50,615
Scared you're unarmed, huh?

2200
02:23:50,845 --> 02:23:51,845
Take this.

2201
02:23:56,605 --> 02:23:58,986
Show off your skill
Let's gauge your bravery.

2202
02:23:59,255 --> 02:24:00,292
Come.

2203
02:24:09,201 --> 02:24:10,621
COME ON...!

2204
02:24:13,732 --> 02:24:15,652
I am telling you to stop this.

2205
02:24:30,321 --> 02:24:32,740
Hey... come on... fight.

2206
02:24:36,465 --> 02:24:38,730
Why are you going
out of your way to save him?

2207
02:24:38,807 --> 02:24:40,573
Is he your elder or younger brother?

2208
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:44,375
Father and son claim you've given your word

2209
02:24:44,452 --> 02:24:46,909
I made a vow too
when my husband was killed.

2210
02:24:48,983 --> 02:24:50,442
His head will be chopped now.

2211
02:24:50,481 --> 02:24:52,170
Try to save him if you can.

2212
02:24:58,161 --> 02:24:59,236
Don't!

2213
02:25:38,826 --> 02:25:40,285
You blamed me for interfering.

2214
02:25:40,324 --> 02:25:41,745
If I hadn't interfered now?!

2215
02:25:43,895 --> 02:25:45,815
A sickle can't tell
north from south!

2216
02:25:45,853 --> 02:25:49,002
It slashes according to
the course of the wind, that's it.

2217
02:25:50,730 --> 02:25:53,265
You wanted his entire clan to perish.

2218
02:25:53,303 --> 02:25:55,108
Your clan would have been wiped out.

2219
02:25:57,642 --> 02:25:59,677
You wanted to know
if he was my brother?

2220
02:26:00,177 --> 02:26:00,945
Yes.

2221
02:26:01,175 --> 02:26:04,593
We must regard all those born on our soil
as siblings sharing the same blood.

2222
02:26:04,631 --> 02:26:06,205
Don't discriminate.

2223
02:26:07,857 --> 02:26:09,469
Still not satisfied with the bloodbath.

2224
02:26:09,508 --> 02:26:11,005
If your rage has not abated.

2225
02:26:11,236 --> 02:26:14,423
Take the sharpest sickle lying here
and hack me first.

2226
02:26:14,692 --> 02:26:16,074
Then kill him.

2227
02:26:20,836 --> 02:26:22,525
I have never seen my mother.

2228
02:26:23,562 --> 02:26:25,213
My father is my whole world.

2229
02:26:26,903 --> 02:26:28,669
Other than my father's feet

2230
02:26:29,245 --> 02:26:30,820
I've never fallen at anyone's feet.

2231
02:26:39,229 --> 02:26:41,994
I kneel down on this soil,
my motherland and I request you.

2232
02:26:42,724 --> 02:26:44,029
Forego everything.

2233
02:26:44,721 --> 02:26:46,602
Throw away your hurt and hatred.

2234
02:26:46,641 --> 02:26:48,868
For 7 years, this earth
has not seen rains.

2235
02:26:49,367 --> 02:26:52,477
Because the festival was held or
our vows to Vettaikaruppu were fulfilled

2236
02:26:52,516 --> 02:26:53,629
it won't rain.

2237
02:26:55,473 --> 02:26:57,393
Only when your enmity vanishes

2238
02:26:57,469 --> 02:26:58,621
heart softens.

2239
02:26:58,737 --> 02:27:00,772
When your eyes shed a drop of tear...

2240
02:27:01,962 --> 02:27:04,151
only then rain-god will
bless our village.

2241
02:28:03,633 --> 02:28:06,359
He solved all the issues
once and for all
