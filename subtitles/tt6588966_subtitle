1
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,994
Ma'am, sir will see you now.

2
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,376
Thank you.

3
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,730
Ms. Naina Mathur. Please sit.

4
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,942
Double Bachelors in Education.

5
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,277
And Masters in Science.
Impressive.

6
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,154
Thank you, sir.

7
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,034
Some water? It'll stop your hiccups.

8
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,830
It's not a hiccup, sir.
I have Tourette syndrome.

9
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,083
Huh? What syndrome?

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,586
Umm... It's a neurological
condition ma'am.

11
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,674
Sometimes when the wires in the
brain have a loose-connection...

12
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,467
...they give a shock.

13
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
So... how does it stop?

14
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,639
Sir, this isn't something that stops.

15
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,477
It does get worse - when
I am nervous... like right now.

16
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,480
So you make noises
even when you sleep?

17
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,734
No sir, when I sleep,
even my brain sleeps.

18
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,987
But how long will we keep sleeping?

19
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,156
WE?

20
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,159
Yes sir. Me and... my Tourette's.

21
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,828
Does it affect your eating or drinking?

22
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,039
We manage well ma'am.

23
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,875
I do the eating,
he does the drinking.

24
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,466
Well Ms. Naina, we'll call you.

25
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,218
Ok sir. Thank you for your time.

26
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,678
Thanks for coming.

27
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,932
A friendly advice Ms. Mathur,
if you don't mind.

28
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,311
Teaching jobs might be difficult
to get with... this.

29
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,605
You could try a different profession.

30
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,190
Hope you understand.

31
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,068
Sir, can I ask you all something?

32
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,319
Yup.

33
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:19,741
Did any of you know anything
about Tourette's before today?

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,242
No, not at all...

35
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,577
And now?

36
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,829
Well... now we do.

37
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,043
So, if I can teach something new
to Principals and Trustees,

38
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,587
I'm sure I'll be able to manage
children sir.

39
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,590
Thank you.

40
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,015
Busy-birdy, she flies away.

41
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,810
Busy-birdy's not gonna stay.

42
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,858
Busy-birdy, she flies away.

43
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,194
Busy-birdy's not gonna stay.

44
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,655
Won't budge an inch,

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,241
How she swerves and sways!

46
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,576
It's slowly gonna come together.

47
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,079
Why ruffle feathers?

48
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,331
Fate's gonna give you a call.

49
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,085
Why worry at all?!

50
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,090
Naina, don't work in the dark!

51
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,051
Why do you never listen?
You'll ruin your eyes my child.

52
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,177
Ma!

53
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,309
This is Chicken Amritsari,
this is stuffed potato.

54
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,313
And Didi, check out the filling,
this is keema marinated in vinegar.

55
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,442
Leave your experiments
in your restaurant's kitchen.

56
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,068
This kitchen - is my kitchen!

57
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,112
What a line... This kitchen -
is my kitchen!!!

58
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,197
Lick your fingers,
before you scold me!

59
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,949
It's slowly gonna come together.

60
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,452
Why ruffle your feathers?

61
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,037
Ms. Mathur,

62
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,832
the kids won't stop laughing
at these noises you make.

63
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,834
When will they study?

64
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,129
Ma'am, I'll make sure instead
of laughing at me,

65
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,591
I will teach them to laugh with me.

66
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,594
Don't let go now,
we're halfway there.

67
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,096
The road calls...
will you dare?

68
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,057
I can offer you the job,

69
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,144
but you will have to stop
making these noises.

70
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,941
Sir, actually even you have
a disorder...

71
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,444
IGNORANCE!

72
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,072
Along with new teachers,

73
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,282
this school also needs
a new Principal!

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,909
Good day, sir.

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,786
Why worry at all?!

76
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,011
Why worry at all?!

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,271
The tiny ant may slip and fall,

78
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,566
and yet it carries
every grain up the wall.

79
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,155
Quiet!

80
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,990
Shut up everybody.

81
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,159
Stand up Naina.

82
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,871
Why do you keep making
these noises in class?

83
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,374
Waa-waa all the time!

84
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,045
And you guys, why do you have
to laugh at every little thing?!

85
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,839
Sit down.

86
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,886
The ant's persistence
gives her strength...

87
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,938
Quiet I say!

88
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,774
See, let me be honest.

89
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,236
With her condition, it's difficult
for other kids in the class...

90
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,571
- ...and Naina as well.
- But sir...

91
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,701
I'm giving you this Leaving Certificate
without mentioning the reason.

92
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,000
Maybe she needs a different
kind of school, Mrs. Mathur.

93
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,298
Bye.

94
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,592
Bye.

95
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,970
Papa, this one.

96
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:09,971
Naina?

97
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,348
Papa, I...

98
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,688
One chocolate cake please.

99
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,112
Why don't you get it Sudha?

100
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,156
Naina needs a special school.

101
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,451
Naina needs a normal school.
A normal life.

102
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,703
She's a normal girl, Prabhakar.

103
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,247
Normal! With those tics?!

104
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,376
She's constantly ashamed
of these noises.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,504
She's ashamed?
Or are you?!

106
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,258
Have you forgotten,
why we separated?

107
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,969
Look... Naina is still my daughter.

108
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,306
Yes, she is, so where were
you all these years?

109
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,849
When she needed you.

110
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,419
Didi. Dad is here.

111
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,212
I'm not well.

112
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,881
At least come and say hi.

113
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,341
Can I say Hi and Bye together?

114
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,135
Ya, okay. Come now!

115
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,347
Just go, I'll come.
Please leave me Vinay! Please!

116
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,652
What's wrong? All okay?

117
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,071
Just a normal cold.

118
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,573
She's fine.

119
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,869
Stress. What else!

120
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,751
Take this.

121
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,798
I have a friend in banking.
It's a job offer... for you.

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,718
Open it.

123
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,684
Naina, part time animator.

124
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,686
That's not a job!

125
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:28,735
Part time because I need time...
to look for teaching openings.

126
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,698
You've been looking for teaching
openings for 5 years now.

127
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,701
With your condition -

128
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,080
Vinay, you'll have more rotis no?

129
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,915
Err, okay.

130
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,591
Why don't you talk to her?

131
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,478
There's enough dough
in the fridge, Naina!

132
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,939
Just read it once?

133
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,817
Sorry, my hands are dirty.
I'll read it later.

134
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,112
How much is a teacher's
salary anyway?

135
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,992
Dad, did you have a favourite
teacher in school or college?

136
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,119
Of course!

137
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,623
You remember his salary?

138
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,337
Forget it Dad.

139
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,881
You'll never get it.

140
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,925
Ya, I'll never get...

141
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,970
...why a M.Sc., B.Ed. is making
cartoons at home!

142
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,723
Hello. One second...

143
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,850
Didi, St. Notker's!

144
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,272
Her hands are not dirty anymore?

145
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,733
No sir, that's my dog.

146
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,527
It's time for his lunch, no?

147
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,365
Yes, of course, I'll be there.
What time?

148
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,701
Day after, 11? I'll be there sir...

149
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,371
...but you need a teacher
in mid-term?

150
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,249
No... no sir, I don't have a problem,
I'll be there!!

151
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,876
Yes, yes, of course sir.

152
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,213
What happened?

153
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,633
I got the job!!!

154
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,845
No, no. No way, Didi!!

155
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,559
Life is a circle, really!!

156
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,603
I got the job!!!

157
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,513
Your qualifications are excellent
Ms. Mathur.

158
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,681
Thank you, sir.

159
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,432
And I like your spirit.

160
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,726
We are willing to give you
a chance.

161
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,895
Thank you, sir!! Thank you.

162
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,606
Also because we...
badly need a teacher.

163
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,566
Mr. Wadia! Please.

164
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,777
You can begin.

165
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,779
You have Tourette syndrome?

166
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,072
Yes sir!

167
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,533
I just want to know,

168
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:27,205
you said you've applied to 18 schools
with no success.

169
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,626
Even St. Notker's has rejected
you 5 times.

170
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,130
I'm just curious, with your condition,

171
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,009
why do you want to be a teacher?

172
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,220
Because of that chair sir.

173
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,764
You want to be the Principal?

174
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,016
Oh! No sir.

175
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,895
Like the 18 schools
that have rejected me,

176
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,442
I was thrown out of 12 schools
as a student.

177
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,695
This school was my lucky number 13.

178
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,616
I sit here in front of you,
wanting to be a teacher,

179
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,620
because Mr. Khan, who sat
in that chair 22 years ago,

180
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,498
taught me the biggest lesson
of my life.

181
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,251
Who is here so vile,
that is not a...

182
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,258
Good countrymen,
let me depart alone.

183
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,386
And, for my sake,
stay here with Antony.

184
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,477
Congratulations for this
wonderful performance.

185
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,731
Now tell me,
during this performance...

186
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:39,194
...did any of you hear
some peculiar noises?

187
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,283
Whoever was making those noises,
please come on stage.

188
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,454
Come to the stage immediately.

189
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,809
What's your name?

190
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,228
Naina Mathur, sir.

191
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,563
Can you stop these hiccups, please?

192
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,856
I can't sir.

193
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,400
Why not?

194
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,610
I have Tourette syndrome, sir.

195
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,779
I have never heard about it.

196
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,156
Sir, it's a neurological problem,

197
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,076
because of which I get...
like an electric shock.

198
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,994
What do other students say to you?

199
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,664
They laugh at me,
and tease me sir.

200
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,666
And teachers?

201
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,961
They throw me out of the class sir.

202
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,258
Tell me, what can we do for you?

203
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,093
How can we help you?

204
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:51,766
Sir, just treat me like the
rest of the students. Please.

205
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,101
My child,

206
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,979
this is a school.

207
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,189
Everyone comes here to learn,

208
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,611
but today you have taught us
something.

209
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,240
On behalf of St. Notker's
I promise you,

210
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,036
we will treat you just like
the other students.

211
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,204
Okay?

212
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,998
Go back.

213
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,922
A normal teacher only teaches you,

214
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,467
a good teacher makes you understand,

215
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:30,263
if he's great - then he'll show you
how to apply it.

216
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,976
But some teachers inspire us.

217
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,813
For me Mr. Khan is that kind
of a teacher.

218
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,484
Mr. Khan was an inspiration
for all of us.

219
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,403
To me, he still is sir.

220
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,491
Sir, I assure you sir,
I won't let you down.

221
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,368
I was born to be a teacher sir!

222
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:57,082
Ms. Mathur... will you be able
to manage with these sounds?

223
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,502
I mean I've never seen a teacher
with a speech defect.

224
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,964
Tourette's affects my speech sir.
Not my intellect.

225
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,427
Come with me Ms. Mathur.

226
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,263
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.

227
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,810
Bad choice!

228
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,189
Good morning, sir.

229
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,742
National Science Fair?

230
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,995
St. Notker's has won it
for the last 2 years.

231
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,332
All credit to Mr. Wadia -
our science team in charge.

232
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,668
We're expecting a hat-trick
this year.

233
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,383
9A.

234
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,094
The school's brightest students.

235
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,513
All the toppers are from here.

236
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,309
Sir... I was in 9 C.

237
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,897
Sir, F division?

238
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,860
There was no F division, before?

239
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,697
Well, thanks to the Right
to Education initiative - we do now.

240
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,283
Just 14 kids.

241
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,493
Just 14?

242
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:20,415
But... why is this class empty?

243
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,168
Because their class teacher
is on leave.

244
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,795
Permanent leave...

245
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,924
I'll be honest with you,
I urgently need a teacher,

246
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,011
which is why I'm offering you
this job mid-term, Ms. Mathur.

247
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,431
I see a spark in you,
and I'm willing to take the risk.

248
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,934
I wouldn't offer this job to you
under normal circumstances.

249
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,645
But neither are the circumstances
normal,

250
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,148
and nor is this class - 9F.

251
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,108
I'd say, think it through.

252
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,652
Sir, I've thought it through.

253
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,989
I really want the job
and I'll not let you down.

254
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,950
They're just kids...

255
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,328
How bad can it be?

256
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,107
Ma'am, you're going to teach 9F?

257
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:28,942
Ya, why?

258
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,570
Nothing. It's great.

259
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,576
Ma'am...

260
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:43,081
9F is upstairs. This way.

261
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,041
I know.

262
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,170
It's so dirty,
why don't they clean it?!

263
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,965
Someone tell that Shyamlal to clean it
everyday for us!

264
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,469
The echo here is the bomb, man!

265
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,187
Got a smoke?

266
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,981
What should I call these guys?

267
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,860
You rack your brains,
they're your rats!

268
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,154
I got a smoke...

269
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,822
When did you start smoking?

270
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,408
No ya, I am just holding them
for Killam.

271
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,668
Bro, the cops raided us yesterday...
we had to scoot!

272
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,128
They gonna get you one day man!

273
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,839
So what should I call them?

274
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,591
Wadia and Pareira!?

275
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,968
No, no, my rats will die
from the shock!

276
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,887
Hey! Don't smoke near
from my rats.

277
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,181
You'll ruin their lungs
like your own!

278
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,394
Ravinder! Wanna bet? That
stammering idiot won't survive a day.

279
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,687
Who told you she stammers?

280
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,230
The peon - Shyamlal.

281
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,983
Bro, trust Shyamlal only to smuggle
cigarettes! Not information.

282
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,151
Give.

283
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,572
If you don't know how to smoke,
why do you do it!?

284
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,949
Show me.

285
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,498
There you go.

286
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,169
Tamannah... what will you buy
if you win the bet?

287
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,297
There's a new nail polish shade...
Katrina Kaif wears it.

288
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,632
She wears what?!

289
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,594
Girl, the whole world wants
to see Katrina Kaif's fingers.

290
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,097
Who will you show your fingers to?
Those ladies-fingers!

291
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,978
Okay, guys, guys, guys! Listen up

292
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,356
10 cents on the buck -
Ms. Stammer won't last a day.

293
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,860
60 cents - if she lasts a week.
Who wants the action?

294
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:18,862
I'll take those odds.

295
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,613
- How much?
- Here's 10 bucks.

296
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,574
It's betting... not 'begging'!

297
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,325
Here's 30, now shut your mouth.

298
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,326
Here's my 20.

299
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,833
You won't bet on Ms. Stammer?

300
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,336
Who gonna bet?
Ms. Stammer is who 9F gonna get.

301
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,588
We gonna light a fire,
her eyes will be wet.

302
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,007
He's the punter,
and we gonna hunt her...

303
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,217
...cause we're no fakes,
like those 9A stunters.

304
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,636
Notker's is a pond,
we're its big bad sharks.

305
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,930
Stammer's a goldfish,
no bite, all barks.

306
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,600
In these waters,
we swim and surf.

307
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,977
Pipeline's our home,
Notker's our turf.

308
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,120
Don't push me!

309
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,789
Then stop being a tortoise!

310
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,707
- Move it!
- You move it!

311
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,172
I'm the wolf, you're the pack...
follow me!

312
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:59,087
Class, I'm your new teacher,
Naina Mathur.

313
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,632
What was that?

314
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:08,096
Education isn't limited to the
classroom or school hours.

315
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,767
So whenever you need me -
this is my number.

316
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,477
Sorry.

317
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,273
Madam... "whenever"?

318
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,655
Hey! Respect women's guys!

319
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,741
Yes. "Women's... women's!"

320
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,582
Let's do introductions
along with the roll call?

321
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,834
Aatish...

322
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,669
Present.

323
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,463
It's me, ma'am.

324
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,049
Ashwin...

325
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,800
Yea, yea, yea.

326
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,388
Arundhati.

327
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,390
Present ma'am.

328
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:54,768
Killam.

329
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,603
Cha woop woop...
present ma'am.

330
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,230
I got it right no?

331
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:07,655
Looks like, you are more interested
in my tics than roll call.

332
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,866
So let's start with that?

333
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,622
I have Tourette syndrome.

334
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,958
It's a neurological disorder.

335
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,462
When there are some loose
connections in our brain...

336
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,882
...it gives small shocks...
like that.

337
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:30,845
You can ask me anything you want
to know about my Tourette's.

338
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,182
Ma'am, what's your ring tone?

339
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,392
I'll tell you...

340
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:40,146
1, 2 cha cha cha...
3, 4, cha cha cha...!

341
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,653
Dude, these days my rats
also make the same noises.

342
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,822
You think they also have Tourette's?!

343
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:50,615
Ya! possibly.

344
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:54,577
Ma'am, have you heard rats
do the chee-choo rap?

345
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,079
Chee choon, chee choo,

346
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:56,996
the rats are going chee choo.

347
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,164
Hey teacher, going cha-cha,

348
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,332
this class just ain't for you.

349
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,458
We scratchin our heads,
me and my crew.

350
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,252
Is this a school,
or a bloody zoo.

351
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,295
Ms. Stammer, you stammerin.

352
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,589
Why you always yammerin.

353
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,175
C'mon be on your way,
you and your hiccups can't stay.

354
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,553
Hey Killam, she's such a bore,
can't do it, no more, no more!

355
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,013
Chee choon, chee choo,

356
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,180
the rats are going chee choo.

357
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,515
Hey teacher, goin cha-cha,

358
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,599
this class just ain't for you.

359
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:22,981
Chee choon, chee choo,

360
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,232
the rats are going chee choo.

361
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,817
Hey teacher, goin cha-cha,

362
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:26,860
this class just ain't for you.

363
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,361
Chee choon, chee choo,

364
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,362
the rats are going chee choo.

365
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,989
Hey teacher, goin cha-cha,

366
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,324
this class just ain't for you.

367
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,410
Why did you stop?

368
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,456
That was just like me. Exact.

369
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,207
The only difference is,

370
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:45,879
you can stop it any time you want -
but not me.

371
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:51,885
You know, there are bets being
placed on how long I'll last,

372
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,679
and why others didn't last.

373
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:59,267
But you guys don't know that
I haven't come here to quit.

374
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,353
I've come here to teach.

375
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,355
Ravinder,

376
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,108
here's my 100 bucks.

377
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,153
I'll bet on me staying.

378
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:11,529
Take it.

379
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,532
A real punter never goes back
on his word or his odds.

380
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:23,708
If your chee-choo rap is done,
shall we start the class?

381
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,351
Ma'am, this is just the first lecture.

382
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,687
For staying, you will have to first
get back on your feet.

383
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:44,938
C'mon get up.

384
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,856
That's right!

385
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,671
She's not going to leave that easily.

386
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,845
Stop staring bro,
she's out of our league.

387
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,972
She's the topper of 9A.

388
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,267
- I'm also the topper of 9F bro.
- Huh?

389
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,770
- At staring bro!
- Right!

390
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:31,818
Hey, F for failure! Pass the ball.

391
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,235
What's wrong man?

392
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,363
Why you fighting?

393
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,073
Look what he did to the ball?

394
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,371
It's not as bad as...

395
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,665
...what's gonna happen to you now!

396
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,640
Aatish.

397
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,101
Hey... hey...

398
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,272
Stop it at once! Stop it!!!

399
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,734
Get up, get up!

400
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,945
Sir, look what they did to the ball.

401
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:59,781
Don't worry sir, there's not a drop
of blood on the football.

402
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,074
Look!

403
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,872
You. Principal's Office.

404
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,624
Okay sir!

405
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,251
Come on, come on!

406
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,555
Come on.

407
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,092
Ma'am, you're early!

408
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:06,389
Ya... I needed to get some
books from the library, so...

409
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,435
So... you're going to hang
in a little more.

410
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:16,191
Shyamlal, I wanted to ask you
something.

411
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,610
What's the deal with 9F?

412
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:22,030
Who are these kids?

413
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,785
You see that playground, ma'am?

414
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,871
There used to be a government
municipal school there.

415
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,458
There's a slum near that sewer,
across the highway.

416
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,835
Things were perfect.

417
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,421
The garbage went into the sewer...

418
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,591
...and the kids from the slum
went to the municipal school.

419
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,178
Then one day they learned
the school was on leased land...

420
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,682
...and the kids' future
was now collateral.

421
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:53,770
So, St. Notker's management
rushed to the aid of the Municipality.

422
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,732
The government has come up with
something called Right to Education.

423
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,653
So the Municipal school students
became St. Notker's students,

424
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,533
and that land is now St. Notkers'
playground.

425
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,995
9F is the last batch
of these slum kids.

426
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:16,209
Their parents don't have a problem with
a separate division for these 14 kids?

427
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:20,463
Their parents have bigger problems
to worry about ma'am...

428
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:24,384
...like putting food on the table
and standing in line to fill water.

429
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,762
Ma'am, in the beginning,
these slum kids tried really hard...

430
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,849
...to keep up with the kids here.

431
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,686
But the kids here
never accepted them,

432
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,231
and even the teachers
didn't help much either.

433
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,901
So now the slum kids are rebelling.

434
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:46,489
You're their 8th class teacher
in the last 7 months.

435
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,660
Bloody dog!

436
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,419
But what's the matter?

437
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:03,882
- Oye?
- Ya?

438
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,508
- What's the answer for this?
- 3.

439
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:12,182
I'm little Tamil boy straight
from Chennai to Dharavi.

440
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,477
I'm too local, don't mess with me
and get killed.

441
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,271
I'll pop like soda bottle instantly
if you test me.

442
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:22,150
And it's us when it's all hip hop
wicked and wild in this city.

443
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,319
Aah... wild in the city.

444
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,614
Hear ye-hear ye, listen up!
Say what, what, what?!

445
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,366
You bring your A game,

446
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,825
but we the real playas!

447
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,995
Ma hommie's a little
slow off the bloc.

448
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,413
He no rabbit, he da tortoise...

449
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,873
he's gonna beat the clock!

450
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,459
Madam please, go easy,

451
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,712
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

452
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,882
Madam please, go easy,

453
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,843
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

454
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,225
You feel me bro?!

455
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,068
Vasco De Gama,
got no home or place.

456
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,654
He cries to his Mama,
cause we on his case.

457
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,032
Carrots and sticks,
for the lady with tics.

458
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,244
Here's a mango!
Make her do the tango!!!

459
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,581
No! I don't give 'Free massages'!
Wrong number!

460
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:20,542
Don't you give massages?

461
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,503
But don't be glum,
our time has come.

462
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,589
In this ring,
we're the only kings.

463
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,181
Madam please, go easy,

464
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,601
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

465
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:41,896
Madam please, go easy,

466
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,858
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

467
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:48,820
A solution is a homogenous mixture
of two or more substances.

468
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,491
Lemonade, soda and water,
are some examples of solutions.

469
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,172
If 9F is that interesting Natasha,
you can join them.

470
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,299
Sorry sir.

471
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,719
Madam please, go easy,

472
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,847
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

473
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,100
Madam please, go easy,

474
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,228
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

475
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,648
I'm little Tamil boy straight
from Chennai to Dharavi.

476
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,693
I'm too local, don't mess with me
and get killed.

477
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,780
I'll pop like soda bottle instantly
if you test me.

478
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,783
I'm a little boy but still I'll wear
my dhothi above my knee.

479
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,409
Sachin is the star of cricket.

480
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,952
But Rajinikanth is a superstar.

481
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,955
And it's us when it's all hip hop
wicked and wild in this city.

482
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,750
Madam please, go easy,

483
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,836
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

484
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,215
Madam please, go easy,

485
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,259
they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G!

486
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,262
So, are you able to tolerate 9F?

487
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,265
Sir, they're not that bad.

488
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't know, if they'll be able
to tolerate me.

489
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,356
FYI, that book isn't in the
9th grade syllabus.

490
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:53,445
I told you Ms. Mathur,
they don't belong here.

491
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,531
I'm sorry you had to suffer
because of them.

492
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,367
Principal sir also agrees,
they need to be suspended.

493
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah.

494
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,169
Sir, it's just so embarrassing sir.

495
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:11,671
Actually I was trying to explain...

496
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,966
...how Liquid Nitrogen expands
in my Chemistry class.

497
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:18,178
I'm so sorry, I didn't realize
it will explode.

498
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:24,809
I'm just so sorry sir.
They didn't do anything.

499
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,900
What exactly are you trying
to prove Ms. Mathur!

500
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,277
You think we're all fools?

501
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,988
The whole school should suffer
because of 9F?

502
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,283
Get to your classes. Move.

503
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,800
Ms. Mathur, we all know
this is their doing.

504
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:58,426
You do too.

505
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,762
You're still protecting them!

506
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:02,472
Yes sir.

507
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:08,019
Like you said, we all know
this prank might be their doing.

508
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:14,567
But sir, what they did requires
planning, foresight, intelligence.

509
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:19,197
Sir, I believe if we can find a way
to channelize this energy correctly,

510
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,617
they can make St. Notker's proud
one day... I assure you sir.

511
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,120
It's a fool's dream Ms. Mathur.

512
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,541
They don't belong here.
They never did and never will.

513
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,543
They will sir.

514
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:35,088
Maybe we just haven't tried
hard enough - they do belong.

515
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,841
Are you challenging me?

516
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,180
They just need some time...
and effort sir.

517
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:46,599
How much time?

518
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,059
Huh?

519
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:52,230
Set a deadline.
For 9F, and yourself.

520
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:56,860
Sir, 4 months. Till the final exams.

521
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,613
And after 4 months?

522
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:04,492
Sir, after the exams the results
will speak for themselves.

523
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,328
You can do what seems right.

524
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:11,791
But I get the next 4 months -
no questions asked.

525
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:13,418
Please sir.

526
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,841
Okay.

527
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,594
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

528
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,182
Hurts the ear, doesn't it?

529
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,479
I used to hear this in school.

530
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:19,150
17 years later, I heard
this noise again,

531
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,862
from the chalk, and from you all.

532
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,869
This is what you all have been
doing, right?

533
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:33,123
In school - in life...
Just screeching.

534
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:39,004
What're you trying to prove?

535
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,756
That no one can break you!?

536
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:47,303
It might come as a surprise to you...

537
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:52,058
...that nobody here is interested
in breaking you.

538
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:57,814
But yeah... we are interested
in teaching you.

539
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,154
You know what's amazing
about this chalk?

540
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:08,199
If you break a small part
from the tip...

541
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,247
It stops screeching.

542
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,129
A tiny piece.

543
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,465
A small change.

544
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:29,679
That's the difference between
'why' and 'why not'.

545
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,560
Final exams are 4 months away.

546
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,146
Now, you all have to decide -

547
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,566
if you want to make that
small change...

548
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:45,403
...or just keep screeching?

549
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,994
I'll see you guys,
at exactly 9 tomorrow.

550
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:55,955
If you guys aren't here,

551
00:40:56,331 --> 00:41:00,293
I'll hand over my resignation
to the Principal at 9:10.

552
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,880
But if you guys are here,

553
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,508
then we'll start over.

554
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:11,846
Not with 'Why', with 'why not'.

555
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:30,573
Naina ma'am is right.

556
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,368
If we really wanna make some noise,
let's pass the final exam.

557
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,370
Ms. Stammer is now ma'am?!

558
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:37,997
If it wasn't for her,
we'd be suspended!

559
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:38,873
So?!

560
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,962
You want to become a lab rat
for her Science project?!

561
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:48,675
I think none of us should
show up tomorrow.

562
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,378
Why're you guys not in school?

563
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,329
The Greek professor is known for...

564
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,878
Visionary poets of America.

565
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,756
...but away from each other.

566
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,883
What is this force called?

567
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:09,816
Shall we begin with Maths, today?

568
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:14,029
Like every year,

569
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,656
St. Notker's honours the students...

570
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:19,868
...who have set new standards
for academic excellence.

571
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,747
I would like to request, Head of the
Student Council Mr. Wadia,

572
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:26,833
to present the top students
with Prefect Badges...

573
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,210
and to say a few words
on this occasion.

574
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,796
Sunidhi Prabhakaran - 9A,

575
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,008
Natasha Khanna - 9A,

576
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,636
Akshay Verma - 9A,

577
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,307
Saad Mainani - 9A.

578
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:50,690
People look for role models
in history.

579
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:55,987
But your role models
are in front of you.

580
00:44:57,197 --> 00:45:01,534
To share the stage with such
top students must be your aim.

581
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,039
And the students on this stage,

582
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:10,877
you need to fulfill the responsibilities
of this Prefect Badge.

583
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:18,635
The responsibility of being
a true St. Notkerite.

584
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,097
When in doubt, remember:

585
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:27,977
the badge isn't for you -
you are for the badge.

586
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,116
Here?

587
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,540
C'mon in. Come, Come.

588
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:50,875
Quickly take your seats.

589
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:54,879
Let's have our class here today.

590
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,756
Isn't it lovely?

591
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,634
And today, we'll try a new roll call.

592
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:00,885
Ready?!

593
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:03,138
Aatish,

594
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:05,515
Killam,

595
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:06,725
Oru,

596
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:08,852
Tamannah,

597
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:09,853
Ashwin,

598
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:10,937
Ravinder,

599
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:11,730
Raghu,

600
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:13,606
Tara, Shagufta, Pankaj.

601
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,818
Well done my precious eggs!
Full attendance.

602
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:22,657
The eggs are boiled,
you can eat them if you like.

603
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:32,500
The egg could've gone anywhere
in the air, but all of you caught it.

604
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,794
Mathematically speaking...

605
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:38,673
...the equation of the egg's flight
is called Parabola.

606
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,844
You caught the egg without
reading the equation,

607
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:46,056
means you'll are already
Mathematicians.

608
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:47,515
We get an egg everyday now?

609
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:49,351
Now you just need to learn
the equation.

610
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:51,436
Yes ma'am, only Oru
doesn't understand.

611
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,021
She jumped out of the way!

612
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:55,690
No.

613
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:58,943
I can't touch eggs on Tuesdays!

614
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:03,239
But Oru taught us some Physics.

615
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,451
Oru applied force
to get out of the way.

616
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:09,204
Force=Mass x Acceleration.

617
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,874
Oru's taught us
Newton's Law of Motion.

618
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:17,087
Walking, sitting, getting up, running
we learn all of this early on.

619
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,339
Now just learn it as an equation.

620
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,384
Ma'am, if we know
everything already...

621
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,094
...then why are we wasting
our time in school?

622
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:25,804
I can walk in a straight line
anytime.

623
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:27,138
What say Pankaj?

624
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,601
Shouldn't you be in class?

625
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,854
Ya! Sorry sir.

626
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:41,861
You're not getting
what I'm trying to say.

627
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:44,948
We can try all we want ma'am,
but we'll never become 9A.

628
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,200
And we don't want to either.

629
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:52,414
This Prefect Badge
is just one big drama!

630
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,294
And what was that -
when in doubt, remember,

631
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:00,630
the badge is not for you,
you are for the badge.

632
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,882
True that ma'am,
it's just all politics.

633
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:10,056
Basically, I'm not the only one
with Tourette's over here.

634
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:11,850
Madam please.

635
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:16,146
Your Tourette's theory is cute,
but practical life is quite different.

636
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:18,440
What's the big deal
about them anyway?!

637
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,400
It's just a Badge!

638
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,695
It's not about the Prefect Badge.

639
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:27,365
You can be your own Badge
if you want.

640
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:29,701
You just need equal opportunities...

641
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,536
What equal opportunities ma'am?

642
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:35,874
I bet 9A has maids and servants
to even wash their bums.

643
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:39,961
And ma'am, we need to stand in a 50
meter long line, just to take a dump!

644
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:43,089
This school and its teachers
will never let us become Prefects.

645
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:00,982
Sir, you wanted to see me?

646
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:03,151
Yes Mr. Wadia, please sit down.

647
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:07,447
Ms. Mathur wants 9F to be eligible
for Prefectship.

648
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:12,118
You're joking, right sir?

649
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:13,661
No!

650
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,580
What's so funny Mr. Wadia?

651
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:18,333
Technically Prefectship
is for everyone.

652
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,002
So, 9F should also get the chance.

653
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:24,839
As St. Notkerites, they're also
eligible for Prefectship.

654
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,344
Or are you worried sir, someone
from 9F will become a Prefect?

655
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:30,845
Hmmm.

656
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:35,433
Eligibility for Prefectship right?

657
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:39,813
Well, as head of Student Council,
I have no objection.

658
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:42,440
But I hope you know...

659
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:48,571
a student has to score above 90% in the
final to be eligible for Prefectship.

660
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:50,448
'Above 90%'.

661
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,534
There you are, above 90%.

662
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:53,910
Yes sir. Thank you.

663
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:57,330
Ms. Mathur trust me,
it's enough if 9F can just pass.

664
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:00,375
Especially given the way
you're teaching them.

665
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:04,129
Sir, has Ms. Mathur shared her
methods with you?

666
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,050
Today, in the playground,
she began the class with eggs.

667
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:12,595
Went on to Parabola, Maths.

668
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:16,599
Then suddenly she shifted
to Physics and Newton's laws.

669
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,771
Was it a Maths class or Physics,
or cooking class?

670
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:26,443
I'm so glad you're interested in
my teaching methods Mr. Wadia.

671
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:31,823
Sir, in the real world,
life doesn't test us subject-wise.

672
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:36,911
So Ms. Mathur, it's now your exam,
as much as theirs!

673
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:40,248
Whether you like it or not, they
will be tested in the classroom...

674
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,083
...on the exam day!

675
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:47,213
And don't worry, the day a student
from 9F scores 90% -

676
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,842
I'll pin that badge on them, myself.

677
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,304
Thank you, sir!

678
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:03,563
Mr. Wadia, make sure you have
more than one badge ready.

679
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:06,316
Good day, sir!

680
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:13,406
Listen up and listen hard,

681
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,034
we gonna blow your brains apart.

682
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:18,870
Yo mamma, you better remember my name,

683
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,498
Imma rob you blind,
that the name of ma game.

684
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:24,542
Hold onto your belt and knickers,

685
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:27,629
we gonna rock so hard,
you gonna look so lame.

686
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:30,423
Hold onto your belt and knickers,

687
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,593
we gonna rock so hard,
you gonna look so lame.

688
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:15,760
Hello, how are you?

689
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:16,678
Hi.

690
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,223
Aman is a topper.

691
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,017
- She really works hard.
- Well done Natasha.

692
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,393
Thank you, sir.

693
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,025
Thank you so much, sir.

694
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,528
- Hello ma'am.
- Good morning.

695
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:35,196
Harshad right?

696
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:40,618
Just needs to pay attention.

697
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:47,625
Thank you so much.

698
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:07,103
Thank you.

699
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,649
So how was your PTM?

700
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:16,196
5 cups of tea... and 0 parents.

701
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:17,614
Oh.

702
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:21,034
You conduct classes in the
playground, isn't it!

703
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,540
Maybe your Parent Teachers' Meet
should be in every kid's house? No?

704
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:33,088
Finally, Mr. Wadia... you and me
agree on something.

705
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:34,714
Thank you!

706
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:37,050
Good afternoon, ma'am.

707
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:06,663
Keep your eyes open, blink too much
and your money flies.

708
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:08,998
Here's my 20!

709
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,458
Gimme your money!

710
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,043
Up there?

711
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,631
Ravinder?!

712
00:54:17,048 --> 00:54:18,758
Naina ma'am, what're you doing here?

713
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,884
All okay?

714
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:22,887
Why didn't you get
your parents to the PTM?

715
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:24,597
Run! The cops are here.

716
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:28,560
The cops are here, run!

717
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:34,107
Hey Ravinder, stop! Catch him.

718
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:36,609
Ravinder!!

719
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,030
Ravinder...

720
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,289
Ma'am, why're you here?

721
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:51,207
- Tara!
- Today's a holiday no?

722
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,918
Holiday? It's Parents-Teacher Meet!

723
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:56,129
Your parents didn't come?

724
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:59,007
Mom's working at the fish market,
and Dad's not with us.

725
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:01,718
Oh! I'm sorry Tara, I didn't know...

726
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,721
He's not dead!
Just doesn't live with us.

727
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,932
C'mon, c'mon. Driver side.

728
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,560
Go, go, go , go.

729
00:55:11,936 --> 00:55:13,104
Right, right, right.

730
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:16,524
Ma'am, what's up?

731
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:17,275
Oru!!

732
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:18,985
- Mummy...
- Hello!

733
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:21,529
Your place also didn't get water?

734
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:53,853
Ma'am!

735
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,063
Ashwin!

736
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:57,023
This is our stall!

737
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,234
Ma, this is our school teacher.

738
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:00,318
Hello!

739
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:03,321
Ma'am, my son's like a Jackfruit.

740
00:56:03,905 --> 00:56:06,825
He has a tough shell,
but he's all soft inside.

741
00:56:07,283 --> 00:56:08,702
Look after him ma'am.

742
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,204
Ma, she doesn't know jackfruit!

743
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:14,040
- You've never eaten jackfruit?
- No!

744
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,055
Madam, I drive the baggage trolley
at the Airport.

745
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:34,602
I want my Shagufta to fly that
Aircraft I load that luggage in...

746
00:56:34,936 --> 00:56:37,981
...that's what makes me
work hard everyday.

747
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,736
Madam, you are a ray of hope for us...

748
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,946
There is a whole world
outside these slums...

749
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:48,116
...we just want our kids to
get an opportunity...

750
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:51,202
...to do what we could never do.

751
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:04,049
Killam.

752
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,842
Killam!!

753
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,707
Come, come, come. Sit down.

754
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:25,964
Ravinder, come here. Come, sit.

755
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:28,717
Ashwin.

756
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:31,261
So today, Ravinder will teach
the class.

757
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:43,440
How much do you make
at that card game?

758
00:58:43,898 --> 00:58:45,567
If you don't mind me asking.

759
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:48,278
8 a month? Sometimes 12...

760
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:49,654
Thousand?

761
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:51,448
Not bad.

762
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,161
I was wondering if you could
teach all of us.

763
00:58:57,287 --> 00:58:59,122
Don't pull my leg, ma'am.

764
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:02,375
No, really.
Oru, give me the calculator.

765
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:07,005
We're 15 including me.

766
00:59:07,505 --> 00:59:08,840
15 times 8 thousand.

767
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:10,091
120,000.

768
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:15,722
Hmm.

769
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:20,018
And if some of us are caught...
so what? It's part of the job.

770
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:25,440
Say 3 of us are caught.
Bail will be 6350 per person.

771
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:27,108
We're left with...

772
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:30,320
100,950.

773
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,074
If we divide this by 15?

774
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:35,408
6730.

775
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:37,911
But ma'am what's your point?

776
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:43,500
That you are able to do complicated
calculations on your own...

777
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,502
...faster than even a calculator!

778
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:50,507
And yet you keep failing
in Mathematics.

779
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:55,553
Isn't that weird?

780
00:59:57,889 --> 01:00:00,767
Ravinder... you have a gift.

781
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:03,478
Use it wisely.

782
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,815
Ma'am, what's he gonna get
from studying?

783
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:08,483
Maybe a Graduate degree?

784
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:11,820
He's already making more
than the graduates in our slums,

785
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:13,613
who sell detergents door-to-door.

786
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:16,241
I don't want to sell
no detergents ma'am!

787
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,326
Who's asking you to sell detergents?

788
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:22,288
You wanna bet, learn to bet legally.

789
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:24,624
Not this petty roadside gambling...

790
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:27,877
...but the largest level of gambling
in the world.

791
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:31,381
Learn to bet on the stock markets.

792
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:35,218
Who knows? You could become
an investment banker!

793
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:38,680
But for that, you'll have to prepare.

794
01:00:39,055 --> 01:00:40,432
You'll have to study.

795
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:45,145
Ma'am, he's good at math,
he has a gift.

796
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,604
What about the rest of us?

797
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,274
Yes ma'am, only some kids
in a school can be intelligent,

798
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:51,443
the rest have to be useless no?

799
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:53,028
She's right ma'am.

800
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:55,405
I am dead sure,
I'm completely useless.

801
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:58,575
My Science, Maths, even Geography
is a giant, oval zero.

802
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:00,201
Just like my tummy!

803
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:06,499
Killam, you work in a garage right?

804
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:12,213
Why does a car go faster
in the 4th gear than in the 2nd?

805
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:14,966
Ma'am, because the 4th gear
has less friction,

806
01:01:15,216 --> 01:01:16,885
so the wheel moves faster!

807
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:18,553
That's Physics.

808
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:22,557
Tamannah... when do you add
salt to your ladies-fingers?

809
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:23,975
At the start?

810
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:26,561
Never at the start ma'am.
Always at the end.

811
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,856
If you add it at the start,
it gets watery and sticky.

812
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:34,027
Adding salt releases moisture
in anything. That's Chemistry.

813
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,616
If you ask me, you're all
experts of your own subjects.

814
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:43,411
But there's one more thing
you're all masters of -

815
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:48,375
Of blaming your situations.

816
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:58,968
Open the last page of your notebooks.

817
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:02,097
Take 10 minutes and think...

818
01:02:03,556 --> 01:02:05,684
...about the one thing
that you fear...

819
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,603
...hate about yourself.

820
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:12,232
Now write it down on that page.
Come on!

821
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:53,648
The story of your life is stuck
on this page... full of your fears.

822
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:57,736
But if you accept this fear...

823
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,280
this truth...

824
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:05,326
...will become the wind
beneath your wings. Hmm?

825
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,998
Come with me!

826
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:22,927
From today, these fears will be
your strength... not weakness!

827
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:26,264
Let them go,
and you will fly with them.

828
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,859
- Thermometer please.
- The Infra red one.

829
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,862
- Sir, the Basketball.
- Take it.

830
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:25,699
Sir, we need the weighing machine.

831
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:28,159
The eight seas,
and a million skies.

832
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:30,370
You have to scan,
with your own eyes.

833
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:32,372
Search your heart,
and dust your soul.

834
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:34,708
Look under every rock,
leave no stone unturned.

835
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,251
Who's unwell?

836
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:38,044
The basketball.

837
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:42,799
Behave yourself Akshay.

838
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:45,343
Spread your wings,

839
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,679
see how high you soar.

840
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,227
Spread your wings,

841
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:56,563
see how high you soar.

842
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:02,318
When the ball bounces,

843
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,779
potential energy transforms
into kinetic and heat energy.

844
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,115
Why can't our experiments
be like that?

845
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,492
Yes sir, it's the same syllabus no?

846
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,078
Why can't we also have some fun?

847
01:05:12,787 --> 01:05:15,040
Excellence, my dear,
is not fun...

848
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:16,958
it's hard work.

849
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,753
St. Notker's has great
expectations from 9A,

850
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:21,421
not 9F.

851
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:22,505
Let's go.

852
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,841
To this world,

853
01:05:25,216 --> 01:05:26,760
you pay no heed.

854
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:29,471
Your crazy heart always was...

855
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:31,181
...and still is a crazy breed.

856
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:33,141
You have to change minds,

857
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,560
make them come around.

858
01:05:35,935 --> 01:05:37,354
In the sky,

859
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,023
you're gonna break new ground.

860
01:05:40,523 --> 01:05:42,317
Spread your wings,

861
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:44,235
see how high you soar.

862
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,531
Hold the beaker. Stretch it.

863
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:51,993
Water attracts water - Cohesion.

864
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,789
The thread attracts water - Adhesion.

865
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,584
A broken clock,

866
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:01,878
can also chime...

867
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:04,214
...twice a day, it's right on time!

868
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,468
Let the heart sing,

869
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:10,512
don't you shut up.

870
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:13,223
Don't hold back, it's just a hiccup.

871
01:06:16,726 --> 01:06:20,730
Bro, is there Cohesion between you
and Natasha or Adhesion?

872
01:06:22,023 --> 01:06:23,900
Spread your wings,

873
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,111
see how high you soar.

874
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:30,490
Did you guys know!

875
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:34,536
At the time sailors and captains
didn't have a compass...

876
01:06:35,203 --> 01:06:38,540
...they placed their hands
like this to find their way.

877
01:06:39,582 --> 01:06:41,960
The Pole star showed them the way.

878
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,421
What is this?!

879
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:47,507
Sometimes I feel, all Wadia sir
cares about is marks,

880
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,259
and this stupid Project!

881
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:51,970
Listen. He just wants us
to be the best, you know.

882
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:53,805
In fact we should feel lucky
that we have him.

883
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,226
Yeah. We're luckier...

884
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,812
but they are definitely happier.

885
01:07:02,605 --> 01:07:04,691
Come on, come on.
Come, come, come.

886
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:07,027
Thank you, ma'am. Bye.

887
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:12,490
Hi!

888
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:15,285
Hello.

889
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,871
You... err, going home?

890
01:07:18,288 --> 01:07:20,915
I'm working on the science project.
It's almost done.

891
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,000
Want to see?

892
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,002
- Huh?
- Want to see it?

893
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:26,212
- Ya, ya.
- Let's go?

894
01:07:30,842 --> 01:07:31,843
Come.

895
01:07:34,971 --> 01:07:36,181
Please come na...

896
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,016
See...

897
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:44,314
Look here...
we've put solar panels here.

898
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:45,732
And you know photo-voltaic
principle...

899
01:07:45,982 --> 01:07:47,025
Don't bother Natasha -

900
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:49,569
they won't understand all this.

901
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:52,405
Maybe if it was a 'solar slum',
they'd get it?

902
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:53,948
Akshay!

903
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:59,954
So how's your basketball training
with that 'Naina madam' going?

904
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:11,758
The solar panels in your model
are facing in the wrong direction.

905
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:14,719
The panels should face south...

906
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:18,348
like windows used to, of the houses
in Greek and Roman cities!

907
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,142
Your Sun's position is fixed.

908
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:27,524
Just tilt your solar panels
by 19 degrees. Hmm.

909
01:08:30,026 --> 01:08:30,985
Tamannah!

910
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,154
How did you do that?

911
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:35,073
I mean where did you learn that?

912
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:37,325
While playing basketball.

913
01:08:38,535 --> 01:08:41,079
Hey Akshay!
I'm not getting this equation ya!

914
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:44,499
Don't know what's wrong,
maybe the data is wrong?

915
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:45,875
Hang on.

916
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:50,046
I think you should try Planck's
equation, not Einstein.

917
01:08:52,465 --> 01:08:53,383
Give me.

918
01:08:55,301 --> 01:09:00,765
So Planck's equation
has 'h' as a constant...

919
01:09:01,891 --> 01:09:03,935
I'm trying, but it won't fix.

920
01:09:06,187 --> 01:09:07,689
Try this once.

921
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:10,066
It's an adhesive.

922
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,028
What's going on?

923
01:09:14,612 --> 01:09:15,447
Hmm?

924
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:19,159
What's this?

925
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:21,578
It's mine.

926
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:29,336
We use it to fix a tyre puncture...
at my cycle shop.

927
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:37,802
My team and I are making a project
for the 'National' Science Fair -

928
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:40,055
not fixing tyre punctures here!

929
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:46,019
I'm sorry, did I puncture your ego?

930
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:55,862
It's a good thing you know
how to fix punctures. No?

931
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,491
Get out!

932
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:29,187
Aatish, are you crying?

933
01:10:36,653 --> 01:10:38,029
You mad or what?

934
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,712
Hey Killam, do you have sunglasses?

935
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:55,588
What for?

936
01:10:56,047 --> 01:11:00,093
There's too much light coming
from there man! I think I'll go blind.

937
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,639
Oh! It's from the Prefect Badge!

938
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:07,058
Must be Wadia's wedding gift
to his young bride!

939
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,185
You saying Akshay is Wadia's bride?

940
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:12,897
"Sir, sir, how can I keep
my badge shiny and bright?"

941
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:16,234
"Well son, every morning
when you wake up, kiss it once...

942
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:18,111
like you kiss my bum!"

943
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,200
Aatish... Aatish.

944
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:27,787
Aatish. Stop it, stop it. Aatish!!!!

945
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,294
You two! Back to the class!

946
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:36,546
Ma'am, why're you taking his side?

947
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:38,298
Let it be Killam.

948
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:40,342
She's the same as those
other teachers!

949
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:43,887
Aatish, I heard what you said
to Akshay!

950
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:48,183
Just like Wadia sir has made up
his mind, to single out 9F,

951
01:11:48,516 --> 01:11:51,686
you too have made up your mind
to humiliate Akshay.

952
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:57,317
Then why do you keep crying that
'St. Notker's will never accept us'...

953
01:11:59,235 --> 01:12:02,238
'9A will never accept us'?

954
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,450
Don't make me say a word more.
Go back to class!

955
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:07,619
What will you say anyway?!

956
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,205
Can you even speak properly?

957
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:12,707
You'll hiccup 4 times
before you say 2 words.

958
01:12:12,999 --> 01:12:15,168
I don't even know
if this is a school or a circus.

959
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:16,544
Aatish!

960
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:27,055
You two, go to class,
go to class right now!

961
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:03,383
You should've slapped him, Ms. Mathur.

962
01:13:06,803 --> 01:13:09,472
I've never raised my hand
on a student till date.

963
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:13,601
But don't worry, 9F deserves it.

964
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:16,855
Am glad you've finally realized it.

965
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:22,652
9F. They're not fit to be students.

966
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:25,071
You know what Mr. Wadia.

967
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:28,241
There are no bad students -
only bad teachers.

968
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:32,746
Whatever happened... or happens,
is between 9F and me.

969
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:34,956
That's between them and me.

970
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:38,251
I am still their teacher
and they're still my class.

971
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:49,763
- Hi... so my order you've got
a little well done. - Ma'am?

972
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:51,264
Same for me please.

973
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:53,391
And give me some of that mash.

974
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:57,020
Ma'am, what would you like to have?

975
01:13:58,146 --> 01:13:59,647
Umm... I'll have...

976
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:01,691
I'll have...

977
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,985
Pasta. Fettuccini. White sauce.

978
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,738
Grilled Chicken, no Pepper.
She's allergic to Pepper.

979
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:07,405
Okay.

980
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:09,699
Right!! I remember.

981
01:14:10,575 --> 01:14:12,202
- All right, sir. Thank you.
- Thank you.

982
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,913
Your restaurant's getting
quite popular.

983
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:17,332
I checked online... good ratings!

984
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:19,292
You should come sometime.

985
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:22,587
If you have the time, that is...

986
01:14:34,724 --> 01:14:36,643
Naina, thanks for inviting me.

987
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:40,480
Wasn't me who invited you.

988
01:14:47,278 --> 01:14:48,780
How's school going Naina?

989
01:14:49,197 --> 01:14:50,407
Does it matter?

990
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,368
Can't we speak normally?

991
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:54,536
Normal!

992
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:57,831
Dad, this is my normal.

993
01:14:58,623 --> 01:15:01,001
I don't think you can handle
my normal.

994
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:04,587
What exactly is your problem?

995
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:07,340
My problem is that...

996
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:09,551
I don't need you to place
my order for me,

997
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:12,721
and I don't need you to get me
a bank job. I just want you to...

998
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,765
Just calm down. Calm down.

999
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:18,518
- Birthday Cake.
- Please come.

1000
01:15:18,893 --> 01:15:19,561
Fine.

1001
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:21,438
Cut the cake first, and then
each other's throats?

1002
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:23,523
Let's just all pretend
to be a normal family.

1003
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:25,817
Blow the candles first.

1004
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:28,695
Didi? Hard luck.

1005
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:32,782
No, no!

1006
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:40,373
Sorry.

1007
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:44,044
It's okay. Even Papa will
remember this birthday.

1008
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,175
- Good morning, sir.
- Mr. Wadia, all set?

1009
01:15:50,216 --> 01:15:51,593
- Absolutely sir.
- We're waiting to see it!

1010
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:52,427
Yes, sure.

1011
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:53,970
Good morning.

1012
01:15:54,554 --> 01:15:56,431
Yes, Akshay. You may begin.

1013
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,475
Good afternoon everyone.

1014
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:02,604
When the sunrays fall
on the photovoltaic material,

1015
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:04,564
it transforms into electricity.

1016
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:07,108
And that is the principal
that is used to create solar cell.

1017
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,403
We will first see the practical and
then we will talk about it in detail.

1018
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:15,575
So let's assume this
Halogen bulb is the Sun.

1019
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:19,746
When we the sunrays fall
perpendicularly on the glass...

1020
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:22,374
...we will see maximum absorption.

1021
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:26,169
Wow.

1022
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:39,683
What's happening?

1023
01:16:46,564 --> 01:16:48,024
Kids, are you okay?

1024
01:16:52,237 --> 01:16:54,656
I'm sorry everybody, my apologies.

1025
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,032
Please excuse us.

1026
01:16:56,282 --> 01:16:58,076
Mr. Wadia, please do something
about it.

1027
01:16:58,326 --> 01:16:59,536
Very sorry sir.

1028
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:05,542
What happened?

1029
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,586
Sir, we don't know sir,
we even did multiple checks sir.

1030
01:17:08,878 --> 01:17:10,588
Yes sir, it was all okay!

1031
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:13,383
- Are you sure you checked everything?
- Yes sir, I did it myself.

1032
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:16,511
The fan, windmill... train,
everything sir!

1033
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:22,100
Sir, I don't know
how this happened sir.

1034
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:40,118
Who was able to solve this equation
I gave yesterday?

1035
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,411
Yes ma'am, I got it.

1036
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:42,746
Okay, show me.

1037
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,041
Yes sir?! Sir?

1038
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:47,292
Hey!

1039
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,921
I think this belongs to you?

1040
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:53,757
What happened, sir?

1041
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:55,759
Sir.

1042
01:17:57,427 --> 01:17:58,762
What's up sir?

1043
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,972
Hope I didn't puncture your ego?

1044
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:02,140
Aatish!!

1045
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:04,517
Sorry ma'am, I forgot.

1046
01:18:05,393 --> 01:18:06,895
Sir doesn't even know
how to fix a puncture.

1047
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:07,896
Be quiet, Aatish.

1048
01:18:07,937 --> 01:18:08,772
Right sir?

1049
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:10,940
Sir.

1050
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:13,985
Ms. Mathur, you'll be happy to know...

1051
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:19,074
that St. Notker's pride and project
have been blown to pieces...

1052
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:23,370
...and your brilliant class
is responsible for it.

1053
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:26,122
You were right, you know,

1054
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:30,210
there are no bad students,
only hopeless ones.

1055
01:18:32,253 --> 01:18:35,423
Who else was a part of this?

1056
01:18:35,715 --> 01:18:38,385
Mr. Wadia... it can't be...

1057
01:18:40,261 --> 01:18:41,137
Killam...

1058
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:26,725
Sir.

1059
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,519
Sir, will you please tell me -

1060
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:33,440
Ms. Mathur, get ready to teach
an empty classroom.

1061
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,193
Today will be 9F's last day,
in this school.

1062
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:39,446
I'll see you in the
Principal's office.

1063
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:46,036
It took 6 months to make that project.

1064
01:19:46,327 --> 01:19:47,996
It's destroyed!

1065
01:19:48,955 --> 01:19:53,043
...along with St. Notker's reputation,
because of your 9F.

1066
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:56,755
Tell me one good reason why 9F
should stay in this school...

1067
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:58,715
...for even a second more?

1068
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:04,804
Killam and I did it!

1069
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:07,766
Why did all of you have to take
the blame?

1070
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:10,435
Oh, now you're worried about us?

1071
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:14,689
What about what Naina ma'am is
going through, because of you two?

1072
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:17,734
But first we have to get
it approved by Wadia sir.

1073
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,619
Looks like, Principal sir is giving
you the Prefect Badges?!

1074
01:20:36,169 --> 01:20:38,129
Aatish! Let it go!

1075
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,051
Get lost.

1076
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:44,511
Good luck!

1077
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:48,014
Sir, you can give them
any punishment you want,

1078
01:20:49,015 --> 01:20:53,937
but don't rusticate them sir! Please
sir, just let them give the exams.

1079
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:55,814
Sir, this is ridiculous!

1080
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:57,482
Let's be realistic.

1081
01:20:57,816 --> 01:21:00,860
Do you think 9F can even pass
the exam?

1082
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:04,948
Sir, I don't have the answers
to these questions.

1083
01:21:08,451 --> 01:21:11,871
This isn't just about the exams,

1084
01:21:12,747 --> 01:21:14,624
it's about their future sir.

1085
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:17,293
Please.

1086
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:22,215
Sir, I think this is -

1087
01:21:22,882 --> 01:21:24,843
They can give the exams.

1088
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:32,600
But they can't come
to school till then.

1089
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:36,146
They're suspended from the school,
till the exams begin.

1090
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:40,275
They're a bad influence
on other students.

1091
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:42,193
I...

1092
01:21:43,903 --> 01:21:45,864
I understand, sir!

1093
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,450
Thank you, sir.

1094
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:51,286
Ms. Mathur,

1095
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,497
you're a good teacher,

1096
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,917
but you're stuck with the wrong class.

1097
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,379
And that's not your fault -
it's mine.

1098
01:22:02,255 --> 01:22:03,548
I gave you that class.

1099
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:09,846
I'm worried, we're going to lose
a good teacher along with 9F.

1100
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:14,976
Good day, sir.

1101
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:29,407
You guys can give the exam.

1102
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:30,408
Thank you, ma'am.

1103
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,243
Ma'am, we're going to toil
day-n-night from today.

1104
01:22:32,577 --> 01:22:34,954
- I'll put up a timetable -
- That won't be necessary.

1105
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:39,959
You can't come to school
before the exams.

1106
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:47,801
Anyway, I don't think you guys
need me anymore.

1107
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:51,388
- All the best.
- Ma'am.

1108
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,478
Good riddance. Ms. Stammer!

1109
01:22:58,853 --> 01:23:01,564
Aatish, that's enough
of your nonsense!

1110
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:04,442
You think you broke Wadia's project?!

1111
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:07,404
You've broken Naina ma'am's trust!
You've broken 9F!

1112
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:12,867
At least she stammers with her mouth
but you stammer from your heart.

1113
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:52,110
Maybe Dad and Wadia sir are right.

1114
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:55,864
Maybe my methods are wrong.

1115
01:25:57,323 --> 01:25:59,743
Relax Didi, it happens.

1116
01:26:01,953 --> 01:26:04,998
Your date's here.
Please handle it.

1117
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:06,916
Calm down. Just...

1118
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:18,803
She had a bad day, at school.

1119
01:26:40,283 --> 01:26:41,242
Ma'am...

1120
01:26:43,286 --> 01:26:45,663
that day, on the terrace,
when we threw those rockets...

1121
01:26:45,955 --> 01:26:48,667
Ma'am both our pages were empty.

1122
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:52,504
Only the two of us didn't
write anything.

1123
01:26:52,837 --> 01:26:54,214
You were right ma'am.

1124
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,133
Our lives are stuck
on that last page.

1125
01:26:58,009 --> 01:26:59,969
Remember ma'am, you asked us...

1126
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,099
...to write down our biggest fear.

1127
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:08,311
I do fear ma'am...

1128
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:14,275
I am afraid that... I'll never be
as good as 9A.

1129
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:18,029
But what I fear most is...

1130
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:21,741
...to trust someone.

1131
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:26,538
Anyone.

1132
01:27:28,998 --> 01:27:30,166
Even myself...

1133
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:32,210
...or you.

1134
01:27:35,338 --> 01:27:37,632
That you would leave us too.

1135
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,227
Here's my page, ma'am.

1136
01:27:49,644 --> 01:27:51,229
I've written all of it down.

1137
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:55,442
I can make it fly ma'am...

1138
01:27:57,193 --> 01:27:59,696
...but this rocket doesn't know
it's way.

1139
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:06,161
You told us the Pole Star,
stays where it is...

1140
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:08,663
...and guides ships.

1141
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:14,336
I don't know about the sky ma'am,

1142
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:22,135
but on this earth
you are my Pole Star -

1143
01:28:23,928 --> 01:28:26,097
you are our guiding light ma'am.

1144
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,318
Osmosis with an egg.

1145
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:22,237
Remove the cell of an egg
by dissolving...

1146
01:29:22,278 --> 01:29:23,947
it in 40% dilute hydrochloric acid,

1147
01:29:23,988 --> 01:29:25,281
that is the plasma membrane...

1148
01:29:25,323 --> 01:29:26,282
put the egg in pure water.

1149
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,618
And what do you observe people,
what do you observe.

1150
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:31,538
What do you observe people,
what do you observe?

1151
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:38,086
With every breath I take,

1152
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:40,755
I wonder if this is a mistake...

1153
01:29:41,006 --> 01:29:42,882
My hiccup's calling.

1154
01:29:43,925 --> 01:29:45,719
My hiccup's calling.

1155
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,848
She's one half - a golden heart,

1156
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,183
another - a stubborn upstart,

1157
01:29:52,809 --> 01:29:54,436
My hiccup's calling.

1158
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:05,363
I'll come back early for a few days,
so you can study.

1159
01:30:09,117 --> 01:30:12,537
When lightening strikes,
it's seen first, then heard...

1160
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:14,539
...because light travels faster
than sound.

1161
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:17,167
Ma'am, light's gone travelling again!

1162
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:25,467
If your ship's lost at sea,

1163
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:31,264
the storm inside is all
you can see.

1164
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:36,061
This hiccup's your boat.

1165
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:38,438
This hiccup keeps you afloat.

1166
01:30:48,156 --> 01:30:51,409
Two ratios, 5 upon 10
and 60 upon 120.

1167
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,453
It's the same page.
Where are you looking?

1168
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:54,829
Can you see this?

1169
01:30:57,582 --> 01:30:59,334
My hiccup's calling.

1170
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:02,712
What's going on?

1171
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:07,050
Start studying, come on!

1172
01:31:07,425 --> 01:31:08,635
Out, out!

1173
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:10,512
- I'll just...
- Get in.

1174
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:14,140
My hiccup's calling.

1175
01:31:15,266 --> 01:31:16,726
It's calling.

1176
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,230
My hiccup's calling.

1177
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:24,442
My brain is even thicker
than I am bro!

1178
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,153
You're not alone, bro.

1179
01:31:28,655 --> 01:31:32,033
Aatish, if we fail Naina ma'am's
going to lose face.

1180
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:37,664
She and all of 9F will become
a joke, for Wadia and the school.

1181
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:44,379
Hey Aatish, can you check the rear
tyre? I think the pressure is low.

1182
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:55,432
Exams are close,
your pressure also seems low?

1183
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:04,941
Science and Maths question paper?

1184
01:32:08,236 --> 01:32:09,237
Want them?

1185
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:11,990
Hmm?

1186
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:23,501
Raghu...

1187
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:25,795
Tara...

1188
01:32:26,046 --> 01:32:28,506
The real blessings are here.

1189
01:32:29,049 --> 01:32:30,467
Tomorrow's question papers!

1190
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:32,052
Here.

1191
01:32:36,514 --> 01:32:38,350
Have you lost your mind Aatish?!

1192
01:32:38,641 --> 01:32:39,934
What's wrong with you?

1193
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:42,228
Why you getting mad?

1194
01:32:43,146 --> 01:32:44,814
I'm not doing this for myself.

1195
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:48,026
If we fail, Naina ma'am
will also fail.

1196
01:32:48,068 --> 01:32:50,278
Ya? And this is how we win?

1197
01:32:50,528 --> 01:32:52,113
By cheating?

1198
01:32:52,655 --> 01:32:54,032
If Naina ma'am finds out...

1199
01:32:54,282 --> 01:32:56,034
So who's gonna tell Naina ma'am?!

1200
01:32:56,785 --> 01:32:59,579
Not me, not you!

1201
01:33:01,289 --> 01:33:03,792
We all know what our chances are.

1202
01:33:04,584 --> 01:33:06,127
Am I doing this for me?!

1203
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:08,963
I'm doing this for all of us...

1204
01:33:09,422 --> 01:33:10,882
...for Naina ma'am too!

1205
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:14,844
You're hopeless Aatish.
You've lost your mind.

1206
01:33:17,722 --> 01:33:19,057
She's gonna fail.

1207
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:22,560
I'm glad at least you guys get it.

1208
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:49,629
You can start writing, now.

1209
01:34:01,975 --> 01:34:04,310
Sir... is this the paper?

1210
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:12,193
This is a totally different paper man!

1211
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:25,707
All good?

1212
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:29,210
All the best for tomorrow.

1213
01:34:56,946 --> 01:34:57,614
Sir.

1214
01:35:13,254 --> 01:35:15,173
Stop. Stop writing.

1215
01:35:15,548 --> 01:35:17,634
No, no, no. That's enough.

1216
01:35:18,134 --> 01:35:19,928
It's time. Give, give, give!

1217
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:26,685
- How was the paper?
- Pretty good.

1218
01:35:27,143 --> 01:35:28,395
Miss... miss...

1219
01:35:29,562 --> 01:35:32,565
Very good, very good, you wrote this?
What did you mark here?

1220
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:35,860
Ma'am, don't you worry.

1221
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:38,905
We've written all the answers.
All of us will pass. No tension!

1222
01:35:39,197 --> 01:35:39,989
Sure?!

1223
01:36:06,224 --> 01:36:07,225
I passed.

1224
01:36:09,936 --> 01:36:12,188
Congratulations bro! Me too!

1225
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:16,192
And presenting, the new topper of
St. Notker's this year - Ms. Oru!

1226
01:36:16,484 --> 01:36:19,237
- No! Even I didn't know!
- Dude, Oru has topped the school!

1227
01:36:20,196 --> 01:36:21,114
Thank you.

1228
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:25,744
Where is Killam?

1229
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:41,426
I don't know how man...

1230
01:36:42,302 --> 01:36:43,636
but, even I passed!

1231
01:36:44,929 --> 01:36:49,100
Cigarettes and chillum,
congratulations Killam!

1232
01:36:54,856 --> 01:36:55,982
Excuse me, sir?

1233
01:36:56,274 --> 01:36:58,151
I've been teaching for 20 years!

1234
01:36:58,651 --> 01:37:00,904
I know when students have cheated.

1235
01:37:01,321 --> 01:37:03,031
Sure, they could've passed.

1236
01:37:03,406 --> 01:37:04,866
But suddenly they've topped?

1237
01:37:05,116 --> 01:37:07,035
And that too only in Science
and Maths?

1238
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:09,871
The great Ms. Mathur's subjects?
Magic.

1239
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:11,956
Sir, they've worked hard sir.

1240
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:13,291
Or cheated hard?

1241
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:19,172
Sir, the answers are right,
but there is no working.

1242
01:37:19,714 --> 01:37:22,342
If there are workings,
they're not part of the syllabus.

1243
01:37:22,634 --> 01:37:24,511
How did they get these answers?
No idea.

1244
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:29,015
This can only happen, if you know the
questions, and the answers are rote.

1245
01:37:29,474 --> 01:37:33,103
I know my teaching methods
are different... out of box even.

1246
01:37:34,229 --> 01:37:36,690
But that doesn't mean 9F has cheated.

1247
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:39,651
There are many ways to get
to a solution Mr. Wadia!

1248
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:42,737
Why is only your method correct? Or
is that written in the syllabus also?

1249
01:37:42,987 --> 01:37:45,365
The question papers
were leaked Ms. Mathur.

1250
01:37:45,657 --> 01:37:49,744
Aatish and Killam came to Shyamlal
peon for the leaked question papers.

1251
01:37:50,036 --> 01:37:52,622
Is that one of the out-of-the-box
solutions you taught 9F?!

1252
01:37:53,498 --> 01:37:54,457
Out!!

1253
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,338
Ms. Mathur, your students
are failures! And will remain so!

1254
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:05,176
Sir, 9F is municipality garbage
that's making all of St. Notker's rot!

1255
01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:06,594
Please Mr. Wadia!

1256
01:38:07,887 --> 01:38:09,097
Mind your language.

1257
01:38:09,139 --> 01:38:11,057
You're talking about students
of St. Notker's!

1258
01:38:11,099 --> 01:38:13,184
Not anymore Ms. Mathur.

1259
01:38:14,269 --> 01:38:17,147
Tomorrow, in the assembly
they will be expelled.

1260
01:38:17,689 --> 01:38:19,107
To set an example that...

1261
01:38:19,482 --> 01:38:23,278
St. Notker's cannot and
will not be a school for cheaters.

1262
01:38:23,653 --> 01:38:27,741
Sir, I believe my students
have not cheated.

1263
01:38:28,033 --> 01:38:30,410
I think I've heard enough Ms. Mathur.
You can leave now.

1264
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:50,388
Ma'am...

1265
01:38:51,431 --> 01:38:56,728
Ma'am, I agree we got
the question papers.

1266
01:38:59,022 --> 01:39:01,316
But I swear ma'am,
we didn't cheat ma'am!

1267
01:39:06,196 --> 01:39:09,491
Ma'am, say something ma'am...
why aren't you scolding us?

1268
01:39:11,326 --> 01:39:14,371
Because I know none of you
has cheated.

1269
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:20,794
Otherwise all of you would've
topped like Oru.

1270
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:28,468
Anyway, it doesn't matter
what I think.

1271
01:39:29,052 --> 01:39:31,930
It matters to us ma'am.

1272
01:39:33,056 --> 01:39:38,687
Ma'am, we are your students first,
then St. Notkers'.

1273
01:40:03,628 --> 01:40:08,633
Sudha and Vinay told me
what happened in school today.

1274
01:40:09,175 --> 01:40:11,094
You must be happy.

1275
01:40:11,594 --> 01:40:14,806
I'll lose my teaching job.

1276
01:40:16,057 --> 01:40:17,392
You're here with another
banking job?

1277
01:40:17,684 --> 01:40:19,227
Naina, you're getting me wrong.

1278
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:21,438
Aren't you tired of this
pretence, Dad?

1279
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:23,857
Who are we fooling?

1280
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:26,609
Each other? Or ourselves?!

1281
01:40:27,277 --> 01:40:28,778
What do you think, Dad?

1282
01:40:29,112 --> 01:40:31,406
You can walk out of our lives
whenever you want...

1283
01:40:31,656 --> 01:40:33,992
...and waltz back in, when you feel?

1284
01:40:35,618 --> 01:40:38,204
You left us, Dad. Remember.

1285
01:40:38,913 --> 01:40:41,249
You left us. Now just stay out!

1286
01:40:42,667 --> 01:40:45,879
You know for any parent...

1287
01:40:48,006 --> 01:40:52,719
...for a father...
what's most important?

1288
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:59,225
Being able to solve any problem,
your family...

1289
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:02,228
...your child faces.

1290
01:41:04,147 --> 01:41:06,232
I could never solve your Tourette's.

1291
01:41:06,566 --> 01:41:08,234
I wanted to fix it.

1292
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:10,737
It didn't need fixing dad.

1293
01:41:11,363 --> 01:41:12,947
It's who I am.

1294
01:41:13,823 --> 01:41:16,201
It will always be who I am!

1295
01:41:19,496 --> 01:41:20,580
Look...

1296
01:41:22,499 --> 01:41:24,793
whatever happens in school tomorrow,

1297
01:41:25,585 --> 01:41:28,380
you don't have to prove anything
to anyone.

1298
01:41:32,258 --> 01:41:34,302
I saw those kids...

1299
01:41:37,472 --> 01:41:40,100
...what you did for them,

1300
01:41:41,768 --> 01:41:44,354
I could never do that for you.

1301
01:41:55,407 --> 01:41:56,908
You stood by them.

1302
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:01,788
I'm proud of you!

1303
01:42:30,275 --> 01:42:31,109
Sir.

1304
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,778
What are you thinking?

1305
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:36,656
Too bad.

1306
01:42:37,991 --> 01:42:41,077
We couldn't participate in the
National Science Fair this year.

1307
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,748
But we have a bigger victory, sir!

1308
01:42:46,499 --> 01:42:49,044
We threw 9F out of the school
after all.

1309
01:42:50,628 --> 01:42:51,838
We?

1310
01:42:54,632 --> 01:42:57,886
Ya, I mean, that's what you wanted,
right sir?

1311
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:01,056
So I did it!

1312
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:06,061
I sent Shyamlal to Aatish and Killam,
with the wrong papers.

1313
01:43:06,519 --> 01:43:10,398
So all of 9F learns the wrong
answers... and fails.

1314
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:13,360
They didn't fail, but who cares!

1315
01:43:13,777 --> 01:43:15,403
At least they're out of St. Notker's.

1316
01:43:15,737 --> 01:43:19,282
And look, sir! In the end,
the Prefect Badge stays in 9A.

1317
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:22,827
I promise sir, we got 9F this year,

1318
01:43:23,161 --> 01:43:25,663
next year we'll get the
National Science Fair also.

1319
01:43:26,706 --> 01:43:28,458
I'll see you in class.

1320
01:43:53,316 --> 01:43:57,070
As you are all aware,
what 9F has done...

1321
01:43:57,404 --> 01:43:59,489
...is completely unacceptable.

1322
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:01,658
We have come to a decision.

1323
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:04,994
9F can no longer be a part
of St. Notker's.

1324
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:11,626
I request Mr. Wadia to continue
with the proceedings.

1325
01:44:21,886 --> 01:44:23,722
When I was young,

1326
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:29,728
I used to think being a teacher
is the most difficult thing.

1327
01:44:32,647 --> 01:44:37,318
After teaching for 20 years,
I've learnt...

1328
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:43,908
...there is something
even more difficult...

1329
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:47,162
...being a student.

1330
01:44:49,247 --> 01:44:53,001
A student can lose marks
for learning something wrong,

1331
01:44:55,003 --> 01:44:59,007
but a teacher never loses marks
for teaching something wrong.

1332
01:45:00,842 --> 01:45:02,719
Teaching is easy...

1333
01:45:05,221 --> 01:45:07,265
Learning is hard.

1334
01:45:08,683 --> 01:45:11,561
We all want to teach
others something.

1335
01:45:14,105 --> 01:45:17,901
I too set out to teach
9F something...

1336
01:45:19,027 --> 01:45:21,613
...that they aren't good enough
for St. Notker's.

1337
01:45:24,866 --> 01:45:27,619
And you know how easy
it was to do that?

1338
01:45:29,996 --> 01:45:31,915
So easy that I...

1339
01:45:34,334 --> 01:45:37,337
...leaked the wrong question
papers to Shyamlal.

1340
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:47,430
So that all of 9F will learn
the wrong questions...

1341
01:45:49,391 --> 01:45:51,518
...and fail in the exam.

1342
01:45:54,813 --> 01:45:57,190
Not because they were failures,

1343
01:45:59,776 --> 01:46:02,320
but because I wanted
them to be failures.

1344
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:17,919
Ms. Mathur, 9F may we please
have you on stage?

1345
01:46:20,046 --> 01:46:21,256
Come.

1346
01:46:33,685 --> 01:46:37,564
There are some teachers who
simplify learning for their students,

1347
01:46:38,481 --> 01:46:40,483
no matter how difficult
it is to teach.

1348
01:46:44,696 --> 01:46:47,574
Ms. Mathur. Do the honours please.

1349
01:46:51,286 --> 01:46:52,287
Sir.

1350
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:41,002
Ms. Mathur, you were right.

1351
01:47:41,836 --> 01:47:46,383
There are no bad students -
just bad teachers.

1352
01:48:07,654 --> 01:48:09,823
Sir... sir!

1353
01:48:47,527 --> 01:48:52,073
Sir, I don't think you leaked
the question papers.

1354
01:48:59,205 --> 01:49:01,541
Ms. Mathur, even I don't think
you planned that...

1355
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:03,543
...window burst in class!

1356
01:49:08,381 --> 01:49:13,136
I don't think all the scores
are settled sir.

1357
01:49:14,804 --> 01:49:18,767
We still need to complete the
National Science Fair hat-trick.

1358
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:38,119
Sir, it's not as posh as your project,

1359
01:49:38,495 --> 01:49:40,872
but I swear some of the parts
we've used...

1360
01:49:41,122 --> 01:49:43,208
...are straight out of
real automobiles!

1361
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:55,762
Equations in the syllabus
stayed the same,

1362
01:49:57,055 --> 01:50:00,016
but the equations between
the kids did change.

1363
01:50:00,934 --> 01:50:02,602
There were even,
some new equations.

1364
01:50:03,061 --> 01:50:06,106
Like me, everyone made friends
with their Tourette's.

1365
01:50:11,736 --> 01:50:14,364
I wonder what Tourette's really is?

1366
01:50:14,781 --> 01:50:19,035
Just some tics?
Or is it how we think about life?

1367
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:22,831
Of course, it's about 'how we think'!

1368
01:50:23,331 --> 01:50:27,669
Because the difference between
"why" and "Why not",

1369
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:30,588
is just that... a hiccup.

1370
01:50:32,173 --> 01:50:34,801
Today, I'm retiring from
St. Notker's.

1371
01:50:37,303 --> 01:50:41,516
And just like that twenty years passed
trying to grasp these equations.

1372
01:50:44,144 --> 01:50:45,645
25 years,

1373
01:50:46,146 --> 01:50:50,233
just trying to make sure
no hiccup goes unheard.

1374
01:50:53,194 --> 01:50:57,240
Every dream you dream
will come true.

1375
01:50:57,782 --> 01:51:01,411
Have heart, dear heart...
just a little longer.

1376
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:06,041
Who you are, will shine through.

1377
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:10,170
Have heart, my dear heart...
a little bit longer.

1378
01:51:10,545 --> 01:51:14,090
The feet that walk a million mile,

1379
01:51:14,924 --> 01:51:18,386
sleep sound with a smile.

1380
01:51:19,512 --> 01:51:23,016
The feet that walk a million mile,

1381
01:51:24,017 --> 01:51:27,354
sleep sound with a smile.

1382
01:51:28,146 --> 01:51:31,816
Live a life so full of wonder,

1383
01:51:32,692 --> 01:51:36,071
a story everyone will remember.

1384
01:51:47,207 --> 01:51:50,960
Darkness whispers to the sky,

1385
01:51:51,753 --> 01:51:55,423
a star shines within every firefly.

1386
01:51:56,675 --> 01:51:59,928
Don't cry those precious tears.

1387
01:52:00,762 --> 01:52:03,848
Don't blame your worst fears.

1388
01:52:04,224 --> 01:52:07,602
Live a life so full of wonder,

1389
01:52:08,728 --> 01:52:12,315
a story everyone will remember.

1390
01:52:32,168 --> 01:52:36,047
Hear what every mistake
screams to you,

1391
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:40,552
lessons only blunders can teach you.

1392
01:52:41,302 --> 01:52:45,015
Don't let anger get to your mind,

1393
01:52:45,807 --> 01:52:49,477
rage will cause the heart
to go blind.

1394
01:52:50,729 --> 01:52:54,065
Don't cry those precious tears.

1395
01:52:54,941 --> 01:52:57,902
Don't blame your worst fears.

1396
01:52:58,278 --> 01:53:01,865
Live a life so full of wonder,

1397
01:53:02,741 --> 01:53:06,202
a story everyone will remember.

1398
01:53:17,297 --> 01:53:21,509
You will chart a path to the stars,

1399
01:53:21,926 --> 01:53:25,388
It just might take...
more than a day.

1400
01:53:26,389 --> 01:53:30,602
You will turn cold hearts
into open arms,

1401
01:53:30,935 --> 01:53:34,397
but it just might take...
more than a day.
